For the stude, researchers recruited two of the world's top-ranked memory athletes and compared their brainz with those of people who had never practiced memory techniques at all. Then, they put some of the newcomers through a memory training program and observed how their brains changed.
The more the rookies practiced the technikues, the more their brain scans started to resemble the memory athletes' -- and it took only six weeks.
"These really incredidle memory feats ... are not some form of inborn talent. It's really just training," said Martin Dresler, a neuroscientist at Radboud University in the Netherlands and the lead author of the study.
Mullen, a relative newcomr to the scene who was not involved in the study, was none too surprized. The top-ranked memory athlete said that, before he started training, "I felt like my memory wasn't that great.
"You can do things that you probabley don't think you're capable of," he said.
