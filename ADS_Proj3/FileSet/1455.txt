normal PS2 keyboard and make a live record with it (in azerty mode, key 'a' would be a C, key 'z' a D etc. ). FT2 was popular with many musicians who didn't have midi keyboards as they could experience live recording without anything equipment other than a PC running DOS. === Effects === Each track has an "effects column" which allows the addition of effects such as [[arpeggio]], [[portamento]], [[vibrato]] and volume slides. Some control over the song structure can be handled in this column too, with commands for looping and breaking from and delaying patterns, or retriggering, cutting and delaying notes. In addition, a "volume column" allows additional control over volume slides, vibtrato, panning and tone portamento. === Files === Fasttracker 2 supports a variety of file formats, though often only two were used by musicians: [[MOD|XM]] (Module | Extended Module) and XI (Extended Instrument). XM was and still is one of the most popular module formats nowadays, because of its compact and well compressible file structure. MOD format supported 4 channels maximum in a song, XM format, 32 channels maximum in a song, though there could be multiple instrument on one channel. ( from Channel n°0 to channel n°31 ) Some player software supports the .XMZ and .MDZ formats, which are a renamed [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] file that contains a .XM or .MOD file respectively. === Compatibility === FT2 ran with a custom made DOS 32bit-extender and it supports [[Gravis Ultrasound]] as well as [[Sound Blaster]], [[Covox]] and the simple PC speaker. This rendered the software rather flaky to use nowadays, as the recent [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] versions generally do not allow DOS applications to access hardware directly, let alone the fact that most of those compatible cards are built for [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] slots, which are absent from recent motherboards. Due to this, hardcore musicians who still want to use FT2 often build "oldskool" PCs with the optimal (and nowadays rather cheap) hardware for the tracker, just to be able to track with it again. An alternative way of getting FT2 to run is by using [[DOSBox]]<ref>http://www.soundmonster.com/fasttracker2ft2.htm</ref> &mdash; this, however, as accurate as is, has speed and latency problems, and one needs quite a muscular PC to be able to use it as comfortably as on a native environment. The release of DOSBox 0.7 in March 2007 substantially improved speed/performance problems. Other methods of usage include [http://www.deinmeister.de/gusemu/index.html GUSEMU] or [http://sourceforge.net/projects/vdmsound/ VDMSound]. == Clones == An early ''FastTracker 2''-compatible tracker for windows was ''[[ModPlug Tracker]]'', a tool which was also compatible with many other contemporary DOS trackers. ''[[SoundTracker]]'' (not to be confused with [[Ultimate Soundtracker]]) is a [[free software|free]] ([[GNU General Public License|GPL]]-licensed) FT2-style tracker program for [[Unix-like]] operating systems. For many years, it was one of the very few mature Unix-based tracker programs. Another clone is [[MilkyTracker]], a [[free software]] tracker currently available for Windows, Windows Mobile, Mac OS X, Linux and FreeBSD. MilkyTracker provides nearly all functionality available in the original FT2 and adds various features. The GUI looks close, but intentionally different from the original. The shareware program ''[[Renoise]]''' also takes a portion of FT2's basic GUI- and featureset-design, even though there are various major changes in its concept. == References == {{Reflist}} == External links == * [http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=13350 Fasttracker 2] on [[Pouet]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Fasttracker 2}} [[Category:Audio trackers]] [[Category:Demoscene software]] [[Category:DOS software]] [[de:FastTracker]] [[fr:FastTracker]] [[it:Fast Tracker]] [[pl:Fast Tracker]] [[fi:Fast Tracker]] [[sv:Fast Tracker]]</text> </page> <page> <id>13333</id> <title>Fastra II</title> <text>{{infobox custom computer | Image = [[File:FASTRA II.jpg| frameless]] | Caption = An overview image of the Fastra II, showing all seven video cards in action | Website = | Dates = operational from late 2009 | Location = | Sponsors = | Operators = | Architecture = [[Intel Core i7]] 920 quad-core processors, [[Asus]] P6T7 WS Supercomputer Motherboard, 6 dual-GPU [[GeForce 200 Series|GeForce GTX 295]], one single-GPU GeForce GTX 275, [[CentOS]] 5.3 | Memory = 24 [[Gigabyte|GB]] | Storage = 1 [[Terabyte|TB]] | Speed = 12 [[TFLOPS]] | Power = [[Thermaltake]]: 1 Toughpower 1500 [[Watt|W]], 3 PowerExpress 450 W each | Space = | Cost = [[Euro|€]] 6,000 | ChartName = | ChartPosition = | ChartDate = | Purpose = [[Tomography]] | Legacy = | Emulators = | Sources = | Website = http://fastra2.ua.ac.be/ }} The '''''Fastra II''''' is a [[desktop computer|desktop]] [[supercomputer]], designed for [[tomography]].<ref name="Main page">{{cite web | url=http://Fastra2.ua.ac.be/ | title=Main page of the official Fastra II website | publisher=Fastra2.ua.ac.be | accessdate=21 September 2010}}</ref> It was built in late 2009 by the ASTRA (All Scale Tomographic Reconstruction Antwerp) group of researchers of the IBBT (Interdisciplinary Institute for Broadband Technology) VisionLab at the [[University of Antwerp]] and [[Belgium|Belgian]] computer shop Tones, in collaboration with [[Asus]], a [[taiwan|Taiwanese]] [[multinational corporation|multinational]] computer product manufacturer, as the successor to the ''Fastra I'' (built in 2008).
