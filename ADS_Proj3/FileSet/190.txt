benefits were performance, lower run-time memory requirements, the ability to execute software without AmigaBASIC, and the ability to distribute software without having to release the actual source code. ACE also provided additional language constructs to expand upon the capability of the AmigaBASIC language. * A/C Basic by Absoft was a compiler for AmigaBASIC programs that turned them into native executables that could be run without AmigaBASIC or the program's source code being present. * '''Cursor''' was another AmigaBASIC editor and compiler. * [[GFA BASIC]], originally developed for the [[Atari ST]], was ported to the Amiga platform by its author, [[Frank Ostrowski]]. * [[HiSoft BASIC]] was another BASIC variant ported from the Atari ST to the Amiga. * [[AMOS (programming language)|AMOS BASIC]], developed by [[François Lionet]], was a commercial language which provided extensive support for the Amiga's graphics hardware and was designed primarily for games programming. It was used to write several commercial games and educational software. * [[Blitz BASIC]] was a direct commercial competitor to AMOS, published by [[Acid Software]]. Like AMOS, it was targeted at games programming. Its successor, Blitz Basic 2, was used to write several commercial games, including the popular [[Team17]] game [[Worms (computer game)|Worms]]. ==References== * Amiga Basic by [[Paul Fellows]], published by [[Dabs Press]], December 1992, ISBN 9781870336871 * Amiga Basic by [[Henning Horst Rainer]], published by [[Jackson Libri]], 1989, ISBN 9788870569667 * Amiga Basic Inside and Out, by [[Christian Spanik]] and [[Hannes Rugheimer]] published by [[Abacus Books]] (Abacus Software Inc.), Jan 1988, ISBN 9780916439873 * Elementary Amiga BASIC by C.

It is mainly based on AmigaOS 3.1 source code, and partially on version 3.9.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKKfq44gXq8 |title="Amiga Inc vs Hyperion Trial is Over - Part 2 of 4" (AmigaOS 3.1 source code [7:15]) |publisher=YouTube.com |date=2009-10-27 |accessdate=2010-09-20 }}</ref> "The Final Update" was released on 24 December 2006 (originally released in April 2004<ref name="OS4 goes gold">[http://hyperion-entertainment.biz/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=90:amigaos-40-developer-pre-release-goes-gold&catid=36:amigaos-4x&Itemid=18 AmigaOS 4.0 Developer Pre-release goes gold]</ref>) after five years of development by the Belgian company [[Hyperion Entertainment]] under license from [[Amiga, Inc]]. for AmigaOne registered users.<ref name="Final Update">[http://www.hyperion-entertainment.biz:8080/news/2007-01-01 AmigaOS 4.0 The Final Update available.]</ref> ==Description== {{See also|AmigaOS}} AmigaOS 4 can be divided into two parts; the [[Workbench (AmigaOS)|Workbench]] and the [[Kickstart (Amiga)|Kickstart]]. ===Workbench=== The [[Workbench (AmigaOS)|Workbench]] is the GUI of OS4, a graphical interface file manager and application launcher for the Operating System. It also includes some general purpose tools and utility programs such as a Notepad for typing text, MultiView for viewing images and [[Amigaguide]] documents, Unarc for unpacking Archives, a PDF reader, a number of small preferences programs for changing settings of the GUI and OS etc., etc. ===Kickstart=== The [[Kickstart (Amiga)|Kickstart]] contains many of the core components of the OS. Prior to version 4 of AmigaOS the Kickstart had been released mostly on a [[Read-only memory|ROM]] (included with the computer). In OS4 the Kickstart is instead stored on the hard disk. It consists mainly of: * [[Exec (Amiga)|Exec]], a preemptive multitasking kernel. * [[Intuition (Amiga)|Intuition]], a windowing system API. * [[AmigaDOS]] and AmigaShell, the AmigaDOS is the disk operating system for the OS, whereas the Shell is the integrated Command Line Interface (CLI). The CLI and the GUI complement each other and share the same privileges. * [[Petunia JIT|Petunia]], a Motorola 68020 processor emulator with dynamic recompilation, also called just-in-time compilation ([[Just-in-time compilation|JIT]] compilation), for PowerPC based Amigas. It gives OS4 backward compatibility to some extent, it will only run system friendly (following the OS3.x API without communicating directly with the classic Amigas' [[Amiga#Hardware|custom chipset]]) AmigaOS 3.x programs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.amiga.hu/amigos/rachy/petunia.html |title=Project Petunia |publisher=Almos Rajnai |date=2006-12-30 |accessdate=2010-11-10}}</ref> For the programs that Petunia can't handle, such as most "bang the hardware" (which uses legacy Amiga hardware directly) Amiga [[Amiga games|games]] and [[Amiga demos|demos]], the third party OS4 native emulator [[E-UAE]] can be used which can emulate different Amiga chipsets (OCS, ECS, AGA) as well. ==History== {{Main|History of the AmigaOS 4 dispute}} During the five years of development, users of [[AmigaOne]] machines could download Pre-Release versions of AmigaOS 4.0 from Hyperion's repository as long as these were made available. As witnessed by many users on Amiga discussion forum sites, these versions were stable and reliable, despite the fact that they were technically labeled as "Pre-Releases".
