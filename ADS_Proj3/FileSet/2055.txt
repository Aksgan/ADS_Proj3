Micro ribbon connectors have a D-shaped metal shell, but are larger than [[D-subminiature]] connectors. They are sometimes called "Centronics connectors" after the 36-pin [[micro ribbon]] connector [[Centronics]] used for their printers. One unusual feature of IEEE-488 connectors is they commonly use a "double-headed" design, with male on one side, and female on the other (at both ends of the cable). This allows stacking connectors for easy [[daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy-chaining]]. Mechanical considerations limit the number of stacked connectors to four or fewer, although a possible workaround involving physically supporting the connectors can expand this. They are held in place by screws, either [[Unified Thread Standard|UTS]] (now largely obsolete) or [[ISO metric screw thread|metric]] M3.5×0.6 [[screw thread|thread]]s. By convention, metric screws are colored black, as the two threads do not mate. ===IEC-60625=== The IEC-60625 standard prescribes the use of 25-pin [[D-subminiature]] connectors (the same as used for the [[parallel port]] on [[IBM PC compatible|IBM-PC]]s). This connector did not gain significant market acceptance against the established 24-pin connector. ==Origins== In the late 1960s, [[Hewlett-Packard|Hewlett-Packard (HP)]]<ref>This part of HP was later spun off as [[Agilent Technologies]].</ref> was manufacturing various automated test and measurement instruments, such as digital [[multimeter]]s and [[logic analyzer]]s. They developed the ''HP Interface Bus (HP-IB)'' to enable easier interconnection between instruments and controllers (computers and other instruments). The bus was relatively easy to implement using the technology at the time, using a simple parallel [[electrical bus]] and several individual control lines. For example, the HP 59501 Power Supply Programmer and HP 59306A Relay Actuator were both relatively simple HP-IB peripherals implemented only in [[Transistor–transistor logic|TTL]] logic, using no microprocessor. Other manufacturers copied HP-IB, calling their implementation the General Purpose Interface Bus (GPIB), and it became a [[de facto standard]] for automated and industrial instrument control. As GPIB became popular, it was formalized by various [[standards organization]]s. ==Standards== In 1975, the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] standardized the bus as ''Standard Digital Interface for Programmable Instrumentation'', '''IEEE-488''' (now IEEE-488.1). It formalized the mechanical, electrical, and basic protocol parameters of GPIB, but said nothing about the format of commands or data. In 1987, IEEE introduced ''Standard Codes, Formats, Protocols, and Common Commands'', '''IEEE-488.2''', re-designating the previous specification as '''IEEE-488.1'''. IEEE-488.2 provided for basic syntax and format conventions, as well as device-independent commands, data structures, error protocols, and the like. IEEE-488.2 built on -488.1 without superseding it; equipment can conform to -488.1 without following -488.2. While IEEE-488.1 defined the hardware, and IEEE-488.2 defined the protocol, there was still no standard for instrument-specific commands. Commands to control the same class of instrument (e.g., multimeters) would vary between manufacturers and even models. The Air Force<ref>Project Mate in 1985</ref> and later Hewlett-Packard recognized this problem. In 1989, HP developed their TML language<ref>{{cite web |title=GPIB 101, A Tutorial of the GPIB Bus |publisher=ICS Electronics |url=http://www.icselect.com/ab_note.html#anchor338658 |page=5, paragraph=SCPI Commands }}</ref> which was the forerunner to SCPI [[Standard Commands for Programmable Instrumentation]]. SCPI was introduced as an industry standard in 1990.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of GPIB |publisher=National Instruments |url=http://zone.ni.com/devzone/cda/tut/p/id/3419 |quote=In 1990, the IEEE 488.2 specification included the Standard Commands for Programmable Instrumentation (SCPI) document. |accessdate=2010-02-06 }}</ref> SCPI added standard generic commands, and a series of instrument classes with corresponding class-specific commands. SCPI mandated the IEEE-488.2 syntax, but allowed other (non-IEEE-488.1) physical transports. The [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] developed their own standards in parallel with the IEEE, with '''IEC-60625-1''' and '''IEC-60625-2''', later replaced by IEC-60488. [[National Instruments]] introduced a backwards-compatible extension to IEEE-488.1, originally known as '''HS-488'''. It increased the maximum data rate to 8 [[megabyte|Mbyte]]/s, although the rate decreases as more devices are connected to the bus. This was incorporated into the standard in 2003 (IEEE-488.1-2003),<ref>{{Cite web |title=Upgraded Standard Boosts Speed of IEEE 488 Instrument Buses Eightfold |date=6 October 2003 |publisher=IEEE |url=http://standards.ieee.org/announcements/pr_4881upgrade.html |accessdate=2010-02-06 }} </ref> over HP's objections.<ref>{{Cite press release |title=HP and Other Test and Measurement Companies Urge IEEE to Oppose Revisions of Established IEEE-488 Standard |publisher=Hewlett-Packard Company |date=December 1997 |url=http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/imstc8/488/1/hppress12-97.html |accessdate=2010-02-16 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=P488.1 Project Home |publisher=IEEE |url=http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/imstc8/488/1/ |accessdate=2010-02-16 }}</ref> In 2004, the IEEE and IEC combined their respective standards into a "Dual Logo" IEEE/IEC standard '''IEC-60488-1''', ''Standard for Higher Performance Protocol for the Standard Digital Interface for Programmable Instrumentation - Part 1: General'',<ref>{{cite web |title=IEC/IEEE Standard for Higher Performance Protocol for the Standard Digital Interface for Programmable Instrumentation - Part 1: General (Adoption of IEEE Std 488.1-2003) |publisher=IEEE |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?tp=&isnumber=30476&arnumber=1405845&punumber=9646 |accessdate=2010-02-06 }}</ref> replaces IEEE-488.1/IEC-60625-1, and '''IEC-60488-2''', ''Part 2: Codes, Formats, Protocols and Common Commands'',<ref>{{cite web |title=Standard Digital Interface for Programmable Instrumentation - Part 2: Codes, Formats, Protocols and Common Commands (Adoption of (IEEE Std 488.2-1992) |publisher=IEEE |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?tp=&isnumber=29721&arnumber=1352831&punumber=9359 |accessdate=2010-02-06 }}</ref> replaces IEEE-488.2/IEC-60625-2.<ref>{{cite web |title=Replaced or Withdrawn Publications |url=http://www.iec.ch/cgi-bin/procgi.pl/www/iecwww.p?header=IEC&search=replaced&wwwprog=sea22.p |publisher=IEC |accessdate=2010-02-06 }}</ref> ==Capabilities== {| class="wikitable" |- !
