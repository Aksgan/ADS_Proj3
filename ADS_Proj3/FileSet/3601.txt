of a circle of unit diameter" (Hardy and Wright p. 176) A [[Euclidean number]] is one which can be constructed by use of a straight-edge and compass. (Hardy and Wright p. 159). Irrational numbers can be Euclidean. A good example is the irrational number: square-root of 2. It is simply the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle. We can produce this length as follows: : With the straight-edge draw a line : Bisect it with the compass : Draw the perpendicular through the line : With the straight edge draw a "unit distance" : Use the compass to span (measure) the unit distance : Span (measure), on each "leg" of the right angle, the "unit distance" : Draw the hypotenuse through these end-points The hypotenuse has the length square-root of 2 (times the unit distance) A proof exists to demonstrate that any Euclidean number is an algebraic number. Therefore, because pi is a transcendental number then, by definition, it is not an algebraic number, and therefore it is not a Euclidean number as well. Thus the construction of a pi-length from a unit circle is impossible. [Hardy and Wright p. 159 reference E. Hecke ''Vorlesungen über die Theorie der algebraischen Zahlen'' (Leipzig, Akademische Verlagsgesellschaft, 1923]. == Euclid's parallel axiom == Nagel and Newman consider the question raised by the [[parallel postulate]] to be "...perhaps the most significant development in its long-range effects upon subsequent mathematical history" (p. 9). The question is: can the axiom that two parallel lines "...will not meet even 'at infinity'" (footnote, ibid) be derived from the other axioms of Euclid's geometry? It was not until work in the nineteenth century by "... Gauss, Bolyai, Lobachevsky, and Riemann, that the impossibility of deducing the parallel axiom from the others was demonstrated. This outcome was of the greatest intellectual importance. ...a ''proof'' can be given of the ''impossibility of proving'' certain propositions within a given system" (p. 10). To clarify: Nage and Newman mean "the proposition" to be the statement "Parallel lines will not meet at infinity" and "the given system" is Euclid's axioms of geometry. The proof showed that no proof exists; i.e. "a proof" is impossible. == Richard's paradox == This profound paradox presented by Jules Richard in 1905 informed the work of Kurt Gödel (cf Nagel and Newman p. 60ff) and Alan Turing. A succinct definition is found in ''Principia Mathematica'': :"Richard's paradox... is as follows. Consider all decimals that can be defined by means of a '''finite number of''' '''''words''''' [boldface added for emphasis, "words" are symbols]; let E be the class of such decimals. Then E has [aleph-sub-zero-- an infinity of] terms; hence its members can be ordered as the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ... Let N be a number defined as follows [Whitehead & Russell now employ the Cantor diagonal method]; If the ''n''th figure in the ''n''th decimal is ''p'', let the ''n''th figure in N be ''p''+1 (or 0, if ''p'' = 9). Then N is different from all the members of E, since, whatever finite value ''n'' may have, the ''n''th figure in N is different from the ''n''th figure in the ''n''th of the decimals composing E, and therefore N is different from the ''n''th decimal. Nevertheless we have defined N in a finite number of words [i.e. this very word-definition just above!] and therefore N ought to be a member of E. Thus N both is and is not a member of E" (''Principia Mathematica'', 2nd edition 1927, p. 61). Kurt Gödel considered his proof to be "an analogy" of Richard's paradox (he called it "Richard's antinomy") (Gödel in Undecidable, p. 9). See more below about Gödel's proof. Alan [[Turing]] constructed this paradox with a machine and proved that this machine could not answer a simple question: will this machine be able to determine if any machine (including itself) will become trapped in an unproductive "infinite loop" (i.e. it fails to continue its computation of the diagonal number). == Can this proof be "decided" on the basis of the axioms? Gödel's proof == To quote Nagel and Newman (p. 68), “Gödel’s paper is difficult. Forty-six preliminary definitions, together with several important preliminary theorems, must be mastered before the main results are reached” (p. 68). In fact, Nagel and Newman required a 67-page introduction to their exposition of the proof. But if the reader feels strong enough to tackle the paper, Martin Davis observes that “This remarkable paper is not only an intellectual landmark, but is written with a clarity and vigor that makes it a pleasure to read” (Davis in Undecidable, p. 4). It is recommended{{By whom|date=August 2010}} that most readers see Nagel and Newman first. So what did Gödel prove? In his own words: : “It is reasonable… to make the conjecture that ...[the] axioms [from [[Principia Mathematica]] and [[Peano]] ] are ... sufficient to decide all mathematical questions which can be formally expressed in the given systems. In what follows it will be shown that this is not the case, but rather that ... there exist relatively simple problems of the theory of ordinary whole numbers which cannot be decided on the basis of the axioms” (Gödel in Undecidable, p. 4). Gödel compared his proof to “Richard’s antinomy” (an "[[antinomy]]" is a contradiction or a paradox; for more see [[Richard's paradox]]): : “The analogy of this result with Richard’s antinomy is immediately evident; there is also a close relationship [14] with the [[Liar Paradox]] (Gödel's footnote 14: Every [[epistemological]] antinomy can be used for a similar proof of undecidability)... Thus we have a proposition before us which asserts its own unprovability [15]. (His footnote 15: Contrary to appearances, such a proposition is not circular, for, to begin with, it asserts the unprovability of a quite definite formula)" (Gödel in Undecidable, p.9). == Will this computing machine lock in a "circle"? Turing's first proof == * The ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'', the [[decision problem]], was first answered by Church in April 1935 and preempted Turing by over a
