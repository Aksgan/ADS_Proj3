theory. The claim that it completely explains evolution is of course a bold claim, and very far from being established. All scientific theories are conjectures, even those that have successfully passed many severe and varied tests. The Mendelian underpinning of modern Darwinism has been well tested, and so has the theory of evolution which says that all terrestrial life has evolved from a few primitive unicellular organisms, possibly even from one single organism.<ref name="popper_on_natural_selection"/>}} He explained that the difficulty of testing had led some people to describe natural selection as a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]], and that he too had in the past described the theory as 'almost tautological', and had tried to explain how the theory could be untestable (as is a tautology) and yet of great scientific interest. His {{quote|solution was that the doctrine of natural selection is a most successful metaphysical research programme. It raises detailed problems in many fields, and it tells us what we would expect of an acceptable solution of these problems. I still believe that natural selection works in this way as a research programme. Nevertheless, I have changed my mind about the testability and logical status of the theory of natural selection; and I am glad to have an opportunity to make a recantation.<ref name="popper_on_natural_selection"/>}} Popper summarized his new view as follows: {{quote|The theory of natural selection may be so formulated that it is far from tautological. In this case it is not only testable, but it turns out to be not strictly universally true. There seem to be exceptions, as with so many biological theories; and considering the random character of the variations on which natural selection operates, the occurrence of exceptions is not surprising. Thus not all phenomena of evolution are explained by natural selection alone. Yet in every particular case it is a challenging research program to show how far natural selection can possibly be held responsible for the evolution of a particular organ or behavioral program.<ref> Karl Popper in ''Evolutionary epistemology, rationality, and the sociology of knowledge'' by Radnitzky, Bartley and Popper, pp. 144-145, accessible at [http://books.google.com/books?id=QnFiTrCzg5oC&pg=PA145&dq=The+theory+of+natural+selection+may+so+be+formulated+that+is+far+from+tautological.+In+this+case+it+is+not+only+testable,+but+it+turns+out+to+be+not+strictly+universally+true.+There+seems+to+be+exceptions&hl=en&ei=6I8kTZOgEIPCcfHx6LkB&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=The%20theory%20of%20natural%20selection%20may%20so%20be%20formulated%20that%20is%20far%20from%20tautological.%20In%20this%20case%20it%20is%20not%20only%20testable%2C%20but%20it%20turns%20out%20to%20be%20not%20strictly%20universally%20true.%20There%20seems%20to%20be%20exceptions&f=false]</ref> }} == Influence == [[File:Karl Popper2.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Karl Popper in 1990.]] Popper played a vital role in establishing the [[philosophy of science]] as a vigorous, autonomous discipline within [[analytic philosophy]], through his own prolific and influential works, and also through his influence on his own contemporaries and students. Popper founded in 1946 the Department of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method at the [[London School of Economics]] and there lectured and influenced both [[Imre Lakatos]] and [[Paul Feyerabend]], two of the foremost philosophers of science in the next generation of philosophy of science. (Lakatos significantly modified Popper's position, and Feyerabend repudiated it entirely, but the work of both is deeply influenced by Popper and engaged with many of the problems that Popper set.) While there is some dispute as to the matter of influence, Popper had a long-standing and close friendship with economist [[Friedrich Hayek]], who was also brought to the London School of Economics from Vienna. Each found support and similarities in each other's work, citing each other often, though not without qualification. In a letter to Hayek in 1944, Popper stated, "I think I have learnt more from you than from any other living thinker, except perhaps [[Alfred Tarski]]."<ref>Hacohen, 2000</ref> Popper dedicated his ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]'' to Hayek. For his part, Hayek dedicated a collection of papers, ''Studies in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics'', to Popper, and in 1982 said, "...ever since his ''Logik der Forschung'' first came out in 1934, I have been a complete adherent to his general theory of methodology."<ref>Weimer and Palermo, 1982</ref> Popper also had long and mutually influential friendships with art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]], biologist [[Peter Medawar]], and neuro-scientist [[John Carew Eccles]]. Popper's influence, both through his work in philosophy of science and through his political philosophy, has also extended beyond the academy. Among Popper's students and advocates at the London School of Economics is the billionaire investor [[George Soros]], who says his investment strategies are modelled on Popper's understanding of the advancement of knowledge through the distinctly [[Hegelian]] idea of [[falsifiability|falsification]]. Among Soros's [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] foundations is the [[Open Society Institute]], a think-tank named in honour of Popper's ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', which Soros founded to advance the Popperian defense of the [[open society]] against [[authoritarianism]] and [[totalitarianism]]. Popperian philosophy also inspired the creation of [[Taking Children Seriously]], a libertarian movement which noticed that Popper's general theory of knowledge creation does not differentiate between adults and children. == Criticism == === Criticism of his philosophy of science === Most criticisms of Popper's philosophy are of the falsification, or error elimination, element in his account of problem solving. In interpreting these, it is important to bear in mind the aims of his idea. It is intended as an ideal, practical method of effective human problem solving; as such, the current conclusions of science are stronger than pseudo-sciences or non-sciences, insofar as they have survived this particularly vigorous selection method. He does not argue that any such conclusions are therefore true, or that this describes the actual methods of any particular scientist. Rather, it is a recommended ideal method that, if enacted by a system or community, will over time lead to slow but steady progress of a sort (relative to how well the system or community enacts the method). It has been suggested that Popper's ideas are often mistaken for a hard logical account of truth because of the historical co-incidence of their appearing at the same time as [[logical positivism]], the followers of which mistook his aims for their own.<ref>Bryan Magee 1973: Popper (Modern Masters series)</ref> The [[confirmation holism|Quine-Duhem thesis]] argues that it's impossible to test a single hypothesis on its own, since each one comes as part of an environment of theories. Thus we can only say that the whole package of relevant theories has been collectively falsified, but cannot conclusively say which element of the package must be replaced. An example of this is given by
