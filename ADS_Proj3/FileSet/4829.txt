= | extended from = | extended to = | standard = }} '''Windows Media Video''' ('''WMV''') is a video [[Data compression|compression]] [[format]] for several [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[codecs]] developed by [[Microsoft]]. The original video format, known as ''WMV'', was originally designed for Internet streaming applications, as a competitor to [[RealVideo]]. The other formats, such as ''WMV Screen'' and ''WMV Image'', cater for specialized content. Through standardization from the [[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers]] (SMPTE),<ref name="mssmpte">[http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/apr06/04-24VC1PR.mspx SMPTE VC-1 Receiving Industrywide Support]</ref><ref name="netanewssmpte">[http://www.betanews.com/article/Microsoft_VC1_Codec_Now_a_Standard/1144097224 Microsoft VC-1 Codec Now a Standard]</ref> WMV 9 has gained adoption for physical-delivery formats such as [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]].<ref name="bluray">[http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2004/sep04/09-01BluRayDiscPR.mspx Blu-ray Disc BD-ROM Specification Adds Microsoft's VC-1 Advanced Video Codec]</ref><ref name="hddvd">[http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2007/jan07/01-08HDDVDMomentumPR.mspx Microsoft Technology Brings HD DVD to the Mainstream]</ref> ==History== In 2003, Microsoft drafted a video codec specification based on its WMV 9 codec and submitted it to SMPTE for standardization. The standard was officially approved in March 2006 as SMPTE 421M, better known as [[VC-1]], thus making the WMV 9 format an open standard. Since then, VC-1 has become one of the three mandatory video formats for the [[BD-ROM]] specifications.<ref name="bluray" /><ref name="hddvd" /> ==Container format== {{Main|Advanced Systems Format}} A ''WMV file'' is in most circumstances [[data encapsulation|encapsulated]] in the [[Advanced Systems Format]] (ASF) [[Container format (digital)|container format]].<ref name="asfwma">[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/284094 MSDN: The Difference Between ASF and WMV/WMA Files]</ref> The [[file extension]] <tt>.WMV</tt> typically describes ASF files that use Windows Media Video codecs. The audio codec used in conjunction with Windows Media Video is typically some version of [[Windows Media Audio]], or in rarer cases, the deprecated Sipro [[ACELP|ACELP.net]] audio codec. Microsoft recommends that ASF files containing non-Windows Media codecs use the generic <tt>.ASF</tt> file extension. The ASF container can optionally support [[digital rights management]] using a combination of [[elliptic curve cryptography]] key exchange, [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] block cipher, a custom block cipher, [[RC4 cipher|RC4]] stream cipher and the [[SHA-1]] hashing function. Although WMV is generally packed into the ASF container format, it can also be put into the [[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]] or [[Matroska]] container format. The resulting files have the <tt>.AVI</tt> and <tt>.MKV</tt> file extensions, respectively. WMV can be stored in an AVI file when using the WMV 9 [[Video for Windows|Video Compression Manager (VCM)]] codec implementation.<ref>Microsoft Corporation (2003-07-07) [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0c99c648-5800-4aa3-a2fe-3de948689db8&DisplayLang=en Windows Media Video 9 VCM], Retrieved on 2009-08-07</ref><ref name="vcm">[http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/forpros/codecs/video.aspx#WindowsMediaVideo9VCM Windows Media Video 9 Series Codecs: Windows Media Video 9 VCM]</ref> Another common way to store WMV in an AVI file is to use the [[VirtualDub]] encoder. ==Video compression formats== ===Windows Media Video=== [[Image:Common Video Resolutions 2.svg|thumb|Diagram illustrating the relative frame sizes of several common video resolutions targeted by Windows Media Video 9 Professional, starting with [[480p]].]] Windows Media Video (WMV) is the most recognized [[video format]] within the WMV family. Usage of the term ''WMV'' often refers to the Microsoft Windows Media Video [[codec]] only. Its main competitors are [[MPEG-4 AVC]], [[Audio Video Standard|AVS]], [[RealVideo]], and [[MPEG-4 Part 2|MPEG-4 ASP]]. The first version of the codec, WMV 7, was introduced in 1999, and was built upon Microsoft's implementation of [[MPEG-4 Part 2]].<ref name="mpeg4wmv"> [http://digitalcontentproducer.com/mag/video_mpeg_makes_scene/ MPEG-4 makes the scene]</ref> Continued proprietary development led to newer versions of the codec, but the [[bit stream]] syntax was not frozen until WMV 9.<ref name="wmav9series">[http://download.microsoft.com/download/6/f/c/6fc03c60-5d5b-42c0-bcce-5e184fa56741/2_Audio_Video.ppt Windows Media Audio & Video 9 Series]</ref> While all versions of WMV support [[variable bit rate]], [[average bit rate]], and [[constant bit rate]], WMV 9 introduced several important features including native support for [[interlaced video]], non-square [[pixels]], and frame interpolation.<ref name="videoquality">[http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/demos/video_quality_demos.aspx Microsoft Windows Media - Demos Video Quality]</ref> WMV 9 also introduced a new profile titled ''Windows Media Video 9 Professional'',<ref name="elimsrevguide">[http://www.elims.org/downloads/sample_content/9Series_RevGuide.pdf Windows Media 9 Series Beta Reviewer's Guide]</ref> which is activated automatically whenever the video resolution exceeds 300,000 pixels (e.g., 528x576, 640Ã—480 or 768x432 and beyond) and the bitrate 1000 kbit/s{{Citation needed|reason=where did this info come from, and why such a wierd example rez originally? it's not anywhere in the linked document(s)|date=July 2009}}. It is targeted towards high-definition video content, at resolutions such as [[720p]] and [[1080p]]2. The ''Simple'' and ''Main'' profile levels in WMV 9 are compliant with the same profile levels in the [[VC-1]] specification.<ref name="advancedprofile">[http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/howto/articles/codecadvancedsettings.aspx Using the Advanced Settings of the Windows Media Video 9 Advanced Profile Codec]</ref> The ''Advanced Profile'' in VC-1 is implemented in a new WMV codec called ''Windows Media Video 9 Advanced Profile''. It improves compressions efficiency for interlaced content and is made transport-independent, making it able to be encapsulated in an [[MPEG transport stream]] or [[Real-time Transport Protocol|RTP]] packet format. The codec is not compatible with previous WMV 9 codecs, however.<ref name="streamingmedia">[http://www.streamingmedia.com/article.asp?id=9510&page=2&c=4 streamingmedia.com Best Practices for Windows Media Encoding]</ref> WMV is a mandatory video codec for [[PlaysForSure]]-certified online stores and devices, as well as [[Portable Media Center]] devices.

It can capture live screen content, or convert video from third-party screen-capture programs into WMV 9 Screen files. It works best when the source material is mainly static and contains a small [[color palette]].<ref name="screen">[http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/forpros/codecs/video.aspx#WindowsMediaVideo9Screen Windows Media Video 9 Series Codecs: Windows Media Video 9 Screen]</ref> Depending on the complexity of the source material, the codec may switch between [[Lossy data compression|lossy]] and [[Lossless data compression|lossless]] encoding to enhance compression efficiency.<ref name="screen"/> One of the uses for the codec is computer step-by-step demonstration videos. The first version of the codec was WMV 7 Screen, The second and current version, WMV 9 Screen, supports VBR encoding in addition to CBR.<ref name="screen" /> ===Windows Media Video Image=== <!-- Image with
