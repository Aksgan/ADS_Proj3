Invisible ink is one form of [[steganography]] and it has been used in [[espionage]]. Other uses include anti-[[counterfeit]]ing, property marking, hand stamping for readmission, children's games, and marking for the purpose of identification in manufacturing. ==Application and use== {{Howto|section|date=January 2011}} Invisible ink is applied to a writing surface with a specialty purpose [[stylus]], [[Rubber stamp|stamp]], [[fountain pen]], [[toothpick]] or even a finger dipped in the liquid. Once dry the written surface should appear blank, and of a similar texture and reflectivity as the surrounding surface. With letters, a cover message should be written over the invisible message, as a blank sheet of paper might arouse suspicion that an invisible message is present. This is best done with a ballpoint pen, since fountain pen ink may 'run' when it crosses a line of invisible ink, thus betraying the presence of invisible ink. Invisible ink should not be used on ruled paper as it may similarly alter or streak the colour of the lines. The ink is later made visible by different methods according to the type of invisible ink used. The ink may be developed by heat or by application of an appropriate chemical, or it may be made visible by viewing under [[ultraviolet light]]. Inks which are developed by a [[chemical reaction]] may depend on an [[acid-base reaction]] (like [[litmus paper]]), reactions similar to the [[blueprint]] process, or any of hundreds of others. Developer fluids may be applied using a spray bottle, but some developers are in the form of vapours, e.g. [[ammonia]] fumes used to develop [[phenolphthalein]] ink. One can obtain toy invisible ink pens which have two tips—one tip for invisible ink writing, and another tip for developing the ink. Also, invisible ink is sometimes used to print parts of pictures or text in [[book]]s for children to play with, particularly while they are travelling. A "[[decoder pen]]" is included with these books and children may rub this pen over invisible parts of texts or pictures, thus revealing answers to questions printed in regular ink or completing missing parts of pictures. [[Security]] [[marker pen]]s or [[UV Marker]]s with fluorescent ink that glows when illuminated with a UV light may be used to invisibly mark valuable household items in case of [[burglary]]. They may be especially formulated for writing on non-porous surfaces such as glass, plastics, etc. The inks are applied and then identified using a black light or other UV light source. The owner of a recovered, stolen item which has been marked in this way can be traced simply by using an ultraviolet lamp. Security marker pens can be obtained commercially and are widely used as a crime countermeasure. Some commercially available invisible inks glow very brightly, in a variety of colours, under UV light. This makes them suitable for use in readmissions such as hand stamping. There is a commercially available red invisible ink which is only invisible when applied to certain types of surfaces, but visible on others. Some vendors now offer invisible ink for use in computer [[inkjet printer]]s. [http://www.hsautomatic.com/index.php?id=135] Such inks are usually visible under ultraviolet light. Typical uses include printing information on business forms for use by the form processor, without cluttering up the visible contents of the form. For example, some [[United States Postal Service]] mail sorting stations use UV-visible ink to print bar codes on mailed envelopes giving routing information for use by mail handling equipment further down the line before delivery. Very rarely, invisible ink has been used in art. It is usually developed, though not always. There are artists who use the effect in conjunction with invisible and other reactive inks and paints to create a variety of effects when used in conjunction with UV lights. A non-toxic, full color invisible ink jet ink set has been developed by Vermont PhotoInkjet, LLC which is marketed under the Firefly™ brand. It has been pre-packaged for Epson printers. [http://www.firefly-ink.com] A creativity software has been developed by Vermont PhotoInkjet which allows both experienced and inexperienced computer artists to create artistic expressions which can only be seen under [[black light]]. An [[End-to-end auditable voting systems|E2E]] voting system called [[Scantegrity II]] uses invisible ink to enable the voter to obtain a confirmation code only for the voted selection.<ref>{{cite journal | last =Chaum | first =David | authorlink =David_Chaum | coauthors =Richard Carback, Jeremy Clark, Aleksander Essex, Stefan Popoveniuc, Ronald L.

For example, property marking should ideally be done with ink easily read under ultraviolet light, whereas in espionage such an ink would be considered too easily detectable since a large number of letters may be screened relatively quickly using UV light. Invisible inks are inherently "insecure" against a determined and well-equipped inspector, which must be balanced against the logistical difficulty in carrying out mass-screening of posted mail. It is easier to perform [[ECHELON|large-scale]] undetected screening of millions of electronic communications, than to mass-screen even a small fraction of conventional mail. Apart from in dictatorships where large numbers of personnel are employed to spy on fellow nationals, screening of posted mail is only feasible in particular situations, such as letters to and from a particular suspect or facility. The World War II [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] training manual identified the following properties of an "ideal" invisible ink: # Very water soluble, i.e. non-greasy. # Non-volatile, i.e. no pronounced smell. # Not depositing crystals on paper, i.e. not easily seen in glancing light. # Invisible under ultraviolet light. # Does not decompose or discolour the paper e.g. not [[silver nitrate]]. # Unreactive with iodine, or with any of the other usual developers. # Potential developers for the ink should be as few as possible. # Should not develop
