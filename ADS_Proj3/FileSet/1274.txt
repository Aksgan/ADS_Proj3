maintainers do not appear to monitor FreeBSD or KAME for security or stability updates, but rather rely on minimal and insufficient bug reports from users of eCos. The [[SNMP]] package is rudimentary at best, once again, apparently due to its age. ==See also== {{Portal|Free software}} *[[List of real-time operating systems]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://ecos.sourceware.org/ eCos Homepage] * [http://www.embedded.com/story/OEG20011220S0059 "eCos Porting Guide"] article by Anthony J.

The database is freely available to the public via the Internet (Web or FTP). The EDGAR system typically receives in excess of 3,000 filings per day. == Filings == Not all [[SEC filing]]s by [[public companies]] are available on EDGAR. Companies were phased in to EDGAR filing over a three-year period, ending 6 May 1996. As of that date, all public domestic companies were required to submit their filings via EDGAR, except for hardcopy paper filings, which were allowed under a [[hardship exemption]]. Third-party filings with respect to these companies, such as [[tender offer]]s and [[Schedule 13D]] filings, are also filed via EDGAR. The vast majority of documents are now filed electronically. As of 4 November 2002, the SEC required all foreign companies and foreign governments to file their documents via EDGAR. Prior to that time, electronic filing by foreign companies also was voluntary. Actual [[annual report]]s to shareholders (except in the case of [[mutual fund]] companies) need not be submitted on EDGAR, although some companies do so voluntarily. However, the annual report on [[Form 10-K]] or Form 10-KSB, which contains much of the same information, is required to be filed on EDGAR. ==See also== * [[Central Index Key]] * [[SEDAR]], [[Canada]]'s equivalent to EDGAR * [[Electronic Municipal Market Access]] system (EMMA), providing disclosure information for the municipal securities market * [[EDGAR Online]] A U.S. public company that provides access to EDGAR data ==External links== [http://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml EDGAR website] [http://www.sec.gov/info/edgar/regoverview.htm Outline of EDGAR Rules from the SEC] [http://www.globalinv.com/Sep1-08abstract.htm "SEC to Replace EDGAR System With New IDEA," Global Investment Technology, Sept. 1, 2008] [http://onthemedia.org/transcripts/2010/07/23/03 Interview with Carl Malamud on the origins of EDGAR, overcoming SEC resistance, July 23, 2010] [[Category:United States Securities and Exchange Commission]] [[Category:Government databases in the United States]] [[fr:Electronic Data-Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval]] [[ja:EDGAR]]</text> </page> <page> <id>11383</id> <title>EDOS</title> <text>'''EDOS''' was an [[operating system]] based upon IBM's original DOS. The name stood for <u>e</u>xtended (or <u>e</u>nhanced) <u>d</u>isk <u>o</u>perating <u>s</u>ystem. ==EDOS== In 1970, [[IBM]] announced the IBM/370 product line along with new peripherals, software products, and operating systems, including [[DOS/VS]] that supplanted [[DOS]]. Although IBM was rightly focused on their new products, the computing world was dominated by the IBM/360 line, which left a lot of users nervous about their investment. Although there were a couple of projects emulating the [[IBM/370]] on the [[IBM/360]] (e.g., CFS, Inc.), a couple of companies took a different approach, extending the then-current (and limited) DOS. The Computer Software Company took the latter approach. Starting in 1972, they developed '''EDOS''', Extended Disk Operating System. They extended the number of fixed program space partitions from 3 to 6, added support for new hardware, and included features that IBM had offered separately. They also made available other third party enhancements such as a [[spooler]] and [[DOCS (software)|DOCS]], from CFS, Inc. ==TCSC== '''The Computer Software Company''' was founded by Jerry Enfield and Tom Steel, responsible for development and marketing, respectively. Company headquarters were in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. TCSC, as it was called, expanded into [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and [[Europe]].<ref>[http://itug-connection.blogspot.com/ article]</ref> The company was later acquired by [[Nixdorf]]. ==References== <references /> {{software distribution}} {{Software Engineering}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Edos}} [[Category:Disk operating systems]]</text> </page> <page> <id>11384</id> <title>EDRAM</title> <text>{{lowercase}} {{Refimprove|date=February 2008}} {{Memory types}} '''eDRAM''' stands for "[[embedded system|embedded]] [[Dynamic Random Access Memory|DRAM]]", a [[capacitor]]-based [[dynamic random access memory]] integrated on the same [[die (integrated circuit)|die]] as an [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] or [[Microprocessor|processor]]. The cost-per-bit is higher than for stand-alone DRAM chips but in many applications the performance advantages of placing the eDRAM on the same chip as the processor outweighs the cost disadvantage compared with external memory. Embedding memory on the ASIC or processor allows for much wider [[computer bus|bus]]ses and higher operation speeds, and due to much higher density of DRAM in comparison to [[static random access memory|SRAM]], larger amounts of memory can be installed on smaller chips if eDRAM is used instead of eSRAM. eDRAM requires additional fab process steps compared with embedded SRAM, which raises cost, but the 3X area savings of eDRAM memory offsets the process cost when a significant amount of memory is used in the design. eDRAM memories, like all DRAM memories, require periodic refreshing of the memory cells, which adds complexity. However if the memory refresh controller is embedded along with the eDRAM memory, the remainder of the ASIC can treat the memory like a simple SRAM type such as in [[1T-SRAM]]. eDRAM is used in IBM's [[POWER7]] processor<ref name="Realworldtech">{{cite web |title=Hot Chips XXI Preview |publisher=[http://www.realworldtech.com/ Real World Technologies] |url=http://realworldtech.com/page.cfm?ArticleID=RWT081209143650&p=2 |accessdate=2009-08-17 }}</ref> and in many [[game console]]s and other devices, including [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation 2]], Sony's [[PlayStation Portable]], [[Nintendo]]'s [[GameCube]], Nintendo's [[Wii]], [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[iPhone]], [[Microsoft]]'s [[Zune HD]], and Microsoft's [[Xbox 360]]. ==External links== * http://www.cs.unc.edu/~jp/DRAM.pdf * [http://www.eetimes.com/story/OEG20030414S0040 Day dawns for eDRAM] * http://www.necelam.com/edram90/ * http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3751/is_200501/ai_n9521086 * http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070214-8842.html * http://www.allbusiness.com/electronics/computer-electronics-manufacturing/6302349-1.html ===News=== * [http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=197006869 IBM eDram] - Accessed Feb 17, 2007 {{compu-hardware-stub}} ==References== <references/> [[Category:Computer memory|EDRAM]] [[ar:ذاكرة الوصول العشوائي الديناميكية المضمنة]] [[de:EDRAM]] [[ko:EDRAM]] [[fr:EDRAM]] [[ja:EDRAM]] [[ru:EDRAM]] [[sv:EDRAM]] [[uk:EDRAM]]</text> </page> <page> <id>11396</id> <title>EFIKA</title> <text>[[Image:Efika 5200B DSCF0179.JPG|thumb|right|300px|EFIKA 2.3 and ATI Radeon 9250 with 128 bits and 256 MB]] '''EFIKA''' are a line of thin computing [[Power Architecture]] and [[ARM architecture|ARM]] based computers
