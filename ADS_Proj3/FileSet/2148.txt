The term was coined in a ''[[TIME Magazine]]'' article called "The Infoanarchist" in July 2000. The article was about [[Ian Clarke (computer scientist)|Ian Clarke]], known as the original designer and lead developer of [[Freenet]]. The [[anti-copyright]] movement includes a wide range of groups and views. Infoanarchists have emerged as part of the broader [[copyright social conflict]] and [[copyright]] debate. Infoanarchists may use [[anonymous P2P]] networks, like [[Freenet]], [[Entropy (anonymous data store)|Entropy]], [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] or [[I2P]], to help protect their anonymity. These anonymous networks make it difficult for observers, or any middleman, to determine what traffic is going across the network. Such technology may serve to protect people who wish to publish or receive digital files anonymously, like corporate whistleblowers, political dissidents, or groups that engage in the deliberate infringement of copyright law. <!-- why is this paragraph relevant? they may also drive cars as well as use Tor! --> ==See also== * [[Wikileaks]] * [[copyleft]] * [[Free Culture]] * [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|P2P]] * [[CrimethInc.

(1994) ''The Art of Reasoning''. W W Norton & Company, Inc. ISBN 0-393-96466-3</ref> The deviation in an informal [[fallacy]] often stems from a flaw in the path of [[reason]]ing that links the premises to the conclusion. In contrast to a [[formal fallacy]], the error has to do with issues of [[inference|ratiocination]] manifest in [[natural language|language]] used to state the propositions; the range of elements that can be symbolized by language is broader than that which the symbolism of [[Mathematical logic|formal logic]] can represent. == Deductive and inductive informal fallacies == Informal fallacies of [[deductive reasoning]] contain a fundamental disconnect between the premises and the conclusion that renders the argument [[validity|invalid]]. This disconnect often stems from the presence of a hidden [[co-premise]] that, if presented, would validate the argument. [[Inductive reasoning|Inductive]] informal fallacies are slightly different from their deductive counterparts, as their merit rests in the [[Statistical inference|inductive strength]] of the premise-conclusion link rather than in the presence of hidden premises. For instance, the fallacy of [[hasty generalization]], can be roughly stated as: :p) ''A'' is an ''X'' :p) ''A'' is also a ''Y'' :c) therefore, all ''X''s are also ''Y''s If the populations ''X'' and ''Y'' are both too large to sample completely, then the statement is inductive. In such a case, a hasty generalization occurs when the number of ''X''s and ''Y''s is insufficient to represent the respective populations. It is important to distinguish between a principle of [[reasoning]] (deductive or inductive) and the premise of an argument. == See also == {{main|List of fallacies}} * [[Argumentation theory]] * [[Argument map]] * [[Critical thinking]] * [[Inference objection]] * [[Inquiry]] * [[Lemma (logic)|Lemma]] * [[Sophism]] ==References== <references/> ==Further reading== * {{cite book | author = Damer, T.

In short, Postman meant to indicate the relationship between a piece of information and what action, if any, a consumer of that information might reasonably be expected to take once learning it. In a speech to the German Informatics Society (''Gesellschaft für Informatik'') on October 11, 1990 in Stuttgart, sponsored by IBM-Germany, Postman said the following: "The tie between information and action has been severed. Information is now a commodity that can be bought and sold, or used as a form of entertainment, or worn like a garment to enhance one's status. It comes indiscriminately, directed at no one in particular, disconnected from usefulness; we are glutted with information, drowning in information, have no control over it, don't know what to do with it." In ''Amusing Ourselves to Death'' Postman frames the '''information-action ratio''' in the context of the telegraph's invention. Prior to the telegraph, Postman says people received information relative to their lives, creating a high correlation between information and action: "The information-action ratio was sufficiently close so that most people had a sense of being able to control some of the contingencies in their lives” (p. 69). The telegraph allowed bits of information
