increased to 164 in comparison to older models, and like earlier models, the operating system is UNIX. This series consisted of the Dawning 2000-I and II. ===Dawning 3000=== The fourth member of the Dawning family is Dawning 3000, which passed state certification on Mar 9, 2001. The number of CPU increased to 280, and the system consists of ten 2-meter tall racks, weighing 5 tons total. Power consumption is 25 kW, and one of the tasks it was used for was the part of human genome mapping that China was responsible for. ===Dawning 4000A=== The fifth member of the Dawning family, Dawning 4000A, debuted as one of the top 10 fastest supercomputers in the world, on the [[TOP500]] list,<ref>[http://www.top500.org/list/2004/06/ TOP500 List - June 2004 (1-100) | TOP500 Supercomputing Sites<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> capable of 806.1 billion FLOPS. The system, at the [[Shanghai Supercomputer Center]], utilizes over 2,560 [[AMD Opteron]] processors, and can reach speeds of 8 teraflops. ===Dawning 5000A=== The newest member of the Dawning family is Dawning 5000A. It integrated 7,680 1.9 GHz AMD Opteron Quad-core processors, resulting in 30,720 cores, and [[Infiniband]] interconnecting network. Dawning 5000A occupies an area of 75 square meters and the power consumption is 700 kW. The general designer is Dr. Sun Ninghui (孙凝晖) and the unit price of Dawning 5000A is less than 100 million RMBY (~15 million USD). The supercomputer is capable of 180 teraflops and received state certification in Jun 2008. Ranked 10th in the November 2008 [[TOP500]] list,<ref>[http://www.top500.org/lists/2008/11 November 2008 TOP500 list]</ref> it's also the largest system at that time, using [[Windows HPC Server 2008]] for this benchmark. This system is also installed at the [[Shanghai Supercomputer Center]]. ===Dawning 5000L=== The Dawning 5000 series supercomputer planned to use [[Loongson]] 3 processors which has 16 cores each and 8MB L2 shared cache.<ref>[http://news.sina.com.tw/tech/sinacn/cn/2007-04-04/190438142075.shtml]</ref> However, when the 5000A was revealed in June 2008, it used [[AMD K10]] CPUs instead. It was reported that Shanghai Supercomputer Center required Microsoft Windows support whereas Loongson only ran under [[Linux]]. Dawning claimed that Dawning 5000L may use Loongson 3 processors with petaflop performance, which is expected by 2010.<ref>[http://www.hpcwire.com/blogs/21574739.html China Ditches Home-Grown Chips in New Supercomputer]</ref> ===Dawning 6000=== The high-performance Dawning 6000, which has a projected speed of over 1,000 trillion operations per second, will incorporate the Loongson processor as its core. Dawning 6000 is currently jointly developed by the Institute of Computing Technology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Dawning Information Industry Company. Li Guojie, chairman of Dawning Information Industry Company and director and academician of the Institute of Computing Technology, said research and development of the Dawning 6000 is expected to be completed in two years{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}. By then, Chinese-made high-performance computers will be expected to achieve two major breakthroughs: first, the adoption of domestic-made central processing units (CPUs); second, the existing cluster-based system structure of high-performance computers will be changed once the computing speed reaches 1,000 trillion operations per second.<ref>http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90776/90881/6543567.html</ref><ref>http://www.hpcwire.com/news/Dawning_6000_to_Use_Chinese-Made_Loongson_Processor.html</ref> ==See also== *[[Shanghai Supercomputer Center]] *[[Nebulae (computer)|Nebulae]] ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.ssc.net.cn/ Shanghai Supercomputer Center] * [http://www.dawning.com.cn/ Official site] [[Category:Supercomputers]] [[Category:Computer hardware companies]] [[Category:Supercomputing in China]] [[it:Dawning 4000A]] [[zh:曙光4000A]]</text> </page> <page> <id>9640</id> <title>Db4o</title> <text>{{Multiple issues | advert=October 2009 | COI=April 2010 | cleanup=April 2010 | primarysources=December 2009 }} {{Infobox software | logo = [[Image:db4o-logo.gif|250px]] | screenshot = | caption = | developer = [[Versant Corporation]] | released = | latest_release_version = 7.4 | latest_release_date = | frequently updated = | programming language = | operating system = [[Cross-platform]] | language = | genre = [[Object database]] | license = [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL)<br />[http://www.db4o.com/about/company/legalpolicies/docl.aspx db4o Opensource Compatibility License (dOCL)]<br />Proprietary license | website = [http://www.db4o.com/ db4o.com] }} '''db4o''' (database for objects) is an embeddable [[open source]] object database for [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[.NET Framework|.NET]] developers. It is developed, commercially licensed and supported by [[Versant corporation|Versant]]. db4o is written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[.NET Framework|.NET]] and provides the respective APIs. db4o can run on any operating system that supports Java or .NET. db4o is offered under multiple licenses, including the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL), the [http://www.db4o.com/about/company/legalpolicies/docl.aspx db4o Opensource Compatibility License (dOCL)], and a commercial license for use in proprietary software. == History == [[Object database|Object-oriented Database System]] term goes back to around 1985, though the first research developments in this area started a bit earlier in mid-1970s. The first commercial object database management systems appeared in early 1990s. They added a concept of persistence into the object-oriented languages. The second growth wave was observed in early 2000s, when the Object Databases written completely in an [[Object-oriented programming|Object-Oriented language]] appeared on the market. db4o is one of the examples of such systems written completely in Java and C#. db4o project was started in 2000 by Chief Architect Carl Rosenberger, and first shipped in 2001. Some 100 commercial pilot customers and community users have supported db4o from its earliest days and successfully implemented it in some mission-critical applications prior to its commercial launch in 2004 by newly-created private company Db4objects Inc. In 2008 db4o object database business was bought by [[Versant corporation]], which is the current owner and developer of db4o. db4o is offered to the market as an open-source bi-licensed software (commercial and [[GPL]]). Since the initial launch db4o database has gone through many changes and improvements (see [[#Versions]]) till the current production release of version 7. == Place in the database world == db4o represents an [[Object database|object-oriented database model]]. One of its main goals is to provide an easy and native interface to persistence for [[object oriented programming]] languages. Development with db4o database does not require a separate [[data model]] creation, the application’s class model defines the structure of the data in db4o database. db4o attempts to avoid the [[Object-relational impedance mismatch|object/relational impedance mismatch]] by eliminating the relational layer from a software project. For more information see [[#Features|db4o features]]. Developers using [[relational database]]s can also benefit from using db4o, which can be viewed as a complementary tool. The db4o-RDBMS data exchange can be implemented using db4o
