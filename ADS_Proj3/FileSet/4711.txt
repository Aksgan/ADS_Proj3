language with a superimposed visual representation. Naturally visual languages have an inherent visual expression for which there is no obvious textual equivalent{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. Current developments try to integrate the visual programming approach with [[dataflow programming]] languages to either have immediate access to the [[program state]] resulting in online debugging or automatic program generation and documentation (i.e. [[visual paradigm]]). Dataflow languages also allow [[automatic parallelization]], which is likely to become one of the greatest programming challenges of the future.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Johnston |first=W.M. |authorlink= |coauthors=Hanna, J.R.P. and Millar, R.J. |year=2004 |month= |title=Advances in dataflow programming languages |journal=[[ACM Computing Surveys]] |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=1â€“34 |id= |url=http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~rsass/rcreading/johnston04.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2007-03-31 |quote=|doi=10.1145/1013208.1013209 }}</ref> ==Visual languages and interfaces== {{Dynamic list}} *[[A-Flow]], software general-purpose rapid development tool that doesn't require writing code *[[AgentSheets]], easy to use game authoring and computational science authoring tool *[[Alice (software)|Alice]] *[[Analytica]] *[[AppWare]], also known as MicroBrew, icon based programming for [[Mac OS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] *[[AudioMulch]], an audio signal flow based sound and music creation environment *[[Automate (software)|Automate]], a workflow building tool with writing any line of code by hand *[[Macromedia Authorware]] *[[Automator (software)|Automator]] *[[Aviary (application suite)|Aviary Peacock]], browser based visual laboratory *[[Baltie]] *[[Befunge]], an esoteric text-based programming language in which commands are laid out graphically in a text file *[[BT Rules]], a web-based graphical programming tool with specialised tilesets to define behaviours for different devices *[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/voicesw/ps6789/ps7047/ps7056/product_data_sheet0900aecd805e6a9f.html Cisco Unified Application Designer], a visual programming environment for building [[Unified Communications]] applications, formerly known as the [[Metreos]] Visual Designer *[[CODE programming language|CODE]] *[[DRAKON]], a language designed for developing the Soviet [[Buran (spacecraft)]] *[[EICASLAB]], a software suite including a graphical language for supporting the design of control architectures *[[Executable UML]], a [[profile (UML)|profile]] of the [[Universal Modeling Language]] specification defining an executable semantics for a subset of UML *[[eXpecco]], a graphical flow based language and IDE for test automation *[[webMethods Flow|Flow]] a graphical integration language used in the [[webMethods]] platform *[[Flow-based programming]] *[[Flowcode]], a language used by [[KTechlab (software)]], open source simulator and workbench for programming [[microcontroller]]s using flowcode *[[FlowStone DSP]] Used for programming real time [[DSP]] and [[robotics]] applications *[[Function block diagram]]s, used in [[programmable logic controller]]s *[http://www.smprocess.com FxEngine Framework] - Open C++ dataflow programming for audio, video, signal, ... *[[G (programming language)|G]], language based on [[data flow diagram]]s used in the [[LabVIEW]] development environment *[[Game Maker]], an easy to use game development software made by Mark Overmars *[[Google App Inventor]], a tool for creating applications for Google Android, based on [[OpenBlocks]] and [http://www.gnu.org/software/kawa/ Kawa] *[[GNU Radio Companion]], a signal processing environment using visual blocks *[[Illumination Software Creator]], a language and IDE for visually creating desktop and mobile software *[[Kodu]], a software designed to program games with a 3D Interface developed by Microsoft Research *[[Kwikpoint]], an isotype visual translator created by Alan Stillman *[[LabVIEW]], a graphical language designed for engineers and scientists *[[Ladder logic]], a language that simulates relay logic commonly used in [[Programmable logic controllers]] *[[Lava (programming language)|Lava]] *[[Lily (software)|Lily]], browser based visual programming environment *[[Limnor]] *[[Mama (software)]] - a programming language and IDE for building [http://www.eytam.com/mama 3D animations and games] *[http://andescotia.com/products/marten/ Marten] commercial visual programming environment for Mac OS/X based on Prograph CPX *[[Max (software)]], visual programming environment for building interactive, real-time music and multimedia applications **[[Max/MSP]] **[[Pure Data]] **[[jMax]] **[[nato.0+55+3d]] *[[Microsoft Visual Programming Language]], dataflow language for [[robotics]] programming that is a component of [[Microsoft Robotics Studio]] *[[Mindscript]] - A simplistic data-flow programming language for multipurpose use *[[Morphic (software)]], makes it easier to build and edit graphical objects by direct manipulation and from within programs;
