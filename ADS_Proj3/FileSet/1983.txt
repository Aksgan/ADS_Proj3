Report on Knowledge]]'' by Jean-François Lyotard) ==Psychological== Author [[George Leonard]] discusses in his book ''Mastery'' how homeostasis affects our behavior and who we are. He states that homeostasis will prevent our body from making drastic changes and maintain stability in our lives even if it is detrimental to us.<ref>http://gettingstronger.org/2010/03/george-leonards-mastery/</ref> Examples include when an obese person starts exercising, homeostasis in the body resists the activity to maintain stability.<ref>http://www.procrastinationhelp.com/procrastination/why-resolutions-fail.html</ref> Another example Leonard uses is a unstable family where the father has been a raging alcoholic and suddenly stops and the son starts up a drug habit to maintain stability in the family. Homeostasis is the main factor that stops people changing their habits because our bodies view change as dangerous unless it is very slow. Leonard discusses this dilemma as the media today only encourages fast change and quick results. The opening of his book aptly describes his despair with the current state of the world and how it is at war with homeostasis. "The trouble is that we have few, if any, maps to guide us on the journey or even to show us how to find the path. The modern world, in fact, can be viewed as a prodigious conspiracy against mastery. We're continually bombarded with the promises of immediate gratification, instant success, and fast, temporary relief, all of which lead in exactly the wrong direction."<ref>http://sirpabs.ilahas.com/ebooks/Social%20Interactions/Mastery%20-%20The%20Keys%20To%20Success%20And%20Long-Term%20Fulfillment%20-%20George%20Leonard.pdf</ref> ==See also== <div style="-moz-column-count:3; column-count:3;"> *[[Acclimatization]] *[[Senescence|Aging]] *[[Allostasis]] *[[Apoptosis]] *[[Biological rhythm]] *[[Claude Bernard]] *[[Climate change feedback]] *[[Cybernetics]] *[[Enantiostasis]] *[[Gaia hypothesis]] *[[Health]] *[[homeodynamics]] *[[Homeorhesis]] *[[Lenz's law]] *[[Le Chatelier's principle]] *[[Milieu interieur]] *[[Metabolism]] *[[Osmosis]] *[[Proteostasis]] *[[Protobiont]] *[[Self-organization]] *[[Steady state (disambiguation)|Steady state]] </div> ==References== {{Reflist|2}} {{Cybernetics}} {{Use dmy dates|date=September 2010}} [[Category:Homeostasis| ]] [[Category:Cybernetics]] [[Category:Physiology]] [[Category:Systems theory]] [[Category:Biology terminology]] [[Category:Greek loanwords]] [[af:Homeostase]] [[ar:استتباب]] [[bs:Homeostaza]] [[bg:Хомеостаза]] [[ca:Homeòstasi]] [[cs:Homeostáza]] [[da:Homøostase]] [[de:Selbstregulation]] [[et:Homöostaas]] [[es:Homeostasis]] [[eu:Homeostasi]] [[fr:Homéostasie]] [[gl:Homeostase]] [[ko:항상성]] [[hy:Հոմեոստազ]] [[hi:समस्थिति]] [[hr:Homeostaza]] [[io:Regulademo]] [[id:Homeostasis]] [[is:Samvægi]] [[it:Omeostasi]] [[he:הומאוסטזה]] [[ht:Omeyostazi]] [[lt:Savireguliacija]] [[hu:Homeosztázis]] [[mk:Хомеостаза]] [[ms:Homeostasis]] [[nl:Homeostase (fysiologie)]] [[ja:恒常性]] [[no:Homeostase]] [[nn:Homeostase]] [[nds:Homöostase]] [[pl:Homeostaza]] [[pt:Homeostase]] [[ro:Homeostazie]] [[ru:Гомеостаз]] [[simple:Homeostasis]] [[sk:Homeostáza]] [[sl:Homeostaza]] [[sr:Хомеостаза]] [[fi:Homeostaasi]] [[sv:Homeostas]] [[th:ภาวะธำรงดุล]] [[tr:Homeostaz]] [[uk:Гомеостаз]] [[ur:استتباط]] [[vi:Cân bằng nội môi]] [[zh:體內平衡]]</text> </page> <page> <id>16902</id> <title>Homo economicus</title> <text>{{about|an economic concept|a journal|Homo Oeconomicus}} '''Homo economicus''', or '''Economic human''', is the concept in some [[economic theories]] of humans as [[Rationality|rational]] and narrowly [[Rational egoism|self-interested]] actors who have the ability to make judgments towards their subjectively defined ends. This theory stands in contrast to the concept of '''[[Homo reciprocans]]''', which states that human beings are primarily motivated by the desire to be cooperative, and improve their environment. == History of the term == The term "Economic Man" was used for the first time in the late nineteenth century by critics of [[John Stuart Mill]]’s work on political economy.<ref name=persky>Persky, Joseph. "Retrospectives: The Ethology of Homo Economicus." ''The Journal of Economic Perspectives'', Vol. 9, No. 2 (Spring, 1995), pp. 221-231</ref> Below is a passage from Mill’s work that those 19th-century critics were referring to: <blockquote>"[Political economy] does not treat the whole of man’s nature as modified by the social state, nor of the whole conduct of man in society. It is concerned with him solely as a being who desires to possess wealth, and who is capable of judging the comparative efficacy of means for obtaining that end."<ref>Mill, John Stuart. "On the Definition of Political Economy, and on the Method of Investigation Proper to It," London and Westminster Review, October 1836. ''Essays on Some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy'', 2nd ed. London: Longmans, Green, Reader & Dyer, 1874, essay 5, paragraphs 38 and 48.</ref></blockquote> Later in the same work, Mill goes on to write that he is proposing “an arbitrary definition of man, as a being who inevitably does that by which he may obtain the greatest amount of necessaries, conveniences, and luxuries, with the smallest quantity of labour and physical self-denial with which they can be obtained.” Although the term did not come into use until the 19th century, it is often associated with the ideas of 18th century thinkers like [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]]. In ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', Smith wrote: <blockquote>"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest."<ref> Smith, Adam. “On the Division of Labour,” The Wealth of Nations, Books I-III. New York: Penguin Classics, 1986, page 119</ref></blockquote> This suggests the same sort of rational, self-interested, labor-averse individual that Mill proposes (although Smith did claim that individuals have sympathy for the well-being of others, in ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]''). Aristotle's ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' discussed the nature of self interest in [http://www.constitution.org/ari/polit_02.htm Book II, Part V]. <blockquote>"Again, how immeasurably greater is the pleasure, when a man feels a thing to be his own; for surely the love of self is a feeling implanted by nature and not given in vain, although selfishness is rightly censured; this, however, is not the mere love of self, but the love of self in excess, like the miser's love of money; for all, or almost all, men love money and other such objects in a measure. And further, there is the greatest pleasure in doing a kindness or service to friends or guests or companions, which can only be rendered when a man has private property."</blockquote> A wave of economists in the late 19th century—[[Francis Edgeworth]], [[William Stanley Jevons]], [[Léon Walras]], and [[Vilfredo Pareto]]—built mathematical models on these assumptions. In the 20th century, [[Lionel Robbins]]’ [[rational choice theory]] came to dominate mainstream economics and the term Economic Man took on a more specific meaning of a person who acted rationally on complete knowledge out of self-interest and the desire for wealth. ==Model== ''Homo economicus'' is a term used for an approximation or [[Economic model|model]] of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' that acts to obtain the highest possible well-being for himself given available information about opportunities and other constraints, both natural and [[institution]]al, on his ability to achieve his predetermined goals. This approach has been formalized in certain [[social sciences]] models, particularly in [[economics]]. ''Homo economicus'' is seen as "rational" in the sense that well-being as defined
