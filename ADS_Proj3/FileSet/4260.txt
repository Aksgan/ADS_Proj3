From static equilibrium of an infinitesimal material element at <math>P\,\!</math> (Figure 8.2), the normal stress <math>\sigma_\mathrm{n}\,\!</math> and the shear stress <math>\tau_\mathrm{n}\,\!</math> on any plane perpendicular to the <math>x\,\!</math>-<math>y\,\!</math> plane passing through <math>P\,\!</math> with a unit vector <math>\mathbf n\,\!</math> making an angle of <math>\theta\,\!</math> with the horizontal, i.e. <math>\cos \theta\,\!</math> is the direction cosine in the <math>x\,\!</math> direction, is given by: :<math>\sigma_\mathrm{n} = \frac{1}{2} ( \sigma_x + \sigma_y ) + \frac{1}{2} ( \sigma_x - \sigma_y )\cos 2\theta + \tau_{xy} \sin 2\theta\,\!</math> :<math>\tau_\mathrm{n} = -\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_x - \sigma_y )\sin 2\theta + \tau_{xy}\cos 2\theta\,\!</math> These equations indicate that in a plane stress or plane strain condition, one can determine the stress components at a point on all directions, i.e. as a function of <math>\theta\,\!</math>, if one knows the stress components <math>(\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \tau_{xy})\,\!</math> on any two perpendicular directions at that point. It is important to remember that we are considering a unit area of the infinitesimal element in the direction parallel to the <math>y\,\!</math>-<math>z\,\!</math> plane. [[Image:Stress transformation 2D.svg|460px|left|thumb|Figure 8.1 - Stress transformation at a point in a continuum under plane stress conditions.]] [[Image:Stress at a plane 2D.svg|200px|none|thumb|Figure 8.2 - Stress components at a plane passing through a point in a continuum under plane stress conditions.]] The principal directions (Figure 8.3), i.e. orientation of the planes where the shear stress components are zero, can be obtained by making the previous equation for the shear stress <math>\tau_\mathrm{n}\,\!</math> equal to zero. Thus we have: :<math>\tau_\mathrm{n} = -\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_x - \sigma_y )\sin 2\theta + \tau_{xy}\cos 2\theta=0\,\!</math> and we obtain :<math>\tan 2 \theta_\mathrm{p} = \frac{2 \tau_{xy}}{\sigma_x - \sigma_y}\,\!</math> This equation defines two values <math>\theta_\mathrm{p}\,\!</math> which are <math>90^\circ\,\!</math> apart (Figure 8.3). The same result can be obtained by finding the angle <math>\theta\,\!</math> which makes the normal stress <math>\sigma_\mathrm{n}\,\!</math> a maximum, i.e. <math>\frac{d\sigma_\mathrm{n}}{d\theta}=0\,\!</math> The principal stresses <math>\sigma_1\,\!</math> and <math>\sigma_2\,\!</math>, or minimum and maximum normal stresses <math>\sigma_\mathrm{max}\,\!</math> and <math>\sigma_\mathrm{min}\,\!</math>, respectively, can then be obtained by replacing both values of <math>\theta_\mathrm{p}\,\!</math> into the previous equation for <math>\sigma_\mathrm{n}\,\!</math>. This can be achieved by rearranging the equations for <math>\sigma_\mathrm{n}\,\!</math> and <math>\tau_\mathrm{n}\,\!</math>, first transposing the first term in the first equation and squaring both sides of each of the equations then adding them. Thus we have :<math>\begin{align} \left[ \sigma_\mathrm{n} - \tfrac{1}{2} ( \sigma_x + \sigma_y )\right]^2 + \tau_\mathrm{n}^2 &= \left[\tfrac{1}{2}(\sigma_x - \sigma_y)\right]^2 + \tau_{xy}^2 \\ (\sigma_\mathrm{n} - \sigma_\mathrm{avg})^2 + \tau_\mathrm{n}^2 &= R^2 \end{align}\,\!</math> where :<math>R = \sqrt{\left[\tfrac{1}{2}(\sigma_x - \sigma_y)\right]^2 + \tau_{xy}^2} \quad \text{and} \quad \sigma_\mathrm{avg} = \tfrac{1}{2} ( \sigma_x + \sigma_y )\,\!</math> which is the equation of a circle of radius <math>R\,\!</math> centered at a point with coordinates <math>[\sigma_\mathrm{avg}, 0]\,\!</math>, called [[Mohr's circle]]. But knowing that for the principal stresses the shear stress <math>\tau_\mathrm{n} = 0\,\!</math>, then we obtain from this equation: :<math>\sigma_1 =\sigma_\mathrm{max} = \tfrac{1}{2}(\sigma_x + \sigma_y) + \sqrt{\left[\tfrac{1}{2}(\sigma_x - \sigma_y)\right]^2 + \tau_{xy}^2}\,\!</math> :<math>\sigma_2 =\sigma_\mathrm{min} = \tfrac{1}{2}(\sigma_x + \sigma_y) - \sqrt{\left[\tfrac{1}{2}(\sigma_x - \sigma_y)\right]^2 + \tau_{xy}^2}\,\!</math> [[Image:Principal stresses 2D.svg|400px|left|thumb|Figure 8.3 - Transformation of stresses in two dimensions, showing the planes of action of principal stresses, and maximum and minimum shear stresses.]] {{Clear}} When <math>\tau_{xy}=0\,\!</math> the infinitesimal element is oriented in the direction of the principal planes, thus the stresses acting on the rectangular element are principal stresses: <math>\sigma_x = \sigma_1\,\!</math> and <math>\sigma_y = \sigma_2\,\!</math>. Then the normal stress <math>\sigma_\mathrm{n}\,\!</math> and shear stress <math>\tau_\mathrm{n}\,\!</math> as a function of the principal stresses can be determined by making <math>\tau_{xy}=0\,\!</math>. Thus we have :<math>\sigma_\mathrm{n} = \frac{1}{2} ( \sigma_1 + \sigma_2 ) + \frac{1}{2} ( \sigma_1 - \sigma_2 )\cos 2\theta\,\!</math> :<math>\tau_\mathrm{n} = -\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_1 - \sigma_2 )\sin 2\theta\,\!</math> Then the maximum shear stress <math>\tau_\mathrm{max}\,\!</math> occurs when <math>\sin 2\theta = 1\,\!</math>, i.e. <math>\theta = 45^\circ\,\!</math> (Figure 8.3): :<math>\tau_\mathrm{max} = \frac{1}{2}(\sigma_1 - \sigma_2 )\,\!</math> Then the minimum shear stress <math>\tau_\mathrm{min}\,\!</math> occurs when <math>\sin 2\theta = -1\,\!</math>, i.e. <math>\theta = 135^\circ\,\!</math> (Figure 8.3): :<math>\tau_\mathrm{min} = -\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_1 - \sigma_2 )\,\!</math> ==Graphical representation of stress at a point== ''Mohr's circle'', ''Lame's stress ellipsoid'' (together with the ''stress director surface''), and ''Cauchy's stress quadric'' are two-dimensional graphical representations of the [[Stress (mechanics)#Cauchy's stress principle|state of stress at a point]]. They allow for the graphical determination of the magnitude of the stress tensor at a given point for all planes passing through that point. Mohr's circle is the most common graphical method. ===Mohr's circle=== {{Main|Mohr's circle}} ''Mohr's circle'', named after [[Otto Mohr|Christian Otto Mohr]], is the locus of points that represent the state of stress on individual planes at all their orientations. The [[abscissa]], <math>\sigma_\mathrm{n}\,\!</math>, and [[ordinate]], <math>\tau_\mathrm{n}\,\!</math>, of each point on the [[circle]] are the normal stress and shear stress components, respectively, acting on a particular cut plane with a [[unit vector]] <math>\mathbf n\,\!</math> with components <math>\left(n_1, n_2, n_3 \right)\,\!</math>. ===Lame's stress ellipsoid=== {{Main|Lame's stress ellipsoid}} The surface of the ellipsoid represents the locus of the endpoints of all stress vectors acting on all planes passing through a given point in the continuum body. In other words, the endpoints of all stress vectors at a given point in the continuum body lie on the stress ellipsoid surface, i.e., the radius-vector from the center of the ellipsoid, located at the material point in consideration, to a point on the surface of the ellipsoid is equal to the stress vector on some plane passing through the point. In two dimensions, the surface is represented by an [[ellipse]] (Figure coming). ===Cauchy's stress quadric=== {{Main|Cauchy's stress quadric}} The Cauchy's stress quadric, also called the ''stress surface'', is a surface of the second order that traces the variation of the normal stress vector <math>\sigma_\mathrm n \,\!</math> as the orientation of the planes passing through a given point is changed. ==Graphical representation of the stress field== {{see also|Stress field}} The complete state of stress in a body at a particular deformed configuration, i.e., at a particular time during the motion of the
