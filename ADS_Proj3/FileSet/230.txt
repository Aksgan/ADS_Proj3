for a $100 [[deposit slip]] in anticipation of Alice wanting to transfer money to him. To generate a deposit slip the bank selects a large, globally unique [[random number]] <math>R</math> and encrypts it using the bank's public key; this means that it can only be decrypted with the bank's secret key: <math>R' = R^e\pmod n</math> This encrypted value <math>R'</math> is sent to Bob with the promise to deposit $100 into his account when Bob sends the value <math>R</math> back to the bank. The bank is confident that Bob won't be able to break RSA to generate <math>R</math> from <math>R'</math> within the [[heat death of the universe]] without knowledge of <math>d</math>, so it does not worry about handing out the deposit slips without receiving anything from Bob. When Alice wants to pay Bob $100 she asks for the deposit slip and Bob sends her <math>R'</math>. Alice selects a large random value <math>w</math> coprime with <math>n</math> (so as to have an inverse modulo <math>n</math>) and uses it to [[Blind_signature|blind]] <math>R''=w^e*R'</math> and sends it to the bank to be [[Blind_signature|blind signed]]. The Bank charges Alice $100 for this operation and returns the blind signed value <math>R'''</math>. Due to the symmetric properties of RSA, this provides her with <math>R</math>: <math> \begin{align} R''' & = (w^e*R')^d \pmod n \\ & = (w^e*R^e)^d \pmod n \\ & = (w*R)^{ed} \pmod n \\ & = w * R \pmod n\\ \end{align} </math> Because of the blinding process, the Bank is not able to associate <math>R''</math> with <math>R'</math> or <math>R</math>, so it is unable to determine that Bob and Alice are doing business together, preserving the anonymity of the transaction. Alice unblinds <math>R'''</math> (by dividing it by <math>w</math>) to generate the original value <math>R</math>, which she sends to Bob. Bob verifies that <math>R</math> can be encrypted with the bank's public key by computing <math>R' = R^e \pmod n</math>, which means that Alice has deposited $100 into the bank. Bob then sends this value to the bank and the bank checks its records to be sure that <math>R</math> has not been already used. If it has not, it deposits $100 into his account and updates its database that the unique value <math>R</math> has been redeemed. Different public keys can be used for different denominations of currency so this system doesn't take appreciably longer for large transactions. Note that if neither Alice nor Bob wishes the bank to know that they performed a transaction with each other, then it is hard for the bank to find out. However, in order to ensure this is the case many people need to be making transactions at the same time. Otherwise the bank can figure it out by the timing of the transactions, using [[traffic analysis]]. ==See also== *[[Bearer bond]] *[[Blind signature]] *[[Electronic money]] *[[Itex]] *[[Online banking]] *[[Ripple monetary system]] *[[RSA]] ==External links== *[http://wiki.github.com/FellowTraveler/Open-Transactions/ Open Transactions] - Open-source software, including library, server, and client, providing untraceable digital cash and anonymous numbered accounts. *[http://orlingrabbe.com/dmt1.htm The Digital Monetary Trust, Part 1] - Anonymous banking based on cryptography, not bankers & lawyers. *[http://orlingrabbe.com/dmt2.htm The Digital Monetary Trust, Part 2] - The mathematical details of the anonymous banking system. *[[David Chaum]]'s [http://www.chaum.com/articles/Achieving_Electronic_Privacy.htm Scientific American article on Achieving Electronic Privacy] *[http://osaka.law.miami.edu/~froomkin/articles/tcmay.htm Untraceable Digital Cash, Information Markets, and BlackNet] by [[Timothy C.

It contains 656 students from the ages of 11 to 16.<ref name="ofsted">{{cite web|url=http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/oxedu_providers/full/(urn)/123865|title=Ansford School|publisher=Ofsted|accessdate=19 November 2010}}</ref> It is run by the head teacher Robert Benzie. The main school was built in 1940 with additional rooms for science, technology, mathematics and modern languages being added in the 1970's. A new £1.7 million Sports Centre was completed in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ansford.somerset.sch.uk/facilities.html|title=Ansford School Facilities|publisher=Ansford School|accessdate=2009-01-23}}</ref> The school has its own animated micro-series set around the fictional deaths of Mr Kershaw, a teacher at the school and has cameos from other school teachers as well including headmaster Mr Benzie. It was created by former student Callum Dower who has now departed from the school. The series is named ″Who killed Mr Kershaw?″. Kevin Cruise, from series four of Britain's got talent, attended Ansford School. It is a great school with quality teachers. Many people have said how great a school it is. ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.ansford.somerset.sch.uk/ Official website] *[http://www.edubase.gov.uk/establishment/summary.xhtml?urn=123865 DfES EduBase entry for Ansford School] {{Schools in Somerset}} [[Category:Education in Somerset]] [[Category:Comprehensive schools in Somerset]] [[Category:Mathematics and Computing Colleges in England]] {{Somerset-school-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>1969</id> <title>Answer set programming</title> <text>'''Answer set programming''' (ASP) is a form of [[declarative programming]] oriented towards difficult (primarily [[NP-hard]]) [[search algorithm|search problems]].
