The 2-dimensional grid network consists of triangles, squares, rectangles or [[polygons]] (Fig. 7). Hence, the flow domain is subdivided into vertical blocks or [[prism (geometry)|prisms]] (Fig. 3). The prisms can be discretized into ''horizontal'' layers with different characteristics that may also vary between the prisms. The groundwater flow between neighboring prisms is calculated using 2-dimensional horizontal groundwater flow equations. Vertical flows are found by applying one-dimensional flow equations in a vertical sense, or they can be derived from the water balance: excess of horizontal inflow over horizontal outflow (or vice versa) is translated into vertical flow, as demonstrated in the article [[Hydrology (agriculture)]]. In semi 3-dimensional models, intermediate flow between horizontal and vertical is not modelled like in truly 3-dimensional models. Yet, like the truly 3-dimensional models, such models do permit the introduction of horizontal and vertical [[Watertable control|subsurface drainage]] systems (Fig. 3). Semiconfined aquifers with a slowly permeable layer overlying the aquifer (the [[Aquifer#Aquifers versus aquitards|aquitard]]) can be included in the model by simulating vertical flow through it under influence of an overpressure in the aquifer proper relative to the level of the watertable inside or above the aquitard. ==Groundwater modeling software & references== * [[Analytic Element Method]] * [[FEFLOW]] * [[FEHM]] * [http://www.heath-hydrology.com/html/software.html GWFLOW] * [http://www.microfem.nl/ MicroFEM] * [[MODFLOW]] ** [[GMS (software)|GMS]] ** [[Visual MODFLOW]] * [[SahysMod]], Spatial agro-hydro-salinity-aquifer model, online: [http://www.waterlog.info/sahysmod.htm] * [http://water.usgs.gov/software/lists/ground_water/ US Geological Survey Water Resources Ground Water Software] * [[ZOOMQ3D]] * [https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/parflow/parflow_home.html PARFLOW] ==See also== * [[Aquifer]] * [[Groundwater]] * [[Groundwater flow equation]] * [[Groundwater energy balance]] * [[Hydraulic conductivity]] * [[Hydrogeology]] * [[Soil salinity control|Salinity model]] * [[Watertable control]] * [[Well drainage|Groundwater drainage by wells]] ==Footnotes== <references/> ==Miscellaneous== {{Expand section|date=December 2009}} <br /> {{Computer modeling}} {{Aquiferproperties}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Groundwater Model}} [[Category:Hydraulic engineering]] [[Category:Scientific simulation software]] [[Category:Hydrology]] [[Category:Hydrogeology]] [[Category:Hydrology models]] [[Category:Aquifers]] [[Category:Water management]] [[de:Grundwassermodell]] [[es:Modelo de agua subterránea]] [[nl:Grondwatermodel]]</text> </page> <page> <id>15899</id> <title>Growth curve</title> <text>[[Image:Bacterial_growth_monod.png|thumb|right|300px|Figure 1: A bi-phasic [[bacterial growth]] curve.]] A '''''growth curve''''' is an empirical model of the evolution of a quantity over time. Growth curves are widely used in [[biology]] for quantities such as [[population]] size, body height or [[biomass]]. Values for the measured property can be plotted on a [[graph of a function|graph]] as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of time; see Figure 1 for an example.
