if the program has explicitly marked them ''close-on-exec''. This allows for the common practice of the parent creating a [[Pipeline (Unix)|pipe]] prior to calling <tt>fork()</tt> and using it to communicate with the executed program. [[Windows]] does not support the fork-exec technique as it does not allow to fork a process. The <tt>[[spawn (computing)|spawn()]]</tt> family of functions declared in [[process.h]] can replace it in cases where the call to <tt>fork()</tt> is followed directly by <tt>exec()</tt>. ==See also== *[[fork (operating system)|fork]] *[[exec (operating system)|exec]] *[[spawn (computing)|spawn]] ==References== *[http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~franco/OpSys-304-427/messages/node91.html File descriptors across fork(2)/exec(2) paper in Mcgill University] *[http://www-h.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/tpl/unix/fork.html fork page in the Engineering Department of Cambridge University] *"Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment", W.Richard Stevens, Addison-Wesley ISBN 0-201-56317-7 *"Unix Power Tools", J Peek, T O'Reilly, M Loukides, O'Reilly, ISBN 1-56592-260-3 {{DEFAULTSORT:Fork-Exec}} [[Category:POSIX standards]] {{Unix-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>13966</id> <title>Form taxon (botany)</title> <text>'''Form taxon''' is used by [[Paleobotany|paleobotanists]] to name the fossil parts of plants where identification with a complete plant, whether living, or a reconstructed [[fossil]], is not possible. It is often not possible to associate the [[wood]], [[leaf]], [[flower]], [[fruit]] and [[pollen]] of a [[fossil plant]] with each other, as fossil plants are usually found as disarticulated parts, and the individual parts are often insufficient for identification. This is particularly for older material which is less closely related to modern representatives, and may be less well preserved. Consequently paleobotanists use '''form taxa''' in [[botanical nomenclature]]. ==Suffix== The part of the plant is often, but not universally, indicated by the use of a [[suffix]] in the [[generic name]]: *wood fossils may have generic names ending in ''-xylon'' *leaf fossils generic names ending in ''-phyllum'' *fruit fossils generic names ending in ''-carpon'', ''-carpum'' or ''-carpus'' *pollen fossils generic names ending in ''-pollis'' or ''-pollenoides''. {{-}} [[Category:Botanical nomenclature]] [[Category:Prehistoric plants]] [[Category:Plant taxonomy]] [[Category:Taxonomy]] {{botany-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>14005</id> <title>Fortismere School</title> <text>{{Infobox UK school | name = Fortismere School | image = Fortismere.jpg | size = 200px | latitude = 51.59285 | longitude = -0.15095 | dms = dms | motto = | motto_pl = | established = 1983 (William Grimshaw in 1902) | approx = | closed = | c_approx = | type = [[Foundation school]] | religion = | president = | head_label = | head = Ms Helen Anthony | r_head_label = | r_head = | chair_label = | chair = | founder = | founder_pl = | specialist = [[Mathematics and Computing College|Maths and Computing]], [[Music College|Music]] and [[Language College|Modern Languages]] | specialist_pl = yes | street = Tetherdown (South Wing), Creighton Avenue (North Wing) | city = Muswell Hill | county = London | country = England {{flagicon|England}} | postcode = N10 1NS (South Wing)<br />N10 1NE (North Wing) | LEA = [[London Borough of Haringey]] | ofsted = yes | dfeno = 4032 | urn = 102156 | staff = | enrollment = 1614 | gender = [[Coeducation|Co-educational]] | lower_age = 11 | upper_age = 18 | houses = | colours = blue, black | website = http://www.fortismere.haringey.sch.uk | website_name = Fortismere on the Hill }} '''Fortismere School''' is a mixed, community [[foundation School|foundation]] [[secondary school]] in [[Muswell Hill]], [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]. ==Admissions== It falls under the [[London Borough of Haringey]] [[Local Education Authority]]. The school is situated on an extensive site a little west of the town centre, with main entrances in Twyford Avenue and Tetherdown (South Wing), and Creighton Avenue (North Wing). To gain entrance to the sixth form, high performance at GCSE is needed. It is situated just off the A504. == History == The first school on the site was Tollington School, a private boys' school. ===Grammar schools=== After World War II, this became a state grammar school and the attached preparatory school became Tetherdown Primary School (this moved from the site in 1958 when it exchanged premises with the girls' grammar school). In 1958 the current building was erected and Tollington High School for Girls and Tollington Grammar School for Boys merged to become Tollington Grammar School (co-ed). In the 1950s William Grimshaw Secondary Modern School opened on an adjoining site in ''Creighton Avenue''. ===Creighton Comprehensive school=== With the introduction of comprehensive education in Haringey in 1967, Tollington Grammar School and William Grimshaw Secondary Modern School were merged to form Creighton School on ''Creighton Avenue''. Sir William Grimshaw was a local councillor. Charles Loades, head of William Grimshaw since 1958, became head, and remained until his retirement in 1974.<ref name="davies">Hunter Davies ''The Creighton Report: A Year in the Life of a Comprehensive School'', (1976), Hamish Hamilton. ISBN 0-241-89412-3.</ref> In the early 1970s, Creighton School became the centrepiece of a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] education experiment. Situated in the [[middle class]] largely white suburb of Muswell Hill it was decided to integrate a large number of Afro-Caribbean and other ethnic minority children into the school from distant parts of the borough in an attempt to maximise education choice and social interaction - a policy based heavily on the then United States system of [[desegregation busing]]. In 1975, before this new intake had worked through the school, around one third of the Sixth Form was either a first-generation immigrant, or had a surname of Cypriot or Asian origin.<ref name="davies"/> The head who was charged with overseeing this experiment was Molly Hattersley, the wife of Labour Party minister [[Roy Hattersley]].<ref name="davies"/> As a part of the continuing debate about comprehensive schools, Creighton school became the subject of a series of articles in the [[Sunday Times]] and a subsequent book by [[Hunter Davies]], "The Creighton Report",<ref name="davies"/> illustrated by an A Level Photography student at the school. ===Fortismere School=== [[Image:Fortismere - geograph.org.uk - 240906.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to the North wing]] After further reorganisation, Creighton School and another comprehensive, Alexandra Park School, were combined under the new name of Fortismere School. It opened in September 1983 and gained [[Technology College]] status in 1997; this status has been extended to 2007. The school is now one of the most successful comprehensive schools in North London. In the summer of 2006, the [[School governor|school's governors]] made
