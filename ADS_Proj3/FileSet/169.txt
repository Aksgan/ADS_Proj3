tax on a number of essential goods including paper, glass, and tea. Angered at the tax increases, colonists organized a boycott of British goods. In Boston on March 5, 1770, a large mob gathered around a group of British soldiers. The mob grew more and more threatening, throwing snowballs, rocks and debris at the soldiers. One soldier was clubbed and fell. All but one of the soldiers fired into the crowd. Eleven people were hit; three civilians were killed at the scene of the shooting, and two died after the incident. The event quickly came to be called the [[Boston Massacre]]. Although the soldiers were tried and acquitted (defended by John Adams), the widespread descriptions soon became propaganda to turn colonial sentiment against the British. This in turn began a downward spiral in the relationship between Britain and the Province of Massachusetts.<ref>Hiller B.

Soon afterward, Governor Thomas Hutchinson of Massachusetts reported that he and the royal judges would be paid directly from London, thus bypassing the colonial legislature. On December 16, 1773, a group of men, led by Samuel Adams and dressed to evoke [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], boarded the ships of the government-favored [[East India Company|British East India Company]] and dumped an estimated £10,000 worth of tea from its holds (approximately £636,000 in 2008) into the harbor. This event became known as the [[Boston Tea Party]] and remains a significant part of American patriotic lore.<ref>Benjamin L.

By then, however, the Americans had little regard for new laws from London; they were drilling militia and organizing for war.<ref>Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 15</ref> The British government responded by passing several Acts which came to be known as the [[Intolerable Acts]], which further darkened colonial opinion towards the British. They consisted of four laws enacted by the British parliament.<ref>Miller (1943) pp. 353–76</ref> The first was the [[Massachusetts Government Act]], which altered the Massachusetts charter and restricted town meetings. The second Act, the [[Administration of Justice Act 1774|Administration of Justice Act]], ordered that all British soldiers to be tried were to be arraigned in Britain, not in the colonies. The third Act was the [[Boston Port Act]], which closed the port of Boston until the British had been compensated for the tea lost in the Boston Tea Party (the British never received such a payment). The fourth Act was the Quartering Acts of 1774, which allowed royal governors to house British troops in the homes of citizens without requiring permission of the owner. [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] argued in 1775 for the British position that Englishmen paid on average twenty-five shillings annually in taxes whereas Americans paid only sixpence.<ref>Miller, p.89</ref> The colonists countered that North's argument failed to take into consideration the taxes collected by colonial governments. The colonists believed, especially considering the economic restraints the British were keen to enforce in the colonies, that any additional tax burden from London was excessive. ===American political opposition=== {{See|Suffolk Resolves|Declaration of Rights and Grievances|Continental Association|Petition to the King (1774)|Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress|Conciliatory Resolution|Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms|Olive Branch Petition|Hutchinson Letters Affair}} American political opposition was initially through the colonial assemblies such as the Stamp Act Congress, which included representatives from across the colonies. In 1765, the [[Sons of Liberty]] were formed which used public demonstrations, violence and threats of violence to ensure that the British tax laws were unenforceable. While openly hostile to what they considered an oppressive Parliament acting illegally, colonists persisted in numerous petitions and pleas for intervention from a monarch to whom they still claimed loyalty. In late 1772, after the [[Gaspée Affair|''Gaspée'' Affair]], Samuel Adams in Boston set about creating new Committees of Correspondence, which linked Patriots in all thirteen colonies and eventually provided the framework for a rebel government. In early 1773 Virginia, the largest colony, set up its Committee of Correspondence, on which Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson served.<ref>Greene and Pole (1994) chapters 22–24</ref> A total of about 7000 to 8000 Patriots served on Committees Correspondence at the colonial and local levels, comprising most of the leadership in their communities—the
