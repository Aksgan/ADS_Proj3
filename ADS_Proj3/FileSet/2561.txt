Broadcasting]] and [[Satellite Syndicated Systems]] (SSS). Electra ran up until 1993, when it was shut down due to [[Zenith Electronics|Zenith]], the prominent (and only) American TV manufacturer at the time offering teletext features in their sets decided to discontinue such features, as well as a lack of funding and lagging interest in teletext by the American consumer. [[Zenith Electronics Corporation|Zenith]] manufactured models of television sets in the USA in the 1980s, most notably their ''Digital System 3'' line, that had built-in WST teletext decoders as a feature, much like most British/European TV sets. Teletext services in the USA like [[Electra (teletext)|Electra]] could be received with one of these sets, but these were mostly more expensive higher-end sets offered by Zenith, possibly causing Electra (and American teletext in general) to never catch on with the public. Australian company [[Dick Smith Electronics]] (DSE) also offered through their USA distributors a set-top WST teletext decoder kit. The kit used as its core the same teletext [[decoding]] module (manufactured by UK electronics company [[Mullard]]) installed in most British TV sets, with additional circuitry to adapt it for American [[NTSC]] video, and to utilize it in a separate set-top box. A significant reason for the demise of American teletext was when [[Zenith Electronics|Zenith]] introduced built-in [[closed captioning]] decoders in TVs in the early '90s, as mandated by the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]]. It was not practical for Zenith to re-design their TV chassis models that previously had teletext decoder support to have both teletext and closed captioning support. So Zenith decided to drop the teletext features, therefore ending teletext service in the US in the early 1990s, considering Zenith was the only major manufacturer of teletext-equipped sets in America. === 1990s: InterCast === {{Main|Intercast}} InterCast was a modern teletext-like system created by [[Intel]] in 1996, using a TV tuner card installed in a desktop [[Personal computer|PC]] running Windows with the InterCast Viewer software. The software would receive data representing [[HTML]] pages via the [[VBI]] (Vertical Blanking Interval) of a television channel's video, while displaying in a window in the InterCast software the TV channel itself. The [[HTML]] data received would then be displayed in another window in the Intercast software. It usually was extra supplemental information relevant to the TV program being viewed, such as extra clues for the viewer during a murder mystery show, or extra news headlines or extended weather forecasts during a newscast. [[NBC]], as well as [[The Weather Channel (United States)|The Weather Channel]], [[CNN]] and [[MTV2|M2]] (now MTV2), utilized InterCast technology to complement their programming. InterCast, however, fell into disuse, and Intel discontinued support of InterCast a few years later. ===WaveTop=== {{Main|WaveTop}} Another service in the USA similar in delivery and content to teletext was the ''WaveTop'' service, provided and operated by the [[Wavephore]] Corporation. It used the same types of InterCast-compatible TV tuner cards, and used an application that ran under Windows, like InterCast. In fact, WaveTop software was also bundled with TV tuner cards that had InterCast software bundled with them as well. However, Wavetop was an independent service from InterCast, and wasn't a complementary service to a television program or channel like the latter. In fact, viewing television with a TV card was not possible while the WaveTop software was running, since the software utilized the TV tuner card as a full-time data receiver. WaveTop provided content from several different providers in the form of HTML pages displayed in the WaveTop software, such as news articles from the [[New York Times]], weather information provided by [[The Weather Channel (United States)|The Weather Channel]], and sports from [[ESPN]]. It also delivered short video clips, usually commercials, that could be viewed in the software as well. When it was in operation, WaveTop's data was delivered on the [[VBI]] of local public TV stations affiliated with the [[PBS]] network through their [[PBS National Datacast]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbsnationaldatacast.com |title=非公開求人・転職支援会社 |publisher=Pbsnationaldatacast.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-30}}</ref> division, that the TV card and WaveTop software tuned into to receive the service. ===Guide+=== {{Main|Guide Plus}} Yet another service in the U.S. that relied on data delivery via the [[VBI]] like teletext, was the ''Guide+'' (''Guide Plus'', also referred to as ''GuidePlus+'' as well) service provided and developed by [[Gemstar]]. There were several models of television sets made throughout the 90s by [[Thomson SA|Thomson Consumer Electronics]] under the [[RCA]] and [[General Electric]] brands that had built-in Guide+ decoders. Guide+ was an on-screen interactive program guide that provided current TV schedule listings, as well as other information like news headlines. Some Guide+ equipped sets from RCA even had an [[IR]]-emitting sensor that could be plugged in to the back of the TV, to control a VCR to record programs which could be selected from the on-screen Guide+ listings. In some ways, this was very similar to the [[Video Programming by Teletext|Video Programming by Teletext (VPT)]], [[Video Program System]] (VPS), and [[Programme Delivery Control]] (PDC) features of British/European teletext. Guide+ was a free service, supported by advertisements displayed on-screen in the Guide+ menu and listing screens, not unlike [[banner ads]] displayed on web pages. Guide+ was delivered over the [[VBI]] of select local American TV stations. Guide+ was discontinued by Gemstar in June 2004, and soon afterwards, [[Thomson SA|Thomson]] dropped the Guide+ features from all RCA and GE television sets made afterward. However, Guide+ in America has now been replaced by Gemstar with a similar service (delivered in the same fashion via VBI like Guide+), called ''[[TV Guide On Screen]]''.<ref>[http://www.gemstartvguide.com/whatwedo/tvgonscreen.asp ]{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}</ref> A small number of televisions, [[DVD recorder]]s, and [[digital video recorder]]s are now being released with ''TV Guide On Screen'' capabilities. The Guide+ name & service is still used in Europe by Gemstar. (The same service is known in Japan as G-Guide). ===Star Sight=== {{Main|Star Sight}} Similar to Guide+ was ''Star Sight'',<ref>http://www.starsight.com</ref> with its decoders built in to TVs manufactured by Zenith, Samsung, Sony, Toshiba, Magnavox, and others. This was an electronic program guide service similar to Guide+, but was a service that relied on monthly subscription fees paid by the user,
