SMGF collects DNA samples and genealogical information from individuals across the globe to establish these connections. Although it operates as a not for profit foundation it is a wholly owned subsidiary of [[sorenson companies | Sorenson Companies]]. == History == SMGF originated in 1999 and was inspired by several conversations between inventor and philanthropist [[James LeVoy Sorenson]] and professor Dr. [[Scott Woodward]]. Mr. Sorenson envisioned the development of a [[genetic genealogy|genetic-genealogical]] blueprint of all humankind. This blueprint, as developed by Dr. Woodward, would show how closely humans are related to one another, demonstrating the familial relationships between unique individuals. The collection of DNA samples and associated family pedigrees began in 2000, beginning first with [[Brigham Young University]] students, and quickly branching outside of Utah, then to the rest of the world. In 2003, SMGF moved its operations from the Brigham Young University campus to Salt Lake City. SMGF also outsourced all of its laboratory work to [[Sorenson Genomics]], freeing researchers to create a publicly-available online repository. This repository is known as the Sorenson Database. To date, SMGF has collected more than 100,000 DNA samples and familial pedigrees from donors around the world, all of which are available in the [http://www.smgf.org/pages/sorensondatabase.jspx Sorenson Database]. == Sorenson Database == The Sorenson Database contains more than 100,000 DNA samples and familial pedigrees, encompassing 2.8 million genealogical records and 2.4 million genotypes. The Sorenson Database matches genetic information with familial surnames. A person searching through the database is able to find both genetic and genealogical matches, but can search using either DNA haplotypes or familial surname. The average family pedigree contains six generations of pedigree information (more than 150 years) with over 6 million genetically-linked ancestors. Currently, the Sorenson Database has two areas for individuals to search, a [[Y chromosome]] database and a [[mitochondrial DNA]] database. The Y-DNA database allows males to search their direct paternal line; the mtDNA database allows both males and females search their direct maternal line. == Participation == One of the missions of SMGF is to connect any two individuals in the world, showing both individuals how they are related. In order to accomplish this goal, SMGF has collected DNA samples and
