award is given to the user with the most portal awards during the previous month. Only the Daily Feature, 2nd, and 3rd Place awards count towards becoming ''KOTP'', with each award being worth 3, 2, and 1 point respectively. Whichever user that accumulates the most points during the month will be awarded ''KOTP''. ** '''Best of the Month:''' As of February 2005, the 2000 active highest-ranked (based on experience points) Newgrounds users, as well as [[forum moderator|moderators]] and nominees, have been able to vote for the best five submissions of the month (later updated to five movies and five games). Any submission that wins at least one of the first five awards above or is selected to appear on the front page within the month is eligible. Each of the ten winners is sent a check of $250, a certificate, store credit in the Newgrounds store, stickers and often another prize that changes from month to month and is often supplied by sponsors. In the case that a prize is won by a Newgrounds-exclusive submission made by NG staff, the prize is passed onto the next ranked down. As of March 2009, the $250 prize has stopped in favour of revenue sharing, although in June 2010, they reintroduced a single $250 prize for the best original movie of the month. * Yearly awards (Newgrounds Tank Awards), since 2007, decided on from all the submissions in a given year by a panel of judges. Nominations consist of the top monthly winners, winners of themed contests and staff inclusions. Winners receive a heavy bronze statue featuring the Newgrounds tank logo. {| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed" width="50%" ! colspan="2"| Complete list of ''Newgrounds Tank Awards'' winners |- | rowspan="4"| 2007<ref name="tankawards2007">{{cite web|url=http://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic/914424|title=1st Annual Tank Awards winners|last=Fulp|first=Tom|date=2008-05-30|publisher=Newgrounds|accessdate=2009-10-21}}</ref> | '''Movie of the Year''': ''[[Brackenwood|Waterlollies]]'' |- | '''Game of the Year''': ''[http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/381115 NG Rumble]'' |- | '''User of the Year''': [http://luis.newgrounds.com/ Luis Castañón] |- | '''Musician of the Year''': [http://maestrorage.newgrounds.com/ Selcuk Bor] |- | rowspan="4"| 2008<ref name="tankawards2008">{{cite web|url=http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/486001|title=2nd Annual Tank Awards winners|date=2009-03-06|publisher=Newgrounds|accessdate=2009-10-21}}</ref> | '''Movie of the Year''': ''[http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/439541 Chuck's New Tux!]'' |- | '''Game of the Year''': ''[http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/420606 Fancy Pants Adventures: World 2]'' |- | '''User of the Year''': [http://renaenae.newgrounds.com/ Renae Pille] |- | '''Musician of the Year''': [http://waterflame.newgrounds.com/ Christian M.

When an artist submits their first song an administrator or audio moderator will have to review it before it gets listed. All the music is free to use (under a BY-NC-SA 3.0 [[Creative Commons]] license [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/]). Uploaded files must conform to certain requirements: * The file must have the extension [[.mp3]]. * The file may not exceed the given capacity of 15 MB ([[Megabytes]]). * The file must be sampled at 44.1 kHz. Since the 2007 redesign, the Audio Portal has become more flexible and allows artists to edit their submissions or remove them providing they haven't been used in a submission to the Flash Portal or haven't been listened to more than 3000 times.<ref>{{cite web|first=Tom|last=Fulp|url=http://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic/784696|title=User Reviews, Audio Tools, Rankings|date=2007-09-28|publisher= Newgrounds|accessdate=2008-11-20}}</ref> Icons can also be added to audio submissions. Unlike the Flash Portal, audio submissions do not face Judgment from Users but instead appear directly on the [http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/ Audio Portal Main Page]. There are also occasional contests in which money and shirts can be won. Some user-created music from the Audio Portal was used in [[The Behemoth]]'s console video games ''[[Alien Hominid]]'' and ''[[Castle Crashers]]''. More recently, The Monthly Audio Contest (MAC) has been reinstated and is now a newgrounds supported monthly official contest on newgrounds. The MACs have historically been run by notable members of the audio portal community and are considered to play and important role in fostering and strengthening the audio portal community. The main purpose of the Audio Portal was to prevent users from breaking copyright laws; users were using copyrighted songs in their submissions, thus breaking the law and running the risk of being sued.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic/50881|title=NG Audio! Go! Go! |date=2003-02-13|first=Tom|last=Fulp |publisher=Newgrounds |accessdate=2010-07-27}}</ref> Therefore, the Audio Portal was introduced so that users could submit their own original work. Animators looking for music could pick a song from a list of many different [[genre]]s ranging from [[drum and bass]] to [[jazz]], therefore all users had a good chance to get the kind of music they were looking for without breaking copyright laws.

However, over the years the Audio Portal grew from simply being a resource for the flash portal to draw music and loops from to a full blown portal with a life on it's own - with notable users using it as a nursing grounds to increase their talents and then set off in the world under major record labels. [http://f-777.newgrounds.com/ Kingbastard] and [http://f-777.newgrounds.com/ API] are two examples of this. Over time however an issue of "Zero-Voting" began to occur. Users would "zero vote" other members in order for their own songs to rise to the top. This issue was magnified with the arrival of the 2007 redesign, which allowed users to vote every day in the art portal on submissions, whilst before the redesign they could only vote once on a submission ever. This also had the unexpected backlash of users fiving up their own submissions, which resulted in a neverending loop of users needing to five their own songs to counteract the massive amount of zeros that were being dished out to their submissions by others. This led to an extreme depression
