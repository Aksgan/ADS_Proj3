[[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] on different messengers. This manual work is an annoyance that users can easily be relieved from by introducing a meaningful data exchange protocol between services. The first thing needed to accomplish this goal is a semantic representation of the online presence data which would serve as a basis for developing exchange mechanisms along the ideas outlined by the [[Data Portability|Data Portability initiative]]. The domain where OPO can make a significant contribution is the exchange of user's statuses on various IMs. OPO provides a flexible model for representing the semantics of online statuses thus making their descriptions precise and understandable for the IM platform exchanging them. Currently different IM platforms use different status scales, and when users from different platforms meet in an inter-platform [[Online chat|chat]] (on services like [[Meebo]], [[Digsby]], etc.) their original statuses are often lost. This is because currently, users’ online statuses are exchanged over the [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]] protocol, by mapping them to a semantically very poor status scale used in XMPP. In those mappings the semantics of original statuses is largely reduced. To face this issue OPO allows for precise descriptions of IM status characteristics so that they can be exchanged between platforms with their semantics fully preserved. Thus the OPO serves, in this domain, as a mediator preserving the semantics of online status scales in their exchanges, enabling more precise transfers of data between heterogeneous services. ==Example== The following OPO data (written in [[Turtle (syntax)|Turtle]] format) describes user 'darthWader' who has posted a new custom message on a [[Twitter]] microblogging service and another user 'luke' who also posted a custom message which is a reply of darthWader's one. <source lang="text"> @base <http://online-presence.net/opo/examples#>. @prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>. @prefix opo: <http://online-presence.net/opo/ns#>. @prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>. @prefix sioc: <http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#>. :datrhVaderTwitterAccount rdf:type sioc:UserAccount; foaf:accountServiceHomepage <http://www.twitter.com/>; foaf:accountName "darthVader". :datrhVaderStatus rdf:type sioc:Post; sioc:content "Luke, I am your father.". :datrhVaderPresence rdf:type opo:OnlinePresence; opo:customMessage :datrhVaderStatus; opo:startTime "2008-03-01T18:51:19"; opo:declaredOn :datrhVaderTwitterAccount. <http://starwars.net/darthVader> opo:declaresOnlinePresence :datrhVaderPresence. :lukeTwitterAccount rdf:type sioc:UserAccount; foaf:accountServiceHomepage <http://www.twitter.com/>; foaf:accountName "luke". :lukeStatus rdf:type sioc:Post; sioc:content "No...

It is very important to distinguish the static and more persistent users online properties modeled by FOAF (like name, gender, homepage, etc.) from frequently changing properties addressed by the OPO (like activities, custom message and IM status). The OPO is actually meant for representing dynamic aspects of user's profiles, and it could be said that it complements FOAF in a way. Therefore, it is quite natural that OPO is connected to FOAF through some properties (e.g. agent). ==See also== * [[FOAF|FOAF - Friend of a friend]] * [[Good Old AI]] Research Network ==External links== * [http://online-presence.net OPO Project], official website * [http://blogs.talis.com/nodalities/2008/08/opo-modelling-dynamic-online-presence.php Interview about OPO with Milan Stankovic on Nodalities Blog] ==References== {{Reflist}} [[Category:Internet architecture]] [[Category:Semantic Web]]</text> </page> <page> <id>27254</id> <title>Online Privacy Protection Act</title> <text>'''The California Online Privacy Protection Act of 2003''' ('''OPPA''')<ref>[http://leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=bpc&group=22001-23000&file=22575-22579 The Online Privacy Protection Act of 2003, Cal.

According to this law, operators of commercial websites that collect personally identifiable information from California's residents are required to conspicuously post and comply with a [[privacy policy]] that meets certain requirements. == Who must comply == This act is applicable to any individual or entity (corporation) that owns a commercial web page or an online service that collects and records confidential personal information from an individual living in [[California]], visiting such web pages. This act, however, is not applicable to [[ISP|ISP's]] or similar entities who record data upon request from a third party. In this case, confidential personal information, collected online, includes first and last names, a street address, an email address, a telephone number, a [[social security number]], or various other data which allows the tracking of a user. Personally identifiable information can include date of birth, height, weight, etc, when this information is recorded and stored online by the operator in combination with one of the above identifiers.

The privacy policy must detail the kinds of information gathered by the website, how the information may be shared with other parties, and, if such a process exists, describe the process the user can use to review and make changes to their stored information. It also must include the policy's effective date and a description of any changes since then. The owner of a website can be subject to legal actions over OPPA within 30 days of being notified for not posting the privacy policy or not meeting the law's criteria. The owner could be faulted for his negligence, possibly even consciously, over his inability to comply with the act, which ultimately results to charges filed against him for this noncompliance.<ref>Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, ''[http://www.privacyrights.org/ar/CAPrivProtAct.htm California's Online Privacy Protection Act Goes into Effect July 1: Requires Internet Merchants to Post a Privacy Policy]'' (June 28, 2004).</ref> == Consequences of non-compliance == As it does not contain enforcement provisions of its own, OPPA is expected to be enforced through California’s Unfair Competition Law (UCL)<ref>[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=bpc&group=17001-18000&file=17200-17210 Cal.
