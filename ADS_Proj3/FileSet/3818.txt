to mark ten fabulous years of Robotix. The following events were held- ===Autonomous events=== ;Xplode :An event inspired by the landmine problem that plagues several African countries today. For the event, participants were required to build two autonomous robots: a mine-detecting bot and a mine-avoiding bot. The mine-detecting bot, after mapping the entire arena transmits information regarding the location of the mines to the mine-avoiding bot. The mine-avoiding bot then traverses the whole arena in the shortest time avoiding all the mines in its path. ;Xtension :Xtension essentially required the participants to make robots capable of co-ordinating amongst themselves and traversing across a series of chasms. There was no restiction on the number of bots one could build, the only condition being that at least one robot be autonomous. ;8MileX :After the pleasant success of 8Mile in Robotix'09, team Robotix continued with India's only outdoor autonomous event and the ultimate image processing problem statement. A scaled down version of the famous Darpa Challenge, 8Milex required participants to build autonomous vehicles capable of travelling on an actual road and obeying traffic rules. ===Mechanical events=== ;TribotX Championship :It was a three-tier tournament that required participants to undertake 3 tasks over 3 days of the fest. Teams with the highest cummulative score after the first two tasks could make it to the final knock-out stage of the competition. The only information available prior to the event was a list of modules that participants might have had to use during their run. The actual problem statement was released only 12 hours before each task commenced. ;eXplore :In this under-water event, participants were required to build robots capable of releasing several light-weight balls held at different co-oridnates in a large water tank. Once this was done, the bots had to collect the balls floating on the surface and bring them to a designated area of the arena, called the victory zone. Teams were free to choose any mechanism and design to counter this difficult environment. ===Online/Programming events=== ;Xants :Xants drew its theme from the highly organised functioning of an ant-hill and aimed to incorporate the principles of swarm logic and collective intelligence. In a simulated set-up consisting of an ant colony and several energy packets distributed across the arena, where individual ants cannot sense beyond a certain range and can only leave a scent trail for other ants to follow, participants had to design an algorithm to optimise this co-ordination and procure the energy packets efficiently. ==Robotix 2009== Robotix 2009 was held between 29 January and 1 February, 2009. The following events were held- ===Autonomous events === ;8 Mile :For the first time in India, an outdoor robotics event was held. The participant had to build a completely autonomous vehicle(battery powered) which could traverse the road, and follow simple traffic rules like Stopping at a Zebra Crossing, following Traffic Light, etc. ;12 Doors Down :The Autonomous Bot is lost in a labyrinth of cells, the participant with the help of a manual bot had to guide it out of the grid, by the mechanism of an opening and closing the door. The lost bot had to be completely Autonomous. ===Programming - online events === ;MicroMouse4D :The classic robotics problem of [[micromouse|micro-mouse]] was simulated in [[Microsoft Robotics Studio]] for everyone's convenience. With no hardware problems, the participant had to just code a function in a pre-programmed template for the simulation to run. ;framED9211 :An Online [[Image Processing]] Event, that required participants to submit a code( in a language of their choice!) which could recognize the Number Plate of a fast moving car, among all the moving cars in a real life video. ===Mechanical events=== ;wEDGED :In real life Nintendo world, the task was to climb a wooden wedge while avoiding the swinging pendula, grabbing a plank by its handle and swinging on to a lower platform. It was a One-on-One competition. ;"#mEsh" :This event required participants to build a Robot that could climb up and down an inclined metallic mesh, the size of a unit square of mesh being 7cm x 7cm. ;Robo-Relay ==Robotix 2007== Robotix 2007 was held between 1 February and 4 February, 2007. The following six events were held- ===Autonomous events === ;Rail Track Inspector :In Rail Track Inspector, the participants were required to build a robot that could follow two parallel white lines, 5 [[centimetre|cm]] apart, on a black background and report errors, if any, as and when they occurred. The errors were of two types: :*The distance between the white lines differed from their specified :gap. *One of the white lines became discontinuous. :The robot was required to identify both the errors separately. ;Grid Navigator :Grid Navigator, required participants to build autonomous robots that could move in a 8x8 square maze and detect the position of obstacles placed in the maze without dislocating it. The maze was in the form of a two dimensional numbered grid. Squares were marked with white lines on a black background. The robot had to start from one end of the maze and reach the diagonally opposite end after identifying all the obstacles. The robot was free to roam in the grid in any given way. ===Programming - online events === ;Mission Mars :Mission Mars required the participants to write codes to control robot ants on a simulated Martian surface, such that it could cover the maximum area in a given time. Multiple instances of the same program were run at the same time, each being able to communicate with the other to prevent any collision, which rendered both the robots extinct. The competition gave its participants the liberty to code in either [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[C++]] or [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. ;Jigsaw :In Jigsaw, the participants were required to write a code that could solve a jumbled up picture. The picture was broken up into fragments and jumbled up using a program itself. As per the rules mentioned on the official website, the top left corner of the jumbled picture was the same as the
