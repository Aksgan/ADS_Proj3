can transfer among each other, and MAC refers to a second category of access controls that imposes constraints upon the first. == Implementations == The meaning of the term in practice is not as clear-cut as the definition given in the TCSEC standard, because TCSEC definition of DAC does not impose implementation concept. Because of this, there are at least two implementations: with owner (as widespread example) and with capabilities (as upcoming).<ref>http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/RemoveSETUID – Fedora 15 set to remove SETUID in favor of (Linux kernel) capabilities</ref> === Implementation with owner === The term DAC is commonly used in contexts that assume that every object has an ''owner'' that controls the permissions to access the object, probably because many systems do implement DAC using the concept of an owner. But the TCSEC definition does not say anything about owners, so technically an access control system doesn't have to have a concept of owner to meet the TCSEC definition of DAC. Users (owners) have under this DAC implementation the ability to make policy decisions and/or assign security attributes. A straightforward example is the [[Filesystem_permissions#Traditional_Unix_permissions|traditional Unix permissions]] with its system of users, groups and read-write-execute permissions for objects (ie. files and directories). === Implementation with capabilities === As another example, [[capability-based security|capability systems]] are sometimes described as providing discretionary controls because they permit subjects to transfer their access to other subjects, even though capability-based security is fundamentally not about restricting access "based on the identity of subjects" (capability systems do not, in general, allow permissions to be passed "to any other subject"; the subject wanting to pass its permissions must first have access to the receiving subject, and subjects do not generally have access to all subjects in the system). == See also == * [[Access control]] * [[Mandatory Access Control]] (MAC) * [[Role-Based Access Control]] (RBAC) * [[Capability-based security]] * [[XACML]] eXtensible Access Control Markup Language == References == {{reflist}} * P.

Instead of going through traditional distribution channels, which had some type of intermediate (such as a [[distribution (business)|distributor]], [[wholesaler]], broker, or [[agency (law)|agent]]), companies may now deal with every customer directly, for example via the Internet. One important factor is a drop in the cost of servicing customers directly. Disintermediation initiated by consumers is often the result of high [[market transparency]], in that buyers are aware of supply prices direct from the manufacturer. Buyers bypass the middlemen (wholesalers and retailers) in order to buy directly from the manufacturer and thereby pay less. Buyers can alternatively elect to purchase from wholesalers. Often, a [[business-to-consumer electronic commerce|B2C]] company functions as the bridge between buyer and manufacturer. To illustrate, a typical B2C supply chain is composed of four or five entities (in order): * [[Distributor (business)|Supplier]] * [[Manufacturer]] * [[Wholesaler]] * [[Retailer]] * [[Buyer]] It has been argued that the Internet modifies the supply chain due to market transparency: * Supplier * Manufacturer * Buyer ==History== The term was originally applied to the [[bank]]ing industry in about 1967: disintermediation referred to consumers investing directly in securities (government and private bonds, and stocks) rather than leaving their money in savings accounts, then later to borrowers going to the capital markets rather than to banks.(OED, Google News Archive) The original cause was a US government regulation ([[Regulation Q]]) which limited the interest rate paid on interest bearing accounts that were insured by [[FDIC]]. It was later applied more generally to "cutting out the middleman" in commerce, though the financial meaning remained predominant. Only in the late 1990s did it become widely popularized. ==Impact of Internet-related disintermediation upon various industries== ===Strong impact=== * [[Computer]] hardware and [[software]] * [[Travel agency|Travel agencies]] * [[Bookstore]]s and [[music]] stores * [[Stocks|Stock Purchasing]] see [[E-trade]] ===Still in progress (due to legal or structural obstacles)=== * [[Alcoholic beverage]]s * [[Real estate]] A real estate market is social. Buyers and sellers communicate to discover information and negotiate to exchange goods or services. Internet transparency is letting home buyers view Residential and Commercial MLS, FSBO listings on their own. It has reduced home buyers search costs, and given them access to multiple new product options to choose from when going into a real estate transaction. Also sellers have found new tools and services to attract home buyers and sell their houses, they can now leverage Internet market tools that are intended to increase the efficacy of transactional requirements. This transparency has made it difficult for Real Estate Agents, Appraisers, Lenders, etc. to collect the fees - tipping the balance of power towards the consumers. By opening access to information outside of the Brokers/Lawyers control, buyers and sellers now gain economic benefits that would be otherwise be received by market intermediaries or inappropriately distributed among the smart and connected deal makers of the financial world. * [[Prime brokerage]] for [[hedge fund]]s * Health Care - due to developments in [[eHealth]] and specifically [[Consumer Health Informatics]] * Video rental and distribution ===Failed and became niche ancillary services=== * [[Furniture]] * [[Groceries]] * Pet supplies (especially [[dog food]]) ===Discussion=== A prime example of disintermediation is [[Dell, Inc.]], which sells many of its systems direct to the consumer &mdash; thus bypassing traditional retail chains.
