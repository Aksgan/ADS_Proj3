It was a low-end microprocessor intended for low-end [[workstation]]s and [[embedded system]]s. The microprocessor was developed by Sun, but the [[floating-point unit]] (FPU) was licensed from [[Meiko Scientific]]. It contained 800,000 transistors. There were two derivatives of the microSPARC: the microSPARC-II and microSPARC-IIep. The microSPARC-IIep was a 100 MHz microSPARC-II with an integrated [[Conventional PCI|PCI]] controller for [[embedded system]]s. It was developed and fabricated by [[LSI Logic]] for Sun. The microprocessor was used by Sun in their [[JavaStation]] [[Network Computer]]. {| class="wikitable sortable" |- style="vertical-align: top; font-size: 85%;" ! Name (codename) !

In 1988 [[Intel]] made an i82310 MCA chipset. For a time, MCA could be found in the PS/2, [[RS/6000]], [[AS/400]], and even some of the [[System/370]] [[Mainframe computer|mainframes]]. However, most of these systems later were redesigned to incorporate [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]]. MCA is no longer used in new designs. == Why the interface was created == === Overview of the technology issues of that time === Micro Channel was an attempt to address, once and for all, the problems that had come to plague the PC bus (later known as [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]]). The principal design problems of ISA were: * A slow bus speed. * A limited number of interrupts, fixed in hardware. * A limited number of I/O device addresses, also fixed in hardware * Hardwired and complex configuration with no conflict resolution. * Poor grounding and power distribution. * Undocumented bus interface standards that varied between systems and manufacturers. Most of the problems were not a big issue in the early days of IBM PC computers, but came to the surface as the range of tasks and peripherals, and number of manufacturers for PCs grew. === ISA design issues === Another problem for the IBM designers was that the original ISA bus design was deeply linked to the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] architecture of the 80x86 chip family, principally the * [[Intel 8088]] * [[Intel 8086]] * [[Intel 80286]] Use of the ISA bus outside of machines employing the 80x86 cpu family was rare. Notable non-x86 hardware that used the ISA bus include the [[IBM RT/PC]] and [[BeBox]]. IBM was already investigating the use of [[RISC]] processors in desktop machines, and could, in theory, save considerable money if a single well-documented bus could be used across their entire computer lineup. === Marketshare issues === A final problem was that IBM had lost control of the hardware market for PCs. Anyone could create an ISA card and plug it into any ISA bus-equipped computer. It was thought that by creating a new standard, IBM would regain control of standards via the required
