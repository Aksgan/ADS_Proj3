However the ITC has announced that out of five patents, Nvidia did violate three of them. Due to this ruling Nvidia is facing a US import ban on some of its chips. The chips facing the US import ban are used in the nForce, Quadro, GeForce, Tesla and Tegra series video cards, nearly every video card type manufactured by Nvidia.<ref>[http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1588351/nvidia-us-import-ban Nvidia faces a US import ban ], ''The Inquirer'', January 25, 2010</ref> In January 2010, Samsung and Rambus reached an agreement under which Samsung will reimburse Rambus by a sum of 900 million dollars until 2015.

Schwartz''' (born November 22, 1961), also known as '''merlyn''', is an [[United States|American]] author, system administrator and programming consultant. ==Career== Schwartz is the co-author of several widely used books about [[Perl]], a programming language, and has written regular columns about Perl for several computer magazines. He popularized the [[Just another Perl hacker]] [[signature]] programs. He is a founding board member of the [[Perl Mongers]], the worldwide Perl grassroots advocacy organization.
