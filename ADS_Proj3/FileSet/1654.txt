This engine is capable of changing nearly any aspect of the game [[on the fly]] which allows updates without the necessity for [[downtime]], a problem of many graphical RPGs. Due to the use of the IFE, ''GemStone'' is rarely taken offline, giving a 24-hour uptime cycle aside from the occasional game [[Crash (computing)|crash]]. The ''GemStone'' interface is simply a text stream, and the game can be played with a [[Telnet]] interface after authentication. There are several official interfaces to the game, as well as several unofficial ones. The oldest interface for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] is called the "Wizard Front End" and offers several useful features such as status readouts, macros, and limited scripting abilities. The Wizard has since been superseded with the "StormFront" Front End introduced in 2003. StormFront offers several additional extensions to the game, including a "point and click" interface that allows one to click on text within the game and bring up action menus applicable to that portion of text. The Java FE and a browser-based version named "eScape" are less popular alternatives. A Wizard (similar to the Windows version) also exists for [[Macintosh Classic]], while a Front End named "Avalon" is available for [[Mac OS X]]. No official [[Linux]] client exists. ==History== ''GemStone'' was first demonstrated to GEnie in 1987 before Simutronics was officially incorporated. It was only used as a demonstration model and was never available to the general subscribers. ''GemStone ]['' was released in April 1988 to GEnie customers. However, ''GemStone ]['' was very short-lived, and ''GemStone III'' went into open beta testing in December 1989, officially launching on February 1, 1990. <ref>[http://www.washingtontechnology.com/print/12_23/13829-1.html Online Gaming Firm Attracts Fans<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The transition from "II" to "III" maintained significant portions of the environment, but not all, and character records were not maintained over the transition, requiring all players to begin anew. ''GemStone III'' evolved into ''GemStone IV'' in November 2003, but the game world and character records were maintained over the transition. ''GemStone III'' was promoted on GEnie by promising players the opportunity to receive real-life versions of gems found in-game, something that persisted for many years. ''GemStone'' originally operated with a license to use the Rolemaster game mechanics and [[Shadow World]] environment from [[Iron Crown Enterprises]] (ICE). In 1995, Simutronics and ICE agreed to let the business relationship expire, necessitating the removal of all ICE intellectual property from ''GemStone''. Many of the game changes were simply renaming ICE names, such as changing the world name from [[Kulthea]] to [[Elanthia]], and renaming the deities while keeping their previous characteristics. Game mechanics were greatly changed with the de-ICEing (as the period is colloquially named), which required every game character to undergo significant changes. Character racial and class choices were also changed, making any direct translation between the two systems difficult. The end result was that every character was required to "re-roll" their character with the option to change race and skills, but maintaining their old experience level, class, and equipment. ''GemStone'' became available on [[AOL]]<ref>{{cite book | last = Bartle | first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Bartle | title = [[Designing Virtual Worlds]] | publisher = New Riders | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-1310-1816-7 | pages = 15 | quote = AOL went for the throat and signed up Gemstone III, Dragon's Gate, and Federation II (it already had Neverwinter Nights). }}</ref> in September, 1995, just after the de-ICEing process.
