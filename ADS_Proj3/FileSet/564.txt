the 1960s, and it now has contents (transcripts, audio, and video) in over 20 languages from 130 different corpora, all of which are publicly available worldwide. Recently, CHILDES has been made into a component of the larger corpus [[TalkBank]], which also includes language data from [[aphasia|aphasics]], [[second language acquisition]], [[conversation analysis]], and classroom language learning. During the early 1990s, as computational resources capable of easily manipulating the data volumes found in CHILDES became commonly available, there was a significant increase in the number of studies of child language acquisition that made use of it.

Continuous improvement, in regard to organizational quality and performance, focuses on improving customer satisfaction through continuous and incremental improvements to processes, including by removing unnecessary activities and variations. Quality is a never ending quest and Continuous Process Improvement ([[kaizen|CPI]]) is a never ending effort to discover and eliminate the main causes of problems. It accomplishes this by using small-steps improvements, rather than implementing one huge improvement. The Japanese have a term for this called "[[kaizen]]" which involves everyone, from the hourly workers to top-management. A CIFMS is not a general software application that can be readily used for any given manufacturing company, it is a uniquely designed system specifically tailored to a given company guided by a method. Therefore the most crucial process in developing and implementing an efficient CIFMS is selecting a design method which brings forth a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDM) problem with varied degrees of interdependencies among the decision components ''(NB : the MCDM problem can be formulated so as to minimize the distance between a facility and a given set of points. The efficient points of this problem are candidates for optimal solutions to many location problems).'' A key principle of an effective '''Continuous Improvement and Focused Monitoring System''' is input and feedback from a diverse group of [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]. == Further reading == * {{cite book | title =A model for selecting a CIFMS design method | last =Hassan, Kikuo | first =Haleh, Nezu | publisher = Emerald Group Publishing Limited | date =2005 | url = | id =ISSN 1741-038X }} * {{cite book | title =Principles of Computer-Integrated Manufacturing | last =Waldner | first =Jean-Baptiste | publisher = John Wiley & Sons | date =1 edition (September, 1992) | url =http://www.amazon.com/dp/047193450X/ | id =ISBN 047193450X }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Cifms}} [[Category:Management]] [[Category:Process management]] [[Category:Quality]]</text> </page> <page> <id>5090</id> <title>CLX (Common Lisp)</title> <text>'''CLX''' is an [[X Window System]] protocol client [[library (computer science)|library]] in the [[Common Lisp|Common Lisp programming language]] (Cf.

It is planned for public release on November 1, 2010. This release is special because it updates all three CMMI models (CMMI for Development, CMMI for Services, and CMMI for Acquisition) to make them consistent and to improve their high maturity practices. The CMMI Product Team has reviewed more than 1,150 change requests for the models and 850 for the appraisal method. == Constellation Commonality == Version 1.2 of CMMI models were released in recent years. CMMI for Development was released in August 2006, CMMI for Acquisition was released in November 2007, and CMMI for Services was released in February 2009. Because of the time in between these releases, they have become inconsistent. The work
