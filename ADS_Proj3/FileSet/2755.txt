Machine translation applications have also been released for most mobile devices, including mobile telephones, pocket PCs, PDAs, etc. Due to their portability, such instruments have come to be designated as [[mobile translation]] tools enabling mobile business networking between partners speaking different languages, or facilitating both foreign language learning and unaccompanied traveling to foreign countries without the need of the intermediation of a human translator. == Evaluation == {{Main|Evaluation of machine translation}} Machine translation systems and output can be evaluated along numerous dimensions. The intended use of the translation, characteristics of the MT software, the nature of the translation process, etc., all affect how one evaluates MT systems and their output. The FEMTI taxonomy of dimensions, with associated evaluation metrics, appears at http://www.issco.unige.ch:8080/cocoon/femti/st-home.html . There are various means for evaluating the output quality of machine translation systems. The oldest is the use of human judges<ref>[http://www.morphologic.hu/public/mt/2008/compare12.htm Comparison of MT systems by human evaluation, May 2008]</ref> to assess a translation's quality. Even though human evaluation is time-consuming, it is still the most reliable way to compare different systems such as rule-based and statistical systems. [[Automate]]d means of evaluation include [[Bilingual evaluation understudy|BLEU]], [[NIST (metric)|NIST]] and [[METEOR]]. Relying exclusively on unedited machine translation ignores the fact that communication in [[natural language|human language]] is [[wikt:context|context]]-embedded and that it takes a person to comprehend the context of the original text with a reasonable degree of probability. It is certainly true that even purely human-generated translations are prone to error. Therefore, to ensure that a machine-generated translation will be useful to a human being and that publishable-quality translation is achieved, such translations must be reviewed and edited by a human.<ref>J.M. Cohen observes (p.14): "Scientific translation is the aim of an age that would reduce all activities to [[Technology|techniques]]. It is impossible however to imagine a literary-translation machine less complex than the human brain itself, with all its knowledge, reading, and discrimination."</ref> The late [[Claude Piron]] wrote that machine translation, at its best, automates the easier part of a translator's job; the harder and more time-consuming part usually involves doing extensive research to resolve [[ambiguity|ambiguities]] in the [[source text]], which the [[grammatical]] and [[lexical]] exigencies of the target language require to be resolved.<ref name="piron" /> Such research is a necessary
