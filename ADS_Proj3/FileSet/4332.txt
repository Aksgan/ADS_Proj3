''rescue dragon''}}, sometimes referred to as "HyperRescueRobot", is a five-ton, 3 meter tall (approx. 10 ft), [[Hydraulic machinery|hydraulically-operated]] [[robot]], built to cut a path through debris for rescue workers, in the wake of an earthquake or other catastrophe. It can perform heavy lifting of up to one ton, and its arms have the full range of motion available to the human arm. The Enryu was designed by the Japanese company [[Tmsuk]], and a [[prototype]] was unveiled in March, 2004 in [[Japan]]. As of 2006, the robot conducted a performance test at [[Nagaoka University of Technology]] and successfully lifted a car from a snowbank.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enryu.jp/t52/index.html|title=レスキューロボット 「援竜」豪雪地帯で初の雪害対策実験：報告|date=2006-02-06|publisher=Tmsuk|language=Japanese|accessdate=2009-01-25}}</ref> TMSUK developed the robot in cooperation with [[Kyoto University]], the [[Kitakyushu]] Fire Department and Japan's National Research Institute of Fire and Disaster in Tokyo. The 3.5 metre-tall robot can either be driven from a [[cockpit]] positioned at the front of the robot or it can be controlled remotely as like its cousin the Banryu, it contains multiple CCD cameras which transmit to the remote driver - in this case, it has seven 6.8-megapixel CCD cams mounted on its "head", "torso" and "arms". ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== * {{official|http://www.enryu.jp/t52/index.html}} {{jp icon}} {{robot-stub}} [[Category:Rescue and protection robots]] [[Category:Prototype robots]]</text> </page> <page> <id>36604</id> <title>T.

Prior to his appointment as Director of the Marshall Center, Lee had been Marshall's deputy director since December 1980, after seven years as manager of the [[Spacelab]] program at the Center. From July to September 1986 he was also acting director of the Center. In addition to his responsibilities as deputy director, Lee was manager of the Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle Definition Office, NASA's effort to define and develop a heavy lift launch vehicle capable of meeting national requirements. [[Image:ThomasJackLee2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Thomas J. Lee holding a model of the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].]] Lee began his professional career in 1958 as an aeronautical research engineer with the [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency|U.S. Army Ballistic Missile Agency]] at the [[Redstone Arsenal]]. He transferred to the Marshall Center when it was formed in 1960 as a systems engineer with the Center's Centaur Resident Manager Office in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]]. From 1963 to 1965 he was Resident Project Manager for the Pegasus Meteoroid Detection Satellite Project in [[Blandenburg, Maryland]], and from 1965 to 1969 was chief of the Center's Saturn Program Resident Office at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] in Florida. From 1969 to 1973 he was assistant to the technical deputy director of the Marshall Center. He then became deputy manager and manager of the Sortie Lab Task Team, and continued as manager when that team became the Spacelab Program Office in 1974. As manager of the Spacelab Program Office he was responsible for NASA's work with the [[European Space Agency]] in the development of Spacelab, a multi-purpose reusable laboratory for Earth orbital science activities.

The name is an [[acronym]] for "Text Adventure Development System". ==History== The original TADS 1 was released by [[High Energy Software]] as [[shareware]] in the late 1980s, and was followed by TADS 2 not long after. In the early 1990s, TADS established itself as the number one development tool for [[interactive fiction]], in place of simpler systems like AGT ([[Adventure Game Toolkit]]).{{Fact|date=November 2008}} In the late 1990s, it was joined by [[Inform]] as the most popular interactive fiction development language. TADS 2 syntax is based on [[C (programming language)|C]], with bits of [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]. TADS 2 has been maintained and updated at regular intervals by its creator, Michael J. Roberts, even after it became freeware in July 1996. Graham Nelson, creator of Inform, describes Inform and TADS as the "only two systems... widely used" in the last half of the 1990s<ref name="DM4">{{cite web | url = http://www.inform-fiction.org/manual/html/s46.html#p369 | title = DM4 §46: A short history of interactive fiction | accessdate = 2007-09-03 | year = 2001 | month = 07 | last = Nelson | first = Graham | work = The Inform Designer's Manual }} </ref>, and TADS has been called "The second most commonly used IF programming language today"<ref name="Maher">{{cite web | url = http://maher.filfre.net/if-book/if-8.htm | title = Chapter
