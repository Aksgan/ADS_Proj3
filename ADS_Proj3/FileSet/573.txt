the overall computer performance. With the advent of multiple busses, parallel processing, [[Computer multitasking|multiprogramming]], [[preemption (computing)|preemptive]] scheduling, advanced [[graphics cards]], advanced [[sound cards]] and generally, more decentralized loads, it became less likely to identify one particular component as always being a [[Bottleneck (engineering)|bottleneck]]. It is likely that a computer's bottleneck shifts rapidly between components. Furthermore, in modern computers it is possible to have 100% CPU utilization with minimal impact to another component. Finally, tasks required of modern computers often emphasize quite different components, so that resolving a bottleneck for one task may not affect the performance of another. For these reasons, upgrading a CPU does not always have a dramatic effect. The concept of being CPU bound is now one of many factors considered in modern computer performance. ==References== {{Unreferenced|date=April 2007}} [[Category:Central processing unit]]</text> </page> <page> <id>5186</id> <title>CPU card</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=February 2009}} A '''CPU card''' is a [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) that contains the [[central processing unit]] (CPU) of a computer. CPU cards are specified by CPU clock frequency and bus type as well as other features and applications built in to the card. CPU cards include [[peripheral component interconnect]] (PCI) cards, modular [[PC card]]s, [[industry standard architecture]] (ISA) cards, PCI extensions for instrumentation ([[PXI]]) cards, [[ETX (form factor)|embedded technology extended (ETX)]] cards, and many others. CPU cards are often used to expand the memory, speed, bandwidth, or embedded applications of an existing computer system. PC cards are typically used to expand a system’s embedded applications. PC cards include modules for audio and video applications, data communications, and embedded storage. PXI cards are used for data acquisition and control systems, making them suitable for real-time measurement applications. ETX cards are used in industrial applications to augment a computer system’s embedded applications. ETX cards contain all the functionality necessary to run the PC in a compact space. CPU cards that are used to augment existing computer backplanes typically have ISA or PCI connectors, and can be plugged into the [[backplane]] without any additional configuration. CPU cards for use in computer backplanes are typically half-sized. The CPU card contains the PC functionality and communicates with the other cards plugged into the backplane through a computer bus. CPU cards may also be called expansion cards or expansion boards, and offer a variety of embedded applications from modems and wireless networking to graphics and video controllers to [[RAID]] controllers. == External links == * [http://embedded-computer-systems.globalspec.com/LearnMore/Industrial_Computers_Embedded_Computer_Components/Embedded_Systems/CPU_Cards Resource Page on CPU cards] [[Category:Central processing unit]] {{Compu-hardware-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>5192</id> <title>CPU power dissipation</title> <text>'''Central processing unit power dissipation''' or '''CPU power dissipation''' is the process in which [[central processing unit]]s (CPUs) consume [[electrical energy]], and dissipate this energy both by the action of the switching devices contained in the CPU (such as [[transistor]]s or [[vacuum tube]]s) and by the energy lost in the form of [[heat]] due to the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the [[electronic circuit]]s. Designing CPUs that perform these tasks [[Energy conversion efficiency|efficiently]] without [[thermal shock|overheating]] is a major consideration in nearly all CPU manufacturers to date. Some implementations of CPUs use very little power, for example, the CPUs in [[mobile phone]]s often use just a few hundred [[watt|milliwatts]] of electricity. Some [[Microcontrollers]], used in [[embedded systems]] may use a few milliwatts. In comparison, CPUs in general purpose [[personal computer]]s, such as [[desktop computer|desktops]] and [[laptop]]s, dissipate significantly more power because of their higher complexity and speed. These microelectronic CPUs may consume power in the order of a few watts to hundreds of watts. Historically, early CPUs implemented with [[vacuum tube]]s consumed power in the order of many [[kilowatt]]s. CPUs for desktop computers typically use a significant portion of the power consumed by the [[computer]]. Other major uses include fast [[video card]]s, which contain [[graphics processing unit]]s, and the [[Power supply unit (computer)|power supply]]. In laptops, the [[LCD]] back light also uses a significant portion of overall power. While [[power management|energy-saving features]] have been instituted in personal computers for when they are idle, the overall consumption of today's high-performance CPUs is considerable. This is in strong contrast with the much lower energy consumption of CPUs designed for low-power environments. One such CPU, the [[Intel XScale]], can run at 600 [[Megahertz|MHz]] with only half a watt of power, whereas [[x86]] PC processors from Intel in the same performance bracket consume roughly eighty times as much energy.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} <!-- I'm only about 98% sure of this --> There are some engineering reasons for this pattern. * For a given device, operating at a higher [[clock rate]] always requires more power. Reducing the clock rate of the microprocessor through [[power management]] when possible reduces energy consumption. * New features generally require more [[transistor]]s, each of which uses power. Turning unused areas off saves energy, such as through [[clock gating]]. * As a processor model's design matures, smaller transistors, lower-voltage structures, and design experience may reduce energy consumption. Processor manufacturers usually release two power consumption numbers for a CPU: * ''typical thermal power'', which is measured under normal load. (for instance, AMD's [[Average CPU power]]) * ''maximum thermal power'', which is measured under a worst-case load. For example, the Pentium 4 2.8 GHz has 68.4 W typical thermal power and 85 W maximum thermal power. When the CPU is idle, it will draw far less than the typical thermal power. The power consumed by a CPU with a [[capacitance]] ''C'', running at frequency ''f'' and voltage ''V'' is approximately<ref>{{Citation |title=Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology for the Intel Pentium M Processor - White Paper |publisher=[[Intel Corporation]] |date=March 2004 |url=ftp://download.intel.com/design/network/papers/30117401.pdf}}</ref> :<math>P = C V^2 f.</math> [[Datasheet]]s normally contain the [[thermal design power]] (TDP), which is the maximum amount of power the [[computer cooling|cooling system]] in a computer is required to dissipate. Both Intel and [[Advanced Micro Devices]] (AMD) have defined TDP as the maximum power consumption for thermally significant periods running worst-case non-synthetic workloads. Thus, TDP is not the actual maximum power of the processor. In many applications, the CPU and other components are idle much of the time, so idle power contributes
