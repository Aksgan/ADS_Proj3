"[[Everybody (Madonna song)|Everybody]]" was released on October 6, 1982, as the debut single. Musically incorporating R&B infused beats, the song portrayed the image of Madonna as a black artist, since her picture did not appear on the single cover.<ref name="rikky12"/> However this misconception was cleared later when Madonna convinced Sire executives to allow her to shoot a music video for the song. The low-budget music video directed by Ed Steinberg portrayed Madonna and her friends singing and dancing in a club to the song. The video helped to promote the song and Madonna as an artist further.<ref>{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=332}}</ref> Critically the song did not receive any acclaim and failed to enter the official ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart, but charted on its dance charts.<ref>{{harvnb|Fouz-Hernández|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=66}}</ref> "[[Burning Up]]" was as the album's second single on March 9, 1983, in some countries as an A-side single with "Physical Attraction". It received mixed reviews from contemporary critics and authors, who noted the song's darker, urgent composition while praising its dance beats.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="ew"/> The single failed to do well commercially anywhere, except the dance chart in the United States, where it peaked at three, and the Australian Charts, where it was a top twenty hit.<ref name="kent"/> The accompanying music video of the song portrayed Madonna in the classic submissive female positions, while writhing in passion on an empty road, for her lover who appeared to come from her behind on a car. The video ended showing Madonna driving the car instead, thereby concluding that she was always in charge.<ref>{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=756}}</ref> "[[Holiday (Madonna song)|Holiday]]" was released as the third single on September 7, 1983. Commercially, the song was Madonna's first hit single when it entered the top twenty of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] while peaking its dance chart.<ref name="bb">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100?chartDate=1984-02-04&order=timeon|title=The Billboard Hot 100: Week Ending February 4, 1984|date=1984-02-04|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|accessdate=2009-07-03}}</ref> The song was also a crossover success, entering the top ten and top forty of many European countries.

Contemporary critics and authors applauded the song, calling it as harmonically the most complex song from the ''Madonna'' album and complimenting the [[dance-pop]] nature of the song. "Borderline" became Madonna's first top ten song on the Hot 100, peaking at ten. Elsewhere, the song reached the top twenty of a number of European nations while peaking the chart in Ireland.<ref name="dean">{{harvnb|Dean|2003|p=523}}</ref>
