or [[non-breaking space]] between the words, instead of regular spaces. ==Word wrapping in text containing Chinese, Japanese, and Korean== In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Korean language|Korean]], each [[Han character]] is normally considered a word, and therefore word wrapping can usually occur before and after any Han character. Under certain circumstances, however, word wrapping is not desired. For instance, * word wrapping might not be desired within personal names, and * word wrapping might not be desired within any compound words (when the text is flush left but only in some styles). Most existing word processors and [[typesetting]] software cannot handle either of the above scenarios. [[CJK]] punctuation may or may not follow rules similar to the above-mentioned special circumstances. It is up to [[Line breaking rules in East Asian language|line breaking rules in CJK]]. A special case of line breaking rules in CJK, however, always applies: line wrap must never occur inside the CJK dash and ellipsis. Even though each of these punctuation marks must be represented by two characters due to a limitation of all existing [[character encoding]]s, each of these are intrinsically a single punctuation mark that is two [[em (typography)|em]]s wide, not two one-em-wide punctuation marks. ==Algorithm== Word wrapping is an optimization problem. Depending on what needs to be optimized for, different algorithms are used. === Minimum length === A simple way to do word wrapping is to use a [[greedy algorithm]] that puts as many words on a line as possible, then moving on to the next line to do the same until there are no more words left to place. This method is used by many modern word processors, such as [[Open Office]] and [[Microsoft Word]]. This algorithm is optimal in that it always puts the text on the minimum number of lines. The following pseudocode implements this algorithm: SpaceLeft := LineWidth for each Word in Text if Width(Word) > SpaceLeft insert line break before Word in Text SpaceLeft := LineWidth - Width(Word) else SpaceLeft := SpaceLeft - (Width(Word) + SpaceWidth) Where <code>LineWidth</code> is the width of a line, <code>SpaceLeft</code> is the remaining width of space on the line to fill, <code>SpaceWidth</code> is the width of a single space character, <code>Text</code> is the input text to iterate over and <code>Word</code> is a word in this text. === Minimum raggedness === A different algorithm, used in [[TeX]], minimizes the square of the space at the end of lines to produce a more aesthetically pleasing result. The algorithm above is not optimal with respect to this, as the following example demonstrates: aaa bb cc ddddd If the cost function of a line is defined by the remaining space squared, the greedy algorithm would yield a sub-optimal solution for the problem (for simplicity, consider a [[fixed-width]] font and line width 6): ------ Line width: 6 aaa bb Remaining space: 0 (cost = 0 squared = 0) cc Remaining space: 4 (cost = 4 squared = 16) ddddd Remaining space: 1 (cost = 1 squared = 1) Summing to a total cost of 17, while an optimal solution would look like this: ------ Line width: 6 aaa Remaining space: 3 (cost = 3 squared = 9) bb cc Remaining space: 1 (cost = 1 squared = 1) ddddd Remaining space: 1 (cost = 1 squared = 1) The difference here is that the first line is broken before <code>bb</code> instead of after it, yielding a better right margin and a lower cost 11. To solve the problem we need to define a cost function <math>c(i, j)</math> that computes the cost of a line consisting of the words <math>\text{Word}[i]</math> to <math>\text{Word}[j]</math> from the text: :<math>c(i, j) = \left(\text{LineWidth}-(j-i)\cdot\text{OneSpaceWidth}-\sum_{k=i}^j \text{WidthOf}(\text{Word}[k])\right)^P.</math> Where <math>P</math> typically is <math>2</math> or <math>3</math>. There are some special cases to consider: If the result is negative (that is, the sequence of words cannot fit on a line), the cost needs to reflect the cost of [[Tracking (typography)|tracking]] or condensing the text to fit; if that is not possible, it needs to return <math>\infty</math>. The cost of the optimal solution can be defined as a [[recurrence]]: :<math>f(j) = \begin{cases} c(1, j) & \text{if } c(1, j) < \infty, \\ \displaystyle \min_{1 \leq k < j} \big(f(k) + c(k + 1, j)\big) & \text{if } c(1, j) = \infty. \end{cases}</math> This can be efficiently implemented using [[dynamic programming]], for a time and space complexity of <math>O(j^2)</math>. == See also == * [[Word divider]] * [[Non-breaking space]] * [[Zero-width space]] == External links == === Knuth's algorithm === * [http://defoe.sourceforge.net/folio/knuth-plass.html "Knuth & Plass line-breaking Revisited"] * [http://oedipus.sourceforge.net/texlib/ "tex_wrap": "Implements TeX's algorithm for breaking paragraphs into lines."] Reference: "Breaking Paragraphs into Lines", D.E.
