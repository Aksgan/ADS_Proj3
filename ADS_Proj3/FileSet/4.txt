will. It was purely an educational toy with cartridges focusing on such subjects as Math, Science and languages. The cartridges were also color coded to let kids know what group of subject it belonged to. The toy was first released in 2002 by [[Fisher-Price]]. It produced a total profit of over $70 million. Spin-off characters included ''Toby the Totbot'', which focused specifically on teaching letters and numbers, and ''Fetch the Phonicsbot'' which was a dog-shaped robot holding a letter board which was aimed at the toddler age group. ==See also== *[[Talk 'n Play]], a children's cassette player that also used the four audio tracks for "interactivity" with cassette/book sets ==External links== *[http://www.2xlrobot.com/ World of 2-XL] An extensive source on anything regarding 2-XL and its inventor, Dr. Michael J.

The key is put in the array position with the fewer (colliding) keys. Some [[collision resolution scheme]] is needed, unless keys are kept in buckets. The [[average-case cost]] of a successful search is [[Big O notation|O(2 + (m-1)/n)]], where m is the number of keys and n is the size of the array. The most collisions is <math>\log_2 \ln n + \theta(m/n)</math> with high probability. ==See also== *[[2-left hashing]] {{DADS|2-choice hashing|twoChoiceHashing}} [[Category:Hashing]]</text> </page> <page> <id>59</id> <title>20-GATE</title> <text>'''20-Gate''' is an [[algebra]]ic [[programming language]] developed at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] around 1965, for the [[Bendix G-20]] computer. ==External links== *[http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/showlanguage.prx?exp=216 HOPL entry] {{Computer algebra systems}} {{FOLDOC}} [[Category:Computer algebra systems]] {{compu-lang-stub}} [[hr:20-GATE]] [[ms:20-GATE]] [[sr:20-GATE]]</text> </page> <page> <id>71</id> <title>24-bit</title> <text>{{for|24-bit color model in digital images|Truecolor}} {{Unreferenced|date=October 2009}} {{N-bit|24|(3 octets)}} The IBM [[System/360]], announced in 1964, was a popular computer system with 24-bit addressing and [[32-bit]] general registers and arithmetic. The early 1980s saw the first popular personal computers, including the IBM [[PC/AT]] with an Intel [[80286]] processor using 24-bit addressing and 16-bit general registers and arithmetic, and the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[Macintosh 128k]] with a Motorola [[68000]] processor featuring 24-bit addressing and 32-bit registers. The [[eZ80]] is a microprocessor and microcontroller with 24-bit registers and addressing that is binary compatible with the 8/16-bit [[Z80]]. {{CPU technologies}} {{DEFAULTSORT:24-Bit}} [[es:24 bits]] [[ko:24비트]] [[ms:24-bit]] [[ja:24ビット]] [[pl:Architektura 24-bitowa]] [[pt:24 bits]]</text> </page> <page> <id>75</id> <title>26-bit</title> <text>{{N-bit|26|}} In the [[ARM Limited|ARM]] [[ARM_architecture|processor architecture]], '''26-bit''' refers to the design used in the original ARM processors, where the [[Program Counter]] ('''PC''') and [[Status_register|Processor Status Register]] ('''PSR''') were combined into one 32-bit [[Processor_registers|register]] (R15), the status flags filling the high 6 bits and the Program Counter taking up the lower 26 bits. In fact, because the program counter is always word-aligned the lowest two bits are always zero which allowed the designers to reuse these two bits to hold the processor's mode bits too. The four modes allowed were USR26, SVC26, IRQ26, FIQ26; contrast this with the 32 possible modes available when the program status was separated from the program counter in more recent [[ARM Architecture|ARM architectures]]. This design enabled more efficient [[Computer_program|program]] execution, as the Program Counter and status flags could be saved and restored with a single operation. This resulted in faster [[subroutine]] calls and [[interrupt]] response than traditional designs, which would have to do two register loads or saves when calling or returning from a subroutine. ==History== Despite being [[32-bit]] internally, processors prior to the ARM6 had only a 26-bit PC and [[address bus]], and were consequently limited to 64 MB of addressable [[Random_Access_Memory|memory]]. This was still a vast amount of memory at the time, but because of this limitation, architectures since have included various steps away from the original 26-bit design. The ARM6 introduced a 32-bit PC and separate PSR, as well as a 32-bit address bus, allowing 4 GB of memory to be addressed. The change in the PC/PSR layout caused incompatibility with code written for previous architectures, so the processor also included a 26-bit compatibility mode which used the old PC/PSR combination. The processor could still address 4 GB in this mode, but could not [[Execution_(computers)|execute]] anything above address 3FFFFFC (64 MB). This mode was used by [[RISC OS]] running on the [[Risc_PC|Acorn Risc PC]] to utilise the new processors while retaining compatibility with existing software. More recent ARM architectures such as [[Intel]]'s [[XScale]] have dropped the 26-bit mode altogether. ==External links== *[http://web.archive.org/web/20070809230809/http://www.arm.com/pdfs/Apps11vC.html Differences Between ARM6 and Earlier ARM Processors] *[http://www.iyonix.com/32bit/download/32bit_dev.pdf "Using the Acorn C/C++ Development Environment to write 32-bit RISC OS software"] - Details on the architectural changes and converting code between 26-bit and 32-bit. * http://www.heyrick.co.uk/assembler/32bit.html - Information on converting assembler to 32-bit [[Category:ARM architecture]]</text> </page> <page> <id>101</id> <title>360voice</title> <text>{{Infobox Website | name = 360voice.com | logo = | screenshot = | caption = | url = http://360voice.gamerdna.com/ | alexa = 18,503 | commercial = No | type = [[Blog publishing system|Blog host]] | language = English | registration = Optional (free) to view blogs / required (free) to obtain a blog | owner = [[GamerDNA|GamerDNA Inc.]] | author = Trapper Markelz and Steve Sopp | launch date = April 17, 2006 | current status = active | revenue = | slogan = Give your [[Xbox 360|Xbox]] its own blog }} '''360voice''' is a website where gamers can read or subscribe via [[RSS]] to a [[blog]] about what their friends are doing every day on [[Xbox Live]], including tracking gameplay and issuing [[gamerscore]] challenges.
