industry. The ATLAS is a product of Rediffusion Simulation in [[Sussex]], [[England]], now owned by [[Thomson-CSF]]. The ATLAS was derived from military flight simulation technology. It uses six hydraulic actuators to provide a broad range of movement. In the later half of the 1980s, Disney used this technology for two amusement rides, [[Star Tours]] at [[Disneyland]] (and later [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]], [[Tokyo Disneyland]], and [[Disneyland Paris]]), and [[Body Wars]] at [[EPCOT Center]]. The Disney attractions feature large, 40-person cabins hidden from outside view, arranged lengthwise with four or six simulators per installation. There are four simulators at Disneyland's Star Tours and EPCOT's Body Wars, while the remaining Star Tours installations have six. Body Wars is now defunct and planned for removal with the closure of the [[Wonders of Life]] pavilion.

Advanced control describes a practice which draws elements from many disciplines ranging from control engineering, signal processing, statistics, decision theory and artificial intelligence == Overview == Advanced process control is composed of different kinds of [[process control]] tools, for example: * [[Model predictive control]] (MPC), * [[Statistical process control]] (SPC), * Run2Run (R2R), * Fault detection and classification (FDC), * [[sensor|Sensor control]] and * [[feedback|Feedback systems]]. APC applications are often used for solving multivariable control or discrete control problems. Normally an APC system is connected to a [[distributed control system]] (DCS). The APC application will calculate moves that are sent to regulatory controllers. Historically the interfaces between DCS and APC systems were dedicated software interfaces. Nowadays the communication protocol between these system is managed via the industry standard [[OLE for process control]] (OPC) protocol. == Advanced process control: Topics == === APC industries === *APC can be found in the (petro)chemical industries where it makes it possible to control multivariable control problems. Since these controllers contain the dynamic relationships between variables it can predict in the future how variables will behave. Based on these predictions, actions can be taken now to maintain variables within their limits. APC is used when the models can be estimated and do not vary too much. *In the complex [[semiconductor industry]] where several hundred steps with multiple re-entrant possibilities occurs, APC plays an important role for control the overall production. APC is more and more used in other industries. In the mining industry for example, successful applications of APC (often combine to Fuzzy Logic) have been successfully implemented. In the mining industry, the models change and APC implementation is more complex. === Terminology === Manipulated Variables (MVs) are variables where advanced controllers send setpoints to. Controlled variables (CVs) are variables that normally need to be controlled between limits. Disturbance variables (DVs) are only used as an input to the controller, they cannot be influenced, but when measured contribute to the predictability of the CV. == References == {{Unreferenced|date=September 2007}} == External links == *[http://lorien.ncl.ac.uk/ming/advcontrl/apc.htm Article] about Advanced Process Control. *[http://hpsweb.honeywell.com/Cultures/en-US/NewsEvents/NewsRoom/PressReleases/PasAcquisition_PR_013007.htm Press Release].

For deterministic algorithms, the adversary is the same, the adaptive offline adversary. For randomized online algorithms competitiveness can depend upon the adversary model used. ==Common adversaries== The three common adversaries are the oblivious adversary, the adaptive online adversary, and the adaptive offline adversary. The '''oblivious adversary''' is sometimes referred to as the weak adversary. This adversary knows the algorithm's code, but does not get to know the randomized results of the algorithm. The '''adaptive online adversary''' is sometimes called the medium adversary. This adversary must make its own decision before it is allowed to know the decision of the algorithm. The '''adaptive offline adversary''' is sometimes called the strong adversary. This adversary knows everything, even the random number generator. This adversary is so strong that randomization does not help against him. ==Important results== From S. Ben-David, A. Borodin, [[Richard Karp|R. Karp]], G. Tardos, A. Wigderson we have: * If there is a randomized algorithm that is α-competitive against any adaptive offline adversary then there also exists an α-competitive deterministic algorithm. * If G is a c-competitive randomized algorithm against any adaptive online adversary, and there is a randomized d-competitive algorithm against any oblivious adversary, then G is a randomized (c * d)-competitive algorithm against any adaptive offline adversary. ==See also== * [[Competitive analysis (online algorithm)]] * [[K-server problem]] * [[Online algorithm]] ==References== *{{cite book | authorlink = Allan Borodin | author = Borodin, A. | coauthors = El-Yaniv, R. | url = http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~rani/book.html | title = Online Computation and Competitive Analysis | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1998 | isbn = 978-0-521-56392-5}} * {{cite journal | author= S.
