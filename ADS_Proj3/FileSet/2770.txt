Its popularity ensured it was republished in five [[Latin]] editions within ten years, with translations into [[Italian language|Italian]] (1560), [[French language|French]], (1565) and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] (1566) printed. ''Natural Magic'' was revised and considerably expanded throughout the author's lifetime; its twenty books (Naples 1589) include observations upon [[geology]], [[optics]], [[medicine]]s, [[poison]]s, [[cooking]], [[metallurgy]] and [[magnetism]] as well as [[cosmetics]], [[perfume]]s, [[gunpowder]] and [[invisible writing]]. ''Natural Magic'' is a fine example of pre-[[Francis Bacon|Baconian]] science. Its sources include the ancient world learning of [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Theophrastus]] as well as numerous scientific observations made by Della Porta. ''Natural Magic'' was translated and published in the [[English language]] in 1658. ==External links== *[http://homepages.tscnet.com/omard1/jportat3.html Natural Magic online] [[Category:1558 books]] [[Category:Science books]] {{sci-hist-stub}} [[it:Magiae naturalis sive de miraculis rerum naturalium]]</text> </page> <page> <id>23236</id> <title>Magic-Pro</title> <text>'''Magic-Pro''' ([[Traditional Chinese character|Traditional Chinese]]: 輝煌資訊智能有限公司) is a major computer equipment manufacturer based in [[Hong Kong]].

With the aid of a preferences program, the user of an application has the ability to customize the outfit according to personal taste. The Magic User Interface ('''MUI''' in short) was written for [[AmigaOS]] and gained popularity amongst both programmers and users. It has been ported to [[PowerPC]] processors and adopted as the default GUI toolkit of the [[MorphOS]] operating system. The MUI application programmer interface has been cloned by the [[Zune (GUI toolkit)|Zune]] toolkit used in the [[AROS|AROS Research Operating System]].<ref>http://aros.sourceforge.net/documentation/developers/zune-application-development.php</ref> ==History== [[Image:AmbientDesktop.png|thumb|300px|A screenshot of the MUI based [[Ambient (desktop environment)|Ambient]] desktop.]] Creating GUI applications on Amiga was difficult for a very long time. Mainly because the programmer got only a minuscule amount of support from the operating system. Beginning with Kickstart 2.0, the gadtools.library was a step in the right direction, however, even using this library to generate complex and flexible interfaces remained difficult and still required a great deal of patience. The largest problem in existing tools for the creation of user interfaces was the inflexible output. Most of the programs were still using built-in fonts and window sizes, thus making the use of new high resolution graphics hardware adapters nearly unbearable. Even the preference programs on the Workbench were still only using the default fixed width font. In 1992 Stefan Stuntz started developing new object oriented GUI toolkit for Amiga. Main goals for new GUI toolkit were: * ''Font sensitivity'' Possible for the font to be set in every application. * ''Changeable window sizes'' Windows have a sizing gadget which allows users to change the window size until it suits their needs * ''Flexibility'' Elements can be changed by the user regarding their own personal tastes. * ''Controlling by keyboard'' Widgets can be controlled by the keyboard as well as by the mouse. * ''System integration'' Every program has a REXX port and can be iconified or uniconified by pushing a gadget or by using the Commodities exchange program. * ''Adjusting to its environment''
