These include the difficulty of agreeing on what and how to measure, where to set performance standards, variations due to customer expectation, the relative “intangibility” of services, and so on<ref name="Pyzdek">{{cite book|author = Thomas Pyzdek|title='''Pyzdek’s Guide to SPC: Volume Two Applications and Special Topics'''|year=1992|publisher=Quality Publishing | location = Tucson, AZ| pages = 165–196}}</ref>. In spite of the difficulties, a growing number of published examples illustrate how to apply many traditional engineering tools to the sales process, including the application of process mapping, simulation, design of experiments, statistical process control, the analysis/reduction of constraints, inventive problem solving, and, given the central importance of human behavior, applied behavior analysis, among others. Each of these tools is connected with well-known engineering goals, including cause-effect analysis, variability reduction, waste reduction, bottleneck reduction, and the theory of inventive problem solving; the literature frequently cites an overarching goal of improving customer satisfaction. ==Resources for underlying observational data== One of the difficulties faced by researchers and practitioners in any field is a lack of facts; in competitive arenas, important facts are often deliberately hidden or obscured for reasons of confidentiality. This reality can also retard advancement. In spite of this, a number of “fact books” exist that offer a wealth of basic information germane to sales process engineering, usually specific to a particular form of medium or industry, some of which are available online. Examples include information pertaining to: * direct marketing (e.g., '''Direct Marketing Association’s Statistical Fact Book''')<ref name="DMA">{{cite book|author = Direct Marketing Association|title='''DMA's Statistical Fact Book, 30th Edition'''| publisher=Direct Marketing Association|location = New York, NY|year=2008}}</ref> * radio advertising (e.g., '''Radio Advertising Bureau's Radio Marketing Guide and Fact Book''') (http://www.rab.com/public/mediafacts/2007RMGFB-150.pdf) * life insurance (e.g., '''ACLI’s Fact Book''') (http://www.acli.com/ACLI/Tools/Industry+Facts/Life+Insurers+Fact+Book/GR08-108.htm) * US agriculture (e.g., '''USDA's Agriculture Fact Book''') (http://www.usda.gov/factbook/) and government-sponsored statistical abstracts (e.g., '''Statistical Abstract of the United States''') (http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/). ==Examples of application== Another difficulty faced by engineers and students in any field is the difficulty of finding examples of how to apply the principles involved. In the case of sales process engineering, a number of books and articles have been written on various facets pertaining to the subject, including: * application of experimental design in marketing<ref name="Ledolter">{{cite book|author = Johannes Ledolter and Arthur Swersey|title='''Testing 1 - 2 - 3: Experimental Design with Applications in Marketing and Service Operations'''|publisher=Stanford Business Books|location = Stanford,CA|year=2007}}</ref> * application of statistical process control to sales figures<ref name="Wheeler">{{cite book|author = Donald J.

The label “sales process engineering” is not trademarked or copyrighted. Except that of the discipline of engineering itself, the term connotes no bias toward one philosophy/school-of-thought or another. Therefore, one of the chief contributions of sales process engineering ''per se'' is that the very concept can provide those who must plan systems, implement projects, and maintain improvement, with an organized frame of reference based on techniques that have helped other, better-established, disciplines to progress. Serious practitioners have begun to emphasize "three core principles"<ref>Todd Youngblood (2004). '''The Dolphin And The Cow - How To Sell More Faster With Sales Process Engineering'''. Acworth, GA, The YPS Group, Inc. Back Cover</ref> of sales process engineering in an effort to broaden the appeal of the discipline to a wider range of sales executives. These principles are: 1) Continuous improvement of the sales process is a fundamental necessity 2) Metrics are required to judge the rate and degree of improvement 3) A well-defined sales process is a pre-requisite for determining meaningful sales metrics. ==See also== For further information, see: * [[applied behavior analysis]] and [[behavioral psychology]] * [[design of experiments]] * [[Demand chain]] * [[industrial engineering]] * [[Sales management]] * [[process improvement]] * [[simulation]] * [[six sigma]] * [[statistical process control]] * [[theory of constraints]] * "[[TRIZ]]," or theory of inventive problem solving * [[quality management]]. ==References== {{reflist|2}} <!--Categories--> [[Category:Business process]] [[Category:Customer experience management]] [[Category:Engineering disciplines]] [[Category:Marketing]] [[Category:Process management]] [[Category:Sales]] [[Category:Quality management]] [[ar:هندسة عملية البيع]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33130</id> <title>Salto (software)</title> <text>'''Salto''' is a [[software]] title for creating interactive applications. It is developed by [[Alterface]]. Salto is a real-time interaction engine, not a content authoring tool. It makes use of pre-existing contents (images, sounds, movies, 3D scenes) created with other tools from the market ([[3D Studio Max]], [[Adobe Photoshop]], [[Adobe Premiere]] etc.). Salto added-value is its capacity to integrate any type of [[sensor]] and [[actuator]], which makes it a [[software engine]] from which many interactive systems can be devised, from interactive kiosks to interactive shows and theaters. Suffering from a lack of user-friendliness for non programmers, Salto is a flexible and powerful tool which allows to quickly create astounding interactions without needing to start from scratch every time. The tool will become of more interest to non programmers when an authoring tool will be available. == Software Description == Salto is a
