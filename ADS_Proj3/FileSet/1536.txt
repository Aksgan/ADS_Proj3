powerful clients available in performance per client (as of March 11, 2009, GPU clients accounted for over 60% of the entire project's throughput at an approximate ratio of 9 clients per teraFLOP).<ref name="osstats"/> On April 10, 2008, the second generation Windows GPU client was released to open beta testing, supporting ATI/AMD's Radeon HD 2000 and HD 3000 series, and also debuting a new core (GROGPU2 - Core 11). Inaccuracies with DirectX were cited as the main reason for the migration to the new version (the original GPU client was officially retired June 6, 2008<ref>{{cite web |url = http://folding.typepad.com/news/2008/06/gpu1-has-been-retired-gpu2-for-nvidia-release-nearing.html | title=Folding@home: GPU1 has been retired, GPU2 for NVIDIA release nearing}}</ref>), which uses AMD/ATI's [[Compute Abstraction Layer|CAL]]. On June 17, 2008, a version of the second-generation Windows GPU client for [[CUDA]] enabled Nvidia GPUs was also released for public beta testing.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://folding.typepad.com/news/2008/06/gpu2-beta-client-for-nvidia-now-released.html |title = Folding@home: GPU2 beta client for NVIDIA now released}}</ref> The GPU clients proved reliable enough to be promoted out of the beta phase and were officially released August 1, 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://folding.typepad.com/news/2008/08/new-clients-are-out-620.html |title = Folding@home: New clients are out (6.20)|name=release620}}</ref> Newer GPU cores continue to be released for both CAL and CUDA.

An unofficial installation guide has been published.<ref name="WINE wiki"/> On September 25, 2009, Vijay Pande revealed in his blog that a new third version of the GPU client was in development.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://folding.typepad.com/news/2009/09/update-on-new-fah-cores-and-clients.html | title = Folding@home: Update on new FAH core and clients}}</ref> GPU3 will use [[OpenCL]] (preferred over [[DirectCompute]]) as the software interface, which may mean that the GPU core will be unified for both ATI and nVidia, and may also mean the addition of support for other platforms with OpenCL support. On May 25, 2010, Vijay Pande announced an open beta of the GPU3 client on the Folding@home blog: <ref>{{cite web | url = http://folding.typepad.com/news/2010/05/open-beta-release-of-the-gpu3-clientcore.html | title = Folding@home: Open beta release of the GPU3 client/core}}</ref> The new core initially only supports Nvidia GPUs, but will support ATI/AMD GPUs in a subsequent release. ===PlayStation 3=== {{main|Life with PlayStation}} [[Image:LifeWithPlayStation Folding.jpg|right|thumb|220px|The PlayStation 3's ''Life With PlayStation'' client replaced the Folding@home application on September 18, 2008.]] Folding@Home is also a channel of the application [[Life with PlayStation]] for [[PlayStation 3]]. The client was originally a standalone application, but is now part of a [[virtual globe]] which depicts [[news]], [[weather]] and [[encyclopedia|encyclopedic]] information (notably from [[Wikipedia]]).<ref name="osstats"/><ref>{{cite web| url= http://folding.stanford.edu/FAQ-PS3.html| title = PS3 FAQ| accessdate = 2006-11-13| author = Vijay Pande| date= 2006-10-22| publisher = Stanford University}}</ref> ===Multi-core processing client=== <!-- Commented out: [[Image:FAH-SMP.jpg|thumb|150px|Folding@home SMP Client set to use 95% of a [[Multi-core (computing)|quad core]] processor.|{{ifdc|1=FAH-SMP.jpg|log=2009 July 15}}]] --> As more modern CPUs are being released, the migration to [[Multi-core (computing)|multiple cores]] is becoming more adopted by the public, and the Pande Group is adding [[symmetric multiprocessing]] (SMP) support to the Folding@home client in the hopes of capturing the additional processing power. The SMP support is being achieved by utilizing [[Message Passing Interface]] (MPI) protocols. In current state it is being confined inside a single node by hard coded usage of the [[localhost]]. On November 13, 2006, the beta SMP Folding@home clients for [[x86-64]] [[Linux]] and x86 [[Mac OS X]] were released. The beta win32 SMP Folding@home client is out as well, and a 32-bit Linux client is currently in development.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://folding.stanford.edu/FAQ-SMP.html | title = Folding@home SMP Client FAQ | accessdate = 2006-11-13 | author = Vijay Pande | date = 2006-11-13 | publisher = Stanford University }}</ref> On June 17, 2009 the Pande Group revealed that a second generation SMP client (known as the SMP2 client) was in development. This client will use threads rather than MPI<ref name="fahdev"/> to spread the processing load across multiple cores and thereby remove the overhead of keeping the cores synced, as they should share a common data bank in RAM. On January 24, 2010, the first open beta release of the SMP2 client was made, trialling the new processing methods and a new points bonus system rewarding quick unit returns. == Folding@home teams == A typical Folding@home user, running the client on a single PC, will likely not be ranked high on the list of contributors. However, if the user were to join a team, they would add the points they receive to a larger collective. Teams work by using the combined score of all their members. Thus, teams are ranked much higher than individual submitters. Rivalries between teams create friendly competition that benefits the folding community. Many teams publish their own stats, so members can have intra-team competitions for top spots.<ref>[http://forum.folding-community.org/viewtopic.php?t=8846 Folding-community: why have teams?]</ref> Some teams offer prizes in an attempt to increase participation in the project.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mprize.org/index.php?ctype=news&pagename=blogdetaildisplay&BID=2008032-20053630&detaildisplay=Y | title = The Mprize- }}</ref><ref>[http://jiggmin.com/forum/showthread.php?p=990473 Team Jiggmin F@H Prizes]</ref> == Development == The Folding@home project does not make the project [[source code]] available to the public, citing security and integrity concerns.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://folding.stanford.edu/English/FAQ-OpenSource | title = Folding@home Open Source FAQ }}</ref> At the same time, the majority of the scientific codes used by the FAH (ex.
