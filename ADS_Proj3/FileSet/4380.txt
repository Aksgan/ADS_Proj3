orientation of the terminator between the northern and southern hemispheres depends on the season. On the spring and fall [[equinox]]es (around March and September 21), there is no tilt of the [[earth]] with respect to the sun so the terminator line is parallel with the axis of the earth and with the [[longitude|lines of longitude]].]] The '''terminator''' or '''twilight zone''' is a fictive line that delimits the illuminated [[Daytime (astronomy)|day]] side and the dark [[night]] side of a planetary body (also known as the "grey line"). On Earth, the '''terminator''' is a circular line with a diameter that is approximately that of the Earth. The terminator passes through any point on the Earth's surface twice a day, once at [[sunrise]] and once at [[sunset]], apart from [[polar region]]s where this only occurs when the point is not experiencing [[midnight sun]] or [[polar night]]. The terminator is defined as the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of points on a [[moon]] or [[planet]] where the line through the [[Sun]] is [[tangent]]. The line separates the portions of the earth experiencing daylight from the portion of the planet experiencing darkness. While one half of the Earth is illuminated at any point in time (with exceptions during [[eclipse]]s), the location of the terminator line varies by time of day due to the rotation of the earth on its axis as well as the revolution of the earth around the sun. The terminator line also varies by time of year, with the angle of the line being almost parallel to [[Longitude|lines of longitude]] during the [[equinox]]es, and at its maximum angle of approximately 23.5 degrees during the [[solstice]]s.<ref>http://sos.noaa.gov/datasets/Land/day_night.html</ref> At the equator, under flat conditions (no obstructions such as mountains; or at a height above any such obstructions), the terminator line moves at approximately 1600 kilometers per hour (1000 miles per hour). This speed can appear to be increased when near obstructions—such as the height of a mountain, for example—as the shadow of the obstruction will be broadcast over the ground in advance of the terminator line along a flat landscape. The speed of the terminator line decreases as one approaches the poles, where it can reach a speed of zero (full-day sunlight or darkness).<ref>''Venus Revealed'' by David Harry Grinspoon, page 329</ref> [[Concorde]] and the [[Tupolev Tu-144]] were the only passenger airplanes able to overtake the maximum speed of the terminator. However, slower vehicles can overtake the terminator at higher [[latitude]]s, with it possible to walk faster than the terminator at the poles, near to the [[equinox]]es. The visual effect is that of seeing the sun rise in the west. Examination of the terminator can yield information about the surface of the body; for example, the presence of an [[atmosphere]] can create a fuzzier terminator. As the particles within an atmosphere are at a higher elevation, the light source can remain visible even after it has set at ground level. These particles scatter the light, reflecting some of it to the ground. Hence, the sky can remain illuminated even after the sun has set. [[Amateur radio]] operators take advantage of conditions at the terminator (so-called "grey line" conditions) to perform long distance communications. Under good conditions, radio waves can travel along the terminator to [[Antipodes|antipodal]] points. This is primarily because the [[D region|D layer]], which absorbs [[High frequency|High frequency signals]], disappears rapidly on the dark side of the terminator line. This process is known as [[Skywave|skywave propagation]].<ref>http://dx.qsl.net/propagation/</ref> [[Low Earth orbit|Low earth orbit]] satellites take advantage of the fact that certain polar orbits set near the terminator do not suffer from [[eclipse]], therefore their [[solar cell]]s are continuously lit by sunlight. Such orbits are called dawn-dusk orbits, a type of [[sun-synchronous orbit]]. This prolongs the operational life of a LEO satellite, as onboard battery life is prolonged. It also enables specific experiments that require the minimum influence of the sun, as the designers can opt to install the relevant sensors on the dark side of the satellite. ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== {{Commons category|Terminator}} * [http://www.fourmilab.ch/cgi-bin/uncgi/Earth/action?opt=-p Current terminator] * [http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/earthview.html aa.usno.navy.mil] - Website calculating synthetic images (B&W or color) representing the terminator for a given time (date & hour) {{Parts of a day}} [[Category:Earth phenomena]] [[Category:Light]] [[Category:Solar phenomena]] [[Category:Parts of a day]] [[bg:Слънчев терминатор]] [[ca:Terminador]] [[cs:Sluneční terminátor]] [[da:Terminator (astronomi)]] [[de:Tag-Nacht-Grenze]] [[et:Terminaator]] [[es:Terminador]] [[fa:خط پایانگر]] [[fr:Terminateur]] [[ko:명암 경계선]] [[hr:Sumračnica]] [[it:Terminatore (giorno)]] [[kk:Терминатор (астрономия)]] [[lv:Terminators (astronomija)]] [[lb:Dag-Nuecht-Grenz]] [[hu:Terminátor (csillagászat)]] [[nl:Dag-nachtgrens]] [[ja:明暗境界線]] [[no:Terminator]] [[pl:Terminator (astronomia)]] [[ru:Терминатор (астрономия)]] [[sr:Терминатор (астрономија)]] [[fi:Terminaattori (tähtitiede)]] [[sv:Terminator (astronomi)]] [[uk:Термінатор (астрономія)]] [[zh:晨昏圈]]</text> </page> <page> <id>37072</id> <title>Ternary computer</title> <text>A '''ternary computer''' (also '''trinary computer''') is a [[computer]] that uses [[ternary logic]] (three possible values) instead of the more common [[binary logic]] (two possible values) in its calculations. ==History== One of the earliest calculating machines, built by [[Thomas Fowler (inventor)|Thomas Fowler]] entirely from wood in 1840, was a ternary computer. The only modern, electronic ternary computer [[Setun]] was built in the late 1950s in the Soviet Union at the [[Moscow State University]] by [[Nikolay Brusentsov]], and it had notable advantages over the [[Binary numeral system|binary]] computers which eventually replaced it (such as lower electricity consumption and lower production cost). In 1970 Brusentsov built an enhanced version of the computer, which he called Setun-70. ==Balanced ternary== {{Main|Balanced ternary}} Ternary computing is commonly implemented in terms of [[balanced ternary]], which uses the three digits -1, 0, and +1. The negative value of any balanced ternary digit can be obtained by replacing every + with a – and vice versa. It is easy to subtract a number by inverting the + and – digits and then using normal addition. Balanced ternary can express negative values as easily as positive ones, without the need for a leading negative sign as with decimal numbers. These advantages make some calculations more efficient in ternary than binary. :"''I often reflect that had the Ternary instead of the binary Notation been adopted in the Infancy of Society, machines something like the present would long ere this have been common, as the transition from mental to mechanical calculation would have been
