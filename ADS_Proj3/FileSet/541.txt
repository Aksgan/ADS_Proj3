of [[lagomorpha|lagomorphs]]. Hares have much longer ears than rabbits, so Bugs might seem to be of the hare family, yet rabbits live in burrows, as Bugs is seen to do. Many more of the cartoon titles include the word "hare" rather than "rabbit," as "hare" lends itself easily to puns ("hair," "air," etc.) Within the cartoons, although the term "hare" comes up sometimes, again typically as a pun—for example, Bugs drinking "hare tonic" to "stop falling hare" or being doused with "hare restorer" to bring him back from invisibility—Bugs as well as his antagonists most often refer to the character as a "rabbit." The word "[[bunny]]" is of no help in answering this question, as it is a synonym for ''both'' young hares ''and'' young rabbits. In [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] commercials with [[Michael Jordan]], Bugs had been referred to as "''Hare'' Jordan."<ref>{{YouTube|id=2URMB4NGbo8|title=1993 - Nike - Michael Jordan & Bugs Bunny}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|id=3oK7PAvKHqc|title=Air Jordan VII Original Sneaker Bugs Bunny Sneakerfiles.com}}</ref> ===The opening and closing=== In the opening of many of the Bugs Bunny cartoons, the ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' and ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' rings contain Bugs Bunny's head after the [[Warner Bros.]] shield (generally from 1944 and 1949 onward). Others have Bugs Bunny relaxing on top of the Warner Bros. shield: He chews on his carrot, looks angrily at the camera and pulls down the next logo (''Merrie Melodies'' or ''Looney Tunes'') like a window shade (generally on cartoons between 1945 until early 1949). Then he lifts it back up, to now be seen lying on his own name, which then fades into the title of the specific short. In some other cases, the title card sometimes fades to him, already on his name and chewing his carrot then fade to the name of the short. At the finish of ''[[Hare Tonic]]'' and ''[[Baseball Bugs]]'', Bugs breaks out of a drum (like ''[[Porky Pig]]'') and says, "And that's the end". Also, at the end of ''[[Box Office Bunny]]'', right after [[Daffy Duck]] and [[Elmer Fudd]] run out through the [[Looney Tunes]] "That's All Folks!" sequence, Bugs later comes in through the rings and says, "And that's all, folks!". He did the ending for the last time at the end of ''[[Space Jam]]'' but this time saying "Well, that's all, folks!". ==Voice actors== The following are the many voice actors who have voiced the character Bugs Bunny over the last seventy years: ;[[Mel Blanc]] :Mel Blanc voiced the character for 49 years, from Bugs' debut in ''[[A Wild Hare]]'' (1940) until Blanc's death in 1989. Blanc described the voice as a combination of [[Bronx]] and [[Brooklyn]] [[accent (sociolinguistics)|accents]]; however, Tex Avery claimed that he asked Blanc to give the character not a New York accent ''per se'', but a voice like that of actor [[Frank McHugh]], who frequently appeared in supporting roles in the 1930s and whose voice might be described as New York Irish.<ref name="Barrier">{{Cite book|title=Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age|last=Barrier|first=Michael|date=2003-11-06|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=United States|isbn=978-0195167290|page=672}}</ref> In Bugs' second cartoon ''[[Elmer's Pet Rabbit]]'', Blanc created a completely new voice for Bugs, which sounded like a [[Jimmy Stewart]] impression, but the directors decided the previous voice was better. Though his best-known character was the carrot-chomping rabbit, munching on the carrots interrupted the dialogue. Various substitutes, such as [[celery]], were tried, but none of them ''sounded'' like a carrot. So for the sake of expedience, he would munch and then spit the carrot bits into a [[spittoon]] rather than swallowing them, and continue with the dialogue. One oft-repeated story, possibly originating from ''[[Bugs Bunny: Superstar]]'', is that he was allergic to carrots and ''had'' to spit them out to minimize any allergic reaction &mdash; but his autobiography makes no such claim;<ref name="Blanc">{{Cite book|last=Blanc|first=Mel|first2=Philip|last2=Bashe|title=That's Not All, Folks!|location=Clayton South, VIC, Australia|publisher=Warner Books|year=1989}}</ref> in fact, in a 1984 interview with [[Tim Lawson (writer)|Tim Lawson]], co-author of ''The Magic Behind The Voices: A Who's Who of Cartoon Voice Actors'' (University Press of Mississippi, 2004), Blanc emphatically denied being allergic to carrots. ;[[Jeff Bergman]] :Jeff Bergman was the first to voice Bugs (and several other Looney Tunes characters) after Mel Blanc died in 1989. He got the job by impressing Warner Bros. higher-ups with a tape of himself re-creating the voices of several of Blanc's characters, including Bugs Bunny. He had rigged the tape player so that he could use a switch to instantly toggle back and forth between the original recording of Blanc and Bergman's recording of the same lines. Upon doing this, it was almost impossible for the producers to tell which voice was Blanc's and which voice was Bergman; thus his vocal ability was established and his career launched. :Bergman first voiced Bugs during the 1990 Academy Awards and then in ''[[Box Office Bunny]]'', a 4-minute ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' short released in 1990 to commemorate Bugs' fiftieth anniversary. Bergman would next voice Bugs Bunny in the 1991 short ''[[(Blooper) Bunny]]'', a [[Greg Ford]]-directed cartoon also produced to coincide with Bugs Bunny's fiftieth anniversary. However, the short never received its intended theatrical release and was shelved for years, until [[Cartoon Network]] rediscovered it and broadcast it on their channel several years later.<ref name="Rosenbaum"/> ''(Blooper) Bunny'' has since garnered a cult following among animation fans for its use of edgy humor.<ref name="Rosenbaum">{{Cite web|last=Knight |first=Richard |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/movies/archives/2001/0101/010126.html |title=Consider the Source |publisher=Chicagoreader.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-20}}</ref> Other works for which Bergman provided Bugs' voice include ''[[Invasion of the Bunny Snatchers]]'' (an obvious [[parody]] of the 1950s [[sci-fi]] [[classic]] ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]''), ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' (a popular television program of the early nineties that featured the classic ''Looney Tunes'' characters as mentors to their younger counterparts) in the first season, and ''[[Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue]]'' (a television special exposing children to dangers of illegal drugs). Bergman would continue to do the voice of Bugs Bunny until 1993. In 2011 Bergman will return to voice Bugs Bunny for [[Cartoon Network]]'s upcoming series, ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]''. ;[[Greg Burson]] :Greg Burson first voiced Bugs in later episodes of ''Tiny Toon Adventures''. He was then given the responsibility of voicing
