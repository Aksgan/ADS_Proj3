Its name and release date of {{date|2010-11-04|mdy}} were officially announced on {{date|2010-06-13|mdy}}, prior to Microsoft's press conference at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010|E3 2010]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2010-06-14-vidgame14_ST_N.htm | title=Microsoft Kinect gets into motion as E3 confab kicks off | first=Mike | last=Snider | date=2010-06-14 | work=USA Today}}</ref> {{-}} ==Software== ===Dashboard=== {{See also|Xbox 360 System Software}} <!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Achievmentsymbol.png|100px|thumb|Symbol used for notifications]] --> The Xbox 360's original [[graphical user interface]] was the ''Xbox 360 Dashboard''; a [[Tab (GUI)|tabbed interface]] that featured five "Blades" (formerly four blades), and was designed by [[AKQA]] and [[Audiobrain]]. It could be launched automatically when the console [[booting|booted]] without a disc in it, or when the disc tray was ejected, but the user had the option to select what the console does if a game is in the tray on start up, or if inserted when already on. A simplified version of it was also accessible at any time via the Xbox Guide button on the gamepad. This simplified version showed the user's gamercard, Xbox Live messages and friends list. It also allowed for personal and music settings, in addition to voice or video chats, or returning to the Xbox Dashboard from the game. On November 19, 2008, the Xbox 360's dashboard was changed from the "Blade" interface, to a dashboard reminiscent of that present on the Zune and Windows Media Center, known as the "New Xbox Experience" or NXE. Since the console's release, Microsoft has released several updates for the Dashboard software. These updates have included adding new features to the console, enhancing Xbox Live functionality and multimedia playback capabilities, adding compatibility for new accessories, and fixing bugs in the software. The latest Dashboard update was made available on November 1, 2010. The update includes a specialized menu layout optimized for motion navigation as well as a significant visual refresh for the standard controller-navigated menus to match the style of the "Metro" interface used in Zune HD and [[Windows Phone 7]]. The update is compulsory; access to [[Xbox Live]] is disabled until the update is performed. ===New Xbox Experience=== {{further|[[New Xbox Experience|Xbox Live, section "New Xbox Experience"]]}} At E3 2008, at Microsoft's Show, Microsoft's Aaron Greenberg and Marc Whitten announced the new Xbox 360 interface called the "New Xbox Experience" (NXE). The update was intended to ease console menu navigation. Its GUI uses the Twist UI, previously used in [[Windows Media Center]] and the [[Zune]]. Its new Xbox Guide retains all Dashboard functionality (including the Marketplace browser and disk ejection) and the original "Blade" interface. The NXE also provides many new features. Users can now install games from disc to the hard drive to play them with reduced load time and less disc drive noise, but each game's disc must remain in the system in order to run. A new, built-in Community system allows the creation of digitized [[Avatar (Xbox 360)|Avatars]] that can be used for multiple activities, such as sharing photos or playing [[Xbox Live Arcade|Arcade]] games like ''[[1 vs 100 (Xbox 360)|1 vs. 100]]''. The update was released on November 19, 2008.<ref name=xbox2>{{cite web|url= http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/new-xbox-experience-dated|title= New Xbox Experience |date= October 9, 2008 |author=Tom Bramwell |publisher= Eurogamer|accessdate=2008-10-14}}</ref> While previous system updates have been stored on internal memory, the NXE was the first to require a storage device—at least a 128 MB memory card or a [[hard disk drive|hard drive]]. ===Multimedia=== The Xbox 360 supports videos in [[Windows Media Video]] (WMV) format (including [[High-definition television|high-definition]] and [[Microsoft PlaysForSure|PlaysForSure]] videos), as well as [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]] and [[MPEG-4]] media.
