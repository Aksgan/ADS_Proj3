archaeological excavations, making reconstruction of the upper parts of these building purely conjectural. ===Construction in Ancient Mesopotamia=== [[Image:Ancient ziggurat at Ali Air Base Iraq 2005.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ziggurat of Ur]]]] The earliest large scale buildings for which any real evidence survives have been found in ancient [[Mesopotamia]]. The smaller dwellings only survive in traces of foundations, but the later civilisations built very sizeable structures in the forms of palaces, temples and [[ziggurat]]s and took particular care to build them out of materials that last. which has ensured that very considerable parts have remained intact. ====Materials==== [[Image:Babylon relief.jpg|thumb|right|[Detail of the [[Ishtar Gate]] showing the exceptionally fine glazed brickwork of the later period]] The chief building material was the mud brick, formed in wooden moulds ([[adobe]]). Bricks varied widely in size and format from small bricks that could be lifted in one hand to ones as big as large paving slabs. Rectangular bricks are found but square format bricks were also common. They were laid in virtually every bonding pattern imaginable and used with considerable sophistication. Drawings survive on clay tablets from later periods showing that buildings were set out on brick modules. By 3500BC bricks were also being fired and records survives showing a very complex division of labour into separate tasks and trades. Life in general was governed by complex ritual and this extended to rituals for setting out buildings and moulding the first bricks. Contrary to popular belief the arch was not invented by the Romans, but was used in these civilisations. The later Mesopotamian civilisations, particularly [[Babylon]] and thence [[Susa]], developed glazed brickwork to a very high degree, decorating the interiors and exteriors of their buildings with glazed brick reliefs, examples of which survive in the archaeological museum in Tehran, the [[Louvre]] Museum in Paris and the [[Pergamon Museum]] in Berlin. ====Major technical achievements==== The major technical achievements are in the construction of great cities such as [[Uruk]] and [[Ur]]. The [[Ziggurat of Ur]] remains one of the most outstanding surviving buildings of the period, despite major reconstruction work. Another fine example is the ziggurat at [[Chogha Zanbil]] in modern Iran.

The dry arid climate has preserved many of the ancient buildings largely intact. ====Materials==== [[Adobe]] (sun-baked [[mud brick]]) construction was used for ancillary buildings and normal houses in ancient times and is still commonly used in rural Egypt today. The hot dry climate was ideal for mud-brick, which tends to wash away in the rain. The [[Ramesseum]] in [[Thebes, Egypt]] (Luxor) provides one of the finest examples of [[mud brick]] construction, with extensive storehouses with mud-brick vaults surviving, all constructed with sloping courses to avoid the need for formwork. The grandest buildings were constructed in stone, often from massive masonry blocks. The techniques used to move the massive blocks often used in pyramids and temples have been subject to extensive debate. Some authors have even maintained that the larger blocks are not cut stone at all but actually artificial stone made using concrete. This theory is very controversial and not widely accepted. ====Technology==== Although the Egyptians achieved extraordinary feats of engineering, they appear to have done so with relatively primitive technology. As far as is known they did not use wheels or pulleys. They transported massive stones over great distances using rollers, ropes, and sledges, with large numbers of slaves hauling the loads. There are no surviving Egyptian manuals so there has been considerable speculation on how stones were lifted to great heights and obelisks erected. Most theories centre around the use of ramps. ====Outstanding Achievements==== [[Image:Luxor temple 2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Karnak]], Hypostyle hall]] The [[pyramid]]s are chiefly impressive for their enormous size and the staggering manpower that must have been employed in their construction. Of these the largest is the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] which remained the tallest structure in the world for 3800 years (see [[List of tallest freestanding structures in the world]]). The engineering problems involved were chiefly to do with the transport of blocks, sometimes over long distances, their movement into location and exact alignment. It is now generally agreed that the skilled building workers were respected and well treated, but undoubtedly very large numbers of laborers were necessary to provide much of the brute force. The methods used in the construction of the pyramids have been the subject of considerable research and discussion (see: [[Egyptian pyramid construction techniques]]). [[Image:Great Pyramid of Giza 2010.jpg|thumb|left|[[Great Pyramid of Giza]], the tallest building in the world for over 3800 years]] [[Image:Menkaures Pyramid Giza Egypt.jpg|thumb|centre|[[Pyramid of Menkaure|Menkaures Pyramid, Giza]]]] ===Construction in Ancient Greece=== {{See|Architecture of ancient Greece|List of ancient architectural records|List of ancient roofs}} The [[ancient Greeks]], like the Egyptians and the Mesopotamians,tended to build most of their common buildings out of mud brick, leaving no record behind them. However very many structures do survive, some of which are in a very good state of repair, although some have been party reconstructed or re-erected in the modern era. The most dramatic are the [[Greek Temple]]s. No timber structures survive (roofs, floors etc), so our knowledge of how these were put together is purely conjectural. The spans are in the main limited and suggest very simple [[List of ancient roofs|beam and post structures]] spanning between stone walls. Fire clay was mainly restricted to roofing tiles and associated decorations, but these were quite elaborate. Fired bricks were not commonly employed. Very prominent buildings were roofed in stone tiles, which mimicked the form of their terracotta counterparts. While later cultures tended to construct their stone buildings with thin skins of finished stones over rubble cores, the Greeks tended to
