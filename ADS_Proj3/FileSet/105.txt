FutureSplash Animator was developed by [[FutureWave Software]], a small software company whose first product, SmartSketch, was a vector-based drawing program for pen-based computers. In 1995, the company decided to add animation capabilities to their product and to create a vector-based animation platform for [[World Wide Web]]; hence FutureSplash Animator was created. Initially, the only way to deploy such animations on the web was through the use of [[Java platform]]; however, the Java platform was later replaced with the [[Netscape]]'s [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] architecture. The FutureSplash animation technology was used on several notable websites such as [[MSN]], the official ''[[The Simpsons]]'' website and ''Disney Daily Blast'' of [[The Walt Disney Company]].<ref name="SA-history-official">[http://www.adobe.com/macromedia/events/john_gay/ The History of Flash] by [[Jonathan Gay]]</ref> In December 1996, [[Macromedia]] bought FutureWave and so re-branded and released FutureSplash Animator as ''Macromedia Flash'' v1.0. In 2005, Adobe Systems acquired Macromedia; subsequently, in 2007, ''Adobe Flash CS3 Professional'', the next version of Macromedia Flash was released. {| class="wikitable" |- ! style="width:150px;"| Release !
