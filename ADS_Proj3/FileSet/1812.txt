and there is an edge between every interacting pair of qubits. In particular, they are a convenient way of representing certain types of [[entangled]] states. Graph states are useful in [[quantum error correcting code]]s, entanglement measurement and purification and for characterization of computational resources in measurement based quantum computing models. == Formal definition == Given a graph ''G'' = (''V'', ''E''), with the set of [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] ''V'' and the set of [[Glossary of graph theory#Basics|edges]] ''E'', the corresponding graph state is defined as :<math>{\left| G \right\rangle} =\prod _{(a,b)\in E}U^{\{ a,b\} } {\left| + \right\rangle} ^{\otimes V}</math> where the operator <math>U^{\{ a,b\} }</math> is the interaction between the two vertices (qubits) ''a'', ''b'' :<math> U^{\{ a,b\} } =\left[\begin{array}{cccc} {1} & {0} & {0} & {0} \\ {0} & {1} & {0} & {0} \\ {0} & {0} & {1} & {0} \\ {0} & {0} & {0} & {-1} \end{array}\right]</math> And :<math>{\left| + \right\rangle} =\frac{{\left| 0 \right\rangle} +{\left| 1 \right\rangle} }{\sqrt{2} } </math> An alternative and equivalent definition is the following. Define an operator <math>K_{G}^{(a)}</math> for each vertex ''a'' of ''G'': :<math>K_{G}^{(a)} =\sigma _{x}^{(a)} \prod _{b\in N(a)}\sigma _{z}^{(b)} </math> where ''N''(''a'') is the neighborhood of ''a'' (that is, the set of all ''b'' such that <math>(a,b)\in E</math>) and <math> \sigma _{x,y,z}</math> are the [[pauli matrices]]. The graph state <math>{\left| G \right\rangle}</math> is then defined as the simultaneous eigenstate of the <math>N=\left|V\right|</math> operators <math> \left\{K_{G}^{(a)} \right\}_{a\in V} </math> with eigenvalue 1: :<math>K_{G}^{(a)} {\left| G \right\rangle} ={\left| G \right\rangle} </math> == See also == * [[Entanglement]] * [[Cluster state]] ==References== * {{cite journal | author=M.

Examples of graphemes include [[letter (alphabet)|alphabetic letters]], [[Chinese characters]], [[numerical digit]]s, [[punctuation]] marks, and the individual symbols of any of the world's writing systems. In a fully [[phonemic orthography]], a grapheme corresponds to one [[phoneme]]. However this is very much the exception. In spelling systems that are to some extent non-phonemic, such as in [[English language|English]], multiple graphemes may represent a single phoneme. These are called [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s (two graphemes for a single phoneme) and [[trigraph (orthography)|trigraph]]s (three graphemes). For example, the word ''ship'' contains four graphemes (''s'', ''h'', ''i'', and ''p'') but only three phonemes, because ''sh'' is a digraph. Conversely, a single grapheme can represent multiple phonemes, or no phonemes at all in the case of 'silent' letters: the English word "box" has three graphemes, but four phonemes: {{IPA-en|ˈbɒks|}}.<ref>The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language, 2nd edition, chapter 33</ref> Furthermore, a particular grapheme can represent different phonemes on different occasions, and vice versa. For instance in English the sound {{IPA|/f/|}} can be represented by 'F', 'f', 'ff', 'FF', 'ph', 'PH', 'Ph', 'gh', 'GH', and in some place names of Welsh origin by 'Ff'; while the grapheme 'f' can also represent the phoneme {{IPA|/v/|}} (as in the word ''of''). In a script such as Japanese [[katakana]] one grapheme corresponds to a [[syllable]] (or more technically a [[mora (linguistics)|mora]]). In some languages, a group of more than one grapheme may be treated as a single unit for the purposes of [[collation]], for example in an Hungarian dictionary, words starting in ''cs'' come after all other words starting ''c'', while in a Welsh dictionary, words starting ''ll'' come after all other words starting in ''l''. In addition, a single grapheme in print may not correspond to a single grapheme in handwriting, for example in [[Sütterlin|German handwriting]] the combination ''ch'' is usually written quite differently from ''c'' + ''h'': given that it also has its own sound value, there is a strong argument for treating this as a single distinct grapheme. In English and other languages, the choice of grapheme(s) is available to convey morphological relationships, for instance the link between ''sign'' and ''signature'' is closer in writing than in speech. Different [[glyph]]s can represent the same grapheme, meaning that they are [[allography|allographs]]. For example, the [[lowercase]] letter ''[[a]]'' can be seen in two variants: one with a hook at the top and one without (appearing similar to ''[[ɑ]]'', the lowercase letter Latin alpha). Not all graphemes represent phonemes: for example the [[logogram]] [[ampersand]] (''&''), was derived from the Latin word ''et'', and is used for ''and'' in many languages, and thus does not directly represent any combination of phonemes. Similarly for Arabic numerals. In some English personal names and place names, the relationship between the spelling of the name and the pronunciation is so distant that it cannot be identified which phonemes represent which graphemes. Examples are Marjoribanks (pronounced Marshbanks) and Featherstonehaugh (pronounced Fanshaw). Not only that, but in many other words the pronunciation has evolved subsequently to the fixing of the spelling, so that it has to be said that the phoneme(s) represent the grapheme(s), not the other way round. And for many technical jargons, the primary medium of communication is the written language and not the spoken language, so again it is clear that the phoneme(s) represent the grapheme(s). ==References== <references/> ==See also== *[[Allography]] *[[Digraph (orthography)]] *[[Character (computing)]] *[[Glyph]] *[[Grapheme–color synesthesia]] *[[Letter (alphabet)]] *[[Sign (semiotics)]] *[[Trigraph (orthography)]] {{writing systems}} {{List of writing systems}} [[Category:Graphemes| ]] [[Category:Typography]] [[Category:Units of morphological analysis]] [[af:Grafeem]] [[als:Graphem]] [[ar:غرافيم]] [[zh-min-nan:Grapheme]] [[br:Grafemenn]] [[bg:Графема]] [[ca:Grafema]] [[cs:Grafém]] [[da:Grafem]] [[de:Graphem]] [[et:Grafeem]] [[es:Grafema]] [[eo:Grafemo]] [[fr:Graphème]] [[gv:Myn-screeu]] [[gl:Grafema]] [[ko:자소 (언어학)]] [[id:Grafem]] [[it:Grafema]] [[he:גרפמה]] [[ka:გრაფემა]] [[ht:Grafèm]] [[lv:Grafēma]] [[lt:Grafema]] [[hu:Graféma]] [[nl:Grafeem]] [[ja:書記素]] [[no:Grafem]] [[pl:Grafem]] [[pt:Grafema]] [[ru:Графема]] [[sl:Grafem]] [[sv:Grafem]] [[ta:வரிவடிவம்]] [[uk:Графема]] [[ur:ترسیمہ]] [[zh:字位]]</text> </page> <page> <id>15729</id> <title>Graphical models for protein structure</title> <text>{{No footnotes|date=June 2010}} [[Graphical model]]s have become powerful frameworks for [[protein structure prediction]], [[protein–protein interaction]] and [[free energy]] calculations
