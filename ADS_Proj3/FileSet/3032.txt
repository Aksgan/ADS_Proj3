children under 17 admitted'', but this was almost immediately changed to its current wording, which restricted films certified as such to patrons 18 years and older. ====Others==== * '''NR''' or '''Not Rated''' - NR is not an official MPAA rating. It is used for independent or foreign films that are in limited release and have not been submitted to the MPAA for a rating classification, or have surrendered their MPAA rating (e.g. This Film is not yet Rated). It is also used by a film that is soon to be released and has [[Film trailer|trailers]] out for promotional purposes, but has not yet received a final rating. Advertisements for films with a pending rating contain the notice "This film is not yet rated". Most films released before 1968 carry this policy. Some vendors attach "youth-restricted product" labels to certain unrated films. *'''M''' - For mature audiences (used 1968-70). This rating is now defunct (although it is still used in the videogame rating system). Most films given this rating were re-rated PG, PG-13, or R. It was the precursor to '''GP''', another defunct rating that is considered identical to '''PG'''. *'''GP''' or '''General audiences—parental guidance suggested''' - In 1970-71, the MPAA found that the "M" rating was viewed by audiences as seedier and more adult than its intended meaning (to signify films containing material that may not be appropriate for some children). In response, the designation was changed to "GP". Shortly afterward the MPAA changed it to PG- (Parental Guidance Suggested), after some people thought that it meant "General Patronage". *'''SMA''' - "Suggested for mature audiences". Not an official rating, but an advisory used for a number of years prior to the MPAA ratings in 1968. This advisory appeared on certain films with mature themes or violence. *'''X''' - The precursor to the current NC-17 rating that unlike the other ratings was not trademarked. Because it was not trademarked it became so widely used by the U.S. [[pornography]] industry that the MPAA replaced it with the NC-17 rating in 1990. This has led to the misconception that NC-17 means pornographic in content. ====Film Advisory Board==== The [[Film Advisory Board]] (FAB) has instituted a rating system based on the level of maturity of the material's intended audience, rather than the film's content. While the FAB ratings system is not as recognized or well-known as the MPAA's rating system, it is in use by a number of commercial video distributors for direct-to-video releases that would have been impractical to submit to the MPAA. The Film Advisory Board has six ratings categories. Each includes a brief description as to the rating's explanation, such as "Violence in Battle Scenes", "Substance Abuse" or "Brief Nudity". The ratings as of 2008 are: *'''C''' - Children. Suitable for children ages 9 and younger. *'''F''' - Family. Suitable for all ages (Equal to MPAA's G rating). *'''PD''' - Parental Discretion. Parental discretion is advised (Equal to MPAA's PG rating). Formerly known as '''M'''. *'''PD-M''' - Parental Discretion-Mature. Suitable for years 13 and older (Equal to MPAA's PG-13 rating). Formerly known as '''VM'''. *'''EM''' - Extremely Mature. Ages 17 and older only (Equal to MPAA's R and NC-17 ratings, depending on description). *'''AO''' - Adults Only. Ages 18 and older only (Equal to MPAA's old X rating. Previously equal to MPAA's NC-17 rating until 2003). ====VoMeR==== {{primary sources|section|date=October 2010}} In 2010, a voluntary media rating system was created by filmmakers frustrated with the MPAA system. The so-called VoMeR (Voluntary Media Rating) is a self-rating system for film, music and new-media producers. The system's key feature is two levels of parental admonishment; '''with Adult''' under age '''[ wA < ]''' and '''Restricted content''' under age '''[ Rc < ]'''. The admonishment level is refined by the age number. There are two informative parts to the voluntary self-rating; a Letter+Age code and disclosure details. The letter designations work in conjunction with ages: *'''Ev''' - Everybody *'''wA < [''' ''age'' ''']''' - With adult supervision under [age] *'''Rc < [''' ''age'' ''']''' - Restricted content under [age] The feature film [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1529570/ ''Spectrauma''] was the first to adopt the system with a '''wA < 14''' rating. Other possible ratings include: *'''Ev''', *'''wA < 6''', *'''Rc < 14''', *'''wA < 17''', *'''Rc < 18'''. ==Sources== <!--<nowiki> See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref> and </ref> tags, and the template below. </nowiki>-->{{reflist}} ==See also== *[[Pornography in the United States]] *[[Pink permits]] *[[Video game content rating system]] ==External links== * [http://www.kijkwijzer.nl/pagina.php?id=30 The Netherlands film board's] comparison of film classifications issued for twelve recent films by the classification boards of the UK, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Denmark, and Sweden. * [http://imdb.com/updates/guide/certificates IMDb]'s information about rating systems from all over the world. * [http://www.filmclassifications.com FilmClassifications.com] Information regarding film classifications from Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States. * [http://www.classification.gov.au Australia] Australian Classification Board. * [http://www.medieraadet.dk Denmark] Medierådet for Børn og Unge (The Media Council for Children and Young People). * [http://www.vet.fi Finland] Valtion Elokuvatarkastamo. * [http://www.cnc.fr France] Centre National de la Cinématographie (CNC). * [http://www.spio.de Germany] Spitzenorganisation der Filmwirtschaft e.
