It grew out of the Special Communication Units (SCU) which were responsible for communications for [[MI6]] during the war. Its original base was at Whaddon Hall in Buckinghamshire, but it moved to [[Hanslope Park]] (also in Buckinghamshire) in the winter of 1946/47.<ref> {{cite book | last1 = Aldrich | first1 = Richard J | title = GCHQ - The uncensored story of Britain's most secret intelligence agency | chapter = Chapter 3 - Every war must have an end | publisher = Harper Press | year = 2010 | location = London | pages = 666 | accessdate = 2010-07-13 | isbn = 978-0-00-731265-8}}</ref> <ref> {{cite book | last1 = Pidgeon | first1 = Geoffrey | title = The Secret Wireless War - The story of MI6 communications, 1939-1945 | publisher = UPSO | year = 2003 | location = St Leonards-on-Sea | pages = 381 | isbn = 1-84375-252-2}}</ref> Hanslope Park is still the HQ of its successor, [[Her Majesty's Government Communications Centre]] (HMGCC). The primary role of the DWS was communications between British embassies and the UK, but it also operated and maintained transmitters at home and abroad on behalf of the Foreign Office for the broadcasting of the European Service of the BBC and the BBC Overseas Service, which were combined as the [[BBC World Service]] in 1988.<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/institutional/2009/03/000000_bushhouse_name.shtml | title = Why is the HQ called Bush House? | accessdate = 2010-07-13}}</ref> ==Role of DWS in signals intelligence== DWS operators were also involved in radio eavesdropping, the gathering of [[signals intelligence]] (SIGINT) for [[GCHQ]], from within the compounds of embassies.

''DirSync Pro'' is based on the program 'Directory Synchronize (DirSync)' which was first released in February 2003 by E. Gerber. It was developed afterwards by himself, Frank Gerbig and T. Groetzner. ''DirSync Pro'' is officially born in July 2008, based on a branch of the Directory Synchronize (DirSync) code. Many parts of ''DirSync Pro'' have gone through major rewriting and redesign ever since.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dirsyncpro.org/news.html|title=DirSync Pro release notes|publisher=DirSync Pro |accessdate=2009-09-22}}</ref> ''DirSync Pro'' offers a [[graphical user interface]] from which the user can manage and run multiple synchronization tasks.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mathews |first=Lee |url=http://www.downloadsquad.com/2009/05/12/open-source-dirsync-pro-syncs-folders-on-any-platform/ |title=Open source DirSync Pro syncs folders on any platform |publisher=Downloadsquad.com |date=2009-05-12 |accessdate=2009-05-21}}</ref> As of version 1.31, it supports local folder to folder synchronization, but does not support synchronization via [[FTP]] yet.

It can be used to create incremental backups. The synchronization could be setup to mirror a directory into another one (mono-directional/one way) or synchronize the content of two directories into each other (bi-directional/two way). ''DirSync Pro'' provides the following predefined synchronzation modes:<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dirsyncpro.org/features.html|title=DirSync Pro features |publisher=DirSync Pro |accessdate=2009-09-18}}</ref> * Synchronize A -> B (incremental): This mode makes a shadow of directory A in B. Only new and modified files are copied from A to B. * Synchronize B -> A (incremental): This mode makes a shadow of directory B in A. Only new and modified files are copied from B to A. * Synchronize A <-> B (incremental): This mode mirrors directories A and B to each other. Only new and modified files are copied. * Backup A -> B (full): This mode makes a full copy of directory A into directory B. All files are copied. * Restore B -> A (full): This mode makes a full copy of directory B into directory A. All files are copied. * Contribute A -> B: This mode copies only the new files from directory A into directory B. Modified files are left away. * Contribute B -> A: This mode copies only the new files from directory B
