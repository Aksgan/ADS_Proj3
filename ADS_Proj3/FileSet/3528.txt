Users can operate a gyroscopic mouse when they have no room for a regular mouse or must give commands while standing up.

It is based on survey data from the [[Family Resources Survey|FRS]], which is uprated to simulate the current year, together with a few years into the future. The model is built using [[SAS System|SAS]] and is owned by the GB [[Department for Work and Pensions]]. It is used for poverty and scenario analysis and produces outputs including the financial impacts on different demographic groups from hypothetical policy changes to the tax and benefits system. ==See also== *[[Pensim2]], another model with the same ownership ==External links== *[http://www.dwp.gov.uk DWP homepage] [[Category:Econometric models]]</text> </page> <page> <id>29535</id> <title>Political forecasting</title> <text>{{Expert-subject|statistics|date=November 2008}} {{COI|date=November 2008}} '''Political [[forecasting]]''' aims at predicting the outcome of elections. Models include: == Opinion polls == [[Opinion poll|Polls]] are an integral part of political forecasting. However, incorporating poll results into political forecasting models can cause problems in predicting the outcome of elections. There are a few ways in which inaccurate election forecasts can be avoided. ===Averaging polls=== It is well documented that combining poll data reduces the forecasting error of polls.<ref>Alfred G. Cuzan, J. Scott Armstrong, and Randall Jones, [http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/PollyVote/index.php/pollys-archive/polly-2004.html "Combining Methods to Forecast the 2004 Presidential Election: The PollyVote"]</ref> Political forecasting models often include averaged poll results, such as the [[RealClearPolitics]] poll average. ===Poll damping=== Poll Damping is a method of discounting flawed indicators of public opinion when creating a forecasting model. Often, polls early in the campaign are poor indicators of the future choices of voters. By weighting the poll results from days closer to an election to a greater degree than previous polls, a more accurate prediction is established. [http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/PollyVote/index.php/who-is-polly/pollycomp-rcp.html#Campbell%20(1996) Campbell (1996)]<ref>Campbell J. E. (1996), "Polls and Votes: The Trial-Heat Presidential Election Forecasting Model, Certainty, and Political Campaigns," American Politics Quarterly, 24 (4), pp.408-433.</ref> demonstrates the power of poll damping in political forecasting. == Markets == [[Prediction Market]]s like the [[Iowa Electronic Markets]] provide highly accurate forecasts of election outcomes. Comparing market forecasts with 964 election polls for the five US presidential elections from 1988 to 2004, [http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/faculty/trietz/papers/long%20run%20accuracy.pdf Berg et al. (2008)] showed that the IEM outperformed the polls 74% of the time.<ref>http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/faculty/trietz/papers/long%20run%20accuracy.pdf</ref> However, damped polls have been shown to outperform prediction markets. Comparing damped polls to forecasts of the Iowa Electronic Markets, [http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/Political/PDFs/EriksonWlezien_Markets_AAPOR_for_POLLY.pdf Erikson and Wlezien (2008)] showed that the damped polls outperformed both the winner-take-all and the vote-share markets. == Regression models == Political scientists and economists have employed [[regression analysis|regression models]] of past elections to forecast the percent of the two-party vote going to the incumbent party candidate in the next election. Most models consist of between two and seven variables and are estimated over anywhere between scarcely over a dozen elections to close to twice as many. (By contrast, historian [http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/Political/PDFs/Keys_forecast_aug_2007_apsa_by_lichtman.pdf Alan Lichtman] uses 13 “Keys” to predict whether the incumbents will be reelected.) A common denominator across most quantitative models is at least one measure of economic conditions, although no two employ the same metrics. Also, most models include at least one public opinion variable, a trial heat poll or a presidential approval rating, although here again there is no unanimity on indicators. == See also == * [[Larry Sabato]] * [[PollyVote]] == References == {{Reflist}} :*Brown, P.J., Firth, D., & C.

The number of alternatives are equivalent to the root or [[nth root]] of a mathematical or logical variable. Decision points or independent variables with two states have a binary root that is referred to as a [[wiktionary:dichotomy|dichotomous]] key whereas the term polychotomous key refers to roots which are greater than one or unitary and usually greater than two or binary.
