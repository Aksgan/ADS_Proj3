Steve Russell wrote the first two implementations of [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] for the [[IBM 704]]. It was Russell who realized that the concept of [[universal function]]s could be applied to the language; by implementing the Lisp universal evaluator in a lower-level language, it became possible to create the Lisp [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] (previous development work on the language had focused on [[Compiler|compiling]] the language).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/lisp.ps | title = History of Lisp | author = John McCarthy}}</ref> He invented the [[continuation]] to solve a double recursion problem for one of the users of his Lisp implementation.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.computernostalgia.net/articles/steveRussell.htm | title = Steve "Slug" Russell | work = Computer History}}</ref> Steve Russell was educated at [[Dartmouth College]] from 1954 to 1958. ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== {{Commons category|Steve Russell}} * [http://www.thedoteaters.com/stage1.php The Dot Eaters entry] on Russell and the development of Spacewar == See also == *[[First video game]] <!-- Translations --> {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME = Russell, Steve | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = S.

Certain [[systems]] remain [[hazardous]] for a considerable period after their useful life, and will usually be managed to ensure that the public and the environment is not exposed to the hazard. It is incumbent on the [[systems designer]] to consider the outcome should this stewardship be discontinued for any reason, and to design a system which is as robust as possible in the event of stewardship cessation. The most obvious example is the [[Nuclear power|nuclear]] industry, and the [[radioactive waste]] it generates which will be a hazard for many centuries. In the present era, most high level waste is in still in currently managed facilities, but various methods are being considered for disposal. Most of the proposed disposal methods are designed to put the waste in a place so isolated from the environment that (it is hoped) immediate stewardship cessation would be safe and appropriate. However, many people are more comfortable with systems where the waste is still accessible, so that if there is an unforeseen problem with the disposal method, the waste can still be accessed to rectify the problem. These systems will still require some level of stewardship, but the system designer must consider that this may not be available for the hundreds of years required. Another example is when [[Geostationary]] [[Telecommunication|Communication]]s Satellites reach the end of their useful lives. Stewardship cessation will occur hopefully in a planned manner, where the operator will move the [[satellite]] to a somewhat
