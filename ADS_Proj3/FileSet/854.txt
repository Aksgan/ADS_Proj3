It is published quarterly by [[MIT Press]] for the [[Association for Computational Linguistics]] (ACL). The journal includes articles, squibs and book reviews. The journal was established as the ''American Journal of Computational Linguistics'' in 1974 by David Hays and was originally published only as [[microform|microfiche]] until 1978. George Heidorn transformed it into a print journal in 1980, with quarterly publication. In 1984 the journal was renamed ''Computational Linguistics''. Since 2009, it has become an online-only [[open access journal]], freely available to anyone. == Editors == [[Editor in chief|Editors in chief]]: * [[David G.

Some of these problems involve the development of computational and statistical data analysis methods and in developing mathematical modeling and computational simulation techniques. By these means it addresses scientific research topics with their theoretical and experimental questions without a laboratory. It is connected to the following fields: * [[Computational biomodeling]], a field concerned with building [[computer model]]s of biological systems. * [[Bioinformatics]], which applies [[algorithm]]s and [[statistics|statistical techniques]] to the interpretation, classification and understanding of biological datasets. These typically consist of large numbers of [[DNA]], [[RNA]], or [[protein]] sequences. [[Sequence alignment]] is used to assemble the datasets for analysis. Comparisons of [[homology (biology)|homologous]] sequences, [[gene finding]], and prediction of [[gene expression]] are the most common techniques used on assembled datasets; however, analysis of such datasets have many applications throughout all fields of biology. *[[Mathematical biology]] aims at the mathematical representation, treatment and modeling of biological processes, using a variety of applied mathematical techniques and tools. * [[Computational genomics]], a field within [[genomics]] which studies the [[genome]]s of cells and organisms. High-throughput [[genome sequencing]] produces lots of data, which requires extensive post-processing ([[genome assembly]]) and uses [[DNA microarray]] technologies to perform statistical analyses on the genes expressed in individual cell types. This can help find genes of interest for certain diseases or conditions. This field also studies the [[DNA sequencing theory|mathematical foundations]] of sequencing. Advances in many areas of genomics research are heavily rooted in engineering technology, from the capillary electrophoresis units used in large-scale DNA sequencing projects. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Roos DS |title=Computational biology.
