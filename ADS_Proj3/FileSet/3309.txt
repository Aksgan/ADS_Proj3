On May 5, 2008, OpenSolaris 2008.05 was released in a format that could be booted as a [[Live CD]] or installed directly. It uses the [[GNOME]] desktop environment as the primary user interface. The later OpenSolaris 2008.11 release included a GUI for [[ZFS]]' snapshotting capabilities, known as Time Slider, that provides functionality similar to [[Mac OS X]]'s [[Time Machine (Apple software)|Time Machine]].

While OpenIndiana is a fork in the technical sense, it is a continuation of OpenSolaris in spirit: the project intends to deliver a System V family operating system which is binary-compatible with the Oracle products Solaris 11 and Solaris 11 Express. However, rather than being based around the [[OS/Net|OS/Net consolidation]] like OpenSolaris was, OpenIndiana will become a distribution built up around [[Illumos]] [[kernel (computing)|kernel]] (the first release is still based around OS/Net). The project does use the same IPS package management system as OpenSolaris.<ref name="OIWikiFAQ"/> On November 12, 2010, a final build of OpenSolaris (134b) was published by Oracle to the /release repository to serve as an upgrade path to Solaris 11 Express. Oracle Solaris 11 Express 2010.11, a preview of Solaris 11 and the first release of the post-OpenSolaris distribution from Oracle, was released on November 15, 2010.<ref> {{cite web |title=[osol-announce] Oracle Solaris 11 Express 2010.11 Releases Today! |author=Glynn Foster |date=November 15, 2010 |url=http://mail.opensolaris.org/pipermail/opensolaris-announce/2010-November/001512.html |publisher=opensolaris.org |accessdate=2010-11-15 }}</ref> ==Version history== {{Col-begin}} {{Col-2}} {| class="wikitable" ! rowspan=2 | Version ! rowspan=2 | Build ! rowspan=2 width="125" | Release date ! colspan=3 | End of support phase<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.sun.com/service/eosl/eosl_opensolaris.html | title = End of Service Life Status for OpenSolaris Operating System | publisher = [[Sun Microsystems]] | accessdate = 2009-09-28 }}</ref> |- !
