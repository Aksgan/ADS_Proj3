Medical school at the [[University of Southern California]] in Los Angeles, with [[M.D.]] in [[1963]], internship at St. Elizabeth’s Hospital in Washington, D.C. He returned to Los Angeles for a residency in neurology at UCLA. 1967-1969 in the Army, in [[Korea]] and [[San Francisco]]. In [[1969]], he took a post-doctoral fellowship at the [[Boston Veteran’s Hospital]]. In 1970, he was invited to the staff of [[Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital]] in New York as assistant professor. In 1972, he published his first book, Aphasia, Apraxia, and Agnosia. In 1976, he received a fellowship from the Foundations Fund for Research in Psychiatry to spend a year at the Centre Neuropsychologique et Neurolinguistique in [[Paris]]. On his return, he joined the staff of [[New York University Medical Center]], eventually as Clinical Professor in [[neurology]]. The academic year 1978-79 was spent as Visiting Associate Professor at [[Rockefeller University]]. The Center for Cognition and Communication (CCC) was established to provide treatment for clients with [[head injury]], [[stroke]], and other acquired and [[developmental disorders]] of [[cognition]]. ==Awards== *COPERNICUS PRIZE 2003 *VIRTUTI MEDICINALI 2003 ==Books== Authored: 1.Brown, J.W.

It was originally developed by Kenneth Bradley Russell and Christopher John Kline, and was further developed by the [[Sun Microsystems]] Game Technology Group. As of 2010, it is an independent [[open source]] project under a [[BSD licenses|BSD license]]. It is the reference implementation for [[Java Bindings for OpenGL]] (JSR-231). JOGL allows access to most features available to [[C (programming language)|C]] language programs, with the notable exception of window-system related calls in [[OpenGL Utility Toolkit]] (GLUT), as Java has its own windowing systems, [[Abstract Window Toolkit]] (AWT), [[Swing (Java)|Swing]], and some [[OpenGL#Extensions|extensions]]. ==Design== The base [[OpenGL]] [[C (programming language)|C]] API is accessed in JOGL via [[Java Native Interface]] (JNI) calls. As such, the underlying system must support OpenGL for JOGL to work. JOGL 2.0 maps the [[Java OpenGL ProfilesOO|OpenGL profiles in an object-oriented manner]]. JOGL differs from some other Java OpenGL wrapper libraries in that it merely exposes the procedural OpenGL API via methods on a few classes, rather than trying to map OpenGL functionality onto the [[object-oriented programming]] paradigm. Indeed, most of the JOGL code is autogenerated from the OpenGL C header files via a conversion tool named ''[[GlueGen]]'', which was programmed specifically to facilitate the creation of JOGL. This design decision has both its advantages and disadvantages. The [[procedural]] and [[state machine]] nature of OpenGL is inconsistent with the typical method of programming under Java, which is bothersome to many programmers. However, the straightforward mapping of the OpenGL C API to Java methods makes conversion of existing C applications and example code much simpler. The thin layer of abstraction provided by JOGL makes runtime execution quite efficient, but accordingly is more difficult to code compared to higher-level abstraction libraries like [[Java3D]]. Because most of the code is autogenerated, changes to OpenGL can be rapidly added to JOGL. == Status and standardization == As of 2007, JOGL provides full access to the [[OpenGL]] 2.0 specification. The last '''1.1.0''' version is the reference implementation for [[JSR]]-231 (Java Bindings for OpenGL). The '''1.1.1''' release gives limited access to [[OpenGL Utility Library|GLU]] [[Nonuniform rational B-spline|NURBS]], providing rendering of curved lines and surfaces via the traditional GLU APIs.
