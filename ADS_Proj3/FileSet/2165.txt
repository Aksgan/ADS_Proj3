Around the same time, work was started on an enhanced transputer, the T9000. Unfortunately, this encountered various technical problems and delays, and was eventually abandoned, signalling the end of the development of the transputer as a parallel processing platform. However, transputer derivatives such as the ST20 were later incorporated into chipsets for embedded applications such as [[set-top box]]es. In December 1994, Inmos was fully assimilated into STMicroelectronics, and the usage of the Inmos brand name was discontinued. == Notes == {{Reflist}} == References == * Arthur Trew and Greg Wilson (eds.)

It was founded in 1978 by [[Günter Bergerhoff]] (University of Bonn) and [[I.D.Brown]] (University of McMaster, Canada). It is now produced by the [[Fachinformationszentrum Karlsruhe]] in Europe and the U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]. It seeks to contain information on all inorganic [[crystal structures]] published since 1913, including pure [[chemical element|element]]s, [[mineral]]s, [[metal]]s, and [[intermetallic compounds]] (with atomic coordinates). ICSD contains 103,679 entries {{As of|2008|alt=as of mid-2008}} and is updated twice a year. A [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-based [[Personal Computer|PC]] version has been developed in co-operation with the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology ]] (NIST), and a PHP-MySQL web based version in co-operation with the [[Institut Laue-Langevin]] (ILL) Grenoble. == See also == *[[Crystallographic database]] ==External links== * [http://www.fiz-karlsruhe.de/icsd.html Information and a demonstration version] [[Category:Inorganic chemistry]] [[Category:Chemical databases]] [[Category:Crystallographic databases]] {{chem-stub}} [[fr:Inorganic crystal structure database]]</text> </page> <page> <id>18442</id> <title>Inpainting</title> <text>[[Image:Restoration.jpg|frame|right|Original and restored image.]] {{main|Image editing}} '''Inpainting''' is the process of reconstructing lost or deteriorated parts of [[Digital image|images]] and [[Digital video|videos]]. For instance, in the case of a valuable painting, this task would be carried out by a skilled [[art conservation and restoration|image restoration]] artist. In the digital world, inpainting (also known as ''image interpolation'' or ''video interpolation'') refers to the application of sophisticated algorithms to recover lost or corrupted parts of the image data (mainly small regions or to remove little defects). == Applications == There are many objectives and applications of this technique. Restoring an image to remove noise, improve brightness, color and details. In photography and cinema, is used for [[film restoration]]; to reverse the deterioration (e.g., cracks in photographs or scratches and dust spots in film; see [[infrared cleaning]]). It is also used for removing red-eye, the stamped date from photographs and removing objects to creative effect. This technique can be used to recover the lost blocks in the coding and transmission of images, for example, in a [[streaming video]]. It can also be used to remove logos in videos. == Methods == A common method is to use [[differential equation]]s (such as [[Laplace's equation]]) with Dirichlet boundary conditions for continuity (a seamless fit).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Peterson, Ivars | year = 2002 | month = May 11 | title = Filling in Blanks | journal = Science News | volume = 161 | issue = 19 | pages = 299–300 | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_19_161/ai_104730239/ | accessdate = 2008-05-11 | doi = 10.2307/4013521 | jstor = 10.2307/4013521 | publisher = Society for Science &#38}}</ref> Other methods follow [[Contour line|isophote]] directions (in an image, a contour of equal luminance), to do the inpainting.<ref>M.
