He would eventually become CEO and has served in that position to the present day. ====The Microsoft deal==== At the 1997 [[Macworld Expo]], Steve Jobs announced that Apple would be entering into partnership with [[Microsoft]]. Included in this was a five-year commitment from Microsoft to release [[Microsoft Office]] for Macintosh as well a US$150 million investment in Apple. It was also announced that [[Internet Explorer for Mac|Internet Explorer]] would be shipped as the default browser on the Macintosh. Microsoft chairman [[Bill Gates]] appeared at the expo on-screen, further explaining Microsoft's plans for the software they were developing for Mac, and stating that he was very excited to be helping Apple return to success. After this, Steve Jobs said this to the audience at the expo: {{quote|If we want to move forward and see Apple healthy and prospering again, we have to let go of a few things here. We have to let go of this notion that for Apple to win, Microsoft has to lose. We have to embrace a notion that for Apple to win, Apple has to do a really good job. And if others are going to help us that's great, because we need all the help we can get, and if we screw up and we don't do a good job, it's not somebody else's fault, it's our fault. So I think that is a very important perspective. If we want Microsoft Office on the Mac, we better treat the company that puts it out with a little bit of gratitude; we like their software. So, the era of setting this up as a competition between Apple and Microsoft is over as far as I'm concerned. This is about getting Apple healthy, this is about Apple being able to make incredibly great contributions to the industry and to get healthy and prosper again.<ref>{{cite web | title=Macworld 1997: The Microsoft Deal | url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3896484412928227820 | publisher=Google Video|date=February 7, 1997|accessdate=2007-01-04 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>}} ==1998- 2001: Apple's Renaissance== [[Image:IMac Bondi Blue.jpg|right|thumb|The original iMac]] ===The iMac, iBook, and Power Mac G4=== While discontinuing Apple's licensing of its operating system to third-party computer manufacturers, one of Jobs's first moves as new acting CEO was to develop the [[iMac]], which bought Apple time to restructure. The original iMac integrated a CRT display and CPU into a streamlined, translucent plastic body. The line became a sales smash, moving about one million units a year. It also helped re-introduce Apple to the media and public, and announced the company's new emphasis on the design and aesthetics of its products. More recent products include the [[iBook]], the [[Power Mac G4]], and the [[AirPort]] product series, which helped popularize the use of [[Wireless LAN]] technology to connect computers to networks. In 1999, Apple introduced the Power Mac G4, which utilized the Motorola-made PowerPC 7400 containing a 128-bit instruction unit known as [[AltiVec]], its flagship processor line. Also that year, Apple unveiled the iBook, its first consumer-oriented laptop that was also the first Macintosh to support the use of [[Wireless LAN]] via the optional AirPort card that was based on the 802.11b standard. ===Mac OS X=== {{Main|Mac OS X}} [[Image:Applecomputerheadquarters.jpg|right|thumb|Company headquarters on Infinite Loop in Cupertino]] In 2001, Apple introduced [[Mac OS X]], an operating system based on [[NeXT]]'s [[NEXTSTEP|NeXTstep]] and the [[FreeBSD]] kernel.<ref>{{cite web|author=Amit Singh |url=http://www.kernelthread.com/mac/osx/arch_xnu.html |title= What is Mac OS X? |work=kernelthread.com |accessdate=2007-11-23 }}</ref> Aimed at consumers and professionals alike, Mac OS X married the stability, reliability and security of [[Unix]] with the ease of a completely overhauled user interface. To aid users in transitioning their applications from [[Mac OS 9]], the new operating system allowed the use of Mac OS 9 applications through the [[Classic (Mac OS X)|Classic]] environment. Apple's [[Carbon (API)|Carbon]] API also allowed developers to adapt their Mac OS 9 software to use Mac OS X's features. ===Apple retail stores=== {{Main|Apple Store}} In May 2001, after much speculation, Apple announced the opening of a line of Apple retail stores, to be located throughout the major U.S. computer buying markets. The stores were designed for two primary purposes: to stem the tide of Apple's declining share of the computer market, as well as a response to poor marketing of Apple products at third-party retail outlets. ===The iPod=== {{Main|iPod}} In October 2001, Apple introduced its first [[iPod]] portable [[digital audio player]]. The iPod started as a 5 gigabyte player capable of storing around 1000 songs. Since then it has evolved into an array of products including the [[iPod Mini|Mini]] (now discontinued), the [[iPod Touch]], the [[iPod Shuffle|Shuffle]], the [[iPod Classic]], the [[iPod Nano|Nano]], and the [[iPhone]]. As of March 2010, the largest storage capacity for an iPod was 160 gigabytes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} ==2002 - Present: the iTunes-iOS Juggernaut== In early 2002, Apple unveiled a redesigned iMac, using the G4 processor. The new design had a hemispherical base and a flat panel all-digital display supported by a swiveling neck. This model was discontinued in the summer of 2004. In 2002, Apple also released the [[Xserve]] [[1U]] [[rack mount]]ed server. Originally featuring two G4 chips, the Xserve was unusual for Apple in two ways. It represented an earnest effort to enter the enterprise computer market and it was also relatively cheaper than similar machines released by its competitors. This was due, in no small part, to Apple's use of Fast ATA drives as opposed to the SCSI hard drives used in traditional rack-mounted servers. Apple later released the [[Xserve RAID]], a 14 drive [[Redundant array of independent disks|RAID]] which was, again, cheaper than competing systems. In mid-2003, Steve Jobs launched
