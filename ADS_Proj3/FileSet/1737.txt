axioms]]'''. ;[[Coarser topology]]: If ''X'' is a set, and if ''T''<sub>1</sub> and ''T''<sub>2</sub> are topologies on ''X'', then ''T''<sub>1</sub> is [[coarser topology|coarser]] (or '''smaller''', '''weaker''') than ''T''<sub>2</sub> if ''T''<sub>1</sub> is contained in ''T''<sub>2</sub>. Beware, some authors, especially [[mathematical analysis|analyst]]s, use the term '''stronger'''. ;Comeagre: A subset ''A'' of a space ''X'' is '''comeagre''' ('''comeager''') if its [[complement (set theory)|complement]] ''X''\''A'' is [[meagre set|meagre]]. Also called '''residual'''. ;[[Compact space|Compact]]: A space is [[compact space|compact]] if every open cover has a [[finite set|finite]] subcover. Every compact space is Lindelöf and paracompact. Therefore, every compact [[Hausdorff space]] is normal. See also '''quasicompact'''. ;[[Compact-open topology]]: The [[compact-open topology]] on the set ''C''(''X'', ''Y'') of all continuous maps between two spaces ''X'' and ''Y'' is defined as follows: given a compact subset ''K'' of ''X'' and an open subset ''U'' of ''Y'', let ''V''(''K'', ''U'') denote the set of all maps ''f'' in ''C''(''X'', ''Y'') such that ''f''(''K'') is contained in ''U''. Then the collection of all such ''V''(''K'', ''U'') is a subbase for the compact-open topology. ;[[Complete space|Complete]]: A metric space is [[complete space|complete]] if every Cauchy sequence converges. ;Completely metrizable/completely metrisable: See '''[[complete space]]'''. ;Completely normal: A space is completely normal if any two separated sets have [[disjoint]] neighbourhoods. ;Completely normal Hausdorff: A completely normal Hausdorff space (or [[T5 space|'''T<sub>5</sub>''' space]]) is a completely normal T<sub>1</sub> space. (A completely normal space is Hausdorff [[if and only if]] it is T<sub>1</sub>, so the terminology is [[consistent]].) Every completely normal Hausdorff space is normal Hausdorff. ;[[Completely regular space|Completely regular]]: A space is [[Completely regular space|completely regular]] if, whenever ''C'' is a closed set and ''x'' is a point not in ''C'', then ''C'' and {''x''} are functionally separated. ;[[Completely T3 space|Completely T<sub>3</sub>]]: See '''[[Tychonoff space|Tychonoff]]'''. ;Component: See '''[[Connected space|Connected component]]'''/'''Path-connected component'''. ;[[Connected (topology)|Connected]]: A space is [[connected (topology)|connected]] if it is not the union of a pair of [[disjoint]] nonempty open sets. Equivalently, a space is connected if the only clopen sets are the whole space and the empty set. ;[[connected space|Connected component]]: A [[connected space|connected component]] of a space is a [[maximal]] nonempty connected subspace. Each connected component is closed, and the set of connected components of a space is a [[partition of a set|partition]] of that space. ;[[Continuity (topology)|Continuous]]: A function from one space to another is [[continuity (topology)|continuous]] if the [[preimage]] of every open set is open. ;Continuum: A space is called a continuum if it a compact, connected Hausdorff space. ;[[Contractible space|Contractible]]: A space ''X'' is contractible if the [[identity function|identity map]] on ''X'' is homotopic to a constant map. Every contractible space is simply connected. ;Coproduct topology: If {''X''<sub>''i''</sub>} is a collection of spaces and ''X'' is the (set-theoretic) [[disjoint union]] of {''X''<sub>''i''</sub>}, then the coproduct topology (or '''disjoint union topology''', '''topological sum''' of the ''X''<sub>''i''</sub>) on ''X'' is the finest topology for which all the injection maps are continuous. ;[[Countable chain condition]]: A space ''X'' satisfies the countable chain condition if every family of non-empty, pairswise disjoint open sets is countable. ;Countably compact: A space is countably compact if every [[countable]] open cover has a [[finite set|finite]] subcover. Every countably compact space is pseudocompact and weakly countably compact. ;Countably locally finite: A collection of subsets of a space ''X'' is '''countably locally finite''' (or '''σ-locally finite''') if it is the union of a [[countable]] collection of locally finite collections of subsets of ''X''. ;[[Cover (topology)|Cover]]: A collection of subsets of a space is a cover (or '''covering''') of that space if the union of the collection is the whole space. ;Covering: See '''Cover'''. ;Cut point: If ''X'' is a connected space with more than one point, then a point ''x'' of ''X'' is a cut point if the subspace ''X'' &minus; {''x''} is disconnected. == D == ;[[Dense set]]: A set is dense if it has nonempty intersection with every nonempty open set. Equivalently, a set is dense if its closure is the whole space. ;Derived set: If ''X'' is a space and ''S'' is a subset of ''X'', the derived set of ''S'' in ''X'' is the set of limit points of ''S'' in ''X''. ;Diameter: If (''M'', ''d'') is a metric space and ''S'' is a subset of ''M'', the diameter of ''S'' is the [[supremum]] of the distances ''d''(''x'', ''y''), where ''x'' and ''y'' range over ''S''. ;Discrete metric: The discrete metric on a set ''X'' is the function ''d'' : ''X'' &times; ''X'' → [[real number|'''R''']] such that for all ''x'', ''y'' in ''X'', ''d''(''x'', ''x'') = 0 and ''d''(''x'', ''y'') = 1 if ''x'' ≠ ''y''. The discrete metric induces the discrete topology on ''X''. ;[[Discrete space]]: A space ''X'' is [[discrete space|discrete]] if every subset of ''X'' is open. We say that ''X'' carries the '''discrete topology'''. ;[[Discrete topology]]: See '''[[discrete space]]'''. ;Disjoint union topology: See '''Coproduct topology'''. ;[[Dispersion point]]: If ''X'' is a connected space with more than one point, then a point ''x'' of ''X'' is a dispersion point if the subspace ''X'' &minus; {''x''} is hereditarily disconnected (its only connected components are the one-point sets). ;Distance: See '''[[metric space]]'''. ;[[Dunce hat (topology)]] == E == ;[[Entourage (topology)|Entourage]]: See '''[[Uniform space]]'''. ;Exterior: The exterior of a set is the interior of its complement. == F == ;[[F-sigma set|''F''<sub>σ</sub> set]]: An [[F-sigma set|''F''<sub>σ</sub> set]] is a [[countable]] union of closed sets. ;[[Filter (mathematics)|Filter]]: A filter on a space ''X'' is a nonempty family ''F'' of subsets of ''X'' such that the following conditions hold: :# The [[empty set]] is not in ''F''. :# The intersection of any [[finite set|finite]] number of elements of ''F'' is again in ''F''. :# If ''A'' is in ''F'' and if ''B'' contains ''A'', then ''B'' is in ''F''. ;[[Finer topology]]: If ''X'' is a set, and if ''T''<sub>1</sub> and ''T''<sub>2</sub> are topologies on ''X'', then ''T''<sub>2</sub> is [[finer topology|finer]] (or '''larger''', '''stronger''') than ''T''<sub>1</sub> if ''T''<sub>2</sub> contains ''T''<sub>1</sub>. Beware, some authors, especially [[mathematical analysis|analyst]]s, use the term '''weaker'''. ;Finitely generated: See '''[[Alexandrov topology]]'''. ;[[First category]]: See
