controversial book by [[Robert Whitaker (author)|Robert Whitaker]] published in 2002 which is highly critical of the psychiatric profession.<ref name=gold>{{cite news|author=Goldman, Larry S., MD|title=Mad in America: Bad Science, Bad Medicine, and the Enduring Mistreatment of the Mentally Ill|date=May 13, 2002|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/432570;meddomainjsession=1GGGMVcK9Gdtv5HnhvMtgmNBKgB01VrvRTNd9LPrZ1tlRpRGCMCB!-1300228618|work=MedScape Today|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=November 6, 3010}}</ref> Problems with many historical aspects of treatment, as well as [[antipsychotic]]s, are covered. The book received mixed reviews within the medical literature, which noted issues of bias in sourcing but nonetheless felt the discussion of social issues in psychiatry was important. The book received some better reviews from the lay press.

[[Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital|Pennsylvania Hospital]] reported that about 45 percent of patients were discharged as cured and 25 percent discharged as improved.

The drug "produced an effect similar to frontal lobotomy", according to early reports by the company's lead investigator.<ref name="Whitaker_2010"/>{{rp|154–55}} Whitaker says that pharmaceutical advertising, articles published in the scientific literature, and stories in the media of "miracle drugs" transformed Thorazine into a ''healing'' drug.<ref name="Whitaker_2010"/>{{rp|158}} Whitaker says that marketing money from pharmaceutical companies began to flow to the [[American Medical Association]] in 1951, a year after Thorazine was synthesized, because of the [[Durham-Humphrey Amendment]] to the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] which "greatly expanded the list of medications that could only be obtained with a doctor's prescription".<ref name="Whitaker_2010"/>{{rp|148–149}} In Part Three, Whitaker also describes the American (but not for example [[United Kingdom|British]]) propensity to classify patients as "schizophrenic", as well as the error (confusion of [[schizophrenia]] with the yet-to-be-discovered [[encephalitis lethargica]]) in the original classification by [[Emil Kraepelin]] which psychiatry chose to not revisit and fix.<ref name="Whitaker_2010"/>{{rp|167,169}} Whitaker then describes three pathways that [[dopamine]] may take in the human brain, and quotes first-person accounts of the effects of antipsychotic drugs on individuals.<ref name="Whitaker_2010"/>{{rp|162–164,176–187}} He calls a 1996 ''New York Times'' advertisement by a consortium of pharmaceutical companies a "bald-faced lie": the group sought to say that the cause of psychosis and schizophrenia is an abnormal dopamine level and that their drugs worked by altering the level of dopamine.<ref name="Whitaker_2010"/>{{rp|199}} Whitaker then criticizes some American studies, and points out the work of George Crane at the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] to get [[tardive dyskinesia]] recognized, and he contrasts the dosages that [[United Kingdom|British]] doctors were comfortable in prescribing (300 milligrams per day of Thorazine) with what American psychiatrists prescribed (1,500 up to perhaps 5,000 milligrams per day).<ref name="Whitaker_2010"/>{{rp|200–202,204–209}} He sees irony in the fact that ''The New York Times'' reported on Soviet forced use of neuroleptic drugs (which Florida Senator Edward Gurney called "chemicals which covert human beings into vegetables") in "psychiatric jails" but called the same drugs "widely acknowledged to be effective" when reporting on American schizophrenic patients.<ref name="Whitaker_2010"/>{{rp|216–218}} Whitaker describes the demise of modern-day moral treatment in a short history of Loren Mosher's [[Soteria Project]], funded by the U.S. while Mosher was chief of schizophrenia at NIMH.<ref name="Whitaker_2010"/>{{rp|226}} He attributes the results in a [[World Health Organization]] 1979 study of outcomes for schizophrenia patients (which found better outcomes in undeveloped countries like [[India]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Colombia]] than in developed countries like the [[United States]], [[England]], [[Denmark]], [[Ireland]], [[Russia]], [[Czecholslovakia]] and [[Japan]]) to doctors in the developed world who maintained their patients on medications.<ref name="Whitaker_2010"/>{{rp|226–229}} He then describes fifty years of American scientists doing experiments on schizoprenia patients: to intentionally exacerbate their symptoms and study the results.
