Datasets of this type typically meet specified quality standards and are publicly available for free (or at nominal cost) in one or more uniform formats from government or academic sources. National LiDAR datasets are used primarily in [[LIDAR Contour Mapping]], and also for forestry, urban and rural planning, recreational, environmental, engineering, and geological studies and planning, among others.

The NMPDR was funded for five years from 2004 through a grant to co-PI's [[Rick Stevens]] from the Computation Institute at the University of Chicago, and [[Ross Overbeek]] at the [http://www.thefig.info Fellowship for the Interpretation of Genomes]. The NMPDR was initially tasked with annotating and curating the genomes of five pathogenic [[species]] of [[Bacteria]], ([[Campylobacter]], [[Listeria]], [[Staphylococcus]], [[Streptococcus]], and [[Vibrio]]). However, after four years, the team were asked to also oversee the curation and annotation of the genomes of seven additional bacterial species ([[Chlamydia (bacterium)|Chlamydia]], [[Chlamydophila]], [[Haemophilus]], [[Mycoplasma]], [[Neisseria]], [[Treponema]], and [[Ureaplasma]]). The flagship website, the [http://www.nmpdr.org National Microbial Pathogen Data Resource] provides curated annotations in an environment for comparative analysis of genomes and biological subsystems. In addition, the NMPDR team have also developed the [http://rast.nmpdr.org Rapid Annotation using Subsystems Technology Server] (RAST) for annotating and curating complete microbial genomes and the [http://metagenomics.nmpdr.org Metagenomics RAST] for annotating metagenomes. ==Note to NMPDR Users== As of January 2010, the bacterial organism originally covered by NMPDR under the BRC program have been transferred to [[PATRIC]] the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center.
