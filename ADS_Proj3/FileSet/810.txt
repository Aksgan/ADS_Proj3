Both Fusion and Parallels Desktop were optimized for virtual machine performance. MacTech’s test included launch and [[CPU]] tests, File and Network IO, Footprint, Application Launch, Application Performance and 3D and HD Graphics. In many cases, tests were performed after both Adam and Successful launches and were timed using a stopwatch. {| class="wikitable" style="font-size: smaller; text-align: center; width: 50%; table-layout: fixed;" !

In Civilization, Parallels Desktop has faster [[Frame rate|FPS]] (Frames Per Second) and performed better on slower machines while Fusion has better, more detailed graphics. Fusion has difficulty showing the startup video, but Parallels Desktop's graphics are not as rich. When running Portal, Fusion is faster but its graphics are visibly lighter, while Parallels Desktop has better graphics and visual details.<ref>http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.25/25.04/VMBenchmarks/index-003.html</ref> ===Cross-platform task tests=== MacTech’s cross platform tests timed how long it took users to perform multi-step tasks that moved data between Mac OS X and Windows. VMware Fusion, which is designed for increased isolation from the host, requires more manual steps to move data between the host and the virtual environment. Parallels Desktop, which is designed to run transparently with the Mac OS X host, requires fewer steps to perform the same tasks. Therefore, Parallels Desktop was faster. ===Networking and file I/O tests=== Parallels Desktop occasionally displayed lag anomalies while VMware Fusion's virtual drive performance was very close to that of a physical drive. VMware Fusion preferred a bridged connection for reliable performance, and Parallels Desktop was consistent regardless of the type of virtual network adaptor used. ===Simultaneous use of VM and host OS=== Parallel Desktop 5 always uses wired memory for hosted OS, while VMWare Fusion 3.0 uses active memory that can be swapped. Giving better performance to hosted VM, this leaves less memory to host OS programs and causes more swapping if you use VM and host OS programs at the same time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}{{Clarify|date=May 2010}} ==2010 Benchmark tests== In 2010 [[MacTech]]<ref>{{cite web |last=Ticktin |first=Neil |title= Head-to-Head: Parallels Desktop for Mac vs. VMware Fusion |accessdate=March 2010 |url=http://www.mactech.com/articles/special/1002-VirtualizationHeadToHead/index-001.html|publisher=MacTech}}</ref>, Volume 26, Issue 01, published the results of a new series of [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] tests showing a performance advantage for Parallels Desktop 5 across all subcategories, with an average of 30% faster. == See also == *[[Comparison of platform virtual machines]] for a list of related virtualization software products *[[Desktop virtualization]] *[[Microsoft Virtual PC]] *[[Platform virtualization]] *[[Virtual machine]] *[[x86 virtualization]] == References == {{Reflist|2}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Comparison Of Vmware Fusion And Parallels Desktop}} [[Category:Software comparisons|VMware Fusion and Parallels Desktop]] [[Category:Virtualization software|*]] [[Category:VMware|*]] [[Category:Mac OS X software|*]]</text> </page> <page> <id>7171</id> <title>Comparison of VoIP software</title> <text>'''VoIP software''' is used to conduct [[telephone]]-like voice conversations across [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) based networks. ''VoIP'' stands for "[[Voice over IP]]". For residential markets, VoIP phone service is often cheaper than traditional [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN) service and can remove geographic restrictions to telephone numbers, e.g. have a New York PSTN phone number in Tokyo. For businesses, VoIP obviates separate voice and data pipelines, channelling both types of traffic through the IP network while giving the telephony user a range of advanced capabilities. [[Softphone]]s are client devices for making and receiving voice and video calls over the IP network with the standard functionality of most "original" telephones and usually allow integration with [[IP Phone|IP phones]] and [[USB phone]]s instead of utilizing a computer's microphone and speakers (or headset). Most softphone clients run on the open [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) supporting various codecs. [[Skype]] runs on a closed proprietary network, though the network (but not the official Skype client software) also supports SIP clients.<ref name="skypesip" /> [[Online chat|Online "Chat"]] programs now also incorporate voice and video communications. Other VoIP software applications include conferencing servers, intercom systems, virtual [[FXO]]s and adapted telephony software which concurrently support VoIP and [[PSTN]] like [[Interactive Voice Response|IVR]] systems, dial in dictation, on hold and call recording servers. == General softphone clients == <!-- ######### EDITORS TAKE NOTICE ########## In the "License and source" column, please restrict yourselves to: * [[Free software]] * [[Proprietary software|Proprietary]] [[freeware]] * [[Closed source|Closed]] * [[Open source|Open]] (just in case) Should the application be dual licensed, indicate so by separating them with a slash.
