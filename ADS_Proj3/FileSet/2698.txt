Braithwaite|Richard Braithwaite]]'s rooms in [[King's College, Cambridge|King's]], where [[Karl Popper]], another Viennese philosopher, had been invited as the guest speaker. Popper's paper was "Are there philosophical problems?", in which he struck up a position against Wittgenstein's, contending that problems in philosophy are real, not just linguistic puzzles as Wittgenstein argued. Accounts vary as to what happened next, but Wittgenstein was apparently infuriated and started waving a hot poker at Popper, demanding that Popper give him an example of a moral rule. Popper offered one&mdash;"Not to threaten visiting speakers with pokers"&mdash;at which point Russell had to tell Wittgenstein to put the poker down and Wittgenstein stormed out. It was the only time the philosophers, three of the most eminent in the world, were ever in the same room together.<ref>Eidinow, John and Edmonds, David.

Russell had been worried that Wittgenstein, with his literal-mindedness, would not appreciate the group's humour or the fact that the members were in love with each other.<ref>McGuinness, Brian.

A mathematics undergraduate and descendant of [[David Hume]], Pinsent became what Wittgenstein called his first and only friend,<ref>Goldstein, Laurence. ''Clear and queer thinking: Wittgenstein's development and his relevance to modern thought''. Rowman & Littlefield, 1999, p. 179.</ref> and is widely regarded as the first of three or four men Wittgenstein fell in love with&mdash;followed by [[Francis Skinner]] in 1930, Ben Richards in the late 1940s, and to a lesser extent Keith Kirk in 1940&mdash;though Pinsent and Kirk did not respond in kind.<ref>Monk, pp. 583–586.</ref> The men worked together on experiments in the psychology laboratory about the role of rhythm in the appreciation of music, and Wittgenstein delivered a paper about it to the British Psychological Association in Cambridge in 1912. They also travelled together, including to Iceland in September 1912&mdash;the expenses paid by Wittgenstein's father, including first class travel, and new clothes and spending money for Pinsent&mdash;and later to Norway. Pinsent's diaries have provided researchers with a wealth of material about Wittgenstein's personality, and what comes across strongly is how sensitive and nervous he was, attuned to the tiniest slight or change in mood from Pinsent, with Pinsent regularly writing that Wittgenstein was in a huff about something.<ref>Monk, p. 58ff. *See Pinsent, David Hume and Von Wright, G.H. ''A Portrait of Wittgenstein as a Young Man: From the Diary of David Hume Pinsent 1912-1914''. Blackwell, 1990.</ref> He wrote about shopping for furniture with Wittgenstein in Cambridge when the latter was given rooms in Trinity; most of what they found in the stores was not frugal enough for Wittgenstein's taste: "I went and helped him interview a lot of furniture at various shops ... It was rather amusing: he is terribly fastidious and we led the shopman a frightful dance, Vittgenstein [sic] ejaculating "No—Beastly!" to 90 percent of what he shewed us!"<ref name=Kanterian40/></blockquote> He wrote in May 1912 that Wittgenstein had just begun to study philosophy: "[h]e expresses the most naive surprise that all the philosophers he once worshipped in ignorance are after all stupid and dishonest and make disgusting mistakes!"<ref name=Kanterian40/> The last time they saw each other was at Birmingham train station on 8 October 1913, when they said goodbye before Wittgenstein left to live in Norway. Despite the physical distance that had grown between them because of the war&mdash;Pinsent's last letter to Wittgenstein was dated 14 September 1916&mdash;when Pinsent died in a plane crash in May 1918, Wittgenstein was distraught to the point of being suicidal, and three years later dedicated the ''Tractatus'' to him.<ref name=Kanterian40>Kanterian, Edward.
