Windows Metafiles are intended to be portable between applications and may contain both [[vector graphics]] and [[bitmap]] components. Essentially, a WMF file stores a list of function calls that have to be issued to the Windows [[Graphics Device Interface]] (GDI) layer in order to display an image on screen. Since some GDI functions accept [[Pointer (computing)|pointer]]s to [[Callback (computer science)|callback function]]s for [[error handling]], a WMF file may erroneously include executable code.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/archive-012006.html#00000761 | title=It's not a bug, it's a feature | publisher=[[F-Secure]] | accessdate=2009-10-08}}</ref> WMF is a [[16-bit]] format introduced in [[Windows 3.0]]. It is the native [[Vector graphics|vector format]] for [[Microsoft Office]] applications such as [[Microsoft Word|Word]], [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]], and [[Microsoft Publisher|Publisher]]. In 2007 '''Enhanced Metafile''' ('''EMF''') a newer [[32-bit]] version with additional commands appeared. EMF is also used as a graphics language for printer drivers. The last(?) version of EMF, 4.0, appeared in 2008. With the release of [[Windows XP]], the '''Enhanced Metafile Format Plus Extensions''' ('''EMF+''') format was introduced. EMF+ provides a way to serialize calls to the [[GDI+]] API in the same way that WMF/EMF stores calls to GDI. There are also compressed versions of Windows Metafiles known as '''Compressed Windows Metafile (WMZ)''' and '''Compressed Windows Enhanced Metafile (EMZ)'''<ref>{{cite web | url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/895083 | title=You receive a "This file is an unsupported graphic format" error message when you try to insert a picture into a PowerPoint for Mac presentation | publisher=[[Microsoft]] | accessdate=2008-06-01}}</ref>. == Specifications and patents == The original 16 bit WMF file format was fully specified in volume 4 of the 1992 Windows 3.1 SDK documentation<ref>Microsoft Windows 3.1 Programmers Reference, Volume 4 Resources, Microsoft Press 1992, ISBN 1-55615-494-1, chapter 3 pp. 21-45</ref> (at least if combined with the descriptions of the individual functions and structures in the other volumes), but that specification (like most computer manuals){{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} was vague about a few details. These manuals were published as printed books available in bookstores with no click through EULA or other unusual restrictions (just a general warning that if purchased as part of a software bundle, the software would be subject to one). Over time the existence of that historic specification was largely forgotten and some alternative implementations resorted to reverse engineering to figure out the file format from existing WMF files, which was difficult and error prone.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://wvware.sourceforge.net/caolan/support.html | title=Window Metafile (wmf) Reference | quote=''These opcodes are unimplemented, for the reason that i dont know what they are, no known documentation'' | author=Caolan McNamara | accessdate=2008-06-01}}</ref> In September 2006, Microsoft again published the WMF file format specification<ref>{{cite web | url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc215212.aspx | title=MS-WMF: Windows Metafile Format Specification | accessdate=2008-06-01 }}</ref> in the context of the [[Microsoft Open Specification Promise]], promising to not assert patent rights to file format implementors.<ref name="osp">{{cite web | url=http://www.microsoft.com/interop/osp/ | title=Microsoft Open Specification Promise |
