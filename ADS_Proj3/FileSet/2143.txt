The InfiniteReality2 however, was still marketed as the InfiniteReality. It was the second implementation of the InfiniteReality architecture, and was introduced in late 1996. It is identical to the InfiniteReality architecturally, but differs mechanically as the Onyx2's [[SGI Origin 2000|Origin 2000]]-based card cage is different from the Onyx's [[SGI Challenge|Challenge]]-based card cage. Introduced by the InfiniteReality2 is an interface scheme that is used in rackmount Onyx2 or later systems. Instead of being connected to the host system via a FCI cable, the board set is plugged into the rear of a midplane, which can support two pipelines. The midplane has eleven slots. Slot six to slot eleven are for the first pipeline, which may contain one to four Raster Manager boards. Slot one to four is for the second pipeline, which may contain one or two Raster Manager boards due to the number of slots there are. Because of this, maximally configured Onyx systems use one midplane for each pipeline to avoid restricting half of the 16 pipelines to a maximum of two Raster Manager boards. Slot five contains a Ktown board if the midplane is used in an Origin 2000-based system (Onyx2) or a Ktown2 board if the midplane is used in an Origin 3000-based system (Onyx 3000). The purpose of these boards is to interface the host system's XIO link to the Host Interface Processor ASIC on the Geometry board. These boards have two XIO ports for this purpose, with the top XIO port connected to the right pipeline and the bottom XIO port connected to the left pipeline. === Reality === The Reality is a cost-reduced version of the InfiniteReality2 intended to provide similar performance. Instead of using the GE14-4 Geometry Engine board and the RM7-16 or RM7-64 Raster Manager boards, the Reality used the '''GE14-2''' Geometry Engine board and the '''RM8-16''' or '''RM8-64''' Raster Manager boards. The GE14-2 has two Geometry Engine Processors, instead of four like the other models. The RM8-16 and RM864 has 16 or 64 MB of texture memory respectively and 40 MB of raster memory. The Reality was also limited by the number of Raster Manager boards it could support, one or two. When maximally configured with two RM8-64 Raster Manager boards, the Reality pipeline has 80 MB of raster memory. === InfiniteReality2E === The InfiniteReality2E was an upgrade of the InfiniteReality, marketed as the InfiniteReality2, introduced in 1998. It succeeded the InfiniteReality2 board set and was itself succeeded by the InfiniteReality3 in 2000, but was not discontinued until 10 April 2001. It improves upon the InfiniteReality by replacing the GE14-4 Geometry Engine board with the '''GE16-4''' Geometry Engine board and the RM7-16 or RM7-64 Raster Manager boards with the '''RM9-64''' Raster Manager board. The new Geometry Engine board operated at 112 MHz,<ref name="MHz">Alexander Wolfe. "Siggraph sets the stage for latest graphics". EE Times, 20 July 1998.</ref> improving geometry and image processing performance. The new Raster Manager board operated at 72 MHz,<ref name="MHz"/> improving anti-aliased pixel fill performance. == InfiniteReality3 == InfiniteReality3 was introduced in 2000 along with the [[SGI Origin 3000 and Onyx 3000|Onyx 3000]] to supersede the InfiniteReality2. It was used in the [[SGI Onyx2|Onyx2]] and Onyx 3000 visualization systems. The only improvement over the previous implementation was replacement of the RM9-64 Raster Manager with the '''RM10-256''' Raster Manager, which has 256 MB of texture memory, four times that the of the previous raster manager. When maximally configured with four Raster Managers, the InfiniteReality3 pipeline provides 320 MB of raster memory. == InfiniteReality4 == InfiniteReality4 was introduced in 2002 to succeed the InfiniteReality3. It was used in the Onyx2, Onyx 3000 and Onyx 350. It is the last member of the InfiniteReality family, itself succeeded by the ATI FireGL-based UltimateVision, which was used in the Onyx4. The only improvement over the previous implementation was the replacement of the RM10-256 Raster Manager by the '''RM11-1024''' Raster Manager, which has improved performance, 1 GB of texture memory and 2.5 GB of raster memory, four and thirty-two times that of the previous raster manager, respectively. When maximally configured with four Raster Managers, the InfiniteReality4 pipeline has 10 GB of raster memory. In a maximum configuration with 16 pipelines, the InfiniteReality4 contained 16 GB of texture memory and 160 GB of raster memory.<ref name="3-4">"SGI Onyx 300 with InfiniteReality Family Graphics Datasheet."
