For instance, user persistence on a [[website]] might be implemented via a [[HTTP cookie|cookie]] and [[relational database]] table, thus avoiding licensing costs of a session management application. Another example may be the use of a [[SOAP]] call within a loop, to provide a remote communications link to a third party, which can be implemented in a few lines of [[Source code|code]] in a modern framework. The effectiveness of lightweight design depends on a combination of the talent of the developers, and also the ownership of small, re-usable snippets of code, that have already been pre-tested, as implementing a complete application of new code takes too long to write, and cannot compete with [[commercial off-the-shelf]] software (COTS). Lightweight design works well as a replacement for major systems integration components, in cases where a powerful commercial off-the-shelf system has been used, when only a tiny part of the functionality of the COTS product is used. Its implementation is a reaction by independent software developers to major software houses recommending systems far in excess of what is required, in order to get "bums on seats." <br /> [[Category:Computing terminology]]</text> </page> <page> <id>21663</id> <title>Likejacking</title> <text>'''Likejacking''' is a [[Hacker (computer security)|malicious technique]] of tricking users of a website into posting a [[Facebook]] status update for a site they did not intentionally mean to "like."<ref name="Sophos 9783"> {{cite web | url= http://www.sophos.com/blogs/sophoslabs/?p=9783 | title= Facebook Work - "Likejacking" | last= Cohen | first= Richard | publisher= [[Sophos]] | date= 05/31/2010 | accessdate = 2010-06-05 }} </ref> The term "likejacking" came from a comment posted by Corey Ballou<ref name="corey ballou"> {{cite web | url= http://www.jqueryin.com/2010/06/02/likejacking-term-catches-on/ | title= "Likejacking" Term Catches On | last= Ballou | first= Corey | publisher= jqueryin.com | date= 06/02/2010 | accessdate = 2010-06-08 }} </ref> in the article ''How to "Like" Anything on the Web (Safely)'', which is one of the first documented postings explaining the possibility of malicious activity regarding Facebook's "like" button.<ref name="readwriteweb likejacking"> {{cite web | url= http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/likejacking_takes_off_on_facebook.php | title= "Likejacking" Takes Off on Facebook | last= Perez | first= Sarah | publisher= readwriteweb.com | date= 06/02/2010 | accessdate = 2010-06-05 }} </ref> == References == {{Reflist}} == External links == * {{cite web | url= http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20100601/ts_alt_afp/usitcompanycomputersecurityinternetfacebook_20100601213556 | title= Facebook users warned of 'likejacking' scam | publisher= [[Yahoo!]]/[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] | date= Jun 1, 2010 | accessdate = 2010=06-05 }} [[Category:Computer security]] [[Category:Facebook]] [[de:Likejacking]]</text> </page> <page> <id>21664</id> <title>Likelihood function</title> <text>In [[statistics]], a '''likelihood function''' (often simply the '''likelihood''') is a function of the [[statistical parameter | parameters]] of a [[statistical model]], defined as follows: the ''likelihood'' of a set of parameter values given some observed outcomes is equal to the ''probability'' of those observed outcomes given those parameter values. Likelihood functions play a key role in [[statistical inference]], especially methods of estimating a parameter from a set of [[statistic | statistics]]. In non-technical parlance, "likelihood" is usually a synonym for "[[probability]]" but in statistical usage, a clear technical distinction is made. One may ask "If I were to flip a fair coin 100 times, what is the ''probability'' of it landing heads-up every time?" or "Given that I have flipped a coin 100 times and it has landed heads-up 100 times, what is the ''likelihood'' that the coin is fair?" but it would be improper to switch "likelihood" and "probability" in the two sentences. Mathematically, writing ''X'' for the set of observed data and Θ for the set of parameter values, the expression ''P''(''X'' | Θ) (read "the probability of ''X'' given Θ") can be interpreted as the expression ''L''(Θ | ''X''), the likelihood of Θ given ''X''. The interpretation of ''L''(Θ | ''X'') as a function of Θ is especially obvious when ''X'' is fixed and Θ is allowed to vary. Generally, ''L''(Θ | ''X'') is permitted to be any positive multiple of ''P''(''X'' | Θ). More precisely, then, a likelihood function is any representative from an [[equivalence class]] of functions, :<math>L(\Theta \mid X) \in \left\lbrace \alpha \; P(X \mid \Theta) : \alpha > 0 \right\rbrace\,,</math> where the constant of proportionality ''α'' > 0 is not permitted to depend upon Θ. In particular, the numerical value ''L''(Θ | ''X'') alone is immaterial; all that matters are likelihood [[ratio]]s, such as those of the form :<math>\frac{L(\theta_2 | X)}{L(\theta_1 | X)} = \frac{\alpha P(X|\theta_2)}{\alpha P(X|\theta_1)} = \frac{P(X|\theta_2)}{P(X|\theta_1)} \,,</math> that are invariant with respect to the [[constant of proportionality]] ''α''. [[A. W. F. Edwards]] defined '''support''' to be the [[natural logarithm]] of the likelihood ratio, and the '''support function''' as the natural logarithm of the likelihood function (the same as the log-likelihood; see below).<ref>Edwards, A.W.F. 1972. ''Likelihood.'' Cambridge University Press, Cambridge (expanded edition, 1992, Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore). ISBN 0-8018-4443-6</ref> However, there is potential for confusion with the [[support (mathematics)|mathematical meaning of 'support']], and this terminology is not widely used outside Edwards' main applied field of [[phylogenetics]]. For more about making inferences via likelihood functions, see also the method of [[maximum likelihood]], and [[likelihood-ratio test]]ing. ==Log-likelihood== For many applications involving likelihood functions, it is more convenient to work in terms of the [[natural logarithm]]
