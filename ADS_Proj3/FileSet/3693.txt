a USB cable. == 3rd Party Software, Themes, and Utilities == There is some 3rd Party Software that people have developed to make using the RS Media easier. '''RSM Remote:''' It allows you to control most of RS Media's functions and even take a video, photo or audio recording, as well as tell him to track a certain color, all from a PC. '''iMedia Screen Theme:''' iMedia is an iPhone inspired theme for RS Media. It replaces pictures for Control Mode, Arm Mode, Guard Mode and all Media Mode related pictures. '''RS Media Time Sync:''' A handy little app which will automatically synchronize your RSMedia's time with your PC's, without the hassle of setting it via the USB or Serial Console. '''RS Media Tango! Screen Theme:''' Unleash the Linux in your RSMedia with this Tango!/GNOME screen theme. Includes graphics for Control Mode, Arm Mode Guard Mode, All Program Modes, as well as Media Mode animations which fade in and out as you scroll through them. More info and Download links for these things can be found at the [http://computersnmore.dyndns.org/blog/?page_id=21 Computers 'n' More Blog]. More Utilities, Themes and Software can also be found at [http://computersnmore.dyndns.org/ Computers 'n' More] == Personalities == A personality is a collection of the RS Media's audio responses. The RS Media ships with 4 personalities that the user can switch among using the [[remote control]]: * RS Media (default) * Service Bot 3000 - an English butler. * Space Bot - a fictional space captain * Billy-Joe Sapien - a cowboy Users may also modify the existing personalities or create their own from scratch. == Multimedia features == The RS Media is capable of recording and playing [[MP3]]'s, [[MPEG4]]'s, [[JPEG]]'s, as well as Java applications. It comes with 3 [[Java (programming language)|Java]] games that are controlled with the remote control and displayed to its LCD screen. It can also be used as an audio player via the [[stereo]] line-in port. The built-in memory can be supplemented by inserting an SD memory card (up to 1GB in size) into the SD slot. == Programming == Like other WowWee robots, the RS Media can be programmed to execute sequences of moves and audio clips either as a standalone program or as a reaction to a sound, touch or visual [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]]. The RS Media has the same programming mode as the V2, Puppet Mode, where the user can manually bend and move the robot's body parts to create a program. The most sophisticated way to program the RS Media is by use of the computer applications. == Hacking == As with other Robosapien models, the RS Media was designed with the possibility for modifications. In reference to the philosophy behind the 'hackability' of the robots, Tilden once said, "Years ago some bright [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] lads asked if I could build a competent [[humanoid]] cradle into which they could put their smart programs. Took me a while, but here it is lads, inexpensive and ready to go right out of the box. Make it think, and let me know how it goes." In spring of 2009, Helibot from the RoboCommunity has created a new driver to allow access to the Robot's Linux operating system via the USB port and a terminal program. This is now a part of the RSMedia Development Kit which is now available on SourceForge. == Availability == The RS Media was released in October 2006 in [[Australia]] and the [[UK]]. == External links == *[http://www.wowwee.com/en/products/toys/robots/robotics/robosapiens:rs-media RS Media at WowWee] {{WowWee Robots}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Rs Media}} [[Category:Entertainment robots]] [[Category:Humanoid robots]]</text> </page> <page> <id>31074</id> <title>RTML</title> <text>{{for|the XML dialect for telescope control|Remote Telescope Markup Language}} [[Image:RTML Linkpath-loop.png|right|thumb|350px|RTML code in the editor]] '''RTML''' is a proprietary [[programming language]] used exclusively by [[Yahoo!]]'s '''Yahoo! Store''' and '''Yahoo! Site''' [[web hosting service]]s. ==History== The language originated at [[Viaweb]], a company founded in 1995 by [[Paul Graham (computer programmer)|Paul Graham]] and [[Robert Tappan Morris|Robert T. Morris]], as the template language for their [[electronic commerce|e-commerce]] platform. RTML stands for "Robert T. Morris Language". The RTML editor was offered as an option for customers (usually [[small business]]es) who wanted to customize their [[Online shop|online stores]] more than the built-in templates allowed. The built-in templates were also written in RTML, and provided the starting point for most people who used the language. In 1998, Yahoo! bought Viaweb for $49.6 million and renamed the service '''Yahoo! Store'''. Yahoo! later offered the RTML-based [[content management system]] in a hosting platform without a [[shopping cart]], under the name '''Yahoo! Site'''<ref>http://site.yahoo.com/</ref>. In 2003, Yahoo! renamed the '''Yahoo! Store''' service '''''Yahoo! Merchant Solutions''''' (part of '''[[Yahoo!#Small_business|Yahoo! Small Business]]'''), and at the same time began offering new customers the choice of a more standard [[PHP]]/[[MySQL]] web hosting environment instead of the RTML-based Store Editor. {{As of|2006}}, many new Yahoo! Merchant Solutions sites and legacy Yahoo! Stores continue to be built using the Store Editor and RTML. ==Language== Although Yahoo!'s documentation does not mention it, RTML is actually implemented on top of a [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]]-based system. The language is somewhat unique in that the programmer cannot edit the source code directly as text. Instead, keywords are presented as [[hyperlink]]s in a [[web browser|browser]]-based [[HTML]] interface. Clicking on a keyword selects it, and its attributes can be edited. Blocks of code can be pushed and popped from a clipboard, using the [[Stack (data structure)|stack metaphor]]. The editor maintains the code's [[s-expression]] structure automatically, and visually represents it in the web interface using [[indentation]] instead of Lisp's [[Bracket#Parentheses_%28_%29|parentheses]]. Most of the keywords correspond to [[HTML]] elements, but there are also [[conditional]]s, [[recursion]], and other [[control flow]] features that make it a "real" programming language. RTML templates are evaluated dynamically for each pageview during editing, but for the live site a "publish" process generates static HTML files from them. ==Abbreviation== Yahoo!'s documentation used to say that RTML was an [[acronym]] for "Real Time Markup Language," but Graham admitted that "we made up various explanations for what RTML was supposed to stand for, but actually I named it
