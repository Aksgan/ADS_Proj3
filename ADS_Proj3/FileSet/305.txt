Just unplug the router, press and hold reset button, plug in the router and wait until Power LED is flashing, then use tftp as follows: * ~ > tftp 192.168.1.1 * tftp> binary * tftp> verbose * tftp> get ASUSSPACELINKaaaa /dev/null * getting from 192.168.1.1:ASUSSPACELINKaaaa to /dev/null [octet] * tftp> put YOURFIRMWARE.TRX ASUSSPACELINK NOTE : "get" command seems to be unsupported by Asus WL-520gC -> try the following procedure * ~ > tftp 192.168.1.1 * tftp> binary * tftp> verbose * tftp> put yourfirmware.bin ==See also== * Alternative firmware ** [[DD-WRT]] ** [[FreeWRT]] ** [[OpenWRT]] ** [[Sveasoft]] ** [[Tomato Firmware]] ** [http://wl500g.googlecode.com WL500g Project] ==External links== * [http://www.asus.com/ Asus] ===References=== {{reflist}} {{ASUS}} {{Linux devices}} [[Category:Networking hardware]] [[Category:Hardware routers]] [[Category:Wireless networking]] [[Category:Linux-based devices]]</text> </page> <page> <id>2624</id> <title>Asymptote</title> <text>{{Other uses}} [[File:1-over-x-plus-x abs.svg|right|thumb|200px|The graph of a function with a horizontal, vertical, and oblique asymptote.]] [[File:Asymptote02.png|right|thumb|200px|A curve intersecting an asymptote infinitely many times.]] In [[analytic geometry]], an '''asymptote''' of a [[curve]] is a line such that the distance between the curve and the line approaches zero as they tend to infinity.

Horizontal asymptotes are horizontal lines that the graph of the function approaches as ''x'' tends to {{nowrap|+&infin; or &minus;&infin;.}} Vertical asymptotes are vertical lines near which the function grows without bound. More generally, one curve is a ''curvilinear asymptote'' of another (as opposed to a ''linear asymptote'') if the distance between the two curves tends to zero as they tend to infinity, although usually the term ''asymptote'' by itself is reserved for linear asymptotes. Asymptotes convey much of the information about the behavior of curves ''in the large'', and determining the asymptotes of a function is an important step in sketching its graph.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Apostol | first1=Tom M. | author1-link=Tom M.

The ''x'' and ''y''-axes are the asymptotes.]] The idea that a curve may come arbitrarily close to a line without actually becoming the same may seem counter to everyday experience. The representations of a line and a curve as marks on a piece of paper or as pixels on a computer screen have a positive width. So if they were to be extended far enough they would seem to merge together, at least as far as the eye could discern. But these are physical representations of the corresponding mathematical entities; the line and the curve are idealized concepts whose width is 0 (see [[Line (geometry)|Line]]). Therefore the understanding of the idea of an asymptote requires an effort of reason rather than experience. Consider the graph of the equation ''y''=1/''x'' shown to the right. The coordinates of the points on the curve are of the form (''x'', 1/''x'') where ''x'' is a number other than 0. For example, the graph contains the points (1, 1), (2, 0.5), (5, 0.2), (10, 0.1), …. As the values of ''x'' become larger and larger, say 100, 1000, 10,000 …, putting them far to the right of the illustration, the corresponding values of ''y'', .01, .001, .0001, …, become microscopic relative to the scale shown. But no matter how large ''x'' becomes, its reciprocal 1/''x'' is never 0, so the curve never actually touches the ''x''-axis. Similarly, as the values of ''x'' become smaller and smaller, say .01, .001, .0001, …, making them microscopic relative to the scale shown, the corresponding values of ''y'', 100, 1000, 10,000 …, become larger and larger. So the curve extends farther and farther upward as it comes closer and closer to the ''y''-axis. Thus, both the ''x'' and ''y''-axes are asymptotes of the curve. These ideas are part of the basis of concept of a [[Limit of a function|limit]] in mathematics, and this connection is explained more fully below.<ref>Reference for section: [http://books.google.com/books?id=HTwi2M37rQAC&pg=PA541 "Asymptote"] [[Penny Cyclopædia|''The Penny Cyclopædia'']] vol. 2, The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (1841) Charles Knight
