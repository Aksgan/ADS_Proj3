And since a Brahman is considered to be anyone irrespective of religious belief, Hinduism is monistic. === Buddhism === [[Buddhist]] philosophy is generally suspicious of [[ontology]]. [[The Buddha]] himself, and some of his prominent disciples such as [[Nagarjuna]], discouraged ontological theorizing for its own sake. According to the [[Pali Canon]], both pluralism (naanatta) and monism (ekatta) are speculative [[View (Buddhism)|views]]. A [[Theravada]] commentary notes that the former is similar to or associated with nihilism (ucchedavada), and the latter is similar to or associated with eternalism ([[sassatavada]]).<ref>[[David Kalupahana]], ''Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism.'' The University Press of Hawaii, 1975, page 88. The passage is SN 2.77.</ref> See [[middle way]]. Among the [[Madhyamaka]] school of Mahayana Buddhist philosophy, the ultimate nature of the world is described as [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]], which is indistinguishable from material form. That appears to be a monist position, but the Madhyamaka views - including variations like [[Prasangika]] and [[Yogacara]] and the more modern [[shentong]] Tibetan position - will fail to assert in the ultimate nature any particular point of view. They instead deconstruct any assertions about ultimate existence as resulting in absurd consequences. The doctrine of emptiness is also found in earlier Theravada Buddhist literature.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} In [[Soto Zen]] teaching, it is said that "All is One and All is Different." Since non-dualism does not recognize a dualism between Oneness and Difference, or even between dualism and non-dualism, it is difficult to state the meaning of this doctrine. All discussion of this teaching by Soto Zen masters falls under the Buddhist concept of [[skill in means]], which is to say, not literally correct, but suitable for leading others to the Truth. Chinese Soto (Cao-Dong) master Tozan ([[Tung Shan]], Dongshan) wrote the [[Verses of the Five Ranks]] (of the Ideal and the Actual), which is also important as a set of koans in the Rinzai school. Dongshan describes the Fifth Rank in part thus: Unity Attained:<br> Who dares to equal him<br> Who falls into neither being nor non-being! Shih-t'ou Hsi-ch'ien's poem "The Harmony of Difference and Sameness" [[Sandokai]] is an important early expression of Zen Buddhism and is chanted in Sōtō temples to this day. Another poem of Tung-shan Liang-chieh on these and related themes, "The Song of the Jewel Mirror Awareness", is also chanted in Sōtō temples daily. Other expressions of this teaching include the [[koan]]: A disciple asked, "What is the difference between the enlightened and the unenlightened man?" The Master replied, "The unenlightened man sees a difference, but the enlightened man does not." and [[Dogen]] Zenji's personal koan, "Why are training and enlightenment differentiated, since the Truth is universal?"

Most Christians maintain that God created the universe [[ex nihilo]] and not from himself, nor within himself, so that the creator is not to be confused with creation, but rather [[transcendence (religion)|transcends]] it (metaphysical dualism)(cf. [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]). Even the more immanent concepts and theologies are to be defined together with God's omnipotence, omnipresence and omniscience, due to God's desire for intimate contact with his own creation (cf. Acts 17:27) Another use of the term "monism" is in [[Christian anthropology]] to refer to the innate nature of humankind as being [[holistic]], as usually opposed to [[bipartite (theology)|bipartite]] and [[tripartite (theology)|tripartite]] views. While the Christian view of reality is dualistic (in regard to metaphysics) in that it holds to the Creator's transcendence of creation, it rejects other types of dualism (or pluralism) such as the idea that God must compete with other equal powers such as [[Satan]] (cf [[Gospel of John]] 14:30). In ''[[On Free Choice of the Will]]'', [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] argued, in the context of [[the problem of evil]], that evil is not the opposite of good, but rather merely the absence of good, something that does not have existence in itself. Likewise, [[C. S. Lewis]] described evil as a "parasite" in ''[[Mere Christianity]]'', as he viewed evil as something that cannot exist without good to provide it with existence. Lewis went on to argue against dualism from the basis of [[moral absolutism]], and rejected the dualistic notion that God and [[Satan]] are opposites, arguing instead that God has no equal, hence no opposite. Lewis rather viewed Satan as the opposite of [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the archangel]]. In [[Catholic Church|Catholic Christianity]], while human beings are not ontologically identical with the Creator, they are nonetheless capable with uniting with his Divine Nature via [[theosis]]. In addition to this supernatural union, [[St. John of the Cross]] says, "it must be known that God dwells and is present substantially in every soul, even in that of the greatest sinner in the world, and this union is natural." [[St. Julian of Norwich]], while maintaining the orthodox duality of Creator and creature, nonetheless speaks of God as "the true Father and true Mother" of all natures; thus, he indwells them substantially and thus preserves them from annihilation, as without this sustaining indwelling everything would cease to exist. However, some heterodox theologians are monists, such as [[Paul Tillich]]. Since God is He "in whom we live and move and have our being" ([[Book of Acts]] 17.28), it follows that everything that has being partakes in God. Dualism with regard to God and creation also barred the possibility of a mystical union with God, as [[John Calvin]] rejected{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}, according to [[Max Weber]] in ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism''.
