Island (film)|Shutter Island]] and [[Fire of Conscience]] are two of the first movies to be classified as this rating. This rating is used for 18+ movies released after April 14, 2010. Any 18+ movies shown in cinemas after April 14, 2010, will be classified as '''18'''. The rating still uses the circle sign that the previous ratings '''18SG''', '''18SX''', '''18PA''' and '''18PL''' used. Any movies previously classified using the old 18+ ratings will now be re-classified as '''18'''. However, video classification that still rated as the previous 18+ ratings is still valid. Category '''U''' and '''PG-13''' are unrestricted, only '''18''' is a restricted category. Prior to April 2010, there were four 18+ classification with two letters added, however, it has been abolished due to direction by the Film Censorship Board. The ratings are listed below: *'''18SG''' (''Seram, Ganas'', literally Graphic Violence and Horror/Terror) - Under 18 requires an accompanying adult. Film contains strong violence, gore or horror/terror that people may find objectionable. *'''18SX''' (''Seks'', literally Sexual Content) - Under 18 requires an accompanying adult. Film contains sex scenes, nudity and/or sexual dialogues/references that people may find objectionable. *'''18PA''' (''Politik, Agama'', literally Strong Religious or Political Elements) - Under 18 requires an accompanying adult. Film contains elements which include religious, social or political aspects that people may find objectionable. *'''18PL''' (''Pelbagai'', literally Variety) - Under 18 requires an accompanying adult. Film may contain strong violence, gore, horror/terror, sex scenes, nudity, sexual dialogues/references, religious, social and/or political aspects people may find objectionable. (Example: A film with strong violence and sexual references will be classified as '''18PL'''). All film and cinema advertisements in newspapers must clearly show the classification for a movie. Some cinema advertisements on newspapers classified all movies as "'''U'''" unless stated. All three ratings that was currently used also covers videos. Due to piracy of music CDs and DVD/VCDs in Malaysia, all original DVD/VCD/Blu-ray disc of a video is required to have a hologram sticker with the words "Tulen KPDN & HEP Original" and a sticker of a movie certification by Lembaga Penapisan Filem Malaysia with a signature with the word "Pengerusi Lembaga Penapisan Filem Malaysia", a serial number of a DVD/VCD/Blu-ray disc and a classification of a video before it can be sold. ==Maldives== With the formation of [http://nbc.gov.mv/app.php '''National Bureau of Classification''' ] on December 29, 2005, a new classification regulation and a new rating system for movies were introduced. A classification certificate must be obtained first, before a movie or a movie-related production is released for commercial use including its trailers. NBC has the authority to cut scenes from movies. Classification certificates issued are based on the following categories: [[Image:New NBC film ratings.jpg]] * '''G''' - General viewing. No material that may evoke fear or concern, no violence, no sexual acts, no language, no drug abuse, no nudity. * '''PG''' - Parental Guidance. No material that may evoke fear or concern, no violence, no sexual acts, no language, no drug abuse, no nudity. However, viewing films of this category requires parental guidance. This rating is rarely used. *'''12+''' - For viewers aged 12 and above. Mild violence, no sexual acts, infrequent harsh language, light drug abuse in productions that target this age group. *'''15+''' - For viewers aged 15 and above.

Violence, nudity, sex scenes and strong language are released for educational, artistic and intellectual purposes under this category. Frontal nudity and sex scenes are censored. Pornography is banned. ==Malta== In [[Malta]], the vast majority of [[motion pictures]] do not receive a separate release/distribution, which means that local distributors import [[DVD]]s and [[Blu-ray Disc]]s that bear classifications appointed in other countries: mainly, [[Great Britain]] and the [[United States]]. Motion picture consumers, therefore, refer to the [[BBFC]], or its North American counterpart, for viewership guidance. Where public viewing is concerned, however, by rule of law, distributors must submit motion pictures to be shown in cinemas, for example, or for theatre reproduction, to a Government-appointed Board of Film and Stage Classification, which classifies productions in one of the following criteria: *'''U (Universal)''' - Suitable for all. *'''PG (Parental Guidance)''' - Some material may be unsuitable for younger children. Children under the age of 12 are to be accompanied by an adult. *'''12''' - Suitable only for persons 12 years and older. Nobody under this age will be admitted. *'''14''' - Suitable only for persons 14 years and older. Nobody under this age will be admitted. *'''16''' - Suitable only for persons 16 years and older. Nobody under this age will be admitted. *'''18''' - Suitable only for persons 18 years and older. Nobody under this age will be admitted. *'''Banned''' - As a final resort, there are instances in which a few motion pictures as well as theatre productions have been banned from public viewing. This ban also extends to hardcore as well as softcore pornographic material, which remains illegal in the country as of 2010. Naturally, since Maltese authorities regulate only public viewing material, it remains possible to acquire a film that the Board of Film and Stage Classification have classified as '''Banned''' at a DVD/Blu-ray disk shop, provided the shop imports from countries where the film has not been denied distribution, or is otherwise restricted. One example of such a film, available at local DVD shops yet banned for public viewing at the nation's cinemas, is [[Ken Park]]. In spite of the widespread importation practices described above, pornographic material generally remains unavailable at local shops. Unlike the BBFC, the Board of Film and Stage Classification does not cut motion pictures per se: the last motion picture
