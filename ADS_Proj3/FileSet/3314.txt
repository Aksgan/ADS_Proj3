The name OpenType was chosen for the combined technologies, and the technology was announced later that year. ===Open Font Format=== Adobe and Microsoft continued to develop and refine OpenType over the next decade. Then, in late 2005, OpenType began migrating to an open standard under the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) within the [[MPEG]] group, which had previously (in 2003) adopted OpenType 1.4 by reference for [[MPEG-4]].<ref name="OFF-chiariglione">{{cite web |url=http://mpeg.chiariglione.org/technologies/mpeg-4/mp04-off/index.htm |title=ISO/IEC 14496-22 "Open Font Format" |author=ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 11 |publisher=chiariglione.org |date=2008-07 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200508/081505OpenTypeISO.html |title=ISO To Adopt OpenType File Format as Font Standard For MPEG-4 |publisher=Adobe Systems Incorporated |date=2005-08-15 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/sc29/open/29view/29n55201.doc |title=Referencing Explanatory Report to accompany FPDAM/FDAM Submission of ISO/IEC 14496 – 11/Amd.2, Referenced Specification: The OpenType font format specification, version 1.4. |date=2003-07 |format=DOC |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/sc29/open/29view/29n6929t.doc |title=Combined CD Registration and CD Consideration Ballot on ISO/IEC CD 14496-22: Information technology -- Coding of audio-visual objects -- Part 22: Open Font Format - SC 29/WG 11 N 7485 |date=2005-09-01 |format=DOC |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> Adoption of the new standard reached formal approval in March 2007 as ISO Standard ISO/IEC 14496-22 (MPEG-4 Part 22) called '''Open Font Format''' (OFF).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=43466 |title=ISO/IEC 14496-22:2007 - Information technology -- Coding of audio-visual objects -- Part 22: Open Font Format |publisher=ISO |date=2009-07-31 |accessdate=2009-11-11}}</ref> It is also sometimes referred to as "Open Font Format Specification" (OFFS).<ref name="OFF-chiariglione" /> The standard is technically equivalent to OpenType 1.4 specification, with appropriate language changes for ISO.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c043466_ISO_IEC_14496-22_2007(E).zip |title=ISO/IEC 14496-22, First edition 2007-03-15, Information technology — Coding of audio-visual objects — Part 22: Open Font Format |format=ZIP |date=2007-03-15 |author=ISO |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> The second edition of the Open Font Format was published in 2009 (ISO/IEC 14496-22:2009) and it is declared as "technically equivalent" to the "OpenType font format specification".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=52136 |title=ISO/IEC 14496-22:2009 - Information technology -- Coding of audio-visual objects -- Part 22: Open Font Format |publisher=ISO |date=2009-07-31 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c052136_ISO_IEC_14496-22_2009(E).zip |title=ISO/IEC 14496-22, Second edition 2009-08-15, Information technology — Coding of audio-visual objects — Part 22: Open Font Format |format=ZIP |date=2009-08-15 |author=ISO |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> It is a free, publicly available standard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html |title=Publicly Available Standards |publisher=Standards.iso.org |date= |accessdate=2009-11-11}}</ref> By 2001 hundreds of OpenType fonts were on the market. Adobe finished converting their entire font library to OpenType toward the end of 2002. {{As of|2005|alt=As of early 2005}}, around 10,000 OpenType fonts had become available, with the Adobe library comprising about a third of the total. By 2006, every major [[Type foundry|font foundry]] and many minor ones were developing fonts in OpenType format. ==Description== <gallery align="right" perrow="1"> File:Circle and quadratic bezier.svg|TrueType outlines use quadratic [[Bézier curve|Bézier splines]]. File:Circle and cubic bezier.svg|CFF outlines use cubic Bézier splines. </gallery> OpenType uses the general [[sfnt]] structure of a TrueType font, but it adds several [[smartfont]] options that enhance the font's typographic and language support capabilities. The [[glyph]] [[outline font|outline data]] in an OpenType font may be in one of two formats: either TrueType format outlines in a 'glyf' table, or [[Compact Font Format]] (CFF) outlines in a 'CFF ' table. CFF outline data is based on the [[PostScript]] language Type 2 font format. The table name 'CFF ' is four characters long, ending in a space character. However, the OpenType specification does not support the use of PostScript outlines in a TrueType Collection font file. For many purposes, such as layout, it doesn't matter what the outline data format is, but for some purposes, such as [[rasterisation]], it is significant. The term "OpenType" doesn't specify outline data format. Sometimes terms like "OpenType (PostScript flavor)", "Type 1 OpenType", "OpenType CFF", or "OpenType (TrueType flavor)" are used to indicate which outline format a particular OpenType font contains. OpenType has several distinctive features: * The font [[character encoding]] is based on [[Unicode]] and can support any script (or multiple scripts at once). * OpenType fonts can have up to 65,536 glyphs. * Fonts can have advanced typographic features that allow proper typographic treatment of complex scripts and advanced typographic effects for simpler scripts, such as the [[Roman alphabet|Latin]] script used in writing [[English language|English]]. * Font files are intended to be cross-platform, and can be used without modification on Mac OS, Windows and some Unix systems. * If no additional glyphs or extensive typographic features are added, OpenType CFF fonts can be considerably smaller than their Type 1 counterparts. ==Comparison to other formats== Compared with [[Apple Computer]]’s "GX Typography"—now called [[Apple Advanced Typography]] (AAT)—and with the [[SIL International|SIL]]’s [[Graphite (SIL)|Graphite]] technology, OpenType is less flexible in typographic options, but superior in language-related options and support.{{Clarify me|date=February 2009}} OpenType has been much more successful than AAT and Graphite. There are many more fonts and supporting applications, despite AAT being an older technology. The single-platform nature of AAT and the lack of support from any major software vendor other than Apple itself are both likely factors in this.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} The [[free software]] Graphite technology is not endorsed by major software vendors. From a font developer’s perspective, OpenType is, for many common situations, easier to develop for than AAT or Graphite. First, the simple declarative substitutions and positioning of OpenType are more readily understood than AAT’s more complex state tables or the Graphite description language that resembles [[C syntax]]. Second, Adobe’s strategy of licensing at no charge the [[source code]] developed for its own font development, AFDKO (Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType), allowed third-party font editing applications such as [[FontLab]] and FontMaster to add support with relative ease. Although Adobe’s text-driven coding support is not as visual as Microsoft’s separate tool, VOLT (Visual OpenType Layout Tool), the integration with the tools being used to make the fonts has been well received. Another difference is that an OpenType support framework (such as Microsoft’s [[Uniscribe]]) needs to provide a fair bit of knowledge about special language processing issues to handle (for example: Arabic). With AAT or
