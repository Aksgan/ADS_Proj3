useful. Electronic circuit instruments called [[analog computers]] were used to speed up circuit construction time. However analog computers like the [[norden bombsight]] could also consist of gears and pulleys in calculation. Examples are Vogel and Ewel who published 'An Electrical Analog of a Trophic Pyramid' (1972, Chpt 11, pp. 105–121), Elmore and Sands (1949) who published circuits devised for research in nuclear physics and the study of fast electrical transients done under the Manhattan Project (however no circuits having application to weapon technology were included for security reasons), and [[Howard T. Odum]] (1994) who published circuits devised to analogically model ecological-economic systems at many scales of the geobiosphere. ==Philosophical conundrum== The process of analogical modelling has philosophical difficulties. As noted in the [http://setis.library.usyd.edu.au/stanford/entries/models-science/#ModLawNat Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy], there is the question of how the physical/biological laws of the target system relate to the analogical models created by humans to represent the target system. We seem to assume that the process of constructing analogical models gives us access to the fundamental laws governing the target system. However strictly speaking we only have empirical knowledge of the laws that hold true for the analogical system, and if the time constant for the target system is larger than the life cycle of human being (as in the case of the geobiosphere) it is therefore very difficult for any single human to empirically verify the validity of the extension of the laws of their model to the target system in their life time. ==Quotation== *"Good mathematicians see analogies.

The theory describes dynamical phenomena which occur on objects modelled by fractals. It studies questions such as "how does heat diffuse in a fractal?" and "How does a fractal vibrate?" In the smooth case the operator that occurs most often in the equations modelling these questions is the [[Laplacian]], so the starting point for the theory of analysis on fractals is to define a Laplacian on fractals. This turns out not to be a full [[differential operator]] in the usual sense but has many of the desired properties. There are a number of approaches to defining the Laplacian: probabilistic, analytical or measure theoretic. ==See also== * [[Time scale calculus]] for dynamic equations on a [[cantor set]]. *[[Differential geometry]] *[[Discrete differential geometry]] *[[Abstract differential geometry]] *[[F^alpha calculas]] ==References== * {{cite book| author=Christoph Bandt, Siegfried Graf, Martina Zähle| title = Fractal Geometry and Stochastics II | publisher = Birkhäuser| year = 2000 | isbn = 9783764362157}} * {{cite book| author=Jun Kigami| title = Analysis on Fractals | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2001 | isbn = 9780521793216}} * {{cite book| author=Robert S.

It was invented in the 1970s in the United States by Pierre Janin of Analytab Products, Inc. [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=3936356.PN.&OS=PN/3936356&RS=PN/3936356] Presently, the API test system is manufactured by bioMeriux.[http://www.biomerieux-diagnostics.com/servlet/srt/bio/clinical-diagnostics/dynPage?doc=CNL_PRD_CPL_G_PRD_CLN_11] The API range introduced a standardized, miniaturized version of existing techniques, which up until then were complicated to perform and difficult to read. The API 20E/NE fast identification system combines some conventional tests and allows the identification of a limited number of [[Gram-negative]] [[Enterobacteriaceae]] or non-Enterobacteriaceae. The test systems are stored in 20 small reaction tubes, which include the substrates. An identification is only possible with [[microbiological culture]]. To guarantee a comparability of different samples, follow the introductions of the manufacturer. Before starting a test, it must be sure, the culture is an Enterobacteriaceae or not. To test it, a quick oxidase test for [[cytochrome c oxidase]] is mandatory. Here, Non-Enterobacteriaceae are cytochrome c oxidase positive and Enterobacteriaceae are negative. Cytochrome c oxidase is the terminal [[enzyme]] of the [[electron transport chain]], in which the [[oxidation]] of [[cytochrome c]] and [[reduction (chemistry)|reduction]] of O<sub>2</sub> is organized. The enzyme is localized in the [[mitochondria]] of [[eukaryotes]] and in the [[plasma membrane]] of several bacteria. HINT: This system is developed for quick identification of clinically relevant bacteria. Because of it, only known bacteria can be identified.
