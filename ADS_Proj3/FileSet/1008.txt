As the curtain wall is non-structural it can be made of a lightweight material reducing construction costs. When glass is used as the curtain wall, a great advantage is that natural light can penetrate deeper within the building. The curtain wall [[façade]] does not carry any [[dead and live loads|dead load weight]] from the building other than its own dead load weight. The wall transfers horizontal wind loads that are incident upon it to the main building structure through connections at floors or columns of the building. A curtain [[wall]] is designed to resist air and water infiltration, sway induced by wind and [[seismic]] forces acting on the building, and its own dead load weight forces. Curtain walls are typically designed with extruded aluminum members, although the first curtain walls were made of steel. The aluminium frame is typically infilled with glass, which provides an architecturally pleasing building, as well as benefits such as [[daylighting]]. However, parameters related to solar gain control such as [[thermal comfort]] and visual comfort are more difficult to control when using highly-glazed curtain walls. Other common [[infill]]s include: stone veneer, metal panels, [[Louver|louvers]], and operable windows or vents. Curtain walls differ from store-front systems in that they are designed to span multiple floors, and take into consideration design requirements such as: thermal expansion and contraction; [[tuned mass damper|building sway]] and movement; water diversion; and thermal efficiency for cost-effective heating, cooling, and lighting in the building. ==History== [[Image:Oriel_chambers.jpg|thumb|right|Oriel Chambers, Liverpool, England,1864.

The development and widespread use of structural steel and later reinforced concrete allowed relatively small columns to support large loads and the exterior walls of buildings were no longer required for structural support. The exterior walls could be non-load bearing and thus much lighter and more open than the masonry load bearing walls of the past. This gave way to increased use of glass as an exterior façade and the modern day curtain wall was born. [[Oriel Chambers]] in [[Liverpool]], [[England]], was the world's first metal framed glass curtain walled building in 1864, followed by [[16 Cook Street]], [[Liverpool]], in 1866. Both buildings were designed and built by local architect [[Peter Ellis (architect)|Peter Ellis]]. The extensive glass walls allowed light to penetrate further into the building utilising more floor space and reducing lighting costs in short winter months. [[Oriel Chambers]] comprises {{convert|43000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} set over a maximum of five floors as the elevator had not been invented.<ref name="Oriel Chambers History">{{cite web|url=http://www.orielchambers.co.uk/#/411|title=History|publisher=Oriel Chambers|accessdate=27 July 2009}}</ref> Some of the first curtain walls were made with steel [[mullions]] and the plate glass was attached to the mullions with asbestos or fiberglass modified glazing compound. Eventually [[silicone]] [[sealant]]s or glazing tape were substituted. Some designs included an outer cap to hold the glass in place and to protect the integrity of the seals. The [[Lever House|first curtain wall]] installed in [[New York City]] was this type of construction. Earlier [[modernist]] examples are the [[Bauhaus]] in [[Dessau]] and the [[Hallidie Building]] in [[San Francisco]]. The 1970’s began the widespread use of aluminum [[extrusion]]s for mullions. Aluminum offers the unique advantage of being able to be easily extruded into nearly any shape required for design and aesthetic purposes. Today, the design complexity and shapes available are nearly limitless. Custom shapes can be designed and manufactured with relative ease. Similarly, sealing methods and types have evolved over the years, and as a result, today’s curtain walls are high performance systems which require little maintenance. ;Stick systems The vast majority of curtain walls are installed long pieces (referred to as ''sticks'') between floors vertically and between vertical members horizontally. Framing members may be fabricated in a shop, but all installation and [[glazing in architecture|glazing]] is typically performed at the jobsite. ;Unitized systems Unitized curtain walls entail factory fabrication and assembly of panels and may include factory glazing. These completed units are hung on the building structure to form the building enclosure. Unitized curtain wall has the advantages of: speed; lower field installation costs; and quality control within an interior climate controlled environment. The economic benefits are typically realized on large projects or in areas of high field labor rates. ;Rainscreen principle A common feature in curtain wall technology, the rainscreen principle theorizes that equilibrium of air pressure
