the connection (such as [[STUN]]), while others are based on relaying all data through it (such as [[TURN]]), which adds bandwidth costs and increases latency, detrimental to real-time voice and video communications. Network address translation breaks [[end-to-end connectivity]]. Intercepting and modifying traffic can only be performed transparently in the absence of secure encryption and authentication. Most NAT behavior-based techniques bypass enterprise security policies. Enterprise security experts prefer techniques that explicitly cooperate with NAT and firewalls, allowing NAT traversal while still enabling marshalling at the NAT to enforce enterprise security policies. From this point of view, the most promising IETF standards are [[Realm-Specific IP]] (RSIP) and [[Middlebox]] Communications (MIDCOM). [[SOCKS]], the oldest NAT traversal protocol, is still widely available. In home/[[SOHO network|SOHO]] settings, [[Universal Plug and Play]] (UPnP) is supported by most small NAT gateways. [[NAT-T]] is commonly used by [[IPsec]] [[VPN]] clients in order to have [[IPsec#Encapsulating Security Payload|ESP]] packets traverse NAT. ==The NAT traversal problem== NAT devices are installed to alleviate the [[IPv4 address exhaustion|exhaustion]] of the [[IPv4]] address space by allowing the use of private IP addresses on home and corporate networks (internal networks) behind routers with a single public [[IP address]] facing the public Internet. The internal network devices are enabled to communicate with hosts on the external network by changing the source address of outgoing requests to that of the NAT device and relaying replies back to the originating device. This leaves the internal network ill-suited to host servers, as the NAT device has no automatic method of determining the internal host for which incoming packets are destined. This problem has not generally been relevant to home users behind NAT devices for general web access and e-mail. However, applications such as [[peer-to-peer]] file sharing (such as [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] or [[Gnutella]] applications), [[VoIP]] services (such as [[Session Initiation Protocol]]) and the online services of current generation video game consoles (such as the [[Xbox 360]]'s [[Xbox Live]] or the [[PS3]]'s [[PlayStation Network]]) require clients to be servers as well, thereby posing a problem for users behind NAT devices, as incoming requests cannot be easily correlated to the proper internal host. Furthermore many of these types of services carry IP address and port number information in the application data, potentially requiring substitution or special traversal techniques for NAT traversal. ==NAT traversal and IPsec== In order for [[IPsec]] to work through a NAT, the following protocols need to be allowed on the firewall: * Internet Key Exchange (IKE) - User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port 500 * Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) - IP protocol number 50 * Authentication Header (AH) - IP protocol number 51 or, in case of [[NAT-T]]: * IPsec NAT-T - UDP port 4500 Often this is accomplished on home routers by enabling "IPsec Passthrough". In Windows XP, NAT-T is enabled by default, but in XP with SP2, has been disabled by default for the case when the VPN server is also behind a NAT device, because of a rare and controversial security issue<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/885348/en-us|title=IPSec NAT-T is not recommended for Windows Server 2003 computers that are behind network address translators|publisher=Microsoft knowledge base #885348}}</ref>. IPsec NAT-T patches are also available for Windows 2000, Windows NT and Windows 98. One usage of NAT-T and IPsec is to enable [[opportunistic encryption]] between systems. NAT-T allows systems behind NATs to request and establish secure connections on demand. ==IETF references== * RFC 1579 - Firewall Friendly FTP * RFC 2663 - IP Network Address Translator (NAT) Terminology and Considerations * RFC 2709 - Security Model with Tunnel-mode IPsec for NAT Domains * RFC 2993 - Architectural Implications of NAT * RFC 3022 - Traditional IP Network Address Translator (Traditional NAT) * RFC 3027 - Protocol Complications with the IP Network Address Translator (NAT) * RFC 3235 - Network Address Translator (NAT)-Friendly Application Design Guidelines * RFC 3715 - IPsec-Network Address Translation (NAT) Compatibility * RFC 3947 - Negotiation of NAT-Traversal in the IKE * RFC 5128 - State of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Communication across Network Address Translators (NATs) ==See also== ===NAT traversal protocols and techniques based on NAT behavior=== *[[Session Traversal Utilities for NAT]] (STUN) *[[Traversal Using Relay NAT]] (TURN) *[[NAT-T]] Negotiation of NAT-Traversal in the IKE *[[Teredo tunneling]] uses NAT traversal to provide [[IPv6]] connectivity. *[[Session Border Controller]] (SBC) *[[UDP hole punching]] *[[TCP hole punching]] *[[ICMP hole punching]] ===NAT traversal based on NAT control=== *[[Realm-Specific IP]] (RSIP) *[[Middlebox]] Communications (MIDCOM) *[[SOCKS]] *[[NAT Port Mapping Protocol]] (NAT PMP) *[[Internet Gateway Device Protocol|Internet Gateway Device]] (IGD) Protocol, defined by the [[Universal Plug and Play]] (UPnP) Forum. *[[Application Layer Gateway]] (ALG) ===NAT traversal combining several techniques=== *[[Interactive Connectivity Establishment]] (ICE) ===University research papers=== *[http://nutss.gforge.cis.cornell.edu/pub/imc05-tcpnat/ Cornell University - Characterization and Measurement of TCP Traversal through NATs and Firewalls] *[http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~library/TR-repository/reports/reports-2004/cucs-039-04.pdf Columbia University - An Analysis of the Skype Peer-to-Peer Internet Telephony] *[http://www.brynosaurus.com/pub/net/p2pnat/ Peer to peer communication across Network Address Translators (UDP Hole Punching)] *[http://blog.sebastien.raveau.name/2009/06/internet-by-all-means.html Internet By All Means - An article on how to maximize your chances to get around firewalls] ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== * [http://nattest.net.in.tum.de NAT-Traversal Test] * [http://www.heise-online.co.uk/security/How-Skype-Co-get-round-firewalls--/features/82481 How Skype & Co. get round firewalls] [[Category:Computer network security]] [[Category:Network protocols]] [[Category:Network Address Translation]] [[es:NAT transversal]] [[ja:NAT traversal]] [[ru:NAT traversal]] [[zh:NAT穿透]]</text> </page> <page> <id>25576</id> <title>NCR VRX</title> <text>{{Unreferenced stub|auto=yes|date=December 2009}} ==VRX - VRX/E== '''VRX''' is an acronym for '''Virtual Resource eXecutive''', a proprietary [[operating system]] on the [[NCR Criterion]] series, and later the V-8000 series of [[mainframe computer]]s manufactured by [[NCR Corporation]] during the 1970s and 1980s.
