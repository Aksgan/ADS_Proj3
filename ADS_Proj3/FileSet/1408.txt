of equipment, keys and credit cards. An effective exit procedure consists of documented standard processes that are carried out for each person who has ceased employment as well as measures to ensure that cessations are detected and reported so the processes will be completed. There is no reason for an adverse inference to be drawn when a standard exit procedure is carried out after a person has ceased employment. A person who has left a worksite should expect their privileges to be removed and for records to be kept showing they have returned property and keys. It is worth remembering a person who is no longer working at a site is unable to detect the use of their old logon by another person. {{DEFAULTSORT:Exit Procedure}} [[Category:Computer security procedures]]</text> </page> <page> <id>12792</id> <title>Exmouth Community College</title> <text>{{Infobox UK school | name = Exmouth Community College | image = | size = 220px | latitude = 50.62715 | longitude = -3.40623 | dms = | motto = | motto_pl = | established = | approx = | type = Community School | religion = | president = | head_label = Principal | head = Mr A K Alexander | r_head_label = | r_head = | deputy_head_label = | deputy head = | r_deputy_head_label = | r_deputy_head = | chair_label = | chair = | founder = | founder_pl = | specialist = Maths and Computing | specialist_pl = | street = Gipsy Lane | city = Exmouth | county = Devon | country = {{flagcountry|England}} | postcode = EX8 3AF | LEA = Devon | ofsted = | dcsfno = | dcsfurn = 113504 | staff = | enrollment = 2327 | gender = [[Mixed-sex education|Coeducational]] | lower_age = 11 | upper_age = 18 | houses = | colours = | publication = | website = http://www.exmouthcollege.devon.sch.uk/ | website_name = }} '''Exmouth Community College''' is a [[comprehensive school]] in [[Exmouth, Devon]], [[England]].

Exophora can be [[deixis|deictic]], in which special words or grammatical markings are used to make reference to something in the context of the utterance or speaker. For example, [[pronoun]]s are often exophoric, with words such as "this", "that", "here", "there", as in ''that chair over there is John's'' said while indicating the direction of the chair referred to. Given "Did the gardener water those plants?", it is quite possible that "those" refers back to the preceding text, to some earlier mention of those particular plants in the discussion. But it is also possible that it refers to the environment in which the dialogue is taking place &mdash; to the "context of situation", as it is called &mdash; where the plants in question are present and can be pointed to if necessary. The interpretation would be "those plants there, in front of us". This kind of reference is called exophora, since it takes us outside the text altogether. Exophoric reference is not [[cohesion (linguistics)|cohesive]], since it does not bind the two elements together into a text. ==Homophora== A type of exophora, homophora relates to a generic phrase that obtains a specific meaning through knowledge of its context; a specific example of homophora can variably be a "homophor" or a "homophoric reference". For example, the meaning of the phrase ''"the Queen"'' may be determined by the country in which it is spoken. Because there are many Queens throughout the world, the location of the speaker provides the extra information that allows an individual Queen to be identified. The precise origin of the term is not fully clear, but it is probably intended to suggest a [[referring expression]] that always has
