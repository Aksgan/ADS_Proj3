He emigrated to the [[United Kingdom]] in 1956 and to [[Norway]] in 1958. He took his first job with [[IBM]] in 1958 and became a [[freelance]] consultant in 1960. He is currently a consultant, teacher and author, in partnership with his son Kai Gilb. He mainly helps multinational clients improve their organizations and methods by using "evolutionary systems delivery" (Evo). He has "guest lectured at universities all over UK, Europe, China, India, USA, Korea – and has been a keynote speaker at dozens of technical conferences internationally".<ref>[http://www.gilb.com www.gilb.com About Tom Gilb & Kai Gilb]</ref> He is a member of [[INCOSE]] and is active in the Norwegian chapter, NORSEC, which presented him with an award in 2003.

He had designed and implemented a computer-assisted instruction (CAI) system for programmed-curriculum courses. It was the first of its kind at the university, and is used routinely by the Psychology department for introductory courses. In 1984 he received a M.S. in Computer and Information Science at the [[University of Massachusetts]]. His Master's research had resulted in the design and implementation of an intelligent communication [[prosthesis]] assistant, a computer system which enables people with severe physical disabilities who cannot otherwise speak to communicate in [[natural language]] presented in displayed, written, or spoken form. Four years later in 1988 at the University of Massachusetts he received a Ph.D. in Computer and Information Science with the dissertation "The Acquisition of Strategic Knowledge". His dissertation research had addressed a critical problem for Artificial Intelligence—knowledge acquisition—with a computer assistant that acquires strategic knowledge from experts.<ref name = "TRG95">[http://www-ksl.stanford.edu/people/gruber/gruber-cv.html Thomas Robert Gruber].

He has been working on the How Things Work, SHADE, and Knowledge Sharing Technology projects. In 1994 he became Senior Project Leader, Enterprise Integration Technologies and proposed and designed several projects using the Internet to create shared, virtual environments for collaborative learning and work (for ARPA, NASA, NIST). Proposed a business plan for corporate training. In 1995 he founded and became Chief Technology Officer of [[Intraspect Software]],<ref name = "TRG95"/> an enterprise software company that pioneered the space of collaborative knowledge management.
