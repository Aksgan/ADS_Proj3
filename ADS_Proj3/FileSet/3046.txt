and OOFELIE<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.open-engineering.com |title=Oofelie |accessdate=2010-01-20 |publisher= Open Engineering}}</ref> are some examples of commercially available software packages for simulating multiphysics models. These software packages mainly rely on the [[Finite Element Method]] or similar commonplace numerical methods for simulating coupled physics: thermal stress, electromechanical interaction, fluid structure interaction (FSI), fluid flow with heat transport and chemical reactions, electromagnetic fluids (magnetohydrodynamics or plasma), electromagnetically induced heating. In many cases, to get accurate results, it is important to include mutual dependencies where the material properties significant for one field (such as the electric field) vary with the value of another field (such as temperature) and vice versa. ==Multiple Discretization Methods== There are cases where each subset of [[partial differential equation]]s has different mathematical behavior, for example when compressible fluid flow is coupled with structural analysis or [[heat transfer]]. To perform an optimal simulation in those cases, a different discretization procedure must be applied to each subset. For example, the [[compressible flow]] is discretized with a [[finite volume]] method and the conjugate heat transfer with a [[finite element analysis]]. ==References== {{reflist}} * [[Susan L.

MNG is closely related to the [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] image format. When PNG development started in early 1995, developers decided not to incorporate support for [[animation]], not least because this feature of [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] was seldom used at the time{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}. However, work soon started on MNG as an animation-supporting version of PNG. Version 1.0 of the MNG specification was released on January 31, 2001. ==File support== ===Application support=== {{See also|Comparison of layout engines (graphics)#Image format support}} MNG is currently not as widely supported as PNG. Nonetheless, [[Gwenview]] has native MNG support, and MNG plugins are available for most other web browsers. [[Mozilla]] browsers and [[Netscape (web browser)|Netscape]] 6.0, 6.01 and 7.0 included native support for MNG until the code was removed in 2003 due to code size and little actual usage<ref>[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=195280 Bug 195280 – Removal of MNG/JNG support]</ref>, causing complaints on the Mozilla development site<ref>[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18574 Bug 18574 – restore support for MNG animation format and JNG image format]</ref>. As a result, a MNGzilla project was started to offer patched Mozilla and Firefox browsers<ref>"This is an open source project to develop a patch to restore MNG/JNG support to Mozilla. - [http://mngzilla.sourceforge.net/ 'MNGZILLA'] MNGzilla [[Sourceforge]] website. Retrieved 6 December 2010.</ref>. By contrast, Firefox supports MNG rival [[APNG]] natively<ref>{{cite web| url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Animated_PNG_graphics |title=Animated PNG graphics - MDC Doc Center |date=4 July 2008 |accessdate=6 December 2010}}</ref>. Neither [[Internet Explorer]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], nor [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] currently support MNG natively. Recent [[Sony Ericsson]] phones support MNG files in their themes. The [[Sphere (program)|Sphere game engine]] supports the use of MNG files for animations<ref>[http://sphere.sourceforge.net/modules.php?op=modload&name=Sections&file=index&req=viewarticle&artid=3&page=4 From Tutorials and Reference section of site]</ref>. [[GIMP]] can export images as MNG files. [[Imagemagick]] can create a MNG file from a series of PNG files. If [[MPlayer]] is linked against libmng, MPlayer and thus all graphical front-ends like [[Konqueror Media Player|KMPlayer]] and [[Gnome MPlayer]] can display MNG files. {| class = "wikitable" !
