systems == {{Refimprove|section|date=April 2010}} "Unix-like" systems started to appear in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Many [[proprietary software|proprietary]] versions, such as [[Idris (operating system)|Idris]] (1978), [[Coherent (operating system)|Coherent]] (1983), [[UNOS (operating system)|UNOS]] (1983), and [[UniFlex]] (1985), aimed to provide businesses with the functionality available to academic users of UNIX. When AT&T later allowed commercial licensing of UNIX in the 1980s, a variety of proprietary systems were developed based on it, including [[AIX operating system|AIX]], [[HP-UX]], [[IRIX]], [[SunOS]], [[Tru64]], [[Ultrix]], and [[Xenix]]. These largely displaced the proprietary clones. Growing incompatibility between these systems led to the creation of interoperability standards, including [[POSIX]] and the [[Single UNIX Specification]]. Meanwhile, the [[GNU Project]] was launched in 1983 with the goal of making [[GNU]], an operating system which all computer users could freely use, study, modify, and redistribute. Various "Unix-like" operating systems developed alongside GNU, frequently sharing substantial components with it (leading to some disagreement about whether they should be called "GNU" or not). These primarily served as low-cost and unrestricted substitutes for UNIX, and include [[Berkeley Software Distribution|4.4BSD]], [[Linux]], and [[Minix]]. Some of these have in turn been the basis for commercial "Unix-like" systems, such as [[BSD/OS]] and [[Mac OS X]]. Notably, [[Mac OS X 10.5]] and [[Mac OS X 10.6]] running on Intel Macs are certified under the Single UNIX Specification.<ref>http://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/</ref> The various BSD variants are notable in that they are in fact descendants of UNIX, developed by the University of California at Berkeley with UNIX source code from Bell Labs. However, the BSD code base has evolved since then, replacing all of the AT&T code. Since the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] variants are not certified as compliant with the Single UNIX Specification (except for Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard and Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard), they are referred to as "UNIX-like". == See also == * [[Berkeley Software Distribution]] * [[Linux distribution]] * [[List of Linux distributions]] * [[List of Unix utilities]] * [[List of operating systems]] == References == {{reflist}} == External links == * [http://www.linfo.org/unix-like.html Unix-like Definition]—by The Linux Information Project (LINFO) * [http://www.levenez.com/unix/ UNIX history]—a history time line graph of most UNIX and Unix-like systems by Éric Lévénez * [http://grokline.net/ Grokline's UNIX Ownership History Project]—a project to map out the technical history of UNIX and Unix-like systems {{unix-like}} {{Operating System}} [[Category:Unix]] [[Category:Unix variants| ]] [[ar:شبيه يونكس]] [[bn:ইউনিক্স-সদৃশ]] [[ca:Unix-like]] [[cs:UN*X]] [[de:Unixoides System]] [[et:UNIXi-laadne operatsioonisüsteem]] [[eu:UNIX-moduko]] [[fa:شبه یونیکس]] [[fr:Type Unix]] [[gl:Unix-like]] [[ko:유닉스 계열]] [[io:Unix-atra]] [[id:Sistem operasi bertipe Unix]] [[is:Unix-legt]] [[it:Unix-like]] [[ka:იუნიქსისავით]] [[hu:Unix-szerű]] [[ms:Ala UNIX]] [[ja:Unix系]] [[no:Unix-liknende]] [[pl:System uniksopodobny]] [[pt:Sistema operacional tipo Unix]] [[ro:Unix-like]] [[ru:UNIX-подобная операционная система]] [[sah:Unix-курдук]] [[sk:UNIX-like operačný systém]] [[fi:Unixin kaltainen käyttöjärjestelmä]] [[sv:Unixliknande]] [[th:ระบบปฏิบัติการแบบยูนิกซ์]] [[zh:类Unix系统]]</text> </page> <page> <id>38958</id> <title>UnixWorld</title> <text>'''UnixWorld''' was a magazine about [[Unix]] systems published from May 1984 until December 1995.

Several attempts exist to standardize the Unix filesystem layout, such as the "[[Filesystem Hierarchy Standard]],"<ref name="Filesystem Hierarchy Standard">{{cite web |url=http://www.pathname.com/fhs/ |title=Filesystem Hierarchy Standard |accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref> however, targeted primarily at [[Linux]]. Also, as part of the "[[Linux Standards Base]]", a common filesystem layout is defined, to encourage interoperability among different Linux distributions.<ref name="Linux Standards Base">{{cite web |url=http://www.linux-foundation.org/en/LSB |title=Linux Standards Base |accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref> What follows is a generalized overview of common locations of files in a Unix operating system: * '''<tt>/</tt>''' — the slash <tt>/</tt> character alone denotes the root of the virtual filesystem tree. :* '''<tt>/bin</tt>''' — stands for "[[computer program|binaries]]" and contains certain fundamental utilities, such as <tt>ls</tt> or <tt>cp</tt>, needed by all users. :* '''<tt>/sbin</tt>''' — stands for "[[computer program|system (or "superuser") binaries]]" and contains fundamental utilities, such as <tt>init</tt>, usually needed to start, maintain and recover the system. :* '''<tt>/etc</tt>''' — contains configuration files and system databases. :* '''<tt>/dev</tt>''' — stands for "devices". Contains file representations of peripheral devices. ::*'''<tt>[[dev-null|/dev/null]]</tt>''' — also known as the "bit bucket" or "black hole", this [[pseudo device]] discards all contents written to it, and is typically used to pipe away unwanted data. ::* '''<tt>[[/dev/random]]</tt>''' — this pseudo device returns [[pseudorandom numbers]] (subject to the limitations of [[random number generator]]s in [[computing]]) when read from. It uses system noise to generate random numbers and blocks if not enough entropy in the noise is available. Random is commonly used by programs such as [[SSH]] that absolutely need cryptographically-strong random data to generate an [[encryption]] key. ::* '''<tt>/dev/urandom</tt>''' — similar to <tt>/dev/random</tt>, except it always returns (less cryptographically-strong) pseudorandom numbers, even if there is not enough entropy in the system noise available. :* '''<tt>/home</tt>''' — contains the home directories for the users. :* '''<tt>/mnt</tt>''' — contains filesystem mount points. :* '''<tt>/lib</tt>''' — contains system libraries. :* '''<tt>/root</tt>''' — the home directory for the [[superuser]] root. :* '''<tt>/tmp</tt>''' — a place for temporary files. Many Unices clear this directory upon start up. :* '''<tt>/usr</tt>''' — originally the directory holding user home directories, its use has changed, and it now holds executables, libraries, and shared resources that are not system critical, like the [[X Window System]], [[KDE]], [[Perl]], etc. (The name "Unix System Resources" is a ''post hoc'' [[backronym]]{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}.) However, on some [[Unix]] systems, some user accounts may still have a home directory that is a direct subdirectory of /usr, such as the default ast in [[Minix]]. ::* '''<tt>/usr/bin</tt>''' — this directory stores all binary programs distributed with the operating system not residing in <tt>/bin</tt>, <tt>/sbin</tt> or (rarely) <tt>/etc</tt>. ::* '''<tt>/usr/include</tt>''' — <tt>/usr/include</tt> stores the development headers used throughout the system. ::* '''<tt>/usr/lib</tt>''' — the required libraries for executables within <tt>/usr</tt> or elsewhere for that matter, live here. ::* '''<tt>/usr/local</tt>''' — resembles <tt>/usr</tt>, except that its subdirectories are used for additions not part of the operating system distribution, such as custom programs or files from a [[BSD]] [[Ports collection]]. Usually has subdirectories such as <tt>/usr/local/lib</tt> or <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt>. :* '''<tt>/var</tt>''' — a short for "variable." A
