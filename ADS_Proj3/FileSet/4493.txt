ways to build a touchscreen. The key goals are to recognize one or more fingers touching a display, to interpret the command that this represents, and to communicate the command to the appropriate application. In the most popular techniques, the capacitive or resistive approach, there are typically four layers; # Top polyester layer coated with a transparent metallic conductive coating on the bottom # Adhesive spacer # Glass layer coated with a transparent metallic conductive coating on the top # Adhesive layer on the backside of the glass for mounting. When a user touches the surface, the system records the change in the electrical current that flows through the display. Dispersive-signal technology which [[3M]] created in 2002, measures the [[piezoelectric effect]] — the voltage generated when mechanical force is applied to a material — that occurs chemically when a strengthened glass substrate is touched. There are two infrared-based approaches. In one, an array of sensors detects a finger touching or almost touching the display, thereby interrupting light beams projected over the screen. In the other, bottom-mounted [[Thermographic camera|infrared cameras]] record screen touches. In each case, the system determines the intended command based on the controls showing on the screen at the time and the location of the touch. ==Development== Most touchscreen technology [[patents]] were filed during the 1970s and 1980s and have expired. Touchscreen component manufacturing and product design are no longer encumbered by [[royalties]] or legalities with regard to patents and the use of touchscreen-enabled displays is widespread. The development of multipoint touchscreens facilitated the tracking of more than one finger on the screen; thus, operations that require more than one finger are possible. These devices also allow multiple users to interact with the touchscreen simultaneously. With the growing use of touchscreens, the [[marginal cost]] of touchscreen technology is routinely absorbed into the products that incorporate it and is nearly eliminated. Touchscreens now have proven reliability. Thus, touchscreen displays are found today in airplanes, automobiles, gaming consoles, machine control systems, appliances, and handheld display devices including the multi-touch enabled [[iPhone]]; the touchscreen market for mobile devices is projected to produce US$5 billion in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abiresearch.com/press/1231-Touch+Screens+in+Mobile+Devices+to+Deliver+$5+Billion+Next+Year |title=Touch Screens in Mobile Devices to Deliver $5 Billion Next Year &#124; Press Release |publisher=ABI Research |date=2008-09-10 |accessdate=2009-06-22}}</ref> The ability to accurately point on the screen itself is also advancing with the emerging [[graphics tablet/screen hybrid]]s. ==Ergonomics and usage== === Finger stress === An ergonomic problem of touchscreens is their stress on human fingers when used for more than a few minutes at a time, since significant pressure can be required for certain types of touchscreen. This can be alleviated for some users with the use of a pen or other device to add leverage and more accurate pointing. The introduction of such items can sometimes be problematic, depending on the desired use (e.g., public kiosks such as A.T.M.s). Also, fine motor control is better achieved with a stylus, because a finger is a rather broad and ambiguous point of contact with the screen itself. === Fingernail as stylus === [[File:Pointed nail.png|thumb|Pointed nail for easier typing. The concept of using a fingernail trimmed to form a point, to be specifically used as a [[Stylus (computing)|stylus]] on a [[Notebook|writing tablet]] for communication, appeared in the 1950 science fiction short story [[Scanners Live in Vain]].]] These ergonomic issues of direct touch can be bypassed by using a different technique, provided that the user's fingernails are either short or sufficiently long. {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Rather than pressing with the soft skin of an outstretched fingertip, the finger is curled over, so that the tip of a fingernail can be used instead. The thumb is optionally used to provide support for the finger or for a long fingernail, from underneath. This method does not work on capacitive touch screens. The fingernail's hard, curved surface contacts the touchscreen at one very small point. Therefore, much less finger pressure is needed, much greater precision is possible (approaching that of a stylus, with a little experience), much less skin oil is smeared onto the screen, and the fingernail can be silently moved across the screen with very little resistance {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}, allowing for selecting text, moving windows, or drawing lines. The human [[fingernail]] consists of [[keratin]] which has a hardness and smoothness similar to the tip of a [[Stylus (computing)|stylus]] (and so will not typically scratch a touchscreen). Alternately, very short stylus tips are available, which slip right onto the end of a finger; this increases visibility of the contact point with the screen. === Fingerprints === Touchscreens can suffer from the problem of fingerprints on the display. This can be mitigated by the use of materials with [[optical coating]]s designed to reduce the visible effects of fingerprint oils, such as the [[oleophobic]] coating used in the [[iPhone 3G S]], or by reducing skin contact by using a fingernail or stylus. === Combined with haptics === The user experience with touchscreens without tactile feedback or [[Haptic technology|haptics]] can be difficult due to latency or other factors. Research from the University of Glasgow Scotland [Brewster, Chohan, and Brown 2007] demonstrates that sample users reduce input errors (20%), increase input speed (20%), and lower their cognitive load (40%) when touchscreens are combined with haptics or tactile feedback, [vs. non-haptic touchscreens]. === Gorilla arm === The [[Jargon File]] dictionary of hacker slang defined Gorilla Arm as the failure to understand the ergonomics of vertically mounted touch screens for prolonged use. The proposition is that human arm held in an unsupported horizontal position rapidly becomes fatigued and painful, the so-called "gorilla arm".<ref>http://catb.org/jargon/html/G/gorilla-arm.html</ref> It is often cited as a prima facie example of what not to do in ergonomics. Vertical touchscreens still dominate in applications such as ATMs and data kiosks in which the usage is too brief to be an ergonomic problem.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Discomfort might be caused by previous poor posture and atrophied muscular systems caused by limited physical exercise.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9156441 Poor posture subjects a worker's body to muscle imbalance, nerve compression, Langford ML,
