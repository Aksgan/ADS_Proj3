It organises conferences and sponsors publications in the area. It is a constituent society of the [[Joint Mathematical Council]] of the UK. ==External links== * [http://www.bsrlm.org.uk/ Society website] [[Category:Mathematical societies]] [[Category:Learned societies of the United Kingdom]] [[Category:British professional bodies]] {{UK-org-stub}} {{math-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>4577</id> <title>British undergraduate degree classification</title> <text>The '''British Undergraduate/Postgraduate degree classification''' system is a [[grade (education)|grading]] scheme for [[undergraduate degree]]s ([[bachelor's degree]]s and [[master's degree]]s) in the [[United Kingdom]]. The system has been applied (sometimes with significant variations) in other countries, such as [[Australia]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Barbados]], [[Canada]], [[Hong Kong]], [[India]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Jamaica]], [[Kenya]], [[Malaysia]], [[Malta]], [[Mauritius]], [[New Zealand]], [[Nigeria]], [[Pakistan]], [[Singapore]], [[South Africa]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. The [[Latin honors|Latin honours]] system used in the [[United States]] is different but has some similarities. ==Degree classification== A degree may be awarded with or without honours, with the class of an honours degree based on the average mark of the assessed work a candidate has completed. Below is a list of the possible classifications with common abbreviations. * '''First-class Honours''' (1st) * '''Second-class Honours, upper division''' (2:1) * '''Second-class Honours, lower division''' (2:2) * '''Third-class Honours''' (3rd) * '''Ordinary-Degree''' (Pass) At most institutions the system does allow for a small amount of discretion and candidates may be elevated to the next degree class if their average mark is close or the [[median]] of their weighted marks achieves the higher class and they have submitted many pieces of work worthy of the higher class. However, they may be demoted a class if they fail to pass all parts of the course even if they have a high average. There are also variations between universities (especially in [[Scotland]], where honours are usually reserved only for courses lasting four years or more, with a three-year course leading to the awarding of an Ordinary degree; ''see [[Master of Arts (Scotland)]]'') and requirements other than the correct average are often needed to be awarded honours. (In Scotland it is possible to start University a year younger than in the rest of the United Kingdom as the Scottish Highers exams are often taken at age seventeen, not eighteen, so four-year courses end at the same chronological age as a rest-of-UK three-year course, assuming no [[gap year]]s.) When a candidate is awarded a degree with Honours, "(Hons)" may be suffixed to their type of degree, such as BA (Hons), a BSc (Hons) or an MA (Hons). An MA (Hons) would generally indicate a degree award from certain Scottish universities. At [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], honours classes apply to examinations, not to degrees. Thus, in Cambridge, where undergraduates are examined at the end of each Part (one- or two-year section) of the [[Tripos]], a student may receive different classifications for different Parts. The degree itself does not formally have a class. Most Cambridge graduates use the class of the final Part as the class of the degree, but this is an informal usage. At Oxford, the Final Honour School results are generally applied to the degree. In some universities, candidates who successfully complete one or more years of degree-level study, but do not complete the full degree course, may be awarded a lower qualification: a [[Certificate of Higher Education]] or [[Higher National Certificate]] for one year of study, or a [[Diploma of Higher Education]] or [[Higher National Diploma]] for two years. The Graduateship (post-nominal GCGI) and Associateship (post-nominal ACGI) awarded by the [[City & Guilds of London Institute]] are mapped to a British Honours degree. The Engineering Council Graduate Diploma is set at the same level as the final year of a British BEng. {{Anchor|First Class Honours}} ===First-class honours=== First-class honours degrees (often simply "firsts") are the highest level of degree awarded and are taken to indicate high academic achievement and ability. In most universities, first-class honours are the highest honours that can be achieved, with percentages of graduates achieving a first varying greatly from attended university and course studied. For instance a first class honours degree in Law or Physics can be relatively rare. <ref>[http://www.hesa.ac.uk/index.php/content/view/1100/161/ SFR 117: Higher education student enrollments and qualifications obtained at higher education institutions in the United Kingdom for the academic year 2006/07], ''[[Higher Education Statistics Agency]]'', 10 January 2008</ref> A minority of universities award first-class honours with particular distinction, informally known as a "Starred First" ([[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], [[University of York|York]], [[University of East Anglia|UEA]]) or a "Congratulatory First" ([[University of Oxford|Oxford]]). Several of these tend to be awarded each year in certain subjects, depending on the number of candidates deemed worthy of the award; among notable recipients are the writer [[Karen Armstrong]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/passedfailed-an-education-in-the-life-of-karen-armstrong-writer-and-former-nun-406759.html |title=Passed/Failed: An education in the life of Karen Armstrong, writer and former nun - Profiles, People |publisher=The Independent |date=2006-07-06 |accessdate=2010-06-14 | location=London | first=Jonathan | last=Sale}}</ref> the philosopher [[Bernard Williams]], the historians [[Simon Schama]] and [[Quentin Skinner]] and the classicist Bob Cowan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alumni.balliol.ox.ac.uk/news/fd2007/passion_classics.asp |title=Balliol College - Old Members - Floreat Domus, Issue 13, August 2007 |publisher=Alumni.balliol.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-06-14}}</ref> ===Upper second-class Honours=== The upper division is commonly abbreviated to 2:1 (pronounced ''two-one''). This classification along with first class honours is highly sought after by many firms and academic institutions. Top tier [[bulge bracket]] firms such as Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley seek out graduates with at least 2:1 degrees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goglobal.jpmorgan.com/student/jpmorgan/careers/europe/preintern/springbreak/ |title=JP Morgan Careers |publisher=JP Morgan |date= |accessdate=2010-10-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.morganstanley.co.uk/about/careers/careers/programs/print/626.html |title=Morgan Stanley Careers |publisher=Morgan Stanley |date= |accessdate=2010-10-18}}</ref>. Similarly, the leading global law firms headquartered both in the USA and UK seek Upper Second Class Honours graduates (and above), such as Slaughter & May, Skadden Arps, Dewey leBoeuf, Linklaters, Allen & Overy and Clifford Chance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aograduate.com/en/Work-For-Us/What-We-Look-For/ |title=Allen & Overy Careers |publisher=Allen & Overy |date= |accessdate=2010-10-17}}</ref> The percentage of graduates who achieve an upper second class honours can vary widely by degree obtained as well as university attended.<ref name="hesa">[http://www.hesa.ac.uk/dox/dataTables/studentsAndQualifiers/download/quals0506.xls HE qualifications obtained
