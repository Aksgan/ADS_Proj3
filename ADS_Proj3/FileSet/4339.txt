Some authors have tried to use other names for the Link Layer, such as ''network interface layer'', in view to avoid confusion with the [[Data Link Layer]] of the seven layer [[OSI model]]. Others have attempted to map the Internet Protocol model onto the OSI Model. The mapping often results in a model with five layers where the Link Layer is split into a Data Link Layer on top of a Physical Layer. In literature with a bottom-up approach to Internet communication,<ref name=Forouzan/><ref name=Comer/><ref name=Stallings/> in which hardware issues are emphasized, those are often discussed in terms of physical layer and data link layer. The Internet Layer is usually directly mapped into the OSI Model's [[Network Layer]], a more general concept of network functionality. The Transport Layer of the TCP/IP model, sometimes also described as the host-to-host layer, is mapped to OSI Layer 4 (Transport Layer), sometimes also including aspects of OSI Layer 5 ([[Session Layer]]) functionality. OSI's [[Application Layer]], [[Presentation Layer]], and the remaining functionality of the Session Layer are collapsed into TCP/IP's Application Layer. The argument is that these OSI layers do usually not exist as separate processes and protocols in Internet applications.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} However, the Internet protocol stack has never been altered by the Internet Engineering Task Force from the four layers defined in RFC 1122. The IETF makes no effort to follow the OSI model although RFCs sometimes refer to it and often use the old OSI layer numbers. The IETF has repeatedly stated{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} that Internet protocol and architecture development is not intended to be OSI-compliant. RFC 3439, addressing Internet architecture, contains a section entitled: "Layering Considered Harmful".<ref name=R3439>{{citation | url = http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc3439.txt | title = Some Internet Architectural Guidelines and Philosophy | author = R.

'''TERA''' is a shielded [[twisted pair]] connector for use with [[Category 7 cable|Category 7]] twisted-pair data cables, developed by [[The Siemon Company]] and standardized in 2003 by [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 61076-3-104. The latest revision of the standard (published in 2006) has extended the characterized performance up to 1000 MHz.[[Image:Tera steckverbinder.JPG|thumb|TERA-Connector]] The connector has a different footprint from the more common [[8P8C]] connector style, often colloquially referred to as "[[RJ-45]]". TERA is also the standard interface for broadcast communications technology (BCT) in SOHO (Small Office Home Office). This connector allows for cable sharing, permitting users to integrate video, voice and data services over a single cabling link. ==See also== * [[GG45]] * [[ARJ45]] ==References== *International standard IEC 61076-3-104 Ed.2: Connectors for electronic equipment — Part 3-104: Rectangular connectors — Detail specification for 8-way, shielded free and fixed connectors for data transmissions with frequencies up to 1000 MHz.
