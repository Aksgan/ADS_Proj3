It is often considered a hybrid between [[Electrical Engineering]] and [[Computer Science]] due to the utilization of both [[Computer hardware|hardware]] and [[Computer software|software]] technologies in the field.

Although this may be thought of as a single [[Task (project management)|activity]], in fact construction is a feat of [[Human multitasking|multitasking]]. Normally the job is managed by the construction [[Management|manager]], supervised by the [[project manager]], [[design engineer]] or [[project architect]]. While these people work in offices, every construction project requires a large number of [[laborers]], carpenters, and other skilled tradesmen to complete the physical task of construction. The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to construction: == Essence of construction == {{Main|Construction}} * [[Building]] * [[House]] * [[Infrastructure]] == Types of construction == * [[Building]] construction ** [[Home]] construction ** [[High-rise]] construction ** [[Industr]]ial construction *** [[factory|Factories]] *** [[Refinery|Refineries]]
