On April 22, 2008, distributor StreamCast Networks filed for Chapter 7 [[bankruptcy]] after a long legal battle with music companies; all of their employees were laid off and the official download at www.morpheus.com stopped being available, though for a small period the website remained online. As of October 29, 2008 the official Morpheus website is offline, including all other websites owned by StreamCast Networks including Morpheus.com, MusicCity.com, Streamcastnetworks.com and NeoNetwork.com ==Download restriction== Currently, Morpheus redirects a user attempting to download unauthorized copyrighted music and movie files to a site with purchase links for music.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} == Availability == Users of the Morpheus community have set up a website where you are still able to download the Morpheus software. At that site, there is a support forum and support chatroom setup from the [http://www.gnutellaforums.com/morpheus-windows/91786-clean-updated-morpheus-installers-available-here.html site] and within the client. ==Presence of adware/spyware== The current version of Morpheus, version 5.5.1, contains no adware or spyware, and no additional software is bundled with Morpheus. However, when Morpheus is open and running, the interface contains online ads that support the application. During installation, an <nowiki>optional</nowiki> peer-to-peer Morpheus Toolbar is offered. Both the Morpheus application and the Morpheus Toolbar are easily uninstalled with Windows Add/Remove Programs commands, however this is not the case with previous versions. Version 5.3 didn't install [[adware]] or [[spyware]], though it did install some Desktop shortcuts to adware websites and the Morpheus Toolbar without user approval. ==In popular culture== *[["Weird Al" Yankovic|Weird Al]] mentions Morpheus in [[Don't Download This Song]]. ==See also== * [[Comparison of file sharing applications]] * [[Open Music Model]] ==External links== * [http://www.morpheus.com Morpheus 5.2.3] * [http://www.gnutellaforums.com/morpheus-windows Morpheus Forum] * [http://www.eff.org/IP/P2P/MGM_v_Grokster/ MGM v.

Morse]], is a convenient model for the [[potential energy]] of a [[diatomic molecule]]. It is a better approximation for the [[oscillation|vibrational]] structure of the molecule than the [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] because it explicitly includes the effects of bond breaking, such as the existence of unbound states. It also accounts for the [[anharmonicity]] of real bonds and the non-zero transition probability for [[overtone band|overtone]] and [[combination band]]s. The Morse potential can also be used to model other interactions such as the interaction between an atom and a surface. ==Potential Energy Function== [[Image:Morse-potential.png|400px|thumb|The '''Morse potential''' (blue) and harmonic oscillator potential (green). Unlike the energy levels of the harmonic oscillator potential, which are evenly spaced by ħω, the Morse potential level spacing decreases as the energy approaches the dissociation energy. The dissociation energy ''D''<sub>e</sub> is larger than the true energy required for dissociation ''D''<sub>0</sub> due to the zero point energy of the lowest (''v'' = 0) vibrational level.]] The Morse potential energy function is of the form :<math>V(r) = D_e ( 1-e^{-a(r-r_e)} )^2</math> Here <math>r</math> is the distance between the atoms, <math>r_e</math> is the equilibrium bond distance, <math>D_e</math> is the well depth (defined relative to the dissociated atoms), and <math>a</math> controls the 'width' of the potential (the smaller <math>a</math> the larger the well). The [[Bond dissociation energy|dissociation energy]] of the bond can be calculated by subtracting the [[zero point energy]] <math>E(0)</math> from the depth of the well. The [[force constant]] of the bond can be found by Taylor expansion of <math>V(r)</math> around <math>r=r_e</math> to the second [[derivative]] of the potential energy function, from which it can be shown that the parameter, <math>a</math>, is :<math>a=\sqrt{k_e/2D_e}</math>, where <math>k_e</math> is the force constant at the minimum of the well. Of course, the [[Potential_energy#Relation_between_potential_energy_and_force| zero of potential energy is arbitrary]], and the equation for the Morse potential can be rewritten any number of ways by adding or subtracting a constant value. When it is used to model the atom-surface interaction, the Morse potential is usually written in the form :<math>V(r) - D_e = D_e ( e^{-2a(r-r_e)}-2e^{-a(r-r_e)} )</math> where <math>r</math> is now the coordinate perpendicular to the surface. This form approaches zero at infinite <math>r</math> and equals <math>-D_e</math> at its minimum. It clearly shows that the Morse potential is the combination of a short-range repulsion and a longer-range attractive tail. ==Vibrational States and Energies== To write the [[stationary state]]s on the Morse potential, i.e. solutions <math>\Psi(v)</math> and <math>E(v)</math> of the following [[Schrödinger equation]]: :<math>\left(-\frac{\hbar ^2 }{2 m }\frac{\partial ^2}{\partial r^2}+V(r)\right)\Psi(v)=E(v)\Psi(v),</math> it is convenient to introduce the new variables: :<math>x=a r \text{; } x_e=a r_e \text{; } \lambda =\frac{\sqrt{2 m D_e}}{a \hbar } \text{; } \varepsilon _v=\frac{2 m }{a^2\hbar ^2}E(v). </math> Then, the [[Schrödinger equation]] takes the simple form: :<math> \left(-\frac{\partial ^2}{\partial x^2}+V(x)\right)\Psi _n(x)=\varepsilon _n\Psi _n(x), </math> :<math> V(x)=\lambda ^2\left(e^{-2\left(x-x_e\right)}-2e^{-\left(x-x_e\right)}\right). </math> Its [[eigenvalue]]s and [[eigenstate]]s can be written as: :<math> \varepsilon _n=-\left(\lambda -n-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 </math> :<math> \Psi _n(z)=N_nz^{\lambda -n-\frac{1}{2}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}Z}L_n^{2\lambda -2n-1}(z), </math> where <math> z=2\lambda e^{-\left(x-x_e\right)}</math>; <math>N_n=n![\frac{a\left(2\lambda-2n-1\right)}{\Gamma (n+1)\Gamma (2\lambda -n)}]^{\frac{1}{2}}</math> and <math>L_n^{\alpha }(z)</math> is [[Laguerre polynomial]]: :<math>L_n^{\alpha }(z) = \frac{z^{-\alpha }e^z}{n!} \frac{d^n}{d z^n}\left(z^{n + \alpha } e^{-z}\right)=\frac{\Gamma (\alpha + 2)/\Gamma (\alpha -n+2)}{\Gamma (n+1)} \, _1F_1(-n,\alpha +1,z), </math> There also exists the following important analytical expression for [[matrix
