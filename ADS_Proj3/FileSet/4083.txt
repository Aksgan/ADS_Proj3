the first manufacturer to bring Smart Display to the market, with the ''airpanel V150'' in early 2003. This included a 15" 1024&times;768 LCD, a 400 MHz [[Intel XScale]] processor, 32MB ROM, 64MB RAM and 802.11b wireless, and a USB wireless hub for the host PC. ==Problems== Analysts flagged the problems with the Mira initiative very early on, as soon as it reached their notice in early 2002. * In Smart Display OS 1.0, the display would lock the host PC to it while in use. Microsoft variously attributed this to licensing issues (that Windows XP Professional was licensed for one user per running copy <ref>[http://comment.zdnet.co.uk/mattloney/0,39020679,2126784,00.htm Mira, Mira in the bin] (Matt Loney, ZDNet UK, 29 November 2002)</ref>) and resource management problems.<ref name="zdnet3"/> The requirements of licensing &mdash; not to allow the devices to work standalone, not to allow the device to connect to the host PC while the PC's main screen was active and not to allow multiple Smart Displays to control one PC &mdash; were widely derided in the press. * Only one Smart Display could connect to a host PC at a time, preventing multiple devices being used in households with access to only one PC.<ref name="zdnet1">[http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/desktop-hardware/2002/03/13/cebit-2002-mira-gets-rugged-and-magnetic-2106528/ Mira gets rugged and magnetic] - [[ZDNet]], 13 March 2002</ref> * Although the devices had similar CPU and memory specifications and operating system to a large [[Pocket PC]], weighed as much as a notebook and had similar battery life, they provided no standalone functionality and were not usable without a host PC.

Harnessing the remote desktop and wireless networking features of Windows XP and Windows CE .NET, 'Mira'-enabled smart displays will deliver to consumers the freedom of the complete experiences in Windows, including browsing the Web, sending or receiving e-mail messages, listening to music, and editing and displaying digital images, from any room in the home. The initial announcement mentioned technology partnerships with [[AboCom]], [[Fujitsu]], [[Intel]], [[LG Electronics]], [[National Semiconductor]], [[NEC]], [[Philips Consumer Electronics]], [[Tatung Company|Tatung]], [[TriGem]], [[ViewSonic]], [[Wistron]] and [[Wyse]]. Smart Display OS 1.0 was supported by several monitor manufacturers, including [[Samsung]], LG, TriGem, Philips, ViewSonic, Fujitsu and NEC. Products included the Fujitsu FMSDP-101, the NEC PK-SD10, the Philips DesXcape, the Trigem Play@PAD and the ViewSonic airpanel.<ref>[http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/desktop-hardware/2002/03/13/mira-device-gains-new-supporters-2106457/ Mira device gains new supporters] - [[ZDNet]], 13 March 2002</ref> Smart Display OS 1.5, scheduled for the end of 2003, was intended to allow a PC to connect simultaneously to a monitor and a smart display. Microsoft later changed its timetable to include a release of Smart Display OS 2.0 in late 2004 with additional functions such as mobile [[image processing]]. ==Cancellation== After having signed up several LCD manufacturers to work on the initiative, some of whom (such as LG) had Smart Display 1.5 products ready for early 2004 release, Microsoft finally announced the cancellation of the initiative on Monday 22 December 2003. LG stated it would persist with Smart Displays even without Microsoft's assistance, although no products eventuated.<ref>[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/01/08/lg_will_persist_with_smart/ LG `will persist' with Smart Display, even after Microsoft drops it] (Guy Kewney, ''newswireless.net'', Thursday 08 January 2004)</ref> It has been suggested that the [[Ultra-Mobile PC]] (UMPC), [[List of Microsoft codenames|code-named]] Origami, is the evolution of the Smart Display.<ref>[http://digital-lifestyles.info/display_page.asp?section=cm&id=3080] Smart Display evolves</ref> ==Sources== ===Footnotes=== <references /> ===Further reading=== *[http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2002/Jun02/06-26MiraNamingPR.mspx Microsoft Unveils Windows CE for Smart Displays Naming] (Microsoft press release, 26 June 2002) *[http://news.zdnet.co.uk/hardware/0,39020351,2126702,00.htm Microsoft Mira hung up on licensing] (Matthew Broersma, ZDNet UK, 28 November 2002) *[http://www.windowsfordevices.com/news/NS4174247688.html Meet 'Mira', a .NET-based smart display device technology] (WindowsForDevices, 26 June 2002) *[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402EFDA103FF931A35752C0A9659C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all STATE OF THE ART: And Now, the Portable Desktop PC, Up to a Point] (David Pogue, ''[[New York Times]]'', Thursday 2 January 2003) *[http://reviews.zdnet.co.uk/hardware/monitors/0,39023935,10003760,00.htm ViewSonic airpanel V150] ([[Rupert Goodwins]], ZDNet UK, 15 April 2003) *[http://english.etnews.co.kr/news/detail.html?id=200312230003 Microsoft Abandons Smart Display Project, Stranding Domestic Monitor Makers] (Yoo Hyung-jun, ''ETNEWS'' [Korea], Tue 23 December 2003) *[http://www.computergripes.com/smart.displays.html Smart Display Gripes] (Computer Gripes, 6 January 2004) *[http://news.zdnet.co.uk/0,39020330,39118897,00.htm Microsoft dumps Smart Display] (Matt Loney, ZDNet UK, 6 January 2004) *[http://comment.zdnet.co.uk/mattloney/0,39020679,39118902,00.htm Smart Displays - good riddance to dumb technology] (Matt Loney, ZDNet UK, Tuesday 6 January 2004) *[http://www.windowsfordevices.com/news/NS5041078478.html NEWS FLASH: R.I.P.

A "Smart Client" application can be created in several very different technologies.
