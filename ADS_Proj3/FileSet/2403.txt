to version: * 10.0 - 10.1.5: The system prints out numbers and words detailing the error on-screen and then the system becomes unresponsive. * 10.2 - 10.2.8: Similar to the current versions of the kernel panic except the text is more spaced out and the background is pink. * 10.3 - 10.5.8: The background is now black, but with the same language translations and the same text as version 10.2. * 10.6 - 10.6.6: The text is different and now features a Spanish language translation. In all versions above 10.2 the text is in front of a [[Power symbol|standby symbol]] and is not full screen. Debugging information is saved in [[Non-volatile random access memory|NVRAM]] and written to a log file on reboot. ==See also== * [[Fatal system error]] * [[Screen of death]] * [[Linux kernel oops]] ==References== {{reflist}} {{Screens of death}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Kernel Panic}} [[Category:Screens of death]] [[Category:Computer errors]] [[Category:Operating system kernels]] {{Link GA|ru}} [[bg:Kernel panic]] [[de:Kernel panic]] [[es:Kernel panic]] [[fr:Panique du noyau]] [[it:Kernel panic]] [[hu:Kernelpánik]] [[pl:Kernel panic]] [[pt:Kernel panic]] [[ru:Kernel panic]] [[fi:Kernel panic]] [[sv:Kernel panic]] [[uk:Kernel Panic (операційні системи)]] [[zh:内核错误]]</text> </page> <page> <id>20560</id> <title>Kernel relocation</title> <text>{{multiple issues | orphan=March 2010 | notability=March 2010 }} '''Kernel relocation''' may refer to the [[Linux]] feature in which a [[Linux kernel|kernel]] can be compiled to be bootable at a variety of different [[memory address]]es, instead of a fixed address, used in connection with [[kexec]] for crash recovery.<ref>http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_20#head-3c215483506a27123005168c491eea0f2e5549dd</ref> ==References== {{reflist}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Kernel Relocation}} [[Category:Linux kernel]] {{linux-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>20575</id> <title>Kevin Long (artist)</title> <text>{{BLP sources|date=March 2010}} :''For other people called Kevin Long: see [[Kevin Long]]'' '''Kevin Long''' is a graphic artist best known for his [[airbrush]] paintings and black-and-white illustrations in the genres of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]]. He was the premiere artist at [[Palladium Books]] from 1987 until 1995 and served as one of the original contributors to the [[Rifts (role-playing game)|Rifts]] [[role-playing game]] (RPG) series. Much of his work during this period helped establish the style and tone of ''Rifts'' and had a tremendous influence on the quality of art in RPG publications. ==Biography== Kevin Long grew up in [[Battle Creek, Michigan|Battle Creek]], [[Michigan]] and attended the [[College for Creative Studies]] in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], where he majored in advertising illustration. Upon graduating, Kevin worked in the local advertising industry. Having completed a five-year stint in his chosen profession, he was lured away by the artistic and creative freedom offered by Palladium Books. While there, Kevin built his reputation as one of the most popular illustrators in the role-playing industry. In addition to having created the dynamic look of various characters, vehicles, and equipment in ''Rifts'', he co-authored a number of other Palladium RPG titles. However, Kevin was dismissed from Palladium in August 1995 for unspecified reasons.<ref>[http://sirtenzan.tripod.com/RIFTS/official.html Official RIFTS Errata]</ref> In October 1997, [[Raven Software]] hired Kevin as a 2-D artist. He was responsible for some of the graphics in [[Hexen II: Portal of Praevus]], [[Heretic II]], [[Soldier of Fortune (video game)|Soldier of Fortune]], [[Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force]], [[Soldier of Fortune II: Double Helix]] and [[Quake 4]].<ref>[http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/quake-iv/611006p1.html GameSpy: The Art and Design of Quake4]</ref> In 2007, Kevin was the Art Lead on [[Wolfenstein (video game)|Wolfenstein]].<ref>[http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,9823/ MobyGames - Kevin Long]</ref> ==Role-playing game credits== Works are listed in order of publication date within their respective categories. ===Palladium Books=== Nearly all of Long's illustrations appearing in titles released after his departure from Palladium are taken from earlier publications.<ref group="nb">In the premiere issue of ''The Rifter'' (Smith ed. 1998, p. 4), which featured one of Long's most iconic images - a ley line walker from the ''[[Rifts]]'' RPG (Siembieda 1990, p. 133) - on its front cover, [[Kevin Siembieda]] claimed "there is a pile of Long art done for [[Palladium Books|Palladium]] that has yet to see publication." Since then, only 11 previously unreleased illustrations have appeared in print, the last instance of which occurred in 2001.</ref> The liberal (and occasionally indiscriminate) recycling of artwork, both within and among their various game series, is a peculiar though fairly standard characteristic of Palladium books.<ref group="nb">To demonstrate, consider what may be Long's most seminal contribution to the Palladium legacy: his work on the ''Rifts'' RPG core rulebook (Siembieda 1990). There are 102 individual illustrations to his credit in this particular title (not counted are a pair on which Long and Siembieda collaborated). Of these, six were previously featured in other books. Accounting for all repeat occurrences (13 images appear more than once), what remains are the title and logo, seven colour plates, one colour line illustration, and 66 black-and-white line illustrations - 75 in total. To date, 48 of these images have been reused in 22 titles over five separate game series - primarily ''Rifts Ultimate Edition'' (Siembieda et al. 2005) - and in nine issues of ''The Rifter''; one of them has reappeared ten times in seven other titles.</ref> Resultingly, it is not uncommon to encounter illustrations that either recur multiple times over the span of a single volume<ref group="nb">In ''Rifts World Book Five: Triax and the NGR'' (Siembieda & Long 1994), for instance, certain elements of "First-Timer", a short [[comic|illustrated narrative]] by Long (p. 25–32), are reproduced elsewhere on pages 10, 15, 17, 24, 80, 124, 164, 165, 172, 206, 214, and 219 of the same book.</ref> or lack some degree of relevance to the subject at hand due to being applied outside of their original contexts.<ref group="nb">One especially egregious attempt to repurpose an illustration can be seen on page 70 of ''Mystic China'' (Wujcik & Siembieda 1995). The original, from ''Rifts Conversion Book'' (Siembieda 1991, p. 90), depicts a male [[Elf (fantasy)|elf]] in the process of weaving an [[Incantation|enchantment]]; it accompanies a description of the elven race from the ''[[Palladium Fantasy Role-playing Game|Palladium Fantasy RPG]]'' setting. In ''Mystic China'', however, the image is featured in a section about [[qi]] and [[feng shui]]. The subject's hair has been lengthened on both sides in order to conceal the tips of his pointed ears (a near-universal racial characteristic of elves in the [[fantasy]] genre), and he has also been furnished with
