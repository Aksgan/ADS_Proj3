Helix Universal Servers are able to be linked to distribute content to enable large scale streaming across the Internet or Enterprise networks and to ensure fully redundant operation with no single point of failure. Helix Universal Server operates with a wide range of live RTP or RBS (RealNetworks own secure broadcasting protocol) encoders to provide a wide choice of interoperation with 3rd party vendors. RealNetworks develop their own encoder in three versions * RealProducer - for live and on-demand encoding of RealAudio and RealVideo for RealPlayer clients * Helix Producer - for live and on-demand encoding of H.264, H.263 and RealAudio, RealVideo for MP4 based and RealPlayer clients * Helix Mobile Producer - for live and on-demand encoding of H.264, H.263 and RealAudio, RealVideo for 3GPP, MP4 based and RealPlayer clients ==See also== * [[HTTP Live Streaming]] * [[Real Time Streaming Protocol]] * [[Real Time Messaging Protocol]] * [[RealNetworks]] * [[Helix Community]] ==External links== * [http://www.realnetworks.com/products-services/helix-server-proxy.aspx Helix Universal Streaming Server] * [http://www.realnetworks.com/helix-support/manuals-release-notes-legal.aspx How to install and integrate Helix Universal Streaming Server] * [http://www.realnetworks.com/helixplatform.aspx Helix Media Delivery Platform] {{DEFAULTSORT:Helix Universal Server}} [[Category:Computer companies of the United States]] [[Category:Entertainment companies of the United States]] [[Category:Software companies of the United States]] [[Category:Internet]] [[Category:Streaming software]]</text> </page> <page> <id>16509</id> <title>Helmi Technologies</title> <text>{{Infobox_Company | company_name = Helmi Technologies, Inc. | company_logo = [[Image:helmi logo new graybk w250.png|250px]] | company_type = [[Private company]] | company_slogan = Making Impossible Easy | foundation = [[Oulu|Oulu, Finland]], [[Finland]] ([[2004]]) | location = [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino, California, United States of America]] | key_people = Juho Risku, Founder in [[2004]], CEO between 2004 - 2006 | industry = [[Software]] | products = Helmi Open Source [[RIA]] Platform | }} '''Helmi Technologies''' and its predecessor, '''[[Visualway Design]]''' evolved from the desire of [[Finland|Finnish]] [[User interface|user interface(UI)]] designers and software engineers to build high-impact web-based applications and sites on an [[open source]] platform. Visualway Design was founded in 1996 and developed its first [[AJAX]]-type e-commerce application in 1997. This software featured layer-based windowing support, client-side payment systems, multiple browser support, and the ability to share information with other applications. During 2001 Visualway started development of its Virtual Browser, an application independent of browsers and UI components to be used across many platforms and devices. The [[patent]] applications for Virtual Browser were filed in 2003 and patent was granted in 2006. In 2004, Helmi Technologies separated from Visualway Design, with Helmi receiving its first round of venture capital and opening an office in [[Silicon Valley]], [[California]], in 2005. Helmi Technologies announced the release its product as open source at AJAX world Conference and Expo in October 2006, and joined the [[Eclipse Foundation]] as an Add-In Provider. == History == Founded by Juho Risku in 1996 as Visualway Design, as a digital media design agency. Visualway developed its first AJAX-type e-commerce application in 1997. The software featured layer-based windowing, client-side payment systems, multiple browser support and the ability to share information with other applications. Between 1998 and 2001 Visualway developed an advanced version of DynAPI for its own internal use. During 2001 Visualway started to develop its Virtual Browser. Visualway also developed plug-ins for [[Macromedia Dreamweaver]]. Helmi technologies received Macromedia Approved Certification in 2003 for the plug-ins developed by Visualway. In 2004 Helmi Technologies became an independent company. Helmi technologies immediately filed a patent application for Virtual Browser and released its first version. The first version of the UI component library was released in 2005. With global demand for RIA solutions Helmi Technologies opened its Silicon Valley branch in 2005, after receiving it first round venture capital. Helmi Technologies commences work on version 2.0 of User Interface Framework. Helmi Technologies got the Virtual Browser patent granted 2006. In October 2006 Helmi release the 2.0 version to the open source community and joins the [[Eclipse Foundation]]. In December 2006, Helmi closed its Silicon Valley branch. In April 2007, Helmi lost its chief architect. In May 2007, the majority of the employees were sacked. As of 2008, Helmi Technologies seems to be completely defunct. ==Products== Helmi Technologies offered Helmi Open Source [[RIA]] Development Platform – open source, [[AJAX]]-based platform for creating Rich Internet Applications. The Helmi Open Source [[RIA]] Platform supported rapid creation of interactive web-based applications by leveraging developers' existing skills and the development environments they were familiar with. The Helmi platform enabled UI component reusage across applications. It also allowed client- and server-side developers to work on independent parts of the application simultaneously. ===Platform sub-components=== * '''User Interface Framework''' – a browser-based server-independent user interface kit for RIA application development coupled with a minimalistic, speed-oriented server framework. The user interface framework incorporated patented Virtual Browser technology in its 1.0 version. It was removed from the 2.0 version, because of the serious performance hit, caused by its usage as well as the difficulty of maintaining and
