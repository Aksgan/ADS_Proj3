Better known in the 1980s as manufacturer of Videx VideoTerm (80 column [[display card]]) and Videx UltraTerm (80/132 column display card) add-on [[expansion card]] for [[Apple II]] computers. These products became obsolete when [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] released [[Apple IIe]] with most of the 80 column card [[hardware]] already built-in.

Viktor Ivannikov worked for [[Lebedev Institute of Precision Mechanics and Computer Engineering]] from 1962 to 1980, starting as a computer technician, leaving as a distinguished engineer, where he developed [[D-68 (operating system)|D-68]] operating system for [[BESM|BESM-6]] computer. After that he worked for «Delta» research facility where he led the development of distributed operating systems and supercomputers. ==External links== * [http://www.ras.ru/win/db/show_per.asp?P=.id-986.ln-en RAS person page] * [http://sp.cmc.msu.ru/staff/ivp.html System Programming Chair] {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME = Ivannikov, Viktor | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH = | PLACE OF BIRTH = | DATE OF DEATH = | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Ivannikov, Viktor}} [[Category:1940 births]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:Russian computer scientists]] {{comp-sci-stub}} [[ru:Иванников, Виктор Петрович]]</text> </page> <page> <id>39449</id> <title>Vimscript</title> <text>{{Infobox programming language | name = Vimscript | logo = | caption = | file ext = .vim | paradigm = | released = <!-- {{Start date|YYYY}} --> | designer = | developer = | latest release version = | latest release date = <!-- {{start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD}} --> | latest preview version = | latest preview date = <!-- {{start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD}} --> | typing = | implementations = | dialects = | influenced by = | influenced = | programming language = | platform = | operating system = | license = | website = | wikibooks = }} '''Vimscript''', also '''Vim script''', is the [[scripting language]] built into [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]].<ref>http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/usr_41.html</ref> Based on the [[Ex (text editor)|ex]] editor language of the original [[vi]] editor, early versions of Vim added commands for control flow and function definitions. Since version 7, Vimscript also supports more advanced data types such as [[List (computing)|Lists]] and [[Associative array|Dictionaries]] and (a simple form of) [[object-oriented programming]]. Built-in functions such as <tt>map()</tt> and <tt>filter()</tt> allow a basic form of [[functional programming]], but Vimscript is mostly written in an [[Imperative programming|imperative programming style]]. Vim [[macro]]s can contain a sequence of ''normal-mode'' commands, but can also invoke ex commands or functions written in Vimscript for more complex tasks. Almost all extensions (called plugins) of the core Vim functionality are written in Vimscript, but plugins can also utilize other scripting languages like [[Perl]] or [[Python (programming language)|Python]] (if support for them is compiled into the Vim binary). Vimscript files are stored in plain text format and the file name extension is .vim. == Example == <pre> :let i = 1 :while i < 5 : echo "count is" i : let i += 1 :endwhile </pre> ==References== <references/> ==External links== * [http://www.vim.org/scripts/index.php Vimscript repository] * [http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Vim_scripts Examples of Vim scripts] <!-- the category is copied from [[Python (programming language)]], because both VimScript & Python can be used to script in Vim (text editor)--> [[Category:Scripting languages]] <!-- these categories are copied from [[Vim (text editor)]]--> [[Category:Unix text editors]] [[Category:Windows text editors]] [[Category:Mac OS text editors]] [[Category:Mac OS X text editors]] [[Category:OpenVMS text editors]] [[Category:Free text editors]] {{software-stub}} [[cs:Vimscript]]</text> </page> <page> <id>39467</id> <title>Viridiplantae</title> <text>{{Taxobox | color =lightgreen | name = Viridiplantae | image = Taiwan 2009 East Coast ShihTiPing Giant Stone Steps Algae FRD 6581.jpg | image_caption = An assortment of [[thallophyte]] viridiplantae in a [[Tide pool|rock pool]], Taiwan | domain = [[Eukaryota]] | unranked_regnum = [[Archaeplastida]] | phylum = '''Viridiplantae''' }} '''Viridiplantae''' (literally "green plants")<ref name="pmid18063570">{{cite journal |author=Duvick J, Fu A, Muppirala U, ''et al'' |title=PlantGDB: a resource for comparative plant genomics |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=36 |issue=Database issue |pages=D959–65 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18063570 |pmc=2238959 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkm1041 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18063570}}</ref><ref name="urlwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">{{cite web |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=33090 |title=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-03-08}}</ref><ref name="pmid19216746">{{cite journal |author=Cocquyt E, Verbruggen H, Leliaert F, Zechman FW, Sabbe K, De Clerck O |title=Gain and loss of elongation factor genes in green algae |journal=BMC Evol.
