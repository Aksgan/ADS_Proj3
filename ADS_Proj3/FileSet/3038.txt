repeatedly ringing a bell mounted on its front; and after every few steps emit a mechanical "Ah!", as if it were speaking. The toy stood about 18 inches tall (roughly 46 cm). The gimmick of Mr. Machine was that one could not only see all of his mechanical "innards" through his clear plastic body, but one could also take the toy apart and put it back together, over and over, like a [[Lego]] toy or a [[jigsaw]] puzzle. Mr. Machine was one of Ideal's most popular toys. The company reissued it in 1978, but with some alterations: it could no longer be taken apart (owing to the tendency of very young children to put small pieces in their mouths which could be accidentally swallowed or present a choking hazard), and instead of ringing a bell and making the "Ah" sound, it now whistled "This Old Man". This later version of Mr. Machine was brought back once more in the 1980s. In 2004, the Poof-Slinky Company remanufactured the original 1960 version (using the actual Ideal molds whenever possible), which made the original sounds and could be disassembled, and with the intention of being marketed to nostalgic adults as a collectible. ==External links== * [http://www.spookshows.com/toys/machine/machine.htm Mr Machine Box] [[Category:1960 introductions]] [[Category:Toys of the 1960s]] [[Category:Toy robots]] [[Category:Ideal toys]]</text> </page> <page> <id>25212</id> <title>MtXinu</title> <text>{{lowercase|mtXinu}} :''For the unrelated operating system with a similar name, see [[Xinu]].'' <!-- Note to editors; places in this article where the trademark symbol is included after "Unix" is intentional and is not contrary to the Manual of Style; it is there because the company name is derived by reversing the six letters in "Unix(TM)".

Its slogan "We know Unix™ backwards and forwards" was an allusion<ref>{{harvnb|Salus|1994}}</ref> to the company's name and abilities. ''mt Xinu'' was a commercially licensed version of the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] [[Unix]] operating system for the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[VAX]]. The initial version was based on 4.1cBSD; later versions were based on 4.2 and 4.3BSD. ''more/BSD'' was mt Xinu's version of 4.3BSD-Tahoe for VAX and [[HP 9000]], incorporating code from the [[University of Utah]]'s [[HPBSD]]. It included [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]]. ''Mach386'' was a hybrid of [[Mach kernel|Mach 2.5/2.6]] and 4.3BSD-Tahoe/Reno for [[Intel 80386|386]] and 486 PCs. The company's principals were [[University of California, Berkeley]] [[computer science]] students and graduates, notably Bob Kridle, Alan Tobey, Ed Gould, and Vance Vaughan. Debbie Scherrer was a later contributor. mt Xinu is also famous for its light-hearted Unix-themed calendars, including: * ''Command of the Month'' (1987–1988) * ''Lessons in Art'' (1989) * ''Platform of the Year'' (1990) In 1991 a division of mt Xinu broke off to become [[Xinet]]. ==Notes== <references/> ==References== * {{Citation| last=Salus | first=Peter | authorlink=Peter Salus|year=1994 | title=A Quarter Century of UNIX | publisher=Addison-Wesley | isbn=0-201-54777-5 | ref=harv |pages=209}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Mt xinu}} [[Category:BSD]] [[Category:Mach]] [[Category:History of computing]] [[Category:Unix]]</text> </page> <page> <id>25221</id> <title>Muffin-tin approximation</title> <text>{{Electronic structure methods}} The '''[[muffin tin|muffin-tin]] approximation''' is a shape approximation of the [[potential field]] in an atomistic environment.

In the remaining interstitial region, the potential is approximated as a constant. Continuity of the potential between the atom-centered spheres and interstitial region is enforced. In the interstitial region of constant potential, the single electron wave functions can be expanded in terms of [[plane wave]]s.
