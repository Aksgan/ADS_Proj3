Action]] in [[California]] and in the [[University of California]] system. Some claimed there was a reduction in the numbers of Latino, African American and Native American students and rekindled their activism on campus concerning issues of race. However, supporters of [[Proposition 209]] have noted that the number of Asian American students, a small minority group nationally but a large minority group in California, has dramatically increased following its passage. Racial preferences remain a controversial topic, with some students supporting them while others are opposed to what they see as reverse racism, especially against Asian American students. [[Image:Berkeley DM 2009.JPG|thumb|left|[[Berkeley Dance Marathon|Dance Marathon]], one of the campus's student-led fundraising events.]] The Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC) is the [[student government]] organization that controls funding for student groups and organizes on-campus student events. It is considered one of the most autonomous student governments at any [[public university]] in the U.S. The two main political parties are "Student Action"<ref>[http://www.studentaction.org Student Action Webpage]</ref> and "CalSERVE."<ref>[http://www.calserve.org CalSERVE Webpage]</ref> The organization was founded in 1887 and has a budget of $2 million. The Residence Hall Assembly (RHA) is the student-run residence hall organization that oversees all aspects of residence wide event planning, legislation, sponsorships and activities for over 6000 on-campus undergraduate residents. Founded in 1988 by the President's Council, it is now funded and supported by the Residential and Student Service Programs department on campus. UC Berkeley's student-run online television station, [[CalTV]], was formed in 2005 and broadcasts online. It is run by students with a variety of backgrounds and majors. It can be viewed at [http://caltv.org caltv.org]. UC Berkeley's independent student-run newspaper is ''[[The Daily Californian]]''. Founded in 1871, ''The Daily Cal'' became independent in 1971 after the campus administration fired three senior editors for encouraging readers to take back [[People's Park (Berkeley)|People's Park]]. Berkeley's FM radio station, [[KALX]], broadcasts on 90.7 MHz. It is run largely by volunteers, including both students and community members. Berkeley Model United Nations is the oldest running high school Model United Nations conference in the nation holding an annual conference on campus with over 1500 high school students participating. The Berkeley Group<ref>[http://theberkeleygroup.org/ The Berkeley Group]</ref> is a student consulting organization affiliated with UC Berkeley and the [[Haas School of Business]]. Students of all majors are recruited and trained to work on pro-bono consulting engagements with real-life nonprofit clients. ImagiCal has been the college chapter of the [[American Advertising Federation]] at Berkeley since the late 1980's. Every year, the team competes in the [[National Student Advertising Competition]]. Students from various backgrounds come together to work on a marketing case provided by the AAF and a corporate sponsor to college chapters across the nation. Most recently, the UC Berkeley team won in their respective regions in both 2005 and 2009, eventually going on to win 4th and 3rd in the nation, respectively. Democratic Education at Cal, or DeCal, is a program that promotes the creation of professor-sponsored, student-facilitated classes through the Special Studies 98/198 program. DeCal arose out of the 1960s [[Free Speech movement]] and was officially established in 1981. The program offers around 150 courses on a vast range of subjects that appeal to the Berkeley student community, including classes on ''[[The Simpsons]]'', [[The Beatles]], [[James Bond]], [[Poker]], [[South Park]], [[Superman]], [[Batman]], [[Iranian Revolution|The Iranian Revolution]], [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]], [[political]] [[debate]], [[meditation]] and [[disc jockey|DJing]]. Additionally, the "Politics of Piracy" DeCal participates in the Wikimedia [http://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Public_Policy_Initiative Public Policy Initiative].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.decal.org/courses/index.php |title=Courses |publisher=DeCal |date= |accessdate=2010-05-24}}</ref> There are many [[a cappella]] groups on campus; two of the most popular are the [[UC Men's Octet]] and The [[California Golden Overtones]]. The [[UC Men's Octet]] is an eight-member a cappella group founded in 1948 featuring a repertoire of barbershop, doo-wop, contemporary pop, modern alternative, and fight songs. They are one of only two multiple time champions of the [[International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella|ICCA]], having won the championship in both 1998 and 2000. The [[California Golden Overtones]], founded in 1984, have a very similar repertoire to the Octet. It is a tradition for every Berkeley a cappella group to perform under the campus' iconic [[Sather Gate]] each week at different times during the week; [[Artists in Resonance]] performs Mondays at Noon, [[Noteworthy (UC Berkeley)|Noteworthy]] performs Tuesdays at 12:30PM, [[DeCadence]] performs Wednesdays at Noon, The Men's Octet performs Wednesdays at 1pm, and the Golden Overtones performs Fridays at 1pm. In addition to a Capella, Berkeley is host to a myriad of other performing arts groups in comedy, dance, acting and instrumental music. A few examples include [[jericho! Improv & Sketch Comedy]], Taiko drumming, BareStage student musical theater, and the Remedy Music Project. UC Berkeley also hosts a large number of conferences, talks, and musical and theatrical performances. Many of these events, including the [[Annual UC Berkeley Sociological Research Symposium]], are completely planned and organized by undergraduate students. ===Fraternities and sororities=== {{Main|List of fraternities and sororities at University of California, Berkeley}} ===Cooperative housing=== {{Main|Berkeley Student Cooperative}} ==Athletics== {{Main|California Golden Bears}} Cal's sports teams compete in intercollegiate athletics as the [[California Golden Bears]]. They participate in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s Division I-A as a member of the [[Pacific-10 Conference]]. The official school colors, established in 1873 by a committee of students, are Yale Blue and California Gold.<ref name="Resource Guide: Student history">{{cite web|url=http://resource.berkeley.edu/r_html/104history.html|title=Resource Guide: Student history|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|accessdate=2010-02-26}}</ref> Yale Blue was chosen because many of the university's founders were [[Yale University]] graduates (for example Henry Durant, the first university president), while California Gold was selected to represent the Golden State of California. Cal has a long history of excellence in athletics, having won national titles in football, men's basketball, baseball, softball, men's and women's crew, men's gymnastics, men's tennis, men's and women's swimming, men's water polo, men's Judo, men's track, and men's rugby.
