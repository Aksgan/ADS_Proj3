game as of yet to feature Dr. Robotnik as the central character is the 1993 game ''[[Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine]]'', a ''[[Puyo Puyo]]'' clone in which Robotnik, along with numerous bounty hunters seen in the first episode of ''Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog'', attempts to rid all the fun and music on the planet Mobius by kidnapping the citizens of one insignificant town and turning them into robots. Despite the fact that he is the title character, he is still the villain. ''[[Sonic and the Black Knight]]'' is the only game in the entire ''Sonic'' franchise in which Dr. Eggman does not make an appearance. ==In other media== {{Summarize section}} [[Image:Robotnik AoStH.PNG|left|thumb|140px|Robotnik as portrayed in the animated series (As seen in the episode "Robotnik Jr.") ''[[Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog]]'']] There have been four animated television series featuring Robotnik. ''[[Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' was the first, and featured [[Long John Baldry]] as the voice of Robotnik.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0222518/ ''Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog'' at the Internet Movie Database</ref> The cartoon had little history for Robotnik, whom, while still the series' main antagonist, was merely portrayed as a villain who sought to rule Mobius for no reason other than the fact that he appeared to be motivated by the act of "being evil." While the threat he posed to the Mobians seemed to vary from episode to episode, he was nonetheless portrayed as incompetent and Immature, with a tendency to mistreat his Badniks. His foremost of several catchphrases was "''I hate that hedgehog!'' (usually shouted out loud when Sonic cruelly got the better of him in each episode). Broadcast alongside ''Adventures'' was ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (TV series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', which featured Robotnik as a fierce (and far more competent) dictator who has already conquered most of the planet Mobius. This incarnation was voiced by [[Jim Cummings]] (who, coincidentally, auditioned for the role of Robotnik in ''The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog'' and did record some lines in the unaired pilot episode).<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106140/ ''Sonic the Hedghog''] at the Internet Movie Database</ref> ''[[Sonic Underground]]'' also featured Robotnik in this same light, this time voiced by [[Gary Chalk (actor)|Gary Chalk]], who previously voiced Grounder in the ''Adventures'' series. In the two-episode [[original video animation|OVA]] film ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie]]'', Eggman tells Sonic that he has been banished from Robotropolis by a metallic [[doppelgänger]] of himself. It is later revealed that the mecha was piloted by Eggman himself, in a scheme to lure Sonic into his base and copy his DNA for his new [[List of recurring characters from Sonic the Hedgehog (games)#Metal Sonic|Hyper Metal Sonic]] robot. Eggman was voiced by [[Junpei Takiguchi]] in the Japanese version, and by [[Edwin Neal]] in the English dub.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0237765/ ''Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie''] at the Internet Movie Database</ref> In ''[[Sonic X]]'' Doctor Eggman, along with other ''Sonic'' characters, are accidentally transported from their own world, to [[Earth]]. This incarnation is voiced by [[Chikao Ōtsuka]] in the Japanese version, and by [[Mike Pollock]] in the English [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]].<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367413/ ''Sonic X''] at the Internet Movie Database</ref> When the first ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' title was released in [[1991]], Sega published a comic book designed to promote the game. The 14-page story, written by Francis Mao, included a non-[[Canon (fiction)|canon]] [[origin story|origin]] for both Sonic the Hedgehog and Eggman. Originally a benevolent scientist named Dr. Ovi Kintobor ("Ivo Robotnik" with the names spelt backwards), he starts out as a friend to Sonic, even helping to develop the hedgehog's super-speed. Kintobor later tries to eliminate all the evil in the world by absorbing it into the [[Chaos Emeralds]], but the experiment goes awry, instead shocking the Doctor with "10,000 [[volt]]s of pure evil energy."<ref>Sonic HQ Comics Info - [http://archive.sonic-hq.net/newsite/comics/images/first.php Sega Promo Comic]. Retrieved on [[2008]]-[[February 23|2-23]].</ref> Though inaccurate in regards to the games, a similar origin story later found its way into the now-defunct [[UK]]-based ''[[Sonic the Comic]]'', which was published from [[1993]] through [[2002]], as well as many UK-published books such as ''Stay Sonic''. Kintobor appears in ''Sonic the Comic'' as a computer program designed to assist Sonic and the Freedom Fighters. Whilst Robotnik's initial appearance was from that of his appearance in the [[Mega Drive]] games, he later 'transformed himself' and took the appearance of his design from the ''Adventures'' series, which took effect from issue 22 onwards. That same year, [[Archie Comics]] began publishing its ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (comics)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' comic book. The series is faithful to (and in a sense, a continuation of) [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (TV series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' [[animated cartoon]]; As well as a mad scientist, Robotnik is a portrayed as a [[dictator]] who took control of Sonic's hometown during a [[coup d'etat]]. After his uncle is taken prisoner by Robotnik's henchmen, Sonic the Hedgehog joins forces with a band of [[Freedom Fighters (Sonic the Hedgehog)|Freedom Fighters]] who oppose Robotnik's reign. In recent years, the plot of the comic has changed to incorporate elements from the video games, with Robotnik being replaced by his more traditional video game counterpart. Originally a one-off villain, "Eggman" [[first appearance|first appeared]] as a separate version of Robotnik from a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]]. After defeating the Freedom Fighters of his universe, Robotnik "roboticized" them into half-organic, half-metal [[cyborg]]s. However, the Freedom Fighters retained their free will and used their newfound strength to demolish Robotnik's army. Realizing he was ruined, Robotnik went insane and roboticized himself, becoming Robo-Robotnik.<ref>''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (comic book)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] #19'' [[Archie Comics]]</ref> This incarnation later switched from his old body for the new one identical to his ''Sonic Adventure'' design and changed his name to "Eggman", replacing Robotnik as the main antagonist of the books.<ref>''Sonic the Hedgehog #75'' [[Archie Comics]]</ref> Later, Eggman was turned back into flesh and blood by aliens called the Bem. ==Cultural impact== ===In science=== A potential macrocycle inhibitor of [[Sonic hedgehog]] discovered by a Harvard University research team was named "Robotnikinin" after the Dr. Robotnik character.
