This product is marketed under other names and price points such as EAZ-FIX. Due to its sector based mapping, RollBack Rx does not recreate [[Computer file|files]] or [[folders]] into a temporary [[Mass storage|drive]] space — resulting in a larger capacity of incremental snapshots and faster snapshot times. The RollBack Rx snapshots can be taken manually, on a schedule or when a particular file is executed. == How it works == RollBack Rx installs to the hard drive's [[master boot record]], which loads prior to the Windows [[operating system]], which allows the hard drive to be reverted to a previous snapshot state even in the event that Windows is unable to [[Booting|boot]]. The user can also select to revert to a snapshot from within Windows, which requires a reboot or logoff to take effect. == Description == A [[Snapshot (computer storage)|snapshot]] is a [[bit]]-for-bit map of the hard [[disk sector]]. It is a record of how the PC's hard drive is configured at the time a snapshot is taken. The snapshot includes all files including system, [[data]], [[computer program|programs]], settings, the [[Windows registry|registry]], [[Computer wallpaper|wallpaper]], [[Icon (computing)|icons]], etc. == Incremental sector redirection == RollBack Rx's core [[algorithm]] is based on incremental sector redirection. [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operates at a [[Cluster (file system)|cluster]] level, which consists of multiple disk sectors. RollBack Rx works at the [[disk sector]] level. When a snapshot is taken, RollBack Rx freezes sectors to their current data. If Windows attempts to update that particular sector, RollBack Rx grabs the write and redirects it into unprotected sectors. If Windows attempts to delete that sector, Rollback Rx intercepts the delete. Additional snapshots freezes only those sectors that have been written since the last snapshot. == Incompatible products == It can be beneficial to disable RollBack Rx prior to using any Windows [[defragmentation]] utility, as file relocations are treated by RollBack Rx as relatively large data changes and can therefore cause large snapshots. The current version 9.1 does not support any third party disk defragmenter. However, defragmentation can be carried out without disabling RollBack Rx, and the data used can be freed by "re-baselining" (which will cause the removal of all snapshots taken so far). == Precautions == RollBack Rx does not support [[RAID]] or any server-based operating systems. RollBack Rx will not be accessible at bootup if the Master Boot Record is erased or altered. RollBack Rx, being a Windows application, cannot protect the hard drive from changes occurring under DOS or other operating systems (such as Linux). == External links == *[http://www.horizondatasys.com/169614.ihtml Developer's website] *[http://www.rollbacksoftware.com/ Official website] [[Category:Computer file systems]] [[Category:Backup software]] [[Category:Storage software]] [[sv:RollBack Rx]]</text> </page> <page> <id>32400</id> <title>Rollback (data management)</title> <text>{{nofootnotes|date=June 2009}} {{Redirect|Rollback|other uses|Rollback (disambiguation)}} {{selfref|For the Wikipedia tool, see [[Wikipedia:Rollback feature]].}} In [[database]] technologies, a '''rollback''' is an operation which returns the database to some previous state. Rollbacks are important for database [[data integrity|integrity]], because they mean that the database can be restored to a clean copy even after erroneous operations are performed. They are crucial for recovering from database server crashes; by rolling back any [[Database transaction|transaction]] which was active at the time of the crash, the database is restored to a consistent state. The rollback feature is usually implemented with a [[Database_log|transaction log]], but can also be implemented via [[multiversion concurrency control]]. ==Cascading rollback== A ''cascading rollback'' occurs in database systems when a transaction (T1) causes a failure and a rollback must be performed. Other transactions dependent on T1's actions must also be rollbacked due to T1's failure, thus causing a cascading effect. That is, one transaction's failure causes many to fail. Practical database recovery techniques guarantee cascadeless rollback, therefore a cascading rollback is not a desirable result. ==SQL== In [[SQL]], <code>ROLLBACK</code> is a command that causes all data changes since the last <code>[[Begin work (SQL)|BEGIN WORK]]</code>, or <code>[[Start transaction (SQL)|START TRANSACTION]]</code> to be discarded by the [[relational database management system]] (RDBMS), so that the state of the data is "rolled back" to the way it was before those changes were made. A <code>ROLLBACK</code> statement will also release any existing [[savepoint]]s that may be in use. In most SQL dialects, <code>ROLLBACK</code>s are connection specific. This means that if two connections are made to the same database, a <code>ROLLBACK</code> made in one connection will not affect any other connections. This is vital for proper [[Concurrent programming|concurrency]]. ==References== * {{cite book |author = [[Ramez Elmasri]] |title= Fundamentals of Database Systems |publisher= [[Pearson Addison Wesley]] |year= 2007|isbn= 0-321-36957-2 }} *[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms181299.aspx "ROLLBACK Transaction"], Microsoft SQL Server. *[http://www.pantz.org/software/mysql/mysqlcommands.html "Sql Commands"], Microsoft SQL Server. ==See also== *[[Savepoint]] *[[Commit (data management)|Commit]] *[[Ghost (software)|Norton Ghost]] *[[Undo]] {{databases}} {{compu-prog-stub}} [[Category:Data management]] [[Category:Database theory]] [[Category:SQL]] [[Category:Transaction processing]] [[cs:ROLLBACK]] [[de:Rollback]] [[es:Rollback]] [[fr:Rollback (base de données)]] [[it:Rollback]] [[nl:Rollback (dataopslag)]] [[ja:ロールバック]] [[pl:Rollback]] [[ru:Rollback (SQL)]] [[vi:Rollback (quản lý dữ liệu)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>32408</id> <title>Roman Phonetic Alphabet for English</title> <text>{{Proposed deletion/dated |concern = No evidence of notability; only mentioned in sources written by the inventors. |timestamp = 20110124112418 }} The '''Roman Phonetic Alphabet''' for [[English language|English]]
