Modern cryptanalysis involves massive statistical analysis and multiple trial decryptions. These are possible only with automated equipment. This has been true since before WWII; Polish cryptanalysts designed and built automated aids in their work on [[Enigma]] traffic. Arguably, the first modern computer (digital, electronic, programmable (sort of)) was built for cryptanalytic work at [[Bletchley Park]] (the [[Colossus_computer|Colossus]]) during the war. More modern computers were important after WWII, and some machines (eg, the [[Cray-1]]) are reported to have had machine instructions hardwired in at the request of [[NSA]]. Computers continue to be important in cryptanalysis well into the 21st century. NSA, in fact, is said to have the largest number of installed computers on the planet. Whether or
