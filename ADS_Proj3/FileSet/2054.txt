It is a family of standards that specifies a control framework for networked audio and video equipment and is published by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]].<ref>[http://www.iec.ch/ International Electrotechnical Commission]</ref> It has been designed to provide a means for entering a common set of management commands to control the transmission across the network as well as other functions within the interfaced equipment. The parts within this standard include:- * Part 1: General, * Part 2: [[Audio]], * Part 3: [[Video]], * Part 4: [[Data]], * Part 5: Transmission over networks, * Part 6: Packet transfer service, More information is available at the project group web site.<ref>[http://www.iec62379.org/ www.iec62379.org]</ref> Part one is common to all equipment that conforms to IEC 62379 and a preview of the published document can be downloaded from the IEC web store here,<ref>[http://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_iec62379-1{ed1.0}en.pdf IEC 62379-1]</ref> a section of the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] web site. 2 October 2008 Part 2, Audio has now been published and a preview can be downloaded from the IEC web store here ,<ref>[http://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_iec62379-2{ed1.0}en.pdf IEC 62379-2]</ref> a section the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] web site. ==References== {{reflist}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Iec 62379}} [[Category:Audio engineering]] [[Category:Networking standards]] [[Category:Broadcast engineering]] [[Category:IEC standards]] [[Category:Control engineering]] [[Category:Systems engineering]]</text> </page> <page> <id>17470</id> <title>IEEE-488</title> <text>[[Image:IEEE-488-Stecker2.jpg|thumb|right|IEEE-488 stacking connectors]] '''IEEE-488''' is a short-range digital communications [[computer bus|bus]] specification. It was created for use with [[automated test equipment]] in the late 1960s, and is still in use for that purpose. IEEE-488 was created as '''HP-IB''' ('''Hewlett-Packard Interface Bus'''), and is commonly called '''GPIB''' ('''General Purpose Interface Bus'''). It has been the subject of [[#Standards|several standards]]. == Characteristics == IEEE-488 is an [[8-bit]], electrically [[parallel communication|parallel]] bus. The bus employs sixteen signal lines — eight used for bi-directional data transfer, three for handshake, and five for bus management — plus eight ground return lines. Every device on the bus has a unique 5-bit primary [[Physical address|address]], in the range from 0 to 30 (31 total possible addresses).<ref name="NI-488.2">{{Cite book |title=NI-488.2 User Manual |date=February 2005 |publisher=National Instruments Corporation |id=NI P/N 370428C-01 |page=A-2 |chapter=GPIB Addressing |quote=The primary address is a number in the range 0 to 30. |url=http://www.ni.com/pdf/manuals/370428c.pdf |accessdate=2010-02-16 }}</ref><ref name="Agilent_82350B">{{Cite book |title=Agilent 82350B PCI GPIB Interface: Installation and Configuration Guide |date=20 July 2009 |publisher=Agilent Technologies |id=Agilent P/N 82350-90004 |page=26 |chapter=Table 1-1: 82350 GPIB interface card configuration parameters |quote=any address in the range 0 - 30, inclusive, may be used |url=http://cp.literature.agilent.com/litweb/pdf/82350-90004.pdf |accessdate=2010-02-16 }}</ref> The standard allows up to 15 devices to share a single physical bus of up to 20 meters total cable length. The physical topology can be linear or star (forked).<ref>{{Cite web |title=GPIB Instrument Control Tutorial |publisher=National Instruments |date=24 August 2009 |quote=connected in either a daisy-chain or star topology |url=http://zone.ni.com/devzone/cda/tut/p/id/2761 |accessdate=2010-02-16 }}</ref> Active extenders allow longer buses, with up to 31 devices theoretically possible on a logical bus. Control and data transfer functions are logically separated; a controller can address one device as a “talker” and one or more devices as “listeners” without having to participate in the data transfer. It is possible for multiple controllers to share the same bus;
