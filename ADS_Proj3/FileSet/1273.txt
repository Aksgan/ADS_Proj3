The first reanalysis product, [[ERA-15]], generated re-analyses for approximately 15 years, from December 1978 to February 1994. The second product, [[ERA-40]] (originally intended as a 40-year reanalysis) begins in 1957 (the [[International Geophysical Year]]) and covers 45 years to 2002. A new reanalysis product, [[ERA-Interim]], is being produced, to cover the period from 1989 to present as a precursor to a revised extended reanalysis product to replace ERA-40. In addition to re-analysing all the old data using a consistent system, the reanalyses also make use of much archived data that was not available to the original analyses. This allows for the correction of many historical hand-drawn maps where the estimation of features was common in areas of data sparsity. The ability is also present to create new maps of atmosphere levels that were not commonly used until more recent times. ==Accessing the data== The data can be downloaded for research use from ECMWF's homepage (see external links) and the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] data archives. The latter requires registration. == See also == * [[NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis]] - NCEP/NCAR re-analyses == External links == * [http://www.ecmwf.int/research/era/do/get/era-interim ERA-Interim project] * [http://www.ecmwf.int/research/era/Project/Plan/ ERA-40 project] * [http://www.ecmwf.int/products/data/archive/descriptions/er/ ERA-15 project] == References == * Uppala et al., 2005: The ERA-40 re-analysis.

It is designed to be customizable to precise application requirements of run-time performance and hardware needs. It is implemented in [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]] and has [[emulator|compatibility]] layers and [[Application programming interface|API]]s for [[POSIX]] and [[TRON Project|µITRON]]. == Design == eCos was designed for devices with memory size in the tens to hundreds of [[kilobyte]]s<ref>{{Cite news|last=Larmour|first=Jonathan|title=How eCos can be shrunk to fit|newspaper=Embedded Systems Europe|pages=34|date=May 2005|url=http://i.cmpnet.com/embedded/europe/esemay05/esemay05p32.pdf|format=PDF|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>, or with real-time requirements. It can be used on hardware with too little [[Random Access Memory|RAM]] to support [[Embedded system|embedded]] [[Linux]], which currently needs a minimum of about 2 MB of RAM, not including application and service needs. eCos runs on a wide variety of hardware platforms, including [[ARM architecture|ARM]], [[CalmRISC]], [[FR-V]], [[Hitachi H8]], [[IA-32]], [[Motorola 68000]], [[Matsushita AM3x]], [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], [[NEC V8xx]], [[Nios II]], [[PowerPC]], [[SPARC]], and [[SuperH]]. Included with the eCos distribution is [[RedBoot]], an [[open source]] [[application software|application]] that uses the eCos [[Hardware Abstraction Layer]] to provide [[booting|bootstrap]] [[firmware]] for [[embedded system]]s. ==History== eCos was initially developed by [[Cygnus Solutions]] which was later bought by [[Red Hat]]. In early 2002, Red Hat ceased development of eCos and laid off the staff that were working on the project<ref>{{cite news|title=Red Hat backs away from eCos?|publisher=linuxdevices.com|date=2002-06-19|url=http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS5933176616.html|accessdate=2007-04-01}}</ref>. Many of the laid-off staff continued to work on eCos, and some formed their own companies providing services for the software. In January 2004, at the request of the eCos developers, Red Hat agreed to transfer its eCos copyrights to the [[Free Software Foundation]]<ref>{{cite press release|title=Red Hat to contribute copyrights held in the eCos code base to the Free Software Foundation|publisher=Red Hat|date=2004-01-13|url=http://www.redhat.com/about/presscenter/2004/press_eCosFSF.html}}</ref>. The transfer was executed in October 2005 and finally implemented in May 2008. ==Non-free versions== '''eCosPro''' is a [[proprietary software|proprietary]] eCos and [[RedBoot]] distribution created by [[eCosCentric]] that is targeted towards developers looking to integrate eCos and [[RedBoot]] within commercial products. It is claimed as a "stable, fully tested, certified and supported version"<ref>{{cite press release|title=eCosCentric announces eCosPro Developer's Kit|publisher=OSNews|date=2003-09-02|url=http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=4395|accessdate=2007-03-31}}</ref>, however, some of the additional features have not been released as free software. ==Criticisms== The [[FreeBSD]] TCP/IP network stack port included with eCos is out of date—circa 2001—and exposes systems using such to numerous security and stability vulnerabilities (FreeBSD RELENG 4 4 0 RELEASE for IPv4 and FreeBSD's origin [[KAME project|KAME]] for IPv6), despite being claimed as "recent" in [http://ecos.sourceware.org/docs-latest/ref/tcpip-freebsd.html eCos documentation].
