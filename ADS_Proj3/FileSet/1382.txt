the network by connecting two ports together, causing a loop. This can be prevented by using a hub, where a loop will break other users on the hub, but not the rest of the network. This hazard can also be avoided by using switches that can detect and deal with loops, for example by implementing the [[spanning tree protocol]]. * A hub with a 10BASE2 port can be used to connect devices that only support 10BASE2 to a modern network. The same goes for linking in an old 10BASE5 network segment using an AUI port on a hub (individual devices that were intended for thicknet can be linked to modern Ethernet by using an AUI-10BASE-T [[transceiver]]). == See also == * [[Network switch]] ==External links== * [http://wiki.wireshark.org/HubReference Hub Reference] {{DEFAULTSORT:Ethernet Hub}} [[Category:Ethernet]] [[Category:Networking hardware]] [[ast:Amestador]] [[az:Hab]] [[bn:ইথারনেট হাব]] [[bs:Hub]] [[bg:Хъб]] [[ca:Concentrador]] [[cs:Hub]] [[da:Hub]] [[de:Hub (Netzwerk)]] [[et:Kohtvõrgu jaotur]] [[el:Πλήμνη (δίκτυο υπολογιστών)]] [[es:Concentrador]] [[eo:Koncentrilo]] [[eu:Kontzentratzaile]] [[fa:هاب]] [[fr:Hub Ethernet]] [[gl:Concentrador]] [[ko:이더넷 허브]] [[hi:नेटवर्क हब]] [[id:Hub]] [[ia:Concentrator]] [[it:Hub (informatica)]] [[he:רכזת]] [[lt:Šakotuvas (tinklo)]] [[hu:Hub (hálózat)]] [[ms:Hab (rangkaian)]] [[nl:Hub (computernetwerk)]] [[ja:ハブ (ネットワーク機器)]] [[no:Hub (datanettverk)]] [[pl:Koncentrator]] [[pt:Concentrador]] [[ru:Сетевой концентратор]] [[sk:Rozbočovač (ethernet)]] [[fi:Keskitin]] [[sv:Nätverkshubb]] [[ta:வலைப்பின்னல் மையம்]] [[uk:Концентратор]] [[zh:集線器]]</text> </page> <page> <id>12517</id> <title>Ethernet over twisted pair</title> <text>[[Image:10baseT cable.jpeg|thumb|right|Twisted-pair cable used with 10BASE-T]] [[Image:10baseT jack.png|thumb|right|8P8C plug used with 10BASE-T]] '''Ethernet over twisted pair''' refers to the use of cables that contain insulated copper wires twisted together in pairs for the [[physical layer]] of an [[Ethernet]] network—that is, a network in which the Ethernet protocol provides the data link layer. Other Ethernet cable standards use [[coaxial cable]] or [[optical fiber]]. There are several different standards for this [[copper]]-based physical medium. The most widely used are '''10BASE-T''', '''[[Fast Ethernet#100BASE-TX|100BASE-TX]]''', and '''[[Gigabit Ethernet#1000BASE-T|1000BASE-T]]''', running at 10 [[megabit per second|Mbit/s]] (also Mbps or Mbs<sup>-1</sup>), 100 Mbit/s, and 1000 Mbit/s (1 [[Gbit/s]]), respectively. These three standards all use the same connectors. Higher speed implementations nearly always support the lower speeds as well, so that in most cases different generations of equipment can be freely mixed. They use [[8P8C|8 position]] [[modular connector]]s, usually called [[RJ45]] in the context of [[Ethernet]] over twisted pair. The cables usually used are four-pair [[twisted pair cable]] (though 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX only actually require two of the pairs). Each of the three standards support both [[full-duplex]] and [[half-duplex]] communication. The common names for the standards derive from aspects of the physical media. The '''number''' refers to the theoretical maximum transmission speed in [[megabit]]s per second (Mbit/s). The '''BASE''' is short for [[baseband]], meaning that there is no [[frequency-division multiplexing]] (FDM) or other frequency shifting modulation in use; each signal has full control of wire, on a single frequency. The '''T''' designates [[twisted pair]] cable, where the pair of wires for each signal is twisted together to reduce [[radio frequency interference]] and [[crosstalk]] between pairs ([[FEXT]] and [[NEXT]]). Where there are several standards for the same transmission speed, they are distinguished by a letter or digit following the T, such as ''TX''. ==Cabling== <table align=right><tr><td> [[Image:Rj45plug-8p8c.png|thumb|none|240px|[[8P8C]] modular plug pin positioning]] <tr><td> {| class="wikitable" |+ [[TIA/EIA-568-B]] T568A termination <!--standard name is 'B' termination options are 'A' or 'B'--> !

Since 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX need only two pairs and [[Category 5 cable]] has four pairs, it is possible, but not standards compliant, to run two network connections (or a network connection and two [[RJ11|phone lines]]) over a Category 5 cable by using the normally unused pairs (pins 4–5, 7–8) in 10- and 100-Mbit/s configurations. In practice, great care must be taken to separate these pairs as most 10/100-Mbit/s hubs, switches and PCs internally hardwire pins 4–5 together and pins 7–8 together, thereby creating a short-circuit across each "unused" pair. Moreover, 1000BASE-T requires all four pairs to operate, pins 1 and 2, 3 and 6 — as well as 4 and 5, 7 and 8. It is conventional to wire cables for 10- or 100-Mbit/s Ethernet to either the [[TIA/EIA-568-B#T568A and T568B termination|T568A or T568B]] standards. Since these standards differ only in that
