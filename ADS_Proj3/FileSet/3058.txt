the Simple and the Complex]]''. The title of the book is taken from a line of an [[Arthur Sze]] poem: "The world of the quark has everything to do with a jaguar circling in the night." Gell-Mann is also a collector of [[East Asia]]n antiquities and a keen [[linguist]]. [[George Johnson (writer)|George Johnson]] wrote a biography of Gell-Mann, which is entitled ''Strange Beauty: Murray Gell-Mann and the Revolution in 20th-Century Physics''. ==Timeline== Gell-Mann earned a [[bachelor's degree]] in physics from [[Yale University]] in 1948, and a PhD in physics from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1951. He was a postdoctoral research associate in 1951, and a visiting research professor at [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] from 1952 to 1953. After serving as Visiting Associate Professor at [[Columbia University]] in 1954–55, he became a professor at the [[University of Chicago]] before moving to the [[California Institute of Technology]], where he taught from 1955 until 1993. He was awarded a Nobel Prize in physics in 1969 for his discovery of a system for classifying subatomic particles. He is currently the Robert Andrews Millikan Professor of Theoretical Physics Emeritus at Caltech as well as a University Professor in the Physics and Astronomy Department of the [[University of New Mexico]] in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. He is a member of the editorial board of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. In 1984 Gell-Mann co-founded the [[Santa Fe Institute]]—a non-profit research institute in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]—to study complex systems and disseminate the notion of a separate interdisciplinary study of complexity theory. There he met and befriended [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning novelist [[Cormac McCarthy]].<ref>{{cite web|author=D.

Margaret Dow (d. 1981), whom he married in 1955. His children are Elizabeth Sarah Gell-Mann (b. 1956) and Nicholas Webster Gell-Mann (b. 1963); and he has a stepson, Nicholas Southwick Levis (b. 1978). ==Awards== *[[Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics|Dannie Heineman Prize]] (1959) *[[Erice]] Prize (1990) *[[Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award|Ernest O.
