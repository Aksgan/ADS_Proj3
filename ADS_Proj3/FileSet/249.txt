In terms of ease of use, features and expandability the Apple II was a major technological advancement over its predecessor, the [[Apple I]], a limited-production bare [[circuit board]] computer for electronics hobbyists which pioneered many features that made the Apple II a commercial success. Introduced at the [[West Coast Computer Faire]] in 1977, the Apple II was among the first successful [[personal computer]]s; it launched the Apple company into a successful business (and allowed several related companies to start). Throughout the years, a number of models were sold, with the most popular model remaining relatively little changed into the 1990s. By the end of production in 1993, somewhere between five and six million Apple II series computers (including about 1.25 million Apple II<small>GS</small> models)<!-- Cites: http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/americas/04/16/jobs/ http://lamp.a2central.com/GenieLamp_A2/Text/1993/ALMP9309.TXT http://lamp.a2central.com/GenieLamp_A2/Text/1995/ALMP9511.TXT http://lamp.a2central.com/GenieLamp_A2/Text/1993/ALMP9309.TXT - the previous entry claimed only 2 million Apple II-line machines had been produced total, which is incorrect (in fact Apple surpassed 2 million Apple II sales in 1984) --> had been produced.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite book| last=Forster|first=Winnie|authorlink=Winnie Forster|title=The encyclopedia of consoles, handhelds & home computers 1972 - 2005|year=2005|publisher=GAMEPLAN|isbn=3-00-015359-4|page=18}}</ref> The Apple II became one of the most recognizable and successful computers during the 1980s and early 1990s. It was aggressively marketed through volume discounts and manufacturing arrangements to educational institutions which made it the first computer in widespread use in [[United States|American]] secondary schools. The effort to develop educational and business software for the Apple II, including the 1979 release of the popular [[VisiCalc]] [[spreadsheet]], made the computer especially popular with business users and families.<ref>{{cite web|title=Apple II Biography|url=http://www.allgame.com/platform.php?id=6|author=Chris Cavanaugh|date=May 2004| accessdate=2009-10-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Apple II: The World Catches On|url= http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2009/07/apple-ii-the-world-catches-on/|author=Wilson Rothman|date= 2009-07-19|accessdate=2009-10-07 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The First Spreadsheet|url= http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa010199.htm|author=Mary Bellis|accessdate=2009-10-07}}</ref> The original Apple II [[operating system]] was contained in [[Read-only memory|ROM]] along with Integer [[BASIC]]. Programs were entered, then saved and loaded on cassette tape. When the [[Disk II]] was implemented in 1978 by Steve Wozniak, a Disk Operating System or DOS was commissioned. The final and most popular version of this software was [[Apple DOS]] 3.3. Some commercial Apple II software booted directly and did not use standard DOS formats. This discouraged the copying or modifying of the software on the disks and improved loading speed. Apple DOS was superseded by [[Apple ProDOS|ProDOS]], which supported a hierarchical filesystem and larger storage devices. With an optional third-party [[Zilog Z80|Z80]]-based [[expansion card]]<ref name=z80>{{cite journal|work=[[InfoWorld]]|publisher=InfoWorld Media Group|date=6 February 1984| issue=Vol. 6, Num. 6|quote=Several manufacturers, however, make Z80 coprocessor boards that plug into the Apple II.|page=64|title=Review: Premium Softcard IIe|last=Petersen|first=Marty}}</ref> the Apple II could boot into the [[CP/M]] operating system and run [[WordStar]], [[dBase II]], and other CP/M software. At the height of its evolution, towards the late 1980s, the platform had the graphical look of a hybrid of the Apple II and [[Macintosh]] with the introduction of the Apple II<small>GS</small>. By 1992, the platform had [[16-bit]] processing capabilities, a mouse-driven [[Graphical user interface|Graphical User Interface]], and graphics and sound capabilities far beyond the original. Despite the introduction of the Motorola 68000-based [[Apple Lisa]] system in 1983, and its more successful cousin the [[Macintosh]] in 1984, the relatively unsophisticated Apple II series was Apple's primary revenue source for most of the following decade. At its peak, it was a billion-dollar-a-year industry with its associated community of third-party developers and retailers. The Apple II<small>GS</small> was sold until the
