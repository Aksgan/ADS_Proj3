on the validity of their results. LQs are required to understand techniques such as [[Monte Carlo]], [[finite difference method]], as well as the nature of the products being modelled. ===Algorithmic Trading Quant=== Often the highest paid form of Quant, ATQs make use of methods taken from [[signal processing]], [[game theory]], gambling [[Kelly criterion]], [[market micro structure]], [[econometrics]], and [[time series]] analysis. [[Algotrading]] includes [[statistical arbitrage]], but includes techniques largely based upon speed of response, to the extent that some ATQs modify hardware and Linux kernels to achieve ultra low [[latency]]. ===Risk management=== This has grown in importance in recent years, as the credit crisis exposed holes in the mechanisms used to ensure that positions were correctly hedged, though in no bank does the pay in risk approach that in front office. A core technique is [[Value at Risk]], and this is backed up with various forms of stress testing and direct analysis of the positions and models used by traders. ===Model validation=== MV takes the models and methods developed by front office, library, and modelling quants and determines their validity and correctness. The MV group might well be seen as a superset of the quant operations in a financial institution, since it must deal with new and advanced new models and trading techniques from across the firm. However, the pay structure in all firms is such that MV groups struggle to attract and retain adequate staff, often with talented quants leaving at the first opportunity. This gravely impacts corporate ability to manage model risk, or to ensure that the positions being held are correctly valued. An MV quant will typically earn a fraction of quants in other groups with similar length of experience. === Quantitative Developer=== Although most quants spend the majority of their time programming and operating computers, there has emerged a specialism of implementing models so that the values may be calculated from [[market data]]. Whereas prototypes and early development may be in a mix of tools such as [[Matlab]] and [[R (programming language)|R]], most software is written in [[C++]] for performance and better integration with existing systems. ==Mathematical and statistical approaches== Because of their backgrounds, quants draw from three forms of mathematics: statistics and probability, calculus centered around [[partial differential equation]]s, and econometrics. The majority of quants have received little formal education in mainstream economics, and often apply a mindset drawn from the physical sciences. Physicists tend to have significantly less experience of statistical techniques, and thus lean on approaches based upon [[Partial differential equation|PDEs]], and solutions to these based upon [[numerical analysis]]. The most commonly used numerical methods are * [[Finite Difference Method]] Used to solve [[Partial differential equation|PDEs]] * [[Monte Carlo Method]] Also used to solve [[Partial differential equation|PDEs]], but [[Monte Carlo simulation]] is also common in risk management ==Techniques== A typical problem for a numerically oriented quantitative analyst would be to develop a model for pricing, hedging, and risk-managing a complex derivative product. Mathematically-oriented quants tend to have more of a reliance on numerical analysis, and less of a reliance on statistics and econometrics. These quants tend to be of the psychology that prefers a deterministically "correct" answer, as once there is agreement on input values and market variable dynamics, there is only one correct price for any given security (which can be demonstrated, albeit often inefficiently, through a large volume of Monte Carlo simulations). A typical problem for a statistically oriented quantitative analyst would be to develop a model for deciding which stocks are relatively expensive and which stocks are relatively cheap. The model might include a company's book value to price ratio, its trailing earnings to price ratio, and other accounting factors. An investment manager might implement this analysis by buying the underpriced stocks, selling the overpriced stocks, or both. Statistically-oriented quants tend to have more of a reliance on statistics and econometrics, and less of a reliance on sophisticated numerical techniques and object-oriented programming. These quants tend to be of the psychology that enjoys trying to find the best approach to modeling data, and can accept that there is no "right answer" until time has passed and we can retrospectively see how the model performed. Both types of quants demand a strong knowledge of sophisticated mathematics and computer programming proficiency. One of the principal mathematical tools of quantitative finance is [[stochastic calculus]]. == Areas of work == *Trading strategy development *Portfolio optimization *Derivatives pricing and hedging: involves a lot of highly efficient (usually object-oriented) software development, advanced numerical techniques, and stochastic calculus *Risk management: involves a lot of time series analysis, calibration, and [[backtesting]] *Credit analysis == Seminal publications == {{See also|List of quantitative analysts}} *1900 - [[Louis Bachelier]], ''Théorie de la spéculation'' *1952 - [[Harry Markowitz]], ''Portfolio Selection'', [[Modern portfolio theory]] *1956 - [[John Larry Kelly, Jr|John Kelly]], ''A New Interpretation of Information Rate'' *1967 - [[Edward O.
