neutral, seeing little value in participating yet again in a European conflict. A few supported the American cause.<ref>Joseph T. Glatthaar and James Kirby Martin, ''Forgotten Allies: The Oneida Indians and the American Revolution'' (2007)</ref> The British provided arms for the Indians, under Loyalist leadership, to raid frontier settlements from the [[Province of Carolina|Carolinas]] to New York, threatening to massacre the settlers, especially in Pennsylvania. The most prominent was Mohawk chief Joseph Brant, who led a band of 300 Indian warriors and 100 white loyalists in 1778 and 1780 multiple attacks on small frontier settlements in New York and Pennsylvania.<ref>see Barbara Graymont, "Thayendanegea", [http://www.biographi.ca/EN/ShowBio.asp?BioId=36808&query=joseph%20AND%20brant ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online'']</ref> In 1776 Cherokee war parties attacked all along the southern frontier.<ref>Tom Hatley, ''The Dividing Paths: Cherokees and South Carolinians through the Era of Revolution'' (1993); James H.

In 1779 Washington sent General John Sullivan with four brigades of Continental soldiers to drive the Iroquois out of upstate western New York. There was little combat but Sullivan systematically burned 40 (empty) Indian villages and, most important, destroyed about 160,000 bushels of corn that comprised the winter food supply. Facing starvation the Iroquois permanently fled to the Niagara Falls area and to Canada, where the British fed them.<ref>Joseph R. Fischer, ''A Well-Executed Failure: The Sullivan Campaign against the Iroquois, July–September 1779'' (1997).</ref> At the peace conference the British abandoned their Indian allies, and the Americans took possession of all the land east of the Mississippi and north of Florida. Calloway concludes: :Burned villages and crops, murdered chiefs, divided councils and civil wars, migrations, towns and forts choked with refugees, economic disruption, breaking of ancient traditions, losses in battle and to disease and hunger, betrayal to their enemies, all made the American Revolution one of the darkest periods in American Indian history.<ref>Calloway (1995) p. 290</ref> The British, however, did not give up their forts in the west until 1796 and kept alive the dream of one day forming a satellite Indian nation in what is now the Ohio to Wisconsin part of the Midwest. That goal was one of the causes of the [[War of 1812]].<ref>Dwight L.

Both British and American governments made promises of freedom for service and some slaves fought in one or the other armies. Starting in 1777 abolition occurred in the North, usually on a gradual schedule with no payments to the owners, but slavery persisted in the South and took on new life after 1790.<ref>Benjamin Quarles, ''The Negro in the American Revolution'' (1961)</ref> During the Revolution, efforts were made by the British to turn slavery against the Americans,<ref name="Revolutionary War: The Home Front">[http://memory.loc.gov/learn/features/timeline/amrev/homefrnt/homefrnt.html Revolutionary War: The Home Front], The Library of Congress</ref> but historian David Brion Davis explains the difficulties with a policy of wholesale arming of the slaves: {{quote|But England greatly feared the effects of any such move on its own West Indies, where Americans had already aroused alarm over a possible threat to incite slave insurrections.
