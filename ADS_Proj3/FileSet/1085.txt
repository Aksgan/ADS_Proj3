It is a type of [[intelligent agent]] that operates in a [[data warehouse]] and does the actual dirty work involved in finding sometimes less than obvious relationships between different pieces of data. This type of agent is able to detect major trend changes, as well as detect new pertinent information. If a new piece of information is found, the agent will generally attempt to alert the end-user of the new information. For example, a corporation may develop an agent to analyze economic trends. If the agent detects that consumers are becoming more conservative, it will alert management of the change. With this information in hand, management can better plan on how to produce, market, and sell its product. It will make all the process efficiently. ==General references== * Stephen Haag et al., Management Information Systems for the information age, ISBN 0-07-095569-7 ==External links== * [http://www-fp.mcs.anl.gov/ccst/research/reports_pre1998/algorithm_development/padma/kargupta.html Parallel Data Mining Agents] An article dealing with PDMAs * [http://www.agentmining.org/ Agent Mining] Agent Mining Interaction and Integration {{DEFAULTSORT:Data Mining Agent}} [[Category:Data mining]]</text> </page> <page> <id>9402</id> <title>Data pimping</title> <text>{{cleanup|date=August 2010}} {{wikify|date=August 2010}} '''Data pimping''' is a [[pejorative term]] used to describe the act of an [[ISP|Internet service provider]] (ISP) profiting from the sale of its users' personal [[Clickstream|clickstream data]].<ref>[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/03/17/phorm_fipr_illegal/ Net think thank: Phorm is illegal]</ref> The practice of data pimping first appeared through [[British Telecom]]'s secret, allegedly illegal trials of the controversial [[Webwise]] system developed by [[Phorm]], a former [[spyware]] company.<ref>[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/04/14/bt_phorm_2007/ BT's 'illegal' 2007 Phorm trial profiled tens of thousands]</ref><ref>[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/04/01/bt_phorm_2006_trial/ BT and Phorm secretly tracked 18,000 customers in 2006]</ref><ref>[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/25/phorm_isp_advertising/ ISP data deal with former 'spyware' boss triggers privacy fears]</ref> The phenomenon of data pimping is being researched and utilized by several ISPs, both in the United Kingdom and the United States.<ref>[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/04/10/american_isps_embrace_behavioral_ad_targeting/ American ISPs already sharing data with outside ad firms]</ref> ==Also Known As== [[intra-ISP spyware]] ==See also== ===Behavioral targeting=== *[[Front Porch]] *[[NebuAd]]<ref name="charter-nebuad">[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/14/charter-will-monitor-customers-web-surfing-to-target-ads/index.html?ref=business Charter Will Monitor Customers’ Web Surfing to Target Ads]</ref> *[[Phorm]] ===ISPs employing data pimping=== ====Currently Partnered with Phorm==== *[[Virgin Media]] ====Previously Partnered with Phorm==== *[[British Telecom]] - BT retail <ref>http://www.tcmagazine.nl/comments.php?shownews=27746&catid=6</ref> *[[TalkTalk (telecommunications company)|Talk Talk]]<ref>http://www.networkworld.com/news/2009/070809-talktalk-follows-bt-and-dumps.html</ref> For a detailed list of UK ISPs with regards to their application of intra ISP spyware technologies, see [http://badphorm.co.uk/e107_plugins/forum/forum_viewforum.php?11] ====Partnered with NebuAd==== *[[Charter Communications]]<ref name="charter-nebuad"/> ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Data privacy]] [[Category:Internet privacy]] [[Category:Privacy of telecommunications]] [[Category:Internet marketing]] {{www-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>9404</id> <title>Data processing system</title> <text>{{redir|data processor|the vocation|data entry clerk}} {{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}} [[Image:Information processing system (english).svg|500px|thumb|Information Processor]] [[Image:Data processing system (english).svg|500px|thumb|Data Processor]] In [[information processing]],a '''Data Processing System''' is a [[system]] which [[data processing|processes data]] which has been captured and [[code|encoded]] in a [[File format|format]] recognizable by the data processing system or has been created and stored by another unit of an [[information processing system]]. A data entry is a specialized component or form of an information processing (sub)system. Its chief difference is that it tends to perform a dedicated function (i.e., its [[Computer program|program]] is not readily changeable). Its dedicated function is normally to perform some (intermediate) step of converting input ('raw' or unprocessed) data, or semi-processed information, in one form into a further or final form of information through a [[Process (computing)|process]] called [[decode|decod]]ing / [[encode|encod]]ing or formatting or re-formatting or [[translation]] or [[data conversion]] before the information can be [[output]] from the data processor to a further step in the information processing system. For the hardware data processing system, this information may be used to change the sequential states of a (hardware) machine called a [[computer]]. In all essential aspects, the hardware data processing unit is indistinguishable from a computer's [[central processing unit]] (CPU), i.e. the hardware data processing unit is just a dedicated computer. However, the hardware data processing unit is normally dedicated to the specific [[computer application]] of format translation. A software code [[compiler]] (e.g., for [[Fortran]] or [[ALGOL]]) is an example of a [[software]] data processing system. The software data processing system makes use of a (general purpose) computer in order to complete its functions. A software data processing system is normally a standalone unit of software, in that its output can be directed to any number of other (not necessarily as yet identified) information processing (sub)systems. {{software-stub}} [[Category:Data management]] [[lt:Duomenų apdorojimo sistema]]</text> </page> <page> <id>9438</id> <title>Data validation</title> <text>In [[computer science]], '''data validation''' is the process of ensuring that a program operates on clean, correct and useful data. It uses routines, often called "[[validation rule]]s" or "check routines", that check for correctness, meaningfulness, and security of data that are input to the system. The rules may be implemented through the automated facilities of a [[data dictionary]], or by the inclusion of explicit [[application program]] validation logic. For business applications, data validation can be defined through [[declarative programming|declarative]] [[data integrity]] rules, or [[imperative programming|procedure-based]] [[business rules]]<ref>[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa291820(VS.71).aspx Data Validation, Data Integrity, Designing Distributed Applications with Visual Studio .NET]</ref>. Data that does not conform to these rules must negatively affect business process execution. Therefore, data validation should start with business process definition and set of business rules within this process. Rules can be collected through the requirements capture exercise<ref>Arkady Maydanchik (2007), "Data Quality Assessment", Technics Publications, LLC</ref>. The simplest data validation verifies that the characters provided come from a valid set. For example, telephone numbers should include the [[numerical digit|digit]]s and possibly the characters <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>(</code>, and <code>)</code> (plus, minus, and parentheses). A more sophisticated data validation routine would check to see the user had entered a valid country code, i.e., that the number of digits entered matched the convention for the country or area specified. Incorrect data validation can lead to [[data corruption]] or a [[software security vulnerability|security vulnerability]]. Data validation checks that data are valid, sensible, reasonable, and secure before they are processed. ==Validation methods== ;Allowed character checks : Checks that ascertain that only expected characters are present in a field. For example a numeric field may only allow the digits 0-9, the decimal point and perhaps a minus sign or commas. A text field such as a personal name might disallow characters such as < and >, as they could be evidence of
