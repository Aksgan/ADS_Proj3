Each episode is an educational look of varying depth into the [[construction]], [[Operations management|operation]], and [[staffing]] of various structures or construction projects, but not ordinary construction products. Generally containing interviews with [[designer]]s and [[project manager]]s, it presents the problems this involved the or products that are now in general use within the construction industry. MegaStructures focuses on constructions that are extreme; in the sense that they are the biggest, tallest, longest, or deepest in the world. Alternatively, a project may appear if it had an element of novelty or are a world first (such as [[Dubai]]'s [[Palm Islands]]). This type of project is known as a [[Megaproject]]. The series follows similar subjects as the [[History Channel]]'s [[Modern Marvels]] and [[Discovery Channel]]'s [[Extreme Engineering]]; covering areas of [[architecture]], transport, [[construction]] and manufacturing. ==Episodes== ===Season 1 (2004)=== {| class="wikitable sortable" |- ! # !
