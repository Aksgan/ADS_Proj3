new company was set up in the UK, [[Ability Plus Software|Ability Plus Software (UK) Ltd]], and it joined forces with LANware, with new funding, to develop and market a new version of Ability Plus (version 2.0) which was released in 1992 and then version 3.0 in 1995. By this time, the popularity of DOS based programs was in decline and in addition, Ability Plus suffered from the lack of development investment in the period following the launch of version 1.0 (almost no development took place from 1988 to 1991). ==Development== Ability was originally developed by a team all of whom came from the University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada<ref name="waterloo">[http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=84426&cid=7373969 Slashdot ], 2003 thread.</ref>. By the time of Ability Plus, the majority of the code was in C with a small amount of assembly. The following list of contributors is lifted directly from the Ability Plus line of source code, in approximately chronological order, with given year showing an earliest date for "first appearance": (1984) Ashok Patel, Tracey Allen, Andrew Forber, Richard B. McMurray, Tom Keith, Mike Gore, Drew Sullivan, Tom Dressing, David (Collier-) Brown, Karen Banks, (1986) Michael Smith, Rita Khan, Pete Sketch, (1991) Phil Roach, Mike King, Mike Young, J Raymond, Vassil Stoilov, George Georiev. ==A Windows Version?== In the early 1990s, some thought was given to making a Windows version of Ability Plus, but the difficulties in fashioning a Windows program from DOS code led to the decision to start from scratch. The outcome of this line of development was [[Ability Office]], and although it shares no source code with the Ability Plus, an attempt was made to follow some of the design principles of the original such as shared code and a common recalculation engine. ==References== <references /> ==External links== *[http://www.ability.com/ Ability Plus Software] *[http://www.ability.com/support/dos/ab3.php Download Ability Plus], for the curious, full working download of Ability Plus 3.0 [[Category:Office suites]] [[Category:DOS software]]</text> </page> <page> <id>690</id> <title>Ablative case</title> <text>{{about||the physical process|Ablation|the spacecraft technology|Ablative armor}} In [[linguistics]], '''ablative case''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''abl'''}}) is a name given to [[grammatical case|cases]] in various languages whose common characteristic is that they mark motion away from something, though the details in each language may differ. The name "ablative" is derived from the [[Latin]] ''ablatus'', the (irregular) perfect passive participle of ''auferre'' "to carry away". ==Indo-European languages== ===Latin=== {{Main|Ablative (Latin)}} The [[Latin]] ablative case (''ablativus'')is mainly used [[adverb]]ially to modify [[verb]]s. It has 15 uses, descending from three [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] cases: ablative (from), instrumental (with), and locative (in/at). The ablative is sometimes called the [[adverbial case]], since phrases in the ablative can be translated as [[adverb]]s: ''magnā (cum) celeritāte'' can be translated as "with great speed" or "very quickly." ===Greek=== In [[Ancient Greek]], the functions of the ablative case were taken by the [[genitive case|genitive]], so that the genitive has functions belonging to the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] genitive and ablative cases.<ref>[[Herbert Weir Smyth]]. ''Greek Grammar''. par. 1279: composite or mixed cases.</ref> The genitive case with the prepositions ἀπό ''apó'' "away from" and ἐκ/ἐξ ''ek/ex'' "out of" is an example. ===Albanian=== The ablative case is found in Albanian where it is the fifth case and is called "mënyra rrjedhore." ===Sanskrit=== The ablative case in Sanskrit is the fifth case (panchami) in the grammar, and has similar function to that of Latin. Sanskrit nouns in this case often refer to a subject "out of" which or "from" whom something (an action, an object) has arisen or occurred. E.g. ''patram '''vrikshaat''' patati'' "the leaf falls '''from the tree'''". This case is also used for nouns in several other senses, eg, where the action occurs "because of" or "without" a certain noun; nouns indicating distance or direction. ===Armenian=== In the Western Armenian language, the ablative case is rendered by the suffix ''-e'' (indefinite) or ''-en'' (definite). :''Mart'' - man :''Marten'' - from the man :''Marte'' - from (a) man :''Doon'' - house :''D'nen'' - from the house :''D'ne'' - from (a) house In Eastern Armenian, the suffix ''-its'' is used for both definite and indefinite nouns. ''Mard-'' man ''Mardits-'' from man ''Toon-'' house ''T'nits-'' from house Both suffixes are derived from Classical Armenian. The Western suffix ''-e'' is from the Classical singular and the Eastern suffix ''-its'' is from the Classical plural; both have been generalized for singular and plural in the dialects that use them. In Armenian, the ablative case has several uses. *Its principal function is to show motion away from a point in space or time. **''KAGHAKEN katsi.'' - I came FROM THE CITY. (Eastern Armenian; ''KAGHAKITS gnets'') **''ASTEGHEN heroo g'abrei.'' - I used to live far FROM HERE. (Ea. ''ASTEGHITS heroo ei b'nakvoom'') *The case also shows the agent when used with the passive voice of the verb. **''INE misht g' sirveis.'' - You were always loved BY ME. (Ea. ''INDZITS misht eis sirvoom'') **''AZAD'CHNEREN azadetsank.'' - We were freed BY THE LIBERATORS. (Ea. ''AZATOGHNERITS azatfetsink'') *The ablative case is also important to comparative statements in colloquial Armenian. **''Inch MEGHREN anoosh eh?'' - "What is sweeter THAN HONEY?" (proverb) (Ea. ''Inch MEGHRITS e anoosh?'') **''Mariam EKHPEREN b'zdig eh.'' - Mary is smaller (younger) THAN HER BROTHER. (Ea. ''Maro AKHBERITS e bakas'') **In this use, the ablative can also be used with infinitives and participles. ***''Tooz hamdesel e lav DESNALE.'' - Figs are better to taste THAN TO SEE. (Ea. ''T'zner hamtesel e laf TESNELITS'') *The ablative case is also important to case government with postpositions. **''INE var'' - Below ME (Ea. ''INDZITS var'') **''KEZME ver'' - Above YOU (Ea. ''KEZITS ver'') **''ANONTSME verch'' - After THEM (Ea. ''N'RANITS verj'') **''MEZME arach'' - Before US (Ea. ''MEZNITS araj'') ==Uralic languages== ===Finnish=== In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], the ablative case is the sixth of the locative cases with the meaning "from, off, of", e.g. ''pöytä – pöydältä'' "table – off from the table". It is an outer locative case, used just as the [[adessive]] and [[allative]] cases to denote both being on top of something and "being around the place" (as opposed to the inner locative case,
