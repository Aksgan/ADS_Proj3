dimensions. The Scatter plot takes multiple scalar variables and uses them for different axes in phase space. The different variables are combined to form coordinates in the phase space and they are displayed using glyphs and colored using another scalar variable. === In the applied sciences === :<gallery> Image:Porsche 911 model imported from a NASTRAN bulk data file.jpg|''Porsche 911 model'' Image:YF-17 aircraft Plot.jpg|''YF-17 aircraft Plot'' Image:City rendering.jpg|''City rendering'' </gallery> ''Porsche 911 model'' (NASTRAN model): The featured plot contains a Mesh plot of a Porsche 911 model imported from a NASTRAN bulk data file. VisIt can read a limited subset of NASTRAN bulk data files, generally enough to import model geometry for visualization. ''YF-17 aircraft Plot'': The featured image displays plots of a CGNS dataset representing a YF-17 jet aircraft. The dataset consists of an unstructured grid with solution. The image was created by using a pseudocolor plot of the dataset's Mach variable, a Mesh plot of the grid, and Vector plot of a slice through the Velocity field. ''City rendering'': An ESRI shapefile containing a polygonal description of the building footprints was read in and then the polygons were resampled onto a rectilinear grid, which was extruded into the featured cityscape. ''Inbound traffic measured'': This image is a visualization study of inbound traffic measured in billions of bytes on the NSFNET T1 backbone for the month of September 1991. The traffic volume range is depicted from purple (zero bytes) to white (100 billion bytes). It represents data collected by Merit Network, Inc.<ref>Image by [[Donna Cox]] and Robert Patterson.

McCormick]] (1930 - 2007) was an American [[computer scientist]], who studied Physics from MIT, Cambridge University and Harvard University in the 1950s. In the 1960s he initiated and directed the [[ILLIAC III]] Image Processing Computer project and developed the first imaging of blood flow and macular degeneracy in the human retina. In the 1980s he organized and chaired the first Brain Mapping Machine Design Workshop in 1985. Two years later in 1987, he developed and promoted the concept of "scientific visualization" at the [[National Science Foundation]] Advisory Panel on Graphics, Image Processing, and Workstations.<ref name="KF07">Kathy Flores (2007).

DeFanti]] (born 1948) is an American computer graphics researcher and Director of the [[Electronic Visualization Laboratory]] (EVL), who studied mathematics and computer information science, with a PhD in Computer Graphics Research received in 1973. He joined the faculty of the University of Illinois at Chicago, and next he amassed a number of credits. He cofounded the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL), used the EVL hardware and software for the computer animation produced for the [[Star Wars]] movie.<ref name="Bio08">[http://www.cs.uic.edu/~tom/ Thomas A.
