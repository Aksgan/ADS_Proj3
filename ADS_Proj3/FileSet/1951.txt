already equipment available to handle bills. ==Desktop calculators== {{Main|Calculator}} [[File:Curta01.JPG|thumb|The [[Curta]] calculator can also do multiplication and division]] By the 20th century, earlier mechanical calculators, cash registers, accounting machines, and so on were redesigned to use electric motors, with gear position as the representation for the state of a variable. The word "computer" was a job title assigned to people who used these calculators to perform mathematical calculations. By the 1920s [[Lewis Fry Richardson]]'s interest in weather prediction led him to propose [[human computer]]s and [[numerical analysis]] to model the weather; to this day, the most powerful computers on [[Earth]] are needed to adequately model its weather using the [[Navier-Stokes equations]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hunt|1998|pp=xiii–xxxvi}}</ref> Companies like [[Friden, Inc.|Friden]], [[Marchant Calculator]] and [[Monroe Calculator Company|Monroe]] made desktop mechanical [http://www.oldcalculatormuseum.com/fridenstw.html calculators] from the 1930s that could add, subtract, multiply and divide. During the [[Manhattan project]], future Nobel laureate [[Richard Feynman]] was the supervisor of the roomful of human computers, many of them female mathematicians, who understood the use of [[differential equations]] which were being solved for the war effort. In 1948, the [[Curta calculator|Curta]] was introduced. This was a small, portable, mechanical calculator that was about the size of a [[pepper grinder]]. Over time, during the 1950s and 1960s a variety of different brands of mechanical calculators appeared on the market. The first all-electronic desktop calculator was the British [[Sumlock ANITA calculator|ANITA Mk.VII]], which used a [[Nixie tube]] display and 177 subminiature [[thyratron]] tubes. In June 1963, Friden introduced the four-function EC-130. It had an all-transistor design, 13-digit capacity on a {{convert|5|in|mm|sing=on}} [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]], and introduced [[Reverse Polish notation]] (RPN) to the calculator market at a price of $2200. The EC-132 model added square root and reciprocal functions. In 1965, [[Wang Laboratories]] produced the LOCI-2, a 10-digit transistorized desktop calculator that used a Nixie tube display and could compute [[logarithm]]s. In the early days of binary vacuum-tube computers, their reliability was poor enough to justify marketing a mechanical octal version ("Binary Octal") of the Marchant desktop calculator. It was intended to check and verify calculation results of such computers. ==Advanced analog computers== {{Main|analog computer}} [[File:Cambridge differential analyser.jpg|thumb|Cambridge differential analyzer, 1938]] Before World War II, mechanical and electrical [[analog computer]]s were considered the "state of the art", and many thought they were the future of computing. Analog computers take advantage of the strong similarities between the mathematics of small-scale properties—the position and motion of wheels or the voltage and current of electronic components—and the mathematics of other physical phenomena, for example, ballistic trajectories, inertia, resonance, energy transfer, momentum, and so forth. They model physical phenomena with electrical [[voltage]]s and [[Electric current|currents]]<ref>{{harvnb|Chua|1971|pp=507–519}}</ref> as the analog quantities. Centrally, these analog systems work by creating electrical ''[[analogy|analog]]s'' of other systems, allowing users to predict behavior of the systems of interest by observing the electrical analogs.<ref> See, for example,{{harvnb|Horowitz|Hill|1989|pp=1–44}}</ref> The most useful of the analogies was the way the small-scale behavior could be represented with integral and differential equations, and could be thus used to solve those equations. An ingenious example of such a machine, using water as the analog quantity, was the [[water integrator]] built in 1928; an electrical example is the [[Mallock machine]] built in 1941. A [[planimeter]] is a device which does integrals, using [[distance]] as the analog quantity. Unlike modern digital computers, analog computers are not very flexible, and need to be rewired manually to switch them from working on one problem to another. Analog computers had an advantage over early digital computers in that they could be used to solve complex problems using behavioral analogues while the earliest attempts at digital computers were quite limited. Some of the most widely deployed analog computers included devices for aiming weapons, such as the [[Norden bombsight]]<ref>{{harvnb|Norden}}</ref> and the [[fire-control system]]s,<ref>{{harvnb|Singer|1946}}</ref> such as [[Arthur Pollen]]'s Argo system for naval vessels. Some stayed in use for decades after WWII; the [[Mark I Fire Control Computer]] was deployed by the [[United States Navy]] on a variety of ships from [[destroyer]]s to [[battleship]]s. Other analog computers included the [[Heathkit]] EC-1, and the hydraulic [[MONIAC Computer]] which modeled econometric flows.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips||}}</ref> The art of mechanical analog computing reached its zenith with the [[differential analyzer]],<ref>{{Fr}}{{harvnb|Coriolis|1836|pp=5–9}}</ref> built by H. L. Hazen and [[Vannevar Bush]] at [[MIT]] starting in 1927, which in turn built on the mechanical integrators invented in 1876 by [[James Thomson (engineer)|James Thomson]] and the torque amplifiers invented by H. W. Nieman. A dozen of these devices were built before their obsolescence was obvious; the most powerful was constructed at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s [[Moore School of Electrical Engineering]], where the [[ENIAC]] was built. Digital electronic computers like the ENIAC spelled the end for most analog computing machines, but hybrid analog computers, controlled by digital electronics, remained in substantial use into the 1950s and 1960s, and later in some specialized applications. But like all digital devices, the decimal [[precision (computer science)|precision]] of a digital device is a limitation, as compared to an analog device, in which the [[accuracy]] is a limitation.<ref>The [[Electronic noise|noise]] level, compared to the [[signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] level, is a fundamental factor, see for example {{harvnb|Davenport|Root|1958|pp=112–364}}.</ref> As [[electronics]] progressed during the 20th century, its problems of operation at low voltages while maintaining high [[signal-to-noise ratio]]s<ref>{{harvnb|Ziemer|Tranter|Fannin|1993|p=370}}.</ref> were steadily addressed, as shown below, for a digital circuit is a specialized form of analog circuit, intended to operate at standardized settings (continuing in the same vein, [[logic gate]]s can be realized as forms of digital circuits). But as digital computers have become faster and use larger memory (for example, [[Random Access Memory|RAM]] or internal storage), they have almost entirely displaced analog computers. [[Computer programming]], or coding, has arisen as another human profession. ==Electronic digital computation== [[File:Punched tape puncher.JPG|thumb|right|Friden paper tape punch. [[Punched tape]] programs would be much longer than the short fragment of yellow paper tape shown.]] The era of modern computing began with a flurry of development before and during World War II, as [[electronic circuit]] elements replaced mechanical equivalents, and digital calculations replaced analog calculations. Machines such as the [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]],
