database must be instantiated, along with its members, however, they maintain some principles of [[object-oriented programming]] (encapsulation and data abstraction), which other types of queries do not. ===CriteriaQuery=== A CriteriaQuery allow retrieval of objects by queries which compare object attributes. It's syntaxis is somewhat SQL-like.

The social sciences are big producers and consumers of statistical data. Surveys, censuses and opinion polls are basic sources of information for most quantitative research in [[sociology]] and [[economics]]. These data are collected and preserved by specialised data [[archives]], national statistical offices or private research institutes (e.g. [[Gallup poll]]) and traditionally disseminated to researchers (social researchers, journalists, marketing experts, etc.) as data files stored on some form of magnetic media and accompanied by bulky printed documentation (metadata). From the point of view of a researcher the current statistical data dissemination process is far from optimal. Given that there are many data publishers, each one with its own distinct access and dissemination procedures, it is often not easy to find and get hold of the right information. Also the artificial separation between statistical data and metadata complicates the assessment and processing of the information. In 1998 the European Union funded a research and development project named Networked Social Science Tools and Resources ([http://www.nesstar.org NESSTAR]). NESSTAR was funded by DGXIII of the [[European Commission]] under the 4th Framework Telematics Applications Program. The aim of the project was to bring the advantages of the Web to the world of statistical data dissemination. At the time the [[WWW]] had already made the publishing of textual and graphical information easier and cheaper than ever. A huge amount of information had been made available worldwide at a press of a button, at virtually no cost and in a highly integrated way. The question that NESSTAR was called to answer was if it was possible to create a ”Data Web” that would make just as easy to publish, locate and access statistical data. The NESSTAR project was followed by [http://www.exploit-lib.org/issue7/data/ FASTER], another European project that has further developed the Data Web concept and implementation. NESSTAR and FASTER were sufficiently successful to convince two of their main contractors, the [[UK Data Archive]] based at Essex University in England and the Norwegian Social Science Data Services ([http://www.nsd.uib.no NSD]) in Norway, to spin off a company to exploit commercially the Data Web technology. In 2006 the company underwent retrenchment back into its parent organisations. [http://www.nesstar.com Nesstar] is still developing Data Web solutions for a number of international clients and is currently working on a multi-lingual version.

The NetBSD project began as a result of frustration within the 386BSD developer community with the pace and direction of the operating system's development.<ref name="netbsd-hist">{{cite web|url=http://www.netbsd.org/about/history.html|title=The History of the NetBSD Project|work=www.netbsd.org|publisher=The NetBSD Foundation|accessdate=29 November 2009}}</ref> The four founders of the NetBSD project, Chris Demetriou, [[Theo de Raadt]], Adam Glass and Charles Hannum, felt that a more open development model would be beneficial to the project: one which was centered on portable, clean, correct code. Their aim was to produce a unified, multi-platform, production-quality, BSD-based operating system. The name "NetBSD" was suggested by de Raadt, based on the importance and [[Internet#Growth|growth of networks]] such as the [[Internet]] at that time, and the distributed, collaborative nature of its development.<ref name=netbsd-about/> The NetBSD source code repository was established on March 21, 1993 and the first official release, NetBSD 0.8, was made in April, 1993.<ref name="netbsd-0.8">{{cite newsgroup|url=http://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/misc/release/NetBSD/NetBSD-0.8|title=So you say you want an interim release of 386bsd?|author=Chris G.
