It is also intended to improve the quality and reproducibility of the research on code and architecture design, characterization and optimization. It includes [http://ctuning.org/cpredict online machine learning-based program optimization predictor] that can suggest profitable optimizations to improve program execution time/code size/compilation time, etc based on similarities between programs (program features).

The collective memory is shared, passed on and also constructed by the group, or modern society. The debate was taken up by [[Jan Assmann]], who wrote ''[[Das kulturelle Ged√§chtnis]]'' (''The Cultural Memory''). Assmann distinguishes between the [[Cultural memory]] and the Communicative memory, whereas the former fulfills a storage function and the latter the function of an everyday memory that is situated in the present. Scholars such as [[Paul Connerton]] have extended the concept to include the human body as a site for the collective processes of retention and propagation of memory. [[Pierre Nora]]'s contributions to the role of place and spaces of shared memory (the "lieux de memoire" that we all inhabit) are also significant. ==Collective Memory and Memorialization == The collective memory of a nation is represented in part by the memorials it chooses to erect. Public memory is enshrined in memorials from the newly opened [[Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe|Holocaust memorial]] in [[Berlin]] to the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] in [[Washington DC]]. Whatever a nation chooses to memorialize in physical monument, or perhaps more significantly, what not to memorialize, is an indicator of the collective memory. Collective memory is also sustained through a continuous production of representational forms. In our media age - and maybe particularly during the last decade of increasing digitization - this generates a flow of, and production of, second hand memories (see e.g. James E Young). Particular narratives and images are reproduced and reframed, yet also questioned and contested through new images and so forth. Collective memory today differs much from the collective memories of an oral culture, where no printing technique or transportation contributed to the production of imagined communities (see Benedict Anderson) where we come to share a sense of heritage and commonality with many human beings we have never met - as in the manner a citizen may feel a sort of 'kinship' with people of his nation, region or city. The concept of collective memory, initially developed by Halbwachs, has been explored and expanded from various angles - a few of these are introduced below. James E. Young has introduced the notion of 'collected memory' (opposed to collective memory), marking memory's inherently fragmented, collected and individual character, while Jan Assmann develops the notion of 'communicative memory', a variety of collective memory based on everyday communication. This form of memory is similar to the exchanges in an oral culture or the memories collected (and made collective) through oral history. As another subform of collective memories Assmann mentions forms detached from the everyday, it can be particular materialized and fixed points as, e.g. texts and monuments. The theory of collective memory was also discussed by ex-Hiroshima resident and atomic bomb survivor, Kiyoshi Tanimoto in his tour of the United States as an attempt to rally support and funding for the reconstruction of his Memorial Methodist Church in Hiroshima. He theorized that the use of the atomic bomb had forever been added to the world's collective memory and would serve in the future as a warning against such devices. See [[John Hersey]]'s [[Hiroshima]] novel. The idea was also discussed more recently in [[The Celestine Prophecy]] and subsequent novels written by [[James Redfield]] as a continuing process leading to the eventual trancendance of this plane of existence. The idea that a futuristic development of the [[collective unconscious]] and collective memories of society allowing for a medium with which one can transcend ones existence is an idea expressed in certain variations of [[new age]] religions. ==Collective memory in mass media== {{Globalize/USA|section|date=December 2010}} The arrival of [[film]] in the first half of the 20th century created many images, film scenes, news scenes, photographs, quotes, and songs, which became very familiar to regular moviegoers and remained in their collective memory. Examples could be the films of [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Rudolph Valentino]]. During cinema visits people could watch [[News Reel]]s who brought them news stories from over the world. For the first time in history a mass audience was able to view certain stories, events and scenes all at the same time. They could all view how for instance the [[Hindenburg disaster]] was caught on camera and see and remember these scenes all at once. When [[television]] became a global mass entertainment medium in the 1950s and 1960s the collective memory of former cinema visitors increased when various films could be repeated endlessly and worldwide on television broadcasts. For example old films
