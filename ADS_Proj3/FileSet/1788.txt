of Settlement. Even though Leibniz had done much to bring about this happy event, it was not to be his hour of glory. Despite the intercession of the Princess of Wales, Caroline of Ansbach, George I forbade Leibniz to join him in London until he completed at least one volume of the history of the Brunswick family his father had commissioned nearly 30 years earlier. Moreover, for George I to include Leibniz in his London court would have been deemed insulting to Newton, who was seen as having won the calculus priority dispute and whose standing in British official circles could not have been higher. Finally, his dear friend and defender, the dowager Electress Sophia, died in 1714. Leibniz died in [[Hanover]] in 1716: at the time, he was so out of favor that neither George I (who happened to be near Hanover at the time) nor any fellow courtier other than his personal secretary attended the funeral. Even though Leibniz was a life member of the Royal Society and the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy of Sciences]], neither organization saw fit to honor his passing. His grave went unmarked for more than 50 years. Leibniz was eulogized by [[Bernard de Fontenelle|Fontenelle]], before the Academie des Sciences in Paris, which had admitted him as a foreign member in 1700. The eulogy was composed at the behest of the [[Elizabeth Charlotte, Princess Palatine|Duchess of Orleans]], a niece of the Electress Sophia. Leibniz never married. He complained on occasion about money, but the fair sum he left to his sole heir, his sister's stepson, proved that the Brunswicks had, by and large, paid him well. In his diplomatic endeavors, he at times verged on the unscrupulous, as was all too often the case with professional diplomats of his day. On several occasions, Leibniz backdated and altered personal manuscripts, actions which put him in a bad light during the calculus controversy. On the other hand, he was charming, well-mannered, and not without humor and imagination;<ref>See Wiener IV.6 and Loemker § 40. Also see a curious passage titled "Leibniz's Philosophical Dream," first published by Bodemann in 1895 and translated on p. 253 of Morris, Mary, ed. and trans., 1934. ''Philosophical Writings''. Dent & Sons Ltd.</ref> He had many friends and admirers all over Europe. == Philosopher == Leibniz's philosophical thinking appears fragmented, because his philosophical writings consist mainly of a multitude of short pieces: journal articles, manuscripts published long after his death, and many letters to many correspondents. He wrote only two philosophical treatises, of which only the ''Théodicée'' of 1710 was published in his lifetime. Leibniz dated his beginning as a philosopher to his ''[[Discourse on Metaphysics]]'', which he composed in 1686 as a commentary on a running dispute between [[Nicolas Malebranche]] and [[Antoine Arnauld]]. This led to an extensive and valuable correspondence with Arnauld;<ref>Ariew & Garber, 69; Loemker, §§36, 38</ref> it and the ''Discourse'' were not published until the 19th century. In 1695, Leibniz made his public entrée into European philosophy with a journal article titled "New System of the Nature and Communication of Substances".<ref>Ariew & Garber, 138; Loemker, §47; Wiener, II.4</ref> Between 1695 and 1705, he composed his ''[[New Essays on Human Understanding]]'', a lengthy commentary on [[John Locke]]'s 1690 ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', but upon learning of Locke's 1704 death, lost the desire to publish it, so that the ''New Essays'' were not published until 1765. The ''[[Monadology|Monadologie]]'', composed in 1714 and published posthumously, consists of 90 aphorisms. Leibniz met [[Spinoza]] in 1676, read some of his unpublished writings, and has since been suspected of appropriating some of Spinoza's ideas. While Leibniz admired Spinoza's powerful intellect, he was also forthrightly dismayed by Spinoza's conclusions,<ref>Ariew & Garber, 272–84; Loemker, §§14, 20, 21; Wiener, III.8</ref> especially when these were inconsistent with Christian orthodoxy. Unlike Descartes and Spinoza, Leibniz had a thorough university education in philosophy. His lifelong [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] and [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] turn of mind betrayed the strong influence of one of his [[Leipzig]] professors, [[Jakob Thomasius]], who also supervised his BA thesis in philosophy. Leibniz also eagerly read [[Francisco Suárez]], a Spanish [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] respected even in [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] universities. Leibniz was deeply interested in the new methods and conclusions of Descartes, Huygens, Newton, and [[Robert Boyle|Boyle]], but viewed their work through a lens heavily tinted by scholastic notions. Yet it remains the case that Leibniz's methods and concerns often anticipate the [[logic]], and [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[linguistic philosophy]] of the 20th century. ===The Principles=== Leibniz variously invoked one or another of seven fundamental philosophical Principles:<ref>Mates (1986), chpts. 7.3, 9</ref> *[[Identity (mathematics)|Identity]]/[[contradiction]]. If a proposition is true, then its negation is false and vice versa. *[[Identity of indiscernibles]]. Two things are identical if and only if they share the same and only the same properties. Frequently invoked in modern logic and philosophy. The "identity of indiscernibles" is often referred to as Leibniz's Law. It has attracted the most controversy and criticism, especially from corpuscular philosophy and quantum mechanics. *[[principle of sufficient reason|Sufficient reason]]. "There must be a sufficient reason [often known only to God] for anything to exist, for any event to occur, for any truth to obtain."<ref>Loemker 717</ref> *[[Pre-established harmony]].<ref>See Jolley (1995: 129–31), Woolhouse and Francks (1998), and Mercer (2001).</ref> "[T]he appropriate nature of each substance brings it about that what happens to one corresponds to what happens to all the others, without, however, their acting upon one another directly." (''Discourse on Metaphysics'', XIV) A dropped glass shatters because it "knows" it has hit the ground, and not because the impact with the ground "compels" the glass to split. *[[Continuum mechanics|Continuity]]. ''Natura non saltum facit''. A mathematical analog to this principle would proceed as follows: if a [[function (mathematics)|function]] describes a [[Transformation (geometry)|transformation]] of something to which continuity applies, then its [[Domain (mathematics)|domain]] and [[range (mathematics)|range]] are both [[dense set]]s. *[[Optimism]]. "God assuredly always chooses the best."<ref>Loemker 311</ref> *[[Plenitude principle|Plenitude]]. "Leibniz believed that the best of all possible worlds would actualize every genuine possibility, and argued in [[Théodicée]] that this best
