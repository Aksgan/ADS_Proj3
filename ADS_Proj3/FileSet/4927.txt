1</math> linear precoding vector. From the fact that each Beam generated by ZF-precoding is orthogonal to all the other user channel vectors, we can rewrite the received signal as :<math>y_k = \mathbf{h}_k^T \sum_{i=1}^K s_i P_i \mathbf{w}_i+n_k = \mathbf{h}_k^T s_k P_k \mathbf{w}_k +n_k, \quad k=1,2, \ldots, K</math> For comparison purpose, we describe the received signal model for multiple antenna uplink systems. In the uplink system with a <math>N_r</math> receiver antenna AP and <math>K</math> K single transmit antenna user, the received signal at the AP is described as :<math>\mathbf{y} = \sum_{i=1}^{K} s_i \mathbf{h}_i + \mathbf{n}</math> where <math>s_i</math> is the transmitted signal of user <math>i</math>, <math>\mathbf{n}</math> is the <math>N_r \times 1</math> noise vector, <math>\mathbf{h}_k</math> is the <math>N_r \times 1</math> channel vector. ==== Quantify the feedback amount ==== Quantify the amount of the feedback resource required to maintain at least a given throughput performance gap between zero-forcing with perfect feedback and with limited feedback, i.e.,, :<math>\Delta R = R_{ZF} - R_{FB} \leq log_2 g</math>. Jindal showed that the required feedback bits of an [[Spatial Correlation|spatially uncorrelated]] channel should be scaled according to SNR of the downlink channel, which is given by<ref name="Jindal_ZF"/>: :<math> B = (M-1) \log_2 \rho_{b,m} - (M-1) \log_2 (g-1) </math> where ''M'', is the number of transmit antennas and <math>\rho_{b,m}</math> is SNR of the downlink channel. To feedback ''B'' bits though uplink channel, the throughput performance of the uplink channel should be larger than or equal to 'B' :<math> b_{FB} \log_2(1+\rho_{FB}) \geq B </math> where <math>b = \Omega_{FB} T_{FB}</math> is the feedback resource consisted by multiplying the feedback frequency resource and the frequency temporal resource subsequently and <math>\rho_{FB}</math> is SNR of the feedback channel. Then, the required feedback resource to satisfy <math>\Delta R \leq \log_2 g</math> is :<math> b_{FB} \geq \frac{B}{\log_2(1+\rho_{FB})} = \frac{(M-1) \log_2 \rho_{b,m} - (M-1) \log_2 (g-1)}{\log_2(1+\rho_{FB})} </math>. Note that differently from the feedback bits case, the required feedback resource is function of both downlink and uplink chanel conditions. It is reasonable to include the uplink channel status in the calcuration of the feedback resource since the uplink channel status determines the capacity, i.e., bits/second per unit frequency band (Hz), of the feedback link. Considedr a case when SNR of the downlink and uplink are proportion such that <math>\rho_{b,m} / \rho_{FB}) = C_{up,dn}</math> is constant and both SNRs are sufficiently high. Then, the feedback resource will be only proportion to the number of transmit antennas :<math> b_{FB,min}^* = \lim_{\rho_{FB} \to \infty } \frac{(M-1) \log_2 \rho_{b,m} - (M-1) \log_2 (g-1)}{\log_2(1+\rho_{FB})} = M - 1</math>. It follows the above equation that the feeback resource (<math>b_{FB}</math>) is not necessary to scale according to SNR of the downlink channel, which is almost contradict to the case of the feedback bits. We, hence, see that the whole systematic analysis can reverse the facts resulted from each reductioned situation. ==See also== * [[Channel state information]] * [[Precoding]] * [[MIMO]] ==References== {{reflist}} == External links == *[http://www.antenna-theory.com/arrays/weights/zeros.php Schelkunoff Polynomial Method (Null-Steering)] www.antenna-theory.com [[Category:IEEE 802]] [[Category:Information theory]] [[Category:Radio resource management]] [[Category:Signal processing]]</text> </page> <page> <id>41048</id> <title>Zero One Infinity</title> <text>{{Multiple issues|refimprove = November 2010|orphan = January 2010}} The '''Zero One or Infinity''' (ZOI) rule is a [[rule of thumb]] in [[software design]]. It suggests that arbitrary limits on the number of instances of a particular entity should not be allowed. Specifically, that an entity should either be forbidden entirely, one should be allowed, or any number (presumably, to the limit of available storage) of them should be allowed. It should not be the software that puts a hard limit on the number of instances of the entity. Examples of this rule may be found in file directories. The top-most directory has zero parent directories. Each subdirectory has exactly one parent directory. Each directory may contain an arbitrary number of files or subdirectories. An example of a violation of this rule is that some operating systems impose a hard limit of 65,536 files in a directory.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.linux.org/docs/ldp/howto/UMSDOS-HOWTO-9.html | title = UMSDOS-WHY-TO | work = Linux Online | accessdate = 5 January 2010}}</ref> A similar rule is mentioned in [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'' where it is asserted: "Two is an impossible number, and can't exist" referring to universes, deities, etc. ==In Popular Culture== The indie band [[Barcelona (band)|Barcelona]] has an album titled ''Zero One Infinity''. ==References== <references /> * {{cite web | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/Z/Zero-One-Infinity-Rule.html | title = Zero-One-Infinity Rule | work = [[Jargon File]]}} * {{cite web | url = http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ZeroOneInfinityRule | title = ZeroOneInfinityRule | work = [[C2]]}} [[Category:Software design]] [[Category:Programming rules of thumb]] [[de:Zero One Infinity]] [[he:אפס אחד אינסוף]]</text> </page> <page> <id>41053</id> <title>Zero flag</title> <text>The '''Zero Flag''' is a flag stored in the [[FLAGS register]] on all [[x86]] compatible [[CPU]]s.

A normal [[integrated circuit]] (IC) socket requires the IC to be pushed into sprung contacts which then grip by [[friction]]. For an IC with hundreds of pins, the total insertion force can be very large (tens of [[newton (unit)|newton]]s), leading to a danger of damage to the device or the PCB. Also even with relatively small pin counts each extraction is fairly awkward and carries a significant risk of bending pins (particularly if the person performing the extraction hasn't had much practice or the board is crowded). [[Low insertion force]] (LIF) sockets reduce the issues of insertion and extraction but the lower the insertion force of a conventional socket, the less reliable the connection is likely to be. With a ZIF socket, before the IC is inserted, a lever or slider on
