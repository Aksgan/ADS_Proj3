Administered under the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] (DND), it is charged with the duty of keeping track of foreign [[signals intelligence]] (SIGINT), and protecting Canadian government electronic information and communication networks. The CSEC is accountable to the [[Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Minister of National Defence]] through two deputy ministers, the [[National Security Advisor (Canada)|National Security Advisor to the Prime Minister]] is responsible for policy and operations while the Deputy Minister of National Defence is responsible for administration. The Minister of National Defence is in turn accountable to the [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]] and [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]]. ==History== The CSEC was established in 1946 as the Communications Branch of the [[National Research Council of Canada|National Research Council]] (CBNRC), and was transferred to the DND in 1975 by [[Order-in-Council]]. The origins of the CSEC can be traced back to the [[World War II|Second World War]] where the civilian organization worked with intercepted foreign electronic communications, collected largely from the [[Royal Canadian Corps of Signals|Canadian Signal Corps]] station at [[Ottawa/Rockcliffe Airport|Rockcliffe airport]] in Ottawa. CSEC also worked with CFS Leitrim, located just south of Ottawa, is Canada's oldest operational signal intelligence collection station. Established by the Royal Canadian Corps of Signals in 1941 as 1 Special Wireless Station and renamed Ottawa Wireless Station in 1949, CFS Leitrim acquired its current name when the Supplementary Radio System was created in 1966. In 1946, the station's complement was 75 personnel. The current strength (2005) is 450 military personnel and 28 civilian employees. This unit successfully decrypted, translated, and analyzed these foreign signals, and turned that raw information into useful intelligence reports during the course of the war. The CSEC and the information it gathered and shared was secret for 34 years, when the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] program ''[[The Fifth Estate]]'' did a story on the organization{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}, resulting in an outcry in the [[Canadian House of Commons]] and an admission by the Canadian government that the organization existed. The CSEC is now publicly known, and occupies several buildings in Ottawa, including the well-known [[Edward Drake Building]] and the neighbouring [[Sir Leonard Tilley Building]]. During the [[Cold War]], CSEC was primarily responsible for providing SIGINT data to the Department of National Defence regarding the [[military operation]]s of the [[Soviet Union]]. Since then, CSEC has diversified and now is the primary SIGINT resource in Canada. The CSEC also provides technical advice, guidance and services to the Government of Canada to maintain the security of its information and information infrastructures. In early 2008, in line with the [[Federal Identity Program]] (FIP) of the Government of Canada, which requires all federal agencies to have the word ''Canada'' in their name,<ref>[http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/fip-pcim/ Federal Identity Program - Programme de coordination de l'image de marque<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> CSE adopted the applied title ''Communications Security Establishment Canada'' (CSEC) or ({{lang-fr|Centre de la sécurité des télécommunications Canada}}) (CSTC). ==Role== Unique within Canada's security and intelligence community, the Communications Security Establishment Canada employs code-makers and code-breakers ([[cryptanalysis]]) to provide the Government of Canada with [[Information security|information technology security (IT Security)]] and foreign signals intelligence services. CSEC also provides technical and operational assistance to the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and federal law
