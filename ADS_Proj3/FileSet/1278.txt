and regulations. The process of using concept identifiers from an external open technical dictionary is a form of semantic encoding compliant with the requirements of [[ISO 8000]]-110:2008, the international standard for the exchange of quality master data. The eOTD concept identifiers are in the public domain. Using public domain identifiers as metadata creates portable data, data that can be legally separated from the software application that was used to create it. The dictionary contains concepts from international, national and industry standards including over 400,000 concepts of class (approved item name), property (attribute), units of measure, currency and common enumerated value (days of the week for example). The eOTD does not include a class hierarchy or class-property relationships. == Use == Companies use the eOTD to create data requirement specifications as Identification Guides( IG) or cataloging templates. These Identification Guides contain the class-property relationships and are used for cataloging, to measure data quality as well as to create requests for data or requests for data validation. == Industrial products and services categorization standards == * [[Eclass|eCl@ss]] * [[ETIM|ETIM (standard)]] * [[UNSPSC]] * eOTD * [[RosettaNet]] == See also == * [[Ontology (information science)]] == References == <references/> == Further reading == * De Jager, Salomon, "[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3766/is_200710/ai_n27997243/?tag=content;col1 Solving Data Quality Problems Using Data Standards]", ''Logistics Spectrum'', Oct.-Dec. 2007 * Radack, Gerald, "[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3766/is_200710/ai_n27997247/?tag=content;col1 ISO 22745: The Standard for Master Data]", ''Logistics Spectrum'', Oct.-Dec. 2007 == External links == * [http://www.eccma.org ECCMA] {{DEFAULTSORT:Eotd}} [[Category:Dictionaries]] [[Category:Classification systems]] {{standard-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>11469</id> <title>EPROM</title> <text>[[Image:Eprom.jpg|thumb|250px|An EPROM. The small quartz window admits UV light for erasure.]] {{Memory types}} An '''EPROM''' (rarely EROM), or '''erasable programmable [[read only memory]]''', is a type of memory [[integrated circuit|chip]] that retains its data when its power supply is switched off. In other words, it is [[non-volatile]]. It is an array of [[floating-gate transistor]]s individually programmed by an electronic device that supplies higher voltages than those normally used in digital circuits. Once programmed, an EPROM can be erased by exposing it to strong [[ultraviolet]] light from a mercury-vapor light source. EPROMs are easily recognizable by the transparent [[fused quartz]] window in the top of the package, through which the [[silicon]] chip is visible, and which permits exposure to [[UV light]] during erasing. ==Operation== Development of the EPROM memory cell started with investigation of faulty integrated circuits where the gate connections of transistors had broken. Stored charge on these isolated gates changed their properties. The EPROM was invented by [[Dov Frohman]] of [[Intel]] in 1971, who was awarded US patent 3660189 in 1972. [[Image:Floating gate transistor.png|thumb|A cross-section of a floating-gate transistor]] <!-- not quite the picture I want --> Each storage location of an EPROM consists of a single [[field-effect transistor]]. Each field-effect transistor consists of a channel in the semiconductor body of the device. Source and drain contacts are made to regions at the end of the channel. An insulating layer of oxide is grown over the channel, then a conductive (silicon or aluminum) gate electrode is deposited, and a further thick layer of oxide is deposited over the gate electrode. The [[floating gate]] electrode has no connections to other parts of the integrated circuit and is completely insulated by the surrounding layers of oxide. A control gate electrode is deposited and further oxide covers it. <ref> Chih-Tang Sah ,'' Fundamentals of solid-state electronics '' World Scientific, 1991 ISBN 9810206372, page 639 </ref> To retrieve data from the EPROM, the address represented by the values at the address pins of the EPROM is decoded and used to connect one word (usually an 8-bit byte) of storage to the output buffer amplifiers. Each bit of the word is a 1 or 0, depending on the storage transistor being switched on or off, conducting or non-conducting. The switching state of the field-effect transistor is controlled by the voltage on the control gate of the transistor. Presence of a voltage on this gate creates a conductive channel in the transistor, switching it on. In effect, the stored charge on the floating gate allows the threshold voltage of the transistor to be programmed. Storing data in the memory requires selecting a given address and applying a higher voltage to the transistors. This creates an avalanche discharge of electrons, which have enough energy to pass through the insulating oxide layer and accumulate on the gate electrode. When the high voltage is removed, the electrons are trapped on the electrode. <ref>Vojin G. Oklobdzija, ''Digital Design and Fabrication'', CRC Press, 2008 ISBN 0849386020, page 5-14 through 5-17 </ref> Because of the high insulation value of the silicon oxide surrounding the gate, the stored charge cannot readily leak away and the data can be retained for decades. Unlike [[EEPROM]]s, the programming process is not electrically reversible. To erase the data stored in the array of transistors, ultraviolet light is directed onto the [[Die_(integrated_circuit)|die]]. Photons of the UV light create ionization within the silicon oxide, which allow the stored charge on the floating gate to dissipate. Since the whole memory array is exposed, all the memory is erased at the same time. The process takes several minutes for UV lamps of convenient sizes; sunlight would erase a chip in weeks, and indoor [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lighting]] over several years. <ref> John E. Ayers ,''Digital integrated circuits: analysis and design'', CRC Press, 2004 , ISBN 084931951X, page 591 </ref> Generally the EPROMs must be removed from equipment to be erased, since it's not usually practical to build in a UV lamp to erase parts in-circuit. ==Details== As the quartz window is expensive to make, [[Programmable read-only memory|OTP]] (one-time programmable) chips were introduced; here, the die is mounted in an opaque package so it cannot be erased after programming - this also eliminates the need to test the erase function, further reducing cost. OTP versions of both EPROMs and EPROM-based microcontrollers are manufactured. However, OTP EPROM (whether separate or part of a larger chip) is being increasingly replaced by [[EEPROM]] for small amounts where the cell cost isn't too important and [[flash memory|flash]] for larger
