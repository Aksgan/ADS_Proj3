the center of the pinball machine, will turn green. When all letters are green the Von Helson Mansion will appear. Players must hit the ball into the form door of the Von Helson Mansion to play with in the mansion. Once inside the mansion players will need to try to spell the words VON HELSON, in order to spell the words, players must strike the individual letters with the pinball. Completing this task yields a high point pay out. ==Virtual Worlds== ===Towns=== Gaia Towns (often simply called Towns) is a virtual world where avatars may move and interact with each other. While in Towns users can pick up various items. Bugs, litter, and flowers can be collected while in towns, these items can later be made into other items for a small cost. Shaking trees, rocks, and shrubs can yield small amounts of gold to be collected.. Users may use a virtual chat system while in the towns. Homes can be found throughout Towns and more than one user can visit someone else's home. The towns often host events such as snowball fights and trick-or-treating. ===Sponsored Worlds=== Recently, Gaia has been implementing virtual worlds, similar to Towns, for various site sponsors. These have included a rainbow-styled world for a [[Skittles]] sponsor, a castle for an [[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]] film promotion, a large forest tree for the [[Legend of the Guardians]] film, among many others. Users can interact with certain NPCs in these areas, and are often awarded prizes for visiting these areas. ===Cinemas=== Gaia Cinemas was released in April 2007, and allows users to sit in a virtual theater, and watch anime, education shorts, TV shows, cartoons, etc. with other users. Users have the ability to throw temporary virtual items such as tomatoes, fireballs, popcorn, as well as other things during a cinema session. Programs shown in Gaia Cinemas are anime or cartoons shown with permission from Gaia Online's sponsors, films in the public domain, or films made by Gaia or by users. Gaia has old classic films as well as new anime in their theaters like [[Suzuka (manga)|Suzuka]] and [[Tsukuyomi -Moon Phase-|Moon Phase]]. In 2007, Gaia has created its own 3-D animated films, under the title of MMVII, that correlate with the Gaia [http://www.gaiaonline.com/news-and-events/ storyline]. Quest movies also take place in cinemas, when a user finishes watching a trailer for a movie they may receive a quest item. Gaia VJ is where users can make a virtual living room cinema with [[playlists]] composed of videos from video-hosting sites such as [[YouTube]]. In a recent [http://www.gaiaonline.com/forum/announcements/introducing-the-new-gaia-cinemas-new-movie-mondays/t.35417337/ announcement], Gaia announced a partnership with [[Sony]] and [[Time Warner]], allowing Gaia to screen films from their libraries, either for free, a one time gold fee, or a Gaia Cash [[rental]] fee. New films are released in Gaia Cinemas every Monday.<ref name="Sony">[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-146998422.html "Sony Pictures Television Partners with Gaia Online" - Wireless News]</ref> Due to lack of interest and inactivity, Gaia Cinemas no longer open to users for regular viewings, and is now only used to display film trailers, game trailers, and advertisements from site sponsors. Users are often awarded with sponsor-themed items from viewing the trailer or advertisement. ==References== {{Reflist|2}} ==External links== <!-- Please do not add Tektek or similar sites to the External links list without first discussing on talk page. --> * [http://www.gaiaonline.com/ Gaia Online] [[Category:Community websites]] [[Category:Entertainment websites]] [[Category:Fandom]] [[Category:Internet properties established in 2003]] [[Category:Internet forums]] [[Category:Virtual communities]] [[Category:Virtual economy]] [[Category:Virtual reality communities]] [[ar:غايا أونلاين]] [[bg:Gaia Online]] [[da:Gaia Online]] [[es:Gaia Online]] [[fa:گایا آنلاین]] [[fr:Gaia Online]] [[nl:Gaia Online]] [[ja:Gaia Online]] [[simple:Gaia Online]] [[fi:Gaia Online]] [[sv:Gaia Online]] [[th:ไกอา ออนไลน์]] [[vi:Gaia Online]]</text> </page> <page> <id>14695</id> <title>Gain scheduling</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}} In [[control theory]], '''gain scheduling''' is an approach to control of [[non-linear system]]s that uses a family of [[linear]] [[controller]]s, each of which provides satisfactory control for a different operating point of the system. One or more observable variables, called the scheduling variables, are used to determine what operating region the system is currently in and to enable the appropriate linear controller. For example in an aircraft [[flight control system]], the [[altitude]] and [[Mach number]] might be the scheduling variables, with different linear controller parameters available (and automatically plugged into the controller) for various combinations of these two variables. It is one of the simplest and most intuitive forms of [[adaptive control]]. {{DEFAULTSORT:Gain Scheduling}} [[Category:Nonlinear control]] [[Category:Control theory]] [[Category:Control engineering]] [[Category:Classical control]] [[ar:غاين سكاديولينغ]] [[es:Planificación de ganancias]] [[fr:Séquencement de gain]] [[it:Gain scheduling]]</text> </page> <page> <id>14702</id> <title>Galahad library</title> <text>The '''Galahad library''' is a thread-safe [[library]] of packages for the solution of [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]]—or [[mathematical programming]]—problems. The areas covered by the library are unconstrained and bound-constrained optimization, [[quadratic programming]], [[nonlinear programming]], systems of nonlinear equations and inequalities, and nonlinear [[least squares]] problems. The library is mostly written in the [[Fortran|Fortran 90]] programming language. The name of the library originates from its major package for general [[nonlinear programming]], LANCELOT-B, the successor of the original augmented lagrangian package LANCELOT of Conn, Gould and Toint [1]. Other packages in the library include * a filter-based method for systems of linear and nonlinear equations and inequalities, * an active-set method for nonconvex [[quadratic programming]], * a primal-dual interior-point method for nonconvex [[quadratic programming]], * a presolver for quadratic programs, * a [[Lanczos]] method for trust-region subproblems, * an interior-point method to solve [[linear programming|linear programs]] or separable [[convex optimization|convex programs]] or alternatively, to compute the analytic center of a set defined by such constraints, if it exists. Packages in the GALAHAD library accept problems modeled in either the [http://www.numerical.rl.ac.uk/lancelot/sif/sifhtml.html Standard Input Format] (SIF) or the [[AMPL|AMPL modeling language]]. For problems modeled in the SIF, the GALAHAD library naturally relies upon the [[CUTEr]] package, an optimization toolbox providing all low-level functionalities required by solvers. The library is available on several popular computing platforms, including Compaq (DEC) Alpha, Cray, HP, IBM RS/6000, Intel-like PCs, SGI and Sun. It is designed to be easily adapted to other platforms. Support is provided for many operating systems, including [[Digital UNIX]], [[Tru64 UNIX]],
