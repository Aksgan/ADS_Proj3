name="Regedit">[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/141377 Differences between Regedit.exe and Regedt32.exe]</ref> REGEDIT has been directly ported from [[Windows 98]], and therefore does not support editing registry permissions.<ref name="Regedit" /> REGEDT32 has the older multiple document interface (MDI) and can edit registry permissions in the same manner that Windows NT's REGEDT32 program could. REGEDIT has a left-side [[tree view]] of the [[Windows registry]], lists all loaded [[Windows Registry#Hives|hives]] and represents the three components of a value (its name, type, and data) as separate columns of a table. REGEDT32 has a left-side tree view, but each hive has its own window, so the tree displays only keys and it represents values as a list of strings. REGEDIT supports right-clicking of entries in a tree view to adjust properties and other settings. REGEDT32 requires all actions to be performed from the top [[menu bar]]. [[Windows XP]] is the first system to integrate these two programs into a single utility, adopting the REGEDIT behavior with the additional NT features.<ref name="Regedit" /> The [[System File Checker]] (SFC) also comes with Windows 2000. It is a [[command line]] utility that scans system files and verifies whether they were signed by Microsoft and works in conjunction with the [[Windows File Protection]] mechanism. It can also repopulate and repair all the files in the ''Dllcache'' folder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/222471|title=Microsoft KB article 222471: Description of the Windows 2000 System File Checker (Sfc.exe) }}</ref> === Recovery Console === [[Image:Windows 2000 Recovery Console.png|thumb|The Recovery Console is usually used to recover unbootable systems.]] {{main|Recovery Console}} The [[Recovery Console]] is run from outside the installed copy of Windows to perform maintenance tasks that can neither be run from within it nor feasibly be run from another computer or copy of Windows 2000.<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/229716 Description of the Windows 2000 Recovery Console]</ref> It is usually used to recover the system from problems that cause booting to fail, which would render other tools useless. It has a simple [[command line]] interface, used to check and repair the hard drive(s) , repair boot information (including [[NTLDR]]) , replace corrupted system files with fresh copies from the CD, or enable/disable services and drivers for the next boot. The console can be accessed in either of the two ways: #Booting from the Windows 2000 CD, and choosing to start the Recovery Console from the CD itself instead of continuing with setup. The Recovery Console is accessible as long as the installation CD is available. #Preinstalling the Recovery Console on the hard disk as a startup option in <tt>[[NTLDR#boot.ini|Boot.ini]]</tt>, via WinNT32.exe, with the /cmdcons switch.<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/216417 How to install the Windows Recovery Console]</ref> In this case, it can only be started as long as [[NTLDR]] can boot from the [[System partition and boot partition|system partition]]. === Server family features === The Windows 2000 server family consists of Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Advanced Server, and Windows 2000 Datacenter Server. All editions of Windows 2000 Server have the following services and features built in: *Routing and [[Remote Access Service]] (RRAS) support, facilitating [[Dial-up access|dial-up]] and [[Virtual Private Network|VPN]] connections using [[IPsec]], [[L2TP]] or [[L2TP#L2TP/IPsec|L2TP/IPsec]], support for [[RADIUS]] authentication in [[Internet Authentication Service]], network connection sharing, [[Network Address Translation]], [[unicast]] and [[multicast]] [[routing]] schemes. * Remote access security features: Remote Access Policies for setup, verify Caller ID (IP address for VPNs), callback and Remote access account lockout <ref>[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc958001.aspx Elements of Secure Remote Access]</ref> * Autodial by location feature using the ''Remote Access Auto Connection Manager'' [[Windows service|service]] * [[Extensible Authentication Protocol]] support in [[Internet Authentication Service|IAS]] (EAP-MD5 and EAP-TLS) later upgraded to PEAPv0/EAP-MSCHAPv2 and PEAP-EAP-TLS in Windows 2000 SP4 *[[Microsoft DNS|DNS]] server, including support for [[Dynamic DNS]]. [[Active Directory]] relies heavily on DNS. *[[IPsec]] support and TCP/IP filtering *[[Smart card]] support *Microsoft Connection Manager Administration Kit (CMAK) and Connection Point Services *Support for [[Distributed File System (Microsoft)|distributed file systems]] (DFS) *[[Hierarchical Storage Management]] support including remote storage,<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/317369 How to use Remote Storage in Windows 2000 Server]</ref> a service that runs with [[NTFS]] and automatically transfers files that are not used for some time to less expensive storage media *[[Fault-tolerant design|Fault tolerant]] volumes, namely [[Redundant array of independent disks#RAID 1|Mirrored]] and [[Redundant array of independent disks#RAID 5|RAID-5]] *[[Group Policy]] (part of [[Active Directory]]) *''IntelliMirror'', a collection of technologies for fine-grained [[Systems management|management]] of Windows 2000 Professional clients that duplicates users' data, applications, files, and settings in a centralized location on the network. IntelliMirror employs technologies such as [[Group Policy]], [[Windows Installer]], [[Roaming profile]]s, [[Folder redirection|Folder Redirection]], ''Offline Files'' (also known as ''Client Side Caching'' or CSC), [[File Replication Service]] (FRS), Remote Installation Services (RIS) to address desktop management scenarios such as user data management, user settings management, software installation and maintenance. *[[COM+]], [[Microsoft Transaction Server]] and [[Distributed Transaction Coordinator]] *[[Microsoft Message Queuing|MSMQ 2.0]] *[[Telephony Application Programming Interface|TAPI]] 3.0 *[[Integrated Windows Authentication]] (including [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]], Secure channel and [[SPNEGO]] (Negotiate) SSP packages for [[Security Support Provider Interface]] (SSPI)). *[[MS-CHAP]] v2 protocol *[[Public Key Infrastructure]] (PKI) and [[Certificate authority|Enterprise Certificate Authority]] support *[[Terminal Services]] and support for the [[Remote Desktop Protocol]] (RDP) *[[Internet Information Services]] (IIS) 5.0 and [[Windows Media Services]] 4.1 *Network [[Quality of Service]] features <ref>[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb742478.aspx An Overview of Windows 2000 Quality of Service]</ref> *A new ''Windows Time service'' which is an implementation of [[Simple Network Time Protocol]] (SNTP) as detailed in IETF RFC 1769.

Windows 2000 Professional includes an SNTP client. [[Image:Windows 2000 Server.png|thumb|right|Screenshot of Windows 2000 Server]] The Server editions include more features and components, including the Microsoft Distributed File System (DFS) , Active Directory support and fault-tolerant storage. ==== Distributed File System ==== {{main|Distributed File System (Microsoft) }} The Distributed File System (DFS) allows [[Server Message Block|shares]] in multiple different locations to be logically grouped under one folder, or ''DFS root''.
