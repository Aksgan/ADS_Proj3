The concept is to start assuming that every state may be able to combine with every other state, then separate distinguishable states into separate groups called '''equivalence partitions'''. When no more equivalence partitions contain distinguishable states, the states remaining in the same group as other states are can be combined. Equivalence partitions are numbered by the number of steps it took to get to that point. The 0<sup>th</sup> partition contains all the states in one group, the 1<sup>st</sup> partition contains states grouped by their [[output]]s only. Every partition from then on has groupings that are based on which group from the previous partition those states' next state fell under. The procedure is complete when partition ''n'' is the same as partition <math>n+1</math>. States that are distinguishable on the ''k''<sup>th</sup> partition are called '''''k''-distinguishable''' states. States that are in the same group on the ''k''<sup>th</sup> partition are called '''''k''-equivalent'''. Note that states that are ''k''-equivalent at one point are not necessarily equivalent states, as they may be separated into separate groups in a higher partition. The procedure is as follows: # separate states into groups that have the same immediate output for the same current input, # distinguish states whose next state(s) are in different groups. # regroup the states and repeat the above step until no more states are distinguishable. ==See also== *[[Implication table]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Moore Reduction Procedure}} [[Category:Automata theory]] {{Formalmethods-stub}} [[hr:Minimizacija konačnog automata]]</text> </page> <page> <id>25086</id> <title>Moral graph</title> <text>A '''moral graph''' is a concept in [[graph theory]], used to find the equivalent undirected form of a [[directed acyclic graph]]. It is a key step of the [[junction tree algorithm]], used in [[belief propagation]] on [[graphical models]]. The '''moralized''' counterpart of a directed acyclic graph is formed by connecting nodes that have a common child, and then making all edges in the graph undirected. The name stems from the fact the two nodes that have a common child are said to be ''married''. Equivalently, a moral graph of a directed acyclic graph ''G'' is an undirected graph in which each node of the original ''G'' is now connected to its [[Markov blanket]].
