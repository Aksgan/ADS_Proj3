application for creating complete or partial screenshots quickly, including annotations, highlighting, and obfuscation of parts of the screenshot, and saving the screenshot to a file, the clipboard, a printer or as e-mail attachment. * [[Lightscreen]] - Lightweight [[free software]] application. It operates as a hidden background process that is invoked with one (or multiple) hotkeys and then saves a screenshot file to disk according to the user's preferences. {{See also|Category:Screenshot software}} === Microsoft Windows and Mac OSX === * [[Jing_(software)|Jing]] - Free software that allows creation and annotation of still screenshots and screen videos with audio. Uploads file to the web for easy sharing or can be saved locally. Optional paid version is not required. ==Common technical issues== === Hardware overlays === On Windows systems, screenshots of games and media players sometimes fail, resulting in a blank rectangle. The reason for this is that the graphics are bypassing the normal screen and going to a high-speed graphics processor on the [[graphics card]] by using a method called [[hardware overlay]]. Generally, there is no way to extract a computed image back out of the graphics card, though software may exist for special cases or specific video cards. One way these images can be captured is to turn off the hardware overlay. Because many computers have no hardware overlay, most programs are built to work without it, just a little slower. In Windows XP, this is disabled by opening the Display Properties menu, clicking on the "Settings" tab, clicking, "Advanced", "Troubleshoot", and moving the Hardware Acceleration Slider to "None." [[Free software]] media players may also use the overlay, but often have a setting to avoid that, or dedicated screenshot functions. Mac OS X DVD player deactivates the built-in screenshot feature, but it is still possible to capture the image or the video with third party software, or by using the "screencapture" command in the terminal. === Screen recording === The screen recording capability of some screen capture programs is a time-saving way to create instructions and presentations, but the resulting files are often large. A common problem with video recordings is the action jumps, instead of flowing smoothly, due to low [[frame rate]]. Though getting faster all the time, ordinary PCs are not yet fast enough to play videos and simultaneously capture them at professional frame rates, ''i.e.'' 30 frame/s. For many cases, high frame rates are not required. This is not generally an issue if simply capturing desktop video, which requires far less processing power than video playback, and it is very possible to capture at 30 frame/s. This of course varies depending on desktop resolution, processing requirements needed for the application that is being captured, and many other factors. ==Copyright issues== Some companies believe the use of screenshots is an [[Copyright infringement|infringement of copyright]] on their program, as it is a [[derivative work]] of the [[GUI widget|widgets]] and other art created for the software.<ref>{{Cite web | title = Screen Shots (Excluding Xbox) | work = Use of Microsoft Copyrighted Content | accessdate = 2007-08-22 | url = http://www.microsoft.com/about/legal/permissions//default.mspx#E3C }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | title = Question: What are screenshots, and is using them copyright infringement? | work = FAQ about Copyright -- [[Chilling Effects (group)|Chilling Effects]] Clearinghouse | accessdate = 2007-08-22 | url = http://www.chillingeffects.org/copyright/faq.cgi#QID809 }}</ref> Regardless of copyright, screenshots may still be legally used under the principle of [[fair use]] in the U.S. or [[fair dealing]] and similar laws in other countries.<ref>{{Cite web | title = Copyright in screenshots?

The source of the [[interpreter]] is available as a [[C (programming language)| C program]] under the [[GNU Lesser General Public License|LGPL]] license. ScriptBasic generates intermediary code which is then interpreted by a runtime environment. ScriptBasic is available for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Unix]] and Mac OS X and may be embedded in other programs as well. It can create standalone [[executable]] files. A runtime library is linked into the executable. It is available in precompiled binaries (setup.exe under Windows and uninstall also supported), [[dpkg]] and [[RPM Package Manager|rpm]] for [[Linux]] and in source code form. The language, the interpreter is fully documented in the Users' Guide available in text, [[HTML]], [[CHM]], [[TeX]], [[texi]] and [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] formats. ScriptBasic has been developed since 1999 and has reached a fairly matured state in terms of functions and stability. The precompiled version available for Windows and Linux includes a [[command line]] version and a standalone [[web server]]. This BASIC can be the choice for developers, who seek a BASIC variant that runs on UNIX as well as under Windows and Mac OS X (Intel). The Basic is embeddable with an option to compile your applications to a small footprint executable. ScriptBasic has an open interface for module developers. There are several external modules developed by the developer of ScriptBasic as well as by other developers. These include data base connection handling for various [[RDBMS|database]] systems ([[MySQL]], [[PostgreSQL]], [[ODBC]], [[Berkeley DB]] and others), binding to the library [[CURL]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] graphics, [[GTK+]] [[graphical user interface]], [[Internet socket|sockets]], [[regular expression]]s, [[thread
