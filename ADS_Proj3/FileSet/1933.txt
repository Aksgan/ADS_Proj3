Military historians record the events of military history. ===Social history=== {{Main|Social history}} [[Social history (social science)|Social history]] is the study of how societies adapt and change over periods of time. Social history is an area of historical study considered by some to be a [[social science]] that attempts to view historical evidence from the point of view of developing social trends. In this view, it may include areas of [[economic history]], [[legal history]] and the analysis of other aspects of [[civil society]] that show the evolution of social norms, behaviors and more. ===Cultural history=== {{Main|Cultural history}} Cultural history replaced [[social history]] as the dominant form in the 1980s and 1990s. It typically combines the approaches of anthropology and history to look at language, popular cultural traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience. It examines the records and narrative descriptions of past knowledge, customs, and arts of a group of people. How peoples constructed their memory of the past is a major topic. ===Diplomatic history=== {{Main|Diplomatic history}} [[Diplomatic history]], sometimes referred to as "''Rankian History''"<ref>Burke, P. (1998). New perspectives on historical writing. University Park, Pa: [[Pennsylvania State University Press]].

Individuals not included in the past in other type of writing about history are part of this theory's primary focus, which includes the [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]], the [[oppression|oppressed]], the [[poverty|poor]], the [[Nonconformism|nonconformists]], and the otherwise forgotten people. This theory also usually focuses on events occurring in the fullness of time, or when an overwhelming wave of smaller events cause certain developments to occur. ===Gender history=== {{Main|Gender history}} [[Gender history]] is a sub-field of History and [[Gender studies]], which looks at the past from the perspective of [[gender]]. It is in many ways, an outgrowth of [[women's history]]. Despite its relatively short life, Gender History (and its forerunner Women's History) has had a rather significant effect on the general study of history. Since the 1960s, when the initially small field first achieved a measure of acceptance, it has gone through a number of different phases, each with its own challenges and outcomes. Although some of the changes to the study of history have been quite obvious, such as increased numbers of books on famous women or simply the admission of greater numbers of women into the historical profession, other influences are more subtle. ===Public history=== {{Main|Public history}} [[Public history]] is a term that describes the broad range of activities undertaken by people with some training in the
