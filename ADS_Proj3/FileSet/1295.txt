assessment might be a teacher (or [[peer group|peer]]) or the learner, providing feedback on a student's work, and would not necessarily be used for grading purposes. Formative assessments are diagnostic. Educational researcher [http://www.ed.uiuc.edu/circe/Robert_Stake.html Robert Stake] explains the difference between formative and summative assessment with the following analogy: {{cquote|When the cook tastes the soup, that's formative. When the guests taste the soup, that's summative.<ref name="Stake in Scriven">Scriven, M. (1991). Evaluation thesaurus. 4th ed. Newbury Park, CA:[[Sage Publications]]. ISBN 0-8039-4364-4.</ref>}} Summative and formative assessment are often referred to in a learning context as ''assessment of learning'' and ''assessment for learning'' respectively. Assessment of learning is generally summative in nature and intended to measure learning outcomes and report those outcomes to students, parents, and administrators. Assessment of learning generally occurs at the conclusion of a class, course, semester, or academic year. Assessment for learning is generally formative in nature and is used by teachers to consider approaches to teaching and next steps for individual learners and the class.<ref name="Earl, Lorna">Earl, Lorna (2003).

Diagnostic assessment measures a student's current knowledge and skills for the purpose of identifying a suitable program of learning. ''Self-assessment'' is a form of diagnostic assessment which involves students assessing themselves. ''Forward-looking assessment'' asks those being assessed to consider themselves in hypothetical future situations.<ref name="Diagnostic assessment">Reed, Daniel.

It is often aligned with the [[standards-based education reform]] and [[outcomes-based education]] movement. Though ideally they are significantly different from a traditional multiple choice test, they are most commonly associated with [[standards-based assessment]] which use free-form responses to standard questions scored by human scorers on a standards-based scale, meeting, falling below, or exceeding a performance standard rather than being ranked on a curve. A well-defined task is identified and students are asked to create, produce, or do something, often in settings that involve real-world application of knowledge and skills. Proficiency is demonstrated by providing an extended response. Performance formats are further differentiated into products and performances. The performance may result in a product, such as a painting, portfolio, paper, or exhibition, or it may consist of a performance, such as a speech, athletic skill, musical recital, or reading. ===Objective and subjective=== Assessment (either summative or formative) is often categorized as either objective or subjective. Objective assessment is a form of questioning which has a single correct answer. Subjective assessment is a form of questioning which may have more than one correct answer (or more than one way of expressing the correct answer). There are various types of objective and subjective questions. Objective question types include true/false answers, [[multiple choice]], multiple-response and matching questions. Subjective questions include extended-response questions and essays. Objective assessment is well suited to the increasingly popular computerized or [[e-assessment|online assessment]] format. Some have argued that the distinction between objective and subjective assessments is neither useful nor accurate because, in reality, there is no such thing as "objective" assessment. In fact, all assessments are created with inherent biases built into decisions about relevant subject matter and content, as well as cultural (class, ethnic, and gender) biases.<ref name="Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC)">Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC).

Criterion-referenced assessment is often, but not always, used to establish a person's competence (whether s/he can do something). The best known example of criterion-referenced assessment is the driving test, when learner drivers are measured against a range of explicit criteria (such as "Not endangering other road users"). ''Norm-referenced assessment'' (colloquially known as "[[Bell curve grading|grading on the curve]]"), typically using a [[norm-referenced test]], is not measured against defined criteria. This type of assessment is relative to the student body undertaking the assessment. It is effectively a way of comparing students. The IQ test is the best known example of norm-referenced assessment. Many entrance tests (to prestigious schools or universities) are norm-referenced, permitting a fixed proportion of students to pass ("passing" in this context means being accepted into the school or university rather than an explicit level of ability). This means that standards may vary from year to year, depending on the quality of the cohort; criterion-referenced assessment does not vary from year to year (unless the criteria change).<ref name="VirginiaTech">Educational Technologies at Virginia Tech.

Formal assessment usually implies a written document, such as a test, quiz, or paper. A formal assessment is given a numerical score or grade based on student performance, whereas an informal assessment does not contribute to a student's final grade. An informal assessment usually occurs in a more casual manner and may include observation, inventories, checklists, rating scales, [[rubric (academic)|rubrics]], performance and portfolio assessments, participation, peer and self evaluation, and discussion.<ref name="Valencia, Sheila W">Valencia, Sheila W.

External assessment is set by the governing body, and is marked by non-biased personnel. With external assessment, students only receive a mark.
