Navier–Stokes equations seem to model fluid motion accurately; even turbulent flows seem (on average) to agree with real world observations. The Navier–Stokes equations assume that the fluid being studied is a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]] not moving at [[Special relativity#Relativistic mechanics|relativistic velocities]]. At very small scales or under extreme conditions, real fluids made out of discrete molecules will produce results different from the continuous fluids modeled by the Navier–Stokes equations. Depending on the [[Knudsen number]] of the problem, [[statistical mechanics]] or possibly even [[molecular dynamics]] may be a more appropriate approach. Another limitation is very simply the complicated nature of the equations. Time tested formulations exist for common fluid families, but the application of the Navier–Stokes equations to less common families tends to result in very complicated formulations which are an area of current research. For this reason, these equations are usually written for [[Newtonian fluid]]s. Studying such fluids is "simple" because the viscosity model ends up being [[linear]]; truly general models for the flow of other kinds of fluids (such as blood) do not, as of 2011, exist. ==Derivation and description== {{Main|Derivation of the Navier–Stokes equations}} The derivation of the Navier–Stokes equations begins with an application of [[Newton's second law]]: conservation of momentum (often alongside mass and energy conservation) being written for an arbitrary portion of the fluid. In an [[inertial frame of reference]], the general form of the equations of fluid motion is:<ref>Batchelor (1967) pp. 137 & 142.</ref> :<math> \rho \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v} \right) = -\nabla p + \nabla \cdot\mathbb{T} + \mathbf{f},</math> where <math>\mathbf{v}</math> is the flow velocity, <math>\rho</math> is the fluid density, ''p'' is the pressure, <math>\mathbb{T}</math> is the ([[Stress (physics)#Stress deviator tensor|deviatoric]]) stress [[tensor field|tensor]], and <math>\mathbf{f} </math> represents [[body force]]s (per unit volume) acting on the fluid and <math>\nabla</math> is the [[del]] operator. This is a statement of the conservation of momentum in a fluid and it is an application of Newton's second law to a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]]; in fact this equation is applicable to any non-relativistic continuum and is known as the [[Cauchy momentum equation]]. This equation is often written using the [[substantive derivative]] ''D'''''v'''/''Dt'', making it more apparent that this is a statement of Newton's second law: :<math>\rho \frac{D \mathbf{v}}{D t} = -\nabla p + \nabla \cdot\mathbb{T} + \mathbf{f}.</math> The left side of the equation describes acceleration, and may be composed of time dependent or convective effects (also the effects of non-inertial coordinates if present). The right side of the equation is in effect a summation of body forces (such as gravity) and divergence of [[Stress (physics)|stress]] (pressure and shear stress). ===Convective acceleration=== [[Image:ConvectiveAcceleration.png|thumb|An example of convection. Though the flow may be steady (time independent), the fluid decelerates as it moves down the diverging duct (assuming incompressible flow), hence there is an acceleration happening over position.]] A very significant feature of the Navier–Stokes equations is the presence of convective acceleration: the effect of time independent acceleration of a fluid with respect to space. While individual fluid particles are indeed experiencing time dependent acceleration, the convective acceleration of the flow field is a spatial effect, one example being fluid speeding up in a nozzle. Convective acceleration is represented by the [[nonlinear]] quantity: :<math>\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v},</math> which may be interpreted either as <math>(\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla)\,\mathbf{v}</math> or as <math>\mathbf{v}\cdot(\nabla\mathbf{v}),</math> with <math>\nabla \mathbf{v}</math> the [[tensor derivative]] of the velocity vector <math>\mathbf{v}.</math> Both interpretations give the same result, independent of the coordinate system — provided <math>\nabla</math> is interpreted as the [[covariant derivative]].<ref name=Emanuel>{{Citation | last=Emanuel | first=G. | title=Analytical fluid dynamics | publisher=CRC Press | year=2001 | edition=second | isbn=0849391148 }} pp. 6–7.</ref> ====Interpretation as (v·&nabla;)v==== The convection term is often written as :<math>(\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{v},</math> where the [[advection|advection operator]] <math>\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla</math> is used. Usually this representation is preferred because it is simpler than the one in terms of the tensor derivative <math>\nabla \mathbf{v}.</math><ref name=Emanuel/> ====Interpretation as v·(&nabla;v)==== Here <math>\nabla \mathbf{v}</math> is the tensor derivative of the velocity vector, equal in Cartesian coordinates to the component by component gradient. The convection term may, by a [[vector calculus identities#Vector dot product|vector calculus identity]], be expressed without a tensor derivative:<ref>See Batchelor (1967), §3.5, p. 160.</ref><ref>{{Citation | url = http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConvectiveDerivative.html | title = Convective Derivative | author = [[Eric W. Weisstein]] | publisher = [[MathWorld]] | accessdate = 2008-05-20 }}</ref> :<math>\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v} = \nabla \left( \frac{\|\mathbf{v}\|^2}{2} \right) + \left( \nabla \times \mathbf{v} \right) \times \mathbf{v}.</math> The form has use in irrotational flow, where the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of the velocity (called [[vorticity]]) <math>\omega=\nabla \times \mathbf{v}</math> is equal to zero. Regardless of what kind of fluid is being dealt with, convective acceleration is a [[nonlinear]] effect. Convective acceleration is present in most flows (exceptions include one-dimensional incompressible flow), but its dynamic effect is disregarded in [[creeping flow]] (also called Stokes flow) . ===Stresses===<!--Lift (force) has a wikilink to here--> The effect of [[Stress (physics)|stress]] in the fluid is represented by the <math>\scriptstyle \nabla p</math> and <math>\scriptstyle \nabla \cdot\mathbb{T}</math> terms; these are gradients of surface forces, analogous to stresses in a solid. <math>\scriptstyle \nabla p</math> is called the pressure gradient and arises from the isotropic part of the stress [[tensor]]. This part is given by [[normal stress]]es that turn up in almost all situations, dynamic or not. The anisotropic part of the stress tensor gives rise to <math>\scriptstyle \nabla \cdot\mathbb{T}</math>, which conventionally describes viscous forces; for incompressible flow, this is only a shear effect. Thus, <math>\scriptstyle \mathbb{T}</math> is the [[deviatoric stress tensor]], and the stress tensor is equal to:<ref>Batchelor (1967) p. 142.</ref> :<math>\sigma = -p\mathbb{I} + \mathbb{T}</math> where <math>\scriptstyle \mathbb{I}</math> is the 3×3 [[identity matrix]]. Interestingly, only the ''gradient'' of pressure matters, not the pressure itself. The effect of the pressure gradient is that fluid flows from high pressure to low pressure. The stress terms ''p'' and <math>\scriptstyle \mathbb{T}</math> are yet unknown, so the general form of the equations of motion is not usable to solve problems. Besides the equations of motion—Newton's second law—a force model is needed relating the stresses to the fluid motion.<ref>{{citation | first1=Richard P.
