on Foreign Relations]]. He is credited with coining the term [[cyberinfrastructure]] and has worked closely with [[Richard A. Clarke]] on [[cyberterrorism]] issues. Hunker's research is primarily concerned with Homeland and Information Security. Prof. Hunker has also been the Carnegie Mellon Representation for the [[Institute for Information Infrastructure Protection]]. In 2008 Hunker was charged three times with [[driving under the influence]] ([http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08240/907173-53.stm]), followed by another incident on Thanksgiving 2009. In May 2010 Hunker pleaded guilty to these four drunken driving charges and was sentenced to 3 to 6 months in jail ([http://www.thepittsburghchannel.com/news/22599352/detail.html]). He was paroled at sentencing and currently is serving 24 months probation.([http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/s_680998.html]) In 2010 Dr. Hunker released the book [[Creeping Failure: How We Broke the Internet and What We Can Do to Fix It]]([ http://www.mcclelland.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780771041488]}published by McClelland and Stewart, a division of Random House([http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780771041488]). Creeping Failure is a Scientific American magazine Recommended Book ([http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=recommended-nov-10]). Also in 2010 he was co-editor of Insider Threats in Cyber Security ([http://www.docstoc.com/docs/50872833/Insider-Threats-in-Cyber-Security]) and his article (co-authored with Christian Probst)The Risk of Risk Analysis and its Relation to the Economics of Insider Threats appears in The Economics of Information Security and Privacy ([http://www.springerlink.com/content/wt54g6h3821g886g/]).

Born in [[Brooklyn]], Buzen received a [[Bachelor of Science|Sc.B.]] in [[applied mathematics]] from [[Brown University]] (1965), and at [[Harvard University]] received a [[Master of Science|M.Sc.]] (1966) and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] (1971). He was a systems programmer at the [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] in [[Bethesda, MD]] (1967â€“69), studying the performance of realtime systems, which led to his first publication in a 1969 IEEE conference.<ref>[http://www.cmg.org/measureit/issues/mit11/m_11_1.html Computer Measurement Group ''Casual Day with Jeff Buzen'']</ref> From 1971 to 1976, he held various appointments as a Lecturer in [[Computer Science]] at Harvard, and as a [[Systems Engineer]] at [[Honeywell]]. Some of his students at Harvard have gone on to become well known figures in the computer industry. [[Robert M. Metcalfe]] co-invented [[Ethernet]], [[John M. McQuillan]] developed routing algorithms used by [[ARPAnet]], and [[Bill Gates]] co-founded [[Microsoft]]. His career in computer performance analysis has included the creation of several fundamental mathematical models and analysis procedures used in [[operational research]], and the development of tools based on these models and procedures. With fellow Harvard applied mathematics Ph.D.s Robert Goldberg and Harold Schwenk he co-founded [[BGS Systems]] in 1976 to support and market these tools, serving as its vice president in charge of R&D until BGS Systems merged with [[BMC Software]] in 1998. He has held leadership positions in various professional societies, including [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] Sigmetrics, the [[International Federation for Information Processing|IFIP]] Working Group and the [[Computer Measurement Group|CMG]] (was President from 2000 to 2001). In 1979, he received CMG's A.A. Michelson award <ref>[http://cmg.org/national/michelson_awards.html Computer Measurement Group ''A. A. Michelson Award'']</ref> for technical excellence and professional contributions as a teacher and inspirer of others. ==See also== * [[Buzen's algorithm]] ==External links== *[http://www.cs.umd.edu/conference/sigmetrics2001/buzen.html Short biography] *[http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Buzen:Jeffrey_P=.html List of publications] ==References== <references/> {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME = Buzen, Jeffrey P. | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH = May 28, 1943 | PLACE OF BIRTH = [[Brooklyn]] | DATE OF DEATH = | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Buzen, Jeffrey P.}} [[Category:1943 births]] [[Category:American computer scientists]] [[Category:Brown University alumni]] [[Category:Computer systems engineers]] [[Category:Harvard University alumni]] [[Category:People from Brooklyn]] [[Category:Queueing theorists]] [[Category:Living people]] {{compu-scientist-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>19862</id> <title>Jena (framework)</title> <text>{{otheruses|Jena (disambiguation)}} {{Infobox_Software | name = Jena Semantic Web Framework | logo = | screenshot = | caption = | developer = [[HP Labs]] (until October 2009) | latest_release_version = 2.6.2 | latest_release_date = {{start date|2009|10|16}} | previous_release_version = 2.6.0 | previous_release_date = {{start date and age|2009|05|18}} | operating_system = [[Cross-platform]] | genre = [[Semantic Web]] | license = [[BSD-style license]] | website = http://openjena.org/ }} '''Jena''' is an [[open source]] [[Semantic Web]] framework for [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. It provides an [[API]] to extract data from and write to [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] graphs. The graphs are represented as an abstract "model". A model can be sourced with data from files, databases, URLs or a combination of these. A Model can also be queried through [[SPARQL]] and updated through [[SPARUL]]. Jena is similar to [[Sesame (framework)|Sesame]]; though, unlike Sesame, Jena provides support for OWL ([[Web Ontology Language]]). The framework has various internal reasoners and the [[Pellet reasoner]] (an open source Java OWL-DL reasoner) can be set up to work in Jena. Jena supports serialisation of RDF graphs to: *a [[relational database]] *[[RDF/XML]] *[[Turtle (syntax)|Turtle]] *[[Notation 3]] ==Joseki== [[Joseki (RDF server)|Joseki]] is an [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] server. The goal of Joseki is to provide an HTTP interface to RDF data. It fully supports [[SPARQL]] for querying and
