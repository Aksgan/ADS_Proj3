This is the common crimp type plug, of the same kind pictured above crimped onto a cable (with moulded sleeve)]] '''Modular connector''' is the name given to a family of [[electrical connector]]s originally used in telephone wiring. Even though they are still used for that purpose they are used for a variety of other things as well. A modular connector's advantage over many other kinds include small size and ease of plugging and unplugging. However the plastic retaining spring clip tends to get broken off when cables are pulled from storage for use. If that happens, the plug can easily fall out of the wall jack. Many uses that originally used a bulkier connector have migrated to modular connectors. Probably the most well known applications of modular connectors is for telephone jacks and for [[Ethernet]] jacks, which are nearly always modular connectors. Modular connectors are used in the [[Registered jack|Registered Jack]] system, so some uses are precisely described by the Registered Jack specifications to specify how the connectors are wired for practical use in telecommunications. A notable exception that has no RJ specification is a [[Modular connector#4P4C|4P4C]] terminated telephone handset cable. The Registered Jack specifications define the wiring patterns of the jacks, not the physical dimensions or geometry of the connectors of either sex. Instead, these are covered by [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard 8877, first used in [[ISDN]] systems. It is important to note that connector plugs are made for [[solid]] or [[stranded]] wire, especially when using [[8P8C]] [[ethernet]] cable connectors. A plug for one wire type (especially stranded) might not make reliable contact when crimped to a cable with wires of the other type (See [[Modular connector#Sizes and contacts|below]]). ==Nomenclature== {{Main|Registered jack naming confusion}} Modular connectors also go by the names "modular phone jack/plug", "RJ connector," and "Western jack/plug." It is very common, but incorrect, to use a Registered Jack number to refer to the physical connector itself; for instance, the [[8P8C]] modular connector type is often loosely called [[RJ45]] (for a standard that uses this connector), but 8P8C connectors are also used with different wiring, such as for [[Ethernet over twisted pair]]; in fact, the RJ45 wiring pattern is almost obsolete. The term "modular connector" is not terribly descriptive, but arose from its original use in a novel system of cabling designed to make telephone systems more modular. This includes the [[4P4C]] handset connector which is often referred to as an RJ9 or an RJ22—both of these are incorrect, since 4P4C connectors were not used to connect to carrier circuits at all: there is no valid Registered Jack number for the 4P4C{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}. Citations to government document standards, that also define the RJ specifications, that explicitly disqualify a 4P4C (or 10P10C) connector as a Registered Jack, are vacuous, since currently, (circa 2010) any such RJ specification is simply absent in the official documents <ref name=FCC47Part68 >[http://www.tscm.com/FCC47CFRpart68.pdf FCC 47 CFR Part 68] section 68.502 superseded by T1.TR5-1999</ref><ref name=T1.TR5-1999 >[http://www.atis.org/docstore/product.aspx?id=25297 T1.TR5-1999] Network and Customer Installation Interface Connector Wiring Configuration Catalog at [http://www.atis.org/ ATIS]</ref><ref name=ACTAdocs >[http://www.part68.org/documents.aspx ACTA documents]</ref>. ==History== Modular connectors were originally [[invent]]ed and [[patent]]ed by [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] (patent filed 6 July 1973; {{US patent|3860316}} issued 14 January 1975), and replaced the hard-wired connections on most [[Western Electric]] telephones around 1976. At the same time, they began to replace screw terminals and large 3 and 4 pin jacks in buildings. ==Gender== Modular connectors have [[Gender of connectors and fasteners|gender]]: male connectors are called '''plugs,''' while female connectors are called '''jacks''' or, sometimes, '''sockets.''' The choice of gender is generally based on the ''location'' of the connector: plugs are used to terminate loose cables and cords, while jacks are used for fixed locations on surfaces such as walls and panels. (This is in contrast to some other connector systems, where the choice of gender is based on the ''function'' of the connector: for example, in power cabling systems, female connectors deliver power, while male connectors receive power.) Cables with a plug on one end and a jack on the other are rare (though telephone extension cables are very common); instead, cables that have the more common arrangement of plugs on both ends are connected using a male-to-male [[adapter]], which has two jacks. ==Locking and hook== Modular connectors are designed to lock together. A spring-loaded tab called a "hook" on the plug snaps into a jack so that the plug cannot be pulled out. To remove the plug, the hook must be depressed. The most common way to install a jack in a wall or panel is with the hook side down. This usually makes it easier to operate the hook when removing the plug, because the person grabs the plug with thumb on top and presses the hook with the index finger. The modular connector, however, suffers from very poor design
