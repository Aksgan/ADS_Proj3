is zero when <math>k>n</math>. The set of all ''k''-combinations of a set ''S'' is sometimes denoted by :<math>\binom Sk\,</math>. Combinations can consider the combination of ''n'' things taken ''k'' at a time without or with repetitions.<ref>Erwin Kreyszig, ''Advanced Engineering Mathematics'', John Wiley & Sons, INC, 1999</ref> In the above example repetitions were not allowed. If however it was possible to have two of any one kind of fruit there would be 3 more combinations: one with two apples, one with two oranges, and one with two pears. With large sets, it becomes necessary to use mathematics to find the number of combinations. For example, a [[Hand (poker)|poker hand]] can be described as a 5-combination (''k'' = 5) of cards from a 52 card deck (''n'' = 52). The 5 cards of the hand are all distinct, and the order of cards in the hand does not matter. There are 2,598,960 such combinations, and the chance of drawing any one hand at random is 1 / 2,598,960. == Number of ''k''-combinations == {{main|Binomial coefficient}} The number of ''k''-combinations from a given set ''S'' of ''n'' elements is often denoted in elementary combinatorics texts by ''C''(''n'', ''k''), or by a variation such as <math>C^n_k</math>, <math>{}_nC_k</math>, <math>{}^nC_k</math> or even <math>C_n^k</math> (the latter form is standard in French and Polish texts). The same number however occurs in many other mathematical contexts, where it is denoted by <math>\tbinom nk</math>; notably it occurs as coefficient in the [[binomial formula]], hence its name '''binomial coefficient'''. One can define <math>\tbinom nk</math> for all natural numbers ''k'' at once by the relation :<math>\textstyle(1+X)^n=\sum_{k\geq0}\binom nk X^k,</math> from which it is clear that <math>\tbinom n0=\tbinom nn=1</math> and <math>\tbinom nk=0</math> for ''k'' > ''n''. To see that these coefficients count ''k''-combinations from ''S'', one can first consider a collection of ''n'' distinct variables ''X''<sub>''s''</sub> labeled by the elements ''s'' of ''S'', and expand the [[Multiplication|product]] over all elements of ''S'': :<math>\textstyle\prod_{s\in S}(1+X_s);</math> it has 2<sup>''n''</sup> distinct terms corresponding to all the subsets of ''S'', each subset giving the product of the corresponding variables ''X''<sub>''s''</sub>. Now setting all of the ''X''<sub>''s''</sub> equal to the unlabeled variable ''X'', so that the product becomes {{nowrap|(1 + ''X'')<sup>''n''</sup>}}, the term for each ''k''-combination from ''S'' becomes ''X''<sup>''k''</sup>, so that that the coefficient of that power in the result equals the number of such ''k''-combinations. Binomial coefficients can be computed explicitly in various ways. To get all of them for the expansions up to {{nowrap|(1 + ''X'')<sup>''n''</sup>}}, one can use (in addition to the basic cases already given) the recursion relation :<math>\binom nk=\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\binom{n-1}k,\text{ for }0<k<n,</math> which follows from {{nowrap|(1 + ''X'')<sup>''n''</sup> }}={{nowrap| (1 + ''X'')<sup>''n'' − 1</sup>(1 + ''X'')}}; this leads to the construction of [[Pascal's triangle]]. For determining an individual binomial coefficient, it is more practical to use the formula :<math>\binom nk = \frac{n^{\underline k}}{k!} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(n-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2)\cdots 1}.</math> In this formula the [[numerator]] gives the number of ''k''-[[permutations]] of ''n'', i.e., of sequences of ''k'' distinct elements of ''S'', while the [[denominator]] gives the number of such ''k''-[[permutations]] that give the same ''k''-combination when the order is ignored. When ''k'' exceeds ''n''/2, the above formula contains factors common to the numerator and the denominator, and canceling them out gives the relation :<math> \binom nk = \binom n{n-k},\text{ for }0 \le k \le n.</math> This expresses a symmetry that is evident from the binomial formula, and can also be understood in terms of ''k''-combinations by taking the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of such a combination, which is an {{nowrap|(''n'' − ''k'')}}-combination. Finally there is a formula which exhibits this symmetry directly, and has the merit of being easy to remember: :<math> \binom nk = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!},</math> where ''n''<nowiki>!</nowiki> denotes the [[factorial]] of ''n''. It is obtained from the previous formula by multiplying denominator and numerator by {{nowrap|(''n'' − ''k'')}}!, so it is certainly inferior as a method of computation to that formula. The last formula can be understood directly, by considering the ''n''<nowiki>!</nowiki> permutations of all the elements of ''S''. Each such permutation gives a ''k''-combination by selecting its first ''k'' elements. There are many duplicate selections: any combined permutation of the first ''k'' elements among each other, and of the final (''n'' &minus; ''k'') elements among each other produces the same combination; this explains the division in the formula. From the above formulas follow relations between adjacent numbers in Pascal's triangle in all three directions: :<math> \binom nk = \binom n{k-1} \frac {n-k+1}k,\text{ for }k>0 </math>, :<math> \binom nk = \binom {n-1}k \frac n{n-k},\text{ for }{k<n} </math>, :<math> \binom nk = \binom {n-1}{k-1} \frac nk,\text{ for }n,k>0 </math>. Together with the basic cases <math>\tbinom n0=1=\tbinom nn</math>, these allow successive computation of respectively all numbers of combinations from the same set (a row in Pascal's triangle), of ''k''-combinations of sets of growing sizes, and of combinations with a complement of fixed size {{nowrap|''n'' − ''k''}}. === Example of counting combinations === As a concrete example, one can compute the number of five-card hands possible from a standard fifty-two card deck as: :<math> {52 \choose 5} = \frac{52!}{5!47!} = \frac{52\times51\times50\times49\times48}{5\times4\times3\times2\times1} = \frac{311,875,200}{120} = 2,598,960.</math> An alternative, almost equivalent computation, is :<math> {n \choose k} = \frac { ( n - 0 ) }{ (k - 0) } \times \frac { ( n - 1 ) }{ (k - 1) } \times \frac { ( n - 2 ) }{ (k - 2) } \times \frac { ( n - 3 ) }{ (k - 3) } \times \cdots \times \frac { ( n - (k - 1) ) }{ (k - (k - 1)) },</math> which gives :<math> {52 \choose 5} = \frac { 52 }{ 5 } \times \frac { 51 }{ 4 } \times \frac { 50 }{ 3 } \times \frac { 49 }{ 2 } \times \frac { 48 }{ 1 } = 2,598,960.</math> Using the symmetric formula in terms of factorials gives :<math> \begin{align} {52 \choose 5} &= \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \frac{52!}{5!(52-5)!} = \frac{52!}{5!47!} \\ &= \tfrac{80,658,175,170,943,878,571,660,636,856,403,766,975,289,505,440,883,277,824,000,000,000,000}{120\times258,623,241,511,168,180,642,964,355,153,611,979,969,197,632,389,120,000,000,000} \\ &= 2,598,960. \end{align}</math> == Number of combinations with
