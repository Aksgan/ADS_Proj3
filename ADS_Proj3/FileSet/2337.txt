While Macrae gives it as pancreatic, the ''Life'' magazine article says it was prostate.</ref> Von Neumann died a year and a half later, in great pain. While at [[Walter Reed Hospital]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], he invited a [[Roman Catholic]] priest, Father Anselm Strittmatter, [[Benedictine|O.S.B.]], to visit him for consultation (a move which shocked some of von Neumann's friends).<ref>The question of whether or not von Neumann had formally converted to Catholicism upon his marriage to Mariette Kövesi (who was Catholic) is addressed by Halmos (ref. 5). He was baptised Roman Catholic but he certainly was not a practicing member of that religion after his divorce.</ref> The priest then administered to him the last [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Sacraments]].<ref name=amm>Halmos, P.R.

His last work, written while in the hospital and later published in book form as ''[[The Computer and the Brain]]'', gives an indication of the direction of his interests at the time of his death. ==Logic and set theory== {{Citations missing|section|date=April 2007}} The axiomatization of mathematics, on the model of [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', had reached new levels of rigor and breadth at the end of the 19th century, particularly in arithmetic (thanks to [[Richard Dedekind]] and [[Giuseppe Peano]]) and geometry (thanks to [[David Hilbert]]). At the beginning of the twentieth century, [[set theory]], the new branch of mathematics discovered by [[Georg Cantor]], and thrown into crisis by [[Bertrand Russell]] with the discovery of [[Russell's paradox|his famous paradox]] (on the set of all sets which do not belong to themselves), had not yet been formalized. {{Portal box|Set theory}} The problem of an adequate axiomatization of [[set theory]] was resolved implicitly about twenty years later (by [[Ernst Zermelo]] and [[Abraham Fraenkel]]) by way of a series of principles which allowed for the construction of all sets used in the actual practice of mathematics, but which did not explicitly exclude the possibility of the existence of sets which belong to themselves. In his doctoral thesis of 1925, von Neumann demonstrated how it was possible to exclude this possibility in two complementary ways: the ''[[axiom of foundation]]'' and the notion of ''[[Class (set theory)|class]].'' The [[axiom]] of foundation established that every set can be constructed from the bottom up in an ordered succession of steps by way of the principles of Zermelo and Fraenkel, in such a manner that if one set belongs to another then the first must necessarily come before the second in the succession (hence excluding the possibility of a set belonging to itself.) To demonstrate that the addition of this new axiom to the others did not produce contradictions, von Neumann introduced a method of demonstration (called the ''method of [[inner model]]s'') which later became an essential instrument in set theory. The second approach to the problem took as its base the notion of class, and defines a set as a class which belongs to other classes, while a ''proper class'' is defined as a class which does not belong to other classes. Under the Zermelo/Fraenkel approach, the axioms impede the construction of a set of all sets which do not belong to themselves. In contrast, under the von Neumann approach, the class of all sets which do not belong to themselves can be constructed, but it is a ''proper class'' and not a set. With this contribution of von Neumann, the axiomatic system of the theory of sets became fully satisfactory, and the next question was whether or not it was also definitive, and not subject to improvement. A strongly negative answer arrived in September 1930 at the historic mathematical Congress of [[Königsberg]], in which [[Kurt Gödel]] announced his [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|first theorem of incompleteness]]: the usual axiomatic systems are incomplete, in the sense that they cannot prove every truth which is expressible in their language. This result was sufficiently innovative as to confound the majority of mathematicians of the time. But von Neumann, who had participated at the Congress, confirmed his fame as an instantaneous thinker, and in less than a month was able to communicate to Gödel himself an interesting consequence of his theorem: namely that the usual axiomatic systems are unable to demonstrate their own consistency. It is precisely this consequence which has attracted the most attention, even if Gödel originally considered it only a curiosity, and had derived it independently anyway (it is for this reason that the result is called ''Gödel's second theorem'', without mention of von Neumann.) ==Quantum mechanics== At the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] of 1900, [[David Hilbert]] presented his famous list of twenty-three problems considered central for the development of the mathematics of the new century. The sixth of these was ''[[Hilbert's sixth problem|the axiomatization of physical theories]].'' Among the new physical theories of the century the only one which had yet to receive such a treatment by the end of the 1930s was [[quantum mechanics]]. Quantum mechanics found itself in a condition of foundational crisis similar to that of set theory at the beginning of the century, facing problems of both philosophical and technical natures. On the one hand, its apparent non-determinism had not been reduced to an explanation of a deterministic form. On the other, there still existed two independent but equivalent heuristic formulations, the so-called [[matrix mechanics|matrix mechanical formulation]] due to
