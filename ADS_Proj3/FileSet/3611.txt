the construction leadership. This was done to avoid time-consuming territorial conflicts between local authorities. If an agreement over the acquisition of a piece of land for the construction of a new station was not possible, expropriation of private lands could be undertaken in the worst case. The line ran north of [[Egeln]] ([[Schloss Ampfurth]]), through [[Halberstadt]], [[Goslar]], [[Höxter]] to station #31 near [[Entrup]] where it turned in a southwesterly direction just before reaching [[Paderborn]] after crossing the [[Weser Uplands]]. Subsequently, it ran along the southern side of a line connecting [[Salzkotten]], [[Erwitte]], [[Soest]], [[Werl]], [[Iserlohn]], [[Hagen]], [[Schwelm]] and [[Lennep]] it made its way finally to [[Cologne]] via the stations [[Schlebusch]] (station #49), and [[Flittard]] (#50). From there he route ran parallel to the east bank of the [[Rhine]] via [[Spich]] to [[Ehrenbreitstein]]. The final station (#60) was built into the [[Fortress|Fortress Ehrenbreitstein]]. After the completion of construction and the start of operations of the whole system in 1833, it quickly became clear that the Rhine ferry crossing to Koblenz presented a major hold up in telegraphic traffic. This could only be solved by expanding the line with an end station in Koblenz. In the same year, station #61 was put into service in the [[Koblenz#Elector's palace|Electoral Palace]] in Koblenz, which was then used as a barracks. The palace also served as the administrative offices for the western section of the route. The route traveled over [[Kingdom of Hannover|Hanoverian]] domain at stations #22 and #23 in [[Schladen]] and [[Liebenburg]]. Likewise, stations #23 through #28 lay in the domain of the [[Duchy of Brunswick]]. Negotiations with both governments for the acquisition of land and the construction of stations quickly met with success. Additionally, two stations were economized within the Brunswick domain by increasing the distance between stations #23, 24, and 25. After a year of service, it became clear that the wide interval between these stations led to frequent interruptions in visual contact during drizzly and grey weather. In 1842 this problem was solved with the construction of station #24a near [[Mechtshausen]]. The entire route now comprised 62 stations. They were on average {{km to mi|11}} apart with the longest distance separating stations at {{km to mi|15}} and the shortest at {{km to mi|7.5}}. There were only two dispatch stations, one at each end of the line. Koblenz was the seat of the [[Oberpräsident]] of the Rhine Province and the western headquarters of the Prussian defense force. Messages could neither be sent nor received from the obviously larger and more important economic and transportation center of Cologne. Messages arriving in Cologne from England or [[Belgium]] addressed to Berlin had to first be sent by courier to Koblenz and then from there telegraphed again through Cologne to Berlin. This whole process caused a day’s delay. Hence, in 1836, a third dispatch bureau was opened at the Cologne telegraph station of St. Pantleon. ===Stations=== The common functional element of all of the telegraph stations was the ca. {{m to ft in|6.3}} high softwood mast. The mast carried the six telegraph arms - also known as indicators - and it also held the control mechanism for the arms. A ring was fastened between the top two sets of signal arms to which was attached four cables that were secured to the four corners of the station roof. This provided additional stability to the mast during storms. The mast and control mechanism ran through the roof of the observation room. The roof was specially sealed against rain. The mast was secured to the floor beams and likewise the roof with [[cast iron]] hardware. ===Indicators and their control=== [[Image:Code-prussian-optical-teleg.png|thumb|upright=0.83|groundposition of arms to display "0–6"]] [[Image:Code-prussian-opt-teleg-3.png|thumb|left|upright=0.55|example]] [[Image:Code-prussian-opt-teleg-2.png|thumb|upright=0.83|"7–9"]] The moving signal arms were suspended with counterweights to enable easy adjustment. The indicators measured 1.74 m × 0.33 m. Only two of the original indicators still exist today; one is on display in the Boerdemuseum in [[Ummendorf]] and the other in the [[Museum for Communication]] in Berlin. These arms, as well as preserved construction drawings, suggest that the arms consisted of a wooden framework with a wood or sheet metal interior. This provided greater wind resistance. The operating mechanism of the system was located at the bottom of the mast in the observation room of the station. The indicators were operated with six adjustable levers arranged above each other in pairs. The position of each lever corresponded to the three-level alignment of the signal arms on the mast above. The levers and signal arms were connected by hemp ropes and later by wire cables. The levers each were lockable in four different positions, that exactly corresponded to the position of signal arm: 0° (arm hanging downward parallel to the mast), 45°, 90° (perpendicular to the mast), and 135°. Each position was relative to the mast.

The scopes were either of English construction or they came from Pistor’s workshop. The portion of the route between Cologne and Koblenz was outfitted chiefly with scopes from the Munich lens-maker [[Georg Merz]]. The scopes’ magnification is estimated at between 40 and 60x. As with the other technical aspects of the stations, very specific instructions existed at each for the storage, use, and care of the scopes. Twelve paragraphs of instruction were allotted to the scopes alone. ===Station Clocks and Time Synchronization=== "Berlin Time" was the authoritative time used along the entire telegraph line; with a time-synchronizing message coming from Berlin every three days at the latest. A [[Cuckoo Clock|Schwarzwald Clock]] with a chime hung in each station as the official station clock. The synchronization process would be announced an hour in advance with a signal which prompted the station agents to continuously observe the neighboring station in the direction of Berlin. The signal had to then be sent to the next station without delay. Once the signal reached Koblenz, it was relayed back to Berlin as confirmation. In good weather conditions, the entire process from
