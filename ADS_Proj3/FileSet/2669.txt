They are components that enforce access control measures for systems, programs, processes, and information. Logical access controls can be embedded within operating systems, applications, add-on security packages, or database and telecommunication management systems. Logical access control can be contrasted with physical access control (an example of which is a mechanical lock and key controlling access to a room), but the line between the two can be blurred when physical access is controlled by software. For example, entry to a room may be controlled by a chip-and-PIN card and an electronic lock controlled by software. Only those in possession of an appropriate card, with an appropriate security level and with knowledge of the PIN are permitted entry to the room. On swiping the card into a card reader and entering the correct PIN, the user's security level is checked against a security database and compared to the security level required to enter the room. If the user meets the security requirements, entry is permitted. Having logical access controlled centrally in software allows a user's physical access permissions to be rapidly amended or revoked. ==External links== *http://www.totse.com/en/privacy/encryption/hk_acces.html *http://www.rsa.com/glossary/default.asp?id=1069 [[Category:Access control]] {{comp-sci-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>22548</id> <title>Logical graph</title> <text>A '''logical [[graph (mathematics)|graph]]''' is a special type of diagramatic structure in any one of several systems of graphical [[syntax (logic)|syntax]] that [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] developed for [[logic]]. In his papers on ''[[qualitative logic]]'', ''[[entitative graph]]s'', and ''[[existential graph]]s'', Peirce developed several versions of a graphical [[formal system|formalism]], or a graph-theoretic [[formal language]], designed to be interpreted for logic. In the century since Peirce initiated this line of development, a variety of formal systems have branched out from what is abstractly the same formal base of graph-theoretic structures. ==See also== * [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography]] * [[Conceptual graph]] * [[Propositional calculus]] * [[Truth table]] ==External links== * [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/graphlogi.html Logical Graph] @ [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms] * [http://www.existentialgraphs.com/ Existential Graphs], Jay Zeman, ed., U. of Florida.

Without being specific to a particular database management product, it is in terms of either relational tables and columns, object-oriented classes, or XML tags. This is as opposed to a [[conceptual data model]], which describes the semantics of an organization without reference to technology, or a [[physical data model]], which describe the particular physical mechanisms used to capture data in a storage medium. The next step in creating a [[database]], after the logical schema is produced, is to create the [[physical schema]]. {{DEFAULTSORT:Logical Schema}} [[Category:Data management]] {{database-stub}} [[de:Schema (Informatik)]] [[ja:論理スキーマ]] [[ru:Схема_базы_данных]]</text> </page> <page> <id>22556</id> <title>Logical topology</title> <text>'''Logical Topology''' (also referred to as '''Signal Topology''') is a network computing term used to describe the arrangement of devices on a network and how they communicate with one another. How devices are connected to the network through the actual cables that transmit data, or the physical structure of the network, is called the [[Network topology|physical topology]]. Logical topologies are bound to network protocols and describe how data is moved across the network. '''Internet topology''' refers to the logical topology of the [[internet]]. There are attempts to study internet topology by network scientists such as [[Albert-László Barabási]]. There are also attempts by networks of individuals to deliberately manipulate internet topology, which could be referred to as virtual terraforming. Cases and possibilities include a distributed [[denial-of-service attack]] (DdoS), in which virtual [[smart mobs]] flood a site with hits/links, or correspondingly, cease all traffic/remove all links to a site; the strategic use of [[linkback]] and [http://studio.berkeley.edu/niemeyer/reverse.html reverse-linking] to change the connectedness and therefore searchability of sites; and incorporating the [[long tail]] into search engines, e.g. with an option to search for poorly linked sites. Internet topology may change dramatically as internet architecture moves from a conception of links that is binary (yes/no link) or spectral (strength of link) to one that is typological (type of link). For example, as [[Facebook]] moves from a binary conception of relationship (yes/no friend) to a typological one (type of relationship) with its “How do you know [insert name]?” feature, the topology of its social network will change; specifically, its social network will become [[social graphs]]. If something similar were applied to links between sites on the internet, it would drastically terraform what [[Albert-László Barabási]] identifies as the 4 continents of internet topology. ==References== <ref name="one">[http://showerinthedark.blogspot.com/2007/12/virtual-terraforming.html Shower in the dark post on virtual terraforming]</ref> <ref name="imon">[http://showerinthedark.blogspot.com/2007/12/trajectory-of-categorization.html Shower in the dark post on the trajectory of categorization] topology is a technique
