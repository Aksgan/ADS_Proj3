for the times of day that their services are very frequent, or they may simply state "services run every 3–5 minutes" (or words to that effect) The first railway timetable compilation was published in [[1839]] by [[George Bradshaw]]. In many modern [[public transport]] systems, timetables and rostering are designed by computer, with the operators specifying operating span, minimum frequencies, route length/time and other such factors. Design of the schedule may also aim to keep times memorable for customers, through the use of [[clock-face scheduling]] &mdash; services departing at regular intervals, at the same times every hour. == Varieties == [[Image:Bus timetable.JPG|thumb|A simple bus timetable ([[2005]]) found in the [[Greece|Greek]] island of [[Astipalea]]|right]] === Tables with services in columns === Many timetables comprise [[table (information)|table]]s with services shown in columns of a table, and stations or stops on the rows of the table. There will generally be tables for each direction, and often separate (pairs of) tables for weekdays, Saturdays and Sundays. Generally the times for each station or stop will be the departure time, except for the last stop of the service which will be the arrival time. At some stops if the service stops for some time, both arrival and departure times might be shown on consecutive rows. As well as the times, the columns might include other information, often at the top of the columns, such as day(s) of operation, availability of on-board facilities such as refreshments, and a service number. === Tables with services in rows === Timetables with services arranged in rows of tables and stops or stations in columns are less common but otherwise similar to timetables with services in columns. === Times listed for a given stop === [[Image:FahrplanTiefenbrunnen.JPG|thumb|lright|Train departures list in the form of a yellow poster, common in Europe.]] Some timetables, particularly posted on [[train station|railway stations]] and [[bus stop]]s, list times that services depart that location, sometimes along with other information such as destinations and stopping conditions. As with other forms, there may be separate lists for different days of the week. There may be a separate list for each line/direction (this applies e.g. for train departures in the Netherlands), or a combined chronological list (as in the picture). In [[mainland Europe]] train departures are listed on a yellow poster, and arrivals on a white poster. These posters are placed at entrances to stations and on platforms. === Dynamic displays === [[Image:BordUtrecht.jpg|thumb|lright|Dynamic display in the central hall at [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] central station, listing the departures for the next hour or so.]] Dynamic displays in stations may be at a central place and list the next few departures for each line, or all departures for the next hour. Displays on platforms just show the next departure (or perhaps the next few) from that platform. === Journey planners === Internet-based programs allow one to enter departure and destination locations, as well as date, and departure or arrival time. These [[Intermodal Journey Planner|journey planners]] then give suitable departure times, with details for the whole journey. These may comprise more than one service or mode. For an example, see below "Europe". [[Image:BusTimetable.jpg|thumb|lright|This board in [[Playa del Carmen]], Mexico, shows both times and prices of journeys. Note that it is not dynamic; the times and prices are fixed to the board.]] == Timetables currently published in the world == ===International=== *Thomas Cook European Timetable A monthly timetable book of major trains, some bus and ferry services in Europe. *Thomas Cook Overseas Timetable A bi-monthly timetable book of major trains, and some bus and ferry services outside Europe - no longer published after December 2010. *OAG Flight Guide A monthly air timetable book published by [[OAG]] (Official Airline Guide), and covers all airlines and airports in the world. ===America=== ====United States==== *Amtrak System Timetable The official timetable book of [[Amtrak]] and published twice a year. ===Asia=== ====China==== *China Railway Passenger Train Timetable （全国铁路旅客列车时刻表） *China Railway Passenger Express Train Timetable（全国铁路旅客快车时刻表） These handy books are published twice a year by China Railway Publishing in Chinese.

It is a widespread design pattern in the country.]] The first regularly published timetable appeared in 1894, published by a private company. By the time of the nationalization of Japanese railways in 1906, three competing timetables were being published and it was decided that only one official timetable should be offered to the public. Five thousand copies of the first official timetable were published in January 1915.<ref>Aoki, E. et al ''A History of Japanese Railways 1872-1999''. Tokyo: East Japan Railway Culture Foundation, 2000.</ref> In 2010, two printed national timetables were available: the Japan Tourist Bureau (JTB) Timetable (JTB時刻表) and the Japan Railways (JR) Timetable (JR時刻表）. These thick books - the February 2009 edition of the JTB timetable, for example, contains 1152 pages - are published every month and cover all stations and trains of [[Japan Railways Group|JR]] and private railways, as well as long distance bus, ferry and air services in Japan. For frequent JR urban lines, subway trains, private railways and urban buses, only summary timetables are shown. In 2009, a book was published to mark the 1000th edition of the JTB timetable, containing reproductions of all one thousand covers, selected timetables and maps, and articles on the way the timetable is produced.<ref>時刻表1000号物語 ISBN 978-4533075254</ref> There is also many searchable online timetables, covering all forms of transport in Japan, for example http://www.hyperdia.com/. Timetables for PDA's and PC's are also produced. ====South Korea==== *Tourism Transport Timetable (월간 관광교통 시각표) This handy timetable book is published every month and covers all trains, highway bus, ferry and domestic air services. ===Europe=== The most comprehensive Europe-wide timetable information is that provided by the electronic timetable search
