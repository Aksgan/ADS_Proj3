Media and Advertising: User Generated Content Consumption|volume=1|year=2010|publisher=IGI Global|pages=248–261|chapter=Consumer Generated Advertising in Blogs}}</ref> Many blogs provide commentary or news on a particular subject; others function as more personal [[online diary|online diaries]]. A typical blog combines text, images, and links to other blogs, [[Web page]]s, and other media related to its topic. The ability of readers to leave comments in an interactive format is an important part of many blogs. Most blogs are primarily textual, although some focus on art ([[Art blog]]), photographs ([[photoblog]]), videos ([[video blogging]]), music ([[MP3 blog]]), and audio ([[podcast]]ing). [[Microblogging]] is another type of blogging, featuring very short posts. As of December 2007, blog search engine [[Technorati]] was tracking more than 112 million blogs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://technorati.com/about/|title=Welcome to Technorati|date=unknown|accessdate=2008-06-05| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080504092447/http://www.technorati.com/about/| archivedate = May 4, 2008}}</ref> ==History== {{Main|History of blogging|online diary}} The term "weblog" was coined by [[Jorn Barger]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/entertainment/theweb/news/2007/12/blog_anniversary|title=After 10 Years of Blogs, the Future's Brighter Than Ever|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref> on 17 December 1997. The short form, "blog," was coined by [[Peter Merholz]], who jokingly broke the word ''weblog'' into the phrase ''we blog'' in the sidebar of his blog Peterme.com in April or May 1999.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/surveys/displaystory.cfm?story_id=6794172|title=It's the links, stupid|publisher=The Economist|date=2006-04-20|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://peterme.com/index.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19991013021124/http://peterme.com/index.html|archivedate=1999-10-13|title=Peterme.com|last=Merholz|first=Peter|publisher=[[The Internet Archive]]|year=1999|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kottke.org/03/08/its-weblog-not-web-log|last=Kottke|first=Jason|authorlink=Jason Kottke|title=kottke.org|date=2003-08-26|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, [[Evan Williams (blogger)|Evan Williams]] at [[Pyra Labs]] used "blog" as both a noun and verb ("to blog," meaning "to edit one's weblog or to post to one's weblog") and devised the term "blogger" in connection with Pyra Labs' [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]] product, leading to the popularization of the terms.<ref>[http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0804C&L=ADS-L&P=R16795&I=-3 Origins of "Blog" and "Blogger"], American Dialect Society Mailing List (Apr. 20, 2008).</ref> ===Origins=== Before blogging became popular, digital communities took many forms, including [[Usenet]], commercial online services such as [[GEnie]], BiX and the early [[CompuServe]], [[electronic mailing list|e-mail lists]]<ref>The term "e-log" has been used to describe journal entries sent out via e-mail since as early as March 1996.{{cite web|last=Norman|first=David|title=Users confused by blogs|date=2005-07-13|url=http://lists.drupal.org/archives/development/2005-07/msg00208.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070607235110/http://lists.drupal.org/archives/development/2005-07/msg00208.html|archivedate=2007-06-07|accessdate =2008-06-05|format={{Dead link|date=June 2008}} &ndash; <sup>[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=author%3ANorman+intitle%3AUsers+confused+by+blogs&as_publication=&as_ylo=2005&as_yhi=2005&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup>|postscript=<!--None-->}}{{cite web|title=Research staff and students welcome ‘E-Log’|publisher=University College London|month=December | year=2003|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news-archive/archive/2003/december-2003/latest/newsitem.shtml?03120901|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref> and [[Bulletin Board System]]s (BBS). In the 1990s, [[Internet forum]] software, created running conversations with "threads." Threads are topical connections between messages on a virtual "corkboard." The modern blog evolved from the [[online diary]], where people would keep a running account of their personal lives. Most such writers called themselves diarists, [[journalist]]s, or journalers. [[Justin Hall]], who began personal blogging in 1994 while a student at [[Swarthmore College]], is generally recognized as one of the earliest bloggers,<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/02/20/MNGBKBEJO01.DTL|title=Time to get a life — pioneer blogger Justin Hall bows out at 31|last=Harmanci|first=Reyhan|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|date=2005-02-20|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref> as is [[Jerry Pournelle]].<ref>[http://www.jerrypournelle.com/#whatabout Chaos Manor in Perspective]: "I can make some claim to this being The Original Blog and Daybook. I certainly started keeping a day book well before most, and long before the term "blog" or Web Log was invented.

This practice of semi-automated blogging with live video together with text was referred to as [[sousveillance]], and such journals were also used as evidence in legal matters. Early blogs were simply manually updated components of common [[website|Web site]]s. However, the evolution of tools to facilitate the production and maintenance of Web articles posted in reverse chronological order made the publishing process feasible to a much larger, less technical, population. Ultimately, this resulted in the distinct class of online publishing that produces blogs we recognize today. For instance, the use of some sort of browser-based software is now a typical aspect of "blogging". Blogs can be hosted by dedicated [[blog hosting service]]s, or they can be run using [[blog software]], or on regular [[web hosting service]]s. Some early bloggers, such as [[The Misanthropic Bitch]], who began in 1997, actually referred to their online presence as a [[zine]], before the term blog entered common usage. ===Rise in popularity=== After a slow start, blogging rapidly gained in popularity. Blog usage spread during 1999 and the years following, being further popularized by the near-simultaneous arrival of the first hosted blog tools: * [[Bruce Ableson]] launched [[Open Diary]] in October 1998, which soon grew to thousands of online diaries. Open Diary innovated the reader comment, becoming the first blog community where readers could add comments to other writers' blog entries. * [[Brad Fitzpatrick]] started [[LiveJournal]] in March 1999. * Andrew Smales created Pitas.com in July 1999 as an easier alternative to maintaining a "news page" on a Web site, followed by Diaryland in September 1999, focusing more on a personal diary community.<ref>Jensen, Mallory [http://cjrarchives.org/issues/2003/5/blog-jensen.asp?printerfriendly=yes A Brief History of Weblogs]</ref> * [[Evan Williams (blogger)|Evan Williams]] and [[Meg Hourihan]] ([[Pyra Labs]]) launched [[blogger.com]] in August 1999 (purchased by [[Google]] in February 2003) <!-- * Paul Kedrosky's [[GrokSoup]] -- EXPAND OR DELETE? --> ===Political impact=== :''See also: [[Political blog]] Since 2002, blogs have gained increasing notice and coverage for their role in breaking, shaping, and [[spin (public relations)|spinning]] [[news]] stories.
