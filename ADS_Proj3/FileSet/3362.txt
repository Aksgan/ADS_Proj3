who was originally developed by Dr Archeville as a weapon of evil, ejected the "good" spark that had invaded and taken over the black figure, reverted to its original evil programming and, now no longer just a black version of Optimus but the malevolent Nemesis Prime (Black Convoy), escaped. Per Ravage's original plan, with Unicron defeated, the Decepticons returned to conquer the Transformers. However, Optimus Prime also planned for this event, and sent Mirage to press a switch, buried deep within Cybertron, that would render all Transformers inert. (This was seen at the conclusion of the "Five Faces of Darkness" story arc from the original animated series.) Optimus hoped that although all the Transformers would be rendered inoperative, the war would be stopped, and that the humans would be able to reactivate the Transformers in the future. However, this plan had the surprising side-effect that only those with original Cybertronian bodies were deactivated — those with Earth-made Binaltech bodies continued to function. And thus, the Autobots effectively won the war, with the large army of Binaltech Autobots easily outnumbering the few Decepticons who had managed to procure Binaltech upgrades (effectively just Nemesis Prime and Shockwave, who escaped with Megatron and their other inert comrades). With the major threats taken care of, Optimus Prime turned his and the Autobots' attention to identifying and shutting down the rogue projects taking place across Earth using stolen Binaltech technology and secrets. It was during one of these missions that Optimus Prime faced off against Nemesis Prime, with both of them in Binaltech [[Dodge Ram]] forms. Initially, things looked bad for Optimus Prime, as he was no match for his opponent's spectral armor. However, the Protector merged with Prime, and the enormous power that resulted allowed Prime to reflect Nemesis Prime's final attack, obliterating the evil Decepticon. Optimus Prime recalls the union of the two sparks being familiar, from an event in the distant past, and is also reassured by the Protector about "the seeds of the future", revealing the Protector to be [[Optimus Primal]]. == Toys == [[image:optimusprime.png|right|thumb|The original Optimus Prime toy patent design]] Through the years, there have been many action figures representing the original incarnation of Optimus Prime; some of which have featured in fiction, others of which have not. Additionally, some toy makers have made unlicensed toys in his image, or accessories for the existing toys. The original 1984 Optimus Prime toy was part of [[Takara]]'s 1983 [[Diaclone]] toy line under the name "Battle Convoy." Designed by Hiroyuki Obara and [[Shoji Kawamori]] (famous for his work in ''[[Macross]]'').,<ref>{{cite book|last= Igarashi|first= Kouji|authorlink= Kouji Ogarashi|title= タカラSFランド大全集|publisher= Kodansha|date= 1999.11|location= Tokyo|isbn= 4-06-330086-2}}</ref> the toy's characteristics such as the head design and cab front end as the upper torso have become design elements in nearly every incarnation and variant of Optimus Prime. This particular toy has been reissued multiple times; mostly to commemorate the anniversary of the Transformers franchise. Optimus Prime was also released as an [[Action Master]] and [[Powermaster]] toy in the original Transformers toy line. The original Optimus Prime toy was altered somewhat and an electronic sound maker was added for the ''Generation 2'' toy line.<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=mbTUorcuXkoC&pg=PA321&dq=%22generation+2%22+transformers&hl=en&ei=woyoTPq8KI7hnQeIwOWjDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22generation%202%22%20transformers&f=false The African American entrepreneur: then and now By W. Sherman Rogers page 321</ref> Later ''Generation 2'' toys for Optimus were completely new toys, such as Combat Hero Optimus Prime, Laser Optimus Prime and [[Gobot]] Optimus Prime, who became a red [[Lamborgini]] car. In 2003, Takara introduced the [[Transformers: Masterpiece|Masterpiece]] MP-01 Convoy/Optimus Prime. While retaining the original concept of a transforming semi-trailer truck, this [[Die-cast toy|die-cast figure]] incorporated modern toy manufacturing techniques for improved detail and articulation, while at the same time, captured the look of the cartoon character. It has since been released by both [[Hasbro]] and [[Takara Tomy]] in different variations. In 2006 Hasbro introduced ''Alternators'' Optimus Prime, which turned into a licensed 1:24 scale model Dodge Ram SRT-10. <ref>{{Cite book | title=Transformers: The Fantasy, The Fun, The Future| last=Brereton | first=Erin | year=2006 | publisher=Triumph Books| ISBN=1572439831 | page= 7}}</ref> In 2010 a version of the Masterpiece toy called Masterpiece Convoy Sleep Mode was released, painted in dark colors to match the appearance of Optimus Prime after his death in the 1986 film.<ref>Masterpiece Convoy Sleep Mode, Lee's Toy Review magazine issue #213, Fall 2010, page 14</ref> {{-}} ==Other merchandise== Optimus Prime, Ironhide and Grimlock are the three Autobot figures available to play in the [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] Transformers Collectors Edition game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.80stees.com/products/Transformers-Monopoly.asp |title=Collectors Edition Transformers Monopoly |publisher=80stees.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref> As the figurehead of the entire Transformers franchise, Optimus Prime has been on more pieces of merchandise than one can comfortably count, with one of the most outrageous being the "Optimus Prime Oral Care Station". Several statues and busts of Prime have been released by various companies since the return of Transformers to prominence, and other figures released include various PVCs as part of Takara's "Super Collection Figure" line, which were later imported as part of Hasbro's "[[Heroes of Cybertron]]" series. Larger "Mega Collection Figure" PVCs were articulated and came with energy axe and gun figures. ==Video games== {{Incomplete|date=August 2009}} Optimus Prime has appeared in numerous [[List of Transformers video games|''Transformers'' video games]]: *Prime is one of the playable characters in the 2003 Japan-only ''[[Transformers (2003 video game)|Transformers]]'' game for the [[PlayStation 2]]. *He is a regular character in the [[Nintendo GameCube]] and PlayStation 2 [[fighting game]] ''[[DreamMix TV World Fighters]]''. *He makes a cameo in the ''Beast Wars Transmetals'' video game, where he is killed by [[Megatron (Beast Era)|Megatron]] in his story mode ending, which displays what would have happened in the ''Beast Wars'' series with a [[Predacon]] victory. *Prime is also playable in Hasbro's [[Net Jet]] ''Transformers'' fighting game ''Transformers Battle Universe''.
