repetition == {{See also|multiset coefficient}} A ''k''-'''combination with repetitions''', or ''k''-'''multicombination''', or '''multiset''' of size ''k'' from a set ''S'' is given by a sequence of ''k'' not necessarily distinct elements of ''S'', where order is not taken into account: two sequences of which one can be obtained from the other by permuting the terms define the same multiset. If ''S'' has ''n'' elements, the number of such ''k''-multicombinations is also given by a [[binomial coefficient]], namely by :<math>\binom{n + k - 1}{k} = \binom{n + k - 1}{n - 1}</math> (the case where both ''n'' and ''k'' are zero is special; the correct value 1 (for the empty 0-multicombination) is given by left hand side <math>\tbinom{-1}0</math>, but not by the right hand side <math>\tbinom{-1}{-1}</math>). === Example of counting multicombinations === For example, if you have ten types of donuts (''n'' = 10) on a menu to choose from and you want three donuts (''k'' = 3), the number of ways to choose can be calculated as :<math>\binom{10+3-1}3 = \binom{12}3 = \frac{12\times11\times10}{3\times2\times1} = 220.</math> The analogy with the ''k''-combination case can be stressed by writing the binomial coefficient using a [[rising factorial power]] :<math>\binom{n + k - 1}{k} = \frac{n^{(k)}}{k!} = \frac{n(n+1)\cdots(n+k-1)}{k(k-1)\cdots1}.</math> There is an easy way to understand the above result. Label the elements of ''S'' with numbers 0, 1, ..., {{nowrap|''n'' − 1}}, and choose a ''k''-combination from the set of numbers { 1, 2, ..., {{nowrap|''n'' + ''k'' − 1}} } (so that there are {{nowrap|''n'' − 1}} ''unchosen'' numbers). Now change this ''k''-combination into a ''k''-multicombination of ''S'' by replacing every (chosen) number ''x'' in the ''k''-combination by the element of ''S'' labeled by the ''number of unchosen numbers'' less than ''x''. This is always a number in the range of the labels, and it is easy to see that every ''k''-multicombination of ''S'' is obtained for one choice of a ''k''-combination. A concrete example may be helpful. Suppose there are 4 types of fruits (apple, orange, pear, banana) at a grocery store, and you want to buy 12 pieces of fruit. So ''n'' = 4 and ''k'' = 12. Use label 0 for apples, 1 for oranges, 2 for pears, and 3 for bananas. A selection of 12 fruits can be translated into a selection of 12 distinct numbers in the range 1,...,15 by selecting as many consecutive numbers starting from 1 as there are apples in the selection, then skip a number, continue choosing as many consecutive numbers as there are oranges selected, again skip a number, then again for pears, skip one again, and finally choose the remaining numbers (as many as there are bananas selected). For instance for 2 apples, 7 oranges, 0 pears and 3 bananas, the numbers chosen will be 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15. To recover the fruits, the numbers 1, 2 (not preceded by any unchosen numbers) are replaced by apples, the numbers 4, 5, ..., 10 (preceded by one unchosen number: 3) by oranges, and the numbers 13, 14, 15 (preceded by three unchosen numbers: 3, 11, and 12) by bananas; there are no chosen numbers preceded by exactly 2 unchosen numbers, and therefore no pears in the selection. The total number of possible selections is :<math>\binom{12+4-1}{12} = \binom{15}{12} = \binom{15}3 = \frac{15\times14\times13}{3\times2\times1} = 455. </math> == Number of ''k''-combinations for all k == {{See also|Binomial coefficient#Sum of coefficients row}} The number of ''k''-combinations for all ''k'', <math>\sum_{0\leq{k}\leq{n}}\binom nk = 2^n</math>, is the sum of the ''n''th row (counting from 0) of the [[Binomial coefficient#Sum of coefficients row|binomial coefficients]]. These combinations are enumerated by the 1 digits of the set of [[base 2]] numbers counting from 0 to <math>2^n - 1</math>, where each digit position is an item from the set of ''n''. ==See also== {{colbegin|colwidth=30em}} * [[Combinatorial number system]] * [[Combinatorics]] * [[Multiset]] * [[Binomial coefficient]] * [[Permutation]] * [[List of permutation topics]] * [[Subset]] * [[Probability]] * [[Pascal's Triangle]] {{colend}} ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://compprog.wordpress.com/2007/10/17/generating-combinations-1/ C code to generate all combinations of n elements chosen as k] * [http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/sets/high_perms_combs.html Many Common types of permutation and combination math problems, with detailed solutions] * [http://www.murderousmaths.co.uk/books/unknownform.htm The Unknown Formula] For combinations when choices can be repeated and order does NOT matter *[http://www.nitte.ac.in/userfiles/file/Combinations%20with%20Repetitions.pdf] Combinations with repetitions (by: Akshatha AG and Smitha B) [[Category:Combinatorics]] [[ar:توافيق]] [[bg:Комбинация (математика)]] [[cs:Kombinace]] [[eo:Kombinaĵo (kombinatoriko)]] [[fa:ترکیب (ریاضی)]] [[fr:Combinaison (mathématiques)]] [[ko:조합]] [[hy:Ընտրույթ]] [[hi:संचय (गणित)]] [[id:Kombinasi]] [[it:Combinazione]] [[lv:Kombinācija]] [[lt:Deriniai]] [[hu:Kombináció]] [[nl:Combinatie (wiskunde)]] [[ja:組合せ (数学)]] [[pl:Kombinacja bez powtórzeń]] [[pt:Combinação (matemática)]] [[ru:Сочетание]] [[sq:Kombinimi]] [[sk:Kombinácia (kombinatorika)]] [[sl:Kombinacija (matematika)]] [[sr:Комбинација]] [[fi:Kombinaatio]] [[sv:Kombination (matematik)]] [[ta:சேர்வு (கணிதம்)]] [[th:การจัดหมู่]] [[tr:Kombinasyon]] [[uk:Комбінації з n по k]] [[ur:تولیف]] [[zh:組合]]</text> </page> <page> <id>6925</id> <title>Combinatorial class</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}} In [[combinatorics]], a '''combinatorial class''' (or simply '''class''') is an [[equivalence class]] of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] that have the same counting sequence. Although the elements of these equivalent sets may have very different definitions and semantics, combinatorics is concerned only with the number of elements of a given size. Therefore, knowledge about one set in the class can be applied directly to other sets in the class. For example, the set of [[triangulation]]s of [[polygon]]s is ''combinatorially [[isomorphic]]'' to the set of general [[rooted plane tree]]s. Although these sets certainly describe different things, they have the same counting sequence, namely the [[Catalan number]]s. ==See also== * [[double counting (proof technique)|double counting]] * [[combinatorial species]]. {{DEFAULTSORT:Combinatorial Class}} [[Category:Combinatorics]] [[ca:Classe combinatòria]]</text> </page> <page> <id>6934</id> <title>Combinatorica</title> <text>'''''Combinatorica''''' is an international journal of [[mathematics]], publishing papers in the fields of [[combinatorics]] and [[computer science]].
