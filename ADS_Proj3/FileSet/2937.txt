OS software has improved the operator interface and speed of execution, while reducing OS failures. == Applications and computer type == There are many types of small computers used in the military. Recently there has been an increase in the implementation of [[thin client]] technology in many applications that don't require full computing capability. Thin client technology reduces costs and eliminates some of the risks of placing more complex computers in rugged situations. Embedded computers are being integrated into more applications. These computers are generally fixed-function computers that are robust and bring additional capabilities to machines or complex equipment. Notebooks and [[laptop]]s have become more rugged since the turn of the century, and more portable computers are being placed into warfighter's hands than ever before. A number of manufacturers are specializing in creating ultra-rugged notebooks for the military. Now, some of these advances created for the military are finding their way backward into the home and business markets. Wireless communications technology has also improved in recent years. High-speed data transferral over secure, encrypted frequencies is consider a new standard for standard-security-level communications. The new wireless radio networking devices can establish a link between systems that could otherwise not physically communicate or be involved in command and control. Some thin clients and portable computers employ these recent advances. == Future computer use in the military == In the last 20 years, wide acceptance of small-scale computer technology in the military has occurred, and is likely to increase greatly. Confidence has improved in the ability of equipment to withstand combat and extreme environment conditions. Most importantly, modern combat has become a duel of speed. We continually see that faster and more technologically advanced weaponry demonstrates first-strike capability in current combat situations, which is likely only to encourage further implementation of computer technology into systems used in the US Armed Forces in the future. ==See also== * [[Hardened computer]] * [[Secure cryptoprocessor]]s * [[Gun data computer]] ==References== <references /> [[Category:Military technology]] [[Category:Military computers]]</text> </page> <page> <id>24579</id> <title>MilkShape 3D</title> <text>{{Infobox Software | name = Milkshape 3D | screenshot = [[Image:Milkshape179.PNG|250px]] | caption = Screenshot of Milkshape 3D 1.7.9 | developer = [[Mete Ciragan]] | latest_release_version = 1.8.5 BETA 1 | latest_release_date = July 08, 2009 | operating_system = [[Microsoft Windows]] | download = http://chumbalum.swissquake.ch/ms3d/download.html/ | genre = [[3D computer graphics]] | website = http://chumbalum.swissquake.ch/ }} '''MilkShape 3D''' (MS3D) is a [[Shareware]] low [[polygon]] [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[model (computer games)|modelling]] program created by Mete Ciragan. It is used mainly by people compiling [[model (computer games)|models]] for ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'', ''[[Blockland]]'', ''[[The Sims 2]]'', ''[[The Sims 3]]'' and other sandbox [[Video game|games]]. Milkshape 3D's repertoire of export capabilities has been extended considerably, due to the efforts of both its creator and the community around it, and it is now able to be used for most games today, so long as an [[exporter (computing)|exporter]] for the required format is available. == History == MilkShape 3D was created by [[chUmbaLum sOft]], a small software company in Zurich, Switzerland, which was established in the autumn of 1996. chUmbaLum sOft develops 3D tools for games and other applications. MilkShape 3D was originally created as a [[low poly]] modelling program by Mete Ciragan for the [[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]] engine. Over time many features were added as were many export formats. Though not as advanced as other leading 3D modelling programs, it remains effective for the user because it is simple and cost-effective. == Features == MilkShape 3D has all basic operations like select, move, rotate, scale, extrude, turn edge, subdivide, just to mention a few. MilkShape 3D also allows low-level editing with the vertex and face tool. Standard and extended primitives like spheres, boxes, and cylinders are available. Milkshape 3D can export to over 70 file formats. MilkShape 3D is a skeletal animator. This allows export to morph target animation like the ones in the Quake model formats or to export to skeletal animations like Half-Life, [[Genesis3D]], [[Unreal]], etc. The amount of file types that the program can support features all major 3D game engines from [[Source Engine|Source]], to [[Unreal Engine|Unreal]], to [[id Tech]], to [[Lithtech]]. It has become known as a useful converter from one format to another. == Controversy == Old versions of MilkShape 3D (older than 1.8.1beta1, May 2007) allegedly contained code which caused itself to shutdown if it detected certain other programs running on the computer, such as Registry Monitor. Versions older than 1.6.5 (April 2003) <ref>[http://chumbalum.swissquake.ch/ms3d/Release%20Notes.txt MilkShape 3D Release Notes]</ref> would go so far as to shut down the offending program and prevent it from being run again while MilkShape 3D was still running. This problem was resolved, right after this issue has been pointed out. Ostensibly, this was to prevent users from figuring out how to edit the Windows registry to [[software cracking|pirate]] the MilkShape 3D application without paying for it. However, there was no [[EULA|End User License Agreement]] until version 1.8.1, which authorized the program to do this. The unlock process itself was rather confusing, because the second and third code parts were checked within the two minutes after restarting MilkShape 3D. This made it possible to enter invalid second and third code parts, which lead to a two minutes message loop. So even with a legitimate, but mistyped license key, it was possible to have an unregistered copy of MilkShape 3D. This could be easily fixed by entering the license correctly. A number of users have therefore accused MilkShape 3D of essentially being [[spyware]], and many have boycotted it. Also, older versions of Milkshape could be used after the trial period by repeatedly altering the system date to trick the program out of trial mode.<ref>[http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/4/8/11832/69816 Milkshape does what it wants, with no EULA]</ref> All issues mentioned here have been resolved since version 1.8.1beta2 (May 2007). == MilkShape 3D file format == The native file format for MilkShape 3D-models is the ''ms3d''-format. This file format is structured in the following way: * Header ** "MS3D000000" followed by version number (ver. 3 or 4) *
