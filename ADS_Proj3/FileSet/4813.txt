procurement of software and hardware, but in staffing costs and downtime. While the report applied a 40% productivity factor during IT infrastructure downtime, recognizing that employees are not entirely unproductive, it did not consider the impact of downtime on the profitability of the business. The report stated that Linux servers had less unplanned downtime than Windows 2000 servers. It found that most Linux servers ran less workload per server than Windows 2000 servers and also that none of the businesses interviewed used 4-way [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]] Linux computers. The report also did not take into account specific [[application server]]s â€” servers that need low maintenance and are provided by a specific vendor. The report did emphasize that TCO was only one factor in considering whether to use a particular IT platform, and also noted that as management and server software improved and became better packaged the overall picture shown could change.<ref>"[http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/docs/TCO.pdf Windows 2000 Versus Linux in Enterprise Computing]", ''IDC''.</ref> == Service packs == Windows 2000 has received four full [[service pack]]s and one rollup update package following SP4, which is the last service pack. These were: SP1 on 15 August 2000, SP2 on 16 May 2001, SP3 on 29 August 2002 and SP4 on 26 June 2003. Microsoft phased out all development of its [[Java Virtual Machine]] (JVM) from Windows 2000 in SP3. Internet Explorer 5.01 has also been upgraded to the corresponding service pack level. Microsoft had originally intended to release a fifth service pack for Windows 2000, but Microsoft cancelled this project early in its development, and instead released Update Rollup 1 for SP4, a collection of all the security-related [[hotfix]]es and some other significant issues.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Windows/Microsoft-Scraps-Plans-for-Windows-2000-SP5/ |title=Microsoft Scraps Plans for Windows 2000 SP5 |last=Naraine |first=Ryan |date=26 November 2004 |accessdate=2009-05-30 }}</ref> The Update Rollup does not include all non-security related hotfixes and is not subjected to the same extensive regression testing as a full service pack. Microsoft states that this update will meet customers' needs better than a whole new service pack, and will still help Windows 2000 customers secure their PCs, reduce support costs, and support existing [[computer hardware]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/server/evaluation/news/bulletins/rollup.mspx |title=Windows 2000 Update Rollup 1 for Service Pack 4|accessdate=2006-09-27|publisher=Microsoft |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060113110336/http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/server/evaluation/news/bulletins/rollup.mspx |archivedate = 2006-01-13}}</ref> == Support lifecycle == Windows 2000 has now been superseded by newer Microsoft operating systems: Windows 2000 Server products by [[Windows Server 2003]], and Windows 2000 Professional by [[Windows XP|Windows XP Professional]]. The Windows 2000 family of operating systems moved from mainstream support to the extended support phase on 30 June 2005. Microsoft says that this marks the progression of Windows 2000 through the Windows lifecycle policy. Under mainstream support, Microsoft freely provides design changes if any, service packs and non-security related updates in addition to security updates, whereas in extended support, service packs are not provided and non-security updates require contacting the support personnel by e-mail or phone. Under the extended support phase, Microsoft continued to provide critical security updates every month for all components of Windows 2000 (including Internet Explorer 5.0 SP4) and paid per-incident support for technical issues. Because of Windows 2000's age, updated versions of components such as [[Windows Media Player 11]] and [[Internet Explorer 7]] have not been released for it. In the case of Internet Explorer, Microsoft said in 2005 that, "some of the security work in IE 7 relies on operating system functionality in XP SP2 that is non-trivial to port back to Windows 2000."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.com.com/Windows+2000+users+to+miss+out+on+IE+7/2100-1032_3-5729544.html|title=Windows 2000 users to miss out on IE 7|accessdate=2007-01-11|publisher=news.com}}</ref> While users of Windows 2000 Professional and Server are eligible to receive the upgrade license for Windows Vista Business or Windows Server 2008, neither of these operating systems can directly perform an upgrade installation from Windows 2000; a clean installation must be performed instead or a two-step upgrade thru XP/2003. Microsoft has dropped the upgrade path from Windows 2000 (and earlier) to Windows 7. Users of Windows 2000 must buy a full Windows 7 license. Although Windows 2000 is the last NT-based version of Microsoft Windows which does not include [[Windows Product Activation]], Microsoft has introduced [[Windows Genuine Advantage]] for certain downloads and non-critical updates from the Download Center for Windows 2000. Windows 2000 reached the end of its lifecycle on 13 July 2010. It will not receive new security updates and new security-related hotfixes after this date.<ref name=Lifecycle>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/search/?sort=PN&alpha=Windows+2000&Filter=FilterNO|title=Microsoft Product Lifecycle for Windows 2000 family}}</ref><ref name=Support>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/server/evaluation/news/bulletins/extendedsupport.mspx|title=Windows 2000 Transitions to Extended Support}}</ref> In Japan over 130,000 servers and 500,000 PCs in local governments are affected; many local governments said that they will not update as they do not have funds to cover a replacement.<ref>"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100820a7.html]."
