Likewise, the line beginning <code>A(printf(</code> has been broken into multiple lines. After eliminating comments, the essence of this method is: <source lang="c"> #define B(x) x; printf("{ B(" #x ") }\n"); int main() { B(printf("#define B(x) x; printf(\"{ B(\" #x \") }\\n\");\nint main()\n")) } </source> Here the <code>B</code> macro has been slightly altered, so that it produces a pair of braces around its invocation. This eliminates the need for an <code>A</code> macro. An even shorter, classic,<ref>[http://www.nyx.net/~gthompso/quine.htm The Quine Page]</ref> approach in C instead exploits the ability of the <code>printf</code> function to use a [[format string]], passing a carefully-constructed string as both the format string and a substitution parameter. Note: 34 is the ASCII code for a double-quote character, and is used to avoid the need to quote the double-quotes in the string literal. <source lang='c'> main() { char *s="main() { char *s=%c%s%c; printf(s,34,s,34); }"; printf(s,34,s,34); } </source> This program uses the <code>[[printf]]</code> function without including its corresponding header (<code>#include <[[stdio.h]]></code>), which can result in [[undefined behavior]]. Also, the return type declaration for main has been left off to reduce the length of the program. <!-- DO NOT ADD ANY MORE QUINE EXAMPLES! Please read the talk page. --> ===Scheme (also valid Common Lisp)=== This quine works by feeding the program to itself, which then converts the data structure to source code. <source lang="scheme"> ((lambda (x) (list x (list 'quote x))) (quote (lambda (x) (list x (list 'quote x))))) </source> The example mentioned above is not absolutely correct, because it does not have [[output]] operators. The correct example is: <source lang="scheme"> (progn (setf a "(progn (setf a ~S) (format t a a))") (format t a a)) </source> <!-- DO NOT ADD ANY MORE QUINE EXAMPLES!

Additionally, users can comment on the questions and answers and "upvote" or "downvote" the answers. An "Answer Summary" can be created to reflect the consensus of the community. This summary is a wiki that can be edited by any registered user.
