By using a metafile to invoke a historic form of some printer management functions, Windows GDI could be tricked into executing data from the WMF file as code. It was assessed and classified as critical. This vulnerability was resolved in a security update on January 5, 2006 on Microsoft TechNet (MS06-001) and generally released January 10, 2006. Details can be found in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article "Vulnerability in Graphics Rendering Engine Could Allow Remote Code Execution" (912919). It was also referred to as the WMF (Windows Meta File) vulnerability. Security expert Steve Gibson did a thorough analysis of the WMF vulnerability and reached the conclusion that it had been included intentionally by Microsoft as a "backdoor" for whatever reason. Hence, the idea that hackers used a bug is erroneous. What hackers did was just discovering existing but - thus far - undisclosed functionality. The discovery was presented in issue 22 of Security Now.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.grc.com/securitynow.htm#22 | title=Security Now, Issue #22, The Windows Metafile Backdoor? | quote='''' | author=Steve Gibson | accessdate=2010-06-11}}</ref>. This claim has been challenged by Microsoft employee and Windows expert [[Mark Russinovich]]. <ref> [http://blogs.technet.com/b/markrussinovich/archive/2006/01/18/inside-the-wmf-backdoor.aspx "Inside the WMF Backdoor"]</ref> == Alternative implementations == The WMF format was designed to be executed by the Windows GDI layer in order to restore the [[image]], but as the WMF binary files contain the definition of the GDI graphic primitives that constitute this image, it is possible to design alternative libraries that render WMF binary files, or convert them into other graphic formats. For example, the [[Batik (software)|Batik]] library is able to render WMF files and convert them to their [[Scalable Vector Graphics]] (SVG) equivalent. The Vector Graphics package of the [[FreeHEP]] Java library allows the saving of [[Java2D]] drawings as EMF files. EMZ is an EMF file compressed with [[gzip]]. == See also == * [[Vector Markup Language]] * [[Scalable Vector Graphics]] * [[PostScript]] * [[STDU Viewer]] == References == {{Reflist|2}} == External links == {{External links|date=May 2009}} === Tutorials and articles === * [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc215212.aspx Windows Metafile Format Specification from Microsoft] * [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc204166.aspx Enhanced Metafile Format Specification from Microsoft] * [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc230724(PROT.13).aspx Enhanced Metafile Format Plus Extensions Specification from Microsoft] * [http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/gdi/metafile_0hmb.asp Windows GDI] * [http://www.fileformat.info/format/wmf/ File Format Summary at fileformat.info] * [http://wvware.sourceforge.net/caolan/index.html WMF operand documentation] * [http://www.companionsoftware.com/PR/WMRC/WindowsMetafileFaq.html Windows Metafile FAQ] * [http://www.undocprint.org/formats/winspool/emf EMF/EMF+/EMZ Information at the Undocumented Printing Wiki] === Libraries === * [[Batik (software)|Batik]] Java library : the [http://xml.apache.org/batik/javadoc/org/apache/batik/transcoder/wmf/tosvg/package-summary.html WMF to SVG transcoder package] can convert WMF Metafiles to [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] * [[FreeHEP]] Java library : the [http://java.freehep.org/freehep1.x/vectorgraphics/index.html Vector graphics package] can convert EMF Metafiles to SVG, or Java2D drawings to EMF * [http://wvware.sourceforge.net/libwmf.html libWMF], a library for reading WMF Metafiles, which is able to display them or convert them to [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] * [http://libemf.sourceforge.net/ libEMF], a C/C++ library which provides a drawing toolkit to create vector graphics files on [[POSIX]] systems * [http://www.blackdirt.com/graphics/svg/ wmf2svg], a small Java class to convert WMF Metafiles to [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] * [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=51669&package_id=58464 Pixie] Java library * [http://pyemf.sourceforge.net/ pyemf] Python library : pyemf can create EMF metafiles * [http://www.aspose.com/categories/file-format-components/aspose.metafiles-for-java/default.aspx Aspose.Metafiles] : A Java library for managing metafiles. * [http://www.wmf2wpf.com/ wmf2wpf], a .net application and library to convert WMF Metafiles to WPF ([[XAML]]) {{Graphics file formats}} [[Category:Graphics file formats]] [[Category:Vector graphics]] [[Category:Microsoft Windows multimedia technology]] [[bs:Windows Metafile]] [[de:Windows Metafile]] [[es:Metaarchivo de Windows]] [[eu:Windows Metafile]] [[fr:Windows Metafile]] [[it:Windows Metafile]] [[ja:Windows Metafile]] [[pl:Windows Metafile]] [[pt:Windows Metafile]] [[ru:Windows Metafile]] [[sv:Windows Metafile]] [[tr:Windows Metafile]] [[zh:WMF]]</text> </page> <page> <id>40307</id> <title>Windows Mobile Device Center</title> <text>{{Infobox Windows component | name = Windows Mobile Device Center | logo = Windows Mobile Device Center logo.png | screenshot = | caption = | included_with = | replaces = [[Microsoft ActiveSync]] | replaced_by = | related_components = }} '''Windows Mobile Device Center''' is a synchronization [[software]] program developed by [[Microsoft]], and the successor to [[ActiveSync]].
