of filtering network data between a host or a network and another network, such as the [[Internet]], and can be implemented as software running on the machine, hooking into the [[network stack]] (or, in the case of most [[UNIX]]-based operating systems such as [[Linux]], built into the operating system [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]]) to provide realtime filtering and blocking. Another implementation is a so called [[physical firewall]] which consists of a separate machine filtering network traffic. Firewalls are common amongst machines that are permanently connected to the [[Internet]]. However, relatively few organisations maintain computer systems with effective detection systems, and fewer still have organised response mechanisms in place. ===Difficulty with response=== Responding forcefully to attempted [[security breaches]] (in the manner that one would for attempted physical security breaches) is often very difficult for a variety of reasons: * Identifying attackers is difficult, as they are often in a different [[jurisdiction]] to the systems they attempt to breach, and operate through proxies, temporary anonymous dial-up accounts, wireless connections, and other anonymising procedures which make backtracing difficult and are often located in yet another jurisdiction. If they successfully breach security, they are often able to delete [[Data logging|log]]s to cover their tracks. * The sheer number of attempted attacks is so large that organisations cannot spend time pursuing each attacker (a typical home user with a permanent (e.g., [[cable modem]]) connection will be attacked at least several times per day, so more attractive targets could be presumed to see many more). Note however, that most of the sheer bulk of these attacks are made by automated vulnerability scanners and [[computer worms]]. * [[Law enforcement officer]]s are often unfamiliar with [[information technology]], and so lack the skills and interest in pursuing attackers. There are also budgetary constraints. It has been argued that the high cost of technology, such as [[DNA]] testing, and improved [[forensics]] mean less money for other kinds of law enforcement, so the overall rate of criminals not getting dealt with goes up as the cost of the technology increases. In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a [[network administrator]] or a [[system administrator]]) requires a [[search warrant]] and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant. == See also == === Lists and categories === * [[:Category:Computer security exploits]] — Types of computer security vulnerabilities and attacks * [[:Category:Spyware removal]] — Programs that find and remove spyware * [[List of computer virus hoaxes]] * [[List of computer viruses]] * [[List of trojan horses]] * [[Timeline of notable computer viruses and worms]] === Individual articles === {{multicol}} * [[Adware]] * [[Antivirus software]] * [[Black hat]] * [[Computer forensics]] * [[Computer virus]] * [[Crash-only software]] * [[Cryptography]] * [[Data remanence]] * [[Data spill]] * [[Defensive computing]] * [[Defensive programming]] {{multicol-break}} * [[Exploit (computer security)]] * [[Full disclosure]] * [[Hack (technology slang)|Hacking]] * [[Malware]] * [[Mangled packet]] * [[Microreboot]] * [[Penetration test]] * [[Physical security]] * [[Ring (computer security)]] * [[RISKS Digest]] * [[Security engineering]] {{multicol-break}} * [[Security through obscurity]] * [[Software Security Assurance]] * [[Spam (electronic)|Spam]] * [[Targeted threat]] * [[Threat (computer)]] * [[Virus hoax]] * [[Vulnerability (computing)]] * [[Computer worm|Worm]] * [[XSA]] * [[Zero-day attack]] {{multicol-end}} == References == {{reflist}} ==Further reading== * [[Ross J.

Physically, a port is a specialized outlet on a piece of equipment to which a [[Electrical connector|plug]] or [[cable]] connects. Electronically, the several conductors making up the outlet provide a signal transfer between devices. The term "port" is derived from a Latin word "porta" (gate, entrance, door). == Physical shape == Hardware ports may be physically [[gender of connectors and fasteners|male or female]], but female ports are much more common. Computer ports in common use cover a wide variety of shapes such as round ([[PS/2
