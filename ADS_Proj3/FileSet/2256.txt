inventory worth US $2.25 billion due to duplicate orders.<ref>{{cite web|last=Armony |first=Mor |title=The Impact of Duplicate Orders on Demand Estimation and Capacity Investment |url=http://ormstomorrow.informs.org/archive/Summerfall06/TheImpactOfDuplicateOrders.pdf}}</ref> This is one of the biggest inventory write-offs in business history. ==Inventory credit== Inventory credit refers to the use of stock, or inventory, as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] to raise finance. Where banks may be reluctant to accept traditional collateral, for example in [[developing countries]] where [[land registration|land title]] may be lacking, inventory credit is a potentially important way of overcoming financing constraints. This is not a new concept; archaeological evidence suggests that it was practiced in Ancient Rome. Obtaining finance against stocks of a wide range of products held in a [[bonded warehouse]] is common in much of the world. It is, for example, used with Parmesan cheese in Italy.<ref>Italian Notebook.com [http://www.italiannotebook.com/local-interest/parmigiano-hedge/]"Who moved my parmigiano?" 24 February 2009</ref> Inventory credit on the basis of stored agricultural produce is widely used in Latin American countries and in some Asian countries.<ref>Jonathan Coulter and Andrew W. Shepherd [http://www.fao.org/docrep/v7470e/v7470e00.htm], Inventory Credit – An approach to developing agricultural markets, FAO, Rome, 1995</ref> A precondition for such credit is that banks must be confident that the stored product will be available if they need to call on the collateral; this implies the existence of a reliable network of certified warehouses. Banks also face problems in valuing the inventory. The possibility of sudden falls in commodity prices means that they are usually reluctant to lend more than about 60% of the value of the inventory at the time of the loan. ==See also== * [[Cash conversion cycle]] * [[Consignment stock]] * [[Cost of goods sold]] * [[Economic order quantity]] * [[Inventory investment]] * [[Inventory management software]] * [[Operations research]] * [[Pinch point (economics)]] * [[Service level]] * [[Spare part]] * [[Stock management]] ==References== {{Reflist}} {{Refimprove|date=March 2008}} ==Further reading== * [http://www.inventorymatters.co.uk/portfolio/the-first-steps-to-inventory-management?type=publication The First Steps to Inventory Management] * [http://www.articlesbook.com/inventory-control-techniques/ Inventory Control Techniques] *{{Cite book | title = Intermediate Accounting 8th Canadian Edition | last = Kieso | first = , DE | isbn = 047015313X | coauthors = Warfield, TD; Weygandt, JJ | publisher = [[John Wiley & Sons]] | location = Canada | year = 2007 }} * [http://www.inventorymatters.co.uk/portfolio/professional-inventory-management?type=publication Professional Inventory Management] * Tempelmeier, Horst, ''Inventory Management in Supply Networks'', Norderstedt (Books on Demand) 2006, ISBN 3-8334-5373-7 * [http://www.inventorymatters.co.uk/portfolio/extending-the-pareto-principle-to-mrp-controlled-parts-and-regaining-mrp-control?type=publication Extending the Pareto Principle to MRP Controlled Parts and Regaining MRP Control] * [http://www.mypivots.com/Investopedia/Details/330/business-inventories Business Inventories monthly report] * [http://sourceforge.net/projects/stockmanagement/] * [http://www.clearlyinventory.com/education/inventory-management.html A very basic guide to setting up an inventory system.] * [http://home.comcast.net/~raagnew/site/?/page/Downloads Optimizing Retail Inventory Service Level & Turnover in Excel] * Cannella S., Ciancimino E.

Inverse limits can be defined in any [[category (mathematics)|category]]. == Formal definition == === Algebraic objects === We start with the definition of an '''inverse''' (or '''projective''') '''system''' of [[group (mathematics)|groups]] and [[group homomorphism|homomorphisms]]. Let (''I'', &le;) be a [[directed set|directed]] [[poset]] (not all authors require ''I'' to be directed). Let (''A''<sub>''i''</sub>)<sub>''i''&isin;''I''</sub> be a [[family (mathematics)|family]] of groups and suppose we have a family of homomorphisms ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub>: ''A''<sub>''j''</sub> &rarr; ''A''<sub>''i''</sub> for all ''i'' &le; ''j'' (note the order) with the following properties: # ''f''<sub>''ii''</sub> is the identity in ''A''<sub>''i''</sub>, # ''f''<sub>''ik''</sub> = ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub> <small>o</small> ''f''<sub>''jk''</sub> for all ''i'' &le; ''j'' &le; ''k''. Then the pair ((''A''<sub>''i''</sub>)<sub>''i''&isin;''I''</sub>, (''f''<sub>''ij''</sub>)<sub>''i''&le; ''j''&isin;''I''</sub>) is called an inverse system of groups and morphisms over ''I'', and the morphisms ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub> are called the transition morphisms of the system. We define the '''inverse limit''' of the inverse system ((''A''<sub>''i''</sub>)<sub>''i''&isin;''I''</sub>, (''f''<sub>''ij''</sub>)<sub>''i''&le; ''j''&isin;''I''</sub>) as a particular [[subgroup]] of the [[direct product]] of the ''A''<sub>''i''</sub>'s: :<math>\varprojlim_{i\in I} A_i = \Big\{\vec a \in \prod_{i\in I}A_i \;\Big|\; a_i = f_{ij}(a_j) \mbox{ for all } i \leq j \mbox{ in } I\Big\}.</math> The inverse limit, ''A'', comes equipped with ''natural projections'' &pi;<sub>''i''</sub>: ''A'' &rarr; ''A''<sub>''i''</sub> which pick out the ''i''th component of the direct product for each ''i'' in ''I''. The inverse limit and the natural projections satisfy a [[universal property]] described in the next section. This same construction may be carried out if the ''A''<sub>''i''</sub>'s are [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[module (mathematics)|modules]] (over a fixed ring), [[algebra over a field|algebras]] (over a fixed field), etc., and the [[homomorphism]]s are homomorphisms in the corresponding [[category theory|category]]. The inverse limit will also belong to that category. === General definition === The inverse limit can be defined
