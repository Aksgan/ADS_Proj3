The Gallium3D library operates as a layer between the graphics [[Application programming interface|API]] and the [[operating system]] with the primary goal of making driver development easier, bundling otherwise duplicated code of several different drivers at a single point (this is done by providing a better division of labor, for example, leaving memory management to the kernel [[Direct Rendering Infrastructure|DRI]] driver) and to support modern hardware architectures. Gallium3D has been a part of [[Mesa 3D (OpenGL)|Mesa]] since 2009<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=NzA1Ng |title = Gallium3D Now In Mainline Mesa Code-Base! |publisher = [[Phoronix]] |date = 2009-02-11 |accessdate = 2010-10-26 }}</ref> and is currently used by the [[free and open source]] graphics driver for [[Nvidia]] ([[nouveau (graphics)|nouveau]] project),<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://lwn.net/Articles/270830/ |title = The state of Nouveau, part 2 |publisher = [[LWN.net]] |date = 2008-02-26 |accessdate = 2008-03-07 }}</ref><ref name=companion-36>{{Cite web |url = http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/Nouveau_Companion_36 |title = Nouveau Companion 36 |datepublished = 2008-03-07 |accessdate = 2008-04-01 }}</ref> ATI [[Radeon|Radeon R300-R800]]<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=NzY4Ng |title = ATI R300 Gallium3D DRI Support Is "Done" |publisher = [[Phoronix]] |date = 2009-11-09 |accessdate = 2010-11-15 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=ODI5NQ |title = Radeon "R600g" Gallium3D Driver Merged To &#91;Mesa&#93; Master |publisher = [[Phoronix]] |date = 2010-05-27 |accessdate = 2010-10-26 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url = http://wiki.x.org/wiki/GalliumStatus |title = X.Org Wiki GalliumStatus |publisher = [[Xorg]] |date = 2010-09-22 |accessdate = 2010-12-07 }}</ref>and partially for Intel [[Graphics processing unit#Integrated graphics solutions|IGP]] driver too.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=ODE0OQ |title = Intel & The Shortcomings Of Gallium3D |publisher = [[Phoronix]] |date = 2010-04-13 |accessdate = 2010-10-26 }}</ref> == Differences from Mesa 3D == Gallium3D provides a unified [[Application programming interface|API]] exposing standard hardware functions, such as [[shader]] units found on modern hardware. Thus, 3D APIs such as [[OpenGL]] 1.x/2.x, OpenGL 3.x, [[OpenVG]], [[GPGPU]] infrastructure or even [[Direct3D]] (as found in the [[Wine (software)|Wine]] compatibility layer) will need only a single front-end, called a state tracker, targeting the Gallium3D API. By contrast, [[Mesa 3D]] requires a different back-end for each hardware platform and several other APIs need translation to OpenGL at the expense of added overhead.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.tungstengraphics.com/technologies/gallium3d.html |title = TG-Gallium3D |publisher = Tungsten Graphics |accessdate = 2008-04-01 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url = http://zrusin.blogspot.com/2008/02/gpgpu.html |title = GPGPU |author = zrusin |date = 2008-02-06 |accessdate = 2008-04-01 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url = http://zrusin.blogspot.com/2008/02/openvg-and-accelerating-2d.html |title = OpenVG and accelerating 2D |author = zrusin |datepublished = 2008-02-07 |accessdate = 2008-04-01 }}</ref> Under Gallium3D, [[Direct Rendering Manager]] (DRM) kernel drivers will manage the memory and [[Direct Rendering Infrastructure|Direct Rendering Interface]] (DRI2) drivers will be more GPU processing oriented.

The r300g driver for ati r300-r500 cards is considered stable at this time.
