This is because the formulas used to perform calculations within a spreadsheet (e.g., adding numbers in a column of cells) are simply removed in MS Excel 2007. Instead of performing the calculations, what is left is when the spreadsheet is loaded in MS Excel 2007 is the last value that cell had, when previously saved. The same test spreadsheet, when loaded and saved in all the other applications besides MS Excel 2007 (e.g., between KSpread and Google Docs), does process correctly. Most other ODF spreadsheet applications are able to interoperate just fine.

There are two issues: does the specification support accessibility, and are implementations accessible? ===Specification=== While the [[specification]] of OpenDocument is going through an extensive accessibility review, many of the components it is built on (such as [[Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language|SMIL]] for audio and multimedia and [[SVG]] for vector graphics) have already gone through the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C)'s [[Web Accessibility Initiative]] processes. There are already applications that currently read/write OpenDocument that export Tagged [[PDF]] files (to support PDF accessibility); this suggests that much or all of the necessary data for accessibility is already included in the OpenDocument format. The OASIS OpenDocument technical committee released a draft of OpenDocument 1.1 on 2006-07-27, for public comment through 2006-09-25.<ref>http://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/office/email/archives/200607/msg00114.html</ref> This is a very minor update to the specification to add accessibility information, mainly
