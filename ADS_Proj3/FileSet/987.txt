in, the sequence of lamps that lit yielded the [[plaintext]]. This of course required that the deciphering machine's plugboard and scrambler rotors had been set identically to those of the enciphering machine. This was achieved by a variety of key setting procedures, which varied from time to time and across different [[Telecommunications network|networks]]. They consisted of a combination of transmitting an ''[[Enigma machine#Indicator|indicator]]''<ref>Churchhouse (2002) pp. 33, 86</ref><ref>[[Peter Twinn|Twinn]] (1993) p. 129</ref> with the message, and ''setting sheets'' in a ''[[codebook]]''.<ref>{{ Citation | last = Sale | first = Tony | author-link = Anthony Sale | title = Military Use of the Enigma: The Message Key and Setting Sheets | series = Codes and Ciphers in the Second World War: The history, science and engineering of cryptanalysis in World War II | url = http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/enigma/enigma3.htm | accessdate = 21 October 2008 }} </ref><ref>{{Citation | last = Rijmenants | first = Dirk | title = Enigma Message Procedures | work = Cipher Machines and Cryptology | url = http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/enigmaproc.htm | accessdate = 19 November 2009 }}</ref> These were distributed to all users of a network<ref>Confusingly, the word ''key'' was also used at [[Bletchley Park]] to describe the network that used the same Enigma setting sheets.

This message key was itself enciphered on the machine using the ''indicator setting''. At first the indicator setting was specified as the ''ground key'' on the setting sheets, but later on, it was selected by the operator. The German Navy adopted a more complex and secure procedure on 1 May 1937 (see "[[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#German naval Enigma|German naval Enigma]]" below). The other users, however, continued with the insecure procedure of sending the message key twice, in case poor radio reception might have led to it being garbled. This was not changed until 10 May 1940.<ref>Gaj and Orłowski section 7 </ref> ===Security properties=== The various Enigma models provided different levels of security. The presence of a plugboard (''Steckerbrett'') substantially increased the security of the encipherment. Each pair of letters that were connected together by a plugboard lead, were referred to as ''stecker partners'', and the letters that remained unconnected were said to be ''self-steckered''.<ref>[[Jack Copeland|Copeland]] (2004) p. 245</ref> In general, the unsteckered Enigma was used for commercial and diplomatic traffic and could be broken relatively easily using hand methods, while attacking versions with a plugboard was much more difficult. The British read unsteckered Enigma messages sent during the [[Spanish Civil War]],<ref>[[Michael Smith (newspaper reporter)|Smith]] (2006) p. 23</ref> and also some [[Cryptanalysis_of_the_Enigma#Italian naval Enigma|Italian naval traffic]] enciphered early in World War II. The strength of the security of the ciphers that were produced by the Enigma machine was a product of the large numbers associated with the scrambling process. #It produced a polyalphabetic substitution cipher with a period (16,900) that was many times the length of the longest message. #The 3-rotor scrambler could be set in 26 × 26 × 26 = 17,576 ways, and the 4-rotor scrambler in 26 × 17,576 = 456,976 ways. #With six leads on the plugboard, the number of ways that pairs of letters could be interchanged was 100,391,791,500 (100 billion)<ref>Singh (1999) p. 136 </ref> and with ten leads, it was 150,738,274,937,250 (150 trillion).<ref>{{Citation | last = Sale | first = Tony | author-link = Anthony Sale | title = Military Use of the Enigma: The complexity of the Enigma machine | url = http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/enigma/enigma3.htm | accessdate = 2 June 2010 }}
