most of the time, so the reply to a request served as the acknowledgement. Here is an example of a client read request using this model: # Client sends read request to server # Server sends requested data to client All requests contained a sequence number, so if the client didn't receive a response within an appropriate amount of time it would re-send the request with the same sequence number. If the server had already processed the request it would resend the cached response, if it had not yet had time to process the request it would only send a "positive acknowledgement". The bottom line to this 'trust the network' approach was a 2/3 reduction in network transactions and the associated latency. === Non-preemptive OS designed for network services === One of the raging debates of the 90s was whether it was more appropriate for network file service to be performed by a software layer running on top of a general purpose operating system, or by a special purpose operating system. NetWare was a special purpose operating system, not a timesharing OS. It was written from the ground up as a platform for client-server processing services. Initially it focused on file and print services, but later demonstrated its flexibility by running database, email, web and other services as well. It also performed efficiently as a router, supporting IPX, TCP/IP, and Appletalk, though it never offered the flexibility of a 'hardware' router. In 4.x and earlier versions, NetWare did not support [[preemption (computing)|preemption]], [[virtual memory]], [[GUI|graphical user interfaces]], etc. Processes and services running under the NetWare OS were expected to be cooperative, that is to process a request and return control to the OS in a timely fashion. On the down side, this trust of application processes to manage themselves could lead to a misbehaving application bringing down the server. By comparison, general-purpose operating systems such as [[Unix]] or [[Microsoft Windows]] were based on an interactive, time-sharing model where competing programs would consume all available resources if not held in check by the operating system. Such environments operated by preemption, memory virtualization, etc., generating significant overhead because there were never enough resources to do everything every application desired. These systems improved over time as network services shed their “application” stigma and moved deeper into the kernel of the “general purpose” OS, but they never equaled the efficiency of NetWare. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Probably the single greatest reason for Novell's success during the 80's and 90's was the efficiency of NetWare compared to general purpose operating systems. However, as microprocessors increased in power, efficiency became less and less of an issue. With the introduction of the Pentium processor, NetWare's performance advantage began to be outweighed by the complexity of managing and developing applications for the NetWare environment. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} ==See also== *[[Comparison of operating systems]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==Further reading== * {{cite book |last= Harris |first= Jeffrey L. |title= Novell Open Enterprise Server Administrator's Handbook, NetWare Edition |publisher= [[Novell Press]] |year= 2005 |isbn= 978-0-672-32748-3 }} * {{cite book |last= Harris |first= Jeffrey L. |title= Novell NetWare 6.5 Administrator's Handbook |publisher= [[Novell Press]] |year= 2004 |isbn= 978-0-7897-2984-2 }} * {{cite book |last= Harris |first= Jeffrey L. |coauthors= Kelley J.P.

After [[directory service|directory]]-enabling the software, Novell renamed the package '''NAL''' ('''Novell Application Launcher'''). The success of NAL led to considerable growth in its functionality, and marketers renamed the product "ZENworks" (for "Zero Effort Networks").<ref> {{cite web | first = Brad | last = Anderson | author = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = An Introduction to ZENworks: Zero Effort Networking for Users | url = http://support.novell.com/techcenter/articles/ana19980502.html | archiveurl = | work = | publisher = Novell Inc. | date = 1998-05-01 | year = | month = | archivedate = | accessdate = 2009-03-30 | quote = The name ZENworks is short for "Zero Effort Networks."
