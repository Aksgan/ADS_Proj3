[[data security]], [[data validation|validation]], [[Optimization (computer science)|optimization]], and [[maintainability]] features.[http://www.boic.com/b1mbatd.htm] Base One holds a number of U.S. patents on its core technologies, with additional patents pending.[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6384748.html][http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6738775.html][http://www.freepatentsonline.com/7181474.html] Developers can incorporate BFC components into Windows applications written in any of the major Microsoft programming languages ([[Visual C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[VB.NET]], [[ASP.NET]]) and using a variety of technologies, including [[Component Object Model|COM]]/[[ActiveX]], [[Microsoft Foundation Class Library|MFC]], [[Crystal Reports]], and [[AJAX]]. BFC works with both [[Managed code|managed and unmanaged code]], and it can be used to construct either [[thin client]] or [[Fat client|rich client]] applications, with or without [[Web browser|browser]]-based interfaces. == History == The development of BFC originally was funded by projects done for [[Marsh & McLennan]] and [[Deutsche Bank]] that started in the mid-1990s.[http://www.itjungle.com/fhs/fhs072704-story01.html] The securities custody system built by Deutsche Bank with BFC is one of the earliest successful examples of commercial grid computing. [http://whitepapers.zdnet.com/casestudy.aspx?docid=106508] The name "BFC" was a play on Microsoft's MFC, which (starting with Visual C++ 1.5) BFC extended through [[Library (computing)|class libraries]] to facilitate the development of large-scale, [[client/server]] database applications. With the release of Visual C++ 2.0, BFC provided a way to upgrade from 16-bit Windows 3.1 and NT to true 32-bit Windows MFC applications. Under Visual C++ 4.0, BFC added Base One's Internet Server, enabling [[Transparency (computing)|transparent]] database access across the Internet for distributed rich client and [[grid computing]] applications.[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-56252403.html] Starting with Visual C++ 6.0, BFC added COM support, so that [[Visual Basic|VB]] and [[Active Server Pages|ASP]] programmers could use BFC's database components, including ActiveX grid (table), combo, and edit controls. With the advent of VisualStudio .NET 2002, BFC was extended to support the [[.NET language]]s, C#, VB.NET, and ASP.NET.[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2004_May_18/ai_n6032568] == Licensing == Base One International Corp. has two levels of BFC product offerings, both of which supply samples and full source code: * BFC Professional: single developer license * BFC Enterprise: site license == References == {{Reflist}} {{Refbegin}} # [http://www.boic.com/b1mbatd.htm Base One Distributed Computing in Depth].
