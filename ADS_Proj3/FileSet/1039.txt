host on the internal network that has all ports exposed, except those ports otherwise forwarded. By definition this is not a true DMZ (Demilitarized Zone), since it alone does not separate the host from the internal network. That is, the DMZ host is able to connect to hosts on the internal network, whereas hosts within a real DMZ are prevented from connecting with the internal network by a firewall that separates them, unless the firewall permits the connection. A firewall may allow this if a host on the internal network first requests a connection to the host within the DMZ. The DMZ host provides none of the security advantages that a [[subnetwork|subnet]] provides and is often used as an easy method of forwarding all ports to another firewall / [[network address translation|NAT]] device. ==See also== *[[Bastion host]] ==References== *[http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-22_11-5756029.html SolutionBase: Strengthen network defenses by using a DMZ] by Deb Shinder at [[TechRepublic]]. *Eric Maiwald.

It is also a member of the [[International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration]] or [[INSDC]]. It exchanges its data with [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] at the [[European Bioinformatics Institute]] and with [[GenBank]] at the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] on a daily basis. Thus these three databanks contents the same data at any given time. <br /> DDBJ began data bank activities since 1986 at NIG and it boasts to be the only nucleotide sequence data bank in Asia. Although DDBJ mainly receives its data from Japanese researchers, however it can accept data from a contributor belonging to any other country. DDBJ is primarily funded by the Japanese [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] (MEXT). DDBJ has an international advisory committee which consists of nine members, 3 members each from Europe, US, and Japan. This committee advices DDBJ about its maintenance, management and future plans once a year. Apart from this DDBJ also has an international collaborative committee which advises on various technical issues related to international collaboration and consists of working-level participants. ==References== {{reflist}} ==See also== * [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI) * [[European Bioinformatics Institute]] (EBI) ==External links== *[http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ Official site] *[http://biodatabase.org/index.php/DDBJ_-_DNA_Data_Bank_of_Japan DDBJ] entry in [[MetaBase]].

In this example treated sample ([[Case-control|case]]) and untreated sample ([[Case-control|control]]). # The [[nucleic acid]] of interest is purified: this can be all [[RNA]] for [[expression profiling]], [[DNA]] for [[comparative hybridization]], or DNA/RNA bound to a particular [[protein]] which is [[immunoprecipitated]] ([[ChIP-on-chip]]) for [[Epigenetics |epigenetic]] or regulation studies. In this example total RNA is isolated (total as it is nuclear and [[cytoplasm]]ic) by [[Guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction]] (e.g. [[Trizol]]) which isolates most RNA (whereas column methods have a cut off of 200 nucleotides) and if done correctly has a better purity. # The purified RNA is analysed for quality (by [[capillary electrophoresis]]) and quantity (by using a [[spectrometer|nanodrop spectrometer]]): if enough material (>1[[μg]]) is present the experiment can continue. # The labelled product is generated via [[reverse transcription]] and sometimes with an optional [[PCR]] amplification. The RNA is reverse transcribed with either polyT primers which amplify only [[MRNA|mRNA]] or random primers which amplify all RNA which is mostly [[RRNA|rRNA]], [[MicroRNA|miRNA]] microarray ligate an oligonucleotide to the purified small RNA (isolated with a fractionator) and then RT and amplified. The label is added either in the RT step or in an additional step after amplification if present.The sense that is labelled depends on the microarray, which means that if the label is added with the RT mix, the [[CDNA|cDNA]] is on the template strand while the probe is on the sense strand (unless they are negative controls). The label is typically [[fluorescent]]; only one machine uses [[radioactivity in biology|radiolabels]]. The labelling can be direct (not used) or indirect which requires a coupling stage. The coupling stage can occur before hybridization (two-channel arrays) using [[aminoallyl]]-UTP and [[N-hydroxysuccinimide|NHS]] amino-reactive dyes (like [[cyanine|cyanine dyes]]) or after (single-channel arrays) using biotin and labelled streptavin. The modified nucleotides (typically a 1 aaUTP: 4 TTP mix) are added enzymatically at a lower rate compared to normal nucleotides, typically resulting in 1 every 60 bases (measured with a spectrophotometer). The aaDNA is then purified with a [[DNA separation by silica adsorption|column]] (using solution containing phosphate buffer as
