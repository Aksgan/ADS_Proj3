is an influential member of the [[free software]] developer community, through his creation of the [[Advogato]] virtual community and his work with the free software branch of [[Ghostscript]]. He is currently employed by [[Google]]. He holds a [[PhD]] in Computer Science from [[UC Berkeley]]. ==Advogato== {{main|Advogato}} Advogato is a social website for the [[free software]] community that was founded by Levien in November 1999, who had two principal motivations: first, to test his ideas of [[attack-resistant trust metric]]s, and secondly to provide a development-focused forum for the free software community that was free of the kind of commercial motivations of such sites as [[Sourceforge]]. The site has been successful from the point of view of the first criterion, surviving many attacks aimed at subverting the attack metric, made both by developers trying out attacks, and by [[Spam (electronic)|spam]]mers. The site has needed only relatively minor changes to cope with these. The site's trust metric provides, alongside [[Epinions]], one of the two most important datasets used in empirical analysis of trust metrics and [[reputation system]]s. Levien observed that [[Google]]'s [[PageRank]] algorithm can be understood to be an attack resistant trust metric rather similar to that behind Advogato.<ref>Chapter six of (Levien 2006).</ref> The site has had a more rocky road as a forum for free software developers, and currently hosts less discussion than at its peak as developers have moved from forums to [[weblog]]s. Due to this, Advogato has added a syndication feature which includes the weblogs of its current certified developer base. It remains one of the earlier networking sites, and is still a place for active discussion on development of free software. ==Imaging== Raph Levien's main research interest is in the theory of imaging, that is, rendering pictures and fonts so that they can be displayed electronically. He has written several papers on his research in halftoning technology, which have been implemented in the [[Gimp-Print]] free software package, as well as by several commercial implementations. Levien created Gill, the [[GNOME|Gnome]] Illustration Application which aimed to support the W3C [[SVG]] standard for Vector Graphics. He states it was named after [[Eric Gill]], the English type designer responsible for the [[Gill Sans]], [[Perpetua]] and [[Joanna]] fonts. Development on Gill ceased around the year 2000, but a fork of its code base has evolved to [[Sodipodi]] and through it to [[Inkscape]]. Levien is currently working on a PhD and has published a chapter on the mathematical history of [[Elastica Theory|Elastica]] as a standalone essay.<ref>http://www.levien.com/phd/elastica_hist.pdf</ref> He calls the Elastica "A beautiful family of curves based on beautiful mathematics and a rich and fascinating history." ==Patent grant to GPL-licensed software== ZD-Net's ''Interactive week'' summarised the issue that patents pose to the free software community<ref name="in-1">Peter Wayner, ZD-Net ''Interactive Weel'', 8 November 2001. Raph Levien provided [http://www.levien.com/wayner-patch.html an annotated summary] of the article.</ref>: :''Levien recognizes the paradox: On one hand, he made money from forcing everyone who used his patented ideas to give him royalties. On the other, he shared the source code of several programs and recognized how the cooperation helped him and others. The two models were in conflict.'' As a resolution to this conflict, in March 2000, Raph made a [http://www.advogato.org/article/89.html patent grant] of his [[patent portfolio]] to the GPL community. This step was considered by some to have set a good example, and it has been suggested that it has set a precedent for IBM's subsequent patent grant, which followed two years later. ==Activism against encryption export regulations== Raph played a small part in precipitating the relaxation of the US [[Export of cryptography#PC era|crypto export legislation]], by filing for a [http://www.petting-zoo.net/~deadbeef/archive/340.html Commodities Jurisdiction Request] for a t-shirt containing an implementation of the [[RSA]] encryption algorithm, in four lines of [[Perl]]. At the time (1995), the code on the t-shirt would have been regarded as a [[munition]] by the [[United States]] and other [[NATO]] governments. ==Personal life== He is divorced, with two sons: Alan and Max. He is a member of the [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] Monthly Meeting<ref>[http://www.quaker.org/berkmm/ Berkeley Monthly Meeting website.]</ref> of the [[Religious Society of Friends (Quakers)]].

The first techniques for rapid prototyping became available in the late 1980s and were used to produce [[model (physical)|model]]s and [[prototype]] parts. Today, they are used for a much wider range of applications and are even used to [[manufacture]] production-quality parts in relatively small numbers. Some [[sculptor]]s use the technology to produce complex shapes for [[fine arts]] [[exhibition]]s. ==Introduction== [[Image:Rapid prototyping slicing.jpg|right|400px|thumb]] The use of additive manufacturing for rapid prototyping takes virtual designs from [[computer aided design]] (CAD) or [[animation]] [[modeling software]], transforms them into thin, virtual, horizontal cross-sections and then creates successive layers until the model is complete. It is a [[WYSIWYG]] process where the virtual model and the physical model are almost identical. With additive manufacturing, the machine reads in data from a CAD drawing and lays down successive layers of liquid, powder, or sheet material, and in this way builds up the model from a series of cross sections. These layers, which correspond to the virtual cross section from the CAD model, are joined together or
