For other uses of the word, see [[jiffy]].}} '''Jiffy''' is an informal term for any unspecified short period of [[time]], as in "I'll be back in a jiffy". From this it has acquired a number of more precise applications for short, very short, or extremely short periods of time. Known since the 18th century, the word's origin is unclear, though one suggestion is that it was [[thieves' cant]] for lightning.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=jiffy&searchmode=none | title= jiffy |author= Douglas Harper |date= November 2001 |work= Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher= | accessdate= 2008-03-18 }}</ref> == Beginnings in measurement == The earliest technical usage for jiffy was defined by [[Gilbert Newton Lewis]] (1875–1946). He proposed a unit of time called the "jiffy" which was equal to the time it takes [[light]] to travel one centimetre (approximately 33.3564 [[picosecond]]s).<ref name="numericana">{{cite web | url= http://www.numericana.com/answer/units.htm#jiffy | title= What's a jiffy? | author= Gerard P.

It is not an absolute time interval unit, since its duration depends on the clock interrupt frequency of the particular hardware platform. Early microcomputer systems such as the [[Commodore 64]] and many game consoles (which use [[television]]s as a display device) commonly synchronize the system interrupt timer with the vertical frequency of the local television standard, either 59.94 Hz with [[NTSC]] systems, or 50.0 Hz with most [[PAL]] systems. Within the [[Linux]] 2.6 operating system kernel, since release 2.6.13, on the [[Intel]] [[i386]] platform a jiffy is by default 4 ms, or 1/250 of a second.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=blob;f=arch/x86/configs/i386_defconfig | title= /pub/scm / linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git / blob |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= git.kernel.org | accessdate= 2008-03-18 }}</ref> The jiffy values for other Linux versions and platforms have typically varied between about 1 ms and 10 ms.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=tree;f=arch | title= /pub/scm / linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git / tree |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= git.kernel.org | accessdate= 2008-03-18 }}</ref> == Use in physics == The [[speed of light]] in a vacuum provides a convenient universal relationship between distance and time, so in [[physics]] (particularly in [[quantum physics]]) and often in [[chemistry]], a jiffy is defined as the time taken for light to travel some specified distance. In astrophysics and quantum physics a jiffy is, as defined by Edward R. Harrison,<ref>"The Cosmic Numbers" in ''Cosmology, The Science of the Universe'', 1981 Cambridge Press</ref> the time it takes for light to travel one [[Fermi (unit)|fermi]], which is the size of a nucleon. One fermi is 10<sup>&minus;15</sup> m, so a jiffy is about 3 × 10<sup>&minus;24</sup> seconds. Sometimes a jiffy is used as a synonym for the [[Planck interval]], about 5.4 × 10<sup>&minus;44</sup> [[second]]s, which is the time it takes light to traverse the smallest meaningful length, the [[Planck length]]. In this [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] definition, a jiffy is the shortest theoretically possible time period that can be measured within one [[standard deviation]] of accuracy.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lieu| first=Richard |coauthors=Hillman, Lloyd W. |date=2003-03-10 |title=The Phase Coherence of Light from Extragalactic Sources: Direct Evidence against First-Order Planck-Scale Fluctuations in Time and Space |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=585 |pages=L77–L80 |url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/374350 |accessdate=2008-05-30 |doi=10.1086/374350 }}</ref> In practice, current technology can come nowhere near making this brief a time measurement. ==References== ;Notes {{reflist}} == External links == * [[foldoc:jiffy|FOLDOC]] * [http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/J/jiffy.html The Jargon File] <!--spacing--> {{Time measurement and standards}} [[Category:Units of time|Jiffy]] [[Category:Operating system technology|Jiffy#Use in computing]] [[Category:Interrupts|Jiffy#Use in computing]] [[de:Jiffy]] [[ja:瞬間]]</text> </page> <page> <id>19917</id> <title>Jim Davies (computer scientist)</title> <text>{{Other people2|Jim Davies (disambiguation){{!}}Jim Davies}} '''Jim Davies''' is [[Professor]] of [[Software Engineering]] and current Director of the [[Software Engineering Programme]] at the [[University of Oxford]], [[England]].<ref name="oucl">{{Cite web| url=http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/people/Jim.Davies/| title=Jim Davies:Oxford University| accessdate=2009-09-26}}</ref> == Biography == Jim Davies studied [[mathematics]] at [[New College, Oxford]], joining the [[Oxford University Computing Laboratory|Computing Laboratory]] in 1986 for a Masters' and Doctorate.<ref name="oucl"/> After working as a researcher and lecturer in [[computer science]], at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], the [[University of Reading|Reading]], and [[Royal Holloway, University of London]], he
