They are given this name because they operate on the set of [[real number]]s. Within this theory, it is possible to prove interesting statements such as "the complement of the [[Mandelbrot set]] is only partially decidable". These hypothetical computing machines can be viewed as idealised [[analog computer]]s which operate on real numbers and are [[differential (mathematics)|differential]], whereas [[digital computer]]s are limited to [[computable]] numbers and are [[algebraic]]. Depending on the model chosen, this may enable real computers to solve problems that are inextricable on digital computers (for example, [[Hava Siegelmann]]'s [[neural nets]] can have noncomputable real weights, making them able to compute nonrecursive languages), or vice versa ([[Claude Shannon]]'s idealized analog computer can only solve algebraic differential equations, while a digital computer can solve some transcendental equations as well. However this comparison is not entirely fair since in [[Claude Shannon]]'s idealized analog computer computations are immediately done, i.e. computation is done in real time. Shannon's model can be adapted to cope with this problem).<ref>{{cite journal |author=O. Bournez, M. L. Campagnolo, D. S. Graça, and E.

It focuses on [[ethics]], [[rationality]] and [[personal identity (philosophy)|personal identity]]. It is divided into four parts, dedicated to self-defeating theories, rationality and time, personal identity and responsibility toward future generations. ==Self-defeating theories== Part 1 argues that certain ethical theories are ''self-defeating''. One such theory is [[ethical egoism]], which Parfit claims fails due to the [[Prisoner's dilemma]]. Ultimately, Parfit rejects "common sense morality" on similar grounds. Parfit himself does not explicitly endorse a particular view; rather, he shows what the problems of different theories are. His only positive endorsement is of "impersonal ethics" — impersonality being the common denominator of the different parts of the book. ==Rationality and time== Part 2 focuses on the relationship between [[rationality]] and [[time]], dealing with questions such as: ''should we take into account our past desires?'', ''should I do something I will regret later, even if it seems a good idea now?'', and so on. One of Parfit's arguments is as follows: self-interest theorists consider the differences between different persons at the same time as significant in terms of rationality, but do not consider the difference between the same person at the different times to be as significant. But if, as Parfit argues, a reductionist theory of personal identity holds, then the difference between different persons at the same time is more like the difference between the same persons at different times. So, if non-reductionism is true, [[self-interest]] theorists are inconsistent in viewing spatial relations as significant but temporal relations insignificant. Thus, the foundations of the self-interest theory are undermined by non-reductionism, which lends support to the present-aim theory of rationality, the critical version of which Parfit favours. ==Personal identity== Part 3 argues for a reductive account of [[Personal identity (philosophy)|personal identity]]; rather than accepting the claim that our existence is a deep, significant fact about the world, Parfit's account of personal identity is like this: At time 1, there is a person. At a later time 2, there is a person. These people seem to be the same person. Indeed, these people share memories and personality traits. But there are no further facts in the world that make them the ''same person''. Parfit continues this logic to establish a new context for morality and social control. He cites that it is morally wrong for one person to harm or interfere with another person and it is incumbent on society to protect individuals from such transgressions. That accepted, it is a short extrapolation to conclude that it is also incumbent on society to protect an individual's "Future Self" from such transgressions; tobacco use could be classified as an abuse of a Future Self's right to a healthy existence. Parfit resolves the logic to reach this conclusion, which appears to justify incursion into personal freedoms, but he does not
