symbol of the country. Combined with the heraldic tradition of artistic freedom so long as the particulars of the blazon are followed, a wide variety of official and unofficial emblazonments appeared, especially in the first hundred years. This is evident even in the different versions of the seal die. The quality of the 1885 design, coupled with a spirit of bureaucratic standardization that characterized that era, has driven most of these out of official use.<ref name="ahart"/><ref name="carpet">{{cite book|title=The Most Splendid Carpet|last=Anderson|first=Susan H.|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/inde/anderson/index.htm|chapter=Elements of Design in the Senate's Carpet|chapterurl=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/inde/anderson/chap5a.htm|oclc=06279577}}</ref> ===James Trenchard engravings=== {{double image|right|Trenchard 1786 Great Seal Obverse.jpg|110|Trenchard 1786 Great Seal Reverse.jpg|100|Trenchard's ''Columbian Magazine'' engravings}} In 1786, for the first two issues of ''[[Columbian Magazine]]'', Philadelphia engraver James Trenchard wrote articles on the obverse (in September 1786) and reverse (in October 1786) of the Great Seal, and each issue included a full-page engraving of his own original version of the discussed side of the seal. The project apparently was aided by William Barton, as the official law was printed along with supplemental notes from Barton. Trenchard's obverse featured randomly placed stars, like Thomson's drawing, and had the rays of the glory extending beyond the clouds upward, with the clouds themselves being in an arc. The reverse also followed the blazon carefully, and featured an elongated pyramid with the requisite mottos and the Eye of Providence (a right eye, unlike versions which followed). While not official, Trenchard's depiction had an obvious influence on subsequent official versions, and was the first known public rendering of the reverse side (and only one for many years).<ref name="statepub"/><ref name="ahart"/> ===St. Paul's Chapel painting=== [[File:St. Paul's Chapel Great Seal Painting.jpg|thumb|left|160px]] [[St. Paul's Chapel (New York, New York)|St. Paul's Chapel]] in New York City has a large oil painting of the national coat of arms, believed installed sometime in 1786. It was commissioned on October 7, 1785, not long after the [[Congress of the Confederation]] began meeting in nearby [[Federal Hall]]. The painting hangs over Washington's pew, across the room from a painting of the [[Seal of New York|arms of New York]] over the Governor's pew. The painting has many similarities to Trenchard's version (or vice versa depending on which came first), including the random placement of stars and details of the eagle. The clouds are in a full circle though instead of an arc, and the rays extend beyond them in all directions. The shield has a gold chain border with a badge at the bottom. This is the earliest known full-color version of the seal design, and the artist is unknown.<ref name="ahart"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://greatseal.com/committees/1stpainting.html|title=The First Painting of the Great Seal of the United States|publisher=greatseal.com|first= John D.|last=MacArthur|accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref> ===Indian Peace Medals=== {{double image|right|Indian Peace Medal 1792 Obverse.jpg|110|Indian Peace Medal 1792 Reverse.jpg|110|1792 Indian Peace Medal}} European powers had traditionally given "peace medals" to native American Indians in an attempt to curry favor, and the newly created United States followed suit. On April 28, 1786, the Congress authorized creation of [[Indian Peace Medal]]s with the coat of arms (obverse of the Great Seal) on one side, and various designs on the other. The medals were typically oval and made of silver, and were fairly large.<ref name="ahart"/> The use of the arms on these medals continued through 1795, with the more famous ones having a scene with George Washington on the other side.<ref name="totten"/> Medals made after this time used other designs, and the practice continued through the administration of [[Benjamin Harrison]]. The design of the arms on these medals, made by the U.S. Mint, follow the Trenchard design very closely. The stars are six-pointed, and randomly placed. The clouds form an arc, with the rays of the glory upward and outwards, a design reminiscent of the modern-day [[Seal of the President of the United States]].<ref name="ahart"/> ===Diplomatic Medal=== {{double image|right|US 1792 Diplomatic medal obverse.jpg|140|US 1792 Diplomatic medal reverse.jpg|140|Diplomatic Medal}} In 1790 it was decided to award diplomatic medals to foreign envoys at the end of their service, as a less-extravagant version of the European custom to give diplomats expensive gifts upon their departure. Thomas Jefferson (then the Secretary of State) instructed the U.S. [[chargé d'affaires]] in Paris ([[William Short (American ambassador)|William Short]]) to contract with a local engraver to make the medals, since the first was to go to the [[Anne-César, Chevalier de la Luzerne|Marquis de la Luzerne]], the former French minister. Jefferson specified that one side must be the Arms of the United States, and gave suggestions for the other side though left the final decision to Short and the engraving artist. Short chose [[Augustin Dupré]], a leading engraver of the time, who completed the medals in 1792.<ref name="ahart"/> Dupré created an elegant design, especially interesting for the position of the wings, which are more horizontal ("extended" in heraldic terms) than most other emblazonments. The eagle itself was unmistakably a bald eagle, without a crest. The five-pointed stars were arranged in a six-pointed star pattern (like the future 1841 die). The clouds are in an inverted arc, much like the official die, but the rays of the glory extend down beyond the clouds and in back of the eagle. Dupré added a <small>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</small> legend around the sides, and a small rosette of leaves in the [[exergue]] below the eagle. For the reverse, Dupré apparently followed one of Jefferson's suggestions, depicting a scene of international commerce portrayed as [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] (the god of diplomacy) in conference with the genius of America (shown as an Indian chief, similar to some early American copper coins).<ref name="totten"/> Only two medals (both made of gold) were given before the practice was terminated, one posthumously to de la Luzerne and the other to his successor Count de Monstier. Six bronze versions were also delivered to William Short. Their existence was eventually forgotten until the 1870s, when references to the medals in Jefferson's papers were connected to the discovery of Dupré's lead working model.<ref name="totten"/><ref name="ahart"/> ===Coins=== [[File:Brasher doubloon.PNG|thumb|Brasher doubloon]] The [[Coinage Act of 1792]] established the [[United States Mint|U.S. Mint]] and
