backplane: Used to describe the connections between stacked units, and the bandwidth of that connection. Most typically, switches that have primarily Fast Ethernet ports would have at minimum Gigabit connections for its stacking backplane; likewise, switches that primarily have Gigabit Ethernet ports would have at minimum 10-Gigabit connections. * Clustering: The term sometimes used for a stacking approach that focuses on unified management with a single IP address for multiple stackable units. Units can be distributed and of multiple types. * Stack Master or Commander: In some stack architectures, one unit is designated the main unit of the stack. All management is routed through that single master unit. Some call this the master or commander unit. Other units in the stack are referred to as slave or member units. == Further reading == * 3Com Corporation, 1993.

It is based on the [[programming by demonstration]] concept, where rules are created by giving examples of what actions should take place in a given situation. It can be used to construct simulations, animations and games, which run under [[Java (programming language)|Java]] on any suitable platform.<ref>Your wish is my command: programming by example, Henry Lieberman, [[Morgan Kaufmann Publishers]], ISBN 9781558606883</ref> ==History== What is today known as Creator originally started as a project by Allen Cypher and David Canfield Smith in Apple's [[Advanced Technology Group]] (ATG) known as '''KidSim'''. As the name implies, it was intended to allow kids to construct their own simulations, reducing the programming task to something that anyone could handle. Programming in Creator uses graphical rewrite rules augmented with non-graphical tests and actions. In [[1994]], Kurt Schmucker became the project manager, and under him, the project was renamed '''Cocoa''', and expanded to include a [[Netscape]] plug-in. It was also repositioned as "Internet Authoring for Kids", as the Internet was becoming increasingly accessible. The project was officially announced on May 13, 1996. There were three releases: * DR1 (Developer Release 1) on October 31, 1996 * DR2 in June, [[1997]] * DR3 in June, [[1998]] When [[Steve Jobs]] returned to Apple in 1997, he began dismantling a number of non-productive departments{{Fact|date=December 2009}}. One of these was the ATG. [[Larry Tesler]], Cypher, and Smith, left to form [[Stagecast Software]] after retaining the rights to the Cocoa system. Apple went on to reuse the Cocoa name for the entirely unrelated [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa application framework]], originally [[OpenStep]]. Apparently due to time constraints—it was easier to reuse an already-registered name than to register a new term.{{Fact|date=December 2009}} ==Description== Creator is based on the idea of independent ''characters'' that have a graphical appearance and non-graphical properties. Each character has a list of rules that determine how it behaves. The rules are created ''by demonstrating'' what the character does in a specific situation. Each rule is a ''before / after'' rule, stating that when the ''before'' conditions of the rule are met, the ''after'' actions of the rule are performed. For a simple example, let's consider a simulation showing a character walking across a field, jumping over any rocks it encounters. Such a simulation would start with the construction of the playfield, in this case a line of icons representing the grass and a few rocks. A character is then placed on the playfield and double-clicked to open a rule editor. The rule editor will start by displaying the current conditions, that is, the character is standing on the grass.
