This protects critical Windows system files by preventing programs other than Microsoft's operating system update mechanisms such as the ''Package Installer'', [[Windows Installer]] and other update components from modifying them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/222193|title=Microsoft KB article 222193: Description of the Windows File Protection Feature}}</ref> The [[System File Checker]] utility provides users the ability to perform a manual scan the integrity of all protected system files, and optionally repair them, either by restoring from a cache stored in a separate "DLLCACHE" directory, or from the original install media. Microsoft recognized that a [[Blue Screen of Death|serious error]] or a stop error could cause problems for servers that needed to be constantly running and so provided a system setting that would allow the server to automatically reboot when a stop error occurred.<ref name="RecoveryOptions">[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307973 How to configure system failure and recovery options in Windows]</ref> Also included is an option to [[Core dump|dump]] any of the first 64 [[kilobyte|KB]] of memory to disk (the smallest amount of memory that is useful for [[debugging]] purposes, also known as a minidump), a dump of only the kernel's memory, or a dump of the entire contents of memory to disk, as well as write that this event happened to the Windows 2000 [[Event Viewer|event log]].<ref name="RecoveryOptions" /> In order to improve performance on servers running Windows 2000, Microsoft gave administrators the choice of optimizing the operating system's memory and processor usage patterns for background services or for applications.<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/Windows2000Pro/reskit/part6/proch29.mspx Analyzing processor activity: Windows 2000 Professional Resource Kit]</ref> Windows 2000 also introduced core system administration and management features as the [[Windows Installer]],<ref>[http://entmag.com/archives/article.asp?editorialsid=5169 Using Windows Installer in Windows 2000 beta 3]</ref> [[Windows Management Instrumentation]]<ref>[http://www.informit.com/articles/printerfriendly.aspx?p=19489 Programming with Windows Management Instrumentation]</ref> and Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)<ref>[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb968803(VS.85).aspx Event Tracing for Windows (ETW): MSDN]</ref> into the operating system. === Plug and Play === The most notable improvement from [[Windows NT 4.0]] is the addition of Plug and Play with full [[ACPI]] and [[Windows Driver Model]] support. Similar to [[Windows 9x]], Windows 2000 supports automatic recognition of installed hardware, hardware resource allocation, loading of appropriate drivers, PnP APIs and device notification events. The addition of the kernel PnP Manager along with the Power Manager are two significant subsystems added in Windows 2000. === Shell === Windows 2000 introduces layered windows that allow for transparency, translucency and various transition effects like shadows, gradient fills and alpha blended GUI elements to top-level windows. <ref> [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms997507.aspx Layered Windows: MSDN] </ref> [[Image:Windows 2000 Explorer.png|thumb|The integrated media player in [[Windows Explorer]] playing a [[MIDI]] sequence.]] [[Windows Explorer]] has been enhanced in several ways in Windows 2000.
