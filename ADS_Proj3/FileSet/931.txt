30 days, on average to create, negotiate, and finalize a contract.{{fact|date=July 2008}} Many organizations use Microsoft Word, and Excel to author and manage their contracts, however, these tools are solutions do little to automate and activate the agreements. Other businesses attempt "home-grown" solutions using rudimentary web tools such as [[ACT!]] which does not provide contract compliance monitoring and hence cannot reduce or eliminate maverick spending. Such solutions also do not provide critical pricing variance monitoring and are unable to track pricing rebates, or compare contract obligations against changing policy and regulatory non-compliance. Introducing contract management into an enterprise using these tools introduces greater risk of error and loss into the enterprise.{{fact|date=July 2008}} ===Contract management software implementation=== Contract management software is used to manage the contract life-cycle, from identification of a need, through negotiation, agreement, monitoring, and close-out. ==Change management== There may be occasions where what is agreed in a contract needs to be changed later on. A number of bases may be used to support a subsequent change, so that the whole contract remains enforceable under the new arrangement. A change may be based on: *A mutual agreement of both parties to vary the contract, outside the framework of the existing contract. This would be an independent basis for changing the contract. *A unilateral decision to vary the contract, contemplated and allowed for by the existing contract. This would normally have notice periods for fairness and often the right of the other, especially in consumer contracts, to cease the contractual relationship. Be careful that any one-way imposition of change is contractually justified, otherwise it may be interpreted as a repudiation of the original contract, enabling the other party to terminate the contract and seek damages. *A bilateral decision to vary the contract, within the variation or change control process outlined in the existing contract. These are often called change control provisions. ==See also== * [[Document automation]] * [[United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods]] * [[Uniform Commercial Code]] - United States * [[Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs]] - for contracts with the United States government * [[Government contract]] * [[Group purchasing organization]] ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.iaccm.com IACCM], International Association for Contract and Commercial Management * [http://www.ncmahq.org NCMA], National Contract Management Association * [http://www.ism.ws ISM], Institute for Supply Management [[Category:Enterprise architecture]] [[Category:Information technology management]]</text> </page> <page> <id>8017</id> <title>Contraposition</title> <text>: ''For contraposition in the field of traditional logic, see [[Contraposition (traditional logic)]].'' : ''For contraposition in the field of symbolic logic, see [[Transposition (logic)]].'' '''Contraposition''' is a logical relationship between two [[proposition]]s, or statements. For example, take the following (true) proposition: "''All birds are animals''." We can restate that as "''If something is a bird, then it is an animal''." The contrapositive is, "''If something is not an animal, then it is not a bird''." In [[mathematics]] and in [[logic]], the contrapositive is always guaranteed to be true, as long as the original proposition is true. If the original proposition is false, the contrapositive will always be false, as well. Compare that to the other common relationships between propositions: *'''[[Inverse (logic)|Inversion]]''': "''If something is not a bird, then it is not an animal''." Unlike the contrapositive, the inversion's [[truth value]] is not dependent upon whether the original proposition is true, as evidenced here. The inverse, here, is clearly not true. *'''[[Conversion (logic)|Conversion]]''': "''If something is an animal, then it is a bird''." The conversion is actually the contrapositive of the inversion and always has the same truth value as the inversion, which is not necessarily the same as that of the original proposition. *'''[[Contradiction]]''': "''There exists a bird that is not an animal''. " If the contradiction is true, then the original proposition and, by extension, the contrapositive are untrue. Here, of course, the contradiction is untrue. ==Simple proof using Venn Diagrams== [[File:Venn_A_subset_B.svg|thumb|right|]] It appears clear that, if something is within A, then it must also be within B. We can rephrase that as :<math>(A \to B)</math> It is also clear that anything that is not within B '''cannot''' be within A, either. This statement, :<math>(\neg B \to \neg A)</math> is the contrapositive. Therefore we can say that :<math>(A \to B)</math> â‰¡ <math>(\neg B \to \neg A)</math> Practically speaking, this makes life much easier when trying to prove something. For example, if we want to prove that every girl in the United States is blonde, we can either try to prove <math>(A \to B)</math> by checking all girls in the United States to see if they are all blonde, or we can simply disprove the contrapositive by finding one nonblonde girl. Upon finding one, we have disproven <math>(\neg B \to \neg A)</math> and, by extension, <math>(A \to B)</math>. To conclude, for any statement where A implies B, then ''not B'' always implies ''not A''. Proving or disproving either one of these statements automatically proves or disproves the other. They are logically equivalent. ==Formal definition== A proposition ''Q'' is implicated by a proposition ''P'' when the following relationship holds: :<math>(P \to Q)</math> In [[vernacular]] terms, this states that, "if ''P'', then ''Q''", or, "if ''Socrates is a man'', then ''Socrates is human''." In a conditional such as this, ''P'' is the [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]], and ''Q'' is the [[consequent]]. One statement is the '''contrapositive''' of the other only when its antecedent is the [[Negation|negated]] consequent of the other, and vice versa. The contrapositive of the example is :<math>(\neg Q \to \neg P)</math>. That is, "If not-''Q'', then not-''P''", or, more clearly, "If ''Q'' is not the case, then ''P'' is not the case." Using our example, this is rendered "If ''Socrates is not human'', then ''Socrates is not a man''." This statement is said to be ''contraposed'' to the original and is logically equivalent to it. Due to their logical equivalence, stating one effectively states the other; when one is [[Truth value|true]], the other is also true. Likewise with falsity. Strictly speaking, a contraposition can only exist in two simple conditionals. However, a contraposition may also exist
