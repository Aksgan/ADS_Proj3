with X-rays produced in conventional X-ray tubes * High level of polarization (linear or elliptical) * High collimation, i.e. small angular divergence of the beam * Low emittance, i.e. the product of source cross section and solid angle of emission is small * Wide tunability in energy/wavelength by monochromatization (sub-electronvolt up to [[high energy X-rays|the megaelectronvolt range]]) * High brilliance, exceeding other natural and artificial light sources by many orders of magnitude: 3rd generation sources typically have a brilliance larger than 10<sup>18</sup> photons/s/mm<sup>2</sup>/mrad<sup>2</sup>/0.1%BW,{{vague|multiple divisions need bracketing or positive/negative exponent format|date=December 2009}} where 0.1%BW denotes a bandwidth 10<sup>−3</sup>''w'' centered around the frequency ''w''. * Pulsed [[light emission]] (pulse durations at or below one [[Second|nanosecond]], or a billionth of a second). ==Synchrotron radiation from accelerators== Synchrotron radiation may occur in accelerators either as a nuisance, causing undesired energy loss in [[particle physics]] contexts, or as a deliberately produced radiation source for numerous laboratory applications. Electrons are accelerated to high speeds in several stages to achieve a final energy that is typically in the gigaelectronvolt range. The electrons are forced to travel in a closed path by strong magnetic fields. This is similar to a radio antenna, but with the difference that the relativistic speed changes the observed frequency due to the Doppler effect by a factor <math>\gamma</math>. Relativistic [[Lorentz contraction]] bumps the frequency by another factor of <math>\gamma</math>, thus multiplying the gigahertz frequency of the resonant cavity that accelerates the electrons into the X-ray range. Another dramatic effect of [[special relativity|relativity]] is that the radiation pattern is distorted from the isotropic dipole pattern expected from non-relativistic theory into an extremely forward-pointing cone of radiation. This makes synchrotron radiation sources the brightest known sources of X-rays. The planar acceleration geometry makes the radiation linearly polarized when observed in the orbital plane, and circularly polarized when observed at a small angle to that plane. The advantages of using synchrotron radiation for spectroscopy and diffraction have been realized by an ever-growing scientific community, beginning in the 1960s and 1970s. In the beginning, accelerators were built for particle physics, and synchrotron radiation was used in "parasitic mode" when bending magnet radiation had to be extracted by drilling extra holes in the beam pipes. The first [[storage ring]] commissioned as a synchrotron light source was Tantalus, at the [[Synchrotron Radiation Center]], first operational in 1968.<ref>E. M. Rowe and F. E. Mills, Tantalus I: A Dedicated Storage Ring Synchrotron Radiation Source, [http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/1107919/files/p211.pdf Particle Accelerators], Vol. 4 (1973); pages 211-227.</ref> As accelerator synchrotron radiation became more intense and its applications more promising, devices that enhanced the intensity of synchrotron radiation were built into existing rings. Third-generation synchrotron radiation sources were conceived and optimized from the outset to produce bright X-rays. Fourth-generation sources that will include different concepts for producing ultrabright, pulsed time-structured X-rays for extremely demanding and also probably yet-to-be-conceived experiments are under consideration. Bending electromagnets in the accelerators were first used to generate the radiation; but to generate stronger radiation, other specialized devices, called insertion devices, are sometimes employed. Current third-generation synchrotron radiation sources are typically heavily based upon these insertion devices, when straight sections in the storage ring are used for inserting periodic magnetic structures (composed of many magnets that have a special repeating row of N and S poles) that force the electrons into a sinusoidal path or helical path. Thus, instead of a single bend, many tens or hundreds of "wiggles" at precisely calculated positions add up or multiply the total intensity that is seen at the end of the straight section. These devices are called [[wiggler (synchrotron)|wiggler]]s or [[undulator]]s. The main difference between an undulator and a wiggler is the intensity of their magnetic field and the amplitude of the deviation from the straight line path of the electrons. There are openings in the storage ring to let the radiation exit and follow a beam line into the experimenters' vacuum chamber. A great number of such beamlines can emerge from modern third-generation synchrotron radiation sources. ===Storage rings=== The electrons may be extracted from the accelerator proper and stored in an ultrahigh vacuum auxiliary magnetic storage ring where they may circle a large number of times. The magnets in the ring also need to repeatedly recompress the beam against Coulomb ([[space charge]]) forces tending to disrupt the electron bunches. The change of direction is a form of acceleration and thus the electrons emit radiation at GeV frequencies. ==Applications of synchrotron radiation== *Synchrotron radiation of an electron beam circulating at high energy in a magnetic field leads to radiative self-polarization of electrons in the beam ([[Sokolov-Ternov effect]])<ref>{{cite book|last=A. A. Sokolov and I. M. Ternov|publisher=American Institute of Physics Translation Series. Edited by C. W. Kilmister|location=New York|title=Radiation from Relativistic Electrons|year=1986|isbn=0883185075}}</ref>. This effect is used for producing highly polarised electron beams for use in various experiments. *Synchrotron radiation sets the beam sizes (determined by the [[beam emittance]]) in [[electron storage rings]] via the effects of [[radiation damping]] and quantum excitation. See <ref>[http://www.slac.stanford.edu/pubs/slacreports/slac-r-121.html The Physics of Electron Storage Rings: An Introduction by Matt Sands]</ref> for more details. == Beamlines == [[Image:Schéma de principe du synchrotron.jpg|thumb|250px|Beamlines of ''[[Soleil (synchrotron)|Soleil]]'']] At a synchrotron facility, electrons are usually accelerated by a [[synchrotron]], and then injected into a [[storage ring]], in which they circulate, producing synchrotron radiation, but without gaining further energy. The radiation is projected at a tangent to the electron storage ring and captured by [[beamline]]s. These beamlines may originate at bending magnets, which mark the corners of the storage ring; or [[insertion device]]s, which are located in the straight sections of the storage ring. The spectrum and energy of X-rays differ between the two types. The beamline includes X-ray optical devices which control the [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], photon flux, beam dimensions, focus, and collimation of the rays. The optical devices include slits, attenuators, crystal [[monochromator]]s, and mirrors. The mirrors may be bent into curves or [[toroid]]al shapes to focus the beam. A high photon flux in a small area is the most common requirement of a beamline. The design of the
