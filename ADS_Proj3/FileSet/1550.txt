Roots of mathematically rigorous treatment of fractals can be traced back to functions studied by [[Karl Weierstrass]], [[Georg Cantor]] and [[Felix Hausdorff]] in studying functions that were [[Continuous function|continuous]] but not [[differentiable]]; however, the term ''[[wikt:fractal|fractal]]'' was coined by [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] in 1975 and was derived from the [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:fractus|fractus]]'' meaning "broken" or "fractured." A mathematical fractal is based on an [[equation]] that undergoes [[iteration]], a form of [[feedback]] based on [[recursion]].<ref name=patterns>{{Cite book |title=Fractals:The Patterns of Chaos |last=Briggs |first=John |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1992|publisher= London : Thames and Hudson, 1992.|location= |isbn=0500276935, 0500276935 |page=148 }}</ref> A fractal often has the following features:<ref>{{Cite book | last = Falconer | first = Kenneth | title = Fractal Geometry: Mathematical Foundations and Applications | publisher = John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. | date = 2003 | pages = xxv | isbn = 0-470-84862-6 | nopp = true}}</ref> * It has a fine structure at arbitrarily small scales. * It is too irregular to be easily described in traditional [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean geometric]] language. * It is [[self-similarity|self-similar]] (at least approximately or [[stochastic]]ally). * It has a [[Hausdorff dimension]] which is greater than its [[Lebesgue covering dimension|topological dimension]] (although this requirement is not met by [[space-filling curve]]s such as the [[Hilbert curve]]).<ref>The Hilbert curve map is not a homeomorhpism, so it does not preserve topological dimension. The topological dimension and Hausdorff dimension of the image of the Hilbert map in '''R'''<sup>2</sup> are both 2. Note, however, that the topological dimension of the ''graph'' of the Hilbert map (a set in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>) is 1.</ref> * It has a simple and [[recursive definition]]. Because they appear similar at all levels of magnification, fractals are often considered to be infinitely complex (in informal terms). Natural objects that are approximated by fractals to a degree include clouds, mountain ranges, lightning bolts, coastlines, snow flakes, various vegetables (cauliflower and broccoli), and animal coloration patterns. However, not all self-similar objects are fractals—for example, the [[real line]] (a straight [[Line (geometry)|Euclidean]] line) is formally self-similar but fails to have other fractal characteristics; for instance, it is regular enough to be described in Euclidean terms. Images of fractals can be created using [[fractal-generating software]]. Images produced by such software are normally referred to as being fractals even if they do not have the above characteristics, such as when it is possible to zoom into a region of the fractal that does not exhibit any fractal properties. Also, these may include calculation or display [[Artifact (error)| artifacts]] which are not characteristics of true fractals. ==History== <!--[[Image:animated construction of Sierpinski Triangle.gif|left|thumb|Animated construction of a [[Sierpiński Triangle]], only going nine generations of [[infinity|infinite]]—click for larger image.]] --> [[Image:Von Koch curve.gif|right|thumbnail|250px|To create a [[Koch snowflake]], one begins with an equilateral triangle and then replaces the middle third of every line segment with a pair of line segments that form an equilateral "bump." One then performs the same replacement on every line segment of the resulting shape, ad infinitum. With every [[iteration]], the perimeter of this shape increases by one third of the previous length. After any finite number of iterations, the perimeter will be finite and the area will be finite. If the iterations are extended infinitely, the perimeter will have an infinite length, encompassing a finite area. For this reason, the Koch snowflake and similar constructions were sometimes called "monster curves."<!-- This is ''not'' merely a matter of "approaching infinity but never reaching it". The actual length of the boundary of the union is infinite. [[User:Michael Hardy]] -->]] The [[mathematics]] behind fractals began to take shape in the 17th century when mathematician and philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] considered [[recursion|recursive]] self-similarity (although he made the mistake of thinking that only the straight line was self-similar in this sense). It was not until 1872 that
