The Apache License requires preservation of the [[copyright]] notice and [[disclaimer]], but it is not a [[copyleft]] license &mdash; it allows use of the source code for the development of [[proprietary software]] as well as [[free software|free]] and [[open source software]]. All software produced by the ASF or any of its projects or subjects is licensed according to the terms of the Apache License. Some non-ASF software is licensed using the Apache License as well. As of November 2010, over 6000 projects located at [[SourceForge.net]] were available under the terms of the Apache License.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sourceforge.net/search/?&fq%5B%5D=trove%3A401|title=Projects at SourceForge under Apache License|accessdate=November 25, 2010}}</ref> In a blog post from May 2008 [[Google]] mentioned that 25% of the 100,000 projects then hosted on [[Google Code]] were using the Apache License.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2008/05/standing-against-license-proliferation.html|title=Standing Against License Proliferation|accessdate=October 24, 2009}}</ref> == Version history == The '''Apache License 1.0''' was the original Apache License which applies only to older versions of Apache packages (such as version 1.2 of the Web server). The '''Apache License 1.1''' was approved by the ASF in 2000: ''The primary change from the 1.0 license is in the 'advertising clause' (section 3 of the 1.0 license); derived products are no longer required to include attribution in their advertising materials, but only in their documentation.''<ref name='Apache licenses'>{{cite web|url=http://www.apache.org/licenses/ |title=Licenses - The Apache Software Foundation |accessdate=July 7, 2007 }}</ref> The ASF adopted the '''Apache License 2.0''' in January 2004. The stated goals of the license included ''making the license easier for non-ASF projects to use, improving [[License compatibility|compatibility]] with [[GNU General Public License|GPL]]-based software, allowing the license to be included by reference instead of listed in every file, clarifying the license on contributions, and requiring a patent license on contributions that necessarily infringe a contributor's own patents''.<ref name='Apache licenses'/> == Licensing conditions == Like any [[free software license]], the Apache License allows the user of the software the freedom to use the software for any purpose, to distribute it, to modify it, and to distribute modified versions of the software, under the terms of the license. The Apache License, like [[comparison of free software licenses | most other permissive licenses]], does not require [[Derivative work|modified versions]] of the software to be distributed using the same license (in contrast to [[copyleft]] licenses). In every licensed file, any original copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices in redistributed code must be preserved (excluding notices that do not pertain to any part of the derivative works); and, in every licensed file changed, a notification must be added stating that changes have been made to that file. If a NOTICE text file is included as part of the distribution of the original work, then derivative works must include a readable copy of these notices (again, excluding notices not pertaining to any part of the derivative work), in at least one of three places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the derivative works, within the source form or documentation, or within a display generated by the derivative works (wherever such third-party notices normally appear). The contents of the NOTICE file do not modify the license, as they are for informational purposes only, and adding more attribution notices as addenda to the NOTICE text
