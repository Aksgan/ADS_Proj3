Shor]] and [[Andrew Steane]]. According to the quantum Hamming bound, encoding a single logical qubit and providing for arbitrary error correction in a single qubit requires a minimum of 5 physical qubits. * A more general class of codes (encompassing the former) are the [[stabilizer code]]s discovered by [[Daniel Gottesman]] ([http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9604038]), and by [[A. R. Calderbank]], [[Eric Rains]], [[Peter Shor]], and [[N. J. A. Sloane]] ([http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9605005], [http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9608006]); these are also called [[additive code]]s. * A newer idea is [[Alexei Kitaev]]'s [[toric code|topological quantum code]]s and the more general idea of a [[topological quantum computer]]. * Todd Brun, Igor Devetak, and Min-Hsiu Hsieh also constructed the [[entanglement-assisted stabilizer formalism]] as an extension of the standard [[stabilizer formalism]] that incorporates [[quantum entanglement]] shared between a sender and a receiver. That these codes allow indeed for quantum computations of arbitrary length is the content of the ''threshold theorem'', found by [[Michael Ben-Or]] and [[Dorit Aharonov]], which asserts that you can correct for all errors if you concatenate quantum codes such as the CSS codes—i.e. re-encode each logical qubit by the same code again, and so on, on logarithmically many levels—''provided'' the error rate of individual [[quantum gate]]s is below a certain threshold; as otherwise, the attempts to measure the syndrome and correct the errors would introduce more new errors than they correct for. As of late 2004, estimates for this threshold indicate that it could be as high as 1-3% [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0410199], provided that there are sufficiently many [[qubit]]s available. ==Experimental Realization== A team of European researchers have recently reported in a publication in Nature Photonics the successful demonstration of a quantum error correcting code achieved at the scale of quanta that should help paving the way to computers of the future<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/10/101004101638.htm]</ref>. ==Notes== {{Reflist}} ==Bibliography== *Freedman, Michael H.; Meyer, David A.; Luo, Feng: Z<sub>2</sub>-[[Systolic freedom]] and quantum codes.

If unconditional guarantees of security are needed, and if it is impractical for the communicating parties to arrange to share a secret that can be used in a [[Carter-Wegman MAC]], this technique might one day be faster than classical techniques given a [[quantum computer]] with 5 to 10 [[qubit]]s. However, these circumstances are very unusual and it is unlikely the technique will ever have a practical application; it is largely of theoretical interest. == See also == * [[Quantum cryptography]] * [[Quantum digital signature]] == External links == *[http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0102001 Original paper by Buhrman et al. from 2001] [[Category:Cryptographic hash functions]] [[Category:Quantum information science]]</text> </page> <page> <id>30809</id> <title>Quantum key distribution</title> <text>'''Quantum key distribution''' (QKD) uses [[quantum mechanics]] to guarantee [[secure communication]]. It enables two parties to produce a shared [[randomness|random]] secret [[key (cryptography)|key]] known only to them, which can then be used to encrypt and decrypt [[messages]]. It is often incorrectly called [[quantum cryptography]], as it is the most well known example of the group of quantum cryptographic tasks. An important and unique property of quantum distribution is the ability of the two communicating users to detect the presence of any third party trying to gain [[information theory|knowledge]] of the key. This results from a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics: the process of measuring a [[Physical system|quantum system]] in general disturbs the system. A third party trying to [[eavesdrop]] on the key must in some way measure it, thus introducing detectable anomalies. By using [[quantum superposition]]s or [[quantum entanglement]] and transmitting information in [[quantum state]]s, a communication system can be implemented which detects eavesdropping. If the level of eavesdropping is below a certain threshold, a key can be produced that is guaranteed to be secure (i.e. the eavesdropper has no information about), otherwise no secure key is possible and communication is aborted. The security of quantum key distribution relies on the foundations of quantum mechanics, in contrast to traditional key distribution protocol which relies on the computational difficulty of [[One-way function|certain mathematical functions]], and cannot provide any indication of eavesdropping or guarantee of key security. Quantum key distribution is only used to produce and distribute a key, not to transmit any message data. This key can then be used with any chosen [[encryption algorithm]] to encrypt (and decrypt) a message, which can then be transmitted over a standard [[communication channel]]. The algorithm most commonly associated with QKD is the [[one-time pad]], as it is [[provably secure]] when used with a secret, random key.<ref>C. E. Shannon , Bell Syst. Tech. J. 28, 656 (1949)</ref> == Quantum key exchange == Quantum communication involves encoding information in quantum states, or [[qubit]]s, as opposed to classical communication's use of [[bit]]s. Usually, [[photons]] are used for these quantum states. Quantum key distribution exploits certain properties of these quantum states to ensure its security. There are several different approaches to quantum key distribution, but they can be divided into two main categories depending on which property they exploit. ; Prepare and measure protocols : In contrast to classical physics, the act of measurement is an integral part of quantum mechanics. In general, measuring an unknown quantum state changes that state in some way. This is known as [[quantum indeterminacy]], and underlies results such as the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]], [[information-disturbance theorem]] and [[no cloning theorem]]. This can be exploited in order to detect any eavesdropping on communication
