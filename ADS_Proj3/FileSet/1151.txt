The complexity of the program and execution of a deterministic pushdown automaton is vastly less than that of a nondeterministic one. In the naive implementation, it must make copies of the stack every time a nondeterministic step occurs. The best known algorithm to test membership in any context-free language is [[CYK_algorithm#Extensions|Valiant's algorithm]], taking O(''n''<sup>2.378</sup>) time, whereas membership in a deterministic context-free language can be tested in O(''n'') time,<ref>{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=Michael A.|title=Introduction to Formal Language Theory|year=1978|publisher=Addison-Wesley|page=135}}</ref> where n is the length of the string. In an early result of [[computational complexity theory]], [[Stephen Cook]] showed in 1979 that deterministic context-free languages can be recognized by a [[deterministic Turing machine]] in polynomial time and [[Big-O notation|O]](log<sup>2</sup> ''n'') space; as a corollary, '''DCFL''' is a subset of the complexity class '''[[SC (complexity)|SC]]'''.<ref>S.

In [[quantum mechanics]], the [[Schrödinger equation]], which describes the continuous [[time evolution]] of a system's [[wave function]], is deterministic. However, the relationship between a system's wave function and the [[observable]] properties of the system appears to be non-deterministic. The systems studied in [[chaos theory]] are deterministic. If the initial state were known exactly, then the future state of such a system could be predicted. However, in practice, knowledge about the future state is limited by the precision with which the initial state can be measured. [[Markov chain]]s and other [[random walk]]s are not deterministic systems, because their development depends on random choices. A [[finite state machine]] may be either [[Deterministic finite-state machine|deterministic]] or [[Nondeterministic finite-state machine|non-deterministic]]. A [[pseudorandom number generator]] is a deterministic algorithm, although its evolution is deliberately made hard to predict; a [[hardware random number generator]], however, may be non-deterministic. == See also == * [[Deterministic system (philosophy)]] * [[Dynamical system]] * [[Stochastic process]] ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Determinism|System]] [[Category:Dynamical systems]] [[ar:نظام حتمي (رياضيات)]] [[es:Sistema determinista]] [[pl:Model deterministyczny]]</text> </page> <page> <id>10114</id> <title>Deuterium arc lamp</title> <text>A '''deuterium arc lamp''' (or simply '''deuterium lamp''') is a low-pressure [[gas-discharge light source]] often used in [[spectroscopy]] when a [[continuous spectrum]] in the [[ultraviolet]] region is needed. ==Principle of operation== [[Image:Deuterium lamp 1.png|thumb|right|450px|Emission [[spectrum]] of an ultraviolet deuterium arc lamp showing characteristic hydrogen [[Balmer lines]] (sharp peaks at 486 nm and 656 nm labeled D<sub>β</sub> and D<sub>α</sub> from left to right respectively), continuum emission in the ~160-400 nm region and [[Fulcher band]] emission between around 560 to 640 nm. The emission spectrum of deuterium differs slightly from that of [[hydrogen-1|protium]] due to the influence of [[hyperfine]] interactions, though these effects alter the wavelength of the lines by mere fractions of a [[nanometer]] and are too fine to be discerned by the [[spectrometer]] used here.]] A deuterium lamp uses a [[tungsten]] [[electrical filament|filament]] and anode placed on opposite sides of a [[nickel]] box structure designed to produce the best output spectrum. Unlike an incandescent bulb, the filament is not the source of light in deuterium lamps. Instead an arc is created from the filament to the anode, a similar process to [[arc lamps]]. Because the filament must be very hot before it can operate, it is heated for approximately twenty seconds before use. Because the discharge process produces its own heat, the heater is turned down after discharge begins. Although firing voltages are 300 to 500 volts, once the arc is created voltages drop to around 100 to 200 volts.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | title = Deuterium Lamps | publisher = Photron PTY.

The deuterium then emits light as it transitions back to its initial state. This continuous cycle is the origin of the continuous ultraviolet radiation. This process is not the same as the process of decay of atomic [[energy level|excited states]] ([[atomic emission]]), where electrons are excited and then emit radiation. Instead from the [[molecular emission]] process, where radiative decay of excited [[quantum state|states]], in this case of molecular deuterium (D<sub>2</sub>), causes the effect. Because the lamp operates at high temperatures, normal glass housings cannot be used for a casing (which would also block UV radiation). Instead, a [[fused quartz]], UV glass, or [[magnesium fluoride]] envelope is used depending on the specific function of the lamp.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | title = Deuterium Lamps | publisher = Real Labware | date = | url = http://www.reallabware.com/cathodeonLtd/deuterium.shtml | accessdate = 2007-10-07 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071005162342/http://www.reallabware.com/cathodeonLtd/deuterium.shtml <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-05}}</ref> The typical lifetime of a deuterium lamp is approximately 2000 hours (Most manufacturers guarantee 2000 hours, but newer lamps are consistently performing well out to 5000 hours and more). ==Deuterium lamp spectra== The deuterium lamp emits radiation extending from 112
