an appropriate manner to denote these. ==Pathfinders== J. R. Hendricks called the directions within a hypercubes "'''pathfinders'''", these directions are simplest denoted in a ternary number system as: Pf<sub>p</sub> where: p = <sub>k=0</sub>∑<sup>n-1</sup> (<sub>k</sub>i + 1) 3<sup>k</sup> <==> <<sub>k</sub>i> ; i ε {-1,0,1} This gives 3<sup>n</sup> directions. since every direction is traversed both ways one can limit to the upper half [(3<sup>n</sup>-1)/2,..,3<sup>n</sup>-1)] of the full range. With these pathfinders any line to be summed over (or r-agonal) can be specified: [ <sub>j</sub>0 <sub>k</sub>p <sub>l</sub>q ; #j=1 #k=r-1 ; k > j ] < <sub>j</sub>1 <sub>k</sub>θ <sub>l</sub>0 ; θ ε {-1,1} > ; p,q ε [0,..,m-1] which specifies all (broken) r-agonals, p and q ranges could be omitted from this description. The main (unbroken) r-agonals are thus given by the slight modification of the above: [ <sub>j</sub>0 <sub>k</sub>0 <sub>l</sub>-1 <sub>s</sub>p ; #j=1 #k+#l=r-1 ; k,l > j ] < <sub>j</sub>1 <sub>k</sub>1 <sub>l</sub>-1 <sub>s</sub>0 > ==Qualifications== A hypercube <sup>n</sup>H<sub>m</sub> with numbers in the analytical numberrange [0..m<sup>n</sup>-1] has the magic sum: <sup>n</sup>S<sub>m</sub> = m (m<sup>n</sup> - 1) / 2. Besides more specific qualifications the following are the most important, "summing" of course stands for "summing correctly to the magic sum" *{'''r-agonal'''} : all main (unbroken) r-agonals are summing. *{'''pan r-agonal'''} : all (unbroken and broken) r-agonals are summing. *{'''magic'''} : {1-agonal n-agonal} *{'''perfect'''} : {pan r-agonal; r = 1..n} Note: This series doesn't start with 0 since a nill-agonal doesn't exist, the numbers correspond with the usual name-calling: 1-agonal = monagonal, 2-agonal = diagonal, 3-agonal = triagonal etc.. Aside from this the number correspond to the amount of "-1" and "1" in the corresponding pathfinder. In case the hypercube also sum when all the numbers are raised to the power p one gets p-multimagic hypercubes. The above qualifiers are simply prepended onto the p-multimagic qualifier. This defines qualifications as {r-agonal 2-magic}. Here also "2-" is usually replaced by "bi", "3-" by "tri" etc. ("1-magic" would be "monomagic" but "mono" is usually omitted). The sum for p-Multimagic hypercubes can be found by using [[Faulhaber's formula]] and divide it by m<sup>n-1</sup>. Also "magic" (i.e. {1-agonal n-agonal}) is usually assumed, the [[perfect magic cube|Trump/Boyer {diagonal} cube]] is technically seen {1-agonal 2-agonal 3-agonal}. [[Nasik magic hypercube]] gives arguments for using {'''nasik'''} as synonymous to {'''perfect'''}. The strange generalization of square 'perfect' to using it synonymous to {diagonal} in cubes is however also resolve by putting curly brackets around qualifiers, so {'''perfect'''} means {pan r-agonal; r = 1..n} (as mentioned above). some minor qualifications are: *{'''<sup>n</sup>compact'''} : {all order 2 subhyper cubes sum to 2<sup>n</sup> <sup>n</sup>S<sub>m</sub> / m} *{'''<sup>n</sup>complete'''} : {all pairs halve an n-agonal apart sum equal (to (m<sup>n</sup> - 1)} {'''<sup>n</sup>compact'''} might be put in notation as : '''<sub>(k)</sub>∑ [<sub>j</sub>i + <sub>k</sub>1] = 2<sup>n</sup> <sup>n</sup>S<sub>m</sub> / m'''.<br /> {'''<sup>n</sup>complete'''} can simply written as: '''[<sub>j</sup>i] + [<sub>j</sup>i + <sub>k</sub>(m/2) ; #k=n ] = m<sup>n</sup> - 1'''.<br /> Where:<br /> <sub>(k)</sub>∑ is symbolic for summing all possible k's, there are 2<sup>n</sup> possibilities for <sub>k</sub>1.<br /> [<sub>j</sub>i + <sub>k</sub>1] expresses [<sub>j</sub>i] and all its r-agonal neighbors.<br /> for {complete} the complement of [<sub>j</sup>i] is at position [<sub>j</sup>i + <sub>k</sub>(m/2) ; #k=n ]. for squares: {'''<sup>2</sup>compact <sup>2</sup>complete'''} is the "modern/alternative qualification" of what Dame [[Kathleen Ollerenshaw]] called [[most-perfect magic square]], {<sup>n</sup>compact <sup>n</sup>complete} is the qualifier for the feature in more than 2 dimensions<br /> Caution: some people seems to equate {compact} with {<sup>2</sup>compact} instead of {<sup>n</sup>compact}. Since this introductory article is not the place to discuss these kind of issues I put in the dimensional pre-superscript <sup>n</sup> to both these qualifiers (which are defined as shown) <br /> consequences of {<sup>n</sup>compact} is that several figures also sum since they can be formed by adding/subtracting order 2 sub-hyper cubes. Issues like these go beyond this articles scope. ==Special hypercubes== The following hypercubes serve special purposes; ===The "normal hypercube"=== <sup>n</sup>N<sub>m</sub> : [<sub>k</sub>i] = <sub>k=0</sub>∑<sup>n-1</sup> <sub>k</sub>i m<sup>k</sup> This hypercube can be seen as the source of all numbers. A procedure called [http://www.magichypercubes.com/Encyclopedia/d/DynamicNumbering.html "Dynamic numbering"] makes use of the [[isomorphism]] of every hypercube with this normal, changing the source, changes the hypercube. Usually these sources are limited to direct products of normal hypercubes or normal [[Magic hyperbeam|hyperbeams]] (defined as having possibly other orders along the various directions). ===The "constant 1"=== <sup>n</sup>1<sub>m</sub> : [<sub>k</sub>i] = 1 The hypercube that is usually added to change the here used "analytic" number range into the "regular" number range. Other constant hypercubes are of course multiples of this one. == See also == *[[Magic hyperbeam]] *[[Nasik magic hypercube]] *[[Space diagonal]] *[[John R.
