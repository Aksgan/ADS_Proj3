The monarchs initially yielded to the revolutionaries' liberal demands. King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] was offered the title of [[Emperor]], but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, leading to a temporary setback for the movement. Conflict between King [[William I, German Emperor|William I]] of [[Prussia]] and the increasingly liberal parliament erupted over military reforms in 1862, and the king appointed [[Otto von Bismarck]] the new [[Prime Minister of Prussia]]. Bismarck successfully waged [[Second War of Schleswig|war on Denmark]] in 1864. Prussian victory in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866 enabled him to create the [[North German Federation]] (Norddeutscher Bund) and to exclude [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], formerly the leading German state, from the affairs of the remaining German states. ===German Empire 1871–1918=== {{Main|German Empire|World War I}} [[File:Wernerprokla.jpg|thumb|right|Foundation of modern Germany in [[Versailles]], France, 1871. [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] is at the centre in a white uniform.]] The state known as ''Germany'' was [[political union|unified]] as a modern nation-state in 1871, when the [[German Empire]] was forged, with the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] as its largest constituent. After the French defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the German Empire was proclaimed in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] on 18 January 1871. The [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] dynasty of Prussia ruled the new empire, whose capital was Berlin. The empire was a unification of all the scattered parts of Germany except Austria ({{lang|de|[[Kleindeutsche Lösung|''Kleindeutschland'']]}}, or "Lesser Germany"). But internally the official political unification came rather sequentially: Germany had no national flag until 1892 and no national hymn until after WW I. Beginning in 1884, Germany began establishing [[List of former German colonies|several colonies]] outside Europe. [[File:Map-DR-Prussia.svg|left|thumb|Imperial Germany (1871–1918), with the dominant [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in blue]] In the {{lang|de|''[[Gründerzeit]]''}} period following the [[unification of Germany]], Emperor [[William I, German Emperor|William I's]] foreign policy secured Germany's position as a great nation by forging alliances, isolating [[French Third Republic|France]] by diplomatic means, and avoiding war. Under [[William II, German Emperor|William II]], however, Germany, [[New Imperialism|like other European powers]], took an [[imperialism|imperialistic]] course leading to friction with neighbouring countries. Most alliances in which Germany had been previously involved were not renewed, and new alliances excluded the country. Specifically, France established new relationships by signing the [[Entente Cordiale]] with Great Britain and securing ties with the [[Russian Empire]]. Aside from its contacts with [[Austria-Hungary]], Germany became increasingly isolated. Germany's imperialism reached outside its own country, and it joined many other powers in Europe in claiming its share of Africa. The [[Berlin Conference]] divided Africa between the European powers. Germany owned several pieces of land in Africa including [[German East Africa]], [[German South-West Africa|South-West Africa]], [[Togoland|Togo]], and [[Cameroon]]. The [[Scramble for Africa]] caused tension between the [[great power]]s that may have contributed to the conditions that led to [[World War I]]. The [[Assassination in Sarajevo|assassination]] of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Austria's crown prince]] on 28 June 1914 triggered [[World War I]]. Germany, as part of the unsuccessful [[Central Powers]], suffered defeat against the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] in [[World War I casualties|one of the bloodiest]] conflicts of all time. An estimated two million German soldiers died in World War I.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,530319,00.html | title = Last German World War I Veteran Believed to Have Died | newspaper = Spiegel Online | date = 22 January 2008 | first = David | last = Crossland }}</ref> The [[German Revolution]] broke out in November 1918, and Emperor William II and all German ruling princes [[abdication|abdicated]]. An [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|armistice]] putting an end to the war was signed on 11 November, and Germany was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in June 1919. Its negotiation, contrary to traditional post-war diplomacy, excluded the defeated Central Powers. The treaty was perceived in Germany as a humiliating continuation of the war. The treaty's harshness is often cited as an influence toward the later rise of [[Nazism]] in the country.<ref name="lee h">{{cite book | first = Stephen J. | last = Lee | title = Europe, 1890–1945 | publisher = Routledge | year = 2003 | page = 131 | isbn = 0-415-25455-8 | location = London}}</ref> ===Weimar Republic 1919–1933=== {{Main|Weimar Republic}} [[File:Ausrufung Republik Scheidemann.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Philipp Scheidemann]] proclaiming the German Republic in 1918. The [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] era was dominated by political unrest.]] At the beginning of the German Revolution, Germany was declared a [[republic]] and the monarchy collapsed. However, the struggle for power continued, with radical-left communists [[Bavarian Socialist Republic|seizing power in Bavaria]], but failing to take control of all of Germany. The revolution came to an end in August 1919, when the [[Weimar Republic]] was formally established. The [[Weimar Constitution]] came into effect with its signing by [[President of Germany|President]] [[Friedrich Ebert]] on 11 August 1919. Suffering from the [[Great Depression]], the harsh peace conditions dictated by the [[Treaty of Versailles]], and a long succession of more or less unstable governments, the people of Germany increasingly lacked identification with their political system and the "Establishment Parties" in their [[parliamentary democracy]]. This was exacerbated by a widespread right-wing ([[monarchism|monarchist]], ''[[Völkisch movement|völkisch]]'', and Nazi) {{lang|de|''[[Dolchstoßlegende]]''}}, which promoted the view that Germany had lost World War I because of the efforts and influence of those who wanted to overthrow the government. The top brass of the Weimar government was accused of betraying the German Nation by signing the Versailles Treaty, while the radical left-wing [[communism|communists]], such as the [[Spartacist League]], had wanted a revolution to abolish "[[capitalism|capitalist rule]]" in favour of a {{lang|de|''[[Council communism|Räterepublik]]''}}, and were also targeted.
