invoking '''N'''), then <math>\Box p</math> is likewise a theorem. * '''K''', ''Distribution Axiom'': <!--[](''p'' → ''q'') → ([]p → []q)--> <math> \Box (p \rightarrow q) \rightarrow (\Box p \rightarrow \Box q)</math>. The weakest [[normal modal logic]], named ''K'' in honor of [[Saul Kripke]], is simply the [[propositional calculus]] augmented by <math>\Box</math>, the rule '''N''', and the axiom '''K'''. ''K'' is weak in that it fails to determine whether a proposition can be necessary but only contingently necessary. That is, it is not a theorem of ''K'' that if <!-- []p --> <math> \Box p </math> is true then <!-- [][]p --> <math> \Box \Box p </math> is true, i.e., that necessary truths are "necessarily necessary". If such perplexities are deemed forced and artificial, this defect of ''K'' is not a great one. In any case, different answers to such questions yield different systems of modal logic. Adding axioms to ''K'' gives rise to other well-known modal systems. One cannot prove in ''K'' that if "''p'' is necessary" then ''p'' is true. The axiom '''T''' remedies this defect: *'''T''', ''Reflexivity Axiom'': <!-- []p → p --> <math> \Box p \rightarrow p </math> (If ''p'' is necessary, then ''p'' is the case.) '''T''' holds in most but not all modal logics. Zeman (1973) describes a few exceptions, such as ''S1<sup>0</sup>''. Other well-known elementary axioms are: *'''4''': <math> \Box p \rightarrow \Box \Box p</math> *'''B''': <math> p \rightarrow \Box \Diamond p</math> *'''D''': <math> \Box p \rightarrow \Diamond p</math> *'''5''': <math> \Diamond p \rightarrow \Box \Diamond p </math> These yield the systems (axioms in bold): *''K'' := '''K''' + '''N''' *''T'' := ''K'' + '''T''' *''S4'' := ''T'' + '''4''' *''S5'' := ''S4'' + '''5''' *''D'' := ''K'' + '''D'''. ''K'' through ''S5'' form a nested hierarchy of systems, making up the core of [[normal modal logic]]. But specific rules or sets of rules may be appropriate for specific systems. For example, in deontic logic, <math> \Box p \rightarrow \Diamond p</math> (If it ought to be that ''p'', then it is permitted that ''p'') seems appropriate, but we should probably not include that <math> p \rightarrow \Box \Diamond p</math>. In fact, to do so is to commit the [[naturalistic fallacy]]. The commonly employed system ''S5'' simply makes all modal truths necessary. For example, if ''p'' is possible, then it is "necessary" that ''p'' is possible. Also, if ''p'' is necessary, then it is necessary that ''p'' is necessary. Other systems of modal logic have been formulated, in part because ''S5'' does not describe every kind of modality of interest. ==Alethic logic== Modalities of necessity and possibility are called ''alethic'' modalities. They are also sometimes called ''special'' modalities, from the [[Latin]] ''species''. Modal logic was first developed to deal with these concepts, and only afterward was extended to others. For this reason, or perhaps for their familiarity and simplicity, necessity and possibility are often casually treated as ''the'' subject matter of modal logic. Moreover it is easier to make sense of relativizing necessity, e.g. to legal, physical, nomological, epistemic, and so on, than it is to make sense of relativizing other notions. In [[classical modal logic]], a proposition is said to be *'''possible''' if and only if it is ''not necessarily false'' (regardless of whether it is actually true or actually false); *'''necessary''' if and only if it is ''not possibly false''; and *'''contingent''' if and only if it is ''not necessarily false'' and ''not necessarily true'' (i.e. possible but not necessarily true). In classical modal logic, therefore, either the notion of possibility or necessity may be taken to be basic, where these other notions are defined in terms of it in the manner of [[De Morgan duality]]. [[Intuitionistic modal logic]] treats possibility and necessity as not perfectly symmetric. For those with difficulty with the concept of something being possible but not true, the meaning of these terms may be made more comprehensible by thinking of multiple "possible worlds" (in the sense of [[Leibniz]]) or "alternate universes"; something "necessary" is true in all possible worlds, something "possible" is true in at least one possible world. These "possible world semantics" are formalized with [[Kripke semantics]]. ===Physical possibility=== Something is physically possible if it is permitted by the [[physical law|laws of physics]]. For example, current theory allows for there to be an [[atom]] with an [[atomic number]] of 150, though there may not in fact be any such atoms in existence. Similarly, while it is logically possible to accelerate beyond the [[speed of light]], modern science stipulates that it is not physically possible for material particles or information. ===Metaphysical possibility=== [[Philosophers]] ponder the properties that objects have independently of those dictated by scientific laws. For example, it might be metaphysically necessary, as some have thought, that all thinking beings have bodies and can experience the passage of [[time]], or that [[God]] exists (or does not). [[Saul Kripke]] has argued that every person necessarily has the parents they do have: anyone with different parents would not be the same person.<ref>Saul Kripke. ''Naming and Necessity''. Harvard University Press, 1980. pg 113</ref> Metaphysical possibility is generally thought to be more restricting than bare logical possibility (i.e., fewer things are metaphysically possible than are logically possible). Its exact relation to physical possibility is a matter of some dispute. Philosophers also disagree over whether metaphysical truths are necessary merely "by definition", or whether they reflect some underlying deep facts about the world, or something else entirely. ===Confusion with epistemic modalities=== Alethic modalities and epistemic modalities (see below) are often expressed in English using the same words. "It is possible that bigfoot exists" can mean either "Bigfoot ''could'' exist, whether or not bigfoot does in fact exist" (alethic), or more likely, "For all I know, bigfoot exists" (epistemic). ==Epistemic logic== {{Main|Epistemic logic}} '''Epistemic modalities''' (from the Greek ''episteme'', knowledge), deal with the ''certainty'' of sentences. The <math> \Box </math> operator is translated as "x knows that…", and the <math> \Diamond </math> operator is translated as "For all x knows, it may be true
