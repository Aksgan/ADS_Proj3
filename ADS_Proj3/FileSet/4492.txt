As it has no moving parts, it is moderately durable but has limited resolution, is prone to false signals from parasitic [[capacitive coupling]], and needs [[calibration]] during manufacture. It is therefore most often used in simple applications such as industrial controls and [[Interactive kiosk|kiosks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://electronicdesign.com/Articles/Index.cfm?AD=1&ArticleID=18592 |title=Please Touch!

An [[Cartesian coordinate system|X-Y grid]] is formed either by etching a single layer to form a grid pattern of [[electrode]]s, or by etching two separate, perpendicular layers of conductive material with parallel lines or tracks to form the grid (comparable to the [[pixel]] grid found in many [[LCD]] displays). The greater resolution of PCT allows operation without direct contact, such that the conducting layers can be coated with further protective insulating layers, and operate even under screen protectors, or behind weather and vandal-proof glass. Due to the top layer of a PCT being glass, PCT is a more robust solution versus resistive touch technology. Depending on the implementation, an active or passive stylus can be used instead of or in addition to a finger. This is common with [[point of sale]] devices that require signature capture. Gloved fingers may or may not be sensed, depending on the implementation and gain settings. Conductive smudges and similar interference on the panel surface can interfere with the performance. Such conductive smudges come mostly from sticky or sweaty finger tips, especially in high humidity environments. Collected dust, which adheres to the screen due to the moisture from fingertips can also be a problem. There are two types of PCT: Self Capacitance and Mutual Capacitance. =====Mutual Capacitance===== In mutual capacitive sensors, there is a [[capacitor]] at every intersection of each row and each column. A 12-by-16 array, for example, would have 192 independent capacitors. A [[voltage]] is applied to the rows or columns. Bringing a finger or conductive stylus close to the surface of the sensor changes the local electrostatic field which reduces the mutual capacitance. The capacitance change at every individual point on the grid can be measured to accurately determine the touch location by measuring the voltage in the other axis. Mutual capacitance allows [[multi-touch]] operation where multiple fingers, palms or stylus can be accurately tracked at the same time. =====Self Capacitance===== Self capacitance sensors can have the same X-Y grid as mutual capacitance sensors, but the columns and rows operate independently. With self capacitance, the capacitive load of a finger is measured on each column or row electrode by a current meter. This method produces a stronger signal than mutual capacitance, but it is unable to resolve accurately more than one finger, which results in "ghosting", or misplaced location sensing. ===Infrared=== An [[infrared]] touchscreen uses an array of X-Y infrared [[LED]] and [[photodetector]] pairs around the edges of the screen to detect a disruption in the pattern of LED beams. These LED beams cross each other in vertical and horizontal patterns. This helps the sensors pick up the exact location of the touch. A major benefit of such a system is that it can detect essentially any input including a finger, gloved finger, stylus or pen. It is generally used in outdoor applications and [[point-of-sale]] systems which can't rely on a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] (such as a bare finger) to activate the touchscreen. Unlike [[capacitive sensing|capacitive touchscreens]], infrared touchscreens do not require any patterning on the glass which increases durability and optical clarity of the overall system. ===Optical imaging=== This is a relatively modern development in touchscreen technology, in which two or more image sensors are placed around the edges (mostly the corners) of the screen. Infrared back lights are placed in the camera's field of view on the other side of the screen. A touch shows up as a shadow and each pair of cameras can then be pinpointed to locate the touch or even measure the size of the touching object (see [[visual hull#In two dimensions|visual hull]]). This technology is growing in popularity, due to its scalability, versatility, and affordability, especially for larger units. ===Dispersive signal technology=== Introduced in 2002 by [[3M]], this system uses sensors to detect the [[mechanical energy]] in the glass that occurs due to a touch. Complex algorithms then interpret this information and provide the actual location of the touch.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2009-03-16 |url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2008/02/13/innovation-series-touchscreen-technology.aspx |title=Innovation Series: Touchscreen Technology |work=The Motley Fool |date=2008-02-13 |author=Beyers, Tim}}</ref> The technology claims to be unaffected by dust and other outside elements, including scratches. Since there is no need for additional elements on screen, it also claims to provide excellent optical clarity. Also, since mechanical vibrations are used to detect a touch event, any object can be used to generate these events, including fingers and stylus. A downside is that after the initial touch the system cannot detect a motionless finger. ===Acoustic pulse recognition=== This system, introduced by [[Tyco International]]'s Elo division in 2006, uses [[piezoelectric effect|piezoelectric]] transducers located at various positions around the screen to turn the mechanical energy of a touch (vibration) into an electronic signal.<ref>{{Cite document | last = | first = | coauthors = | title =Acoustic Pulse Recognition Touchscreens | work = | pages = | language = | publisher =Elo Touch Systems | date =1888-07-31 | url = http://www.elotouch.com/Products/Touchscreens/AcousticPulseRecognition/default.asp | accessdate = 2008-08-25 | postscript =<!--None--> }}</ref> The screen hardware then uses an algorithm to determine the location of the touch based on the transducer signals. The touchscreen itself is made of ordinary glass, giving it good durability and optical clarity. It is usually able to function with scratches and dust on the screen with good accuracy. The technology is also well suited to displays that are physically larger. As with the Dispersive Signal Technology system, after the initial touch, a motionless finger cannot be detected. However, for the same reason, the touch recognition is not disrupted by any resting objects. == Construction == There are several principal
