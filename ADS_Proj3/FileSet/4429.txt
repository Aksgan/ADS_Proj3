Macintosh]] version was released. It featured graphics by Marney Morris and was the most powerful version at the time. It was popular in schools and contained a unique feature in which graphics could be transferred to or from a [[MacPaint]] file. Graphics libraries were a hot item for The Print Shop, and came from Brøderbund and other vendors. Libraries were produced for the original version and continued to be rolled out as late as the 1990s. User-produced graphics were also commonly distributed by various user groups, and even submitted to [[Disk magazine|disk magazines]], such as the [[Softdisk (disk magazine)|Softdisk]] family of magazines. ==The New Print Shop== '''The New Print Shop''' came out in 1988 for Apple II and [[MS-DOS|DOS]], and improved on the original. Print Shop Deluxe, for Mac, DOS, and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], followed in 1993. Deluxe used a new all-graphical interface still found in Print Shop programs today and allowed for creation of calendars. Print Shop Deluxe Companion added new modules and graphics, and the Ensemble version combined The Print Shop, the Companion, and several graphics libraries on one CD. Many new versions of The Print Shop followed, such as Ensemble II. Now over 20 years old, Print Shop still generates printed greeting cards, banners, and signs. It has kept with the times by offering new types of printed output, including CD and DVD labels and inserts, [[iPod]] skins, and photo book pages. On January 15, 2010, a new version for the PC supporting Windows 7 titled '''The Print Shop 2.0''' was released, published by [[Encore, Inc.]]. This version is not backwards compatible and has been poorly received. It is published in Standard, Deluxe, and Professional variants. To address Windows 7 support for pre-2.0 projects, an incremental release to the old line, '''The Print Shop Version 23.1''' was released in July of 2010. For Mac OS X, the most recent version is 2.0, developed and published by [[Software MacKiev]]. ==External links== * [http://www.broderbund.com/c-31-the-print-shop.aspx The Print Shop for PC] at [[Brøderbund]] website * [http://www.mackiev.com/print_shop.html Mac OS X version of The Print Shop] at [[Software MacKiev|Software MacKiev's]] website {{DEFAULTSORT:Print Shop, The}} [[Category:Desktop publishing software]] [[Category:Apple II software]] [[Category:Atari 8-bit family software]] [[Category:Commodore 64 software]] [[Category:DOS software]] [[Category:Mac OS software]] [[Category:Windows software]] [[Category:1984 software]] [[ja:プリントショップ]]</text> </page> <page> <id>37436</id> <title>The Psychology of the Psychic</title> <text>{{Infobox_Book | name = The Psychology of the Psychic | image = | author = [[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]] (1980 edition with [[Richard Kammann]]) | cover_artist = | publisher = [[Prometheus Books]] | release_date = 1980 and December 2000 | media_type = Hardcover/Paperback | pages = 336 pages | size_weight = | isbn = ISBN 1573927988 | dewey= 133.8/01/9 21 | congress= BF1042 .M33 2000 | oclc= 43296735 }} '''The Psychology of the Psychic''' is a work by [[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]] and Dr Richard Kammann, written while both were lecturers in psychology at [[New Zealand]]'s [[University of Otago]]. The original edition published in 1980 was co-authored with the late Richard Kammann. The second edition was published in 2000. Each edition contains a Foreword written by [[Martin Gardner]]. The second edition is dedicated to [[Richard Kammann]] (1934-1984). Kammann died of a heart attack in 1984. Both of Kammann's brothers and one of his sisters also died due to heart attacks. "The Psychology of the Psychic" is a skeptical analysis of claims of the paranormal. The book critiques a few notable studies within [[parapsychology]] from the period 1970-2000. The book contains a critical analysis of the [[remote viewing]] experiments carried out in the 1970s at [[Stanford Research Institute]] (SRI) by two physicists [[Russell Targ]] and [[Harold Puthoff]]. These studies formed part of the highly publicized STARGATE studies funded by the Defense Intelligence Agency and CIA. Marks describes flaws in the experimental protocols of the original SRI that enabled the statistical significance of the results to become inflated. Marks reached the conclusion: "Remote viewing is nothing more than a self-fulfilling subjective delusion" (p. 92). Marks is equally skeptical about paranormal claims such as the [[ganzfeld]], psychic staring and psychic pets as described by [[Rupert Sheldrake]], and [[Uri Geller]]'s performances. Regarding Geller, Marks concludes: "As far as I am aware, from my observation, Geller has no psychic ability whatsoever. However, he's a very clever, well-practiced magician" (p. 224). In the final section of the book, some principles that Marks believes are helpful to the analysis of paranormal claims are described. Four different meanings of the term [[coincidence]] are described. Skeptical analyses of the research of [[Alister Hardy]] and [[Arthur Koestler]] lead Marks to define "Koestler's Fallacy" as the assumption that odd matches of random events cannot arise by chance. Marks illustrates the fact that such odd matches do regularly occur with examples from his own experience. The Psychology of the Psychic describes research evidence concerning self-perpetuating beliefs and superstitious thinking. Finally the book advocates what Marks and Kammann call "The Art of Doubt", the application of alternative skeptical thinking about the conventional beliefs and assumptions of our time. In the Foreword to the first edition, [[Martin Gardner]] appeals to his readers, opining: : "For every person who reads this valuable book there are hundreds of na&iuml;ve souls who would prefer to have their spines tingled by a sensational but worthless potboiler by some hack journalist of the paranormal. You who now read these sentences join a small but wiser minority". ==External links== *Marks, D.F. & Kammann, R. (1980). ''The Psychology of the Psychic''.
