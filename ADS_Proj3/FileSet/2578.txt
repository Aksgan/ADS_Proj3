loop satisfying ''zx''.''yz'' = ''z''.''xy''.''z''. ****[[Bol loop|Bruck loop]]: a [[bol loop]] whose inverse satisfies (''ab'') = (''a'')(''b''). ***[[Group (mathematics)|Group]]: an associative loop. The following diagram summarizes two possible paths from magma to group. :[[Image:Magma to Group.svg|250px]] NOTE: *'''a''' = [[associativity]], '''d''' = [[divisibility]], '''e''' = [[identity element|identity]], '''i''' = [[invertibility]]. '''d''' and '''i''' jointly imply the [[cancellation property]]. *'''G''' = group, '''L''' = loop, '''M''' = magma, '''N''' = monoid, '''Q''' = quasigroup, '''S''' = semigroup. '''One''' [[ternary operation]], heap product, denoted ''xyz'': *[[heap (mathematics)|Semiheap]]: ''S'' is closed under heap product, which para-associates: ''vwx.yz'' = ''v.wxy.z'' = ''vw.xyz''. **[[heap (mathematics)|Idempotent semiheap]]: A semiheap satisfying ''xxx'' = ''x''. ***[[heap (mathematics)|Generalized heap]]: An idempotent semiheap satisfying ''yy.zzx'' = ''zz.yyx'' and ''xyy.zz'' = ''xzz.yy''. **[[heap (mathematics)|Heap]]: A semiheap satisfying ''yyx'' = ''xyy'' = ''x''. ***[[heap (mathematics)|Group]]: A heap with distinguished element 1. The group product of ''x'' and ''y'' is defined as ''x''1''y'', and the group inverse of ''x'' is defined as 1''x''1. ===Lattice-like structures=== The [[binary operations]] [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] and [[join (mathematics)|join]], which characterize nearly all structures in this section, are [[idempotent]], by assumption or proof. Latticoids are the only lattice-like structure that do not associate. N.B. "Lattice" is also employed in a number of [[lattice (group)|group-theoretic contexts]], including to refer to a [[discrete subgroup]] of the [[real vector space]] '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> that spans '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>. Some concepts from [[order theory]] that recur in lattice theory: *[[Strict partial order]]: A set ''S'' with a relation that is [[transitive relation|transitive]] and [[irreflexive relation|irreflexive]]. **[[Preordered set]]: A strict partial order that is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]]. ***[[Directed set]]: A preordered set such that every pair of elements has an [[upper bound]]. ***[[Partially ordered set]]: A preordered set with the [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetry]] property. ****[[Totally ordered set]]: A partially ordered set with [[total relation|totality]] replacing [[reflexive relation|reflexivity]]. '''One''' [[binary operation]], one of [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] or [[join (mathematics)|join]], and denoted by [[concatenation]]. The two structures below are also [[magma (algebra)|magmas]]; see the preceding section. *[[Semilattice]]: the [[binary operation]] commutes and associates. Also a [[partially ordered set]] closed under one of pairwise [[greatest lower bound]] or [[least upper bound]]. **[[Lattice (order)|Lattice]]: a semilattice with a unary operation, dualization, denoted by enclosure within a pair of brackets. If ''xy'' denotes meet, (''xy'') denotes join, and vice versa. The binary and unary operations interact via a form of the [[absorption law]], ''x''(''xy'') = ''x'' = (''x''(''xy'')). '''Two''' [[binary operations]], [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] ([[infix]] ∧) and [[join (mathematics)|join]] (infix ∨). [[Duality]] means that interchanging all meets and joins preserves truth. *[[Latticoid]]: meet and join [[Commutativity|commute]] but do not [[associate]]. *[[Skew lattice]]: meet and join associate but do not commute. *[[Lattice (order)|Lattice]]: a [[commutative]] skew lattice, an [[associative]] latticoid, and both a [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] and [[join]] [[semilattice]]. Meet and join interact via the [[absorption law]]: ''x''∧(''x''∨''y'') = ''x''. Also a [[partially ordered set]] closed under pairwise [[greatest lower bound]] and [[least upper bound]]. ** [[Bounded lattice]]: a lattice with two distinguished elements, the [[greatest element|greatest]] (1) and the [[greatest element|least element]] (0), such that ''x''∨1=1 and ''x''∨0=''x''. [[duality|Dualizing]] requires interchanging 0 and 1. A bounded lattice is a [[pointed set]]. ***[[Complete lattice]]: ****[[Algebraic lattice]]: **[[Involutive lattice]]: a lattice with a unary operation, denoted by postfix ', and satisfying ''x''"=''x'' and (''x''∨''y'')' = ''x' ''∧''y' ''. **[[Relatively complemented lattice]]: ** [[Complemented lattice]]: a lattice with a unary operation, [[complemented lattice|complementation]], denoted by [[reverse Polish notation|postfix]] ', such that ''x''∧''x' '' = 0 and 1=0'. 0 and 1 bound ''S''. *** [[Orthocomplemented lattice]]: a complemented lattice satisfying ''x''" = ''x'' and ''x''∨''y''=''y'' ↔ ''y' ''∨''x' ''= ''x' '' (complementation is [[monotonic function|order reversing]]). ****[[Orthomodular lattice]]: an ortholattice such that (''x'' ≤ ''y'') → (''x'' ∨ (''x''<sup>⊥</sup> ∧ ''y'') = ''y'') holds. ***[[DeMorgan algebra]]: a complemented lattice satisfying ''x''" = ''x'' and (''x''∨''y'')' = ''x' ''∧''y' ''. Also a bounded involutive lattice. ** [[Modular lattice]]: a lattice satisfying the modular identity, ''x''∨(''y''∧(''x''∨''z'')) = (''x''∨''y'')∧(''x''∨''z''). *** [[Metric lattice]]: ***[[Projective lattice]]: *** [[Arguesian lattice]]: a modular lattice satisfying the identity . *** [[Distributive lattice]]: a lattice in which each of meet and join [[distributive lattice|distributes]] over the other. Distributive lattices are modular, but the converse need not hold. **** [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]: a complemented distributive lattice. Either of meet or join can be defined in terms of the other and complementation. *****[[Boolean algebra with operators]]: a Boolean algebra with one or more added operations, usually unary. Let a postfix * denote any added unary operation. Then 0* = 0 and (''x''∨''y'')* = ''x''*∨''y''*. More generally, all added operations (a) evaluate to 0 if any argument is 0, and (b) are [[lattice (order)|join preserving]], i.e., distribute over join. ******[[Modal logic|Modal algebra]]: a Boolean algebra with a single added operator, the [[modal operator]]. *******[[Derivative algebra (abstract algebra)|Derivative algebra]]: a modal algebra whose added unary operation, the [[derivative operator]], satisfies ''x''**∨''x''*∨''x'' = ''x''*∨''x''. ******* [[Interior algebra]]: a modal algebra whose added unary operation, the [[interior operator]], satisfies ''x''*∨''x'' = ''x'' and ''x''** = ''x''*. The dual is a [[closure algebra]]. ******** [[Monadic Boolean algebra]]: a closure algebra whose added unary operation, the [[existential quantifier]], denoted by prefix ∃, satisfies the axiom ∃(∃''x'')' = (∃''x'')'. The dual operator, ∀''x'' := (∃''x' '')' is the [[universal quantifier]]. ::::Three structures whose intended interpretations are [[first order logic]]: ::::*[[Polyadic algebra]]: a [[monadic Boolean algebra]] with a second unary operation, denoted by prefixed '''S'''. ''I'' is an [[index set]], ''J'',''K''&sub;''I''. &exist; maps each ''J'' into the [[quantifier]] &exist;(''J''). '''S''' maps ''I''&rarr;''I'' [[Transformation (geometry)|transformations]] into Boolean [[endomorphism]]s on ''S''. &sigma;, &tau; range over possible transformations; &delta; is the [[identity transformation]]. The axioms are: &exist;(&empty;)''a''=''a'', &exist;(''J''&cup;''K'') = &exist;(''J'')&exist;(''K''), '''S'''(&delta;)''a'' = ''a'', '''S'''(&sigma;)'''S'''(&tau;) = '''S'''(&sigma;&tau;), '''S'''(&sigma;)&exist;(''J'') = '''S'''(&tau;)&exist;(''J'') (&forall;''i''&isin;''I''-''J'', such that &sigma;''i''=&tau;''i''), and &exist;(''J'')'''S'''(&tau;) = '''S'''(&tau;)&exist;(&tau;<sup>-1</sup>''J'') (&tau; [[injective]]).<ref>Pp. 26-28, 251, of [[Paul Halmos]] (1962) ''Algebraic Logic''.
