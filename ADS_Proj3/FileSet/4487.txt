It is preserved in the left and bottom margins of a Latin legal treatise in a ninth- or tenth-century manuscript, where it is written upside down.<ref>The manuscript is #201 of the Bibliothèque communautaire et interuniversitaire of [[Clermont-Ferrand]]. The poem is on folio 89v. See Fig. 1 in Paden and Paden, p. 14.</ref> Line 14 is missing, but has been supplied by the editors on the basis of the pattern of final three lines. It has been edited and translated into English by William Doremus Paden and Frances Freeman Paden: {| | :''Tomida femina :''in tomida via sedea; :''tomid infant :''in falda sua tenea; :''tomides mans :''et tomidas pes, :''tomidas carnes :''que est colbe recebrunt; :''tomide fust :''et tomides fer :''que istæ colbe doner''unt. :''Exs''unt'' en dolores :''d'os en polpa :''[de polpa en curi] :''de curi in pel :''de pel in erpa. :''Terra madre susipiat dolores.''<ref>Paden and Paden, p. 15.</ref> | :A swollen woman :Sat in a swollen road; :A swollen child :She held in her lap; :Swollen hand :And swollen feet, :Swollen flesh :That will take this blow; :Swollen wood :And swollen iron :That will give this blow. :The pain goes out :From bone to flesh, :From flesh to skin, :From skin to hair, :From hair to grass; :Let mother earth receive the pain.<ref>Paden and Paden, p. 16.</ref> |} The meaning of the poetic charm, a "[[talking cure]]", is uncertain. Possibly it is intended as a cure for an [[edema]]. The swollen woman of line 1 and the swollen child of line 3 may both be patients, or perhaps only one of them. The charm transfers the swelling from the patient to wood and iron, possibly referring to medical instruments, and thence to the earth. On the other hand, the swollen woman and child "held in her lap" may refer to a [[pregnancy]]. The chanter may be the midwife. The poem's editors note the fittingness of an image of birth at the beginning of [[Occitan literature]]. ==Note== {{reflist}} ==Sources== *W. D. Paden and F. F. Paden. 2007.

Tony Kent made a major contribution to the development of information science and information services both in the UK and internationally, particularly in the field of chemistry. The name 'Strix' was chosen to reflect Tony's interest in ornithology, and as the name of the last and most successful information retrieval packages that he created. The Award is given in recognition of an outstanding contribution to the field of information retrieval that meets one of the following criteria: * a major and/or sustained contribution to the theoretical or experimental understanding of the information retrieval process; * development of, or significant improvement in, mechanisms, a product or service for the retrieval of information, either generally or in a specialised field; * development of, or significant improvement in, ease of access to an information service; * a sustained contribution over a period of years to the field of information retrieval; for example, by running an information service or by contributing at national or international level to organisations active in the field.
