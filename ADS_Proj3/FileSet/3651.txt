An '''LC circuit''' is a variety of '''resonant circuit''' or '''tuned circuit''' and consists of an [[inductor]], represented by the letter L, and a [[capacitor]], represented by the letter C. When connected together, an [[electric current]] can alternate between them at the circuit's [[resonant frequency]]: Since an LC circuit is nothing more than a harmonic oscillator where charge is the conjugate variable, the quantum mechanically solution is known exactly. :<math>\omega = \sqrt{1 \over LC}</math> where '''L''' is the [[inductance]] in [[Henry (unit)|henries]], and '''C''' is the [[capacitance]] in [[farad]]s. The [[angular frequency]] <math>\omega\,</math> has units of [[radian]]s per second. A capacitor stores energy in the electric field between the plates, which can be written as follows: :<math>U=\frac{1}{2} C V^2 =\frac{Q^2}{2C}</math> since <math>C=\frac{Q}{V}</math> Likewise, an inductor stores energy in the magnetic field depending on the current, which can be written as follows: :<math>U=\frac{1}{2} L I^2 =\frac{\phi^2}{2L}</math> since <math>\phi=L I \ </math> Using charge as the conjugate variable, and magnetic flux as the conjugate "momentum", one can develop a Schrödinger equation to describe the stored energy in the system. :<math>i \hbar \frac{d\psi}{dt} = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2 L} \nabla^2 \psi+\frac{Q^2}{2C} \psi </math> where <math> \psi </math> is a function of charge ==One-dimensional harmonic oscillator== ===Hamiltonian and energy eigenstates=== [[Image:HarmOsziFunktionen.png|thumb|Wavefunction representations for the first eight bound eigenstates, ''n'' = 0 to 7.

The horizontal axis shows the position ''x'', and brighter colors represent higher probability densities.]] Like the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator problem, an LC circuit can be quantized by either solving the Schrödinger equation or using creation and annihilation operators. The energy stored in the inductor can be looked at as a "kinetic energy term" and the energy stored in the capacitor can be looked at as a "potential energy term". The Hamiltonian of such a system is: :<math> H=\frac{\phi^2}{2L} + \frac{1}{2} L \omega ^2 Q^2</math> where Q is the charge operator, and <math> \phi </math> is the magnetic flux operator. The first term represents the energy stored in an inductor, and the second term represents the energy stored in a capacitor. In order to find the energy levels and the corresponding energy eigenstates, we must solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation, :<math> H |\psi> =E |\psi> \ </math> :<math>E \psi = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2 L} \nabla^2 \psi+\frac{1}{2} L \omega ^2 Q^2 \psi </math> Since an LC circuit really is an electrical analog to the harmonic oscillator, solving the Schrödinger equation yields a family of solutions (the Hermite polynomials). :<math> \left\langle Q | \psi_n \right\rangle = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2^n\,n!}} \cdot \left(\frac{L\omega}{\pi \hbar}\right)^{1/4} \cdot \exp \left(- \frac{L\omega Q^2}{2 \hbar} \right) \cdot H_n\left(\sqrt{\frac{L\omega}{\hbar}} Q \right) </math> :<math> n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots</math> ==Magnetic Flux as a Conjugate Variable== A completely equivalent solution can be found using magnetic flux as the conjugate variable where the conjugate "momentum" is equal to capacitance times the time derivative of magnetic flux. The conjugate "momentum" is really the charge. :<math> \pi = C \frac{d\phi}{dt}</math> Using Kirchoff's Junction Rule, the following relationship can be obtained: :<math>C \frac{dV}{dt} + \frac{1}{L} \int_0^t V\,dt \, =0</math> Since <math> V= \frac{d\phi}{dt} </math>, the above equation can be written as follows: :<math>C \frac{d^2 \phi}{dt^2} + \frac{1}{L} \phi \, =0</math> Converting this into a Hamiltonian, one can develop a Schrödinger equation as follows: :<math>i \hbar \frac{d\psi}{dt} = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2 C} \nabla^2 \psi+\frac{\phi^2}{2L} \psi </math> where <math> \psi </math> is a function of magnetic flux ==Quantization of coupled LC
