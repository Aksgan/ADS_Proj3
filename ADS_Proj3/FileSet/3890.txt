SPICE combined operating point solutions, transient analysis, and various small-signal analyses with the circuit elements and device models needed to successfully simulate many circuits. === Analyses === SPICE2 included these analyses: * AC analysis ([[linear]] [[small signal model|small-signal]] frequency domain analysis) * DC analysis (nonlinear [[quiescent point]] calculation) * DC transfer curve analysis (a sequence of nonlinear operating points calculated while sweeping an input voltage or current, or a circuit parameter) * Noise analysis (a small signal analysis done using an adjoint matrix technique which sums uncorrelated noise currents at a chosen output point) * [[Transfer function]] analysis (a small-signal input/output gain and impedance calculation) * Transient analysis (time-domain large-signal solution of nonlinear differential algebraic equations) Since SPICE is generally used to model [[nonlinear]] circuits, the small signal analyses are necessarily preceded by a [[quiescent point]] calculation at which the circuit is linearized. SPICE2 also contained code for other small-signal analyses: [[sensitivity analysis]], [[pole-zero analysis]], and [[small-signal]] [[distortion]] analysis. Analysis at various temperatures was done by automatically updating semiconductor model parameters for temperature, allowing the circuit to be simulated at temperature extremes. Other circuit simulators have since added many analyses beyond those in SPICE2 to address changing industry requirements. Parametric sweeps were added to analyze circuit performance with changing manufacturing tolerances or operating conditions. Loop gain and stability calculations were added for analog circuits. [[Harmonic balance]] or time-domain steady state analyses were added for RF and switched-capacitor circuit design. However, a public-domain circuit simulator containing the modern analyses and features needed to become a successor in popularity to SPICE has not yet emerged.<ref name="SPICE4"/> === Device models === SPICE2 included many semiconductor device [[transistor models|compact models]]: three levels of MOSFET model, a combined [[Ebers-Moll model|Ebers–Moll]] and [[Gummel–Poon model|Gummel-Poon bipolar model]], a [[JFET]] model, and a model for a [[diode|junction diode]]. In addition, it had many other elements: resistors, capacitors, inductors (including [[Inductance#Coupled inductors|coupling]]), independent [[voltage source|voltage]] and [[current source]]s, ideal [[transmission line]]s, and voltage and current controlled sources. SPICE3 added more sophisticated MOSFET models, which were required due to advances in semiconductor technology. In particular, the [[BSIM]] family of models were added, which were also developed at UC Berkeley. Commercial and industrial SPICE simulators have added many other device models as technology advanced and earlier models became inaccurate. To attempt standardization of these models so that a set of model parameters may be used in different simulators, an industry working group was formed, the [[Compact Model Council]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geia.org/index.asp?bid=597 |title=CMC - Compact Model Council | publisher=GEIA}}</ref>, to choose, maintain and promote the use of [http://www.geia.org/index.asp?bid=1333 standard models]. The standard models today include [http://www-device.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bsim3 BSIM3], [http://www-device.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bsim3/bsim4.html BSIM4], [http://www-device.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bsimsoi BSIMSOI], [http://pspmodel.asu.edu/ PSP], [http://www.iee.et.tu-dresden.de/iee/eb/hic_new/hic_start.html HICUM], and [http://mextram.ewi.tudelft.nl MEXTRAM]. ===Input and output: Netlists, schematic capture and plotting=== SPICE2 took a text [[netlist]] as input and produced line-printer listings as output, which fit with the computing environment in 1975. These listings were either columns of numbers corresponding to calculated outputs (typically voltages or currents), or line-printer [[ASCII art|character "plots"]]. SPICE3 retained the netlist for circuit description, but allowed analyses to be controlled from a [[command line interpreter|command-line]] interface similar to the [[C shell]]. SPICE3 also added basic [[X-Window]] plotting, as [[UNIX]] and engineering [[workstation]]s became common. Vendors and various free software projects have added [[schematic capture]] front-ends to SPICE, allowing a [[schematic diagram]] of the circuit to be drawn and the netlist to be automatically generated. Also, [[graphical user interface]]s were added for selecting the simulations to be done and manipulating the voltage and current output vectors. In addition, very capable graphing utilities have been added to see waveforms and graphs of parametric dependencies. Several free versions of these extended programs are available, some as introductory [[PSpice|limited packages]], and some [[Linear Technology|without restrictions]]. == See also == {{Portal|Electronics|Free software}} * Articles on SPICE-like and other circuit simulators are listed in [[:Category:Electronic circuit simulators]] * [[Input Output Buffer Information Specification]] (IBIS) * [[List of free electronics circuit simulators]] * [[Transistor models]] == References == {{reflist|2}} == External links == === Histories, original papers === * [http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1973/22871.html The original SPICE1 paper] * [http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1975/9602.html L.
