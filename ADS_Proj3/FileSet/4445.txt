of information gathered during the restoration campaign ended in 1995. The project was conceived by Arch. Riccardo Dalla Negra and realised by Lapo Bertini, Silvia Brotini, Auro Pampaloni, Marco Menichetti, Lara Calosi and Arianna Sacchetti with the technological support of [[IBM]] and [[Eastman Kodak]] and the financial support of the ''Ministero dei Beni Culturali'' of Italy and ''Ente Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze''. The project started in 1992 and ended in 2000. ==References== *{{cite book|title=Cupola di Santa Maria del Fiore: il cantiere di restauro 1980-1995, a cura di Cristina Acidini Luchinat e Riccardo Dalla Negra|publisher=Istituto poligrafico e Zecca dello Stato (Roma)|year=1995|isbn=8824039561}} [http://lccn.loc.gov/95227072 Library of Congress permalink] *{{cite book|title=Cupola di Santa Maria del Fiore: architettura, pittura, restauro, a cura di Cristina Acidini Luchinat e Riccardo Dalla Negra|publisher=Istituto poligrafico e Zecca dello Stato (Roma)|year=1996|isbn=8824038395}} [http://lccn.loc.gov/97125698 Library of Congress permalink] *[http://www.sbap-fi.beniculturali.it/index.php?it/223/progetti-e-iniziative-culturali Thesaurus Florentinus project page (in Italian)], ''Soprintendenza ai Beni Architettonici e Paesaggisitici di Firenze, Ministero dei Beni Culturali'' ==External links== *[http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november95/11clips.html#tf D-Lib Magazine, November 1995] *[http://www.mega.it/review/art/affc.htm Mega Review (in Italian)] *[http://web.archive.org/web/20031203115457/www.firenze.net/giudizio.universale/english/index.html Cupola, a voyage within (in English)], from [http://www.archive.org/web/web.php Waybackmachine] *[http://web.archive.org/web/20031203222147/www.firenze.net/giudizio.universale/ Viaggio attorno alla Cupola (in Italian)], from [http://www.archive.org/web/web.php Waybackmachine] [[Category:Art conservation]] [[Category:Digital library projects]]</text> </page> <page> <id>37586</id> <title>Thin-film memory</title> <text>'''Thin-film memory''' is a high-speed variation of [[core memory]] developed by [[UNIVAC|Sperry Rand]] in a government-funded research project. Instead of threading individual [[Ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] cores on wires, thin-film memory consisted of 4 micrometre thick dots of [[permalloy]], an [[iron]]-[[nickel]] alloy, deposited on small glass plates by vacuum evaporation techniques and a mask. The drive and sense lines were then added using [[printed circuit]] wiring over the alloy dots. This provided very fast access times in the range of 670 nanoseconds, but was very expensive to produce. In 1962, the [[UNIVAC 1107]], intended for the civilian marketplace, used thin-film memory only for its 128-word general register stack. [[Military computer]]s, where cost was less of a concern, used larger amounts of thin-film memory. Thin film was also used in a number of high-speed computer projects, including the high-end of the [[IBM]] [[System/360]] line, but general advances in core tended to keep pace. ==External links== * [http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/navy-thin-film-memory-desc.html Thin Film] {{Magnetic storage media}} [[Category:Computer memory]] [[Category:Non-volatile memory]] [[Category:Thin films]] {{computer-hardware-stub}} [[de:Thin Film Memory]]</text> </page> <page> <id>37589</id> <title>Thin plate spline</title> <text>{{Confusing|date=December 2006}} This is a brief derivation for the closed form solutions for ''smoothing Thin Plate Spline''. Details about these splines can be found in (Wahba, 1990). '''Thin plate splines (TPS)''' were introduced to [[geometric design]] by Duchon (Duchon, 1976). The name ''thin plate spline'' refers to a physical analogy involving the bending of a thin sheet of metal. In the physical setting, the deflection is in the <math>z</math> direction, orthogonal to the plane. In order to apply this idea to the problem of coordinate transformation, one interprets the lifting of the plate as a displacement of the <math>x</math> or <math>y</math> coordinates within the plane. In 2D cases, given a set of <math>K</math> corresponding points, the TPS warp is described by <math>2(K+3)</math> parameters which include 6 global affine motion parameters and <math>2K</math> coefficients for correspondences of the control points. These parameters are computed by solving a linear system, in other words, TPS has closed-form solution. ''Smoothing TPS'' is a regularized TPS. The model has a parameter <math>\lambda</math> to control how non-rigid is allowed for the deformation. When <math>\lambda \rightarrow \infty</math>, TPS is equal to an affine transformation, as the roughest model for non-rigid deformation. ==Radial basis function== {{Main|Radial basis function}} Given a set of control points <math>\{w_{i}, i = 1,2, \ldots,K\}</math>, a radial basis function basically defines a spatial mapping which maps any location <math>x</math> in space to a new location <math>f(x)</math>, represented by, :<math> f(x) = \sum_{i = 1}^K c_{i}\varphi(\left\| x - w_{i}\right\|) </math> where <math>\left\|\cdot\right\|</math> denotes the usual [[Norm (mathematics)|Euclidean norm]] and <math>\{c_{i}\}</math> is a set of mapping coefficients. One possible choice for the kernel function <math>\phi</math> is the thin plate spline <math>\varphi(r) = r^2 \log r</math>. It has a more global nature than the Gaussian kernel <math>\varphi(r) = \exp(-r^2/\sigma^2)</math>, which is another common function -- a small perturbation of one of the control points always affects the coefficients corresponding to all the other points as well. ==Thin plate spline== ===Smoothness measure=== One of the simplest smoothness measures is the space integral of the square of the second order derivatives of the mapping function. This leads us to the thin plate spline (TPS). The TPS fits a mapping function <math>f(x)</math> between corresponding point-sets <math>\{y_i\}</math> and <math>\{x_i\}</math> by minimizing the following energy function: :<math> E = \iint\left[\left(\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}\right)^2 + 2\left(\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial xy}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2}\right)^2 \right] \textrm{d} x \, \textrm{d}y </math> And for a smoothing TPS, it is :<math> E_{tps} = \sum_{i=1}^K \|y_i - f(x_i) \|^2 + \lambda \iint\left[\left(\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}\right)^2 + 2\left(\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2}\right)^2 \right] \textrm{d} x \, \textrm{d}y </math> Then smoothing TPS is defined as :<math> f_{tps} = \arg\min_f E_{tps} </math> For this variational problem, it can be shown that there exists a unique minimizer <math>f</math> (Wahba,1990) <!--(''can someone explain this in detail? Thanks!'')--> with a fixed weight parameter <math>\lambda</math> which is presented in next section. ===Spline=== Suppose the points are in 2D (D = 2). We use ''homogeneous coordinates'' for the point-set where a point <math>y_{i}</math> represented as a vector <math>(1, y_{ix}, y_{iy})</math>. The unique minimizer <math>f</math> is parameterized by <math>\alpha</math> which comprises two matrices <math>d</math> and <math>c</math> (<math>\alpha = \{d,c\}</math>). :<math> f_{tps}(z, \alpha) = f_{tps}(z, d, c) = z\cdot d + \sum_{i = 1}^K \phi(\| z - x_i\|)\cdot c_i </math> where d is a <math>(D+1)\times(D+1)</math> matrix representing the affine transformation and c is a <math>K\times(D+1)</math> warping coefficient matrix representing the non-affine deformation. The kernel function <math>\phi(z)</math> is a <math>1\times K</math> vector for each point <math>z</math>, where each entry <math>\phi_i(z) = \|z - x_i\|^2 \log \|z - x_i\|</math> for 2 dimensions. For the 3 dimension case, <math>\phi_i(z) = \|z - x_i\|^3 </math>. Note that for TPS, the control points <math>\{w_i\}</math> are chosen to be the same as the set of points to be warped <math>\{x_i\}</math>,
