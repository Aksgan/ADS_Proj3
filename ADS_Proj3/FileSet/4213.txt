knowing the population parameters, not the statistics of a sample drawn from the population of interest. But knowing the true standard deviation of a population is often unrealistic except in cases such as [[standardized testing]], where the entire population is measured. In cases where it is impossible to measure every member of a population, the standard deviation may be estimated using a random sample. For example, a population of people who smoke [[cigarette]]s is not fully measured. When a population is [[normal distribution|normally distributed]], the [[percentile rank]] may be determined from the standard score and statistical tables. == Applications == The z-score is most often used in the [[z-test]] in [[standardized testing]] – the analog of the [[Student's t-test]] for a population whose parameters are known, rather than estimated. As it is very unusual to know the entire population, the t-test is much more widely used. Darby and Reissland (1981) make use of z-scores as a way of understanding the contributions from various subsets of data to an overall test of trend. The overall analysis was of trends in the rate of occurrence of cancer and the subsets considered approximately 55 different types of cancer, together with various groupings of these types. In this instance, the use of z-scores is not immediately as a test statistic for a significance test, but rather as a numerical guide to finding subsets of data which might show different trends than others. ==Standardizing in mathematical statistics== {{further|[[Normalization (statistics)]]}} In [[mathematical statistics]], a [[random variable]] ''X'' is '''standardized''' using the theoretical (population) mean and standard deviation: :<math>Z = {X - \mu \over \sigma}</math> where <math>\mu = \operatorname{E}[X]</math> is the [[mean]] and <math>\sigma = \sqrt{\operatorname{Var}(X)}</math> the [[standard deviation]] of the [[probability distribution]] of ''X''. If the random variable under consideration is the [[sample mean]]: :<math>\bar{X}={1 \over n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i</math> then the standardized version is :<math>Z = \frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}.</math> See [[normalization (statistics)]] for other forms of normalization. A common name for standard score is the z-score. It is often used in statistics. ==See also== {{Spoken Wikipedia|Standard score.ogg|2006-07-09}} {{colbegin}} * [[Central moment]] * [[Moment (mathematics)]] * [[Normalization (statistics)]] * [[Sampling distribution]] * [[Standard normal deviate]] * [[Standard normal table]] * [[Student's t-test]] * [[Student's t-statistic]] * [[Studentized residual]] * [[Z-factor]] * [[Z-test]] * [[Sten scores]] {{colend}} ==References and notes== * {{citation|last=Carroll|first=Susan Rovezzi|last2=Carroll|first2=David J. |title=Statistics Made Simple for School Leaders |url=http://books.google.com/?id=gccHkMDikb0C |accessdate=7 June 2009 |edition=illustrated |year=2002|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=9780810843226}} ===General references=== * Richard J.

[[Image:Stdstreams-notitle.svg|thumb|right|The standard streams for input, output, and error]] In [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] operating systems (and, to some extent, Windows), as well as certain [[programming language]] interfaces, the '''standard streams''' are preconnected input and output channels between a computer program and its environment (typically a [[text terminal]]) when it begins execution. The three [[input/output|I/O]] connections are called '''standard input''' ('''stdin'''), '''standard output''' ('''stdout''') and '''standard error''' ('''stderr'''). ==Background== In most operating systems predating Unix, programs had to explicitly connect to the appropriate input and output data. On many of those systems, this could be an intimidating programming challenge created by OS-specific intricacies such as obtaining control environment settings, accessing a local file table, determining the intended data set, and handling the correct case of a card reader, magnetic tape drive, disk drive, line printer, card punch, or interactive terminal. Unix provided several groundbreaking advances, one of which was to provide ''abstract devices'': it removed the need for a program to know or care what kind of devices it was communicating with. Older operating systems forced upon the programmer a record structure and, frequently [[orthogonal#Computer science|non-orthogonal]] data semantics and device control. Unix eliminated this complexity with the concept of a data stream: an ordered sequence of data bytes which can be read until the [[End-of-file|end of file]]. A program may also write bytes as desired and need not (and can't easily) declare how many there will be, or how they will be grouped. Another Unix breakthrough was to automatically associate input and output by default—the program (and programmer) did absolutely nothing to establish input and output for a typical input-process-output program (unless it chose a different paradigm). In contrast, previous operating systems usually required some—often complex—[[Job Control Language|job control language]] to establish connections, or the equivalent burden had to be orchestrated by the program. Since Unix provided standard streams, the Unix C runtime environment was obligated to support it as well. As a result, most C runtime environments (and C's descendants), regardless of the operating system, provide equivalent functionality. ==Standard input (stdin)==<!-- This section is linked from [[COMMAND.COM]] --> Standard input is data (often text) going into a program. The program requests data transfers by use of the ''read'' operation. Not all programs require input. For example, the ''dir'' or ''ls'' program (which displays file names contained in a directory) performs its operation without any stream data input. Unless [[Redirection (computing)|redirected]], input is expected from the [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] which started the program. The [[file descriptor]] for standard input is 0 (zero); the [[POSIX]] ''<unistd.h>'' definition is <tt>STDIN_FILENO</tt>; the corresponding ''<stdio.h>'' variable is <tt>FILE* stdin</tt>; similarly, the ''<iostream>'' variable is <tt>std::cin</tt>. ==Standard output (stdout)==<!-- This section is linked from [[COMMAND.COM]] --> Standard output is the stream where a program writes its output data. The program requests data transfer with the ''write'' operation. Not all programs generate output. For example the ''file rename'' command (variously called ''mv'', ''move'', ''ren'') is silent on success. Unless [[Redirection (Unix)|redirected]], standard output is the [[text terminal]] which initiated the program.
