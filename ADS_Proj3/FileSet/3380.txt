yielding an estimated variance that is larger than predicted by the binomial model. In this case, the [[beta-binomial model]] is an popular and analytically tractible alternative to the binomial that captures the overdispersion absent from the binomial model thereby providing a better fit to the observed data. To capture the heterogeneity of the families, one can think of the p parameter (proportion of boys) in the binomial model as itself a random variable (i.e. [[random effects model]]) drawn for each family from a [[beta distribution]] as the mixing distribution. The resulting compound distribution (Beta-Binomial) has an additional free parameter. Another common model for overdispersion - when some of the observations are not [[Bernoulli distribution|Bernoulli]] - arises from introducing a [[normal distribution|normal random variable]] into a [[logistic regression|logistic model]]. Software is widely available for fitting this type of [[multilevel model]]. In this case, if the variance of the normal variable is zero, the model reduces to the classical (undispersed) [[logistic regression]]. Note that this model has an additional free parameter - namely the variance of the normal variable. It should be noted with respect to Binomial random variables that the concept of overdispersion only makes sense if n>1 (i.e. overdispersion is nonsensical for Bernoulli random variables). ==Differences in terminology between disciplines== Over- and underdispersion are terms which have been adopted in branches of the [[biological science]]s. In [[parasitology]], the term 'overdispersion' is generally used as defined here &mdash; meaning a distribution with a higher than expected variance. In some areas of [[ecology]], however, meanings have been transposed, so that overdispersion is actually taken to mean more even (lower variance) than expected. This confusion has caused some ecologists to suggest that the terms 'aggregated', or 'contagious', would be better used in ecology for 'overdispersed' <ref>Greig-Smith, P. 1983 [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f2fghtp8lA0C&dq=Quantitative+Plant+Ecology&source=gbs_navlinks_s| Quantitative Plant Ecology] ''University of California Press''</ref>. Such preferences are creeping into [[parasitology]] too<ref>Poulin, R. (2006) [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8336.html Evolutionary Ecology of Parasites] ''Princeton University Press''</ref>. Generally this suggestion has not been heeded, and confusion persists in the literature. Furthermore in [[demography]] overdispersion is often evident in the analysis of death count data, but demographers prefer the term 'unobserved [[heterogeneity]]'. ==References== {{reflist}} ==See also== *[[Index of dispersion]] ==External links== * [http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/Overdispersion.html "Overdispersion"] at [[Planet Math]] [[Category:Data analysis]] [[Category:Point processes]] [[Category:Spatial data analysis]]</text> </page> <page> <id>27920</id> <title>Overlap coefficient</title> <text>The '''overlap coefficient''' is a similarity measure related to the [[Jaccard index]] that computes the overlap between two sets which is defined as follows: :<math>\mathrm{overlap}(X,Y) = \frac{| X \cap Y | }{\min(|X|,|Y|)}</math> If set ''X'' is a subset of ''Y'' or the converse then the overlap coefficient is equal to one. ==References== * [http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~sam/stringmetrics.html Similarity Metrics], University of Sheffield, Department of Computer Science [[Category:Information retrieval]] [[Category:String similarity measures]] [[Category:Measure theory]]</text> </page> <page> <id>27943</id> <title>Oxford Text Archive</title> <text>'''Oxford Text Archive''' ('''OTA''') is an archive of electronic texts and other literary and language resources which have been created, collected and distributed for the purpose of research into literary and linguistic topics. The OTA was founded by Lou Burnard of [[Oxford University Computing Services]] in 1976, and is thought to be the oldest archive of academic textual resources in electronic form. The OTA is part of the Research Technologies Service of OUCS. From 1996 to 2008, the OTA was one of the centres of the [[Arts and Humanities Data Service]], and hosted [[AHDS Literature, Languages and Linguistics]], a national centre for the support of digital research in literary and linguistic subject areas in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. [[AHDS Literature, Languages and Linguistics]] was funded to provide free advice to those from [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[Higher Education]] in the best practice in digital resource creation. The OTA continues to accept deposits of primary-source academic electronic editions and linguistic corpora, and is one of the key centres in the emerging European research infrastructure (CLARIN, the Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure). ==External links== * [http://www.ota.ox.ac.uk/ Oxford Text Archive] * [http://www.ahds.ac.uk/ Arts and Humanities Data Service] * [http://www.clarin.eu/ CLARIN] [[Category:Organizations established in 1976]] [[Category:Organisations associated with the University of Oxford|Text Archive]] [[Category:Culture of the University of Oxford|Text Archive]] [[Category:Archives in England]] [[Category:Literature websites]] [[Category:Discipline-oriented digital libraries]] [[Category:Text Encoding Initiative]] [[Category:Digital Humanities]] [[Category:Digital Humanities Centers]]</text> </page> <page> <id>27950</id> <title>Ozoneweb</title> <text>{{Infobox Website | name = Ozoneweb | screenshot = [[Image:Ozone (2).jpg]] | caption = Ozoneweb interpolated map May 2007 | type = International Government | url = [http://www.eea.europa.eu/maps/ozone/map www.eea.europa.eu/maps/ozone/welcome] | owner = [[European Environment Agency]] | author = EEA, [[WS Atkins PLC|Atkins Danmark]] | launch date = July 2006 | current status = Active }} '''Ozoneweb''' is an [[European Environment Agency|EEA ]] website on near real-time [[ozone]]. The website allows the general public to track [[air quality]] in a specific region and on a European level. The website displays [[ozone]] levels via a map of Europe. Background information on [[ozone]] and its health impacts are also provided. Users can monitor ozone levels in a neighbouring country or a holiday destination, check recent trends and track the spread of ozone across Europe. The website now includes a module to display exceedances in countries. == Features of the site == Key features of the site are: * Live status data on ozone * Most measurement stations in Europe (over 700) * Advanced Internet mapping tool * Interpolated maps * Comparisons views * Support factual text == About the data == Data from more than 700 [[air quality]] measurement stations across Europe are transmitted to the EEA in Copenhagen on an hourly basis. Since the data must be as 'real-time' as possible, the data are displayed as soon as practical after the end of each hour. In the map, the [[ozone]] level is illustrated by colours. The colour scheme is linked to threshold values in [[EU]] legislation. To provide an estimate of the [[ozone]] status in areas between measurement stations, a statistical calculation ([[interpolation]]) is carried out on the [[ozone]] data received by the EEA. Before the result of the calculation is shown on the map, a number of conditions have to be satisfied by the input data and the resulting calculation.
