other Autobots gets interrupted for a [[news]] report). == Marvel Comics == ''Note: Stories from the U.K. Marvel Transformers series are in italics.'' In [[Marvel Comics]]' comic series, before the Great War broke out on Cybertron, the robot who would be Optimus Prime (before he received the [[Matrix of Leadership]] from [[Sentinel Prime]]) was a Transformer of note, displaying his skills in the Infraformers Sharpshooting Competition. Subsequently, when the war began, Prime quickly made a name for himself as a combat leader of the Autobots. On a mission with the [[Triggerbots]] to stop Megatron from claiming the [[Underbase]], Prime was forced to jettison the massive databank into space to prevent anyone from acquiring its power, and with this action, he proved his wisdom and skill to the Autobot Council of Elders. This led to even more rapid advancement, eventually leading him to field command over the Autobot armies. Four million years ago, Cybertron — shaken from its orbit and drifting through space — came under threat when it floated into the path of an asteroid swarm. Prime led a group of elite Autobot warriors on the Autobot starship, the Ark, on a mission to destroy the asteroids, and although successful, in the aftermath of this mission the Ark was attacked by Decepticons, hoping to overcome their weakened foes. Intent on keeping the secrets of the Ark from the Decepticons, Prime set the craft on a suicide course, crashing it into the prehistoric planet Earth. In 1984 A.D., a [[volcanic eruption]] re-activated the Ark, which in turn brought the Transformers back on-line. Prime led the Autobots in their opening battles to prevent the Decepticons from plundering Earth's resources, but following their initial victory, the Transformers were all deactivated by [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]]. Prime was decapitated by Shockwave, and had the energy of the Creation Matrix leeched from his mind to give life to Shockwave's creations, the [[Constructicons]] (although Shockwave was unaware that the Matrix was not merely a program in Prime's mind, but a physical object in his chest). Before Shockwave could give life to his next Decepticon, [[Jetfire]], Prime transferred the Matrix energy into the mind of [[Witwicky family#Buster Witwicky|Buster Witwicky]], who used the energy to turn Jetfire on Shockwave, allowing Prime to reclaim his body and retake leadership of the Autobots, giving Jetfire true life as a reward. Around this time, he would even meet [[Ronald Reagan in fiction|Ronald Reagan]] in a story in the 1985 U.K. annual. Meanwhile, however, the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] offices of Marvel Comics were producing their own storylines. Here, writer [[Simon Furman]] offered a different take on Prime, one that was weary of the war he had been forced to fight. In the "Prey" storyline beginning in U.K. #96 Prime arranged for a [[Wheeljack]] built copy of himself to be destroyed to see how the Autobots could cope without him. Unfortunately the plan was derailed by Megatron and the [[Predacons]], who attacked him. During the battle Prime, Megatron and [[Ultra Magnus]] were transported to Earth — with Prime accidentally interrupting his own funeral service. This theme of war-weariness would again come to the fore in the U.K. strips detailing Prime's U.S. death. After a period of effective leadership which saw the activation of several new Transformers including the [[Aerialbots]], who Prime infused with life using the Matrix, Prime engaged Megatron in a [[video game]] duel for possession of a super fuel. Prime was victorious, but Megatron implemented a cheat code that killed Prime later. Autobot surgeon [[Ratchet (Transformers)|Ratchet]]'s subsequent efforts to restore him were unsuccessful, and his body was launched into space, the Autobots unaware of the presence of the physical Matrix object within the corpse. The funeral barge eventually crashed on a giant moon; as it lay there for an untold time, the Matrix reached out to nearby living organisms, studying and recreating them. One such recreated being became known as [[Deathbringer]]. Prime's personality had been copied onto a [[floppy disk]] by the technician running the game, [[Ethan Zachary]], who employed him in various video game scenarios he developed. Prime's damaged mind led him to believe that he himself was a video game character, and in an attempt to bring him back to life, [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Goldbug]], [[Joyride (Transformers)|Joyride]], [[Slapdash (Transformers)|Slapdash]] and [[Getaway (Transformers)|Getaway]] took the disk to the planet [[Nebulos]]. They built a new body for Optimus Prime, and even upgraded it with the ability to combine with the trailer to form a larger robot. In an effort to keep Transformers off their planet, however, the Nebulans had poisoned their fuel, and the sensation of dying convinced Prime that he was truly alive, and not a game character. To save his life, the Nebulan scientist Hi-Q [[binary-bonding|bonded]] with him, creating '''[[Powermasters|Powermaster]] Optimus Prime'''. A UK story set around this time in UK #198 would see Prime as the star of his own [[Christmas]] special, as he returned to Earth and tried to rekindle his feeling for the planet. After a battle between his own forces and an advance force from Cybertron ruined a small town's Christmas festivities he realized bringing the Transformers to Earth was far worse than anything his troops could have done and vowed to protect its inhabitants from Decepticon aggression.<ref>{{Cite book | title=Transformers: The Ultimate Guide | last=Furman | first=Simon | year=2004 | publisher=DK Publishing Inc.| ISBN=1405304618 | pages= 58–59}}</ref> Optimus Prime's first actions as leader were to ally the Autobots with [[Scorponok]]'s Decepticons in defeating [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]] when the latter gained the power of the [[Underbase]]. ''In the U.K. ''Transformers'' stories, Prime and his Autobots later battled a murderous mechanoid named Deathbringer, which Prime recognized as a creation of the Matrix.'' Later, the Transformers were all transported to Cybertron by [[Primus (Transformers)|Primus]] to battle Unicron, Prime managed to successfully reacquire and purify the Matrix after [[Unicron]] killed [[Thunderwing]] and his taint upon it.
