patient data are meeting records retention requirements.<ref>[http://www.hipaadvisory.com/regs/recordretention.htm HIPAA Advisory]. Retrieved on 10 March 2007 </ref> Disaster, data complexity, data value and increasing dependence upon ever-growing volumes of data all contribute to the anxiety around and dependence upon successful backups to ensure [[business continuity]]. For that reason, many organizations rely on third-party or "independent" solutions to test, validate, and optimize their backup operations (backup reporting). ; Reporting : In larger configurations, reports are useful for monitoring media usage, device status, errors, vault coordination and other information about the backup process. ; Logging : In addition to the history of computer generated reports, activity and change logs are useful for monitoring backup system events. ; Validation : Many backup programs make use of [[checksum]]s or [[hash function|hash]]es to validate that the data was accurately copied. These offer several advantages. First, they allow data integrity to be verified without reference to the original file: if the file as stored on the backup medium has the same checksum as the saved value, then it is very probably correct. Second, some backup programs can use checksums to avoid making redundant copies of files, to improve backup speed. This is particularly useful for the de-duplication process. ; Monitored backup : Backup processes are monitored by a third party monitoring center. This center alerts users to any errors that occur during automated backups. Monitored backup requires software capable of pinging the monitoring center's servers in the case of errors. Some monitoring services also allow collection of historical meta-data, that can be used for Storage Resource Management purposes like projection of data growth, locating redundant primary storage capacity and reclaimable backup capacity. The Wizards Storage Portal is an example of a solution that monitors IBM's well known Tivoli Storage Manager(TSM) solution. == Lore == {{Wikiquote}} === Confusion === Due to a considerable overlap in technology, backups and backup systems are frequently confused with [[archive]]s and [[fault-tolerant system]]s. Backups differ from archives in the sense that archives are the ''primary copy'' of data, usually put away for future use, while backups are a ''secondary copy'' of data, kept on hand to replace the original item. Backup systems differ from fault-tolerant systems in the sense that backup systems assume that a fault ''will'' cause a data loss event and fault-tolerant systems assure a fault ''will not''. === Advice === {{Original research|date=November 2009}} * The more important the data that is stored on the computer, the greater is the need for backing up this data. * A backup is only as useful as its associated restore strategy. For critical systems and data, the restoration process must be tested. * Storing the copy near the original is unwise, since many disasters such as fire, flood, theft, and electrical surges are likely to cause damage to the backup at the same time. In these cases, both the original and the backup medium are likely to be lost. * Automated backup and scheduling should be considered, as manual backups can be affected by human error. * Backups can fail for a wide variety of reasons. A verification or monitoring strategy is an important part of a successful backup plan. * Multiple backups on different media, stored in different locations, should be used for all critical information. * Backed up archives should be stored in open and standard formats, especially when the goal is long-term archiving. Recovery software and processes may have changed, and software may not be available to restore data saved in proprietary formats. * System administrators and others working in the information technology field are routinely fired for not devising and maintaining backup processes suitable to their organization. * If you already have a tape backup system, a second backup program may be necessary. Perform an additional backup to an external hard disk with an automatic backup program so you will have doubled the data security, and it is easy to check the backed-up files in the external hard disk. === Events === * In 1996, during a fire at the headquarters of [[Crédit Lyonnais]], a major bank in Paris, system administrators ran into the burning building to rescue backup tapes because they didn't have off-site copies. Crucial bank archives and computer data were lost.<ref>[http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/risks/18.14.html#subj3 Credit Lyonnais fire, 1996]</ref><ref>[http://www.erisk.com/Learning/CaseStudies/CreditLyonnais.asp "...destruction of crucial bank archives..."]</ref> * [[Privacy Rights Clearinghouse]] has documented <ref name=privacy>[http://www.privacyrights.org/ar/ChronDataBreaches.htm A Chronology of Data Breaches] [[Privacy Rights Clearinghouse]], [[San Diego]]</ref> 16 instances of stolen or lost backup tapes (among major organizations) in 2005 & 2006. Affected organizations included [[Bank of America]], [[Ameritrade]], [[Citigroup]], and [[Time Warner]]. * On 3 January 2008, an email server crashed at [[TeliaSonera]], a major Nordic telecom company and [[internet service provider]]. It was subsequently discovered that the last serviceable backup set was from 15 December 2007. Three hundred thousand customer email accounts were affected.<ref> back up is the activibg of copying file or date bases. {{cite journal | title = Telia server outage causes massive loss of email messages | journal = blog.anta.net | date = 7 January 2008 | url = http://blog.anta.net/2008/01/07/telia-server-outage-causes-massive-loss-of-email-messages/ | issn = 1797-1993 | accessdate = 31 May 2008 }} </ref><ref> {{cite journal | title = Telia Sonera to compensate clients over email crash | date = 7 January 2008 | url = http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/business/news/article_1385007.php/Telia_Sonera_to_compensate_clients_over_email_crash | accessdate = 19 February 2009 }} </ref> == See also == {{Wiktionary|backup}} {{Wiktionary|back up}} * [[Glossary of backup terms]] * [[Backup software]] ** [[List of backup software]] * [[Backup rotation scheme]] * [[Data proliferation]] * [[File synchronization]] * [[Information repository]] * [[Disaster recovery and business continuity auditing]] * [[Digital preservation]] * [[Data Recovery]] * [[Virtual backup appliance]] == References == {{Reflist|2}} {{Use dmy dates|date=November 2010}} [[Category:Data security]] [[Category:Business continuity and disaster recovery]] [[Category:Tape-based computer storage]] [[Category:Computer backup|*]] [[af:Rugsteun]] [[bs:Backup]] [[ca:Còpia de seguretat]] [[cs:Záloha (informatika)]] [[da:Sikkerhedskopi]] [[de:Datensicherung]] [[es:Copia de seguridad]] [[eo:Sekurkopio]] [[eu:Segurtasun kopia]] [[fa:فرآیند پشتیبانی]] [[fr:Sauvegarde]] [[ko:백업]] [[hy:Պահուստավորում]] [[hi:बैकअप]] [[hr:Sigurnosna kopija]] [[it:Backup]] [[he:גיבוי]] [[kn:ಬ್ಯಾಕ್‌ಅಪ್‌]] [[lb:Backup]] [[hu:Adatmentés]] [[nl:Back-up]] [[ja:バックアップ]] [[no:Sikkerhetskopi]] [[pl:Kopia bezpieczeństwa]] [[pt:Cópia de segurança]] [[ru:Резервное копирование]] [[sq:Back-up]] [[simple:Backup]] [[sk:Zálohovanie dát]] [[fi:Varmuuskopiointi]] [[sv:Säkerhetskopiering]] [[tl:Backup]] [[uk:Резервне копіювання]] [[ur:Backup]] [[zh-yue:備份]]
