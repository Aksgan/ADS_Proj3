bullet point could contain as many lines of text as desired. A bullet point could be dragged and placed underneath another bullet point, thus forming a hierarchical [[outline]]/[[Tree structure|tree]]. When a bullet point was dragged, the entire sub-[[Tree structure|tree]] of child bullet points underneath it (if any) would be dragged along as well. If a bullet point had child bullet points, tapping the hollow parent bullet point once would "roll up" or collapse all the children ([[WindowShade|"windowshade" effect]]). The parent bullet point would become a solid black circle and all the children would disappear. Tapping the parent bullet point again would make the children re-appear. Because this functionality arrived in Newton OS 2.0, several third parties made similar software before for OS 1.x Newton machines, the most notable of which was Dyno Notepad, released in 1993. ====Names==== The Names application was used for storing contacts. Contacts created either on the Newton device or on a Windows or Macintosh desktop [[Personal information manager|PIM]] could be synchronized to each other.<ref>Apple Computer. [http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=38006 "Newton Connection Utilities ReadMe"], Apple, July 24, 1997</ref><ref>Apple Computer. [http://www.oldschool.net/newton/papers/ncu.html#NCU "Newton Connection Utilities Features"], Newton Source</ref> Entering a date in Names for fields such as birthday or anniversary automatically created corresponding repeating events in the Dates application. Each contact had an attached free-form notes field available to it, that could contain any mix of interleaved text, ink text, Shapes, or Sketches. Like Notes, Names could be extended by developers, to create special new categories of contacts with specialized pre-defined fields. Names shipped with 3 types of contacts, "people", "companies", and "groups", but a developer could define new types, for instance "client", "patient", etc. [http://standalone.com/|Stand Alone Software, Inc.] also created a Newton software package called the Stationery Construction Kit, which allowed users to make stationery themselves without aid of any other tools. ====Dates==== Dates supplied calendar, events, meeting, and alarms functions, including an integrated [[Time management|"to do" list]] manager. It offered many different display and navigation styles, including a list view, graphical day "time blocking" view, or a week, month, or year grid. As with Names and Notes, Dates items created either on the Newton or on a Windows or Macintosh desktop [[Personal information manager|PIM]] could be synchronized to each other. === Operating system and programming environment === The [[Newton OS]] consists of three layers. At the lowest level, a [[microkernel]] handles resources like [[Task (computers)|tasks]] and memory. On top of the microkernel, the bulk of the operating system is implemented in [[C++]], including the communications layer, handwriting recognition, and the [[NewtonScript]] environment. The top layer consists of built-in and user installed applications written in NewtonScript. NewtonScript is an advanced [[object-oriented programming]] language, developed by Apple employee [[Walter Smith (programmer)|Walter Smith]].<ref>[http://waltersmith.us/ Walter Smithâ€™s home page]</ref> Some programmers complained at the $1000 cost of the Toolbox programming environment. Additionally, it required learning a new way of programming. The Newton Toolkit (NTK), an integrated environment tailored to the graphical nature of the Newton platform, was developed specifically for developing applications for the Newton platform and included a graphical view editor, a template browser, and an interactive inspector window for debugging. Initially, it was only available for [[Macintosh]] computers, and later a [[Microsoft Windows]] version was developed. The Technical Lead for the Newton Toolkit was Norberto Menendez; other engineers on the team were Ben Sharpe and Peter Potrebic. === Data storage === Data in Newton is stored in object-oriented databases known as [[Soup (Apple Newton)|soups]]. One of the innovative aspects of Newton is that soups are available to all programs; and programs can operate cross-soup; meaning that the calendar can refer to names in the address book; a note in the notepad can be converted to an appointment, and so forth; and the soups can be programmer-extended&mdash;a new address book enhancement can be built on the data from the existing address book. The soup system also made it easy to synchronize data, and the Newton Connection tools could be used for importing and exporting data. Among many file formats are the [[Rich Text Format]], Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Works, and many more. Another consequence of the data-object soup is that objects can extend built-in applications such as the address book so seamlessly that Newton users can sometimes not distinguish which program or add-on object is responsible for the various features on their own system, because the advanced nature of Newton devices makes it easy to accept such add-ons. A user rebuilding their system after extended usage might find themselves unable to manually restore their system to the same functionality because some long-forgotten downloaded extension was missing. Data owned and used by applications and extensions themselves is tossed in the "Storage" area of the "Extras" drawer in 2.x Newton devices; on 1.x systems, they can only be found or removed in the Memory section of the built-in Prefs application, in the Card slip (also built-in), or with third-party tools such as NewtCase. There is no built-in distinction between types of data in that area. For example, an installed application's icon could be sitting right next to a database of addresses used by another installed extension further down the list. Finally, the data soup concept works well for data like addresses, which benefit from being shared cross-functionally, but it works poorly for discrete data sets like files and documents. Later, the 2.0 release of the [[Newton OS]] introduced Virtual Binary Objects to alleviate the problem of handling large data objects. ===Package installation, capacity planning, and disaster recovery=== Several software utilities which accommodate data transfer to and from a host system exist for the following platforms: * Mac OS * Mac OS X * UNIX * Linux * Microsoft Windows == Newton technology after cancellation == Before the Newton project was canceled, it was "spun off" into an Apple wholly owned subsidiary company, ''Newton Inc.'', but was reabsorbed several months later when Apple CEO [[Gil Amelio]] was fired by the board and [[Steve Jobs]] took over as then interim CEO. Two ex-Apple Newton developers founded [[Pixo]],
