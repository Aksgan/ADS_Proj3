health monitoring, event detection in sensor networks, and detecting eco-system disturbances. It is often used in preprocessing to remove anomalous data from the dataset. == Popular Anomaly Detection Techniques== Several anomaly detection techniques have been proposed in literature. Some of the popular techniques are: * Distance based techniques ([[K-nearest neighbor algorithm|k-nearest neighbor]], [[Local Outlier Factor]]). * One Class [[Support Vector Machines]]. * Replicator [[Neural network|Neural Networks]]. * [[Cluster analysis]] based outlier detection. == Application to Data Security== Anomaly detection was proposed for [[Intrusion detection systems]] (IDS) by Dorothy Denning in 1986.<ref>Denning, Dorothy, "An Intrusion Detection Model," Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, May 1986, pages 119-131.</ref> Anomaly detection for IDS is normally accomplished with thresholds and statistics, but can also be done with [[Soft computing]], and inductive learning<ref>Teng, Henry S., Chen, Kaihu, and Lu, Stephen C-Y, "[http://www.cs.unc.edu/~jeffay/courses/nidsS05/ai/Teng-AdaptiveRTAnomaly-SnP90.pdf Adaptive Real-time Anomaly Detection Using Inductively Generated Sequential Patterns]," 1990 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy</ref>. Types of statistics proposed by 1999 included profiles of users, workstations, networks, remote hosts, groups of users, and programs based on frequencies, means, variances, covariances, and standard deviations.<ref>Jones, Anita K., and Sielken, Robert S., "Computer System Intrusion Detection: A Survey," Technical Report, Department of Computer Science, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, 1999</ref> The counterpart of Anomaly detection in [[Intrusion detection]] is [[Misuse Detection]]. ==See also== *[[Change detection]] == References == <references/> {{DEFAULTSORT:Anomaly Detection}} [[Category:Data mining]] [[Category:Data security]] [[Category:Statistical outliers]]</text> </page> <page> <id>1954</id> <title>Anonymizer (company)</title> <text>{{Cleanup-spam|date=January 2011}} {{About|an internet privacy company|anonymous web proxy|anonymizer}} '''Anonymizer, Inc.''' is an [[Internet privacy]] [[company]], founded in 1995 by [[Lance Cottrell]], author of the [[Mixmaster anonymous remailer]]. Anonymizer was originally named Infonex Internet. The name was changed to '''Anonymizer''' in 1997 when the company acquired a web based privacy proxy of the same name developed by [[Justin Boyan]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] School of Computer Science. Boyan licensed the software to [[C2Net]] for public beta testing before selling it to [[Infonex]]. Anonymizer offers a variety of consumer information security services including: *[[VPN]] for multi-protocol proxy *client software for [[iPhone]] and [[iPad]] *[[anonymizer]] [[Proxy server]] *[[encrypted]] [[E-mail]] services *[[anti-spyware]] *anti-[[phishing]] / anti-[[pharming]] *enterprise class competitive intelligence tools Their "Operation: Anti-Censorship" software, introduced in 2006, addresses [[internet censorship in the People's Republic of China]] by allowing Chinese Internet users to access blocked sites.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,125303-page,1/article.html |title=PC World - Anonymizer Takes on China's Net Censors |accessdate=2007-08-03 |work=}}</ref> The company privacy policy regarding disclosure of customer information states that they will not tolerate the use of their service for protecting the anonymity of hackers.

Anonymity of participants is usually achieved by special routing [[overlay network]]s that hide the physical location of each node from other participants. Interest in anonymous P2P systems has increased in recent years for many reasons, ranging from the desire to share [[copyright]]ed files without revealing one's network identity and risking litigation<ref name="eff">Electronic Frontier Foundation (2005). [http://www.eff.org/IP/P2P/RIAAatTWO_FINAL.pdf RIAA v. The People: Two Years Later]. Retrieved March 5, 2008.</ref> to distrust in governments, concerns over mass [[surveillance]] and [[data retention]], and lawsuits against [[blog]]gers.<ref name="rsf">Julien Pain, editor (2005). [http://www.rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=542 Reporters Without Borders handbook for bloggers and cyber-dissidents]. Retrieved January 23, 2008.</ref> ==Motivation for anonymity== There are many reasons to use anonymous P2P technology; most of them are generic to all forms of online anonymity. P2P users who desire anonymity usually do so as they do not wish to be identified as a publisher (sender), or reader (receiver), of information. Common reasons include: * The material or its distribution is illegal or incriminating * Material is legal but socially deplored, embarrassing or problematic in the individual's social world (for example, anonymity is seen as a key requirement for organizations like [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]) * Fear of retribution (against whistleblowers, unofficial leaks, and activists who do not believe in restrictions on information or knowledge) * Censorship at the local, organizational, or national level * Personal privacy preferences such as preventing [[Web visitor tracking|tracking]] or [[datamining]] activities A particularly open view on legal and illegal content is given in [http://freenetproject.org/philosophy.html The Philosophy Behind Freenet]. Governments are also interested in anonymous P2P technology. The [[United States]] [[Navy]] funded the original [[onion routing]] research that led to the development of the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] network, which was later funded by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] and is now developed by the non-profit organization The Tor Project, Inc. ==Arguments for and against anonymous P2P communication== ===General=== While anonymous P2P systems may support the protection of unpopular speech, they may also protect illegal activities not protected under some free speech laws, such as [[fraud]], [[slander and libel|libel]], the exchange of illegal [[pornography]], the unauthorized copying of copyrighted works, or the planning of criminal activities. Critics{{Who|date=October 2009}} of anonymous P2P systems hold that the advantages offered by such systems do not outweigh these disadvantages, and that other communication channels are already sufficient for unpopular speech. Some{{Who|date=October 2009}} proponents of anonymous P2P systems believe that all restrictions on free speech serve
