the user's permission, the technician can take control of the user's mouse and keyboard, transfer various diagnostic and repair applications to the user's desktop, run scans, install antivirus programs, etc. If the remote service permits it, the technician can even reboot the PC and reconnect remotely to continue his work without the user needing to assist. Common repairs available with online computer support providers are [[computer virus]] and [[spyware]] removal, computer optimization, [[registry]] repair, [[device driver]] issues, [[World Wide Web|Web]] related issues, and Windows security updates. Generally, only software can be "repaired" remotely. A computer with a broken hardware component such as a [[motherboard]] or [[hard disk]] can in some cases be diagnosed, but must be repaired in person. == References == {{reflist}} [[Category:Help desk]] [[Category:Outsourcing]] [[Category:Customer experience management]] [[Category:Remote desktop]] [[Category:Collaboration]] [[Category:Groupware]] [[ar:دعم فني]] [[de:Support (Dienstleistung)]] [[es:Soporte técnico]] [[fr:Services d'assistance]] [[ms:Sokongan teknikal]] [[pl:Wsparcie techniczne]] [[pt:Suporte técnico]] [[ru:Служба технической поддержки]] [[fi:Mikrotuki]]</text> </page> <page> <id>36929</id> <title>Technical terminology</title> <text>{{Merge from|Scientific terminology|date=May 2009}} '''Technical terminology''' is the specialized [[vocabulary]] of any field, not just technical fields. The same is true of the synonyms '''''technical terms''''', '''''terms of art''''', '''''shop talk''''' and '''''words of art''''', which do not necessarily refer to [[technology]] or [[art]].<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/term+of+art?r=66 Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law]</ref><ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/term+of+art McGraw-Hill Concise Dictionary of Modern Medicine]</ref><ref>[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Term+of+art West's Encyclopedia of American Law]</ref> Within one or more fields, these terms have one or more specific meanings that are not necessarily the same as those in common use. [[Jargon]] is similar, but more informal in definition and use. Legal technical terms, often called ''(legal) terms of art'' or ''(legal) words of art'', have meanings that are strictly defined by law. An '''industry term''' is a type of technical terminology that has a particular meaning within a specific industry. The phrase '''industry term''' implies that a word or phrase is a typical one within a particular industry or business and people within the industry or business will be familiar with and use the term. Technical terminology exists in a continuum of formality. Precise technical terms and their definitions are formally recognised, documented, and taught by educators in the field. Other terms are more colloquial, coined and used by practitioners in the field, and are similar to [[slang]]. The boundaries between formal and slang jargon, as in general English, are quite fluid, with terms sliding in and out of recognition. This is especially true in the rapidly developing world of computers and networking. For instance, the term ''[[Firewall (networking)|firewall]]'' (in the sense of a device used to filter network traffic) was at first technical slang. As these devices became more important and the term became widely understood, the word was adopted as formal terminology. Technical terminology evolves due to the need for experts in a field to communicate with precision and brevity, but often has the effect of excluding those who are unfamiliar with the particular specialized language of the group. This can cause difficulties as, for example, when a patient is unable to follow the discussions of medical practitioners, and thus cannot understand his own condition and treatment. Differences in jargon also cause difficulties where professionals in related fields use different terms for the same phenomena. For instance, substantial amounts of duplicated research occur in [[cognitive psychology]] and [[human-computer interaction]] partly because of such difficulties. {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The term ''jargon'' can, and often does, have pejorative connotations, particularly when aimed at "business culture" (especially when in forms bordering on slang or buzzwords). The [[marketing]] and [[public relations]] industries in particular have expanded the lexicon of business terms that marks the global [[business]] environment.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} ==Examples of technical terminology (specific fields)== * [[Glossary of legal terms|Legal]] * [[Glossary of nautical terms|Nautical]] * [[Scientific terminology|Scientific]] * [[International scientific vocabulary]] * [[Medical terminology|Medical]] * [[Economics terminology that differs from common usage]] ==See also== *[[Argot]] *[[Buzzword]] *[[Colloquialism]] *[[Critical vocabulary]] *[[Eurodicautom]] *[[Jargon]] *[[Legal writing]] *[[Lexigraf]] *[[Nomenclature]] *[[Orismology]] *[[Register (sociolinguistics)]] *[[Shibboleth]] *[[Three-letter acronym]] *[[Variety (linguistics)]] *[[Workplace jargon]] ==References== <references/> ==External links== *[http://www.economics.soton.ac.uk/staff/aldrich/Mathematical%20Words.htm Mathematical Words: Origins and Sources] (John Aldrich, University of Southampton) Discusses the technical vocabulary of mathematics.

It draws on theories and methods from multiple knowledge domains to provide insights on ethical dimensions of technological systems and practices for advancing a technological society. Technoethics (TE) views technology and ethics as socially embedded enterprises and focuses on discovering the ethical use of technology, protecting against the misuse of technology, and devising common principles to guide new advances in technological development and application to benefit society. Typically, scholars in Technoethics have a tendency to conceptualize technology and ethics as interconnected and embedded in life and society. ==Definitions== Technoethics (TE) has been defined in a variety of ways over the last decade which highlight different aspects of this emerging field. Galvan (2001) defined Technoethics as the “sum total of ideas that bring into evidence a system of ethical reference that justifies that profound dimension of technology as a central element in the attainment of a ‘finalized’ perfection of man.” Bao and Xiang (2006) described Technoethics as the behavioral norm and ethical basis for the global community. The Handbook of Research on Technoethics defined Technoethics as “an interdisciplinary field concerned with all ethical aspects of technology within a society shaped by technology. It deals with human processes and practices connected to technology which are embedded within social, political, and moral spheres of life” (Luppicini, 2008). ==History of Technoethics== Technoethics is a rapidly expanding research area that evolved during the 1970s and 1980s from the confluence of a variety of disciplines and disciplinary subfields which viewed science and technology as socially embedded enterprises. It developed as a grounding framework for a rapidly emerging body of scholarship dealing with the interconnection of technology and ethics. It has roots
