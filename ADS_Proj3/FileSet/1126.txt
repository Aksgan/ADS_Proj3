By collecting blood for HIV testing from representative samples of the population of men and women in a country, MEASURE DHS can provide nationally representative estimates of HIV rates. The testing protocol provides for anonymous, informed, and voluntary testing of women and men. The project also collects data on internationally recognized AIDS indicators. Currently, the main sources of HIV/AIDS indicators in the database are the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), the [[Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey]]s (MICS), the Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS), the Sexual Behavior Surveys (SBS), and Behavioral Surveillance Surveys (BSS).<ref>[http://www.fhi.org/en/topics/bss.htm FHI.org BSS]</ref> Eventually it will cover all countries for which indicators are available. Finally, the project also collects data on the capacity of health care facilities to deliver HIV prevention and treatment services. ===Malaria=== Since 2000, DHS (and some AIS) surveys have collected data on ownership and use of mosquito nets, treatment of fever in children, and intermittent preventive treatment of pregnant women. In recent years, additional questions on indoor residual spraying, as well as biomarker testing for anemia and malaria have been conducted. ===Gender=== The MEASURE DHS program is a major source of gender data, research and training for integrating gender into population, health and nutrition programs and HIV/AIDS-related activities in the developing world. Gender is a fundamental dimension of societal stratification. MEASURE DHS underscores the importance of providing accurate and useful data on gender and emphasizes the need to identify and develop meaningful indicators of gender relations and women's empowerment. Questions on gender roles and empowerment are integrated into most DHS questionnaires. For countries interested in more in-depth data on gender, modules of questions are available on special topics such as status of women, [[domestic violence]], and [[female genital cutting]]. ===Youth=== MEASURE DHS has interviewed thousands of young people and gathered valuable information about their education, employment, media exposure, nutrition, sexual activity, fertility, unions, and general reproductive health, including HIV prevalence. The Youth Corner in the MEASURE DHS website presents findings about youth and features in-depth profiles of young adults ages 15–24 from more than 30 countries worldwide.<ref>[http://www.measuredhs.com/topics/youth/start.cfm Measure DHS Youth Topics]</ref> The Youth Corner is part of the broader effort by the Interagency Youth Working Group (IYWG) to help program managers, donors, national and local governments, teachers, religious leaders, and nongovernmental organizations ([[NGO]]s) plan and implement strong, relevant programs to improve the reproductive health of young adults.<ref>[http://www.infoforhealth.org/youthwg Interagency Youth Working Group]</ref> ===Geographic Information=== Geographic location affects peoples’ health, nutrition, and access to health care services. The MEASURE DHS project can now analyze the impact of location using DHS data and [[geographic information systems]] (GIS). MEASURE DHS routinely collects geographic information in all surveyed countries. Using GIS, researchers can link DHS data with routine health data, health facility locations, local infrastructure such as roads and rivers, and environmental conditions. MEASURE DHS is a recognized leader in training local interviewers to collect geographic information. The [[GPS]] data collection standards and manual prepared by MEASURE DHS are now being used for the [[World bank|World Bank]]’s Living Standards and Measurement studies and the World Health Organization’s World Health Surveys. UNICEF has also adapted the DHS manual for their [[Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey]]s in the upcoming round of data collection. ===Biomarkers=== Now, using field-friendly technologies, MEASURE DHS is able to collect biomarker data relating to a wide range of conditions and infections. DHS surveys have tested for [[anemia]] (by measuring [[hemoglobin]]), HIV infection, [[sexually transmitted diseases]] such as syphilis and the herpes simplex virus, serum retinol ([[Vitamin A]]), lead exposure, high blood pressure, and immunity from vaccine-preventable diseases like measles and tetanus. Traditionally, much of the data gathered in DHS surveys is self-reported. Biomarkers complement this information by providing an objective profile of a specific disease or health condition in a population. Biomarker
