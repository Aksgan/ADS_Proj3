equal amount of screen time as Disney's biggest star, Mickey Mouse. Because of this, both characters are always together in frame when onscreen. For the same reasons, Bugs never calls Mickey by his name, only referring to him as "Doc," while Mickey calls him "Bugs." Bugs Bunny came back to the silver screen in ''[[Box Office Bunny]]'' in 1990. This was the first Bugs Bunny cartoon short since 1964 to be released to theaters, and it was created for the Bugs Bunny 50th anniversary celebration. It was followed in 1991 by ''[[(Blooper) Bunny]],'' a short that has gained a cult following among some animation fans for its edgy humor. Bugs made an appearance in the 1990 drug prevention video ''[[Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue]].'' This special is notable for being the first time that somebody other than Mel Blanc voiced Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. (In this video, both characters were voiced by [[Jeff Bergman]].) In 1997, Bugs appeared on a [[stamp collecting|U.S. postage stamp]], the first cartoon to be so honored, beating the iconic Mickey Mouse. The stamp is number seven on the list of the ten most popular U.S. stamps, as calculated by the number of stamps purchased but not used. The introduction of Bugs onto a stamp was controversial at the time, as it was seen as a step toward the 'commercialization' of stamp art. The postal service rejected many designs, and went with a postal-themed drawing. Avery Dennison printed the Bugs Bunny stamp sheet, which featured "a special ten-stamp design and was the first self-adhesive [[Miniature sheet|souvenir sheet]] issued by the [[U.S. Postal Service]]."<ref>[http://postalmuseum.si.edu/artofthestamp/SubPage%20table%20images/artwork/rarities/Bug%20Bunny/bugsbunny.htm ''Looney Tunes: Bugs Bunny stamp''.] [[National Postal Museum]] [[Smithsonian]].</ref> A younger version of Bugs is the main character of ''[[Baby Looney Tunes]],'' which debuted on [[Cartoon Network]] in 2002. In the action comedy ''[[Loonatics Unleashed]]'', his definite descendant Ace Bunny is the leader of the Loonatics team and seems to have inherited his ancestor's Brooklyn accent and comic wit. Strangely, Bugs was one of the few Looney Tunes characters who never appeared in the 2003 Duck Dodgers [[Duck Dodgers (TV series)|series]]. Bugs has appeared in numerous [[video game]]s, including the ''Bugs Bunny's Crazy Castle'' series, ''[[The Bugs Bunny Birthday Blowout|Bugs Bunny Birthday Blowout]]'', ''[[Bugs Bunny Rabbit Rampage|Bugs Bunny: Rabbit Rampage]]'' and the similar ''[[Bugs Bunny in Double Trouble]]'', ''[[Looney Tunes B-Ball]]'', ''[[Space Jam]]'', ''[[Looney Tunes Racing]]'', ''[[Looney Tunes: Space Race]]'', ''[[Bugs Bunny Lost in Time]]'', and its sequel, ''[[Bugs Bunny and Taz Time Busters]]'', and ''Looney Tunes: Back in Action'' and the new video game ''[[Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal]]''. Bugs and the rest of the [[Looney Tunes]] gang will return to [[Cartoon Network]] in 2011 in a brand new show called ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]'', with [[Jeff Bergman]] returning to voice both Bugs Bunny and [[Daffy Duck]]. On August 13, 2010, Warner Bros. Pictures announced that they are planning a live-action/CG-animated combo feature film based on the Looney Tunes character.<ref>http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=68752</ref> ==Personality and catchphrases== Bugs has feuded with [[Elmer Fudd]], [[Yosemite Sam]], [[Willoughby the Dog]], [[Marvin the Martian]], [[Beaky Buzzard]], [[Daffy Duck]], [[Porky Pig]], [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Tasmanian Devil]], [[Cecil Turtle]], [[Charlie Dog]], [[Witch Hazel (Looney Tunes)|Witch Hazel]], [[Rocky and Mugsy]], [[Wile E. Coyote]], [[The Crusher (Looney Tunes)|the Crusher]], [[Gremlin]], [[Big Bad Wolf]], [[Count Blood Count]] and a host of others. Bugs almost always wins these conflicts, a plot pattern which recurs in ''Looney Tunes'' films directed by Chuck Jones. Concerned that viewers would lose sympathy for an aggressive protagonist who always won, Jones arranged for Bugs to be bullied, cheated, or threatened by the [[antagonist]]s while minding his own business, justifying his subsequent antics as retaliation or self-defense. He's also been known to break the [[fourth wall]] by "communicating" with the audience, either by explaining the situation (ex. "Be with you in a minute, folks!"), describing someone to the audience (ex. "Feisty, ain't they?"), clueing in on the story (ex. "This happens to him all during the picture, folks."), etc. Bugs will usually try to placate the antagonist and avoid conflict, but when an antagonist pushes him too far, Bugs may address the audience and invoke his catchphrase "Of course you realize this means ''war!''" before he retaliates, and the retaliation will be devastating. This line was taken from [[Groucho Marx]] and others in the 1933 film ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'' and was also used in the 1935 Marx film ''[[A Night at the Opera (film)|A Night at the Opera]]''.<ref name="Duck Soup">{{Cite web|url=http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/d/duck-soup-script-transcript-marx.html |title=Transcript of '&#39;Duck Soup'&#39; |publisher=Script-o-rama.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-20}}</ref> Bugs would pay homage to Groucho in other ways, such as occasionally adopting his stooped walk or leering eyebrow-raising (in ''[[Hair-Raising Hare]]'', for example) or sometimes with a direct impersonation (as in ''[[Slick Hare]]''). Other directors, such as Friz Freleng, characterized Bugs as altruistic. When Bugs meets other successful characters (such as Cecil Turtle in ''[[Tortoise Beats Hare]]'', or, in World War II, the Gremlin of ''[[Falling Hare]]''), his overconfidence becomes a disadvantage. During the 1940s, Bugs was immature and wild, but starting in the 1950s his personality matured and his attitude was less frenetic. Though often shown as highly mischievous and violent, Bugs is never actually malicious, and only acts as such in [[self-defense]] against his aggressors; the only cartoon where Bugs ever served as a true villain was [[Buckaroo Bugs]]. Bugs Bunny's nonchalant carrot-chewing standing position, as explained by Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng, and [[Bob Clampett]], originated in a scene in the film ''[[It Happened One Night]]'', in which [[Clark Gable]]'s character leans against a fence, eating carrots rapidly and talking with his mouth full to [[Claudette Colbert]]'s character. This scene was well known while the film was popular, and viewers at the time likely recognized Bugs Bunny's behavior as [[satire]].<ref name="filmsite">{{Cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/itha.html |title='&#39;It Happened One Night'&#39; film review by Tim Dirks |publisher=Filmsite.org |date= |accessdate=2009-09-20}}</ref> The carrot-chewing scenes are generally followed by Bugs Bunny's most well-known catchphrase, "What's up, Doc?", which was written by director Tex Avery for his first Bugs Bunny short, 1940's ''A Wild Hare''.
