He automated the crib process, creating the ''Eins Catalogue'', which assumed that ''eins'' was encoded at all positions in the plaintext. The catalogue included every possible rotor position for ''EINS'' with that day's ''wheel order'' and plugboard connections. ===British ''bombe''=== {{main|Bombe}} The British bombe was an electromechanical device designed by [[Alan Turing]] soon after he arrived at [[Bletchley Park]] in September 1939. [[Harold Keen|Harold "Doc" Keen]] of the [[British Tabulating Machine Company]] (BTM) in [[Letchworth]] ({{km to mi|35}} from Bletchley) was the engineer who turned Turing's ideas into a working machineâ€”under the codename CANTAB.<ref>{{ Citation | contribution = BTM - British Tabulatuing Machine Company Ltd | contribution-url = http://www.jharper.demon.co.uk/btm1.htm | editor-last = Harper | editor-first = John | title = The British Bombe CANTAB | url = http://www.jharper.demon.co.uk/bombe1.htm }}</ref> Turing's specification developed the ideas of the Poles' [[Bomba (cryptography)|''bomba kryptologiczna'']] but was designed for the much more general [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#Crib-based decryption|crib-based decryption]]. The bombe helped to identify the ''wheel order'', the initial positions of the rotor cores, and the ''stecker partner'' of a specified letter. This was achieved by examining all 17,576 possible scrambler positions for a set of ''wheel orders'' on a comparison between a crib and the ciphertext, so as to eliminate possibilities that [[Contradiction|contradicted]] the Enigma's known characteristics. In the words of [[Gordon Welchman]] "the task of the bombe was simply to reduce the assumptions of ''wheel order'' and scrambler positions that required 'further analysis' to a manageable number."<ref name=Welchman84p120/> [[Image:TuringBombeBletchleyPark.jpg|thumbnail|right|300px|Replica of a British [[bombe]] at [[Bletchley Park]]]] The demountable drums on the front of the bombe were wired identically to the connections made by Enigma's different rotors. Unlike them, however, the input and output contacts for the left-hand and the right-hand sides were separate, making 104 contacts between each drum and the rest of the machine.<ref>{{ Citation | last = Sale | first = Tony | author-link = Anthony Sale | contribution = Alan Turing, the Enigma and the Bombe | contribution-url = http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/virtualbp/tbombe/tbombe.htm | editor-last = Sale | editor-first = Tony | editor-link = Anthony Sale | title = The Enigma cipher machine | url = http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/enigma/ }}</ref> This allowed a set of scramblers to be connected [[Series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|in series]] by means of 26-way cables. Electrical connections between the rotating drums' wiring and the rear plugboard were by means of metal brushes. When the bombe detected a scrambler position with no contradictions, it stopped and the operator would note the position before re-starting it. Although Welchman had been given the task of studying Enigma traffic [[Call sign|callsigns]] and discriminants, he knew from Turing about the bombe design and early in 1940, before the first pre-production bombe was delivered, he showed him an idea to increase its effectiveness.<ref>[[Andrew Hodges|Hodges]] (1983) p. 183</ref> It exploited the reciprocity in plugboard connections, to reduce considerably the number of scrambler settings that needed to be considered further. This became known as the ''diagonal board'' and was subsequently incorporated to great effect in all the bombes.<ref>[[Gordon Welchman|Welchman]] (1984) pp. 295-309</ref><ref>{{ Citation | last = Ellsbury | first = Graham | year = 1998 | contribution = The Turing Bombe: What it was and how it worked | contribution-url = http://www.ellsbury.com/bombe3.htm | editor-last = Ellsbury | editor-first = Graham | title = The Enigma and the Bombe | url = http://www.ellsbury.com/enigmabombe.htm }}</ref> A cryptanalyst would prepare a crib for comparison with the ciphertext. This was a complicated and sophisticated task, which later took the Americans some time to master. As well as the crib, a decision as to which of the many possible ''wheel orders'' could be omitted had to be made. Turing's [[Banburismus]] was used in making this major economy. The cryptanalyst would then compile a [[Bombe#Bombe menu|''menu'']] which specified the connections of the cables of the patch panels on the back of the machine, and a particular letter whose ''stecker partner'' was sought. The menu reflected the relationships between the letters of the crib and those of the ciphertext. Some of these formed loops (or ''closures'' as Turing called them) in a similar way to the ''cycles'' that the Poles had exploited. The reciprocal nature of the plugboard meant that no letter could be connected to more than one other letter. When there was a contradiction of two different letters apparently being ''stecker partners'' with the letter in the menu, the bombe would detect this, and move on. If, however, this happened with a letter that was not part of the menu, a false stop could occur. In refining down the set of stops for further examination, the cryptanalyst would eliminate stops that contained such a contradiction. The other plugboard connections and the settings of the alphabet rings would then be worked out before the scrambler positions at the possible true stops were tried out on [[Typex]] machines that had been adapted to mimic Enigmas. All the remaining stops would correctly decrypt the crib, but only the true stop would produce the correct plaintext of the whole message.<ref name=CarterStopsKeys/> To avoid wasting scarce bombe time on menus that were likely to yield an excessive number of false stops, Turing performed a lengthy probability analysis (without any electronic aids) of the estimated number of stops per rotor order. It was adopted as standard practice only to use menus that were estimated to produce no more than four stops per ''wheel order''. This allowed an 8-letter crib for a 3-closure menu, an 11-letter crib for a 2-closure menu and a 14-letter crib for a menu with only one closure. If there was no closure, at least 16 letters were required in the crib.<ref name=CarterStopsKeys>{{ citation | last = Carter | first =
