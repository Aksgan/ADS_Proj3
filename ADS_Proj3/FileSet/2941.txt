To this date there are Easter-eggs and cross-references on both MindVox<ref name="mvbios">[http://www.phantom.com/staticpage/About/VoxBios.html MindVox 2000 biographies page]</ref> and the system that Tom Dell became better known for in the late 90's and beyond: [[Rotten.com]]. Going to Rotten's search page<ref name="rttn">[http://www.rotten.com/search Rotten.com ibogaine secret message]</ref>, and triple-clicking on the whitespace located between the Contact section and the gray bar at the bottom, reveals an inscrutable ibogaine rant. By the mid-90's the original Waffle software was nearly unrecognizable; Fancher had converted ''Voice'' to a client-server architecture<ref name="faq2.43">[http://www.textfiles.com/bbs/MINDVOX/FAQ/faq-2.43 MindVox FAQ, circa 1994]</ref>, included a web interface<ref name="mindvoxwww">[http://web.archive.org/web/19961111052514/http://phantom.com/ Archive.org snapshot of MindVox WWW page, circa 1996]</ref>, and added elaborate "power user" features which seem to have been added to address the evolving needs of the community; or due to a strange combination of drugs, nostalgia and pure whim. An example of the latter case is VoxChat<ref name="voxchat">[http://www.textfiles.com/bbs/MINDVOX/DOCUMENTS/bufu MindVox's VoxChat(TM) Welcome Screen]</ref>, a proprietary chat system written for MindVox by employee David Schenfeld, which spun off into the commercial product [[ENTchat]] after MindVox shut down<ref name="ddial">[http://ddial.com/highlight.html The History of Diversi-Dial]</ref>. [[Diversi-Dial]], and the Diversi-Dial spinoff ENTchat, allowed MindVox to connect via the Diversi-Dial chat protocol.<ref name="voxchat2">[http://www.textfiles.com/bbs/MINDVOX/MENUS/chat MindVox Chat System]</ref>), or in Kroupa's own words: :As of this writing there are roughly a dozen remaining DDIAL's running on Apple computers, Novation has long since gone Chapter 11, Bill Basham (the author of DDIAL) has gone back to being a full-time doctor, and one slightly disturbed person in the Phantom Access Group has written the world's only version of DDIAL that will run on Unix based machines and allow T1 connected, distributed sites with gigabytes of disk and thousands of users, to hook into Pig's Knuckle Idaho's very own 7 line DDIAL running at a blazing fast 300 baud. Why this was done is a question best left to mental health professionals.<ref name="faq2.43" /> The last sentence in the paragraph quoted above could be applied to many features present in the MindVox shell<ref name="mindvoxshell">[http://www.textfiles.com/bbs/MINDVOX/DOCUMENTS/shell Introduction message for MindVox shell accounts]</ref>,<ref name="mindvoxwords">[http://www.textfiles.com/bbs/MINDVOX/mindvox.words.txt MindVox words collection]</ref>.

When inappropriate or extremely off-topic material was posted to a conference; moderators were unable to remove or destroy the message entirely, but they could move the message to the '''''r0mPEr-RuM''''', a conference that was the collective garbage-dump of MindVox. To this day the phantom.com MindVox archive continues its relationship with NeXT/NeXTSTEP, now in the form of [[Apple Computer]]'s [[Mac OS X]]. Instead of using [[php]], [[perl]] or [[Active Server Pages]], the entire site runs Apple's [[WebObjects]]. MindVox was a fusion of many strange parts, pieces and times. While Kroupa might be said to have provided the imaginative backstory of the "thoughtscape", Fancher was largely responsible for the software that made it all work. The synergy of Kroupa, Fancher and the user-base MindVox attracted was a major aspect of MindVox's rise to fame. ==The MindVox shutdown== MindVox began to fall apart around 1996, when it ceased operating as an ISP, and shut off dial-up access. While the exact date of the shutdown is disputed, the New York Times lists the closure as occurring in July of that year<ref name="subscribers" />. Ironically this happened a few months after [[New York Magazine]] voted MindVox as one of the three best ISP's in New York<ref name="bestisps">[http://www.phantom.com/staticpage/Media/NewYork2.html Three Best Internet Service Providers in NYC, New York Magazine]</ref>. A public message<ref name="customerssold">[http://web.archive.org/web/19961111052536/phantom.com/announcement.html Archive.org copy of MindVox's announcement of the sale of their client-base]</ref> noted that free telnet access to the MindVox servers would still be available after the shutdown, but this did not last. While users were given the option to transfer their accounts to [[Interport Communications]], the unique MindVox community did not survive. Many different reasons have been given for the downfall, including increased competition from the arrival of large-scale providers like AT&T, possible legal difficulties, and the apparent incestuousness of the company and its core users<ref name="MindVoxRocksWired" />. But none of the theories provided realistic answers as to why the final days of MindVox seem to be closer to [[The Great Gatsby]]<ref name="gatsbyquote">[http://web.archive.org/web/20031005231435/www.kenkappel.com/texthtml/Time-for-an-Accounting.html MindVox lawsuit paperwork with plaintiff quoting the Great Gatsby at MindVox principles]</ref>, and [[Altered States]]<ref name="kroupacb">[http://ibogaine.mindvox.com/Media/CoolBeans.htm Patrick Kroupa interview, Cool Beans Magazine]</ref>, than a successful or unsuccessful technology corporation. Much of the legal paperwork from the time reads like something out of [[The Bonfire of the Vanities]]<ref name="lawsuit2">[http://web.archive.org/web/20031116040706/www.kenkappel.com/pdf/Telephone-Conversation-September-28-1995.pdf Archive.org copy of MindVox legal melodrama and rambling accusations]</ref>. A 1999 article by Tom Higgins (username "Tomwhore" on the system), a user and one time employee of MindVox, summarized the turbulent closing thus: :So what happened to MindVox? In short its customers happened. Under the strain of pleasing a paying customer base, watching a hobby turn into an industry and simply getting caught up in its own hype, MindVox tumbled into a soap opera nose dive of sex, drugs and mismanagement.<ref name="mindvox9">[http://phantom.com/staticpage/Akashic/MindVoxFC.html MindVox FC (First Cataclysm), The Whole Entire Story in its Complete Totality]</ref> By 1997 Patrick Kroupa had effectively disappeared from public view. The last days of MindVox are more the stuff of mythology than recorded fact, with different publications listing different dates for the shutdown. The New York Times and Wired were apparently unable to arrive at a consensus, with the Times listing the sale of MindVox's client-base and the closing of the system, in 1996<ref name="subscribers" />, while Wired was still covering an apparently open and at least partially operational MindVox circa 1997<ref name="MindVoxRocksWired" />.
