Processing Language) used to implement custom [[algorithm]]s. DADiSP is widely used in the study of [[signal processing]], [[numerical analysis]] and [[statistical]] data analysis applications. DADiSP was originally developed in the early 1980’s as part of a research project at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] to explore the aerodynamics of [[Formula One]] racing cars. == See also == * [[List of numerical analysis software]] ==External links== * [http://www.dadisp.com DSP Development Corporation (DADiSP vendor)] [[Category:Numerical_software]] {{software-type-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>8920</id> <title>DASK</title> <text>The '''DASK''' was the first [[computer]] in [[Denmark]]. It was commissioned in 1955, designed and constructed by [[Regnecentralen]], and began operation in September 1957. '''DASK''' is an [[acronym]] for '''D'''ansk '''A'''lgoritmisk '''S'''ekvens '''K'''alkulator or ''Danish Algorithmic Sequence Calculator''. Regnecentralen almost didn't allow the name, as the word ''dask'' means "slap" in Danish. In the end however, it was named so as it fit the pattern of the name [[BESK]], the [[Sweden|Swedish]] computer which provided the initial architecture for DASK. DASK traces its origins to 1947 and a goal set by ''Akademiet for de Tekniske Videnskaber'' (''Academy for the Technical Sciences'' or ''Academy of Applied Sciences''), which was to follow the development of the modern [[computer|computing devices]]. Initial funding was obtained through the [[Ministry of Defence (Denmark)]] as the [[Military of Denmark|Danish Military]] had been given a grant through the [[Marshall Plan]] for [[encryption|cipher machines]] for which the military saw no immediate need. Originally conceived to be a copy of [[BESK]], the rapid advancement in the field allowed improvements to be made during the development such that in the end, it was not a copy of BESK. The DASK was a one-off design that took place in a villa. The machine became so big that the floor had to be reinforced to support its mass of 3.5 metric tons. DASK is notable for being the subject of one of the earliest [[ALGOL]] implementations, referred to as '''DASK ALGOL''' <ref>{{cite web | title=DASK ALGOL | url=http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/algol/ACM_Algol_bulletin/1060952/p3-naur.pdf | accessdate=May 15, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927225919/http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/algol/ACM_Algol_bulletin/1060952/p3-naur.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = September 27, 2007}}</ref>, which counted [[Jørn Jensen]] and [[Peter Naur]] among its contributors. ==Architecture== The DASK was a [[vacuum tube]] machine based on the Swedish [[BESK]] design. As described in 1956, it contained 2500 vacuum tubes, 1500 solid-state elements, and required a [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase power]] supply of at least 15 kW. Fast storage was 1024 40-bit words of [[magnetic core memory]] (cycle time 5µs), directly addressable as 1024 full or 2048 half-words. This was complemented by an additional 8192 words of backing store on [[Drum memory|magnetic drum]] (3000 rpm). A full word stored 40-bit numbers in two's-complement form, or two 20-bit instructions. In addition to two [[Accumulator (computing)|accumulators]], the DASK had three [[index register]]s, which could be used to modify the address of most instructions. An instruction word consisted of 11 bits for an address, two bits for index register selection, and 7 bits for the operation code and its modifiers. Operations included addition and subtraction (56 µs), multiplication and division (364 µs), binary shift and bitwise conjunction. Peripherals initially included 5-bit paper tape (400 cps read time) and teletypewriter (12 cps); magnetic tape and other peripherals were added later on. ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.beagle-ears.com/lars/engineer/comphist/dan_hist.htm Early Computing in Denmark] *[http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/showlanguage.prx?exp=3549 HOPL entry for DASK Algol] *[http://www.datamuseum.dk/site_dk/index.shtml Dansk Datahistorisk Forening] Virtual Museum (in [[Danish language|Danish]]) *[http://www.datamuseum.dk/site_dk/rc/dask/daskdoc/cifferregnemaskine.pdf Technical description of the DASK] (in [[Danish language|Danish]]) {{DEFAULTSORT:Dask}} [[Category:Early computers]] [[Category:One-of-a-kind computers]] [[Category:Algol programming language family]] [[Category:Science and technology in Denmark]] [[da:DASK]] [[es:DASK]] [[ja:DASK]] [[sv:Dansk Aritmetisk Sekvenskalkulator]]</text> </page> <page> <id>8925</id> <title>DAVID (bioinformatics tool)</title> <text>{{Infobox Software | name = DAVID Bioinformatics Resources | screenshot = | caption = | author = Richard A.

All tools in the DAVID Bioinformatics Resources aim to provide functional interpretation of large lists of genes derived from genomic studies, e.g. microarray and proteomics studies. DAVID can be found at http://david.niaid.nih.gov or http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov == Introduction to DAVID == The newly updated DAVID Bioinformatics Resources consists of the DAVID Knowledgebase and five integrated, web-based functional annotation tool suites: the DAVID Gene Functional Classification Tool, the DAVID Functional Annotation Tool, the DAVID Gene ID Conversion Tool, the DAVID Gene Name Viewer and the DAVID NIAID Pathogen Genome Browser. The expanded DAVID Knowledgebase now integrates almost all major and well-known public bioinformatics resources centralized by the DAVID Gene Concept, a single-linkage method to agglomerate tens of millions of diverse gene/protein identifiers and annotation terms from a variety of public bioinformatics databases. For any uploaded gene list, the DAVID Resources now provides not only the typical gene-term enrichment analysis, but also new tools and functions that allow users to condense large gene lists into gene functional groups, convert between gene/protein identifiers, visualize many-genes-to-many-terms relationships, cluster redundant and heterogeneous terms into groups, search for interesting and related genes or terms, dynamically view genes from their lists on bio-pathways and more. With DAVID, investigators gain more power to interpret the biological mechanisms associated with large gene lists. == Functionality Highlights == DAVID now provides a comprehensive set of functional annotation tools for investigators to understand biological meaning behind large list of genes. For any given gene list, DAVID tools are able to: * Identify enriched biological themes, particularly GO terms * Discover enriched functional-related gene groups * Cluster redundant annotation terms * Visualize genes on BioCarta & KEGG pathway maps * Display related many-genes-to-many-terms on 2-D view. * Search for other functionally related genes not in the list * List interacting proteins * Explore gene
