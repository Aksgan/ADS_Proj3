the sales price to determine some form of sales-margin figure. Manufacturing management is more interested in ''inventory turnover ratio'' or ''average days to sell inventory'' since it tells them something about relative inventory levels. :Inventory turnover ratio (also known as [[inventory turns]]) = cost of goods sold / Average Inventory = Cost of Goods Sold / ((Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2) and its inverse :Average Days to Sell Inventory = Number of Days a Year / Inventory Turnover Ratio = 365 days a year / Inventory Turnover Ratio This ratio estimates how many times the inventory turns over a year. This number tells how much cash/goods are tied up waiting for the process and is a critical measure of process reliability and effectiveness. So a factory with two inventory turns has six months stock on hand, which is generally not a good figure (depending upon the industry), whereas a factory that moves from six turns to twelve turns has probably improved effectiveness by 100%. This improvement will have some negative results in the financial reporting, since the 'value' now stored in the factory as inventory is reduced. While these accounting measures of inventory are very useful because of their simplicity, they are also fraught with the danger of their own assumptions. There are, in fact, so many things that can vary hidden under this appearance of simplicity that a variety of 'adjusting' assumptions may be used. These include: * [[Specific Identification]] * [[Weighted Average Cost]] * [[Moving-Average Cost]] * [[FIFO and LIFO accounting|FIFO and LIFO]]. Inventory Turn is a financial accounting tool for evaluating inventory and it is not necessarily a management tool. Inventory management should be forward looking. The methodology applied is based on historical cost of goods sold. The ratio may not be able to reflect the usability of future production demand, as well as customer demand. Business models, including Just in Time (JIT) Inventory, Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) and Customer Managed Inventory (CMI), attempt to minimize on-hand inventory and increase inventory turns. VMI and CMI have gained considerable attention due to the success of third-party vendors who offer added expertise and knowledge that organizations may not possess. ==Accounting for inventory== {{Accounting}} Each country has its own rules about [[accounting]] for inventory that fit with their financial-reporting rules. For example, organizations in the U.S. define '''inventory''' to suit their needs within [[US generally accepted accounting principles|US Generally Accepted Accounting Practices]] (GAAP), the rules defined by the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] (FASB) (and others) and enforced by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) and other federal and state agencies. Other countries often have similar arrangements but with their own GAAP and national agencies instead. It is intentional that [[financial accounting]] uses standards that allow the public to compare firms' performance, [[cost accounting]] functions internally to an organization and potentially with much greater flexibility. A discussion of inventory from standard and [[Theory of Constraints]]-based ([[throughput]]) [[cost accounting]] perspective follows some examples and a discussion of inventory from a [[financial accounting]] perspective. The internal costing/valuation of inventory can be complex. Whereas in the past most enterprises ran simple, one-process factories, such enterprises are quite probably in the minority in the 21st century. Where 'one process' factories exist, there is a market for the goods created, which establishes an independent market value for the good. Today, with multistage-process companies, there is much inventory that would once have been finished goods which is now held as 'work in process' (WIP). This needs to be valued in the accounts, but the valuation is a management decision since there is no market for the partially finished product. This somewhat arbitrary 'valuation' of WIP combined with the allocation of overheads to it has led to some unintended and undesirable results. ===Financial accounting=== An organization's inventory can appear a mixed blessing, since it counts as an [[asset]] on the [[balance sheet]], but it also ties up money that could serve for other purposes and requires additional expense for its protection. Inventory may also cause significant tax expenses, depending on particular countries' laws regarding depreciation of inventory, as in [[Thor Power Tool Company v. Commissioner]]. Inventory appears as a [[current asset]] on an organization's balance sheet because the organization can, in principle, turn it into cash by selling it. Some organizations hold larger inventories than their operations require in order to inflate their apparent asset value and their perceived profitability. In addition to the money tied up by acquiring inventory, inventory also brings associated costs for warehouse space, for utilities, and for [[insurance]] to cover staff to handle and protect it from fire and other disasters, obsolescence, shrinkage (theft and errors), and others. Such [[holding cost]]s can mount up: between a third and a half of its acquisition value per year. <!-- An organization that reduced its inventory by $1,000,000 would add that amount to its net income [huh??? Its net income would only increase by the income received minus the cost of the goods sold], an attractive prospect that helps to explain the popularity of programs like [[Just in time]] (JIT) inventory. --> Businesses that stock too little inventory cannot take advantage of large orders from customers if they cannot deliver. The conflicting objectives of cost control and customer service often pit an organization's financial and operating managers against its [[sales]] and [[marketing]] departments. Salespeople, in particular, often receive sales-commission payments, so unavailable goods may reduce their potential personal income. This conflict can be minimised by reducing production time to being near or less than customers' expected delivery time. This effort, known as "[[Lean production]]" will significantly reduce [[working capital]] tied up in inventory and reduce manufacturing costs (See the [[Toyota Production System]]). ===Role of inventory accounting=== By helping the organization to make better decisions, the accountants can help the public sector to change in a very positive way that delivers increased value for the taxpayerâ€™s investment. It can also help to incentivise progress and to ensure that reforms are sustainable and effective in
