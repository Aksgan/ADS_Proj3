According to his published biography on the MIT Media Lab webpage, "In 1956, when a Junior Fellow at Harvard, Minsky invented and built the first Confocal Scanning Microscope, an optical instrument with unprecedented resolution and image quality".</ref> (1957, a predecessor to today's widely used [[confocal laser scanning microscope]]). He developed, with [[Seymour Papert]], the first [[Logo programming language|Logo]] "[[turtle (robot)|turtle]]". Minsky also built, in 1951, the first randomly wired neural network learning machine, [[SNARC]]. Minsky wrote the book ''[[Perceptrons (book)|Perceptrons]]'' (with [[Seymour Papert]]), which became the foundational work in the analysis of [[artificial neural network]]s. This book is the center of a controversy in the history of AI, as some claim it to have had great importance in driving research away from neural networks in the 1970s, and contributing to the so-called [[AI winter]]. That said, few of the mathematical proofs present in the book, which are still important and interesting to the study of [[perceptron]] networks, were ever countered. He also founded several other famous AI models. His book "A framework for representing knowledge" created a new paradigm in programming. While his "Perceptrons" now is more historical than practical book, the theory of frames is in wide use. Minsky was an adviser<ref>For more, see this interview, http://mitpress.mit.edu/e-books/Hal/chap2/two3.html</ref> on the movie [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|''2001: A Space Odyssey'']] and is referred to in the movie and book. {{quote|Probably no one would ever know this; it did not matter. In the 1980s, Minsky and Good had shown how neural networks could be generated automatically—self replicated—in accordance with any arbitrary learning program. Artificial brains could be grown by a process strikingly analogous to the development of a human brain. In any given case, the precise details would never be known, and even if they were, they would be millions of times too complex for human understanding.|Arthur C. Clarke|''2001: A Space Odyssey''<ref>Clarke, Arthur C.: "2001: A Space Odyssey"</ref>}} In the early 1970s at the [[MIT]] Artificial Intelligence Lab, Minsky and [[Seymour Papert]] started developing what came to be called [[The Society of Mind]] theory. The theory attempts to explain how what we call intelligence could be a product of the interaction of non-intelligent parts. Minsky says that the biggest source of ideas about the theory came from his work in trying to create a machine that uses a robotic arm, a video camera, and a computer to build with children's blocks. In 1986, Minsky published ''[[The Society of Mind]]'', a comprehensive book on the theory which, unlike most of his previously published work, was written for a [[general audience]]. In November 2006, Minsky published ''[[The Emotion Machine]]'', a book that critiques many popular theories of how human minds work and suggests alternative theories, often replacing simple ideas with more complex ones.
