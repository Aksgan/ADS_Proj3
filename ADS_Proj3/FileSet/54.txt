<id>506</id> <title>ARLOGO</title> <text>{{Multiple issues|notability = December 2010|unreferenced = December 2010}} '''ARLOGO''' is the [[Arabic language]] [[Logo programming language|Logo]] Project. It is based on UCBLogo and is an attempt to create the first [[open-source]] Arabic programming language. At the moment, UCBLogo Arabic Beta 1 is available only for Microsoft Windows. ==External links== {{Portal|Free software}} *[http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/arlogo Project web page on Sourceforge] {{DEFAULTSORT:Arlogo}} [[Category:Free compilers and interpreters]] [[Category:Non-English-based programming languages]] [[Category:Logo programming language family]] {{programming-software-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>507</id> <title>ARM11</title> <text>{{Refimprove|date=February 2010}} '''ARM11''' is an [[ARM architecture]] [[32-bit]] [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] [[microprocessor]] family which introduced the ARMv6 architectural additions. These include [[SIMD]] media instructions, [[multiprocessor]] support and a new cache architecture. The implementation included significantly improved instruction processing pipeline, compared to previous [[ARM9]] or [[ARM10]] families, and is used in [[smartphones]] from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Nokia]], and others. The initial ARM11 core (ARM1136) was released to licensees in late 2002. The ARM11 family are currently the only ARMv6-architecture cores. There are however Thumb2-only ARMv6-M cores (Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M1), addressing [[microcontroller]] applications; ARM11 cores target more demanding applications. ==Differences from ARM9== In terms of instruction set, the ARM11 builds on the preceding [[ARM9]] generation. It incorporates all ARM926EJ-S features and adds the ARMv6 instructions for media support (SIMD) and accelerating IRQ response. Microarchitecture improvements in ARM11 cores<ref>"The ARM11 Microarchitecture", ARM Ltd, 2002</ref> include: * SIMD instructions which can double [[MPEG-4]] and audio [[digital signal processing]] [[algorithm]] speed * Cache is physically addressed, solving many cache aliasing problems and reducing context switch overhead * Unaligned and mixed-endian data access is supported * Reduced heat production and lower overheating risk * Redesigned pipeline, supporting faster clock speeds (target up to 1 GHz) ** Longer: 8 stages vs 5 ** Out-of-order completion ** Dynamic branch prediction/folding (like [[XScale]]) ** Cache misses don't block execution of non-dependent instructions ** Load/Store parallelism ** [[arithmetic and logic unit|ALU]] parallelism * [[64-bit]] data paths [[JTAG]] debug support (for halting, stepping, breakpoints, and watchpoints) was simplified. The EmbeddedICE module was replaced with an interface which became part of the ARMv7 architecture. The hardware tracing modules (ETM and ETB) are compatible, but updated, versions of those used in the ARM9. In particular, trace semantics were updated to address parallel instruction execution and data transfers. Also of note was ARM's effort to promote good [[Verilog]] coding styles and techniques to ensure semantically rigorous designs, preserving identical semantics throughout the chip design flow, which included extensive use of [[formal verification]] techniques. This is because ARM cores are integrated into many different designs, using a variety of [[logic synthesis]] tools and chip manufacturing processes, so the impact of its RTL quality is magnified many times<ref name="X">''The Dangers of Living with an X (bugs hidden in your Verilog)'', Version 1.1 (14th October, 2003).</ref>. Without such attention, integrating an ARM11 with third party designs could risk exposing hard-to-find latent bugs. (The ARM11 generation focussed more heavily on synthesis than previous generations, making such concerns be more of an issue.) ==ARM11 cores== There are currently four ARM11 cores: * ARM1136<ref name="arm1136">[http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0211k/DDI0211K_arm1136_r1p5_trm.pdf ARM1136JF-S and ARM1136J-S Technical Reference Manual] Revision: r1p5; ARM DDI 0211K</ref> (probably the most widely used core) * ARM1156 introducing Thumb2 instructions * ARM1176 introducing security extensions * ARM11MPcore introducing multicore support ==ARM11-based devices== {{expand list|date=December 2010}} * [[Texas Instruments]] [[OMAP|OMAP2]] series, with a [[Texas Instruments TMS320|TMS320]] C55x or C64x [[digital signal processor|DSP]] as a second core * [[Freescale]] i.MX3x series, such as [[i.MX31]], [[i.MX35]] * [[Nvidia Tegra]] * [[Samsung]] S3C64x0 * [[Qualcomm]] MSM720x * [[Qualcomm]] MSM7627 ==ARM11-based products== {{expand list|date=December 2010}}<!-- how far do we really want to expand this list?? --> [[GeeksPhone]] * [http://www.geeksphone.com/en/moviles/especificaciones.php GeeksPhone ONE] [[HTC]] * [[HTC Aria]] * [[HTC Dream]] * [[HTC Wildfire]] * [[HTC Hero]] * [[HTC Magic]] * [[HTC Legend]] * [[HTC Passion]] (Nexus One) * [[HTC Bravo]] (Desire) * [[HTC Touch Diamond]] * [[HTC Touch Pro]] * [[HTC Touch Diamond 2]] (HTC Topaz) * [[HTC Touch Pro 2]] (HTC Rhodium) * [[HTC TyTN II]] * [[myTouch 3G Slide]] (HTC Espresso) [[Apple Inc.]] * [[iPhone]] (2G and 3G) * [[iPod Touch]] (1G & 2G) [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] * All models of [[Amazon Kindle]] [[Motorola]] * [[Motorola RIZR Z8]] * [[Motorola Q|Motorola Q9 Series]] [[Nintendo]] * [[Nintendo 3DS]] [[Nokia]] * [[Nokia 5130 XpressMusic]] * [[Nokia 5230]] * [[Nokia 5320 XpressMusic]] * [[Nokia 5700 XpressMusic]] * [[Nokia 5800 XpressMusic]] * [[Nokia 5530 XpressMusic]] * [[Nokia X6]] * [[Nokia 6120 Classic]] * [[Nokia 6210 Navigator]] * [[Nokia 6220 Classic]] * [[Nokia 6290]] * [[Nokia 6700 Classic]] * [[Nokia 6710 Navigator]] * [[Nokia 6720 Classic]] * [[Nokia C5-00]] * [[Nokia C5-03]] * [[Nokia C6-00]] * [[Nokia C6-01]] * [[Nokia C7]] * [[Nokia E5]] * [[Nokia E51]] * [[Nokia E52]] * [[Nokia E55]] * [[Nokia E63]] * [[Nokia E71]] * [[Nokia E72]] * [[Nokia E73 Mode]] * [[Nokia E75]] * [[Nokia E90 Communicator]] * [[Nokia N79]] * [[Nokia N81]] * [[Nokia N82]] * [[Nokia N86 8MP]] * [[Nokia N93]] * [[Nokia N95]] * [[Nokia N97]] * [[Nokia N97 mini]] * [[Nokia N8]] * [[Nokia N800]] [[Internet Tablet]] [[Palm, Inc.|Palm]] * [[Palm Pixi]] [[Samsung]] * [[Samsung SGH-i627]] * [[Samsung I5700]] (Samsung Galaxy Spica/Portal/Lite) * [[Samsung i7500]] (Samsung i7500 Galaxy) * [[Samsung SGH-T939]](Samsung Behold II) * [[Samsung Omnia II]] * [[Samsung SPH-M900]] (Samsung Moment) * [[Samsung M910 Intercept|Samsung SPH-M910]] (Samsung Intercept) [[Sony Ericsson]] * [[Sony Ericsson Xperia X1]] * [[Sony Ericsson Elm]] * [[Sony Ericsson W995]] [[Microsoft]] * [[Zune HD]] * [[Kin One]] [[Smart Devices]] * [[SmartQ 5]] * [[Pandigital Novel (White Version)]] [[Zeebo]] * [[Zeebo]] (Game Console) * Some [[digital picture frame]]s/digital media frames also use the ARM11. ==See also== * [[ARM9]] * [[ARM7]] * [[ARMulator]] ==References== <references/> {{DEFAULTSORT:Arm11}} [[Category:ARM architecture]] [[ru:ARM11]]</text> </page> <page> <id>509</id> <title>ARM9</title> <text>'''ARM9''' is an [[ARM architecture]] [[32-bit]] [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]] family. With this design generation, ARM moved from a [[von Neumann architecture]] (Princeton architecture) to a [[Harvard architecture]] with separate instruction and [[bus (computing)|data buses]] (and caches), significantly increasing its potential speed. Most silicon chips integrating these cores will package them as [[modified Harvard architecture]] chips, combining the two address busses
