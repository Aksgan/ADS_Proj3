journey planning computations and to annotate its responses so as to inform users through both text and map representations. An IJP will typically use a standard interface such as [[Service Interface for Real Time Information|SIRI]], [[TPEG]] or [[DATEX2]] to obtain Situation information. Incidents are captured through an [[Incident Capturing System]] (ICS) by different operators and stakeholders, for example in Transport Operator Control Rooms, by broadcasters or by the emergency services. Text and image information can be combined with the trip result. Recent incidents can be considered within the routing as well as visualized in an interactive map. == See also == * [[Journey Planner]] * [[Public transport route planner]] * [[Transmodel]] * [[TPEG]] * [[Service Interface for Real Time Information]] * [[Transport Direct Portal]] *[[Intelligent Transport Systems]] * [[Modes of transport]] == Examples of IJP Systems == Large scale Examples of IJP systems include * JourneyOn - IJP comparing rail, buses, driving, walking and cycling developed by Steer Davies Gleave * [[Deutsche Bahn]]- using the IJP of Hacon * A-Train for Atlanta, GA - using Open Source called Five Points * [[Transport for London]] - using the IJP by Mentz Datenverarbeitung GmbH * [http://www.traveline.info: Traveline] and [http://www.transportdirect.info: Transport Direct] - using the IJP's of Trapeze Group, Jeppesen, JourneyPlan and Mentz Datenverarbeitung * Journey.fi [http://journey.fi] is an IJP for planning trips across Finland - using IPJ by Logica * [[Helsinki Metropolitan Area Council]] maintains an IJP for planning trips around the Finnish capital and surrounding areas [http://reittiopas.fi/en] - using IPJ by Logica * OV9292 for the Netherlands [http://www.9292ov.nl/] * ResRobot covering the whole Sweden [http://www.resrobot.se] * reseplanerare.trafiken.nu [http://reseplanerare.trafiken.nu/bin/query.exe/en?] in Stockholm compares public transport, car, bike, walk and combinations in one search. * Zoombu [http://www.zoombu.co.uk] finds and compares door-to-door routes from the UK to Europe via plane, train, car, coach, ferry.

This angle must be an angle on the inner side of the polygon to be an internal angle. A simple polygon has exactly one internal angle per [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]]. If every internal angle of a polygon is less than 180°, the polygon is called [[convex polygon|convex]]. In contrast, an '''exterior angle''' (or '''external angle''') is an angle formed by one side of a simple polygon and a line extended from an adjacent side. The sum of the internal angle and the external angle on the same vertex is 180°. For example: x+35+75=180<br /> x+110=180<br /> x+110-110=180-110<br /> x=70 The sum of all the internal angles of a polygon can be determined by 180(n-2) where n is the number of sides. A pentagon's internal angles add up to of 540 degrees (shown below)<br> <math>180(n-2)= 180(5-2)= 180(3)= 540</math><br> Knowing this you can easily find the measure of each angle if it is a equiangular polygon with <br><math>\frac{180(n-2)}{n}</math>. <br>So continuing from the above example with the pentagon:<br> <math>\frac{540}{n}=\frac{540}{5}=108</math> (The exterior angle can be worked out by doing the following sum 360/number of sides in the equiangular polygon The interior angle can then be found by taking away the value of the exterior angle from 180. So in a pentagon there are 5 sides so to work out the exterior angle you do 360/5 =72 So the interior angle is 180-72=108 so the interior angle = 108 degrees) The sum of the external angles of any convex polygon is 360°. ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.mathopenref.com/triangleinternalangles.html Internal angles of a triangle] {{DEFAULTSORT:Internal And External Angle}} [[Category:Geometry]] [[Category:Euclidean plane geometry]] [[ar:زاوية داخلية]] [[de:Innenwinkel]] [[es:Ángulo interior]] [[eu:Barne angelu]] [[ko:내각 (기하)]] [[km:មុំក្នុង]] [[pl:Kąt wewnętrzny]] [[th:มุมภายในและมุมภายนอก]]</text> </page> <page> <id>18904</id> <title>Internal discourse</title> <text>{{unreferenced|date=June 2009}} An '''inner discourse''', or '''internal discourse''', is a constructive act of the human [[mind]] and a tool for discovering new knowledge and making decisions. Along with [[feeling]]s such as joy, anger, fear, etc., and sensory [[awareness]], it is one of the few aspects of the processing of information and other mental activities of which humans can be directly aware. Inner discourse is so prominent in the human awareness of mental functioning that it may often seem to be synonymous with "mind." The view is then that "mind" means "what one experiences when thinking things out," and that "thinking things out" is believed to consist only of the words heard in internal discourse. This common sense idea of the mind must either block out the fact that the mind is constantly processing all kinds of information below the level of awareness, or else re-name that activity to some putatively "non-mental" status such as "reflex reaction" or even, sometimes, "demon possession." An inner discourse takes place much as would a discussion with a second person. One might think, "I need $27 for the paper boy. I have some paper currency in my wallet. Ten plus ten plus five... I have $25. Damn. Maybe I dropped coins in the sofa. Ah, here they are..." The ideal form of inner discourse would seem to be one that starts with statements about matters of fact and proceeds with logical rigor until a solution is achieved. On this view of thinking, progress toward better thinking is made when one learns how to evaluate how well "statements of fact" are actually grounded, and when one learns how to avoid logical errors. But one must also take account of questions like why one is seeking a solution (Why do I want to contribute money to this charity?), and why one may keep getting results that turn out to be biased in fairly consistent patterns (Why do I never give to charities
