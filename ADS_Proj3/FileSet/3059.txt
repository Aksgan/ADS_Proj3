the Web''' conference is the leading international conference in the field of [[museum]]s and their [[website]]s. It has been organized by [[Archives & Museum Informatics]] each Spring in [[North America]] since 1997.<ref>David Bearman and Jennifer Trant, [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1468-0033.00225 Interactivity comes of age: Museums and the World Wide Web], ''[[Museum International]]'', 51(4):20–24, 1999. {{DOI|10.1111/1468-0033.00225}}</ref><ref>''[http://museums.wikia.com/wiki/Museums_and_the_Web Museums and the Web]'', [http://museums.wikia.com/ Museums Wiki].</ref> The conference considers the interdisciplinary [[museology|museological]] field of how [[museum]]s and their users can benefit from the use of the [[World Wide Web]]. All papers from the conferences are freely available on the web. Selected papers are published in a printed proceedings each year. The first conference in 1997 attracted around 400 delegates from around the world and subsequent conferences have attracted even more. ''Museums and the Web'' also includes annual ''[[Best of the Web]]'' awards for museum-related websites in a number of different categories, as well as an overall winner.<ref>Internet: Best of the Web awards.

The connotation is that the management is making decisions without consulting the staff affected by those decisions, and possibly not even informing the staff until well after such decisions are made. This phenomenon is an [[anti-pattern]] most commonly found in organizations which have a strict hierarchy and barriers to cross-organizational communication (especially those with a [[Stovepipe (organisation)|stovepipe organization]]) but can be found in any organization. ==References== * [http://www.businessknowhow.com/manage/mushroom.htm Mushroom Management: Don't keep your workforce in the dark] * [http://www.cambridgenetwork.co.uk/pooled/articles/BF_NEWSART/view.asp?Q=BF_NEWSART_162438 End to Britains 'Mushroom Management' culture] * [http://viewfromthemountain.typepad.com/applepeels/2006/08/apples_mushroom.html Applepeels: Apple's Mushroom School of Management] * [http://www.cio.com/archive/051504/work.html CIO Magazine: The virtues of chit-chat: Making IT work] ==External links== * [http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=mushroom+management Urban Dictionary: Mushroom Management] [[Category:Anti-patterns]] [[category:Management]] {{business-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>25467</id> <title>Mutation (genetic algorithm)</title> <text>In [[genetic algorithm]]s of [[computing]], '''mutation''' is a [[genetic operator]] used to maintain [[genetic diversity]] from one generation of a population of algorithm [[chromosome (genetic algorithm)|chromosomes]] to the next. It is analogous to biological [[mutation]]. The classic example of a mutation operator involves a probability that an arbitrary [[bit]] in a [[genome (genetic algorithm)|genetic sequence]] will be changed from its original state. A common method of implementing the mutation operator involves generating a [[random variable]] for each bit in a sequence. This random variable tells whether or not a particular bit will be modified. This mutation procedure, based on the biological [[point mutation]], is called single point mutation. Other types are inversion and floating point mutation. When the gene encoding is restrictive as in permutation problems, mutations are swaps, inversions and scrambles. The purpose of mutation in GAs is preserving and introducing diversity. Mutation should allow the algorithm to avoid [[local minimum|local minima]] by preventing the population of chromosomes from becoming too similar to each other, thus slowing or even stopping evolution. This reasoning also explains the fact that most GA systems avoid only taking the [[Fitness function|fittest]] of the population in generating the next but rather a random (or semi-random) selection with a weighting toward those that are fitter. For more details how mutation is used in a genetic algorithm, see the main article on [[genetic algorithm]]s. == Reference == * http://www.obitko.com/tutorials/genetic-algorithms/crossover-mutation.php {{DEFAULTSORT:Mutation (Genetic Algorithm)}} [[Category:Genetic algorithms]]
