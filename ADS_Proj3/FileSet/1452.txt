Apple plans to have iTunes update the DRM coding on videos bought from the iTunes Store automatically by checking the files to see if the coding is up to date. ===Conversion to analog=== There are mainly two other methods to bypass the DRM control. The first method is to burn a copy to an audio CD—either real or virtual—and then [[Ripping|rip]] it. The second method is to use a recording software and sound card, using the so-called "[[analog hole]]", for example, Replay Music which records and also identifies and tags the songs using an audio fingerprinting algorithm. ==Steve Jobs' ''Thoughts on Music'' open letter== On February 6, 2007, [[Steve Jobs]], CEO of Apple Inc., published an open letter entitled ''Thoughts on Music'' on the Apple website calling on the "big four" music companies to sell their music without DRM.<ref name=openletter>{{cite web | url=http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic | title=Thoughts on Music | last=Jobs | first=Steve | date=2007-02-06 | accessdate=2007-06-21}}</ref> According to Jobs, Apple does not want to use DRM but is forced by the four major musical labels with whom Apple negotiates contracts for iTunes. Jobs's main points were: * DRM has never and will never be perfect. Hackers will always find a method to break DRM. * DRM restrictions only hurt people using music legally. Illegal users aren't affected by DRM. * The restrictions of DRM encourage users to obtain unrestricted music which is usually only possible via illegal methods. * The vast majority of music is sold without DRM via CDs which has proven successful. Jobs' letter was met with some praise but many others criticized Apple's hypocritical approach to DRM. While openly criticizing DRM, Apple has been actively threatening or suing anybody trying to open their own DRM or make it interoperable. Critics claim that this is not because Apple is afraid of illegal copies but because it gives them an advantage in their market position as a leader in both electronic music sales (iTunes) and in music players (iPod), reinforcing each other due to the FairPlay DRM.<ref>[http://www.theinquirer.net/en/inquirer/news/2007/02/09/an-open-letter-to-steve-jobs]</ref><ref>[http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=6012]</ref><ref>[http://www.boingboing.net/2006/03/22/apples-hypocritical-.html]</ref><ref>[http://www.kareldonk.com/karel/2007/02/17/drm-in-trouble-and-windows-vista-sales-lacking/]</ref> ===Selected responses to ''Thoughts on Music''=== The essay caused ripples across the music industry, prompting replies from other major players.
