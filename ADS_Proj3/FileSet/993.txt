letters ''unsteckered''. (This continued until January 1939 when the number of leads was increased, leaving only a small number of letters ''unsteckered''.) Other useful shortcomings that were discovered by the British and later the American cryptanalysts included the following, many of which depended on frequent breaking of a particular network: * The practice of re-transmitting a message in an identical, or near-identical, form on different cipher networks. If a message was transmitted using both a low-level cipher that Bletchley Park broke by hand, and Enigma, the decrypt provided an excellent ''crib'' for Enigma decipherment.<ref> Alexander (''c.'' 1945) "Background" Para. 38 </ref> * For machines where there was a choice of more rotors than there were slots for them, a rule on some networks stipulated that no rotor should be in the same slot in the scrambler as it had been for the immediately preceding configuration. This reduced the number of ''wheel orders'' that had to be tried.<ref>Bauer (2007) p. 441 </ref> * Not allowing a ''wheel order'' to be repeated on a monthly setting sheet. This meant that when the keys were being found on a regular basis, economies in excluding possible ''wheel orders'' could be made.<ref>Taunt (1993) p. 108 </ref> * The stipulation, for Air Force operators, that no letter should be connected on the plugboard to its neighbour in the alphabet. This reduced the problem of identifying the plugboard connections and was automated in some Bombes with a Consecutive Stecker Knock-Out (CKSO) device.<ref>Budiansky (2000) p. 240 </ref> * The sloppy practice that [[John Herivel]] anticipated soon after his arrival at Bletchley Park in January 1940. He thought about the practical actions that an Enigma operator would have to make, and the short cuts he might employ. He thought that, after setting the alphabet rings to the prescribed setting, and closing the lid, the operator might not turn the rotors by more than a few places in selecting the first part of the indicator. Initially this did not seem to be the case, but after the changes of May 1940, what became known as the Herivel tip proved to be most useful.<ref>[[Gordon Welchman|Welchman]] (1984) pp. 98-100 </ref><ref>[[John Herivel]], cited by [[Michael Smith (newspaper reporter)|Smith]] (2007) pp. 50-51 </ref><ref name="David Kahn 1991 p. 113"/> * The practice of re-using some of the columns of ''wheel orders'', ring settings or plugboard connections from previous months. The resulting analytical short-cut was christened at Bletchley Park ''Parkerismus'' after Reg Parker, who had, through his meticulous record-keeping, spotted this phenomenon.<ref>[[Gordon Welchman|Welchman]] (1984) pp. 130,131,167 </ref> * The re-use of a permutation in the German Air Force METEO code as the Enigma ''stecker'' permutation for the day.<ref>Bauer (2007) p. 442 </ref> Mavis Lever, a member of [[Dilly Knox|Dilly Knox's]] team, recalled an occasion when there was an extraordinary message. {{blockquote|The one snag with Enigma of course is the fact that if you press ''A'', you can get every other letter but ''A''. I picked up this message and—one was so used to looking at things and making instant decisions&mdash;I thought: 'Something's gone. What has this chap done. There is not a single ''L'' in this message.' My chap had been told to send out a dummy message and he had just had a fag [cigarette] and pressed the last key on the keyboard, the ''L''. So that was the only letter that didn't come out. We had got the biggest crib we ever had, the encypherment was ''LLLL'', right through the message and that gave us the new wiring for the wheel [rotor]. That's the sort of thing we were trained to do. Instinctively look for something that had gone wrong or someone who had done something silly and torn up the rule book.<ref>[[Michael Smith (newspaper reporter)|Smith]] (2007) pp. 59,60</ref> }} Postwar debriefings of German cryptographic specialists, conducted as part of project [[TICOM]], tend to support the view that the Germans were well aware that Enigma was theoretically breakable, but felt that the resources required to mount a pure [[brute-force attack]] on it would be impracticable. To the war's end, the Germans continued making improvements to the system, though they considered it to be, for all practical purposes, unbreakable. ===Crib-based decryption=== The term ''[[Known-plaintext attack|crib]]'' was used at [[Bletchley Park]] to denote any ''[[known plaintext]]'' or ''suspected plaintext'' at some point in an enciphered message. This cryptanalytic approach was thus a ''[[chosen-plaintext attack]]''. Britain's Government Code and Cipher School (GCCS), before its move to Bletchley Park, had realized the value of recruiting mathematicians and logicians to work in codebreaking teams. [[Alan Turing]], a [[Cambridge University]] mathematician with an interest in cryptology and in machines for implementing logical operations—and who was regarded by many as a genius—had started work for GCCS on a part-time basis from about the time of the [[Munich Agreement|Munich Crisis]] in 1938.<ref> {{ Citation | last = Hodges | first = Andrew | author-link = Andrew Hodges | year = 1995 | title = Part 4: The Second World War | series = Alan Turing: a short biography | url = http://www.turing.org.uk/bio/part4.html | accessdate = 23 October 2008 }} </ref> [[Gordon Welchman]], another Cambridge mathematician, had also received initial training in 1938,<ref>[[Gordon Welchman|Welchman]] (1984) p. 11 </ref> and they both reported to Bletchley Park on 4 September 1939, the day after Britain declared war on Germany. Much of the Polish success had relied on the repetition within the indicator. But as soon as Turing moved to Bletchley Park—where he initially joined [[Dilly Knox]] in the research section—he set about seeking methods that did not rely on this weakness, as they correctly anticipated that the German Army and Air Force might follow the German Navy in improving their indicator system. The Poles had used an early form of crib-based decryption in the days when only six leads were used on the plugboard.<ref name = MahonP13 /> The technique became known as the ''Forty Weepy Weepy'' method for the following reason. When a message was a continuation of a previous one, the plaintext would
