a Thousand Things,'' the author notes that, in the war, Japanese spies would often approach checkpoints posing as American or [[Filipino people|Filipino]] military personnel. A shibboleth such as "lollapalooza" would be used by the sentry, who, if the first two syllables come back as ''rorra,'' would "open fire without waiting to hear the remainder".<ref>{{cite book|year=1946|title=A Book about a Thousand Things|author=Stimpson, George W.|publisher=Harper & Brothers|pages=51}}</ref> Prior to the [[Battle of the Golden Spurs|Guldensporenslag]], the Flemish [[Bruges Matins (history)|slaughtered]] every Frenchman they could find in the city of Bruges. They are said to have identified Frenchmen based on their inability to pronounce the Dutch phrase "Schild ende Vriend" ("Shield and Friend"), or possibly "'s Gilden vriend" ("Friend of the Guilds"). ''Bûter, brea, en griene tsiis; wa't dat net sizze kin, is gjin oprjochte Fries'' ({{audio|Schibbolet-fries.ogg|example}}) means "Butter, rye bread and green cheese, who cannot say that is not a genuine Frisian" was used by the [[Frisians|Frisian]] [[Pier Gerlofs Donia]] during a [[Frisian rebellion]] ([[1515]]-[[1523]]).

In this scheduling [[algorithm]], the [[Process (computing)|process]] with the smallest amount of time remaining until completion is selected to execute. Since the currently executing process is the one with the shortest amount of time remaining by definition, and since that time should only reduce as execution progresses, processes will always run until they complete or a new process is added that requires a smaller amount of time. Shortest remaining time is advantageous because short processes are handled very quickly. The system also requires very little overhead since it only makes a decision when a process completes or a new process is added, and when a new process is added the algorithm only needs to compare the currently executing process with the new process, ignoring all other processes currently waiting to execute. However, it has the potential for [[starvation (computing)|process starvation]] for processes which will require a long time to complete if short processes are continually added, though this threat can be minimal when process times follow a heavy-tailed distribution. [http://portal.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=762486&type=pdf&coll=ACM&dl=ACM&CFID=70737957&CFTOKEN=89892650] Like shortest job next scheduling, shortest remaining time scheduling is rarely used outside of specialized environments because it requires accurate estimations of the runtime of all processes that are waiting to execute. It doesn't use RR if two processes are of the same length because of overhead space. ==See also== *[[Scheduling (computing)]] [[Category:Scheduling algorithms]] [[de:Prozess-Scheduler#Strategien]] [[et:Shortest Remaining Time Next]] [[fr:Short Remaining Time]]</text> </page> <page> <id>34276</id> <title>Shred (Unix)</title> <text>{{lowercase|title=shred (Unix)}} <tt>'''shred'''</tt> is a [[Unix]] command that can be used to [[Data remanence|securely delete]] files and devices so that they can be recovered only with great difficulty with specialised hardware, if at all{{ref|1|1}}. It is a part of [[GNU Core Utilities]]. ==Background== For efficiency, erasing a file usually only erases the file system entry and keeps the content of the file intact. This frequently allows the file to be recovered using commonly available software. Even if the file is overwritten, residual magnetic fields may allow data recovery using specialist hardware equipment{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. To prevent this, shred overwrites the file multiple times using patterns chosen to maximize destruction of the residual data. The articles ''[[data erasure]]'' and ''[[data remanence]]'' have additional information. ==Features== <tt>shred</tt> can be invoked either on ordinary files or on devices (such as hard disk partitions), which are represented as files in Unix. By default, shred overwrites the file 25 times with multiple patterns, but the number is user configurable. Shred has an option to do an additional final overwrite with zeroes, which may help to hide the fact that shred was used. By default, shred also shreds ''[[Fragmentation_(computer)#Internal_fragmentation|file slack]]'' (unused space in file allocations). For example, a 5 KB file on a file system with 4 KB clusters actually requires 8 KB of storage. Shred has an option to overwrite only the file itself, as well as an option to delete the file after it has completed operation. ==Limitations== A limitation of shred is that it only overwrites the data in place without overwriting other copies of the file. Copies can manifest themselves in a variety of ways, such as through manual and automatic backups, file system snapshots, copy-on-write filesystems, [[wear leveling]] on [[Solid-state drive|flash drive]]s, caching such as [[Network file system|NFS]] caching, and [[Journaling file system|journaling]]. Some of these limitations can be overcome by shredding the entire device instead of specific files. ==See also== * [[GNU]] * [[Free software]] ==References== * [http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/shred-invocation.html shred invocation], GNU Coreutils.
