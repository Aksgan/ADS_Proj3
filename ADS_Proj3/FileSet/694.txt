animanga character | name = Freya | series = Chobits | image = [[File:Freya (Chobits).jpg|230px]] | caption = Freya, as seen in the anime | first = Manga: Chobits Volume Two<br />Anime: Chii Works | creator = [[Clamp (manga artists)|Clamp]] | voiced by = [[Rie Tanaka]] (Japan)<br />[[Michelle Ruff]] (Dub) }} Freya was the first Chobit and the older twin of Elda, created by Ichiro Mihara to be Hibiya's daughter, because she was unable to bear children of her own. She lived happily with the Mihara couple for a time until Hibiya noticed that her attitude was becoming increasingly melancholy. Hibiya asked her husband to build a little sister for Freya in an attempt to make her happy again; from this request, Elda was created. Freya was happy to have a little sister, and for a time, seemed to be acting normally. Some time after, Freya suddenly lost consciousness and collapsed to the ground. It was only then that Hibiya finally realized the source of Freya's sadness; she had fallen in love with her own father, Mihara. Freya knew that her father still loved his wife, and did not want to disturb their happiness, so she pained her heart with efforts to suppress her feelings. Over time, her pain became so great that she began to malfunction under the strain of her emotional burden. Freya was no longer able to move, and was bedridden from that point on. In the anime, Freya never found the courage to tell her father how she truly felt; in the manga, she resigns herself to the fact that because of the damage to her body, all hope is lost regardless of the outcome. After reaching this decision, she chose to tell him of her true feelings. Eventually Freya's pain became so unbearable that she chose to self-terminate, rather than continue to exist. Before this could happen, Elda offered to take Freya's heart into her own so that she would not disappear completely, and so that her memories would be preserved. Now that Elda has become Chi, Freya does everything she can to ensure that Chi will find the person just for her. Freya comforts Chi when she is in distress, guides her to understand her feelings for Hideki, and intervenes when she is in danger. ==In other media== ===Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle=== Chi makes several appearances in [[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]. In this crossover series, she is created by [[Fay D. Flourite]] as a guardian of the pool where his brother's body (and eventually the sealed Ashura-ou) are kept. Fay modeled Chi after his memories of his mother. She was created using one of [[Sakura (Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle)|Princess Sakura's]] feathers, and eventually disintegrates after the feather is removed and given back to Sakura. Another version of Chi appears in episode 32 of the anime as the Queen of a world, and has placed the world into a never-ending night. She is voiced in the [[anime]] version by [[Kaori Nazuka]] (Japanese version) and by [[Trina Nishimura]] (English version). ==See also== *[[Chobits]] *[[List of Chobits characters]] ==References== <!--See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref> and </ref> tags and the tag below --> {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.tbs.co.jp/chobits/index-j.html Official Chobits website] (Japanese) [[Category:Chobits]] [[Category:Fictional robots]] [[Category:Fictional dolls and dummies]] [[Category:Clamp characters]] [[es:Chii]] [[fr:Chobits#Personnages]] [[it:Chii]] [[pl:Chii]] [[pt:Chii]]</text> </page> <page> <id>6081</id> <title>Chief information officer</title> <text>{{Refimprove|date=January 2008}} {{Cleanup|date=November 2008}} The '''chief information officer''' ('''CIO'''), or '''information technology''' ('''IT''') '''director''', is a job title commonly given to the most senior executive in an enterprise responsible for the [[information technology]] and computer systems that support enterprise goals. The CIO typically reports to the [[chief executive officer]], [[chief operations officer]] or [[chief financial officer]]. In military organizations, they report to the [[commanding officer]]. ==CIO== [[Information technology]] and its systems have become so important that CIO has come to be viewed in many organizations as the key contributor in formulating [[strategic]] goals for an organization. The CIO manages the implementation of the useful technology to increase information accessibility and integrated systems management. As a comparison, where the CIO adapts systems through the use of existing technologies, [[chief technology officer]] develops new technologies to expand corporate technological capabilities. When both positions are present in an organization, the CIO is generally responsible for processes and practices supporting the flow of information, whereas the [[Chief Technology Officer|CTO]] is generally responsible for [[technology infrastructure]]. ''CIO'' magazine's "State of the CIO 2008" survey asked 558 IT leaders who they report to. The results were: [[CEO]] (41%), [[CFO]] (23%), [[Chief operating officer|COO]] (16%), Corporate CIO (7%) and Other (13%).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cio.com/article/147950/_State_of_the_CIO_2008_Data_Shows_CIO_Salaries_Influence_Rising |title=State of the CIO 2008 Data Shows CIO Salaries, Influence Rising |publisher=CIO |accessdate=27 February 2010 }}</ref> ==Information technology== The prominence of the CIO position has risen greatly as [[information technology]] has become a more important part of business. The CIO may be a member of the executive board of an organization. No specific qualification are intrinsic of the CIO position, though the typical candidate may have expertise in a number of technological fields - [[computer science]], [[software engineering]], or [[information systems]]. Many candidates have [[Master of Business Administration]] or [[Master of Science in Management]] degrees.<ref>[http://www.cio.com/article/122507/Should_You_Get_an_MBA_ Should You Get an MBA? - CIO.com - Business Technology Leadership<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. More recently CIOs' leadership capabilities, business acumen and strategic perspectives have taken precedence over technical skills. It is now quite common for CIOs to be appointed from the business side of the organization, especially if they have [[project management]] skills. In 2007 a survey amongst CIOs by ''CIO'' magazine in the UK discovered that their top 10 concerns were: [[people leadership]], [[managing budgets]], [[business alignment]], infrastructure refresh, security, [[compliance (regulation)|compliance]], [[resource management]], managing customers, [[managing change]] and board politics<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.cio.co.uk/concern/budgets/features/index.cfm?articleid=351 Granger: The final word - CIO UK Magazine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. Typically, a CIO is involved with analyzing and reworking existing business processes, with identifying and developing the capability to use new tools, with reshaping the enterprise's physical infrastructure and network access, and with identifying
