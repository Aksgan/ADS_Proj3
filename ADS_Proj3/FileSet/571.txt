The technical development of COPERT is financed by the [[European Environment Agency]] (EEA), in the framework of the activities of the European Topic Centre on Air and Climate Change. Since 2007, the European Commission's [[Joint Research Centre]] has been coordinating the further scientific development of the model. In principle, COPERT has been developed for use from the National Experts to estimate emissions from road transport to be included in official annual national inventories. However, it is available and free for use in any other research, scientific and academic applications. The COPERT 4 methodology is also part of the EMEP/CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook. The Guidebook, developed by the UNECE Task Force on Emissions Inventories and Projections, is intended to support reporting under the UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary [[Air Pollution]] and the EU directive on national emission ceilings. The COPERT 4 methodology is fully consistent with the [[Road Transport]] chapter of the Guidebook. The use of a software tool to calculate road transport emissions allows for a transparent and standardized, hence consistent and comparable data collecting and emissions reporting procedure, in accordance with the requirements of international conventions and protocols and EU legislation. == Features == * Calculation of [[Air pollution|Emissions]] from [[Road Transport]] * Compilation of an emission inventory * Calculation for different vehicle categories (passenger cars, light duty vehicles, heavy duty vehicles, mopeds and motorcycles) * Pollutants covered: ** major air pollutants ([[Carbon monoxide|CO]], [[NOx]], [[Volatile organic compound|VOC]], [[Particulate matter|PM]], [[ammonia|NH<sub>3</sub>]], [[Sulfur dioxide|SO<sub>2</sub>]], [[heavy metals]]) ** [[greenhouse gas]] [[Greenhouse gas#Greenhouse gas emissions|emissions]] ([[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]], [[nitrous oxide|N<sub>2</sub>O]], [[methane|CH<sub>4</sub>]]) ==History== * COPERT 4 version 6.1 - February 2009 * COPERT 4 version 6.0 - December 2008 * COPERT 4 version 5.1 - February 2008 * COPERT 4 Version 5.0 - December 2007 * COPERT 4 Version 4.0 - October 2007 * COPERT 4 Version 3.0 - November 2006 * COPERT 4 Beta Version 2.0.0 - July 2006 * COPERT 4 Beta Version 1.4 - March 2006 * COPERT 4 Beta Version 1.0 - Dec 2005 * COPERT III Final Version 2.3 - July 2002 == See also == * [[Emission Inventory]] == Notes == * [http://lat.eng.auth.gr/copert/docs2.htm COPERT Documentation] == External links == * [http://lat.eng.auth.gr/copert/ COPERT 4] * [http://www.eea.europa.eu/ European Environment Agency - EEA] * [http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/jrc/index.cfm Joint Research Centre - JRC] * [http://www.eea.europa.eu/emep-eea-guidebook EMEP/CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook - 2009] * [http://www.tfeip-secretariat.org/ Task Force on Emission Inventories and Projections - TFEIP] [[Category:Windows software]]</text> </page> <page> <id>5151</id> <title>COPS (software)</title> <text>{{About|the [[software]]|the governing body "Conference of the Parties"|COP16}} '''COPS''' was the first common [[Unix]] computer system security scanning tool, created by [[Dan Farmer]]; [[Gene Spafford]] helped him start it in 1989 while Dan was in summer school at [[Purdue University]]. ==Features== COPS(Computer Oracle and Password System) integrates around 12 small security check programs which review the security state of the system it is run on. These programs look for (from the COPS README.1 file): * file, directory, and device permissions/nodes * poor passwords * content, format, and security of password and group files * programs and files run in /etc/rc* and cron(tab) files * existence of root-SUID files, their writability, and whether they are shell scripts * a CRC check against important binaries or key files * writability of users home directories and startup files * anonymous ftp setup * unrestricted tftp, decode alias in sendmail, SUID uudecode problems, hidden shells inside inetd.conf, rexd in inetd.conf * miscellaneous root checks -- current directory in the search path, a "+" in the /etc/host.equiv file, unrestricted NFS mounts, ensuring root is in /etc/ftpusers * checking dates of CERT advisories vs. key files. * the Kuang expert system COPS was the forerunner of the [[Security Administrator Tool for Analyzing Networks|SATAN]] network security scan tool. COPS is generally considered obsolete, but it is not uncommon to find systems which are set up in an insecure manner that COPS will identify. ==See also== *[[Dan Farmer]] *[[Gene Spafford]] *[[Security Administrator Tool for Analyzing Networks|SATAN]] ==External links== *[ftp://coast.cs.purdue.edu/pub/tools/unix/scanners/cops/ The COPS program] *[http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/farmer92cops.html Citeseer entry for the COPS Usenix paper] [[Category:Computer security software]] {{security-software-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>5154</id> <title>CORSIKA</title> <text>{{otheruses|Corsica}} {{Infobox Software | name = CORSIKA,<br />an Extensive Air Shower Simulation Program | logo = | screenshot = | caption = | author = [[Tanguy Pierog]], [[Dieter Heck]],
