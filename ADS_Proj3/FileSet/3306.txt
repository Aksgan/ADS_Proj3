leading chip-manufacturers, database providers, national laboratories, network equipment manufacturers, server & storage vendors, software companies, workstation manufacturers, and more. ==History == Founded in June 2004 as the OpenIB Alliance, the organization originally focused on developing a standardized, Linux-based InfiniBand software stack. Initial funding for the Alliance was provided by the U.S. Department of Energy. In 2005 the OpenIB Alliance committed itself to supporting Microsoft Windows, a move that would make the Alliance's software stack truly cross-platform. And in 2006, the organization again expanded its charter to include support for iWARP, which is a transport technology that competes with InfiniBand. It was at this time that the OpenIB Alliance changed its name to the OpenFabrics Alliance. The OpenIB Alliance released the first version of the OpenFabrics software stack, known as OFED (OpenFabrics Enterprise Distribution) in 2005. It supported InfiniBand and ran on Linux. Subsequent releases have added support for iWARP and Windows. OFED-1.5.2 is the latest stable release of the OpenFabrics software stack. == OpenFabrics Enterprise Distribution== A community of developers from hardware manufacturers, software vendors, system integrators, government agencies and academia {{As of|2008 |alt=continue}} to work on OFED. The OpenFabrics Alliance provides architectures, software repositories, interoperability tests, bug databases, workshops, and BSD- and GPL-licensed code to facilitate development. The OFED stack includes [[Device driver | software driver]]s, core kernel-code, middleware, and user-level interfaces. It offers a range of standard protocols, including IPoIB (IP over [[InfiniBand]]<ref> {{cite web | url = http://techpubs.sgi.com/library/tpl/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?coll=linux&db=bks&srch=&fname=/SGI_Admin/NASMGR_UG/sgi_html/go01.html | title = Glossary | accessdate = 2008-10-01 | author = | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2008-07-19 | work = SGI InfiniteStorage Appliance Manager User's Guide | publisher = SGI | location = | pages = | doi = | quote = }} </ref>), SDP, SRP, iSER, RDS and DAPL (the Direct Access Programming Library). It also supports many other protocols, including various MPI implementations, and it supports many file systems, including Lustre and NFS over RDMA. ==Interoperability testing == On June 25, 2007, the OpenFabrics Alliance announced the OFA-UNH-IOL Logo Program in partnership with the [[University of New Hampshire InterOperability Laboratory]]. The program enables manufacturers of InfiniBand and iWARP products to test and certify that their products support the OpenFabrics software stack, and test the compatibility of their software and hardware with other products that have earned the OFA-UNH-IOL logo. The OpenFabrics Alliance sponsors multiple interoperability events at the [[University of New Hampshire]] each year, providing vendors with ongoing opportunities to earn the OFA-UNH-IOL logo for their products. The test scenarios are available to the public, as are the test results for all products that earn the logo. During interoperability events, all participating companies have the opportunity to observe all tests run on all products. == Current members== Corporate members of the OpenFabrics Alliance include [[Advanced Micro Devices]], [[Appro]], [[Chelsio Communications]], [[Cisco Systems]], [[Data Direct Networks]], [[Flextronics]], [[Hewlett Packard]], [[IBM]], [[Intel]], [[LSI Corporation]], [[Mellanox Technologies]], [[NetEffect]], [[Neterion]], [[NetApp]], [[NetXen]], [[Oracle Corporation]], [[QLogic]], [[Silicon Graphics]], [[Sun Microsystems]], [[System Fabric Works]], [[Voltaire]], and [[Xsigo Systems]].

Functions performed include window definition, window control, and monitoring of [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] and [[Computer mouse|mouse]] input. Routines for drawing a number of geometric primitives (both in solid and wireframe mode) are also provided, including [[cube (geometry)|cubes]], [[sphere]]s, and the [[Utah teapot]]. GLUT even has some limited support for creating pop-up menus. GLUT was written by [[Mark Kilgard|Mark J. Kilgard]], author of ''OpenGL Programming for the X Window System'' and ''The Cg Tutorial: The Definitive Guide to Programmable Real-Time Graphics'', while he was working for [[Silicon Graphics]] Inc. The two aims of GLUT are to allow the creation of rather portable code between operating systems (GLUT is [[cross-platform]]) and to make learning OpenGL easier. Getting started with OpenGL programming while using GLUT often takes only a few lines of code and does not require knowledge of operating systemâ€“specific windowing [[application programming interface|APIs]]. All GLUT functions start with the <code>glut</code> prefix (for example, <code>glutPostRedisplay</code> marks the current window as needing to be redrawn). == Implementations == The original GLUT library by Mark Kilgard supports the [[X Window System]] ([[GLX]]) and was ported to [[Microsoft Windows]] ([[WGL (software)|WGL]]) by [[Nate Robins]]. Additionally, [[Mac OS X]] ships with a GLUT framework that supports its own NSGL/[[Core OpenGL|CGL]]. Kilgard's GLUT library is no longer maintained,
