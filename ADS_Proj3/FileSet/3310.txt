OpenSolaris can be installed from [[CD-ROM]], [[USB]] drives, or over a network with the Automated Installer.<ref>[http://dlc.sun.com/osol/docs/content/dev/AIinstall/ OpenSolaris 2010.03 Automated Installer Guide]</ref> CD, USB, and network install images are made available for both types of releases.<ref>[http://www.genunix.org/ OpenSolaris distributions and development releases]</ref> ===Repositories=== OpenSolaris uses a network-aware [[package management system]] called the ''[[Image Packaging System]]'' (also known as pkg(5)) to add, remove, and manage installed software and to update to newer releases.
