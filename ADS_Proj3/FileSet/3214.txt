are also Scrivener notaries, who get their name from the [[Worshipful Company of Scriveners|Scriveners' Company]]; until 1999, when they lost this monopoly, they were the only notaries permitted to practise in the [[City of London]]. They used not to have to first qualify as solicitors, but they had knowledge of foreign laws and languages. Currently to qualify as a Notary Public in England and Wales it is necessary to have earned a law degree or qualified as a solicitor or barrister in the past five years, and then to take a two-year distance-learning course styled the Postgraduate Diploma in Notarial Practice from the University of Cambridge. At the same time, any applicant must also gain practical experience, which would usually be with a solicitor notary. The few who go on to become Scrivener Notaries require further study of a foreign language and foreign law and a two-year mentorship under an active Scrivener notary. The other notaries in England are either ecclesiastical notaries whose functions are limited to the affairs of the [[Church of England]] or other qualified persons who are not trained as solicitors or [[barrister]]s but satisfy the [[Master of the Faculties]] of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] that they possess an adequate understanding of the law. Both the latter two categories are required to pass examinations set by the Master of Faculties. The regulation of notaries was modernized in the 1990s as a result of section 57 of the [[Courts and Legal Services Act 1990]]. Notarial services generally include: * attesting the signature and execution of documents * authenticating the execution of documents * authenticating the contents of documents * administration of oaths and declarations * drawing up or noting (and extending) protests of happenings to ships, crews and cargoes * presenting bills of exchange for acceptance and payment, noting and protesting bills in cases of dishonour and preparing acts of honour * attending upon the drawing up of bonds * drawing mercantile documents, deeds, sales or purchases of property, and wills in English and (via translation), in foreign languages for use in Britain, the Commonwealth and other foreign countries * providing documents to deal with the administration of the estate of people who are abroad, or owning property abroad * authenticating personal documents and information for immigration or emigration purposes, or to apply to marry, divorce, adopt children<ref>http://www.lancashirenotary.co.uk/work.html</ref> or to work abroad * verification of translations from foreign languages to English and vice versa * taking evidence in England and Wales as a Commissioner for Oaths for foreign courts * provision of Notarial copies * preparing and witnessing powers of attorney, corporate records, contracts for use in Britain or overseas * authenticating company and business documents and transactions * international domain name transfers ====Scotland==== Notaries public have existed in Scotland since the 13th century and developed as a distinct element of the Scottish legal profession. Those who wish to practice as a notary must petition the [[Court of Session]]. This petition is usually presented at the same time as a petition to practice as a solicitor, but can sometimes be earlier or later. However, to qualify, a notary must hold a current Practising Certificate from the [[Law Society of Scotland]], a new requirement from 2007, before which all Scottish solicitors were automatically notaries. Whilst notaries in Scotland are always solicitors, the profession remains separate in that there are additional rules and regulations governing notaries and it is possible to be a solicitor, but not a notary. Since 2007 an additional Practising Certificate is required, so now most, but not all, solicitors in Scotland are notaries - a significant difference from the English profession. They are also separate from notaries in other [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]s of the United Kingdom.<ref>[http://www.lawscot.org.uk/Members_Information/rules_and_guidance/guides/Rules/notarypublic/notary_public.aspx Law Society of Scotland]</ref> The profession is administered by the Council of the Law Society of Scotland under the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1990. In Scotland, the duties and services provided by the Notary are similar to England and Wales, although they are needed for some declarations in divorce matters for which they are not in England. Their role declined following the Law Agents (Scotland) Amendment Act 1896 which stipulated only enrolled law agents could become notaries and the Conveyancing (Scotland) Act 1924 which extended notarial execution to law agents.

Since the notary is a state officer, a notary's duties may vary widely from state to state and in most cases bars a notary from acting outside his or her home state unless they also have a commission there as well. In 32 states the main requirements are to fill out a form and pay a fee; many states have restrictions concerning notaries with criminal histories, but the requirements vary from state to state. Notaries in 18 states and the District of Columbia are required to take a course, pass an exam, or both; the education or exam requirements in Delaware and Kansas only apply to notaries who will perform electronic notarizations.<ref>[http://www.nass.org/ ''Issues and Trends in State Notary Regulation''].
