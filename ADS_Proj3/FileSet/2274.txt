was to minimum-weight (or maximum-weight) perfect matchings in a graph. Each edge is assigned a random weight in {1, …, 2''m''}, and <math>\mathcal F</math> is the set of perfect matchings, so that with probability at least 1/2, there exists a unique perfect matching. When each indeterminate <math>x_{ij}</math> in the [[Tutte matrix]] of the graph is replaced with <math>2^{w_{ij}}</math> where <math>w_{ij}</math> is the random weight of the edge, we can show that the determinant of the matrix is nonzero, and further use this to find the matching. * More generally, the paper also observed that any search problem of the form "Given a set system <math>(S,\mathcal F)</math>, find a set in <math>\mathcal F</math>" could be reduced to a decision problem of the form "Is there a set in <math>\mathcal F</math> with total weight at most ''k''?". For instance, it showed how to solve the following problem posed by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis, for which (as of the time the paper was written) no deterministic polynomial-time algorithm is known: given a graph and a subset of the edges marked as "red", find a perfect matching with exactly ''k'' red edges. * The [[Valiant–Vazirani theorem]], concerning unique solutions to NP-complete problems, has a simpler proof using the isolation lemma. This is proved by giving a randomized reduction from [[Clique problem|CLIQUE]] to UNIQUE-CLIQUE. * [[Avi Wigderson]] used the isolation lemma in 1994 to give a randomized reduction from [[NL (complexity)|NL]] to UL, and thereby prove that NL/poly ⊆ ⊕L/poly.<ref>{{Cite conference| last = Wigderson| first = Avi | title = NL/poly ⊆ ⊕L/poly | url = http://www.math.ias.edu/~avi/PUBLICATIONS/MYPAPERS/W94/proc.pdf | date = July 1994 | conference = Proceedings of the 9th Structures in Complexity Conference | pages = 59–62}}</ref> Reinhardt and Allender later used the isolation lemma again to prove that NL/poly = UL/poly.<ref>{{Cite journal | volume = 29 | pages = 1118 | last = Reinhardt | first = K. | coauthors = E.

In the [[Euclidean space]], the [[isoperimetry|isoperimetric inequality]] says that of all bodies with the same volume, the ball has the smallest surface area. In other manifolds it is usually very difficult to find the precise body minimizing the surface area, and this is not what the isoperimetric dimension is about. The question we will ask is, what is ''approximately'' the minimal surface area, whatever the body realizing it might be. ==Formal definition== We say about a manifold ''M'' that it satisfies a ''d''-dimensional '''isoperimetric inequality''' if for any open set ''D'' in ''M'' with a smooth boundary one has :<math>\mathrm{area}\,(\partial D)\geq C\,\mathrm{vol}\,(D)^{(d-1)/d}.\,</math> The notations vol and area refer to the regular notions of volume and surface area on the manifold, or more precisely, if the manifold has ''n'' topological dimensions then vol refers to ''n''-dimensional volume and area refers to (''n'' &minus; 1)-dimensional volume. ''C'' here refers to some constant, which does not depend on ''D'' (it may depend on the manifold and on ''d''). The '''isoperimetric dimension''' of ''M'' is the supremum of all values of ''d'' such that ''M'' satisfies a ''d''-dimensional isoperimetric inequality. ==Examples== A ''d''-dimensional Euclidean space has isoperimetric dimension ''d''. This is the well known [[isoperimetry|isoperimetric problem]] &mdash; as discussed above, for the Euclidean space the constant ''C'' is known precisely since the minimum is achieved for the ball. An infinite cylinder (i.e. a [[cartesian product|product]] of the [[unit circle|circle]] and the [[real line|line]]) has topological dimension 2 but isoperimetric dimension 1. Indeed, multiplying any manifold with a compact manifold does not change the isoperimetric dimension (it only changes the value of the constant ''C'').
