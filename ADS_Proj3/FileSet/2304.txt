and [[Extraction]]. His main topic of research is [[Natural language processing]]. Pustejovsky proposed [[Generative Lexicon]] theory in [[lexical semantics]]. His other interests include [[Time|temporal]] reasoning, events, [[information extraction]], [[computational linguistics]]. == Current research == Pustejovsky's research group's current projects include the [[TimeML]] and Medstract projects. The TimeML project is attempting to create a standard [[markup language]] for [[Time|temporal]] events in a document. The Medstract project attempts to extract information from [[medical]] documents using current [[natural language processing]] technology. ==External links== * [http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~jamesp Professor Pustejovsky's website] * [http://www.brandeis.edu/facguide/person.html?emplid=dbbe2e6922a901a7151b3d83b6618450867207ae/ Brandeis University Faulty Guide] * [http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~jamesp/books/mit-gl.html Pustejovsky's book on the Generative Lexicon] * [http://www.timeml.org The TimeML project] * [http://www.medstract.org/ The Medstract project] {{DEFAULTSORT:Pustejovsky, James}} [[Category:Brandeis University faculty]] [[Category:American computer scientists]] [[Category:American linguists]] [[Category:Computational linguistics researchers]] [[Category:Living people]] [[fr:James Pustejovsky]] [[ja:ジェームズ・プステヨフスキー]]</text> </page> <page> <id>19682</id> <title>James Smith (ichthyologist)</title> <text>{{Refimprove|date=May 2009}} '''James Leonard Brierley Smith''' (26 October 1897{{ndash}}7 January 1968) was a [[South Africa]]n [[ichthyology|ichthyologist]]. He was the first to identify a taxidermied fish as a [[coelacanth]], at the time thought long extinct. ==Early life== Born in [[Graaff Reinet]], Smith obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in Chemistry from the [[University of the Cape of Good Hope]] in 1916 and an [[Master of Science|MSc]] degree in Chemistry at [[Stellenbosch University]] in 1918. Smith went to the [[United Kingdom]], were he received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] at [[Cambridge University]] in 1922. After returning to South Africa, he became Senior Lecturer and later on an Associate Professor of Organic Chemistry at [[Rhodes University]] in [[Grahamstown]]. Here he met his second wife Margaret Mary McDonald. His interest in ichthyology was sparked in childhood during a vacation in [[Knysna]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Clymer|first=Eleanor|title=Search for a Living Fossil|publisher=Scholastic|date=1966|page=15}}</ref> ==Discovery of the coelacanth== In 1938 Smith was informed of the discovery of an unusual and unidentified fish by [[Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer]], curator of the [[East London, South Africa|East London]] Museum. When he arrived in East London in February 1939, he was able to identify it immediately as a [[coelacanth]], which was then thought to have been extinct for over 65 million years, and he named the species ''Latimeria'' after her. He was instrumental in organising the search which provided science with the second specimen of the species 14 years later. Smith and his wife Margaret worked jointly on the popular ''Sea Fishes of South Africa'', which was first published in 1949, followed by other writings until 1968. Among these were over 500 papers on fish and the naming of some 370 new fish species. ==Death and legacy== Smith took his own life in 1968 by [[cyanide]] poisoning, following a long illness.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1097925/Curse-fish-time-forgot-Believed-extinct-65million-years--returned-chilling-consequences.html|title=Curse of the fish that time forgot: Believed to be extinct for 65million years - it returned with chilling consequences|last=Weinberg|first=Samantha|date=19 December 2008|accessdate=2 May 2009}}</ref> His widow Margaret founded the [[South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity|Institute of Ichthyology]] in Grahamstown.

Zawinski''' (born November 3, 1968<ref>{{cite web | url = http://jwz.livejournal.com/profile | title = jwz User Profile | last = Zawinski | first = Jamie}}</ref> in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]), commonly known as '''jwz''', is a former professional [[United States|American]] computer [[programmer]] responsible for significant contributions to the [[free software]] projects [[Mozilla]] and [[XEmacs]], and early versions of the [[Netscape Navigator]] web browser. He maintains the [[XScreenSaver]] project which provides [[screensaver|screenblanking]] for [[Unix-like]] computer [[operating system]]s using the [[X Window System]]. Zawinski is currently the [[ownership#In_person|proprietor]] of the [[DNA Lounge]], a [[nightclub]] in [[San Francisco]]. ==Biography== Zawinski's early career included stints with [[Scott Fahlman]]'s Lisp research group at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Expert Technologies, Inc.]] and Robert Wilensky and [[Peter Norvig]]'s group at Berkeley. In the early 1990s, he was hired by [[Richard P. Gabriel]]'s [[Lucid Inc.]] where he was eventually put to work on Lucid's Energize [[C++]] [[Integrated Development Environment|IDE]]. Lucid decided to use [[GNU Emacs]] as the text editor for their IDE due to its free license, popularity, and extensibility. Zawinski and the other programmers made fundamental changes to GNU Emacs to add new functionality. Tensions over how to merge these patches into the main tree eventually led to the [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of the project into GNU Emacs and [[XEmacs]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Zawinski | first = Jamie | title = The Lemacs/FSFmacs Schism. | date = February 11, 2000 | url = http://www.jwz.org/doc/lemacs.html | accessdate = December 12, 2009 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5lyRUxhVp | archivedate = December 12, 2009}}</ref> Zawinski worked on the early releases of [[Netscape Navigator]], particularly the 1.0 release of the [[Unix]] version. He became quite well known in the early days of the [[world wide web]] through an [[easter egg (virtual)|easter egg]] in the Netscape browser: typing "about:jwz" into the address box would take the user to his home page (a similar trick worked for other Netscape staffers). In addition, Zawinski says he created the name "Mozilla".<ref>{{cite web | last = Zawinski | first = Jamie | title = nscp dorm | year
