map high-dimensional data onto a low-dimensional [[Euclidean]] [[vector space]]. Maximum variance Unfolding is a member of the [[manifold learning]] family, which also include algorithms such as [[isomap]] and [[locally linear embedding]]. In manifold learning, the input data is assumed to be sampled from a low dimensional [[manifold]] that is embedded inside of a higher dimensional vector space. The main intuition behind MVU is to exploit the local linearity of manifolds and create a mapping that preserves local neighborhoods at every point of the underlying manifold. MVU creates a mapping from the high dimensional input vectors to some low dimensional Euclidean vector space in the following three steps: # A [[neighborhood (graph theory)|neighborhood]] graph is created. Each input is connected with its k-nearest input vectors (according to Euclidean distance metric) and all k-nearest neighbors are connected with each other. If the data is sampled well enough, the resulting graph is a discrete approximation of the underlying manifold. # The neighborhood graph is "unfolded" with the help of semidefinite programming. Instead of learning the output vectors directly, the semidefinite programming aims to find an inner product matrix that maximizes the pairwise distances between any two inputs that are not connected in the neighborhood graph. # The low-dimensional embedding is finally obtained by application of [[multidimensional scaling]] on the learned inner product matrix. The steps of applying semidefinite programming followed by a linear dimensionality reduction step to recover a low-dimensional embedding into a Euclidean space were first proposed by Linial, London, and Rabinovich in a now classical article (see below). <!-- [[Image:Swissroll.jpg|500ex|caption]]--> ==See also== * [[Locally linear embedding]] ==External links== *[http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi%3farticle=1000%26context=cis_papers Unsupervised learning of image manifolds by semidefinite programming] K.

The terminology conveys the idea that the elements of the semigroup are ''acting'' as transformations of the set. From an [[algebraic structure|algebraic]] perspective, a semigroup action is a generalization of the notion of a [[group action]] in [[group (mathematics)|group theory]]. From the computer science point of view, semigroup actions are closely related to [[finite state machine|automata]]: the set models the state of the automaton and the action models transformations of that state in response to inputs. An important special case is a '''monoid action''' or '''act''', in which the semigroup is a [[monoid]] and the [[identity element]] of the monoid acts as the [[identity transformation]] of a set. From a [[category theoretic]] point of view, a monoid is a [[category (mathematics)|category]] with one object, and an act is a functor from that category to the [[category of sets]]. This immediately provides a generalization to monoid acts on objects in categories other than the category of sets. Another important special case is a '''[[transformation semigroup]]'''. This is a semigroup of transformations of a set, and hence it has a tautological action of on that set. This concept is linked to the more general notion of a semigroup by an analogue of [[Cayley's theorem]]. ''(A note on terminology: the terminology used in this area varies, sometimes significantly, from one author to another. See the article for details.)'' ==Formal definitions== Let ''S'' be a semigroup. Then a (left) '''semigroup action''' (or '''act''') of ''S'' is a set ''X'' together with an operation • : ''S'' &times; ''X'' → ''X'' which is compatible with the semigroup [[binary operation|operation]] * as follows: * for all ''s'', ''t'' in ''S'' and ''x'' in ''X'', ''s'' • (''t'' • ''x'') = (''s'' * ''t'') • ''x''. This is the analogue in semigroup theory of a (left) [[group action]], and is equivalent to a [[semigroup#Semigroup homomorphisms|semigroup homomorphism]] into the set of functions on ''X''. Right semigroup actions are defined in a similar way using an operation • : ''X'' &times; ''S'' → ''X'' satisfying (''x'' • ''a'') • ''b'') = ''x'' • (''a'' * ''b''). If ''M'' is a monoid, then a (left) '''monoid action''' (or '''act''') of ''M'' is a (left) semigroup action of ''M'' with the additional property that * for all ''x'' in ''X'': ''e'' • ''x'' = ''x'' where ''e'' is the identity element of ''M''. This correspondly gives a monoid homomorphism. Right monoid actions are defined in a similar way. A monoid ''M'' with an action on a set is also called an '''operator monoid'''. A semigroup action of ''S'' on ''X'' can be made into monoid act by adjoining an identity to the semigroup and requiring that it acts as the identity transformation on ''X''. ===Terminology and notation=== If ''S'' is a semigroup or monoid, then a set ''X'' on which ''S'' acts as above (on the left, say) is also known as a (left) '''''S''-act''', '''''S''-set''', '''''S''-action''', '''''S''-operand''', or '''left act over ''S'''''. Some authors do not distinguish between semigroup and monoid actions, by regarding the identity axiom (''e'' • ''x'' = ''x'') as empty when there is no identity element, or by using the term '''unitary ''S''-act''' for an ''S''-act with an identity.<ref>Kilp, Knauer and Mikhalev, 2000, pages 43-44.</ref> Furthermore, since a monoid is a semigroup, one can consider semigroup actions of
