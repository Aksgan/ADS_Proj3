The idea of expansivity is fairly [[rigid]], as the definition of positive expansivity, below, as well as the [[Schwarz-Ahlfors-Pick theorem]] demonstrate. ==Definition== If <math>(X,d)</math> is a [[metric space]], a [[homeomorphism]] <math>f\colon X\to X</math> is said to be '''expansive''' if there is a constant :<math>\varepsilon_0>0,</math> called the '''expansivity constant''', such that for any pair of points <math>x\neq y</math> in <math>X</math> there is an integer <math>n</math> such that :<math>d(f^n(x),f^n(y))\geq\varepsilon_0</math>. Note that in this definition, <math>n</math> can be positive or negative, and so <math>f</math> may be expansive in the forward or backward directions. The space <math>X</math> is often assumed to be [[compact space|compact]], since under that assumption expansivity is a topological property; i.e. if <math>d'</math> is any other metric generating the same topology as <math>d</math>, and if <math>f</math> is expansive in <math>(X,d)</math>, then <math>f</math> is expansive in <math>(X,d')</math> (possibly with a different expansivity constant). If :<math>f\colon X\to X</math> is a continuous map, we say that <math>X</math> is '''positively expansive''' (or '''forward expansive''') if there is a :<math>\varepsilon_0</math> such that, for any <math>x\neq y</math> in <math>X</math>, there is an <math>n\in\mathbb{N}</math> such that <math>d(f^n(x),f^n(y))\geq \varepsilon_0</math>. ==Theorem of uniform expansivity== Given ''f'' an expansive homeomorphism, the theorem of uniform expansivity states that for every <math>\epsilon>0</math> and <math>\delta>0</math> there is an <math>N>0</math> such that for each pair <math>x,y</math> of points of <math>X</math> such that <math>d(x,y)>\epsilon</math>, there is an <math>n\in \mathbb{Z}</math> with <math>\vert n\vert\leq N</math> such that :<math>d(f^n(x),f^n(y)) > c-\delta,</math> where <math>c</math> is the expansivity constant of <math>f</math> ([http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj&from=objects&id=4678 proof]). ==Discussion== Positive expansivity is much stronger than expansivity. In fact, one can prove that if <math>X</math> is compact and <math>f</math> is a positively expansive homeomorphism, then <math>X</math> is finite ([http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj&from=objects&id=4677 proof]). ==External links== *[http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Expansive_system Expansive dynamical systems] on scholarpedia {{planetmath|id=4513|title=expansive}} {{planetmath|id=4678|title=uniform expansivity}} [[Category:Dynamical systems]] {{mathanalysis-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>12811</id> <title>Expectation propagation</title> <text>'''Expectation propagation (EP)''' is a technique in Bayesian [[machine learning]], developed by [[Thomas Minka]].

This theory has proved useful to explain some popular choices that seem to contradict the [[expected value]] criterion (which takes into account only the sizes of the payouts and the probabilities of occurrence), such as occur in the contexts of gambling and insurance. [[Daniel Bernoulli]] initiated this theory in 1738. The [[von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem]] provides necessary and sufficient "rationality" axioms under which the expected utility hypothesis holds.<ref>http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/essays/uncert/vnmaxioms.htm</ref> ==Expected value and choice under risk== In the presence of risky outcomes, a decision maker could use the expected value criterion as a rule of choice: higher [[expected value]] investments are simply the preferred ones. For example, suppose there is a gamble in which the probability of getting a $100 payment is 1 in 80 and the alternative, and far more likely, outcome, is getting nothing. Then the expected value of this gamble is $1.25. Given the choice between this gamble and a guaranteed payment of $1, by this simple expected value theory people would choose the $100-or-nothing gamble. However, under expected utility theory, some people would be risk averse enough to prefer the sure thing, even though it has a lower expected value, while other less risk averse people would still choose the riskier, higher-mean gamble. ==Bernoulli's formulation== [[Nicolas Bernoulli]] described the [[St. Petersburg paradox]] (involving infinite expected values) in 1713, prompting two Swiss mathematicians to develop expected utility theory as a solution. The theory can also more accurately describe more realistic scenarios (where expected values are finite) than expected value alone. In 1728, [[Gabriel Cramer]], in a letter to Nicolas Bernoulli, wrote, "the mathematicians estimate money in proportion to its quantity, and men of good sense in proportion to the usage that they may make of it."<ref>[http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf#search=%22Nicolas%20Bernoulli%22]</ref> In 1738, Nicolas' cousin [[Daniel Bernoulli]], published the canonical 18th Century description of this solution in ''Specimen theoriae novae de mensura sortis'' or ''Exposition of a New Theory on the Measurement of Risk''.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Bernoulli | first = Daniel | authorlink = Daniel Bernoulli | coauthors = Originally published in 1738; translated by Dr. Lousie Sommer. | year = 1954 | month = January | title = Exposition of a New Theory on the Measurement of Risk | journal = Econometrica | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–36 | url = http://www.math.fau.edu/richman/Ideas/daniel.htm | accessdate = 2006-05-30 | doi = 10.2307/1909829 | jstor = 10.2307/1909829 | publisher = The Econometric Society }}</ref> Daniel Bernoulli proposed that a mathematical function should be used to correct the [[expected value]] depending on probability.
