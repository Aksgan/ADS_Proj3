moves, so does the signal of the mobile phone. By measuring and analyzing network data, using [[triangulation]], pattern matching or cell-sector statistics – in an anonymous format – the data is converted into accurate traffic flow information. With more congestion, there are more cars, more phones, and thus, more probes. In metropolitan areas, the distance between antennas is shorter and, thus, accuracy increases. No infrastructure needs to be built along the road; only the mobile phone network is leveraged. In some metropolitan areas, RFID signals from ETC transponders are used. Floating car data technology provides great advantages over existing methods of traffic measurement: * much less expensive than sensors or cameras * more coverage: all locations and streets * faster to set up (no work zones) and less maintenance * works in all weather conditions, including heavy rain Travel time data on freeways and arterial roadways is also being collected using sensors based on Bluetooth technology.<ref>Tarnoff, Philip John,Bullock, Darcy M, Young, Stanley E, et al.

Sensing systems for ITS are vehicle and infrastructure based networked systems, e.g., [[Intelligent vehicle technologies]]. Infrastructure sensors are indestructible (such as in-road reflectors) devices that are installed or embedded on the road, or surrounding the road (buildings, posts, and signs for example) as required and may be manually disseminated during preventive [[road construction]] maintenance or by sensor injection machinery for rapid deployment of the embedded radio frequency powered (or [[RFID]]) in-ground road sensors. Vehicle-sensing systems include deployment of infrastructure-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure electronic beacons for identification communications and may also employ the benefits of CCTV [[automatic number plate recognition]] technology at desired intervals in order to increase sustained monitoring of suspect vehicles operating in critical zones. ===Inductive loop detection=== [[Inductive loop]]s can be placed in a roadbed to detect vehicles as they pass over the loop by measuring the vehicle's magnetic field. The simplest detectors simply count the number of vehicles during a unit of time (typically 60 seconds in the [[United States]]) that pass over the loop, while more sophisticated sensors estimate the speed, length, and weight of vehicles and the distance between them. Loops can be placed in a single lane or across multiple lanes, and they work with very slow or stopped vehicles as well as vehicles moving at high-speed. ===Video vehicle detection=== Traffic flow measurement and automatic incident detection using video [[cameras]] is another form of vehicle detection. Since video detection systems such as those used in [[automatic number plate recognition]] do not involve installing any components directly into the road surface or roadbed, this type of system is known as a "non-intrusive" method of traffic detection. Video from black-and-white or color cameras is fed into [[processors]] that analyze the changing characteristics of the video image as vehicles pass. The cameras are typically mounted on [[utility pole|poles]] or structures above or adjacent to the roadway. Most video detection systems require some initial configuration to "teach" the processor the baseline background image. This usually involves inputting known measurements such as the distance between [[lane]] lines or the height of the camera above the roadway. A single video detection processor can detect traffic simultaneously from one to eight cameras, depending on the brand and model. The typical output from a video detection system is lane-by-lane vehicle speeds, counts, and lane occupancy readings. Some systems provide additional outputs including gap, headway, stopped-vehicle detection, and wrong-way vehicle alarms. ==Intelligent transport applications== ===Electronic toll collection=== [[Image:Chile Costanera Norte crossing downtown Santiago.JPG|thumb|right|[[Electronic toll collection]] at "''Costanera Norte''" Freeway, downtown [[Santiago, Chile]]]] {{Main|Electronic toll collection}} [[Electronic toll collection]] (ETC) makes it possible for vehicles to drive through toll gates at traffic speed, reducing congestion at toll plazas and automating toll collection. Originally ETC systems were used to automate toll collection, but more recent innovations have used ETC to enforce [[congestion pricing]] through [[cordon zones]] in city centers and ETC lanes. Until recent years, most ETC systems were based on using radio devices in vehicles that would use proprietary protocols to identify a vehicle as it passed under a [[gantry]] over the roadway. More recently there has been a move to standardize ETC protocols around the [[Dedicated Short Range Communications]] protocol that has been promoted for vehicle safety by the [[Intelligent Transportation Society of America]], [[ERTICO]] and [http://www.its-jp.org/english/ ITS Japan]. While communication frequencies and standards do differ around the world, there has been a broad push toward [[vehicle infrastructure integration]] around the 5.9 GHz frequency (802.11.x WAVE). Via its National Electronic Tolling Committee representing all jurisdictions and toll road operators, [[ITS Australia]] also facilitated interoperability of toll tags in Australia for the multi-lane free flow tolls roads. Other systems that have been used include [[barcode]] stickers, [[license plate recognition]], [[Infrared#Communications|infrared communication]] systems, and [[Radio Frequency Identification]] Tags (see [[M6 Toll tag]]). ===High occupancy toll lanes=== [[High-occupancy toll|High occupancy toll lanes (HOT lanes)]] is a road pricing scheme that gives motorists in single-occupant vehicles access to high-occupancy vehicle lanes (or "HOV lanes"). Sometimes, entire roads are designated for the use of HOVs. Tolls are collected either by manned toll booths, automatic number plate recognition, or electronic toll collection systems. Typically, these tolls increase as traffic density and congestion within the tolled lanes increases, a policy known as congestion pricing. The goal of this pricing scheme is to minimize traffic congestion within the lanes ===Emergency vehicle notification systems=== The in-vehicle [[eCall]] is an emergency call generated either manually by the vehicle occupants or automatically via activation of in-vehicle sensors after an accident. When activated, the in-vehicle eCall
