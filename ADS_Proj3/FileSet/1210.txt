The importance of the Dirichlet kernel comes from its relation to [[Fourier series]]. The [[convolution]] of ''D<sub>n</sub>''(''x'') with any function ''f'' of period 2&pi; is the ''n''th-degree Fourier series approximation to ''f'', i.e., we have :<math>(D_n*f)(x)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^\pi f(y)D_n(x-y)\,dy=\sum_{k=-n}^n \hat{f}(k)e^{ikx},</math> where :<math>\hat{f}(k)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^\pi f(x)e^{-ikx}\,dx</math> is the ''k''th Fourier coefficient of ''f''. This implies that in order to study convergence of Fourier series it is enough to study properties of the Dirichlet kernel. Of particular importance is the fact that the [[Lp space|''L''<sup>1</sup>]] norm of ''D<sub>n</sub>'' diverges to infinity as ''n'' &rarr; &infin;. One can estimate that :<math>\| D_n \| _{L^1} \approx \log n</math> where <math>\approx</math> denotes "is of the order." This lack of uniform integrability is behind many divergence phenomena for the Fourier series. For example, together with the [[uniform boundedness principle]], it can be used to show that the Fourier series of a [[continuous function]] may fail to converge pointwise, in rather dramatic fashion. See [[convergence of Fourier series]] for further details. [[Image:Dirichlet.png|thumb|400px|Plot of the first few Dirichlet kernels]] ==Relation to the delta function== <!--I am not sure this is useful here. To understand the definition, one can see that it is 2&pi; times the ''n''th-degree [[Fourier series]] approximation to a "function" with period 2&pi; given by :<math>\delta_p(x)=\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty\delta(x-2\pi k)</math> where &delta;--> Take the [[periodic function|periodic]] [[Dirac delta function]], which is not really a function, in the sense of mapping one set into another, but is rather a "[[generalized function]]", also called a "distribution", and multiply by 2&pi;. We get the [[identity element]] for convolution on functions of period 2&pi;. In other words, we have :<math>f*(2\pi \delta)=f \,</math> for every function ''f'' of period 2&pi;. The Fourier series representation of this "function" is :<math>2\pi \delta(x)\sim\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty e^{ikx}=\left(1 +2\sum_{k=1}^\infty\cos(kx)\right).</math> Therefore the Dirichlet kernel, which is just the sequence of partial sums of this series, can be thought of as an ''[[approximate identity]]''. Abstractly speaking it is not however an approximate identity of ''positive'' elements (hence the failures mentioned above). ==Proof of the trigonometric identity== The [[trigonometric identity]] :<math>\sum_{k=-n}^n e^{ikx} =\frac{\sin((n+1/2)x)}{\sin(x/2)}</math> displayed at the top of this article may be established as follows. First recall that the sum of a finite [[geometric series]] is :<math>\sum_{k=0}^n a r^k=a\frac{1-r^{n+1}}{1-r}.</math> In particular, we have :<math>\sum_{k=-n}^n r^k=r^{-n}\cdot\frac{1-r^{2n+1}}{1-r}.</math> Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by ''r''<sup>&minus;1/2</sup>, getting :<math>\frac{r^{-n-1/2}}{r^{-1/2}}\cdot\frac{1-r^{2n+1}}{1-r} =\frac{r^{-n-1/2}-r^{n+1/2}}{r^{-1/2}-r^{1/2}}.</math> In case ''r'' = ''e''<sup>''ix''</sup> we have :<math>\sum_{k=-n}^n e^{ikx}=\frac{e^{-(n+1/2)ix}-e^{(n+1/2)ix}}{e^{-ix/2}-e^{ix/2}} =\frac{-2i\sin((n+1/2)x)}{-2i\sin(x/2)} = \frac{\sin((n+1/2)x)}{\sin(x/2)}</math> as required. ==References== *Andrew M.

The [[instruction set architecture]] is based on a three-operand memory-to-memory machine. It includes instructions for arithmetic, [[control flow]], data motion. There are also instructions for creating new [[process (computing)|process]]es, synchronizing and communicating between processes, loading modules of code, and support for higher-level data-types: strings, arrays, lists, and communication channels.

Though DEM is very closely related to [[molecular dynamics]], the method is generally distinguished by its inclusion of rotational degrees-of-freedom as well as stateful contact and often complicated geometries (including polyhedra). With advances in computing power and numerical algorithms for nearest neighbor sorting, it has become possible to numerically simulate millions of particles on a single processor. Today DEM is becoming widely accepted as an effective method of addressing engineering problems in granular and discontinuous materials, especially in granular flows, powder mechanics, and rock mechanics. The various branches of the DEM family are the [[distinct element method]] proposed by [[Peter A. Cundall|Cundall]] in 1971, the [[generalized discrete element method]] proposed by [[Grant Hocking|Hocking]], [[John R. Williams|Williams]] and [[Graham Mustoe|Mustoe]] in 1985, the [[Discontinuous Deformation Analysis|discontinuous deformation analysis]] (DDA) proposed by [[Gen-hua Shi|Shi]] in 1988 and the finite-discrete element method concurrently developed by several groups (e.g., [[Ante Munjiza|Munjiza]] and [[Roger Owen|Owen]]).
