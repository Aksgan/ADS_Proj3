Many [[operating system]]s and some [[software]] automatically delete the contents of this directory at [[booting|bootup]] or at regular intervals. For [[Computer security|security]] reasons, it is best for each [[User (computing)|user]] to have his own temporary directory, since there has been a history of [[Vulnerability (computing)|security vulnerabilities]] with temporary files due to programs incorrect [[file permission]]s or [[Race hazard|race conditions]]. A standard procedure for [[system administration]] is to reduce the amount of storage space used (typically, on a disk drive) by removing temporary files. In multi-user systems, this can potentially remove ''active'' files, disrupting users' activities. To avoid this, some space-reclaiming procedures remove only files which are inactive or "old", those which have not been read or modified in several days. ==Traditional locations== In [[MS-DOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]], the temporary directory is set by the [[environment variable]] <tt>TEMP</tt>. Originally, the default was <tt>c:\Temp</tt>, then <tt>%Windows%\Temp</tt>. In modern versions, the temporary directory is set per-user as <tt>Local Settings\Temp</tt>, although it is still user-relocatable. In [[Unix]] and [[Linux]], the global temporary directories are <tt>/tmp</tt> and <tt>/var/tmp</tt>. Websites periodically write data to the tmp directory during page views and downloads. Typically, <tt>/var/tmp</tt> is for persistent files (as it may be preserved over reboots), and <tt>/tmp</tt> is for more temporary files. See [[Filesystem Hierarchy Standard]]. In addition, a user can set his [[TMPDIR]] [[environment variable]] to point to a preferred directory (where the creation and modification of files is [[File system permissions#Basic Permissions|allowed]]). ==See also== *[[Temporary file]] *[[Temporary variable]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Temporary Folder}} [[Category:Computer file systems]] {{Compu-storage-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>37042</id> <title>Tera Term</title> <text>{{Infobox Software | name = Tera Term | screenshot = | caption = | developer = Tera Term Project | programming language = | latest_release_version = 4.67 | latest_release_date = {{release_date|2010|08|31}} | operating_system = [[Microsoft Windows]] | genre = [[Terminal emulator]] | license = [[BSD license]] | website = http://ttssh2.sourceforge.jp }} '''Tera Term''' (rarely '''TeraTerm''') is an open-source, free, software implemented, [[terminal emulator]] (communications) program. It emulates different types of [[computer terminal]]s, from DEC [[VT100]] to DEC VT382. It supports [[telnet]], [[Secure Shell|SSH]] 1 & 2 and serial port connections. It also has a built-in [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] scripting language and a few other useful plugins. The first versions of Tera Term were created by T. Teranishi from Japan. At the time, it was one of the only freely available terminal emulators to effectively support the Japanese language. Original development of Tera Term stopped in the late 1990s at version 2.3, but other organizations have created variations. In October 2002, Ayera Technologies released TeraTerm Pro 3.1.3 supporting SSH2 and added multiple other features like a built-in [[web server]] for [[API]] integration with external systems, recurring "keep-alive" commands, and [[ODBC]] database support via the TT Macro Scripting Language. Ayera Technologies did not make their source open, but does provide limited technical support. In 2004 Yutaka Hirata, a software designer from Japan, restarted development of the open source version of Tera Term. He added his own implementation of SSH2 and many new features on top of what was part of version 2.3. A complete list of them is published on [http://www.logmett.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3 TeraTerm Support forum]. To avoid confusion with version numbers and to indicate that Tera Term developed by Yutaka was more recent than version 3.1.3 from Ayera Technologies, it was decided to give this branch of Tera Term Professional version numbers starting 4.xx. In January 2005 Boris Maisuradze, together with Yutaka Hirata, started the [http://www.logmett.com/forum/index.php TeraTerm Support forum] where they answer questions from Tera Term users. Posting in this forum is the best way to suggest new features for Tera Term or propose new commands for the Tera Term Macro language. Since 2007 Tera Term has been maintained by Tera Term Project (Japanese Developer team) as open source software. The latest versions of Tera Term are compatible with [[Windows 98]] and higher. Tera Term has comparable features to [[PuTTY]] and [[SecureCRT]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Davis | first = David | title = Using a terminal emulator to access Cisco command-line interface | url=http://www.zdnetasia.com/techguide/network/0,3800010800,62031238,00.htm | accessdate = 2008-11-11 }}</ref> == References == {{refimprove|date=March 2009}} {{reflist}} ==Tera Term latest sample images== <gallery> Image:TeraTerm Connection beginning.JPG Image:Operation of Tera Term.JPG Image:Connection to Com Port.JPG </gallery> ==External links== *[http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA002416/teraterm.html Original website of T.Teranishi] *[http://ttssh2.sourceforge.jp/index.html.en TeraTerm Home Page in English] *[http://sourceforge.jp/projects/ttssh2/ Project Top Page in Japanese] *[http://en.sourceforge.jp/projects/ttssh2/ Download link to the latest versions (Sourceforge Japan)] *[http://www.logmett.com/forum/index.php Tera Term Support forum.
