However, this code and the underlying standards they describe are in the public domain and are also covered by rights USL sold to [[The Open Group]].<ref>Bruce Perens, [http://www.zdnet.com.au/insight/software/0,39023769,39116509,00.htm SCO's failing case against IBM], zdnet.com.au, March 10, 2004.</ref> A later claim was made to code segments related to [[Executable and Linkable Format|ELF]] file format standards. This material was developed by the Tool Interface Standard (TIS) Committee and placed in the public domain.<ref>[http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20040722135616439 Groklaw - A Tall Tale About ELF - by Frank Sorenson, Dr Stupid and PJ<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> SCO claims that the TIS Committee had no authority to place ELF in the public domain, even though SCO's predecessor in interest was a member of the committee.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} SCO has claimed that some are violating UNIX SVRx copyrights by putting UNIX code into Linux. They may or may not have brought this claim directly in any of their cases. The IBM case is about derivative works, not SVRx code (see below). The Novell case is about copyright ownership. DaimlerChrysler was about contractual compliance statements. The "may or may not" comes from AutoZone's case.{{Or|date=September 2007}} In AutoZone, SCO's complaint claimed damages for AutoZone's use of Linux. However, when objecting to AutoZone's request for a stay pending the IBM case, SCO apparently contradicted their written complaint, claiming that the case was entirely about AutoZone copying certain libraries (outside the Linux kernel) from a UNIX system to a Linux-based system to facilitate moving an internal application to the Linux platform faster; SCO's original complaint does not appear to mention these libraries. AutoZone denies having done this with UNIX libraries. If SCO's oral description of their case is the correct one, then their AutoZone claim has nothing to do with the Linux kernel or the actions of any distributors. The copyright issue is addressed directly in two of the cases. The first is by IBM in their counterclaim in ''[[SCO v. IBM]]''. The issue is central to a pending motion by IBM, stating that IBM violated no copyrights in its Linux related activities. It is also addressed by Red Hat in the Red Hat v. SCO case. Red Hat claims that SCO's statements about infringement in Linux are unproven and untrue, damaging to them and violates the [[Lanham Act]]. Red Hat asks for an injunction to stop claims of violations without proof. They also ask for a judgment that they violated no SCO copyrights. A hearing on the IBM motion was held on September 15, 2004. Judge Kimball took the motion under advisement. The Red Hat case is on hold. ====Allegations of reverse copying==== ''EWeek'' has reported allegations that SCO may have copied parts of the Linux kernel into SCO UNIX as part of its Linux Kernel Personality feature.<ref>[http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1653684,00.asp Did SCO Violate the GPL?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> If true, this would mean that SCO is guilty of a breach of the Linux kernel copyrights. SCO has denied this allegation, but according to Groklaw, one SCO employee confirmed it in a deposition.<ref>[http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20050809082902461 Groklaw - Erik Hughes Deposition: LKP Did Include Linux Kernel Code<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> ====IBM code in Linux==== SCO has claimed a number of instances of IBM Linux code as breaches of contract. These examples include code related to [[Symmetric multiprocessing]] (SMP), [[Journaled File System]] (JFS), [[Read-copy-update]] (RCU) and [[Non-Uniform Memory Access]] (NUMA). This code is questionably in the Linux kernel,{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} and may have been added by IBM through the normal kernel submission process. This code was developed and copyrighted by IBM. IBM added features to AIX and Dynix. SCO claims that they have "control rights" to this due to their licensing agreements with IBM. SCO disavows claiming that they own the code IBM wrote, rather comparing their "control rights" to an [[easement]], rights which allow them to prohibit IBM from publicizing the code they wrote, even though IBM owns the copyrights. They base this claim on language in the original license agreement that requires non-disclosure of the code and claim that all code developed by UNIX licensees that is used with the code under license be held in confidence. This claim is discussed above at [[#Control of derivative works|Control of derivative works]]. ===SCO and the GPL=== Before changing their name to the SCO Group, the company was known as '''Caldera'''. Caldera was one of the major distributors of Linux from [[1994]] to 2003. Some, like [[Eben Moglen]],<ref name="fsf">{{cite web|url=http://www.fsf.org/licensing/sco/sco-v-ibm.html|title=FSF Statement on SCO v.

However, as late as July and August 2006, long after that claim was made, they were still distributing ELF files (the subject of one of SCO's claims regarding SVRx) under the GPL.<ref>[http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060731122623203 Groklaw - SCO is Distributing ELF Under the GPL Still.
