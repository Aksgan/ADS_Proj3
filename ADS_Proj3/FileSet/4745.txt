are separated from data coming back to the page (asynchronously). Otherwise, the user would have to routinely wait for the data to come back before they can do anything else on that page, just as a user has to wait for a page to complete the reload. This also increases overall performance of the site, as the sending of requests can complete quicker independent of blocking and queueing required to send data back to the client. The data fetched by an Ajax request is typically formatted in [[XML]] or [[JSON]] (JavaScript Object Notation) format, two widely used structured data formats. Since both of these formats are natively understood by JavaScript, a programmer can easily use them to transmit structured data in their web application. When this data is received via Ajax, the JavaScript program then uses the [[Document Object Model]] (DOM) to dynamically update the web page based on the new data, allowing for a rapid and interactive user experience. In short, using these techniques, Web designers can make their pages function like desktop applications. For example, [[Google Docs]] uses this technique to create a Web-based word processor. [[Adobe Flex]] is another technology often used in Web 2.0 applications. Compared to JavaScript libraries like [[jQuery]], Flex makes it easier for programmers to populate large data grids, charts, and other heavy user interactions.<ref>[http://maraksquires.com/articles/2009/11/16/javascript-jquery-versus-actionscript-flex-take-1/ Maraksquires.com]</ref> Applications programmed in Flex, are compiled and displayed as [[Adobe Flash Player|Flash]] within the browser. As a widely available plugin independent of [[W3C]] (World Wide Web Consortium, the governing body of web standards and protocols), standards, Flash is capable of doing many things which were not possible pre [[HTML]] 5, the language used to construct web pages. Of Flash's many capabilities, the most commonly used in Web 2.0 is its ability to play audio and video files. This has allowed for the creation of Web 2.0 sites where video media is seamlessly integrated with standard [[HTML]]. In addition to Flash and Ajax, JavaScript/Ajax frameworks have recently become a very popular means of creating Web 2.0 sites. At their core, these frameworks do not use technology any different from JavaScript, Ajax, and the DOM. What frameworks do is smooth over inconsistencies between web browsers and extend the functionality available to developers. Many of them also come with customizable, prefabricated '[[widget]]s' that accomplish such common tasks as picking a date from a calendar, displaying a data chart, or making a tabbed panel. On the server side, Web 2.0 uses many of the same technologies as Web 1.0. New languages such as [[PHP]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[ColdFusion]], [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Java Server Pages|JSP]] and [[Active Server Pages|ASP]] are used by developers to dynamically output data using information from files and databases. What has begun to change in Web 2.0 is the way this data is formatted. In the early days of the Internet, there was little need for different websites to communicate with each other and share data. In the new "participatory web", however, sharing data between sites has become an essential capability. To share its data with other sites, a web site must be able to generate output in machine-readable formats such as [[XML]], [[RSS]], and [[JSON]]. When a site's data is available in one of these formats, another website can use it to integrate a portion of that site's functionality into itself, linking the two together. When this design pattern is implemented, it ultimately leads to data that is both easier to find and more thoroughly categorized, a hallmark of the philosophy behind the Web 2.0 movement. In brief, AJAX is a key technology used to build Web 2.0 because it provides rich user experience and works any browser whether it is Firefox or Internet Explorer. Then, a language with very good web services support should be used to build Web 2.0 applications. In addition, the language used should be iterative meaning that it will help easy and fast the addition and deployment of features. ==Concepts== Web 2.0 can be described in 3 parts which are as follows: * Rich Internet Application (RIA) - It defines the experience brought from desktop to browser whether it is from a graphical point of view or usability point of view. Some buzz words related to RIA are AJAX and Flash. * Service-oriented Architecture (SOA) - It is a key piece in Web 2.0 which defines how Web 2.0 applications expose its functionality so that other applications can leverage and integrate the functionality providing a set of much richer applications (Examples are: Feeds, RSS, Web Services, Mash-ups) * Social Web - It defines how Web 2.0 tend to interact much more with the end user and making the end user an integral part. As such, Web 2.0 draws together the capabilities of [[client (computing)|client]]- and [[server (computing)|server]]-side software, [[content syndication]] and the use of [[List of network protocols|network protocols]]. Standards-oriented [[web browser]]s may use [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]]s and software extensions to handle the content and the user interactions. Web 2.0 sites provide users with [[Computer data storage|information storage]], creation, and dissemination capabilities that were not possible in the environment now known as "Web 1.0". Web 2.0 websites include the following features and techniques: Andrew McAfee used the acronym [[SLATES]] to refer to them:<ref>McAfee, A. (2006). Enterprise 2.0: The Dawn of Emergent Collaboration.

In blogs, posts and the comments of individuals build up over time. ; Tags : Categorization of content by users adding "tags" - short, usually one-word descriptions - to facilitate searching, without dependence on pre-made categories.
