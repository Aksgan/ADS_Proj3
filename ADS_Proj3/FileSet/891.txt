A surveillance program installed on a computer can search the contents of the hard drive for suspicious data, can monitor computer use, collect [[password]]s, and/or report back activities in real-time to its operator through the Internet connection. There are multiple ways of installing such software. The most common is remote installation, using a [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] created by a [[computer virus]] or [[Trojan (computer security)|trojan]]. This tactic has the advantage of potentially subjecting multiple computers to surveillance. Viruses often spread to thousands or millions of computers, and leave "backdoors" which are accessible over a network connection, and enable an intruder to remotely install software and execute commands. These viruses and trojans are sometimes developed by government agencies, such as [[CIPAV]] and [[Magic Lantern (software)|Magic Lantern]]. More often, however, viruses created by other people or [[spyware]] installed by marketing agencies can be used to gain access through the security breaches that they create. Another method is [[Security cracking|"cracking"]] into the computer to gain access over a network. An attacker can then install surveillance software remotely. [[Server (computing)|Server]]s and computers with permanent [[broadband]] connections are most vulnerable to this type of attack. One can also physically place surveillance software on a computer by gaining entry to the place where the computer is stored and install it from a [[compact disc]], [[floppy disk]], or [[thumbdrive]]. This method shares a disadvantage with hardware devices in that it requires [[physical access]] to the computer. ==Social network analysis== One common form of surveillance is to create maps of [[social network]]s based on data from [[social networking sites]] as well as from [[traffic analysis]] information from phone call records such as those in the [[NSA call database]],<ref name="keefe">{{cite news|title=, Can Network Theory Thwart Terrorists?|last=Keefe|first=Patrick|date=March 12, 2006|work=New York Times|accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref> and internet traffic data gathered under [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act|CALEA]].
