Table]]. [[File:Miletus Bay silting evolution map-en.svg|thumb|right|350px|Locations of thirteen Asia Minor Athenian cities.]] ===Sea level change=== In Book IV Chapter 1 Subsection 4, there is a description of thirteen [[Athenian]] cities in [[Asia Minor]], "the land of [[Caria]]", in present day Turkey. These cities are given as: [[Ephesus]], [[Miletus]], [[Myus]], [[Priene]], [[Samos]], [[Teos]], [[Colophon]], [[Chius]], [[Erythrae]], [[Phocaea]], [[Clazomenae]], [[Lebedos]], [[Melite]] and later a fourteenth, [[Smyrna]]eans. Myus, the third city, is described as being "long ago engulfed by the water, and its sacred rites and suffrage". This sentence indicates that at the time of Vitruvius's writing it was known that sea-level change and/or land subsidence occurred. The layout of these cities is in general from South to North so that it appears that where Myrus should be located is inland. If this is the case then since the writing of ''De architectura'' the region has either experienced soil rebound or a sea-level fall. Though not indicative of sea-level change, nor speculation of such, many Roman ports suffered from silting. Roman salt works in Essex County, England today are located at the 5 meter contour implying this was the coastline<ref>Gilman, Paul "Securing a Future for Essex's Past" Heritage Conservation Planning Division, Essex County Council England, [http://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/1099/essex.html], accessed 10/29/2008</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Wilkinson | first1 = T.

These observations only indicate the extent of silting and soil rebound affecting coastline change since the writing of De architectura. ==Survival and rediscovery== [[Image:Escribano.jpg|thumb|250px|This miniature of [[Jean Miélot]] (d. 1475) depicts him writing, probably in the library of [[Philip the Good]].]] Vitruvius' work is one of many examples of Latin texts that owe their survival to the palace [[scriptorium]] of [[Charlemagne]] in the early 9th century. (This activity of finding and recopying classical [[manuscript]]s is part of what is called the [[Carolingian Renaissance]].) Many of the surviving manuscripts of Vitruvius' work derive from an existing manuscript that was written there, [[British Library]] manuscript Harley 2767 [http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/record.asp?MSID=8557&CollID=8&NStart=2767]. These texts were not just copied but also were known at the court of Charlemagne, since his historian, the bishop [[Einhard]], asked for explanations of some technical terms at the visiting English churchman [[Alcuin]]. Additionally, a number of individuals are known to have read the text or have been indirectly influenced by it, these are: Vussin, [[Hrabanus Maurus]], [[Hermann of Reichenau]], [[Hugo of St. Victor]], Gervase of Melkey, [[William of Malmesbury]], Theoderich of St. Trond, [[Petrus Diaconus]], [[Albertus Magnus]], [[Filippo Villani]], [[Jean de Montreuil]], [[Petrarch]], [[Boccaccio]], [[Giovanni de Dondi]], Domenico di Bandino, [[Niccolò Acciaioli]] bequeathed copy to the [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence]], [[Bernward of Hildesheim]] and [[St. Thomas Aquinas]]<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Krinsky | first1 = Carol Herselle | title = Seventy-Eight Vitruvius Manuscripts | journal = Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes | volume = 30 | pages = 36–70 | publisher = The Warburg Institute | year = 1967 | url = http://www.jstor.org/stable/750736}}</ref>. In 1244 the Dominican friar [[Vincent of Beauvais]] made a large number of references to "De Architectura" in his compendium of all the knowledge of the Middle Ages ''"Speculum maius"''. Many copies of ''De architectura'', dating from the eight to the fifteenth centuries, did exist in manuscript form during the [[Middle Ages]] and ninety-two are still available in public collections. But they appear to have received little attention. Possibly due to the obsolescence of many specialized Latin terms used by Vitruvius {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} and the loss of most of the original ten illustrations thought by some to be helpful understanding parts of the text. Vitrivius' work was "rediscovered" in 1414 by the [[Florence|Florentine]] [[Humanism|humanist]] [[Poggio Bracciolini]], who found it in the Abbey of [[St Gallen]], [[Switzerland]]. He publicized the manuscript to a receptive audience of [[Renaissance]] thinkers, just as interest in the classical cultural and scientific heritage was reviving. [[File:De Architectura030.jpg|thumb|left|225px|"Vitruvian Man", illustration in the edition of "De Architectura" by Vitruvius; illustrated edition by Cesare Cesariano (1521)]] The first printed edition (''editio princeps''), an [[incunabula]] version, was published by the [[Verona|Veronese]] scholar [[Fra Giovanni Sulpitius]] in 1486 (with a second edition in 1495 or 1496). But none was illustrated. The [[Dominican friar]] [[Fra Giovanni Giocondo]] produced the first version illustrated with [[woodcut]]s in [[Venice]] in 1511. It had a thorough philosophical approach and superb illustrations. Translations into [[Italian language|Italian]] were in circulation by the 1520s, the first in print being the translation with new illustrations by [[Cesare Cesariano]], a Milanese friend of the architect [[Bramante]], printed in [[Como]] in 1521. It was rapidly translated into other European languages{{ndash}} the first [[German language|German]] version was published in 1528{{ndash}} and the first French versions followed in 1547 (but contained many mistakes). The first Spanish translation was published in 1582 by Miguel de Urrea and Juan Gracian. The most authoritative and influential edition was publicized in French in 1673 by [[Claude Perrault]], commissioned by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] in 1664. The first English translation followed in 1692. It was an abridgment based on the French version of Claude Perrault. Curiously, English-speakers had to wait until 1771 for a full translation of the first five volumes and 1791 for the whole thing. Sir [[Henry Wotton]]'s 1624 version, ''The Elements of Architecture'', was more of a free adaptation than a literal translation, while a 1692 translation was much abbreviated. Thanks to the art of printing, Vitruvius' work had become a popular subject of [[hermeneutics]], with highly detailed and interpretive illustrations, and became widely dispersed. ==Impact== The rediscovery of Vitruvius' work had a profound influence on architects of the [[Renaissance]], prompting the rise of the [[Neo-Classical style]]. Renaissance architects, such as [[Niccoli]], [[Brunelleschi]] and [[Leon Battista Alberti]], found in "De Architectura" their rationale for raising their
