[[Gerd Gigerenzer]] focuses on how heuristics can be used to make judgments that are in principle accurate, rather than producing cognitive biases – heuristics that are "fast and frugal".<ref>Gerd Gigerenzer, Peter M.

A good example is a [[Model (physical)|model]] which, as [[Map/territory relation|it is never identical with what it models]], is a heuristic device to enable understanding of what it models. Stories, metaphors, etc., can also be termed heuristic in that sense. A classic example is the notion of [[utopia]] as described in [[Plato]]'s best-known work, ''[[Plato's Republic|The Republic]]''. This means that the "ideal city" as depicted in ''The Republic'' is not given as something to be pursued, or to present an orientation-point for development; rather, it shows how things would have to be connected, and how one thing would lead to another (often with highly problematic results), if one would opt for certain principles and carry them through rigorously. "Heuristic" is also often commonly used as a [[noun]] to describe a rule-of-thumb, procedure, or method.<ref>[[Katarzyna Jaszczolt|K. M. Jaszczolt]] (2006).

(2007). ''Heuristics and the Law'', Cambridge, The MIT Press, ISBN 978-0-262-07275-5</ref> For instance, in all states in the [[United States]] the [[legal drinking age]] is 21, because it is argued that people need to be mature enough to make decisions involving the risks of [[alcohol]] consumption. However, assuming people mature at different rates, the specific age of 21 would be too late for some and too early for others. In this case, the somewhat arbitrary deadline is used because it is impossible or impractical to tell whether an individual is sufficiently mature for society to trust them with that kind of responsibility. Some proposed changes, however, have included the completion of an alcohol education course rather than the attainment of 21 years of age as the criterion for legal alcohol possession. This would put youth alcohol policy more on a case-by-case basis and less on a heuristic one, since the completion of such a course would presumably be voluntary and not uniform across the population. The same reasoning applies to [[patent law]]. [[Patent]]s are justified on the grounds that inventors need to be protected in order to have incentive to invent. It is therefore argued that, in society's best interest, inventors should be issued with a temporary government-granted [[monopoly]] on their product, so that they can recoup their investment costs and make economic profit for a limited period. In the United States the length of this temporary monopoly is 20 years from the date the application for patent was filed, though the monopoly does not actually begin until the application has matured into a patent. However, like the drinking-age problem above, the specific length of time would need to be different for every product in order to be efficient; a 20-year term is used because it is difficult to tell what the number should be for any individual patent. More recently, some, including [[University of North Dakota]] law professor Eric E. Johnson, have argued that patents in different kinds of industries – such as [[software patent]]s – should be protected for different lengths of time.<ref>Eric E. Johnson (2006).

Most real-time, and even some on-demand, [[antivirus software|anti-virus scanners]] use heuristic signatures to look for specific attributes and
