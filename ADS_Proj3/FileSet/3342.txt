tied to corporate). Some support work may be shared across businesses (e.g., Canon or GE today) * '''Integrated''': single business, requiring a single business strategy for competitive advantage. Important business issues are formulated centrally and tailored for local needs to optimize the entire business. Success is measured by adding up the global numbers (e.g., McDonalds or Harley Davidson). Following are some of the operating implications of the choice<ref>Laying the Tracks for the Technology Train www.technologyevaluation.com/.../laying-the-tracks-for-the-technology-train-15640/ April 10, 2000.

For example, the first choice for a Holding Company such as Tyco Industries would not be to try to run all of the companies in its portfolio on a single configuration of the same financial management business applications. However, the "large grain" view insufficiently informs decisions within each model. For example, the Federated/Allied model suggests common IT Systems. However it is common that the Corporate/Home Office Company shares little with its Divisional Companies. MIT's Center for Information Systems Research presents a useful model which provides a way of thinking about the need for multiple Operating Models for a given Corporate Strategy. ==Center for Information Systems Research== [http://cisr.mit.edu/ CISR], a research group at the MIT Sloan School of Management has defined Operating Model in terms of this lightweight method to capture the business needs for degree of Business Process Standardization and Data Integration. CISR suggests that this type of Operating Model is useful to establish requirements for reusable Core Capabilities and to guide IT Investment decisions governance. The Operating Model can be used to drive architecture and infrastructure development ensuring that business needs are met with the right IT foundation. The resulting IT systems enable the company to grow its business, without having to do deep surgery on the IT systems each time the business grows either organically or through acquisitions. The implementation of integrated business processes and IT systems is the realization of the Operating Model. The team of Jeanne W. Ross, Peter Weill and David C. Robertson summarized their research in Enterprise Architecture as Strategy.<ref>[http://www.architectureasstrategy.com/book/eas/about.htm.]</ref> They found that an organization with an explicitly defined operating model report 31% higher operational efficiency, 33% higher customer satisfaction, and a 34% advantage in new product development. In an extension to the earlier Corporate Strategy work, they outline four operating models: ::::::'''Process Standardization''' {| class="wikitable" |- ! Process Integration !! Low!! High |- | '''High'''|| Coordination|| Unification |- | '''Low'''|| Diversification|| Replication |} * '''Coordination''' – businesses requiring low business process standardization but high business process integration (Compare with Allied Strategy – where subsidiaries provide varied products to the same customers) * '''Unification''' - businesses requiring both high business process standardization and high business process integration (Compare with Integrated Strategy) * '''Diversification''' - businesses requiring low business process standardization and low business process integration (Compare with Holding Company Strategy) * '''Replication''' - businesses requiring high business process standardization but low business process integration (Compare with Franchisees or Replicated Facilities of an Integrated Strategy) ==Role in Defining the Business and Technical Architecture== Operating Models drive the necessary level of business process integration and standardization to deliver the organizations proposition, goods and services to customers, shareholders and it people.<ref>Jeanne W. Ross, Peter Weill and David C. Robertson, Enterprise Architecture as Strategy (Harvard Business School Press, 2006)</ref> On the Business Architecture side, the Operating Model informs [[Business Architect]]ure as to the number of distinct market facing entities, the number of unique value propositions, and the number Capability Models required. For example, an Integrated Enterprise would have one customer facing brand and a single core Capability Model and a Holding Company would have one for each company in its portfolio. Depending on business strategy choice (profit propositions and value propositions), a Federated/Allied Strategy may require more than one Capability Model. The Operating Model also informs IT and other support services as to the value and appropriateness of shared services and related Service Level Agreements. On the [[Technical architecture]] side, the Operating Model informs IT leaders about how various technical and business components should be designed and implemented to enable the chosen Operating Model:<ref>Derived from: Jeanne W.

The dialogue can take place with top management and enable them to decide which operation models best describe the way they choose to operate the company. IT can also start with individual business units to identify the models (or mix of models) are currently in place helping clarify both intent and sources of synergy and disconnect between business and IT systems. Such dialogues allow IT management to use the Operating Model as Strategy to drive design of concrete plans to enable the business in the
