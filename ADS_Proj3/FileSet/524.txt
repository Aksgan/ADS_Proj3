Journalists Erika Montalvo and Jackie Sheppard of the ''[[Rocky Mountain Collegian]]'' observed "[s]ome may argue that Spears is not only a good recording artist but also an important cultural icon."<ref name="UWIRE"/> However, in examining her level of skill as an artist, it is questioned that "[a]lthough she has been classified among female elites such as Janet Jackson and Madonna, what does Ms. Spears really have in common with these divas of rock?"<ref name="UWIRE">{{Cite news|last1=Montalvo|first1=Erika|last2=Sheppard|first2=Jackie|title=CONCERT REVIEW: Pop's princess still reigns ... for now|newspaper=[[Rocky Mountain Collegian]]|publisher=[[UWIRE]]|date=November 16, 2001|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Joan Anderman of the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' remarked that "[t]hirteen costume changes in 90 minutes won't bless her with Madonna's intelligence or cultural barometer. An army of cutting-edge R&B producers won't supply her with Janet Jackson's sense of humor or sincere smile ... Britney's heroes aren't great singers. But they're real singers.

During her world-conquering peak, she was just about as cutting edge as you could get in the world of global pop superstardom. Spears didn’t just work with big names, she gave big names their names, and maintained her high currency in the world’s most fickle industry for years, when most aspiring starlets are lucky to manage months."<ref name="The Age"/> Madonna's respect for Spears has also been a subject of observation. Santiago Fouz-Hernández and Freya Jarman-Ivens, authors of ''Madonna's drowned worlds: new approaches to her cultural transformations, 1983-2003'' (2004) note that the most well known cross-generational relationship exists between Spears and Madonna in which "the entertainment newsmedia almost became obsessed with their relationship of mutual admiration."<ref name="MDW">{{Cite book|last=Hernández|first=Santiago|coauthors=Freya Jarman-Ivens|title=Madonna's drowned worlds: new approaches to her cultural transformations, 1983-2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|page=162|year=2004|isbn=9780754633723|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> The biographers also report "[s]ome observers of popular culture, however, feel that the comparisons between the two artist are meaningless and fail to recognize Madonna's unique contribution: Madonna was never 'just another pop star' whereas Britney can more easily be seen as a standard manufactured pop act."<ref name="MDW"/> ==Legacy== [[Image:Brits star in hollywood walk of fame.JPG|right|thumb|Spears's star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]]] Spears became an international [[pop icon|pop culture icon]] immediately after launching her recording career.

Many 19-year-olds haven't even started working by that age, whereas Britney, a former Mouseketeer, was that most unusual and volatile of American phenomena — a child with a full-time career. While other little girls were putting posters on their walls, Britney was wanting to be the poster on the wall.
