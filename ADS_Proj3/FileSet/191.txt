It was nicknamed [[Workbench (AmigaOS)|''Workbench'']] from the name of its [[Graphical user interface]] (GUI), due to an error of Commodore Marketing and Sales Department, which labeled the OS disk just with the name "Workbench Disk" and not with the correct name "AmigaOS Disk (Workbench)". The first versions of AmigaOS (1.0 and up to 1.3) are here indicated with the name of their original disks to preserve original custom. Kickstart/Workbench 1.4 was a [[Software testing#Beta testing|beta]] version of the upcoming 2.0 update and never released, but the Kickstart part was shipped in very small quantities with early [[Amiga 3000]] computers, where it is often referred to as the "[[Superkickstart]] ROM". In these machines it is only used to bootstrap the machine and load the Kickstart that will be used to actually boot the system. The appearance of a very early first release of 1.4 was similar to 1.3, but with colors slightly changed. A second version was similar to that of 2.0 and higher, with just minor differences. It is, however, possible to dump out of the OS selection screen by clicking where one would expect to see a close gadget. This will cause the machine to boot Kickstart 1.4 using either the wb_2.x: partition, or from a floppy. [[File:Wb 20.png|thumb|200px|Amiga Workbench 2.0 (1990).]] ====Versions 2.0 to 3.1==== Workbench 2.0 improvements introduced a lot of major advances to the GUI of Amiga operating system. The blue and orange colour scheme was replaced with a grey and light blue with 3D aspect in the border of the windows. The Workbench was no longer tied to the 640×256 (PAL) or 640×200 (NTSC) display modes, and much of the system was improved with an eye to making future expansion easier. For the first time, a standardised "look and feel" was added. This was done by creating the ''Amiga Style Guide'', and including libraries and software which assisted developers in making conformant software. Technologies included the GUI element creation library ''gadtools'', the software installation scripting language ''Installer'', and the ''[[AmigaGuide]]'' hypertext help system. ====Versions 3.5 and 3.9==== <!--[[Image:AmigaOS.svg|right|thumb|200px|Evolution of AmigaOS.]]--> [[File:AmigaOS 3 and clones.svg|right|thumb|200px|Evolution of AmigaOS 3.x.]] After the demise of [[Commodore International|Commodore]], the later owners of the Amiga trademark granted a license to a German company called [[Haage & Partner]] to update the Amiga's operating system. Along with this update came a change in the way people referred to the Amiga's operating system. Rather than specifying "Kickstart" or "Workbench", the updates were most often referred to as simply "AmigaOS". Whereas all previous OS releases were Motorola 68000 compatible, some OS components from release 3.5 onwards required a 68020 or better. ====Versions 4.0 and 4.1==== Eventually Amiga Inc. contracted Hyperion Entertainment to develop the [[PowerPC]] native AmigaOS 4 (OS4). <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0BxlY9g_OfLqDMDUxZWU2MDQtYWNmMi00ZmQyLTlmMDctYTdhYzdmYTM2YWQ1&hl=en |title=Amiga/Hyperion contract|date=2010-10-10|accessdate=2010-09-03}}</ref> Unlike the previous versions which were based on the [[Motorola]] [[68k]] central processor, OS4 is running only on PowerPC computer systems. Amiga, Inc.'s (current Amiga trademark owners) distribution policies for AmigaOS 4.0 and any later versions required that OS4 must be bundled with all new third-party hardware "Amigas", with the sole exception of Amigas with [[Phase5]] PowerPC accelerator boards, for which OS4 is sold separately. This requirement was overturned in the agreement reached between Amiga, Inc. and Hyperion in the settlement of a lawsuit over the ownership of AmigaOS 4. ==AmigaOS 4 prominent features== {{Original research|section|date=November 2010|discuss=Talk:AmigaOS_4#Fast ON and OFF}} {{Unreliable sources|section|date=November 2010}} Prominent features compared to other operating systems or previous versions of AmigaOS:<ref>{{Cite web|date=March 23, 2009 |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx3q2wFIn6k |title=YouTube video "Why use Amiga in 2009? - Long cut" |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2009-03-23 |accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref> ===General=== * '''Quick on:''' AmigaOS boots and reboots up in a few seconds.<ref>{{Cite web|date=May 12, 2009 |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87DeoBqGSeA |title=YouTube video AmigaOS 4.1 Startup and reboot |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2010-05-15 |accessdate=2010-05-17}}</ref> * '''Instant off / fast reboot:''' An oft-touted feature is that AmigaOS can be switched off in an instant by just hitting the off switch.<ref>{{Cite web|date=May 12, 2009 |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7ofkdlGGF4 |title=YouTube video AmigaOS 4.1 Reboot and shut down |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2009-05-12 |accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref> Arguably, however, this is not a feature, but a low expectation.
