allowing for a total circulation of more than 13,000 print and online readers and articles that can be translated into 38 languages. '''[http://www.stle.org/research/transactions/default.aspx? Tribology Transactions]''' features scientific and technical papers in the field of tribology. Since its inception in 1957, the quarterly journal has published more than 2,000 papers of relevance to a wide variety of industries. Transactions is read and referenced by nearly 1,000 leaders in the field of tribology research in countries around the world. '''[http://www.stle.org/research/tribology_letters.aspx? Tribology Letters]''' is devoted to the development of the science of tribology and its applications. It serves as a depository for new information on the properties of surfaces and interfaces in relative motion, among which are friction, lubrication, wear, adhesion, failure and contact phenomena. The journal facilitates communication and exchange of seminal ideas among thousands of practitioners who are engaged worldwide in the pursuit of tribology-based science and technology. Coverage spans all areas of industrial and academic tribology. Tribology Letters fosters the cross-fertilization of ideas by rapid dissemination of the results of frontier research and development ==Education and Certification== Professional development activities are at the heart of the STLE's programs. Technical professionals working in tribology and the lubricants industry expect that organizations like the STLE will remain as their primary source of continuing education. The STLE offers educational programs in several different venues and formats, such as the annual meeting, local sections, online education, certifications, and education partners. [http://www.stle.org/events/annual/details.aspx? The Annual Meeting] is a week long conference that occurs each May in various cities across the U.S., where one-day technical education courses are taught by professionals who have in-depth knowledge of current trends in their respective fields. Local Sections often conduct education days during the year, using a format similar to the Annual Meeting courses. The STLE also implementing online education in 2010 to the betterment of its members and it also works in conjunction with Education partners who have recommended training programs to further the success of the individual in the lubrication industry. The STLE is also proud to offer credentialing in 3 areas of expertise with sponsored certifications exams. The value of STLE certification has been proven in the market place with increased income and immediate respect and credibility with buyers and peers. These certifications are designed to be consistent with the standards of the National Organization for Competency Assurance (NOCA), ISO 17024, and also distinguish between a credible real professional and a “self-proclaimed” expert. These 3 exams are the Certified Lubrication Specialist (CLS), Oil Monitoring Analyst (OMA I and OMA II), and Certified Metalworking Fluids Specialist (CMFS). '''[http://www.stle.org/certifications/cls/program.aspx Certified Lubrication Specialist]''' (CLS) is the only independent certification for the lubrication professional that verifies your broad lubrication engineering knowledge. Certification recognizes those individuals who possess current knowledge of lubrication fundamentals and best practices in lubrication maintenance in industrial settings. Certified individuals must have at least three years of experience in the field of lubrication. '''[http://www.stle.org/certifications/oma/program.aspx Oil Monitoring Analyst]''' (OMA) is the certification for the Predictive Maintenance Professional that demonstrates competence in the field of machinery oil monitoring. Oil monitoring in this context consists of sampling and analyzing the oil properties to assess whether the oil needs service and/or to assess the mechanical health of the equipment being monitored. There are two types of OMA certifications. OMA I is for the oil sampler, the individual on the shop floor with responsibility for sampling the oil and the overall care of the equipment. OMA II is for the oil analyzer, the individual in the laboratory responsible for properly running the appropriate tests, data interpretation, program management, and related activities. '''[http://www.stle.org/certifications/cmfs/definitions.aspx Certified Metalworking Fluids Specialist]''' (CMFS) verifies knowledge, experience and education in this specialized and growing field. The certification is intended for individuals with overall responsibility for metal removal or forming fluids management; for specialists with on-site responsibility for metal removal or forming systems, and for others involved with research, instruction, evaluation, analysis, selection, technical management, application and handling of metalworking fluids and related materials. ==External links== * [http://www.stle.org Official website] [[Category:Engineering societies]] [[Category:Clubs and societies in the United States]] [[Category:Mechanical engineering]] [[Category:International non-profit organizations]] [[Category:Non-profit organizations based in Chicago, Illinois]] [[Category:United States organization stubs]]</text> </page> <page> <id>34870</id> <title>Sociology of knowledge</title> <text>{{refimprove|date=May 2010}} {{Sociology}} The '''Sociology of knowledge''' is the study of the relationship between human thought and the social context within which it arises, and of the effects prevailing ideas have on societies. (See also: [[sociology of scientific knowledge]]) It is not a specialized area of sociology but instead deals with broad fundamental questions about the extent and limits of social influences on individual's lives and the social-cultural basics of our knowledge about the world.<ref>http://www.stthomasu.ca/academic/soci/weeks/3523.htm</ref> The sociology of knowledge was pioneered primarily by the sociologists [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Marcel Mauss]] at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. Their works deal directly with how conceptual thought, language, and logic could be influenced by the sociological milieu out of which they arise. While neither author specifically coined nor used the term 'sociology of knowledge', their work is an important first contribution to the field. The specific term 'sociology of knowledge' first came into widespread use in the 1920s, when a number of German-speaking [[sociology|sociologists]], most notably [[Max Scheler]], and [[Karl Mannheim]], wrote extensively on it. With the dominance of [[functionalism (sociology)|functionalism]] through the middle years of the 20th century, the sociology of knowledge tended to remain on the periphery of mainstream sociological thought. It was largely reinvented and applied much more closely to everyday life in the 1960s, particularly by [[Peter L. Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann]] in ''[[The Social Construction of Reality]]'' (1966) and is still central for methods dealing with qualitative understanding of human society (compare ''[[socially constructed reality]]''). The 'genealogical' and 'archaeological' studies of [[Michel Foucault]] are of considerable contemporary influence. ==Schools== ===Émile Durkheim=== Émile Durkheim (1858-1917) is credited as having been the first professor to successfully establish the field of sociology, institutionalizing a department of sociology at the Université de Bordeaux in the 1890s.
