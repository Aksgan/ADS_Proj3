to reach the perfection of our kind. This, however, is not present in nature. Burke points out that a rock and a tree are perfectly acceptable as being what they are, but not so with man for he aims to be higher than he is.<ref>Burke, K. (1966). ''Language as symbolic action''. Berkley & Los Angeles: University of California Press, p.16-20</ref> While man's striving for perfection may afford him to reach admirable goals and progress, Burke also sees man's goal of perfection as one rife with danger. He points to our concepts of perfection in accordance with other terms. One particularly clear example he gives is the perfection for which was strived by the Nazis thus alluding to the consequences to which such ambitions may lead. Lastly, Burke explains that such dichotomies of perfection give credence to man's belief in God and Devil and Heaven and Hell.<ref>Burke, K. (1966). ''Language as symbolic action''. Berkley & Los Angeles: University of California Press, p.20</ref> ==Modern-day applications== [[Feminist]] scholarship has shown a use of Burke's definition as a framework by which a definition for woman can be derived. Their definition is as follows: "Woman is the symbol-receiving animal, inventor of nothing, submerged in her natural conditions by instruments of man's making, goaded at the bottom of hierarchy, and rotten by perfection".<ref>Condit, Celeste. (1992). Post burke: Transcending the sub-stance of dramatism, ''Quarterly Journal of Speech, 78'', (3), 349-355</ref> This particular definition clearly conveys a perception that views man as the suppressor of woman and the cause for her restrained condition. One notable scholar, Celeste Condit, has written in an effort to modernize Burke's works and his "definition of man" in particular by calling for a Post-Burkean philosophy that takes Burke's ideas and transports them into what she calls the new scene, or modern day. She calls particularly for a restructuring each part of Burke's definition into terms that are founded on but surpass radical feminist ideologies as seen above. Condit defines people as those who play with symbols, invent the negative and possible morality, changed from nature by tools that men and woman have collectively made, struggling for equality, and at times rotten and perfect. Condit seeks to transform Burke's emphases of race and class into gender and culture. J. MacLennan has used Burkean ideas, particularly his [[dramatistic pentad]], in analyzing criminal behavior and offering an understanding of criminal behavior that is often at odds with the ideas of many criminologists and psychologists.<ref>MacLennan, J. (2005). A rhetorical journey into darkness: Crime scene profiling as Burkean analysis. ''KBJounal, 1'', (2). Retrieved October 26, 2006, from www.kbjournal.org</ref> Of particular interest to MacLennan is Burke's first clause in his definition of man as a "symbol-using animal". MacLennan maintains that this clause, coupled with Burke's ideas of motive, help explain criminal behavior. Burke posits that man uses symbols to obtain his goals, thus his motives are often carried out as acts based on his intentions. Thus Burke maintains that man's actions (use or misuse of symbols) are based on choices and not a compulsion or sickness. This has great implications for modern psychology which often views abnormal and criminal behavior as an illness that is forced upon those who act out in unacceptable ways. ==References== {{reflist}} ==Additional reading== *Burke, Kenneth.

A '''deformation retraction''' is a [[function (mathematics)|map]] which captures the idea of ''[[continuous function|continuously]] shrinking'' a space into a subspace. == Definitions == === Retract === Let ''X'' be a [[topological space]] and ''A'' a subspace of ''X''. Then a continuous map :<math>r:X \to A</math> is a ''retraction'' if the [[function (mathematics)#Restrictions and extensions|restriction]] of ''r'' to ''A'' is the [[Identity_function|identity map]] on ''A''; that is, ''r''(''a'') = ''a'' for all ''a'' in ''A''. Equivalently, denoting by :<math>\iota : A \hookrightarrow X</math> the [[Inclusion_map|inclusion]], a retraction is a continuous map ''r'' such that :<math>r \circ \iota = id_A,</math> that is, the composition of ''r'' with the inclusion is the identity of ''A''. Note that, by definition, a retraction maps ''X'' [[onto]] ''A''. A subspace ''A'' is called a '''retract''' of ''X'' if such a retraction exists. For instance, any space retracts to a point in the obvious way (the constant map yields a retraction). If ''X'' is hausdorff, then ''A'' must be closed. A space ''X'' is known as an '''absolute retract''' (or '''AR''') if for every [[normal space]] ''Y'' that embeds ''X'' as a closed subset, ''X'' is a retract of ''Y''. The unit cube ''I<sup>n</sup>'' as well as the [[Hilbert cube]] ''I<sup>Ï‰</sup>'' are absolute retracts. === Neighborhood retract === If there exists an [[open set]] ''U'' such that :<math>A \subset U \subset X</math> and ''A'' is a retract of ''U'', then ''A'' is called a '''neighborhood retract''' of ''X''. A space ''X'' is an '''absolute neighborhood retract''' (or '''ANR''') if for every normal space ''Y'' that embeds ''X'' as a closed subset, ''X'' is a neighborhood retract of ''Y''. The ''n''-sphere ''S<sup>n</sup>'' is an absolute neighborhood retract. === Deformation retract and Strong deformation retract=== A continuous map :<math>F:X \times [0, 1] \to X</math> is a ''deformation retraction'' of a space ''X'' onto a subspace ''A'' if, for every ''x'' in ''X'' and ''a'' in ''A'', :<math> F(x,0) = x, \; F(x,1) \in A ,\quad \mbox{and} \quad F(a,1) = a.</math> In other words, a deformation retraction is a [[homotopy]] between a retraction and the identity map on ''X''. The subspace ''A'' is called a '''deformation retract''' of ''X''. A deformation retract is a special case of [[homotopy equivalence]]. A retract need not be
