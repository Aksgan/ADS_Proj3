to the specific type of [[integrated circuit]]s it uses.<ref name=ipad_review/> Ars Technica is written in an informal, opinionated tone, as opposed to a traditional journal, but its articles are often written by people with some expertise on the subject they are writing.<ref name=nature/><ref name=bonetta/> Many of the website's regular writers have [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] degrees, and many work for academic or private research institutions. Website co-founder Jon Stokes published the computer architecture textbook ''Inside The Machine'' in 2007;<ref name=inside_the_machine/> John Timmer performed [[postdoctoral research]] in [[neuroscience|developmental neurobiology]];<ref name=nature/> Timothy Lee is a scholar at the [[Cato Institute]], a [[policy institute|public policy institute]], which has republished Ars Technica articles by him.<ref name=cato/><ref name=cato_lee/> Biology journal ''[[Disease Models & Mechanisms]]'' called Ars Technica a "conduit between researchers and the public" in 2008.<ref name=dmm/> === Layout === Ars Technica's [[page layout]] has been significantly changed five times since its creation, most recently in 2009.<ref name=ars-v5/> The current layout consists of two vertical columns topped by a horizontal navigation bar, interspersed with two [[Web banner|banner advertisements]]. [[Hyperlink|Links]] on the navigation bar lead to the website's 17 sections. Any given article is listed under a section that organizes it by its general subject: Infinite Loop ([[Apple Inc.|Apple]]), Uptime ([[business]]), Gear & Gadgets (electronics), Opposable Thumbs ([[video games]]), One [[Microsoft]] Way, Open Ended ([[open source]]), [[Nobel prize|Nobel]] Intent (science), Law & Disorder (technology [[policy]]), Hardware, Media, Security, Software, Staff (articles about Ars Technica), Telecom ([[telecommunication]]), Web, and Exploring Datacenters. The left column lists the most recent articles of all types and their associated images. The right column showcases the ten latest Features with larger pictures; below the Features, it lists aggregated news, job listings for technology companies in the United States and Canada, and other varied links. == Revenue == The cost of operating Ars Technica has always been funded primarily by online advertising.<ref name=niemanlab/> Originally handled by Federated Media Publishing, selling advertising space on the website is now handled by Condé Nast.<ref name=arrington/> In addition to online advertising, Ars Technica has sold subscriptions to the website since 2001, now named Ars Premier subscriptions. Subscribers are not shown advertisements, and are able to see exclusive articles, post in certain areas of Ars Technica forum, participate in live [[chat rooms]] with notable people in the computer industry, and other benefits.<ref name=subs-faq/> To a lesser extent, revenue is also collected from content sponsorship. A series of articles about the future of collaboration was sponsored by [[IBM]],<ref name=niemanlab/> and the site's Exploring Datacenters section is sponsored by [[data management]] company [[NetApp]]. In the past, Ars Technica collected [[Revenue sharing|shared revenue]] from [[affiliate marketing]] by advertising deals and discounts from online retailers, and from the sale of Ars Technica-[[brand]]ed merchandise<!--until when?-->.<ref name=sales-merch-2001/> ===Advertisement block=== On March 5, 2010, Ars Technica experimentally blocked readers who use [[Adblock Plus]]—one of several computer programs that stop advertisements from being displayed in their [[Web browser|browser]]—from viewing the website. Fisher estimated 40% of the website's readers had the software installed at the time. The next day, the block was lifted, and the article "Why Ad Blocking is devastating to the sites you love" was published on Ars Technica persuading readers not to use the software on websites they care about:<ref name=niemanlab/> {{quote|text=... blocking ads can be devastating to the sites you love. I am not making an argument that blocking ads is a form of stealing, or is immoral, or unethical [...] It can result in people losing their jobs, it can result in less content on any given site, and it definitely can affect the quality of content. It can also put sites into a real advertising death spin.}} The block and article were controversial, generating articles on other websites about them, and the broader issue of advertising ethics.<ref name=asay_abp/><ref name=wsj_abp/> Readers of Ars Technica generally followed Fisher's persuasion; the day after his article was published, 25,000 readers who used the software had allowed the display of advertisements on Ars Technica in their browser, and 200 readers had subscribed to Ars Premier.<ref name=niemanlab/> Adblock Plus developer Wladimir Palant responded, stating that blocking advertisements in general is justified because websites receive revenue from them regardless of whether they are seen or ignored by readers:<ref name=Palant-response/> {{quote|text=Only an ad that generates a sale (either directly because the user clicked it or indirectly via brand awareness and similar) provides value. If you see yourself being paid without providing a value than [''sic''] you either tricked whoever is paying you [...] or it is a temporary state where whoever is paying you didn’t adjust to the new realities yet.}} ==See also== * [[Technical journalism]] * [[Science journalism]] == References == {{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs= <!--PRIMARY SOURCES--> <ref name=orig_staff>{{cite web|url=http://www.arstechnica.com/who.html |title=The Ars Technica Group |accessdate=2010-04-10 |year=1999 |work=Ars Technica |publisher=Ars Technica |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19990508065814/www.arstechnica.com/who.html |archivedate=1999-08-05 }}</ref> <ref name=old_cpu_guide>{{cite web|url=http://www.arstechnica.com/cpu/caching.html |title=Understanding CPU caching and performance |accessdate=2010-04-10 |date=1998-12-01 |work=Ars Technica |publisher=Ars Technica |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19990508170711/www.arstechnica.com/cpu/caching.html |archivedate=1999-08-05 }}</ref> <ref name=orig_mission_statement>{{cite web|url=http://www.arstechnica.com/welcome.html|title=Welcome to Ars Technica |accessdate=2010-04-10 |year=1999 |work=Ars Technica |publisher=Ars Technica |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19990508064339/www.arstechnica.com/welcome.html |archivedate=1999-08-05 }}</ref> <ref name=sales-merch-2001>{{cite web|url=http://www.arstechnica.com/etc/emporium/ |title=The Ars Emporium |accessdate=2010-04-10 |year=2001 |work=Ars Technica |publisher=Ars Technica |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20011217214051/arstechnica.com/etc/emporium/ |archivedate=2001-12-17 }}</ref> <ref name=subs-faq>{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/site/subscriber-faq.ars |title=Ars Premier FAQ |accessdate=2010-04-10 |date=2009-09-15 |work=Ars Technica |publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications|Condé Nast Digital]] }}</ref> <ref name=inside_the_machine>{{cite book | last = Stokes | first = John | title = Inside the machine: an illustrated introduction to microprocessors and computer architecture | publisher = No Starch Press | year = 2007 | location = | url = http://books.google.com/?id=Q1zSIarI8xoC&pg=PR15&dq=%22Ars+Technica%22#v=onepage&q=%22Ars%20Technica%22&f=false | doi = | id = | isbn = 1593271042 }}</ref> <ref name=ipad_review>{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2010/04/ipad-review.ars/ |title=Ars Technica reviews the iPad |accessdate=2010-04-10 |last=Jacqui |first=Cheng |date=2010-04-06 |work=Ars Technica |publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications|Condé Nast Digital]] }}</ref> <ref name=qubits>{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/science/guides/2010/01/a-tale-of-two-qubits-how-quantum-computers-work.ars/ |title=A tale of two qubits: how quantum computers work |accessdate=2010-04-10 |last=Altepeter |first=Joseph B. |date=2010-02-01 |work=Ars Technica |publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications|Condé Nast Digital]] }}</ref> <ref name=ars-v5>{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2009/01/welcome-to-ars-technica-v50.ars/2|title=Welcome to Ars Technica v5.0!|publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications|Condé Nast Digital]]|accessdate=2010-04-10|work=Ars Technica}}</ref> <ref name=latin>{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/site/about-ars-technica.ars |title=About Us |accessdate=2010-04-10 |work=Ars Technica |publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications|Condé Nast Digital]] }}</ref> <!--papers--> <ref name=bonetta>{{cite journal|title=Scientists Enter the Blogosphere |journal=Cell|date=2007-05-04|first=Laura|last=Bonetta|coauthors=|pmid=17482534|volume=129|issue=3|pages=443–445|doi= 10.1016/j.cell.2007.04.032|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WSN-4NMMB5G-3&_user=10&_coverDate=05%2F04%2F2007&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_searchStrId=1287306446&_rerunOrigin=scholar.google&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=e5909238c0f859c8436298d6a6ff32ae|format=|accessdate=2010-04-10|publisher=Elsevier }}</ref> <!--Newspapers(print/online)--> <ref name=wsj_video>{{cite video |people=Kara Swisher (Interviewer), Ken Fisher (Subject)|title=Ars Technica's Ken Fisher
