with the aim of dissemination as well as exchange of scientific knowledge and information on all sort of topics regarding the interdisciplinary discipline. === Historical survey === As a first example, in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] scientists have built up the MathSport group of ANZIAM (Australia and New Zealand Industrial Applied Mathematics), which since 1992 organizes biennial meetings under the name “Mathematics and Computers in Sport Conferences”. Main topics are mathematical models and computer applications in sports, as well as coaching and teaching methods based on informatics. The European community was also among the leading motors of the emergence of the field. Some workshops on this topic were successfully organized in Germany since the late 1980s. In 1997 the first international meeting on computer science in sport was held in Cologne. The main aim was to spread out and share applications, ideas and concepts of the use of computers in sports, which should also make a contribution to the creation of internationalization and thus to boost research work in this area. Since then, such international symposia took place every 2 years all over Europe. As the first conferences were a raving success, it was decided to go even further and the foundation of an organization was the logical consequence. This step was accomplished in 2003, when the International Association on Computer Science in Sport (IACSS) was established during the 4th international symposium in Barcelona, when Prof. Jürgen Perl was also chosen as the first president. Almost at the same time, the first international e-journal on this topic (International Journal of Computer Science in Sport) was released too. The internationalization is confirmed moreover by the fact that the last 2 conference took place outside of Europe - in [[Calgary]] ([[Canada]]) in 2007 and [[Canberra]] ([[Australia]]) in 2009. During the symposium in Calgary additionally the president position changed - it has been assigned to Prof. Arnold Baca, who has been re-elected in 2009. === National organizations === In addition to the international associations from above, currently the following national associations on computer science in sport exist (if available, the web addresses are also given): * Austrian Association of Computer Science in Sport * Croatian Association of Computer Science in Sport * Section Computer Science in Sport of the German Association of Sport Science - http://www.dvs-sportinformatik.de (in German) * Indian Federation of Computer Science in Sport - http://www.ifcss.in * Turkish Association of Computer Science in Sport - http://www.sbbd.org/indexENG.php * Chinese Association of Computer Science in Sport == References == {{reflist|2}} == Further reading == * Dabnichki P. & Baca, A.

We can also say software refers to one or more computer programs and data held in the storage of the computer for some purposes. Program [[software]] performs the [[Function (engineering)|function]] of the [[program]] it implements, either by directly providing [[instruction]]s to the computer hardware or by serving as input to another piece of software. The [[Terminology|term]] was coined to contrast to the old term [[hardware]] (meaning physical devices). In contrast to hardware, software is intangible, meaning it "cannot be touched".<ref>{{cite web | title = Wordreference.com: WordNet 2.0 | publisher = Princeton University, Princeton, NJ | url = http://www.wordreference.com/definition/software | accessdate = 2007-08-19 }}</ref> Software is also sometimes used in a more narrow sense, meaning [[application software]] only. Sometimes the term includes data that has not traditionally been associated with computers, such as film, tapes, and records.<ref>software..(n.d.). ''Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1)''. Retrieved 2007-04-13, from Dictionary.com website: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/software</ref> Examples of computer software include: * [[Application software]] includes end-user applications of computers such as [[word processors]] or [[video game]]s, and [[ERP software]] for groups of users. * [[Middleware]] controls and co-ordinates [[distributed computing|distributed systems]]. * [[Programming language]]s define the [[syntax]] and [[semantics]] of computer programs. For example, many mature banking applications were written in the [[COBOL]] language, originally invented in 1959. Newer applications are often written in more modern programming languages. * [[System software]] includes [[operating system]]s, which govern computing resources. Today{{When|date=November 2010}} large{{quantify|date=October 2010}} applications running on remote machines such as [[Website]]s are considered{{By whom|date=November 2010}} to be system software, because{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} the end-[[user interface]] is generally through a [[graphical user interface]], such as a [[web browser]]. * [[Testware]] is software for testing hardware or a [[software package (programming)|software package]]. * [[Firmware]] is low-level software often stored on electrically programmable memory devices. Firmware is given its name because it is treated like hardware and run ("executed") by other software programs. * Shrinkware is the older name given to consumer-purchased software, because it was often sold in retail stores in a [[Shrink wrap|shrink-wrapped]] box. * [[Device drivers]] control parts of computers such as [[disk drive]]s, [[printer]]s, [[CD drive]]s, or [[computer monitor]]s. * [[Programming tool]]s help conduct computing tasks in any category listed above. For programmers, these could be tools for [[debugging]] or [[reverse engineering]] older [[legacy system]]s in order to check [[source code compatibility]]. == History == {{For|the history prior to 1946|History of computing hardware}} The first theory about software was proposed by [[Alan Turing]] in his 1935 essay ''Computable numbers with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem (Decision problem)''.<ref>Hally, Mike (2005:79).
