Wiliam Playfair's invention of the [[bar chart]], which first appeared in his ''Commercial and Political Atlas'', published in 1786. According to Beniger and Robyn (1978) "Playfair was driven to this invention by a lack of data. In his Atlas he had collected a series of 34 plates about the import and export from different countries over the years, which he presented as [[line graph]]s or surface charts: line graphs shaded or tinted between abscissa and function. Because Playfair lacked the necessary series data for Scotland, he graphed its trade data for a single year as a series of 34 bars, one for each of 17 trading partners".<ref name="JRB78"/> [[Image:Playfair Barchart.gif|center|500px]] In this bar chart Scotland's imports and exports from and to 17 countries in 1781 are represented. "This bar chart was the first quantitative graphical form that did not locate data either in space, as had coordinates and tables, or time, as had Priestley's timelines. It constitutes a pure solution to the problem of discrete quantitative comparison".<ref name="JRB78"/> ===Graphics=== [[Image:Playfair-piechart.jpg|right|thumb|240px|[[Pie chart]] from Playfair's ''Statistical Breviary'' (1801), showing the proportions of the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish Empire]] located in [[Asia]], [[Europe]] and [[Africa]] before 1789]] Playfair, who argued that charts communicated better than tables of data, has been credited with inventing the [[line chart|line]], [[bar chart|bar]], and [[pie chart]]s. His time-series plots are still presented as models of clarity. Playfair first published ''The Commercial and Political Atlas'' in London in 1786. It contained 43 time-series plots and one bar chart, a form apparently introduced in this work. It has been described as the first major work to contain statistical graphs. Playfair's ''[[Statistical Breviary]],'' published in London in 1801, contains what is generally credited as the first [[pie chart]].<ref>[[Edward R. Tufte]] (2001).
