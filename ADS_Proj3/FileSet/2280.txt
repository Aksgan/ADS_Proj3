The ''JEL'' is published quarterly by the [[American Economic Association]] (AEA) and contains survey articles and information on recently published books and dissertations. The AEA maintains [[EconLit]], a searchable data base of citations for articles, books, reviews, dissertations, and working papers classified by JEL codes for the years from 1969. An earlier AEA-sponsored print series is ''Index of Economic Articles'', indexed by author and subject. Coverage includes v. 1-7 for 1886-1965 and v. 8-36 for each year thereafter to 1996.<ref>International Business Sources," [http://www.baylor.edu/content/services/document.php/14779.pdf p. 1.] Baylor University Libraries.</ref> Many articles in economics journals also list relevant JEL codes (for example [[JEL classification codes#History of economic thought, methodology, and heterodox approaches JEL: B Subcategories|JEL: B12]]), facilitating their use across [[search engine]]s. Other extensive examples of such use include ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]] [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/advanced_search Online]'' and [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] [http://www.nber.org/jel/ Working Papers.] There are 19 main categories, each with multiple subcategories.<ref>Sourced at http://www.aeaweb.org/journal/jel_class_system.php with classification guidelines at http://www.aeaweb.org/jel/guide/jel.php.</ref><ref>An alphabetic list of links to JEL-code (sub)categories below is at [[:Category:Categories which are included in the JEL classification codes]].</ref> [[Wikipedia:categories|Wikipedia categories]] used for articles in economics mostly follow the JEL classification codes.
