A common task in applied [[statistics]] is choosing a [[parametric model]] to fit a given set of empirical observations. This necessitates an assessment of the [[goodness of fit|fit]] of the chosen model. It is usually possible to choose the model parameters in such a way that the theoretical [[population mean]] of the model is approximately equal to the [[sample mean]]. However, especially for simple models with few parameters, theoretical predictions may not match empirical observations for higher [[moment (mathematics)|moment]]s. When the observed [[variance]] is higher than the variance of a theoretical model, '''overdispersion''' has occurred. Conversely, '''underdispersion''' means that there was less variation in the data than predicted. Overdispersion is a very common feature in applied data analysis because in practice, populations are frequently [[heterogeneous]] contrary to the assumptions implicit within widely used simple parametric models. ==Examples== ===Poisson=== Overdispersion is often encountered when fitting very simple parametric models, such as those based on the [[Poisson distribution]]. The Poisson distribution has one free parameter and does not allow for the variance to be adjusted independently of the mean. The choice of a distribution from the Poisson family is often dictated by the nature of the empirical data. For example, [[Poisson regression]] analysis is commonly used to model [[count data]]. If overdispersion is a feature, an alternative model with additional free parameters may provide a better fit. In the case of the count data, a Poisson mixture model like the [[negative binomial distribution]] can be used instead where the mean of the Poisson distribution can itself be thought of as a random variable drawn - in this case - from the [[gamma distribution]] thereby introducing an additional free parameter (note the resulting negative binomial distribution has 2 parameters). ===Binomial=== As a more concrete example, it has been observed that the random number of boys born to each family do not &mdash; as might be expected &mdash; conform faithfully to a [[binomial distribution]]. Instead, each family seems to skew the sex ratio of their children in favor of either boys or girls (see, for example the [[Trivers–Willard hypothesis]] for one possible explanation) i.e. there are too many all boy families, too many all girls families, and not enough families close to the population 51:49 boy-to-girl mean ratio thereby
