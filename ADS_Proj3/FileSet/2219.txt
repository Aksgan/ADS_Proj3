for packet networks in 1962, and later, in the 1970s, for [[hierarchical routing]], concepts which have been the underpinning of the development towards today's Internet. Sutherland's successor [[Robert Taylor (computer scientist)|Robert Taylor]] convinced Roberts to build on his early packet switching successes and come and be the IPTO Chief Scientist. Once there, Roberts prepared a report called Resource Sharing Computer Networks which was approved by Taylor in June 1968 and laid the foundation for the launch of the working ARPANET the following year. After much work, the first two nodes of what would become the [[ARPANET]] were interconnected between Kleinrock's Network Measurement Center at the [[Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science|UCLA's School of Engineering and Applied Science]] and [[Douglas Engelbart|Douglas Engelbart's]] NLS system at [[SRI International]] (SRI) in [[Menlo Park, California]], on 29 October 1969. The third site on the ARPANET was the Culler-Fried Interactive Mathematics center at the University of California at Santa Barbara, and the fourth was the [[University of Utah]] Graphics Department. In an early sign of future growth, there were already fifteen sites connected to the young ARPANET by the end of 1971. The ARPANET was one of the ''eve'' networks of today's Internet. In an independent development, [[Donald Davies]] at the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|UK National Physical Laboratory]] also discovered the concept of packet switching in the early 1960s, first giving a talk on the subject in 1965, after which the teams in the new field from two sides of the Atlantic ocean first became acquainted. It was actually Davies' coinage of the wording "packet" and "packet switching" that was adopted as the standard terminology. Davies also built a packet switched network in the UK called the Mark I in 1970. <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.livinginternet.com/i/ii.htm | title=Internet History | accessdate=2010-03-10 | publisher=Living Internet site}}</ref> Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN), the private contractors for ARPANET, set out to create a separate commercial version after establishing "value added carriers" was legalized in the U.S.<ref>"Electronic post for switching data."

In the UK, this was referred to as the [[International Packet Switched Service]] (IPSS), in [[1978 in science|1978]]. The collection of [[X.25]]-based networks grew from Europe and the US to cover Canada, Hong Kong and Australia by 1981. The X.25 packet switching standard was developed in the CCITT (now called [[ITU-T]]) around 1976. [[File:Birth of the Internet.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A plaque commemorating the birth of the Internet at [[Stanford University]]]] X.25 was independent of the TCP/IP protocols that arose from the experimental work of DARPA on the ARPANET, Packet Radio Net and Packet Satellite Net during the same time period. The early ARPANET ran on the [[Network Control Program]] (NCP), implementing the host-to-host connectivity and switching layers of the protocol stack, designed and first implemented in December 1970 by a team called the Network Working Group (NWG) led by [[Steve Crocker]]. To respond to the network's rapid growth as more and more locations connected, [[Vinton Cerf]] and [[Bob Kahn|Robert Kahn]] developed the first description of the now widely used TCP protocols during 1973 and published a paper on the subject in May 1974. Use of the term "Internet" to describe a single global [[TCP/IP network]] originated in December 1974 with the publication of RFC 675, the first full specification of TCP that was written by Vinton Cerf, Yogen Dalal and Carl Sunshine, then at [[Stanford University]]. During the next nine years, work proceeded to refine the protocols and to implement them on a wide range of operating systems. The first [[Internet Protocol Suite|TCP/IP]]-based wide-area network was operational by 1 January 1983 when all hosts on the ARPANET were switched over from the older NCP protocols. In 1985, the United States' [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) commissioned the construction of the [[NSFNET]], a university 56 [[kilobit]]/second network backbone using computers called "[[Fuzzball router|fuzzballs]]" by their inventor, [[David L. Mills]]. The following year, NSF sponsored the conversion to a higher-speed 1.5 [[Mbps|megabit/second]] network. A key decision to use the DARPA [[TCP/IP]] protocols was made by Dennis Jennings, then in charge of the Supercomputer program at NSF. The opening of the NSFNET to other networks began in 1988.<ref>{{cite web |author2=Bernard Aboba |author=Vinton Cerf |title=How the Internet Came to Be |url=http://www.netvalley.com/archives/mirrors/cerf-how-inet.html |year=1993 |accessdate=2010-11-23}}</ref> The US Federal Networking Council approved the interconnection of the NSFNET to the commercial [[MCI Mail]] system in that year and the link was made in the summer of 1989. Other commercial electronic mail services were soon connected, including OnTyme, Telemail and Compuserve. In that same year, three commercial Internet service providers (ISPs) began operations: [[UUNET]], [[PSINet]], and CERFNET. Important, separate networks that offered gateways into, then later merged with, the Internet include [[Usenet]] and [[BITNET]]. Various other commercial and educational networks, such as [[Telenet]] (by that time renamed to Sprintnet), [[Tymnet]], [[Compuserve]] and [[JANET]] were interconnected with the growing Internet in the 1980s as the TCP/IP protocol became increasingly popular. The adaptability of TCP/IP to existing communication networks allowed for rapid growth. The open availability of the specifications and reference code permitted commercial vendors to build interoperable network components, such as routers, making standardized network gear available from many companies. This aided in the rapid growth of the Internet and the proliferation of local-area networking. It seeded the widespread implementation and rigorous standardization of TCP/IP on [[UNIX]] and virtually every other common operating system.
