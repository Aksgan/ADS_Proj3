The serial first appeared in issue 24 (dated September 4, 1982). The serial was created by [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] and [[John Wagner]], who scripted the early [[story arc]]s. The strip was subsequently written by [[Alan Grant (writer)|Grant]] using the pseudonym "Keith Law"<ref>[http://www.2000adonline.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=13106#p212247 2000AD Forums: "Identifying artists & writers?"]</ref>, and later by [[Scott Goodall]]. The early adventures, like most of the serials published in ''Eagle'' at the time, were [[fumetti]]s: illustrated by black-and-white photographs using actors, with text boxes and speech balloons superimposed. The photography for ''Manix'' was by [[Sven Arnstein]]. When Eagle ceased to publish fumettis and moved to a traditionally illustrated format in 1983, the art for the ''Manix'' strip was provided by [[Manuel Carmona]]. ==Plot== Manix was a [[robot]] [[secret agent]] (and originally [[assassination|assassin]]) constructed for [[British Intelligence]], designed as the ultimate agent - programmed to obey any issued order without dissent, and with a precise, logical machine intelligence, he possessed superhuman strength, speed, and durability. He also possessed x-ray vision, internal cavities to hold weapons and equipment, extensive data banks (ranging from designs of security systems to hand-held combat techniques), and was covered in [[synthetic skin]] which gave him the appearance of a normal man. In fact, his outer appearance could be modified from one mission to the next. His first mission after being activated was to [[assassinate]] his creator, '''Professor Manix'''. This was because his controller, '''Colonel Cameron''', wished for only one robot agent to exist, which he could then monopolise for his own self-serving ends. Manix undertook various missions, all designed to subtly entrench Cameron's position; he realised that his long-term survival was jeopardised by Cameron's orders, but was unable to disobey them. When ordered to assassinate '''Sir Orville Walther''' (or "O"), the head of British Intelligence, Manix was able to make his own survival impulse logically override his orders and become a "rogue robot", removing the self-destruct device Cameron had implanted and delaying the assassination long enough for Cameron to be defeated. Thereafter, Manix undertook further missions directly underneath "O" himself, including eliminating a clone of [[Adolf Hitler]] living in [[South America]], and impersonating the footballer Smithson Johns during a tour behind the [[Iron Curtain]]. A persistent opponent proved to be the terrorist organisation S.M.O.G. (or '''Society for the Militant Overthrow of all Governments'''). During the course of the strip, the Manix robot was destroyed and then replaced several times: the original 'perished' whilst pursuing a [[Mafia]] don by falling from the don's exploding helicopter into [[Mount Etna]], and his replacement being captured and re-programmed by S.M.O.G., prompting a third, improved Manix to capture and destroy the 'brainwashed' second robot. There was also a ''Mini-Manix'', a foot-high miniaturised version of Manix complete with [[dragon]] [[tattoo]]s and extensive [[Kung Fu]] skills, but which ultimately proved unreliable in the field. The strip ended with Manix completing a mission involving [[Russia]]n [[death squad]]s, with him returning to Britain to await another assignment. ==References== {{Reflist}}<!--added above External links/Sources by script-assisted edit--> ==External links== *[http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/m/manix.htm Profile on International Hero] <!--Footers--> {{Alan Grant|Manix|type=character}} [[Category:Comics by Alan Grant]] [[Category:Comics by John Wagner]] [[Category:Eagle (comic book) characters]] [[Category:Eagle (comic book) titles]] [[Category:Fictional secret agents and spies]] [[Category:Fictional robots]] [[Category:Fictional assassins]].</text> </page> <page> <id>23395</id> <title>Manu propria</title> <text>[[Image:Manu propria (large).png|thumb|Example of medieval manu propria]] [[Image:Signatur_Jodok_Pein.jpg|thumb|Jodoc Pein mppria in the [[:de:André Falquet#Adelsbrief|Certificate of Nobility for André Falquet]]]] '''Manu propria''' is a [[Latin]] phrase in the [[ablative case]] meaning "''(signed) with one's own hand''". In its [[abbreviation|abbreviated]] form ('''m.p.'''), it is sometimes used at the end of typewritten or printed documents or official notices right after the name of the person(s) who "signed" the document exactly in those cases when there is no handwritten [[signature]] there. It is also found in several ancient documents in front of or after the writers signation at the end of the document. Ordinary personal [[cheque|checks]] frequently include the abbreviation at the end of the signature line. Richly decorated manu propria was frequently used by [[medieval]] dignitaries and literates to verify [[Authentication|authenticity]] of hand written documents. Later, official documents were routinely accompanied with this abbreviation, for example [[To my people|declaration of war on Serbia]] by Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] from 1914 ends with ''m.p.''. ==Usage in the 18th century== ''mppria'' was commonly used in the 18th century.

Up until the mid 1990s, the majority of [[programming language]]s used in industry supported manual memory management. Today, however, languages with [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] are becoming increasingly popular; the main manually-managed languages still in widespread use today are [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]]. ==Description== All programming languages use manual techniques to determine when to ''allocate'' a new object from the free store. C uses the <tt>[[malloc]]</tt> function; C++ and Java use the <tt>[[new (C++)|new]]</tt> operator; determination of when an object ought to be created is trivial and unproblematic.
