Electronic document file format enhancement for accessibility'' (working in ISO Technical committee 171) There is also the ''PDF/H'', a.k.a. "PDF Healthcare", a Best Practices Guide (BPG), supplemented by an Implementation Guide (IG), published in 2008. PDF Healthcare is not a standard or proposed standard, but only a guide for use with existing standards and other technologies. It is supported by the standards development organizations [[ASTM]] and [[AIIM]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aiim.org/article.aspx?ID=31979 |title=PDF Healthcare Frequently Asked Questions |date=2006-09-25 |accessdate=2011-01-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aiim.org/Resources/Standards/Committees/PDFH |title=PDF Healthcare (PDF/H) Committee |accessdate=2011-01-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://pdf.editme.com/pdfhiguidemtls |title=PDF/H Implementation Guide Materials |accessdate=2011-01-11}}</ref> ====Full function PDF==== =====PDF 1.7===== The final revised documentation for PDF 1.7 was approved by ISO Technical Committee 171 in January 2008 and published as ISO 32000-1:2008 on July 1, 2008. PDF is now a published ISO standard, titled ''Document management—Portable document format—Part 1: PDF 1.7''. ISO 32000-1:2008 is the first ISO standard for the full function PDF. The previous ISO PDF standards (PDF/A, PDF/X, etc.) are for more specialized uses. The ISO 32000-1 includes all of the functionality previously documented in the Adobe PDF Specifications for versions 1.0 through 1.6, but it should be noted that where Adobe removed certain features of PDF from their standard, they too are not contained in PDF 1.7.<ref name="iso-standard" />{{vague|date=January 2011}} ISO 32000 document was prepared by Adobe Systems Incorporated based upon ''PDF Reference, sixth edition, Adobe Portable Document Format version 1.7, November 2006''. It was reviewed, edited and adopted, under a special fast-track procedure, by ''ISO Technical Committee 171 (ISO/TC 171), Document management application, Subcommittee SC 2, Application issues'', in parallel with its approval by the ISO member bodies. According to the ISO PDF standard abstract:<ref>ISO 32000-1:2008, Page 1, section "1 Scope"</ref> <blockquote>''ISO 32000-1:2008 specifies a digital form for representing electronic documents to enable users to exchange and view electronic documents independent of the environment in which they were created or the environment in which they are viewed or printed. It is intended for the developer of software that creates PDF files (conforming writers), software that reads existing PDF files and interprets their contents for display and interaction (conforming readers) and PDF products that read and/or write PDF files for a variety of other purposes (conforming products).'' </blockquote> =====PDF 2.0===== A new version of PDF standard is under development under the name ''ISO/NP 32000-2 - Document management—Portable document format—Part 2: PDF 2.0'' (as of January 2011).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=53041 |title=ISO/NP 32000-2 - Document management -- Portable document format -- Part 2: PDF 2.0 |date=2009-10-06 |accessdate=2010-02-24}}</ref> Adobe has submitted the ''Adobe Extension Level 5'' and ''Adobe Extension Level 3'' specifications to ISO for inclusion into the next version of the ISO 32000 specification. Adobe declared they have all been accepted for part 2 of ISO 32000.<ref name="pdf-ref" /> == Technical foundations == Anyone may create applications that can read and write PDF files without having to pay royalties to [[Adobe Systems]]; Adobe holds patents to PDF, but licenses them for [[royalty-free]] use in developing software complying with its PDF specification.<ref>[http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/support/topic_legal_notices.html partners.adobe.com - Developer Resources]</ref> The PDF combines three technologies: * A subset of the [[PostScript]] page description programming language, for generating the layout and graphics. * A font-embedding/replacement system to allow fonts to travel with the documents. * A structured storage system to bundle these elements and any associated content into a single file, with [[data compression]] where appropriate. === PostScript === [[PostScript]] is a [[page description language]] run in an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] to generate an image, a process requiring many resources. It can handle not just graphics, but standard features of programming languages such as <code>if</code> and <code>loop</code> commands. PDF is largely based on PostScript but simplified to remove flow control features like these, while graphics commands such as <code>lineto</code> remain. Often, the PostScript-like PDF code is generated from a source PostScript file. The graphics commands that are output by the PostScript code are collected and [[Lexical analysis|tokenized]]; any files, graphics, or fonts to which the document refers also are collected; then, everything is compressed to a single file. Therefore, the entire PostScript world (fonts, layout, measurements) remains intact. As a document format, PDF has several advantages over PostScript: * PDF contains tokenized and interpreted results of the PostScript source code, for direct correspondence between changes to items in the PDF page description and changes to the resulting page appearance. * PDF (from version 1.4) supports true [[transparency (graphic)|graphic transparency]]; PostScript does not. * PostScript is an [[interpretive programming|interpretive programming language]] with an implicit global state, so instructions accompanying the description of one page can affect the appearance of any following page. Therefore, all preceding pages in a PostScript document must be processed in order to determine the correct appearance of a given page, whereas each page in a PDF document is unaffected by the others. As a result, PDF viewers allow the user to quickly jump to the final pages of a long document, whereas a Postscript viewer needs to process all pages sequentially before being able to display the destination page (unless the optional PostScript [[Document Structuring Conventions]] have been carefully complied with). == Technical overview == === File structure === A PDF file consists primarily of ''objects'', of which there are eight types:<ref>Adobe Systems, PDF Reference, p. 51.</ref> * [[Boolean data type|Boolean]] values, representing ''true'' or ''false'' * Numbers * [[String (computer science)|Strings]] * Names * [[Array data type|Array]]s, ordered collections of objects * Dictionaries, collections of objects indexed by Names * [[Stream (computing)|Streams]], usually containing large amounts of data * The [[Pointer (computing)|null]] object Objects may be either ''direct'' (embedded in another object) or ''indirect''. Indirect objects are numbered with an ''object number'' and a ''generation number''. An index table called the ''xref table'' gives the byte offset of each indirect object from the start of the file.<ref>Adobe Systems, PDF Reference, pp. 39–40.</ref> This design allows for efficient [[random access]] to the objects in the file, and also allows for small changes to be made without rewriting the entire file (''incremental update''). Beginning with PDF version 1.5, indirect objects
