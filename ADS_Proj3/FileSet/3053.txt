in ''Y''.]] In [[mathematics]], a '''multivalued function''' (shortly: '''multifunction''', other names: '''set-valued function''', '''set-valued map''', '''multi-valued map''', '''multimap''', '''correspondence''', '''carrier''') is a [[left-total relation]]; i.e. every [[Input/output|input]] is associated with one or more [[output]]s. Strictly speaking, a "well-defined" [[function (mathematics)|function]] associates one, and only one, output to any particular input. The term "multivalued function" is, therefore, a [[misnomer]] since functions are single-valued. Multivalued functions often arise from functions which are not [[injective]]. Such functions do not have an [[inverse function]], but they do have an [[inverse relation]]. The multivalued function corresponds to this inverse relation. ==Examples== *Every [[real number|real]] number greater than zero or every [[complex number]] except 0 has two [[square root]]s. The square roots of 4 are in the set {+2,&minus;2}. The square roots of 0 are described by the [[multiset]] {0,0}, because 0 is a root of [[multiplicity]] 2 of the polynomial ''x''². *Each complex number has three [[cube root]]s. *The [[complex logarithm]] function is multiple-valued. The values assumed by log(1) are <math>2 \pi n i</math> for all [[integer]]s <math>n</math>. *Inverse trigonometric functions are multiple-valued because trigonometric functions are periodic. We have ::<math> \tan\left({\textstyle\frac{\pi}{4}}\right) = \tan\left({\textstyle\frac{5\pi}{4}}\right) = \tan\left({\textstyle\frac{-3\pi}{4}}\right) = \tan\left({\textstyle\frac{(2n+1)\pi}{4}}\right) = \cdots = 1. </math> :Consequently arctan(1) is intuitively related to several values: &pi;/4, 5&pi;/4, &minus;3&pi;/4, and so on. We can treat arctan as a single-valued function by restricting the domain of tan ''x'' to -&pi;/2 < ''x'' < &pi;/2 – a domain over which tan ''x'' is monotonically increasing. Thus, the range of arctan(''x'') becomes -&pi;/2 < ''x'' < &pi;/2. These values from a restricted domain are called ''[[principal value]]s''. * The [[indefinite integral]] is a multivalued function of real-valued functions. The indefinite integral of a function is the set of functions whose derivative is that function. The [[constant of integration]] comes follows from the fact that the difference between any two indefinite integrals is a constant, These are all examples of multivalued functions which come about from non-[[injective]] functions. Since the original functions do not preserve all the information of their inputs, they are not reversible. Often, the restriction of a multivalued function is a [[partial inverse]] of the original function. Multivalued functions of a complex variable have [[branch point]]s. For example the ''n''th root and logarithm functions, 0 is a branch point; for the arctangent function, the imaginary units ''i'' and &minus;''i'' are branch points. Using the branch points these functions may be redefined to be single valued functions, by restricting the range. A suitable interval may be found through use of a [[branch cut]], a kind of curve which connects pairs of branch points, thus reducing the multilayered Riemann surface of the function to a single layer. As in the case with real functions the restricted range may be called ''principal branch'' of the function. ==Riemann surfaces== A more sophisticated viewpoint replaces "multivalued functions" with functions whose domain is a [[Riemann surface]] (so named in honor of [[Bernhard Riemann]]). ==Set-valued analysis== '''Set-valued analysis''' is the generalization, to set-valued functions, of ideas from [[mathematical analysis]] and [[topology]] such as [[continuity]], [[differentiation]], [[integral|integration]], [[implicit function theorem]], [[contraction mapping]]s, [[measure theory]], [[fixed-point theorem]]s, [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]], [[topological degree theory]]. [[Equation]]s and [[inequalities]] can be generalized to [[Interval (mathematics)|intervals]] and then to [[Inclusion (set theory)|inclusions]]. ==Types of multivalued functions== One can differentiate many continuity concepts, primarily closed graph property and [[Hemicontinuity|upper and lower hemicontinuity]]. (One should be warned that often the terms upper and lower semicontinuous are used instead of upper and lower hemicontinuous reserved for the case of weak topology in domain; yet we arrive at the collision with the reserved names for [[Semicontinuity|upper and lower semicontinuous]] real-valued function). There exist also various definitions for measurability of multifunction. ==History== The practice of allowing ''function'' in mathematics to mean also ''multivalued function'' dropped out of usage at some point in the first half of the twentieth century. Some evolution can be seen in different editions of ''[[A Course of Pure Mathematics]]'' by [[G. H. Hardy]], for example. It probably persisted longest in the theory of [[special function]]s, for its occasional convenience. The theory of multivalued functions was fairly systematically developed for the first time in [http://www.gbv.de/dms/goettingen/229406319.pdf C. Berge "Topological spaces" 1963]. ==Applications== Multifunctions arise in [[Optimal control|optimal control theory]], especially [[differential inclusion]]s and related subjects as [[game theory]], where the [[Kakutani fixed point theorem]] for multifunctions has been applied to prove existence of [[Nash equilibrium|Nash equilibria]]. This amongst many other properties loosely associated with approximability of upper hemicontinuous multifunctions via continuous functions explains why upper hemicontinuity is more preferred than lower hemicontinuity. Nevertheless, lower hemicontinuous multifunctions usually possess continuous selections as stated in the [[Michael selection theorem]] which provides another characterisation of [[paracompact]] spaces (see: E. Michael, Continuous selections I" Ann. of Math. (2) 63 (1956), and D. Repovs, P.V. Semenov, Ernest Michael and theory of continuous selections" arXiv:0803.4473v1). Other selection theorems, like Bressan-Colombo directional continuous selection, Kuratowski&mdash;Ryll-Nardzewski measurable selection, Aumann measurable selection, Fryszkowski selection for decomposable maps are important in [[optimal control]] and the theory of [[differential inclusion]]s. In physics, multivalued functions play an increasingly important role. They form the mathematical basis for [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]]'s [[magnetic monopole]]s, for the theory of [[Crystallographic defect|defect]]s in crystal and the resulting [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] of materials, for [[vortex|vortices]] in [[superfluid]]s and [[superconductor]]s, and for [[phase transition]]s in these systems, for instance [[melting]] and [[quark confinement]]. They are the origin of [[gauge field]] structures in many branches of physics. ==References== * Jean-Pierre Aubin, Arrigo Cellina ''Differential Inclusions, Set-Valued Maps And Viability Theory'', Grundl. der Math.
