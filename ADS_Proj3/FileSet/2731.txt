Compared with CHAP, MS-CHAP: * is enabled by negotiating CHAP Algorithm 0x80 (0x81 for MS-CHAPv2) in LCP option 3, Authentication Protocol * provides an authenticator-controlled password change mechanism * provides an authenticator-controlled authentication retry mechanism * defines failure codes returned in the Failure packet message field MS-CHAPv2 provides mutual authentication between peers by piggybacking a peer challenge on the Response packet and an authenticator response on the Success packet. == Security Vulnerabilities and Cryptanalysis == Several weaknesses have been found in MS-CHAPv2, some of which severely reduce the complexity of brute-force attacks making them feasible with modern hardware. * [http://www.schneier.com/paper-pptpv2.pdf Cryptanalysis of Microsoft's PPTP Authentication Extensions (MS-CHAPv2)], co-written by [[Bruce Schneier]] * [http://penguin-breeder.org/pptp/download/pptp_mschapv2.pdf Exploiting known security holes in Microsoft's PPTP Authentication Extensions (MS-CHAPv2)], by Jochen Eisinger == References == * RFC 1994 - PPP Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) * RFC 2433 - MS-CHAPv1 * RFC 2548 - RADIUS Encapsulation of MS-CHAPv1 and MS-CHAPv2 * RFC 2759 - MS-CHAPv2 * [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/189771 Microsoft Knowledge Base Article KB189771] - Windows 98 Dial-Up Networking Security Upgrade Release Notes [[Category:Cryptographic protocols]] [[Category:Authentication methods]] [[Category:Internet protocols]] [[Category:Microsoft Windows security technology]] [[fr:MS-CHAP]] [[it:MS-CHAP]] [[pl:MS-CHAP]] [[ru:MS-CHAP]]</text> </page> <page> <id>23074</id> <title>MSN QnA</title> <text>{{Infobox Software| |name = MSN QnA |logo = [[Image:Windows_Live_QnA_logo.png|center|The MSN QnA logo.]] |screenshot = [[Image:WLQnA.jpg|250px|A screenshot of Live Search QnA homepage]] |caption = Live Search QnA homepage |developer = [[Microsoft]] |latest_release_version = |latest_release_date = |latest_preview_version = Beta |latest_preview_date = March 16th, 2006 to May 21st, 2009 |operating_system = |genre = Knowledge Market |license = |website = [http://qna.live.com http://qna.live.com] }} '''MSN QnA''' (formerly ''Live Search QnA'' and ''Windows Live QnA'', codenamed ''Answers''), was a question and answer service, part of [[Microsoft]]'s [[MSN]] group of services. It is somewhat similar to [[Google Answers]], but closer in function to [[Yahoo! Answers]]. Users could ask questions, tag them according to topic, and gain points and reputation for answering other users' questions. The service was community based; questions are posed to the whole community, rather than just one researcher. At this point there are apparently no plans for any monetary compensation of any kind for answering questions; rather, like with Yahoo! Answers, the only rewards are having high point counts and good reputation. In order to open an account a user needs a [[Windows Live ID]], and abide by the [http://help.live.com/help.aspx?project=tou&market=en-us&querytype=keyword&query=coc&tmt=&domain=qna.live.com Code of Conduct and Terms of Service]. All questions on MSN QnA were "tagged" by the poster to allow easy searching and navigation. The MSN QnA beta ended and the website closed on May 21st, 2009. ==Levels, Scoring and Reputation System== Users are given four days to answer a question. Questions can be rated for their usefulness once a best answer has been selected. The scoring system is weighted to encourage users to participate and answer questions. Scores are awarded by answering questions and voting for answers. Bonus scores are awarded for creating the best answer or voting for the best answer. Generally, the user's QnA score will rise more quickly if their votes are for quality answers. A user is limited to 100 votes per day. QnA users also have a [[reputation system]] under their profile that allows other users to know how likely their answer is a good one, based on the user's past performance. This is shown by the number of stars under their username. This is a lifetime rating, so all users begins with zero stars and as time passes, their reputation will change. The reputation system is based on the number of best answers given over time as a percentage of total answers given. It is also possible to affect a reputation negatively by violating the code of conduct. The account that caused the violation receives moderation and removal of content. Participants that repeatedly violate the code of conduct are moderated to a "Former Member" status and to continue in the forum are required to start a new account and lose all reputation and points from the previous account. {| class="wikitable" !Action !Scores |- |Sign in to QnA |1 |- |Vote |1 |- |Vote for winning best answer |4 |- |Rate completed question |1 |- |Answer a question |5 |- |Give best answer to a question |20 |- |Violate code of conduct | -50 |} ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- '''Level System''' # 20-499 scores # 500-999 scores # 1,000-1,999 scores # 2,000-3,999 scores # 4,000-7,999 scores # 8,000-14,999 scores # 15,000-29,999 scores # 30,000-49,999 scores # 50,000-99,999 scores # 100,000+ scores ==History== MSN QnA originally started as a [[Windows Live]]-branded service.

The driver therefore does not support the most recent releases (3.0 and above) of mSQL. mSQL-JDBC was renamed '''Soul''' in
