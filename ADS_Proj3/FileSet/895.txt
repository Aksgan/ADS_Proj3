April 2009.</ref>. == Versions == Mark IV (abbreviated MKIV) is the current version of ConTeXt. It's a development version and new features are being added constantly, but it's fully usable. There is also a frozen version called Mark II (abbreviated MKII) which is still maintained. The main difference between MKII and MKIV is that MKIV is based on the [[LuaTeX]] engine<ref>[http://www.pragma-ade.com/general/manuals/mk.pdf MKIV reference manual. (page 7)]</ref> and MKII is based on pdfTeX and XeTeX<ref>[http://www.luatex.org/support.html LuaTeX support page]. In this page there is a comment that MKII is based on pdfTeX and XeTeX while MKIV is based on LuaTeX.</ref> (although it could be select the TeX engine used in ConTeXt<ref>[http://wiki.contextgarden.net/TeX_Distributions#alternative_TeX_processors TeX processors in ConTeXt]</ref>).

Apart from the new features of MKIV, the changes between the code of MKII and MKIV are not visible in the user interface (in syntax document level).

Around 1996, Hans Hagen coined the name ConTeXt meaning "text with tex" (con-tex-t; "[[con]]" is a Latin preposition meaning "together with")<ref name="walden-hans"/>. Before 1996 ConTeXt was used only within Pragma ADE, but in 1996 it began to be adopted by a wider audience. The first users outside Pragma were [[Taco Hoekwater]], [[Berend de Boer]] and Gilbert van den Dobbelsteen, and the first user outside the Netherlands was Tobias Burnus<ref name="walden-hans"/>.

ConTeXt low-level code was originally written in Dutch. Around 2005, the ConTeXt developers began translating this to English resulting in the version known as MKII, which is now stable and frozen{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.
