Extra features such as [[multiplayer]] and [[Environmental audio extensions|EAX]] support became available in an expansion pack. ==== Display ==== *Automated [[Double Buffering]] *Full-Screen open *[[Gamma correction|Gamma Control]] ==== Input/Output ==== *Mouse, Keyboard and Gaming controller input. *[[Haptic technology#Games|Force-Feedback]] Control *System Handling *File Handling ==== Video and Audio ==== *Video Animation Control *Audio Control ==== 2D ==== *Super-Fast 2D [[blitting]] *Mirror, Stretch, Blur and Fade *Screen-Sized and animated [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] *Transparency *Fast pixel perfect Collision *2D Drawing Functions ==== 3D ==== *Landscape Terraforming *Built-in 3D Primitives *[[Polygon (computer graphics)|Polygon]] Collision Detection *Full Model Manipulation *Model Animation *[[Ambient lighting]] *Directional Lighting *[[Texture filtering]] *[[Alpha blending]] *[[Distance fog|Fogging]] ==DarkBASIC Professional== {{main|DarkBASIC Professional}} Developed as a replacement for DarkBASIC. As with DarkBASIC it consisted of an IDE, debugger and compiler. Unlike DarkBASIC, the DarkBASIC Professional compiler outputs [[Machine Code]]. The engine originally used DirectX 8.1 but has been updated to use DirectX, 9.0c. The language is essentially the same as DarkBASIC with a few additions. Notably types which allow combining simple data types into a composite data type similar to [[Struct]]s in [[C (programming language)|C]]. Other features include the use of shaders, 3D maths commands and vertex editing commands. The current version is 7.5 released 28 June 2010. {{Expand section|date=June 2008}} ===Plugin architecture=== Plugins allow extra commands to be added to the language. Plugins are [[Dynamic-link library|DLLs]] with an embedded [[Resource (Windows)|string resource]] detailing the routines implemented in the dll<ref name="TPC_SDK">[http://developer.thegamecreators.com/?f=t03/index Third Party Commands SDK]</ref>. At compile time the compiler bundles the relevant plugin dlls into the executable<ref name="DbproExeFormat">[http://winch.pinkbile.com/wiki/index.php/Main/DbproExeFormat Darkbasic pro and classic exe format information.]</ref>. Interestingly built-in commands are also implemented in the same way. This allows third party plugins access to built-in commands by calling the correct function in the relevant dll. Currently available plugins provide a wide range of addition commands from language extensions and utility functions<ref name="matrix1">[http://forum.thegamecreators.com/?m=forum_view&t=85209&b=18 Matrix1Utils plugins collection.]</ref>. to integration with [[physics engine]]s<ref name="newton">[http://walaber.com/index.php?action=showitem&id=10 NewtonDBPro] - [[Newton Game Dynamics]] plugin.</ref> or accessing a [[Database]]. ==DarkGDK== Formerly known as Dark Game SDK, DarkGDK is the DarkBASIC Professional engine packaged up for use with [[Visual C++]] or [[Microsoft .NET]]. It has been publicized as released with Visual C++ 2008, and is specially designed with [[IntelliSense]] for this edition. The DarkGDK can be used with [[Visual C++]] and is available as a free download, Games created with DarkGDK can be distributed for free, however, in order to sell your game made with DarkGDK, you must purchase a license about $499 USD. DarkGDK.NET product is available for purchase and allows access to the DarkBASIC engine from C# and VB.NET. {{Expand section|date=June 2008}} ==PureGDK== PureGDK is an implementation of the DarkBASIC Professional engine for the [[PureBasic]] programming language. Like DarkGDK, PureGDK supports many of the same features and runs on [[DirectX]] 9<ref>http://puregdk.com</ref>. An additional license for the commercial PureBasic language is required to use it. The software comes in two editions: PureGDK Upgrade and PureGDK Complete. PureGDK Upgrade is designed to accommodate existing users of DarkBasic Professional by offering a low-cost upgrade path. PureGDK Complete is a stand-alone product for users who don't already own the engine by providing licenses for both DarkBasic Professional and PureGDK. Either solution still requires the user to own or purchase a license for PureBasic. ==Sample code== ===Hello world<ref name="dbproman">Darkbasic Professional user manual</ref>=== <pre> <nowiki> PRINT "Hello world."
