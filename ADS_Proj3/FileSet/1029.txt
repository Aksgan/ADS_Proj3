[[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], each partition must start and end at a cylinder boundary. Only some of the most modern [[operating system]]s (Windows XP included) may disregard this rule, but doing so can still cause some compatibility issues, especially if the user wants to perform [[dual boot]]ing on the same drive. Microsoft does not follow this rule with internal disk partition tools since Windows Vista. <ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/931760/en-us KB931760]</ref> ==Notes== <References /> ==External links== * [http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/bridip/recovery.htm Hard Disk backup, repair, and data recovery] ==See also== * [[Cylinder (disk drive)]] * [[CD-ROM#CD-ROM format|CD-ROM format]] * [[Block (data storage)]] * [[Disk storage]] * [[Disk formatting]] * [[File Allocation Table]] * [[Disk partitioning]] * [[Logical block addressing]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Cylinder-Head-Sector}} [[Category:Advanced Technology Attachment]] [[Category:BIOS]] [[Category:Computer file systems]] [[Category:Hard disk computer storage]] [[ca:CHS]] [[cs:Cylindr-Hlava-Sektor]] [[de:Cylinder Head Sector]] [[es:CHS]] [[fr:Cylindre/Tête/Secteur]] [[ja:Cylinder head sector]] [[pl:CHS]] [[ru:CHS]] [[uk:CHS]] [[zh:CHS]]</text> </page> <page> <id>8857</id> <title>Cylindrification</title> <text>In [[computability theory]] a '''cylindrification''' is a construction which associates a [[cylindric numbering]] to each [[numbering (computability theory)|numbering]]. The concept was first introduced by [[Yuri L. Ershov]] in 1973. == Definition == Given a numbering <math>\nu</math> the '''cyclindrification''' <math>c(\nu)</math> is defined as :<math>\mathrm{Domain}(c(\nu)) := \{\langle n, k \rangle | n \in \mathrm{Domain}(\nu)\}</math> :<math>c(\nu)\langle n, k \rangle := \nu(i)</math> where <math>\langle n, k \rangle</math> is the [[Cantor pairing function]]. The cylindrification operation takes a relation as input of arity k and outputs a relation of arity k + 1 as follows : Given a relation R of arity K, its cylindrification denoted by c(R), is the following set {(a1,...,ak,a)|(a1,...,ak)belongs to R and a belongs to A}. Note that the cylindrification operation increases the arity of an input by 1. == Properties == * Given two numberings <math>\nu</math> and <math>\mu</math> then <math>\nu \le \mu \Leftrightarrow c(\nu) \le_1 c(\mu)</math> * <math>\nu \le_1 c(\nu)</math> == References == * Yu.

She is best known for her work in robotics where she is recognized as a pioneer of Social Robotics and Human Robot Interaction. ==Biography== Cynthia Breazeal received her B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] in 1989, her S.M. in 1993 and her Sc.D. in 2000 in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, both from MIT. She developed the robot [[Kismet (robot)|Kismet]] as a doctoral thesis looking into expressive social exchange between humans and [[humanoid robot]]s. Kismet is internationally recognized, and is one of the best known robots developed to explore social and emotional aspects of human-robot interaction. Now you can see Kismet at the MIT Museum where you can find some of the other robots Breazeal co-developed while a graduate student at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab. Notable examples include the upper torso humanoid robot Cog and the insect-like robot Hannibal. At the Media Lab, Breazeal continues to work on social interaction and socially situated learning between people and [[robot]]s. Leonardo is another globally recognized robot (co-developed with Stan Winston Studio) that was developed as a successor to Kismet (recognized in 2006 by Wired Magazine as one of the "50 Best Robots Ever"). Leonardo was also used to investigate social cognition and Theory of Mind abilities on robots with application to human-robot collaboration, in addition to developing social learning abilities for robots such as imitation, tutelage, and social referencing. Nexi is the most recent robot in this tradition (awarded a TIME Magazine 50 Best Inventions of 2008). Nexi is a MDS robot (Mobile, Dexterous, Social) that combines rich social communication abilities with mobile dexterity to investigate more complex forms of human-robot teaming. Other social robots developed in Breazeal's Personal Robots Group include Autom, a robot diet and exercise coach (the PhD thesis of Cory Kidd). It was found to be more effective than a computer counterpart in sustaining engagement and building trust and a working alliance with users. Autom is in the process of being commercialized (see Intuitive Automata). Breazeal's group has also explored expressive remote presence robots (for example, MeBot and Huggable). The physical social embodiment of the MeBot was found to elicit greater psychological involvement, engagement, and desire to cooperate over purely screen based video conferencing or a mobile screen. Breazeal's Personal Robots Group has also done a number of design projects. See [[Cyberflora]] that was exhibited at the 2003 National Design Triennial at the Smithsonian Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum. Breazeal is recognized as a designer and innovator on the national and global stage. She received the Gilbreth Lectures Award by the National Academy of Engineering in 2008. She has spoken at a number of prominent global events including the World Science Festival, the World Economic Forum, and TEDWomen. Breazeal is a featured scientist in the Women's Adventures in Science series (sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences). In 2003, Breazeal was recognized as a Finalist in the National Design Awards in Communication at the White House. She is an Overseer at the Museum of Science in Boston, and she is on the Board of Advisors of the Science Channel. She also has a prominent role as a virtual participant in a popular exhibit on robots with the traveling exhibit, [[Star Wars: Where Science Meets Imagination]], interacting with a real [[C-3PO]] (voiced by [[Anthony Daniels]] as she spoke to the audience through a pre-recorded message displayed on a large plasma flat-screen display. ==Selected works == ==== Books ==== *{{cite book |first=Cynthia|last=Breazeal| title=Designing Sociable Robots | year=2002 | publisher=The MIT Press | isbn=0-262-02510-8 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=402dquhxSTQC&printsec=frontcover}} *{{cite book | first=Cynthia|last=Breazeal | coauthors = Bar-Cohen, Yoseph | title = Biologically Inspired Intelligent Robots | year = 2003 | publisher = SPIE (The International Society for
