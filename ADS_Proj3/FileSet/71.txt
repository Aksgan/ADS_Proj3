the [[elative]], which means "from out of" or "from the inside of"). In the locative meaning, the receding object was near the other place or object, not inside it. The Finnish ablative is also used in time expressions to indicate start times as well as with verbs expressing feelings or emotions. The Finnish ablative has the ending -lta or -ltä according to the regular rules of [[vowel harmony]]. Usage * away from a place ::Katolta :::Off the roof ::Pöydältä :::Off the table ::Rannalta :::From the beach ::Maalta :::From the land ::Mereltä :::From the sea * to stop some activity with the verb lähteä ::lähteä tupakalta :::stop smoking (in the sense of putting out the cigarette one is smoking now; literally 'leave from the tobacco') ::lähteä hippasilta :::stop playing the game of tag (hippa=tag, olla hippasilla=playing tag) * to smell/taste/feel/look/sound like something ::haisee pahalta :::smells bad ::maistuu hyvältä :::tastes good ::tuntuu kamalalta :::feels awful ::näyttää tyhmältä :::looks stupid ::kuulostaa mukavalta :::sounds nice ===Hungarian=== The ablative case in Hungarian is used to describe '''movement away from a solid object'''. For example, if one is walking away from a friend one could say: ''a barátom'''tól''' jövök'' - I am coming (away from) my friend. Note that this case in this example implies that the user was ''next to'' the solid object, and not inside it. This means that if one said ''a postától jövök'' it would mean one is coming from being stood ''next to'' the post office, and that you were not inside the building. The application of [[vowel harmony]] gives two different suffixes: '''-tól''' and '''-től'''. These are applied to back- and front-vowel words respectively. Its partners for movement towards a solid object and for being next to that solid object are the [[allative case]] and the [[adessive case]] respectively. Its partners that correspond to movement away from, or out of, something are the [[delative case]] (for movement from a surface or from a Hungarian city) and the [[elative case]] (for movement out of a container or from out of an international city). ==Altaic languages== ===Azeri=== The ablative in [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]] (''{{Lang|az|çıxışlıq hal}}'') is expressed through the suffixes ''-dan'' or ''-dən''. Examples: Ev - ev'''dən''' <br>''House - from/off the house'' Aparmaq - aparmaq'''dan''' <br>''To carry - from/off carrying'' ===Turkish=== The ablative in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] (''-den hali'' or ''uzaklaşma hali'') is expressed through the suffixes ''-den'', ''-dan'', ''-ten'', or ''-tan''. Examples: Ev - ev'''den''' <br>''House - from/off the house'' At - at'''tan''' <br>''Horse - from/off the horse'' Taşımak - taşımak'''tan''' <br>''To carry - from/off carrying'' Ses - ses'''ten''' <br>''Sound/volume - from/off sound/volume'' <br>In some situations simple ablative can have a ”because of” meaning, in this situations ablative + ”dolayı” (because of) preposition is optional. Yüksek sesten (dolayı) rahatsız oldum. / ''I was uneasy because of high volume.

The intended audience is the general public, rather than science academics. ''About Time'' explores selected mysteries of [[spacetime]], following on from [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]], which Davies believes does not fully explain time as humans experience it. The author explains <blockquote> Important though Einstein's time turned out to be, it still did not solve "the riddle of time". </blockquote> The book delves into the nature of [[metaphysics]], time, motion and [[gravity]], covering a wide range of aspects surrounding the current [[cosmological]] [[debate]], across 283 pages in great detail. It includes an [[Index (publishing)|index]], a [[bibliography]], and numerous [[diagram]]s. ==See also== *[[Basic introduction to the mathematics of curved spacetime]] *[[Sense of time]] *''[[The Mind of God]]'' [[Category:1995 books]] [[Category:Science books]] [[Category:Physics books]] {{science-book-stub}} [[it:I misteri del tempo]]</text> </page> <page> <id>698</id> <title>Aboutness</title> <text>{{Citation style}} '''Aboutness''' is a term used in library and information science (LIS), linguistics, philosophy of language, and philosophy of mind. In LIS, it is often considered synonymous with [[subject (discourse)]]. In philosophy it has been often considered synonymous with [[intentionality]], perhaps since [[John Searle]] (1983). R. A. Fairthorne (1969) is credited with coining the exact term "aboutness," which became popular in LIS since the late 1970s, perhaps due to arguments put forward by [[William John Hutchins]] (1975, 1977, 1978). Hutchins argued that "aboutness" was to be preferred to "subject" because it removed some epistemological problems. Hjørland (1992, 1997) argued, however, that the same epistemological problems also were present in Hutchins's proposal, why "aboutness" and "subject" should be considered synonymous. While information scientists may well be concerned with the literary aboutness (John Hutchins, 1975, 1977, 1978), philosophers of mind and psychologists with the psychological or [[intentionality|intentional]] aboutness (John Searle, 1983) and [[language of thought]] (Jerry Fodor, 1975), and [[semantic externalism|semantic externalists]] with the external state of affairs (Hilary Putnam, 1975). These seminal perspectives are respectively analogous to [[C. K. Ogden|Ogden]] and [[I. A. Richards|Richards]]' ''literary, psychological, and external contexts'' (1923), as well as [[Karl Popper]]'s ''World 1, 2, and 3 (1977). In linguistics, aboutness is simply meaning, the end of language. In psychology, it is [[intentionality]]. In [[psycholinguistics]] or [[cognitive linguistics]], it is [[language of thought]] in vogue, or something like that. ==Verbal context== {{Empty section|date=July 2010}} ==Mental context== {{Empty section|date=July 2010}} ==Original context== {{Empty section|date=July 2010}} ==See also== * [[Subject matter]] * [[Content analysis]] * [[Theme and rheme]] * [[Intentionality]] * [[Language of thought]] ==Literature== * Furner, J.
