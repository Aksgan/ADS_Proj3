diameter of the point cloud; for each value of the parameter, the shape is approximated as the union of line segments, triangles, and tetrahedra defined by 2, 3, or 4 of the points respectively such that there exists a sphere of radius at most alpha containing only the defining points. Another heavily cited paper, also with Mücke, concerns “simulation of simplicity.” This is a technique for automatically converting algorithms that work only when their inputs are in [[general position]] (for instance, algorithms that may misbehave when some three input points are collinear) into algorithms that work robustly, correctly, and efficiently in the face of special-position inputs. Edelsbrunner has also made important contributions to algorithms for intersections of [[line segment]]s, construction of [[K-set (geometry)|K-set]]s, the [[ham sandwich theorem]], [[Delaunay triangulation]], [[point location]], [[interval tree]]s, [[fractional cascading]], and [[Docking (molecular)|protein docking]].<ref>{{citation|title=‘Computer-chemistry’ Yields New Insight Into A Puzzle Of Cell Division|journal=Science Daily|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/12/051208231229.htm|date=December 9, 2005}}.</ref> ==References== {{reflist}} {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME = Edelsbrunner, Herbert | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH = 1958 | PLACE OF BIRTH = | DATE OF DEATH = | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Edelsbrunner, Herbert}} [[Category:1958 births]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:American computer scientists]] [[Category:Austrian computer scientists]] [[Category:University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign faculty]] [[Category:Duke University faculty]] [[Category:Researchers in geometric algorithms]] [[Category:Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] [[Category:Fellows of the Leopoldina]]</text> </page> <page> <id>16561</id> <title>Hereditarily finite set</title> <text>In [[mathematics]] and [[set theory]], '''hereditarily finite sets''' are defined [[recursion|recursively]] as [[finite set]]s consisting of 0 or more hereditarily finite sets. ==Formal definition== A recursive definition of a hereditarily finite set goes as follows: : ''Base case'': The empty set is a hereditarily finite set. : ''Recursion rule'': If ''a''<sub>1</sub>,...,''a''<sub>''k''</sub> are hereditarily finite, then so is {''a''<sub>1</sub>,...,''a''<sub>''k''</sub>}. The set of all hereditarily finite sets is denoted ''V''<sub>ω</sub>. If we denote ''P''(''S'') for the [[power set]] of ''S'', ''V''<sub>ω</sub> can also be constructed by first taking the empty set written ''V''<sub>0</sub>, then ''V''<sub>1</sub> = ''P''(''V''<sub>0</sub>), ''V''<sub>2</sub> = ''P''(''V''<sub>1</sub>),..., ''V''<sub>''k''</sub> = ''P''(''V''<sub>''k''&minus;1</sub>),... Then :<math>\bigcup_{k=0}^{\infty} V_k = V_\omega.</math> ==Discussion== The hereditarily finite sets are a subclass of the [[Von Neumann universe]]. They are a [[model theory|model]] of the axioms consisting of the [[Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms|axioms of set theory]] with the [[axiom of infinity]] replaced by its negation, thus proving that the axiom of infinity is not a consequence of the other axioms of set theory. Notice that there are [[countably]] many hereditarily finite sets, since ''V<sub>n</sub>'' is finite for any finite ''n'' (its [[cardinality]] is <sup>''n''&minus;1</sup>2, see [[tetration]]), and the union of countably many finite sets is countable. Equivalently, a set is hereditarily finite if and only if its [[transitive set|transitive closure]] is finite. V<sub>ω</sub> is also symbolized by <math>H_{\aleph_0}</math>, meaning hereditarily of cardinality less than <math>\aleph_0</math>. ==See also== *[[Hereditarily countable set]] [[Category:Set theory]] [[zh:继承有限集合]]</text> </page> <page> <id>16564</id> <title>Herfindahl index</title> <text>{{About|the economic measure|the index of scientific prolificacy|H-index}} {{Refimprove|date=April 2009}} The '''Herfindahl index''' (also known as '''Herfindahl–Hirschman Index''', or '''HHI''') is a measure of the size of [[corporation|firm]]s in relation to the [[industry]] and an indicator of the amount of competition among them. Named after economists [[Orris C. Herfindahl]] and [[Albert O. Hirschman]], it is an [[economics|economic]] concept widely applied in [[competition law]], [[antitrust]]<ref>''Merger Guidelines'' § 1.51</ref> and also technology management.<ref> Catherine Liston-Hayes, Alan Pilkington, [http://dx.doi.org/10.3152/147154304781780190 “Inventive Concentration: An Analysis of Fuel Cell Patents,”] Science and Public Policy, (2004). Vol. 31, No. 1, p.15-25.</ref> It is defined as the sum of the squares of the [[market share]]s of the 50 largest firms (or summed over all the firms if there are fewer than 50)<ref>[http://www.pearsoned.ca/highered/divisions/bande/parkin/solutions/soluch09.pdf Chapter 9 Organizing Production]</ref> within the industry, where the market shares are expressed as fractions. The result is proportional to the average market share, weighted by market share. As such, it can range from 0 to 1.0, moving from a huge number of very small firms to a single [[monopoly|monopolistic]] producer. Increases in the Herfindahl index generally indicate a decrease in competition and an increase of [[market power]], whereas decreases indicate the opposite. The major benefit of the Herfindahl index in relationship to such measures as the [[concentration ratio]] is that it gives more weight to larger firms. The measure is essentially equivalent to the [[Simpson diversity index]] used in ecology. ==Example== For instance, two cases in which the six largest firms produce 90 % of the goods in a market: * Case 1: All six firms produce 15% each, and * Case 2: One firm produces 80 % while the five others produce 2 % each. We will assume that the remaining 10% of output is divided among 10 equally sized producers. The six-firm concentration ratio would equal 90 % for both case 1 and case 2. But the first case would promote significant competition, where the second case approaches [[monopoly]]. The Herfindahl index for these two situations makes the lack of competition in the second case strikingly clear: * Case 1: Herfindahl index = 6 * 0.15<sup>2</sup> + 10 * 0.01<sup>2</sup> = 0.136 (13.6%) * Case 2: Herfindahl index = 0.80<sup>2</sup> + 5 * 0.02<sup>2</sup> + 10 * 0.01<sup>2</sup> = 0.643 (64.3%) This behavior rests in the fact that the market shares are squared prior to being summed, giving additional weight to firms with larger size. The index involves taking the market share of the respective market competitors, squaring it, and adding them together (e.g. in the market for X, company A has 30%, B, C, D, E and F have 10% each and G through to Z have 1% each). If the resulting figure is above a certain threshold then economists consider the market to have a high concentration (e.g. market X's concentration is 0.142 or 14.2%). This threshold is considered to be 0.18 in the US,<ref>''Merger Guidelines'' § 1.51</ref> while the EU prefers to focus on the level of change, for instance that concern is raised if there's a 0.025 change when the index already shows a concentration of 0.1.<ref>However, it gets far more complicated than that.
