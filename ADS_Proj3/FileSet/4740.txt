He eventually became the chief architect of application development methodology for [[IBM]]'s consulting group. The annual [[Stevens Award]] Lecture on Software Development Methods is named after him. He belonged to the [[IEEE]] and the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] as well as the following honorary societies: [[Tau Beta Pi]], [[Sigma Xi]], and [[Eta Kappa Nu]]. He wrote a seminal paper on [[Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method|Structured Design]], with [[Larry Constantine]] and Glenford Myers, and was the author of a number of books and articles on application design methodologies. He also worked with [[John Paul Morrison]] to refine and promote the concepts of what is now called [[Flow-based programming]], including descriptions of FBP in several of these references. == Publications == Stevens published several articles and books, including: * 1982.

After the measurement the measuring device pointer is shifted by what is called the "weak value". So that a pointer initially pointing at zero before the measurement would point at the weak value after the measurement. The system is not disturbed by the measurement. Although this may seem to contradict some basic aspects of quantum theory, the formalism lies within the boundaries of the theory and does not contradict any fundamental concept. The idea of weak measurements and weak values, first developed by [[Yakir Aharonov]], [[David Albert]] and [[Lev Vaidman]] <ref>Y. Aharonov, D.Z. Albert, L. Vaidman, "How the result of a measurement of a component of the spin of a spin-1/2 particle can turn out to be 100," Physical Review Letters, 1988. [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v60/i14/p1351_1]</ref> is especially useful for gaining information about pre- and post-selected systems described by the [[Quantum state|two state vector formalism]].<ref>Y. Aharonov and L. Vaidman in Time in Quantum Mechanics, J.G. Muga et al. eds., (Springer) 369-412 (2002) [http://il.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0105101 quant-ph/0105101]</ref> Since a "strong" perturbative measurement can both upset the outcome of the post-selection and tamper with all subsequent measurement, weak nonperturbative measurements may be used to learn about such systems during their evolution. If <math>|\phi_1\rangle</math> and <math>|\phi_2\rangle</math> are the pre- and post-selected quantum mechanical states, the ''weak value'' of the observable <math>\hat{\mathbf{A}}</math> is defined as :<math> A_w = \frac{\langle\phi_1|\hat{\mathbf{A}}|\phi_2\rangle}{\langle\phi_1|\phi_2\rangle}.</math> The weak value of the observable becomes large when the post-selected state, <math>|\phi_2\rangle</math>, approaches being orthogonal to the pre-selected state, <math>|\phi_1\rangle</math>. In this way, by properly choosing the two states, the weak value of the operator can be made arbitrarily large, and otherwise small effects can be amplified.<ref>O. Hosten and P. Kwiat ''Observation of the spin Hall effect of light via weak measurements'' Science '''319''' 787 (2008) [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sci;319/5864/787?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&andorexacttitleabs=and&andorexactfulltext=and&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&volume=319&firstpage=787&resourcetype=HWCIT]</ref> Note that the theory of weak measurement allows [[Hardy's paradox]] to be explained. In Hardy's paradox a positron and an electron go down both arms of each of their interferometers. If they meet in the overlapping arms, they should annihilate each other. But, strangely, they are still registered as arriving at the detectors.<ref> J. S. Lundeen, A. M. Steinberg, "Experimental Joint Weak Measurement
