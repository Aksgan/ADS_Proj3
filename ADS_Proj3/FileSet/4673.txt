In addition, vMotion now allows customers to move more than one VM at a time from server host to server host. * ==See also== * [[Cloud computing]] * [[VMware Infrastructure]] * [[VMware VMFS]], the VMware SAN file system * [[List of VMware software]] * [[Virtual machine]] * [[Platform virtualization]] ==Reference list== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.vmware.com/products/vi/ VMware Infrastructure product page] - VMware, Inc. {{DEFAULTSORT:Vmware Vsphere}} [[Category:VMware]] [[Category:Virtualization software]] [[Category:Proprietary software]]</text> </page> <page> <id>39144</id> <title>VP-tree</title> <text>A '''vantage point tree''', or '''vp-tree''' is a [[Binary space partitioning|BSP tree]] that segregates data in a [[metric space]] by choosing a position in the space (the "vantage point") and dividing the data points into two partitions: those that are nearer to the vantage point than a threshold, and those that are not. By repeatedly applying this procedure to partition the data into smaller and smaller sets, a [[Tree (data structure)|tree data structure]] is created where neighbors in the tree are likely to be neighbors in the space.<ref name="pny93">{{cite conference | first = Peter N. | last = Yianilos | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Data structures and algorithms for nearest neighbor search in general metric spaces | booktitle = Proceedings of the fourth annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete algorithms | pages = 311–321 | publisher = Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Philadelphia, PA, USA | year = 1993 | location = | url = http://pnylab.com/pny/papers/vptree/vptree/ | accessdate = 2008-08-22 | id = pny93 }}</ref> This iterative partitioning process is similar to that of a [[kd-tree]], but uses circular (or spherical, hyperspherical, etc.) rather than rectilinear partitions. In 2D Euclidean space, this can be visualized as a series of circles segregating the data. The vp-tree is particularly useful in dividing data in a non-standard metric space into a [[Binary space partitioning|BSP tree]]. ==References== <references/> {{CS-Trees}} [[Category:Trees (structure)]] {{datastructure-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>39147</id> <title>VP8 Image Analyzer</title> <text>The '''VP8 Image Analyzer'''<ref>http://shroudnm.com/docs/SEAM-VP8-Presentation.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.shroud.com/78strp10.htm</ref> is an [[analog computer]] produced by Pete Schumacher of Interpretations Systems Incorporated (ISI) in 1972.<ref>http://shroudnm.com/vp8talk.html</ref><ref>http://ShroudNM.com/pics.html</ref><ref>http://shroudnm.com/docs/1999-05-Shroud-Photogrammetric-Responses.pdf</ref> An analog computer simply processes an image and provides the result - the output cannot be manipulated, unlike [[digital computers]]. The VP8 makes a brightness map of whatever data it processes - white appears to be higher in elevation, black appears lower and mid-range appears between these two extremes.<ref>Bernard Ruffin, 1999, The Shroud of Turin ISBN 0879736178 page 79</ref><ref> Heller, John H. ''Report on the Shroud of Turin''. Houghton Mifflin, 1983. ISBN 0395339677 page 207</ref> The VP8 does not create 3D images, but rather creates brightness maps. It was delivered by Schumacher to John Jackson's basement and when they processed the image through the VP8, the results they saw were extraordinary.<ref>http://shroudnm.com/vp8talk.html</ref> Air Force Academy Professors John Jackson and Eric Jumper (future members of the [[STURP]] team) who used it to analyze the [[Shroud of Turin]] and used the data from that analysis to create a cardboard model of the Shroud.<ref>http://shroudnm.com/docs/SEAM-VP8-Presentation.pdf</ref> When the VP8 processes the data from the Shroud, the result is a 3-Dimensional image.<ref>http://ShroudNM.com (created & maintained by Andy Weiss) is the online presence of the Shroud Exhibit and Museum - SEAM (the only museum in the world where one can walk in and interact with the VP8). SEAM was created by Pete Schumacher, production engineer of the VP8 Image Analyzer</ref> The work of Jackson, Jumper and Schumacher prove that the image on the Shroud of Turin is encoded with 3-Dimensional data. What is most interesting about this image is that it resides on the very top 1 or 2 microfibers of the fiber. The image exists because the cellulose of these top microfibers dehydrated or aged differently than the rest of the cloth. Modern science does not understand the process by which the image on the Shroud was formed and all duplication efforts have all failed to duplicate all the peculiar properties of the Shroud of Turin image.<ref>http://shroudnm.com/docs/SEAM-VP8-Presentation.pdf</ref><ref>http://shroudnm.com/docs/SEAM-Shroud-of-Turin-Presentation.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.shroud.com/library.htm</ref> ==Notes== {{Reflist}} ==See also== * [[Shroud of Turin]] [[Category: History of computing hardware]] [[Category:Shroud of Turin]] {{compu-hardware-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>39153</id> <title>VRML</title> <text>:''For successor, see [[X3D]].'' {{Infobox file format |name=VRML |icon = |logo = |screenshot = |caption = |extension = .wrl (plain)<br/>.wrz (compression) |mime = model/vrml<br/>x-world/x-vrml<br/>application/x-cc3d |type code = |uniform type = |magic = |owner = |released = |latest release version = 2.0 |latest release date = |genre = [[3D computer graphics]] |container for = |contained by = |extended from = Labyrinth |extended to = |standard = [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 14772-1:1997 |url = [http://www.web3d.org/x3d/vrml/ www.web3d.org/x3d/vrml] }} '''VRML''' ('''[[Virtual reality|Virtual Reality]] Modeling Language''', pronounced ''vermal'' or by its initials, originally—before 1995—known as the Virtual Reality Markup Language) is a standard [[file format]] for representing [[3-D computer graphics|3-dimensional]] (3D) interactive [[vector graphics]], designed particularly with the [[World Wide Web]] in mind.
