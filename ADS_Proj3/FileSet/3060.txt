MyBatis is [[free software]] that is distributed under the [[Apache License]] 2.0. MyBatis was formerly known as [[iBATIS]]. == Feature Summary == Unlike [[Object-relational mapping|ORM]] frameworks MyBatis does not try to map an object model to a relational [[database]], it just maps [[SQL]] statements to plain objects. This makes MyBatis an easy to use tool and also a good choice for legacy or denormalized databases or just to have full control of [[SQL]] execution. MyBatis makes database access code much easier than for [[JDBC]]. Usually one line of code is all that is needed to execute a [[SQL]] statement. This saves time and prevents common mistakes like leaving a connection opened, coding a wrong data mapping, exceeding the limits of a result set or getting more than one result when just one was expected. The main feature of MyBatis is its simplicity because it is based on plain objects, [[XML]] and [[SQL]]. MyBatis not only maps beans to database data but can also map [[SQL]] statements to interface methods (known as mappers). This, combined with a [[dependency injection]] [[framework]], allows to build business code free of dependencies and even without any call
