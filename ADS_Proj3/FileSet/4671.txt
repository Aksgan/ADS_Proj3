Video signals converted on this kind of unit range from [[S-Video]] to [[component video]] signals. Some VGA boxes have audio outputs on them so that they can also act as plug adapters for [[RCA connector|RCA]] audio inputs to use [[computer speaker]]s. Some models of VGA boxes allow a computer with a multi pin high-resolution port to use them on other occasions. Others models include devices that convert VGA signals to composite, S-video or [[component video]], as well as [[SCART]] in [[Europe]]. People have used video this type of device so they can use their [[game console]]s, [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]]s and [[DVD player]]s on their computer monitor. Though in the modern world, media on those formats is feasible to convert to a format playable directly off the computer, sometimes through the opposite function of displaying computer output on a standard NTSC TV with composite/s-video. Also there is an object called vga to rca converter which converts normal vga to vga to rca which allows you to view multiple screens on different devices [[Category:Video game hardware]] {{videogame-hardware-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>39119</id> <title>VH Dissector</title> <text>{{advert|date=August 2010}} {{ infobox software | name = VH Dissector | screenshot = [[File:VH Dissector Screenshot.png|300px]] | caption = VH Dissector running on [[Mac OS X]] 10.6.4 | developer = Touch of Life Technologies | latest release version = 4.7.7 | operating system = <!-- Please specify the exact name and version --> | platform = [[Mac OS X]], [[Microsoft Windows]] | language = English, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese | license = Proprietary software | website = [http://www.toltech.net/products/vh_dissector/index.htm VH Dissector Page] }} The VH Dissector is a software application for anatomy instruction and visualization created by Touch of Life Technologies.

The VH Dissector provides a simulated dissection experience by allowing the user to add and remove structures from the 3D dissection. As well, structures within the dissection and cross sections can be highlighted for better visualization. The dissector contains a content development and presentation platform also, in the form of lessons integrated into the VH Dissector.
