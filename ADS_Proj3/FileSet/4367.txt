in Science and Technology Studies (STS), philosophy of technology, and various sub-areas of Applied Ethics which focus on technology. The term “Technoethics” was coined in by the philosopher Mario Bunge to describe the responsibilities of technologists and scientists to develop ethics as a branch of technology (Bunge, 1977). Bunge argued that the current state of technological progress was guided by ungrounded practices based on limited empirical evidence and trial-and-error learning. He recognized that “the technologist must be held not only technically but also morally responsible for whatever he designs or executes: not only should his artifacts be optimally efficient but, far from being harmful, they should be beneficial, and not only in the short run but also in the long term.” He recognized a pressing need in society to create a new field called ‘Technoethics’ to discover rationally grounded rules for guiding science and technological progress. The early development of Technoethics is rooted in the cross-fertilization of sub-areas of [[Philosophy of Technology]], [[Applied Ethics]], and [[Science and Technology Studies]] (STS), which focus on the interconnection of technology and [[ethics]] embedded in society. Key scholarly contributions linking ethics, technology, and society can be found in a number of seminal works: The Imperative of Responsibility: In Search of Ethics for the Technological Age (Jonas, 1979), On Technology, Medicine and Ethics (Jonas, 1985), The Real World of Technology (Franklin, 1990), Thinking Ethics in Technology: Hennebach Lectures and Papers, 1995-1996 (Mitcham, 1997), Technology and the Good Life (Higgs, Light & Strong, 2000), and Readings in the Philosophy of Technology (Kaplin, 2004), and Ethics and technology: Ethical issues in an age of information and [[communication technology]] (Tavani, 2004.). This resulting scholarly attention to ethical issues arising from technological transformations of work and life has helped given rise to a number of key areas (or branches) of technoethical inquiry under various research programs (I.e., [[computer ethics]], [[engineering ethics]], environmental Technoethics, [[biotech]] ethics, [[Nanoethics]], educational Technoethics, information and [[communication ethics]], [[media ethics]], and [[Internet ethics]]). ==Recent developments== Despite the amassing body of scholarly work related to Technoethics beginning in the 1970s, Technoethics became institutionalized and recognized only recently as an important interdisciplinary research area and field of study. In 1998, the Epson Foundation founded the Instituto de Tecnoética in Spain under the direction of Josep Esquirol. This institute has actively promoted technoethical scholarship through awards, conferences, and publications (see Esquirol, 2002, 2003). This helped encourage scholarly work for a largely European audience. The major driver for the emergence of Technoethics can be attributed to the publication of major reference works available in English and circulated gloabally. The Encyclopedia of Science, Technology, and Ethics (Mitcham, 2005) included a section on Technoethics which helped bring it into mainstream philosophy. This helped to raise further interest leading to the publication of the first reference volume in the English language dedicated to the emerging field of Technoethics. The two volume Handbook of Research on Technoethics (Luppicini & Adell, 2008) explores the complex connections between ethics and the rise of new technologies (E.g., life-preserving technologies, [[stem cell research]], cloning technologies, new forms of [[surveillance]] and [[anonymity]], [[computer networks]], Internet advancement, etc.). This recent major collection provides the first comprehensive examination of Technoethics and its various branches from over 50 scholars around the globe. The emergence of Technoethics can be juxtaposed with a number of other innovative interdisciplinary areas of scholarship which have surfaced in recent years such as [[technoscience]] and [[technocriticism]]. ==References== Bao, Z. & Xiang, K.
