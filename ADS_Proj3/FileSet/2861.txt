the vibrations into electrical pulses that travel to the ultrasonic scanner where they are processed and transformed into a digital image. === Forming the image === The sonographic scanner must determine three things from each received echo: # How long it took the echo to be received from when the sound was transmitted. # From this the focal length for the phased array is deduced, enabling a sharp image of that echo at that depth (this is not possible while producing a sound wave). # How strong the echo was. It could be noted that sound wave is not a click, but a pulse with a specific carrier frequency. Moving objects change this frequency on reflection, so that it is only a matter of electronics to have simultaneous [[Medical ultrasonography#Doppler sonography|Doppler sonography]]. Once the ultrasonic scanner determines these three things, it can locate which pixel in the image to light up and to what intensity and at what [[hue]] if frequency is processed (see [[redshift]] for a natural mapping to hue). Transforming the received signal into a digital image may be explained by using a blank spreadsheet as an analogy. First picture a long, flat transducer at the top of the sheet. Send pulses down the 'columns' of the spreadsheet (A, B, C, etc.). Listen at each column for any return echoes. When an echo is heard, note how long it took for the echo to return. The longer the wait, the deeper the row (1,2,3, etc.). The strength of the echo determines the brightness setting for that cell (white for a strong echo, black for a weak echo, and varying shades of grey for everything in between.) When all the echoes are recorded on the sheet, we have a greyscale image. === Displaying the image === Images from the sonographic scanner can be displayed, captured, and broadcast through a computer using a [[frame grabber]] to capture and digitize the analog video signal. The captured signal can then be post-processed on the computer itself.<ref>http://www.epiphan.com/solutions_new/?arid=42 Capture and Store Gynecological Ultrasounds</ref> ''For computational details see also'': [[Confocal laser scanning microscopy]], [[Radar]], == Sound in the body == [[Image:UltrasoundProbe2006a.jpg|frame|right|Linear Array Transducer]] Ultrasonography ([[sonography]]) uses a probe containing one or more acoustic [[transducer]]s to send pulses of sound into a material. Whenever a sound wave encounters a material with a different density (acoustical impedance), part of the sound wave is reflected back to the probe and is detected as an echo. The time it takes for the [[Echo (phenomenon)|echo]] to travel back to the probe is measured and used to calculate the depth of the tissue interface causing the echo. The greater the difference between acoustic impedances, the larger the echo is. If the pulse hits gases or solids, the density difference is so great that most of the acoustic energy is reflected and it becomes impossible to see deeper. The frequencies used for medical imaging are generally in the range of 1 to 18 MHz. Higher frequencies have a correspondingly smaller wavelength, and can be used to make sonograms with smaller details. However, the attenuation of the sound wave is increased at higher frequencies, so in order to have better penetration of deeper tissues, a lower frequency (3-5 MHz) is used. Seeing deep into the body with sonography is very difficult. Some acoustic energy is lost every time an echo is formed, but most of it (approximately <math>\textstyle 0.3 \frac{\mbox{dB}}{\mbox{cm depth}\cdot\mbox{MHz}}</math>) is lost from acoustic absorption. The speed of sound varies as it travels through different materials, and is dependent on the [[Acoustic impedance|acoustical impedance]] of the material. However, the sonographic instrument assumes that the acoustic velocity is constant at 1540 m/s. An effect of this assumption is that in a real body with non-uniform tissues, the beam becomes somewhat de-focused and image resolution is reduced. To generate a [[wiktionary:2d|2D]]-image, the ultrasonic beam is swept. A transducer may be swept mechanically by rotating or swinging. Or a 1D [[phased array]] transducer may be use to sweep the beam electronically. The received data is processed and used to construct the image. The image is then a 2D representation of the slice into the body. [[3D computer graphics|3D]] images can be generated by acquiring a series of adjacent 2D images. Commonly a specialised probe that mechanically scans a conventional 2D-image transducer is used. However, since the mechanical scanning is slow, it is difficult to make 3D images of moving tissues. Recently, 2D phased array transducers that can sweep the beam in 3D have been developed. These can image faster and can even be used to make live 3D images of a beating heart. [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] ultrasonography is used to study blood flow and muscle motion. The different detected speeds are represented in color for ease of interpretation, for example leaky heart valves: the leak shows up as a flash of unique color. Colors may alternatively be used to represent the amplitudes of the received echoes. ==Modes of sonography== Several different modes of ultrasound are used in medical imaging.<ref>The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine, 2nd Edition Volume 1 A-B. Page no.4</ref> These are: *'''A-mode''': A-mode is the simplest type of ultrasound. A single transducer scans a line through the body with the echoes plotted on screen as a function of depth. Therapeutic ultrasound aimed at a specific tumor or calculus is also A-mode, to allow for pinpoint accurate focus of the destructive wave energy. *'''B-mode''': In B-mode ultrasound, a linear array of transducers simultaneously scans a plane through the body that can be viewed as a two-dimensional image on screen. *'''M-mode''': M stands for motion. In m-mode a rapid sequence of B-mode scans whose images follow each other in sequence on screen enables doctors to see and measure range of motion, as the organ boundaries that produce reflections move relative to the probe. *'''Doppler mode''': This mode makes use of the Doppler effect in measuring and visualizing blood flow **'''Color doppler''': Velocity information is presented as a color coded overlay on top of a B-mode image **'''Continuous
