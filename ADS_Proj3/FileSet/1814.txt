If the analytical form of the partition function is not available, [[particle filtering]] or [[expectation propagation]] can be used to approximate ''Z'', and then perform the inference and calculate free energy. {{No footnotes|date=August 2010}} ==References== <!--- See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically --> * Time Varying Undirected Graphs, Shuheng Zhou and John D.

This typically involves providing optimized versions of functions that handle common [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] tasks. This can be done purely in [[Computer software|software]] and running on the [[Central processing unit|CPU]], common in [[embedded system]]s, or being [[Computer hardware|hardware]] accelerated by a [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]], more common in [[Personal computer|PCs]]. By employing these functions, a program can assemble an image to be output to a monitor. This relieves the programmer of the task of creating and optimizing these functions, and allows them to focus on building the graphics program. ==Examples== * [[Cairo (graphics)]] * [[Direct3D]] * [[MiniGL]] * [[OpenGL]] * [[OpenGL ES]] * [[Open Inventor]] * [[Openskia]] * [[Segger Microcontroller Systems|emWin]] An Embedded Graphics Library * [[SFML]] * [[Simple DirectMedia Layer]] ==See also== * [[Anti-Grain Geometry]] * [[Software development kit]] (SDK) {{DEFAULTSORT:Graphics Library}} [[Category:Graphics libraries| ]] [[de:Grafikbibliothek]] [[fr:Bibliothèque graphique]] [[it:GL (grafica 3d)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>15776</id> <title>Great Seal of Canada</title> <text>[[Image:Great Seal of Canada.jpg|right|frame|Great Seal of Canada]] The '''Great Seal of Canada''' ({{lang-fr|Grand Sceau du Canada}}) is a [[seal (device)|seal]] used for official purposes of state in [[Canada]] such as the certification of [[Acts of Parliament]] that have been granted [[Royal Assent]]. The first Great Seal of Canada was carved in [[United Kingdom]] in 1869 and sent to Canada to replace a temporary seal which had been used since [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1867; it depicted [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] seated beneath a canopy. Old seals are destroyed whenever a new [[monarch]] takes the throne. The current Great Seal was made at the [[Royal Canadian Mint]] when [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] succeeded her father in 1952 and it went into use in 1955. The seal is made of specially tempered steel, weighs 3.75 [[kilogram]]s, and is 127 millimetres in diameter. The image depicts the Queen enthroned and robed, holding the [[Sovereign's Orb|orb]] and [[Sceptre with the Cross|sceptre]], and shows her sitting on the coronation chair with the 1957 version of the [[Arms of Canada|Royal Arms of Canada]] in front, and is incribed ''REINE DU CANADA{{mdash}} ELIZABETH II{{mdash}} QUEEN OF CANADA''. The inscriptions on it are in French and English. Previous Great Seals of Canada were inscribed in Latin. While the [[Governor General of Canada|governor general]] is the keeper of the Great Seal, the Queen's representative places it in the protection of the [[Registrar General of Canada]]. Each of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] also has its own seal for similar purposes, kept by the [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|lieutenant governor]] of each respective provinces. ==Legal== The Great Seal is protected under the Security of Information Act, Section 5(2)(e) stating: "Every person who, without lawful authority or excuse, manufactures or sells, or has in his possession for sale, any die, seal or scribble referred to in subsection (1) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than 14 years or by summary conviction and liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than 12 months or to a fine of not more than $2,000."<ref>[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/O-5/bo-ga:s_3-gb:s_4//en#anchorbo-ga:s_3-gb:s_4 Security of Information Act]</ref> ==References== {{reflist}} ==See also== * [[Monarchy of Canada]] * [[Monarchy in the Canadian provinces]] * [[Great Seal]] ==External links== *[http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/symbl/101/104-eng.cfm#a2 Canadian Heritage - The Great Seal of Canada] {{Canada topic|Great Seal of}} {{Canadian royal symbols}} [[Category:Seals (insignia)|Canada, Great Seal of]] [[Category:National symbols of Canada]] [[Category:Monarchy in Canada]] {{Canada-gov-stub}} [[fr:Grand Sceau du Canada]] [[it:Gran Sigillo del Canada]] [[he:החותם הגדול של קנדה]] [[ru:Большая печать Канады]]</text> </page> <page> <id>15783</id> <title>Great Seal of the United States</title> <text>{{Infobox coat of arms | name = Great Seal of the United States | image = US-GreatSeal-Obverse.svg | image_width = 200 | middle = | middle_width = | middle_caption = | lesser = | lesser_width = | lesser_caption = | image2 = US Great Seal Reverse.svg | image2_width = 200 | image2_caption = Reverse of the Seal | armiger = The [[United States|United States of America]] | year_adopted = 1782 | crest = A glory [[or (heraldry)|Or]], breaking through a cloud [[Tincture (heraldry)#Proper|proper]], surrounding an [[azure (heraldry)|azure]] field bearing a constellation of thirteen [[mullet (heraldry)|stars]] [[argent]] | torse = | shield =[[Pale (heraldry)|Paleways]] of 13 pieces, argent and [[gules]]; a [[Chief (heraldry)|chief]], azure | supporters = A [[Bald Eagle]] [[proper (heraldry)|proper]] [[attitude (heraldry)#Displayed|displayed]] | motto = [[E pluribus unum]] (obverse) <br> [[Annuit cœptis]] and [[Novus ordo seclorum]] (reverse) | orders = | other_elements = In the eagle's [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]] talon an [[olive branch]]; in its [[Dexter and sinister|sinister]] talon thirteen arrows; in its beak, a scroll bearing the motto; the reverse bears "A [[pyramid]] unfinished.

The phrase is used both for the physical [[seal (device)|seal]] itself (which is kept by the [[United States Secretary of State]]), and more generally for the design impressed upon it. The Great Seal was first used publicly in 1782. The [[obverse]] of the great seal is used as the national [[coat of arms]] of the United States.<ref name="ahcritic">{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheraldry.org/pages/index.php?n=Official.Crit#toc1|title=The
