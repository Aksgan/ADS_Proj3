H. Saunders''', was a British paper-maker known especially for his [[watermark]]s, and also a philanthropist. He was the youngest of the five children of hoop-maker John Saunders, and started a career in paper-making while in his twenties, becoming partner in a paper mill in 1840. He married Mary Marchant in 1844. He won medals at international exhibitions for his firm's beautiful and innovative ''light and shade'' watermarks, which contributed to his success at the [[Great Exhibition]] in London in 1851. At the Irish exhibition of 1853 there was special mention for his "specimens of paper ornamented with a water mark, showing gradations of light and shade".<ref>[http://books.google.com/ John Sproule, ''The Irish Industrial Exhibition of 1853]''</ref> The description continued, "This kind of paper is intended to prevent frauds in bills of exchange . . ." and indeed these high quality watermarks attracted many leading banks as customers, and made T.H.Saunders & Co important suppliers of postage stamps and banknotes to many countries in [[Europe]], the [[British Empire]] and [[South America]]. The technology for this had been invented by William Henry Smith,<ref>Ingemar Cox, ''Digital Watermarking</ref> and the design was created by "thin brass plates upon the bottom of the mould".<ref>Sproule</ref> [[Image:Nova Scotia stamp.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Nova Scotia stamp from 1851 using T.H.Saunders watermarked paper]] Saunders built up a successful business with six paper mills, one of them the fully-renovated and well-equipped Phoenix Mill at [[Dartford]] in [[Kent]]. As well as secure, watermarked paper they also produced bulk products like newsprint for ''[[The Times]]''. With one of his managers he patented improved systems for drying paper and regulating the supply of pulp. He twice met [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston |Palmerston]], the prime minister, to discuss the taxation system as it related to paper manufacturing. He was an active [[Nonconformism|nonconformist]] Christian who gave generously to charity and paid the salary of a metropolitan missionary. As a strong supporter of the Shaftesbury Society which promoted [[ragged school]]s, he set up reading and writing classes for children from his mills. He was also a member of the [[Royal Society of Arts]]. The paper business continued at various mills along the [[River Darent]] after Saunders' death in 1870. T.H.Saunders' name is still a registered trademark for drawing and watercolour paper, now produced as Saunders Waterford paper in [[Somerset]]. ==References== *''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' *[http://www.1837online.com English deaths index] *[http://www.historicaldirectories.org/ ''Kelly's Directory of Kent'' (1882)] *[http://webdb4.patent.gov.uk/tm/text UK trademarks] <references/> ==External links== *[http://www.baph.org.uk/imagepages/watermarks/saunders.html Watermarks made by T.H.Saunders & Co] *[http://www.shaftesburysoc.org.uk/website.asp?page=Start+of+Shaftesbury Shaftesbury Society and ragged schools] {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME = Saunders, Thomas Harry | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH = 19 September 1813 | PLACE OF BIRTH = | DATE OF DEATH = 5 February 1870 | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Saunders, Thomas Harry}} [[Category:Papermakers|Saunders, T.
