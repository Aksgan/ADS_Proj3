Previously, live bear cubs were used as mascots at [[California Memorial Stadium|Memorial Stadium]]. It was decided in 1940 that a costumed mascot would be a better alternative to a live bear. Named after the [[The Oski Yell|Oski-wow-wow]] yell, he is cared for by the Oski Committee, whose members have exclusive knowledge of the identity of the costume-wearer.<ref>[http://calbears.collegesports.com/trads/cal-m-fb-mas.html California Golden Bears - Traditions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The [[University of California Marching Band]], which has served the university since 1891, performs at every home football game and at select road games as well.

Wearing their traditional blue and gold rugbies, Rally Committee members can be seen at all major sporting and spirit events. Committee members are charged with the maintenance of the five Cal flags, the large California banner overhanging the Memorial Stadium Student Section and [[Haas Pavilion]], the California Victory Cannon, Card Stunts and [[The Big "C"]] among other duties. The Rally Committee is also responsible for safekeeping of the [[Stanford Axe]] when it is in Cal's possession.<ref>[http://ucrc.berkeley.edu/ UC Rally Committee | Home<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The Chairman of the Rally Committee holds the title "Custodian of the Axe" while it is in the Committee's care. Overlooking the main Berkeley campus from the foothills in the east, [[The Big "C"]] is an important symbol of California school spirit. The Big "C" has its roots in an early 20th century campus event called "Rush," which pitted the freshman and sophomore classes against each other in a race up Charter Hill that often developed into a wrestling match. It was eventually decided to discontinue Rush and, in 1905, the freshman and sophomore classes banded together in a show of unity to build the Big "C".<ref>[http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/CalHistory/traditions.html Days of Cal | Bear Traditions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Owing to its prominent position, the Big "C" is often the target of pranks by rival [[Stanford University]] students who paint the Big "C" red and also fraternities and sororities who paint it their organization's colors. One of the Rally Committee's functions is to repaint the Big "C" to its traditional color of King Alfred Yellow. Cal students invented the college football tradition of [[card stunts]]. Then known as Bleacher Stunts, they were first performed during the 1910 [[Big Game (football)|Big Game]] and consisted of two stunts: a picture of the [[Stanford Axe]] and a large blue "C" on a white background. The tradition continues today in the Cal student section and incorporates complicated motions, for example tracing the Cal script logo on a blue background with an imaginary yellow pen.<ref>[http://calbears.collegesports.com/trads/cal-m-fb-tour.html California Golden Bears - Traditions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The California Victory Cannon, placed on [[Tightwad Hill]] overlooking the stadium, is fired before every football home game, after every score, and after every Cal victory. First used in the 1963 Big Game, it was originally placed on the sidelines before moving to [[Tightwad Hill]] in 1971. The only time the cannon ran out of ammunition was during a game against [[University of the Pacific (United States)|Pacific]] in 1991, when Cal scored 12 touchdowns.<ref>[http://calbears.collegesports.com/trads/victory-cannon.html California Golden Bears - Traditions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Other traditions have included events that span only a few years.

UC Berkeley has a reputation for [[student activism]], stemming from the 1960s and the [[Free Speech Movement]]. Today, Berkeley is known as a lively campus with activism in many forms, from email petitions, presentations on [[Sproul Plaza]] and volunteering, to the occasional protest. Political student groups on campus numbered 94 during the 2006â€“2007 school year, including Berkeley MEChA, Berkeley [[ACLU]], Berkeley Students for Life, Campus Greens, Cal Berkeley Democrats, and the Berkeley College Republicans. Berkeley sends the most students to the [[Peace Corps]] of any university in the nation.<ref>[http://www.ucop.edu/pathways/infoctr/introuc/ucb.html Berkeley<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The [[IDEAL Scholars Fund]] was established by four alumni to increase the number of underrepresented minorities at UC Berkeley.
