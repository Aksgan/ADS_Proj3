For example, the following function has vertical asymptotes at ''x'' = 0, and ''x'' = 1, but not at ''x'' = 2. :<math>f(x)=\frac{x^2-5x+6}{x^3-3x^2+2x}=\frac{(x-2)(x-3)}{x(x-1)(x-2)}</math> ==== Oblique asymptotes of rational functions ==== [[File:SlantAsymptoteError.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Black: the graph of <math>f(x)=(x^2+x+1)/(x+1)</math>. Red: the asymptote <math>y=x</math>. Green: difference between the graph and its asymptote for <math>x=1,2,3,4,5,6</math>]] When the numerator of a rational function has degree exactly one greater than the denominator, the function has an oblique (slant) asymptote. The asymptote is the polynomial term after [[Polynomial long division|dividing]] the numerator and denominator. This phenomenon occurs because when dividing the fraction, there will be a linear term, and a remainder. For example, consider the function :<math>f(x)=\frac{x^2+x+1}{x+1}=x+\frac{1}{x+1}</math> shown to the right. As the value of ''x'' increases, ''f'' approaches the asymptote ''y'' = ''x''. This is because the other term, ''y'' = 1/(''x''+1) becomes smaller. If the degree of the numerator is more than 1 larger than the degree of the denominator, and the denominator does not divide the numerator, there will be a nonzero remainder that goes to zero as ''x'' increases, but the quotient will not be linear, and the function does not have an oblique asymptote. === Transformations of known functions === If a known function has an asymptote (such as ''y''=0 for ''f''(x)=''e''<sup>''x''</sup>), then the translations of it also have an asymptote. * If ''x''=''a'' is a vertical asymptote of ''f''(''x''), then ''x''=''a''+''h'' is a vertical asymptote of ''f''(''x''-''h'') * If ''y''=''c'' is a horizontal asymptote of ''f''(''x''), then ''y''=''c''+''k'' is a horizontal asymptote of ''f''(''x'')+''k'' If a known function has an asymptote, then the [[Homothetic transformation|scaling]] of the function also have an asymptote. * If ''y''=''ax''+''b'' is an asymptote of ''f''(''x''), then ''y''=''cax''+''cb'' is an asymptote of ''cf''(''x'') For example, ''f''(''x'')=''e''<sup>''x''-1</sup>+2 has horizontal asymptote ''y''=0+2=2, and no vertical or oblique asymptotes. == General definition == [[File:Graph of sect csct.png|right|thumb|200px|(sec(t), cosec(t)), or x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = (xy)<sup>2</sup>, with 2 horizontal and 2 vertical asymptotes.]] Let {{nowrap|''A'' : (''a'',''b'') &rarr; '''R'''<sup>2</sup>}} be a [[parametric curve|parametric]] plane curve, in coordinates ''A''(''t'') = (''x''(''t''),''y''(''t'')).

V. | title=Differential geometry | publisher=P. Noordhoff N. V. | location=Groningen | series=Translated from the first Russian ed. by L. F. Boron | id={{MathSciNet | id = 0114163}} | year=1959}}, §8.</ref> For example, the upper right branch of the curve ''y'' = 1/''x'' can be defined parametrically as ''x'' = ''t'', ''y'' = 1/''t'' (where ''t''>0). First, ''x'' → ∞ as ''t'' → ∞ and the distance from the curve to the ''x''-axis is 1/''t'' which approaches 0 as ''t'' → ∞. Therefore the ''x''-axis is an asymptote of the curve. Also, ''y'' → ∞ as ''t'' → 0 from the right, and the distance between the curve and the ''y''-axis is ''t'' which approaches 0 as ''t'' → 0. So the ''y''-axis is also an asymptote. A similar argument shows that the lower left branch of the curve also has the same two lines as asymptotes. Although the definition here uses a parameterization of the curve, the notion of asymptote does not depend on the parameterization. In fact, if the equation of the line is <math>ax+by+c=0</math> then the distance from the point ''A''(''t'') = (''x''(''t''),''y''(''t'')) to the line is given by :<math>\frac{|ax(t)+by(t)+c|}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}</math> if γ(''t'') is a change of parameterization then the distance becomes :<math>\frac{|ax(\gamma(t))+by(\gamma(t))+c|}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}</math> which tends to zero simultaneously as the previous expression. An important case is when the curve is the [[Graph of a function|graph]] of a [[real function]] (a function of one real variable and returning real values). The graph of the function ''y'' = ''ƒ''(''x'') is the set of points of the plane with coordinates (''x'',''ƒ''(''x'')). For this, a parameterization is :<math>t\mapsto (t,f(t)).</math> This parameterization is to be considered over the open intervals (''a'',''b''), where ''a'' can be &minus;∞ and ''b'' can be +∞. An asymptote can be either vertical or non-vertical (oblique or horizontal). In the first case its equation is ''x'' = ''c'', for some real number ''c''. The non-vertical case has equation {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''mx'' + ''n''}}, where ''m'' and <math>n</math> are real numbers. All three types of asymptotes can be present at the same time in specific examples. Unlike asymptotes for curves that are graphs of functions, a general curve may have more than two non-vertical asymptotes, and may cross its vertical asymptotes more than once. ==Curvilinear asymptotes== [[File:nonlinear asymptote.svg|right|thumb|200px|''x''<sup>2</sup>+2''x''+3 is a parabolic asymptote to (''x''<sup>3</sup>+2''x''<sup>2</sup>+3''x''+4)/''x'']] Let {{nowrap|''A'' : (''a'',''b'') &rarr; '''R'''<sup>2</sup>}} be a parametric plane curve, in coordinates ''A''(''t'') = (''x''(''t''),''y''(''t'')), and ''B'' be another (unparameterized) curve. Suppose, as before, that the curve ''A'' tends to infinity. The curve ''B'' is a curvilinear asymptote of ''A'' if the shortest of the distance from the point ''A''(''t'') to a point on ''B'' tends to zero as ''t'' → ''b''. Sometimes ''B'' is simply referred to as an asymptote of ''A'', when there is no risk of confusion with linear asymptotes.<ref>{{citation|last=Fowler|first=R.
