L. R. James]], [[Timothy Mason]], [[Herbert Aptheker]], [[Arno J. Mayer]] and [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] have sought to validate [[Karl Marx]]'s theories by analyzing history from a Marxist perspective. In response to the Marxist interpretation of history, historians such as [[François Furet]], [[Richard Pipes]], [[J. C. D. Clark]], [[Roland Mousnier]], [[Henry Ashby Turner]] and [[Robert Conquest]] have offered anti-Marxist interpretations of history. [[Feminism|Feminist]] historians such as [[Joan Wallach Scott]], [[Claudia Koonz]], [[Natalie Zemon Davis]], [[Sheila Rowbotham]], [[Gisela Bock]], [[Gerda Lerner]], [[Elizabeth Fox-Genovese]], and [[Lynn Hunt]] have argued for the importance of studying the experience of women in the past. In recent years, [[postmodernism|postmodernists]] have challenged the validity and need for the study of history on the basis that all history is based on the personal interpretation of sources. In his 1997 book ''In Defence of History'', [[Richard J. Evans]], a professor of modern history at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], defended the worth of history. Another defence of history from post-modernist criticism was the Australian historian [[Keith Windschuttle]]'s 1994 book, ''The Killing of History''. ==Areas of study== {| class="toccolours" style="float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em; width:222px; text-align:left; clear:right;" | style="background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;"| <center> ;Particular studies and fields </center> |- | These are approaches to history; not listed are histories of other fields, such as [[history of science]], [[history of mathematics]] and [[history of philosophy]]. * [[Ancient history]] : the study from the beginning of human history until the Early Middle Ages. * [[Atlantic history]]: the study of the history of people living on or near the Atlantic Ocean. * [[Art History]]: the study of changes in and social context of art. * [[Big History]]: study of history on a large scale across long time frames and [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]]s through a multi-disciplinary approach. * [[Chronology]]: science of localizing historical events in time. * [[Comparative history]]: historical analysis of social and cultural entities not confined to national boundaries. * [[Contemporary history]]: the study of historical events that are immediately relevant to the present time. * [[Counterfactual history]]: the study of historical events as they might have happened in different causal circumstances. * [[Cultural history]]: the study of culture in the past. * [[Digital History]]: the use of computing technologies to produce digital scholarship. * [[Economic History]]: the study of economies in the past. * [[Futurology]]: study of the future: researches the medium to long-term future of societies and of the physical world. * [[Intellectual history]]: the study of ideas in the context of the cultures that produced them and their development over time. * [[Maritime history]]: the study of maritime transport and all the connected subjects. * [[Modern history]] : the study of the Modern Times, the era after the Middle Ages. * [[Military History]]: the study of warfare and wars in history and what is sometimes considered to be a sub-branch of military history, [[Naval History]]. * [[Natural history]]: the study of the development of the [[Timeline of the Big Bang|cosmos]], the [[History of Earth|Earth]], [[Timeline of evolution|biology]] and interactions thereof. * [[Paleography]]: study of ancient texts. * [[People's history]]: historical work from the perspective of common people. * [[Political history]]: the study of politics in the past. * [[Psychohistory]]: study of the psychological motivations of historical events. * [[Pseudohistory]]: study about the past that falls outside the domain of mainstream history (sometimes it is an equivalent of [[pseudoscience]]). * [[Social History]]: the study of the process of social change throughout history. * [[Universal history]]: basic to the Western tradition of historiography. * [[Women's history]]: the history of female human beings.

Historians give these [[Periodization|periods of time]] names in order to allow "organising ideas and classificatory generalisations" to be used by historians.<ref name="Marwick-p169">{{cite book |title=The Nature of History |author=Marwick, Arthur|publisher=The Macmillian Press LTD |year=1970 |page=169}}</ref> The names given to a period can vary with geographical location, as can the dates of the start and end of a particular period. [[Centuries]] and [[decade]]s are commonly used periods and the time they represent depends on the [[Calendar era|dating system]] used. Most periods are constructed retrospectively and so reflect value judgments made about the past. The way periods are constructed and the names given to them can affect the way they are viewed and studied.<ref name="Tosh-p168-169">{{cite book |title=The Pursuit of History|author=Tosh, John|publisher=Pearson Education Limited|year=2006 |pages=168–169}}</ref> ===Geographical locations=== Particular [[geographical]] locations can form the basis of historical study, for example, [[continent]]s, [[countries]] and [[cities]]. Understanding why historic events took place is important. To do this, historians often turn to [[geography]]. Weather patterns, the water supply, and the landscape of a place all affect the lives of the people who live there. For example, to explain why the ancient Egyptians developed a successful civilization, studying the [[geography of Egypt]] is essential. Egyptian civilization was built on the banks of the Nile River, which flooded each year, depositing soil on its banks. The rich soil could help farmers grow enough crops to feed the people in the cities. That meant everyone did not have to farm, so some people could perform other jobs that helped develop the civilization. ====World==== {{Main|History of the world}} World history is the study of major civilizations over the last 3000 years or so. It has led to highly controversial interpretations by [[Oswald Spengler]] and [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], among others. World history is especially important as a teaching field. It has increasingly entered the university curriculum in the U.S., in many cases replacing courses in Western Civilization, that had a focus on Europe and the U.S. World history adds extensive new material on Asia, Africa and Latin America. ====Regions==== * [[History of Africa]] begins with the first emergence of modern human beings on the continent, continuing into its modern present as a patchwork of diverse and politically developing nation states. * [[History of the Americas]] is
