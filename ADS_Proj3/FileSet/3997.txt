The sensibility, if not the term itself, almost certainly dates back to the early years of [[time-sharing]] computer systems in the 1960s when it was common for a single institutional [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] to control many interactive terminals. In such an environment server [[lag]] is acutely perceived. Furthermore, in many operating environments, scarce server resources such as CPU-seconds were often metered and charged against the account of the user running the program. An unintentional server hog could prove extremely costly in financial terms. These programs were often called run-away programs or endless loops. ==Resource contention== Server performance has many dimensions. Any subsystem that becomes excessively loaded can compromise the performance of other clients contending for that subsystem. Common forms of hardware contention include CPU cycles, interrupt latency, I/O bandwidth, available system memory, or aggregate system memory bandwidth. At the software level, contention can arise for [[buffer (computer science)|buffers]], [[queue (data structure)|queues]], [[spooling|spool]]s, or [[page table]]s. ==Known hogs== It is accepted practice that servers are appropriately sized by system administrators for the workload (or mixture of workloads) expected, and server performance is closely monitored to establish performance baselines. The server load might include well known server hogs, such as system backup. These tasks are generally scheduled for time periods of light demand, such as in the very early hours on a Sunday morning, with an accepted administrative policy to discourage or prohibit other demands on the server during those time periods. ==Unexpected hogs== More often, the term server hog is used to designate an unusual load condition where the server performance falls short of the culturally accepted baseline. A common scenario in the early years of computing was an overload condition known as [[Thrashing (computer science)|thrashing]] where the aggregate server performance becomes severely degraded, such as when two departments of a large company attempt to run a heavy report concurrently on the same mainframe. In such a situation, the designation of the server hog becomes a political matter of pointing fingers, as the termination of either long-running report would restore the server to normal performance. ==Internet era== In the [[internet]] era, the nature of server loads greatly changed, as the clients became increasingly dispersed geographically, and often increasingly anonymous, as for example, any member of the public with internet access can request a web server in any part of the world to deliver a web page. In this context, a server hog most commonly designates a malicious server hog--a program written expressly for the purpose of overloading a remote server with excessive requests or excessively difficult requests (such as complex search). Use of a deliberate server hog is known as a [[denial-of-service attack]], a behaviour exhibited by many [[Computer virus|viruses]], [[Computer worm|worms]] and [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan horses]]. It is also possible for a petulant or vindictive computer user to manually overload a remote server by unleashing a [[crapflooding|crap flood]]. ==Bots== A special case is that of a run-away [[bot]], a program that was designed to be helpful by automating a drudgerous task, but due to poor programming or poorly understood circumstances, goes out of control and hammers a server unceasingly at high rate. A common case is a [[web spider]] which accesses too many pages on a web server too quickly at the expense of the server's intended audience. ==References== http://www.arthistoryclub.com/art_history/Server_hog [[Category:computing terminology]]</text> </page> <page> <id>34021</id> <title>Service-oriented modeling</title> <text>[[Image:SOMF DA Example5.jpg|thumb|420px|Example of a Service-Oriented Modeling Framework (SOMF) Diagram.]] {{Other uses|Som (disambiguation)}} '''Service-oriented modeling''' is the discipline of [[scientific modeling|modeling]] business and software systems, for the purpose of designing and specifying [[service-oriented]] business systems within a [[service-oriented architecture]]. Any service-oriented modeling methodology typically includes a [[modeling language]] that can be employed by both the 'problem domain organization' (the Business), and 'solution domain organization' (the [[Information Technology]] Department), whose unique perspectives typically influence the 'service' development life-cycle strategy and the projects implemented using that strategy. Service-oriented modeling typically strives to create models that provide a comprehensive view of the analysis, design, and [[enterprise architecture|architecture]] of all 'Software Entities' in an organization, which can be understood by individuals with diverse levels of business and technical understanding. Service-oriented modeling typically encourages viewing software entities as 'assets' (service-oriented assets), and refers to these assets collectively as 'services'. ==Popular approaches to service-oriented modeling== There are many different approaches that have been proposed for service modeling, including SOMA and SOMF. ===Service-oriented modeling and architecture (SOMA)=== [[IBM]] announced Service-Oriented Modeling and Architecture (SOMA) as the first publicly announced SOA-related methodology in 2004.<ref> Bieberstein et al., Executing SOA: A Practical Guide for the Service-Oriented Architect (Paperback), IBM Press books, 978-0132353748</ref> SOMA refers to the more general domain of service modeling necessary to design and create SOA. SOMA covers a broader scope and implements service-oriented analysis and design (SOAD) through the identification, specification and realization of services, components that realize those services (a.k.a. "service components"), and flows that can be used to compose services. SOMA includes an analysis and design
