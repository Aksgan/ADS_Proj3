There are already some interesting (unofficial) results. Ring galaxies turn out to be much more common than was believed. Only two known galaxies were 'three legged' - possessing three well-defined spiral arms. Many more have now been found.<ref>[http://www.galaxyzooforum.org/index.php?topic=7446.0 three legged well defined spiral galaxy]</ref> There are many pictures of merging, colliding or interacting galaxies.<ref>[http://www.galaxyzooforum.org/index.php?topic=567.0 Biggest cosmic trainwrecks - Mergers]</ref> There is also now a 'science blog',<ref>[http://blogs.zooniverse.org/galaxyzoo/ Official Blog of the Galaxy Zoo project]</ref> an official summary of what the 'zoo' has achieved so far. There is a current project seeking volunteers to review a set of possible merging galaxies. === Galaxy Zoo 2 === This consists of some 250,000 of the brightest galaxies from the Galaxy Zoo. Galaxy Zoo 2 allows for a much more detailed classification, by shape and by the intensity or dimness of the galactic core, and with a special section for oddities like mergers or ring galaxies. The sample also contains fewer optical oddities and orange blobs. The project closed with some 60 million classficiations. The first papers from Zoo 2 are already complete, and much science work continues.<ref>[http://zoo2.galaxyzoo.org/ Galaxy Zoo 2]</ref> Galaxy classification by volunteers continues with ''Galaxy Zoo Hubble''. === Other projects in the 'Zooniverse' === As at December 2010, the following projects were 'live', still accepting input and available for new users to join: :Galaxy Zoo Hubble :Galaxy Zoo The Hunt for Supernovae :Galaxy Zoo Understanding Cosmic Mergers :Planethunters.org :The Milky Way Project :Moon Zoo :Old Weather :Solar Stormwatch ''Galaxy Zoo Hubble'' involves classifying hundreds of thousands of galaxies drawn from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope archive. It includes galaxies with 'blue clumps' that may represent a stage in the maturing of galaxies into modern forms. There are more than 350,000 volunteers.<ref>[http://www.zooniverse.org/home Zooniverse Home]</ref> == Discoveries == An object known as {{lang|nl|[[Hanny's Voorwerp]]}}<ref>[http://sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/33436/title/Galaxy_Zoos_blue_mystery_(part_2) Science News / Galaxy Zoo's Blue Mystery (part 2):]</ref>, [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for ''Hanny's object'',<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7543776.stm "Teacher finds new cosmic object"], BBC, 5 August 2008</ref> was spotted by a member called Hanny van Arkel and has attracted some scientific interest.<ref>[http://blogs.zooniverse.org/galaxyzoo/2008/03/20/voorwerp-fever/ Voorwerp fever] and [http://www.galaxyzooblog.org/2008/01/11/whats-the-blue-stuff-below/ What’s the blue stuff below?]</ref> This discovery was featured as NASA's [[Astronomy Picture of the Day]] on June 25, 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080625.html |title=What is Hanny's Voorwerp? |accessdate=2008-06-25 |work= Galaxy Zoo Project, [[Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes|ING]] |date= 2008-06-25}}</ref> It is now thought to be a portion of a gas-cloud, heated by the jet from a black hole.<ref>[http://www.astronomynow.com/081126NatureofHannysVoorwerprevealed.html Nature of ‘Hanny's Voorwerp’ revealed]</ref> Here the list of studies derived from the project with relative informations (In green the accepted and published) .
