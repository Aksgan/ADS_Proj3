those who favor a dualist position regarding mind and brain."<ref name="damasio-understanding"/> Stanford University's Richard E. Snow said, <blockquote>"Historically, the concept of 'conation' was coordinated with cognition and affect, the three comprising the main domains of mental life. There has been recent interest in the interaction of cognition and affect ... But the conative seems to have dropped out of modern psychology's consciousness. It deserves reinstatement and research."<ref name="snow-intelligence"/></blockquote> And Snow, in his editorial "Intelligence for the Year 2001" (1980), summed up the situation well when he said, "It is not unreasonable to hypothesize that both conative and affective aspects of persons and situations influence the details of cognitive processing ... A theoretical account of intelligent behavior in the real world requires a synthesis of cognition, conation and affect. We have not really begun to envision this synthesis" (p. 194 "Intelligence for the Year 2001").<ref name="snow-intelligence"/> ==See also== {{Wiktionary}} * [[conatus]] == External links == * Huitt, W.
