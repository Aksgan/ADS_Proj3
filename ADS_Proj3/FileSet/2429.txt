''kluge'' is from '''k'''lumsy, '''l'''ame, '''u'''gly, '''d'''umb, but '''g'''ood '''e'''nough, or '''k'''lutzy, '''l'''ashup, '''u'''nder, '''g'''oing, '''e'''ngineering.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} == In aerospace engineering == In aerospace design a kluge was a temporary design using separate commonly available components that were not flight worthy to proof the design and enable concurrent software development while the integrated components were developed and manufactured. The term was in common enough use to appear in a fictional movie about the US space program.<ref>[[Marooned (film)]]. 1969. Dialog between space crew and Ted approximately 30 minutes into the movie, following capsule power down. Ted says, "I'm in Huntsville kludging up a simulator of the XRV." The film was based on the [[Marooned (novel)|1964 novel]] of the same name.</ref> Perhaps the ultimate kludge was the first [[United States|US]] [[space station]], [[Skylab]]. Its two major components, the Saturn Workshop and the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]], began their development as separate projects (the SWS was kludged from the [[S-IVB]] stage of the [[Saturn 1B]] and [[Saturn V]] launch vehicles, the ATM was kludged from an early design for the descent stage of the [[Apollo Lunar Module]]). Later the SWS and ATM were folded into the [[Apollo Applications Program]], but the components were to have been launched separately, then docked together in orbit. In the final design, the SWS and ATM were launched together, but for the single-launch concept to work, the ATM had to pivot 90 degrees on a truss structure from its launch position to its on-orbit orientation, clearing the way for the crew to dock its [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] at the axial docking port of the Multiple Docking Adapter. The Airlock Module's manufacturer, [[McDonnell Douglas]], even recycled the hatch design from its [[Project Gemini|Gemini spacecraft]] and kludged what was originally designed for the conical Gemini Command Module onto the cylindrical Skylab Airlock Module. The Skylab project, managed by the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]'s [[Marshall Space Flight Center]], was seen by the Manned Spacecraft Center (later [[Johnson Space Center]]) as an invasion of its historical role as the NASA center for manned spaceflight. Thus, MSC personnel missed no opportunity to disparage the Skylab project, calling it "the kludge." == In computer science == In modern [[computer science|computing]] terminology, a kludge (or often a "[[hack (technology)|hack]]") is a solution to a problem, doing a task, or fixing a system (whether hardware or software) that is inefficient, inelegant, or even unfathomable, but which nevertheless (more or less) works. To ''kludge around something'' is to avoid a [[Computer bug|bug]] or some difficult condition by building a kludge, perhaps relying on properties of the bug itself to assure proper operation. It is somewhat similar in spirit to a [[workaround]], only without the grace. A kludge is often used to change the behavior of a system after it is finished, without having to make fundamental changes. Sometimes to keep backwards compatibility, but often simply because it is easier. That ''something'' was often originally a [[Crock (slang)|crock]], which is why it must now be [[Hack (technology slang)|hacked]] to make it work. Note that a hack might be a kludge, but that 'hack' could be, at least in computing, ironic praise, for a quick fix solution to a frustrating problem.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kidder |first=Tracey |title=[[The Soul of a New Machine]] |publisher=Avon |year=1982 |isbn=9780380599318}}</ref> A kludge is often used to fix an unanticipated problem in an earlier kludge; this is essentially a kind of [[cruft]]. Something might be a kludge if it fails in [[corner case]]s, but this is a less common sense as such situations are not expected to come up in typical usage. More commonly, a kludge is a poorly working [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] which was expected to work well. An intimate knowledge of the context (i.e., problem domain and/or the kludge's execution environment) is typically required to build a corner case kludge. As a consequence, they are sometimes ironically praised. An anecdotal example of a kludge involved a computer part supposedly manufactured in the [[Soviet Union]] during the 1960s. The part needed slightly delayed receipt of a signal to work. Rather than setting up a timing system, the kludge was to make the internal wires extra-long, increasing the distance and thus increasing the time the electrical signal took to reach its destination. A variation on this use of kludge is evasion of an unknown problem or bug in a [[computer program]]. Rather than continue to struggle to find out exactly what is causing the bug and how to fix it, the programmer may hack the problem by the simple kludge of writing new code which compensates. For example, if a variable keeps ending up doubled in a certain code area, add code which divides by two when it is used, after the original code has been executed. In computer networking, use of [[Network address translation|NAT]] (Network Address Translation) (RFC 1918) or [[Port address translation|PAT]] (Port Address Translation) to cope with the shortage of [[Internet Protocol|IPv4]] addresses is an example of a kludge. Another common example are [[quickstart]]s like those shipped with [[OpenOffice.org]], [[Real Player]], [[Quicktime]] and [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] products, in which a bloated program that normally takes a long time to load is kept in memory to reduce the delay in starting it. In [[FidoNet]] terminology, the term "kludge" refers to a piece of control data embedded inside a message. ==In evolutionary neuroscience== The ''kludge'' or ''kluge'' metaphor has been adapted in fields such as [[neuroscience]] and [[evolutionary biology]], particularly in reference to the [[human brain]]. The neuroscientist [[David Linden]] discusses how [[intelligent design]] proponents have misconstrued brain anatomy. <blockquote>The transcendent aspects of our human experience, the things that touch our emotional and cognitive core, were not given to us by a Great Engineer. These are not the latest design features of an impeccably crafted brain. Rather, at every turn, brain design has been a kludge, a workaround, a jumble, a pastiche. The things we hold highest in our human experience (love, memory, dreams, and a predisposition for religious thought) result from a particular agglomeration of
