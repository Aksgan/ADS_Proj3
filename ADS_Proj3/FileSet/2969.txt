says (effectively), ''Everything that is past and true is necessary''. It seems reasonable to say that possibly it will rain tomorrow, and possibly it won't; on the other hand, seeing as how we can't change the past, if it is true that it rained yesterday, it probably isn't true that it may not have rained yesterday. It seems the past is "fixed", or necessary, in a way the future is not. This is sometimes referred to as [[accidental necessity]]. But if the past is "fixed", and everything that is in the future will eventually be in the past, then it seems plausible to say that future events are necessary too. Similarly, the [[problem of future contingents]] considers the semantics of assertions about the future: is either of the propositions 'There will be a sea battle tomorrow', or 'There will not be a sea battle tomorrow' now true? Considering this thesis led [[Aristotle]] to reject the [[principle of bivalence]] for assertions concerning the future. Additional binary operators are also relevant to temporal logics, ''q.v.'' [[Linear Temporal Logic]]. Versions of temporal logic can be used in [[computer science]] to model computer operations and prove theorems about them. In one version, <math>\Diamond P</math> means "at a future time in the computation it is possible that the computer state will be such that P is true"; <math>\Box P</math> means "at all future times in the computation P will be true". In another version, <math>\Diamond P</math> means "at the immediate next state of the computation, P might be true"; <math>\Box P</math> means "at the immediate next state of the computation, P will be true". These differ in the choice of [[Accessibility relation]]. (P always means "P is true at the current computer state".) These two examples involve nondeterministic or not-fully-understood computations; there are many other modal logics specialized to different types of program analysis. Each one naturally leads to slightly different axioms. ==Deontic logic== {{Main|Deontic logic}} Likewise talk of morality, or of [[obligation]] and [[norm (philosophy)|norms]] generally, seems to have a modal structure. The difference between "You must do this" and "You may do this" looks a lot like the difference between "This is necessary" and "This is possible". Such logics are called ''[[deontic logic|deontic]]'', from the Greek for "duty". Deontic logics commonly lack the axiom '''T''' semantically corresponding to the reflexivity of the accessibility relation in [[Kripke semantics]]: in symbols, <math>\Box\phi\to\phi</math>. Interpreting <math>\Box</math> as "it is obligatory that", '''T''' informally says that every obligation is true. For example, if it is obligatory not to kill others (i.e. killing is morally forbidden), then '''T''' implies that people actually do not kill others. The consequent is obviously false. Instead, using [[Kripke semantics]], we say that though our own world does not realize all obligations, the worlds accessible to it do (i.e., '''T''' holds at these worlds). These worlds are called idealized worlds. ''P'' is obligatory with respect to our own world if at all idealized worlds accessible to our world, ''P'' holds. Though this was one of the first interpretations of the formal semantics, it has recently come under criticism.<ref>See, e.g., Sven Hansson, "Ideal Worlds&mdash;Wishful Thinking in Deontic Logic", Studia Logica, Vol. 82 (3), pp. 329&ndash;336, 2006.</ref> One other principle that is often (at least traditionally) accepted as a deontic principle is ''D'', <math>\Box\phi\to\Diamond\phi</math>, which corresponds to the seriality (or extendability or unboundedness) of the accessibility relation. It is an embodiment of the Kantian idea that "ought implies can". (Clearly the "can" can be interpreted in various senses, e.g. in a moral or alethic sense.) ===Intuitive problems with deontic logic=== When we try and formalize ethics with standard modal logic, we run into some problems. Suppose that we have a proposition ''K'': you have killed the victim, and another, ''Q'': you have killed the victim quickly. Now suppose we want to express the thought that "if you have killed the victim, it ought to be the case that you have killed him quickly". There are two likely candidates, : (1) <math>(K \rightarrow \Box Q)</math> : (2) <math>\Box (K \rightarrow Q)</math> But (1) says that if you have killed the victim, then it ought to be the case that you have killed him quickly. This surely isn't right, because you ought not to have killed him at all. And (2) doesn't work either. If the right representation of "if you have killed the victim then you ought to have killed him quickly" is (2), then the right representation of (3) "if you have killed the victim then you ought to have killed him slowly" is <math>\Box (K \rightarrow \lnot Q)</math>. Now suppose (as seems reasonable) that you should not have killed the victim, or <math>\Box \lnot K</math>. But then we can deduce <math>\Box (K \rightarrow \lnot Q)</math>, which would express sentence (3). So if you should not have killed the victim, then if you did kill him, you should have killed him slowly. But that can't be right, and is not right when we use natural language. Telling someone they should not kill the victim certainly does not imply that they should kill the victim slowly if they do kill him.<ref>Ted Sider's ''Logic for Philosophy'', unknown page. <!-- http://homepages.nyu.edu/~ts65/books/lfp/lfp.html Link is dead as of Dec 20, 2010 --> </ref> == Doxastic logic == {{Main|Doxastic logic}} ''Doxastic logic'' concerns the logic of belief (of some set of agents). The term doxastic is derived from the [[ancient Greek]] ''doxa'' which means "belief". Typically, a doxastic logic uses <math>\Box</math>, often written "B", to mean "It is believed that", or when relativized to a particular agent s, "It is believed by s that". ==Other modal logics== {{See also|Intensional logic}} Significantly, modal logics can be developed to accommodate most of these idioms; it is the fact of their common logical structure (the use of "intensional" sentential operators) that make them all varieties of the same thing. == The ontology of possibility == {{See| Accessibility relation|Possible worlds}} In the most common interpretation of modal logic, one considers "[[logically possible]] worlds".
