now signed up 8 Turkish banks to enable them to use [[mobile signatures]] for online user authentication. Other services relying on mobile signatures are: *Securing the withdrawal of small loans from an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] *Processing custom work flow processes by enabling applicants to use [[mobile signature]]s. ;references http://www.valimo.com/news_and_events/26-02-2009/kenya-turkey-japan-lead-mobile-money-trend http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=113484 http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/ekonomi/6307988.asp?gid=196 http://www.turkcell.com.tr/bultenler/2007_02_20_mobile_signature_eng.pdf ==Austria== The Austrian government has decided to allow private sector companies to propose means for storing the government-controlled [[digital identity]].

Most common are towable offices built on an axled iron frame for easy relocation. Mobile field offices are often found on [[construction site]]s, or at [[disaster]] scenes where a temporary office space is needed. Typically, mobile offices in North America feature a single phase split (240 volt center-tapped) electric service that is connected to a nearby source of power, to run small window-unit air conditioners, and the like. There are many types of companies that sell, lease, rent new and used [[intermodal container|storage containers]], [[portable building]]s or [[modular building]]s. This type of construction shortens the construction period as the building can be built in a factory in as little as six weeks and the site and utility work can be done in conjunction with the construction of the building. '''Mobile office''' is also used for the workspace of [[salesperson|salespeople]] or similar, working out of their company office. They are usually equipped with a [[portable computer]] and connect to the company servers and [[Intranet]] via [[mobile phone]]s, [[WiFi]] or via fixed connections in [[cybercafe]]s, [[hotel]]s and [[airport]]s. They like to use [[Personal information manager|Personal Information Managers]] Because they must carry their equipment, mobile office workers push for [[miniaturization]] of devices. ==See also== * [[Secure Virtual Office]] * [[Mobile home]] * [[Virtual office]] [[Category:Office work]] [[Category:Construction]] [[fr:Algeco]]</text> </page> <page> <id>24817</id> <title>Mobile signature</title> <text>A '''mobile signature''' is a [[digital signature]] generated either on a mobile phone or on a [[SIM card]]. ==Origins of the term== '''mSign''' The term first appeared in articles introducing [[mSign]] (short for Mobile Electronic Signature Consortium). It was founded in 1999 and comprised 35 member companies. In October 2000, the consortium published an XML-interface defining a protocol allowing service providers to obtain a mobile (digital) signature from a mobile phone subscriber. In 2001, [[mSign]] gained industry-wide coverage when it came apparent that Brokat (one of the founders company) also obtained a process patent in Germany for using the mobile phone to generate digital signatures. '''MoSign project and standardization attempt''' The MoSign project (short for Mobile Signature) initiated by the companies [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Ericsson]], [[Materna]], [[Microsoft]], [[Sema Group]], [[Siemens]] and [[TC TrustCenter]] was meant to demonstrate the deployment of electronic signatures using a "mobile signing device". The mobile signing device comprised a Siemens IC35 organizer with an integrated [[WAP browser]] and a Smart card reader. The user was meant to connect the IC35 via the IrDA interface to an internet-enabled mobile device, that would enable the IC 35's WAP browser to view WAP pages from a remote server. To generate a mobile signature the user inserted a Smart card into the IC35's card slot. The digital keys are stored on the Smart card and the signing application was based on the WAP 1.2 Crypto SignText implementation in the WAP browser stack. In March 2001, four German banks - Deutsche Bank, [[Commerzbank]], [[Dresdner Bank]] and [[HypoVereinsbank]] announced that they would use the findings from the MoSign project and would develop it into a single standard for electronic signatures used in conjunction with mobile devices and financial services. '''ETSI-MSS standardization ''' The term was then used by Paul Gibson (G&D) and Romary Dupuis ([[France Telecom]]) in their standardisation work at the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]] (ETSI) and published in ETSI Technical Report TR 102 203. The ETSI-MSS specifications define an XML interface and Mobile Signature Roaming for systems implementing mobile signature services. ==Mobile signatures today== Currently, [[GSM]] phones and [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]] phones are mostly supporting this technology. Those mobile signature services on sim cards can be supported by almost all GSM phones, regardless of their capacity. In the near future, 3 G-phones and other portable devices will feature a similar mobile signature application. The mobile signature is the legal equivalent of your own wet signature. The mobile signature is created by typing a secret code (i.e. your signing PIN) into the signing device (for example: your mobile phone). This secret code in combination with your key storage token (for example: [[SIM card]]) and a chosen text triggers a cryptographic algorithm to generate the (digital) signature. Each of your mobile/digital signatures can be linked to a [[digital certificate]] (an electronic record) that vouches for your real-world identity. Thus, the mobile signature is a unique feature for: * Proving your real-world identity to third parties without face-to-face communications * Making a legally-binding commitment by sending a confirmed message to another party * Solve security problems of the online world with identity confirmation. However authentication is still vulnerable to man in the middle attacks and trojan horses.<ref>http://www.schneier.com/essay-083.html</ref> ==Mobile Signature with On Board Key Generation== Turkcell is the first provider of a mobile signature service with "On Board Key Generation" functionality, which enables customers to create their signing and validation key pair, after they get the simcard. In this way GSM operators do not need to
