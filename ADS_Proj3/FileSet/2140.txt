prime</title> <text>'''Industrial-grade primes''' (the term is apparently due to [[Henri Cohen (number theorist)|Henri Cohen]]<ref>Chris Caldwell, [http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=PRP ''The Prime Glossary: probable prime''] at The [[Prime Pages]].</ref>) are [[integer]]s for which [[primality]] has not been certified (i.e. rigorously proven), but they have undergone [[probable prime]] tests such as the [[Miller-Rabin primality test]], which has a positive, but negligible, failure rate. Industrial-grade primes are sometimes used instead of certified primes in [[algorithms]] such as [[RSA encryption]], which require the user to generate large [[prime numbers]]. [[Primality test|Certifying the primality]] of large numbers (over 100 digits for instance) is significantly harder than showing they are industrial-grade primes. The latter can be done almost instantly with a [[failure rate]] so low that it is highly unlikely to ever fail in practice. In other words, the number is certified to be prime with very high, but not absolute, confidence. == References == <references/> [[Category:Cryptographic algorithms]] [[Category:Prime numbers]] {{numtheory-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>18202</id> <title>Inferential mood</title> <text>The '''inferential mood''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''infer'''}} or {{sc|'''infr'''}}) is used to report a nonwitnessed event without confirming it, but the same forms also function as admiratives in the [[Balkan]] languages in which they occur. The '''inferential mood''' is used in some languages such as [[Turkish language|Turkish]] to convey information about events, which were not directly observed or were inferred by the speaker. When referring to [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and other Balkan languages, it is often called '''renarrative mood'''; when referring to [[Estonian language|Estonian]], it is called '''oblique mood'''. The inferential is usually impossible to be distinguishably translated into English. For instance, indicative Bulgarian ''той отиде (toy otide)'' and Turkish ''o gitti'' will be translated the same as inferential ''той отишъл (toy otishal)'' and ''o gitmiş'' — with the English indicative ''he went''.'''<ref>For a more precise rendering, it would be possible to also translate these as "he reportedly went" or "he is said to have gone" (or even "apparently, he went") although, clearly, these long constructions would be impractical in an entire text composed in this tense.</ref>''' Using the first pair, however, implies very strongly that the speaker either witnessed the event or is very sure that it took place. The second pair implies either that the speaker did not in fact witness it take place, that it occurred in the remote past or that there is considerable doubt as to whether it actually happened. If it were necessary to make the distinction, then the English constructions "he must have gone" or "he is said to have gone" would partly translate the inferential. ==Renarrative in the Balkan languages== Writing on the typology of [[evidentiality]] in Balkan languages, Victor Friedman systematizes the facts in the following way:<ref>[http://www.summerschoolaltconference.it/ALT/Abstracts/Friedman.htm Language Contact and the Typology of Evidentials in the Balkans], [http://humanities.uchicago.edu/depts/slavic/friedman.html A. Victor Friedman]</ref> <blockquote>"As grammaticalized in the Balkan languages, evidentiality encodes the speaker's evaluation of the narrated event, often, but not always, predicated upon the nature of the available evidence. These evidentials can be of two types: Confirmative (sometimes called 'witnessed') and nonconfirmative (sometimes called 'reported', 'inferential', and/or 'nonwitnessed'). The nonconfirmatives can, in Austin's terms, be felicitous (neutral) or infelicitous. Felicitous nonconfirmatives are used for reports, inferences, etc., for which the speaker chooses not to take responsibility. An infelicitous nonconfirmative expresses either acceptance of a previously unexpected state of affairs (surprise, i.e. something the speaker would not have been willing to confirm prior to discovery, the mirative or admirative) or sarcastic rejection of a previous statement (doubt, irony, etc., the dubitative)."</blockquote> ''Ibid.'', "Illustrative data (interlinear glossing is omitted to save space): [...] :''Тој '''бил''' богат!'' (Macedonian, nonconfirmative past) :Той '''щял''' да ме набие. (Bulgarian, doubtful future: He is going to beat me up, but I do not think that would be possible because I think that I am stronger than he) :Ама вие сте '''били''' тук. (Bulgarian, present tense: You are/have been here, but I did not know it, I have just found out and I am surprised at the fact) :''O zengin'''miş'''!'' (Turkish, nonconfirmative past) :''Ai '''qenka''' i pasur!'' (Albanian, nonconfirmative present) :He '''is''' rich! (To my surprise, the nonconfirmative refers to discovery of pre-existing state) :''Ku '''qenka''' mjeshtri?'' (Albanian, nonconfirmative present) :''Каде '''бил''' мајсторот?'' (Macedonian, nonconfirmative past) :''Patron neredey'''miş'''?'' (Turkish, nonconfirmative past) :Where '''is''' the boss? (I am surprised at his absence; Albanian can have true present meaning, Balkan Slavic/Turkish cannot) In Bulgarian, even though a state of affairs may be entirely undisputed by the speaker, he may choose to use the renarrative in order to present ''disagreement'' with the actions or opinion of the speaker: :''Obizhdash go ne za drugo, ami zashtoto '''bil bogat''''' :(You're insulting him for no other reason other than for the fact that '''he's rich''') Grammatically, this could be seen as a way for the speaker to be demonstratively re-narrating the event (the insult) back to the listener in order for them to pause and consider their actions. Present and future tenses also exist for such a mood in the above-mentioned languages, but, with the exception of the Albanian ''true nonconfirmative present'' illustrated above, these "nonconfirmatives, (from perfects), always have a past reference to either a real or a putative narrated event, speech event, or state of mind. They cannot be used with true nonpast reference." :''Do t'u hapka një universitet privat'' (Albanian: A private University will be opened - apparently, i.e. as reported by someone & to my surprise.) :''Varacak'''mış''''' (Turkish: He will be arriving - as told by someone) '''True Renarrative''' Often, there is no doubt as to the veracity of the statement (for example, if it was on the news), but simply the fact that the speaker was not ''personally present'' at the event forces them to use this mood (such as the Turkish ''varacakmış'', above, or the Bulgarian ''toy otishal''<ref> In Bulgarian, the indicative would be incorrect here, at least for the first time or several times the topic is discussed. Once everyone present becomes familiar enough with the idea, however, then they may feel comfortable enough to switch to the indicative.</ref>). In this sense,
