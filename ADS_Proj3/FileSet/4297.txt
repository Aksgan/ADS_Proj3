prediction of swarm behavior when only the features of the individual swarm members are given. == Goals and applications == Both miniaturization and cost are key-factors in swarm robotics. These are the constraints in building large groups of robotics; therefore the simplicity of the individual team member should be emphasized. This should motivate a swarm-intelligent approach to achieve meaningful behavior at swarm-level, instead of the individual level. Potential applications for swarm robotics include tasks that demand for [[miniaturization]] ([[nanorobotics]], [[microbotics]]), like distributed sensing tasks in [[micromachinery]] or the [[human body]]. On the other hand swarm robotics can be suited to tasks that demand cheap designs, for instance [[mining]] tasks or agricultural [[foraging]] tasks. Also some artists use swarm robotic techniques to realize new forms of [[interactive art]]. ==See also== * [[Ant robotics]] * [[Behavior-based robotics]] * [[Flocking (behavior)]] * [[Nanorobotics]] * [[Nanomorph]] * [[Microbot]] * [[Multi-agent systems]] * [[Swarm intelligence]] * [[Autonomous agent]]s * [[Physicomimetics]] * [[List of emerging technologies]] == References == <!--<nowiki> See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref> and </ref> tags, and the template below </nowiki>--> {{reflist}} {{collective animal behaviour}} [[Category:Multi-robot systems]] [[es:Robótica de enjambres]] [[it:Robotica degli sciami]] [[ja:群ロボット工学]] [[pl:Robotyka ławicy]] [[ru:Групповая робототехника]]</text> </page> <page> <id>36292</id> <title>SwiftKey</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=September 2010}} [[File:Swiftkey-google-nexus-one.jpg|thumb|SwiftKey on a Google Nexus One]]'''SwiftKey''' is an [[Application software|app]] for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[smartphone]]s designed to speed up text entry by not only guessing the remaining letters in a word (as in [[predictive text]]ing) but also predicting a user's next word. It does this using language models that understand the relationship between words, and dynamically adapt over time to learn the vocabulary and writing style of the user. SwiftKey was unveiled at the 2010 [[Mobile World Congress]] in Barcelona<ref>http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/31476/swiftkey-android-keyboard-mobile-app</ref> by TouchType Ltd., a London-based company founded in 2008 by Jonathan Reynolds and Ben Medlock, who met while studying at Cambridge University. After a six-month alpha testing phase, the app was launched as a public [[Beta testing|beta]] on 14 July 2010 to users of Google's [[Android Market]].<ref>http://www.swiftkey.net/blog/?p=15</ref> On 23 September 2010 a full version was launched. SwiftKey's word predictions are produced by TouchType's Fluency Prediction Engine, which uses a patent-pending technique to analyze billions of words across the internet to create its language models.<ref>http://www.touchtype-online.com/products</ref> The initial analysis was performed using the supercomputer grid of the [[Large Hadron Collider]].<ref>http://www.screenwerk.com/2010/09/23/swiftkey-for-android-is-a-must-download/</ref> TouchType claims that using the Fluency technology, its app can improve text input speed by up to 50% thanks to the accuracy of its predictions. On the [http://www.swiftkey.net/ SwiftKey website] it claims, “With SwiftKey, your next word is predicted with such incredible accuracy that a third of suggestions are right first time and usually you won’t need to press more than two letters.”<ref>http://www.swiftkey.net</ref> SwiftKey currently supports US English, UK English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese and Swedish.<ref>http://www.swiftkey.net/what-is-swiftkey.html</ref> ==References== <!--- See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically --> {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.swiftkey.net/ SwiftKey official website] * [http://www.swiftkey.net/blog The SwiftKey blog] * [http://www.touchtype-online.com/ TouchType corporate website] <!--- Categories ---> [[Category:Android software]]</text> </page> <page> <id>36294</id> <title>SwingLabs</title> <text>{{Infobox software| name = swingLabs |logo= |screenshot = |caption = |developer = [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] |latest_release_version = |latest_release_date = |operating_system = [[Cross-platform]] |genre = Widget library |license = [[GNU Lesser General Public License|LGPL]] |website = [https://swinglabs.dev.java.net/ swinglabs.dev.java.net] }} '''swingLabs''' is a [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] [[Open source]] project proposing extensions to the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[Swing (Java)|Swing]] [[Widget toolkit|GUI toolkit]]. Available components include: * Sorting, filtering, highlighting for tables, trees, and lists * Find/search * [[Autocomplete|Auto-completion]] * Login/authentication framework * TreeTable component * Collapsible panel component * Date picker component * Tip-of-the-Day component The aim of the project is to experiment new or enhanced GUI functionalities that are required by [[Rich client]] applications. It acts as a testbed for ideas related to client side technologies. ==Integration into Java API== Successful project components are eventually incorporated into the core [[Swing (Java)|Swing]] toolkit for future Java versions, although API compatibility is not guaranteed. Examples of these are: * the '''{{Javadoc:SE|javax/swing|GroupLayout}}''' manager in [[Java SE 6]]<ref>GroupLayout was initially developed in conjunction with '''Matisse''', the GUI builder of [[NetBeans]].</ref>. * incorporation of the '''{{Javadoc:SE|java/awt|SystemTray}}''' in [[Java SE 6]]. * the new '''{{Javadoc:SE|java/awt|Desktop}}''' class in [[Java SE 6]], which allows to launch easily associated applications registered on the native desktop, as for example : launching the user-default browser, launching the user-default mail client, launching a registered application to open, edit or print a specified file. ==License== The project is distributed under a [[GNU Lesser General Public License|LGPL]] license. ==Sub-projects== The [https://swinglabs.dev.java.net/ swingLabs project] is divided into several sub-projects.
