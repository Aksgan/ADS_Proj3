The three founders soon found in their own school the drummer [[Munetaka Higuchi]] and the keyboard player [[Shunji Inoue]] to complete the line-up. The name Lazy was taken from [[Deep Purple]]'s song with the same name and the music the new band wanted to play was orientated towards [[hard rock]]. Managers and producers instead envisioned the young musicians as ideal prototypes for pop icons and created, through the use of monikers, costumes and well-balanced singles, a successful [[boy band]] for the Japanese market of teen-agers. In contrast with these decisions, the band members started writing and recording their own music, slowly changing the sound of the band from easy-listening pop-rock to hard rock. A growing unsatisfaction for the direction the band had taken and the need to express their musical ability brought anyway to a split-up in 1981. All former members became known on their own, mainly in the soundtrack recording business, or formed other bands like [[Loudness (band)|Loudness]]. They reformed in 1997 for a new album and a tour and again in the following years to do several projects together. In September 2006 bassist Tanaka died of heart failure. Their most recent joint-project, along with Kageyama's [[JAM Project]], is the single {{nihongo|''Kanjite Knight''|感じてKnight}}, for the [[anime]] ''[[Shin Mazinger Shogeki! Z Hen]]'', performed under the name '''Ultimate Lazy for Mazinger'''. On November 30, 2008, also drummer Higuchi died at the age of 49.<ref>{{citation|title= Blabbermouth.net |year=2008 |publisher= [[Roadrunner Records]] |location= Los Angeles| url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=109888 | accessdate = 2008-10-30}}</ref> ==Original members== *[[Vocal]]: [[Hironobu Kageyama]] "Michell" *[[Guitar]]: [[Akira Takasaki]] "Suzy" *[[Bass (guitar)|Bass]]: [[Hiroyuki Tanaka (bassist)|Hiroyuki Tanaka]] "Funny" (deceased) *[[Keyboard instrument|Keyboard]]: [[Shunji Inoue]] "Pocky" *[[Drums]]: [[Munetaka Higuchi]] "Davy" (deceased) ==Other members== *[[Tamio Okuda]] has participated in some Lazy projects since the deaths of Hiroyuki Tanaka and Munetaka Higuchi. *[[Kazuyoshi Saito]] has participated in some Lazy projects since the deaths of Hiroyuki Tanaka and Munetaka Higuchi. == Discography == ===Studio albums=== * ''This Is the Lazy'' (1978/03/05)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudness.awardspace.com/main.php?L=e&M=3&V=disco/others-lazy&P=0&C=1 |title=Lazy Discography |accessdate=2010-03-31 |date=2007-05-27 |publisher=Lightning Strikes Loudly }}</ref> * ''Dream a Dream'' (1978/12/05) * ''Rock Diamond'' (1979/09/05) * ''Lazy V'' (1980/04/05) * ''Earth Ark (Uchuusen Chikyuugou)'' (1980/12/16) * ''Happy Time'' (1998/07/21) * ''Earth Ark II (Uchuusen Chikyuugou II)'' (2002/11/06) ===EPs=== * ''Angelique: Eien no Yakusoku'' (2001/01/24) * ''Zone of the Enders'' (2001/05/23) ===Live albums=== * ''Lazy wo Oikakero'' (1978/05/06) * ''Moetsukita Seishun''(1981/04/05) * ''Happy Time Tour '98: Kuro Tokin no Nasu ga Mama'' (1998/04/21) ===Compilation albums=== * ''Collection - Jounetsu no Seishun'' (1979/03/21) * ''Best Hit Lazy'' (1980/12/01) * ''Best'' (1981) * ''Best Collection 1977-1981'' (1999/02/21) * ''Hit Collection'' (1999/11/20) * ''Golden Best'' (2004/12/22) ===Singles=== {| class="wikitable" !
