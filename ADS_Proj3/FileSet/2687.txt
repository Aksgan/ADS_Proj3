[[Sinn Féin]] vice-president [[Gerry Adams]] said of Mountbatten's death: <blockquote>The IRA gave clear reasons for the execution. I think it is unfortunate that anyone has to be killed, but the furore created by Mountbatten's death showed up the hypocritical attitude of the media establishment. As a member of the House of Lords, Mountbatten was an emotional figure in both British and Irish politics. What the IRA did to him is what Mountbatten had been doing all his life to other people; and with his war record I don't think he could have objected to dying in what was clearly a war situation. He knew the danger involved in coming to this country. In my opinion, the IRA achieved its objective: people started paying attention to what was happening in Ireland.<ref name="time">{{Cite news| title = It is "Clearly a War Situation" | author = Louisa Wright | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,948791-1,00.html | publisher = ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' | date = 19 November 1979 | accessdate = 2007-09-02}}</ref></blockquote> On the same day Mountbatten was assassinated, the IRA also ambushed and killed eighteen [[British Army]] soldiers, sixteen of them from the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] at [[Warrenpoint]], [[County Down]], in what became known as the [[Warrenpoint ambush]].
