much harder to explain. Second, the lack of a strong cryptographic tradition suggests - almost requires - a correspondingly weak cryptanalytic tradition. In fact there seems to be no cryptanalysis in Japanese history before the late 19th century. ==See also== * [[PURPLE]] * [[JADE]] * [[RED (cipher machine)|RED]] * [[Japanese naval codes]] * [[Japanese cryptology from the 1500s to Meiji]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Cryptography In Japan}} [[Category:History of cryptography]] [[Category:Science and technology in Japan]]</text> </page> <page> <id>8628</id> <title>Cryptography laws in different nations</title> <text>{{Unreferenced stub|auto=yes|date=December 2009}} {{Orphan|date=December 2009}} [[Cryptography]] is the practice and study of hiding [[information]]. There are many different '''cryptography laws in different nations'''. Some countries prohibit export of cryptography software and/or [[encryption algorithm]]s or [[cryptoanalysis]] methods. In some countries a license is required to use encryption software, and a few countries ban citizens from encrypting their internet communication. Some countries require decryption keys to be recoverable in case of a police investigation. ==See also== *[[Official Secrets Act (United Kingdom)|Official Secrets Act]] ([[United Kingdom]]) *[[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]] ([[United Kingdom]]) *[[Restrictions on the Import of Cryptography]] *[[Export of cryptography]] *[[Key disclosure law]] *[[United States v.

One is used by the cryptographic community, while the other is the meaning understood by the public. == General meaning == In this meaning, the term cryptosystem is used as shorthand for "cryptographic system". A cryptographic system is any [[computer system]] that involves [[cryptography]]. Such systems include for instance, a system for secure [[e-mail|electronic mail]] which might include methods for [[digital signature]]s, [[cryptographic hash function]]s, [[key management]] techniques, and so on. Cryptographic systems are made up of [[cryptographic primitive]]s, and are usually rather complex. Because of this, breaking a cryptosystem is not restricted to breaking the underlying cryptographic algorithms - usually it is far easier to break the system as a whole, eg, through the not uncommon misconceptions of users in respect to the cryptosystem. == Meaning in the context of cryptography == In this meaning, a cryptosystem refers to a suite of [[algorithm]]s needed to implement a particular form of [[encryption]] and [[decryption]]. Typically, a cryptosystem consists of three algorithms: one for [[key (cryptography)|key]] generation, one for encryption, and one for decryption. The term ''cipher'' (sometimes ''cypher'') is often used to refer to a pair of algorithms, one for encryption and one for decryption. Therefore, the term "cryptosystem" is most often used when the key generation algorithm is important. For this reason, the term "cryptosystem" is commonly used to refer to [[public key cryptography|public key]] techniques; however both "cipher" and "cryptosystem" are used for [[Symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric key]] techniques. == "Cryptographic system" vs. "cryptosystem" == The ''Internet Security Glossary'' RFC 2828 dissuades from using the term "cryptosystem", giving the following definitions. ;cryptosystem :(D) [[Internet standard|ISD]]s SHOULD NOT use this term as an abbreviation for cryptographic system. (For rationale, see: crypto.) ;crypto :Except as part of certain long-established terms listed in this Glossary, [[Internet standard|ISD]]s SHOULD NOT use this abbreviated term because it may be misunderstood. Instead, use "cryptography" or "cryptographic". {{Crypto navbox}} [[Category:Cryptography]] {{Crypto-stub}} [[da:Kryptosystem]] [[de:Kryptosystem]] [[eu:Kriptosistema]] [[fr:Cryptosystème]] [[nl:Cryptosysteem]] [[pl:Kryptosystem]] [[pt:Sistema criptográfico]] [[simple:Cryptosystem]] [[uk:Криптосистема]]</text> </page> <page> <id>8680</id> <title>Cult-Proofing Your Kids</title> <text>{{Infobox Book | name = Cult-Proofing Your Kids | title_orig = | translator = | image = [[Image:CultProofingYourKids.png|130px|Cult-Proofing Your Kids cover]] | image_caption = | author = [[Dr. Paul R.
