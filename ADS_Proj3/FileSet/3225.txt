concept is functionally equivalent to NetWare v3.x Bindery services with NetWare Name Services added on (e.g. a 2-dimensional database, with a flat namespace and a static schema). For a while, Novell also marketed an [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] version of NetWare 3, called '''Portable NetWare''', together with OEMs such as [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] and [[Data General]], who ported Novell source code to run on top of their Unix operating systems. Portable NetWare did not sell well. While Netware 3.x was current, Novell introduced its first high-availability clustering system, named '''NetWare SFT-III''', which allowed a logical server to be completely mirrored to a separate physical machine. Implemented as a [[Shared nothing architecture|shared-nothing]] cluster, under SFT-III the OS was logically split into an interrupt-driven ''I/O engine'' and the event-driven OS core. The I/O engines serialized their interrupts (disk, network etc.) into a combined event stream that was fed to two identical copies of the system engine through a fast (typically 100 Mbit/s) inter-server link. Because of its non-preemptive nature, the OS core, stripped of non-deterministic I/O, behaves deterministically, like a large [[finite state machine]]. The outputs of the two system engines were compared to ensure proper operation, and two copies fed back to the I/O engines. Using the existing SFT-II software RAID functionality present in the core, disks could be mirrored between the two machines without special hardware. The two machines could be separated as far as the server-to-server link would permit. In case of a server or disk failure, the surviving server could take over client sessions transparently after a short pause since it had full state information and did not, for example, have to re-mount the volumes - a process at which NetWare was notoriously slow. SFT-III was the first NetWare version able to make use of [[symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]] hardware - the I/O engine could optionally be run on its own CPU. The modern incarnation of NetWare's clustering, Novell Cluster Services (introduced in NetWare v5.0), is very different from SFT-III. NetWare SFT-III, ahead of its time in several ways, was a mixed success. Novell designed NetWare 386 3.x to run all applications on the server at the same level of processor [[memory protection]], known as "[[ring 0]]". While this provided the best possible performance, it sacrificed reliability. The result was that crashing (known as ''[[abend]]s'', short for ''abnormal ends'') were possible and would result in stopping the system. Starting with NetWare 5.x, software modules (NetWare Loadable Modules or NLM's) could be assigned to run in different processor protection rings, ensuring that a software error would not crash the system. === NetWare 4.x === Version 4 in 1993 also introduced NetWare Directory Services, later re-branded as [[Novell Directory Services]] (NDS), based on [[X.500]], which replaced the Bindery with a global [[directory service]], in which the infrastructure was described and managed in a single place. Additionally, NDS provided an extensible [[Database schema|schema]], allowing the introduction of new object types. This allowed a single user authentication to NDS to govern access to any server in the directory tree structure. Users could therefore access network resources no matter on which server they resided, although user license counts were still tied to individual servers. (Large enterprises could opt for a license model giving them essentially unlimited per-server users if they let Novell audit their total user count) Version 4 also introduced a number of useful tools and features, such as transparent compression at file system level and [[RSA]] public/private [[encryption]]. Another new feature was the NetWare Asynchronous Services Interface (NASI). It allowed network sharing of multiple serial devices, such as [[modems]]. Client port redirection occurred via an [[MS-DOS]] or [[Microsoft Windows]] driver allowing companies to consolidate modems and [[plain old telephone service|analog phone]] lines.<ref>[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/iosswrel/ps1828/products_configuration_guide_chapter09186a008008724f.html Cisco IOS Release 12.0 Dial Solutions Configuration Guide - Configure Support for NASI Clients to Access Network Resources]</ref> === Strategic mistakes === Novell's strategy with NetWare 286 2.x and 3.x proved very successful; before the arrival of [[Windows NT]] Server, Novell claimed 90% of the market for PC based servers. While the design of NetWare 3.x and later involved a DOS partition to load NetWare server files, this feature became a liability as new users preferred the Windows graphical interface to learning DOS commands necessary to build and control a NetWare server. Novell could have eliminated this technical liability by retaining the design of NetWare 286, which installed the server file into a Novell partition and allowed the server to boot from the Novell partition without creating a bootable DOS partition. Novell finally added support for this in a Support Pack for NetWare 6.5. As Novell used [[IPX/SPX]] instead of [[TCP/IP]], they were poorly positioned to take advantage of the Internet in 1995. This resulted in Novell servers being bypassed for routing and Internet access, in favor of hardware routers, [[Unix]]-based operating systems such as [[FreeBSD]], and [[SOCKS]] and HTTP [[Proxy server|Proxy Servers]] on Windows and other operating systems.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} === NetWare 4.1x and NetWare for Small Business: Novell begins to recover === Novell priced NetWare 4.10 similarly to NetWare 3.12, allowing customers who resisted NDS (typically small businesses) to try it at no cost. Later Novell released NetWare version 4.11 in 1996 which included many enhancements that made the operating system easier to install, easier to operate, faster, and more stable. It also included the first full 32-bit client for [[Microsoft Windows]]-based workstations, [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]] support and the NetWare Administrator (NWADMIN or NWADMN32), a GUI-based administration tool for NetWare. Previous administration tools used the [[Cworthy]] interface, the character-based GUI tools such as SYSCON and PCONSOLE with blue text-based background. Some of these tools survive to this day, for instance MONITOR.NLM. Novell packaged NetWare 4.11 with its Web server, TCP/IP support and the [[Netscape]] browser into a bundle dubbed '''IntranetWare''' (also written as intraNetWare). A version designed for networks of 25 or fewer users was named '''IntranetWare for Small Business''' and contained a limited version of NDS and tried to simplify NDS administration. The intranetWare name was dropped in NetWare
