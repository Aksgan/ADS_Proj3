In the UK, There is no formal qualification for persons carrying out PAT Testing. The Electricity at Work regulations of 1989 simply state that inspecting and testing must be carried out by a competent person, however does not mention a benchmark for competency. It has become accepted practice, however, for individuals operating as PAT Testers to hold a City and Guilds qualification. PAT Testers in the UK do not need to be electricians or have a background in the electrical industry. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.pattestglasgow.co.uk | work=PAT Test Glasgow | title=PAT Testing FAQs | first=Edward | last=Grice | date=2010-12-01}}</ref> ==Carrying out PAT Testing== [[File:ToasterPAT.JPG|right|thumb|PAT testing a sandwich toaster]] This can be done by hiring an external company to test all the electrical products in a business or it can be done in-house by someone who has had some PAT training, either by an official qualification or by attending a health and safety course offered by some electrical health and safety companies. The following steps are taken when testing a business' electrical equipment. ===User checks=== Advising the user of potential danger signs can result in problems being picked up before they can result in any danger. For example, if the power cable is frayed or the plug is cracked, users need to be advised NOT TO USE the appliance and report the fault to a supervisor. This information can be put across, say by the use of a poster or in a memo. User checks are always carried out before operation, and the results are generally not recorded, unless a defect is identified. ===Formal visual inspections=== This is a process of simply inspecting the appliance, the cable and the plug for any obvious signs of damage. According to the HSE, this process can find more than 90% of faults. ===Combined inspections and PAT testing=== At periodic intervals, it is essential to test the portable appliances to measure that the degree of protection to ensure that it is adequate. At these intervals, a formal visual inspection is carried out and then followed by PAT testing. Note the inside of the plug MUST be checked unless it is moulded or there is an unbroken seal covering the screws (bad internal wiring or an unsuitable fuse would cause the item to be classed as dangerous). The tests that an individual must carry out to declare an item electrically safe is dependant on the class of construction (shown below). Some of these tests are: *Earth Continuity *Insulation Resistance *Polarity of Wiring [[Image:Primetest_Family.jpg|thumb|right|PAT testers are available for all test needs]] == Class of Construction == Electrical appliances are differentiated by a series of IEC protection classes. In PAT Testing it is essential for the person PAT Testing to know the difference in classes and therefore what checks must be completed before declaring the item electrically safe. '''Class I''' - Single insulated wiring, which requires an earth connection. There is no symbol for a Class I product so if a rating plate has no symbol on it then it is usually Class I. '''Class II''' - Double insulated wiring, therefore no need for a earth lead. Class II is indicated by double box. '''Class III''' - These are appliances that are supplied at a low voltage (usually called Separated Extra Low Voltage) which must be less than 50V. These appliances are supplied with a transformer supply that is also marked. ===Other=== '''''Class 0''''' - Non-earthed metal appliance with two core cable. Sales of these items have been banned since 1975. '''''Class 01''''' - As Class 0 but appliance has an earth terminal which is unused since two core cable is used. See [[appliance classes]] for more info on class of construction. ==PAT Training and Qualifications== [[File:PATtest.JPG|right|thumb|PAT testing at a workbench]] It is not stated in the health and safety regulations for an individual to have any qualifications to PAT Test but it does state that it must be done by a competent person who has been given instruction - i.e. Someone who understands the process and can perform the necessary checks in a safe manner. It is therefore generally recommended that if a company wishes to PAT Test in-house then they have the person who will be doing the testing attend a portable appliance testing training course so as to fully understand what it is they are checking for. The only nationally recognized qualification of competence in PAT is offered by [[City and Guilds of London Institute|City & Guilds]]: 'Code of Practice for In-service Inspection and Testing of Electrical Equipment - Vocational 3 (No. 2377)'.<ref>[http://www.cityandguilds.com/cps/rde/xchg/SID-850C2351-18A457AB/cgonline/hs.xsl/1779.html?search_term=2377 City & Guilds 'Code of Practice for In-service Inspection and Testing of Electrical Equipment' qualification]</ref> although many other non-recognized PAT training courses are available. ==Types of PAT Testers== There are many different types of PAT testers available. The main kind for businesses are simple PASS/FAIL PAT testers that are very easy to use, and are aimed at in-house PAT testing. To use the majority of them, one does not require a high level of electrical skill. There are also advanced PAT Testers, which give much more information and testing features but are mainly aimed at competent persons qualified to City & Guilds 2377 or EAL . To use the majority of these testers, one does require a higher level of electrical skill. ===Pass / Fail PAT Testers=== These are the simple-to-use and comparatively much cheaper Portable Appliance Testers for most businesses who will test in-house to carry out the testing and suitable for a wide range of businesses. They simply say PASS or FAIL when a test is carried out. Battery operated PAT testers are particularly useful in getting into those awkward spaces to PAT Test. As with any inspections, it is important the test results are recorded onto a record sheet,or computer database, and stored in a safe place. At the basic level PAT test instruments are relatively simple to operate devices that carry out basic safety checks. Most are equipped with an earth continuity test, insulation resistance test and the ability
