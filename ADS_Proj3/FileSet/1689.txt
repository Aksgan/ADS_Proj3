Born in [[London]], Hudson was the sixth child of Charles Hudson, an artist and stained-glass window designer. By the age of 14 he had already built up a collection of British insects, and had published a paper in ''The Entomologist''. In 1881 Hudson moved with his father to [[Nelson, New Zealand]]. He worked on a farm, and in 1883, aged 16, he began working at the post office in Wellington, where he eventually became Chief Clerk, retiring in 1918.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=J.T.

The main aim of the expedition was to extend the magnetic survey of New Zealand by investigating Auckland and Campbell Islands but botanical, biological and zoological surveys were also conducted. The voyage also resulted in rescue of the castaways of the shipwreck the ''[[Dundonald (ship)|Dundonald]]'' in the Auckland Islands. Although best known for his entomology, Hudson was also an astronomer, and invented [[daylight saving time]]. His [[shift work|shift-work]] job gave him leisure time to collect insects, and made him aware of the value of after-hours daylight.<ref>{{vcite book |author=George Gibbs |chapter=Hudson, George Vernon 1867–1946 |editor=- |title=Dictionary of New Zealand Biography |url=http://www.dnzb.govt.nz/ |date=1996 |chapterupdate=updated 2007-06-22 |chapterurl=http://www.dnzb.govt.nz/dnzb/default.asp?Find_Quick.asp?PersonEssay=3H42 }}</ref> In 1895 he presented a paper to the Wellington Philosophical Society proposing a two-hour daylight-saving shift,<ref>{{vcite journal |author=G.
