the game highly dynamic. ===Basic concepts=== {{main|Go terms}} Basic strategic aspects include the following: * Connection: Keeping one's own stones connected means that fewer groups need defense. * Cut: Keeping opposing stones disconnected means that the opponent needs to defend more groups. * Life: This is the ability of stones to permanently avoid capture. The simplest and usual way is for the group to surround two eyes (separate empty areas), so that filling one eye will not kill the group; as a result, any such move is suicidal and the group cannot be captured. The fundamental strategy of Go is to create groups with life while preventing one's opponent from doing the same. * Mutual life (seki): A situation in which neither player can play to a particular point without then allowing the other player to play at another point to capture. The most common example is that of adjacent groups that share their last few liberties. If either player plays in the shared liberties, they reduce their own group to a single liberty (putting themselves in ''atari''), allowing their opponent to capture it on the next move. * Death: The absence of life coupled with the inability to create it, resulting in the eventual removal of a group. * Invasion: Setting up a new living position inside an area where the opponent has greater influence, as a means of balancing territory. * Reduction: Placing a stone far enough into the opponent's area of influence to reduce the amount of territory they will eventually get, but not so far in that it can be cut off from friendly stones outside. * Sente: A play that forces one's opponent to respond (''[[Go terms|gote]]''), such as placing an opponent's group in ''atari'' (immediate danger of capture). A player who can regularly play ''sente'' has the initiative, as in chess, and can control the flow of the game. * Sacrifice: Allowing a group to die in order to carry out a play, or plan, in a more important area. The strategy involved can become very abstract and complex. High-level players spend years improving their understanding of strategy, and a novice may play many hundreds of games against opponents before being able to win regularly. ===Opening strategy=== In the opening of the game, players will usually play in the corners of the board first, as the presence of two edges make it easier for them to surround territory and establish their stones.<ref name=Opening>{{citation | last = Otake | first = Hideo | title = Opening Theory Made Easy | publisher = Kiseido Publishing Company | isbn = 490657436X | year = 2002 }}</ref> After the corners, focus moves to the sides, where there is still one edge to support a player's stones. Opening moves are generally on the third and fourth line from the edge, with occasional moves on the second and fifth lines. In general, stones on the third line offer stability and are good defensive moves, whereas stones on the fourth line influence more of the board and are good attacking moves. In the opening, players often play established sequences called [[joseki]], which are locally balanced exchanges;<ref name=Joseki>{{citation | last = Ishida | first = Yoshio | title = Dictionary of Basic Joseki | year = 1977 | publisher = Kiseido Publishing Company}}</ref> however, the joseki chosen should also produce a satisfactory result on a global scale. It is generally advisable to keep a balance between territory and influence. Which of these gets precedence is often a matter of individual taste. ===Phases of the game=== While the opening moves in a game have a distinct set of aims, they usually make up only 10% to at most 20% of the game. In other words, in a game of 250 moves, there may be around 30 or so opening moves, with limited "fighting". At the end of such a game, there will also be perhaps 100 moves that are counted as "endgame", in which territories are finished off definitively and all issues on capturing stones become clear. The middle phase of the game is the most combative, and usually lasts for more than 100 moves. During the ''middlegame'', or just "the fighting", the players invade each others' frameworks, and attack weak groups, formations that lack the necessary ''two eyes'' for viability. Such groups must ''run away'', i.e. expand to avoid enclosure, giving a dynamic feeling to the struggle. It is quite possible that one player will succeed in capturing a large weak group of the opponent's, which will often prove decisive and end the game by a resignation. But matters may be more complex yet, with major trade-offs, apparently dead groups reviving, and skillful play to attack in such a way as to construct territories rather than to kill. The end of the middlegame and transition to the endgame is marked by a few features. The game breaks up into areas that do not affect each other (with a caveat about ''ko'' fights), where before the central area of the board related to all parts of it. No large weak groups are still in serious danger. Moves can reasonably be attributed some definite value, such as 20 points or fewer, rather than simply being necessary to compete. Both players set limited objectives in their plans, in making or destroying territory, capturing or saving stones. These changing aspects of the game usually occur at much the same time, for strong players. In brief, the middlegame switches into the endgame when the concepts of strategy and influence need reassessment in terms of concrete final results on the board. ==Computers and Go== ===Nature of the game=== {{seealso|Go and mathematics}} [[Image:AB pruning.svg|thumb|right|300px|Computers generally model the game as a tree of moves with values assigned to them.]] In [[combinatorial game theory]] terms, Go is a [[Zero-sum (game theory)|zero sum]], [[perfect information|perfect-information]], [[partisan game|partisan]], [[Deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]] [[strategy game]], putting it in the same class as chess, [[checkers]] (draughts) and [[Reversi]] (Othello); however it differs from these in its
