features, a multi-view affine [[structure from motion]] algorithm (see [Tomasi and Kanade 1992]) can be used to construct an estimate of points positions (up to an arbitrary affine transformation). The paper of Rothganger et al. therefore selects two adjacent views, uses a [[RANSAC]]-like method to select two corresponding pairs of features, and adds new features to the partial model built by RANSAC so long as they are under an error term. Thus for any given pair of adjacent views, the algorithm creates a partial model of all features visible in both views. [[Image:Features full 3d.png|right|thumb|322px|Final merged model of features for the teddy bear, after Euclidean upgrade. For recognition, this model is matched against a photograph of the scene using RANSAC. Taken from [Rothganger et al. 2004].]] To produce a unified model, the paper takes the largest partial model, and incrementally aligns all smaller partial models to it. Global minimization is used to reduce the error, then a [[Euclidean upgrade]] is used to change the model's feature positions from 3D coordinates unique up to affine transformation to 3D coordinates that are unique up to [[Euclidean motion]]. At the end of this step, one has a model of the target object, consisting of features projected into a common 3D space. To recognize an object in an arbitrary input image, the paper detects features, and then uses [[RANSAC]] to find the [[affine projection]] matrix which best fits the unified object model to the 2D scene. If this RANSAC approach has sufficiently low error, then on success, the algorithm both recognizes the object and gives the object's pose in terms of an affine projection. Under the assumed conditions, the method typically achieves recognition rates of around 95%. == References == * Murase, H. and S. K.

The company's stated goal is to democratize the use of 3D technology and establish it as the new media for consumer and professional users. The company has several product groups that are being assembled under the 3DVIA umbrella. For consumer markets, the company currently operates a 3D online community and model hosting website located at www.3dvia.com and provides a free modeling application named 3DVIA Shape. Through a partnership with [[Microsoft]], 3DVIA provides a version of this software for users to create models on [[Microsoft Virtual Earth]] under the name Virtual earth - 3DVIA. For the gaming and electronic entertainment industry, the offers a development platform for system integrators, game studios and corporate end-users through its [[Virtools]] brand name. Through a recent acquisition of Seemage, the company has launched the 3DVIA Composer product line that allows non-engineering staff at corporations to create 3D technical documentation. In a partnership with the [[Publicis Groupe]], 3DVIA has launched 3Dswym.com as a way for fortune 1000 marketers to co-create new products and services with their consumers using 3DVIA technologies. 3DVIA Studio a comprehensive development platform with a realistic real-time rendering engine significantly improve the game development process by quickly bringing ideas into reality and aiding developers in producing high-end, online experiences. ==References== {{morefootnotes|date=July 2010}} {{reflist}} *[http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1739765,00.html 3D Comes to Web 2.0] *[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/11/06/technology/dassault.php Dassault brings 3-D modeling to the masses] *[http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2007/06/26/2739942.htm Dassault Systemes Unveils 3DVIA] *[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20071128005649/en Dassault Systemes announces 3DVIA Composer] *[http://www.3dvia.com/blog/video-a-quick-tour-of-3dviacom/ Video - A Quick Tour of 3DVIA.com] ==External links== *[http://www.3dvia.com 3DVIA Website] [[Category:3D graphics software]] [[Category:Animation software]] [[Category:Product lifecycle management]] [[Category:Dassault]] [[fr:3DVIA]] [[sv:3dvia]]</text> </page> <page> <id>159</id> <title>4-bit</title> <text>{{Redirect|IA-4|the congressional district|Iowa's 4th congressional district}} {{No footnotes|date=October 2009}} {{N-bit|4|}} The [[Intel 4004]], the world's first commercially available single-[[integrated circuit|chip]] [[microprocessor]], was a 4-bit [[central processing unit|CPU]].

The [[1970s]] saw the emergence of 4-bit software applications for mass markets like pocket calculators. With 4 bits, it is possible to create 16 different values.
