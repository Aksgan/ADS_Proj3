are all identities--or can be recast as [[identity (mathematics)|identities]]--the structure is a [[variety (universal algebra)|variety]] (not to be confused with [[algebraic variety]] in the sense of [[algebraic geometry]]). Nonidentities can often be recast as identities. For example, any [[lattice (order)|lattice inequality]] of the form α≤β can always be recast as the identity α∧β=α. An important result is that given any variety '''C''' and any underlying set ''X'', the [[free object]] ''F''(''X'')∈'''C''' exists. ===Simple structures=== '''No''' [[binary operation]]. * [[Set (mathematics)|Set]]: a degenerate algebraic structure having no operations. * [[Pointed set]]: ''S'' has one or more distinguished elements. While pointed sets are near-trivial, they lead to [[discrete space]]s, which are not. **[[Bipointed set]]: ''S'' has exactly two distinguished elements. * Unary system: ''S'' and a single [[unary operation]] over ''S''. * Pointed unary system: a unary system with ''S'' a pointed set. ===Group-like structures=== {{Group-like structures}} See [[Magma (algebra)|magma]] for a list of the many properties that a group-like structures may possess. The diagram to the right summarizes the defining properties of: * The better-known group-like structures, from the least (magmas) to the most restrictive (groups); * The related notions of [[category (mathematics)|category]] and [[groupoid]]. All group-like structures feature a primary (and often unique) [[binary operation|binary]] or [[ternary operation]], which usually (e.g., for [[semigroup]]s and hoops) [[associativity|associates]]. This operation will nearly always be denoted here by concatenation, and when it is binary, will be called "group product." If group product associates, brackets are not required to resolve the order of operation. When group product does not associate (e.g., [[quasigroup]]s, [[heap (mathematics)|semiheaps]], [[quasigroup|loops]], implication algebras), an embedded period indicates the grouping. Examples: ''xy''.''z'', ''x''.''yz''. For [[Steiner system|Steiner magmas]], [[abelian group]]s, [[logic algebra]]s, [[Band (mathematics)|bands]], equivalence algebras, and [[hoop (mathematics)|hoops]], group product also commutes. [[Commutativity]] may be added to any group-like structure for which it is not already the case. [[Group (mathematics)|Groups]], [[logic algebra]]s, [[lattice (order)|lattices]], and [[loop (algebra)|loops]] feature a [[unary operation]], denoted here by enclosure in parentheses. For [[monoid]]s, [[loop (algebra)|loops]], and sloops, ''S'' is a [[pointed set]]. '''One''' [[binary operation]]. * [[Magma (algebra)|Magma or groupoid]]: ''S'' is closed under a single [[binary operation]]. **[[Steiner system|Steiner magma]]: A [[commutative]] magma satisfying ''x''.''xy'' = ''y''. *** [[Steiner system|Squag]]: an [[idempotent]] Steiner magma.<ref>Wolfram, Steven (2002) ''[[A New Kind of Science]]'', p. 1171.</ref> *** [[Steiner system|Sloop]]: a Steiner magma with distinguished element 1, such that ''xx'' = 1. **[[Quandle|Rack]]: A magma satisfying the identity ''xy.z'' = ''xz''.''yz''.
