In this way [[mod (computer gaming)|third-party mods]], and games not purchased through the Steam Store, can use Steam features. Valve sponsors and distributes some mods for free,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://storefront.steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/message/1843/|title=Steam mod hosting announcement|publisher=Valve Corporation|accessdate=2008-10-01}}</ref> and mods that use [[#Steamworks|Steamworks]] can also use VAC, Friends, the server browser, and any Steam features supported by their parent game. ===Multiplayer lobbies and matchmaking=== Introduced in ''[[Left 4 Dead]]'' and made available through [[#Steamworks|Steamworks]], a lobby system allows for players to organize and agree on game settings before joining a server and a matchmaking system can automatically group players together based on a certain criteria. ===Steam Community=== [[File:Steam community.PNG|thumb|The Steam Community's homepage]] On September 12, 2007, Valve released the Steam Community, a [[social network service]] that allows Steam users to communicate with each other on a [[many-to-many]] scale.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.joystiq.com/2007/09/13/steam-community-officially-launched/ | title = Steam Community officially launched | first = Ross | last = Miller | date = 13 September 2007 | publisher = [[Joystiq]] | accessdate = 18 January 2010 }}</ref> It is accessible from both the desktop (in a [[web browser]] or the Steam client) and through an "overlay" program that can be viewed on top of 3D-accelerated games. In January 2010, Valve reported that 10 million of the 25 million active Steam accounts had signed up to Steam Community.<ref name="steamgrowth_2009">{{Cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/news/3390/|title=Steam Realizes Extraordinary Growth in 2009|date=2010-01-29|publisher=Valve Corporation|accessdate=29 January 2010}}</ref> Notwithstanding privacy settings, a user's page includes some brief personal information, links to any friends' user pages, details of any games owned, the number of hours of playtime during the past two weeks, a 0–10 "Steam Rating" of activity,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_rating|title=Steam rating|work=Valve Developer Community|accessdate=November 3, 2007}}</ref> and links to any groups of which the user is a member.

For supported games, Steam Cloud stores various amounts of game data, such as keyboard shortcut settings and single-player game saves, on a central server. Any changes to relevant game files are uploaded to the main server, and newer files are automatically downloaded and used when a game is started.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/52906|title=Valve Announces Steam Cloud; Online Network to Store Saved Games Indefinitely|last=Breckon|first=Nick|date=May 29, 2008|accessdate=September 3, 2008|publisher=[[Shacknews]]}}</ref> Valve launched the service simultaneously with the release of ''[[Left 4 Dead]]'', and the service now supports most newer Valve games.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/55705|title=Steam Cloud Launching With Left 4 Dead; Custom Settings To Be Automatically Backed Up, Applied|last=Faylor|first=Chris|date=September 3, 2008|accessdate=September 3, 2008|publisher=[[Shacknews]]}}</ref> It is one of the services offered to game developers through [[#Steamworks|Steamworks]].

New DLC releases are listed alongside full games in the "New Releases" section on the storefront. ===File system=== Steam-integrated games are stored as single non-compressed archive files with the extension <code>.gcf</code> (an acronym for '''G'''ame '''C'''ache '''F'''ile<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://supportwiki.steampowered.com/wiki/Game_cache_file_(GCF) | title = Game cache file (GCF) | accessdate = 20 January 2010 }}</ref>). Steam allocates space on the user's hard disk for <code>.gcf</code> files before downloading in order to reduce fragmentation which may occur when downloading large files and performing disk access. Game Cache Files help to make games more portable, stop users from accidentally overwriting important files, allow for easy modification of resources, and allows for validation of content for errors.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.wunderboy.org/docs/gcfformat.php | title = Steam GCF File Format | publisher = [http://www.wunderboy.org/index.php Wunderboy.org] | accessdate = 20 January 2010 }}</ref> For games that do not integrate, a 'No Cache File' system is provided.

The game will then act in every way like a digital copy. All of Valve's post-Steam games are sold in this fashion, as are around 20 third party titles (most notably the ''Call of Duty'' series, from ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2|Modern Warfare 2]]'' onward).<ref name="steamworks-home">{{cite web|title=Steamworks homepage|url=http://www.steampowered.com/steamworks/|publisher=Valve|accessdate=November 30th 2010}}</ref> ===Statistics collection=== Steam collects and reports anonymous metrics of its usage, stability, and performance.<ref name="valveprivacypolicy">{{Cite web|url=http://www.valvesoftware.com/privacy.htm|title=Valve Privacy Policy|publisher=Valve Corporation|accessdate=2007-10-25}}</ref> With the exception of Valve's hardware survey,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/ hardware survey|title=Valve Hardware Survey |publisher=Valve Corporation|accessdate=2010-07-10}}</ref> most collection occurs without notifying the user or offering an opt-out.
