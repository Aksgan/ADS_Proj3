Teams compete by writing an [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] for a game (the type of which varies from year to year). After a day of coding and debugging, teams compete in an elimination tournament shown on a wall-sized projection screen. ==1995 - MechMania: "It's Stompin' Time"== {{Inappropriate tone|date=October 2007}} [[Image:mm logo.gif|thumb|MMI logo.

MechMania - "It's Stompin' Time" will provide the opportunity for up to twelve teams of three people each to out wit each other on the game field. We will provide a networked game server and a basic network game client. Each team will have one day to write C++ classes that override the default [[Mech]] behaviors. The first task of your code will be to choose an army of Scout, Light, and Heavy Mechs, and armor your base with a given number of resource points. You can override behaviors for all of the Mechs, or you can modify behaviors for each individual type of Mech. Suggested behaviors include scouting the position of the opponent's Mechs and base, guarding your own base, and attacking opponent's forces. ===Story=== The story so far…It wasn't your fault that the navigation computer made a division error and sent the jumpship off course into hostile territory. Ever since you signed on it was obvious that this jumpship was not exactly what you might call "cutting edge technology," but she had it where it counts. At least that is what the captain told you. Overall he was a pretty good man, except for his annoying habit of calling you "kid." But heck, the pay wasn't bad. When you were called to the bridge to help get the system back online, you noticed for the first time a stack of 62 CD-ROMs jammed behind the computer. Your heart sank when you pulled them out and realized they were the install disks for a stolen beta copy of the Klingon version of Windows 95 (the 2395 version, build #12564). You never realized the ship was in such a sad shape. Such is life. After five or six reboots and the reconfiguration of a few drivers, things began to look better. The crew managed to get the ship turned around and heading back to your own territory when you finally got the nav system back online. With the final checks completed, you enganged the nav system -- and the ship promptly turned around and headed back into hostile territory. It seems that whoever wrote the control code for the engine system forgot to seed the random number generator feeding the [[Infinite Improbability Drive]], so the ship was doomed to forever repeat its own mistakes. So much for doing things the easy way. Disengaging the nav system, it was time to find somewhere to hide out until things could be worked out. After scanning the area, you put the ship into a low orbit around a very unfriendly looking planet. The large amount of electrical subspace distortions and anti-tachyon particle emissions from the planet would make it difficult for other ships to accurately scan the area. It was the perfect hiding place. At least it would have been if the weapons computer hadn't been accidentally crosswired to one of the recreational systems running a copy of ''[[Doom (video game)|Doom]] XXVII''. Things were tense when a small patrol was spotted, but there was no possible way they could have detected the ship at that range. No possible way until the weapons computer got confused with what was reality and what was not and open fired on the patrol. This was just not your day. ---- With the nav computer in infinite loops (in more ways than one) and the weapons computer busy blasting away mythical beasts with its BFG, there was little question it was time to bail. Your only hope of surviving was to pile into one of the dropships and descend to the planet. With a little luck the fast approaching patrol would not even notice the small dropship ejecting from the jumpship. Luck has been against you all day, why should that change? The trip down was no joyride. The sensors showed an atmosphere heavy with particulate matter and London dispersion forces. You never have figured out just what London dispersion forces are, but they don't sound good. The sensors are amuck…the landing system was having a hard time calculating exact altitudes, and ended up correcting for a 200 meter error by running into the ground. The ship looks like it will hold together, but weapons system are out, and it doesn't look like you are going to be taking off anytime soon. To make matters worse the sensors were able to pick up the image of an enemy dropship following you down. The only good thing is that it seems they have taken just as much damage from the trip down as you have. There are very few options you have left. The dropship is packed with fully armed mechs, but most of the
