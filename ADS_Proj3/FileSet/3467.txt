being recognized as issues that could continue if unabated. As a result, PBL was advocated by the U.S. DoD in its annual [[Quadrennial Defense Review]] in 2001. Since then, not only the U.S. DoD, but other countries as well have adopted this system sustainment strategy as many programs that have employed it have yielded increased system availability, shorter maintenance cycles, and/or reduced costs. Since inception of the PBL concept, there have been numerous examples of DoD systems that have yielded the anticipated results, and many that have exceeded – some extremely so – the performance expectations. Annual PBL awards highlight three notable achievements; one for component-level PBL arrangements; one for sub-systems; and one for system-level or platform-level PBLs. Partially in response to some who believed that PBL concepts were still not adequate, and to assess the current state of DoD systems sustainment, DoD’s Office of the Assistant Deputy Secretary of Defense for Materiel Readiness (OADUSD(MR) initiated a Weapon System Acquisition Reform Product Support Assessment in 2009. Its final report was signed by Ashton B. Carter, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics. The report affirms the essence of the PBL concept by stating, “there remains a strong consensus that an outcome-based, performance-oriented product support strategy is a worthy objective…” It further identified eight areas that would make product support even more effective, if developed and improved: # Product Support Business Model # Industrial Integration Strategy # Supply Chain Operational Strategy # Governance # Metrics # Operating and Support Costs # Analytical Tools # Human Capital == See also == * [[Cost-plus contract]] * [[Fixed_price#Fixed-price contract|Fixed price contract]] * [[Military surplus]] == References == {{reflist}} http://www.acq.osd.mil/log/mr/pbl_awards.html http://www.acq.osd.mil/log/mr/index.html acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=333813 http://www.acq.osd.mil/bio.html 2.

The most important examples are the [[trigonometric functions]], which repeat over intervals of length 2''&pi;''. Periodic functions are used throughout science to describe [[oscillation]]s, [[wave]]s, and other phenomena that exhibit [[Frequency|periodicity]]. Any function which is not periodic is called '''aperiodic'''. [[Image:Periodic function illustration.svg|thumb|right|300px|An illustration of a periodic function with period <math>P.</math>]] ==Definition== A function ''f'' is said to be '''periodic''' if (for some nonzero constant ''P'') we have :<math>f(x+P) = f(x) \,\!</math> for all values of ''x''. The least positive<ref>For some functions, like a [[constant function]] or the [[indicator function]] of the [[rational number]]s, a least positive "period" may not exist (the [[infimum]] of possible positve ''P'' being zero).</ref> constant ''P'' with this property is called the '''period'''. A function with period ''P'' will repeat on intervals of length ''P'', and these intervals are sometimes also referred to as '''periods'''. Geometrically, a periodic function can be defined as a function whose graph exhibits [[translational symmetry]]. Specifically, a function ''f'' is periodic with period ''P'' if the graph of ''f'' is [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under [[translation (geometry)|translation]] in the ''x''-direction by a distance of ''P''. This definition of periodic can be extended to other geometric shapes and patterns, such as periodic [[tessellation]]s of the plane. A function that is not periodic is called '''aperiodic'''. ==Examples== [[Image:Sine.svg|thumb|right|350px|A graph of the sine function, showing two complete periods.]] For example, the [[sine function]] is periodic with period 2''&pi;'', since :<math>\sin(x + 2\pi) = \sin(x) \,\!</math> for all values of ''x''. This function repeats on intervals of length 2''&pi;'' (see the graph to the right). Everyday examples are seen when the variable is ''time''; for instance the hands of a [[clock]] or the phases of the [[moon]] show periodic behaviour. '''Periodic motion''' is motion in which the position(s) of the system are expressible as periodic functions, all with the ''same'' period. For a function on the [[real number]]s or on the [[integer]]s, that means that the entire [[Graph of a function|graph]] can be formed from copies of one particular portion, repeated at regular intervals. A simple example of a periodic function is the function ''f'' that gives the "fractional part" of its argument. Its period is 1. In particular, : ''f''( 0.5 ) = ''f''( 1.5 ) = ''f''( 2.5 ) = ... = 0.5. The graph of the function ''f'' is the [[sawtooth wave]]. [[Image:Sine cosine plot.svg|300px|right|thumb|A plot of ''f''(''x'') = sin(''x'') and ''g''(''x'') = cos(''x''); both functions are periodic with period 2&pi;.]] The [[trigonometric function]]s sine and cosine are common periodic functions, with period 2π (see the figure on the right). The subject of [[Fourier series]] investigates the idea that an 'arbitrary' periodic function is a sum of trigonometric functions with matching periods. According to the definition above, some exotic functions, for example the [[Dirichlet function]], are also periodic; in the case of [[Dirichlet function]], any nonzero rational number is a period. ==Properties== <!-- '''periodicity with period zero''' ''P'' ''' greater than zero if !--> If a function ''f'' is periodic with period ''P'', then for all ''x'' in the domain of ''f'' and all integers ''n'', : ''f''(''x'' + ''nP'') = ''f''(''x''). If ''f''(''x'') is a function with period ''P'', then ''f''(''ax+b''), where ''a'' is a positive constant, is periodic with period ''P/a''. For example, ''f''(''x'')=sin''x'' has period 2π, therefore sin(5''x'') will have period 2π/5. ==Double-periodic functions== A function whose domain is the [[complex number]]s can have two incommensurate periods without being constant. The [[elliptic function]]s are such functions. ("Incommensurate" in this context means not real multiples of each other.) ==Complex example== Using [[complex analysis|complex variables]] we have the common period function: :<math>e^{kix} = \cos{kx} + i\sin{kx}</math> As you can see, since the cosine and sine functions are periodic, and the complex exponential above is made up of cosine/sine waves, then the above
