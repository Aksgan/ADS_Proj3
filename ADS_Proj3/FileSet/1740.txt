on the entire space is identically 1. ;[[Path (topology)|Path]]: A [[Path (topology)|path]] in a space ''X'' is a continuous map ''f'' from the closed unit [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] [0, 1] into ''X''. The point ''f''(0) is the initial point of ''f''; the point ''f''(1) is the terminal point of ''f''. ;[[Path-connected space|Path-connected]]: A space ''X'' is [[path-connected space|path-connected]] if, for every two points ''x'', ''y'' in ''X'', there is a path ''f'' from ''x'' to ''y'', i.e., a path with initial point ''f''(0) = ''x'' and terminal point ''f''(1) = ''y''. Every path-connected space is connected. ;Path-connected component: A path-connected component of a space is a maximal nonempty path-connected subspace. The set of path-connected components of a space is a [[partition of a set|partition]] of that space, which is [[partition of a set|finer]] than the partition into connected components. The set of path-connected components of a space ''X'' is denoted [[homotopy groups|π<sub>0</sub>(''X'')]]. ;π-base: A collection ''B'' of nonempty open sets is a π-base for a topology τ if every nonempty open set in τ includes a set from ''B''. ;Point: A point is an element of a topological space. More generally, a point is an element of any set with an underlying topological structure; e.g. an element of a metric space or a topological group is also a "point". ;Point of closure: See '''[[Closure (topology)|Closure]]'''. ;[[Polish space|Polish]]: A space is Polish if it is separable and topologically complete, i.e. if it is homeomorphic to a separable and complete metric space. ;P-point: A point of a topological space is a P-point if its filter of neighbourhoods is closed under countable intersections. ;Pre-compact: See '''[[Relatively compact]]'''. ;[[Product topology]]: If {''X''<sub>''i''</sub>} is a collection of spaces and ''X'' is the (set-theoretic) [[Cartesian product|product]] of {''X''<sub>''i''</sub>}, then the [[product topology]] on ''X'' is the coarsest topology for which all the projection maps are continuous. ;Proper function/mapping: A continuous function ''f'' from a space ''X'' to a space ''Y'' is proper if ''f''<sup>&minus;1</sup>(''C'') is a compact set in ''X'' for any compact subspace ''C'' of ''Y''. ;[[Proximity space]]: A proximity space (''X'', '''δ''') is a set ''X'' equipped with a [[binary relation]] '''δ''' between subsets of ''X'' satisfying the following properties: :For all subsets ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' of ''X'', :#''A'' '''δ''' ''B'' implies ''B'' '''δ''' ''A'' :#''A'' '''δ''' ''B'' implies ''A'' is non-empty :#If ''A'' and ''B'' have non-empty intersection, then ''A'' '''δ''' ''B'' :#''A'' '''δ''' (''B'' ∪ ''C'') [[iff]] (''A'' '''δ''' ''B'' or ''A'' '''δ''' ''C'') :#If, for all subsets ''E'' of ''X'', we have (''A'' '''δ''' ''E'' or ''B'' '''δ''' ''E''), then we must have ''A'' '''δ''' (''X'' &minus; ''B'') ;Pseudocompact: A space is pseudocompact if every [[real number|real-valued]] continuous function on the space is bounded. ;Pseudometric: See '''Pseudometric space'''. ;Pseudometric space: A pseudometric space (''M'', ''d'') is a set ''M'' equipped with a function ''d'' : ''M'' &times; ''M'' → [[real number|'''R''']] satisfying all the conditions of a metric space, except possibly the identity of indiscernibles. That is, points in a pseudometric space may be "infinitely close" without being identical. The function ''d'' is a '''pseudometric''' on ''M''. Every metric is a pseudometric. ;Punctured neighbourhood'''/'''Punctured neighborhood: A punctured neighbourhood of a point ''x'' is a neighbourhood of ''x'', minus {''x''}. For instance, the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] (&minus;1, 1) = {''y'' : &minus;1 < ''y'' < 1} is a neighbourhood of ''x'' = 0 in the [[real line]], so the set (&minus;1, 0) ∪ (0, 1) = (&minus;1, 1) &minus; {0} is a punctured neighbourhood of 0. == Q == ;Quasicompact: See '''[[compact space|compact]]'''. Some authors define "compact" to include the [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] separation axiom, and they use the term '''quasicompact''' to mean what we call in this glossary simply "compact" (without the Hausdorff axiom). This convention is most commonly found in French, and branches of mathematics heavily influenced by the French. ;Quotient map: If ''X'' and ''Y'' are spaces, and if ''f'' is a [[surjection]] from ''X'' to ''Y'', then ''f'' is a quotient map (or '''identification map''') if, for every subset ''U'' of ''Y'', ''U'' is open in ''Y'' [[if and only if]] ''f''<sup> <tt>-</tt>1</sup>(''U'') is open in ''X''. In other words, ''Y'' has the ''f''-strong topology. Equivalently, <math>f</math> is a quotient map if and only if it is the transfinite composition of maps <math>X\rightarrow X/Z</math>, where <math>Z\subset X</math> is a subset. Note that this doesn't imply that ''f'' is an open function. ;[[Quotient space]]: If ''X'' is a space, ''Y'' is a set, and ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is any [[surjection|surjective]] function, then the [[quotient space|quotient topology]] on ''Y'' induced by ''f'' is the finest topology for which ''f'' is continuous. The space ''X'' is a quotient space or '''identification space'''. By definition, ''f'' is a quotient map. The most common example of this is to consider an [[equivalence relation]] on ''X'', with ''Y'' the set of [[equivalence class]]es and ''f'' the natural projection map. This construction is dual to the construction of the subspace topology. == R == ; Refinement: A cover ''K'' is a [[refinement (topology)|refinement]] of a cover ''L'' if every member of ''K'' is a subset of some member of ''L''. ; [[Regular space|Regular]]: A space is [[regular space|regular]] if, whenever ''C'' is a closed set and ''x'' is a point not in ''C'', then ''C'' and ''x'' have [[disjoint]] neighbourhoods. ; [[T3 space|Regular Hausdorff]]: A space is [[T3 space|regular Hausdorff]] (or '''T<sub>3</sub>''') if it is a regular T<sub>0</sub> space. (A regular space is Hausdorff [[if and only if]] it is T<sub>0</sub>, so the terminology is consistent.) ; Regular open: An open subset ''U'' of a space ''X'' is regular open if it equals the interior of its closure. An example of a non-regular open set is the set ''U'' = (0, 1) U (1, 2) in '''R''' with its normal topology, since 1 is in the interior of the closure of ''U'', but not in ''U''. The regular open subsets of a space form a [[complete Boolean algebra]]. ; [[Relatively compact]]: A subset ''Y'' of
