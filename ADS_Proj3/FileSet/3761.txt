were unskilled, but were extremely lucky. On a retest of this subset, the unskilled will be unlikely to repeat their lucky break, while the skilled will have a second chance to have bad luck. Hence, those who did well previously are unlikely to do quite as well in the second test. The following is a second example of regression toward the mean. A class of students takes two editions of the same test on two successive days. It has frequently been observed that the worst performers on the first day will tend to improve their scores on the second day, and the best performers on the first day will tend to do worse on the second day. The phenomenon occurs because student scores are determined in part by underlying ability and in part by chance. For the first test, some will be lucky, and score more than their ability, and some will be unlucky and score less than their ability. Some of the lucky students on the first test will be lucky again on the second test, but more of them will have (for them) average or below average scores. Therefore a student who was lucky on the first test is more likely to have a worse score on the second test than a better score. Similarly, students who score less than the mean on the first test will tend to see their scores increase on the second test. ==History== The concept of regression comes from genetics and was popularized by [[Sir Francis Galton]] during the late 19th century with the publication of ''Regression towards mediocrity in hereditary stature''.<ref name="galton1886">{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2841583|journal=The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|url=http://jstor.org/stable/2841583|author=Galton, F.|title=Regression towards mediocrity in hereditary stature|year=1886|volume=15|pages=246–263|id={{JSTOR|2841583}}}}</ref> Galton observed that extreme characteristics (e.g., height) in parents are not passed on completely to their offspring. Rather, the characteristics in the offspring ''regress'' towards a ''mediocre'' point (a point which has since been identified as the mean). By measuring the heights of hundreds of people, he was able to quantify regression to the mean, and estimate the size of the effect. Galton wrote that, “the average regression of the offspring is a constant fraction of their respective mid-parental deviations”. This means that the difference between a child and its parents for some characteristic is proportional to its parents' deviation from typical people in the population. So if its parents are each two inches taller than the averages for men and women, on average it will be shorter than its parents by some factor (which, today, we would call one minus the [[Regression analysis|regression coefficient]]) times two inches. For height, Galton estimated this coefficient to be about 2/3: the height of an individual will measure around a mid-point that is two thirds of the parents’ deviation from the population average. Although Galton popularized the concept of regression, he fundamentally misunderstood the phenomenon; thus, his understanding of regression differs from that of modern statisticians as follows: Galton observed correctly that the characteristics of an individual are not determined completely by their parents; there must be another source. However, his explanation is that “A child inherits partly from his parents, partly from his ancestors. Speaking generally, the further his genealogy goes back, the more numerous and varied will his ancestry become, until they cease to differ from any equally numerous sample taken at haphazard from the race at large.”<ref name="galton1886"/> In other words, Galton saw regression toward the mean as simply an inheritance of characteristics from ancestors that are not expressed in the parents; he did not understand regression to the mean as a general statistical phenomenon. In contrast to this view, it is now known that regression towards the mean occurs in all [[bivariate normal distribution]]s. If there is any random variation between the height of an individual and parents — if the correlation is not exactly equal to one — then the predictions must regress to the mean regardless of the underlying mechanisms of inheritance, race or culture. Thus, Galton was attributing random variation in height to the ancestry of the individual. == Importance == Regression toward the mean is a significant consideration in the [[design of experiments]]. Take a hypothetical example of 1,000 individuals of a similar age who were examined and scored on the risk of experiencing a heart attack. Statistics could be used to measure the success of an intervention on the 50 who were rated at the greatest risk. The intervention could be a change in diet, exercise, or a drug treatment. Even if the interventions are worthless, the test group would be expected to show an improvement on their next physical exam, because of regression toward the mean. The best way to combat this effect is to divide the group randomly into a treatment group that receives the treatment, and a [[Scientific control|control]] group that does not. The treatment would then be judged effective only if the treatment group improves more than the control group. Alternately, a group of [[disadvantaged]] children could be tested to identify the ones with most college potential. The top 1% could be identified and supplied with special enrichment courses, tutoring, counseling and computers. Even if the program is effective, their average scores may well be less when the test is repeated a year later. However, in these circumstances it may be considered unfair to have a control group of disadvantaged children whose special needs are ignored. A mathematical calculation for [[Shrinkage (statistics)|shrinkage]] can adjust for this effect, although it will not be as reliable as the control group method (see also [[Stein's example]].) The effect can also be exploited for general inference and estimation. The hottest place in the country today is more likely to be cooler tomorrow than hotter. The best performing mutual fund over the last three years is more likely to see relative performance decline than improve over the next three years.
