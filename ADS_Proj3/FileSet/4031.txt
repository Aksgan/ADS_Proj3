ships, but is moving to its first purpose-built vessel as the third generation. The first, a German cargo ship built in 1958 by a shipyard in Bremen, was transformed in France into an electronic eavesdropping ship between 1976 and 1977. Decommissioned in May 1999, the next generation was a former supply ship used since 1988 by the Nuclear Experiments Department for the Pacific Tests Centre (CEP), the ''Bougainville'' . For its new mission, it was equipped with SIGINT sensors and a Syracuse II satellite communication system, and has been operating since July 1999. It carried out significant missions in the Indian Ocean following the 9/11/2001 attacks. On 14 January 2002, the French Ministry of Defense launched a new purpose-built "Intelligence Gathering Auxiliary" ship project called MINREM, and will be named the [[Dupuy de Lôme (A759)|Dupuy-de-Lôme]]. This vessel entered service in 2006, to replace ''Bougainville''<ref name=Duhamel2002>{{Citation | author = Alain Duhamel | coauthor = Michel Masselin, | journal = The French AOC's Newsletter | title = A New Sigint Vessel for France |date=November 2002 | url = http://guerrelec.asso.fr/Archives/lettre18UK.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate =2007-10-18 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071012012138/http://www.guerrelec.asso.fr/Archives/lettre18UK.pdf |archivedate = 2007-10-12}}</ref>. Thales is providing the electronics, and Compagnie Nationale de Navigation is building the ship, to requirements defined by the Military Intelligence Directorate (DRM). with a planned 30 year lifetime. Thales is assigning overall systems and COMINT to its Thales Communication division, while [[Thales]] Systèmes Aéroportés will do the ELINT. ===Germany: Ship Platforms=== The [[German Navy]] operates the [[Oste class fleet service ship]]s which are purpose built SIGINT and ELINT reconnaissance ships. Also other Navy vessels, such as the [[Bremen class frigate]]s, [[Brandenburg class frigate]]s, [[Sachsen class frigate]]s and [[Braunschweig class corvette]]s are equipped with extensive SIGINT/ELINT gear. ===Russia: Ship Platforms=== Before and after the breakup of the USSR, the Russian Navy operated a large number of AGI (Auxiliary General Intelligence) intelligence collection "trawlers"<ref name=ScherbakovFAPSI>{{citation | last = Shcherbakov | first = Aleksey | title = Major Loss of Intelligence Gathering Capability | date=March 22, 1999 | url = http://www.fas.org/irp/world/russia/fapsi/shcherbakov.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-08 }}</ref>. such as the [[Primor'ye class surveillance ship|Primor'ye class]] In 1980 the Soviets built a group of more sophisticated purpose built vessels, such as the [[Balzam class intelligence ship]]s and [[Vishnaya class intelligence ship]]s, which are operated by the Russian navy today. ===Spain: Ship Platforms=== Spain has been reported to have acquired an ex-East German AGI, which it may operate in cooperation with its SIGINT aircraft <ref name=SpainAGI>{{citation | last = HJH | title = Recycled AGI | journal = ENIGMA 2000 Newsletter | issue = Issue 27 |date=March 2005 | url = http://www.cvni.net/radio/e2k/e2k027/e2k27agi.html | accessdate = 2007-10-08 }}</ref>. The vessel concerned is the 1,900 ton renamed ''Alerta'', In East German service, she had extensive antennas and a large radome. Based in Cartagena, the SIGINT work is reportedly by two Israeli companies and a Spanish firm. A different source says that the SIGINT equipment is Russian. A Saturn 35 satellite antenna has been, according to Spanish sources, added. ===Sweden: Ship Platforms=== Sweden operates the [[HMS Orion (A201)]] and plans to rebuild the [[HMS Carlskrona (M04)]] as a SIGINT ship.<ref> {{Citation |url = http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/blogs/defense/index.jsp?plckController=Blog&plckScript=blogScript&plckElementId=blogDest&plckBlogPage=BlogViewPost&plckPostId=Blog%3a27ec4a53-dcc8-42d0-bd3a-01329aef79a7Post%3a9e4b4749-4eb2-4ca1-b9a5-6d64a3ca4358 |title=Sweden's Next Spy Ship |author=Joris Janssen Lok |publisher=Aviation Week |date=2007-11-20 |accessdate=2008-04-09}}</ref> ===United States: Ship Platforms=== After two international incidents, US doctrine is to conduct ship-based SIGINT missions with warships, which can protect themselves as the ''Pueblo'' and ''Liberty'' could not. The Gulf of Tonkin incident, in 1964, involved two-destroyer DESOTO patrols equipped with intercept vans, backed up with carrier air patrols. Why this level of protection was not available in 1967 is difficult to understand. One exception, the SIGINT auxiliary [[USS Sphinx (ARL-24)]], generally stayed off the Nicaraguan coast. Current USN warships carry some version of the AN/SLQ-32 electronic warfare system, which has ESM capabilities. In addition to the AN/SLQ-32, [[Arleigh Burke class destroyer]]s are in the process of evaluating an open-architecture Integrated Radar/Optical Sighting and Surveillance System (IROS3) and Ship Protection system, currently including an AN/SPS-73 radar, an electro-optical/infrared sensor, acoustic sensors and spotlights, coupled with remotely controlled machine guns.<ref name=NISR>{{citation | title = Navy ISR | work = Sea Power |date=January 2006 | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3738/is_200601/ai_n17169607/pg_1 | accessdate = 2007-10-08 }}</ref> Standardized USN systems go beyond simple direction finding and into COMINT. The AN/SLR-25 is a passive cryptologic exploitation system principally for tactical use, but that can make contributions to higher levels of intelligence. The SLR-25(V)1 Advanced Cryptologic Carry-on Exploitation System (ACCES) is a portable version of the SLR-25(V)2 SSEE (Ship Signal Exploitation Equipment) without dedicated SIGINT spaces. Coupled with an AN/SSQ-120 Transportable Radio Direction-Finding system, the ACCES provides a complete SIGINT collection system.<ref name=NISR /> The AN/SSQ-120 has HF, VHF, and UHF antennas and direction-finding logic <ref name=AN-SSQ-120>{{citation | title = Transportable Radio Direction Finding (TRDF) System (AN/SSQ-120) | work = Commerce Business Daily |date=March 22, 1999 | url = http://fbodaily.com/cbd/archive/1999/03(March)/22-Mar-1999/58sol001.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-08 }}</ref>. More capable than the AN/SLR-25 with AN/SSQ-120 is the AN/SSQ-137 Ship Signal Exploitation System, an open-architecture system for command & control as well as intelligence. ==Submarine Platforms== Submarines are the original stealth platforms. When no more than a mast breaks the surface, they immediately become radar targets, so virtually all modern submarines will have the minimum ELINT of a radar warning receiver. Far beyond that, however, many submarines will penetrate hostile areas, raise SIGINT receiver masts, usually with some type of radar-observant covering, and listen. Especially sophisticated SIGINT submarines may tap undersea cables. The minimum radar-warning receiver is usually a set of spiral antennas, backed with resonant cavities, whose amplitude can be compared to determine the direction of greatest signal strength. To go to the next level of sophistication, phase is considered as well as amplitude, and [[interferometry]] adds further information.<ref name=Friedman2003>{{citation | last = Friedman | first = Norman | title = Up Periscope, Up Antenna: Hunter-Killer Submarines increasingly are Hunter-Gatherers of Intelligence | work = Journal of Electronic Defense | publisher = Harpoon Waypoint | url = http://www.harpoonhq.com/waypoint/articles/Article_042.pdf |format=PDF| id = Friedman2003 | accessdate = 2007-10-08}}</ref>. ===Australia:
