He argued that the "hip and free encyclopedia"'s policy on articles not needing to adhere to a [[NPOV|neutral point of view]] (as Wikipedia does) was not conducive to an unbiased encyclopedia. With WikiPilipinas being marketed as an encyclopedia "by Filipinos, for Filipinos," Villar pointed out the great possibility of bias in the encyclopedia's articles. Aside from the possibility of bias, he also mentioned that the articles of WikiPilipinas were less likely to [[pagerank|rank]] higher than those of the [[English Wikipedia]] in [[Internet search engine|Internet searches]], making effort spent in updating WikiPilipinas articles better spent working on their equivalent Wikipedia articles.<ref name="Vaes20070719">{{cite web | last =Villar| first =Eugene Alvin| authorlink =Eugene Alvin Villar | title ="There is Currently No Point to Wikipiniana (aka WikiPilipinas)"| work =Vaes9 | publisher = | date =2007-07-19 | url =http://vaes9.codedgraphic.com/posts/no_point_to_wikipiniana | accessdate = 2007-08-27 }}</ref> He later reiterated some of these concerns in an interview with the [[Manila Bulletin]] in September.
