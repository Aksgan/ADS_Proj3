programming interface]] (API) for consumer electronics appliances, created by the [[UHAPI Forum]]. The objective of UHAPI is to enable standard [[middleware]] to run on audio/video streaming platforms via a hardware-independent industry standard API. UHAPI is complementary to most operating systems just as [[VxWorks]], [[pSOS]], [[eCos]] and [[Linux]]. UHAPI is currently being proposed as Audio/Video Streaming API in the CE Linux Forum ([[CELF]]) [http://www.celinuxforum.org]. The UHAPI Forum was established in November 2004 by [[Samsung]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Philips]], [[Access Co.|Access Co. Ltd.]] and the Digital TV Industry Alliance of China ([[DTVIA]]). It released the UHAPI 1.0 spec in January 2005, targeting Analogue TV, Digital TV and Set Top Box applications. In January 2006, the UHAPI 1.1 specification was released, which added - among others - PVR functionality. Currently, work is in progress to define APIs to support Digital Media Adaptors. ==External links== *[http://sourceforge.net/projects/uhapi4linux An open-source implementation of UHAPI] at [[SourceForge]] [[Category:Application programming interfaces]] [[Category:Home automation]]</text> </page> <page> <id>38905</id> <title>Universal Interface Language</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=February 2009}} A '''Universal Interface Language''' is a language that allows for an interchange of deep information between [[Object (computer science)|objects]]. It does this by allowing an object to experiment on another object to determine what it thinks the object is capable of. The concept was introduced by [[Alan Kay]] as early as 1997 in his keynote speech at [[OOPSLA]]. The goal of a Universal Interface Language is to achieve (automatic) interoperability beyond that provided by an [[Interface description language]] such as [[CORBA]] or a message exchange protocol such as [[Simple Object Access Protocol|SOAP]]. There are currently no known implementations of a Universal Interface Language. Based on [[Alan Kay|Kay]]'s description, we would expect each object involved in the conversation to have a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] or [[IP address]]. ==References== *[[Alan Kay]]: [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2950949730059754521 ''The Computer Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet''] (Keynote OOPSLA 1997) [[Category:Software components]]</text> </page> <page> <id>38906</id> <title>Universal Networking Language</title> <text>'''Universal Networking Language''' ('''UNL''') is an artificial language that can be used as a [[pivot language]] in [[interlingual machine translation]] systems or as a [[knowledge representation]] language in [[information retrieval]] applications. It was created at the Institute of Advanced Studies of the [[United Nations University]], in Tokyo, and it has been developed at the [http://www.undlfoundation.org UNDL Foundation], in Geneva, Switzerland, along with a large community of researchers all over the world (the so-called UNL Society). == History == The UNL Programme started in 1996, as an initiative of the [http://www.ias.unu.edu Institute of Advanced Studies] of the [http://www.unu.edu United Nations University] in Tokyo, Japan. In January 2001, the United Nations University set up an autonomous organization, the [http://www.undlfoundation.org UNDL Foundation], to be responsible for the development and management of the UNL Programme. The Foundation, a non-profit international organisation, has an independent identity from the United Nations University, although it has special links with the UN. It inherited from the UNU/IAS the mandate of implementing the UNL Programme so that it can fulfil its mission. Its headquarters are based in Geneva, Switzerland. From the very beginning, a consortium of university departments from all regions of the world has been engaged in developing the UNL. That's the UNL Society, a global-scale network of R&D teams, involving about 200 specialists in computer science and linguistics, who are at work creating the linguistic resources and developing the web structure of the UNL System. The UNL Centre provides technological support and co-ordinates the implementation of the Programme. The Programme has already crossed important milestones. The overall architecture of the UNL System has been developed with a set of basic software and tools necessary for its functioning. These are being tested and improved. A vast amount of linguistic resources from the various native languages already under development, as well as from the UNL expression, has been accumulated in the last few years. Moreover, the technical infrastructure for expanding these resources is already in place, thus facilitating the participation of many more languages in the UNL system from now on. A growing number of scientific papers and academic dissertations on the UNL are being published every year. The most visible accomplishment so far is the recognition by the Patent Co-operation Treaty (PCT) of the innovative character and industrial applicability of the UNL, which was obtained in May 2002 through the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO). Acquiring the patent for the UNL is a completely novel achievement within the United Nations. == Scope and Goals == The UNL is an effort to achieve a simple basis for representing the most central aspects of information and meaning in a machine- and human-language-independent form. As a language-independent formalism, the UNL aims at coding, storing, disseminating and retrieving information independently of the original language in which it was expressed. In this sense, UNL seeks to provide the tools for overcoming the language barrier in a systematic way. At first glance, the UNL seems to be a multilingual machine translation system, i.e., a kind of Interlingua, to which the source texts are converted before being translated into the target languages. It can, in fact, be used for such a purpose, and very efficiently too. However, its real strength is to represent knowledge and its primary objective is to serve as an infrastructure for handling knowledge that already exists or can exist in any given language. Nevertheless, it is important to note that at this point in time it would be foolish to state it possible to represent the “full” meaning of any word, sentence or text for any language. Subtleties of intention and interpretation make the “full meaning”, whatever concept we might have of it, too variable and subjective for any systematic treatment. The UNL avoids the pitfalls of trying to represent the “full meaning” of sentences or texts, targeting instead the “core” or “consensual” meaning that is most often attributed to them. In this sense, much of the subtlety of poetry, metaphor, figurative language, innuendo and other complex, indirect communicative behaviors is beyond the current scope and goals of the UNL. Instead, the UNL targets direct communicative behavior and literal meanings as a tangible, concrete
