A new C$880 million, 72,000 sq. m. facility will be built in SE Ottawa with construction expected to begin in early 2011 and completed in 2015.<ref>Defence Industry Daily, DID » Logistics & Support » Bases & Infrastructure » Canada’s CSE SIGINT Agency Building New Facilities, 10 jun 2009</ref> ===Communications data=== In Proceedings of the Canadian Senate Standing Committee on National Security and Defence|Standing Senate Committee on National Security and Defence, CSE Chief John Adams, indicated that the CSE is collecting [[communications data]] when he suggested that the legislation was not perfect in regard to interception of information relating to the "envelope".<ref>[http://www.parl.gc.ca/39/1/parlbus/commbus/senate/Com-e/defe-e/15evb-e.htm?Language=E&Parl=39&Ses=1&comm_id=76 Issue 15 - Evidence] ''Proceedings of the Standing Senate Committee on National Security and Defence'' April 30, 2007</ref> ==ECHELON== Under the 1948 [[UKUSA]] agreement, CSEC's intelligence is shared with the [[United States]] [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ), the [[Australia]]n [[Defence Signals Directorate]] (DSD) and [[New Zealand|New Zealand's]] [[Government Communications Security Bureau]] (GCSB). Along with these services from the United States, the UK, New Zealand and Australia, CSEC is believed to form the [[ECHELON]] system. Its capabilities are suspected to include the ability to monitor a large proportion of the world's transmitted civilian telephone, fax and data traffic. The intercepted data, or "dictionaries" are "reported linked together through a high-powered array of computers known as ‘Platform’.<ref>Rudner, Martin. (2007). "Canada's Communications Security Establishment, Signals Intelligence and Counter-Terrorism". Intelligence and National Security: 22(4) pp. 473-490</ref> ==Controversies== There has been some criticism over the years of CSEC. A former employee of the organization, Mike Frost, claimed in a 1994 book, ''Spyworld'', that the agency eavesdropped on [[Margaret Trudeau]] to find out if she smoked [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and that CSEC monitored two of former British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher's]] dissenting cabinet ministers in London on behalf of the UK's secret service.<ref>Morris, Nomi (1996).

"Somalia cover-up: A commissioner's journal", 1997</ref> In 2006, [[CFCF-TV|CTV Montreal]]’s program ''On Your Side'' conducted a three-part documentary on CSEC naming it “Canada’s most secretive spy agency” and that “this ultra-secret agency has now become very powerful”, conducting unlawful surveillance by monitoring phone calls, e-mails, chat groups, radio, microwave, and satellite.<ref>http://montreal.ctv.ca/cfcf/news/oys&id=1367</ref> In 2007, former Ontario lieutenant-governor, [[James Bartleman]], testified at the Air India Inquiry on May 3 that he saw a CSEC communications intercept warning of the June 22, 1985 bombing of [[Air India Flight 182]] before it occurred. Two former CSEC employees, Bill Sheahan (CSEC Client Relations Officer) and Pierre LaCompte (CSEC Liaison Officer), have since testified that no CSEC report was ever produced.<ref>http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/05/03/bartleman-airindia.html</ref> ==See also== * [[CFS Leitrim]] *[[Canadian Forces]] Information Management Group * [[ECHELON]] * [[Joint Task Force 2]] * [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] (CSIS) * [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) * [[RCMP Security Service]] * [[Security_clearance#Canada|Security clearances]] * [[Security of Information Act]] * [[Treasury Board]] * [[Badge of the Communications Security Establishment]] * [[Cray]] * [[List of intelligence agencies]] * [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.cse-cst.gc.ca/ Communications Security Establishment Canada - Official Website] * [http://www.ocsec-bccst.gc.ca/index_e.php/ Official website of the CSE Commissioner] * [http://luxexumbra.blogspot.com/ Lux ex Umbra - a blog about the CSE] * http://www.img.forces.gc.ca/index-eng.asp - Canadian Forces Information Management Group * http://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/prg/em/ccirc/index-eng.aspx - Canadian Cyber Incident Response Centre * [http://www2.parl.gc.ca/content/lop/researchpublications/bp343-e.htm The Communications Security Establishment - Canada's Most Secret Intelligence Agency] {{Coord|45.375|-75.687|type:landmark_region:CA|display=title}} * [http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/ CSIS Official Web Site] {{Template group |list = {{Can Intel}} {{Signals intelligence agencies}} {{Government Departments of Canada}} }} [[Category:Department of National Defence (Canada)]] [[Category:Canadian federal departments and agencies]] [[Category:Organizations in cryptography|Canada]] [[Category:Canadian intelligence agencies]] [[Category:Government agencies established in 1946]] [[Category:Signals intelligence agencies|Canada]] [[br:CSE]] [[cs:CSE]] [[da:CSE]] [[de:Communications Security Establishment]] [[et:CSE]] [[el:CSE]] [[fr:Communications Security Establishment]] [[gl:Communications Security Establishment]] [[hr:Communications Security Establishment]] [[id:Communications Security Establishment]] [[it:Communications Security Establishment]] [[nl:Communications Security Establishment]] [[no:Centre de la sécurité des télécommunications]] [[pl:Communications Security Establishment]] [[pt:CSE]] [[ro:Communications Security Establishment]] [[simple:Communications Security Establishment]] [[sk:Communications Security Establishment]] [[fi:CSE]] [[sv:Communications Security Establishment]] [[tr:Communications Security Establishment]] [[yi:CSE]]</text> </page> <page> <id>7078</id> <title>Community Education Computer Society</title> <text>'''Community Education Computer Society''' ('''CECS''') describes itself as a [[South Africa]]n non-governmental organisation dedicated to a non-sexist, non-racist, democratic society. It has been involved in training other NGOs and CBOs (community-based organisations), as well as individual members of the disadvantaged community. CECS [http://cecs.org.za/] sees itself as "the oldest national computer training NGO, established in April 1985, for the technological empowerment of the historically disadvantaged" in South Africa. Its roots are traced to "a group of progressive teachers faced with computers the government had provided for schools." According to CECS, this group began investigating the possibilities of using their computers to design media and lessons at schools. CECS was launched at a meeting of some 250 primary and high school teachers in April 1985. CECS has been active, in the past, in five regions in South Africa, covering all the major centres. <!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Computer_ed.jpg]] --> ==External links== *[http://cecs.org.za/ CECS website] *[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Org_Institutes/Community_Education_17613.html 1994 post from CECS] *[http://cecs.org.za/activities/course_details.html CECS courses on information literacy, setting up a computer network, office XP, the internet and email, and International Computers Drivers License (ICDL)] {{nongov-org-stub}} [[Category:Organizations established in 1985]] [[Category:Non-profit organisations based in South Africa]] [[Category:Information technology organisations]] [[Category:Educational organizations]] [[Category:Information technology education]]</text> </page> <page> <id>7087</id> <title>Communote</title> <text>'''Communote''' is a [[microblogging]] tool and service launched in December 2008.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-06-17|url=http://www.communote.com/blog/2008/12/07/communote-launches-beta-test/|title= Communote launches Beta-test |publisher=Communote}}</ref> Like [[Twitter]], it allows users to post updates of their activities.
