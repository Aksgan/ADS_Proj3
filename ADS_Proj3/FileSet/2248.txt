The term "Intrinsic cognitive load" was first described by [http://www.leaonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s1532690xci0804_2 Chandler and Sweller (1991)]. According to Chandler and Sweller, all instruction has an inherent difficulty associated with it (e.g., the calculation of 2 + 2, versus solving a differential equation ). This inherent difficulty may not be altered by an instructor. However, instructional material can be redesigned so complex cognitive tasks (large complex schemas) are broken into individual "subschemas" that can be taught in isolation. Instructional designers can then develop later lessons that bring that material back together to describe it as a combined whole ([http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/113395136/ABSTRACT?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0 Clark, Nguyen, and Sweller, 2006]). ==See also== * [[Cognitive load]] * [[Extraneous cognitive load]] * [[Germane cognitive load]] ==References== * {{cite journal| author=Chandler, P. & Sweller, J.| year=1991| title= Cognitive Load Theory and the Format of Instruction| journal= Cognition and Instruction| volume=8| issue=4| pages=293–332| doi= 10.1207/s1532690xci0804_2}} * {{cite book| author=Clark, R., Nguyen, F., and Sweller, J.| year=2006| title=Efficiency in Learning: Evidence-Based Guidelines to Manage Cognitive Load| location=San Francisco | publisher=Pfeiffer| isbn=0-7879-7728-4}} [[Category:Pedagogy]] [[Category:Educational psychology]] [[Category:Educational technology]] [[Category:Learning]]</text> </page> <page> <id>19237</id> <title>Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation</title> <text>{{Infobox Book | name = Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation | title_orig = | translator = | image = [[File:Hopcroft-ullman-79-cover.jpg|thumb]] | image_caption= Cover of the Cinderella Book (1979 edition) | author = [[John Hopcroft]] and [[Jeffrey Ullman]] | illustrator = | cover_artist = | country = USA | language = [[English language|English]] | series = | subject = [[Computer science]] | publisher = [[Addison-Wesley]] | pub_date = 1979 | media_type = Print | pages = | isbn = ISBN 020102988X | dewey= 629.8/312 | congress= QA267 .H56 | oclc = 4549363| followed_by = }} '''''Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation''''', among experts also known as the '''''Cinderella Book''''', is an influential [[computer science]] textbook by [[John Hopcroft]] and [[Jeffrey Ullman]] on [[formal language]]s and the [[theory of computation]]. The forerunner of this book appeared under the title '''''Formal Languages and their Relation to Automata''''' in 1968. Forming a basis both for the creation of courses on the topic, as well as for further research, that book shaped the field of [[automata theory]] for over a decade, cf. (Hopcroft 1989). The nickname "Cinderella book" is derived from a girl (putatively [[Cinderella]]) on the cover with a [[Rube Goldberg machine]]. == Edition History and Reception == *{{cite book | last1 = Hopcroft | first1 = John E. | last2 = Ullman | first2 = Jeffrey D. | title = Formal Languages and their Relation to Automata | publisher = Addison-Wesley | date = 1968 }} *{{cite book | last1 = Hopcroft | first1 = John E. | last2 = Ullman | first2 = Jeffrey D. | title = Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation | publisher = Addison-Wesley | edition = 1st | date = 1979 }} *{{cite book | last1 = Hopcroft | first1 = John E. | last2 = Motwani | first2 = Rajeev | last3 = Ullman | first3 = Jeffrey D. | title = Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation | publisher = Addison-Wesley | date = 2000 | edition = 2nd }} *{{cite book | last1 = Hopcroft | first1 = John E. | last2 = Motwani | first2 = Rajeev | last3 = Ullman | first3 = Jeffrey D. | title = Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation | publisher = Addison-Wesley | date = 2006 | edition = 3rd }} [[File:Hopcroft-ullman-old.jpg|thumb|left|''Formal Languages and their Relation to Automata'' appeared in 1968, with an inornate cover.]] The first edition of ''Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation'' was published in 1979, the second edition in November 2000, and the third edition appeared in February 2006. Since the second edition, [[Rajeev Motwani]] has joined Hopcroft and Ullman as third author. Starting with the second edition, the book features extended coverage of examples where [[automata theory]] is applied, whereas large parts of more advanced theory were taken out. While this makes the second and third editions more accessible to beginners, it makes it less suited for more advanced courses. The new bias away from theory is not seen positive by all: As [[Jeffrey Shallit|Shallit]] quotes one professor, "they have removed all good parts." (Shallit 2008). The first edition in turn constituted a major revision of a previous textbook also written by Hopcroft and Ullman, entitled ''Formal Languages and their Relation to Automata''. It was published in 1968 and is referred to in the introduction of the 1979 edition. In a personal historical note regarding the 1968 book, Hopcroft states: "Perhaps the success of the book came from our efforts to present the essence of each proof before actually giving the proof" (Hopcroft 1989). Compared with the forerunner book, the 1979 edition was expanded, and the material was reworked to make it more accessible to students, cf. (Hopcroft 1989). This gearing towards understandability at the price of succinctness was not seen positive by all. As Hopcroft reports on feedback to the overhauled 1979 edition: "It seems that our attempts to lower the level of our presentation
