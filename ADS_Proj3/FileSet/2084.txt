the [[circular flow]] equal "injections"). The [[multiplier effect]] of an increase in fixed investment resulting from a lower interest rate raises real GDP. This explains the downward slope of the '''IS''' curve. In summary, this line represents the causation from falling interest rates to rising planned fixed investment (etc.) to rising national income and output. The '''IS''' curve is defined by the equation :<math>Y = C \left({Y}-{T(Y)}\right) + I \left({r}\right) + G + NX(Y),</math> where Y represents income, <math>C(Y-T(Y))</math> represents consumer spending as an increasing function of disposable income (income, Y, minus taxes, T(Y), which themselves depend positively on income), I(r) represents investment as a decreasing function of the real interest rate, G represents government spending, and NX(Y) represents net exports (exports minus imports) as a decreasing function of income (decreasing because imports are an increasing function of income). In this equation, the level of G (government spending) is presumed to be [[exogenous]], meaning that it is taken as a given. ===LM curve=== For the LM curve, the independent variable is income and the dependent variable is the interest rate. The LM curve shows the combinations of interest rates and levels of real income for which the money market is in equilibrium. It is an upward-sloping curve representing the role of finance and money. The initials '''LM''' stand for "'''L'''iquidity preference and '''M'''oney supply equilibrium". As such, the LM function is the set of equilibrium points between the [[liquidity preference]] or Demand for Money function and the [[money supply]] function (as determined by [[bank]]s and [[central bank]]s). Each point on the LM curve reflects a particular equilibrium situation in the money market equilibrium diagram, based on a particular level of income. In the money market equilibrium diagram, the [[liquidity preference]] function is simply the willingness to hold cash balances instead of [[securities]]. For this function, the nominal interest rate (on the vertical axis) is plotted against the quantity of cash balances (or liquidity), on the horizontal. The liquidity preference function is downward sloping. Two basic elements determine the quantity of cash balances demanded (liquidity preference)and therefore the position and slope of the function: * 1) Transactions demand for money: this includes both (a) the willingness to hold cash for everyday transactions and (b) a precautionary measure (money demand in case of emergencies). Transactions demand is positively related to real GDP (represented by Y,and also referred to as income). This is simply explained - as GDP increases, so does spending and therefore transactions. As GDP is considered exogenous to the liquidity preference function, changes in GDP shift the curve. For example, an increase in GDP will, [[ceteris paribus]] (all else equal), move the entire liquidity preference function rightward in response to the GDP increase. * 2) Speculative demand for money: this is the willingness to hold cash instead of securities as an asset for investment purposes. Speculative demand is inversely related to the interest rate. As the interest rate rises, the [[opportunity cost]] of holding cash increases - the incentive will be to move into securities. The money supply function for this situation is plotted on the same graph as the liquidity preference function. The money supply is determined by the central bank decisions and willingness of commercial banks to loan money. Though the money supply is related indirectly to interest rates in the very [[short run]], the money supply in effect is perfectly inelastic with respect to nominal interest rates (assuming the central bank chooses to control the money supply rather than focusing directly on the interest rate). Thus the money supply function is represented as a vertical line - money supply is a constant, independent of the interest rate, GDP, and other factors. Mathematically, the '''LM''' curve is defined by the equation <math>M/P=L(i,Y)</math>, where the supply of money is represented as the [[Real versus nominal value|real]] amount M/P (as opposed to the nominal amount M), with P representing the [[price level]], and L being the real demand for money, which is some function of the interest rate i and the level Y of real income. The LM curve shows the combinations of interest rates and levels of real income for which money supply equals money demandâ€”that is, for which the money market is in equilibrium. For a given level of income, the intersection point between the liquidity preference and money supply functions implies a single point on the LM curve: specifically, the point giving the level of the interest rate which equilibrates the money market at the given level of income. Recalling that for the LM curve, the interest rate is plotted against real GDP (whereas the liquidity preference and money supply functions plot interest rates against the quantity of cash balances), an increase in GDP shifts the liquidity preference function rightward and hence raises the interest rate. Thus the LM function is positively sloped. ==Shifts== One hypothesis is that a government's [[deficit spending]] ("[[fiscal policy]]") has an effect similar to that of a lower saving rate or increased private fixed investment, increasing the amount of demand for goods at each individual interest rate. An increased deficit by the national government shifts the '''IS''' curve to the right. This raises the equilibrium interest rate (from '''i<sub>1</sub>''' to '''i<sub>2</sub>''') and national income (from '''Y<sub>1</sub>''' to '''Y<sub>2</sub>'''), as shown in the graph above. The equilibrium level of national income in the IS-LM diagram is referred to as [[aggregate demand]]. Thus the graph indicates one of the major criticisms of [[deficit spending]] as a way to stimulate the economy: rising interest rates lead to [[crowding out (economics)|crowding out]] &ndash; i.e., discouragement &ndash; of private fixed investment, which in turn may hurt long-term growth of the supply side ([[potential output]]). Keynesians respond that deficit spending may actually "crowd in" (encourage) private fixed investment via the [[accelerator effect]], which helps long-term growth. Further, if government deficits are spent on productive public investment (e.g., infrastructure or public health) that directly and eventually raises potential output, although not necessarily as much as the lost private investment
