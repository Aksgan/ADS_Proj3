by the [[utility function]] is optimized given perceived opportunities. That is, the individual seeks to attain very specific and predetermined goals to the greatest extent with the least possible cost. Note that this kind of "rationality" does not say that the individual's actual goals are "rational" in some larger ethical, social, or human sense, only that he tries to attain them at minimal cost. Only naïve applications of the ''Homo economicus'' model assume that this hypothetical individual knows what is best for his long-term physical and mental health and can be relied upon to always make the right decision for himself. See [[rational choice theory]] and [[rational expectations]] for further discussion; the article on [[rationality]] widens the discussion. As in social science in general, these assumptions are at best approximations. The term is often used derogatorily in academic literature, perhaps most commonly by [[sociology|sociologists]], many of whom tend to prefer structural explanations to ones based on rational action by individuals. The use of the Latin form ''Homo economicus'' is certainly long established; Persky<ref name=persky/> traces it back to [[Vilfredo Pareto|Pareto]] (1906)<ref>Pareto, Vilfredo (1906). "Manual of political economy".</ref> but notes that it may be older. The English term ''economic man'' can be found even earlier, in [[John Kells Ingram]]'s ''A History of Political Economy'' (1888).<ref>Zabieglik, Stefan (2002). "The Origins of the Term ''Homo Oeconomicus''", Gdansk, 123-130.</ref> The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]] (O.E.D.)'' does not mention ''Homo economicus,'' but it is one of a number of phrases that imitate the scientific name for the human species. According to the ''O.E.D.,'' the human genus name ''Homo'' is {{quote|Used with [[Latin|L.]] or mock-L. adjs. in names imitating ''Homo sapiens,'' ''etc.,'' and intended to personify some aspect of human life or behaviour (indicated by the adj.). ''Homo faber'' ("feIb@(r)) [H. Bergson L'Evolution Créatrice (1907) ii. 151], a term used to designate man as a maker of tools.) Variants are often comic: ''Homo insipiens;'' ''Homo turisticus.''<ref>This is from the CD edition of 2002.</ref>}} Note that such forms should logically keep the capital for the "genus" name&mdash;''i.e.,'' ''<u>H</u>omo economicus'' rather than ''<u>h</u>omo economicus.'' Actual usage is inconsistent. [[Amartya Sen]] has argued there are grave pitfalls in assuming that rationality is limited to selfish rationality. Economics should build into its assumptions the notion that people can give credible commitments to a course of conduct. He demonstrates the absurdity with the narrowness of the assumptions by some economists with the following example of two strangers meeting on a street.<ref>AK Sen, ‘Rational Fools: A Critique of the Behavioural Foundations of Economic Theory’ (1977) 6 Philosophy and Public Affairs 317, 332</ref> {{Cquote|"Where is the railway station?" he asks me. "There," I say, pointing at the post office, "and would you please post this letter for me on the way?" "Yes," he says, determined to open the envelope and check whether it contains something valuable.}} == Criticisms == ''Homo economicus'' bases his choices on a consideration of his own personal "utility function". Consequently, the "homo economicus" assumptions have been criticized not only by economists on the basis of logical arguments, but also on empirical grounds by cross-cultural comparison. Economic anthropologists such as [[Marshall Sahlins]],<ref>Marshall Sahlins: ''[http://www.eco-action.org/dt/affluent.html The Original Affluent Society],'' in: Marshall Sahlins (1972''): Stone Age Economics.'' London: Routledge 2003</ref> [[Karl Polanyi]],<ref>Karl Polanyi (1944): ''[[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]].'' Beacon Press 2001</ref> [[Marcel Mauss]]<ref>Marcel Mauss (1924): ''[[The Gift (book)|The Gift]]. The Form and Reason for Exchange in Archaic Societies.'' London: Routledge 2006</ref> or [[Maurice Godelier]]<ref>Maurice Godelier: ''The Enigma of the Gift.'' University Of Chicago Press 1999</ref> have demonstrated that in traditional societies, choices people make regarding production and exchange of goods follow patterns of [[reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] which differ sharply from what the "homo economicus" model postulates. Such systems have been termed [[gift economy]] rather than market economy. Criticisms of the "homo economicus" model put forward from the standpoint of ethics usually refer to thís traditional ethic of kinship-based reciprocity that held together traditional societies. Economists [[Thorstein Veblen]], [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[Herbert Simon]], and many of the [[Austrian School]] criticise ''Homo economicus'' as an actor with too great of an understanding of macroeconomics and economic forecasting in his decision making. They stress [[uncertainty]] and [[bounded rationality]] in the making of economic decisions, rather than relying on the rational man who is fully informed of all circumstances impinging on his decisions. They argue that perfect knowledge never exists, which means that all economic activity implies risk. Empirical studies by [[Amos Tversky]] questioned the assumption that investors are rational. In 1995, Tversky demonstrated the tendency of investors to make risk-averse choices in gains, and risk-seeking choices in losses. The investors appeared as very risk-averse for small losses but indifferent for a small chance of a very large loss. This violates economic rationality as usually understood. Further research on this subject, showing other deviations from conventionally-defined economic rationality, is being done in the growing field of experimental or [[behavioral economics]]. Some of the broader issues involved in this criticism are studied in [[Decision Theory]] of which [[Rational Choice Theory]] is only a subset. Other critics of the ''Homo economicus'' model of humanity, such as [[Bruno Frey]], point to the excessive emphasis on [[extrinsic motivation]] (rewards and punishments from the social environment) as opposed to [[intrinsic motivation]]. For example, it is difficult if not impossible to understand how ''Homo economicus'' would be a hero in war or would get inherent pleasure from [[artisan|craftsmanship]]. Frey and others argue that too much emphasis on rewards and punishments can "crowd out" (discourage) intrinsic motivation: paying a boy for doing household tasks may push him from doing those tasks "to help the family" to doing them simply for the reward. Another weakness is highlighted by sociologists, who argue that ''Homo economicus'' ignores an extremely important question, ''i.e.,'' the origins of tastes and the parameters of the utility function by social influences, training, education, and the like. The exogeneity of tastes (preferences) in this model is the major distinction from ''Homo sociologicus,'' in which tastes are taken as partially or even
