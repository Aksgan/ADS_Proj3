the happy-go-lucky technology buff with vast mechanical and programming skills, as is evident with his construction of Eve and his [[Artificial powered exoskeleton|power suit]]. He is also an "Apple geek." He has the Apple logo tattooed on his right buttock<ref>http://www.applegeeks.com/comic_archive/viewcomic.php?issue=81</ref> and a barcode on his left arm, and has to be confined inside a large, plastic ball whenever he goes into an Apple store. Hawk's interests lie primarily with Apple related gear, but he likes girls as well, although he is a little unsure on how to approach them. His first appearance was in [http://www.applegeeks.com/comic_archive/viewcomic.php?issue=1 comic #1]. After having disappeared in [http://www.applegeeks.com/comic_archive/viewcomic.php?issue=300 comic #300], Hawk reappeared in the Exodus saga with Eve. *'''Jayce Wilder''' is the secondary protagonist and was once shown as general goofball, although compared to Hawk, Jayce's occasional boyish antics seem normal. He has occasionally revealed a personal dark side, which Gina has noticed. He clearly has a strong sense of leadership and can often be the most logical member of the group when the situation requires. He is an avid writer, and has a tendency to get nostalgic from time to time. He has been dating Alice Fox, his childhood friend. His first appearance was in [http://www.applegeeks.com/comic_archive/viewcomic.php?issue=1 comic #1]. *'''Alice Fox''' is the primary female cast member; often the voice of reason. She has been dating Jayce Wilder, having finally moved past the "close friend" stage after several years. Her first appearance was in [http://www.applegeeks.com/comic_archive/viewcomic.php?issue=10 comic #10]. She is clearly the most caring in the group, though she has often shown to be very strong willed when pushed. For a time she and Hawk were at odds in relation to his treatment of Eve, but they have since then grown closer than before. *'''Gina McQuarrie''' is a female model, strongly independent individual, and known for lack of academic motivation. Alice's best friend. Sometimes has an Irish accent. She also has a bad habit of smoking. Her first appearance was in [http://www.applegeeks.com/comic_archive/viewcomic.php?issue=25 comic #25]. Following the group's trip to Tokyo and the disappearance of Hawk and Eve, Gina took a trip of self-discovery and possible self-destruction where she would compete in fighting tournaments which her parents had once been considered champions of. She has a strong bond and kind of a "free" friendship with Hawk - she helped him save Eve at both occasions, sometimes they both appear naked together and she let Hawk grab her breasts after getting back from her trip. *'''Eve''' is a [[gynoid]] built with Apple aesthetic design sensibilities in mind. She has an extreme hatred for [[IBM PC compatible|PC]]s — although considering that Hawk constructed her, this is not a surprising trait — and incredible physical strength. Recently, she has been kidnapped after being shut down by Hawk and then subsequently rescued. She is conceptualized in [http://www.applegeeks.com/comic_archive/viewcomic.php?issue=138 comic #138]. After having disappeared in [http://www.applegeeks.com/comic_archive/viewcomic.php?issue=300 comic #300], Eve reappeared in the Exodus saga with Hawk in Japan. *'''Mr. Squirrely''' is a squirrel with mysterious powers and the ability to communicate with Hawk. Possibly a delusion brought on by Hawk's Ramadan fasting, though there are issues that conflict with this idea. *'''Frost''' is a supporting cast member who makes the odd appearance and was often the voice of reason when Alice wasn't around. Early on, he disappeared from the comics. He returned in issue 227, however, and may have been responsible for a rash of shotgun-game related murders (however, as the idea of this was Hawk's and Jayce claimed there had not been any strange deaths in the area recently, it is possible that this was simply a gag). Frost then proceeded to steal Eve in [http://www.applegeeks.com/comics/viewcomic.php?issue=250 issue 250].Though he did this under the orders of Jayce's father, he appeared also motivated by jealousy of Hawk's inventive skills. His first appearance was in [http://www.applegeeks.com/comic_archive/viewcomic.php?issue=2 comic #2]. *'''Naku''' was originally a member of ''Applegeeks'', but Naku's real-life inspiration went on to other projects. As such, her character was retired. She was a "tech geek" and attractive gamer girl during her tenure in the comic. *'''Josie''' is a supporting cast member of ''Applegeeks'', and much to his friends' surprise has a budding romantic relationship with Hawk (even Satan feels the effects).<ref>http://applegeeks.com/comic_archive/viewcomic.php?issue=256</ref> Not much is known about her except that she was an "Internet nerd" when she was younger, and is currently in a [[band (music)|band]] called the "Capslock Love Affair." Her first appearance was in [http://applegeeks.com/comic_archive/viewcomic.php?issue=239 comic #239]. She has reappeared in Japan, touring with her band, presumably to search for Hawk after his disappearance. This could be of course just a coincidence. *'''Ashley''' is the world's next great super-villain. Some day. For now, she is the little red-headed terror of a daughter to a single mom. After Hawk, in his Power gear, commandeered her tricycle and returned it as scrap, she swore vengeance. To that end, she and her henchman, Mistah Bear have been formulating a master plan to exact their revenge. After finding out who Hawk was, Ashley has expanded her evil to his friends including Alice. *'''Old Mac''' is apparently either Hawk's first attempt at building a sentient lifeform from an Apple computer, or an old computer that somehow gained self awareness after a long time in storage. He is an old Compact Macintosh (implied to be the original 1984 model) that apparently has the voice of Morgan Freeman. ==Artistic directions== The comic has undergone several subtle changes over its development. Initially, it was drawn in a looser, hand-drawn fashion with nondescript backgrounds and softer colour tones. This style was very similar to the one Mac Hall's Ian McConville was using around the same time, and as a comparison were drawn between the two artists.<ref name="machall">{{cite web|date= December 16, 2004| title= Panagariya comments on ''Applegeeks'' being compared to ''Mac Hall''|url= http://www.hawkstudios.net/blog_archives/2004/12/whatever.html | accessdate= June 21, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060513210158/http://www.hawkstudios.net/blog_archives/2004/12/whatever.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = May 13, 2006}}</ref> [http://www.applegeeks.com/comic_archive/viewcomic.php?issue=17 Issue 17] however saw ''Applegeeks'' take a stylistic change, adopting a softer, more brushed look, with thick ink work and a warmer pastel
