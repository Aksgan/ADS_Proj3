major form of noise is ''hiss'' caused by random [[electron]]s that, heavily influenced by heat, stray from their designated path. These stray electrons influence the [[voltage]] of the output signal and thus create detectable noise. In the case of [[photographic film]] and [[magnetic tape]], noise (both visible and audible) is introduced due to the grain structure of the medium. In photographic film, the size of the grains in the film determines the film's sensitivity, more sensitive film having larger sized grains. In magnetic tape, the larger the grains of the magnetic particles (usually [[ferric oxide]] or [[magnetite]]), the more prone the medium is to noise. To compensate for this, larger areas of film or magnetic tape may be used to lower the noise to an acceptable level. == In audio == {{listen|filename=Noise_reduction_in_Audacity_(0,_5,_12,_30_dB)_(150Hz)_(0.15_sec).ogg|title=Noise reduction example|description=Example of noise reduction using [[Audacity]] with 0 [[decibel|dB]], 5 dB, 12 dB, and 30 dB reduction, 150 [[Hz]] frequency smoothing, and 0.15 seconds attack/decay time.}} When using [[analog (signal)|analog]] tape recording technology, they may exhibit a type of noise known as [[tape hiss]]. This is related to the particle size and texture used in the magnetic emulsion that is sprayed on the recording media, and also to the relative tape velocity across the [[tape head]]s. Four types of noise reduction exist: single-ended pre-recording, single-ended hiss reduction, single-ended surface noise reduction, and codec or dual-ended systems. Single-ended pre-recording systems (such as Dolby HX Pro) work to affect the recording medium at the time of recording. Single-ended hiss reduction systems (such as [[Noise_reduction#Dynamic_Noise_Reduction|DNR]]) work to reduce noise as it occurs, including both before and after the recording process as well as for live broadcast applications. Single-ended surface noise reduction (such as [[CEDAR Audio Ltd|CEDAR]] and the earlier SAE 5000A and Burwen TNE 7000) is applied to the playback of [[phonograph records]] to attenuate the sound of scratches, pops, and surface non-linearities. Dual-ended systems (such as [[Dolby noise reduction system|Dolby NR]] and [[dbx (noise reduction)|dbx Type I and II]]) have a pre-emphasis process applied during recording and then a de-emphasis process applied at playback. ===Dolby and dbx noise reduction system=== While there are dozens of different kinds of noise reduction, the first widely used audio noise reduction technique was developed by [[Ray Dolby]] in 1966. Intended for professional use, Dolby Type A was an encode/decode system in which the amplitude of frequencies in four bands was increased during recording (encoding), then decreased proportionately during playback (decoding). The Dolby B system (developed in conjunction with [[Henry Kloss]]) was a single band system designed for consumer products. In particular, when recording quiet parts of an audio signal, the frequencies above 1 kHz would be boosted. This had the effect of increasing the signal to noise ratio on tape up to 10dB depending on the initial signal volume. When it was played back, the decoder reversed the process, in effect reducing the noise level by up to 10dB. The Dolby B system, while not as effective as Dolby A, had the advantage of remaining listenable on playback systems without a decoder. [[dbx (noise reduction)|Dbx]] was the competing analog noise reduction system developed by [[Dbx, Inc.|dbx]] laboratories. It used a root-mean-squared (RMS) encode/decode algorithm with the noise-prone high frequencies boosted, and the entire signal fed through a 2:1 [[compander]]. Dbx operated across the entire audible bandwidth and unlike Dolby B was unusable as an open ended system. However it could achieve up to 30 dB of noise reduction. Since Analog [[video recording]]s use frequency modulation for the luminance part (composite video signal in direct colour systems), which keeps the tape at saturation level, audio style noise reduction is unnecessary. ===Dynamic Noise Reduction=== Dynamic Noise Reduction (DNR) is an audio noise reduction system, introduced by [[National Semiconductor]] to reduce noise levels on long-distance [[telephony]].[http://www.compolinc.com/dynamic.htm] First sold in 1981, DNR is frequently confused with the far more common [[Dolby noise reduction system]].[http://www.national.com/company/pressroom/history80.html] However, unlike Dolby and [[Dbx (noise reduction)|dbx]] Type I & Type II noise reduction systems, DNR is a playback-only signal processing system that does not require the source material to first be encoded, and it can be used together with other forms of noise reduction.[http://www.triadspeakers.com/education_avterms.html] It was a development of the [[patent|unpatented]] [[Philips]] Dynamic Noise Limiter (DNL) system, introduced in 1971, with the circuitry on a single [[semiconductor|chip]].[http://audiotools.com/noise.html][http://freespace.virgin.net/ljmayes.mal/comp/philips.htm] Because DNR is non-complementary, meaning it does not require encoded source material, it can be used to remove background noise from any audio signal, including [[magnetic tape]] recordings and [[FM radio]] broadcasts, reducing noise by as much as 10 dB.[http://www.national.com/pf/LM/LM1894.html] It can be used in conjunction with other noise reduction systems, provided that they are used prior to applying DNR to prevent DNR from causing the other noise reduction system to mistrack. One of DNR's first widespread applications was in the [[General Motors Corporation|GM]] [[Delco]] [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] [[car stereo]] systems in U.S. GM cars (later added to Delco-manufactured car stereos in GM vehicles as well), introduced in 1984.[http://www.rivowners.org/features/evolution/evpt83.html] It was also used in factory car stereos in [[Jeep]] vehicles in the 1980s, such as the [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Cherokee XJ]]. Today, DNR, DNL, and similar systems are most commonly encountered as a noise reduction system in microphone systems.[http://www.hellodirect.com/catalog/Product.jhtml?PRODID=11127&CATID=15295] ===Other approaches=== A second class of algorithms work in the time-frequency domain using some linear or non-linear filters that have local characteristics and are often called time-frequency filters<ref>B. Boashash, editor, “Time-Frequency Signal Analysis and Processing – A Comprehensive Reference”, Elsevier Science, Oxford, 2003; ISBN 0080443354</ref>. Noise can therefore be also removed by use of spectral editing tools, which work in this time-frequency domain, allowing local modifications without affecting nearby signal energy. This can be done manually by using the mouse with a pen that has a defined time-frequency shape. This is done much like in a paint program drawing pictures. Another way is to define a dynamic threshold for filtering noise, that is derived from the local signal, again with respect to a local time-frequency region. Everything below the threshold will be filtered, everything above the threshold, like
