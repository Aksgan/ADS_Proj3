It is designed for plastic injection modeling simulation based on [[finite volume method|finite volume analysis]] and [[computational fluid dynamics]]. ===Company history=== CoreTech System Co., Ltd. (Moldex3D) was founded in 1995, it has provided the professional CAE analysis solution "Moldex" series for the plastic injection molding industry, and the current product "Moldex3D" is marketed worldwide. The developer company oriented itself as the pioneer for plastic injection molding simulation in 3D field and published a series of 3D featured capabilities product. Sooner or later Lego in Denmark and Unilever in UK adopted this unique technology as it has never been seen in the market. The announcement of 3D technology then bacame the mainstream in simulation applications ==Interactions with other softwares== Moldex3D communicates with popular software as its preprocess, post-analysis and reports.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} ===Preprocess=== Moldex3D recognizes [[STL (file format)|STL files]] which can be generated by many . The [[Rhinoceros 3D|Rhino]] comes with Moldex3d has many [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] suitable for work with Moldex3d. Many [[List of CAx companies|CAD software]], such as [[Pro/ENGINEER|ProE]], can be the preprocessor or [Moldex3D]. ===Post analysis=== The output of Moldex3D can be further analyzed by [[ANSYS]]. ===Reports=== It generates reports in either [[Microsoft powerpoint|PowerPoint]] or [[HTML]] format. ==References== {{Empty section|date=July 2010}} ==External links== * [http://www.moldex3d.com/jla/en/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=278&Itemid=105 BLM tutorial] * [http://www.moldex3d.com/jla/en/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=277&Itemid=105 eDesign tutorial] * [http://www.moldex3d.com Moldex3D website] * [http://www.euctech.com indian resellar] ==Other Resources== [[Category:Computer-aided design software]] [[Category:Computer-aided engineering software]]</text> </page> <page> <id>24955</id> <title>Molecular breast imaging</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=September 2009}} {{Expert-subject|Medicine|date=September 2009}} {{Mergeto|Molecular imaging|date=September 2009}} '''Molecular breast imaging''' (MBI) is a new screening methodology for [[breast cancer]]. It helps identify tumors in dense tissue that often aren't visible with mammography. MBI overcomes a shortcoming of X-ray-based [[mammography]]. On a mammogram, X-ray imageries of tumors and dense breast tissue both appear white, which makes difficult to distinct. Therefore, MBI is currently considered as an adjunct to today's mammography. With MBI, a tumor is easy to see, even if it's in dense breast tissue. ==See also== * [[Mammography]] ==External links== * [http://www.ted.com/talks/deborah_rhodes.html Deborah Rhodes talking about MBI at TEDWomen 2010] (video) * http://www.photonics.com/Content/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=35115 * http://medicalphysicsweb.org/cws/article/research/26669 * http://www.mayoclinic.org/news2006-mchi/3352.html * http://mbi.auntminnie.com [[Category:Medical imaging]] {{med-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>24956</id> <title>Molecular cellular cognition</title> <text>'''Molecular cellular cognition''' (MCC) is that branch of [[neuroscience]] that deals with the study of cognitive processes with approaches that integrate molecular, cellular and behavioral mechanisms. Key goals of MCC studies include the derivation of molecular and cellular explanations of cognitive processes, as well as finding mechanisms and treatments for cognitive disorders. Although closely connected with [[behavioral genetics]], MCC emphasizes the integration of molecular and cellular explanations of behaviour, instead of focusing on the connections between genes and behavior. Unlike [[cognitive neuroscience]], which historically has focused on the connection between [[human brain]] systems and behavior, the field of MCC has used model organisms, such as mice, to study how molecular (ie. receptor, [[kinase]] activation, [[phosphatase]] regulation), intra-cellular (i.e. [[dendritic]] processes), and inter-cellular processes (i.e. [[synaptic plasticity]]; network representations such as place fields) modulate cognitive function. Methods employed in MCC include (but are not limited to) [[transgenic organism]]s (i.e. mice), [[viral vector]]s, [[pharmacology]], ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo'' [[electrophysiology]], [[optogenetics]], ''in vivo'' imaging, and behavioral analysis. Modeling is becoming an essential component of the field because of the complexity of the multilevel data generated. ==Scientific roots== The field of MCC has its roots in the pioneering studies of the role of [[NMDA receptor]] in [[Long term potentiation|long-term potentiation]] and [[spatial learning]]. The studies that crystallized the field used [[Knockout mice|knock out mice]] to look at the role of the [[Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase|alpha calcium calmodulin kinase II]] and [[FYN]] kinase in [[Hippocampus|hippocampal]] [[Long term potentiation|long-term potentiation]] and [[spatial learning]]. The field has expanded to include a large array of molecules including [[CREB]]. ==Foundation of the science== MCC became an organized field with the formation of the [http://www.molcellcog.org Molecular Cellular Cognition Society], an organization with no membership fees and meetings that emphasize the participation of junior scientists. Its [http://www.molcellcog.org/index.php?page=meeting-2002 first meeting] took place in Orlando, Florida on November first, 2002. As of August, 2009 the society had organized 16 meetings in North America, Europe and Asia, and included more than 1600 members. == References == *{{cite journal |author=Morris RG, Anderson E, Lynch GS, Baudry M |title=Selective impairment of learning and blockade of long-term potentiation by an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, AP5 |journal=Nature |volume=319 |issue=6056 |pages=774–6 |year=1986 |pmid=2869411 |doi=10.1038/319774a0 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v319/n6056/abs/319774a0.html}} *{{cite journal |author=Silva AJ, Paylor R, Wehner JM, Tonegawa S |title=Impaired spatial learning in alpha-calcium-calmodulin kinase II mutant mice |journal=Science (journal) |volume=257 |issue=5067 |pages=206–11 |year=1992 |pmid=1321493 |doi= |url=}} *{{cite journal |author=Silva AJ, Stevens CF, Tonegawa S, Wang Y |title=Deficient hippocampal long-term potentiation in alpha-calcium-calmodulin kinase II mutant mice |journal=Science (journal) |volume=257 |issue=5067 |pages=201–6 |year=1992 |pmid=1378648 |doi= |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/257/5067/201}} *{{cite journal |author=Grant SG, O'Dell TJ, Karl KA, Stein PL, Soriano P, Kandel ER |title=Impaired long-term potentiation, spatial learning, and hippocampal development in fyn mutant mice |journal=Science (journal) |volume=258 |issue=5090 |pages=1903–10 |year=1992 |pmid=1361685 |doi= |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/258/5090/1903}} *{{cite journal |author=Silva AJ |title=Molecular and cellular cognitive studies of the role of synaptic plasticity in memory |journal=J.
