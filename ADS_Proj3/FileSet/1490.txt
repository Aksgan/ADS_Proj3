and ''Bubbler'' had more in common with [[Atari]]'s [[Marble Madness]] than previous Filmation titles. Ultimate's final, unreleased title, ''[[Mire Mare]]'', was long thought to have been Filmation-based, but in the late 1990s [[Rare (company)|Rare]] revealed that it would actually have been more like the top-down ''[[Sabre Wulf]]'', the first title based around the [[Sabreman]] character.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://web.archive.org/web/19990209155351/www.rareware.com/retro/limbo/ | title=Rare Titles in Limbo | publisher=Rare website | accessdate=2006-06-04}}</ref> == Games == ; Filmation: * ''[[Knight Lore]]'' (1984) * ''[[Alien 8]]'' (1985) * ''[[Pentagram (video game)|Pentagram]]'' (1986) ; Filmation II: * ''[[Nightshade (video game)|Nightshade]]'' (1985) * ''[[Gunfright]]'' (1986) ; Miscellaneous: * ''[[Martianoids]]'' (1987) * ''[[Bubbler (video game)|Bubbler]]'' (1987) == Influence == {{ multiple image| | image1 = ZX Batman.png | width1 = 200 | caption1 = ''[[Batman (1986 video game)|Batman]]'' by [[Ocean Software]] | image2 = Equinox game.png | width2 = 220 | caption2 = ''[[Equinox (video game)|Equinox]]'' by [[Software Creations (UK)]] }} {{Main|Isometric projection#Notable examples of "isometric" computer and video games}} The Filmation style was extremely influential in the period immediately following the release of ''Knight Lore'' and ''Alien 8'', and it was copied extensively by other publishers in titles such as ''[[Fairlight (game)|Fairlight]]'', ''[[The Great Escape (video game)|The Great Escape]]'', ''[[Batman (video game)#Batman (1986)|Batman]]'', ''[[Head Over Heels (game)|Head Over Heels]]'' and ''[[Solstice (video game)|Solstice]]''. Later, [[Rare (company)|Rare]], the company that Ultimate Play The Game evolved into, reprised the style themselves with their releases ''[[Snake Rattle 'n' Roll]]'' ([[NES]] and [[Sega Mega Drive]]) and ''[[Monster Max]]'' ([[Game Boy]]; written by Bernie Drummond and [[Jon Ritman]], the authors of the aforementioned ''Batman'' and ''Head Over Heels''). ''[[Cadaver (video game)|Cadaver]]'' by the [[Bitmap Brothers]], released on the [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]] in 1990, bore striking similarities to ''Knight Lore'', and even named the game's location "Castle Wulf" after ''Knight Lore''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s precedent game, ''[[Sabre Wulf]]''. Later titles such as the UK-developed ''[[Sonic 3D]]'' ([[Sega Mega Drive]] and [[Sega Saturn]]) and [[Moonpod]]'s ''[[Mr. Robot]]'' ([[Microsoft Windows]]) (which takes a great deal of influence from ''Alien 8''), have adopted similar isometric graphical styles and gameplay. == Media == <gallery> file:Alien 8 3.gif|'''Filmation''' in ''[[Alien 8]]'' file:Pentagram 4.gif|'''Filmation''' in ''[[Pentagram (video game)|Pentagram]]'' file:Gunfright 1.gif|'''Filmation II''' in ''[[Gunfright]]'' file:Bubbler 1.gif|Filmation II-like engine in ''[[Bubbler (video game)|Bubbler]]'' </gallery> ==References== {{refs}} == External links == * [http://retrospec.sgn.net/users/nwalker/filmation/ On Filmation], a discussion of the engine * [http://retrospec.sgn.net/game-overview.php?link=filmation Filmation Viewer/Editor], tool for viewing and creating custom Filmation maps * [http://www.crashonline.org.uk/51/runagain.htm/ Looking for an Old Angle], CRASH article on Filmation and other isometric games * [http://zenbullets.com/isometric/ Flash 3d isometric engine] {{Ultimate Play The Game series}} [[Category:Video game engines]]</text> </page> <page> <id>13560</id> <title>Filmweb</title> <text>{{Infobox Website | name = Filmweb | logo = [[Image:Filmweb_pl_new_logo.png|200px]] | screenshot = | caption = | url = [http://www.filmweb.pl/ www.filmweb.pl] | commercial = Yes | type = [[Online]] [[Film|movie]] & [[TV]] [[database]],<br/>[[Social network service|Social networking website]] | language = [[Polish language|Polish]] | registration = Optional | owner = Omnigence | author = [[Artur Gortych]] | launch date = March 18, 1998 | current status = Active | revenue = |slogan = "Łeb pełen filmów"<br/>(eng.

[[Category:Social network services]] {{Internet-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>13571</id> <title>Filtration (mathematics)</title> <text>In [[mathematics]], a '''filtration''' is an [[indexed set]] ''S<sub>i</sub>'' of [[subobject]]s of a given [[algebraic structure]] ''S'', with the index ''i'' running over some [[index set]] ''I'' that is a [[totally ordered set]], subject to the condition that if ''i'' ≤ ''j'' in ''I'' then ''S<sub>i</sub>'' ⊆ ''S<sub>j</sub>''. The concept [[Dual (category theory)|dual]] to a filtration is called a ''cofiltration''. Sometimes, as in a [[filtered algebra]], there is instead the requirement that the <math>S_i</math> be subobjects{{Clarify|date=February 2010}} with respect to certain operations (say, vector addition), but with respect to other operations (say, multiplication), they instead satisfy <math>S_i \cdot S_j \subset S_{i+j}</math>, where here the index set is the natural numbers; this is by analogy with a [[graded algebra]]. Filtrations are widely used in [[abstract algebra]], [[homological algebra]] (where they are related in an important way to [[spectral sequence]]s), and in [[measure theory]] and [[probability theory]] for nested sequences of [[sigma algebra|σ-algebras]]. In [[functional analysis]] and [[numerical analysis]], other terminology is usually used, such as [[scale of spaces]] or [[nested spaces]]. ==Examples== ===Algebra=== {{See also|Filtered algebra}} ====Groups==== {{See also|Length function}} In algebra, filtrations are ordinarily indexed by '''N''', the set of natural numbers. A ''filtration'' of a group ''G'', is then a nested sequence ''G''<sub>''n''</sub> of [[normal subgroup]]s of ''G'' (that is, for any ''n'' we have ''G''<sub>''n''+1</sub> ⊆ ''G''<sub>''n''</sub>). Given a group ''G'' and a filtration ''G''<sub>''n''</sub>, there is a natural way to define a topology on ''G'', said to be ''associated'' to the filtration. A basis for this topology is the set of all translates of subgroups appearing in the filtration, that is, a subset of ''G'' is defined to be open if it is a union of sets of the form ''aG''<sub>''n''</sub>, where ''a''∈''G'' and ''n'' is a natural number. The topology associated to a filtration on a group ''G'' makes ''G'' into a [[topological group]]. The topology associated to a filtration ''G''<sub>''n''</sub> on a group ''G'' is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] if and
