group not connected to the original, known as '''Ellesdee'''. The usage of the original disk magazine's name, as well as Ellessdee being a corruption of the original creator's name (LSD), brought strong criticism from other members of the demo scene, including the original team. [http://www.scene.org/showforum.php?forum=4&topic=49732] Some original LSD members 'were' approached for permission to start the revival project and the first issues contained submissions from KenD/LSD. The revival web site, as well as that of Ellessdee's, was subsequently shut down. The exact reasons for this are in dispute. == Controversy == Later issues of Grapevine allowed readers to vote for their favourite demo-coder, graphics artist e.t.c. It was generally believed these charts were artificially weighted in favour of LSD members and their friends. LSD members were subsequently excluded from the charts. Of course, the most popular and authoratative chart was The Crusaders Eurochart. LSD often distributed voting forms for this chart that cheekily had the diskmagazine section pre-filled with a vote for Grapevine. == External links == *[http://www.pictureinthesky.net/applications.php Picture in the Sky] - Contains various Grapevine downloads. *[http://www.byterapers.scene.org/maggy/maggy11/index.htm#25 Grapevine controversy] *[http://hipooniosamigasite.ath.cx/hipoonios/amigadocs/ LSD Docs Disks in Amiga Guide and Html version.] [[Category:Amiga magazines]] [[Category:Defunct computer magazines]] [[Category:Disk magazines]] [[Category:Demoscene]]</text> </page> <page> <id>15685</id> <title>Graph-tool</title> <text>{{Infobox software | name = graph-tool | developer = Tiago de Paula Peixoto | latest_release_version = 2.2.8 | latest_release_date = {{release date and age|2010|11|16}} | operating_system = [[Cross-platform]] | programming language = [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[C++]] | genre = [[Software library]] | license = [[GPL]] | website = http://graph-tool.skewed.de }} {{Portal|Free software}} '''graph-tool''' is an efficient [[Python (programming language)|Python]] module for manipulation and statistical analysis of [[Graph (mathematics)|graphs]] (a.k.a. [[Network_theory|networks]]). Contrary to most other python modules with similar functionality, the core data structures and algorithms of graph-tool are implemented in [[C++]], making extensive use of [[metaprogramming]], based heavily on the [[Boost Graph Library]]. This confers a level of performance which is comparable (both in memory usage and computation time) to that of a pure [[C++]] library. == Features == * Creation and manipulation of [[Directed graph|directed]] or [[Graph (mathematics)|undirected graphs]]. * Association of arbitrary information to the vertices, edges or even the graph itself, by means of property maps. * Filter vertices and/or edges "on the fly", such that they appear to have been removed. * Support for [[DOT_language|dot]] and [[GraphML]] formats. * Convenient and powerful [[graph drawing]] based on [[Graphviz]]. * Support for typical statistical measurements: degree/property histogram, combined degree/property histogram, vertex-vertex correlations, [[assortativity]], average vertex-vertex [[shortest path]], etc. * Support for several graph-theoretical algorithms: such as [[graph isomorphism]], [[Subgraph isomorphism problem|subgraph isomormism]], [[minimum spanning tree]], [[connected components]], [[dominator]] tree, [[maximum flow]], etc. * Support for several [[centrality]] measures. * Support for [[clustering coefficient|clustering coefficients]], as well as [[network motif]] statistics and [[community structure]] detection. * Generation of [[random graphs]], with arbitrary degree distribution and correlations. * Support for well-established network models: [[preferential attachment|Price]], [[Barabási–Albert model|Barabási-Albert]], Geometric Networks, Multidimensional [[lattice graph]], etc. ==External links== * [http://graph-tool.skewed.de/ Official graph-tool web site] {{DEFAULTSORT:graph-tool}} [[Category:Numerical software]] [[Category:Free mathematics software]] [[Category:Free software programmed in Python]] [[Category:Free software programmed in C++]] [[Category:Graph drawing]]</text> </page> <page> <id>15687</id> <title>GraphPad Prism</title> <text>{{Infobox Software | name = GraphPad Prism | developer = GraphPad Software, Inc. | latest_release_version = 5.03/5.0c | latest_release_date = Jan. 2010 | operating_system = [[Mac OS X]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] | genre =Scientific graphing, statistics and nonlinear regression (curve fitting) | license = [[Proprietary software|Proprietary]] | website = [http://www.graphpad.com/prism www.graphpad.com/prism] }} '''GraphPad Prism''' is a commercial scientific 2D graphing and [[statistics software]] published by GraphPad Software, Inc., a privately-held California corporation.

In its simplest form, it is a way of coloring the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] share the same color; this is called a '''vertex coloring'''. Similarly, an '''edge coloring''' assigns a color to each edge so that no two adjacent edges share the same color, and a '''face coloring''' of a planar graph assigns a color to each face or region so that no two faces that share a boundary have the same color. Vertex coloring is the starting point of the subject, and other coloring problems can be transformed into a vertex version. For example, an edge coloring of a graph is just a vertex coloring of its [[line graph]], and a face coloring of a [[planar graph]] is just a vertex coloring of its [[dual graph|planar dual]]. However, non-vertex coloring problems are often stated and studied ''as is''.
