Sturgeons were more optimized for reconnaissance than the subsequent Los Angeles class, which have greater speed, but less internal space, and optimized for blue water, principally antisubmarine, missions. They used the AN/WLQ-4 "Sea Nymph" SIGINT system, which may have been too large to fit the Los Angeles class. The Sturgeon class submarine ''Parche'' (SSN-683) received an addition {{convert|100|ft|m|-1|sing=on}} hull extension containing "research and development equipment" that brought her total length to {{convert|401|ft|m|0}}. Of the three-vessel ''Seawolf'' class, the ''Jimmy Carter'' also is of extended length, presumably for intelligence systems and special operations. Seawolf and Los Angeles classes were directed at a Soviet threat, so the newer Virginia class has additional capabilities for the littoral environment. Los Angeles class submarines have modernized and smaller ELINT, the AN/WLR-18 "Classic Salmon" for lower frequencies and the AN/WSQ-5 "Cluster Spectator" for higher frequencies. The latter is in a series of code names suggesting it is for tactical use, while the former name is more associated with strategic systems, especially for intelligence. Newer submarines have an AN/WLR-8 radar signal analyzer and an AN/WLR-10 (or AN/BLR-15) radar warning receiver. There are variants, among the classes, of a radar antenna, interferometric direction finder, COMINT receiver.<ref name=Friedman2003 /> All US submarines, as new construction on the [[Virginia class submarine]]s and retrofitted to the Improved [[Los Angeles class submarine]]s and possibly Seawolfs, will receive an upgraded Electronic Support suite, designed as a minimally manned, passive receiving system capable of detection, acquisition, identification, and localization of a variety of signals of interest <ref name=Fages2000>{{Citation | last = Fages | first = Malcolm I | title = Statement to Senate Armed Services Committee Seapower Subcommittee on Submarine Warfare Systems for the 21st century |date=23 March 2000 | url = http://www.navy.mil/navydata/testimony/seapower/fages000323.txt}}</ref>. ES contains the AN/BLQ-10 SIGINT system, which gives detection, emitter location and MASINT identification, direction finding, and strategic intelligence support. It was first implemented in 2000 and should be in all US submarines by 2012 <ref name=NISR/>. ES is not limited to the AN/BLQ-10 alone, but a major improvement in receiving, with an expected 200% improvement in performance with the Type 18I periscope and Integrated Electronics Mast (IEM), especially in the littorals. Completing the current ES concept is the AN/ULR-21 CLASSIC TROLL system that increases the probability of SIGINT intercept by 500%, supporting tactical and national requirements.<ref name=Fages2000 /> ==Aircraft Platforms== A wide range of aircraft were used with low-tech aircraft such as the WWII [B-24] with temporarily mounted electronics, to platforms extensively modified for the mission, and evolved to strategic [[RC-135]] and [[EP-3|EP-3E Aries II]] aircraft. ===Argentina: Aircraft Platforms=== After its experience in the Falklands, Argentina had a 707 converted to an ELINT aircraft by Israel.<ref name=Spyflight707 /> ===Australia: Aircraft Platforms=== [[Australia]] has ordered the Wedgetail 737 AWACS from a [[Boeing]]-led team.<ref name=Wedgetail737 /> The 18 [[Lockheed AP-3C Orion|AP-3C Orion]] were upgraded to included fitting each aircraft with a new Elta EL/M-2022(V)3 radar, a nose-mounted Star Safire III electro-optical and infrared system, "highly capable" signals and electronic intelligence (SIGINT/ELINT) equipment, the UYS 503 acoustic system, a new automatic information system processor, a new navigation system based on two Honeywell H764G Embedded GPS/INUs, a new communications system and other improvements. ===Chile: Aircraft Platforms=== Chile has a full Israeli [[Phalcon]] system on a single 707 airframe. This system provides SIGINT as well as airborne radar warning and control. ===China: Aircraft Platforms=== Prof. Desmont Ball identified Chinese the first major airborne SIGINT platforms as the four-turboprop EY-8, a variant of the Russian An-12 'Cub' as China's main ELINT and reconnaissance aircraft a decade ago.<ref name=ChineseSIGINT /> EY-8 construction may be continuing for ELINT/SIGINT and electronic warfare missions. This capability, however, is much inferior to the Japanese equivalents.<ref name=Fisher2005/>. They were supplemented or replaced four locally modified Tu-154Ms, comparable to the Russian 1980s vintage Il-20 ELINT aircraft. ===France: Aircraft Platforms=== France operates the C-160 aircraft twin-turboprop tactical transport, due to be replaced by the C-160 by the Airbus Military A400M transport when that enters service from 2009. The French Air Force will begin retiring its fleet of C-160 transports in 2005. Gabriel SIGINT versions of the Transall are an upgraded electronic surveillance version in service with the French Air Force, which also operates four Astarte strategic communications relay versions.
