Source Conference 2008 "Decision Advantage" agenda, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, July 2008.]</ref> and previously Mr. Jardines' Senior Advisor for Policy.<ref>[http://www.dniopensource2007.com/sessions.cfm DNI Open Source Conference 2007 "Expanding the Horizons" agenda, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, July 2007.]</ref> ==OSINT Communities== ===Government=== There are a large number of open source activities taking place throughout the US Government. Frequently, these open source activities are described as "media monitoring", "media analysis", "internet research" and "public surveys" but are open source nonetheless. The [[Library of Congress]] sponsors the [[Federal Research Division]] (FRD) which conducts a great deal of tailored open source research on a fee-for-service basis for the executive branch. ===Intelligence=== The US Intelligence Community's open source activities (known as the [[National Open Source Enterprise]]) are dictated by Intelligence Community Directive 301 promulgated by the Director of National Intelligence.<ref>DNI Intelligence Community Directive 301 - [http://www.fas.org/irp/dni/icd/icd-301.pdf "National Open Source Enterprise"] 11 July 2006.</ref> The Directive establishes the authorities and responsibilities of the Assistant Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Open Source (ADDNI/OS), the DNI's Open Source Center and the National Open Source Committee. Prior to the establishment of the National Open Source Enterprise, the [[Foreign Broadcast Information Service]] (FBIS), established in 1941, was the government's primary open source unit, transcribing and translating foreign broadcasts. It absorbed the Defense Department's [[Joint Publications Research Service]] (JPRS), which did a similar function with foreign printed materials, including newspapers, magazines, and technical journals. ===Military=== The former [[Under-Secretary of Defense for Intelligence]], Dr. [[Stephen Cambone]] encouraged in part by the [[Defense Science Board]] reports on [[Strategic Communication]] and [[Transition to and From Hostilities]], created the Defense Open Source Program (DOSP). The current Under-Secretary of Defense for Intelligence assigned executive agency for this program to the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]]. U.S. military offices that engage in OSINT activities include: *Defense Intelligence Agency *[[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] *[[Foreign Military Studies Office|US Army Foreign Military Studies Office]] *US Army Asian Studies Detachment *[http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/dod/eucom/jac/ EUCOM JAC Molesworth] *Open Source Branch, Joint Intelligence Center, [[U.S. Special Operations Command]] *Foreign Media Monitoring in Support of Information Operations, [[U.S. Strategic Command]] ===Homeland Security=== The [[Department of Homeland Security]] has an active open source intelligence unit. In congressional testimony before the House Homeland Security Committee's Intelligence, Information Sharing and Terrorism Risk Assessment Subcommittee the Undersecretary of Homeland Security Charles Allen indicated on February 14, 2007, that he had established the "Domestic Open Source Enterprise" to support the Department's OSINT needs and that of state, local and tribal partners. ===Law enforcement=== The law enforcement OSINT community applies open source intelligence (OSINT) to the prediction, prevention, investigation, and prosecution of criminals including terrorists. Examples of successful law enforcement OSINT include [[Scotland Yard]] OSINT; [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) OSINT. [[INTERPOL]] and [[EUROPOL]] experimented with OSINT units for a time, but they appear to have atrophied with the departure of their individual champions. New York Police Department (NYPD) is known to have an OSINT unit, as does the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, housed within the Emergency Operations Bureau and affiliated with the LA Joint Regional Intelligence Center. ===Business=== Business OSINT encompasses [[Commercial Intelligence]], [[Competitor Intelligence]], and [[Business Intelligence]], and is often a chief area of practice of [[private intelligence agency|private intelligence agencies]]. Businesses may use [[information broker]]s and [[private investigator]]s to collect and analyze relevant information for business purposes which may include the [[Mass media|media]], [[deep web]], [[web 2.0]] and commercial content. ==See also== *[[Intellipedia]] *[[Open Source Center]] *[[Private intelligence agency]] *[[ROSIDS]] *[[Special Libraries Association]] *[[Strategic intelligence]] * [[NATO Open Source Intelligence Handbook]], [[NATO Open Source Intelligence Reader]] *[[ViTAP]] *[[MiTAP]] *[[DARPA TIDES program]] *[[Investigative Data Warehouse]] *[[Fusion Center]] ==References== {{Reflist}} == Literature == ;Scientific Publications * Arthuer S.
