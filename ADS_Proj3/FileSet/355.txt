It is based on search technology provided by [[Fast Search & Transfer]] (FAST), a [[Norway|Norwegian]] company. BASE is a registered service provider for the [[Open Archives Initiative]] (OAI), and has contributed to the [[Digital Repository Infrastructure Vision for European Research]] (DRIVER) project since June 2006. OAI metadata are "[[Web harvesting|harvested]]" for the BASE project from scientific [[Digital repository|digital repositories]] that implement the [[Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting]] (OAI-PMH), and are [[Index (search engine)|indexed]] using FAST's software. In addition to OAI [[metadata]], the library indexes selected web sites and local data collections, all of which can be searched via a single search interface. BASE is distinguished from commercial search engines by the following features: * Resources are academically selected * [[Document server]]s must comply with specific requirements of scientific quality and relevance * Searches are provided with [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]] by a data resources inventory * [[Full text search]]es plus metadata are available (where available) * BASE discloses resources of the [[deep Web]], which are often ignored by commercial search engines or get lost in vast quantities of hits * Search results are displayed with precise [[Bibliographic database|bibliographic data]] (where available) * There are several options for sorting the result list, and search results can be refined by author, resource, document type, language, etc.) == See also == * [[List of academic databases and search engines]] ==External links== * [http://www.base-search.net/ BASE search] [[Category:Internet search engines]] [[Category:Information retrieval]] [[Category:Open access]] [[Category:Bibliographic databases]] [[de:Bielefeld Academic Search Engine]] [[es:BASE]] [[fr:BASE (moteur de recherche)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>3057</id> <title>BASICODE</title> <text>[[Image:basicode.jpg|300px|thumb|BASICODE's "[[Esperanto]] for computers" claim, from the [[East Germany|East German]] publication ''radio fernsehen elektronik''.]] '''BASICODE''' was a computer project intended to create a unified standard for the [[BASIC]] [[programming language]]. BASIC was available on many popular [[home computer]]s, but there were countless variants that were mostly [[computer compatibility|incompatible]] with each other. The project was initiated in 1980 by Hobbyscoop, a radio program off the [[Netherlands]] broadcasting organisation [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting]] (NOS). The basic implementation were architecture-specific utility applications that executed calls of [[subroutines]] for text, audio and sound defined in the BASICODE language standard according to the abilities of the computer in question. These applications, called ''Bascoders'', also enabled the sharing of data and programs across different computer platforms by defining a data format for the [[compact audio cassette]]s that were regularly used as storage media in the 1980s. A BASICODE program stored on cassette could be loaded and run on any computer supporting the language. BASICODE was often called "[[Esperanto]] for computers" for that reason. ==BASICODE== ===The situation at the beginning of the 1980s=== [[Image:Commodore64.jpg|thumb|right|Commodore 64]] [[Image:Atari 800XL Plain White.jpg|thumb|right|Atari 800 XL]] From the late 1970s to the late 1980s [[home computers]] based on 8 bit processors were very popular. Among the most well-known models were the [[TRS-80]] by [[Tandy]], the [[PET 2001]], [[VIC-20]], [[Commodore 64|C64]], [[Commodore 128|C128]] and the [[Commodore Plus/4|Plus/4]] by [[Commodore International|Commodore]], the [[Atari]] [[Atari 8-bit family|400/800 (XL/XE)]], the [[Sinclair Research]] computers ([[Sinclair ZX80|ZX80]], [[Sinclair ZX81|ZX81]], [[ZX Spectrum]]) and the [[KC 85|KC85 family]] popular in the [[German Democratic Republic]]. All these computers had a [[CPU]] of the [[MOS Technology 6502]] or [[Zilog Z80]] type, 16 to 64 [[kilobyte]] [[random access memory|RAM]], connectors for a cassette drive or a built-in one for data storage, and finally a [[BASIC]] [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] that was generally stored in [[read-only memory|ROM]]. The flat learning curve of BASIC, which had been designed with newcomers to programming in mind, and the instant availability of the language on all these computers led to many users writing and sharing their own programs. A problem was that sharing programs and data across computers by different manufacturers was difficult because the various BASIC dialects were totally incompatible in some areas. They used different BASIC commands to make the same action (like clearing the screen, drawing a pixel or playing a sound), so that a BASIC program written for the C64 did not work on an Atari XL without modification and vice versa. Another difficulty was the fact that while these computers were similar, they still differed in key hardware aspects like screen resolution, available color palette or audio abilities. Finally, the data formats used for storing data on cassette were incompatible as well. ===The first standard=== [[Image:ZXSpectrum48k.jpg|thumb|right|Sinclair ZX Spectrum]] Around 1980 the Netherlands broadcaster NOS began transmitting computer programs by radio. Because programs and data were stored as audio on compact cassettes, it was possible to record such a broadcast on tape and load it into the computer later. However, because of the problems mentioned earlier, the program had to be adapted for nearly all popular types of computers and broadcasted multiple times as well. Because the compact cassette has a very low data density compared to today's storage media, the recording of the programs took quite a long time, and only a limited number of programs could be broadcast per show. So, the additional broadcasting of different versions of the same programs was a great inconvenience. In 1982 the executives at NOS decided to develop a unified data format. An application that was specific for each computer model, called ''Bascoder'', managed the recall and storage of programs and data in this unified format from
