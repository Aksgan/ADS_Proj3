for Helith and thus making him the poster child and victim for federal forces. It is not known who is member of "Helith" nor how many members do exist or what they do in detail because very few information get public and Rembrandt itself is a very problematic character like [[Theo de Raadt]]. ==History== Helith was founded in 1998-1999 in the Berlin area as a location for its members to share information without judging anybody about how they make their living or for whom they work. Their computer hardware and work on various projects like [[John the Ripper]] (partly SSE2 code, porting to [[OpenBSD]]), [[metasploit]], medusa, [[hydra]] or [[nmap]]. In time, the members of "Helith" released several security advisories affecting even the most secure OpenSource [[Operating System]] [[OpenBSD]], OpenBSD [[PF]] [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]], [[OpenSSH]], [[NetBSD]] and vendors like [[Netgear]] or [[Nortel]]. On July 30, 2007, [[Washington Post]] reporter [[Brian Krebs]] wrote an article partly about "Helith" cracking the [[Deutsche Bank]] internal network. The global links of Helith reach least from Germany where it was founded, to Russia, Romania, Columbia, several African countries and the USA. ==Members== Helith Network membership varied but included at various times: * benkei, * ConCode, * Cyneox, * Rembrandt, * Rott_En, * Skyout, * Zarathu A lot other members might be active but are not disclosed.
