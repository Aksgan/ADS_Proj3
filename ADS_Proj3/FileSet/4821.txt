It includes almost all technologies found in Windows Server 2003 SP2 but has been modified in some areas to remove or limit features. It also includes some new capabilities not found in Windows Server 2003 SP2: === Home Server Console === While the underlying operating system is built on [[Windows Server 2003]] [[Windows Server 2003#Service Pack 2|SP2]], the configuration interface is designed to be user friendly enough that it can be set up without prior knowledge of server administration. The configuration interface, called the ''Home Server Console'', is delivered as an [[Remote Desktop Protocol|RDP]] application to remote PCs - while the application runs on the server itself, the UI is rendered on the remote system. The Home Server Console client application can be accessed from any Windows PC. The server itself requires no video card or peripherals; it is designed to require only an [[Ethernet]] card and at least one [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Vista]] or [[Windows 7]] computer. === Drive Extender === '''Windows Home Server Drive Extender''' is a file-based replication system that provides three key capabilities:<ref>{{cite web | url=http://blogs.technet.com/homeserver/archive/2007/02/15/the-death-of-the-drive-letter.aspx | title=The Death of the Drive Letter ... | date=2007-02-15 | work=Windows Home Server Team Blog | accessdate=2007-04-28}}</ref> * Multi-disk redundancy so that if any given disk fails, data is not lost * Arbitrary storage expansion by supporting any type of [[hard disk]] drive ([[Serial ATA]], [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]], [[FireWire]] etc.) in any mixture and capacity &mdash; similar in concept to [[Non-RAID drive architectures#JBOD|JBOD]] * A single folder namespace (no drive letters) Users (specifically those who configure a family's home server) deal with storage at two levels: [[Shared resource|Shared Folders]] and Disks. The only concepts relevant regarding disks is whether they have been "added" to the home server's storage pool or not and whether the disk appears healthy to the system or not. This is in contrast with Windows' [[Logical Disk Manager]] which requires a greater degree of technical understanding in order to correctly configure a [[RAID]] array. Shared Folders have a name, a description, permissions, and a flag indicating whether duplication (redundancy) is on or off for that folder. If duplication is on for a Shared Folder (which is the default on multi-disk Home Server systems and not applicable to single disk systems) then the files in
