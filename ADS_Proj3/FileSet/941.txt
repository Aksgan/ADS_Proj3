The total storage contributed in aggregate must be equal to the amount consumed for the viability of the co-operative. However, some nodes may contribute less and some may contribute more. There may be reward models to compensate the nodes contributing more. Unlike a traditional [[Cloud storage|storage cloud]], a cooperative does not employ dedicated servers for the actual storage of the data, thereby eliminating the need for a significant dedicated hardware investment. Each node in the cooperative runs specialized [[software]] which communicates with a centralized control and orchestration server, thereby allowing the node to both consume and contribute storage space to the cloud. The centralized control and orchestration server requires several orders of magnitude less resources (storage, compute and bandwidth) to operate relative to the overall capacity of the cooperative. == Data security == Files which are hosted in the cloud will be fragmented and [[Encryption|encrypted]] before leaving the local machine. They are then distributed randomly using a [[Load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] and [[geo-distribution]] [[algorithm]] to other nodes in the cooperative.<ref name=xconomy>{{cite web|last=Huang|first=Gregory T|title=Symform, Founded by Ex-Microsoft Pair, Offers Cheap, Efficient Data Storage in the Cloud|url=http://www.xconomy.com/seattle/2009/02/19/symform-founded-by-ex-microsoft-pair-offers-cheap-efficient-data-storage-in-the-cloud/|work=Xconomy|date=2009-02-19|accessdate=2010-10-14}}</ref> Users can add an additional layer of [[Information security|security]] and reduce storage space by [[Data compression|compressing]] and encrypting files before they are copied to the cloud. == Data redundancy == In order to maintain [[data integrity]] and high availability across a relatively unreliable set of computers over a [[wide area network]] like the [[Internet]], the source node will add some level of [[Data redundancy|redundancy]] to each [[Block (data storage)|data block]]<ref name=computerworld/>. This allows the system to recreate the entire block even if some nodes are temporarily unavailable (due to network connectivity, the machine being powered off or a hardware failure.). The most storage and [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] efficient forms of redundancy use [[Erasure code|erasure coding]] techniques like [[Reed-Solomon]]. A simple, less [[CPU]] intensive but more expensive form of redundancy is duplicate copies. == Flexible contribution == Due to bandwidth or hardware constraints some nodes may not be able to contribute as much space as they consume in the cloud. On the other hand, nodes with large storage space and limited or no bandwidth constraints may contribute more than they consume, thereby the cooperative can always stay in balance. == Examples == Currently the only commercially operational example of a cooperative storage cloud is operated by [[Symform, Inc.]], a [[Venture capital|venture-funded]] [[Startup company|startup]] based in [[Seattle, WA]].<ref name="computerworld">{{cite web|last=Mearian|first=Lucas|title=Start-up unveils cloud storage co-op|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9138257/Start_up_unveils_cloud_storage_co_op|work=[[Computerworld]]|date=2009-09-21|accessdate=2010-10-14}}</ref> Non-commercial examples include the University of California's OceanStore project and MIT's Chord.<ref name=computerworld/> ==See also== *[[Cloud computing]] *[[Cloud storage]] ==References== {{Reflist}} [[Category:Cloud storage]] [[Category:Cloud computing]]</text> </page> <page> <id>8123</id> <title>Coordinate-free</title> <text>A '''coordinate-free''', or '''component-free''', treatment of a [[scientific theory]] or [[mathematical]] topic develops its ideas without reference to any particular [[coordinate system]]. Coordinate-free treatments generally allow for simpler systems of equations, allowing greater [[mathematical elegance]] at the cost of some [[abstraction]] from the detailed formulae needed to evaluate these equations within a particular system of coordinates. Coordinate-free treatments were the only possible approach to [[geometry]] before the development of [[analytic geometry]] by [[Descartes]]. After several centuries of generally coordinate-based exposition, the "modern" tendency is now generally to introduce students to coordinate-free treatments early on, and then to derive the coordinate-based treatments from the coordinate-free treatment, rather than ''vice-versa''. Fields which are now often introduced with coordinate-free treatments include [[vector calculus]], [[tensor]]s, and [[differential geometry]]. In physics, the existence of coordinate-free treatments of physical theories is a corollary of the principle of [[general covariance]]. == See also == * [[Change of basis]] * [[Differential geometry]] * [[Coordinate conditions]] * [[Component-free treatment of tensors]] [[Category:Geometry]] {{physics-stub}} {{math-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>8133</id> <title>Copperplate script</title> <text>{{distinguish|Copperplate Gothic}} [[Image:Gravura sample.png|thumb|300px|right|Sample of a digital '''Copperplate typeface''' based on the [[Letraset]] Gravura typeface by Phill Grimshaw.]] '''Copperplate''', or '''English round hand''', is a style of [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] writing, using a sharp pointed [[pen nib|nib]] instead of the flat nib used in most calligraphic writing. Its name comes from the fact that the copybooks from which students learned it were printed from etched copper plates.<ref>[http://www.yourdictionary.com/copperplate copperplates] (definition 4)</ref> Copperplate script was prevalent in the 19th century, but was used as early as in the 16th century in Europe. As a result, the term "copperplate" is mostly used to refer to any old-fashioned, tidy handwriting. This style of calligraphy is different from that produced by angled nibs in that the thickness of the stroke is determined by the pressure applied when writing, instead of nib angle in relation to the writing surface. All copperplate forms (minuscules, majuscules, numbers, and punctuation) are written at a letter slant of 55 degrees from the horizontal.<ref>Winters, Eleanor: Mastering Copperplate â€“ A Step-by-Step Manual for Calligraphers. Watson-Guptill, NY, 1989</ref> In Australia in the 1980s, the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] prescribed a new form of handwriting which lacked the loops and curious capital letter forms that appear in standard [[cursive]] to be taught to children in government schools. This "copperplate" is sometimes understood to mean the old-fashioned cursive.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Americans are familiar with Copperplate chiefly because it is the style in which the body of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] is printed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/the-formation-of-character|title=The Formation of Character|author=David Skinner|work=[[The New Atlantis]]|accessdate=28 May 2010}}</ref> ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Writing]] [[Category:Calligraphy]]</text> </page> <page> <id>8151</id> <title>Coq</title> <text>{{Infobox programming language | name = Coq | paradigm = Functional | year = | designer = | developer = | latest_release_version = 8.3 | latest_release_date = {{release_date|2010|10}} | latest_test_version = | latest_test_date = | typing = [[static typing|static]], [[strong typing|strong]] | implementations = | dialects = | influenced = [[Agda (theorem prover)|Agda]] | influenced_by = [[ML programming language|ML and Standard ML]] | license = [[LGPL]] 2.1 | website = [http://coq.inria.fr/ Coq website] | file ext = .v | operating_system = [[Cross-platform]] }}
