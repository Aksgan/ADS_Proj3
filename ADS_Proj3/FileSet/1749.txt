Except where noted otherwise, the basic rules presented here are valid independent of the scoring rules used. The scoring rules are explained separately. [[Go terms|Go concepts]] for which there is no ready English equivalent are commonly called by their Japanese names. ===Basic rules=== [[Image:Go adjacent stones.png|thumb|right|One black chain and two white chains, their liberties shown with dots. Note that liberties are shared among all stones of a chain.]] Two players, ''Black'' and ''White'', take turns placing a ''stone'' (game piece) of their own color on a vacant ''point'' (intersection) of the grid on a Go board. Black moves first. If there is a large difference in skill between the players, Black is sometimes allowed to place two or more stones on the board for their first move - see [[Go handicaps]] for details. The official grid comprises 19×19 lines, though the rules can be applied to any grid size; 13×13<!-- Measurement unit(s) needed--> and 9×9 are popular choices to teach beginners.<ref>Kim 1994 pp. 3–4</ref> Once placed, a stone may not be moved to a different point.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = [[Nihon Kiin]] | url = http://www.nihonkiin.or.jp/lesson/school-e/okikata-e.htm | title = How to place Go stones | accessdate = 2007-03-04}}</ref> Vertically and horizontally adjacent stones of the same color form a ''chain'' (also called a ''string'') that shares its [[Go terms#Liberty .28.E6.B0.94.29|liberties]] (see below) in common, cannot subsequently be subdivided, and in effect becomes a single larger stone.<ref>{{citation | url = http://nrich.maths.org/public/viewer.php?obj_id=1433 | title = Behind the Rules of Go | last = Matthews | first = Charles | publisher = University of Cambridge | accessdate = 2008-06-09}}</ref> Only stones connected to one another by the lines on the board create a chain; stones that are diagonally adjacent are not connected. Chains may be expanded by placing additional stones on adjacent intersections, and can be connected together by placing a stone on an intersection that is adjacent to two or more chains of the same color. [[Image:Go capturing.png|thumb|left|If white plays at A, the black chain loses its last liberty. It is captured and removed from the board.]] A vacant point adjacent to a stone is called a ''liberty'' for that stone.<ref>Kim 1994 p. 12</ref><ref group="nb">Compare "[[liberty (division)|liberty]]", a small local government unit in medieval England – the "local area under control".</ref> Stones in a chain share their liberties. A chain of stones must have at least one liberty to remain on the board. When a chain is surrounded by opposing stones so that it has no liberties, it is ''captured'' and removed from the board. Most rule sets do not allow a player to place a stone in such a way that one of their own chains is left without liberties, subject to the following important exception.<ref>Kim 1994 p. 28</ref> The rule does not apply if playing the new stone results in the capture of one or more of the opponent's stones. In this case, the opponent's stones are captured first, leaving the newly played stone at least one liberty.<ref>Kim 1994 p. 30</ref> The rule just stated is said to prohibit ''suicide''. (Since suicide is very rarely useful, making it legal does not significantly alter the nature of the game.) <div class="thumb tright"> <div class="thumbinner" style="width:144px; font-size: 100%;"> {{Go board 5x5|= | ul| u| u| u| ur|= | l| b| w| | r|= | b| c| b1| w| r|= | l| b| w| | r|= | dl| d| d| d| dr|28}} <div class="thumbcaption" style="font-size: 88%;"> An example of a situation in which the ko rule applies </div> </div> </div> Players are not allowed to make a move that returns the game to a previous position. This rule, called the ''[[Rules of Go#Ko|ko rule]]'' (from the Japanese 劫 ''kō'' "eon"), prevents unending repetition.<ref name=ko>Kim 1994 pp 48–49</ref> See the example to the right: Black has just played the stone marked '''1''', capturing a white stone at the intersection marked with a circle. If White were now allowed to play on the marked intersection, that move would capture the black stone marked '''1''' and recreate the situation before Black made the move marked '''1'''. Allowing this could result in an unending cycle of captures by both players. The ko rule therefore prohibits White from playing at the marked intersection immediately. Instead White must play elsewhere; Black can then end the ko by filling at the marked intersection, creating a five-stone Black chain. If White wants to continue the ko, White will try to find a play that Black must answer; if Black answers, then White can retake the ko. A repetition of such exchanges is called a ''ko fight''.<ref name="Ko">Kim 1994 pp. 144–147</ref> While the various rule sets agree on the ko rule prohibiting returning the board to an ''immediately'' previous position, they deal in different ways with the relatively uncommon situation in which a player might recreate a past position that is further removed. See [[Rules of Go#Repetition|Rules of Go: Repetition]] for further information. Instead of placing a stone, a player may ''pass''. This usually occurs when they believe no useful moves remain. When both players pass consecutively, the game ends and is then [[Rules of Go#End|scored]]. ===Scoring rules=== There are two basic scoring systems used to determine the winner at the end of a game; they almost always give the same result. ''Territory scoring'' counts the number of empty points your stones surround, together with the number of stones you captured. While it originated in China, today it is commonly associated with Japan and Korea. ''Area scoring'' counts the number of points your stones occupy and surround. It is associated with contemporary Chinese play and was probably established there during the [[Ming Dynasty]] in the 15th or
