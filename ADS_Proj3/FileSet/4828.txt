The application are available for use directly on Windows Mobile 6.5 devices, and on personal computers. It was announced at the 2009 [[Mobile World Congress]], and began operation on 6 October 2009, featuring an initial 246 applications.<ref name=PCworld1>[http://www.pcworld.com/article/173225/whats_inside_the_windows_mobile_marketplace.html]</ref> Initially it is available only for Windows Mobile 6.5, and was made available to all 6.x versions few weeks later.<ref>http://windowsteamblog.com/blogs/windowsphone/archive/2009/11/16/windows-marketplace-for-windows-mobile-6-0-and-6-1.aspx</ref> On February 15, 2010 Microsoft announced its next generation mobile platform named [[Windows Phone 7]]. With this newly redesigned platform, Microsoft will use a separate app store, called [[Windows Phone Marketplace]], for its new mobile OS, and will not share the same apps, UI, or some features of the current version for Windows Mobile 6.x because of the many differences in user interface and experience between these two platforms. ==Pricing and features== Windows Marketplace for Mobile, available through applications for Windows Mobile and personal computers, offers a 24-hour return policy for buyers, and 70% of each application sale will be paid to developers.<ref name="giz explains">{{cite web |url=http://i.gizmodo.com/5199933/giz-explains-all-the-smartphone-mobile-app-stores |title=Giz Explains: All The Smartphone Mobile App Stores |author=Herrman, John |date=2009-04-06 |publisher=Gizmodo |accessdate=2009-04-06}}</ref> A one-time $99 USD fee for developers to list an unlimited number of paid applications or up to five free applications yearly in the store is charged by Microsoft. After five free applications have been listed for the year, each additional free application can be listed for a $19.99 USD fee. Microsoft accepts payment from buyers through credit cards and [[Mobile network operator|carrier]] charges. Microsoft announced that students that are members of Microsoft's [[DreamSpark]] program can submit applications to the store for free, waiving the $99 USD fee. Carriers also have the ability to create a [[brand]]ed section of the store to market carrier-specific applications and services for their customers.<ref name="nextgen" /> ==Content restrictions== Microsoft enforces certain rules before developers can submit apps to the Marketplace.<ref>http://developer.windowsphone.com/resources/en-us/MarketplaceContentPolicies.pdf</ref> Some of these restrictions include: * Sex / Nudity – Images that are suggestive or sexual (e.g. sexually provocative touching, bondage, masturbation) or provocative images that reveal nipples, genitals, buttocks, or pubic hair. * Any adult and/or borderline adult content (images or text). * Content that generally falls under the category of pornography. * Content that depicts or suggests prostitution. * Any content depicting sexual fetishes. * Any content of a sexual nature depicting children or animals. ==History== Rumors about the service began to surface around the internet in September 2008, whereas it was referred to as "Skymarket", and was to appear with the Windows Mobile 7 release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2009/02/ballmer-windows-mobile-65-phones-are-just-windows-phones.ars |title=Windows Mobile 6.5 UI a big improvement; more work needed |author=Bright, Peter |coauthors=Protalinski, Emil |date=2009-02-16 |publisher=Ars Technica |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref> Rumors stemmed from an online job listing from Microsoft's website calling for a "Senior Product Manager".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.istartedsomething.com/20080831/microsoft-launch-skymarket-applications-marketplace-windows-mobile-7/ |title=Microsoft to launch “Skymarket” applications marketplace for Windows Mobile 7 |author=Zheng, Long |publisher=I Started Something |date=2008-08-31 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref> On February 16, 2009, Microsoft made an official announcement for the service at the 2009 [[Mobile World Congress]] for use with upcoming Windows Mobile 6.5 devices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2009/feb09/02-16MWCPR.mspx |title=Microsoft Reveals New Windows Phones With Marketplace and My Phone Services |publisher=Microsoft |date=2009-02-16 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref> The company has since announced that availability of the service will be by the end of 2009.<ref name="nextgen">{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2009/mar09/03-30CTIA09PR.mspx |title=Microsoft Gains Support for Next Generation of Windows Phones |date=2009-03-30 |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=2009-04-29}}</ref> The store opened for business on 6 October 2009, featuring 246 applications.<ref name=PCworld1/> On November 12, 2009, the Marketplace web application was opened.<ref name="WMV HD Database">{{cite web |url=http://wmvhddatabase.com/article/23/News/Microsoft-Launches-Windows-Mobile-Web-Store/ |title=Microsoft Launches Windows Mobile Web Store |date=2009-11-12 |publisher= WMV HD Database |accessdate=2009-11-12}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> ==See also== *[[List of digital distribution platforms for mobile devices]] ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://marketplace.windowsphone.com/ Marketplace for Windows Mobile] *[http://developer.windowsmobile.com/Marketplace.aspx Developer portal] {{Windows Mobile}} {{Digital distribution platforms}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Windows Marketplace For Mobile}} [[Category:Windows Mobile]] [[Category:Microsoft software]] [[Category:Mobile software]] [[ru:Windows Marketplace for Mobile]]</text> </page> <page> <id>40303</id> <title>Windows Media Video</title> <text>'''{{Infobox file format | name = Windows Media Video | icon = [[Image:VistaWMVIcon.PNG|64px|WMV Icon]] | extension = .wmv | mime = video/x-ms-wmv | type code = | uniform type = com.microsoft.windows-media-wmv | owner = [[Microsoft]] | genre = [[video file format]] | container for = | contained by
