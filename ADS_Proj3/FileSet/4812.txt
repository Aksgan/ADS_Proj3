centralised control over upgrades to systems. [[Remote Installation Services]] (RIS) are a means to automatically install Windows 2000 Professional (and not Windows 2000 Server) to a local computer over a network from a central server. Images do not have to support specific hardware configurations and the security settings can be configured after the computer reboots as the service generates a new unique security ID (SID) for the machine. This is required so that local accounts are given the right identifier and do not clash with other Windows 2000 Professional computers on a network.<ref>Mark Minasi. ''Installing Windows 2000 on Workstations with Remote Installation Services''.</ref> RIS requires that client computers are able to boot over the network via either a [[network interface card]] that has a [[Pre-Boot Execution Environment]] (PXE) boot [[Read-only memory|ROM]] installed or that the client computer has a network card installed that is supported by the remote [[boot disk]] generator. The [[remote computer]] must also meet the [[Net PC]] specification. The server that RIS runs on must be Windows 2000 Server and it must be able to access a network [[Domain Name System|DNS]] Service, a [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]] service and the Active Directory services.<ref>''Microsoft Press'' (2000).

IT IS MODIFIED AND LIMITED VERSION OF THIS PRODUCT COMBINED WITH OTHER SERVER PRODUCTS --> == Editions == Microsoft released various editions of Windows 2000 for different markets and business needs: Professional, Server, Advanced Server and Datacenter Server. Each was packaged separately. '''Windows 2000 Professional''' was designed as the desktop operating system for businesses and [[power user]]s. It is the client version of Windows 2000. It offers greater security and stability than many of the previous Windows desktop operating systems. It supports up to two [[central processing unit|processors]], and can address up to 4 [[Gigabyte|GB]] of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]]. The system requirements are a Pentium processor of 133 MHz or greater, at least 32 MB of RAM, 650 MB of hard drive space, and a [[CD-ROM]] drive (recommended: [[Pentium II]], 128 MB of RAM, 2 GB of hard drive space, and CD-ROM drive).<ref name="SysReq"> {{cite web |url = http://support.microsoft.com/kb/304297 |title = System requirements for Microsoft Windows 2000 operating systems |accessdate = 2008-05-23}} </ref> '''Windows 2000 Server''' [[Stock-keeping unit|SKUs]] share the same [[user interface]] with Windows 2000 Professional, but contain additional components for the computer to perform [[Server (computing)|server]] roles and run infrastructure and [[application software]]. A significant new component introduced in the server SKUs is [[Active Directory]], which is an enterprise-wide directory service based on [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]]. Additionally, Microsoft integrated [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]] network authentication, replacing the often-criticised [[NTLM]] authentication system used in previous versions. This also provided a purely [[Active Directory#Trust|transitive-trust]] relationship between Windows 2000 [[Windows Server domain|domains]] in a ''[[Active Directory#Forests.2C trees.2C and domains|forest]]'' (a collection of one or more Windows 2000 domains that share a common [[Active Directory#Objects|schema]], configuration, and [[Active Directory#Forests.2C trees.2C and domains|global catalog]], being linked with two-way [[Active Directory#Trust|transitive trusts]]). Furthermore, Windows 2000 introduced a [[Microsoft DNS|Domain Name Server]] which allows dynamic registration of [[Internet Protocol|IP]] addresses. Windows 2000 Server supports up to 4 processors, requires 128 MB of RAM and 1 GB hard disk space, however requirements may be higher depending on installed components.<ref name="SysReq"/> '''Windows 2000 Advanced Server''' is a variant of Windows 2000 Server operating system designed for medium-to-large businesses. It offers [[Computer clustering|clustering]] infrastructure for [[high availability]] and [[scalability]] of applications and services, including main memory support of up to 8 gigabytes (GB) on [[Physical Address Extension]] (PAE) systems and the ability to do 8-way [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]]. It supports [[TCP/IP]] [[Network Load Balancing Services|load balancing]] and enhanced two-node server clusters based on the [[Microsoft Cluster Server]] (MSCS) in Windows NT Server 4.0 Enterprise Edition.<ref>''Microsoft''.

System requirements are similar to those of Windows 2000 Server,<ref name="SysReq"/> however they may need to be higher to scale to larger infrastructure. '''Windows 2000 Datacenter Server''' is a variant of Windows 2000 Server designed for large businesses that move large quantities of confidential or sensitive data frequently via a central [[Server (computing)|server]].<ref name="Datacenter">[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/265173 The Datacenter Program and Windows 2000 Datacenter Server Product]</ref> Like Advanced Server, it supports [[clustering]], [[High-availability cluster|failover]] and [[load balancing]]. Its minimum [[system requirements]] are normal, but it was designed to be capable of handing advanced, fault-tolerant and [[scalability|scalable]] hardware—for instance computers with up to 32 CPUs and 64 [[gigabyte|GBs]] RAM, with rigorous system testing and qualification, hardware partitioning, coordinated maintenance and [[change control]].

IDC's report is based on telephone interviews of IT executives and managers of 104 [[North America]]n companies in which they determined what they were using for a specific workload for file, print, security and networking services. IDC determined that the four areas where Windows 2000 had a better TCO than Linux — over a period of five years for an average organization of 100 employees — were file, print, network infrastructure and security infrastructure. They determined, however, that Linux had a better TCO than Windows 2000 for web serving. The report also found that the greatest cost was not in the
