Especially, SRA interpolates a given function with a specific [[rational function]] whose [[poles]] and [[root of a function|zeros]] are [[simple]], which means that there is no multiplicity in poles and zeros. Sometimes, it only implies simple poles. The main application of SRA lies in finding the [[root of a function|zeros]] of [[secular function]]s. A divide-and-conquer algorithm to find the [[eigenvalues]] and [[eigenvectors]] for various kinds of [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] is well-known in [[numerical analysis]]. In a strict sense, SRA implies a specific [[interpolation]] using simple rational functions as a part of the divide-and-conquer algorithm. Since such secular functions consist of a series of rational functions with simple poles, SRA is the best candidate to interpolate the zeros of the secular function. Moreover, based on previous researches, a simple zero that lies between two adjacent poles can be considerably well interpolated by using a two-dominant-pole rational function as an approximating function. == One-point third-order iterative method: Halley's formula == The origin of the interpolation with rational functions can be found in the previous work done by [[Edmond Halley]]. Halley's formula is known as one-point third-order iterative method to solve <math>\,f(x)=0</math> by means of approximating a rational function defined by :<math>h(z)=\frac{a}{z+b}+c.</math> We can determine a, b, and c so that :<math>h^{(i)}(x)=f^{(i)}(x), \qquad i=0,1,2.</math> Then solving <math>\,h(z)=0</math> yields the iteration :<math>x_{n+1}=x_{n}-\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} \left({\frac{1}{1-\frac{f(x_n)f''(x_n)}{2(f'(x_n))^2}}}\right).</math> This is referred to as Halley's formula. This ''geometrical interpretation'' <math>h(z)</math> was derived by Gander(1978), where the equivalent iteration also was derived by applying Newton's method to
