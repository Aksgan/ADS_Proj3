It can also refer to art produced through a process, any one of whose steps was influenced by such software or hardware. This term is vague and relatively [[neologism|new]]; nevertheless much of the work described by this term is rarely described any other way. For instance, a common type of cyberart which is produced programmatically by applying a set of design rules to a natural or preexisting process. A program could produce a few million such 'works of art' in a minute. [[CyberARTS]] is also a school program in Toronto that allows students to use digital media as a means to learn school material. Schools that offer this program are [[Don Mills CI]] and Northview Heights.

It was sold as a stand-alone product, and was also bundled as part of Delrina's [[CommSuite 95]] offering. In addition to the Web browser application, it also included an ftp client, [[Usenet]] newsgroup reader, an [[IRC]] client, a graphic interface to [[Gopher (protocol)|gopher]] services and more. It used a Wizard-based front-end that would provided access to all of these services. It was touted as being the first 32-bit based Web browsing program, and was aimed squarely at [[Windows 95]] users. It could transform seamlessly from one application to another as required, a feature that would not be emulated until later browsers of the late 1990s. As an application it arguably had two main drawbacks: its browser application was incapable of rendering tables, which were then becoming predominant in Web site design, and it also lacked an email client. While table support was added more than a year later,<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20070101083019/http://www.symantec.com/press/1996/n960417.html Symantec Posts Update for Cyberjack Internet Suite (Internet Archive)</ref> by that time it had lost important [[mindshare]]. In the end, it arguably could not compete against other browser offerings that were offered for free, such as the contemporaneous [[Internet Explorer 2]], which came out November 1995 and [[Netscape Navigator]]. Although marketed by [[Symantec]], the Cyberjack suite was written by a small South African startup, [[Vironix]] Software Laboratories. Vironix was owned by Dave and Paula Hall and originally operated from [[Westville, KwaZulu-Natal|Westville]], Durban. During the development of Cyberjack the majority of the programmers moved to a new office in [[Muizenberg]], a beach town near Cape Town. The entire programming team consisted of only about six developers, roughly one per Internet application. The suite was sold to Delrina, which was later bought by Symantec. However, it came to market at about the time that the [[Internet Explorer]]/Netscape Navigator battle was developing, and the small programming team with limited resources could not keep up with the pace of browser development. After Cyberjack was discontinued by Symantec, Vironix went into liquidation although some of the members of the Cyberjack team went on to develop the [[WebFerret]] application. ==See also== *[[Internet Suite]] *[[List of mergers and acquisitions by Symantec]] ==External links== *[http://www.monitor.ca/monitor/issues/vol3iss10/feature4.html Review of Cyberjack browser, accessed November 6, 2005] *[http://geekt.org/geekt/comment.cgi?newsid=1124 Cyberjack promotional t-shirt of GeekT.org, accessed November 6, 2005] *[http://web.archive.org/web/19970110035422/http://www.cyberjack.com/ Cyberjack.com support Web site, (its design originally dating to 1995), as seen on WaybackMachine.com] ==References== {{reflist}} {{Earlybrowsers}} {{Gopher clients}} {{Internet suits}} [[Category:Gopher clients]] [[Category:Windows software]] [[Category:Windows-only software]] [[Category:Windows web browsers]] [[Category:Internet Gopher]] [[Category:Internet suites]] [[Category:1995 software]] [[Category:Discontinued web browsers]] {{web-software-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>8800</id> <title>Cybermentors</title> <text>'''CyberMentors''' is an online [[peer mentoring]] service for children and young people aged 11-18, delivered through a [[social networking site]] at cybermentors.org.uk.
