of machinery, a railroad, a steamship, an airplane. As we cut out useless parts and simplify necessary ones, we also cut down the cost of making. ... But also it is to be remembered that all the parts are designed so that they can be most easily made. This [[standardization]] of parts was central to Ford's concept of mass production, and the manufacturing "[[tolerances]]", or upper and lower dimensional limits that ensured [[interchangeability]] of parts became widely applied across manufacturing. Decades later, the renowned Japanese quality guru, [[Genichi Taguchi]], demonstrated that this "goal post" method of measuring was inadequate. He showed that "[[loss]]" in capabilities did not begin only after exceeding these tolerances, but increased as described by the [[Taguchi Loss Function]] at any condition exceeding the nominal condition. This became an important part of [[W. Edwards Deming]]'s quality movement of the 1980s, later helping to develop improved understanding of key areas of focus such as [[cycle time variation]] in improving manufacturing quality and efficiencies in aerospace and other industries. While Ford is renowned for his production line it is often not recognized how much effort he put into removing the fitters' work to make the production line possible. Until Ford, a car's components always had to be fitted or reshaped by a skilled engineer at the point of use, so that they would connect properly. By enforcing very strict specification and quality criteria on component manufacture, he eliminated this work almost entirely, reducing manufacturing effort by between 60-90%.<ref>{{Hounshell1984}} pp 248 ff.</ref> However, Ford's mass production system failed to incorporate the notion of "pull production" and thus often suffered from over-production. === Toyota develops TPS === Toyota's development of ideas that later became Lean may have started at the turn of the 20th century with [[Sakichi Toyoda]], in a textile factory with looms that stopped themselves when a thread broke, this became the seed of autonomation and ''[[Jidoka]]''. Toyota's journey with JIT may have started back in 1934 when it moved from textiles to produce its first car. [[Kiichiro Toyoda]], founder of Toyota, directed the engine casting work and discovered many problems in their manufacture. He decided he must stop the repairing of poor quality by intense study of each stage of the process. In 1936, when Toyota won its first truck contract with the Japanese government, his processes hit new problems and he developed the "[[Kaizen]]" improvement teams. Levels of demand in the Post War economy of Japan were low and the focus of mass production on lowest cost per item via economies of scale therefore had little application. Having visited and seen supermarkets in the USA, Taiichi Ohno recognised the scheduling of work should not be driven by sales or production targets but by actual sales. Given the financial situation during this period, over-production had to be avoided and thus the notion of Pull (build to order rather than target driven Push) came to underpin production scheduling. It was with [[Taiichi Ohno]] at Toyota that these themes came together. He built on the already existing internal schools of thought and spread their breadth and use into what has now become the [[Toyota Production System]] (TPS). It is principally from the TPS, but now including many other sources, that Lean production is developing. Norman Bodek wrote the following in his foreword to a reprint of Ford's ''Today and Tomorrow:'' :I was first introduced to the concepts of just-in-time (JIT) and the Toyota production system in 1980. Subsequently I had the opportunity to witness its actual application at Toyota on one of our numerous Japanese study missions. There I met Mr. Taiichi Ohno, the system's creator. When bombarded with questions from our group on what inspired his thinking, he just laughed and said he learned it all from Henry Ford's book." The scale, rigor and continuous learning aspects of TPS have made it a core concept of Lean. ==Types of waste== While the elimination of waste may seem like a simple and clear subject it is noticeable that waste is often very conservatively identified. This then hugely reduces the potential of such an aim. The elimination of waste is the goal of Lean, and Toyota defined three broad types of waste: [[muda (Japanese term)|''muda'']], [[muri (Japanese term)|''muri'']] and [[mura (Japanese term)|''mura'']]; it should be noted that for many Lean implementations this list shrinks to the first waste type only with corresponding benefits decrease. To illustrate the state of this thinking [[Shigeo Shingo]] observed that only the last turn of a bolt tightens itâ€”the rest is just movement. This ever finer clarification of waste is key to establishing distinctions between value-adding activity, waste and non-value-adding work.<ref>''Toyota Production System'', Taichi Ohno, Productivity Press, 1988,, p. 58</ref> Non-value adding work is waste that must be done under the present work conditions. One key is to measure, or estimate, the size of these wastes, to demonstrate the effect of the changes achieved and therefore the movement toward the goal. The "flow" (or smoothness) based approach aims to achieve JIT, by removing the variation caused by work scheduling and thereby provide a driver, rationale or target and priorities for implementation, using a variety of techniques. The effort to achieve JIT exposes many quality problems that are hidden by buffer stocks; by forcing smooth flow of only value-adding steps, these problems become visible and must be dealt with explicitly. ''Muri'' is all the unreasonable work that management imposes on workers and machines because of poor organization, such as carrying heavy weights, moving things around, dangerous tasks, even working significantly faster than usual. It is pushing a person or a machine beyond its natural limits. This may simply be asking a greater level of performance from a process than it can handle without taking shortcuts and informally modifying decision criteria. Unreasonable work is almost always a cause of multiple variations. To link these three concepts is simple in TPS and thus Lean. Firstly, ''muri'' focuses on the preparation and planning of the process, or what work can
