science focuses more on fact and empirical measurement. ==Criticism== Science journalists regularly come under criticism for falsely reporting scientific stories. Very often, such as with [[climate change]], this leaves the public with the impression that disagreement within the scientific community is much greater than it actually is.<ref>http://tigger.uic.edu/~pdoran/012009_Doran_final.pdf</ref> Science is based on experimental [[evidence]], [[Test method|testing]] and not dogma, and disputation is a normal activity.<ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/series/badscience</ref> ==See also== {{Portal|Journalism}} * [[Popular science]] * [[Public awareness of science]] * [[Scientific literature]] * ''[[Frontiers of Science]]'' * [[Science by press conference]] ==References== <references/> ==External links== * [http://www.wfsj.org/course Online Course in Science Journalism] * [http://www.iscos.org/ Training Course in Science Journalism] * [http://www.eusja.org/ European Union of Science Journalists' Associations] * [http://www.nasw.org/ National Association of Science Writers (USA)] * [http://www.nwscience.org/ Northwest Science Writers Association (Pacific Northwest, USA)] * [http://www.absw.org.uk/ Association of British Science Writers] * [http://www.sciencewriters.ca/ Canadian Science Writers' Association] * [http://www.arabsciencejournalists.net/index.php?setLanguage=en Arab Science Journalists Association] * [http://www.journalism.nyu.edu/prospectivestudents/coursesofstudy/serp/ New York University Science, Health and Environmental Reporting Program] * [http://www.ugis.it/ Union of Italian Science Journalists (UGIS, Unione Giornalisti Italiani Scientifici)] * [http://www.wfsj.org/ World Federation of Science Journalists] * [http://relateproject.eu/ ReLaTe- Research Labs for Teaching Journalists- the EU co-funded project for young science journalists] {{DEFAULTSORT:Science Journalism}} [[Category:Journalism by field]] [[Category:Science writing| ]] [[de:Wissenschaftsjournalismus]] [[et:Teadusajakirjandus]] [[es:Periodismo científico]] [[lt:Mokslinė žurnalistika]] [[pt:Jornalismo científico]] [[ru:Научная журналистика]] [[sv:Vetenskapsjournalistik]] [[ta:அறிவியல் எழுத்து]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33357</id> <title>Sciencenet</title> <text>{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2010}} {{Infobox Software | name = Sciencenet YaCy | screenshot = | caption = | developer = [[Michael Christen]], Urban Liebel, Dominic S.

The Sciencenet software ([[YaCy]]) is based on [[Peer-to-peer|p2p]] technology developed by [[Michael Christen]] in collaboration with Liebel-lab at KIT. == Background == Scientific knowledge is spread across many databases, research institutes, educational websites and literature repositories. Today's search engines success is often based on popularity ranking. Popularity ranking is a powerful method for general search strategies, but less efficient for scientific knowledge. The Sciencenet search engine is especially for scientific websites and scientific content. Its index is a collection of educational (e.g. of ".edu" / ".ac.uk" /".ac.au") and research dedicated sites (e.g. the German Helmholtz society, Max Planck institutes or Swiss and Austrian universities). This is the major difference to the global [[YaCy]] search engine ("Freeworld"), which serves as a global search engine. == Sciencenet architecture == Sciencenet is a network of Linux PCs running "[[YaCy]]" software. The "Sciencenet core cluster" is located at the Institute of Toxicology and Genetics (Liebel-Lab), KIT Karlsruhe (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology). Sciencenet-YaCy software has been designed and tested to run in a network with at least 2000 [[CPU]]s, with up to 10 [[Mio]] webpages per single CPU, allowing to search large and/or distributed information repositories. == Mission == Any university / research institute is encouraged to use the software and contribute to the scientific network. The software automatically connects to the "core cluster" and contributes its search engine to the distributed sciencenet network. A high speed internet broadband connection (> 2 [[megabit|Mbit]]/s) and dedicated PCs are required. Ideally every research institute runs the free YaCy-Sciencenet software on 1–2 local PCs and provides its webpages to the network. As a side effect, wasted bandwidth from external search engines is reduced to a minimum. The sciencenet ideally provides a free, open scientific search engine index to the community. == Sciencenet current status == * Currently (March 2010) 35 low cost Linux-PCs running [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[YaCy]] software share ~300,000,000 documents in a distributed peer2peer network. == External links == * The [http://sciencenet.kit.edu Sciencenet search portal] * See the current [http://sciencenet.kit.edu/Network Sciencenet network] overview. * See the [http://141.52.175.32:8080/Network.html?page=1 participating peers] with detailed index information. * [http://liebel-lab.org Liebel-Lab] * [http://yacy.net yacy.net] {{Distributed search engines}} <!-- Categories --> [[Category:Distributed data storage]] [[Category:Free search engine software]] [[Category:Internet search engines]] [[Category:Java platform software]] {{database-software-stub}} {{science-stub}} [[it:Sciencenet]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33362</id> <title>Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute</title> <text>The '''Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute''' is a permanent research institute at the [[University of Utah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sci.utah.edu/about.html|title=About SCI webpage}}</ref> It is a leader in engineering and research in the areas of [[scientific computing]], [[Visualization (computer graphics)|visualization]], and [[imaging science|imaging]]. It focuses on solving computational and imaging problems in medicine, geophysics, chemical engineering, molecular dynamics, aerospace, fluid mechanics, combustion, and atmospheric dispersion. == Associated research centers == The SCI Institute houses the NIH/NCRR Center for Integrative Biomedical Computing (CIBC)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sci.utah.edu/cibc/|title=CIBC Homepage}}</ref> and is associated with several other national research centers: * [[United_States_Department_of_Energy|DoE]] Center for the Simulation of Accidental Fires and Explosions (C-SAFE) * DoE Visualization and Analytics Center for Enabling Technologies (VACET) * DoE Scientific Data Management Center * DoE Center for Technology for Advanced Scientific Component Software (TASCS) * NIH National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) * NIH Center for Computational Biology. == Open source software releases == [[Image:Iv3d-torso.png|250px|thumb| A [[Computed tomography|CT]] scan of a human torso rendered with ImageVis3D]] Besides research in the areas mentioned above, a particular focus of SCI has been to develop innovative and robust software packages, and release them as [[open source]]. Examples: * SCIRun, a scientific [[Problem Solving Environment|problem solving environment]] (PSE) for modeling, simulation and visualization of scientific problems (includes BioPSE); * BioTensor, a program to process and visualize [[Diffusion MRI|diffusion tensor images]]; * Seg3D, an interactive segmentation tool; * map3d, a scientific visualization application written to display and edit complex, three-dimensional geometric models and scalar, time-based data associated with those models; * [[ImageVis3D]], a lightweight, feature-rich volume rendering application; and * [[VisTrails]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vistrails.org/|title=VisTrails website}}</ref> a new scientific workflow management system. == External links == <references/> {{University of Utah}} {{coord|40|46|3.72|N|111|50|42.00|W|type:edu|display=title}} [[Category:Universities and colleges in Utah|Utah, University of]] [[Category:University of Utah| ]] [[Category:Education in Salt Lake City, Utah]] [[Category:Computational science]] [[Category:Research institutes in the United States]] [[Category:Anatomical simulation]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33373</id> <title>Scientific literature</title> <text>{{dablink|This article
