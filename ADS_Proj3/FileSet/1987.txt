An example is GL<sub>1</sub> acting on a one-dimensional space. The definition is more restrictive than it initially appears: such spaces have remarkable properties, and there is a classification of irreducible prehomogeneous vector spaces, up to a transformation known as "castling". ==Homogeneous spaces in physics== [[Cosmology]] using the [[general theory of relativity]] makes use of the [[Bianchi classification]] system. Homogeneous spaces in relativity represent the [[space (physics)|space part]] of background [[Metric (mathematics)|metrics]] for some [[Physical cosmology|cosmological model]]s; for example, the three cases of the [[Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric]] may be represented by subsets of the Bianchi I (flat), V (open), VII (flat or open) and IX (closed) types, while the [[Mixmaster universe]] represents an [[isotropy|anisotropic]] example of a Bianchi IX cosmology.<ref>{{cite |title=Course of Theoretical Physics vol. 2: The Classical Theory of Fields |author=[[Lev Landau]] and [[Evgeny Lifshitz]] |isbn=978-0750627689 |date=1980 |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann}}</ref> A homogeneous space of ''N'' dimensions admits a set of <math>N(N-1)/2</math> [[Killing vectors]].<ref>{{cite |title=Gravitation and Cosmology |author=[[Steven Weinberg]] |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |date=1972}}</ref> For three dimensions, this gives a total of six linearly independent Killing vector fields; homogeneous 3-spaces have the property that one may use linear combinations of these to find three everywhere non-vanishing Killing vector fields <math>\xi^{(a)}_{i}</math>, :<math>\xi^{(a)}_{[i;k]}=C^{a}_{\ bc}\xi^{(b)}_i \xi^{(c)}_k</math> where the object <math>C^{a}_{\ bc}</math>, the "structure constants", form a [[constant]] [[tensor|order-three tensor]] [[antisymmetric tensor|antisymmetric]] in its lower two indices (on the left-hand side, the brackets denote antisymmetrisation and ";" represents the [[covariant derivative|covariant differential operator]]).

There are several efficient, partially homomorphic cryptosystems, and two fully homomorphic, but less efficient cryptosystems. ==Partially homomorphic cryptosystems== In the following examples, the notation <math>\mathcal{E}(x)</math> is used to denote the encryption of the message ''x''. ===Unpadded RSA=== If the [[RSA cryptosystem|RSA]] public key is modulus <math>m</math> and exponent <math>e</math>, then the encryption of a message <math>x</math> is given by <math>\mathcal{E}(x) = x^e \mod m</math>. The homomorphic property is then :<math>\mathcal{E}(x_1) \cdot \mathcal{E}(x_2) = x_1^e x_2^e \mod m = (x_1x_2)^e \mod m = \mathcal{E}(x_1 \cdot x_2)</math> ===ElGamal=== In the [[ElGamal|ElGamal cryptosystem]], in a group <math>G</math>, if the public key is <math>(G, q, g, h)</math>, where <math>h = g^x</math>, and <math>x</math> is the secret key, then the encryption of a message <math>m</math> is <math>\mathcal{E}(m) = (g^r,m\cdot h^r)</math>, for some <math>r \in \{0, \ldots, q-1\}</math>. The homomorphic property is then :<math>\mathcal{E}(x_1) \cdot \mathcal{E}(x_2) = (g^{r_1},x_1\cdot h^{r_1})(g^{r_2},x_2 \cdot h^{r_2}) = (g^{r_1+r_2},(x_1\cdot x_2) h^{r_1+r_2}) = \mathcal{E}(x_1 \cdot x_2)</math> ===Goldwasser-Micali=== In the [[Goldwasser-Micali cryptosystem]], if the public key is the modulus ''m'' and quadratic non-residue ''x'', then the encryption of a bit ''b'' is <math>\mathcal{E}(b) = r^2 x^b \mod m</math>. The homomorphic property is then :<math>\mathcal{E}(b_1)\cdot \mathcal{E}(b_2) = r_1^2 x^{b_1} r_2^2 x^{b_2} = (r_1r_2)^2 x^{b_1+b_2} = \mathcal{E}(b_1 \oplus b_2)</math> where <math>\oplus</math> denotes addition modulo 2, (i.e. [[Exclusive disjunction|exclusive-or]]). ===Benaloh=== In the [[Benaloh cryptosystem]], if the public key is the modulus ''m'' and the base ''g'' with a blocksize of ''r'', then the encryption of a message ''x'' is <math>g^x u^r \mod m</math>. The homomorphic property is then <math>\mathcal{E}(x_1) \cdot \mathcal{E}(x_2) = (g^{x_1} u_1^r)(g^{x_2} u_2^r) = g^{x_1+x_2} (u_1u_2)^r = \mathcal{E}(x_1 + x_2 \mod r )</math> ===Paillier=== In the [[Paillier cryptosystem]], if the public key is the modulus ''m'' and the base ''g'', then the encryption of a message ''x'' is <math>\mathcal{E}(x) = g^x r^m \mod m^2</math>. The homomorphic property is then :<math>\mathcal{E}(x_1) \cdot \mathcal{E}(x_2) = (g^{x_1} r_1^m)(g^{x_2} r_2^m) = g^{x_1+x_2} (r_1r_2)^m = \mathcal{E}( x_1 + x_2 \mod m)</math> ===Other partially homomorphic cryptosystems=== *[[Okamoto–Uchiyama cryptosystem]] *[[Naccache–Stern cryptosystem]] *[[Damgård–Jurik cryptosystem]] *[[Boneh–Goh–Nissim cryptosystem]] ==Fully homomorphic encryption== Each of the examples listed above allows homomorphic computation of only one operation (either addition or multiplication) on plaintexts. A cryptosystem which supports both addition and multiplication (thereby preserving the [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] structure of the plaintexts) would be far more powerful. Using such a scheme, any circuit could be homomorphically evaluated, effectively allowing the construction of programs which may be run on encryptions of their inputs to produce an encryption of their output. Since such a program never decrypts its input, it could be run by an untrusted party without revealing its inputs and internal state. The existence of an efficient and fully homomorphic cryptosystem would have great practical implications in the outsourcing of private computations, for instance, in the context of [[cloud computing]].<ref>{{cite web |title=A First Glimpse of Cryptography's Holy Grail |author=Daniele Micciancio |url=http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/3/76275-a-first-glimpse-of-cryptographys-holy-grail/fulltext |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] |date=2010-03-01 |page=96 |accessdate=2010-03-17 }}</ref> The "homomorphic" part of a fully homomorphic encryption scheme can also be described in terms of [[category theory]]. If ''C'' is the [[Category_(mathematics)|category]] whose objects are integers (i.e., finite streams of data) and whose morphisms are [[Computable_function|computable functions]], then (ideally) a fully homomorphic encryption scheme elevates an encryption function to a [[functor]] from ''C'' to itself. The utility of fully homomorphic encryption has been long recognized. The problem of constructing such a scheme was first proposed within a year of the development of RSA.<ref>R. L. Rivest, L.
