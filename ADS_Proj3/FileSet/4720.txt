The w denotes the number of tokens in each shingle in the set. The document, "a rose is a rose is a rose" can be [[tokenization|tokenized]] as follows: :(a,rose,is,a,rose,is,a,rose) The set of all contiguous sequences of 4 tokens ([[N-gram]]s, here: 4-grams) is :{ (a,rose,is,a), (rose,is,a,rose), (is,a,rose,is), (a,rose,is,a), (rose,is,a,rose) } By removing duplicate elements from this set, a 4-shingling is obtained: :{ (a,rose,is,a), (rose,is,a,rose), (is,a,rose,is) } == Resemblance == For a given shingle size, the degree to which two documents ''A'' and ''B'' resemble each other can be expressed as the ratio of the magnitudes of their shinglings' [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] and [[union (set theory)|union]], or :<math>r(A,B)={{|S(A)\cap S(B)|}\over {|S(A)\cup S(B)|}}</math> where |A| is the size of set A. The resemblance is a number in the range [0,1], where 1 indicates that two documents are identical. This definition is identical with the [[Jaccard coefficient]] describing similarity and diversity of sample sets. == See also == *[[Concept mining]] offers an alternative method for document similarity calculation with more computational complexity, but where the measure more closely models a human's perception of document similarity. *[[N-gram]] == References == *(Manber 1993) ''Finding Similar Files in a Large File System''.

It is actually a combination of the runtime and a [[web service]] through which the services are exposed. In addition, it also includes the '''Data Services Toolkit''' which lets Astoria Data Services be created from within [[ASP.NET]] itself. The Astoria project was announced at [[MIX (Microsoft)|MIX]] 2007, and the first developer preview was made available on April 30, 2007. The first [[CTP]] was made available as a part of the [[ASP.NET]] 3.5 Extensions Preview. The final version was released as part of [[Service Pack]] 1 of the [[.NET Framework 3.5]] on August 11, 2008. The name change from ADO.NET Data Services to WCF data Services was announced at the 2009 [[Professional Developers Conference|PDC]]. ==Overview== ADO.NET Data Services exposes data, represented as [[ADO.NET#Entity Framework|Entity Data Model]] (EDM) objects, via web services accessed over [[HTTP]]. The data can be addressed using a [[Representational State Transfer|REST]]-like [[URI]]. The Astoria service, when accessed via the HTTP GET method with such a URI, will return the data. The web service can be configured to return the data in either plain [[XML]], [[JSON]] or [[Resource Description Framework|RDF+XML]]. In the initial release, formats like [[RSS]] and [[ATOM]] are not supported, though they may be in the future. In addition, using other HTTP methods like PUT, POST or DELETE, the
