The metric space which most closely corresponds to our intuitive understanding of space is the 3-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. In fact, the notion of "metric" is a generalization of the [[Euclidean metric]] arising from the four long-known properties of the Euclidean distance. The Euclidean metric defines the distance between two points as the length of the [[Straight line|straight]] [[line segment]] connecting them. The [[geometric properties]] of the space depend on the metric chosen, and by using a different metric we can construct interesting [[non-Euclidean geometries]] such as those used in the theory of [[general relativity]]. A metric space also induces [[topological properties]] like [[open set|open]] and [[closed set]]s which leads to the study of even more abstract [[topological space]]s. == History == [[Maurice Fréchet]] introduced metric spaces in his work ''Sur quelques points du calcul fonctionnel'', Rendic. Circ. Mat. Palermo 22 (1906) 1–74. == Definition == A '''metric space''' is an [[ordered pair]] <math>(M,d)</math> where <math>M</math> is a [[empty set|non-empty]] set and <math>d</math> is a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] on <math>M</math>, i.e., a function :<math>d : M \times M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}</math> such that for any <math>x, y, z \in M</math>, the following holds: # <math>d(x,y) \ge 0</math> (''non-negativity'') , # <math>d(x,y) = 0</math> [[if and only if|iff]] <math>x = y</math> (''[[identity of indiscernibles]]'') , # <math>d(x,y) = d(y,x)</math> (''symmetry'') and # <math>d(x,z) \le d(x,y) + d(y,z)</math> (''[[triangle inequality]]'') . The first condition follows from the other three, since: : <math>2d(x,y) = d(x,y) + d(y,x) \ge d(x,x) = 0.</math> The function <math>d</math> is also called ''distance function'' or simply ''distance''. Often, <math>d</math> is omitted and one just writes <math>M</math> for a metric space if it is clear from the context what metric is used. == Examples of metric spaces == <!-- [[Finite Metric space]] redirects here--> * Ignoring mathematical details, for any system of roads and terrains the distance between two locations can be defined as the length of the shortest route connecting those locations. To be a metric there shouldn't be any one-way roads. The triangle inequality expresses the fact that detours aren't shortcuts. Many of the examples below can be seen as concrete versions of this general idea. * The [[real number]]s with the distance function <math>d(x,y) = \vert y - x \vert</math> given by the [[absolute difference]], and more generally [[Euclidean space|Euclidean <math>n</math>-space]] with the [[Euclidean distance]], are [[complete space|complete]] metric spaces. The [[rational number]]s with the same distance also form a metric space, but are not complete. * Any [[normed vector space]] is a metric space by defining <math>d(x,y) = \lVert y - x \rVert</math>, see also {{ml|Metric_%28mathematics%29|Relation_of_norms_and_metrics|relation of norms and metrics}}. (If such a space is complete, we call it a
