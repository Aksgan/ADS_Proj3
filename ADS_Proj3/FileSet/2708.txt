"LunarStorm" is operated by a company called LunarWorks. According to the company's official statistics, the website had 1.2 million members in 2007, of whom some 70% are 12–17 years old.<ref name=statistik /> The website has since 2007 drastically dropped in popularity and in June 2010, Wyatt Media Groups (current owner of LunarStorm) announced that LunarStorm will be shutdown 18th August due to lack of activity. ==History== The predecessor to Lunarstorm was called "StajlPlejs" (i.e. "Style Place" transcribed to Swedish spelling), which started around 1996. It was created by Rickard Ericsson<ref name=ne /> as Europe's first digital online community. Lunarstorm officially opened on January 1, 2000, after Lunarworks had taken over StajlPlejs and decided to rename it after the user name used at the website by Rickard Ericssons girlfriend. In 2001, LunarStorm had grown to over 600 000 members but still experienced economic hardships. Since the beginning, LunarStorm had been financed by banners and other advertising on the website, but this soon evolved to include more of pay-by-SMS services. An early example was LunarStorm's own pre-paid card "Vrål" ("Bawl"). In 2002, "Kolla" ("Look" or "Check this out") was introduced which allowed users to visit LunarStorm from their mobile phones. In the same year, members were able to upgrade their membership to "pro" status and get unlimited access to a range of services for a fee. LunarStorm Pro was extremely popular among the member base and it improved the website's economic situation greatly. Another great source of revenue was LunarStorm's cooperation with other companies. An early business partner was [[OLW]] who sponsored "RajRaj", a party-oriented photo album ("RajRaj" being Swedish slang for party). But LunarStorm has through the years also cooperated with numerous other companies including [[Arla]], [[EA Games]], [[Loka]], [[McDonald's]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Aftonbladet]], [[Sveriges Radio]] and [[Logitech]]. In September 2006, the website style was changed. The change had already been introduced at the British sister site a few months earlier (May - June). In February 2007 LunarWorks bought 40 percent of the shares in [[Bilddagboken]], an increasingly big competitor to LunarStorm. At the same time, LunarStorm replaced the "Kollage" service which allowed you to upload images for a fee with the free "Gallery", to compete with Bilddagbokens free picture upload functions. Eight months later, on October 4th 2007, the owners of LunarStorm announced that they had bought the remaining shares of Bilddagboken, as well as 57 percent of the online Swedish-English dictionary [[Tyda.se]]. LunarStorm, Bilddagboken and Tyda.se are now parts of [[Wyatt Media Group]], owned by Sten Mörtstedt. Both the [[Denmark|Danish]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] branches of the website were closed down on July 13, 2007. On December 13th 2007, LunarStorm removed "Pro" from the website and made all the content free. Focus was instead put on a new function called "Club Lunar" where members got access to "exclusive offers" and "cool competitions". Lately, the popularity og LunarStorm has dramatically decreased which the owners explain with an increased competition from other social networking sites for young people in Sweden such as Bilddagboken. For example, the daily question that used to be answered by about 150 000 members per day and was used by polling institutes to study opinions of Swedish youth has now shrunk to about 10 000 - 12 000 daily answers, as of summer 2009. The number of users concurrently online has gone from about 100 000 to only 1500 as of 2009. ==References== {{reflist|refs= <ref name=ne>{{cite encyclopedia | title=Lunarstorm | encyclopedia=[[Nationalencyklopedin]] | language=Swedish | url=http://www.ne.se/lunarstorm | accessdate=31 July 2010}} {{subscription required}}</ref> <ref name=statistik>{{cite web | title=Statistik | url=http://www.lunarworks.se/_fil/prodblad/lunarstorm_statistik_q1.pdf | publisher=Lunarstorm | language=Swedish | accessdate=31 July 2010}}</ref> }} ==External links== *[http://www.lunarstorm.se LunarStorm.se] *{{Wayback|url=http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.lunarstorm.se/|title=LunarStorm}} [[Category:Community websites]] [[Category:Swedish society]] [[Category:Social network services]] [[Category:Virtual communities]] [[Category:Internet in Sweden]] [[Category:Swedish websites]] [[Category:Internet properties established in 2000]] [[Category:Internet properties disestablished in 2010]] {{Website-stub}} [[da:LunarStorm]] [[de:LunarStorm]] [[pl:Epuls]] [[sv:Lunarstorm]]</text> </page> <page> <id>22767</id> <title>Lunar eclipse</title> <text>{{other uses}} [[File:Near Greatest Eclipse 20101221 0011-crop.jpg|280px|thumb|The most [[December 2010 lunar eclipse|recent total lunar eclipse]] was on December 21, 2010, seen here from [[California]] near greatest eclipse.]] [[File:Geometry of a Lunar Eclipse.svg|thumb|280px|thumb|Schematic diagram of the shadow cast by the Earth.

When the full moon occurs in the same position at the node, a lunar eclipse can occur. These two nodes allow two to five eclipses per year, parted by approximately six months. (Note: Not drawn to scale. The Sun is much larger and farther away than the Moon.)]] [[File:Penumbral lunar eclipse 1999 jan 31.png|thumb|280px|A [[total penumbral lunar eclipse]] dims the moon in direct proportion to the area of the sun’s disk blocked by the earth.

As the diagram illustrates, the type of lunar eclipse is defined by the path taken by the Moon as it passes through Earth’s shadow.
