There are three points marked with a dot: A blue dot at a node of the carrier wave, a green dot at the maximum of the envelope, and a red dot at the front of the envelope.]] The phase velocity is important in determining how a light wave travels through a material or from one material to another. It is often represented in terms of a ''refractive index''. The refractive index of a material is defined as the ratio of ''c'' to the phase velocity ''v''<sub>p</sub> in the material: larger indices of refraction indicate lower speeds. The refractive index of a material may depend on the light's frequency, intensity, [[polarization (waves)|polarization]], or direction of propagation; in many cases, though, it can be treated as a material-dependent constant. The [[refractive index of air]] is approximately 1.0003.<ref name=Podesta>{{Cite book |last=de Podesta |first=M |year=2002 |title=Understanding the Properties of Matter |url=http://books.google.com/?id=h8BNvnR050cC&pg=PA131&lpg=PA131 |page=131 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=0415257883 }}</ref> Denser media, such as [[Optical properties of water and ice|water]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Refractive index of Water, H20 [Liquids] |url=http://refractiveindex.info/?group=LIQUIDS&material=Water |publisher=Mikhail Polyanskiy |work=refractiveindex.info |accessed=14-3-2010 }}</ref> glass,<ref>{{cite web |title=Refractive index of Fused Silica [Glasses] |url=http://refractiveindex.info/?group=GLASSES&material=F_SILICA |publisher=Mikhail Polyanskiy |work=refractiveindex.info |accessed=14-3-2010 }}</ref> and [[Material properties of diamond#Optical properties|diamond]],<!--there must be a way to make it clearer where these links go--><ref> {{cite web |title=Refractive index of C [Crystals etc.] |url=http://refractiveindex.info/?group=CRYSTALS&material=C |publisher=Mikhail Polyanskiy |work=refractiveindex.info |accessed=14-3-2010 }}</ref> have refractive indexes of around 1.3, 1.5 and 2.4 respectively for visible light. In transparent materials, the refractive index generally is greater than 1, meaning that the phase velocity is less than ''c''.

A pulse with different group and phase velocities (which occurs if the phase velocity is not the same for all the frequencies of the pulse) smears out over time, a process known as [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]].
