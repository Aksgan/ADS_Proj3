offers you a deal: if you squeal on your associate &ndash; which will result in his getting a five year stretch &ndash; the prosecutor will see that six months is taken off of your sentence. Which sounds good, until you learn your associate is being offered the same deal &ndash; which would get ''you'' five years. So what do you do? The best that you and your associate can do together is to not squeal: that is, to cooperate (with each other, not the prosecutor!) in a mutual bond of silence, and do your year. But wait: if your associate cooperates (that sucker!), can you do better by squealing ("defecting") to get that six month reduction? It's tempting, but then he's also tempted. And if you both squeal, oh, no, it's four and half years each. So perhaps you should cooperate &ndash; but wait, that's being a sucker yourself, as your associate will undoubtedly defect, and you won't even get the six months off. So what is the best strategy to minimize your incarceration (aside from going straight in the first place)? To cooperate, or not cooperate? This simple question (and the implicit question of whether to trust, or not), expressed in an extremely simple game, is a crucial issue across a broad range of life. Why shouldn't a shark eat the little fish that has just cleaned it of parasites: in any given exchange who would know? Fig wasps collectively limit the eggs they lay in fig trees (otherwise, the trees would suffer). But why shouldn't any one fig wasp cheat and leave a few more eggs than her rivals? At the level of human society, why shouldn't each of the villagers that share a common but finite resource try to exploit it more than the others?<ref>See {{Harvtxt|Hardin|1968}}, "[[The Tragedy of the Commons]]".</ref> At the core of these and myriad other examples is a conflict formally equivalent to the Prisoner's Dilemma. Yet sharks, fig wasps, and villagers all cooperate. It has been a vexatious problem in evolutionary studies to explain how such cooperation should evolve, let alone persist, in a world of self-maximizing egoists. == Darwinian context == [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of how [[evolution]] works ("By Means of [[Natural Selection]]"<ref>"By Means of Natural Selection" being the subtitle of his work, [[On the Origin of Species]].</ref>) is explicitly competitive ("[[survival of the fittest]]"), [[Malthusian]] ("struggle for existence"), even gladiatorial ("[[nature, red in tooth and claw]]"). Species are pitted against species for shared resources, similar species with similar needs and niches even more so, and individuals within species most of all.<ref>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859}}, pp 75, 76, 320.</ref> All this comes down to one factor: out-competing all rivals and predators in producing progeny. Darwin's explanation of how preferential survival of the slightest benefits can lead to advanced forms is the most important explanatory principle in biology, and extremely powerful in many other fields. Such success has reinforced notions that life is in all respects a war of each against all, where every ''individual'' has to look out for himself, that your gain is my loss. In such a struggle for existence [[altruism]] (voluntarily yielding a benefit to a non-relative) and even cooperation (working with another for a mutual benefit) seem so antithetical to self-interest as to be the very kind of behavior that should be selected against. Yet cooperation and seemingly even altruism have evolved and persist, and naturalists have been hard pressed to explain why. == Social Darwinism == The popularity of the evolution of cooperation &ndash; the reason it is not an obscure technical issue of interest to only a small number of specialists &ndash; is in part because it mirrors a larger issue where the realms of political philosophy, ethics, and biology intersect: the ancient issue of individual interests versus group interests. On one hand, the so-called "[[Social Darwinism|Social Darwinians]]" (roughly, those who would use the "survival of the fittest" of Darwinian evolution to justify the cutthroat competitiveness of [[laissez-faire]] capitalism<ref> {{Harvnb|Bowler|1984|pp=94–99, 269–70}}. </ref>) declaim that the world is an inherently competitive "dog eat dog" jungle, where every ''individual'' has to look out for himself. The philosopher [[Ayn Rand]] damned "[[altruism]]" and declared selfishness a virtue.<ref> {{Harvnb|Rand|1961}}. </ref> The Social Darwinists' view is derived from [[Charles Darwin]]'s interpretation of evolution by [[natural selection]], which is explicitly competitive ("survival of the fittest"), [[Malthusian]] ("struggle for existence"), even gladiatorial ("red in tooth and claw"), and permeated by the Victorian laissez-faire ethos of Darwin and his disciples (such as [[T. H. Huxley]] and [[Herbert Spencer]]). What they read into the theory was then read out by Social Darwinians as scientific justification for their social and economic views (such as poverty being a natural condition and social reform an unnatural meddling).<ref> {{Harvnb|Bowler|1984|pp=94–99}} </ref> Such views of evolution, competition, and the survival of the fittest are explicit in the ethos of modern [[capitalism]], as epitomized by industrialist [[Andrew Carnegie]] in ''[[The Gospel of Wealth]]'': <blockquote> [W]hile the law [of competition] may be sometimes hard for the individual, it is best for the race, because it ensures the survival of the fittest in every department. We accept and welcome, therefore, as conditions to which we must accommodate ourselves, great inequality of environment; the concentration of business, industrial and commercial, in the hands of the few; and the law of competition between these, as being not only beneficial, but essential to the future progress of the race. {{Harv|Carnegie|1900}} </blockquote> While the validity of extrapolating moral and political views from science is questionable, the significance of such views in modern society is undoubtable. == The Social Contract and morality == On the other hand, other philosophers have long observed that cooperation in the form of a "[[social contract]]" is necessary for human society, but saw no way of attaining that short of a coercive authority. As [[Thomas Hobbes]] wrote in [[Leviathan (book)|''Leviathan'']]: <blockquote> [T]here must be some coercive power to compel men equally to the performance of their covenants by the terror of some punishment greater than the benefit
