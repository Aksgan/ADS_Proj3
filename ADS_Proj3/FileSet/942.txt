[[Image:CoqProofOfDecidablityOfEqualityOnNaturalNumbers.png|thumb|300px|An interactive proof session in CoqIDE, showing the proof script on the left and the proof state on the right.]] In [[computer science]], '''Coq''' is an [[Interactive theorem proving|interactive theorem prover]]. It allows the expression of [[mathematics|mathematical]] assertions, mechanically checks proofs of these assertions, helps to find formal proofs, and extracts a certified program from the [[constructive proof]] of its formal specification. Coq works within the theory of the [[calculus of inductive constructions]], a derivative of the [[calculus of constructions]]. Coq is not an automated [[theorem prover]] but includes automatic theorem proving [[tactic (theorem proving)|tactic]]s and various decision procedures. Coq implements a [[dependent types|dependently typed]] [[functional programming language]].<ref>[http://coq.inria.fr/a-short-introduction-to-coq A short introduction to Coq].</ref> It is developed in [[France]], in the [http://typical.inria.fr/ TypiCal] (ex-LogiCal) project, jointly operated by [[INRIA]], [[École Polytechnique]], [[Paris-Sud 11 University]] and [[CNRS]]. There was also formerly a group at [[École Normale Supérieure de Lyon]]. The team leader is Senior Scientist [[Benjamin Werner]]. Coq is implemented in [[Objective Caml]]. The word ''coq'' means "[[rooster|cock]]" (rooster) in [[French language|French]], and stems from a tradition of naming French research development tools with animal names. It is also a reference to [[Thierry Coquand]], who developed the aforementioned calculus of constructions along with [[Gérard Huet]]. Also, at first it was simply called Coc, the acronym of calculus of construction. == Four color theorem and ssreflect extension == [[Georges Gonthier]] (of [[Microsoft Research]], in [[Cambridge]], [[England]]) and [[Benjamin Werner]] (of [[INRIA]]) used Coq to create a surveyable proof of the [[four color theorem]], which was completed in September 2004.<ref>[http://www.inria.fr/rapportsactivite/RA2004/logical2004/uid40.html Development of theories and tactics: Four Color Theorem]</ref> Based on this work, a significant extension to Coq was developed called Ssreflect (which stands for "small scale reflection"). Despite the name, most of the new features added to Coq by Ssreflect are general purpose features, useful not merely for the computational reflection style of proof. These include: * Additional convenient notations for irrefutable and refutable pattern matching, on inductive types with one or two constructors * Implicit arguments for functions applied to zero arguments - which is useful when programming with higher-order functions * Concise anonymous arguments * An improved <code>set</code> tactic with more powerful matching * Support for reflection Ssreflect 1.2 is freely available under the open source [[CeCill-B]] license, and is compatible with Coq 8.2pl1.<ref>[http://www.msr-inria.inria.fr/Projects/math-components/index_html#download Download the Ssreflect extension for the Coq system]</ref> ==See also== *[[Curry-Howard]] *[[Intuitionistic type theory]] *[[Compcert]] an optimizing compiler for [[C (programming language)]] which is fully programmed and proved in Coq. ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== *[http://coq.inria.fr/ The Coq proof assistant] - the official English website *[http://logical.saclay.inria.fr/cocorico/ Cocorico!, the Coq Wiki] *[http://www.msr-inria.inria.fr/Projects/math-components MSR Inria math components] - hosts the Ssreflect extension *[http://www.labri.fr/perso/casteran/CoqArt/index.html The Coq'Art] - A book on Coq by Yves Bertot and Pierre Castéran *[http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/ Certified Programming with Dependent Types] -- online draft textbook by Adam Chlipala *{{ohloh|coq|Coq}} [[Category:Interactive theorem proving software]] [[Category:Free theorem provers]] [[Category:Dependently typed formal languages]] [[Category:OCaml software]] [[Category:Functional languages]] [[Category:Programming languages created in the 20th century]] [[de:Coq (Software)]] [[el:Coq]] [[es:Coq]] [[fr:Coq (logiciel)]] [[ru:Coq]]</text> </page> <page> <id>8155</id> <title>Coral Consortium</title> <text>The '''Coral Consortium''' was founded in Fall 2004 by [[Hewlett-Packard]] Corporation, [[Intertrust]] Technologies Corporation, Koninklijke [[Philips]] Electronics N.V., [[Matsushita]] Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.

A device used by a family member wishing to play a music file that is stored on another family-owned device can use Coral to obtain a new copy (or license) in the correct format, with the Coral infrastructure managing the necessary permissions and translation of rights to the new device. In theory this should greatly ease the portability of protected media files between devices. == Additional Information == Much of the Coral documentation requires the reader to agree to legal conditions, so it is not very easy for most members of the public to examine the proposals. However there is a fairly full FAQ document available ([http://www.coral-interop.org/main/faqs/Coral_FAQ.pdf Coral Consortium FAQ Document]). == Possible Limitations == While Coral is a novel approach to DRM interoperability, doubts have been raised in some quarters as to whether it is really suitable for all media types. * The approach of obtaining a second file protected under the second DRM system assumes that such a file is available, and also assumes that both DRM vendors (and service providers) will cooperate with Coral. At the time of writing, Apple is not a Coral member company. * The Coral membership leans heavily to music companies; other content types (e.g. video, TV, games) are not so strongly represented. * The bandwidth requirements (and download delay) for obtaining a second copy of a large file such as an HD TV broadcast are considerable. * Some Europeans have expressed concerns over consumer privacy and anonymity, if all such content moves involve a "phone home" to a Coral service in the cloud. == References == {{reflist}} == External links == *[http://www.coral-interop.org/ Coral Consortium - Official Website] [[Category:Digital rights management]] [[Category:International organizations]]</text> </page> <page> <id>8182</id> <title>Core dump</title> <text>[[Image:Magnetic core.jpg|right|thumb|250|A core dump gets its name from an old memory technology using tiny magnetic cores, shown here at 50x magnification.]] In [[computing]], a '''core dump''', more properly a memory dump or storage dump, consists of the recorded state of the working
