The applications of percolation theory to [[materials science]] and other domains are discussed in the article [[percolation]]. ==Introduction== A representative question (and the [[etymology|source]] of the name) is as follows. Assume that some liquid is poured on top of some [[porosity|porous]] material. Will the liquid be able to make its way from hole to hole and reach the bottom? This physical question is [[mathematical model|modeled]] mathematically as a three-dimensional network of ''n'' &times; ''n'' &times; ''n'' points (or [[graph (mathematics)|vertices]]/sites) the connections (or [[graph (mathematics)|edge]]s/bonds) between each two neighbors may be open (allowing the liquid through) with probability ''p'', or closed with probability 1 – ''p'', and they are assumed to be independent. Therefore, for a given ''p'', what is the probability that an open path exists from the top to the bottom? The behavior for large ''n'' is of primary interest. This problem was introduced in the mathematics literature by {{harvtxt|Broadbent|Hammersley|1957}}, and has been studied intensively by mathematicians and physicists since. As is quite typical, it is actually easier to examine [[Infinite graph|infinite]] networks than just large ones. In this case the corresponding question is: does an infinite open cluster exist? That is, is there a path of connected points of infinite length "through" the network? By [[Kolmogorov's zero-one law]], for any given ''p'', the probability that an infinite cluster exists is either zero or one. Since this probability is an increasing function of ''p'' (this is intuitively obvious, but mathematicians need a [[Coupling (probability)|coupling]] argument to prove it), there must be a '''critical''' ''p'' (denoted by ''p''<sub>c</sub>) below which the probability is always 0 and above which the probability is always 1. In practice, this criticality is very easy to observe. Even for ''n'' as small as 100, the probability of an open path from the top to the bottom increases sharply from very close to zero to very close to one in a short span of values of ''p''. [[Image:Bond percolation p 51.png|thumb|Detail of a bond percolation on the square lattice in two dimensions with percolation probability ''p'' = 0.51]] In some cases ''p''<sub>c</sub> may be calculated explicitly. For example, for the [[square lattice]] '''Z'''<sup>2</sup> in two dimensions, ''p''<sub>c</sub> = 1/2, a fact which was an open question for more than 20 years and was finally resolved by [[Harry Kesten]] in the early 1980s, see {{harvtxt|Kesten|1982}}. A limit case for lattices in many dimensions is given by the [[Bethe lattice]], whose threshold is at ''p''<sub>c</sub> = 1/(''z'' &minus; 1) for a [[coordination number]] ''z''. For most infinite graphs, ''p''<sub>c</sub> cannot be calculated. For example, ''p''<sub>c</sub> is not known for the [[hypercubic]] lattice in three dimensions. However, it turns out that calculating ''p''<sub>c</sub> is not necessarily the most interesting thing to do. The [[Universality (dynamical systems)|universality principle]] states that the value of ''p''<sub>c</sub> is connected to the local structure of the graph, while the behavior of open clusters below, at, and above ''p''<sub>c</sub> are invariant with respect to the local structure, and therefore, in some sense are more natural quantities to consider. Sometimes it is easier to open and close vertices rather than edges. This is called [[site percolation]] while the model described above is more properly called [[bond percolation]]. == Phases == ===Subcritical and supercritical=== The main fact in the subcritical phase is "exponential decay". That is, when ''p'' < ''p''<sub>c</sub>, the probability that a specific point (for example, the origin) is contained in an open cluster of size ''r'' decays to zero [[Big O notation#Common orders of functions|exponentially]] in ''r''. This was proved for percolation in three and more dimensions by {{harvtxt|Menshikov|1986}} and independently by {{harvtxt|Aizenman|Barsky|1987}}. In two dimensions, it formed part of Kesten's proof that ''p''<sub>c</sub> = 1/2. The [[dual graph]] of the square lattice '''Z'''<sup>2</sup> is also the square lattice. It follows that, in two dimensions, the supercritical phase is dual to a subcritical percolation process. This provides essentially full information about the supercritical model with ''d'' = 2. The main result for the supercritical phase in three and more dimensions is that, for sufficiently large ''N'', there is an infinite open cluster in the two-dimensional slab '''Z'''<sup>2</sup> &times; [0, ''N'']<sup>''d''&minus;2</sup>. This was proved by {{harvtxt|Grimmett|Marstrand|1990}}. In two dimensions with ''p'' < 1/2, there is with probability one a unique infinite closed cluster. Thus the subcritical phase may be described as finite open islands in an infinite closed ocean. When ''p'' > 1/2 just the opposite occurs, with finite closed islands in an infinite open ocean. The picture is more complicated when ''d'' ≥ 3 since ''p''<sub>c</sub> < 1/2, and there is coexistence of infinite open and closed clusters for ''p'' between ''p''<sub>c</sub> and 1 &minus; ''p''<sub>c</sub>. ===Critical === The model has a [[mathematical singularity|singularity]] at the critical point ''p'' = ''p''<sub>c</sub> believed to be of power-law type. [[Critical scaling|Scaling theory]] predicts the existence of [[critical exponents]], depending on the number ''d'' of dimensions, that determine the class of the singularity. When ''d'' = 2 these
