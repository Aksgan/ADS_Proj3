It allows one to compose and store blog entries on the local desktop computer, then upload them to a weblog host. ecto interacts with popular server software such as [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]], [[Moveable Type]], and [[Wordpress]], among others. The developer believes the additional flexibility of the desktop operating system allows the client to incorporate features lacking in web-based clients.<ref>[http://infinite-sushi.com/software/ecto/ Software website]</ref> For example, ecto incorporates spell checking, easy insertion of images, and text formatting. ecto employs the standard controls the operating system provides to all applications. It can also [[trackback]] to other blogs and add categories and tags to a blog entry. The Macintosh version integrates with [[iTunes]] and [[iPhoto]]. ==Critical reception== AppleMatters gave ecto 9 out of 10.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.applematters.com/article/ecto-blogging-software-v-21/ |title= Ecto Blogging Software v. 2.1 |accessdate= 2008-07-12 |author= Chris Howard |date= 2006-05-12 |publisher= Apple Matters }}</ref> The Windows variant of ecto was reviewed at ''Reviewsaurus'', which despite noting ecto as one of the most respected blogging clients, gave it a more critical review for its lack of a single pane interface, and lack of FTP support.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reviewsaurus.com/software-reviews/review-of-ecto-for-windows-blogging-application/ |title=Review of Ecto for Windows - Blogging application! |date=2006-12-21 |publisher=Reviewsaurus |accessdate=2008-12-10}}</ref> ''New Communications Review'' provided a more favorable review ("4 stars out of 5") praising its feature set and the detailed control it gives over formatting one's posts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newcommreview.com/?p=71 |title=Managing Your Blog Content - BlogJet and ecto Reviewed |last=Hobson|first=Neville |date=2005-04-18 |publisher=New Communications Review |accessdate=2008-12-10}}</ref> ==References== {{reflist}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Ecto}} [[Category:Mac OS software]] {{Mac-software-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>11667</id> <title>Edgar F.

He made other valuable contributions to [[computer science]], but the relational model, a very influential general theory of data management, remains his most mentioned achievement. == Biography== Edgar Frank Codd was born on the [[Isle of Portland]] in [[England]]. After attending [[Poole Grammar School]], he studied [[mathematics]] and [[chemistry]] at [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter College]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]], before serving as a pilot in the [[Royal Air Force]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. In 1948, he moved to [[New York]] to work for IBM as a mathematical [[programmer]]. In 1953, angered by Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]], Codd moved to [[Ottawa]], [[Canada]]. A decade later he returned to the [[United States|U.S.]] and received his doctorate in computer science from the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]]. Two years later he moved to [[San Jose, California]], to work at [[IBM]]'s [[Almaden Research Center|San Jose Research Laboratory]], where he continued to work until the 1980s. During the 1990s, his health deteriorated and he ceased work.<ref>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/edgar-codd-730256.html Edgar Codd's obituary in The Independent</ref> Codd received the [[Turing Award]] in 1981, and in 1994 he was inducted as a Fellow of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]].<ref>[http://fellows.acm.org/homepage.cfm?alpha=C&srt=alpha ACM Fellows]</ref> Codd died of [[heart failure]] at his home in [[Williams Island, Florida]], at the age of 79 on April 18, 2003.<ref name = "IBM">[http://www.research.ibm.com/resources/news/20030423_edgarpassaway.shtml Edgar F Codd Passes Away], IBM Research, 2003 Apr 23.</ref> == Work == In the 1960s and 1970s he worked out his theories of data arrangement, issuing his paper "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks" in 1970, after an internal IBM paper one year earlier.<ref>Michael Owens. The Definitive Guide to SQLite, p.47. New York: Apress (Springer-Verlag) 2006. ISBN 978-1-59059-673-9.</ref> To his disappointment, IBM proved slow to exploit his suggestions until commercial rivals started implementing them. Initially, IBM refused to implement the relational model in order to preserve revenue from [[IMS/DB]]. Codd then showed IBM customers the potential of the implementation of its model, and they in turn pressured IBM. Then IBM included in its [[IBM Future Systems project|Future Systems]] project a [[System R]] subproject — but put in charge of it developers who were not thoroughly familiar with Codd's ideas, and isolated the team from Codd{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}. As a result, they did not use Codd's own [[Alpha (language)|Alpha]] language but created a non-relational one, [[SEQUEL]]. Even so, [[SEQUEL]]
