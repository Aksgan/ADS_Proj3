implemented, as well. The overall idea is to add an Item in the Floating Menu coming with Right-Click on selected Blocks: If the selected Block contains only simple Instructions, add a Profile Code Option, which activation should return the Ticks number. The implementation should not be that hard, as an example of how to compile independent Instruction is already available in the Tools+Encoding Box feature. Problems: ecx loops must be under Control. Memory accesses must be under control. Api calls cannot be included. Jumps and Calls must be under control. Equates must be emulated. Macros must be refused. This feature is not for timing the running Application, but for timing the simple execution of one or several Opcodes, for users interested with Code Level Optimization. * Finishing the 2nd stage of the Library Scanner and starting the implementation of the digital DNA system to help the performance of the disassembly outputs. The developers are working to provide this tools as fast as possible, even if the actual staff contains a very limited amount of developers contributing to the whole package every day. == See also == {{Portal|Free software}} * [[NASM (computer program)|Netwide Assembler]] * [[FASM|Flat Assembler]] * [[GoAsm]] * [[Yasm]] == External links == {{Wikibooks|Assembly Language}} {{Wiktionary|assembly language}} {{Commons|RosAsm}} * [http://betov.free.fr/RosAsm.html RosAsm] Home site of the RosAsm Assembler/IDE * [http://www.quanta-it.com/RosForum Main RosAsm Forum] RosAsm Forum [[Category:Assemblers]] [[Category:Disassemblers]] [[Category:Debugging]] [[Category:Articles with example assembly language code]] [[es:RosAsm]] [[fr:RosAsm]] {{catimprove|date=October 2010}}</text> </page> <page> <id>32464</id> <title>Ross J.

He has also discovered weaknesses in the [[FISH (cipher)|FISH]] cipher and designed the stream cipher [[Pike (cipher)|Pike]].
