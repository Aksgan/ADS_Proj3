Handset layouts || The platform is adaptable to larger, [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]], [[2D computer graphics|2D graphics]] library, [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] library based on [[OpenGL ES]] 2.0 specifications, and traditional smartphone layouts. |- ! Storage | [[SQLite]], a lightweight [[relational database]], is used for data storage purposes |- ! Connectivity || Android supports connectivity technologies including [[GSM]]/[[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]], [[Integrated Digital Enhanced Network|IDEN]], [[Code division multiple access|CDMA]], [[Evolution-Data Optimized|EV-DO]], [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]], [[Bluetooth]], [[Wi-Fi]], [[LTE Advanced|LTE]], and [[WiMAX]]. |- ! Messaging || [[SMS]] and [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]] are available forms of messaging, including threaded [[text messaging]] and now Android Cloud to Device Messaging Framework ([[C2DM]]) is also a part of Android Push Messaging service. |- ! Web browser || The web browser available in Android is based on the open-source [[WebKit]] layout engine, coupled with [[Google Chrome|Chrome]]'s [[V8 (JavaScript engine)|V8]] JavaScript engine. The browser scores a 93/100 on the [[Acid3]] Test. |- ! Java support || While Android applications are written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], there's no [[Java Virtual Machine]] in the platform and Java byte code is not executed. Java classes get recompiled into [[Dalvik executable]] and run on [[Dalvik virtual machine]]. Dalvik is a specialized virtual machine designed specifically for Android and optimized for battery-powered mobile devices with limited memory and CPU. J2ME support can be provided via third-party-application such as the J2ME MIDP Runner.<ref>[http://www.netmite.com/android/ Android J2ME MIDP RUNNER homepage]</ref> |- ! Media support || Android supports the following audio/video/still media formats: [[WebM]], [[H.263]], [[H.264]] (in [[3GP]] or [[MP4]] [[container format (digital)|container]]), [[MPEG-4 Part 2|MPEG-4 SP]], [[Adaptive multi-rate compression|AMR]], [[AMR-WB]] (in 3GP container), [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]], [[HE-AAC]] (in MP4 or 3GP container), [[MP3]], [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]], [[Vorbis|Ogg Vorbis]], [[WAV]], [[JPEG]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]], [[BMP file format|BMP]].<ref name="mediaformats" /> |- ! Streaming media support || RTP/RTSP streaming (3GPP PSS, ISMA), HTML progressive download (HTML5 <video> tag). Adobe Flash Streaming (RTMP) is supported through Adobe Flash Player plugin. Apple HTTP Live Streaming is planned to be supported through stagefright media player. Microsoft Smooth Streaming is planned to be supported through the awaited port of Silverlight plugin to Android. Adobe Flash HTTP Dynamic Streaming is planned to be supported through an upgrade of the Flash plugin. |- ! Additional hardware support || Android can use video/still cameras, [[touchscreen]]s, [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], [[accelerometer]]s, [[gyroscope]]s, [[magnetometer]]s, [[proximity sensor|proximity]] and [[pressure sensor]]s, [[thermometer]]s, accelerated 2D [[bit blit]]s (with hardware orientation, scaling, pixel format conversion) and accelerated 3D graphics. |- ! Development environment || Includes a device emulator, tools for [[debugging]], memory and [[Software performance analysis|performance profiling]]. The [[integrated development environment]] (IDE) is Eclipse (currently 3.4 or 3.5) using the Android Development Tools (ADT) Plugin. |- ! Market || The [[Android Market]] is a catalog of applications that can be downloaded and installed to Android devices over-the-air, without the use of a PC. |- ! Multi-touch || Android has native support for [[multi-touch]] which was initially made available in handsets such as the [[HTC Hero]]. The feature was originally disabled at the kernel level (possibly to avoid infringing Apple's patents on touch-screen technology).<ref>{{cite news |url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-10161312-37.html |work = [[CNET News]] |title = Report: Apple nixed Android's multitouch |date = 11 February 2009 |first = Steven |last = Musil |accessdate = 2009-09-03}}</ref> Google has since released an update for the [[Nexus One]]
