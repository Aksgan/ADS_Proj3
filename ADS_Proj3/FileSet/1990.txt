'birth' & 'berth' and "told' & 'toll'd' (tolled) in his poem "Faithless Sally Brown": :His death, which happen'd in his berth, :At forty-odd befell: :They went and told the sexton, and :The sexton toll'd the bell. In some accents, various sounds have [[phonemic differentiation|merged]] in that they are no longer distinctive, and thus words that differ only by those sounds in an accent that maintains the distinction (a [[minimal pair]]) are homophonous in the accent with the merger. Some examples from [[English language|English]] are: :''pin'' and ''pen'' in many [[Southern American English|southern American accents]]. :''merry'', ''marry'', and ''Mary'' in most American accents. :The pairs ''do'', ''due'' and ''forward'', ''foreword'' are homophonous in most American accents but not in most British accents. :The pairs ''talk'', ''torque'', and ''court'', ''caught'' are distinguished in [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic]] accents such as [[Scottish English]] and most dialects of American English, but are homophones in many non-rhotic accents such as British [[Received Pronunciation]]. Homophones of multiple words or phrases (as sometimes seen in [[word game]]s) are also known as "[[oronym]]s". This term was coined by [[Gyles Brandreth]] and first published in his book ''The Joy of Lex'' (1980), and it was used in the [[BBC]] programme ''Never Mind the Full Stops'', which also featured Brandreth as a guest. Examples of "oronyms" (which may only be true homophones in certain dialects of English) include: :"ice cream" vs. "I scream" (as in the popular song "I scream. You scream. We all scream for ice cream.") :"euthanasia" vs. "[[Youth in Asia]]" :"depend" vs. "deep end" :"the sky" vs. "this guy" (most notably as a [[mondegreen]] in [[Purple Haze]] by [[Jimi Hendrix]]) :"four candles" vs. "fork handles" :"sand which is there" vs. "sandwiches there" :"example" vs. "egg sample" :"some others" vs. "some mothers" :"night rain" vs. "night train" :"minute" vs. "my newt" :"Long Island" vs. "lawn guy land" In his Appalachian comedy routine, American comedian [[Jeff Foxworthy]] frequently uses oronyms which play on exaggerated "country" accents. Notable examples include: :Initiate: "My wife ate two sandwiches, ''initiate'' [and then she ate] a bag o' tater chips."<br>Mayonnaise: "''Mayonnaise'' [Man, there is] a lot of people here tonight."<br>Innuendo: "Hey dude I saw a bird fly ''innuendo'' [in your window]."<br>Moustache: "I ''Moustache'' [must ask] you a question..." [[Malapropism]]s, which often create a similar comic effect, are usually near-homophones.

For example, groan/grone and crane/crain are pseudo-homophone pairs, whereas plane/plain is a homophone pair since both letter strings are recognised words. Both types of pairs are used in [[lexical decision task]]s to investigate [[word recognition]].<ref>Martin, R. C. (1982).

It is part of the Series 16 which includes the Models 116, 316, 416, 516 and 716. They were commonly used for data acquisition and control, remote message concentration, clinical laboratory systems and time-sharing. The Series 16 computers are all based on the DDP-116 designed by Gardner Hendrie at Computer Control Corporation (3C) in 1964. The H-316 was used by [[Charles H.
