After ''Kryptos'', however, he went on to make several other sculptures with codes and other types of writing, including one called ''[[Antipodes (sculpture)|Antipodes]]'' which is at the [[Hirshhorn Museum]] in Washington, D.C., an "Untitled Kryptos Piece" which was sold to a private collector, and a ''[[Cyrillic Projector]]'' with encrypted [[Cyrillic alphabet|Russian]] text, which included an extract from a classified [[KGB]] document. The cipher on one side of ''Antipodes'' repeats the text from CIA's ''Kryptos''. Much of the cipher on its Russian side is duplicated on the ''Cyrillic Projector''. The Russian portion of the cipher on the ''Cyrillic Projector'' and ''Antipodes'' was solved in 2003 after [[Elonka Dunin]] "led the charge",<ref>[http://www.elonka.com/mirrors/STL/sights.html Woman sets sights on code on CIA sculpture]</ref> with the [[ciphertext]] independently decrypted by Frank Corr and Mike Bales, and [[plaintext]] translation from Russian provided by Dunin.<ref>[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/vol302/issue5643/r-samples.dtl Cyrillic Riddle Solved] [[Science (journal)|Science]], vol 302, 10 Oct. 2003, page 224</ref> == Pop culture references == The dust jacket of the US version of [[Dan Brown]]'s novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' contains two references to ''Kryptos'': One on the back cover (coordinates printed light red on dark red, vertically next to the blurbs) is a reference to the coordinates mentioned in the plaintext of part 2 (see above), except the degrees digit is off by one. When Brown and his publisher were asked about this, they both gave the same reply: "The discrepancy is intentional." The other reference is hidden in the brown "tear" artwork&mdash;upside-down words which say "Only WW knows." These are another reference to Kryptos Part 2.<ref name="FAQ">[http://elonka.com/kryptos/faq.html FAQ About Kryptos]</ref> ''Kryptos'' is one of the themes in Dan Brown's 2009 novel, ''[[The Lost Symbol]]''.<ref name=secrets>''Secrets of the Lost Symbol'', pp.319&ndash;326</ref> A small version of ''Kryptos'' appears in the season 5 episode of ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'', "[[Alias episodes (Season 5)#S.O.S.|S.O.S.]]". In it, [[Marshall Flinkman]], in a small moment of comic relief, says he has cracked the code just by looking at it during a tour visit to the CIA office. The solution he describes sounds like the solution to the first two parts. The musical group [[Between the Buried and Me]] has a reference to ''Kryptos'' in their song "Obfuscation" from the 2009 album, ''[[The Great Misdirect]]''.
