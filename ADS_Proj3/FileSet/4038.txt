They say Essaim is designed to maintain French expertise long enough to persuade other European governments to join in an operational eavesdropping effort, which France alone cannot afford.<ref name=deSelding2005 /> In a Ministère de la Défense 12/18/2004 statement, France announced <ref>{{citation | author = Office of Science and Technology, French Embassy in the US | title = HELIOS IIA: A New Boost for European Defence | journal = Space News Business Report | id = France 2004 | date = 18 December 2004 | url = http://www.info-france-usa.org/sst/home/page.asp?target=nfo-let&LNG=us&PUBLID=9&LIVRID=8238 | accessdate = 2007-10-19 | format = |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080212221141/http://www.info-france-usa.org/sst/home/page.asp?target=nfo-let&LNG=us&PUBLID=9&LIVRID=8238 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-02-12}}</ref> that Helios 2A is part of an exchange program planned with the [[SAR-Lupe]] and Italian COSMO-SKYMED systems, under development respectively in Germany and Italy.

Orfeo is a dual-use (civilian and military) earth observation satellite network developed jointly between France and Italy. Italy is developing the Cosmo-Skymed X-band polarimetric SAR, to fly on two of the satellites. The other two will have complementary French electro-optical payloads. The second Orfeo is scheduled to launch in early 2008. While this is not an explicit SIGINT system, the French-Italian cooperation may suggest that Italy can get data from the French Essaim ELINT microsatellites.

After proof-of-concept of an ELINT payload on the first-generation IMINT satellites, the Tselina program was started in 1964, and the first successful launch of the simpler, lower-sensitivity Tselina O was in 1967. The more complex Tselina D first flew in 1970, a more complex Tselina D spacecraft started flying. Both versions flew until 1984, when the Tselina D was set up in a constellation of 6 satellites. Both Tselina O and D versions were flying side by side until 1984, when Tselina O subsystem was abandoned and its functions integrated into those conducted by the Tselina D spacecraft. As the Western observers noted, the Tselina D spacecraft, known in the West as the "heavy ELINT," would orbit the Earth in groups of six satellites spread 60 degrees apart in their orbits. Requirements for the Tselina-2 series were issued in 1974, with a first test launch scheduled for 1980 and full operational capability in 1982. Requirements grew until the Tselina-2 was too heavy for the Tsyklon-3 booster, and the program was switched to the Zenit booster in development. With the capacity of the Zenit, additional capabilities were added, including telemetry through relay satellites. On April 27, 1979, the Military Industrial Commission, VPK, officially approved the Zenit as a launcher for the Tselina-2 satellite. The VPK scheduled the beginning of flight tests for the 2nd quarter of 1981. The first Tselina-2 blasted off in September 1984 under official name Cosmos 1603 and declared operational in 1988. Tselina-2 system was declared operational in December 1988, which was confirmed by a government decree issued in December 1990. The most recent launch was on June 29, 2007, named Cosmos-2428. It is believed that was the last Tselina-2, with a next generation coming.<ref name=RSW-Tsalina/> According to <ref name=JMC-Sat>{{citation | author = James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies | title = Russia: Military Programs | url = http://cns.miis.edu/research/space/russia/mil.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-19}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>, the Tselina-2 is intended for land targets, while the US-PU EORSAT is intended for naval ELINT.
