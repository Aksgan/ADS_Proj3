Computer Go research has shown that given the large search tree, knowledge and pattern recognition are more important in Go than in other strategy games, such as chess.<ref name="Moves in mind"/> A study of the effects of age on Go-playing<ref>{{Citation | last = Masunaga | first = H | last2 = Horn | first2 = J. |year = 2001 | journal = Psychology and Aging | issue = 16 | pages = 293–311 | title = Expertise and age-related changes in components of intelligence | doi = 10.1037/0882-7974.16.2.293 | volume = 16}}</ref> has shown that mental decline is milder with strong players than with weaker players. According to the review of Gobet and colleagues, the pattern of brain activity observed with techniques such as [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] does not show large differences between Go and chess.
