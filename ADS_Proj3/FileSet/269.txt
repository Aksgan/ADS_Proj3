The first sidux preview appeared on the 2007-01-24<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://sidux.com/Article73.html | title=sidux-pre1-announce}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url=http://distrorankings.com/project/view/id/214 | title=distrorankings.com}}</ref> with the finished release appearing on 2007-02-22,<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://sidux.com/Article116.html | title=2007-01-announcement}}</ref> codenamed 2007-01 “Χάος"(chaos). In February 2007 sidux was awarded by [[DistroWatch]] with the donation of US$350.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20070305#donation | title=distrowatch donation}}</ref> The second sidux Live CD was released on the 2007-05-28,<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://sidux.com/Article237.html | title=sidux-2007-02_release}}</ref> codenamed sidux-2007-02 "Τάρταρος"(tartaros). During the [http://www.linuxtag.org/2007/ linuxtag 2007] (an open source fair in Berlin) a special linuxtag-edition was distributed at the shared booth of KDE e.V. and sidux. On the 2007-05-31 sidux e.V.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://sidux-ev.org | title=sidux_e.V.}}</ref> (foundation) has been officially registered with the German authorities. On 2007-11-15 [http://sidux-ev.org sidux e.V.] was accepted as [[Non-profit organization]] by German law,<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://sidux-ev.de/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=26 | title=sidux e.V. accepted as non-profit organisation}}</ref> retroactively as of 2007-04-01. ==Software== aptosid and sidux releases contain only [[free software]] as defined by the [[Debian Free Software Guidelines|Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG)]]. To aid proof of compliance, a monolithic tarball containing the source for all packages used in the release is provided alongside the Live CD ISOs.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://debian.tu-bs.de/project/aptosid/release/ | title=release-source-repository}}</ref> Access to non-free software such as codecs, plugins and wlan firmware can be enabled by configuring contrib and non-free Debian repositories in /etc/apt/sources.list.d In keeping with the evolutionary nature of the "unstable" Debian branch, aptosid and sidux releases do not provide an upgrade path from previous release versions. Rather, once they are is installed, incremental updates are performed via regular "dist-upgrades". The idea of a "release" is instead to improve Live CD hardware support, performance, flexibility and reliability, built from the current debian unstable repository.<ref>http://sidux.com/module-News-display-sid-519.html</ref> ==System recommendations== aptosid is officially supported for the [[P6 (microarchitecture)|i686]] [[computer architecture]] and the [[amd64]] [[computer architecture]] ==sidux e.V.== For permanent support and financing - on 2007-04-01 the non-profit association "sidux e.V.",<ref>[http://verein.sidux.com/Downloads-req-viewdownload-cid-3.html sidux e.V. - constitution / Satzung]</ref> seated in Berlin, Germany, was founded. Its constitution and goals go beyond the aims of the support and spreading of sidux. The cooperation between sidux e.V. and the sidux developers ended in summer 2010 due to disagreement. ==See also== {{Portal|Free software}} * [[Debian]] * [[List of live CDs]] * [[Live CD]] * [[Live USB]] ==References== {{Reflist|2}} ==External links== ;Official * [http://aptosid.com/ Homepage] ;Articles * [http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20080324#feature Interview with Chris Hildebrandt, the sidux project], DistroWatch Weekly, Issue 245, 24 March 2008 * [http://lwn.net/Articles/212845/ Kanotix seeks stability, sidux follows unstable], Posted December 6, 2006 by ris, Article on lwn.net ;Reviews * [http://desktoplinuxreviews.com/2009/07/16/sidux-2009-02-kde/ Sidux 2009-02 (KDE)] By Jim Lynch (July 16, 2009) desktoplinuxreviews.com * [http://www.linux.com/feature/149400 Sidux grows on you], By Susan Linton, Linux.com (Oct. 8, 2008) * [http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/reviews/6501/1/ Sidux, a Great Alternative to Ubuntu, Part 2], LinuxPlanet.com part 2/2 (July 10, 2008) * [http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/reviews/6498/1/ Sidux, a Great Alternative to Ubuntu], By Carla Schroder LinuxPlanet.com part 1/2 (July 3, 2008) * [http://www.linux.com/articles/60526 Sidux: A live CD for Debian unstable], By Preston St. Pierre, Linux.com (Mar. 7,2008) * [http://www.tuxmachines.org/node/19352 Sidux 2007-03.1 "Gaia": A closer look], by eco2geek, tuxmachines.org (Aug. 23, 2007) ;Other * {{distrowatch|sidux|sidux}} {{Xfce}} {{Linux-distro}} [[Category:Debian-based distributions]] [[Category:Operating system distributions bootable from read-only media]] [[Category:LiveDistro]] [[Category:Live USB]] [[Category:X86-64 Linux distributions]] [[Category:2007 software]] [[de:Aptosid]] [[es:Aptosid]] [[fa:سیدوکس]] [[fr:Aptosid]] [[it:Aptosid]] [[csb:Sidux]] [[nl:Aptosid]] [[ja:Aptosid]] [[pl:Sidux]] [[pt:Sidux]] [[ro:Sidux]] [[ru:Aptosid]]</text> </page> <page> <id>2259</id> <title>Aptronym</title> <text>{{Mergefrom|Charactonym|date=January 2010}} An '''aptronym''' is a name aptly suited to its owner.
