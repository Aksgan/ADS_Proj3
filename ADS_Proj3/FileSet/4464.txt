crash", will also be annotated as EVENTs. The EVENT tag is also used to annotate a subset of the states in a document. This subset of states includes those that are either transient or explicitly marked as participating in a temporal relation. See the TimeML annotation guidelines for more details. <h4>TIMEX3</h4> The TIMEX3 tag is primarily used to mark up explicit temporal expressions, such as times, dates, durations, etc. It is modeled on Setzer's (2001) TIMEX tag, as well as the TIDES (Ferro, et al. (2002)) TIMEX2 tag. Since it differs both in attribute structure and in use, it seemed best to give it a separate name, which reveals its heritage while at the same time indicating that it is different from its forebears. <h4>SIGNAL</h4> The SIGNAL tag represents a temporal signal. These are any function words that suggest a particular temporal relationship. Example SIGNALs are: ''when, in, after''. <h4>TLINK</h4> TLINKS, or Temporal Links establish relationships between two or more events for the purpose of ordering them in time. Temporal links are the most prevalent as they show how the TimeML elements (events and temporal expressions) are temporally related to each other. <h4>ALINK</h4> Events that are marked as ASPECTUAL introduce an ALINK or Aspectual Link. These links are quite straightforward as they only occur when an aspectual event has another event as an argument. For example, in the sentence "Mary completed the marathon", "completed" is an aspectual event while marathon is an occurrence. <h4>SLINK</h4> Like the ALINK, SLINKs (Subordinate Links) are only introduced by certain event classes, namely reporting events, intensional events (I ACTION and I STATE), and perception events. Additionally, these events must subordinate another event by taking it as an argument. SLINKs are used essentially to allow for temporal relationships to be given even for events that may or may not have happened. For example, reporting events such as "said" introduce an EVIDENTIAL SLINK. Consider the sentence ""He didn’t even stop,” one witness said". Here the "stop" event is being subordinated by the "said" event. ==References== <references /> ==Further reading== <ul> <li>[http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~jamesp/books/mit-gl.html The Generative Lexicon]</li> </ul> ==External links== *[http://www.timeml.org TimeML Specification Language] *[http://sites.google.com/site/pustejovsky/ Professor James Pustejovsky's website] *[http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/ Brandeis University Computer Science Department] {{DEFAULTSORT:TimeML}} [[Category:Markup languages]] [[Category:World Wide Web Consortium standards]] [[Category:Technical communication]] [[Category:Bibliography file formats]] [[Category:Computer file formats]] [[Category:Data modeling languages]] [[Category:Data serialization formats]] [[Category:Application layer protocols]] [[Category:Presentation layer protocols]]</text> </page> <page> <id>37769</id> <title>Time triple modular redundancy</title> <text>'''Time triple modular redundancy''', also known as TTMR, is a [[patented]] [[single event upset]] mitigation technique that detects and corrects errors in a computer or microprocessor. TTMR allows the use of [[very long instruction word]] ([[VLIW]]) style microprocessors in space or other applications where external sources, such as radiation, would cause an elevated rate of errors. TTMR permits [[triple modular redundancy]] ([[triple modular redundancy|TMR]]) protection in a single processor. [[Space Micro Inc]] developed and [[patented]] TTMR. It has been implemented in Space Micro's space qualified [[single board computer]]s, such as the [[Proton200k]]. ==External links== * [http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/7318169/description.html TTMR Patent] {{DEFAULTSORT:Time Triple Modular Redundancy}} [[Category:Error detection and correction]]</text> </page> <page> <id>37773</id> <title>Timeline of OpenBSD</title> <text>[[Image:OpenBSD21cover.gif|150px|thumb|right|OpenBSD 2.1 Cover]] [[Image:OpenBSD22cover.gif|150px|thumb|right|OpenBSD 2.2 Cover]] [[Image:Openbsd23cover.gif|150px|thumb|right|OpenBSD 2.3 Cover]] The following is a summary of the release history of the [[OpenBSD]] [[operating system]]. *'''1.1''': October 18, 1995 – :* OpenBSD CVS repository created by [[Theo de Raadt]]. [http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20061019013207] :* While the version number used at this stage was 1.1 (cf. the [[NetBSD#Releases|release history of NetBSD]], which OpenBSD branched from), OpenBSD 1.1 was not an official OpenBSD release in the sense which this term subsequently came to be used in. *'''1.2''': July 1, 1996 – :* Creation of the <tt>intro(9)</tt> man page, for documenting kernel internals. :* Integration of the <tt>update(8)</tt> command into the kernel. :* As before, while this version number was used in the early development of the OS, OpenBSD 1.2 was not an official release in the subsequently applicable sense. *'''2.0''': October 1, 1996 – :* the first official release of OpenBSD, and also the point at which [[XFree86]] first recognised OpenBSD as separate from [[NetBSD]] :* initial integration of the [[FreeBSD ports]] system :* replacement of [[Gawk (GNU package)|gawk]] with the [[AT&T]] [[awk]] :* integration of [[zlib]] :* added [[sudo]] *'''2.1''': June 1, 1997 – :* replacement of the older sh with [[pdksh]] *'''2.2''': December 1, 1997 – :* addition of the <tt>afterboot(8)</tt> man page *'''2.3''': May 19, 1998 – :* Introduced the ''haloed daemon'', or [[BSD Daemon|aureola beastie]], in head-only form created by Erick Green. *'''2.4''': December 1, 1998 – :* Featured the complete ''haloed daemon'', with [[trident]] and a finished body. *'''2.5''': May 19, 1999 – :* Introduced the Cop daemon image done by Ty Semaka. *'''c99''': June 4, 1999 – the original [[hackathon]] :* 10 developers in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]] *'''2.6''': December 1, 1999 – :* Based on the original [[Secure Shell|SSH]] suite and developed further by the OpenBSD team, 2.6 saw the first release of [[OpenSSH]], which is now available standard on most Unix-like operating systems and is the most widely used SSH suite. *'''2.7''': June 15, 2000 – :* support for SSH2 added to OpenSSH *'''c2k''': June 15, 2000 – :* 18 developers, once more in Calgary *'''2.8''': December 1, 2000 – :* <tt>isakmpd(8)</tt> *'''2.9''': June 1, 2001 – *'''c2k1''': June 21, 2001 – :* 35 developers in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]], [[USA]] *'''c2k1-II''': August 17, 2001 – :* 12 developers in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[USA]] *'''3.0''': December 1, 2001 – ''E-Railed (OpenBSD Mix)'', a [[Techno music|techno]] track performed by the release mascot, ''Puff Daddy'' the famed rapper and political icon. :* After licence restrictions were imposed on [[IPFilter]], the [[PF (firewall)|pf]] packet filter was developed. pf is now available in [[DragonFly BSD]], [[NetBSD]] and [[FreeBSD]]. *'''3.1''': May 19, 2002 – ''Systemagic'', where ''Puffy, the Kitten Slayer'', battles evil [[script kitties]].
