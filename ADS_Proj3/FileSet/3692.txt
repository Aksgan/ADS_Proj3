The RS Media uses basically the same body as the [[Robosapien v2|Robosapien V2]], but a different [[brain]] based on a [[Linux]] kernel. As the name implies, the RS Media's focus is on [[multimedia]] capabilities, including the ability to record and playback [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]], [[pictures]] and [[video]]. It retains and builds upon the Robosapien V2's [[sensor]] array and [[programming|programmability]]. == Hardware == * Two primary [[processors]]: ** 200MHz [[ARM architecture|ARM9]] with 64MB of [[Flash memory|flash RAM]] for the primary LINUX [[operating system]] and user files ** Custom 16 bit processor for handling the biomorphic robot functions * 16MB (2006 Model) or 32MB (2007 Model) of [[RAM]] * 1 [[USB]] port * [[Stereo]] audio plug * [[SD card]] slot (accepts up to 1GB cards) * [[VGA]] color [[camera]] in the forehead for [[Computer vision|image recognition]], and video recording * 20kHz [[microphone]] in the chest for audio recording * 1.9" 176x132 pixel color TFT supertwist [[LCD]] screen in its chest * 11W 3-[[Computer speaker|speaker]] system (2 x metal speakers + 1 back-mounted [[woofer]]) * Power-adapter port in foot * 12 [[Electric motor|motors]] based on the configuration found in the Robosapien V2 === Sensors === * 3 [[infrared]] (IR) [[detectors]] that use IR ranging for object detection * VGA quality camera in its forehead for video and human-tracking abilities * 3 sound [[sensors]] for [[sound]] localization and audio [[recording]] * 2 [[touch]] sensors on the back of each hand * 1 toe and 1 heel touch sensor in each foot == Software == Unlike previous products in WowWee's Robo line of products, the RS Media is the first to feature bundled [[Personal computer|PC]] [[software]]. There are 4 applications: the BodyCon Editor, the Personality Editor, the Macro Editor, and the Media Organizer. '''BodyCon Editor:''' The BodyCon Editor allows the user to customize and preview the RS Media movements. The user can create a sequence of movements as well as [[voice]] and sound effects and save everything in a [[Computer file|file]] for playback in the future. This file can also be included in a personality or to a user-created Macro. '''Personality Editor:''' The RS Media expands on the single personality that original Robosapien models came with, and comes with 4 different personalities ([[#Personalities|see below for more information]]). It also allows you to create your own personality from scratch. '''Macro Editor:''' The Macro Editor is actually a subcomponent of the Personality Editor, but it warrants its own description. The user can create their own [[Macro (computer science)|macros]] which are sequences of commands that the RS Media can execute. Macros can also include conditional routines that are based on environmental or user feedback. '''Media Organizer:''' The Media Organizer gives the user a [[GUI]] interface to manage the audio, images, video, games, and personalities on the RS Media. Files can be uploaded, downloaded, deleted and moved around. The robot would need to be connected to the computer running the Media Organizer software using
