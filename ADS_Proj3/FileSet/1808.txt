optimal time to finish all jobs without conflicts. Details of the scheduling problem define the structure of the graph. For example, when assigning aircraft to flights, the resulting conflict graph is an [[interval graph]], so the coloring problem can be solved efficiently. In [[bandwidth allocation]] to radio stations, the resulting conflict graph is a [[unit disk graph]], so the coloring problem is 3-approximable. ===Register allocation=== {{main|Register allocation}} A [[compiler]] is a [[computer program]] that translates one [[computer language]] into another. To improve the execution time of the resulting code, one of the techniques of [[compiler optimization]] is [[register allocation]], where the most frequently used values of the compiled program are kept in the fast [[processor registers]]. Ideally, values are assigned to registers so that they can all reside in the registers when they are used. The textbook approach to this problem is to model it as a graph coloring problem.<ref>{{harvtxt|Chaitin|1982}}</ref> The compiler constructs an ''interference graph'', where vertices are symbolic registers and an edge connects two nodes if they are needed at the same time. If the graph can be colored with ''k'' colors then the variables can be stored in ''k'' registers. ===Other applications=== The problem of coloring a graph has found a number of applications, including [[pattern matching]]. The recreational puzzle [[Sudoku]] can be seen as completing a 9-coloring on given specific graph with 81 vertices. ==Other colorings== ===Ramsey theory=== {{main|Ramsey theory}} An important class of ''improper'' coloring problems is studied in [[Ramsey theory]], where the graph’s edges are assigned to colors, and there is no restriction on the colors of incident edges. A simple example is the [[friendship theorem]] says that in any coloring of the edges of <math>K_6</math> the complete graph of six vertices there will be a monochromatic triangle; often illustrated by saying that any group of six people either has three mutual strangers or three mutual acquaintances. Ramsey theory is concerned with generalisations of this idea to seek regularity amid disorder, finding general conditions for the existence of monochromatic subgraphs with given structure. ===Other colorings=== {{multicol}} ; [[List coloring]]: Each vertex chooses from a list of colors ; [[List edge-coloring]]:Each edge chooses from a list of colors ; [[Total coloring]] :Vertices and edges are colored ; [[Harmonious coloring]] : Every pair of colors appears on at most one edge ; [[Complete coloring]] : Every pair of colors appears on at least one edge ; [[Exact coloring]] : Every pair of colors appears on exactly one edge ; [[Acyclic coloring]] : Every 2-chromatic subgraph is acyclic ; [[Star coloring]] : Every 2-chromatic subgraph is a disjoint collection of [[star (graph theory)|stars]] ; [[Strong coloring]] : Every color appears in every partition of equal size exactly once ; [[Strong edge coloring]] : Edges are colored such that each color class induces a matching (equivalent to coloring the square of the line graph) ; [[Equitable coloring]] : The sizes of color classes differ by at most one ; [[T-coloring]] : Distance between two colors of adjacent vertices must not belong to fixed set ''T'' {{multicol-break}} ; [[Rank coloring]] : If two vertices have the same color ''i'', then every path between them contain a vertex with color greater than ''i'' ; [[Interval edge-coloring]] : A color of edges meeting in a common vertex must be contiguous ; [[Circular coloring]] : Motivated by task systems in which production proceeds in a cyclic way ; [[Path coloring]] : Models a routing problem in graphs ; [[Fractional coloring]] : Vertices may have multiple colors, and on each edge the sum of the color parts of each vertex is not greater than one ; [[Oriented coloring]] : Takes into account orientation of edges of the graph ; [[Cocoloring]] : An improper vertex coloring where every color class induces an independent set or a clique ; [[Subcoloring]] : An improper vertex coloring where every color class induces a union of cliques ; [[Defective coloring]] : An improper vertex coloring where every color class induces a bounded degree subgraph. ; [[Weak coloring]] : An improper vertex coloring where every non-isolated node has at least one neighbor with a different color ; [[Sum-coloring]] : The criterion of minimalization is the sum of colors {{multicol-end}} Coloring can also be considered for [[signed graphs]] and [[gain graphs]]. == See also == {{Commonscat}} * [[Circular coloring]] * [[Critical graph]] * [[Cycle rank]] - Ordered chromatic number * [[Graph homomorphism]] * [[Mathematics of Sudoku#Mathematical context|Mathematics of Sudoku]] * [[Uniquely colorable graph]] ==Notes== {{reflist|4}} == References == {{refbegin|2}} * {{Citation | last1=Barenboim | first1=L. | last2=Elkin | first2=M. | contribution=Distributed (Δ + 1)-coloring in linear (in Δ) time | pages=111–120 | title=Proceedings of the 41st [[Symposium on Theory of Computing]] | year=2009 | doi=10.1145/1536414.1536432 }} * {{Citation | last1=Panconesi | first1=A. | last2=Srinivasan | first2=A. | contribution=On the complexity of distributed network decomposition | title=Journal of Algorithms | volume= 20 | year=1996 }} * {{Citation | last1=Schneider | first1=J. | contribution=A new technique for distributed symmetry breaking | title=Proceedings of the [[Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing]] | year=2010 | url = http://www.dcg.ethz.ch/publications/podcfp107_schneider_188.pdf }} * {{Citation | last1=Schneider | first1=J. | contribution=A log-star distributed maximal independent set algorithm for growth-bounded graphs | title=Proceedings of the [[Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing]] | year=2008 | url = http://www.dcg.ethz.ch/publications/podc08SW.pdf }} * {{Citation | last1= Beigel | first1= R. | last2= Eppstein | first2= D. | authorlink2= David Eppstein |title= 3-coloring in time O(1.3289<sup>n</sup>) |journal= [[Journal of Algorithms]] |volume= 54 |pages=168–204 |year=2005 | issue= 2) | doi= 10.1016/j.jalgor.2004.06.008 }} * {{Citation | last1=Björklund | first1=A. | last2=Husfeldt | first2=T. | last3=Koivisto | first3=M. | journal=[[SIAM Journal on Computing]] | pages=546–563 | title=Set partitioning via inclusion–exclusion | volume= 39 | year=2009 | doi=10.1137/070683933| issue=2 }} * {{Citation | last = Brèlaz | first = D. | title = New methods to color the vertices of a graph | journal = [[Communications of the ACM]] | volume = 22 | year = 1979 | pages = 251–256 | doi = 10.1145/359094.359101 }} * {{Citation
