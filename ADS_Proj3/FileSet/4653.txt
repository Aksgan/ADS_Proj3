species, the unrooted binary tree describing the evolution of those four species, and by methods that use [[quartet distance]] to measure the distance between trees.<ref>{{harvtxt|St. John|Warnow|Moret|Vawterd|2003}}.</ref> ===Branch-decomposition=== Unrooted binary trees are also used to define [[branch-decomposition]]s of graphs, by forming an unrooted binary tree whose leaves represent the edges of the given graph. That is, a branch-decomposition may be viewed as a hierarchical clustering of the edges of the graph. Branch-decompositions and an associated numerical quantity, branch-width, are closely related to [[treewidth]] and form the basis for efficient [[dynamic programming]] algorithms on graphs.<ref name="rs91">{{harvtxt|Robertson|Seymour|1991}}.</ref> ==Enumeration== Because of their applications in hierarchical clustering, the most natural [[graph enumeration]] problem on unrooted binary trees is to count the number of trees with ''n'' labeled leaves and unlabeled internal nodes. An unrooted binary tree on ''n'' labeled leaves can be formed by connecting the ''n''th leaf to a new node in the middle of any of the edges of an unrooted binary tree on ''n'' &minus; 1 labeled leaves. There are 2''n'' &minus; 5 edges at which the ''n''th node can be attached; therefore, the number of trees on ''n'' leaves is larger than the number of trees on ''n'' &minus; 1 leaves by a factor of 2''n'' &minus; 5. Thus, the number of trees on ''n'' labeled leaves is the [[double factorial]] :<math>(2n-5)!!=\frac{(2n-4)!}{(n-2)!2^{n-2}}.</math><ref>{{harvtxt|Balding|Bishop|Cannings|2007}}.</ref> The numbers of trees on 2, 3, 4, 5, ... labeled leaves are :1, 1, 3, 15, 105, 945, 10395, 135135, 2027025, 34459425, ... {{OEIS|A001147}}. ==Alternative names== Unrooted binary trees have also been called '''free binary trees''',<ref>{{harvtxt|Czumaj|Gibbons|1996}}.</ref> '''cubic trees''',<ref>{{harvtxt|Exoo|1996}}.</ref> '''ternary trees'''<ref name="rs91"/> and '''unrooted ternary trees''',<ref>{{harvtxt|Cilibrasi|Vitanyi|2006}}.</ref>. However, the "free binary tree" name has also been applied to unrooted trees that may have degree-two nodes<ref>{{harvtxt|Harary|Palmer|Robinson|1992}}.</ref> and to rooted binary trees with unordered children,<ref>{{harvtxt|Przytycka|Larmore|1994}}.</ref> and the "ternary tree" name is more frequently used to mean a [[ternary tree|rooted tree with three children per node]]. ==Notes== {{reflist|2}} ==References== *{{citation | last1 = Balding | first1 = D.
