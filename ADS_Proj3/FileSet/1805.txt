colors, it cannot be colored at all. With four colors, it can be colored in 24 + 4⋅12 = 72 ways: using all four colors, there are 4! = 24 valid colorings (''every'' assignment of four colors to ''any'' 4-vertex graph is a proper coloring); and for every choice of three of the four colors, there are 12 valid 3-colorings. So, for the graph in the example, a table of the number of valid colorings would start like this: {| class="wikitable" style="background:white;" |- |Available colors || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || … |- |Number of colorings || 0 || 0 || 12 || 72 || … |} The chromatic polynomial is a function ''P''(''G'', ''t'') that counts the number of ''t''-colorings of ''G''. As the name indicates, for a given ''G'' the function is indeed a [[polynomial]] in ''t''. For the example graph, ''P''(''G'', ''t'') = ''t''(''t'' &minus; 1)<sup>2</sup>(''t'' &minus; 2), and indeed ''P''(''G'', 4) = 72. The chromatic polynomial includes at least as much information about the colorability of ''G'' as does the chromatic number. Indeed, χ is the smallest positive integer that is not a root of the chromatic polynomial : <math>\chi (G)=\min\{ k \colon P(G,k) > 0 \}.</math> {| class="wikitable" style="background:white;" |+Chromatic polynomials for certain graphs |- | Triangle ''K''<sub>3</sub> || <math>t(t-1)(t-2)</math> |- | [[Complete graph]] ''K''<sub>''n''</sub> || <math>t(t-1)(t-2) \cdots (t-(n-1))</math> |- | [[Tree graph|Tree]] with ''n'' vertices || <math>t(t-1)^{n-1}</math> |- | [[Cycle graph|Cycle]] ''C''<sub>''n''</sub>|| <math>(t-1)^n+(-1)^n(t-1)</math> |- | [[Petersen graph]] || <math>t(t-1)(t-2)(t^7-12t^6+67t^5-230t^4+529t^3-814t^2+775t-352)</math> |} ===Edge coloring=== {{main|Edge coloring}} An '''edge coloring''' of a graph is a proper coloring of the ''edges'', meaning an assignment of colors to edges so that no vertex is incident to two edges of the same color. An edge coloring with ''k'' colors is called a ''k''-edge-coloring and is equivalent to the problem of partitioning the edge set into ''k'' [[Matching (graph theory)|matchings]]. The smallest number of colors needed for an edge coloring of a graph ''G'' is the '''chromatic index''', or '''edge chromatic number''', ''χ′(G)''. A '''Tait coloring''' is a 3-edge coloring of a [[cubic graph]]. The four color theorem is equivalent to the assertion that every planar cubic [[bridge (graph theory)|bridgeless]] graph admits a Tait coloring. ==Properties== ===Bounds on the chromatic number=== Assigning distinct colors to distinct vertices always yields a proper coloring, so : <math>1 \le \chi(G) \le n.\,</math> The only graphs that can be 1-colored are [[edgeless graph]]s, and the [[complete graph]] <math>K_n</math> of ''n'' vertices requires <math>\chi(K_n)=n</math> colors. In an optimal coloring there must be at least one of the graph‘s ''m'' edges between every pair of color classes, so : <math>\chi(G)(\chi(G)-1) \le 2m.\,</math> If ''G'' contains a [[clique (graph theory)|clique]] of size ''k'', then at least ''k'' colors are needed to color that clique; in other words, the chromatic number is at least the clique number: : <math>\chi(G) \ge \omega(G).\,</math> For [[interval graph]]s this bound is tight. The 2-colorable graphs are exactly the [[bipartite graph]]s, including [[tree (graph theory)|tree]]s and forests. By the four color theorem, every planar graph can be 4-colored. A [[greedy coloring]] shows that every graph can be colored with one more color than the maximum vertex [[degree (graph theory)|degree]], : <math>\chi(G) \le \Delta(G) + 1. \,</math> Complete graphs have <math>\chi(G)=n</math> and <math>\Delta(G)=n-1</math>, and [[odd cycle]]s have <math>\chi(G)=3</math> and <math>\Delta(G)=2</math>, so for these graphs this bound is best possible. In all other cases, the bound can be slightly improved; [[Brooks’ theorem]]<ref>{{harvtxt|Brooks|1941}}</ref> states that : '''Brooks’ theorem: '''<math>\chi (G) \le \Delta (G) </math> for a connected, simple graph ''G'', unless ''G'' is a complete graph or an odd cycle. ===Graphs with high chromatic number=== Graphs with large cliques have high chromatic number, but the opposite is not true. The [[Grötzsch graph]] is an example of a 4-chromatic graph without a triangle, and the example can be generalised to the [[Mycielskian]]s. : '''Mycielski’s Theorem''' {{harvs|first=Jan|last=Mycielski|year=1955|authorlink=Jan Mycielski}}: There exist triangle-free graphs with arbitrarily high chromatic number. From Brooks’s theorem, graphs with high chromatic number must have high maximum degree. Another local property that leads to high chromatic number is the presence of a large clique. But colorability is not an entirely local phenomenon: A graph with high [[Girth (graph theory)|girth]] looks locally like a tree, because all cycles are long, but its chromatic number need not be 2: :'''Theorem''' (Erdős): There exist graphs of arbitrarily high girth and chromatic number. ===Bounds on the chromatic index=== An edge coloring of ''G'' is a vertex coloring of its [[line graph]] <math>L(G)</math>, and vice versa. Thus, :<math>\chi'(G)=\chi(L(G)). \, </math> There is a strong relationship between edge colorability and the graph’s maximum degree <math>\Delta(G)</math>. Since all edges incident to the same vertex need their own color, we have : <math>\chi'(G) \ge \Delta(G).\,</math> Moreover, : '''[[König's theorem (graph theory)|König’s theorem]]:''' <math>\chi'(G) = \Delta(G)</math> if ''G'' is bipartite. In general, the relationship is even stronger than what Brooks’s theorem gives for vertex coloring: : '''Vizing’s Theorem:''' A graph of maximal degree <math>\Delta</math> has edge-chromatic number <math>\Delta</math> or <math>\Delta+1</math>. ===Other properties=== For planar graphs, vertex colorings are essentially dual to [[nowhere-zero flows]]. About infinite graphs, much less is known. The following is one of the few results about infinite graph coloring: :If all finite subgraphs of an [[infinite graph]] ''G'' are ''k''-colorable, then so is ''G'', under the assumption of the [[axiom of choice]] {{harv|de Bruijn|Erdős|1951}}. :Also, if a graph admits a full ''n''-coloring for every ''n'' ≥ ''n''<sub>0</sub>, it admits an infinite full coloring {{harv|Fawcett|1978}}. ===Open problems=== The [[Hadwiger–Nelson problem|chromatic number of the plane]], where two points are adjacent if they have unit distance, is unknown, although it is one of 4, 5, 6, or 7. Other [[unsolved problems in mathematics|open problems]] concerning the chromatic number of graphs include the [[Hadwiger conjecture (graph theory)|Hadwiger conjecture]] stating that every graph with chromatic number ''k'' has a [[complete graph]] on ''k'' vertices as a [[graph minor|minor]], the [[Erdős–Faber–Lovász conjecture]] bounding the chromatic number of unions of complete graphs that have at exactly one vertex in common to each pair, and the [[Albertson conjecture]]
