Its security is based on the intractability of certain [[discrete logarithm]] problems. It is considered the simplest digital signature scheme to be provably secure in a [[random oracle]] model. It is efficient and generates short signatures. It is covered by {{US patent|4995082}}, which expired in February 2008. ==Algorithm== ===Choosing parameters=== *All users of the signature scheme agree on a [[group (mathematics)|group]] <math>G</math> with generator <math>g</math> of prime order <math>q</math> in which the [[discrete log]] problem is hard. Typically a [[Schnorr group]] is used. *All users agree on a [[cryptographic hash function]] H. ===Key generation=== *Choose a private key <math>x</math> such that <math>0<x<q</math>. *The public key is <math>y</math> where ''y'' = ''g''<sup>x</sup>. ===Signing=== To sign a message M: *Choose a random <math>k</math> such that <math>0<k<q</math> *Let <math>r=g^k\,</math> *Let <math>e=H(M||r),\,</math> (where || denotes concatenation) *Let <math>s=(k-xe) \;\text{mod } q</math> The signature is the pair <math>(e,s)</math>. Note that <math>0 \le e < q</math> and <math>0 \le s < q</math>; if a Schnorr group is used and <math>q < 2^{160}</math>, then the signature can fit into 40 bytes. ===Verifying=== *Let <math>r_v=g^sy^e\,</math> *Let <math>e_v=H(M||r_v)\,</math> If <math>e_v=e</math> then the signature is verified. Public elements: <math>G,g,q,y,s,e,r</math>. Private elements: <math>k,x</math>. ==See also== * [[Digital_Signature_Algorithm|DSA]] * [[ElGamal signature scheme]] ==References== * C.P.

It has received funding from both the federal and provincial government, Faculties at the University of Toronto, and affiliated hospitals. The supercomputer operates on 30,240 intel 5500 series 2.53 GHz processor cores arranged in 45 file-like stacks can perform 300 trillion calculations per second which will be used for highly calculation-intensive tasks. It is one of seven regional High Performance Computing consortia across Canada and is the most powerful University HPC system outside of the US. As of November 2008, the partially constructed systems were already ranked at #53 on the Top 500 List. It is also the only Canadian HPC in top 100 of the list. The parallel systems were anticipated to rank around #50 and #25 upon completion in June 2009. The TOP500 list for June 2009 ranked the GPC, iDadaplex, system at #16 while the TCS dropped to #80. The SciNet offices are based on the St. George street campus, however, to accommodate the large floor space and power needs, the datacentre facility is housed in a warehouse about 30 km north of campus in Vaughan. At the core of SciNet research are six key areas of study: Astronomy and Astrophysics, Aerospace and Biomedical Engineering, High Energy Particle Physics, Integrative Computational Biology, Planetary Physics, and Theoretical Chemical Physics. == History == SciNet was initially formed in the fall of 2004 following an agreement between the Canadian [[high-performance computing]] community to develop a response to the newly created National Platform Fund. The community felt that funding from the NPF would enable the development of a collective national capability in HPC. The Canadian HPC community was successful in its NPF proposal and SciNet was awarded a portion of that funding. SciNet finalized its contract with [[IBM]] to build the system in July 2008 and the formal announcement was August 14th, 2008. <ref>{{cite web | title=U of T to acquire Canada's most powerful supercomputer from IBM | url=http://www.news.utoronto.ca/campus-news/u-of-t-to-acquire-canadas-most-powerful-supercomputer-from-ibm.html | publisher=University of Toronto | date=2008-08-14 | accessdate=2009-05-08}}</reF> On Thursday, June 18, 2009, the most powerful [[supercomputer]] in [[Canada]] went online and would have ranked twelfth most powerful computer worldwide had it been completed six months earlier.<Ref name="CBC June">{{cite web | title = Toronto team completes Canada's most powerful supercomputer | publisher = CBC News | date = June 18, 2009 | url = http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2009/06/18/tech-090618-ibm-supercomputer-scinet-toronto.html | accessdate =2009-06-18 }} </ref> == Specifications== The [[IBM]] [[IBM System x|System x]] iDataPlex Supercomputer operates on 30,240 intel 5500 series 2.53 GHz processor cores arranged in 45 file-like stacks.

To utilize the cold Canadian climate the system is notified when external temperatures go below a certain point. At that point the chiller switches over to use the "free-air" cooling available.
