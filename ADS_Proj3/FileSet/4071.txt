<page> <id>34583</id> <title>Size function</title> <text>'''Size functions''' are shape descriptors, in a geometrical/topological sense. They are functions from the half-plane <math>x<y\ </math> to the natural numbers, counting certain connected components of a [[topological space]]. They are used in [[pattern recognition]] and [[topology]]. ==Formal definition== In [[size theory]], the '''size function''' <math>\ell_{(M,\varphi)}:\Delta^+=\{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2:x<y\}\to \mathbb{N}</math> associated with the [[size pair]] <math>(M,\varphi:M\to \mathbb{R})</math> is defined in the following way. For every <math>(x,y)\in \Delta^+</math>, <math>\ell_{(M,\varphi)}(x,y)</math> is equal to the number of connected components of the set <math>\{p\in M:\varphi(p)\le y\}</math> that contain at least one point at which the [[measuring function]] (a [[continuous function]] from a [[topological space]] <math>M\ </math> to <math>\mathbb{R}^k\ </math>.<ref name="FroLa99"> Patrizio Frosini, Claudia Landi, ''Size theory as a topological tool for computer vision'', Pattern Recognition And Image Analysis, 9(4):596-603, [[1999]].</ref> <ref name="FroMu99">Patrizio Frosini, Michele Mulazzani, ''Size homotopy groups for computation of natural size distances'', Bulletin of the Belgian Mathematical Society - Simon Stevin, 6:455-464 [[1999]].</ref>) <math>\varphi</math> takes a value smaller than or equal to <math>x\ </math> <ref name="dAFrLa06">Michele d'Amico, Patrizio Frosini, Claudia Landi, ''Using matching distance in Size Theory: a survey'', International Journal of Imaging Systems and Technology, 16(5):154–161, 2006.</ref>. The concept of size function can be easily extended to the case of a measuring function <math>\varphi:M\to \mathbb{R}^k</math>, where <math>\mathbb{R}^k</math> is endowed with the usual partial order <ref name="BiCeFr08">Silvia Biasotti, Andrea Cerri, Patrizio Frosini, Claudia Landi, ''Multidimensional size functions for shape comparison'', Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision 32:161-179, 2008.</ref>.

Here the topology on <math>M\ </math> is induced by the <math>C^0\ </math>-norm, while the [[measuring function]] <math>\varphi\ </math> takes each path <math>\gamma\in M</math> to its length. In <ref name="Fro91"> Patrizio Frosini, ''Measuring shapes by size functions'', Proc. of SPIE, Intelligent Robots and Computer Vision X: Algorithms and Techniques, Boston, MA, 1607:122-133, 1991.</ref> the case of <math>M\ </math> equal to the topological space of all ordered <math>k\ </math>-tuples of points in a submanifold of a Euclidean space is considered. Here the topology on <math>M\ </math> is induced by the metric <math>d((P_1,\ldots,P_k),(Q_1\ldots,Q_k))=\max_{1\le i\le k}\|P_i-Q_i\|</math>. An extension of the concept of size function to [[algebraic topology]] was made in <ref name="FroMu99">Patrizio Frosini and Michele Mulazzani, ''Size homotopy groups for computation of natural size distances'', Bulletin of the Belgian Mathematical Society - Simon Stevin, 6:455-464 1999.</ref>, where the concept of [[size homotopy group]] was introduced. Here [[measuring function]]s taking values in <math>\mathbb{R}^k</math> are allowed. An extension to [[homology theory]] (the [[size functor]]) was introduced in <ref name="CaFePo01">Francesca Cagliari, Massimo Ferri and Paola Pozzi, ''Size functions from a categorical viewpoint'', Acta Applicandae Mathematicae, 67(3):225-235, 2001.</ref>. The concepts of [[size homotopy group]] and [[size functor]] are strictly related to the concept of [[persistent homology group]] <ref name="EdLeZo02">Herbert Edelsbrunner, David Letscher and Afra Zomorodian, ''Topological Persistence and Simplification'', [[Discrete and Computational Geometry]], 28(4):511-533, 2002.</ref>, studied in [[persistent homology]]. It is worth to point out that the size function is the rank of the <math>0</math>-th persistent homology group, while the relation between the persistent homology group and the size homotopy group is analogous to the one existing between [[homology group]]s and [[homotopy group]]s. Size functions have been initially introduced as a mathematical tool for shape comparison in [[computer vision]] and [[pattern recognition]], and have constituted the seed of [[size theory]] <ref>Alessandro Verri, Claudio Uras, Patrizio Frosini and Massimo Ferri, ''On the use of size functions for shape analysis'', Biological Cybernetics, 70:99-107, 1993.</ref>, <ref>Patrizio Frosini and Claudia Landi, ''Size functions and morphological transformations'', Acta Applicandae Mathematicae, 49(1):85-104, 1997.</ref>, <ref>Alessandro Verri and Claudio Uras, ''Metric-topological approach to shape representation and recognition'', Image Vision Comput., 14:189-207, 1996.</ref>, <ref>Alessandro Verri and Claudio Uras, ''Computing size functions from edge maps'', Internat.

Pattern Recognition 41:2855-2873, 2008.</ref> The main point is that size functions are invariant for every transformation preserving the [[measuring function]]. Hence, they can be adapted to many different applications, by simply changing the [[measuring function]] in order to get the wanted invariance. Moreover, size functions show properties of relative resistance to noise, depending on the fact that they distribute the information all over the half-plane <math>\Delta^+\ </math>. ==Main properties== Assume that <math>M\ </math> is a compact locally connected Hausdorff space. The following statements hold: ¤ every size function <math>\ell_{(M,\varphi)}(x,y)</math> is a [[non-decreasing function]] in the variable <math>x\ </math> and a [[Nonincreasing
