**Custom [[RISC]] based [[Digital signal processor|DSP]] **Stereo sound *Storage: Custom 880KB 3.5" disk drive *Misc: Cartridge expansion slot Despite the impressive specification on paper, the design did suffer from some limitations. Nick Speakman of software developer Binary Designs pointed out that “the custom chips are very powerful, but they require a lot of programming talent to get anything out of them. The screen handling [also] isn't as fast as we anticipated it to be.” Brian Pollock of software publisher Logotron highlighted the limitations caused by the shortage of RAM (kept low to keep prices down), “My only concern is memory, or lack of it. For instance, in the game that I'm writing I am using six-channel FM synthesized sound. Now that takes up a hell of a lot of memory. I couldn't usefully fit any more samples, and that's sad.”<ref name="specs" /> The memory issue was also flagged by [[Crash (magazine)|Crash Magazine]], which pointed out that the floppy disk format meant that games had to be loaded into the machine's RAM (originally intended to be 128k) in turn requiring the system to be constantly accessing the disk drive. Konix intended to remedy the problem with RAM upgrade cartridges, provided that the price of RAM fell in the future.<ref name="crash">{{cite|title=March 1989 issue of Crash Magazine|publisher=Newsfield}}</ref> Overall though, programmers received the system positively. Jeff Minter described the controller itself as “superb,” while Chris Walsh of [[Argonaut Games]] stated that “Polygon based games like [[Starglider 2]] are going to be easy to program. The machine is geared up to rotating masses of vertices at incredible rates.”<ref name="specs" /> Numerous game developers were recruited to produce games for the system, including Jeff Minter's [[Llamasoft]], [[Electronic Arts]], [[SCE Studio Liverpool|Psygnosis]], [[Ocean Software|Ocean]] and [[U.S. Gold]], with Konix promising 40 games to be available by Christmas.<ref name="crash" /> [[Lucasfilm]] was mooted as a developer with the possibility of releasing their own branded version of the machine in the US, but nothing was ever confirmed.<ref name="wyn">[http://www.konixmultisystem.co.uk/index.php?id=interviews&content=wyn#start Interview with Wyn Holloway at the Konix MultiSystem Archive]</ref> <ref name="lucas">{{cite|title=December 1989 issue of [[The Games Machine]]|publisher=[[Newsfield Publications|Newsfield]]}}</ref> Games known to be in development for the system during 1988 included Llamasoft's [[Attack of the Mutant Camels]], [[Studio 3|System 3's]] Last Ninja 2, [[Sobee|Vivid Image's]] Hamerfist, and Logotron's Star Ray.<ref name="games">{{cite|author=Paul Glancey|title=April 1989 issue of [[Computer and Video Games]]|publisher=[[EMAP]]}}</ref> ==Demise== Signs of trouble in the progress to the release of the console did not take long to arrive. By May the release date had slipped from August to October. By October, a first quarter 1990 release was envisaged. The December edition of The Games Machine magazine revealed the scale of the problem. According to company sources, Konix had been on the brink of calling in receivers. Cheques had bounced, employees hadn't been paid and software development had been brought to a halt in mid-October as developers had reached the stage where they could continue no further without a finished machine.<ref name="lucas" /> In March 1990 it was revealed that Konix had sold the rights to sell their joystick range in the UK to [[Spectravideo|Spectravision]] who also manufactured the rival [[QuickShot]] joystick range.<ref>{{cite|title=March 1990 issue of The Games Machine|publisher=Newsfield}}</ref> They had effectively sold off the family silver in order to keep the MultiSystem project alive. Autumn 1990 was to be the new release time. Eventually, beset by delays and in spite of all of the media coverage and apparent demand for the machine, the project ultimately went under when Konix ran out of cash without a completed system ever being released. Some people, including Holloway, contend that this was due to major international competitors leaning on Konix's suppliers and financiers to prevent the project reaching the market.<ref name="wyn" /> ==Legacy== After the project was abandoned, Flare Technology began work on a new project, ''Flare Two'', which was eventually bought by [[Atari]] and, after further development, formed the basis for the [[Atari Jaguar]] game console. The original Flare One technology was purchased by arcade gambling machine manufacturer Bellfruit for use in their quiz machines. A [[MAME]] emulator of those games now exists.<ref>[http://mamedev.org/source/src/mame/drivers/bfcobra.c.html MAME page for Bellfruit's Flare One applications]</ref> The Konix Multisystem's design was later released independently by a Chinese company called MSC (MultiSystem China] as the MSC Super MS-200E Multi-System, although this was simply an inexpensive PC games controller, without any special internal hardware. In terms of its long lasting impact on the video game industry, perhaps the most intriguing aspect is Wyn Holloway's claim that Lucasfilm had their frequent partner [[Sony]] lined up to manufacture their version of the system,<ref name="wyn" /> this being contemporaneous with Sony's development of the SNES-CD for [[Nintendo]], which ultimately led to the first [[PlayStation]]. Video taped footage showing several games being worked on for the system survives. Excerpts from the footage were later issued on the cover disc of issue 8 of ''Retro Gamer'' magazine. ==References== {{reflist}} *[http://www.konixmultisystem.co.uk/index.php?id=home Konix MultiSystem Archive] *[http://www.zhell.co.uk/konix.html Zogging Hell Page on the Konix Multisystem] ==External links== * [http://home.cogeco.ca/~kroland/systems/KonixMultisystem/index.html At Old-Computers.com] * [http://home.wanadoo.nl/hessel.meun/konix/konix-menu.htm Press coverage] * [http://home.wanadoo.nl/hessel.meun/msc/msc-main.htm The MSC Multi-System] [[Category:Video game hardware]] [[Category:Fourth-generation video game consoles]] [[Category:Vaporware game consoles]] [[it:Konix Multisystem]]</text> </page> <page> <id>20833</id> <title>Kororaa</title> <text>{{Notability|Products|date=January 2009}} {{Infobox OS | name = Kororaa | logo = [[Image:Kororaa.png]] | developer = Christopher Smart and Matthew Oliver | family = [[Linux]] | source_model = [[Open source]] | working_state = Discontinued | latest_release_version = 2005-beta2-r1, Live CD 0.3{{Fact|date=January 2009}} | latest_release_date = December 12, 2005, April 6, 2006 | kernel_type = [[Monolithic kernel]] | ui = [[GNOME]], [[KDE]] | license = Various| website = [http://www.kororaa.org www.kororaa.org] | supported_platforms = [[i686]], [[AMD64]] | }} '''Kororaa''' was a binary installation method for [[Gentoo Linux]] which aimed for easy installation of a Gentoo system by using install scripts instead of manual configuration.
