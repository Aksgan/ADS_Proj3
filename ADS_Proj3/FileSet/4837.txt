It was released January 2004 and included both English and Japanese versions for Windows 2000, Windows XP Professional, and [[Windows Server 2003]] on x86 platforms with Internet Explorer 5.0+. It included Interix subsystem release 3.5 (build version 8.0) adding internationalization support (at least for the English version which did not have such until now) and [[POSIX Threads|POSIX threading]]. This release could only be installed to an [[NTFS]] [[file system]] (earlier versions supported [[File Allocation Table|FAT]]; this was for improved file-security requirements in Interix 3.5). The following UNIX versions were supported for NFS components: Solaris 7 and 8, Red Hat Linux 8.0, AIX 5L 5.2, and HP-UX 11i. It included the following components: * Base Utilities for Interix (BaseUtils; including X11R6 and X11R5 utilities) * UNIX Perl for Interix (UNIXPerl) * Interix SDK (InterixSDK; including headers and libraries for development and a wrapper for Visual Studio compiler) * GNU Utilities for Interix (GNUUtils, again about 9 utilities) * GNU SDK for Interix (GNUSDK; including gcc and g++) * NFS Client for Windows (NFSClient) * NFS Gateway for Windows (NFSGateway) * NFS Server for Windows (NFSServer) * NIS Server for Windows (NIS) * Password synchronization (PasswdSync) * Windows Remote Shell Service (RshSvc) * Telnet Server for Windows (TelnetServer) * NFS User Name Mapping (Mapsvc) * NFS Authentication Server (NFSServerAuth) * PCNFS server (Pcnfsd) * ActiveState Perl (Perl) ===Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications (SUA)=== [[Windows Server 2003|Windows Server 2003 R2]] contains most SFU components, namely Microsoft Services for Network File System (NFS), Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications (SUA, aka [[Interix]]), and Identity Management for UNIX.<ref name = "MS">[http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/R2/unixcomponents/default.mspx Microsoft Windows Server 2003 R2 UNIX Interoperability Components], Microsoft</ref> [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]] Enterprise and Ultimate Editions also contain the Services for Unix components, now called the Subsystem for UNIX-based applications (SUA), and Client for NFS v3.

In addition, authentication for UNIX systems relies on the insecure NIS protocol (LDAP- and Kerberos-based authentication require a third-party solution). Microsoft has released several [[hotfix]]es for Windows Services for UNIX, but no service packs. The GNU utilities are several versions older than the latest ones. ==See also== * [[Interix]] * [[MKS Toolkit]] * [[Print Services for UNIX]] * [[Cygwin]] * [http://lbw.sourceforge.net/ LBW: Linux Binaries on Windows] requires Interix to be installed first. ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * Microsoft sources ** [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb496506.aspx Microsoft TechNet: Windows Services for UNIX] ** [http://blogs.msdn.com/sfu/default.aspx Services for UNIX: Blog] ** [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=896c9688-601b-44f1-81a4-02878ff11778&DisplayLang=en Download Details: Windows Services for UNIX 3.5] *** [http://download.microsoft.com/download/a/1/c/a1ca7af1-a6e3-46e7-874a-4c5d8c0fb3b7/SFU35SEL_EN.exe Direct Download] * Other ** [http://www.suacommunity.com/SUAinstallation-03.wmv SUA Installation Video] ** [http://www.interopsystems.com/SUAfamiliarization-02.wmv SUA Familiarization Video] ** [http://www.suacommunity.com/FAQs.htm SFU/SUA/Interix FAQ web page] ** [http://www2.truman.edu/~whowd/blog/2006/09/set-unix-id-script.html Script to pragmatically set the UNIX attributes defined in the version 3.5 schema extensions] ** [http://www.davidstclair.co.uk/networking/create-an-nfs-share-with-microsoft-services-for-uni-15.html Setup Services for UNIX] {{Windows Components}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Windows Services For Unix}} [[Category:Microsoft software]] [[Category:Windows components]] [[Category:Microsoft Windows|Services for UNIX]] [[Category:Compatibility layers]] [[de:Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX]] [[fr:Services for UNIX]] [[ja:Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX]] [[ru:Сервисы Microsoft Windows для UNIX]]</text> </page> <page> <id>40342</id> <title>Windows Update</title> <text>{{Infobox Windows component | name = Windows Update | developer= Microsoft Windows | logo = Windows update icon.png | screenshot = Windows Update.png | type = [[Network service]] | service_name = | service_description = Windows Update | included_with = [[Windows 98]] and later | related_components = [[Background Intelligent Transfer Service|BITS]], [[Windows Installer]], [[Internet Explorer]], [[Windows Genuine Advantage]] }} '''Windows Update''' is a service provided by [[Microsoft]] that provides updates for the [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating system]] and its installed components, including [[Internet Explorer]]. An optional feature disables access to Windows Update, enabling instead access to '''Microsoft Update''', an expanded version of the service which provides updates not just for the operating system and Internet Explorer, but also for other Microsoft [[software]] running under Windows, such as [[Microsoft Office]], [[Windows Live]] applications, and [[Microsoft Expression Studio]]. Updates are normally provided over an [[Internet]] connection, although there is provision for updates to be installed on computers without an Internet connection.
