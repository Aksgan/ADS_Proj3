and has made provisions for information services, from its freshwater libraries, to its information collection titled "FreshwaterLife", to its reference collection "The Fritsch Collection" <ref name="fritsch">[http://fritschalgae The Fritsch Collection]</ref>. Finally, many publications and analysis guides are also published by the FBA, with records of freshwater information.<ref name="publications">[http://www.fba.org.uk/recorders FBA Recorders]</ref> The FBA also runs many meetings and courses for specialism in [[freshwater biology]], holding an Annual Scientific Meeting. On September 2008 the FBA launched a series of conferences in [[Aquatic Biology]]. The first of these was entitled "Multiple Stressors in Freshwater Ecosystems". The second, in April 2010, will have the theme of "Integrated Catchment Management". == External links == *[http://www.fba.org.uk/index.html The FBA web-site] *[http://www.fba.org.uk/index/ferrycam.html FBA web-cam at Far Sawrey ferry landing stage] == References == {{reflist}} [[Category:British professional bodies]] {{charity-stub}} [[simple:Freshwater Biological Association]]</text> </page> <page> <id>14281</id> <title>Friendly number</title> <text>In [[number theory]], a '''friendly number''' is a [[natural number]] that shares a certain characteristic called '''abundancy''', the ratio between the sum of [[divisor]]s of the number and the number itself, with one or more other numbers. Two numbers with the same abundancy form a '''friendly pair'''. Being mutually friendly is an [[equivalence relation]], and thus induces a [[partition (set theory)|partition]] of the positive naturals into '''clubs''' ([[equivalence class]]es) of mutually friendly numbers. A number that is not part of any friendly pair is called '''solitary'''. The abundancy of ''n'' is the [[rational number]] σ(''n'') / ''n'', in which σ denotes the [[divisor function|sum of divisors function]]. A number ''n'' is a friendly number if there exists ''m'' ≠ ''n'' such that σ(''m'') / ''m'' = σ(''n'') / ''n''. Note that abundancy is not the same as [[abundant number|abundance]] which is defined as σ(''n'') − 2''n''. Abundancy may also be expressed as <math>\sigma_{-\!1}(n)</math> where <math>\sigma_k</math> denotes a divisor function with <math>\sigma_k(n)</math> equal to the sum of the ''k''-th powers of the divisors of ''n''. The numbers 1 through 5 are all solitary. The smallest friendly number is 6, forming for example the friendly pair (6, 28) with abundancy σ(6) / 6 = (1+2+3+6) / 6 = 2, the same as σ(28) / 28 = (1+2+4+7+14+28) / 28 = 2. The shared value 2 is an integer in this case but not in many other cases. There are several unsolved problems related to the friendly numbers. In spite of the similarity in name, there is no specific relationship between the friendly numbers and the [[amicable number]]s or the [[sociable number]]s, although the definitions of the latter two also involve the divisor function. ==Example== As another example, (30, 140) is a friendly pair, because 30 and 140 have the same abundancy: :<math> \tfrac{\sigma(30)}{30} = \tfrac{1+2+3+5+6+10+15+30}{30} =\tfrac{1}{1}+\tfrac{1}{2}+\tfrac{1}{3}+\tfrac{1}{5}+\tfrac{1}{6}+\tfrac{1}{10}+\tfrac{1}{15}+\tfrac{1}{30}=\tfrac{12}{5}</math> :<math> \tfrac{\sigma(140)}{140} = \tfrac{1+2+4+5+7+10+14+20+28+35+70+140}{140} = \tfrac{1}{1}+\tfrac{1}{2}+\tfrac{1}{4}+\tfrac{1}{5}+\tfrac{1}{7}+\tfrac{1}{10}+\tfrac{1}{14}+\tfrac{1}{20}+\tfrac{1}{28}+\tfrac{1}{35}+\tfrac{1}{70}+\tfrac{1}{140}=\tfrac{12}{5}.</math> The numbers 2480, 6200 and 40640 are also members of this club, as they each have an abundancy equal to 12/5. ==Solitary numbers== A number that belongs to a singleton club, because no other number is friendly with it, is a solitary number. All prime numbers are known to be solitary, as are powers of prime numbers. More generally, if the numbers ''n'' and σ(''n'') are [[coprime]] – meaning that the [[greatest common divisor]] of these numbers is 1, so that σ(''n'')/''n'' is an irreducible fraction – then the number ''n'' is solitary. For a prime number ''p'' we have σ(''p'') = ''p'' + 1, which is coprime with ''p''. No general method is known for determining whether a number is friendly or solitary. The smallest number whose classification is unknown (as of 2009) is 10; it is conjectured to be solitary; if not, its smallest friend is a fairly large number. ==Large clubs== It is an open problem whether there are infinitely large clubs of mutually friendly numbers. The perfect numbers form a club, and it is conjectured that there are infinitely many perfect numbers (at least as many as there are [[Mersenne prime]]s), but no proof is known. As of June 2009, 47 perfect numbers are known, the largest of which has more than 25 million digits in [[decimal]] notation. There are clubs with more known members, in particular those formed by [[multiply perfect number]]s, which are numbers whose abundancy is an integer. As of early 2008, the club of friendly numbers with abundancy equal to 9 has 2079 known members.<ref>{{cite web |last=Flammenkamp |first=Achim |title=The Multiply Perfect Numbers Page|url= http://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/achim/mpn.html |accessdate=2008-04-20 }}</ref> Although some are known to be quite large, clubs of multiply perfect numbers (excluding the perfect numbers themselves) are conjectured to be finite. ==Notes== <references/> ==References== *{{MathWorld|urlname=FriendlyNumber|title=Friendly Number}} *{{MathWorld|urlname=FriendlyPair|title=Friendly Pair}} *{{MathWorld|urlname=SolitaryNumber|title=Solitary Number}} *{{MathWorld|urlname=Abundancy|title=Abundancy}} {{Divisor classes navbox}} [[Category:Divisor function]] [[Category:Integer sequences]] [[Category:Number theory]] [[Category:Unsolved problems in mathematics]] [[eo:Kompleza nombro]] [[fa:اعداد دوست]] [[sr:Пријатељски број]] [[zh:孤獨數]]</text> </page> <page> <id>14302</id> <title>Frontal solver</title> <text>A '''frontal solver''', due to [[Bruce Irons (engineer)|Irons]]<ref>Irons, B.

''Finite Element Handbook''.</ref> A frontal solver builds a [[LU decomposition|LU]] or [[Cholesky decomposition]] of a sparse matrix given as the assembly of element matrices by assembling the matrix and eliminating equations only on a subset of elements at a time. This subset is called the front and it is essentially the transition region between the part of the system already finished and the part not touched yet. The whole sparse matrix is never created explicitly. Only parts of the matrix are assembled as they enter the front. Processing the front involves [[dense matrix]] operations, which use the CPU efficiently. In a typical implementation, only the front is in [[computer memory|memory]], while the factors in the decomposition are written into [[computer file|files]]. The element matrices are read from files or created as needed and discarded. A '''multifrontal solver''' of [[Iain S. Duff|Duff]] and [[John K. Reid|Reid]]<ref>I. S. Duff ,
