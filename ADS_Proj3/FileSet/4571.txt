of wiring in which two conductors (the forward and return conductors of a single [[Electronic circuit|circuit]]) are twisted together for the purposes of canceling out [[electromagnetic interference]] (EMI) from external sources; for instance, [[electromagnetic radiation]] from unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cables, and [[crosstalk]] between neighboring pairs. It was invented by [[Alexander Graham Bell]]. == Explanation == In [[balanced pair]] operation, the two wires carry equal and opposite signals and the destination detects the difference between the two. This is known as [[differential signaling|differential mode]] transmission. Noise sources introduce signals into the wires by coupling of electric or magnetic fields and tend to couple to both wires equally. The noise thus produces a common-mode signal which is cancelled at the receiver when the difference signal is taken. This method starts to fail when the noise source is close to the signal wires; the closer wire will couple with the noise more strongly and the [[Common-mode rejection ratio|common-mode rejection]] of the receiver will fail to eliminate it. This problem is especially apparent in telecommunication cables where pairs in the same cable lie next to each other for many miles. One pair can induce [[crosstalk]] in another and it is additive along the length of the cable. Twisting the pairs counters this effect as on each half twist the wire nearest to the noise-source is exchanged. Providing the interfering source remains uniform, or nearly so, over the distance of a single twist, the induced noise will remain common-mode. Differential signaling also reduces [[electromagnetic radiation]] from the cable, along with the associated [[attenuation]] allowing for greater distance between exchanges. The twist rate (also called ''pitch'' of the twist, usually defined in twists per [[meter]]) makes up part of the specification for a given type of cable. Where nearby pairs have equal twist rates, the same conductors of the different pairs may repeatedly lie next to each other, partially undoing the benefits of differential mode. For this reason it is commonly specified that, at least for cables containing small numbers of pairs, the twist rates must differ. In contrast to '''FTP''' ([[Foil (metal)|foil]]ed twisted pair) and '''STP''' (shielded twisted pair) cabling, '''UTP''' (unshielded twisted pair) cable is not surrounded by any shielding. It is the primary wire type for [[telephone]] usage and is very common for [[computer networking]], especially as [[patch cable]]s or temporary network connections due to the high flexibility of the cables. ==History== [[Image:WireTransposition.png|thumb|Wire transposition on top of pole]] The earliest telephones used telegraph lines, or open-wire [[single-wire earth return]] circuits. In the 1880s electric [[tram]]s were installed in many cities, which induced noise into these circuits. [[Lawsuit]]s being unavailing, the telephone companies converted to [[balanced circuit]]s, which had the incidental benefit of reducing [[attenuation]], hence increasing range. As electrical power distribution became more commonplace, this measure proved inadequate. Two wires, strung on either side of cross bars on [[utility pole]]s, shared the route with electrical [[power line]]s. Within a few years the growing use of electricity again brought an increase of interference, so engineers devised a method called [[Transposition (telecommunications)|wire transposition]], to cancel out the interference. In wire transposition, the wires exchange position once every several poles. In this way, the two wires would receive similar EMI from power lines. This represented an early implementation of twisting, with a twist rate of about four twists per [[kilometre]], or six per [[mile]]. Such open-wire balanced lines with periodic transpositions still survives today in some rural areas. Twisted pair cables were invented by [[Alexander Graham Bell]] in 1881.<ref> {{Citation | inventor1-last = Bell | inventor1-first = Alexander Graham | title = Telephone-circuit | issue-date = 1881 | patent-number = 244426 | country-code = US }}. See also TIFF format scans for [http://patimg1.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=00244426&idkey=NONE USPTO 00244426] </ref> By 1900, the entire American [[telephone line]] network was either twisted pair or open wire with transposition to guard against interference. Today, most of the millions of kilometres of twisted pairs in the world are [[Outside plant|outdoor landlines]], owned by telephone companies, used for voice service, and only handled or even seen by telephone workers. ==Unshielded twisted pair (UTP)== [[File:UTP-cable.svg|thumb|Unshielded twisted pair]] UTP cables are found in many [[Ethernet]] networks and telephone systems. For indoor telephone applications, UTP is often grouped into sets of 25 pairs according to a standard [[25-pair color code]] originally developed by [[AT&T]]. A typical subset of these colors (white/blue, blue/white, white/orange, orange/white) shows up in most UTP cables. For urban outdoor telephone cables containing hundreds or thousands of pairs, the cable is divided into smaller but identical bundles. Each bundle consists of twisted pairs that have different twist rates. The bundles are in turn twisted together to make up the cable. Pairs having the same twist rate within the cable can still experience some degree of [[crosstalk]]. Wire pairs are selected carefully to minimize crosstalk within a large cable. [[Image:UTP cable.jpg|thumb|left|Unshielded twisted pair cable with different twist rates]] UTP [[cable]] is also the most common cable used in [[computer networking]]. Modern [[Ethernet]], the most common data networking standard, utilizes UTP cables. Twisted pair cabling is often used in data networks for short and medium length connections because of its relatively lower costs compared to [[optical fiber]] and [[coaxial cable]]. UTP is also finding increasing use in [[video]] applications, primarily in [[security camera]]s. Many [[prosumer|middle]] to [[high-end]] cameras include a UTP output with [[setscrew]] [[screw terminal|terminal]]s. This is made possible by the fact that UTP cable [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] has improved to match the [[baseband]] of [[television]] signals. While the [[video recorder]] most likely still has unbalanced [[BNC connector]]s for standard coaxial cable, a [[balun]] is used to convert from 100-[[ohm]] balanced UTP to 75-ohm unbalanced. A balun can also be used at the camera end for ones without a UTP output. Only one pair is necessary for each video signal. {{clear}} ==Cable shielding== {{cleanup|date=January 2011}} {{main|Electromagnetic shielding}} [[Image:FTP cable3.jpg|thumb|left|S/UTP, also known as FTP]] [[File:STP-cable.svg|thumb|STP cable format]] [[Image:TwistedPair S-FTP.jpg|thumb|left|S/STP, also known as S/FTP.]] [[File:S-UTP-cable.svg|thumb|S/UTP cable format]] [[File:S-STP-cable.svg|thumb|S/STP cable format]] Twisted pair cables are often shielded
