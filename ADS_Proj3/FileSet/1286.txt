By default, EasyInstall looks in the [[Python Package Index]] (PyPI) for the desired packages and uses the metadata there to download and install the package and its dependencies. It is also hosted itself on the PyPI. '''Python Eggs''' are a way of bundling additional information with a [[Python (programming language)|Python]] project, that allows the project's dependencies to be checked and satisfied at runtime, as well as allowing projects to provide [[plugins]] for other projects. {{quote|"Eggs are to Pythons as [[JAR (file format)|Jars]] are to Java..."|http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/PythonEggs}} == See also == * [[Python Package Manager]] - Binary package manager for Python from [[ActiveState]] * [[RubyGems]] - similar Ruby package manager == References == {{reflist}} == External links == *[http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools PyPI project page] *[http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall EasyInstall documentation] *[http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools setuptools documentation] *[http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/PythonEggs Python Eggs] [[Category:Package management systems]] {{compu-lang-stub}} [[es:EasyInstall]] [[pt:EasyInstall]]</text> </page> <page> <id>11604</id> <title>Eats Media, LLC</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=February 2009}} {{Infobox_Company | company_name = Eats Media, LLC. | company_type = [[Private company|Private]]| foundation = 2002| location = [[New York, New York|New York, NY]]| key_people = Joe Ariel, [[Chief executive officer|CEO]]; Jonathan Mark, Vice President of Marketing; Jon Gershman, Director of Sales| industry = Restaurant listings, ratings and reviews| products = Eats.com, Eats Magazine, College Eats, Eats TV| homepage = [http://www.eats.com/ www.eats.com]| }} '''Eats Media''' is a company that provides dining and restaurant information through a variety of different media vehicles.
