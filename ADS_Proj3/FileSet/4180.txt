By combining many such measurements, a [[best fit]] value for the light time per unit distance is obtained. {{As of|2009}}, the best estimate, as approved by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU), is:<ref name="Pitjeva09"> {{cite journal |last1=Pitjeva |first1=EV |last2=Standish |first2=EM |year=2009 |title=Proposals for the masses of the three largest asteroids, the Moon-Earth mass ratio and the Astronomical Unit |journal=[[Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy]] |volume=103 |issue=4 |pages=365–372 |doi=10.1007/s10569-009-9203-8 }}</ref><ref name="IAU"> {{cite web |author=IAU Working Group on Numerical Standards for Fundamental Astronomy |title=IAU WG on NSFA Current Best Estimates |url=http://maia.usno.navy.mil/NSFA/CBE.html |publisher=[[US Naval Observatory]] |accessdate=2009-09-25 }}</ref> :light time for unit distance: {{val|499.004783836|(10)|u=s}} :''c'' = {{val|0.00200398880410|(4)|u=AU/s}} = {{val|173.144632674|(3)|u=AU/day.}} The relative uncertainty in these measurements is 0.02 parts per billion (2{{e|-11}}), equivalent to the uncertainty in Earth-based measurements of length by interferometry.<ref> {{cite web |title=NPL's Beginner's Guide to Length |url=http://www.npl.co.uk/educate-explore/posters/length/length-%28poster%29 |publisher=[[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|UK National Physical Laboratory]] |accessdate=2009-10-28 }}</ref>{{#tag:ref|The value of the speed of light in [[Astronomical system of units|astronomical units]] has a measurement uncertainty, unlike the value in SI units, because of the different definitions of the unit of length.|group=Note}} Since the metre is defined to be the length travelled by light in a certain time interval, the measurement of the light time for unit distance can also be interpreted as measuring the length of an AU in metres.{{#tag:ref|Nevertheless, at this degree of precision, the effects of [[general relativity]] must be taken into consideration when interpreting the length.

This is the working principle behind the [[Fizeau–Foucault apparatus]] developed by [[Hippolyte Fizeau]] and [[Léon Foucault]]. [[File:Fizeau.JPG|thumb|right|Diagram of the [[Fizeau–Foucault apparatus|Fizeau apparatus]]|alt=A light ray passes horizontally through a half-mirror and a rotating cog wheel, is reflected back by a mirror, passes through the cog wheel, and is reflected by the half-mirror into a monocular.]] The setup as used by Fizeau consists of a beam of light directed at a mirror {{convert|8|km|mi|0}} away. On the way from the source to the mirror, the beam passes through a rotating cogwheel. At a certain rate of rotation, the beam passes through one gap on the way out and another on the way back, but at slightly higher or lower rates, the beam strikes a tooth and does not pass through the wheel. Knowing the distance between the wheel and the mirror, the number of teeth on the wheel, and the rate of rotation, the speed of light can be calculated.<ref name=How>{{cite web |last=Gibbs |first=P |year=1997 |title=How is the speed of light measured? |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SpeedOfLight/measure_c.html |work=Usenet Physics FAQ |publisher=University of California, Riverside |accessdate=2010-01-13 }}</ref> The method of Foucault replaces the cogwheel by a rotating mirror. Because the mirror keeps rotating while the light travels to the distant mirror and back, the light is reflected from the rotating mirror at a different angle on its way out than it is on its way back. From this difference in angle, the known speed of rotation and the distance to the distant mirror the speed of light may be calculated.<ref>{{cite web |last=Fowler |first=M |date= |title=The Speed of Light |url=http://galileoandeinstein.physics.virginia.edu/lectures/spedlite.html |publisher=[[University of Virginia]] |accessdate=2010-04-21 }}</ref> Nowadays, using [[oscilloscopes]] with time resolutions of less than one nanosecond, the speed of light can be directly measured by timing the delay of a light pulse from a laser or an LED reflected from a mirror. This method is less precise (with errors of the order of 1%) than other modern techniques, but it is sometimes used as a laboratory experiment in college physics classes.<ref> {{cite journal |last=Cooke |first=J |last2=Martin |first2=M |last3=McCartney |first3=H |last4=Wilf |first4=B |year=1968 |title=Direct determination of the speed of light as a general physics laboratory experiment |journal=[[American Journal of Physics]] |volume=36 |issue=9 |page=847 |doi=10.1119/1.1975166 }}</ref><ref> {{cite journal |last=Aoki |first=K |last2=Mitsui |first2=T |year=2008 |title=A small tabletop experiment for a direct measurement of the speed of light |journal=[[American Journal of Physics]] |volume=76 |issue=9 |pages=812–815 |doi=10.1119/1.2919743 |id={{arxiv|0705.3996}} }}</ref><ref> {{cite journal |last=James |first=MB |last2=Ormond |first2=RB |last3=Stasch |first3=AJ |year=1999 |title=Speed of light measurement for the myriad |journal=[[American Journal of Physics]] |volume=67 |issue=8 |pages=681–714 |doi=10.1119/1.19352 }}</ref>{{clr}} ===Electromagnetic constants=== An option for measuring ''c'' that does not directly depend on the propagation of electromagnetic waves is to use relation between ''c'' and the [[vacuum permittivity]] ''ε''<sub>0</sub> [[vacuum permeability]] ''μ''<sub>0</sub> established by Maxwell theory: ''c''<sup>2</sup> = 1/(''ε''<sub>0</sub>''μ''<sub>0</sub>).

The value of ''c'' can then be found by using the relation ''c'' = ''fλ''. One option is to measure the resonance
