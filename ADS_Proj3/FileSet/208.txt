His unwed mother died in childbirth and he was raised by his aunts in [[Tunoshna]] near [[Yaroslavl]] at the estate of his grandfather, a wealthy nobleman. His father, an [[agronomist]] by trade, was deported from [[Saint-Petersburg]] for participation in the revolutionary movement. He disappeared and was presumed to have been killed in the [[Russian Civil War]]. Kolmogorov was educated in his aunt's village school, and his earliest literary efforts and mathematical papers were printed in the school newspaper. As an adolescent he designed [[perpetual motion]] machines, concealing their (necessary) defects so cleverly that his secondary-school teachers could not discover them. In 1910, his aunt adopted him and then they moved to Moscow, where he went to a [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]], graduating from it in 1920. In 1920, Kolmogorov began to study at the [[Moscow State University]] and the Chemistry Technological Institute. Kolmogorov gained a reputation for his wide-ranging erudition. As an undergraduate, he participated in the seminars of the Russian historian S.V. Bachrushin, and he published his first research paper on the [[Landowner|landholding]] practices in the [[Novgorod|Novgorod Republic]] in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.<ref>David Salsburg, ''The Lady Tasting Tea: How Statistics Revolutionized Science in the Twentieth Century,'' New York, W. H. Freeman, 2001; pp. 137&ndash;50.</ref> At the same time (1921&ndash;1922), Kolmogorov derived and proved several results in [[set theory]] and in the theory of [[Fourier series]] (trigonometrical series). ===Maturity=== In 1922 Kolmogorov constructed a [[Convergence of Fourier series|Fourier series that diverges]] [[almost everywhere]], gaining international recognition. Around this time he decided to devote his life to [[mathematics]]. In 1925 Kolmogorov graduated from [[Moscow State University]], and began to study under the supervision of [[Nikolai Luzin]]. He made lifelong friends with [[Pavel Alexandrov]] who involved Kolmogorov in 1936 in an ugly political persecution of their common teacher, the so-called [[Luzin case]] or [[Luzin affair]]. Kolmogorov (together with [[Khinchin|A. Khinchin]]) became interested in [[probability theory]]. Also in 1925, he published his famous work in [[intuitionistic logic]] &mdash; ''On the principle of the excluded middle''. In 1929 Kolmogorov earned his Doctor of Philosophy degree, [[Ph.D.]], at the [[Moscow State University]]. In 1930, Kolmogorov went on his first long trip abroad, traveling to [[Göttingen]] and [[Munich]], Germany, and then to Paris, France. His pioneering work ''About the Analytical Methods of Probability Theory'' was published (in German) in 1931. Also in 1931, he became a professor at Moscow University. In 1933, Kolmogorov published the book, ''Foundations of the Theory of Probability'', laying the modern axiomatic [[probability axioms|foundations of probability theory]] and establishing his reputation as the world's leading living expert in this field. In 1935, Kolmogorov became the
