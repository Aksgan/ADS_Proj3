many wavelets there is no nice analytical formula for describing these harmonic spherical wavelets. The low-pass filter associated to Legendre [[multiresolution analysis]] is a [[finite impulse response]] filter (FIR). Wavelets associated to finite impulse response filters (FIR) are commonly preferred in most applications.<ref name=Colomer/> An extra appealing feature is that the Legendre filters are ''linear phase'' FIR (i.e. multiresolution analysis associated with [[linear phase]] filters). These wavelets have been implemented on MATLAB (wavelet toolbox). Although being compactly supported wavelet, legdN are not orthogonal (but for ''N'' = 1).<ref>Herley and Vetterli</ref> == Legendre multiresolution filters == Associated Legendre polynomials are the colatitudinal part of the spherical harmonics which are common to all separations of Laplace's equation in spherical polar coordinates.<ref name=Gradsh/> The radial part of the solution varies from one potential to another, but the harmonics are always the same and are a consequence of spherical symmetry.

The minus signal can be suppressed. == MATLAB implementation of Legendre wavelets == Legendre wavelets can be easily loaded into the [[MATLAB]] wavelet toolbox -- The m-files to allow the computation of Legendre wavelet transform, details and filter are (freeware) available. The finite support width Legendre family is denoted by legd (short name). Wavelets: 'legdN'. The parameter ''N'' in the legdN family is found according to 2''N''=<math>\nu</math>+1 (length of the MRA filters). <br /> Legendre wavelets can be derived from the low-pass reconstruction filter by an iterative procedure (the [[cascade algorithm]]). The wavelet has compact support and finite impulse response AMR filters (FIR) are used (table 1). The first wavelet of the Legendre's family is exactly the well-known [[Haar wavelet]]. Figure 2 shows an emerging pattern that progressively looks like the wavelet's shape. <br /> [[Image:Figura legd2.jpg|thumb|none|500px|'''Figure 2 - Shape of Legendre Wavelets of degree <math>\nu</math>=3 (legd2) derived after 4 and 8 iteration of the cascade algorithm, respectively.
