diagrams, which have some connoted model data, and the UML tool derives from the diagrams parts or all of the [[source code]] for the software system. In some tools, the user can provide a skeleton of the program source code, in the form of a source code [[template]] where predefined tokens are then replaced with program source code parts during the code generation process. There is some debate among software developers about how useful code generation as such is {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. It certainly depends on the specific problem domain and how far code generation should be applied. There are well known areas where code generation is an established practice, not limited to the field of UML. The idea of completely leaving the "code level" and starting to do "programming" directly from the UML diagram level (i.e., design level) is quite debated among developers {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. That is the vision for [[Model-driven architecture]] (MDA). This idea is not in such widespread use compared to other [[software development]] tools like [[compiler]]s or [[Configuration management|software configuration management systems]]. An often cited criticism is that the UML diagrams lack the detail that is needed to contain the same information as is covered with the program source: Jack W. Reeves states that the final embodiment of the design lies in the source code. (His often quoted statement that "the Code ''is'' the design" <ref>http://www.developerdotstar.com/mag/articles/reeves_design_main.html by Jack W. Reeves</ref> has been misinterpreted to mean that there is no need for intermediate- and high-level software-design artefacts, such as UML diagrams or software-requirements documents: Reeves only points out that there is a limit to how much the design of such artefacts can help in creating a working product, and that ultimately all design processes must be validated through the creation of operational code.) ====Reverse engineering==== ''Reverse engineering'' in this context means, that the UML tool reads program source code as input and ''derives'' model data and corresponding graphical UML diagrams from it (as opposed to the somewhat broader meaning described in the article "[[Reverse engineering]]"). Some of the challenges of reverse engineering are: * The source code often has much more detailed information than one would want to see in design diagrams. This problem is addressed by [http://www.sei.cmu.edu/architecture/research/reconstruction/ software architecture reconstruction]. * Diagram data is normally not contained with the program source, such that the UML tool, at least in the initial step, has to create some ''random layout'' of the graphical symbols of the UML notation or use some automatic ''[[layout algorithm]]'' to place the symbols in a way that the user can understand the diagram. For example, the symbols should be placed at such locations on the drawing pane that they don't overlap. Usually, the user of such a functionality of a UML tool has to manually edit those automatically generated diagrams to attain some meaningfulness. It also often doesn't make sense to draw diagrams of the whole program source, as that represents just too much detail to be of interest at the level of the UML diagrams. * There are language features of some [[programming language]]s, like ''class-'' or ''function templates'' of the [[C++]] programming language, which are notoriously hard to convert automatically to UML diagrams in their full complexity. ===Model and Diagram Interchange=== [[XML Metadata Interchange]] (XMI) is the format for UML model interchange. XMI does not support [[UML Diagram Interchange]], which allows you to import UML diagrams from one model to another. ===Model Transformation=== A key concept associated with the [[Model-driven architecture]] initiative is the capacity to transform a model into another model. For example, one might want to transform a platform-independent domain model into a Java platform-specific model for implementation. It is also possible to refactor UML models to produce more concise and well-formed UML models. Finally, it is possible to generate UML models from other modeling notations, such as [[BPMN]]. The standard that supports this is called [[QVT]] for Queries/Views/Transformations. One example of an open-source [[QVT]]-solution is the [[ATLAS Transformation Language|ATL]] language built by [[INRIA]]. ==See also== *[[List of UML tools]] *[[Model Driven Engineering]] *[[QVT]] *[[ATLAS Transformation Language|ATL]] *[[Meta-modeling|Metamodeling]] * Java to UML Sequence Diagram ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== *{{dmoz|Computers/Programming/Methodologies/Modeling_Languages/Unified_Modeling_Language/Tools/|UML Tools}}. *[http://www.umltools.net/ UML Tools Directory] *[http://case-tools.org/ UML CASE Tools] *[http://www.UML-Forum.com/tools.htm UML Tools listed on UML Forum web] *[http://www.easyumleditor.com EasyUML Editor] A web-based editor that generates UML Diagram from text notation. {{DEFAULTSORT:Uml Tool}} [[Category:UML tools| ]] [[Category:Unified Modeling Language]] [[de:UML-Werkzeug]] [[es:Herramienta UML]] {{uml-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>38597</id> <title>UMart</title> <text>{{Infobox Company | company_name = Umart Online | company_type = [[Private company|Private]] | foundation = [[2000]] | location = Milton, [[Queensland]], [[Australia]] | industry = Online Retail Sales | products = [[Computer Hardware]], [[Computer Software]], [[Consumer Electronics]]| homepage = [http://www.umart.com.au www.umart.com.au] }} '''UMart Online''' is an Australian computer store chain headquartered in Brisbane, Queensland. The company was founded in June 2000<ref>[http://www.asic.gov.au ASIC]</ref> and in 2002 was recognised as one of Australia's most popular computer retailers by [[PC User]] magazine.<ref name="pcuser-mostpop">http://www.pcuser.com.au/pcuser/hs2.nsf/lookup+1/CF04F8BCD8EE98D0CA256BB5004BCB10 PC User reader submission poll for computer stores</ref>. In 2009 Umart Online opened a store in [[Melbourne, Victoria]] – its first store outside of Queensland. UMart focuses on moving large quantities of goods and for that reason sells primarily products that have a lot of demand and high turnover; they primarily sell [[computer hardware]], [[computer software]], and some [[consumer electronics]] products. Online ordering is encouraged, with competitive discounts (usually to the sum of AU$10) offered on every products' [[Suggested retail price|recommended retail price]] for making a purchase via the [[Online shopping|Internet store]].<ref name="discount">{{cite web |url=http://www.umart.com.au/newindex2.phtml?bid=5 |title=UMart Brisbane Homepage}}</ref> UMart Online was involved in a legal battle with Sydney based umart.net.au, which was forced to change its name to IJK (www.ijk.com.au) as a result of losing the case in court.{{Fact|date=October 2008}} ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.umart.com.au UMart Online] [[Category:Commerce websites]] [[Category:Computer hardware]] [[Category:Information technology companies of Australia]] [[Category:Online retail companies of Australia]] {{Australia-company-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>38601</id> <title>UNISURF</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=November 2007}} ''' UNISURF''', developed by [[Pierre Bézier]] at [[Renault]] in 1971, was a pioneering surface CAD CAM system for car body design and tooling. {{compu-graphics-stub}}
