[[Lifehacker]] ran an article about it, saying "App Runner would come in handy" and "there's plenty of scripts and closed-source apps that this would be useful for".<ref>[http://lifehacker.com/5224675/app-runner-makes-launching-linux-executables-easier lifehacker.com/5224675/app-runner-makes-launching-linux-executables-easier]</ref> ===Live USB=== There is a Windows tool called ''cd2usb'' to create [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] and ''Super OS'' [[Live USB]]s. The program is included in the DVD of ''Super OS''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} ===RUNZ Framework=== The ''RUNZ Framework'' is a tool that allows the use of [[portable apps]] and something called ''SuperDebs'' (an installer with a .deb file + its dependencies that can be installed offline, created by ''SuperDeb Creator'') in ''Super OS''.

It was released in the European and North American markets, with a limited release in Japan due to a lack of consumer demand. It is a [[wireless]] gun and uses an [[infrared]] receiver which plugs into the right port of the console, comparable to the [[Menacer]] for the [[Mega Drive|Sega Mega Drive/Genesis]]. It has two action buttons, a pause button, a power switch and is powered by six [[AA battery|AA batteries]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamersgraveyard.com/repository/snes/peripherals/superscope.html |title=Super Scope |accessdate=2007-05-11}}</ref> ==Physical description== The gun body is a [[bazooka]]-shaped device, just under 2½ feet long. Located about midway on top of the barrel are two buttons, the orange "Fire" button and the grey "Pause" button, and a switch used to turn the Super Scope off or select regular or turbo mode. In the middle on either side are two clips for attaching the sight. On the far end of the gun, on the bottom, is a six inch grip with another button labeled "Cursor". On the end is the infrared transmitter and the lens, approximately {{convert|1|in|mm|0}} in diameter, which picks up the light from a TV. The sight mount is shaped like a wide, very shallow "U", about five inches long. The end that faces toward the shoulder mount end of the Super Scope has a round open cylinder holder, where the eyepiece goes. The other end has a short, narrow tube, which forms the sight when one looks through the eyepiece that is in-line across from it. The end of the eyepiece is very simple: it is a cylinder with the diameter of a quarter,
