[[Academic publishing]] is the process of placing the results of one's [[research]] into the literature. [[science|Scientific]] [[research]] on original work initially published in [[scientific journal]]s is called [[primary literature]]. Patents and [[technical report]]s, for minor research results and engineering and design work (including computer software) can also be considered primary literature. [[Secondary source]]s include articles in [[review journals]] (which provide a synthesis of research articles on a topic to highlight advances and new lines of research), and [[book]]s for large projects, broad arguments, or compilations of articles. [[Tertiary source]]s might include [[encyclopedia]]s and similar works intended for broad public consumption. == Types of scientific publications == Scientific literature can include the following kinds of publications: * scientific articles published in [[scientific journal]]s * [[patent]]s specialized for science and technology (for example, [[biological patent]]s and [[chemical patent]]s) * [[book]]s wholly written by one or a small number of co-[[author]]s * books, where each [[chapter (books)|chapter]] is the responsibility of a different author or set of authors, though the [[editing|editor]] may take some responsibility for ensuring consistency of style and content * presentations at [[academic conference]]s, especially those organized by [[learned society|learned societies]] * [[government]] reports such as a [[forensic investigation]] conducted by a government agency such as the [[NTSB]] * scientific publications on the [[World Wide Web]] * books, [[technical report]]s, [[pamphlet]]s, and [[working paper]]s issued by individual researchers or research organisations on their own initiative; these are sometimes organised into a series The significance of these different components of the literature varies between disciplines and has changed over time. {{As of|2006}}, peer-reviewed journal articles remain the predominant publication type, and have the highest prestige. However, journals vary enormously in their prestige and importance, and the value of a published article depends on the journal. The significance of books, also called [[research monograph]]s depends on the subject. Generally books published by university presses are usually considered more prestigious than those published by commercial presses. The status of working papers and [[conference proceeding]]s depends on the discipline; they are typically more important in the applied sciences. The value of publication as a [[preprint]] or scientific report on the web has in the past been low, but in some subjects, such as [[mathematics]] or [[high energy physics]], it is now an accepted alternative. For further information about these formats, see the corresponding article. ==Preparation of an article== The actual day-to-day records of scientific information are kept in research notebooks or logbooks. These are usually kept indefinitely as the basic evidence of the work, and are often kept in duplicate, signed, notarized, and archived. The purpose is to preserve the evidence for scientific priority, and in particular for priority for obtaining patents. They have also been used in scientific disputes. Since the availability of computers, the notebooks in some data-intensive fields have been kept as database records, and appropriate software is commercially available. <ref>{{Cite conference | publisher = IEEE Computer Society | doi = http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ISCST.2005.1553305 | isbn = 0-7695-2387-0 | volume = 0 | pages = 136â€“143 | last = Talbott | first = T. | coauthors = M.

In some fields both are used, with preliminary reports, working papers, or [[preprint]]s followed by a formal article. Articles are usually prepared at the end of a project, or at the end of components of a particularly large one. In preparing such an article vigorous rules for [[scientific writing]] have to be followed. ==Clear communication and impact factor== {{see also|Impact factor|Copy editing}} Often, scientific advancement depends upon publishing in high-impact journals, which especially in hard and applied sciences are usually published in English. Consequently, scientists with poor English writing skills are at a disadvantage when trying to publish in these journals, regardless of the quality of the scientific study itself.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Pan, Z|title=Crossing the language limitations|journal=PLos Medicine |volume=3|pages=E410|date=2006|pmid=17002510|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030410|last2=Gao|first2=J|issue=9|pmc=1576334}}</ref> Yet many international universities require publication in these high-impact journals by both their students and faculty. One way that some international authors are beginning to overcome this problem is by contracting with freelance medical copy editors who are native speakers of English and specialize in ESL (English as a second language) editing to polish their manuscripts' English to a level that high-impact journals will accept. ==Authorship== ===The nature of the content=== A scientific article has a standardized structure, which varies only slightly in different subjects. Ultimately, it is not the format that is important, but what lies behind it - the content. However, several key formatting requirements need to be met: #The title should be concise and indicate the contents of the article. #The names and affiliation of all authors are given. In the wake of some [[scientific misconduct]] cases, publishers often require that all co-authors know and agree on the content of the article.<ref>[[Scientific fraud#Responsibility of authors and of coauthors]]</ref> #The first part is normally an [[abstract (summary)|abstract]]; this is a one-paragraph summary of the work, and is intended to serve as a guide for determining if the articles is pertinent, and to furnish [[subject metadata]] for indexing services. # The format should be archival, in the sense that [[library|libraries]] should be able to store and catalogue the documents and scientists years later should be able to recover any document in order to study
