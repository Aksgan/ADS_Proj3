the PDPC is applied to the bottom level tasks on those diagrams. ==Methodology== From the bottom level of some activity box, the PDPC adds levels for: # identifying what can go wrong (failure mode or risks) # consequences of that failure (effect or consequence) # possible countermeasures (risk mitigation action plan) ==Similar techniques== The PDPC is similar to the [[failure mode and effects analysis]] (FMEA) in that both identify risks, consequences of failure, and contingency actions. The FMEA adds prioritized risk levels through rating relative risk for each potential failure point. ==References== {{Unreferenced|date=October 2008}} == Further reading == *{{cite book | last = Tague | first = Nancy | title = The Quality Toolbox | publisher = ASQ Quality Press | date = 2004 | pages = 428–430 | isbn = 0-87389-639-4 }} *{{cite book | last = Goal QPC | first = David | title = The Memory Jogger II… | publisher = Goal QPC Press | date = 1994 | pages = 160–162 | isbn = 1-879364-44-1 }} [[Category:Charts]] [[Category:Disaster management tools]] [[Category:Failure]] [[Category:Futurology]] [[Category:Reliability engineering]] [[Category:Risk analysis]]</text> </page> <page> <id>30119</id> <title>Process optimization</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=June 2008}} '''Process optimization''' is the discipline of adjusting a process so as to optimize some specified set of parameters without violating some constraint. The most common goals are minimizing cost, maximizing throughput, and/or efficiency. This is one of the major [[quantitative property|quantitative]] tools in industrial decision making. When optimizing a process, the goal is to maximize one or more of the process specifications, while keeping all others within their constraints. == Areas == Fundamentally, there are three parameters that can be adjusted to affect optimal performance. They are: * [[Equipment]] optimization The first step is to verify that the existing equipment is being used to its fullest advantage by examining operating data to identify equipment bottlenecks. * Operating procedures Operating procedures may vary widely from person-to-person or from shift-to-shift. Automation of the plant can help significantly. But automation will be of no help if the operators take control and run the plant in manual. * Control optimization In a typical processing plant, such as a [[chemical plant]] or [[oil refinery]], there are hundreds or even thousands of control loops. Each control loop is responsible for controlling one part of the process, such as maintaining a temperature, level, or flow. If the [[control loop]] is not properly designed and tuned, the process runs below its optimum. The process will be more expensive to operate, and equipment will wear out prematurely. For each control loop to run optimally, identification of sensor, valve, and tuning problems is important. It has been well documented that over 35% of control loops typically have problems.{{Fact|date=June 2008}} The process of continuously monitoring and optimizing the entire plant is sometimes called performance supervision. == See also == * [[Calculation of glass properties]], optimization of several properties * [[Deficit irrigation]] to optimize water productivity * [[Metallurgical Process Optimization]] * [[Process simulation]] ==External links== * [http://www.expertune.com/r2.asp?f=Wikipedia&l=learncast.html Tutorials on Process Optimization] * [http://Nutek-us.com/wp-txt.html Reference TEXTBOOKS on Taguchi Methods] * [http://rtime.felk.cvut.cz/scheduling-toolbox TORSCHE Scheduling Toolbox for Matlab] is a freely available toolbox of scheduling and graph algorithms.

In tomography the [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] distribution of some physical quantity in the object is determined. There is a widespread need to get tomographic information about process. This information can be used, for example, in the design and control of processes. Tomography involves taking measurements around the periphery of an object (e.g. process vessel or patient) to determine what is going on inside. The best known technique is [[CAT]] scanning in [[medicine]], however process tomography instrumentation needs to be cheaper, faster and more robust. Many different imaging methods are used in process tomography, e.g. [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasonic imaging]], [[positron emission tomography]] (PET), [[electrical resistance tomography]] (ERT) and [[electrical impedance tomography]] (EIT), [[electrical capacitance tomography]] (ECT), [[magnetic induction tomography]] (MIT). In all cases external sensors are used to detect signals from boundary of the object, and the three dimensional material distribution or the velocity field is computed using the measured data. Process tomography is an area of rapid growth both in terms of research and applications. There are number of challenges remaining in this area including data processing an image reconstruction [2], and application of imaging modalities in a real applications. == References == {{reflist}} * York, T., 2001.

The name [[Procrustes]] refers to a bandit from Greek mythology who made his victims fit his bed either by stretching their limbs or cutting them off. ==Background== Here we just consider objects made up from a finite number ''k'' of points in ''n'' dimensions, these points are called [[landmark point]]s. The shape of object can be considered as a member of an [[equivalence class]] formed by removing the [[translation (geometry)|translational]], [[rotation (mathematics)|rotational]] and [[scaling (geometry)|scaling]] components. For example, translational components can be removed from an object by translating the object so that the [[mean]] of all the points lies at the origin. Likewise the scale component can be removed by scaling the object so that the sum of the squared distances from the points to the origin is 1. Mathematically: take <math>k</math> points in two dimensions, say :<math>((x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_k,y_k))\,</math>. The mean of these points is <math>(\bar{x},\bar{y})</math> where :<math>\bar{x} = \frac{x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_k}{k},\quad \bar{y} = \frac{y_1+y_2+\cdots+y_k}{k}.</math> Now translate these points so that the mean is translated to the origin <math>(x,y)\to(x-\bar{x},y-\bar{y})</math>, giving the point <math>(x_1-\bar{x},y_1-\bar{y}),\dots</math>. Likewise scale can be removed by finding the size of the object :<math>s=\sqrt{(x_1-\bar{x})^2+(y_1-\bar{y})^2+\cdots}</math> and dividing the points by
