warfare tactics. The rest of the galaxy, which once regarded our solar system as relatively peaceful by its own standards, now referred to it in new terms. Loosely translated they meant "Place of the Bloody Metal" or "Place of the Soul-less Conflict." To the weapons contractors' programmers, however, the war had a different name. Since the companies were too valuable, the programmers, freed from fear of destruction, could watch the battles with an evil joy. They didn't care about the human aspect of war. They instead competed with themselves to develop the best MECH artificial intelligences. To them, the war was called "MechMania." With the end of the clans' war the battle-scarred MECH systems were locked away in vaults with the naive hope they'd never see action again. Out of sight, out of mind. Humanity prospered in peace. ---- One day a salvage team from the financially desperate Nimbus Terraform Corporation stumbled across a forgotten vault and, despite interplanetary treaties outlawing intrusion, sent an experienced survey crew to investigate. As the survey crew entered the musty, forlorn bunker it marvelled at its size. Damaged spacefighters, plasma-scarred pulse laser cannons, and giant quantum generators lined corridor after corridor. It was quite a find, yet although the team knew no one had set foot in the vault for decades it couldn't help but feel the presence of something more menacing eyeing its movements. Accidentally triggering a proximity sensor, the team powered up backup vault power systems. The original MECH programmers accomplished many miracles in their designs. Genetic algorithms, trillions of synthetic neurons, and hyper-advanced heuristics harmonized in wonderful elegance. MECHs could function with near complete autonomy back in the war. What no one bargained for was the MECHs' ability to learn--even without human intervention! Even under reserve power the MECH systems' sythetic brains grew in capacity; their only goals: continued war and revenge. The survey crew was never heard from again. Instead the salvage team radioed frightening video footage back to its parent company. Battle-hardened, century-old MECH systems tore apart their titanium-reinforced concrete graves. Intelligent or no, the look of determination and hatred in their optics was unmistakable. Locating other vaults across the solar system, the MECHs revived allies and fought rival MECH systems with the weapons their original human pilots had unknowingly taught them to use. Only the strongest survived for the final conflict. Thus MechMania began once again!

Driven by an abundance of materials, a demand for consumer goods and the military-industrial complex, humanity expanded into the cosmos at a break-neck pace. Star system after star system was colonized and terraformed, asteroid belts were carved up for their vast stores of vinyl, and factories the size of planets churned out a bewildering array of products that the teeming quadrillions swarmed over like ants in a sugar bowl. But it couldn't last; the stream of mega-transports that once moved trillions of tons daily now only moved billions, and then millions, and finally slowed to almost a trickle. Deprived of their revenue stream, the tera-corporations expanded into the energy market. In what later became known as the "Energy Wars", the corporations fought for control of the power transmission stations on the few energy rich worlds with their "Mechs"-- giant intelligent war machines almost as insane as their poorly-socialized masters. But when the dust settled the situation had not improved. The ravenous consumer culture demanded materials, and none were to be found. Factories went dark, and runs on soft drink dispensers decimated the caffeine supply. In desperation, the corporations turned control of the galactic economy over to modified Mech control systems, hoping that the maniacal intelligence that had served them so well in the Energy Wars could find a way to allocate the scarce resources so all could profit. But it was too late. A clever corporation (whose name has been obliterated from the few remaining historical documents) sent spies to infiltrate and sabotage the computer systems the Mech brains used to communicate with each other, and the final effort to stabilize the economy failed. What followed was a hundred years of chaos. Lacking materials and energy, space travel ground to a halt, with only a handful of hardy traders risking the distances between the stars. Flung back into the Dark Ages and cut off from civilization, slowly the shattered worlds started to rebuild. But all was not well. Scattered across a dozen worlds, secret societies of "hawk-urz"--heirs of the original Mech designers of a century ago--planned for the time when they would again ply the space-lanes and command the most powerful armies of Mechs the galaxy had ever seen. Their time has come. ===Languages and tools=== * Client for contestants: [[C++]] * Server: [[C++]] ==2003 - MechMania IX: "The Age of the Adamas"== [[Image:mmix logo.jpg|thumb|MMIX logo]] * Sponsor: Michigan Economic Development Corporation * Website: http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/mechmania/2003/ ===Story=== The Age of the Adamas.
