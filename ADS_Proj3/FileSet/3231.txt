It provides the Kernel and Executive layers of the Windows NT kernel space, and is responsible for various system services such as hardware virtualization, process and memory management, etc., thus making it a fundamental part of the system. It contains the Cache Manager, the Executive, the Kernel, the Security Reference Monitor, the Memory Manager, and the Scheduler, among other things.<ref name="sysinternals">Russinovich, M: [http://web.archive.org/web/20080408141752/http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897446.aspx Systems Internals Tips and Trivia], ''SysInternals Information''</ref> == Startup == This system binary is not a [[Windows_library_files#Ntdll.dll|Native Application]] (in that it is not linked against '''ntdll.dll'''), instead containing a standard '''main''' entry point, a stub that calls the kernel initialization function but is unused as the [[Windows_NT_startup_process#Boot_loader_phase|OS loader]] (internal symbol OSLOADER) calls KiSystemStartup directly. <source lang="c"> // // NTOSKRNL main // int __cdecl main(IN PLOADER_PARAMETER_BLOCK LoaderBlock) { // // Fire up NT! // KiSystemStartup(LoaderBlock); return 0; } </source> While ntoskrnl.exe is not linked against ntdll.dll, it is linked against bootvid.dll, [[hal.dll]] and kdcom.dll.

In its current form, it is geared towards [[astrophysics]] data, which is generally point-like in nature meaning that most efficient analysis [[algorithms]] tend to employ [[tree data structure]]s. The idea behind ''N''Tropy, like most libraries, is that the derive the benefits of an efficient tree implementation and [[parallel computing]] without having to write a tree structure nor a parallel program from scratch. Instead, they take ''N''Tropy's existing tree structure and customize the data stored in each node to the needs of their application. Then they can write a serial piece of code that describes their tree walk algorithm. ''N''Tropy will then execute these tree walks in parallel on any sort of [[parallel computer]], from a [[Beowulf cluster]] to a [[Massively Parallel Processing]] computer (MPP) to machines in a [[computational grid]]. ''N''Tropy is being developed under a grant from [[NASA]]'s Applied Information Systems Research Program. ==External links== * [http://www.psc.edu/ntropy ''N''Tropy homepage] [[Category:Computer libraries]] [[Category:Application programming interfaces]] [[Category:Parallel computing]] {{soft-eng-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>26758</id> <title>NuPRL</title> <text>'''NuPRL''' is a higher-order proof development system developed at [[Cornell University]].

NuSMV has been developed as a joint project between [[ITC-IRST]] ([http://www.itc.it/ Istituto Trentino di Cultura], [http://www.itc.it/irst/ Istituto per la Ricerca Scientifica e Tecnologica] in [[Trento]], [[Italy]]), [[Carnegie Mellon University]], the [[University of Genoa]] and the [[University of Trento]]. It is a reimplementation and extension of SMV, the first model checker based on [[Binary Decision Diagrams]] (BDDs). The tool has been designed as an open architecture for model checking. It is aimed at reliable verification of industrially sized designs, for use as a backend for other verification tools and as a research tool for formal verification techniques. '''NuSMV 2''' is [[open source]] software written in [[C (programming language)|C]]. It combines [[Binary_decision_diagram | BDD]]-based model checking with [[Boolean satisfiability problem|SAT]]-based model checking. It is maintained by [http://www.fbk.eu Fondazione Bruno Kessler], the successor organization of ITC-IRST. == See also == * [[Spin Model Checker]] a general model checker for asynchronous software systems == External links == * [http://nusmv.fbk.eu/ NuSMV website] {{programming-software-stub}} [[Category:Model checkers]] [[Category:Free software programmed in C]]</text> </page> <page> <id>26761</id> <title>Nuance Communications</title> <text>{{Redirect|Visioneer|the film ''Visioneers''|Visioneers}} {{Mergefrom|Visioneer|date=July 2009}} {{Refimprove|date=June 2008}} {{Infobox Company |company_name=Nuance Communications, Inc. |company_logo=[[Image:Nuance-Communications-logo.png|150px]] |company_type=Public (NASDAQ: [http://quotes.nasdaq.com/asp/SummaryQuote.asp?symbol=NUAN&selected=NUAN NUAN]) |company_slogan=The experience speaks for itself |foundation=1992 as [[Visioneer]] |location=[[Burlington, Massachusetts]], [[USA]] |key_people=[[Chairman]] & [[CEO]]: [[Paul Ricci]] |num_employees=3,500+ (35 offices worldwide)<ref name="nuance.com">http://www.nuance.com/company/ir/faqs/</ref> |industry=[[Productivity applications]] |revenue=$1,118.9 million (FY2010)<ref>http://www.nuance.com/company/news-room/press-releases/NC_007738</ref> |products=[[Optical character recognition|OCR]], [[speech synthesis]], [[speech recognition]], [[PDF]], Consulting, Government Contracts |homepage=[http://www.nuance.com/ www.nuance.com] }} '''Nuance Communications''' is a [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] [[computer]] [[software]] technology [[corporation]], headquartered in [[Burlington, Massachusetts]], [[USA]], that provides speech and imaging applications. Current business products focus on server & embedded speech recognition, telephone call steering systems, automated telephone directory services, [[medical transcription]] software & systems, [[optical character recognition]] software, and desktop imaging software. The company also maintains a small division which does software and system development for military and government agencies. As of 2008, the company is a result of [[organic growth]], [[mergers]], and [[acquisitions]]. Most notable was the "merger" of ScanSoft and Nuance in October 2005. Before the merger, the two companies competed in the commercial large scale speech application business. The officially-termed "merger" was a de facto acquisition of Nuance by ScanSoft, though the combined company changed its name to Nuance following the transaction. Before 1999, ScanSoft was known as Visioneer, a hardware and software scanner company. In 1999, Visioneer bought ScanSoft &mdash; a [[Xerox]] spin-off &mdash; and adopted ScanSoft as the company name. The original ScanSoft had its roots in [[Raymond Kurzweil#Mid-life|Kurzweil Computer Products]], a software company that developed the first omni-font character recognition system. ==Company history== In September 2005, ScanSoft Inc. acquired and merged
