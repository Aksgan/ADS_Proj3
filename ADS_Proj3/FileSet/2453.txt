LGA stands for [[Land Grid Array]]. LGA 1156, along with [[LGA 1366]], was designed to replace [[LGA 775]]. LGA 1156 is very different from LGA 775. LGA 775 processors were connected to a [[northbridge (computing)|northbridge]] using the [[Front Side Bus]]. With LGA 1156, the features that were traditionally on a northbridge are integrated onto the processor. The LGA 1156 socket allows the following connections to be made from the processor to the rest of the system: * PCI-Express 2.0 x16 for communication with a graphics card. Some processors allow this connection to be divided into two x8 lanes to connect two graphics cards. Some motherboard manufacturers use [[Nvidia|Nvidia's]] NF200 chip to allow even more graphics cards to be used. * [[Direct Media Interface|DMI]] for communication with the [[Platform Controller Hub]] (PCH). This consists of a PCI-Express 2.0 x4 connection. * [[Flexible Display Interface|FDI]] for communication with the [[Platform Controller Hub|PCH]]. This consists of two [[DisplayPort]] connections. * Two memory channels for communication with DDR3 SDRAM. The clock speed of the memory that is supported will depend on the processor. ==Supported processors== {| class="wikitable" !

However, using a chip with integrated graphics on a P55 motherboard will (in addition to likely requiring a BIOS update) not allow use of the on-board graphics processor, and likewise, using a chip without integrated graphics on a H55, H57 or Q57 motherboard will not allow use of the motherboard's graphics ports.<ref>http://techreport.com/articles.x/18216/3</ref> ==Supported chipsets== The Desktop chipsets that support LGA 1156 are Intel's H55, H57, [[Intel P55|P55]], and Q57. Server chipsets supporting the socket are Intel's 3400, 3420 and 3450 ==See also== * [[List of Intel microprocessors]] * [[List of Intel Core i3 microprocessors]] * [[List of Intel Core i5 microprocessors]] * [[List of Intel Core i7 microprocessors]] * [[List_of_Intel_Pentium_microprocessors#.22Clarkdale.22_.2832_nm.29|List of Intel Pentium microprocessors]] * [[List_of_Intel_Celeron_microprocessors#Celeron.2C_.28dual-core.29_2|List of Intel Celeron microprocessors]] * [[List of Intel Xeon microprocessors]] * [[List of future Intel microprocessors]] * [[Clarkdale (microprocessor)]] * [[Lynnfield (microprocessor)]] * [[LGA 775]] * [[LGA 1366]] ==References== <references/> {{intelsock}} [[Category: CPU sockets|LGA 1156]] [[es:LGA 1156]] [[de:Sockel 1156]] [[fr:LGA1156]] [[it:LGA
