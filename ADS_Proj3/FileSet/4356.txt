There are varying levels of protection afforded by TRSMs: # '''Tamper-resistance:''' make intrusion difficult, usually by employing hardened casing # '''Tamper-evident:''' make intrusion attempts evident to subsequent viewers, often by employing seals which must be broken during intrusion # '''Tamper-responsive:''' detect the intrusion attempt and destroy the contents in the process A TRSM is usually also a [[Hardware security module]] (HSM).
