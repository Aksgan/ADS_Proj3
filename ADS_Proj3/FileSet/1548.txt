to an economic ''unit'' or its corresponding aggregate. What can be hypothetically derived (or rejected in some cases) is a ''stable'' equilibrium of the system. (This is an equilibrium of the system such that, if a variable disturbs equilibrium, the system converges to equilibrium.) ''Stability of equilibrium'' is proposed as the principal source of operationally meaningful theorems for economic systems (p. 5). Analogies from physics (and biology) are conspicuous, such as the [[Le Chatelier's principle|Le Chatelier principle]] and [[correspondence principle]], but they are given a nontrivially generalized formulation and application. They and mathematical constructions, such as [[Lagrange multipliers|Lagrangian multipliers]], are given an operational economic interpretation. The generalized ''Le Chatelier principle'' is for a maximum condition of equilibrium: where all unknowns of the function are independently variable, auxiliary constraints ("just-binding" in leaving initial equilibrium unchanged) reduce the response to a parameter change. Thus, factor-demand and commodity-supply [[Elasticity (economics)|elasticities]] are hypothesized to be lower in the [[short run]] than in the [[long run]] because of the fixed-cost constraint in the short run.<ref>Eugene Silberberg, 2008. "Le Chatelier principle," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]''. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_L000049&edition=current&q=Le%20Chatelier%20principle&topicid=&result_number=11 Abstract.]]</ref> In the course of analysis, ''[[comparative statics]]'', changes in equilibrium of the system that result from a [[parameter]] change of the system, is formalized and most clearly stated (Kehoe, 1987, p. 517).<ref>Timothy Kehoe, 1987. "Comparative statics," ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 1, pp. 517–20.</ref> The ''correspondence principle'' is that the ''stability'' of equilibrium for a system (such as a market or economy) implies meaningful theorems in comparative statics. Alternatively, the hypothesis of stability imposes directional restrictions on the movement of the system (Samuelson, pp. 258, 5). The correspondence is between comparative [[statics]] and the dynamics implied by stability of equilibrium. {| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="20" |The starting point of the analysis is the postulate of maximizing behavior. The point is not (or not only) that everyone is out to maximize (Fischer, 1987, p. 235),<ref name="Fischer">[[Stanley Fischer]], 1987. "Samuelson, Paul Anthony," ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 4, pp. 234–41.</ref> even if true. Rather, first- and in particular higher-order (derivative) conditions of equilibrium at the maximum imply local behavioral relations (Samuelson, p. 16). The stability of equilibrium with sufficient other hypothetical qualitative restrictions then generates testable hypotheses (pp. 16, 28-29). Even where there is no context for purposive maximizing behavior, reduction to a maximization problem may be a convenient device for developing properties of the equilibrium, from which, however, no "[[Teleology|teleological]] or [[normative economics|normative]] welfare significance" is warranted (pp. 52–53). |} Chapter VIII on [[welfare economics]] is described as an attempt "to give a brief but fairly complete survey of the whole field of welfare economics" (p. 252). This Samuelson does in 51 pages, including his exposition of what became known as the [[social welfare function#Bergson-Samuelson social welfare function|Bergson-Samuelson social welfare function]]. Theorems derived in welfare economics, he notes, are deductive implications of assumptions that are not refutable, thus not meaningful in a certain sense. Still, the social welfare function can represent any index ([[cardinal utility|cardinal]] or not) of the economic measures of any logically possible ethical belief system that is required to [[total ordering|order]] any (hypothetically) feasible social configurations as "better than", "worse than", or "indifferent to" each other (p. 221). It also definitively elucidates the notion of [[Pareto optimality]] and the "germ of truth in Adam Smith's doctrine of the [[Invisible Hand]]" (Samuelson, 1983, p. xxiv; Fischer, 1987, p. 236<ref name="Fischer"/>). The final pages of the book (pp. 354–55) outline possible directions analytical methods might take, including for example models that show how: * [[Deficit spending|deficit financing]] could produce positive short-run effects on the economy that are swamped by adverse long-run effects on capital accumulation (seriously reconsidered later as [[Crowding out (economics)|crowding out]]) * declines in [[Mortality rate|age-specific mortality]] affect the [[demography|net reproductive rate]] (whose the implications for [[population growth]] are [[:Image:Population curve.svg|less abstract]] than they might first appear). Samuelson closes by expressing hope in the future use of ''comparative dynamics'' to: : aid in the attack upon diverse problems -- from the trivial behavior of a single small commodity, to the fluctuations of important components of the business cycle, and even to the majestic problems of economic development. == Appendices == There are two mathematical appendices totalling 83 pages. The first gathers and develops "very briefly" and "without striving for rigor" results on maximization conditions and [[quadratic forms]] used in the book and not conveniently collected elsewhere (p. 389). The other is on [[difference equations]] ("for the dynamic economist") and other functional equations. == Enlarged edition == The 1983 Enlarged edition includes an additional 12-page "Introduction" and a new 145-page appendix with some post-1947 developments in analytical economics, including how conclusions of the book are affected by them. ==Assessments== * [[Kenneth Arrow]] (1983, p. 19) describes ''Foundations'' as "the only example I know of a doctoral dissertation that is a treatise, perhaps I should say of a treatise that has so much originality in every part that it is entitled to be accepted as a thesis."<ref>Kenneth J.
