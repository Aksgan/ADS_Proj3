terms that all have a similar meaning. == Industry and organizations == {{main|Software industry}} A great variety of software companies and programmers in the world comprise a software industry . Software can be quite a profitable industry: [[Bill Gates]], the founder of [[Microsoft]] was the richest person in the world in 2009 largely by selling the [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Microsoft Office]] software products. The same goes for [[Larry Ellison]], largely through his [[Oracle database]] software. Through time the software industry has become increasingly specialized. Non-profit software organizations include the [[Free Software Foundation]], [[GNU Project]] and [[Mozilla Foundation]]. Software standard organizations like the [[W3C]], [[IETF]] develop software standards so that most software can interoperate through standards such as [[XML]], [[HTML]], [[HTTP]] or [[FTP]]. Other well-known large software companies include [[Novell]], [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[Symantec]], [[Adobe Systems]], and [[Corel]], while small companies often provide innovation. == References == <references/> == External links == {{Wiktionary|software}} * [[wikia:software|Software Wikia]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Computer Software}} [[Category:Software| ]] [[af:Sagteware]] [[als:Software]] [[ar:برمجية حاسوب]] [[an:Software]] [[ast:Programa d'ordenador]] [[az:Proqram təminatı]] [[bn:কম্পিউটার সফটওয়্যার]] [[zh-min-nan:Nńg-thé]] [[be:Праграмнае забеспячэнне]] [[be-x-old:Праграмнае забесьпячэньне]] [[bs:Softver]] [[br:Meziant]] [[bg:Софтуер]] [[ca:Programari]] [[cs:Software]] [[cy:Meddalwedd]] [[da:Computerprogram]] [[de:Software]] [[et:Tarkvara]] [[el:Λογισμικό]] [[es:Software]] [[eo:Programaro]] [[eu:Software]] [[fa:نرم‌افزار]] [[fo:Ritbúnaður]] [[fr:Logiciel]] [[ga:Bogearraí]] [[gl:Programa informático]] [[gu:સૉફ્ટવેર]] [[ko:컴퓨터 소프트웨어]] [[hi:सॉफ़्टवेयर]] [[hsb:Softwara]] [[hr:Programska podrška]] [[id:Perangkat lunak]] [[ia:Programmatura]] [[iu:ᐊᕿᑦᑐᖅ ᖃᕆᑕᐅᔭᐅᑉ ᑎᑎᕋᕐᕕᖓ/aqittuq qaritaujaup titirarvinga]] [[is:Hugbúnaður]] [[it:Software]] [[he:תוכנה]] [[kn:ತಂತ್ರಾಂಶ]] [[ks:सॉफ्टवेयर]] [[ku:Nermalav]] [[lo:ຊອຟຕ໌ແວຣ໌‍]] [[la:Programmatura]] [[lv:Programmatūra]] [[lb:Software]] [[lt:Programinė įranga]] [[ln:Litámbwisi]] [[lmo:Prugramadura]] [[hu:Szoftver]] [[mk:Програмска опрема]] [[ml:കമ്പ്യൂട്ടർ സോഫ്‌റ്റ്‌വെയർ]] [[mr:सॉफ्टवेअर]] [[arz:سوفت وير]] [[ms:Perisian]] [[mn:Програм хангамж]] [[my:ကွန်ပျူတာ ဆော့ဖ်ဝဲလ်]] [[nl:Software]] [[ne:सफ्टवेयर]] [[new:सफ्टवेर]] [[ja:ソフトウェア]] [[no:Programvare]] [[nn:Programvare]] [[oc:Logicial]] [[pnb:سوفٹ وئر]] [[nds:Software]] [[pl:Oprogramowanie]] [[pt:Software]] [[ro:Software]] [[qu:Llamp'u kaq]] [[ru:Программное обеспечение]] [[sah:Софтуэр]] [[sq:Software]] [[scn:Software]] [[si:පරිගණක මෘදුකාංග]] [[simple:Software]] [[sk:Softvér]] [[sl:Programska oprema]] [[so:Software]] [[sr:Софтвер]] [[sh:Software]] [[fi:Ohjelmisto]] [[sv:Programvara]] [[tl:Software]] [[ta:மென்பொருள்]] [[tt:Программа белән тәэмин ителеш]] [[te:కంప్యూటర్ సాఫ్ట్‌వేర్]] [[th:ซอฟต์แวร์]] [[tr:Yazılım]] [[uk:Програмне забезпечення]] [[ur:مصنع لطیف]] [[vec:Programatura]] [[vi:Phần mềm]] [[war:Software]] [[yi:ווייכווארג]] [[zh-yue:電腦軟件]] [[bat-smg:Pruogramėnė īronga]] [[zh:软件]]</text> </page> <page> <id>7590</id> <title>Computer surveillance</title> <text>{{About|surreptitious monitoring of computer activity|information on methods of preventing unauthorized access to computer data|computer security}} {{Merge from|Policeware|date=October 2008}} '''Computer surveillance''' is the act of performing [[surveillance]] of computer activity, and of data stored on a [[hard drive]] or being transferred over the [[Internet]]. Computer surveillance programs are widespread today, and almost all Internet traffic is closely monitored for clues of illegal activity. Supporters{{Who|date=May 2010}} say that watching all Internet traffic is important, because by knowing everything that everyone is reading and writing, they can identify terrorists and criminals, and protect society from them. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} cite concerns over privacy and the possibility of a totalitarian state where political dissent is impossible and opponents of state policy are removed in [[COINTELPRO]]-like purges. Such a state may be referred to as an [[Electronic Police State]], in which the government aggressively uses electronic technologies to record, organize, search and distribute forensic evidence against its citizens. ==Network surveillance== The vast majority of computer surveillance involves the monitoring of [[data mining|data]] and [[traffic analysis|traffic]] on the [[Internet]].<ref name="sciam-internet">{{cite news|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=internet-eavesdropping|title=Internet Eavesdropping: A Brave New World of Wiretapping |last=Diffie|first=Whitfield|coauthors=Susan Landau|date=August, 2008|work=Scientific American|accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref> In the United States for example, under the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act]], all phone calls and broadband internet traffic (emails, web traffic, instant messaging, etc.) are required to be available for unimpeded real-time monitoring by Federal law enforcement agencies.<ref name="eff-calea-archive">{{cite web|url=http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/CALEA/?f=archive.html|title=CALEA Archive -- Electronic Frontier Foundation|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation (website)|accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref><ref name="eff-calea-summary">{{cite web|url=http://www.eff.org/issues/calea|title=CALEA: The Perils of Wiretapping the Internet|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation (website)|accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref><ref name="eff-calea-faq">{{cite web|url=http://www.eff.org/pages/calea-faq|title=CALEA: Frequently Asked Questions|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation (website)|accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref> ''[[Packet sniffer|Packet sniffing]]'' is the monitoring of data traffic on a [[computer network]]. Computers communicate over the [[Internet]] by breaking up messages (emails, images, videos, web pages, files, etc.) into small chunks called "packets", which are routed through a network of computers, until they reach their destination, where they are assembled back into a complete "message" again. Packet sniffers are programs that intercept these packets as they are travelling through the network, in order to examine their contents using other programs. A packet sniffer is an information ''gathering'' tool, but not an ''analysis'' tool. That is it gathers "messages" but it does not analyze them and figure out what they mean. Other programs are needed to perform [[traffic analysis]] and sift through intercepted data looking for important/useful information. Under the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act]] all U.S. telecommunications providers are required to install packet sniffing technology to allow Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to intercept all of their customers' broadband Internet traffic. There is far too much data gathered by these packet sniffers for human investigators to manually search through all of it. So automated Internet surveillance computers sift through the vast amount of intercepted Internet traffic, and filter out and report to human investigators those bits of information which are "interesting" -- such as the use of certain words or phrases, visiting certain types of web sites, or communicating via email or chat with a certain individual or group.<ref name="usatoday-chatroom">{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/surveillance/2004-10-11-chatroom-surv_x.htm|title=Government funds chat room surveillance research|last=Hill|first=Michael|date=October 11, 2004|work=Associated Press|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref> Billions of dollars per year are spent, by agencies such as the [[Information Awareness Office]], [[NSA]], and the [[FBI]], to develop, purchase, implement, and operate systems which intercept and analyze all of this data, and extract only the information which is useful to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.<ref name="zdnet-fbi">{{cite news|url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-151059.html|title=FBI turns to broad new wiretap method|last=McCullagh|first=Declan|date=January 30, 2007|work=ZDNet News|accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref> Similar systems are now operated by [[Ministry of Intelligence and National Security of Iran|Iranian secret police]] to identify and suppress dissidents.

The data collected is most often used for marketing purposes or sold to other corporations, but is also regularly shared with government agencies. It can be used as a form of [[business intelligence]], which enables the corporation to better tailor their products and/or services to be desirable by their customers. Or it the data can be sold to other corporations, so that they can use it for the aforementioned purpose. Or it can be used for direct marketing purposes, such
