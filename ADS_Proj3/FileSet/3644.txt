subject to integration depending on the machine speed. If the measurement signal sampling frequency is in size range 2000/s, or the smallest measurement element is about 0.2 cm in cross-direction. The measurement data is integrated to eliminate a small-scale formation variation from the measurement result. The measurement value is averaged so that each sensor gives one measurement value per one centimeter of web width. For a 3 meter wide web, for instance, 300 measurement values are taken. These measurement values for a single scan (profile points) are called raw profiles. In modern quality control systems, the width of these profile points can be changed, and accurate profiles can be formed using several hundred profile points. Typically, the sensors give the instantaneous value, the average value and the profile measurements. == Sensor requirements == The requirements for an ideal paper machine online sensor include: The sensor is calibrated to a natural constant during the measurement. The sensor and the related electronics include fault diagnostics. Digital processing of the signal is possible from the start without distroying the possibility of analyzing large frequency components. The sensor system does not disturb the production. The measurements are performed real-time and can be adjusted without delays. The measurement concerns the entire production, not just a small sample values. It must be possible to distinguish between the machine-directional and cross-directional deviation and the residual deviation as the control system handles these three deviations separately and in different ways. The earlier systems calculated a long-term average profile to filter the profile. As several quality profiles can be adjusted automatically it is important to get the right profile data with high resolution quickly to the control system. This is especially important during changes, e.g. after breaks and during grade changes. In advanced systems, algorithms are used to calculate the profile data. ==See also== * [[Distributed Control System]] * [[Programmable Logic Controller|PLC]] * [[Safety instrumented system]], (SIS) * [[Industrial control systems]] ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.knowpap.com/english/ KnowPap - e-Learning Environment for] Papermaking and Automation * [http://www.metso.com/automation/pp_prod.nsf/WebWID/WTB-041026-2256F-605D4 Example 1 of industrial QCS] * [http://www.tut.fi/index.cfm?MainSel=1603&Sel=1603&Show=1499&view=detail&siteid=32&NewsID=62399&ID=62399 Optical method for measuring paper thickness becomes a success] * [http://www.eibis.com/eibis/eibiswww/eibisdoc/4321en.htm Selective and adaptive paper web measuring technique] * [http://www.metso.com/automation/pc/web_articles.nsf/WebWID/WTB-100318-22570-6822C Non-nuclear paper web moisture measuring technique] <!--- Categories ---> {{DEFAULTSORT:Distributed Control System}} [[Category:Automation]] [[Category:Control engineering]] [[Category:Applications of distributed computing]]</text> </page> <page> <id>30742</id> <title>Quality Management Framework (QMF)</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=January 2011}} {{New unreviewed article|source=ArticleWizard|date=October 2010}} {{buzzwords|date=October 2010}} '''Quality Management Framework''' or '''QMF''' is a tool to aid in the successful delivery of products and services across the enterprise. The QMF standardises processes, allowing for increased efficiencies (faster and less cost) in bringing new products to the market place. These processes strengthen supplier management techniques in addition to robust cost control, thereby improving our overall profit. And by implementing the QMF we ensure PCI and Security compliance across the project lifecycle. First coined by Shane Kelly, QA Manager [[William Hill (bookmaker)]], it was developed by utilising the benefits of TQM and pre-defined security policies, as defined by IEEE. The project lifecycle was defined and a framework designed that helped to implement the robust security policy. The different stages of the IS project delivery system were defined and the necessary artefacts created for implementation. The simplest list of artefacts were defined that ensured the QMF could be delivered and the security policy adhered to. By adopting the QMF and utilising the artefacts designed for a robust security policy it is expected that improvements will be achieved. This report shall show the result of this investigation and the ease of its implementation and will highlight:- • security improvements; • ease of implementation; • resolutions made on security policy; • the capacity for constant improvement; • the robustness of the solution to be scaled across IS projects; Based upon the iTQM (Integrated Total Quality Management System) which shows that research into this field is “about how to design a top-down orchestrated serviced oriented architecture to integrate TQM element cores into a whole system supported by advanced information technology, data mining, service policies, forced training and governance” (WANG 2008)<ref>Integrated Total Quality Management Wang, Wu The University of Sussex 2008</ref>. Focusing heavily on quality and process improvements these systems rely on separate processes to realise a robust security policy. Implementing a robust security policy within the iTQM might prove too cumbersome and time-consuming, holding little academic value. But I believe that by creating a more simple solution such as the QMF (Quality Management Framework) we can incorporate the necessary security considerations but continue to allow improvements in quality and delivery. There is also a large amount of research in the area of security within IS Delivery and in improving security standards within those defined by IEEE that can help to “en-sure that security is analyzed during the early stages of the software development lifecycle” (MCCARTHY 2007)<ref>Specifying security requirements improvement for IEEE Standard 830 McCarthy, Jacob, D 2007</ref>. By utilising the research within these areas I believe we can incorporate this into the sQMF for improved IS Project Delivery. For the purpose of this research we shall con-sider IS to incorporate “hardware, software, people and data where the software component consists of: systems software, applications software and specific purpose software.” (AVISON AND SHAH CITED BY LITTLE 2003)<ref>Critical success factors in software projects: a framework under scrutiny Little, Timothy 2003</ref> == See also== *[[Quality Management]] *[[Quality Management Systems]] *[[Total Quality Management]] == References == <!--- See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically --> {{Reflist}} == External links == IEEE Recommended Practice for Software Requirements Specifications IEEE Std 830-1998 1998/IEEESTD.1998.88286 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=720574&isnumber=15571 <!--- Categories ---> {{DEFAULTSORT:Total Quality Management}} [[Category:Articles created via the Article Wizard]] [[Category:Quality management]] [[Category:Process management]] [[Category:Business terms]]</text> </page> <page> <id>30755</id> <title>Quantemol</title> <text>{{Refimprove|date=May 2010}} '''Quantemol Ltd''' is based in [[University_College_London|University College London]] initiated by Professor Jonathan Tennyson FRS and Dr. Daniel Brown in 2004.
