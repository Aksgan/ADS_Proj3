Modding refers to the act of modifying a piece of hardware or software or anything else for that matter, to perform a function not originally conceived or intended by the [[designer]]. The term modding is often used within the computer game community, particularly in regard to creating new or altered content and sharing that via the web. It may also be applied to the [[overclocking]] of computers in order to increase the [[frequency]] at the which the [[CPU]] operates. [[Case modding]] is also a popular activity amongst many computer enthusiasts which involves the [[customization]] of a [[computer chassis]] or the installation of [[water cooling]] technology. In connection with [[automobiles]], modding often refers to [[engine tuning]], remapping of a vehicle's [[engine control unit]] or customization of the [[Coachwork|bodywork]]. == Computers and digital equipment == === Legal issues === Modding may sometimes infringe the legal rights of the copyright owner. Some nations have laws prohibiting modding and accuse modders of attempting to overcome [[copy protection]] schemes. In the United States, the [[DMCA]] has set up stiff penalties for mods that violate the rights of intellectual property owners. In the [[European Union]], member states have agreed the [[EU Copyright Directive]] and are transposing it into national law. A man was [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4650225.stm convicted] in the [[United Kingdom]] in July 2005 for selling a modded [[Xbox]] with built in software and games. However it is also worthy of note that some other European countries have not interpreted the legal issues in the same way. In Italy a judge threw out a [http://management.silicon.com/government/0,39024677,39117891,00.htm Sony case] saying it was up to owners of a console what they did with it. Similarly in [http://www.theregister.com/2004/04/27/spanish_xbox_modding_ruling/ Spain], mod chips are seen as legal despite the EU copyright legislation. Modding may be an unauthorized changed made to a software or hardware to a platform in gaming. Case mods are modifications to a device with the altering of certain styles. For example, people who mod a [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox 360]] can alter the [[led]] lights on the controller to glow different colors. ==== Multi-user licensing ==== Computer systems, hardware, and software are often sold or licensed to one home machine, to a business that has many computers, a government agency, or a non-profit organization. When the software license says that it is for a specific person, then it is not legal{{dubious|date=November 2010}} for that software to be used by some other person on that same computer, even a member of the same family, or another employee of the same company. But this strict licensing is only one approach. In this form of licensing, for more than one person to be using that software or hardware, they need to have a multi-user license that usually dictates how many different people may use it. ==== Derivative software ==== Some [[software]] is [[licensed]] with a copy of the [[Computer program|program]] [[source code]] supplied along with the [[executable code]] in which the license specifically authorizes changes to the supplied software. This is a common standard in business software packages. Hundreds of thousands of computer programmers in some nations have jobs because businesses want the purchased software tailored to the specific needs of the individual businesses. Most every major city has want ads in the newspaper where there are job openings for people to modify some company's computer systems, where the ad specifies what [[programming language]]s or [[operating system]]s the applicant needs to know.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} [[Derivative software]] is licensed copyrighted software used in whole or part in new programs written by programmers at businesses using the licensed software. Programmers copy the copyright notices into the source code where the code was copied, and track all such places, because if the license is permitted to expire, then the business loses software use rights, including any place to which it was copied. An annual fee is typically paid to keep the license in effect, and over time, the software supplier can increase the fees to the point that the business chooses to convert to some other commercial software that seems to be more cost effective. It is not unusual in business software to find programs that have many different copyright notices, each referring to different sources of the derived source code. === Video game consoles === A common example of one kind of modding is [[video game console]] [[mod chip]]s, which can allow users to play [[Homebrew (video games)|homemade games]], games legitimately purchased in other [[Regional lockout|regions]], or legal backup copies, but can also allow [[copyright infringement of software|illegal unauthorized copies]] by allowing the player to play personally [[CD recorder|recorded]] [[compact disc|CD]] or [[digital video disc|DVD]] copies of [[video game]]s. [[Modchips]], in their current form, were first available for the Sony [[PlayStation]] (and later the [[PlayStation 2]]). Various other types of copyright circumvention systems also existed for the [[Nintendo 64]] and the older Game Boy consoles (though neither include actual modding, but instead backup devices). ==== Types of modding ==== There are two different ways of running unsigned code on a game console. One is through [[Softmod|soft modding]] (modifying software, normally using a [[softmod]]) to allow the user to change data contained on its [[hard drive]] in the case of the Xbox. Another type of modding, known as [[hard modding]], exploits the [[BIOS]] of the console to run unsigned code, or games. This form of 'modding' (more correctly termed as [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]]) is very popular as it
