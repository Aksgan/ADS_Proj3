Xena Viewer can be used to view or export a Xena file in its target file format. The Xena Viewer supports bulk export of Xena files to target file formats. Xena can be used via its [[graphical user interface]] or the [[command line]]. For Xena to be fully functional, it requires a local installation of the following external software: *[[OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice]] suite - to convert office documents to ODF format *Tesseract - to create plain text versions of file formats *[[ImageMagick]] - to convert a subset of image files to [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] *Readpst - to convert [[Microsoft Outlook]] PST files to XML. Readpst is part of the free and open source [http://www.five-ten-sg.com/libpst/ libpst software suite]. *[[Free Lossless Audio Codec|FLAC]] - to convert audio files to FLAC format. This is also required to playback audio files using Xena. ==Supported file types== Xena will recognize and process the file types listed below, plus a few others of minor importance. Unsupported file types will automatically undergo binary normalization. Office suites and applications: *[[Microsoft Office]] files (including [[Microsoft Office XML formats|MS Office XML]], [[SYLK]] spreadsheets and [[Rich Text Format]]) are converted to the corresponding OpenOffice files *[[Microsoft Outlook]] [[Personal Storage Table|PST]] files are parsed for their individual messages, which are converted to XML files and a Xena index file is created *[[Microsoft Project]] MPP files are converted to XML *[[Oracle Open Office|StarOffice]] files (SXC, SXI, SXW) are converted to the corresponding OpenOffice formats *[[WordPerfect]] WPD files are converted to OpenOffice ODT *OpenOffice documents (ODT, ODS, ODB, ODP) are preserved unchanged *Acrobat PDF files are stored as binaries *Mailbox files (MBX) are converted to individual XML files Graphics: *[[BMP file format|BMP]], [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]], [[Adobe Photoshop|PSD]], [[PCX]], [[.ras|RAS]], and the [[X-Window|X Window System]][[X BitMap|XBM]] and [[X PixMap|XPM]] bitmap files are converted to [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]]; [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]] files additionally get embedded metadata stored in Xena XML. If the [[Tesseract (software)|Tesseract]] [[Optical character recognition|OCR software]] is installed, text will be extracted from TIFF files. *OpenOffice Document Drawings (ODG) and [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] files are wrapped in Xena XML *JPG and PNG files are stored unchanged Archive Files: *Files are extracted from [[File archiver|archives]] ([[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]], [[gzip|GZIP]], [[tar (file format)|TAR/TAR.gz]], [[JAR (file format)|JAR]], [[WAR (Sun file format)|WAR]], Mac binary) and normalised into a separate Xena file. A Xena index file is created, which when opened in the internal Xena viewer will display the files in a table. Audio files: *[[MP3]], [[WAV]], [[AIFF]], and [[Vorbis|OGG]] formats are converted to [[Free Lossless Audio Codec|FLAC]] files. Databases: *[[SQL]] files are processed as plain text wrapped in XML Other file types: *HTML is converted to XHTML *TXT text files are stored as plain text wrapped in XML; CSS files are stored as plain text wrapped in XML ==Reviews== An April 22, 2010 review in Practical e-Records rated Xena at 82/100 points.

Last, ''Wall Street Journal'', December 30, 2008</ref> Each core has two symmetric hardware threads ([[Simultaneous multithreading|SMT]]), for a total of six hardware threads available to games. Each individual core also includes 32 [[KiB]] of [[CPU cache|L1 instruction cache]] and 32 KiB of L1 data cache. The processors are labelled "XCPU" on the [[Chip carrier|packaging]] and are manufactured by [[Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing|Chartered]] (now part of [[GlobalFoundries]]). Chartered reduced the fabrication process in 2007 to [[65 nanometer|65 nm]], thus reducing manufacturing costs for Microsoft. The name "Xenon" was repurposed from the code name for the Xbox 360 in early development. ==Specifications== *[[90 nanometer|90 nm process]],<ref name="xbox360cpu">{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/power/library/pa-fpfxbox/|title=Application-customized CPU design: The Microsoft Xbox 360 CPU story|accessdate=2007-09-08|author=Jeffrey Brown|date=2005-12-06}}</ref> [[65 nanometer|65 nm process]] upgrade in 2007<ref name="chartered65nm">{{cite web|url=http://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/10754/Chartered-to-Manufacture-65nm-Xbox-360-CPUs/|title=Chartered to Manufacture 65-nm Xbox 360 CPUs|accessdate=2008-01-09|author=CÃ©sar A.
