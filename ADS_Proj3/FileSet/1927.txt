(or ''q''-1) the set of ''d''th powers forms a subgroup of <math>(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^*</math>. ==Problem Statement== Given an integer ''n'' = ''pq'' where ''p'' and ''q'' are unknown, an integer ''d'' such that ''d'' divides ''p''-1, and an integer ''x'' < ''n'', it is infeasible to determine whether ''x'' is a ''d''th power (equivalently ''d''th residue) modulo ''n''. Notice that if ''p'' and ''q'' are known it is easy to determine whether ''x'' is a ''d''th residue modulo ''n'' because ''x'' will be a ''d''th residue modulo ''p'' if and only if :<math>x^{(p-1)/d} \equiv 1 \pmod p</math> When ''d''=2, this is called the [[quadratic residuosity problem]]. ==Applications== The [[semantic security]] of the [[Benaloh cryptosystem]] and the [[Naccache-Stern cryptosystem]] rests on the intractability of this problem. ==See also== *[[quadratic residuosity problem]] *[[computational hardness assumptions]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Higher Residuosity Problem}} [[Category:Cryptographic primitives]] [[Category:Computational number theory]] [[Category:Computational hardness assumptions]]</text> </page> <page> <id>16715</id> <title>Highest response ratio next</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=December 2009}} '''Highest Response Ratio Next''' (HRRN) [[scheduling (computing)|scheduling]] is a non-preemptive discipline, similar to [[Shortest Job Next|Shortest Job Next (SJN)]], in which the priority of each job is dependent on its estimated run time, and also the amount of time it has spent waiting. Jobs gain higher priority the longer they wait which prevents indefinite postponement ([[starvation (computing)|process starvation]]). In fact, the jobs that have spent a long time waiting compete against those which are estimated to have short run times. <math>Priority = \frac{waiting\ time + estimated\ run\ time}{estimated\ run\ time} = 1 + \frac{waiting\ time}{estimated\ run\ time}</math> Developed by Brinch Hansen to correct certain weaknesses in SJN including the difficulty in estimating run time. == References == * William Stallings: ''Operating systems: internals and design principles''. 4th ed., Prentice-Hall, 2001, ISBN 0-13-031999-6. {{DEFAULTSORT:Highest Response Ratio Next}} [[Category:Scheduling algorithms]] [[de:Highest Response Ratio Next]]</text> </page> <page> <id>16722</id> <title>Highway Hunter</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=February 2007}} {{Infobox VG| title = Highway Hunter |developer = [[Omega Integral Systems]] |publisher = [[Safari Software]] |distributor = [[Epic MegaGames]] |platforms = [[MS-DOS]] |released = {{Vgrelease new|INT|1994}} |genre = [[Action game|Action]], [[Shoot 'em up]] |modes = [[Single-player video game|Single-Player]] |media = 3Â½-inch [[floppy disk]] |input = [[keyboard (computing)|Keyboard]] |designer = Alexander Safonov |composer = Serge Shishkin |artist = Serge Kuzmin }} '''''Highway Hunter''''' is a [[MS-DOS|DOS]]-based video game created in 1994. It was developed by [[Omega Integral Systems]], released by [[Safari Software]], and distributed by Epic MegaGames (now [[Epic Games]]). ==Plot== A hostile alien race has conquered the earth and enslaved the human race to do their bidding. The player assumes the role of a man who has worked in an alien maintenance garage. You steal a prototype alien combat vehicle called the MASTER and escape with it. You must use the MASTER to fight the alien forces in a desperate bid to save the planet. ==Gameplay== The game uses a top-down view. The player's car is situated on a raised highway. The ground is visible on the sides. The player's car is constantly moving upwards through the level, though the player can maneuver his car around the screen within the boundaries of the highway. The player fires at enemies that come from the top of the screen. There are ground enemies on the highway and flying enemies that can come in from the sides or the top. Some enemies may drop weapon power ups which make the player car's projectiles stronger or more numerous. The game is divided into three episodes each with a number of levels, with a boss at the end of each level. The shareware version omits the second and third episodes. The highway environments start out looking earthly, but the player moves into more alien levels later in the game.

The HiGig protocol supports various switching functions like [[Quality of service|Quality-of-Service (QoS)]], link aggregation, and others. The physical signaling across the interface is [[XAUI]], four differential pairs for receive and transmit ([[SerDes]]), each operating at 3.125 Gbit/s. HiGig+ is a higher rate version of HiGig. HiGig can be compared to the [[Interlaken (networking)]] protocol. ==External references== [http://www.latticesemi.com/corporate/newscenter/newsletters/newsjune2007/bridgingsolutionsforswitc.cfm SPI4.2 to XAUI/HiGig/HiGig+ Bridging Solutions with LatticeSCM FPGAs] [[Category:Network protocols]] {{compu-network-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>16740</id> <title>Hindawi Programming System</title> <text>{{Multiple issues |advert = October 2007 |primarysources = October 2007 |citations missing = October 2007 }} '''Hindawi Programming System''' (hereafter referred to as HPS) is a suite of [[open source]] [[programming languages]].
