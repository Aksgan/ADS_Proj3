circuit, design the PCB and [[Semiconductor fabrication|fabricate]] PCBs. EDWinXP may be seen as a system of seamlessly integrated, task oriented, modules covering all stages of the design process from capturing the idea of a circuit in the form of a Schematic Diagram to generate a full set of documentation for manufacturing and assembling of PCBs. Additionally the package includes various validation tools ensuring correctness and integrity of designed circuits. ==Modules== Complete design information is stored in the integrated project simultaneously accessible by [[Schematic]] Diagram Editor, PCB Layout Editor, Fabrication Output Manager and Simulators. This simulator provides EDWinXP users with the facility to analyze and validate the functionality and behaviour of circuits captured in the form of schematic diagrams. The EDSpice simulator is based on [[SPICE|SPICE3F5]] and XSPICE with a number of extensions and improvements. The [[University of California]] developed SPICE3F5 and [[Georgia Tech Research Institute]] developed XSPICE. SPICE is well known in the electronic industry as general-purpose circuit simulation program for non linear DC, non-linear Transient and linear ac analysis. XSPICE extends SPICE3’s capabilities to allow simulation of mixed signal (analog/digital) and mixed level circuits. Front and back annotation of all design changes is fully automatic. EDWinXP comes with an extensive part library, which may be updated, customized and enhanced with the help of Library Editor ==Database== All data about hierarchical electronic design (which may consist of several circuits and sub-circuits) is stored in a single [[database]], along with PCB layouts for every board in the design, i.e. the software works on the concept of integrated project database. In other words, the documentation of a complete electronic device may be stored in one disk file. All parts of the design project – schematics, PCB layout and PCB fabrication drawings and documents are simultaneously accessible by task oriented software modules of the system. Changes in the design, entered on diagrams are automatically and in real time annotated on PCB layout design and vice versa. ==External links== *[http://www.visionics.a.se/ Visionics Home] *[http://visionics.a.se/html/edwin_xp_f.html EDWinXP Package] *[http://www.edwinxp.com/DForum/index.php EDWinXP Discussion Forum] [[Category:Computer-aided design software]] [[Category:Computer-aided engineering software]] {{CAD-software-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>11740</id> <title>Efax (software)</title> <text>{{Lowercase title}} {{Other uses|Efax (disambiguation)}} {{Infobox_Software | name = efax | latest_release_version = 1.0.1b | latest_release_date = 6 April 2002 | operating_system = [[Unix-like]] | genre = [[Fax server#Integrated fax programs|Integrated fax program]] | license = [[GPL]] | website = [http://www.cce.com/efax/ http://www.cce.com/efax] }} '''efax''' is a [[Fax server#Integrated fax programs|integrated fax program]] for [[Unix-like]] computer systems, produced by Casas Communications Engineering since 1993. <ref>[http://www.cce.com/efax/documentation/efax.pdf efax Manual]</ref> The software allows users to send and receive [[fax]]es using a computer, fax modem, and telephone line.

An effective method for calculating the values of a function is an [[algorithm]]; functions with an effective method are sometimes called '''effectively calculable.''' Several independent efforts to give a formal characterization of effective calculability led to a variety of proposed definitions ([[Recursion|general recursion]], [[Turing machine]]s, [[λ-calculus]]) that later were shown to be equivalent; the notion captured by these definitions is known as [[Computable function|(recursive) computability]]. [[Church's thesis]] states that the two notions coincide: any [[number-theoretic function]] that is effectively calculable is [[computable function|recursively computable]]. Church's thesis is not a mathematical statement and cannot be proved by a [[mathematical proof]]. A further elucidation of the term "effective method" may include the requirement that, when given a problem from outside the class for which the method is effective, the method may halt or loop forever without halting, but must not return a result as if it were the answer to the problem. An essential feature of an effective method is that it does not require any [[ingenuity]] from any person or machine executing it.<ref>The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, ''effective procedure''</ref> ==See also== *[[Decision problem]] *[[Function problem]] *[[Effective results in number theory]] *[[Recursive set]] ==References == {{reflist}} * S.
