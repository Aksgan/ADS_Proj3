inverse semigroup can be embedded in a symmetric inverse semigroup (see below). == The basics == The inverse of an element ''x'' of an inverse semigroup ''S'' is usually written ''x''<sup>&minus;1</sup>. Inverses in an inverse semigroup have many of the same properties as inverses in a [[group (mathematics)|group]], for example, (''ab'')<sup>&minus;1</sup> = ''b''<sup>&minus;1</sup>''a''<sup>&minus;1</sup>. In an inverse [[monoid]], ''xx''<sup>&minus;1</sup> and ''x''<sup>&minus;1</sup>''x'' are not (necessarily) equal to the identity, but they are both [[idempotent]].<ref>Howie 1995 : Proposition 5.1.2(1).</ref> An inverse monoid ''S'' in which ''xx''<sup>&minus;1</sup> = 1 = ''x''<sup>&minus;1</sup>''x'', for all ''x'' in ''S'' (a ''unipotent'' inverse monoid), is, of course, a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. There are a number of equivalent characterisations of an inverse semigroup ''S'':<ref>Howie 1995 : Theorem 5.1.1.</ref> * Every element of ''S'' has a unique inverse, in the above sense. * Every element of ''S'' has at least one inverse (''S'' is a [[regular semigroup]]) and [[idempotent]]s commute (that is, the [[idempotent]]s of ''S'' form a [[semilattice]]). * Every <math>\mathcal{L}</math>-class and every <math>\mathcal{R}</math>-class contains precisely one [[idempotent]], where <math>\mathcal{L}</math> and <math>\mathcal{R}</math> are two of [[Green's relations]]. The [[idempotent]] in the <math>\mathcal{L}</math>-class of ''s'' is ''s''<sup>&minus;1</sup>''s'', whilst the [[idempotent]] in the <math>\mathcal{R}</math>-class of ''s'' is ''ss''<sup>&minus;1</sup>. There is therefore a simple characterisation of [[Green's relations]] in an inverse semigroup:<ref>Howie 1995 : Proposition 5.1.2(1).</ref> :<math>a\,\mathcal{L}\,b\Longleftrightarrow a^{-1}a=b^{-1}b,\quad a\,\mathcal{R}\,b\Longleftrightarrow aa^{-1}=bb^{-1}</math> Examples of inverse semigroups: *Every [[group (mathematics)|group]] is an inverse semigroup. *The [[bicyclic semigroup]] is inverse, with (''a'',''b'')<sup>&minus;1</sup> = (''b'',''a''). *Every [[semilattice]] is inverse. *The [[Brandt semigroup]] is inverse. *The [[Munn semigroup]] is inverse. Unless stated otherwise, ''E(S)'' will denote the semilattice of idempotents of an inverse semigroup ''S''. == The natural partial order == An inverse semigroup ''S'' possesses a ''natural [[partial order]]'' relation ≤ (sometimes denoted by ω) which is defined by the following:<ref>Wagner 1952.</ref> :<math>a \leq b \Longleftrightarrow a=eb,</math> for some [[idempotent]] ''e'' in ''S''. Equivalently, :<math>a \leq b \Longleftrightarrow a=bf,</math> for some (in general, different) [[idempotent]] ''f'' in ''S''. In fact, ''e'' can be taken to be ''aa''<sup>&minus;1</sup> and ''f'' to be ''a''<sup>&minus;1</sup>''a''.<ref>Howie 1995 : Proposition 5.2.1.</ref> The natural [[partial order]] is compatible with both multiplication and inversion, that is,<ref>Howie 1995 : 152&ndash;3</ref> :<math>a \leq b, c \leq d \Longrightarrow ac \leq bd</math> and :<math>a \leq b \Longrightarrow a^{-1} \leq b^{-1}.</math> In a [[group (mathematics)|group]], this [[partial order]] simply reduces to equality, since the identity is the only [[idempotent]]. In a symmetric inverse semigroup, the [[partial order]] reduces to restriction of mappings, i.e., α ≤ β if, and only if, the domain of α is contained in the domain of β and ''x''α = ''x''β, for all ''x'' in the domain of α.<ref>Howie 1995 : 153.</ref> The natural partial order on an inverse semigroup interacts with [[Green's relations]] as follows: if ''s'' ≤ ''t'' and ''s''<math>\,\mathcal{L}\,</math>''t'', then ''s'' = ''t''. Similarly, if ''s''<math>\,\mathcal{R}\,</math>''t''.<ref>Lawson 1998 : Proposition 3.2.3.</ref> On ''E(S)'', the natural [[partial order]] becomes: :<math>e \leq f \Longleftrightarrow e = ef,</math> so the product of any two [[idempotent]]s in ''S'' is equal to the lesser of the two, with respect to ≤. If ''E(S)'' forms a [[chain (order theory)|chain]] (i.e., ''E(S)'' is [[totally ordered]] by ≤), then ''S'' is a [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[group (mathematics)|groups]].<ref>Clifford & Preston 1967 : Theorem 7.5</ref> == Homomorphisms and representations of inverse semigroups == A [[homomorphism]] (or ''morphism'') of inverse semigroups is defined in exactly the same way as for any other semigroup: for inverse semigroups ''S'' and ''T'', a [[function (mathematics)|function]] θ from ''S'' to ''T'' is a morphism if (''s''θ)(''t''θ) = (''st'')θ, for all ''s'',''t'' in ''S''. The definition of a morphism of inverse semigroups could be augmented by including the condition (''s''θ)<sup>&minus;1</sup> = ''s''<sup>&minus;1</sup>θ, however, there is no need to do so, since this property follows from the above definition, via the following theorem: '''Theorem.''' The homomorphic [[image (mathematics)|image]] of an inverse semigroup is an inverse semigroup; the inverse of an element is always mapped to the inverse of the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of that element.<ref>Clifford & Preston 1967 : Theorem 7.36.</ref> One of the earliest results proved about inverse semigroups was the ''Wagner-Preston Theorem'', which is an analogue of [[Cayley's Theorem]] for [[group (mathematics)|groups]]: '''Wagner-Preston Theorem.''' If ''S'' is an inverse semigroup, then the [[function (mathematics)|function]] φ from ''S'' to <math>\mathcal{I}_S</math>, given by :dom (''a''&phi;) = ''Sa''<sup>&minus;1</sup> and ''x''(''a''&phi;) = ''xa'' is a [[faithful representation]] of ''S''.<ref>Howie 1995 : Theorem 5.1.7. Originally, Wagner 1952 and, independently, Preston 1954c.</ref> Thus, any inverse semigroup can be embedded in a symmetric inverse semigroup. == Congruences on inverse semigroups == [[Congruences]] are defined on inverse semigroups in exactly the same way as for any other semigroup: a ''congruence'' ρ is an [[equivalence relation]] which is compatible with semigroup multiplication, i.e., :<math>a\,\rho\,b,\quad c\,\rho\,d\Longrightarrow ac\,\rho\,bd.</math><ref>Howie 1995 : 22</ref> Of particular interest is the relation <math>\sigma</math>, defined on an inverse semigroup ''S'' by :<math>a\,\sigma\,b\Longleftrightarrow</math> there exists a <math>c\in S</math> with <math>c\leq a,b.</math><ref>Lawson 1998 : 62</ref> It can be shown that σ is a congruence and that the factor semigroup ''S''/σ is, in fact, a group. Indeed, σ is the ''smallest'' congruence on ''S'' such that ''S''/σ is a group, that is, if τ is any other congruence on ''S'' with ''S''/τ a group, then σ is contained in τ. The congruence σ is called the ''minimum group congruence'' on ''S''.<ref>Lawson 1998 : Theorem 2.4.1.</ref> The minimum group congruence can be used to give a characterisation of ''E''-unitary inverse semigroups (see below). A congruence ρ on an inverse semigroup ''S'' is called ''idempotent pure'' if :<math>a\in S, e\in E(S), a\,\rho\,e\Longrightarrow a\in E(S).</math><ref>Lawson 1998 : 65</ref> == ''E''-unitary inverse semigroups == One class of inverse semigroups which has been studied extensively over the years is the class of ''E-unitary inverse semigroups'': an inverse semigroup ''S'' (with [[semilattice]] ''E'' of [[idempotent]]s) is ''E-unitary'' if, for all ''e'' in ''E'' and all ''s'' in ''S'', :<math>es \in E \Longrightarrow s \in E.</math> Equivalently, :<math>se \in E \Rightarrow s \in E.</math><ref>Howie 1995 : 192.</ref> One further characterisation of an ''E''-unitary inverse semigroup ''S'' is the following: if ''e'' is in ''E'' and
