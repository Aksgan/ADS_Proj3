He is also a member of [[PLT Scheme|PLT]] and, as such, responsible for the creation and maintenance of [[DrRacket]]. In addition to [[DrRacket]], Findler has contributed numerous components to [[Racket]] and supervises its Web-based software library, called PLaneT. Findler is also a leading team member of the [[TeachScheme!]] project. Findler received his PhD at [[Rice University]] under the direction of [[Matthias Felleisen]]. His dissertation is on the linguistics of software contracts, popularly known as [[design by contract]]. His main contribution to software contracts is a more careful accounting of blame, thereby helping quickly programmers home in on the faulty part of a software system. In addition to DrRacket and software contracts, Findler focuses on the design and implementation of a workbench for semantics engineers. This workbench, called Redex, is a tool for specifying and executing the reduction semantics of a [[programming language]]. It is already widely used by programming language researchers in the US and Europe. Most recently, SUN's [[Fortress (programming language)|Fortress]] research team used Redex to specify and explore key parts of their language. Findler served as the semantics editor of the Revised^6 Report on the [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] programming language. He and his PhD student Jacob Matthews have developed a Redex model of the core semantics, which is included as an appendix of the report. The appendix plays the same role as [[ML (programming language)|ML]]'s formal specification (Milner, Tofte, Harper) but is executable and thus visualize individual examples. ==External links== *[http://www.eecs.northwestern.edu/~robby/ Home page] at the Northwestern University {{DEFAULTSORT:Findler, Robert Bruce}} [[Category:Programming language researchers]] [[Category:Living people]] {{Compu-scientist-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>32189</id> <title>Robert Floyd</title> <text>{{Other persons}} {{Infobox Scientist | name = Robert W Floyd | image = | image_width = | caption = | birth_date = {{Birth date|1936|6|8|mf=y}} | birth_place = [[New York]] | death_date = {{death date and age|2001|9|25|1936|6|8|mf=y}} | death_place = | residence = | citizenship = | nationality = American | ethnicity = | field = [[Computer Science]] | work_institution = [[Carnegie Mellon University]]<br>[[Stanford University]]<br>[[Illinois Institute of Technology]] | alma_mater = | doctoral_advisor = | doctoral_students = | known_for = [[Floyd's algorithm]] | author_abbreviation_bot = | author_abbreviation_zoo = | prizes = [[Turing Award]] | religion = | footnotes = }} '''Robert W Floyd''' (June 8, 1936 &ndash; September 25, 2001) was an eminent [[computer scientist]]. Born in [[New York]], Floyd finished school at age 14. At the [[University of Chicago]], he received a [[Bachelor's degree]] in [[liberal arts]] in 1953 (when still only 17) and a second Bachelor's degree in [[physics]] in 1958. Floyd became a staff member of the Armour Research Foundation (now IIT Research Institute) at [http://www.iit.edu/ Illinois Institute of Technology] in the 1950s. Becoming a computer operator in the early 1960s, he began publishing many noteworthy papers and was appointed an associate professor at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] by the time he was 27 and became a full professor at [[Stanford University]] six years later. He obtained this position without a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] His contributions include the design of [[Floyd's algorithm]], which efficiently finds all shortest paths in a [[graph theory|graph]], and work on [[parsing]]. In one isolated paper he introduced the important concept of error diffusion for rendering images, also called [[Floyd–Steinberg dithering]] (though he distinguished dithering from diffusion). A significant achievement was pioneering the field of [[program verification]] using [[logical assertion]]s with the 1967 paper ''Assigning Meanings to Programs''. This was an important contribution to what later became [[Hoare logic]]. Floyd worked closely with [[Donald Knuth]], in particular as the major reviewer for Knuth's seminal book ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]'', and is the person most cited in that work. He was the co-author, with Richard Beigel, of the textbook ''The Language of Machines: an Introduction to Computability and Formal Languages'' (1994, W.H. Freeman and Company, ISBN 978-0716782667). He received the [[Turing Award]] in 1978 "for having a clear influence on methodologies for the creation of efficient and reliable software, and for helping to found the following important subfields of computer science: the theory of [[parsing]], the [[semantics of programming languages]], automatic [[program verification]], automatic [[program synthesis]], and [[analysis of algorithms]]". Floyd married and divorced twice, and had four children. His hobbies included hiking and he was an avid [[backgammon]] player: {{quote|We once were stuck at the Chicago O’Hare airport for hours, waiting for our flight to leave, owing to a snow storm. As we sat at our gate, Bob asked me, in a casual manner, “do you know how to play backgammon?” I answered I knew the rules, but why did he want to know? Bob said since we had several hours to wait perhaps we should play a few games, for small stakes of course. He then reached into his briefcase and removed a backgammon set. My Dad taught me many things. One was to be wary of anyone who suggests a game of pool for money, and then opens a black case and starts to screw together a pool stick. I figured that this advice generalized to anyone who traveled with their own backgammon set. I told Bob that I was not going to play for money, no way. He pushed a bit, but finally said fine. He proceeded instead to give me a free lesson in the art and
