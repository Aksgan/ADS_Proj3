[[David Deutsch]] in 1985, took the ideas further and described a [[universal quantum computer]]. In 1996, [[Seth Lloyd]] showed that a standard [[quantum computer]] can be programmed to simulate any local quantum system efficiently.<ref name=Lloyd1996>{{Cite journal | title = Universal quantum simulators | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/273/5278/1073 | year = 1996 | author = Lloyd, S. | journal = Science | pages = 1073 | volume = 273 | issue = 5278 | accessdate = 2009-07-08 | doi = 10.1126/science.273.5278.1073 | pmid = 8688088 }}</ref> A [[quantum system]] of many particles is described by a [[Hilbert space]] whose dimension is exponentially large in the number of particles. Therefore, the obvious approach to simulate such a system requires exponential time on a [[computer|classical computer]]. However, it is conceivable that a quantum system of many particles could be simulated by a quantum computer using a number of [[qubit|quantum bits]] similar to the number of particles in the original system. As shown by Lloyd, this is true for a class of quantum systems known as ''local'' quantum systems. This has been extended to much larger classes of quantum systems.<ref>{{cite arxiv|eprint=quant-ph/0301023v2|author1=Dorit Aharonov|author2=Amnon Ta-Shma|title=Adiabatic Quantum State Generation and Statistical Zero Knowledge|class=quant-ph|year=2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite arxiv|eprint=quant-ph/0508139|last1=Berry | first1=Dominic W.|author2=Graeme Ahokas|author3=Richard Cleve|last4=Sanders | first4=Barry C.|title=Efficient quantum algorithms for simulating sparse Hamiltonians|class=quant-ph|year=2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite arxiv| eprint=0810.0312v2| last1=Childs | first1=Andrew M.| title=On the relationship between continuous- and discrete-time quantum walk| class=quant-ph| year=2008}}</ref> ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.ceid.upatras.gr/tech_news/papers/quantum_theory.pdf Deutsch's 1985 paper] *[http://www.phy.mtu.edu/~sgowtham/PH4390/Week_02/IJTP_v21_p467_y1982.pdf Richard P.

In economics a population to be measured is described as a "universe", and the measures which are generated are intended to reflect the behavior of that population. Different [[statistical survey]]s may measure related, but different, universes and have to be adjusted to reflect this difference. For example the American [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] has a [[household survey]] and an [[establishment survey]] to measure employment. The differences in the populations and behavior that these two surveys measure are said to be the differences in their "universe". The word has a similar meaning in marketing, where it describes the activity in a given population. For example, [[ASCAP]] measures airplay in different radio "universes" to determine royalties for different songs, because e.g. air play in the "classical" universe is compensated differently from popular music. It also fundamental to [[television audience measurement]]: advertisers buy into programmes based on the ratings in different [[demographic]] universes and those different universes will cost different amounts. For example, a [[Hair coloring|hair dye]] [[ad campaign]] may buy 1000 [[Nielsen ratings|Gross Rating Points (GRP)]] in the Women 25-44 universe in order to target that particular audience, rather than a demographic irrelevant to their product. ==See also== * [[Universe (mathematics)]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Universe (Economics)}} [[Category:Economic data]] [[da:Population (statistik)]] [[es:Población estadística]] [[nl:Populatie (statistiek)]] [[ja:母集団]] [[pl:Populacja statystyczna]] [[su:Populasi statistik]]</text> </page> <page> <id>38940</id> <title>University of California, Berkeley</title> <text>{{Infobox university |name = University of California, Berkeley |motto = {{lang-la|[[Fiat Lux]]}} |mottoeng = [[Let there be light|Let There be Light]] |image_name = University of California Seal.svg |image_size = 200px |caption = [[Seal (device)|Seal]] of the University of California, Berkeley |established = March 23, 1868 |type = [[public university|Public]] |calendar = Semester |endowment = [[United States dollar|USD $]]2.34 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] (June 30, 2009) <ref>[http://www.ucop.edu/treasurer/foundation/foundation.pdf UC Annual Endowment Report] ''Office of the Treasurer of The Regents'.'
