pg. 452</ref> Even while the PDP-9 was being introduced, its replacement was being designed, and was introduced as 1969's [[PDP-15]], which re-implemented the PDP-9 using [[integrated circuits]] in place of modules. Much faster than the PDP-9 even in basic form, the PDP-15 also included a [[floating point unit]] and a separate [[input/output]] processor for further performance gains. Over 400 PDP-15's were ordered in the first eight months of production, and production eventually amounted to 790 examples in twelve basic models.<ref name=miller452/> However, by this time other machines in DEC's lineup could fill the same niche at even lower price points, and the PDP-15 would be the last of the 18-bit series. ===PDP-8 family=== [[Image:PDP-8.jpg|thumb|right|A PDP-8 on display at the [[Smithsonian]]'s [[National Museum of American History]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. This example is from the first generation of PDP-8s, built with discrete transistors and later known as the ''Straight 8''.]] In 1962, [[Lincoln Laboratory]] used a selection of System Building Blocks to implement a small 12-bit machine, and attached it to a variety of [[analog-to-digital]] (A to D) [[input/output]] (I/O) devices that made it easy to interface with various analog lab equipment. The [[LINC]] proved to attract intense interest in the scientific community, and has since been referred to as the first real [[minicomputer]],<ref>Wesley Clark, [http://www.historyofscience.com/G2I/timeline/index.php?id=1006 "The Linc, Perhaps the First Mini-Computer"], From Cave Paintings to the Internet</ref> a machine that was small and inexpensive enough to be dedicated to a single task even in a small lab. Seeing the success of the LINC, in 1963 DEC took the basic logic design but stripped away the extensive A to D systems to produce the [[PDP-5]]. The new machine, the first outside the PDP-1 mould, was introduced at [[WESTCON]] on 11 August 1963. A 1964 ad expressed the main advantage of the PDP-5, "Now you can own the PDP-5 computer for what a core memory alone used to cost: $27,000"<ref name=faqpdp8>[http://www.faqs.org/faqs/dec-faq/pdp8-models/section-1.html "DEC FAQ: What is a PDP-8?"]</ref> 116 PDP-5s were produced until the lines were shut down in early 1967. Like the PDP-1 before it, the PDP-5 inspired a series of newer models based on the same basic design that would go on to be more famous than its parent. On 22 March 1965, DEC introduced the [[PDP-8]], which replaced the PDP-5's modules with the new R-series modules using Flip Chips. The machine was re-packaged into a small tabletop case, which remains distinctive for its use of smoked plastic over the CPU which allowed one to easily see the wire-wrapped internals of the CPU. Sold standard with 4 kWords of 12-bit core memory and a [[ASR-33 Teletype]] for basic input/output, the machine listed for only $18,000. The PDP-8 is referred to as the first ''real'' [[minicomputer]] because of its sub-$25,000 price.<ref>[http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects/computing_and_data_processing/1982-960.aspx "DEC PDP-8 minicomputer, 1965"], ''The Science Museum''</ref><ref>[http://www.computerhistory.org/internet_history/ "Internet History:1965"], Computer History Museum</ref> Sales were, unsurprisingly, very strong, and helped by the fact that several competitors had just entered the market with machines aimed directly at the PDP-5's market space, which the PDP-8 trounced. This gave the company two years of unrestricted leadership,<ref>''Present'' 1978, pg. 7</ref> and eventually 1450 "straight eight" machines were produced before it was replaced by newer implementations of the same basic design.<ref name=faqpdp8/> DEC hit an even lower price-point with the PDP-8/S, the S for "serial". As the name implies the /S used a serial arithmetic unit, which was much slower but reduced costs so much that the system sold for under $10,000.<ref>''Present'' 1978, pg. 8</ref> DEC then used the new PDP-8 design as the basis for a new LINC, the two-processor [[LINC-8]]. The LINC-8 used one PDP-8 CPU and a separate LINC CPU, and included instructions to switch from one to the other. This allowed customers to run their existing LINC programs, or "upgrade" to the PDP-8, all in software. Although not a huge seller, 142 LINK-8s were sold starting at $38,500.<ref name=faqpdp8/> Like the original LINC to PDP-5 evolution, the LINC-8 was then modified into the single-processor [[PDP-12]], adding another 1000 machines to the 12-bit family.<ref name=faqpdp8/><ref name=miller456>Miller 1997, pg. 456</ref> Newer circuitry designs led to the PDP-8/I and PDP-8/L in 1968.<ref name=present10>''Present'' 1978, pg. 10</ref> In 1975, one year after an agreement between Digital and [[Intersil]], the [[Intersil 6100]] chip was launched, effectively a PDP-8 on a chip. This was a way to allow PDP-8 software to be run even after the official end-of-life announcement for the Digital PDP-8 product line. ===PDP-10 family=== [[Image:KA10 mod end.jpg|thumb|right|A "B" (blue) series Flip Chip module containing nine transistors, 1971]] While the PDP-5 introduced a lower-cost line, 1963's [[PDP-6]] was intended to take DEC into the [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] market with a [[36-bit]] machine. However, the PDP-6 proved to be a "hard sell" with customers, as it offered few advantages over similar machines from the better established vendors like [[IBM]] or [[Honeywell]], in spite of its low cost around $300,000. Only 23 were sold,<ref name=miller457>Miller 1997, pg. 457</ref> or 26 depending on the source,<ref>Gordon Bell, [http://research.microsoft.com/~gbell/Digital/timeline/1964-1.htm "DIGITAL Computing Timeline, 1964, PDP-6"]</ref> and unlike earlier models the low sales meant the PDP-6 was not improved with intermediate versions. However, the PDP-6 is historically important as the platform that introduced "Monitor", an early [[time-sharing]] [[operating system]] that would evolve into the widely used [[TOPS-10]].<ref>[http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp6/PDP-6_TimsharingBroch.pdf "PDP-6 Timesharing Software"], DEC Publication F-61B</ref> In spite of the PDP-6's limited commercial success, it introduced many features that clearly had commercial benefit. When the Flip Chip packaging allowed the PDP-6 to be re-implemented at a much lower cost, DEC took the opportunity to carry out a similar evolution of their 36-bit design and introduced the [[PDP-10]] in 1968. The PDP-10 was as much a success as the PDP-6 was a failure; during its lifetime about 700 mainframe PDP-10's were sold before production ended in 1984.<ref name=miller457/> The PDP-10 was widely used in university settings, and thus was the basis of many advances in computing and operating system design during the 1970s. DEC later re-branded all of the models in the 36-bit series as the "DECsystem-10", and PDP-10's are
