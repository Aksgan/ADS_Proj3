The relative sizes and separation of the Earth–Moon system are shown to scale.]] Another consequence of the finite speed of light is that communications between the Earth and spacecraft are not instantaneous. There is a brief delay from the source to the receiver, which becomes more noticeable as distances increase. This delay was significant for communications between [[Mission Control Center|ground control]] and [[Apollo 8]] when it became the first manned spacecraft to orbit the Moon: for every question, the ground control station had to wait at least three seconds for the answer to arrive.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.nasa.gov/ap08fj/15day4_orbits789.htm |title=Day 4: Lunar Orbits 7, 8 and 9 |work=The Apollo 8 Flight Journal |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2010-12-16 }}</ref> The communications delay between Earth and [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] can vary between five and twenty minutes depending upon the relative positions of the two planets. As a consequence of this, if a robot on the surface of Mars were to encounter a problem, its human controllers would not be aware of it until at least five minutes, and possibly up to twenty minutes, later; it would then take a further five to twenty minutes for instructions to travel from Earth to Mars. The speed of light can also be of concern over very short distances. In [[supercomputer]]s, the speed of light imposes a limit on how quickly data can be sent between [[central processing unit|processor]]s. If a processor operates at 1 [[gigahertz]], a signal can only travel a maximum of about {{convert|30|cm|ft|0}} in a single cycle. Processors must therefore be placed close to each other to minimize communication latencies; this can cause difficulty with cooling. If clock frequencies continue to increase, the speed of light will eventually become a limiting factor for the internal design of single [[integrated circuit|chips]].<ref name="processorlimit"/> ===Distance measurement=== [[Radar]] systems measure the distance to a target by the time it takes a radio-wave pulse to return to the radar antenna after being reflected by the target: the distance to the target is half the round-trip [[Radar#Transit time|transit time]] multiplied by the speed of light. A [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) receiver measures its distance to GPS satellites based on how long it takes for a radio signal to arrive from each satellite, and from these distances calculates the receiver's position. Because light travels about 300,000 kilometres (186,000 miles) in one second, these measurements of small fractions of a second must be very precise.

Due to the vast distances involved, it can take a very long time for light to travel from its source to Earth. For example, it has taken 13 billion (13{{e|9}}) years for light to travel to Earth from the faraway galaxies viewed in the [[Hubble Ultra Deep Field]] images.<ref name=Hubble>{{cite press |date=5 January 2010 |title=Hubble Reaches the "Undiscovered Country" of Primeval Galaxies |url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2010/02/full/ |publisher=[[Space Telescope Science Institute]] }}</ref><ref> {{cite web |title=The Hubble Ultra Deep Field Lithograph |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/283957main_Hubble_Deep_Field_Lithograph.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=2010-02-04 }}</ref> Those photographs, taken today, capture images of the galaxies as they appeared 13 billion years ago, when the universe was less than a billion years old.<ref name=Hubble/> The fact that more distant objects appear to be younger, due to the finite speed of light, allows astronomers to infer the [[evolution of stars]], [[Galaxy formation and evolution|of galaxies]], and [[history of the universe|of the universe]] itself.
