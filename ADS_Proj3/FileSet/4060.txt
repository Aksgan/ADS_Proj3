While some [[futurist]]s speculate on the possibility and nature of a technological singularity, Singularitarians believe it is not only possible, but desirable if guided safely.

In the same document, Yudkowsky described the [[technological utopianism]] at the heart of Singularitarianism as promising “[[apotheosis]]”: {{quotation|The Singularity holds out the possibility of winning the Grand Prize, the true Utopia, the best-of-all-possible-worlds - not just freedom from pain and stress or a sterile round of endless physical pleasures, but the prospect of endless growth for every human being - growth in mind, in intelligence, in strength of personality; life without bound, without end; experiencing everything we've dreamed of experiencing, becoming everything we've ever dreamed of being; not for a billion years, or ten-to-the-billionth years, but forever... or perhaps embarking together on some still greater adventure of which we cannot even conceive."<ref>http://yudkowsky.net/obsolete/principles.html The Singularitarian Principles by Eliezer Yudkowsky last updated 05/14/2001; page retrieved 9th November 2010</ref>}} In June 2000 Yudkowsky, with the support of [[Internet entrepreneur]]s Brian Atkins and Sabine Atkins, founded the [[Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence]] to work towards the creation of self-improving [[Friendly artificial intelligence|Friendly AI]]. The Singularity Institute's writings argue for the idea that an AI with the ability to improve upon its own design ([[Seed AI]]) would rapidly lead to [[superintelligence]]. These Singularitarians believe that reaching the Singularity swiftly and safely is the best possible way to minimize net [[existential risk]]. Many people believe a technological singularity is possible without adopting Singularitarianism as a moral philosophy. Although the exact numbers are hard to quantify, Singularitarianism is presently a small movement, which includes British [[transhumanism|transhumanist]] philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]]. American inventor and futurist [[Ray Kurzweil]], who predicts [[The Singularity Is Near#2045: The Singularity|the Singularity will occur in 2045]], greatly contributed to popularizing Singularitarianism with his 2005 book ''[[The Singularity Is Near|The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology ]]''.<ref name="Kurzweil 2005"/> {{quotation|What, then, is the Singularity?
