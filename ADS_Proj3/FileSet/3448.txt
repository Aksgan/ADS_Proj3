This can be particularly noticeable in environments where many machines individually retrieve updates over a shared, bandwidth constrained link such as those found in many small to medium sized businesses. To some extent the bandwidth demands of patching a group of computers can be alleviated by deploying [[Windows Server Update Services]]. == See also == *[[History of Microsoft Windows]] *[[Windows Update]] *[[Full disclosure]] ==References== {{Reflist|1}} *{{cite news | last =Evers | first =Joris | title =Microsoft pulls 'critical' Windows update | work = | pages = | language = | publisher =CNET News.com | date =2005-09-09 | url =http://news.com.com/Microsoft+pulls+critical+Windows+update/2100-7349_3-5857338.html | accessdate = 2006-12-12 }} == External links == *[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletinsandadvisories/default.mspx Microsoft: Bulletins and Advisories] ([http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/current.aspx Security Bulletin List and Search]) *[http://support.microsoft.com Microsoft Support Website] *[http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/07/zeroday_microso.html Bruce Schneier's blog] - Example of report about vulnerability found in the wild with timing seemingly coordinated with "Patch Tuesday". *[http://blog.metasploit.com/2010/08/exploiting-dll-hijacking-flaws.html HD Moore: Exploiting DLL Hijacking Flaws HD Moore's blog] - Report on [[DLL Hijacking]] vulnerability and exploit that led to many patches on Patch Tuesday in August 2010 *[http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/09/microsoft_and_f.html Bruce Schneier's blog] - Example of a quick patch response, not due to a security issue but for DRM-related reasons. [[Category:Computer security procedures]] [[Category:Microsoft culture]] [[Category:History of Microsoft]] [[de:Patch Day]] [[fr:Patch Tuesday]] [[hu:Patch Tuesday]] [[nl:Patch Tuesday]]</text> </page> <page> <id>28598</id> <title>Patch panel</title> <text>[[File:Patchpanel2.JPG|thumb|200px|right|A remote broadcast trailer's jackfield]][[Image:EthernetPatchPanelDiagram.png|thumb|200px|right|Diagram of an Ethernet network with a patch panel]]A '''patch panel''' or '''patch bay''' is a panel, typically [[rackmount]]ed, that houses [[cable]] connections. One typically shorter [[patch cable]] will plug into the front side, whereas the back holds the connection of a much longer and more permanent cable. The assembly of [[hardware]] is arranged so that a number of [[circuit (telecom)|circuit]]s, usually of the same or similar type, appear on jacks for monitoring, interconnecting, and testing circuits in a convenient, flexible manner. Patch panels offer the [[convenience]] of allowing technicians to quickly change the path of select [[signalling (telecommunication)|signal]]s, without the [[expense]] of dedicated [[switching]] equipment. This was first used by early [[telephone exchanges]], where the [[telephone switchboard]] (a massive array of patch panels) and a large room full of [[telephone operator]]s running it was ubiquitous. ==Uses and connectors== In recording studios, television and radio broadcast studios, and concert sound reinforcement systems, patchbays are widely used to facilitate the connection of different devices, such as microphones, electric or electronic instruments, effects (e.g. compression, reverb, etc.), recording gear, amplifiers, or broadcasting equipment. Patchbays make it easier to connect different devices in different orders for different projects, because all of the changes can be made at the patchbay. As well, patchbays make it easier to troubleshoot problems such as ground loops; even small home studios and amateur project studios often use patchbays, because it groups all of the input jacks into one location. This means that devices mounted in racks or keyboard instruments can be connected without having to hunt around behind the rack or instrument with a flashlight for the right jack. Using a patchbay also saves wear and tear on the input jacks of studio gear and instruments, because all of the connections are made with the patchbay. ==Normalling== It is conventional to have the top row of jacks wired at the rear to outputs and bottom row of jacks wired to inputs. Patch bays may be half-normal (usually bottom) or full-normal, "normal" indicating that the top and bottom jacks are connected together internally. When a patch bay has half-normal wiring, then with no patch cord inserted into either jack, the top jack is internally linked to the bottom jack via break contacts on the bottom jack; inserting a patch cord into the top jack will take a feed off that jack whilst retaining the internal link between the two jacks; inserting a patch cord into the bottom jack will break the internal link and replace the signal feed from the top jack with the signal carried on the patch cord. If a patch bay is wired to full-normal, then it includes break contacts in both rows of jacks. [[Image:Theatpatchbay.JPG|thumb|right|200 px|A patch bay for patching circuits to [[stage lighting]] [[Stage lighting instrument|instruments]] ]] ==Switches== Dedicated switching equipment can be an alternative to patch bays in some applications. Switchers can make routing as easy as pushing a button, and can provide other benefits over patch bays, including routing a signal to any number of destinations simultaneously. However, switching equipment that can emulate the capabilities of a given patch bay is much more expensive. Example: a 16-point [[S-Video]] patch panel, with 8 patch cables, cost may start at $150.00{{Citation needed|reason=Link to an online store perhaps? Prices change, and this needs to be verified.|date=July 2009}}, and connect 8 inputs and 8 outputs. An S-Video matrix routing switcher with the same capability (8x8) would probably cost between $2,000.00 and $4,000.00 new, though it would probably have more capabilities, including [[audio-follow-video]] and built-in [[distribution amplifier]]s.
