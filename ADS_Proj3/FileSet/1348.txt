a [[Mozilla Firefox]] extension authored by Arturo '[[Buanzo]]' Busleiman which uses [[GnuPG]] to implement [[OpenPGP]]-signed HTTP requests. As of June/2007, OpenPGP encryption is being implemented. Some people believe it to be an alternative for the [[Secure Sockets Layer]] method for encrypting [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (or ''HTTP'') connections. However, the author never had such an intention in his mind. Guaranteeing the identity of a requester and the integrity of the request is Enigform's primary goal, through the use of [[digital signatures]]. In this instance, requests are [[form (web)|form]] submissions to web servers. [[Apache HTTP server]] support via the [[mod_openpgp]] module currently supports request verification. The project got its initial funding from [[OWASP]] in 2007. As of 2010, a secure instant messaging system based on Enigform and HTTPS has been announced during the OWASP Ibero-American Web-Application Security Conference. [[Vinton Cerf]] said that Enigform and mod_openpgp "[this] strikes me as a really interesting idea and I hope you ([[Buanzo]]) will pursue it with the W3C." (February 18, 2008). As of September 2, 2008 Enigform was granted the Trusted status on the Addons.Mozilla.Org website. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.buanzo.com.ar/2008/09/enigform-granted-trusted-status-in-addonsmozillaorg.html|title=Enigform granted Trusted Status in addons.mozilla.org|publisher=''[[Buanzo]]''|writer=Buanzo|date=2008-09-02}}</ref> On March 9, 2009, [[Buanzo]] committed to the mod_openpgp Subversion repository a Wordpress plugin (wp-enigform-authentication) that enables Enigform-based login to a Wordpress blog admin/user interface. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://twitter.com/buanzo/status/1301587617|title=Enigform for Wordpress twit|publisher=''[[Buanzo]]''|writer=Buanzo|date=2009-03-09}}</ref> On April 23rd, 2009, Enigform was declared Finalist in the Security category of Les Trophees du Libre, and was awarded the second prize. As of May 13th, 2010, the author has not received the prize money from the Les Trophees du Libre parent company, Cetril, and it seems the company has vanished. == External links == * [http://enigform.mozdev.org/ Enigform's Website on Mozdev.org] * [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4531 Enigform Extension for Firefox] * [http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/blogs/interview_with_arturo_busleiman Interview with Enigform's developer, Arturo "Buanzo" Busleiman] * [http://wiki.buanzo.org/index.php?n=Main.Wp-enigform-authentication Enigform: The Definitive Guide] * [http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-enigform-authentication/ Wordpress Enigform Authentication Plugin] * [http://wiki.buanzo.org/index.php?n=Main.Enigform-on-windows-installation Guide for Installing GnuPG and Enigform on Windows] * [http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_OpenPGP_Extensions_for_HTTP_-_Enigform_and_mod_openpgp Enigform at OWASP Projects] == References == {{reflist|2}} {{crypto-stub}} {{web-software-stub}} [[Category:Cryptographic software]] [[Category:Mozilla add-ons]] [[Category:PGP]] [[Category:Authentication methods]]</text> </page> <page> <id>12202</id> <title>Enrolled Actuary</title> <text>An '''Enrolled Actuary''' (or '''EA''') is an [[actuary]] who has been licensed by a Joint Board of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]] and the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] to perform a variety of actuarial tasks required of pension plans in the [[United States]] by the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] of 1974 (ERISA). As of November 2007, there were approximately 4,600 Enrolled Actuaries.<ref>{{USFR|72|61583}}</ref> == Qualifications == The [[Joint Board for the Enrollment of Actuaries]] administers two examinations to prospective Enrolled Actuaries. Once the two examinations have been passed, and an individual has also obtained sufficient relevant professional experience, that individual becomes an Enrolled Actuary. The first exam (EA-1) tests basic knowledge of the mathematics of compound interest, the mathematics of life contingencies, and practical demographic analysis. The second (EA-2) examination consists of two segments. Segment A covers the selection of actuarial assumptions, actuarial cost methods, and the calculation of minimum (required) and maximum (tax-deductible) contributions to pension plans. Segment B tests knowledge of relevant federal pension laws (in particular, the provisions of ERISA) as they affect pension actuarial practice. More detailed information about these examinations can be found on the websites of the [http://www.irs.gov/taxpros/actuaries/article/0,,id=97444,00.html Joint Board] or the [http://www.soa.org/ccm/content/?categoryID=214009 Society of Actuaries]. == Employers == Enrolled Actuaries generally work for [[Human Resource Consulting|human resource consulting]] firms, investment and insurance brokers, accounting firms, government organizations, and law firms. Some firms that employ Enrolled Actuaries combine two or more of these practice specialties. == Organizations == Many Enrolled Actuaries belong to one or more of the following organizations: the [[Society of Actuaries]], the [[American Academy of Actuaries]]. the [[Conference of Consulting Actuaries]] or the [[American Society of Pension Professionals and Actuaries]]. == Notes and references == <references/> *[http://www.irs.gov/taxpros/actuaries/index.html Joint Board for the Enrollment of Actuaries] [[Category:Actuarial science|Actuary]] [[Category:Mathematical science occupations|Actuary]] [[Category:Employee Retirement Income Security Act]]</text> </page> <page> <id>12227</id> <title>Enterprise Information Integration</title> <text>'''Enterprise Information Integration''' or '''EII''', is a process of [[information integration]], using [[data abstraction]] to provide a single interface (known as [[uniform data access]]) for viewing all the data within an organization, and a single set of structures and naming conventions (known as [[uniform information representation]]) to represent this data; the goal of EII is to get a large set of [[heterogeneous]] data sources to appear to a user or system as a single, homogeneous data source. == Overview == [[Data]] within an [[Enterprise architecture|enterprise]] can be stored in various formats, including [[relational database]]s (which themselves come in a large number of varieties), text files, [[XML]] files, [[spreadsheet]]s and a variety of proprietary [[data storage device|storage]] methods, each with their own [[index (information technology)|indexing]] and [[data access]] methods. Standardized data access [[application programming interface|API]]s have emerged, that offer a specific set of commands to retrieve and modify data from a generic data source. Many applications exist that implement these APIs' commands across various data sources, most notably relational databases. Such APIs include [[ODBC]], [[JDBC]], [[OLE DB]], and more recently [[ADO.NET]]. There are also standard formats for representing data within a file, that are very important to information integration. The best-known of these is [[XML]], which has emerged as a standard universal representation format. There are also more specific XML "grammars" defined for specific types of data, such as [[Geography Markup Language]] for expressing geographical features, and [[Directory Service Markup Language]], for holding directory-style information. In addition, non-XML standard formats exist, such as [[iCalendar]], for representing calendar information, and [[vCard]], for [[business card]] information. Enterprise Information Integration (EII) applies data integration commercially. Despite the theoretical problems described above, the private sector shows more concern with the problems of data integration as a viable product.<ref name="refthree">{{cite conference | author=Alon Y.
