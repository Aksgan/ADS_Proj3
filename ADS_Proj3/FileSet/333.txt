Systems]] [[MicroStation]] [[Unix]]. The libraries of vehicles available for [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/swept_path/ swept path] [[simulation]] and analysis was limited and vehicle simulations could only be carried out in a forward direction. AutoTURN 2.0 was compatible with AutoCAD Release 10 and then [[Unix]] version of MicroStation V 3.4. *AutoTURN 3.0 was released in [[1993]], less than 1 year after AutoTURN 2.0. The 3.0 release version of AutoTURN included many upgrades over its predecessor. This version of AutoTURN included larger vehicle libraries, and a supplement for use with aircraft (This supplement would become expanded into a separate software called AutoTURN Aircraft in [[1995]]). Among other improvements, AutoTURN 3.0 enabled users to run simultaneous [[simulation]]s of two vehicles in forward and reverse directions in a stop motion (frame by frame) animation. Simulations could only be done from pre-drawn paths. *In [[2000]] the release of AutoTURN 4.0 accounted for international users, it was the first version of AutoTURN available in multiple languages. Among other improvements, AutoTURN 4.0 included expanded international libraries of vehicles. To incorporate the many new capabilities it was necessary to make significant changes to the program’s visual [[User interface|interface]] and functionality. The change in interface included a new [[toolbar]]. Generate simulation tools were introduced so users didn’t first have to draw the vehicle path in order to generate a simulation. AutoTURN 4 introduced the concepts of Active Path and Active Simulation allowing for repetition of various functions without repeated re-selecting of objects. Like the previous release versions, AutoTURN 4.0 contained a supplement for aircraft. *AutoTURN 5.0’s release in 2004, among many other functions, introduced [[Heuristic]] [[algorithm]]s for tracking, creation of simulations on spline elements, and improved layer management for simulations. The standard vehicle library file was changed to a searchable [[database]] of vehicles based on international or custom standards. Adding to those features AutoTURN 5.1 introduces the ability to set Steering Linkage ratios between the front and rear steering axle groups. Additionally, in the 5.1 version could continuously loop simulations. *The 2008 release of AutoTURN 6.0 added additional simulation functions. It builds on version 5.1’s abilities to loop simulations by adding the ability to export simulations to InVision (a separate software application) in order to create video clips. Plan view and chamfered vehicles can be used for simulations and or modified in this version. ==Release history== {| class="wikitable" |- ! Name ! Version ! Date Released !

In this way the set ''as a whole'' is said to be [[autocatalysis|autocatalytic]]. Autocatalytic sets were originally and most concretely defined in terms of [[molecular entity|molecular entities]], but have more recently been metaphorically extended to the study of systems in [[sociology]] and [[economics]]. Autocatalytic sets also have the ability to replicate themselves if they are split apart into two physically separated spaces. Computer models illustrate that split autocatalytic sets will reproduce all of the reactions of the original set in each half, much like cellular [[mitosis]]. In effect, using the principles of autocatalysis, a small metabolism can replicate itself with very little high level organization. This property is why autocatalysis is a contender as the foundational mechanism for complex evolution. Prior to [[Watson and Crick]], biologists considered autocatalytic sets the way [[metabolism]] functions in principle, i.e. one [[protein]] helps to synthesize another protein and so on. After the discovery of the [[double helix]], the [[central dogma of molecular biology]] was formulated, which is that [[DNA]] is transcribed to [[RNA]] which is translated to protein. The molecular structure of DNA and RNA, as well as the metabolism that maintains their reproduction, are believed to be too complex to have arisen spontaneously in one step from a soup of chemistry. Several models of the origin of life are based on the notion that life may have arisen through the development of an initial molecular autocatalytic set which evolved over time. Most of these models which have emerged from the studies of [[complex system]]s predict that life arose not from a molecule with any particular trait (such as self-replicating [[RNA World|RNA]]) but from an autocatalytic set. The first empirical support came from Lincoln and Joyce, who obtained autocatalytic sets in which "two [RNA] enzymes catalyze each other’s synthesis from a total of four component substrates."<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lincoln TA, Joyce GF | title = Self-sustained replication
