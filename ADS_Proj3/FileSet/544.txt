and possibly exam and report-writing requirements) before acquiring the professional qualification. Once all the requirements are satisfied and depending on the academic route undertaken by the engineer, he or she is designated the title of either '''Chartered Engineer''' ([[CEng]]), '''Incorporated Engineer''' ([[IEng]]) or '''Engineering Technician''' ([[EngTech]]). For more information, please refer to [[CIBSE]]. There are international engineering agreements between relevant professional bodies which are designed to allow engineers to practice across international borders. Note that the term Chartered Engineer is mainly used in the UK and in most Commonwealth countries. In the European Union, '''European Engineer''' is used instead. ==Notable people== Some notable people who contributed towards the building services field include: *[[Ove Arup]] *[[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] *[[Edmund Happold|Ted Happold]] *[[Ken Yeang]] ==Companies== Some of the companies which provide building services engineering as part of their technical expertise are as follows: {{columns-list|2| *[[AECOM]] *[[Arup]] *[[WS Atkins|Atkins Ltd]] *[[Buro Happold]] *[[Building Design Partnership]] *[[Cundall Johnston and Partners|Cundall]] *[[Gifford (company)]] *[[Halcrow Group Limited]] *[[Hoare Lea]] *[http://www.kingshaw.co.uk KingShaw Associates] *[[Mott MacDonald]] *[[Parsons Brinckerhoff]] *[[Scott Wilson Group]] *[[WSP Group]] *[http://www.maxfordham.com Max Fordham LLP] }} ==See also== {{columns-list|3| *[[American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers]] *[[Architectural engineering]] *[[Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers]] *[[Civil engineering]] *[[Construction management]] *[[Electrical engineering]] *[[Environmental engineering]] *[[Fire protection engineering]] *[[Geotechnical engineering]] *[[Hydraulic engineering]] *[[Mechanical engineering]] *[[Project management]] *[[Quantity surveying]] *[[Structural engineering]] *[[Sustainable design]] *[[Transportation engineering]] }} ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.ashrae.org/ ASHRAE] American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers *[http://www.bsria.co.uk/ BSRIA] The Building Services Research and Information Association *[http://www.cibse.org/ CIBSE] Chartered Institute of Building Services Engineers *[http://www.modbs.co.uk/ Modern Building Services journal] *[http://www.arca53.dsl.pipex.com/ Online Building Services Engineering Lecture Notes] {{Technology}} {{Academic degrees}} {{Sustainability}} [[Category:Building engineering]] [[Category:Engineering occupations]] [[Category:Engineering]] [[Category:Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning]] [[Category:Construction]] [[zh:建筑设备]]</text> </page> <page> <id>4708</id> <title>Bukit Tagar Landfill</title> <text>'''Bukit Tagar Landfill''' is a landfill in [[Bukit Tagar]], [[Selangor]]. == References == {{Unreferenced|date=November 2008}} <references /> == Further reading == * {{cite paper|title=Bukit Tagar Landfill|publisher=Tonkin & Taylor|format=PDF|url=http://tonkin.co.nz/projects/pdfs/BukitTagarLandfill.pdf|date=2008-08-18}} * {{cite conference|title=LEACHATE GENERATION AND TREATMENT AT THE BUKIT TAGAR LANDFILL, MALAYSIA|author=A.
