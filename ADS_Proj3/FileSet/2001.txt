of major phenomena surrounding them."<ref name = "vrshvy">[http://old.sigchi.org/cdg/cdg2.html#2_1 ACM SIGCHI Curricula for Human-Computer Interaction]</ref> An important facet of HCI is the securing of user satisfaction (see [[Computer user satisfaction]]). Because human-computer interaction studies a human and a machine in conjunction, it draws from supporting knowledge on both the machine and the human side. On the machine side, techniques in [[computer graphics]], [[operating systems]], [[programming language]]s, and development environments are relevant. On the human side, [[communication theory]], graphic and industrial design disciplines, [[linguistics]], [[social sciences]], [[cognitive psychology]], and [[human factors]] are relevant. Engineering and design methods are also relevant. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of HCI, people with different backgrounds contribute to its success. HCI is also sometimes referred to as '''man–machine interaction (MMI)''' or '''computer–human interaction (CHI)'''. Attention to human-machine interaction is important, because poorly designed human-machine interfaces can lead to many unexpected problems. A classic example of this is the [[Three Mile Island accident]] where investigations concluded that the design of the human-machine interface was at least partially responsible for the disaster.<ref>http://www.ergoweb.com/news/detail.cfm?id=352</ref> Similarly, accidents in aviation have resulted from manufacturers' decisions to use non-standard [[Flight_instruments#Layout|flight instrument]] and/or [[throttle]] quadrant layouts: even though the new designs were proposed to be superior in regards to basic human-machine interaction, pilots had already ingrained the "standard" layout and thus the conceptually good idea actually had undesirable results. ==Goals== A basic goal of HCI is to improve the [[interactions]] between users and computers by making computers more [[usable]] and receptive to the user's needs. Specifically, HCI is concerned with: * methodologies and processes for designing interfaces (i.e., given a task and a class of users, design the best possible interface within given constraints, optimizing for a desired property such as learnability or efficiency of use) * methods for implementing interfaces (e.g. software toolkits and [[library (computer science)|libraries]]; efficient [[algorithm]]s) * techniques for evaluating and comparing interfaces * developing new interfaces and [[interaction techniques]] * developing descriptive and predictive models and theories of interaction A long term goal of HCI is to design systems that minimize the barrier between the human's cognitive model of what they want to accomplish and the computer's understanding of the user's task. Professional practitioners in HCI are usually designers concerned with the practical application of design methodologies to real-world problems. Their work often revolves around designing [[graphical user interface]]s and [[web design|web interfaces]]. Researchers in HCI are interested in developing new design methodologies, experimenting with new hardware devices, prototyping new software systems, exploring new paradigms for interaction, and developing models and theories of interaction. ==Differences with related fields== HCI differs from [[human factors]] in that with HCI the focus is more on users working specifically with computers, rather than other kinds of machines or designed artifacts. There is also a focus in HCI on how to implement the computer software and hardware mechanisms to support human-computer interaction. Thus, [[human factors]] is a broader term; HCI could be described as the human factors of computers - although some experts try to differentiate these areas. According to some experts,{{Who|date=July 2009}} HCI also differs from [[ergonomics]] in that there is less of a focus on repetitive work-oriented tasks and procedures, and much less emphasis on physical stress and the physical form or [[industrial design]] of the user interface, such as [[computer keyboard|keyboards]] and [[mouse (computing)|mice]]. However, this does not take a full account of [[ergonomics]], the oldest areas of which were mentioned above, but which more recently has gained a much broader focus (equivalent to [[human factors]]). [[Cognitive ergonomics]], for example, is a part of ergonomics, of which ''software ergonomics'' (an older term, essentially the same as HCI) is a part.<ref>More discussion of the differences between these terms can be found in the [http://sigchi.org/cdg/cdg2.html ACM SIGCHI Curricula for Human-Computer Interaction]</ref> Three areas of study have substantial overlap with HCI even as the focus of inquiry shifts. In the study of [[personal information management]] (PIM), human interactions with the computer are placed in a larger informational context - people may work with many forms of information, some computer-based, many not (e.g., whiteboards, notebooks, sticky notes, refrigerator magnets) in order to understand and effect desired changes in their world. In [[computer supported cooperative work]] (CSCW), emphasis is placed on the use of computing systems in support of the collaborative work of a group of people. The principles of [[human interaction management]] (HIM) extend the scope of CSCW to an organizational level and can be implemented without use of computer systems. ==Design principles== When evaluating a current [[user interface]], or designing a new user interface, it is important to keep in mind the following experimental design principles: * Early focus on user(s) and task(s): Establish how many users are needed to perform the task(s) and determine who the appropriate users should be; someone who has never used the interface, and will not use the interface in the future, is most likely not a valid user. In addition, define the task(s) the users will be performing and how often the task(s) need to be performed. * [[Empirical]] measurement: Test the interface early on with real users who come in contact with the interface on an everyday basis. Keep in mind that results may be altered if the performance level of the user is not an accurate depiction of the real human-computer interaction. Establish quantitative usability specifics such as: the number of users performing the task(s), the time to complete the task(s), and the number of errors made during the task(s). * [[Iterative design]]: After determining the users, tasks, and empirical measurements to include, perform the following iterative design steps: # Design the user interface # Test # Analyze results # Repeat Repeat the iterative design process until a sensible, user-friendly interface is created.<ref>Green, Paul (2008).
