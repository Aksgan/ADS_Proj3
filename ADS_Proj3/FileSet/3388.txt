By version 7.0 of the package in 1991 several [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] programs had been added to it. Though the 7.0 version sold well, it was criticised in computer trade publications for being overly complicated and riddled with bugs. It was widely considered to have been rushed to publication, despite the objections of many of Central Point Software's employees. {{Fact|date=February 2007}} PC Tools Version 9.x for DOS was the last stable release. In June 1994 Central Point was acquired by their top competitor [[Symantec]] who ultimately discontinued the product line. PC Tools was the main competitor to [[Norton Utilities]], which Symantec had acquired in 1990. Symantec now uses the PC Tools brand name&mdash;acquired from an Australian security vendor in 2008<ref>PC World, [http://www.pcworld.com/article/150227/symantec_buys_pc_tools.html Symantec buys PC Tools]</ref>&mdash;for low-cost antivirus and antispyware software<ref>[http://www.pctools.com/]</ref> == Utilities included == * PC Shell — a file manager, capable amongst other things of displaying the contents of data files used by various popular database, word-processor, and spreadsheet packages * PC-Cache — a licensed disk cache of HyperCache from the HyperDisk Speed Kit * [[Central Point Anti-Virus]] &mdash; an antivirus program. * Central Point Backup — a [[backup]] utility for archiving and restoring data to and from disc or tape.
