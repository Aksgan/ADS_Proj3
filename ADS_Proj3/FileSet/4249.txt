'''SLoc''' is the basis for the mathematical area of [[pointless topology]], that is devoted to the study of '''Loc''' - the category of all locales of which '''SLoc''' is a full subcategory. The involved constructions are characteristic for this kind of duality, and are detailed below. Now one can easily obtain a number of other dualities by restricting to certain special classes of sober spaces: * The category '''CohSp''' of [[coherent space|coherent]] sober spaces (and coherent maps) is equivalent to the category '''CohLoc''' of [[coherent locale|coherent (or spectral) locales]] (and coherent maps), on the assumption of the [[Boolean prime ideal theorem]] (in fact, this statement is equivalent to that assumption). The significance of this result stems from the fact that '''CohLoc''' in turn is dual to the category '''DLat''' of [[distributivity (order theory)|distributive]] [[lattice (order)|lattices]]. Hence, '''DLat''' is dual to '''CohSp''' - one obtains '''[[Stone's representation theorem for distributive lattices]]'''. * When restricting further to coherent sober spaces which are [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], one obtains the category '''Stone''' of so-called [[Stone space]]s. On the side of '''DLat''', the restriction yields the subcategory '''Bool''' of [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebras]]. Thus one obtains [[Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras]]. * Stone's representation for distributive lattices can be extended via an equivalence of coherent spaces and [[Priestley space]]s (ordered topological spaces, that are [[compact space|compact]] and totally order-disconnected). One obtains a representation of distributive lattices via ordered topologies: [[Priestley's representation theorem for distributive lattice]]s. Many other Stone-type dualities could be added to these basic dualities. == Duality of sober spaces and spatial locales == This section motivates and explains one of the most basic constructions of Stone duality: the duality between topological spaces which are ''sober'' and frames (i.e. [[complete Heyting algebra]]s) which are ''spatial''. This classical piece of mathematics requires a substantial amount of abstraction that usually tends to puzzle beginners. It should therefore be considered as graduate level mathematics. Some prior exposure to the basics of [[category theory]] is recommended, although a deep understanding of the concepts of adjunction and duality may well arise from examples such as the result below. Furthermore, concepts of [[topology]] and [[order theory]] are naturally involved as well, where the later is probably more important for a thorough understanding. === The lattice of open sets === The starting point for the theory is the fact that every topological space is characterized by a set of points ''X'' and a system &Omega;(''X'') of [[open set]]s of elements from ''X'', i.e. a subset of the [[powerset]] of ''X''. It is known that &Omega;(''X'') has certain special properties: it is a [[complete lattice]] within which [[supremum|suprema]] and [[infimum|infima]] of finite sets are given by set unions and finite set intersections, respectively. Furthermore, it contains both ''X'' and the [[empty set]]. Since the [[order embedding|embedding]] of &Omega;(''X'') into the powerset lattice of ''X'' [[limit preserving (order theory)|preserves]] finite infima and arbitrary suprema, &Omega;(''X'') inherits the following distributivity law: :<math>x \wedge \bigvee S = \bigvee \{\, x \wedge s : s \in S \,\}, </math> for every element (open set) ''x'' and every subset ''S'' of &Omega;(''X''). Hence &Omega;(''X'') is not an arbitrary complete lattice but a ''complete Heyting algebra'' (also called ''frame'' or ''locale'' - the various names are primarily used to distinguish several categories that have the same class of objects but different morphisms: frame morphisms, locale morphisms and homomorphisms of complete Heyting algebras). Now an obvious question is: To what extent is a topological space characterized by its locale of open sets? As already hinted at above, one can go even further. The category '''Top''' of topological spaces has as morphisms the continuous functions, where a function ''f'' is continuous if the [[inverse image]] ''f''<sup> &minus;1</sup>(''O'') of any open set in the [[codomain]] of ''f'' is open in the [[domain of a function|domain]] of ''f''. Thus any continuous function ''f'' from a space ''X'' to a space ''Y'' defines an inverse mapping ''f''<sup> &minus;1</sup> from &Omega;(''Y'') to &Omega;(''X''). Furthermore, it is easy to check that ''f''<sup> &minus;1</sup> (like any inverse image map) preserves finite intersections and arbitrary unions and therefore is a ''morphism of frames''. If we define &Omega;(''f'') = ''f''<sup> &minus;1</sup> then &Omega; becomes a [[contravariant functor]] from the category '''Top''' to the category '''Frm''' of frames and frame morphisms. Using the tools of category theory, the task of finding a characterization of topological spaces in terms of their open set lattices is equivalent to finding a functor from '''Frm''' to '''Top''' which is [[adjoint functors|adjoint]] to &Omega;. === Points of a locale === The goal of this section is to define a functor pt from '''Frm''' to '''Top''' that in a certain sense "inverts" the operation of &Omega; by assigning to each locale ''L'' a set of points pt(''L'') (hence the notation pt) with a suitable topology. But how can we recover the set of points just from the locale, though it is not given as a lattice of sets? It is certain that one cannot expect in general that pt can reproduce all of the original elements of a topological space just from its lattice of open sets - for example all sets with the [[indiscrete topology]] yield (up to isomorphism) the same locale, such that the information on the specific set is no longer present. However, there is still a reasonable technique for obtaining "points" from a locale, which indeed gives an example of a central construction for Stone-type duality theorems. Let us first look at the points of a topological space ''X''. One is usually tempted to consider a point of ''X'' as an element ''x'' of the set ''X'', but there is in fact a more useful description for our current investigation. Any point ''x'' gives rise to a continuous function ''p''<sub>''x''</sub> from the one element topological space 1 (all subsets of which are open) to the space ''X'' by defining ''p''<sub>''x''</sub>(1) = ''x''. Conversely, any function from 1 to ''X'' clearly determines one point: the element that it "points" to. Therefore the
