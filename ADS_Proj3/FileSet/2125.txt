100|Paint and Paint}} '''Immaterialism''' is the theory propounded by [[George Berkeley|Bishop Berkeley]] in the 18th century which holds that there are no material objects, only minds and ideas in those minds. Berkeley summarized his theory with the motto "''esse est percipi''" ("To be is to be perceived"), but went on to elaborate it with [[God]] as the source of [[consensus reality]] and other particulars. Today this theory is considered the first formulation of [[subjective idealism]], a branch of [[idealism]] and a form of [[phenomenalism]]. Since it is not [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]], it is a theory not of [[science]] but of [[metaphysics]] and other philosophical methods. The idea that objects exist independently of mind is not testable or provable by the [[scientific method]], because all objects we would wish to examine must enter our awareness in order to experiment on them. Earlier ideas about the immaterial and the [[incorporeal]] go back to [[Plato]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Plotinus]], and many other ancient and medieval [[philosophers]]. [[Plato]] and [[Socrates]] made many references to eternal [[forms]] that are immaterial or [[incorporeal]]. A classic philosophical problem is whether or not there is a First Cause or [[Cosmological argument|Prime Mover]] of this material universe. Some philosophers also wondered if the universe was eternal or repeating for eternity. A main question being what truly is eternal or timeless? [[Aristotle]]'s notion of a [[formal cause]] is also partially related to Plato's idea of eternal [[Forms]]. Plato's theory of the [[divided line]] also mentions the [[intelligible]] method and the [[dialectical]] method that may lead one to [[The Good]], or to what truly exists eternally, without change. The Good, unlike changing physical bodies, is claimed to exist in some incorporeal or immaterial state. Many philosophers have contrasted the notions of [[being]] and [[becoming]] in a similar kind of way. [[Christian]] [[theology]] also refers to the incorporeal and immaterial in reference to [[God]], the [[Holy Spirit]], [[angels]], and [[demons]]. This is in contrast to the [[corporeal]] human body of the physical realm that decays over time. The incorporeal is unchanging, whereas the corporeal is ever changing. [[Jesus]] was [[resurrected]] in a mysterious way that suggests some kind of incorporeal [[soul]] that can exist independently of the physical body. The ghostly appearance of various [[saints]], [[prophet]]s, and other [[supernatural]] beings imply some kind of immaterial realm. Some supernatural [[miracle]]s can also imply the existence of the immaterial realm. If it is proven that consciousness can exist after death, this would require some kind of explanation that materialist theories alone cannot explain. Bishop Berkeley's assessment of immaterialism was criticized by [[Samuel Johnson]], as recorded by [[James Boswell]]. Responding to the theory, Dr. Johnson exclaimed "I refute it thus!" while kicking his shoe into a rock. This episode is cited by [[Stephen Dedalus]] in [[James Joyce]]'s "[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]," chapter three. Reflecting on the "ineluctable modality of the visible," Dedalus conjures the image of Johnson's refutation, before engaging in his own refutation - closing his eyes and feeling the rocks under his feet while walking along the beach. However Berkeley did not confine his theory to visual perception, but perception by any of the five senses. ==See also== {{Wiktionary|intelligible}} * [[George Berkeley]] * [[Consensus reality]] * [[Divided line]] * [[Empiricism]] * [[Forms]] * [[Idealism]] * [[Incorporeal]] * [[Intelligible]] * [[Immanuel Kant|Kant, Immanuel]] * [[Solipsism]] * [[Acosmism]] [[Category:Perception]] [[Category:Theories of mind]] [[Category:Idealism]] [[Category:George Berkeley]] [[it:Immaterialismo]] [[ru:Имматериализм]] [[tr:İmmateryalizm]]</text> </page> <page> <id>17984</id> <title>Immediate mode</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=March 2009}} {{Context|date=January 2011}} '''Immediate mode''' rendering is a style for [[application programming interface]]s of graphics libraries, in which client calls directly cause rendering of graphics objects to the display. It does not preclude the use of [[Multiple buffering|double-buffering]]. In contrast to [[retained mode]], lists of objects to be rendered are not saved by the API library. Instead, the application must re-issue all drawing commands required to describe the entire scene each time a new frame is required, regardless of actual changes. This method provides the maximum amount of control and flexibility to the application program. Although drawing commands have to be re-issued for each new frame, modern systems using this method are generally able to avoid the unnecessary duplication of more memory-intensive display data by referring to that unchanging data in the relatively short drawing commands. <!-- Link to textures, vertex buffers (in video memory) to explain last sentence? --> ==See also== * [[Display list]] * [[Retained mode]], the opposite of immediate mode * [[Scene graph]] [[Category:Computer graphics]] [[Category:OpenGL]] [[Category:DirectX]] [[nl:Immediate mode]]</text> </page> <page> <id>17992</id> <title>Immunocomputing</title> <text>Immunocomputing explores the principles of [[information processing]] that '''[[proteins]]''' and '''immune networks''' utilize in order to solve specific complex problems while protected from viruses, noise, errors and intrusions.

The INI is the first system to be delivered by the IMPACT Programme, set up to deliver improvements in the management and sharing of police operational information following Sir Michael Bichard’s report on the [[Soham Murders]]. == External links
