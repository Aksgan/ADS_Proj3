was an empirical study of the effects of modularity on program modifiability. He is the former executive director of COMSOFT, The Consortium for the Management of Emerging Software Technologies, from 1992 to 2001. Here he worked as the founding officer of a technology transfer and research consortium with emphasis on object technology. The COMSOFT sponsor list included [[NBC]], [[IBM]], [[AT&T]], [[Bell South]] and [[Nortel]]. He worked as the principle investigator of: “Enhanced Graphics Component for Eiffel” with a research grant from [[Eiffel Software|Interactive Software Engineering]] from 1988 to 1989. Here he supervised and assisted in the development of an enhanced, [X Window] based, graphics component for the object-oriented language “[[Eiffel]].” “Object Modeling and Value Project” with a research grant from [[AT&T]] from 1990 to 1992. “Object Metrics and Testing Project” with a research grant given by [[IBM]] and BRN from 1990 to 1994. ==Publications== Tim Korson has published several articles and books.

It was designed by [[Clifford Konold]] and [[Craig Miller]] at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] and is published by [[Key Curriculum Press]]. It has some similarities with [[Fathom (software)|Fathom]], and runs on [[Windows 98]] or later and [[Mac OS 10.1]] or later. The program allows users to enter their own [[data]] or to import them from other applications or [[the Web]]. The program also comes with 40 [[multivariate]] data sets. Using TinkerPlots, students can make a large variety of [[graphics|graphs]], including those specified for middle school in [[NCTM]]’s [[Principles and Standards for School Mathematics]]. But rather than making these graphs directly using commands, students construct them by progressively organizing cases using basic operations including “stack,” “order,” and “separate.” Responding to these operations, case icons animate into different screen positions. The interface was based on observations of people organizing “data cards” on a table to make graphs to answer specific questions <ref>Harradine, A., & Konold, C. (2006).
