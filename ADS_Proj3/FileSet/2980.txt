The colors shown above were taken from a vendor of "silver satin" flat 8-conductor phone cable that claims to be standard. 6-pair solid (old) bellwire cables previously used by the [[Bell System]] use white for pair 3 tip but some vendor's cable may substitute orange for white. At least one other vendor of flat 8-conductor cable uses the sequence blue, orange, black, red, green, yellow, brown and white/slate. *{{note|German colors|[b]}} This color scheme originates in the (withdrawn) national standard [[DIN 47100]]. The scheme shown here is the correct color code for interfacing with the RJ connector standards.<p>However, with German domestic telephone equipment (and that in some neighbouring countries), [[6P4C]] plugs and sockets are typically only used to connect the telephone cable to the phone base unit, whereas the mechanically different [[TAE connector|TAE plug]] is used at the other end of the cable. Older base units may accommodate the additional connectors of TAE (E, W, a2, b2) and may feature non-RJ standard sockets that can be connected „straight“ to TAE plugs. Further, flat DIN 47100 cables typically place the wires in ascending order. When used directly with 6P4C plugs, the colors will be garbled. ===Powered version of RJ11=== In the powered version, Pins 2 and 5 (black and yellow) may carry low voltage AC or DC power. While the phone line itself (tip and ring) supplies enough power for most telephone terminals, old telephone terminals with incandescent lights in them (such as the classic Western Electric [[Princess telephone|Princess]] and [[Trimline telephone]]s) need more power than the phone line can supply. Typically, the power on Pins 2 and 5 comes from a [[transformer]] plugged into a wall near one jack, supplying power to all of the jacks in the house. Trimline and Princess phone dial lights are rated at 6.3 volts and the transformer output is typically around 5 volts, providing a long service life for the [[incandescent lamp]]s. ===Compatibility with Structured Cabling=== With the rise of [[Ethernet]] [[local area network]]s operating over [[Category 5 cable|Cat5e]] and [[Category 6 cable|Cat6]] unshielded [[twisted pair]] cable, [[structured cabling]] networks adhering to [[TIA/EIA-568-B]] are widely used for both computer networking and analog telephony. The [[8P8C]] ("RJ45") jack used by TIA/EIA-568-B physically accepts the 6-position connector used by RJ11, RJ14 and RJ25, but only RJ11 and RJ14 have full electrical compatibility. TIA/EIA-568-B "splits" the third pair of RJ25 across two separate cable pairs, rendering it unusable. This was necessary to preserve the electrical properties of those pairs for Ethernet, which operates at much higher frequencies than analog telephony. Both the third and fourth pairs of RJ61 are similarly split. Because of this incompatibility, and because they were never very common to begin with, the TIA/EIA-568-B conventions are displacing RJ25 and RJ61 for telephones with more than two lines. ==8P8C== {{about|the generic 8P8C [[modular connector]]|the RJ45 connector used in telephone installations|RJ45|the Registered Jack (RJ) wiring standard|Registered jack}} [[File:Uncrimped rj-45 connector close-up.jpg|thumb|right|An 8P8C modular plug before being [[Crimp (joining)|crimped]] onto a cable]] [[File:Ethernet RJ45 connector p1160054.jpg|thumb|Connector and cable]] The '''8P8C''' ('''8 Position 8 Contact''', also [[backronym]]ed as '''8 position 8 conductor'''; often called '''[[RJ45]]'''<ref>{{cite book | last = Trulove | first = James | title = LAN wiring | edition = 3rd | date = December 19, 2005 | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill Professional]] | isbn = 0-07-145975-8 | page = 23 | chapter = Designing LAN Wiring Systems | quote = The 8-pin modular jack is sometimes referred to as an "RJ-45," because the connector/jack components are the same.

These connectors are commonly used for [[Ethernet over twisted pair]], [[Registered jack]]s and other [[telephone]] applications, [[RS-232]] serial using the [[EIA/TIA 561]] and [[RS-232#Connectors|Yost]] standards, and other applications involving [[unshielded twisted pair]], [[shielded twisted pair]], and multiconductor flat cable. An 8P8C modular connector has two paired components: the male plug and the female jack, each with eight equally-spaced conducting channels. On the plug, these conductors are flat contacts positioned parallel with the connector body. Inside the jack, the conductors are suspended diagonally toward the insertion interface. When an 8P8C plug is mated with an 8P8C jack, the conductors meet and create an electrical connection. Spring tension in the jack's conductors ensure a good interface with the plug and allow for slight travel during insertion and removal.
