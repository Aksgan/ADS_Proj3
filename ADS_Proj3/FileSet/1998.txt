the establishment of an aged and infirm ministers' fund in the Baptist Church, and much assistance was given to the building of churches in various parts of the state. A sum of Â£20,000 was used to build a cancer wing at the Ryde home for incurables. But the gifts of Dixson and his wife were both many and varied. Both worked on committees, and Dixson at various times was president of the Baptist Union, of the Baptist Home Mission Society, and of the [[Young Men's Christian Association]]. Dixson was a noted horticulturist, becoming a member of the [[Linnean Society of New South Wales]] in 1887 and the [[Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1898. Dixson died at [[Colombo]] on 11 May 1926. He was knighted in 1921. He married in 1866 Emma Elizabeth (died 1922) daughter of William Edward Shaw, and was survived by two sons and four daughters. Dixson's elder son, Sir William Dixson (born 1870) made a remarkable collection of pictures, books, manuscripts, prints, maps and charts, relating to Australia, all destined to become the property of the state of New South Wales. A large collection of pictures was presented in 1929 and housed in the William Dixson gallery at the [[State Library of New South Wales|Mitchell library, Sydney]]. Dixson was knighted in 1939. In addition to seeking to fund a battleship for England Dixson supported other patriotic causes. One such as the Legion of Frontiersmen: The Legion of Frontiersmen is a patriotic paramilitary organisation formed in Britain in 1905 by Roger Pocock, a former Constable with the North West Mounted Police and Boer War veteran, to bolster the defensive capacity of the British Empire. Prompted by pre-war fears of an impending invasion of Britain, the organisation was founded on a romanticized conception of the "frontier" and imperial idealism. Headquartered in London, branches of the Legion of Frontiersmen were formed throughout the empire to prepare patriots for war and to foster vigilance in peacetime. Despite persistent efforts, the Legion never achieved more than sporadic and tenuous official recognition, but it raised battalions[citation needed] and its members enlisted en masse at the onset of the First World War. Frontiersmen also served as special constables in London for the duration of hostilities. Wartime casualties devastated the Legion of Frontiersmen, and except for a brief resurgence in the interwar period, a series of schisms and sectarianism prevented attempts to reinvigorate the movement. Various Legion of Frontiersmen groups still exist throughout the Commonwealth, but as a whole, it has been unable to define its niche in the post-imperial world. The League of Frontiersmen purports to represent Frontiersmen worldwide through its International Frontiersmen Council.[citation needed] Legion in NSW A Maj.C A McBride a Dentist of Challis House, Martin Place in Sydney stated he was local HQ of the Legion with about 80 members in Sydney. In December 1911 Henry Frankford was made a Lt and took command of the NSW Units. A former soldier Frankfort soon begun a reorganisation of the NSW members. President was Hugh Dixson Esq, two Vice Presidents were appointed Col K Mackay CB MLC and H D Morton Esq MLA. The real control however was held by Lt H L A Frankford his Org Off was 2nd Lt J Suffern the Sect. was 2nd Lt Albert J Fisher Asst Sect. was F/M L Borgnis. The Legion Taylor was F/M Geo Graham of 335a George St. On the 8th of October 1912 Capt Henry Frankford, Commandant of the NSW Command did a tour of country units and inspected the Casino Troop. He expressed satisfaction at the progress of their work they had done and complimented the men on such.

This is because Human68K doesn't care about porting to other hardware platform at all. Hardware-dependent things are done by [[X68000]]'s [[IOCS]].
