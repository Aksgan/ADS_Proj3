Often, the main content is loading in the background, while the animated content is displayed in the foreground. The intent is to captivate the user's attention so that he or she does not stray from the site, although it may do the opposite as it slows the user from accessing the actual site and can be tedious for users with slow internet connections. Often a "skip" or "skip intro" button is prepared to allow more immediate access to the site's homepage. ==Alternatives to Flash== ===HTML5=== {{main|HTML5 vs. Flash}} [[HTML 5]] is gaining ground as a competitor to Flash: the [[canvas element]] assists animation, and text can be more easily synchronized with audio and video element timeupdate events. In one example of this, [[Scribd]], a 50 million user a month document sharing website, announced in May 2010 that after three years of investment in Flash, it is changing from that platform to the HTML5 standard.<ref>{{cite web|last=Metz|first=Cade|title=50 million user Scribd scraps Flash for HTML5|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/05/06/scribd_ditches_flash_for_html5/|publisher=The Register|accessdate=2010-09-17}}</ref> Youtube introduced HTML5 support in January 2010<ref>http://www.youtube.com/html5</ref>, and on Jan 11 2011, the [[Google Chromium]] Project announced on their blog that support for closed codecs (particularly H.264) would be removed from future releases of Chrome. The Chromium announcement specifically mentioned that this was an effort to increase the use of license-free HTML5 and the <video> tag, and drive web-wide adoption of the open-source codecs [[VP8]] and [[Theora]]. ===Microsoft Silverlight=== In recent years, [[Microsoft Silverlight]] has emerged as a strong competitor to Flash{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}. While not yet as prevalent on websites as Flash, Silverlight has been used to provide video streaming for many high profile events, including the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://techcrunch.com/2008/01/06/microsoft-silverlight-gets-a-high-profile-win-2008-bejing-olympics/ |title=Microsoft Silverlight Gets a High Profile Win: 2008 Beijing Olympics| accessdate=2010-02-23}}</ref> the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in Vancouver,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-wins-the-2010-olympics-for-silverlight-2009-3 |title=Microsoft Wins The 2010 Olympics For Silverlight| accessdate=2010-02-23}}</ref> and the 2008 conventions for both major political parties in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2008/aug08/08-19conventions.mspx | title = Microsoft Working to Make Political Conventions Unconventional|accessdate=2010-02-23}}</ref> Silverlight is also used by [[Netflix]] for its instant video streaming service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://netflix.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&item=288 |title = Netflix Begins Roll-Out of 2nd Generation Media Player for Instant Streaming on Windows PCs and Intel Macs|accessdate=2010-02-23}}</ref> ===Java=== [[Java applet]]s are used both to create interactive visualisations and to present video, three dimensional objects and other media. Java applets are more appropriate for complex visualizations that require significant programming effort in high level language or communications between applet and originating server. Sun's new [[JavaFX]] is considered as another competitor for [[Rich Internet Applications]]. ===Other open alternatives=== {{See also|Open format}} There are equivalent open standards for many simple uses of Flash. Most notably the [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] and [[Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language|SMIL]] file formats, the ''canvas'', ''audio'' and ''video'' HTML elements, and the [[JavaScript]] programming language. More complex use cases can be achieved by combining these. The [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]]'s [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] and [[Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language|SMIL]] standards are seen as the nearest equivalents of Flash.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/09/12/svg.html |title=Picture Perfect |publisher=XML.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hofmanns.net/flash/AdobeFlash(formerlyMacromediaFlash)W3Cvalidandsearchmachine-friendlydetectingandembedding.pdf?attredirects=0&d=1 |title=xSWF: Flash W3C valid |publisher=Hofmanns.net |date= |accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref> [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] has supported SVG since version 8 and [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] has since version 3,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.svg.org/Opera|title=Opera |accessdate=2007-06-18|date=2006-12-27|work=Svg wiki |publisher=Svg.org}}</ref> and [[Mozilla Firefox]]'s built-in support for SVG continues to grow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://svg.org/story/2006/7/13/85643/0175|title=First Firefox 2.0 Beta Released|accessdate=2007-06-18 |last=Quint|first=Antoine|date=2006-07-13|publisher=Svg.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/SVG_improvements_in_Firefox_3|title=SVG improvements in Firefox 3 |accessdate=2008-07-20|work=Mozilla Developer Center|publisher=[[Mozilla]]|date=2008-06-17}}</ref> Adobe formerly developed and distributed the 'Adobe SVG Viewer' client plug-in for MS Internet Explorer, but discontinued support and distribution on January 1, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/svg/eol.html|title=Adobe to Discontinue Adobe SVG Viewer|accessdate=2007-06-18|publisher=[[Adobe Systems]]}}</ref> This was in a time when
