[[File:Heidelberg Universitätsbibliothek 2003.jpg|thumb|left|The [[University of Heidelberg]] was established in 1386.]] Since the 1960s, a reform movement attempted to unify secondary education in a ''Gesamtschule'' ([[comprehensive school]]). However, instead of overcoming the stratification, Gesamtschule just became a fourth type of secondary school. Since about 2000, several West German Länder simplified their school system to two or three tiers. Motives were: The example of Eastern Germany where in the 1990s, following reunification, a two-tier school system was established; mediocre scores in the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA), first published in 2001, prompted a nation-wide debate about the school system, and in particular about the social selectivity of early stratification;<ref>In PISA 2000, Germany was the country with the highest correlation between test score and social background index. In the following test periods, this result could not be replicated.</ref> having low standards of achievement, inner-city Hauptschulen were increasingly considered dysfunctional by some people; outside the metropoles, the population is shrinking, so that according to some people it becomes increasingly unpractical to maintain a three- or four-tier school system. A special system of apprenticeship called ''Duale Ausbildung'' ("dual education") allows pupils in [[vocational training]] to learn in a company as well as in a state-run vocational school.<ref name="ED"/> To enter a [[List of universities in Germany|university in Germany]], high school students are generally required to take the ''[[Abitur]]'' examination, which is similar to [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-levels in the UK]] and typically done at the age of 18 or 19. However, students possessing a diploma from a [[vocational school]] may also apply for [[matriculation]] in certain subjects.
