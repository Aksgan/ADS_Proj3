=== * It images [[muscle]], [[soft tissue]], and bone surfaces very well and is particularly useful for delineating the interfaces between solid and fluid-filled spaces. * It renders "live" images, where the operator can dynamically select the most useful section for diagnosing and documenting changes, often enabling rapid diagnoses. Live images also allow for ultrasound-guided biopsies or injections, which can be cumbersome with other imaging modalities. * It shows the structure of organs. * It has no known long-term side effects and rarely causes any discomfort to the patient. * Equipment is widely available and comparatively flexible. * Small, easily carried scanners are available; examinations can be performed at the bedside. * Relatively inexpensive compared to other modes of investigation, such as [[X-ray computed tomography|computed X-ray tomography]], [[Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry|DEXA]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging]]. * [[Image resolution#Spatial resolution|Spatial resolution]] is better in high frequency ultrasound transducers than it is in most other imaging modalities. * Through the use of an [[Ultrasound research interface]], an ultrasound device can offer a relatively inexpensive, real-time, and flexible method for capturing data required for special research purposes for tissue characterization and development of new image processing techniques === Weaknesses === * Sonographic devices have trouble penetrating [[bone]]. For example, sonography of the adult brain is very limited though improvements are being made in transcranial ultrasonography. * Sonography performs very poorly when there is a gas between the transducer and the organ of interest, due to the extreme differences in [[acoustic impedance]]. For example, overlying gas in the gastrointestinal tract often makes ultrasound scanning of the [[pancreas]] difficult, and lung imaging is not possible (apart from demarcating pleural effusions). * Even in the absence of bone or air, the depth penetration of ultrasound may be limited depending on the frequency of imaging. Consequently, there might be difficulties imaging structures deep in the body, especially in obese patients. *Body habitus has a large influence on image quality, image quality and accuracy of diagnosis is limited with obese patients, overlying subcutaneous fat attuates the sound beam and a lower frequency tranducer is required (with lower resolution) The method is operator-dependent. A high level of skill and experience is needed to acquire good-quality images and make accurate diagnoses. * There is no scout image as there is with CT and MRI. Once an image has been acquired there is no exact way to tell which part of the body was imaged. ==Risks and side-effects== Ultrasonography is generally considered a "safe" imaging modality.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Merritt | first=CR | title=Ultrasound safety: what are the issues? |journal=Radiology | volume=173 | issue=2 | pages=304–306 |date=1 November 1989| pmid=2678243 | url=http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/reprint/173/2/304 | accessdate=2008-01-22 }}</ref> However slight detrimental effects have been occasionally observed (see below). Diagnostic ultrasound studies of the foetus are generally considered to be safe during pregnancy. This diagnostic procedure should be performed only when there is a valid medical indication, and the lowest possible ultrasonic exposure setting should be used to gain the necessary diagnostic information under the "as low as reasonably achievable" or [[ALARA]] principle. World Health Organizations technical report series 875(1998).<ref>{{cite WHO|title=Training in Diagnostic Ultrasound: essentials, principles and standards|pages=2 | year=1998 | url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_875.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> supports that ultrasound is harmless: "Diagnostic ultrasound is recognized as a safe, effective, and highly flexible imaging modality capable of providing clinically relevant information about most parts of the body in a rapid and cost-effective fashion". Although there is no evidence ultrasound could be harmful for the foetus, US Food and Drug Administration views promotion, selling, or leasing of ultrasound equipment for making "keepsake foetal videos" to be an unapproved use of a medical device. ===Studies on the safety of ultrasound=== *A study at the [[Yale School of Medicine]] found a correlation between prolonged and frequent use of ultrasound and abnormal neuronal migration in mice.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Ang Jr. | first=ES | coauthors=Gluncic V, Duque A et al. | title=Prenatal exposure to ultrasound waves impacts neuronal migration in mice |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume=103 | issue=34 | pages=12903–10 |year=2006 | pmid=16901978 | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/103/34/12903 | accessdate=2008-01-22 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0605294103 | pmc=1538990 }}</ref> A meta-analysis of several ultrasonography studies found no statistically significant harmful effects from ultrasonography, but mentioned that there was a lack of data on long-term substantive outcomes such as neurodevelopment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bricker L, Garcia J, Henderson J, ''et al.'' |title=Ultrasound screening in pregnancy: a systematic review of the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and women's views |journal=Health technology assessment (Winchester, England) |volume=4 |issue=16 |pages=i-vi, 1–193 |year=2000 |pmid=11070816 |doi= |url=http://www.hta.ac.uk/execsumm/summ416.htm}}</ref> == Regulation == Diagnostic and therapeutic ultrasound equipment is regulated in the USA by the FDA, and worldwide by other national regulatory agencies. The FDA limits acoustic output using several metrics. Generally other regulatory agencies around the world accept the FDA-established guidelines. Currently New Mexico is the only state in the USA which regulates diagnostic medical sonographers. Certification examinations for sonographers are available in the US from three organizations: [http://www.ardms.org The American Registry of Diagnostic Medical Sonography],[http://www.cci-online.org Cardiovascular Credentialing International] and the [http://www.arrt.org American Registry of Radiological Technologists]. The primary regulated metrics are MI ([[Mechanical Index]]) a metric associated with the cavitation bio-effect, and TI (Thermal Index) a metric associated with the tissue heating bio-effect. The FDA requires that the machine not exceed limits that they have established. This requires self-regulation on the part of the manufacturer in terms of the calibration of the machine. The established limits are reasonably conservative so as to maintain diagnostic ultrasound as a safe imaging modality.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.centrus.com.br/DiplomaFMF/SeriesFMF/doppler/capitulos-html/chapter_02.htm |title=Safety of diagnostic ultrasound in fetal scanning |work= |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref> In India, lack of social security and consequent preference for a male child has popularized the use of ultrasound technology to identify and abort female foetuses.
