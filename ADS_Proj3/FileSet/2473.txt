It is also the title of a book by [[Lev Vygotsky|Lev Semenovich Vygotsky]].}} A variety of different authors, theories and fields purport influences between '''language and thought'''. Many point out the seemingly common-sense realization that upon introspection we seem to [[thinking in language|think]] in the [[language]] we [[spoken language|speak]]. A number of writers and theorists have extrapolated upon this idea. ==Scientific hypotheses== * The '''[[Linguistic relativity|Sapirâ€“Whorf hypothesis]]''' in [[linguistics]] states that the grammatical structure of a mother language influences the way adherents to it perceive the world. The hypothesis has been largely abandoned by linguists as it has found at best very limited experimental support, at least in its strong form. For instance, a study showing that speakers of languages lacking a [[subjunctive]] mood such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]] experience difficulty with hypothetical problems has been discredited. Another study did show that subjects in memory tests are more likely to remember a given color if their mother language includes a word for that color; however, these findings do not necessarily support this hypothesis specifically. * According to '''[[Cognitive therapy]]''', founded by [[Aaron T. Beck]], our emotions and behavior are caused by our internal dialogue. We can change ourselves by learning to challenge and refute our own thoughts, especially a number of specific mistaken thought patterns called "[[cognitive distortion]]s". Cognitive therapy has been found to be effective by [[empirical]] studies. * In '''[[behavioral economics]]''', according to experiments said to support the theoretical [[availability heuristic]], people believe more probable events that are more vividly described than those that are not. Simple experiments that asked people to imagine something led them to believe it to be more likely. The [[mere exposure effect]] may also be relevant to propagandistic repetition like the [[Big Lie]]. According to [[prospect theory]], people make different economic choices based on how the matter is [[framing|framed]]. ==Other schools of thought== * '''[[General Semantics]]''' is a school of thought founded by engineer [[Alfred Korzybski]] and later popularized by [[S.I. Hayakawa]] and others, which attempted to make language more precise and objective. It makes many basic observations of the [[English language]], particularly pointing out problems of abstraction and definition. * '''[[E-prime]]''' is a [[constructed language]] identical to the [[English language]] but lacking all forms of "[[copula (linguistics)|to be]]", like [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. Its proponents claim that [[dogma]]tic thinking seems to rely on "to be" language constructs, and so by removing it we may discourage dogmatism. * '''[[Neuro-linguistic programming]]''', founded by [[Richard Bandler]], claims that language "patterns" and other things can affect thought and behavior. It takes ideas from General Semantics and [[hypnosis]], especially that of the famous therapist [[Milton Erickson]]. Many do not consider it a credible study, and it has no empirical scientific support. * Advocates of '''[[non-sexist language]]''' including some [[feminism|feminists]] say that the English language perpetuates biases against women, such as using male-gendered terms such as "he" and "man" as generic. Many authors including those who write textbooks now conspicuously avoid that practice, in the case of the previous examples using words like "he or she" or "they" and "human race". [[Political correctness]] is similar, but it is a loose cultural [[meme]] and has never been formally codified. Both are considered widely controversial. ==See also== * [[Kant and the Platypus: Essays on Language and Cognition]] by Umberto Eco * [[Philosophy of Language]] * [[Origin of Language]] ==Other== * Various other schools of '''[[persuasion]]''' directly suggest using language in certain ways to change the minds of others, including [[oratory]], [[advertising]], [[debate]], [[sales]], and [[rhetoric]]. The ancient [[sophist]]s discussed and listed many [[figure of speech|figures of speech]] such as [[enthymeme]] and [[euphemism]]. The modern [[public relations]] term for adding persuasive elements to the interpretation of and commentary on news is called [[spin (public relations)|spin]].

The term Language Constructs is often used as a synonym for control structure, and should not be confused with a function. ==Examples of language constructs== In [[PHP]], for example, <code>print</code> is a language construct. According to [http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.print.php] <source lang="php"> <?php print 'Hello world'; ?> </source> is the same as: <source lang="php"> <?php print('Hello world'); ?> </source> {{DEFAULTSORT:Language Construct}} [[Category:Programming constructs]] {{Compu-lang-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>21138</id> <title>Language engineering</title> <text>'''Language engineering''' is the creation of [[natural language processing]] systems whose cost and outputs are measurable and predictable as well as establishment of language regulators, such as formal or informal agencies, committees, societies or academies as language regulators.
