it was at a great cost; about 1,000 British casualties from a garrison of about 6,000, as compared to 500 American casualties from a much larger force.<ref>Harvey. ''"A few bloody noses"'' (2002) pp. 208-210</ref><ref>Urban p.74</ref> The Second Continental Congress convened in 1775, after the war had started. The Congress created the [[Continental Army]] and extended the [[Olive Branch Petition]] to the crown as an attempt at reconciliation. King George III refused to receive it, issuing instead the [[Proclamation of Rebellion]], requiring action against the "traitors". In the winter of 1775, the Americans [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|invaded Canada]]. General [[Richard Montgomery]] captured [[Montreal]] but a joint [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|attack on Quebec]] with the help of [[Benedict Arnold]] failed. In March 1776, with George Washington as the commander of the new army, the Continental Army forced the British to [[Evacuation Day (Massachusetts)|evacuate Boston]]. The revolutionaries were now in full control of all 13 colonies and were ready to declare independence. While there still were many Loyalists, they were no longer in control anywhere by July 1776, and all of the Royal officials had fled.<ref>Miller (1948) p. 87</ref> ===Prisoners=== {{Main|Prisoners in the American Revolutionary War}} In August 1775, George III declared Americans in arms against royal authority to be traitors to the Crown. The British government at first started treating captured rebel combatants as common criminals and preparations were made to bring them to trial for treason. American Secretary [[Lord Germain]] and First Lord of the Admiralty [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]] were especially eager to do so, with a particular emphasis on those who had previously served in British units (and thereby sworn an oath of allegiance to the crown). Many of the prisoners taken by the British at Bunker Hill apparently expected to be hanged, but British authorities declined to take the next step: treason trials and executions. The dilemma was that tens of thousands of Loyalists were under American control and American retaliation would have been easy. The British built much of their strategy around using these Loyalists. After the surrender at Saratoga in October 1777, furthermore, there were thousands of British and Hessian soldiers in American hands. Therefore no Americans were put on trial for treason. The British maltreated the prisoners they held, resulting in more deaths to American sailors and soldiers than combat operations.<ref>Larry G.

Britain had a sophisticated financial system based on the wealth of thousands of landowners, who supported the government, together with banks and financiers in London The efficient British tax system collected about 12 percent of the GDP in taxes during the 1770s.<ref>John Brewer, ''The sinews of power: war, money, and the English state, 1688-1783'' (1990) p 91</ref> In sharp contrast, Congress and the American states had no end of difficulty financing the war.<ref>Curtis P. Nettels, ''The Emergence of a National Economy, 1775-1815'' (1962) pp 23-44</ref> In 1775 there was at most 12 million dollars in gold in the colonies, not nearly enough to cover current transactions, let alone on a major war. The British made the situation much worse by imposing a tight blockade on every American port, which cut off almost all imports and exports. One partial solution was to rely on volunteer support from militiamen, and donations from patriotic citizens. Another was to delay actual payments, pay soldiers and suppliers in depreciated currency, and promise it would be made good after the war. Indeed, in 1783 the soldiers and officers were given land grants to cover the wages they had earned but had not been paid during the war. Not until 1781, when [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] was named [[Superintendent of Finance of the United States]], did the national government have a strong leader in financial matters. Morris used a French loan in 1782 to set up the private Bank of North America to finance the war. Seeking greater efficiency, Morris reduced the civil list, saved money by using competitive bidding for contracts, tightened accounting procedures, and demanded the federal government's full share of money and supplies from the states.<ref>Charles Rappleye, ''Robert Morris: Financier of the American Revolution'' (2010) pp 225-52</ref> Congress used four main methods to cover the cost of the war, which cost about 66 million dollars in specie (gold and silver).<ref>Oliver Harry Chitwood, ''A History of Colonial America'' (1961) pp 586-589</ref> Congress made two issues of paper money, in 1775-1780, and in 1780-81. The first issue amounted to 242 million dollars. This paper money would supposedly be redeemed for state taxes, but the holders were eventually paid off in 1791 at the rate of one cent on the dollar. By 1780, the paper money was "not worth a Continental", as people said, and a second issue of new currency was attempted. The second issue quickly became nearly worthless—but it was redeemed by the new federal government in 1791 at 100 cents on the dollar. At the same time the states, especially Virginia and the Carolinas, issued over 200 million dollars of their own currency. In effect, the paper money was a hidden tax on the people, and indeed was the only method of taxation that was possible at the time. The skyrocketing inflation was a hardship on the few people who had fixed incomes—but 90 percent of the people were farmers, and were not directly affected by that inflation. Debtors benefited by paying off their debts with depreciated paper.<ref>Ralph
