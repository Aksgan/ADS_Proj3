This is a canonical example of the type, with the CPU and main control panel on the left, the Type 30 display in the center, and the Soroban typewriter console on the right.]] With the company established and a successful product on the market, DEC turned its attention to the computer market once again as part of its planned "Phase II".<ref name=proposal/> In August 1959, Ben Gurley started design of the company's first computer, the [[PDP-1]]. In keeping with Doriot's instructions, the name was an [[initialism]] for "[[Programmable Data Processor]]", leaving off the term "computer". As Gurley put it, "We aren't building computers, we're building 'Programmable Data Processors'." The prototype was first shown publicly at the Joint Computer Conference in Boston in December 1959.<ref>[http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/accession/102634161 Eastern Joint Computer Conference and Exhibition], official program of 1959 meeting in Boston</ref> The PDP-1 design was based on a number of System Building Blocks packaged into several 19-inch racks to form an [[18-bit]] word computer, supplied standard with 4 kWords of [[core memory]] and running at a basic speed of 100,000 operations per second. The racks were themselves packaged into a single large mainframe case, with a hexagonal control panel containing switches and lights mounted to lay at table-top height at one end of the mainframe. Above the control panel was the system's standard [[input/output]] solution, a [[punch tape]] reader and writer. Most systems were purchased with two [[peripherals]], the Type 30 [[vector graphics]] display, and a [[Soroban Engineering]] modified [[IBM Electric typewriter|IBM Model B Electric typewriter]] that was used as a [[printer]]. The Soroban system was notoriously unreliable, and often replaced with a modified [[Friden Flexowriter]], which also contained its own punch tape system. A variety of more-expensive add-ons followed, including [[magnetic tape]] systems, [[punched card]] readers and writers, and faster punch tape and printer systems. The first PDP-1 was delivered to [[Bolt, Beranek and Newman]] in November 1960,<ref>[http://vt100.net/timeline/1960.html "DIGITAL Computing Timeline, 1960"]</ref> and formally accepted the next April.<ref>''Computers and Automation'', April 1961, pg. 8B</ref> In 1962 DEC donated the prototype PDP-1 to MIT, where it was placed in the room next to the TX-0. In this setting the PDP-1 quickly replaced the TX-0 as the favourite machine among the budding [[hacker]] culture, and served as the platform for a wide variety of "firsts" in the computing world. Perhaps best known among these is the first computerized video game, ''[[Spacewar!]]'', but among the list are the first [[text editor]], [[word processor]], interactive [[debugger]], the first credible [[computer chess]] program, and some of the earliest computerized music.<ref>Judith Strebel and Rebekah Kim,[http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/FindingAids/102660913.PDP_1.pdf "Guide to the Collection of Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-1 Computer Materials"], Computer History Museum, 2006</ref> The PDP-1 sold in basic form for $120,000, or about $780,000 in 2005-era USD.<ref>[http://www.westegg.com/inflation/infl.cgi "Inflation Calculator, 1961–2005"]</ref> BBN's system was quickly followed by orders from [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|Lawrence Livermore]] and [[Atomic Energy of Canada]] (AECL), and eventually 53 PDP-1s were delivered until production ended in 1969.<ref name=present3/><ref>"History of Computing", Lexikon Services, ISBN 0944601782</ref> All of these machines were still being actively used in 1970, and several were eventually saved. MIT's example was donated to [[The Computer Museum, Boston]], and from there ended up at the [[Computer History Museum]] (CHM). A late version of ''Spacewar!'' on paper tape was still tucked into the case. PDP-1 #44 was found in a barn in [[Wichita, Kansas]] in 1988, apparently formerly owned by one of the many aviation companies in the area, and rescued for the Digital Historical Collection, also eventually ending up at the CHM.<ref>Thomas Bergin, [http://www.computinghistorymuseum.org/teaching/lectures/pptlectures/10-dec.ppt "Digital Equipment Corporation"], Computer History Museum</ref> AECLs was sent to [[Science North]], but was later scrapped. When DEC introduced the PDP-1, they also mentioned larger machines at 24, 30 and 36-bits, based on the same design.<ref>''Datamation'', Volume 5 Number 6 (November/December), pg. 24</ref> During construction of the prototype PDP-1, some design work was carried out on a 24-bit PDP-2, and the 36-bit PDP-3. Although the PDP-2 never proceeded beyond the initial design, the PDP-3 found some interest and was designed in full.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/29461 "Preliminary Specifications: Programmed Data Processor Model Three (PDP-3)"], DEC, October 1960</ref> Only one PDP-3 appears to have been built, in 1960, by the CIA's Scientific Engineering Institute (SEI) in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]]. According to the limited information available, they used it to process radar cross section data for the [[Lockheed A-12]] [[reconnaissance aircraft]]. [[Gordon Bell]] remembered that it was being used in [[Oregon]] some time later, but could not recall who was using it.<ref>Posting in [http://www.decconnection.org/announcements.htm "Announcements from The DEC Connection"], ''The DEC Connection'', 14 January 2007</ref> In November 1962 DEC introduced the $65,000 [[PDP-4]]. The PDP-4 was similar to the PDP-1 and used a similar instruction set, but used slower memory and different packaging to lower the price. Like the PDP-1, about 54 PDP-4's were eventually sold, most to a customer base similar to the original PDP-1.<ref>Gordon Bell, [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gbell/digital/timeline/1962-1.htm "DIGITAL Computing Timeline, 1962, PDP-4"]</ref> In 1964 DEC introduced its new [[Flip Chip (trademark)|Flip Chip]] module design, and used it to re-implement the PDP-4 as the [[PDP-7]]. The PDP-7 was introduced in December 1964, and about 120 were eventually produced.<ref>Gordon Bell, [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gbell/digital/timeline/1964-3.htm "DIGITAL Computing Timeline, 1964, PDP-7"]</ref> An upgrade to the Flip Chip led to the R series, which in turn led to the PDP-7A in 1965.<ref>Gordon Bell, [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gbell/digital/timeline/1964-3.htm "DIGITAL Computing Timeline, 1965, PDP-7A"]</ref> The PDP-7 is most famous as the original machine for the [[Unix]] operating system.<ref>Eric Steven Raymond, [http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch02s01.html "Origins and History of Unix, 1969–1995"], 19 September 2003</ref> A more dramatic upgrade to the PDP-1 series was introduced in August 1966, the [[PDP-9]].<ref>Gordon Bell, [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gbell/digital/timeline/1966-1.htm "DIGITAL Computing Timeline, 1965, PDP-9"]</ref> The PDP-9 was instruction compatible with the PDP-4 and −7, but ran about twice as fast as the −7 and was intended to be used in larger deployments. At only $19,900 in 1968,<ref>DEC Advertisement, ''Chemical and Engineering News'', Volume 46 (1968), pg. 85</ref> the PDP-9 was a big seller, eventually selling 445 machines, more than all of the earlier models combined.<ref name=miller452>Miller 1997,
