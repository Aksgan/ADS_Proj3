referred to as ''[[DOS]]''. The original was ''[[86-DOS]]'', which would later become [[Microsoft]] ''[[MS-DOS]]''. It was also licensed to IBM by Microsoft, and marketed by them as ''[[PC-DOS]]''. [[Digital Research]] produced a compatible variant known as ''[[DR-DOS]]'', which was eventually taken over (after a buyout of Digital Research) by [[Novell]], then by [[Caldera International]]. This became ''Novell DOS'', then the open source ''[[OpenDOS]]'', before being changed back to ''DR-DOS''. There is also a [[free and open source software|free and open source]] version named ''[[FreeDOS]]''.

Partitions are also termed "[[slice (disk)|slices]]" for operating systems based on [[BSD]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] or [[GNU Hurd]]. A [[partition editor]] software program can be used to create, resize, delete, and manipulate these partitions on the hard disk. == Benefits of multiple partitions == Creating more than one partition has the following advantages: * Separation of the [[operating system]] (OS) and program files from user files. This allows [[disk image|image]] [[backup]]s (or [[disk cloning|clones]]) to be made of only the operating system and installed software. * Having an area for operating system [[virtual memory]] [[paging|swapping/paging]]. * Keeping frequently used programs and data near each other. * Having cache and log files separate from other files. These can change size dynamically and rapidly, potentially making a file system full. * Use of [[multi-boot]] setups, which allow users to have more than one operating system on a single computer. For example, one could install [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Microsoft Windows]] or others on different partitions of the same hard disk and have a choice of booting into any compatible operating system at power-up. * Protecting or isolating files, to make it easier to recover a corrupted file system or operating system installation. If one partition is corrupted, none of the other file systems are affected, and the drive's data may still be salvageable. Having a separate partition for [[read-only]] data also reduces the chances of the file system on this partition becoming corrupted. * Raising overall computer performance on systems where smaller file systems are more efficient. For instance, large hard drives with only one [[NTFS]] file system typically have a very large [[sequential access|sequentially accessed]] [[Master File Table]] (MFT) and it generally takes more time to read this MFT than the smaller MFTs of smaller partitions. * "Short Stroking", which aims to minimize performance-eating head repositioning delays by reducing the number of tracks used per hard drive.<ref>[http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/short-stroking-hdd,2157.html Accelerate Your Hard Drive By Short Stroking]</ref> The basic idea is that you make one partition approx. 20-25% of the total size of the drive. This partition is expected to: occupy the outer tracks of the hard drive, and offer more than double the throughput â€” less than half the access time. If you limit capacity with short stroking, the minimum throughput stays much closer to the maximum. :* For example a 1 TB disk might have an access time of 12 ms at 200 [[IOPS]] (at a limited queue depth) with an average throughput of 100 MB/s. When it is partitioned to 100 GB (and the rest left unallocated) you '''''might''''' end up with an access time of 6 ms at 300 IOPS (with a bigger queue depth) with an average throughput of 200 MB/s.. == PC partition types == This section describes the [[Partition table (master boot record)|master boot record (MBR) partitioning scheme]], as used in [[DOS]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Linux]] on [[PC compatible]] computer systems. For examples of partitioning schemes used in other operating systems, see the general article on [[partition table|partition tables]]. The total data storage space of a PC hard disk can be divided into at most four ''primary partitions'', or alternatively three primary partitions and an ''[[#Extended partition|extended partition]]''. These partitions are described by 16-byte entries that constitute the ''Partition Table'', located in the master boot record. The ''partition type'' is identified by a 1-byte code found in its partition table entry. Some of these codes (such as <tt>0x05</tt> and <tt>0x0F</tt>) may be used to indicate the presence of an [[extended boot record|extended partition]]. Most are used by an operating system's bootloader (that examines partition tables) to decide if a partition contains a file system that can be used to ''mount / access'' for reading or writing data. Once a specific partition's ''type'' has been identified, additional information about its purpose and probable contents may be found (see: [[partition type|list of partition types]]). For example, some partition type ''codes'' are used to ''hide'' a partition's contents from various operating systems. However, if an OS or some partitioning tool has been programmed to also examine the boot sectors of any partition, then its file system may no longer remain hidden. (Note: There are no ''officially assigned'' partition types; thus, more than one kind of file system may ''lay claim'' to the same code value.) Additionally, partition types and boot indicators can be easily modified using applications such as [[MBRWizard]] if required. === Primary partition === A primary partition contains one file system. In [[DOS]] and earlier versions of [[Microsoft Windows]] systems, the system partition was required to be the first partition. Windows operating systems must be located in a primary partition. Other operating systems do not have this peculiar requirement. However, other factors, such as a PC's [[BIOS]] (see [[booting#Boot sequence on standard PC (IBM-PC compatible)|Boot sequence on standard PC]]) may also impart specific requirements as to which partition must contain the primary OS. The partition type ''code'' for a primary partition can either correspond to a file system contained within (e.g. <tt>0x07</tt> means either an [[NTFS]] or an OS/2 [[HPFS]] file system) or indicate that the partition has a special use (e.g.
