A and B are both legal, but AB or BA are illegal). If A and B are both initiated at roughly the same time within the database, then A may be successfully applied on some nodes and B on others, but as soon as A and B "meet" and one is attempted on a node which has already applied the other, a conflict will be found. The system must, in this case, decide which update finally "wins", and arrange for any nodes that have already applied the losing update to revert it. However, some nodes may temporarily expose the state with the reverted update, and there may be no way to inform the user who initiated the update of its failure, without requiring them to wait (potentially forever) for confirmation of acceptance at every node. ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Data synchronization]]</text> </page> <page> <id>27694</id> <title>Optimus Prime (Transformers)</title> <text>{{Prune|article|date=June 2009}} {{In-universe|date=October 2009}} {{Copy edit|date=November 2010}} {{Mergefrom|Optimus Prime (other incarnations)|date= October 2010}} {{Mergefrom|Optimus Prime (Unicron Trilogy)|date= October 2010}} {{Transformers character | name = Optimus Prime | japanname = Convoy | image = optimusprime-originaltoy.jpg | caption = Optimus Prime box art showing his original G1 toy design | affiliation = Autobot/Maximal | subgroup = Action Masters, Autorollers, Combat Heroes, Deluxe Vehicles, Go-Bots, Masterpiece, Primes, Powermasters, Voyagers | rank = 10 | function = Autobot Leader | partner = Roller, Hi-Q, [[Marissa Faireborn]], [[Ultra Magnus (Transformers)|Ultra Magnus]], [[Rodimus]], Barrelroller<!-- See Toys section -->, Red Alert, Mirage | motto = ''"Freedom is the right of all sentient beings."''

For other uses see [[Optimus Prime (disambiguation)]].'' '''Optimus Prime''' is a [[fictional character]] from the ''[[Transformers]]'' franchise. Prime is the leader of the [[Autobot]]s, a faction of heroic Transformers from the fictional planet [[Cybertron]] who wage their battles to destroy the evil forces of the [[Decepticon]]s. He is depicted as a heroic, brave, wise and compassionate character who puts all his talent to use to improve the universe around him. Optimus has a strong sense of justice and righteousness, and has dedicated himself to the protection of all life, particularly the inhabitants of Earth; he will battle his foes with unyielding resolve.<ref>{{cite news|title= Transformers: Prime on Prime |work= IGN|date=|url= http://uk.stars.ign.com/articles/827/827682p1.html|accessdate=2010-10-12}}</ref> The original Optimus Prime transforms into a [[cab over]] truck. The truck's cab transforms into the robot mode of Prime himself, with vast strength and armed with an ion blaster. Contained within his chest is the mystic talisman known as the [[Matrix of Leadership|Autobot Matrix of Leadership]] (or Creation Matrix, depending on the continuity), carried by all Autobot leaders and passed down through the ages.<ref>{{Cite book | title=Transformers: The Ultimate Guide | last=Furman | first=Simon | year=2004 | publisher=DK Publishing Inc.| ISBN=1405304618 | pages= 18–19}}</ref> The truck's trailer disconnects and transforms into the '''Combat Deck''', a mobile battle-station/command headquarters with an "Auto-Launcher" robot armed with assorted artillery and beam weapons. It can also serve as a radio antenna for battlefield communications between the Autobots. The Combat Deck can launch Prime's third component, '''Roller''', a mobile scout buggy that can easily slip behind enemy lines. Optimus' senses are tied into Roller's, and can perceive what Roller does.<ref>{{cite news|title= Transformers: The Many Looks of Optimus Prime |work= IGN|date=|url= http://uk.stars.ign.com/articles/996/996813p1.html|accessdate=2010-10-12}}</ref> Injury to one component is felt by each of the others, and while Prime could survive the destruction of either, despite the slight degree of autonomy they possess, the Combat Deck and Roller would not be able to survive without him. Additional powers included in the animated series and comics are short-range optic blasts, holographic map projections and deployable [[hydro-foil]]s designed by [[Wheeljack]] which allowed Prime and the other Autobots to traverse bodies of water with ease. One of Prime's abilities was the ability to retract his right hand unit and replace it with a glowing axe. Across the assorted continuities of the original ''Transformers'' universe, there have been various interpretations of Optimus Prime. One of Prime's most notable characteristics in any form was his adamant commitment to leadership by example, and avoidance of any hypocrisy in his command, but beyond this, the animated series leaned towards Optimus Prime as a straightforward, wise and essentially upbeat battlefield [[general]]. The [[Marvel Comics]] series, on the other hand, in addition to these more obvious characteristics, suggested a Prime secretly plagued by self-doubt and, more importantly, a conflicted sense of [[pacifism]] that often made him an extremely reluctant [[warrior]]. It was occasionally implied that the conflict with the Decepticons lasted as long as it did primarily because of his unwillingness to take a more aggressive stance. The animated series revealed other minor details about Optimus Prime's personality and personal life — for example, his dislike of [[rap music]] ("Blaster Blues" and "Quest for Survival"), which set him at odds with music-loving characters like [[Blaster (Transformers)|Blaster]] and [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]]. Prime also enjoys televised sports, most notably [[basketball]] which he even plays ("The Master Builder"), as well as setting up a basketball court outside the [[Ark (Transformers)|Ark]]. Though Prime's personality is like that of a human man age 40-50, he is not above watching afternoon [[soap opera]]s (in the episode "Prime Target", he is heard groaning out loud when the soap opera he is watching with the
