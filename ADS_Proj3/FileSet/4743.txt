However, WebCrow has not reached expert level in single-language crosswords, yet. ===ECAI-06 Competition=== On August 30, 2006, at the [[European Conference on Artificial Intelligence]] (ECAI2006), 25 conference attendees and 53 internet connected crosswords lovers, competed with WebCrow in an official challenge organized within the conference program. The challenge consisted in 5 different crosswords (2 in Italian, 2 in English and one multi-language in Italian and English) and 15 minutes were assigned for each crossword. WebCrow ranked 21 out of 74 participants in the Italian competition, and won both the bilingual and English competitions. ===Other Competitions=== Several competitions have been held in [[Florence]], Italy within the Creativity Festival in December 2006, and another official conference competition took place in [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]], India in January 2007, within the [[International Conference of Artificial Intelligence]], where it ranked second out of 25 participants. ==References== {{reflist|2}} ==External links== * [http://webcrow.dii.unisi.it The WebCrow Website] * [http://riskman.typepad.com/perilocity/2006/09/google_as_ai.html Google as AI] * [http://www.ddj.com/blog/portal/archives/2006/09/im_puzzled.html I’m puzzled, Dr. Dobbs portal] * [http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/92915/crosswordsolving-system-strikes-a-blow-for-ai.html Crossword-solving system strikes a blow for AI, by Simon Aughton] * [http://www.multilingualblog.com/index.php/crosswords_at_the_crossroads_with_il_computer_enigmista Crosswords at the crossroads with “il computer enigmista?”, Blogos - news and views on languages and technologies] * [http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/vp_strauss/20071017.html cbc.ca radio] * [http://www.cruciverb.com/index.php/articles/news/537 cruciverb.com] * [http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9888-crossword-software-thrashes-human-challengers.html Crossword Software Thrashes Human Challengers, The New Scientist ] [[Category:Artificial intelligence applications]]</text> </page> <page> <id>39923</id> <title>WebReference.com</title> <text>'''WebReference.com''' is a [[web site]] devoted to [[World Wide Web]] development.

A Web 2.0 site allows users to interact and collaborate with each other in a [[social media]] dialogue as consumers of [[user-generated content]] in a [[virtual community]], in contrast to websites where users ([[prosumer]]s) are limited to the active viewing of [[Content (media and publishing)|content]] that they created and controlled. Examples of Web 2.0 include [[social networking site]]s, [[blog]]s, [[wiki]]s, [[video sharing]] sites, [[Web service|hosted services]], [[web application]]s, [[mashup (web application hybrid)|mashups]] and [[folksonomies]]. The term is closely associated with [[Tim O'Reilly]] because of the [[O'Reilly Media]] Web 2.0 conference in 2004.<ref name="graham">{{cite web|url=http://www.paulgraham.com/web20.html |title=Web 2.0 |author=Paul Graham |authorlink=Paul Graham (computer programmer) |month=November |year=2005 |accessdate=2006-08-02 |quote=I first heard the phrase 'Web 2.0' in the name of the Web 2.0 conference in 2004.}}</ref><ref name="oreilly">{{cite web|url=http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html |title=What Is Web 2.0 |publisher=O'Reilly Network |author=Tim O'Reilly |authorlink=Tim O'Reilly |date=2005-09-30 |accessdate=2006-08-06}}</ref> Although the term suggests a new version of the [[World Wide Web]], it does not refer to an update to any technical specification, but rather to cumulative changes in the ways [[software developer]]s and [[end-user (computer science)|end-users]] use the Web. Whether Web 2.0 is qualitatively different from prior web technologies has been challenged by World Wide Web inventor [[Tim Berners-Lee]], who called the term a "piece of jargon",<ref name="developerWorks Interviews: Tim Berners-Lee"/> precisely because he intended the Web in his vision as "a collaborative medium, a place where we [could] all meet and read and write". He called it the "Read/Write Web".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4132752.stm BBC: Berners-Lee on the read/write web]</ref> ==History== The term "Web 2.0" was coined in 1999 by Darcy DiNucci, a consultant on electronic information design ([[information architecture]]).

The first glimmerings of Web 2.0 are beginning to appear, and we are just starting to see how that embryo might develop. The Web will be understood not as screenfulls of text and graphics but as a transport mechanism, the ether through which interactivity happens. It will [...] appear on your computer screen, [...] on your TV set [...] your car dashboard [...] your cell phone [...] hand-held game machines [...] maybe even your microwave oven. }} Her use of the term deals mainly with Web design, aesthetics, and the interconnection of everyday objects with the Internet; she argues that the Web is "fragmenting" due to the widespread use of portable Web-ready devices. Her article is aimed at designers, reminding them to code for an ever-increasing variety of hardware. As such, her use of the term hints at, but does not directly relate to, the current uses of the term. The term Web 2.0 did not resurface until 2003.<ref>Idehen, Kingsley. 2003.

It is a system that breaks with the old model of centralized Web sites and moves the power of the Web/Internet to the desktop."<ref name="jrobb.mindplex.org"/> In 2004, the term began its rise in popularity when O'Reilly Media and MediaLive hosted the first Web 2.0 conference. In their opening remarks, [[John Battelle]] and [[Tim O'Reilly]] outlined their definition of the "Web as Platform", where software applications are built upon the Web as opposed to upon the desktop. The unique aspect of this migration, they argued, is that "customers are building your business for you".<ref>O'Reilly, Tim, and John Battelle. 2004. Opening Welcome: State of the Internet Industry.
