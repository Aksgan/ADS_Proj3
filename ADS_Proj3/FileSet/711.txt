Available in fixed configurations supporting [[10baseT]], [[ISDN]] and [[serial]] interfaces. These routers are no longer supported and are replaced by the [[Cisco 800]] Series routers. ==Models== *1001 - 1 Ethernet ([[10baseT]]), 1 Serial (V.35) (Leased Line LAN Extender) *1002 - 1 Ethernet ([[10baseT]]), 1 Serial (X21) (Leased Line LAN Extender) *1003 - 1 Ethernet ([[10baseT]]), 1 [[Basic Rate Interface|BRI]] [[ISDN]] S/T Interface *1004 - 1 Ethernet ([[10baseT]]), 1 [[Basic Rate Interface|BRI]] [[ISDN]] Integrated NT1 *1005 - 1 Ethernet ([[10baseT]]), 1 Async#/Sync (network) Serial ([[DB60 connector|DB60]]) *1020 - 1 Ethernet ([[10baseT]]), 2 (Max) Async Serial (Dial on Demand Asyncronous Router) (#)Running serial port in Async mode requires an IOS image that supports it such as c1005-qy-mz.xxx.bin (IP/ASYNC) or c1005-nqy-mz.xxx.bin (IP/IPX/ASYNC) All models used a PCMCIA card for flash storage (typically 2 MB), and ran on 12VDC power provided by an external power supply. ==1001 / 1002== The LAN Extender connects to a central 'host' router. The host router provides routing services to the LAN Extender, and all configuration is done remotly from the central router. The host router is connected to the 1001 via a leased line connection (up to T1/E1). ==1020== Developed through an alliance with Livingston Enterprises. Features two WAN ports, one asynchronous port supports PCMCIA modems up to V.34 rates (28.8 Kbps) and an external modem can be connected to a second asynchronous/console port to achieve aggregate throughput of up to 57.6 kbit/s uncompressed.

The client makes remote resources of another network available in a secure way as if the user was connected directly to that "private" network. == Installation == The client is normally distributed with an executable installer and profile file(s), which contain all the necessary information to easily connect to a network. Cisco VPN Client Profile files have a [[#Security|security]] vulnerability which can potentially put the virtual private network at risk. == Availability == The software is not free but is often installed on university and business computers in accordance with a site-license.
