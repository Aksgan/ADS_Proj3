In [[Dirac notation]], the process of quantum cloning is described by: :<math>U |\psi\rangle_A |e\rangle_B = |\psi\rangle_A |\psi\rangle_B</math>, where <math>U</math> is the actual cloning operation, <math>|\psi\rangle_A</math> is the state to be cloned, and <math>|e\rangle_B</math> is the initial state of the copy. Quantum cloning is forbidden by the laws of [[quantum mechanics]] as shown by the [[no cloning theorem]], which proves that there is no <math>U</math> that can perform the cloning operation for any arbitrary state <math>|\psi\rangle_A</math>. Though perfect quantum cloning is not possible, it is possible to perform imperfect cloning, where the copies have a non-unit [[Fidelity of quantum states|fidelity]] with the state being cloned. The quantum cloning operation is the best way to make copies of quantum information therefore cloning is an important task in quantum information processing, especially in the context of quantum cryptography. Researchers are seeking ways to build quantum cloning machines, which work at the so called quantum limit. The first cloning machine relied on stimulated emission to copy quantum information encoded into single photons. Teleportation, nuclear magnetic resonance, quantum amplification and superior phase conjugation have been some other methods utilized to realize a quantum cloning machine. ==References== * V.

It studies [[complexity classes]] defined using [[quantum computers]] and [[quantum information]] which are [[computational model]]s based on [[quantum mechanics]]. It studies the hardness of problems in relation to these complexity classes, and the relationship between quantum complexity classes and classical (i.e., non-quantum) complexity classes. A complexity class is a collection of problems which can be solved by some computational model under resource constraints. For instance, the complexity class [[P_(complexity)|P]] is defined to be the set of problems solvable by a [[Turing machine]] in [[polynomial time]]. Similarly, one may define a quantum complexity class using a quantum model of computation, such as a standard [[quantum computer]] or a [[quantum Turing machine]]. Thus, the complexity class [[BQP]] is defined to be the set of problems solvable by a quantum computer in polynomial time with bounded error. Two important quantum complexity classes are [[BQP]] and [[QMA]] which are the bounded-error quantum analogues of [[P_(complexity)|P]] and [[NP_(complexity)|NP]]. One of the main aims of quantum complexity theory is to find out where these classes lie with respect to classical complexity classes such as P, NP, [[PP_(complexity)|PP]], [[PSPACE]] and [[List of complexity classes|other complexity classes]]. ==References== *{{cite arXiv|eprint=0804.3401v1|author1=John Watrous|authorlink=John Watrous (computer scientist)|title=Quantum Computational Complexity|class=quant-ph|year=2008}} {{comp-sci-theory-stub}} {{quantum_computing}} [[Category:Computational complexity theory]] [[Category:Quantum complexity theory| ]]</text> </page> <page> <id>30793</id> <title>Quantum computer</title> <text>[[Image:Bloch sphere.svg|thumb|The [[Bloch sphere]] is a representation of a [[qubit]], the fundamental building block of quantum computers.]] A '''quantum computer''' is a device for [[computation]] that makes direct use of [[quantum mechanical]] [[phenomena]], such as [[quantum superposition|superposition]] and [[quantum entanglement|entanglement]], to perform operations on [[data]]. Quantum computers are different from traditional computers based on [[transistor]]s. The basic principle behind quantum computation is that quantum properties can be used to represent data and perform [[Instruction (computer science)|operation]]s on these data.<ref>"[http://www.media.mit.edu/physics/publications/papers/98.06.sciam/0698gershenfeld.html Quantum Computing with Molecules]" article in [[Scientific American]] by [[Neil Gershenfeld]] and [[Isaac L.

Although quantum computing is still in its infancy, experiments have been carried out in which quantum computational operations were executed on a very small number of [[qubits]] (quantum bits). Both practical and theoretical research continues, and many national government and military funding agencies support quantum computing research to develop quantum [[computer]]s for both civilian and national security purposes, such as [[cryptanalysis]].<ref>[http://qist.lanl.gov/qcomp_map.shtml Quantum Information Science and Technology Roadmap] for a sense of where the research is heading.</ref> If large-scale quantum computers can be built, they will be able to solve certain problems much faster than any current classical computers (for example [[integer factorization]] using [[Shor's algorithm]]). All problems solvable with a quantum computer can also be solved using a traditional computer given enough time and resources.<ref>Nielsen, p. 202</ref> ==Basis== A classical computer has a memory made up of [[bit]]s, where each bit represents either a one or a zero. A quantum computer maintains a sequence of [[qubit]]s. A single qubit can represent a one, a zero, or, crucially, any [[quantum superposition]] of these; moreover, a pair of qubits can be in any quantum superposition of 4 states, and three qubits in any superposition of 8. In general a quantum computer with <math>n</math> qubits can be in an arbitrary superposition of up to <math>2^n</math> different states simultaneously (this compares to a normal computer that can only be in ''one'' of these <math>2^n</math> states at any one time).
