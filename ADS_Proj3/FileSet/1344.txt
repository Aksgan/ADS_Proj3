It is being developed by the Italian Endian Srl and the community. Endian is originally based on [[IPCop]], which itself was a [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of [[Smoothwall]]. Version 2.2 contains the following packages: * [[Firewall (computing)|Firewall]] (both directions) * [[Virtual Private Network]] (VPN) [[Gateway (computer networking)|Gateway]] with [[OpenVPN]] or [[IPsec]] * Web [[Computer virus|Antivirus]] * Web [[Spam (electronic)|Antispam]] * E-Mail Antivirus * E-Mail Antispam * Transparent HTTP-[[Proxy server|Proxy]] * Content Filter * [[Wireless Access Point|Hotspot/Wireless]] Security * [[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP]] [[VoIP]] Support * [[Network Address Translation]] * Multi IP address (aliases) * HTTPS web interface * Connection statistics * Log of networking traffic * Forwarding of logs to an external server * [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]]-Server * [[Network Time Protocol|NTP]]-Server * Intrusion Detection System * ADSL-Modem Support ==See also== * [[List of router or firewall distributions]] ==External links== * [http://www.endian.com/ Endian Url]{{Clarify|date=August 2010}} * [http://www.efw.it/ Company's website of the project] * [http://sourceforge.net/projects/efw/ Website of the project on SourceForge.net] {{GNU/Linux distributions}} {{Firewall software}} {{Use dmy dates|date=September 2010}} [[Category:Firewall software]] [[Category:Free routing software]] [[Category:Free security software]] [[Category:GNU/Linux security software]] [[Category:Gateway/routing/firewall distribution]] [[de:Endian Firewall]] [[it:Endian Firewall]] [[pt:Endian Firewall]]</text> </page> <page> <id>12131</id> <title>Endophora</title> <text>{{Unreferenced stub|auto=yes|date=December 2009}} In [[linguistics]], '''endophora''' is a term that means an expression which refers to something [[intralinguistic]], i.e. '''in the same text'''. For example, in the sentences "I saw Sally yesterday. She was lying on the beach", "she" is an ''endophoric'' expression because it refers to something already mentioned in the text, i.e. "Sally". By contrast, "She was lying on the beach," if it appeared by itself, has an ''exophoric'' expression; "she" refers to something that the reader is not told about. That is to say, there is not enough information in the text to independently determine to whom "she" refers. It can refer to someone the speaker assumes his audience has prior knowledge of or it can refer to a person he is showing to his listeners. Without further information, in other words, there is no way of knowing the exact meaning of an exophoric term. Endophora can be broken into three subcategories: [[cataphora]], [[anaphora (linguistics)|anaphora]] and [[self-reference]]. ==See also== *[[Deixis]] *[[Exophora]] *[[Generic antecedents]] *[[Homophora]] *[[Metaphor]] *[[Metonymy]] *[[Synecdoche]] [[Category:Semantics]] [[Category:Pragmatics]] {{Ling-stub}} [[br:Endoforiezh]] [[eo:Endoforo]] [[nl:Endofoor]]</text> </page> <page> <id>12135</id> <title>Energetic space</title> <text>In [[mathematics]], more precisely in [[functional analysis]], an '''energetic space''' is, intuitively, a subspace of a given [[real number|real]] [[Hilbert space]] equipped with a new "energetic" [[inner product]]. The motivation for the name comes from [[physics]], as in many physical problems the [[energy]] of a system can be expressed in terms of the energetic inner product. An example of this will be given later in the article. ==Energetic space== Formally, consider a real Hilbert space <math>X</math> with the [[inner product]] <math>(\cdot|\cdot)</math> and the [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] <math>\|\cdot\|</math>. Let <math>Y</math> be a linear subspace of <math>X</math> and <math>B:Y\to X</math> be a [[strongly monotone]] [[symmetric operator|symmetric]] [[linear operator]], that is, a linear operator satisfying * <math>(Bu|v)=(u|Bv)\, </math> for all <math>u, v</math> in <math>Y</math> * <math>(Bu|u) \ge c\|u\|^2</math> for some constant <math>c>0</math> and all <math>u</math> in <math>Y.</math> The '''energetic inner product''' is defined as :<math>(u|v)_E =(Bu|v)\,</math> for all <math>u,v</math> in <math>Y</math> and the '''energetic norm'''{{anchor|energetic norm}} is :<math>\|u\|_E=(u|u)^\frac{1}{2}_E \,</math> for all <math>u</math> in <math>Y.</math> The set <math>Y</math> together with the energetic inner product is a [[pre-Hilbert space]]. The '''energetic space''' <math>X_E</math> is defined as the [[complete metric space|completion]] of <math>Y</math> in the energetic norm. <math>X_E</math> can be considered a subset of the original Hilbert space <math>X,</math> since any [[Cauchy sequence]] in the energetic norm is also Cauchy in the norm of <math>X</math> (this follows from the strong monotonicity property of <math>B</math>). The energetic inner product is extended from <math>Y</math> to <math>X_E</math> by : <math> (u|v)_E = \lim_{n\to\infty} (u_n|v_n)_E</math> where <math>(u_n)</math> and <math>(v_n)</math> are sequences in ''Y'' that converge to points in <math>X_E</math> in the energetic norm. ==Energetic extension== The operator <math>B</math> admits an '''energetic extension''' <math>B_E</math> :<math>B_E:X_E\to X^*_E</math> defined on <math>X_E</math> with values in the [[dual space]] <math>X^*_E</math> that is given by the formula :<math>\langle B_E u | v \rangle_E = (u|v)_E</math> for all <math>u,v</math> in <math>X_E.</math> Here, <math>\langle \cdot |\cdot \rangle_E</math> denotes the duality bracket between <math>X^*_E</math> and <math>X_E,</math> so <math>\langle B_E u | v \rangle_E</math> actually denotes <math>(B_E u)(v).</math> If <math>u</math> and <math>v</math> are elements in the original subspace <math>Y,</math> then :<math>\langle B_E u | v \rangle_E = (u|v)_E = (Bu|v) = \langle u|B|v\rangle</math> by the definition of the energetic inner product. If one views <math>Bu,</math> which is an element in <math>X,</math> as an element in the dual <math>X*</math> via the [[Riesz representation theorem]], then <math>Bu</math> will also be in the dual <math>X_E^*</math> (by the strong monotonicity property of <math>B</math>). Via these identifications, it follows from the above formula that <math>B_E u= Bu.</math> In different words, the original operator <math>B:Y\to X</math> can be viewed as an operator <math>B:Y\to X_E^*,</math> and then <math>B_E:X_E\to X^*_E</math> is simply the function extension of <math>B</math> from <math>Y</math> to <math>X_E.</math> <!--- I commented out the below text, since it is not clear what norm one uses to talk about convergence and boundedness. I will think more about it. That is, <math>B_E</math> is that [[linear functional]] which acts like ''B'' but has a domain of <math>X_E</math>â€”that is, its domain includes all limit points, ''u'', of the domain of ''B'' for which ''Bu<sub>n</sub>'' is bounded as <math>u_n\to u</math>. ---> ==An example from physics== [[Image:String illust.png|right|thumb|A string with fixed endpoints under the influence of a force pointing down.]] Consider a
