It currently reaches more than 30,000 students annually. The American Foundation for Chess<ref>[http://www.af4c.org/] af4c.org</ref> has initiated programs in partnership with local school districts in several U.S. cities, including Seattle, San Diego, Philadelphia, and Tampa. The [[Chess'n Math Association]] promotes chess at the scholastic level in [[Canada]]. Chess for Success is a program for at-risk schools in Oregon.<ref>[http://www.chessforsuccess.org/ Chess for Success]</ref> Since 1991, the [[Chess Centres|U.S. Chess Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] teaches chess to children, especially those in the [[inner city]], "as a means of improving their academic and social skills." As early as 1750 [[Benjamin Franklin]], in his article ''The Morals of Chess'', has advocated such a view: <blockquote> "The Game of Chess is not merely an idle amusement; several very valuable qualities of the mind, useful in the course of human life, are to be acquired and strengthened by it, so as to become habits ready on all occasions; for life is a kind of Chess, in which we have often points to gain, and competitors or adversaries to contend with, and in which there is a vast variety of good and ill events, that are, in some degree, the effect of prudence, or the want of it. By playing at Chess then, we may learn: 1st, Foresight, which looks a little into futurity, and considers the consequences that may attend an action ... 2nd, Circumspection, which surveys the whole Chess-board, or scene of action: - the relation of the several Pieces, and their situations; ... 3rd, Caution, not to make our moves too hastily...." </blockquote> [[Alfred Binet]] demonstrated in the late 19th century that good [[chess players]] have superior [[memory]] and [[imagination]]. [[Adriaan de Groot]] concurred with Alfred Binet that visual memory and visual perception are important attributors and that problem-solving ability is of paramount importance. Thus, since 1972, at the collegiate level, the [[University of Texas at Dallas]] and the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County]] both recruit chessplayer-scholars and run scholastic outreach programs in their respective communities. There are a number of [[experiment]]s that suggest that learning and playing chess aids the [[mind]]. The [[Grandmaster Eugene Torre Chess Institute]] in the Philippines, the [[United States Chess Federation]]'s chess [[research]] [[bibliography]], and English educational consultant [[Tony Buzan]]'s Brain Foundation, among others, continuously collect such experimental results. The advent of chess software that automatically record and analyze the moves of each player in each game and can tirelessly play with human players of various levels, further helped in giving new directions to experimental designs on chess as mental training. == References == {{reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.chessville.com/misc/Quotes/misc_trivia_quotes_Franklin.htm] Benjamin Franklin: The Morals of Chess * [http://www.chessctr.org] U.S. Chess Center * [http://www.uschess.org/scholastic/sc-research.html] USCF Chess Research Bibliography * [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-171374104176431873 Chess and Alzheimer's disease] Good Morning America with David Shenk * [http://www.gusipeaceprize.com.ph/awarddtl.php?m=award&sk=2&y=2004&s=awardee&id=30] Grandmaster Eugene Torre. * [http://hamptonroads.com/node/229421] Hampton University Dean finds chess, business make a smart match [[Category:Chess and mathematics]] [[Category:Artificial intelligence]]</text> </page> <page> <id>6071</id> <title>Chi (Chobits)</title> <text><!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: Do not change "Chi" to "Chii"; the manga has precedence over the anime, and her name is spelled "Chi" in the manga --> {{Unreferenced|date=July 2009}} {{Infobox animanga character | name = Chi | series = Chobits | image = [[File:Chi from Chobits 8.jpg|230px]] | caption = Chi, as seen in the anime | first = Manga: Chobits Volume One<br />Anime: Chii Awakens | creator = [[Clamp (manga artists)|Clamp]] | voiced by = [[Rie Tanaka]] (Japan; Chobits)<br />[[Kaori Nazuka]] (Japan; Tsubasa)<br />[[Michelle Ruff]] (Dub; Chobits) }} {{nihongo|'''Chi'''|ちぃ|Chii}} is a fictional character in the manga series ''[[Chobits]]'', and its anime adaptation.

He takes her to his apartment and tries to figure out how to activate her. A typical persocom (abbreviated from "personal computer") has its power switch in or behind its ears, but Chi's is located in a very unorthodox place: her [[vagina]]. Realizing this, Hideki overcomes his moral objections and
