initiative and creative participation in life'.<ref>Kohut, p. 167</ref> ===Lowen=== [[Alexander Lowen]] identified narcissists as having a true and a false, or superficial, self. The false self rests on the surface, as the self presented to the world. It stands in contrast to the true self, which resides behind the facade or image. This true self is the feeling self, but it is a self that must be hidden and denied. Since the superficial self represents submission and conformity, the inner or true self is rebellious and angry. This underlying rebellion and anger can never be fully suppressed since it is an expression of the life force in that person. But because of the [[denial]], it cannot be expressed directly. Instead it shows up in the narcissist's [[acting out]]. And it can become a perverse force.<ref>Alexander Lowen ''Narcissism: Denial of the True Self'' (1984)</ref> ===Masterson=== [[James F. Masterson]] argued all the [[personality disorders]] crucially involve the conflict between a person’s two “selves”: the false self, which the very young child constructs to please the mother, and the true self. The psychotherapy of personality disorders, is an attempt is to put people back in touch with their real selves.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/obituaries/articles/2010/04/20/dr_james_masterson_expert_on_personality_disorders_at_84/ Dr. James Masterson, expert on personality disorders; at 84]</ref> ===Symington=== [[C. G. Jung|Jungians]] have explored how 'the narcissistic longings of mothers (or fathers) to amass reflected glory through their children' can result in a situation where 'in place of autonomy, the adult...would come to obey an internal source that the psychoanalyst Neville Symington calls the "discordant source"'.<ref>Polly Young-Eisandrath, ''Women and Desire'' (London 2000) p. 198 and p. 112</ref> Symington contrasted 'two poles: one in which I am the source of my own action, where I have a creative capacity that comes from my own source of action, and the other in which an inner figure opposed to myself is the source of action.<ref>Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 2003) p. 115</ref> He termed the twin 'sources of action the "autonomous source" and the "discordant source"', and acknowledged that 'although the formulation is different, it is along the lines of what Winnicott talks about - the true self and the false self'.<ref>Symington, p. 115 and p. 36</ref> His main criticism of Winnicott concerned the initial ''adoption'' or internalisation of the discordant source - wanting 'to stress that an intentional identification is what brings about the donning of the false self. Winnicott leaves out this intentional aspect in his description of its origins'.<ref>Symington, p. 104</ref> ===Vaknin=== As part of what has been described as 'a personal mission by self-confessed narcissist and author [[Sam Vaknin]] to raise the profile of the condition',<ref>Simon Crompton, ''All about Me: Loving a Narcissist'' (London 2007) p. 7</ref> Vaknin has highlighted the role of the false self in narcissism. 'The False Self replaces the narcissist's True Self and is intended to shield him from hurt and [[narcissistic injury]] by self-imputing omnipotence....The narcissist pretends that his False Self is real and demands that others affirm this confabulation',<ref>Vaknin S [http://samvak.tripod.com/faq48.html The Dual Role of the Narcissist's False Self]</ref> meanwhile keeping his real imperfect true self under wraps. For Vaknin, 'the False Self is by far more important to the narcissist than his dilapidated, dysfunctional True Self'; and in contrast to the psychoanalysts he 'do[es] not believe in the ability to "resuscitate it [TS]" through therapy'.<ref>Samuel Vaknin/Lidija Rangelovska ''Malignant Self-Love'' (2003) p. 187-8</ref> ==Persona and false self== Jungians have explored 'to what extent [[Jung]]'s concept of the [[Persona (psychology)|persona]] overlaps with Winnicott's concept of the False Self' - noting the way 'the antecedents of such persona-identification in the individual's life-history are usually quite similar to those of the False Self'.<ref>Mario Jacoby, ''Shame and the Origins of Self-Esteem'' (1996) p. 59-60</ref> However most would agree that it is only 'when the persona is excessively rigid or defensive...[that] the persona then develops into a pathological false self'.<ref>Polly Young-Eisendrath/James Albert Hall, ''Jung's Self Psychology'' (1991) p. 29</ref> ==Stern's tripartite self== In ''[[The Interpersonal World of the Infant]]'', [[Daniel Stern (psychologist)|Daniel Stern]] considered 'the sense of physical cohesion (..."going on being", in Winnicott's term)' as essential to what he called the Core Self - providing 'an affective core to the prerepresentational self'.<ref>Daniel Stern, ''The Interpersonal World of the Child'' (1985) p. 7 and p. 93</ref> He also explored how selective maternal attunement could create 'two versions of reality....Language becomes available to ratify the split and confer the privileged status of verbal representation upon the false self', so that 'the true self becomes a congloberate of disavowed experiences of self which cannot be linguistically coded'.<ref>Stern, p. 227</ref> However 'in place of true self and false self, Stern suggests the adoption of a tri-partite vocabulary: the social self, the private self and the disavoyed self'.<ref>Michael Jacobs, ''D. W. Winnicott'' (1995) p. 129</ref> ==Criticism== One persistent criticism of Winnicott's theory of true/false selves is that it was not theoretically integrated. 'Most clinicians...when they have a clinical insight, they simply paste it onto existing theory....Winnicott did the same with the true and false self: he did not ask himself how the theory fitted with [[Id, ego, and super-ego|ego and id]]'.<ref>Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 2003) p. 97</ref> Similarly [[Jean-Bertrand Pontalis]] and [[Maud Mannoni]] are very reserved about the theoretical implication of Winnicott's true/false self distinction, but they acknowledge the justice of his clinical observations. ==See also== * [[Alter ego]] * [[Narcissism]] * [[Psychology of self]] * [[Religious views on the self]] ==Further reading== * D.
