[[ITIL]] security management is based on the ISO 27001 standard. According to [http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=42103 ISO.ORG] "ISO/IEC 27001:2005 covers all types of organizations (e.g. commercial enterprises, government agencies, not-for profit organizations). ISO/IEC 27001:2005 specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining and improving a documented Information Security Management System within the context of the organization's overall business risks. It specifies requirements for the implementation of security controls customized to the needs of individual organizations or parts thereof. ISO/IEC 27001:2005 is designed to ensure the selection of adequate and proportionate security controls that protect information assets and give confidence to interested parties." A basic concept of security management is the [[information security]]. The primary goal of information security is to guarantee [[safety]] of [[information]]. When protecting information it is the value of the information that has to be protected. These values are stipulated by the [[confidentiality]], [[integrity]] and [[availability]]. Inferred aspects are privacy, anonymity and verifiability. The goal of the Security Management is split up in two parts: # The realization of the [[security]] requirements defined in the [[service level agreement]] (SLA) and other external requirements which are specified in underpinning contracts, legislation and possible internal or external imposed policies. # The realization of a basic level of security. This is necessary to guarantee the continuity of the management organization. This is also necessary in order to reach a simplified service-level management for the information security, as it happens to be easier to manage a limited number of SLAs as it is to manage a large number of SLAs. The input of the security management process is formed by the SLAs with the specified security requirements, legislation documents (if applicable) and other (external) underpinning contracts. These requirements can also act as [[key performance indicator]]s (KPIs) which can be used for the process management and for the justification of the results of the security management process. The [[output]] gives justification information to the realization of the SLAs and a report with deviations from the requirements. The security management process has relations with almost all other ITIL-processes. However, in this particular section the most obvious relations will be the relations to the [[service level management]] process, the [[incident management]] process and the [[Change Management]] process. == The security management process == The security management process consists of activities that are carried out by the security management itself or activities that are controlled by the security management. Because organizations and their information systems constantly change, the activities within the security management process must be revised continuously, in order to stay up-to-date and effective. Security management is a continuous process and it can be compared to the Quality Circle of Deming ([[PDCA|Plan, Do, Check, Act]]). The inputs are the requirements which are formed by the clients. The requirements are translated into security services, security quality that needs to be provided in the security section of the service level agreements. As you can see in the picture there are arrows going both ways; from the client to the SLA; from the SLA to the client and from the SLA to the plan sub-process; from the plan sub-process to the SLA. This means that both the client and the plan sub-process have inputs in the SLA and the SLA is an input for both the client and the process. The provider then develops the security plans for his/hers organization. These security plans contain the security policies and the operational level agreements. The security plans (Plan) are then implemented (Do) and the implementation is then evaluated (Check). After the evaluation then both the plans and the implementation of the plan are maintained (Act). The activities, results/products and the process are documented. External reports are written and sent to the clients. The clients are then able to adapt their requirements based on the information received through the reports. Furthermore, the service provider can adjust their plan or the implementation based on their findings in order to satisfy all the requirements stated in the SLA (including new requirements). ===Control=== The first activity in the security management process is the “Control” sub-process. The Control sub-process organizes and manages the security management process itself. The Control sub-process defines the processes, the allocation of responsibility the policy statements and the management framework. The security management framework defines the sub-processes for: the development of security plans, the implementation of the security plans, the evaluation and how the results of the evaluations are translated into action plans. Furthermore, the management framework defines how should be reported to clients. The activities that take place in the Control process are summed up in the following table, which contains the name of the (sub) activity and a short definition of the activity. {| class="wikitable" |- ! Activities !! Sub-Activities !! Descriptions |- | rowspan=3 | Control | Implement policies | This process outlines the specific requirements and rules that have to be met in order to implement security management. The process ends with ''policy statement''. |- | Setup the security organization | This process sets up the organizations for [[information security]]. For example in this process the structure the responsibilities are set up. This process ends with ''security management framework''. |- | Reporting | In this process the whole targeting process is documented in a specific way. This process ends with ''reports''. |} The [[meta-modeling]] technique was used in order to model the activities of the control sub-process. The following figure is the meta-process model of the control sub-process. It is based on a UML activity diagram and it gives an overview of the activities of the
