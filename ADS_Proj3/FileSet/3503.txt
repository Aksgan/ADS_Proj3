record “the shape and movement of your hand and fingers and the strength of the movements.” (Haag, 2006, p. 365) A headset records your head’s movement and “contains a screen that covers your entire field of vision and displays various views of an environment on the basis of your movements.” (Haag, 2006, p. 365) A walker “records the movement of your feet as you walk or turn in different directions.” (Haag, 2006, p. 365) Virtual reality is applied everywhere and can be seen in the entertainment industry, for example, including virtual reality games. ==Automatic virtual environments== Another part of emo Physiological Interaction innovations are [[CAVEs]] which stands for automatic virtual environments. The CAVE was first thought of by Thomas DeFanti and Dan Sandin and was later developed at the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois in Chicago by Carolina Cruz-Neira . (The CAVE at NCSA 2004) It is similar to virtual reality except you do not need any gear on your body in order to see the images. (Haag, 2006) In these virtual environments you are able to see 3d images of other people or things that are also using a CAVE in another location anywhere in the world. The purpose is to make people feel at if they were in the same location as the people or things they are interacting with. In order for the CAVE to work it must present many of the same que’s your brain uses to interact and understand the world around you. There are four different systems that must be implement into the CAVE in order for it to work properly. The first being Computers that are needed to coordinated all of the other equipment. Another component are graphic systems, which are very important. Every second there are ninety-six different images are displayed each of the CAVE's four walls. This produces very high resolution. In order to make the CAVE seem real sound need to be taken into consideration sounds system, and the last system that is needed for the CAVE to work is a tracking system, which is used to track the position and orientation of objects in the CAVE. (Haag, 2006), (The CAVE at NCSA 2004) ==Biometrics== [[Biometrics]] is the use of data gathered through physiological interactions with sensors to authenticate human beings. Examples of biometric modalities include fingerprints, iris scans, [[facial recognition system]]s, and DNA analysis. Networking multiple biometric modalities over several geographical locations ( as in the emerging technologies of [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Telebiometrics telebiometrics]) greatly increases the reliability and security of biometric data by providing redundancy and provenance for biometric data. Future uses of biometrics based on physiological interactions could include transaction authentication, medical record management, customer information, and global security. A properly designed and encrypted telebiometric system could include much more robust fraud and identity theft protection than current practices. With our bodies and habits as the ultimate authentication of our identity, the full array of biometrics would be difficult to steal or replicate because everyone has unique biometrics. (Haag, 2006) The next step for businesses gathering information about their customers is going to include the tracking of biometrics. BPS or biometric processing systems are going to record and process physiological characteristics, with even more information about customers; companies will really be able to target the market. There will be problems with customer protection and privacy. Many customers already feel business know too much about them and would feel uncomfortable with the idea of businesses having access to extremely personal information. (Haag, 2006) There are several different technologies that have evolved because of biometrics. To name a few there are Bio chips and implant chips. Biochips are designed to perform physiological functions that help your body when they are inserted for example reduce pain for those that suffer from injuries. Another technology that has come out of biometrics is implant chips. When they are inserted into your body they store information about you or your body, so if you were ever in trouble the chip can be scanned and all the important information about you will be right there.

The aim of the <math>\pi</math>-calculus is to be able to describe concurrent computations whose configuration may change during the computation. == Informal definition == The <math>\pi</math>-calculus belongs to the family of [[process calculi]], mathematical formalisms for describing and analyzing properties of concurrent computation. In fact, the <math>\pi</math>-calculus, like the [[lambda calculus|λ-calculus]], is so minimal that it does not contain primitives such as numbers, booleans, data structures, variables, functions, or even the usual flow control statements (such as <code>if-then-else</code>, <code>while</code>). ===Process constructs=== Central to the <math>\pi</math>-calculus is the notion of ''name''. The simplicity of the calculus lies in the dual role that names play as ''communication channels'' and ''variables''. The process constructs available in the calculus are the following (a precise definition is given in the following section): * ''concurrency'', written <math>P \mid Q</math>, where <math>P</math> and <math>Q</math> are two processes or threads executed concurrently. * ''communication'', where ** ''input prefixing'' <math>c\left(x\right).P</math> is a process waiting for a message that was sent on a communication channel named <math>c</math> before proceeding as {{nowrap|<math>P</math>,}} binding the name received to the name {{nowrap|<math>x</math>.}} Typically, this models either a process expecting a communication from the network or a label <code>c</code> usable only once by
