binary 41c8 0000<sub>16</sub> = 0100 0001 1100 1000 0000 0000 0000 0000<sub>2</sub> then we break it down into three parts; sign bit, exponent and significand. Sign bit: 0 Exponent: 1000 0011<sub>2</sub> = 83<sub>16</sub> = 131 Significand: 100 1000 0000 0000 0000 0000<sub>2</sub> = 480000<sub>16</sub> We then add the implicit 24th bit to the significand Significand: '''1'''100 1000 0000 0000 0000 0000<sub>2</sub> = C80000<sub>16</sub> and decode the exponent value by subtracting 127 Raw exponent: 83<sub>16</sub> = 131 Decoded exponent: 131 - 127 = '''4''' Each of the 24 bits of the significand, bit 23 to bit 0, represents a value, starting at 1 and halves for each bit, as follows bit 23 = 1 bit 22 = 0.5 bit 21 = 0.25 bit 20 = 0.125 bit 19 = 0.0625 . . bit 0 = 0.00000011920928955078125 The significand in this example has three bits set, bit 23, bit 22 and bit 19. We can now decode the significand by adding the values represented by these bits. Decoded significand: 1 + 0.5 + 0.0625 = 1.5625 = C80000/2<sup>23</sup> Then we need to multiply with the base, 2, to the power of the exponent to get the final result 1.5625 × 2<sup>4</sup> = '''25''' Thus 41c8 0000 = 25 This is equivalent to: <math>n = (-1)^s \times (m2^{-23})\times 2^{x - 127}</math> where <math>s</math> is the sign bit, <math>x</math> is the exponent, and <math>m</math> is the significand in base 10. == See also == * [[IEEE 754-2008|IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic (IEEE 754)]] * [[ISO/IEC 10967]], Language Independent Arithmetic * [[Primitive data type]] * [[Numerical stability]] * [[Double precision floating-point format]] ==External links== * [http://www.h-schmidt.net/FloatApplet/IEEE754.html Online calculator] * [http://www.binaryconvert.com/convert_float.html Online converter for IEEE 754 numbers with single precision] * [http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23173 C source code to convert between IEEE double, single, and half precision can be found here] ==References== <references/> [[Category:Computer arithmetic]] [[Category:Data types]] [[ca:Precisió simple]] [[de:Einfache Genauigkeit]] [[ja:単精度]] [[ru:Число одинарной точности]] [[sr:Једнострука тачност]]</text> </page> <page> <id>34546</id> <title>Singular value decomposition</title> <text>[[File:Singular value decomposition.gif|thumb|right|280px|Visualisation of a singular value decomposition of a 2-dimensional, real [[:en:Shear mapping|shearing]] ''M''. First, we see the unit disc in blue together with the two canonical unit vectors. We then see the action of ''M'' on the unit disc: it distorts the circle to an ellipse. The SVD decomposes ''M'' into three simple transformations: a rotation ''V''<sup>*</sup>, a scaling &Sigma; along the coordinate axes and a second rotation ''U''. The SVD reveals the rotation of the ellipse with respect to the coordinate axes and the lengths &sigma;<sub>1</sub> resp. &sigma;<sub>2</sub> of the [[semi-major axis]] resp. [[semi-minor axis]] of the ellipse; they are just the singular values which occur as diagonal elements of the scaling &Sigma;.]] In [[linear algebra]], the '''singular value decomposition''' ('''SVD''') is an important [[Matrix decomposition|factorization]] of a rectangular [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], with many applications in [[signal processing]] and [[statistics]]. Applications which employ the SVD include computing the [[Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse|pseudoinverse]], [[least squares]] fitting of data, matrix approximation, and determining the [[rank of a matrix|rank]], [[range of a matrix|range]] and [[kernel (matrix)|null space]] of a matrix. == Statement of the theorem == Suppose ''M'' is an ''m×n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] whose entries come from the [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'', which is either the field of [[real number]]s or the field of [[complex number]]s. Then there exists a factorization of the form : <math>M = U\Sigma V^*, \,</math> where ''U'' is an ''m×m'' [[unitary matrix]] over ''K'', the matrix Σ is an ''m×n'' [[diagonal matrix]] with nonnegative real numbers on the diagonal, and ''V*'', an ''n×n'' unitary matrix over ''K'', denotes the [[conjugate transpose]] of ''V''. Such a factorization is called the '''singular value decomposition''' of ''M''. The diagonal entries Σ<sub>''i'',''i''</sub> of Σ are known as the '''[[singular value]]s''' of ''M''. A common convention is to order the singular values in descending order. In this case, the diagonal matrix Σ is uniquely determined by ''M'' (though the matrices ''U'' and ''V'' are not). ===Intuitive explanation=== In the singular value decomposition of matrix ''M'' : <math>M = U\Sigma V^*, \,</math> * The columns of ''V'' form a set of [[Orthonormality|orthonormal]] "input" or "analysing" [[basis vector]] directions for ''M''. These are the [[eigenvectors]] of ''M<sup>*</sup>M''. * The columns of ''U'' form a set of [[Orthonormality|orthonormal]] "output" [[basis vector]] directions for ''M''. These are the [[eigenvectors]] of ''MM<sup>*</sup>''. * The diagonal values in matrix Σ are the [[singular value]]s, which can be thought of as scalar "gain controls" by which each corresponding input is multiplied to give a corresponding output. These are the square roots of the [[eigenvectors|eigenvalues]] of ''MM<sup>*</sup>'' and ''M<sup>*</sup>M'' that correspond with the same columns in ''U'' and ''V''. == Example == Consider the matrix :<math>M = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2\\ 0 & 0 & 3 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 4 & 0 & 0 & 0\end{bmatrix} </math> A singular value decomposition of this matrix is given by <math>U \Sigma V^*</math> :<math> U = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -1\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\end{bmatrix} , \Sigma = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 3 & 0 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & \sqrt{5} & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\end{bmatrix} , V^* = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\ \sqrt{0.2} & 0 & 0 & 0 & \sqrt{0.8}\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\ -\sqrt{0.8} & 0 & 0 & 0 & \sqrt{0.2}\end{bmatrix} </math> Notice <math>\Sigma</math> contains only zeros off the diagonal. Furthermore, because the matrices <math>U</math> and <math>V^*</math> are [[unitary matrix|unitary]], multiplying by their respective conjugate transposes yield [[identity matrix|identity matrices]], as shown below. In this case, because <math>U</math> and <math>V^*</math> are real valued, they each are an [[orthogonal matrix]]. :<math> \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 &
