(SIMD) pipeline containing three [[floating-point]] cores, each containing an [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU), a multiplier and a 32-bit by 32-entry [[register file]] with two read and two write ports. These cores are provided with a 32-bit by 2,560-entry memory that holds elements of OpenGL [[State (computing)|state]] and provides [[Scratchpad RAM|scratchpad]] storage. Each core also has a '''float-to-fix converter''' to convert floating-point values into [[integer]] form. The Geometry Engine is capable of completing three instructions per cycle, and each Geometry board, with four such devices, can complete 12 instructions per cycle. The Geometry Engine uses a 195-bit microinstruction, which is compressed in order to reduce size and banwidth usage in return for slightly less performance. The Geometry Engine processor operates at 90 MHz, achieving a maximum theoretical performance of 540 MFLOPS.<ref name="HC"/> As there are four such processors on a GE12-4 or GE14-4 board, the maximum theoretical performance is 2.16 GFLOPS. A 16-pipeline system therefore achieves a maximum theoretical performance of 34.56 GFLOPS. The fourth stage is the '''Geometry-Raster FIFO''', a [[FIFO|first in first out]] (FIFO) [[Data buffer|buffer]] that merges the outputs of the four Geometry Engines into one, reassembling the outputs in the order they were issued. The FIFO is built from SDRAM and has a capacity of 4 MB,<ref>Mark J. Kilgard. "Realizing OpenGL: Two Implementations of One Architecture". 1997 SIGGRAPH Eurographics Workshop, August 1997.</reF> large enough to store 65,536 [[Vertex (geometry)|vertexes]]. The transformed vertexes are moved from this FIFO to the Raster Manager boards for triangle reassembly and setup by the Triangle Bus (also known as the Vertex Bus), which has a bandwidth of 400 MB/s. === Raster Memory board === The function of the Raster Memory board is to perform [[rasterization]]. It also contains the [[texture memory]] and [[framebuffer|raster memory]], which is more commonly known as the [[framebuffer]]. Rasterization is performed in the '''[[Fragment (computer graphics)|Fragment Generator]]''' and the eighty '''Image Engines'''. The Fragment Generator comprises four ASIC designs: the '''Scan Converter''' (SC) ASIC, the '''Texel Address Calculator''' (TA) ASIC, the '''Texture Memory Controller''' (TM) ASIC and the '''Texture Fragment''' (TF) ASIC.<ref name="Paper"/> The SC ASIC and the TA ASIC perform scan conversion, color and depth interpolation, perspective correct texture coordinate interpolation and level of detail computation on incoming data, and the results are passed to the eight TM ASICs, which are specialized [[memory controller]]s optimized for texel access. Each TM ASIC controls four SDRAMs that make up one-eighth of the texture memory. The SDRAMs used are 16 bits wide and have separate address and data buses. SDRAMs with a capacity of 4 Mb are used by Raster Manager boards with 16 MB of texture memory while 16 Mb SDRAMs are used by Raster Manager boards with 64 MB of texture memory.<ref name="HC"/> The TM ASICs perform texel lookups in its SDRAMs according to the texel addresses issued by the TA ASIC. Texels from the TM ASICs are forwarded to the appropriate TF ASIC, where texture filtering, texture environment combination with interpolated color and fog application is performed. As each SDRAM holds part of the texture memory, all of the 32 SDRAMs must be connected to all of the 80 Image Engines. To achieve this, the TM and TF ASICs implement a two-rank [[omega network]], which reduces the number of individual paths required for the 32 to 80 sort while maintaining the same functionality. The eighty Image Engines have multiple functions. Firstly, each Image Engine controls a portion of the raster memory, which in the case of the InfiniteReality, is a 1 MB SGRAM organized as 262,144 by 32-bit words.<ref name="Paper"/><ref name="HC"/> Secondly, the following OpenGL per-fragment operations are performed by the Image Engines: pixel ownership test, stencil test, depth buffer test, blending, dithering and logical operation. Lastly, the Image Engines perform anti-aliasing and [[accumulation buffer]] operations. To deliver pixel data for display, each Image Engine has a 2-bit serial bus to the Display Generator board. If one Raster Manager board is present in the pipeline, the Image Engine uses the entire width of the bus, whereas if two or more Raster Manager boards are present, the Image Engine uses half the bus.<ref name="Paper"/> Each serial bus is actually a part of the Video Bus, which has a bandwidth of 1.2 GB/s. Four Image Engine "cores" are contained on an Image Engine ASIC, which contains nearly 488,000 logic gates, comprising 1.95 million transistors, on a 42 mm<sup>2</sup> (6.5 by 6.5 mm) die that was fabricated in a 0.35 micrometre process by [[VLSI Technology]]. The InfiniteReality uses the '''RM6-16''' or '''RM6-64''' Raster Managers. Each pipeline is capable of display resolutions of 2.62, 5.24 or 10.48 million pixels, provided that one, two or four Raster Manager boards respectively are present.<ref name="Report">Onyx2 Reality, Onyx2 InfiniteReality and Onyx2 InfiniteReality2 Technical Report, August 1998. Silicon Graphics, Inc.</ref> The raster memory can be configured to use 256, 512 or 1024 bits per pixel. 320 MB supports a resolution of 2560 by 2048 pixels with each pixel containing 512 bits of information.<ref name="HC"/> In a configuration with four Raster Managers, the texture memory has a bandwidth of 15.36 GB/s, and the raster memory has a bandwidth of 72.8 GB/s. === Display Generator board === The '''DG4-2''' Display Generator board contains hardware to drive up to two video outputs, which may be expanded to eight video outputs with an optional daughterboard, a configuration known as the '''DG4-8'''. The outputs are independent and each output has hardware for generating video timing, video resizing, [[gamma correction]] and [[digital-to-analog]] conversion. Digital-to-analog conversion is provided by 8-bit digital-to-analog converters that support a pixel clock frequency up to 220 MHz. Data for the video outputs are provided by four ASICs that de-serialize and de-interleave the 160-bit streams into 10-bit component [[RGBA]], 12-bit component RBGA, L16, Stereo Field Sequential (FS) or color indexes. The hardware also incorporates the [[cursor]] at this stage. A 32,768 [[color index|color index map]] entries are available. === Capabilities and performance === The InfiniteReality was capable of several advanced capabilities: * 8 by 8 multi-sampled anti-aliasing<ref name="PG">Remanufactured Silicon
