DOI: 10.1002/ejsp.674</ref> ==Habits and goals== The habit–goal interface is constrained by the particular manner in which habits are learned and represented in memory. Specifically, the associative learning underlying habits is characterized by the slow, incremental accrual of information over time in procedural memory.<ref name="apa">American Psychological Association. [http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/rev-1144843.pdf A New Look at Habits and the Habit–Goal Interface] Retrieved on December 22, 2008</ref> Habits can either benefit or hurt the goals a person sets for themselves. Goals guide habits most fundamentally by providing the initial outcome-oriented impetus for response repetition. In this sense, habits often are a vestige of past goal pursuit.<ref name="apa"/> ==Bad habits== A bad habit is a negative behavior pattern. Common examples include: [[procrastination]], [[fidgeting]], [[overspending]], [[nail-biting]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Breaking Bad Habits |author=Suzanne LeVert, Gary R.

HackThisSite involves a small, loose team of developers and moderators who maintain its website, IRC server, and related projects. It produces an [[Online magazine|e-zine]] which it releases at various [[Computer security conference|hacker conventions]] and through its hackbloc portal. Hard copies of the zine are published by [[Microcosm Ltd|Microcosm]] and [[Quimbys]]. It also has a short news/blog section run by [[software developer|developers]]. ==IRC and forums== HackThisSite is known for its [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] network, where many of its active users congregate. Within this network, users converse on a plethora of topics ranging from current day politics to technical issues with programming and [[Unix]]-based operating systems. Mostly, the HackThisSite IRC network serves as a social gathering of like-minded people to discuss anything. Although there are many channels on the IRC network, the main channel, #hackthissite, has a +R flag which requires users to register their nick before they may join the channel. This requirement helps reduce botnets in the main channel, because they would have to register every nick. HackThisSite currently has one main set of [[Internet forum|forums]], because of the recent split from its former sister
