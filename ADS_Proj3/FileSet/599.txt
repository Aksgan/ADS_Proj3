Most schools that offer training for cardiac sonographers have several different programs available to students. Programs that are certificate-based can be completed in about twelve (12) months allowing the candidate to make a relatively quick entrance into their chosen career. However, some students may choose to pursue a full four-year degree in order to allow them to work at more advanced levels but most commonly, the course of study for those pursuing the cardiac sonographer profession is the two-year associate's degree. Typically, an associate's degree satisfies the minimum educational requirement for most employers. == External links == [http://www.asecho.org The American Society of Echocardiography] * [http://www.cci-online.org Cardiovascular Credentialing International] * [http://ardms.org American Registry for Diagnostic Medical Sonography] * [http://myhealthdegree.com/cardiac_sonographer_schools.html Cardiac Sonographer Schools] * [http://www.prolibraries.com/ase/ Educational Sessions from The American Society of Echocardiography Conferences] [[Category:Cardiology]] [[Category:Radiology]] [[Category:Medical imaging]] [[Category:Medical ultrasound]] {{Job-stub}} [[no:Ekkotekniker]] [[nn:Ekkoteknikar]]</text> </page> <page> <id>5498</id> <title>Cardinality (data modeling)</title> <text>In [[data modeling]], the '''cardinality''' of one data table with respect to another data table is a critical aspect of [[database]] design. Relationships between data tables define cardinality when explaining how each table links to another. In the relational model, tables can be related as any of: '''many-to-many''', '''many-to-one''' (rev. '''one-to-many'''), or '''one-to-one'''. This is said to be the '''cardinality''' of a given table in relation to another. For example, considering a database designed to keep track of hospital records. Such a database could have many tables like: * a ''Doctor'' table full of doctor information * a ''Patient'' table with patient information * and a ''Department'' table with an entry for each department of the hospital. In that model: * There is a '''many-to-many''' relationship between the records in the doctor table and records in the patient table (Doctors have many patients, and a patient could have several doctors); * a '''one-to-many''' relation between the department table and the doctor table (each doctor works for one department, but one department could have many doctors). '''one-to-one''' relationship is mostly used to split a table in two in order to optimize access or limit the visibility of some information. In the hospital example, such a relationship could be used to keep apart doctor's personal or administrative information. A [[Entity-relationship_diagram#Crow.27s_Foot|crow's foot]] shows a '''one-to-many''' relationship, single line is a one-to-one relationship. == UML Modeling == '''UML class diagram''' may be used for data modeling. In that case, relationship are modeled using UML associations, and multiplicity is used on those associations to denote '''cardinality'''. Here are some examples: {| class="wikitable" || left || right || || example |- || '''1''' || '''1''' || one-to-one || person <-> weight |- || '''0..1''' || '''1''' || ''optional on one side'' one-to-one || date of death <-> person |- || '''0..*''' or '''*''' || '''0..*''' or '''*''' || ''optional on both sides'' many-to-many || person <-> book |- || '''1''' || '''1..*''' || one-to-many || person <-> language |} ==External links== *[http://www.agiledata.org/essays/umlDataModelingProfile.html#Relationships UML multiplicity as data model cardinality] - http://www.agiledata.org {{DEFAULTSORT:Cardinality (Data Modeling)}} [[Category:Data modeling]] [[Category:Relational model]] {{database-stub}} [[de:Kardinalität (Datenbanken)]] [[fr:Cardinalité (programmation)]] [[zh:基数 (数据建模)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>5500</id> <title>Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe</title> <text>The '''Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE)''' is a professional body comprising [[interventional radiology|interventional radiologists]] from Europe and overseas. The society has its headquarters in Vienna, Austria and was founded in 1985. It currently has approximately 4,200 members from around the world, including 24 national societies. CIRSE's objective is to provide [[continuing education]] to physicians and scientists with an active interest in interventional radiology and to promote research as well as registries. CIRSE organises an annual congress with more than 5,000 participants, scientific meetings such as the European Conference on Embolotherapy and the European Conference on Interventional Oncology, as well as other educational activities such as courses focusing on specific procedures. It publishes a bimonthly [[medical journal]] entitled ''[[CardioVascular and Interventional Radiology]]'' as well as other publications such as newsletters and manuals. ==CIRSE Foundation== CIRSE’s educational arm, the CIRSE Foundation, is an independent non-profit foundation, promoting research and education in the fields of [[cardiology|cardiovascular]] and interventional radiology. The foundation funds several educational grants every year. ==External links== * {{Official|http://www.cirse.org}} * [http://www.cirse.org/index.php?pid=15 CIRSE Foundation] [[Category:Radiology]] [[Category:Medical imaging]] [[Category:Medical associations]] [[Category:Organizations established in 1985]]</text> </page> <page> <id>5519</id> <title>Carlo Ghezzi</title> <text>'''Carlo Ghezzi''' is a professor and Chair of Software Engineering at [[Politecnico di Milano]] (PdM), Italy and an Adjunct Professor at the [[Università della Svizzera italiana]] (USI), Switzerland.
