It was in operation from 1964 to 1973.<ref>http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Relics/virtex.html</ref> Titan was the computer on which [[Peter Swinnerton-Dyer]] developed the early multi-user [[time-sharing]] [[operating system]] called [[Temporary Supervisor]]. This was arguably the world's first [[time-sharing]] operating system<ref>http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Relics/virtex.html</ref>, although that title may be disputed. Titan differed from the Manchester [[Atlas Computer (Manchester)|Atlas]] by having a real, but cached, [[main memory]], rather than the [[virtual memory|paged (or virtual) memory]] used in the Manchester machine. The Titan's main memory had 128K of 48-bit words and was implemented using ferrite [[core store]] rather than the part core, part rotating [[Drum memory|drum-store]] used on the Manchester Atlas. It also had two large hard-disk drives and several magnetic tape decks. As with the Manchester Atlas, it used discrete components, in particular [[germanium]] [[transistor]]s. Some of these components can be seen in the online relics collection of the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory.<ref>http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/relicd?name=&machine=Titan&class=any&uid=</ref> As a prototype it had a reputation for technical excellence; but it was also often highly unreliable, and indeed some wiring anomalies were still being discovered several years after it was first commissioned. One of Titan's most intensive uses was to compute the inverse [[Fourier Transform]]s of data from the [[One-Mile Telescope|One-Mile Radio Telescope]]. A second Atlas 2 was built, also in Cambridge, and was installed at the Computer-Aided Design Centre ([[AVEVA|CADCentre]]) on [[Madingley Road]]. This machine, the last Atlas, was finally switched off on 21 December 1976. ==Notes== <references /> {{Use dmy dates|date=September 2010}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Titan (Computer)}} [[Category:1964 establishments]] [[Category:1973 establishments]] [[Category:Early computers]] [[Category:University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory]] [[Category:History of Cambridge]] {{Compu-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>37840</id> <title>Title (command)</title> <text>{{lowercase}} [[Image:Command prompt on windows vista.png|thumb|300px|Command Prompt displaying the default title.]] In [[computing]], '''<code>title</code>''' is a [[command (computing)|command]] that changes the title for the [[Microsoft Windows]] [[Command Prompt (Windows)|Command Prompt]] window.

It contains many nontrivial recreational puzzles of the sort for which Smullyan is well-known. It is also a gentle and humorous introduction to [[combinatory logic]] and the associated [[metamathematics]], built on an elaborate [[ornithological]] [[metaphor]]. [[Combinatory logic]], functionally equivalent to the [[lambda calculus]], is a branch of [[symbolic logic]] having the expressive power of [[set theory]], and with deep connections to questions of [[Computability theory (computation)|computability]] and [[Provability logic|provability]]. Smullyan's exposition takes the form of an imaginary account of two men going into a forest and discussing the unusual "birds" (combinators) they find there (bird watching was a hobby of the inventor of combinatory logic, [[Haskell Curry]]). Each species of bird in Smullyan's forest stands for a particular kind of [[combinator]] appearing in the conventional treatment of combinatory logic. Each bird has a distinctive call, which it emits when it hears the call of another bird. Hence an initial call by certain "birds" gives rise to a cascading sequence of calls by a succession of birds. Deep inside the forest dwells the Mockingbird, which imitates other birds hearing themselves. The resulting cascade of calls and responses analogizes to abstract models of computing. With this analogy in
