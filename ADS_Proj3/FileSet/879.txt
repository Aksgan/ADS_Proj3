or network and block all users at once. These types of attack are, in practice, very hard to prevent, because the behavior of whole [[computer network|networks]] needs to be analyzed, not only the behaviour of small pieces of code. [[Distributed denial of service#Distributed attack|Distributed denial of service]] (DDoS) attacks are common, where a large number of compromised hosts (commonly referred to as "[[zombie computer]]s", used as part of a [[botnet]] with, for example; a [[Computer worm|worm]], trojan horse, or [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor exploit]] to control them.) are used to flood a target system with network requests, thus attempting to render it unusable through resource exhaustion. Another technique to exhaust victim resources is through the use of an attack amplifier — where the attacker takes advantage of poorly designed protocols on 3rd party machines, such as FTP or DNS, in order to instruct these hosts to launch the flood. There are also commonly found vulnerabilities in applications that cannot be used to take control over a computer, but merely make the target application malfunction or crash. This is known as a denial-of-service exploit. ===Indirect attacks=== An indirect attack is an attack launched by a third party computer. By using someone else's computer to launch an attack, it becomes far more difficult to track down the actual attacker. There have also been cases where attackers took advantage of public anonymizing systems, such as the [[Tor (anonymity network)|tor onion router]] system. ===Backdoors=== A [[backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] in a computer system (or cryptosystem or algorithm) is a method of bypassing normal authentication, securing remote access to a computer, obtaining access to plaintext, and so on, while attempting to remain undetected. The backdoor may take the form of an installed program (e.g., Back Orifice), or could be a modification to an existing program or hardware device. A specific form of backdoors are [[rootkits]], which replaces system binaries and/or hooks into the function calls of the operating system to hide the presence of other programs, users, services and open ports. It may also fake information about disk and memory usage. ===Direct access attacks=== [[Image:PersonalStorageDevices.agr.jpg|thumb|Common consumer devices that can be used to transfer data surreptitiously.]] Someone who has gained access to a computer can install any type of devices to compromise security, including [[operating system]] modifications, software worms, [[keystroke logging|key loggers]], and [[covert listening device]]s. The attacker can also easily download large quantities of data onto backup media, for instance [[CD-R]]/[[DVD-R]], [[Tape drive|tape]]; or portable devices such as [[keydrive]]s, [[digital camera]]s or [[digital audio player]]s. Another common technique is to boot an operating system contained on a [[CD-ROM]] or other bootable media and read the data from the [[harddrive]](s) this way. The only way to defeat this is to encrypt the storage media and store the key separate from the system. ''See also:'' [[:Category:Cryptographic attacks]] ===Reducing vulnerabilities=== Computer [[source code|code]] is regarded by some as a form of [[mathematics]]. It is theoretically possible to [[proof (mathematics)|prove]] the [[correctness]] of certain classes of computer programs, though the feasibility of actually achieving this in large-scale practical systems is regarded as small by some with practical experience in the industry — see [[Bruce Schneier]] et al. It's also possible to protect messages in transit (i.e., [[communication]]s) by means of [[cryptography]]. One method of encryption — the [[one-time pad]] — is unbreakable when correctly used. This method was used by the Soviet Union during the Cold War, though flaws in their implementation allowed some [[cryptanalysis]] (See [[VENONA|Venona Project]]). The method uses a matching pair of key-codes, securely distributed, which are used once-and-only-once to encode and decode a single message. For transmitted computer encryption this method is difficult to use properly (securely), and highly inconvenient as well. Other methods of [[encryption]], while breakable in theory, are often virtually impossible to directly break by any means publicly known today. Breaking them requires some non-cryptographic input, such as a stolen key, stolen plaintext (at either end of the transmission), or some other extra cryptanalytic information. Social engineering and direct computer access (physical) attacks can only be prevented by non-computer means, which can be difficult to enforce, relative to the sensitivity of the information. Even in a highly disciplined environment, such as in military organizations, social engineering attacks can still be difficult to foresee and prevent. In practice, only a small fraction of computer program code is mathematically proven, or even goes through comprehensive [[information technology audit]]s or inexpensive but extremely valuable [[computer security audit]]s, so it's usually possible for a determined hacker to read, copy, alter or destroy data in well secured computers, albeit at the cost of great time and resources. Few attackers would audit applications for vulnerabilities just to attack a single specific system. It is possible to reduce an attacker's chances by keeping systems up to date, using a [[security scanner]] or/and hiring competent people responsible for security. The effects of data loss/damage can be reduced by careful [[back up|backing up]] and [[insurance]]. ==Security measures== A state of computer "security" is the conceptual ideal, attained by the use of the three processes: #[[Risk prevention|Prevention]] #[[Detection]] #Response *[[User account]] [[access control]]s and [[cryptography]] can protect systems files and data, respectively. *[[Firewall (networking)|Firewalls]] are by far the most common prevention systems from a network security perspective as they can (if properly configured) shield access to internal network services, and block certain kinds of attacks through packet filtering. *[[Intrusion Detection System]]s (IDS's) are designed to detect network attacks in progress and assist in post-attack [[forensics]], while [[audit trail]]s and [[data logging|log]]s serve a similar function for individual systems. *"Response" is necessarily defined by the assessed security requirements of an individual system and may cover the range from simple upgrade of protections to notification of [[legal]] authorities, counter-attacks, and the like. In some special cases, a complete destruction of the compromised system is favored, as it may happen that not all the compromised resources are detected. Today, computer security comprises mainly "preventive" measures, like firewalls or an [[Exit Procedure]]. A firewall can be defined as a way
