that transport traffic between the servers and to the outside world. [[Redundancy (engineering)|Redundancy]] of the Internet connection is often provided by using two or more upstream service providers (see [[Multihoming]]). Some of the servers at the data center are used for running the basic [[Internet]] and [[intranet]] services needed by internal users in the organization, e.g., [[e-mail]] servers, [[proxy server]]s, and [[Domain Name System|DNS]] servers. Network security elements are also usually deployed: [[firewall (networking)|firewalls]], [[VPN]] [[Gateway (computer networking)|gateways]], [[intrusion detection system]]s, etc. Also common are monitoring systems for the network and some of the applications. Additional off site monitoring systems are also typical, in case of a failure of communications inside the data center. ==Applications== [[Image:Floridaserversfront1.jpg|thumb|right|Multiple racks of servers, and how a data center commonly looks.]] The main purpose of a data center is running the applications that handle the core business and operational data of the organization. Such systems may be proprietary and developed internally by the organization, or bought from [[enterprise software]] vendors. Such common applications are [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] and [[Customer relationship management|CRM]] systems. A data center may be concerned with just [[operations architecture]] or it may provide other services as well. Often these applications will be composed of multiple hosts, each running a single component. Common components of such applications are [[database]]s, [[file server]]s, [[application server]]s, [[middleware]], and various others. Data centers are also used for off site backups. Companies may subscribe to backup services provided by a data center. This is often used in conjunction with [[Tape drive|backup tapes]]. Backups can be taken of servers locally on to tapes. However, tapes stored on site pose a security threat and are also susceptible to fire and flooding. Larger companies may also send their backups off site for added security. This can be done by backing up to a data center. Encrypted backups can be sent over the Internet to another data center where they can be stored securely. For disaster recovery, several large hardware vendors have developed mobile solutions that can be installed and made operational in very short time.

Used mainly in databases, the term refers to identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate, irrelevant etc. parts of the data and then replacing, modifying or deleting this ''[[dirty data]]''. After cleansing, a [[data set]] will be consistent with other similar data sets in the system. The inconsistencies detected or removed may have been originally caused by different [[data dictionary]] definitions of similar entities in different stores, may have been caused by user entry errors, or may have been corrupted in transmission or storage. Data cleansing differs from [[data validation]] in that validation almost invariably means data is rejected from the system at entry and is performed at entry time, rather than on batches of data. The actual process of data cleansing may involve removing [[typographical error]]s or validating and correcting values against a known list of entities. The validation may be strict (such as rejecting any address that does not have a valid [[postal code]]) or [[Fuzzy logic|fuzzy]] (such as correcting records that partially match existing, known records). == Motivation == Administratively, incorrect or inconsistent data can lead to false conclusions and misdirected [[investment]]s on both public and private scales. For instance, the [[government]] may want to analyze population census figures to decide which regions require further spending and investment on [[infrastructure]] and services. In this case, it will be important to have access to reliable data to avoid erroneous fiscal decisions. In the business world, incorrect data can be costly. Many companies use customer information [[database]]s that record data like contact information, addresses, and preferences. If for instance the addresses are inconsistent, the company will suffer the cost of resending mail or even losing customers. == Data quality == High quality data needs to pass a set of quality criteria. Those include: * '''Accuracy''': An aggregated value over the criteria of integrity, consistency and density * '''Integrity''': An aggregated value over the criteria of completeness and validity * '''Completeness''': Achieved by correcting data containing anomalies * '''Validity''': Approximated by the amount of data satisfying integrity constraints * '''Consistency''': Concerns contradictions and syntactical anomalies * '''Uniformity''': Directly related to irregularities * '''Density''': The quotient of missing values in the data and the
