are not changed. ==United Kingdom== [[Image:BBFC ratings.JPG|215px|thumb|right|UK film classification certificates.]] :''Main articles: [[British Board of Film Classification]], [[History of British film certificates|History of British Film Certificates]] The [[British Board of Film Classification]] (BBFC) rates both motion pictures and videos (and an increasing number of [[video game]]s). The rating system was introduced in 1913 and, as of 1985, also rates videos. County authorities are ultimately responsible for film ratings for cinema showings in their area. County Councils often ignore the BBFC advised rating and rate films with another BBFC certificate in their county only, e.g.: the BBFC rates a film as 15 but the County council gives the film a 12A rating in their county. Rating certificates from the BBFC are not legally binding whereas those for videos are. The current BBFC system is: * '''[[BBFC|U (Universal)]] ''' Suitable for all. (The board states that while they cannot predict what might upset a particular child, a 'U' film should be suitable for audiences aged 4 and older). Examples include [[Ferngully]] and [[The Incredibles]]. * '''[[BBFC|PG (Parental Guidance)]]''' General viewing but some scenes may be unsuitable for young children. (It is the board's policy that movies rated 'PG' should not disturb a child of about 8 years of age or older; however, parents are advised to consider whether the content may upset young or more sensitive children). Examples include [[Coraline]] and [[The Simpsons Movie]]. * '''[[12A certificate|12A (12 Accompanied/Advisory)]]''' Recommended for 12 years and older. People under 12 years must be accompanied by an adult. (Exclusively for cinema, '12A' was first implemented on ''[[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|The Bourne Identity]]'' and, contrary to popular belief, not on ''[[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man]]'', which was first released months before, under the previously fully restrictive 12 certificate, and then immediately re-released to take advantage of the new guidelines). Examples include ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' and ''[[Yes Man]]''. * '''[[12 certificate|12]]''' Recommended for 12 years and older. Nobody younger than 12 may rent or buy a '12' rated video. (Until 31 August 2002, this mandatory certificate used to apply to cinema exhibitions as well). * '''[[15 certificate|15]]''' Suitable only for 15 years and older. Nobody younger than 15 may see a '15' film in a cinema. Nobody younger than 15 may rent or buy a '15' rated video (these films may contain offensive or emotionally harrowing scenes or strong language and violence). Examples include ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]'' and ''[[The Girl Next Door]]''. * '''[[18 certificate|18]]''' Suitable only for adults. Nobody younger than 18 may see an '18' film in a cinema. Nobody younger than 18 may rent or buy an '18' rated video (These films may contain extreme [[gore]]/violence and/or sexually explicit content). Examples include ''[[A Clockwork Orange]]'' and ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]''. * '''[[R18 certificate|R18 (Restricted 18)]]''' To be shown only in specially licensed cinemas, or supplied only in licensed sex shops, and to adults that are older than 18 years old. (These films contain [[Pornography|sexually explicit]], [[Pornography|pornographic]] content.) The 12A, 12, 15, 18 and R18 categories are restricted, and it is against the law for anybody under the age given on the packaging. Films may receive a different rating when released on DVD/video to that at the cinema. It is not unusual for certain films to be refused classification, effectively banning them from sale or exhibition in the UK. Sometimes compulsory cuts are made to films, such as cuts to sexual violence and animal cruelity. Any media which has been banned receives an 'R' certificate (Rejected). Videos deemed by their distributors to be exempt under the [[Video Recordings Act 1984]] (typically non-fiction content such as music videos, sporting highlights, fitness videos, nature films, etc.) may bear the mark '''E''' (for ''exempt''), though this is not a rating and the BBFC does not maintain a symbol. The BBFC also provides ratings for video games which may be unsuitable for sale to young people or children (such as [[Grand Theft Auto (series)|Grand Theft Auto]]). However, the majority of games are merely rated by the voluntary [[Pan European Game Information|PEGI]] rating system, that replaced the [[Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association|ELSPA]] rating system. It is very rare for a video game to be banned in the United Kingdom, as many controversial games have been released under more recent and more lenient directorship at the organisation, although it has happened once to [[Manhunt 2]]. ===Former ratings=== The list of ratings that the BBFC either a. retired or b. replaced with another rating. * '''Uc''' Suitable for all but especially suitable for children under age 5. Used for video only. Retired in 2009. * '''A''' Some cinemas ruled that children must be accompanied by an adult. In 1970 the discription was changed to "those over 5 years old admitted but those under age 14 are not recommended". The rating was replaced by PG in 1982. * '''AA''' Suitable only for 14 years and older. Nobody younger than 14 may see an 'AA' film in a cinema. The rating was replaced by 15 in 1982. * '''X''' Suitable only for adults. Nobody younger than 16 may see an 'X' film in a cinema. The age limit was raised to 18 in 1970. The rating was replaced by 18 in 1982. * '''H''' Some cinemas ruled that children under age 16 cannot be admitted. The rating was replaced by X in 1951. ==United States== {{Cleanup|section|date=November 2007}} {{Main|Motion Picture Association of America film rating system}} Prior to 1968, some large cities and states had public rating boards which determined whether films were suitable for display to the public in theatres. The United States Supreme Court in the case of ''[[Freedman v. Maryland]]'' [[Case citation|380 U.S. 51]] (1965) effectively ended government operated rating boards when it decided that a rating board could only approve a film; it had no power to ban a film. A rating board must either approve a film within a reasonable time, or it would have to go to court to stop a film from being shown in theatres. Other court cases decided that since
