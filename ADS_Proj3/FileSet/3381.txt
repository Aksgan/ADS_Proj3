The long-term objective is to limit the number of days with average [[ozone]] concentrations above 120 µg/m3 to less than 25 days a year (see table below). The objectives of the directive are in line with the [[World Health Organization]]'s guidelines for ozone. The directive requires national authorities to inform the public – hourly or daily – about any incidence of ozone pollution above 180 µg/m3 ('''information threshold'''). Also, Member States should report monthly to the European Commission on all exceedances of the information and alert thresholds''' (see table below). Each year they must provide additional information on ozone pollution, especially concerning exceedances of the long-term objective. {| class="wikitable" |- ! Objective ! Value ! Measured ! Target/action |- | Information threshold | 180 µg/m3 | Hourly average | National authorities should inform the public and give advice immediately after an exceedance.

It can cause lung inflammation (irritation) even after only a few hours of exposure. Ozone exposure has been linked to a number of [http://www.eea.europa.eu/maps/ozone/impacts/health-impacts health effects] and is thought to be the cause of the premature deaths of thousands of people in Europe each year. Some people are more vulnerable than others. Children and people with [[asthma]] or other respiratory illnesses are particularly high-risk groups. == Ozone and environmental impacts == Ground-level [[ozone]] can damage all types of green vegetation, including the foliage of trees. Ozone is absorbed by leaves and impedes plant growth. Ozone is recognised as the most serious regional air pollution problem for the agricultural sector in Europe. It reduces [[crop yield]]s by hindering plant growth. In 2000, it was estimated that the overall ozone damage to crops corresponded to an economic loss to farmers across EU-25 of about EUR 2.8 billion. There are marked differences in damage to crops across Europe, depending on agricultural activity, soil moisture and ozone concentration. Most affected by elevated ozone concentrations are countries that are growing [[wheat]]. The economic or ecological cost of ozone damage to wild vegetation has not been estimated. ==See also== * [[Ozone]] * [[Tropospheric ozone]] == External links == * [http://www.eea.europa.eu/maps/ozone/welcome The European Environment Agency's near real-time ozone web (ozoneweb)] * [http://www.eea.europa.eu/ The European Environment Agency] [[Category:Geographic information systems]]</text> </page> <page> <id>27962</id> <title>P.I.P.S.

Acquiring the necessary metadata through manual definition of an information extraction system is a laborious task requiring a lot of time and expert know-how. PANKOW (Pattern-based Annotation through Knowledge on the Web) , represents an automated self annotating Web method based on counting [[Google]] hits of instantiated linguistic patterns. It employs an unsupervised learning approach to characterize instances with regard to ontology, by combining the idea of using linguistic patterns to identify ontological relations as well as the idea of using the Web as a big corpus to overcome data sparseness.
