Abelson]] and their research group, and are a method of representing [[procedural knowledge]]. They are very much like [[frame (artificial intelligence)|frames]], except the values that fill the slots must be ordered. The classic example of a script involves the typical sequence of events that occur when a person dines in a restaurant: ''finding a seat, reading the menu, ordering drinks from the waitstaff...'' In the script form, these would be decomposed into [[conceptual dependency theory|conceptual transitions]], such as '''MTRANS''' and '''PTRANS''', which refer to ''mental transitions [of information]'' and ''physical transitions [of things]''. Schank, Abelson and their colleagues tackled some of the most difficult problems in [[artificial intelligence]] (i.e., [[story understanding]]), but ultimately their line of work ended without tangible success. This type of work received little attention after the 1980s, but it is very influential in later [[knowledge representation]] techniques, such as [[case-based reasoning]]. Scripts can be inflexible. To deal with inflexibility, smaller modules called [[memory organization packet]]s (MOP) can be combined in a way that is appropriate for the situation. ==References== *Schank and Abelson ''[http://www-static.cc.gatech.edu/~jimmyd/summaries/schank1977.html Scripts, Plans, Goals and Understanding]'', Erlbaum, 1977. *Brief overview of the [http://tip.psychology.org/schank.html Script theory] [[Category:History of artificial intelligence]] [[Category:Knowledge representation]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33458</id> <title>Scroll wheel</title> <text>[[Image:3-Tastenmaus Microsoft.jpg|250px|thumb|The middle "wheel" is the scroll wheel.]] A '''scroll wheel''' (or '''mouse wheel''') is a hard [[plastic]] or [[rubber]]y disc (the "[[wheel]]") on a [[computer mouse]] that is perpendicular to the mouse surface. It is normally located between the left and right mouse buttons. == Functionality == It is used, as the name suggests, for [[scrolling]]. It can also be used as a third mouse button by pressing on it. Some modern mice can scroll horizontally as well as vertically, using either a [[wikt:tilt|tilt]]ing scroll-wheel (introduced by [[Microsoft]]) or a [[trackball|scroll ball]] (found on [[Apple Computer|Apple]]'s [[Apple Mighty Mouse|Mighty Mouse]]). [[Logitech]] MicroGear mice (like the [[Logitech MX Revolution|MX Revolution]] and the [[Logitech VX Revolution|VX Revolution]]) use a 14 gram scroll wheel which can preserve the [[moment of inertia]] like a [[flywheel]] and can be used to quickly scroll through long pages and lists.<ref name="Logitech_MicroGear">[http://www.logitech.com/lang/pdf/ib-microgear_and_smartshift_EN.pdf Logitech.com]</ref> The [[Orbita mouse]] by [http://www.CybereSport.com Cyber Sport] takes a new approach with its continuous scrolling capability, achieved by employing the whole round mouse as a scroll wheel which rotates on a ball bearing base. [[Image:Bb7510.jpg|100px|thumb|Trackwheel (1) on a [[BlackBerry]]]] Scroll wheels are prevalent on modern computer mice. To many users, they have become an integral part of the [[hardware interface]]. However, non-wheeled mice are still available. Scroll wheels can also be found on such handheld devices as portable [[digital audio player]]s, [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s, or mobiles phones such as early [[Sony]] models and [[BlackBerry]] devices. On the Apple [[iPod]], the scroll wheel uses touch sensitive technologies from [[Synaptics]] (instead of being mechanical). == History == The scroll wheel was invented in 1995 for the Genius EasyScroll mouse made by [[Taiwan|Taiwanese]] company [[KYE Systems]]. The man credited with inventing what we recognize as the wheel is [[Eric Michelman]].<ref name="Coding_Horror_Genius_EasyScroll">[http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000865.html Coding Horror: Meet The Inventor of the Mouse Wheel<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It first gained popularity in the late 1990s when [[operating system]]s had the feature built-in, and is notably one of the first additions to the basic two-button mouse design used for [[personal computer|PCs]] that became a [[de facto standard]]. It is also one of the first hardware elements (aside from high-speed [[modem]]s) designed directly in response to the proliferation of the [[World Wide Web]], where efficient mouse-only scrolling is most useful. Also, clicking a [[hyperlink]] with a third button or scroll wheel can create a tab in certain web browsers. In the 21st century, scroll wheels started appearing on [[Computer keyboard|keyboards]] as well, particularly on [[Logitech]] and [[Microsoft]] models. It is usually located to the left of the [[caps lock]] key. The implementation of scroll wheels on [[laptop computer]]s has generally faded, while [[touchpad]]s are often made with the edges acting to scroll the page (rather than to move the [[cursor]]), partly making up for the lack of a scroll wheel. On laptops with multitouch capability, scrolling is usually achieved by touching and dragging two fingers on the touchpad at the same time. Many [[Linux]] distributions offer a third method of scrolling using the touchpad, where the user will first activate scroll-mode by pressing in a corner of the pad, and than dragging in a circle around the center of
