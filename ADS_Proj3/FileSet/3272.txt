wide range of the information about Britain that can be used for social and economic policy-making as well as painting a portrait of the country as its population evolves over time. This is often produced in ways that make comparison with other societies and economies possible. Much of the data on which policy-makers depend is produced by ONS through a combination of a decennial population census, samples and surveys and analysis of data generated by businesses and organisations such as the National Health Service and the register of births, marriages and deaths. Both its publications and its publicly-available raw data, available free, are reported and discussed daily in the media as the basis for the public understanding of the country in which they live. === Applications of data === The reliance on some of these data by government (both local and national) makes ONS material central to debates about the determination of priorities, the allocation of resources and for decisions on interest rates or borrowing. The complexity and degree and speed of change in the society, combined with the challenge of measuring some of these (e.g. in relation to longevity, migration or illness patterns or fine movements in inflation or other aspects of national accounts) give rise to periodic debates about some of its indicators and portrayals. Many of these rely on sources which are outside of ONS, while some of its own sources need to be supplemented, for example between censuses, by updated but less rigorously-obtained information from other sources. Consequently, unexpected or incomplete data or occasional errors or disputes about its analysis can also attract considerable attention. == Independence == [[Gordon Brown]], then Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced on 28 November 2005,<ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051128/text/51128w20.htm#51128w20.html_spnew7 Statement to the House of Commons on the review of the Framework for National Statistics], by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, 28 November 2005.</ref> that the government intended to publish plans in early 2006 to legislate to render the ONS and the statistics it generates independent of government on a model based on the independence of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England.<ref>[http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget/budget_06/bud_bud06_speech.cfm Budget Statement] made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, 22 March 2006</ref> This was originally a 1997 Labour manifesto commitment<ref>[http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/man/lab97.htm Labour Party Manifesto, General Election 1997], Keele University website.</ref> and was also the policy of the Liberal Democrat<ref>[http://www.libdems.org.uk/media/documents/policies/manifesto2005.pdf Liberal Democrats Manifesto General Election 2005].</ref> and Conservative<ref>[http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=news.story.page&obj_id=126557 ''"Let Parliament appoint new UK statistics chief"''], press release from Conservative Party website.</ref> parties.
