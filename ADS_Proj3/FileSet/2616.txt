Item ''j'' is needed ''B<sub>j</sub>'' times, each "pattern" of items which fit into a single knapsack have a variable, ''x<sub>i</sub>'' (there are ''m'' patterns), and pattern ''i'' uses item ''j'' ''b<sub>ij</sub>'' times: {| |colspan="2"|minimize <math>\sum_{i=1}^m x_i</math> | |- |subject to |<math>\sum_{i=1}^m b_{ij} x_i \leq B_j,</math> |for all <math>1 \leq j \leq n</math> |- | |<math>x_i \in \{0,1,\ldots ,n\}</math> |for all <math>1\leq i \leq m</math> |} If, to the multiple choice knapsack problem, we add the constraint that each subset is of size ''n'' and remove the restriction on total weight, we get the '''[[assignment problem]]''', which is also the problem of finding a maximal '''[[bipartite matching]]''': {| |colspan="2"|minimize <math>\sum_{i=1}^k\sum_{j=1}^n p_{ij} x_{ij}</math> | |- |subject to |<math>\sum_{i=1}^n x_{ij} = 1,</math> |for all <math>1 \leq j \leq n</math> |- | |<math>\sum_{j=1}^n x_{ij} = 1,</math> |for all <math>1 \leq i \leq n</math> |- | |<math> x_{ij} \in \{0,1\}</math> |for all <math>1 \leq i \leq k</math> and all <math>j \in N_i</math> |} Although less common than those above, several other knapsack-like problems exist, including: * Collapsing knapsack problem * Nested knapsack problem * Nonlinear knapsack problem * Inverse-parametric knapsack problem{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} ==References== <references/> * [http://www.diku.dk/users/pisinger/95-1.pdf "Algorithms for Knapsack Problems"], D.

A live CD or live DVD is a CD or DVD containing a bootable computer operating system. Live CDs are unique in that they have the ability to run a complete, modern operating system on a computer lacking mutable secondary storage, such as a hard disk drive. == Rescue and repair live CDs == *[[Billix]] – a multiboot distribution and system administration toolkit with the ability to install any of the included Linux distributions *[[Inquisitor (hardware testing software)|Inquisitor]] – Linux-based hardware diagnostics, stress testing and benchmarking Live CD *[[Recovery Is Possible|RIP: (R)ecovery (I)s (P)ossible]] is a Linux-based CD with partition tool and network tools ([[Samba (software)|Samba]]), based on the 2.6.17 kernel. * [[System Folder]] of [[Mac OS]] on a [[Compact Disc|CD]] or on a [[floppy disk]] – works on any media readable by [[68k]] or [[PowerPC]] Macintosh computers. *[[SystemRescueCD]] is a Linux-based CD with tools for Windows and Linux repairs, based on the 2.6 kernel. *[[Trinity Rescue Kit]] – Mandriva Linux-based CD for use on a Windows or Linux-based system. *[[Parted Magic]] == BSD-based == * [[Anonym.OS]] – an [[OpenBSD]]-based disk for secure anonymous web browsing * [[DesktopBSD]] – as of 1.6RC1{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} FreeBSD and FreeSBIE based * [[DragonFly BSD]] * [[FreeBSD]] – has supported use of a "fixit" CD for diagnostics since 1996 * [[FreeNAS]] – m0n0wall-based * [[FreeSBIE]] – [[FreeBSD]]-based * [[Ging (live CD)|Ging]] – [[Debian GNU/kFreeBSD]]-based * [[Jibbed]] – NetBSD-based * [[m0n0wall]] – FreeBSD-based * [[PC-BSD]] – FreeBSD-based - PC-BSD is a complete desktop operating system * [[pfSense]] – m0n0wall-based == Linux-based == {{See also|Comparison of Linux distributions#Live CDs/DVDs/USBs}} === Debian-based === These are directly based on Debian: *[[Debian Live]] - Official live CD version of Debian. *[[grml]] – installable Live CD for sysadmins and text tool users *[[Knoppix]] – the "original" Debian-based Live CD *[[PureOS]] - based on Debian testing, installable Live CD/USB *[[aptosid]]<ref>[http://aptosid.com aptosid.com :: debian based live cd development]</ref> based on Debian unstable (Sid), installable Live CD, DVD ==== Knoppix-based ==== ''A large number of live CDs are based on Knoppix.
