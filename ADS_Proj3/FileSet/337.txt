hesitant about the electronic banking transition given the high cost of the early machines. Additionally, executives were concerned that customers would resist having machines handling their money.<ref>[http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/comphist/wetzel.htm Smithsonian : Interview with Don Wetzel]</ref> In 1995, the [[Smithsonian National Museum of American History]] recognised Docutel and Wetzel as the inventors of the networked ATM.<ref>[http://www.thocp.net/hardware/atm.htm Wetzel recognized by Docutel and Smithsonian]</ref> ATMs first came into use in December 1972 in the UK; the IBM 2984 was designed at the request of [[Lloyds Bank]]. The 2984 CIT (Cash Issuing Terminal) was the first true Cashpoint, similar in function to today's machines; Cashpoint is still a [[registered trademark]] of Lloyds TSB in the UK. All were online and issued a variable amount which was immediately deducted from the account. A small number of 2984s were supplied to a US bank. Notable historical models of ATMs include the [[IBM 3624]] and [[IBM 473x|473x]] series, [[Diebold 10xx]] and [[TABS 9000]] series, and [[NCR 50xx]] series. ==Location== [[Image:ATM pinpad in german.jpg|thumb|left|An ATM Encrypting PIN Pad (EPP) with [[German language|German]] markings]] ATMs are placed not only near or inside the premises of banks, but also in locations such as shopping centers/malls, airports, grocery stores, petrol/gas stations, restaurants, or any place large numbers of people may gather. These represent two types of ATM installations: on and off premise. On premise ATMs are typically more advanced, multi-function machines that complement an actual bank branch's capabilities and thus more expensive. Off premise machines are deployed by financial institutions and also ISOs (or Independent Sales Organizations) where there is usually just a straight need for cash, so they typically are the cheaper mono-function devices. In Canada, when an ATM is not operated by a financial institution it is known as a [[White Label ATMs in Canada|"White Label ATM"]]. In North America, banks often have [[drive-thru]] lanes providing access to ATMs. Many ATMs have a sign above them indicating the name of the bank or organization owning the ATM, and possibly including the list of ATM networks to which that machine is connected. This type of sign is called a ''topper''. {{Clear}} ==Financial networks== [[Image:Geldautomaat.jpg|thumb|right|An ATM in the [[Netherlands]]. The [[logo]]s of a number of [[interbank network]]s this ATM is connected to are shown.]] Most ATMs are connected to [[interbank network]]s, enabling people to withdraw and deposit money from machines not belonging to the bank where they have their account or in the country where their accounts are held (enabling cash withdrawals in local currency). Some examples of interbank networks include [[Pulse (interbank network)|PULSE]], [[PLUS]], [[Cirrus (interbank network)|Cirrus]], [[Interac]], Interswitch, [[STAR (interbank network)|STAR]], and [[LINK (UK)|LINK]]. ATMs rely on [[authorization]] of a [[financial transaction]] by the card issuer or other authorizing institution via the communications network. This is often performed through an [[ISO 8583]] messaging system. Many banks charge [[ATM usage fees]]. In some cases, these fees are charged solely to users who are not customers of the bank where the ATM is installed; in other cases, they apply to all users. In order to allow a more diverse range of devices to attach to their networks, some interbank networks have passed rules expanding the definition of an ATM to be a terminal that either has the vault within its footprint or utilizes the vault or cash drawer within the merchant establishment, which allows for the use of a [[scrip cash dispenser]]. [[Image:Diebold 1063 ATM with modem.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Diebold 1063]]ix with a dial-up modem visible at the base]] [[File:Cash Machine in Trogir.JPG|thumb|ATM in Trogir, Croatia]] ATMs typically connect directly to their host or [[ATMC|ATM Controller]] via either [[ADSL]] or dial-up [[modem]] over a [[telephone]] line or directly via a leased line. Leased lines are preferable to [[plain old telephone service|POTS]] lines because they require less time to establish a connection. Leased lines may be comparatively expensive to operate versus a POTS line, meaning less-trafficked machines will usually rely on a dial-up modem. That dilemma may be solved as high-speed Internet [[VPN]] connections become more ubiquitous. Common lower-level layer communication protocols used by ATMs to communicate back to the bank include [[Systems Network Architecture|SNA]] over [[Synchronous Data Link Control|SDLC]], [[TC500]] over [[Asynchronous communication|Async]], [[X.25]], and [[TCP/IP]] over [[Ethernet]]. In addition to methods employed for transaction security and secrecy, all communications traffic between the ATM and the Transaction Processor may also be encrypted via methods such as [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]].<ref>[http://www.ebcvg.com/press.php?id=794 Eicon Networks Develops SSL-VPN For Secure Remote Working] IT Observer</ref> ==Global use== There are no hard international or government-compiled numbers totaling the complete number of ATMs in use worldwide.
