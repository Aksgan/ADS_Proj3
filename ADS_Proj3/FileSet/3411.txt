First, PTZ is an acronym for [[Panning (camera)|pan]], [[Tilt (camera)|tilt]], and [[Zoom lens|zoom]] and may refer merely to features of specific [[surveillance cameras]]. Second, PTZ Cameras may also be used to describe an entire category of cameras where a combination of sound and/or [[motion detector|motion]] and/or change in heat signature may enable the camera to activate, focus and track suspected changes in the video field. By activating only during times of change, systems can notify human monitors and minimize storage requirements. In the March 2009 edition of "Security Products" magazine, Keith Jentoft notes the continuing problems organizations have with outdoor PTZ cameras during thunderstorms. Despite continuing improvements in PTZ software, problems with continual activation during [[thunderstorm]]s have led some organizations to completely disable these types of cameras during the duration of thunderstorms. This translates to continuing challenges in trying to monitor and protect facilities from [[crime]] and [[terrorism]] during inclement weather.also it has a wide applications the defense organization ==Auto tracking== A new innovation to the PTZ camera is a built-in firmware program that monitors the change of pixels generated by the video chip in the camera. When the pixels change due to movement within the cameras field of view, the camera can actually focus on the pixel variation and move the camera in an attempt to center the pixel fluctuation on the video chip. This process results in the camera following movement. The program allows the camera to estimate the size of the object which is moving and distance of the movement from the camera. With this estimate the camera can adjust the cameras optical lens in and out in an attempt to stabilize the size of pixel fluctuation as a percentage of total viewing area. Once the movement exits the cameras field of view the camera automatically returns to a pre-programmed or "parked" position until it senses pixel variation and the process starts over again. == See also == *[[IP Camera]] == References == * March 2009 edition of "Security Products" magazine, Keith Jentoft, p 114 [[Category:Security engineering]] [[Category:Video]] [[Category:Year of introduction missing]] [[es:Cámara PTZ]]</text> </page> <page> <id>28341</id> <title>Pancake</title> <text>{{about|the food}} {{Redirect|Griddle cake|the Irish style bread|Soda bread}} [[File:Pancake and crumpet.jpg|right|thumb|Scottish pancake and fruit [[crumpet]]]] [[File:Crêpe opened up.jpg|thumb|Crêpe opened]] A '''pancake''' is a thin, flat cake prepared from a [[batter (cooking)|batter]] and cooked on a hot [[griddle]] or [[frying pan]]. Most pancakes are [[quick bread]]s; some use a [[yeast (baking)|yeast]]-raised or fermented batter. Most pancakes are cooked one side on a griddle and flipped partway through to cook the other side. Depending on the region, pancakes may be served at any time, with a variety of toppings or fillings including jam, chocolate chips, fruit, syrup or meat. Archaeological evidence suggests that varieties of pancakes are probably the earliest and most widespread types of cereal food eaten in prehistoric societies whereby dry carbohydrate-rich seed flours mixed with the available protein-rich liquids, usually milk and eggs, were baked on hot stones or in shallow earthenware pots over an open fire to form a nutritious and highly palatable foodstuff.<ref>Jones, M.
