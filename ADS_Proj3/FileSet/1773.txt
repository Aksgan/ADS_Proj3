The University Library is also a department of the University's central administration through which the libraries collaborate in the areas of digital acquisitions and collections, information technology, high-density storage, and preservation.<ref>[http://hul.harvard.edu/about.html HUL summary/overview]</ref> The Harvard University Library and Google are building on a successful pilot conducted by Harvard and Google throughout 2005. The project will increase Internet access to the holdings of the Harvard University Library, which includes more than 15.8 million volumes. While physical access to Harvard's library materials generally is restricted to current Harvard students, faculty, and researchers, or to scholars who can come to Cambridge, the Harvard-Google Project has been designed to enable both members of the Harvard community and users everywhere to discover works in the Harvard collection. :"The new century presents important new opportunities for libraries, including Harvard's, and for those individuals who use them. The collaboration between major research libraries and Google will create an important public good of benefit to students, teachers, scholars, and readers everywhere. The project harnesses the power of the Internet to allow users to identify books of interest with a precision and at a speed previously unimaginable. The user will then be guided to find books in local libraries or to purchase them from publishers and book vendors. And, for books in the public domain, there will be even broader access."<ref name="GBLP1"/> :"The Harvard-Google Project links the search power of the Internet to the depth of knowledge in Harvard's world-renowned libraries. Harvard has been collecting books for nearly four centuries. Among our out-of-copyright books are countless unique copies, unusual editions, and neglected or forgotten works. Our efforts with Google will bring about the broad dissemination of the knowledge contained in those books and, with it, significant information about the world views that those books represent .... By working with Google, Harvard is furthering an essential aspect of the University Library's mission, which is to serve scholars around the world." ::: -- [[Sidney Verba]], the former Carl H. Pforzheimer University Professor and former Director of the University Library.<ref name="hul2005"/> ====New York Public Library==== The [[New York Public Library]] ([[NYPL]]) is an institutional participant in the project.<ref name="nypl2004">[http://www.nypl.org/press/2004/google.cfm New York Public Library + Google]</ref> In this pilot program, NYPL is working with Google to offer a collection of its public domain books, which will be scanned in their entirety and made available for free to the public online. Users will be able to search and browse the full text of these works. When the scanning process is complete, the books may be accessed from both The New York Public Library's website and from the Google search engine. <ref name="nypl2004"/> :"The New York Public Library Research Libraries were struck by the convergence of Google's mission with their own. We see the digitization project as a transformational moment in the access to information and wanted not only to learn from it but also to influence it. Our response at present is a conservative one, with a limited number of volumes in excellent condition, in selected languages and in the public domain. With appropriate evaluation of this limited participation, we look forward to a more expansive collaboration in the future." ::: -– [[David Ferriero]], Andrew W. Mellon Director and Chief Executive of the Research Libraries, The New York Public Library.<ref name="GBLP1"/> ====Stanford University==== [[Stanford University]] (and Stanford University Libraries/[[SULAIR]]) is an institutional participant in the project.<ref>[http://www-sul.stanford.edu/about_sulair/special_projects/google_sulair_project_faq.html Stanford + Google]</ref> :"Stanford has been digitizing texts for years now to make them more accessible and searchable, but with books, as opposed to journals, such efforts have been severely limited in scope for both technical and financial reasons. The Google arrangement catapults our effective digital output from the boutique scale to the truly industrial. Through this program and others like it, Stanford intends to promote learning and stimulate innovation." ::: -– [[Michael A. Keller]], University Librarian.<ref name="GBLP1"/> ====University of Michigan==== The [[University of Michigan]] (and the [[University of Michigan Library]]) is an institutional participant in the [[Michigan digitization project|project]].<ref>[http://www.lib.umich.edu/mdp/ Michigan + Google]</ref> :"The project with Google is core to our mission as a great public university to advance knowledge — on campus and beyond.
