He said that everyone is trying to get from their real self to their ideal self, and the closer someone is to that ideal self the happier that person will be. Rogers also said that one factor in whether or not someone will be happy is the amount of unconditioned positive regard someone gets, or UPR. An example of UPR would possibly be a parent or guardian of a child taking care of them no matter what.<ref> Kass, Michael (1994).

''</ref> Self-handicapping behaviour allows individuals to externalise failures but internalise success; accepting credit for achievements, but allowing excuses for failings. Self-handicapping can be seen as a method of preserving [[self-esteem]] but it can also be used for [[self-enhancement]]. People may self-handicap to [[impression management|manage the impressions]] of others, or of themselves (though studies have been unable to test the latter).{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} An example of self-handicapping is the student who spends the night before an important exam partying rather than studying. The student fears failing their exam and appearing incapable. In partying the night before their exam the student has engaged in self-defeating behaviour and increased the likelihood of poor exam performance. However, in the event of failure, the student can offer fatigue and a hangover, rather than lack of ability, as plausible explanations. Furthermore, should the student receive positive feedback about their exam, their achievement is enhanced by the fact that they succeeded, despite the handicap. Researchers on self-handicapping have distinguished between ''claimed'' self-handicaps, in which the individual merely states that an obstacle to performance exists, and ''behavioral'' handicaps, in which the individual actually creates obstacles to performance.<ref name=Leary1986>Leary, M.

Half the participants had been given fairly easy problems, while the others were given difficult problems. Participants were then given the choice between a "performance-enhancing drug" and one which would inhibit it. Those participants who received the difficult problems were more likely to choose the impairing drug, and participants who faced easy problems were more likely to choose the enhancing drug. It is argued that the participants presented with hard problems, believing that their success had been due to chance, chose the impairing drug because they were looking for an [[Attribution theory#Internal versus external|external attribution]] (what might be called an
