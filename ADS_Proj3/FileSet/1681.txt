In some circumstances this type of genism may constitute [[genetic discrimination]], which in some forms is illegal in some countries (see the U.S. [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act]] of May 21, 2008). ==Popular culture== '''Genoism''' is a [[neologism]] coined by [[Andrew Niccol]], director and writer of the 1997 film ''[[Gattaca]]'', used to describe unethical and illegal [[genetic discrimination]]. Predictions of physical and mental performance are computed via [[genetics]] from [[DNA]] collected from hair, fingernails, skin flakes, spit swabs, eyelashes, etc. Upon birth, a number of genetically-induced characteristics are calculated: physical and intellectual capacity, life expectancy, probable successful diseases, and likely causes of death, all determined via [[blood sample]]s and [[genetic testing]]. Job interviews, health insurance purchasing, and even potential dates can be sized up according to the perceived quality of the person's DNA due to advancements in [[genome sequencing]]. This put an ironic twist to [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s [[sexual selection]] for good [[genes]]. According to the movie, "We now have discrimination down to a [[science]]." {{quote|My father was right. It didn't matter how much I lied on my resume. My real resume was in my cells. Why should anybody invest all that money to train me when there were a thousand other applicants with a far cleaner profile? Of course, it's illegal to discriminate, 'genoism' it's called. But no one takes the law seriously. If you refuse to disclose, they can always take a sample from a door handle or a handshake, even the saliva on your application form. If in doubt, a legal [[drug test]] can just as easily become an illegal peek at your future in the company.|Vincent Freeman ([[Ethan Hawke]])|' 1997}} ==References== {{Reflist}} [[Category:Medical ethics]] [[Category:Science fiction themes]] {{socio-stub}} [[bg:Генизъм]]</text> </page> <page> <id>15054</id> <title>Genitive connector</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=February 2009}} {{Expert-subject|Linguistics|date=March 2009}} {{Cleanup|date=March 2009}} '''Genitive connector''' is a term used in grammatical contexts of several languages and especially the [[Bantu languages]] to denote special word categories. It is used in formation of [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] terms through formation of conjunctions. Nouns can be modified by other nouns or other categories. There is prototypically a head word that comes before the connector and another one following. Long terms can therefore be achieved through the use of these genitive connectors. Commonly used connectors in [[Swahili language|Swahili]] take the form -a. Examples from selected bantu languages include. *Example in Swahili wa > Mkojo wa mtoto ; ya > nywele ya mama; cha> kidole cha gumba, la> Titi la mama etc *Example in [[Gikuyu]]: wa> Muti wa baba; ya>miti ya haaro; ga> gakunia gakwa etc *Example of a chain formed through compounding by conjunction by use of genitive connector: Mayai ya kuku wa kienyeji. ==References== *Muchemi, L. and Getao, K. 2007.

The goal of the project was to design new [[gene]]s and [[protein]]s for the purpose of better understanding how [[genome]]s evolve, and how genes and proteins operate. Practical applications of the research included the potential development of new medical treatments. The project was rolled into the [[Folding@home]] project, and is no longer supported. ==Surprise shut-down== The long-running project closed down with approximately 2 days' notice, despite recent messages from leaders about 'upcoming work'. This caused some surprise and disappointment among contributors at the time. Reasons appear to be financial. Users were told that results-to-date are available for any scientist who wished
