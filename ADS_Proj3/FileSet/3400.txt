Headquartered in [[Ewa Beach, Hawaii]], the PTWC is part of an international [[tsunami warning system]] (TWS) program and serves as the operational center for TWS of the Pacific issuing bulletins and warnings to participating members and other nations in the [[Pacific Ocean]] area of responsibility . It is also the regional (local) warning center for the State of [[Hawai'i]]. The other tsunami warning center is the [[West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center]] (WCATWC) in [[Palmer, Alaska]], serving all coastal regions of Canada and the United States except Hawai'i. The PTWC was established in 1949, following the 1946 [[Aleutian Island earthquake]] and a tsunami that resulted in 165 casualties in Hawaii and [[Alaska]]. After the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]], PTWC has extended its warning guidance to include the Indian Ocean, Caribbean and adjacent regions until regional capability is in place for these areas. These regional systems will form a global tsunami warning system once they are in operation. The PTWC uses seismic data as its starting point, but then takes into account [[oceanographic]] data when calculating possible threats. [[Tide]] gauges in the area of the earthquake are checked to establish if a tsunami has formed. The center then forecasts the future of the tsunami, issuing warnings to at-risk areas all around the Pacific basin if needed. There are never false alarms—if the PTWC issues a tsunami warning for a particular area, the tsunami is already on its way and ''will'' hit. As it takes more time for tsunamis to travel [[teletsunami|trans-oceanic]] distances, the PTWC can afford to take the time to make sure of its forecasts.{{citation needed|date=August 2008}} ==Bulletins== Depending on the seismic data, PTWC will issue the following types of bulletins: ;Tsunami Information Bulletin :At this time, though a threat exists, there is no evidence that a tsunami is making its way across the Pacific. ;Tsunami Watch :PTWC has determined the earthquake may very likely have created a tsunami and is advising parties to be alert as PTWC awaits tide data to support tsunami generation. ;Tsunami Warning :PTWC finds conditions serious enough to issue immediate concern to parts of the Pacific. The message will include approximate arrival times for various parts of the Pacific. ==Deep-ocean tsunami detection== {{see|Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis}} In 1995, [[NOAA]] began developing the [[Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis]] (DART) system. By 2001, an array of six stations had been deployed in the [[Pacific Ocean]].<ref>[http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/tsunami/Dart/dart_pb1.html Historical DART Background Information]</ref> Beginning in 2005, as a result of the tsunami caused by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]], plans were announced to add 32 more DART buoys to be operational by mid-2007.<ref>[http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2005/s2369.htm U.S. ANNOUNCES PLAN FOR AN IMPROVED TSUNAMI DETECTION AND WARNING SYSTEM]</ref> These stations give detailed information about tsunamis while they are still far off shore. Each station consists of a sea-bed bottom pressure recorder (at a depth of about 6000 m) which detects the passage of a tsunami and transmits the data to a surface [[buoy]] via acoustic modem. The surface buoy then radios the information to the PTWC via the [[GOES]] [[satellite]] system. The bottom pressure recorder lasts for two years while the surface buoy is replaced every year. The system has considerably improved the forecasting and warning of tsunamis in the Pacific Ocean. ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.prh.noaa.gov/pr/ptwc/ Pacific Tsunami Warning Center] *[http://wcatwc.arh.noaa.gov/ West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center] *[http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/Dart/dart.shtml DART] *[http://www.tsunami.noaa.gov/warning_system_works.html How the Pacific Tsunami Warning System works] *[http://www.envirtech.org/envirtech_tsunameter.htm Envirtech Tsunami Warning System, based on real time seafloor observatories measuring seismic waves and sea levels] *[http://usinfo.state.gov/gi/Archive/2005/Jun/09-848002.html U.S. Center Provides Interim Early Warning for Indian Ocean] *[http://ioc3.unesco.org/indotsunami/paris_annotated_agenda.htm IOC: Towards a Tsunami Warning System in the Indian Ocean] [[Category:Warning systems]] [[Category:Tsunami]] [[Category:Seismological observatories, organisations and projects]] [[da:Pacific Tsunami Warning Center]] [[de:Pacific Tsunami Warning Center]] [[es:Centro de Alerta de Tsunamis del Pacífico]] [[fr:Centre d'alerte des tsunamis dans le Pacifique]] [[it:Pacific Tsunami Warning Center]] [[nl:Pacific Tsunami Warning Center]] [[ja:太平洋津波警報センター]] [[zh:太平洋海嘯警報中心]]</text> </page> <page> <id>28250</id> <title>PackBits</title> <text>'''PackBits''' is a fast, simple [[Lossless data compression|lossless compression]] scheme for [[run-length encoding]] of data.
