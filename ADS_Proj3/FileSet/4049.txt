type of thinking because both men had the same probability of winning if they had not sold their tickets and the time differences in which they did will not increase or decrease these chances. - Similar results were found with plane crash survivors. These individuals experienced a greater amount of anticipatory regret when they engaged in the highly mutable action of switching flights last minute. It was reasoned that this was due to a person “anticipating counterfactual thoughts that a negative event was evoked, because it tends to make the event more vivid, and so tends to make it more subjectively likely” <ref>Gilovich p. 374</ref>. ==Implication in Real World Situations== This heuristic has shown to be a salient feature of [[clinical anxiety]] and its disorders, which are marked by elevated subjective [[probability]] judgments that future negative events will happen to the individual. A study done by [[David Raune]] and [[Andrew Macleod]] tried to tie the cognitive mechanisms that underlie this type of judgment to the simulation heuristic. - Their findings showed that anxious patient’s simulation heuristic scores were correlated with the subjective probability. Such that, the more reasons anxious patients could think of why negative events would happen, relative to the number why they would not happen, the higher their subjective probability judgment that the events would happen to them. Further it was found that anxious patients displayed increase access to the simulation compared to control patients. They also found support for the hypothesis that the easier it was for anxious patients to form the visual image, the greater the subjective probability that the event would happen to them. Through this work they purposed that the main clinical implication of the simulation heuristic results is that, in order to lower elevated subjective probability in clinical anxiety, patients should be encouraged to think of more reasons why the negative events will not occur then why they will occur . ==How it is Affected by other Heuristics== A study done by Philip Broemer was done to test the hypothesis that the subjective ease with which one can imagine a symptom will be affected by the impact of differently framed messages on attitudes toward performing health behaviors. By drawing on the simulation heuristic, he argued that the vividness of information is reflected in the subjective ease with which people can imagine having symptoms of an illness. - His results showed that the impact of message framing upon attitudes was moderated by the ease of imagination and clearly supported the congruency hypothesis for different kinds of health behavior. Finding that, negatively framed messages led to more positive attitudes when the recipients of these messages could easily imagine the relevant symptoms. Ease of imagination thus facilitates persuasion when messages emphasize potential health risks. A positive framing however, leads to more positive attitudes when symptom imagination was rather difficult. Therefore, a message with a reassuring theme is more congruent with a recipient’s state of mind when he or she cannot easily imagine the symptoms whereas a message with an aversive theme is more congruent with a recipient’s state of mind when he or she can easily imagine having the symptoms . ==See also== * [[Algorithm]] * [[Behavioral economics]] – an economic subfield with heuristics as one of its main arguments * [[List of cognitive biases]] * [[Problem solving]] * [[Representativeness heuristic]] ==Footnotes== {{Reflist}} ==References== * {{cite journal|last1=Bouts|first1=Patrick|last2=Spears|first2=Russell|last3=Van Der Pligt|first3=Joop|title=Counterfactual processing and the correspondence between events and outcomes: Normality versus value|doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420220407|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=1992|volume=22 |pages= 387–96 }} * {{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2tenQgAACAAJ | year=2001 | title=A dictionary of psychologyOxford Paperback Reference SeriesOxford reference online | first=Andrew M. | last=Colman | isbn=9780198662112 | publisher=Oxford University Press}} * {{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=m1O9PHDwfxAC | title=The Blackwell encyclopedia of social psychology | isbn=9780631202899 | year=1996 | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |chapter=Simulation Heuristic |last=Fiedler |first= Klaus}} * {{cite journal|last1=Raune|first1=David|last2=MacLeod|first2=Andrew|last3=Holmes|first3=Emily A.|title=The simulation heuristic and visual imagery in pessimism for future negative events in anxiety|doi=10.1002/cpp.455|journal=Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy|year=2005|volume=12 |pages= 313–25 }} * {{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FfTVDY-zrCoC |pages= 374–75 | title=Heuristics and biases: the psychology of intuitive judgement | first1=Thomas | last1=Gilovich | first2=Dale W. | last2=Griffin | first3=Daniel | last3=Kahneman | isbn=9780521796798 | year=2002 | publisher=Cambridge University Press}} * {{cite journal | last1=Broemer | first1=Philip | title=Ease of imagination moderates reactions to differently framed health messages | journal=European Journal of Social Psychology | volume=34 | pages=103 | year=2004 | doi=10.1002/ejsp.185 }} ==Further reading== * {{cite book |last=Goldman |first= Alvin I |title= Simulating Minds : The Philosophy, Psychology, and Neuroscience of Mindreading |year= 2006 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vsKpQ1An4hcC | isbn=9780195138924 | publisher=Oxford University Press US}} * {{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=m1O9PHDwfxAC | title=The Blackwell encyclopedia of social psychology | isbn=9780631202899 | year=1996 | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |last1=Hewstone |first1= M |last2=Manstead |first2= A.

It is a means to eliminate data duplication and to increase efficiency. SIS is frequently implemented in [[file system]]s, [[e-mail server]] software, [[data]] [[backup]] and other storage-related solutions. In the case of an e-mail server, single-instance storage would mean that a single copy of a message is held within its [[database]] whilst individual mailboxes access the content through a reference pointer. However there is a common misconception that the primary benefit of single instance storage in mail server solutions is a reduction in disk space requirements. The truth is that its primary benefit is to greatly enhance delivery efficiency of messages sent to large distribution lists. In a mail server scenario disk space savings from single instance storage are transient and drop off very quickly over time. When used in conjunction with a backup solution, single instance storage can reduce the quantity of [[archive]] media required since it avoids storing duplicate copies of the same file. Often identical files are installed on multiple computers,
