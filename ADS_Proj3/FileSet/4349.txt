</math> |} === Multi-dimensional table === [[Image:Rollup table.png|thumb|An example of a table containing rows with summary information. The summary information consists of subtotals that are combined from previous rows within the same column.]] The concept of '''dimension''' is also a part of basic terminology.<ref>The concept of "dimension" is often applied to tables in different contexts and with different meanings. For example, what is described as a "Simple Table" in this article is alternatively described as a "two dimensional array". This is distinct from "multi-dimensional table" as presented in this article.</ref> Any "simple" table can be represented as a "multi-dimensional" table by [[Database normalization|normalizing]] the data values into ordered [[hierarchies]]. A common example of such a table is a [[multiplication table]]. {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center" |+style="white-space:nowrap"| Multiplication table |- ! &times; !! 1 !! 2 !! 3 |- | 1 || 1 || 2 || 3 |- | 2 || 2 || 4 || 6 |- | 3 || 3 || 6 || 9 |} NOTE: Multidimensional tables, 2-dimensional as in the example, are created under the condition the coordinates or combination of the basic headers (margins) give a unique value attached. This is a [[injective function|injective relation]]: each combination of the values of the headers row (row 0, for lack of a better term) and the headers column (column O for lack of a better term) is related to a unique value represented on the table: * column 1 and row 1 will only correspond to the value 1 (and no other) * column 1 and row 2 will only correspond to the value 2 (and no other), etc. If the said condition is not present, it is required to insert extra columns or rows which increases the size of table with plenty of empty cells. To illustrate how a simple table can be transformed into a multi-dimensional table, consider the following transformation of the '''Age table'''. {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center" |+ Modified Age Table (names only) ! + !! 1 !! 2 !! 3 |- | Nancy || Nancy Davolio || Nancy Klondike || Nancy Obesanjo |- | Justin || Justin Saunders || Justin Timberland || Justin Daviolio |} This is structurally identical to the multiplication table, except it uses [[concatenation]] instead of [[multiplication]] as the [[operator (mathematics)|operator]]; and first name and last name instead of [[integers]] as the [[operands]]. === Wide and Narrow Tables === Tables can be described as wide or narrow in format. Wide format has a separate column for each data variable, a Narrow format will have one column for all the variable values and another column for the context of that value. See [[Wide and Narrow Data]]. ==Generic representation== As a communication tool, a table allows a form of [[generalization]] of information from an unlimited number of different social or scientific contexts. It provides a familiar way to convey information that might otherwise not be obvious or readily understood. For example, in the following diagram, two alternate representations of the same information are presented side by side. On the left is the NFPA 704 standard "[[fire diamond]]" with example values indicated and on the right is a simple table displaying the same values, along with additional information. Both representations convey essentially the same information, but the tabular representation is arguably more comprehensible to someone who is not familiar with the NFPA 704 standard. The tabular representation may not, however, be ideal for every circumstance (for example because of space limitations, or safety reasons). {| class="wikitable" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; text-align:center;" |+ [[Fire diamond]] |- | Standard Representation | Tabular Representation |- | style="text-align:center;"| {{NFPA 704 | Health = 3 | Flammability = 2 | Reactivity = 1}} | {| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center" |- |+style="white-space:nowrap"| Risk levels of hazardous materials in this facility |- ! Health Risk !! Flammability !! Reactivity !! Special |- | Level 3 || Level 2 || Level 1 || |} |} ==Specific uses== There are several specific situations in which tables are routinely used as a matter of custom or formal convention. ===Publishing === * Cross-reference ([[Table of contents]]) ===Mathematics=== * Arithmetic [[Multiplication table]] * Logic [[Truth table]] ===Natural sciences=== * Chemistry ([[Periodic table]]) * Oceanography ([[tide table]]) ===Information technology=== Tables are both supported by software applications and used in software development. ====Software applications ==== Modern software applications give users the ability to generate, format, and edit tables and tabular data for a wide variety of uses, for example: *[[word processing]] applications; *[[spreadsheet]] applications; *[[presentation software]]; *tables specified in [[HTML]] or another [[markup language]] ==== Software development ==== Tables have uses in software development for both high-level specification and low-level implementation.
