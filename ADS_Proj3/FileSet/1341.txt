McGraw-Hill Professional, 2002.ISBN 0071352945, 9780071352949</ref> ==Uses of emergency ultrasound== The primary uses of emergency ultrasound are determining the severity of fluid or trauma to the midsection, determining immediate trauma or penetration of the heart, and to process sources and extent of [[internal bleeding]]. Specific implementations vary, some areas use the German originated FAST SCAN system which focuses on fluids in the [[paracolic gutter]] and the Douglas and Morrison pouch. Others focus more on cardiac ultrasounds. ==Emergency ultrasound procedures== In most cases, EMT's will deploy a portable unit. In every instance, an attempt is made to find the area best suited to an ultrasound and utilize bare skin if possible. Resolution is vastly decreased if soundings must be made through any form of clothing.<ref>Robert Thomas.

The [[focused assessment with sonography for trauma|Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exam]] focuses on trying to ascertain if there is internal [[bodily fluid]] in blunt [[Blunt trauma|abdominal trauma]], in the areas between organs, which is a sign of severe internal injury.<ref>Introduction To Emergency Ultrasound: A Review Of Justifications, Indications And Significant Findings.

Both systems are scanning methodologies, they use identical equipment.<ref>Ma J, Mateer J, Ogata M. Prospective analysis of a rapid trauma ultrasound examination performed by emergency physicians. Journal of Medical Trauma. 1995 Vol. 38:879-885.</ref> ==Strengths of emergency sonography== # It images muscle, [[soft tissue]], and bone surfaces very well and is particularly useful for delineating the interfaces between solid and fluid-filled spaces, unlike most other methods of trauma diagnosis, which are little more than educated guesses. # It renders "live" images, where the operator can dynamically select the most useful section for review, and narrows down the problem area, rather than having to wait until the patient is at the hospital. # It has no known long-term [[adverse effect|side effect]]s and rarely causes any discomfort to the patient. ==Weaknesses of emergency sonography== # Sonographic devices have trouble penetrating bone. For example, sonography of the adult brain is very limited. This means that in terms of trauma diagnosis involving concussions, sonography will not work. # The depth penetration of ultrasound is limited, making it difficult to image structures deep in the body, especially in obese patients, which can be compounded by thick or obscuring clothing that can't be removed out of fear of harming the patient. # The method is operator-dependent. A high level of skill and experience is needed to acquire good-quality images and make accurate diagnoses, which is one more skill that a limited EMT team must develop. Since most EMT teams are small and suffer high turnover, retaining qualified personnel can be difficult. ==References== {{reflist}} ==See also== *[[Duplex ultrasonography]] {{Medical imaging}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Emergency Ultrasound}} [[Category:Medical imaging]]</text> </page> <page> <id>12046</id> <title>Emergent algorithm</title> <text>An '''emergent algorithm''' is an [[algorithm]] that has the following characteristics: * it achieves predictable [[global effect]]s * it does not require [[global visibility]] * it does not assume any kind of [[centralized control]] * it is self-stabilizing Emergence is said to arise from the cooperation of many simple processes, ie high-level behaviour resulting from low-level interaction of simpler building blocks. One example of emergent behaviour that has been studied over recent years is that of 'flocking'. In a 'flock of birds', the flock is a dynamic entity consisting of hundreds (or thousands) of individuals. The flock constantly changes shape and direction but maintains overall cohesion. Using cellular automata and treating each bird in the flock as an autonomous agent, with simple local rules controlling agent behaviour relative to closest neighbouring birds, a system can be constructed where the overall behaviour of the collective agents reflects the behaviour of the real flock.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Ruskin | first = Heather J. | last2 = Walshe | first2 = Ray | title = Emergent Computing - Introduction to the Special Theme | journal = ERCIM News | pages = 24–25 | volume = 64 | url = http://www.ercim.org/publication/Ercim_News/enw64/EN64.pdf | accessdate = 2009-02-18 | year = 2006}}</ref> Examples of emergent algorithms and models include [[cellular automata]]<ref>{{cite conference | first = Klaus A. | last = Brunner | coauthors = | title = What's emergent in Emergent Computing? | booktitle = Cybernetics and Systems 2002: Proceedings of the 16th European Meeting on Cybernetics and Systems Research | place = Vienna | pages = 189–192 | volume = 1 | url = http://klaus.e175.net/emcsr2002.pdf | accessdate = 2009-02-18 | year = 2002 }}</ref>, [[artificial neural networks]] and [[swarm intelligence]] systems ([[ant colony optimization]], [[bees algorithm]], etc.). == See also == * [[Emergence]] * [[Evolutionary computation]] * [[Genetic algorithm]] * [[Heuristic]] ==References== <references/> {{DEFAULTSORT:Emergent Algorithm}} [[Category:Emergence|Algorithm]] [[Category:Heuristics]] [[fr:Algorithme émergent]]</text> </page> <page> <id>12047</id> <title>Emergent democracy</title> <text>{{primarysources|date=November 2008}} {{Politics}} '''Emergent democracy''' refers to the rise of political structures and behaviors without central planning and by the action of many individual participants, especially when mediated by the Internet. More recently, [[Clay Shirky]] has referred to this as "[[Here Comes Everybody|the power of organizing without organizations]]."<ref>{{cite book | last = Shirky | first = Clay | authorlink = Clay Shirky | title = Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing Without Organizations | publisher = The Penguin Press HC | page= Subtitle | year = 2008 | isbn = 1594201536}}</ref> The term was coined to stand in contrast to more traditional forms of democracy, such as [[representational democracy]] and [[direct democracy]]. The phrase draws upon [[emergence]] theory for the idea that the simple actions of individuals can collectively create complex and unpredictable results, as when the behavior of [[termites]] results in large, efficient nests beyond the comprehension of any individual participant.
