Modern life has the traits of an autocatalytic set, since no particular molecule, nor any class of molecules, is able to replicate itself. There are several models based on autocatalytic sets, including those of [[Stuart Kauffman]] and others. ==Formal definition== Given a set M of [[molecule]]s, [[chemical reaction]]s can be roughly defined as pairs r=(A, B) of subsets from M. a<sub>1</sub> + a<sub>2</sub> + ... + a<sub>n</sub> → b<sub>1</sub> + b<sub>2</sub> + ... + b<sub>m</sub> Let R be the set of allowable reactions. A pair (M, R) is a ''reaction system'' (RS). A molecule m ∈ A ∩ B of a reaction r is a [[catalyst]] of this reaction. A RS is ''autocatalytic'', if all the catalysts for all its reactions are in M. The above definition is not sufficient to describe dependency on external resources or nutrients. This can be formulated by a [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] over a generating subset of M. Formally, cl(S) denotes the smallest subset Y of M that contains S such that for each reaction (A, B) A ⊆ S ∪ Y ⇒ B ⊆ Y A RS is ''generated'' (over some resources S), if all reactants A in its reactions are in cl(S) and none of the resources is a catalyst. A ''generated autocatalytic set'' is an RS that is both autocatalytic and generated. ==Probability that a random set is autocatalytic== Studies of the above model show that random RS can be autocatalytic with high probability under some assumptions. This comes from the fact that with a growing number of molecules, the number of possible reactions and catalysations grows even larger if the molecules grow in complexity, producing stochastically enough reactions and catalysations to make a part of the RS self-supported.{{Clarify|date=January 2011}} An autocatalytic set then extends very quickly with growing number of molecules for the same reason. These theoretical results make autocatalytic sets attractive for scientific explanation of the very early origin of life. ==Formal limitations== Formally, it is difficult to treat molecules as anything but unstructured entities, since the set of possible reactions (and molecules) would become infinite. Therefore, a derivation of arbitrarily long [[polymer]]s as needed to model DNA, RNA or proteins is not possible, yet. Studies of the [[RNA World]] suffer from the same problem. ==Linguistic aspects== Contrary to the above definition, which applies to the field of [[Artificial chemistry]], no agreed-upon notion of autocatalytic sets exists today. While above, the notion of catalyst is secondary insofar that only the set as a whole has to catalyse its own production, it is primary in other definitions, giving the term "Autocatalytic Set" a different emphasis. There, ''every'' reaction (or function, transformation) has to be mediated by a catalyst. As a consequence, while mediating its respective reaction, every catalyst ''denotes'' its reaction, too, resulting in a self denoting system, which is interesting for two reasons. First, real metabolism is structured in this manner. Second, self denoting systems can be considered as an intermediate step towards self describing systems. From both a structural and a natural historical point of view, one can identify the ACS as seized in the formal definition the more original concept, while in the second, the reflection of the system in itself is already brought to an explicit presentation, since catalysts represent the reaction induced by them. In ACS literature, both concept are present, but differently emphasised. To complete the classification from the other side, generalised self reproducing systems move beyond self-denotation. There, no unstructured entities carry the transformations anymore, but structured, described ones. Formally, a generalised self reproducing system consists of two function, u and c, together with their descriptions Desc(u) and Desc(c) along following definition: u : Desc(X) -> X c : Desc(X) -> Desc(X) where the function 'u' is the [[Universal Constructor|"universal" constructor]], that constructs everything in its domain from appropriate descriptions, while 'c' is a copy function for any description. Practically, 'u' and 'c' can fall apart into many subfunctions or catalysts. Note that the (trivial) copy function 'c' is necessary because though the universal constructor 'u' would be able to construct any description, too, the description it would base on, would in general be longer than the result, rendering full self replication impossible. This last concept can be attributed to [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]]'s work on [[Self-replication|self reproducing]] automata, where he holds a self description necessary for any non trivial (generalised) self reproducing system to avoid interferences. Von Neumann planned to design such a system for a model chemistry, too. ==Non-autonomous autocatalytic sets== Virtually all articles on autocatalytic sets leave open whether the sets are to be considered autonomous or not. Often, autonomy of the sets is silently assumed. Likely, the above context has a strong emphasis on autonomous self replication and early origin of life. But the concept of autocatalytic sets is really more general and in practical use in various technical areas, e.g. where self-sustaining tool chains are handled. Clearly, such sets are not autonomous and are objects of human agency. Examples of practical importance of non-autonomous autocatalytic sets can be found e.g. in the field of [[Bootstrapping (compilers)|compiler construction]] and in [[Self-hosting|operating systems]], where the self referential nature of the respective constructions is explicitly discussed, very often in terms of the [[chicken and egg]] problem. ==References== {{Reflist}} ==See also== *[[Autocatalytic reactions and order creation]] *[[Autopoiesis]] [[Category:Origin of life]] [[Category:Artificial life]] [[es:Conjunto autocatalítico]] [[it:Insieme autocatalitico]] [[sv:Autokatalytisk mängd]] [[tr:Otokatalitik küme]]</text> </page> <page> <id>2849</id> <title>Autodetection</title> <text>{{Unreferenced stub|auto=yes|date=December 2009}} {{Orphan|date=December 2009}} '''Autodetection''' is an automatic detection of a thing or situation.
