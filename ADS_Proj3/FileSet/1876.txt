A current widely used standard for the "buffer-to-computer" interface is 3.0 Gbit/s SATA, which can send about 300 megabyte/s from the buffer to the computer, and thus is still comfortably ahead of today's disk-to-buffer transfer rates. Data transfer rate (read/write) can be measured by writing a large file to disk using special file generator tools, then reading back the file. Transfer rate can be influenced by [[file system fragmentation]] and the layout of the files.<ref name="itworld-2001-04-18"/> The mechanical nature of hard disks introduces certain performance compromises. The manipulation of sequential data depends upon the rotational speed of the platters and the data recording density. Because heat and vibration limit rotational speed, advancing density becomes the sole method to improve sequential transfer rates.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} While these advances increase both storage capacity and performance, the performance gains are on a far slower curve than that of capacity improvement. ===Power consumption=== [[Power consumption]] has become increasingly important, not just in mobile devices such as laptops but also in server and desktop markets. Increasing data center machine density has led to problems delivering sufficient power to devices (especially for spin up), and getting rid of the waste heat subsequently produced, as well as environmental and electrical cost concerns (see [[green computing]]). Heat dissipation directly tied to power consumption, and as drive age, disk failure rates increase at higher drive temperatures.<ref name="xbit-2007-12-06"> {{ cite news |newspaper=Xbit Laboratories |title=Hard Disk Drive Power Consumption Measurements: X-bit’s Methodology |date=2007-12-06 |first=Oleg |last=Artamonov |url=http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/storage/display/hdd-power-cons.html
