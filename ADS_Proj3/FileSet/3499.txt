gave away the 'keys to the kingdom', and the intricacies of the phone system were at the disposal of anyone with a cursory knowledge of electronics. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The second generation of phreaks arose at this time, including the [[New York]]ers "[[Evan Doorbell]]", "[[Ben Decibel]]" and [[Neil R. Bell]] and [[Californians]] [[Mark Bernay]], [[Chris Bernay]], and "[[Alan from Canada]]". Each conducted their own independent exploration and experimentation of the telephone network, initially on an individual basis, and later within groups as they discovered each other in their travels. "Evan Doorbell", "Ben" and "Neil" formed a group of phreaks known as [[Group Bell]]. Mark Bernay initiated a similar group named the [[Mark Bernay Society]]. Both Mark and Evan received fame amongst today's phone phreakers for Internet publication of their collection of telephone exploration recordings. These recordings, conducted in the 60s, 70s, and early 80s are available at Mark's website ''Phone Trips.''<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.wideweb.com/phonetrips |title = Phone Trips |accessdate = 2008-06-21}}</ref> ===Blue boxes=== {{Main|Blue box}} In October 1971, phreaking was introduced to the masses when [[Esquire Magazine]] published a story called "Secrets of the Little Blue Box"<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.lospadres.info/thorg/lbb.html |title = Secrets of the Little Blue Box |accessdate = 2010-09-04}}</ref> by [[Ron Rosenbaum]]. This article featured Engressia and John Draper prominently, synonymising their names with phreaking. The article also attracted the interest of other soon-to-be phreaks, such as [[Steve Wozniak]] and [[Steve Jobs]], who went on to found [[Apple Computer]]<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.woz.org/letters/general/03.html |title = Welcome to Woz.org |accessdate = 2008-06-21}}</ref>. 1971 also saw the beginnings of YIPL (Youth International Party Line), a publication started by [[Abbie Hoffman]] and Al Bell to provide information to [[Yippies]] on how to "beat the man," mostly involving telephones. In 1973, Al Bell would move YIPL over and start TAP (Technology Assistance Program). TAP would develop into a major source for subversive technical information among phreaks and hackers all over the world. TAP ran from 1973 to 1984, with Al Bell handing over the magazine to "Tom Edison" in the late 70's. TAP ended publication in 1984 due mostly to a break-in and arson at Tom Edison's residence in 1983<ref>{{cite web|url = http://cheshirecatalyst.com/tap.html |title = Cheshire's Book - TAP.HTML |accessdate = 2008-06-21}}</ref>. Cheshire Catalyst then took over running the magazine for its final (1984) year. A controversially suppressed article "How to Build a 'Phone Phreaks' box" in [[Ramparts Magazine]] (June, 1972) touched off a firestorm of interest in phreaking. This article published simple schematic plans of a "black box" used to receive free long distance phone calls, and included a very short parts list that could be used to construct one. Bell sued Ramparts which forced the magazine to pull all copies from shelves, but not before numerous copies were sold and many regular subscribers received them. ===Computer hacking=== {{Main|Computer hacking}} In the 1980s, the revolution of the [[personal computer]] and the popularity of computer [[bulletin board systems]] (accessed via [[modem]]) created an influx of tech-savvy users. These [[bulletin board systems|BBSes]] became popular for computer [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] and others interested in the technology, and served as a medium for previously scattered independent phone phreaks to share their discoveries and experiments. This not only led to unprecedented collaboration between phone phreaks, but also spread the notion of phreaking to others who took it upon themselves to study, experiment with, or exploit the telephone system. This was also at a time when the telephone company was a popular subject of discussion in the US, as the [[monopoly]] [[AT&T]] was forced into divestiture. During this time, phreaking lost its label for being the exploration of the telephone network, and began to focus more on toll fraud. Computer hackers began to use phreaking methods to find the telephone numbers for modems belonging to businesses, which they could later exploit. Groups then formed around the BBS hacker/phreaking (H/P) community such as the famous [[Masters of Deception]] ([[Phiber Optik]]) and [[Legion of Doom (hacking)|Legion of Doom]] ([[Erik Bloodaxe (hacker)|Erik Bloodaxe]]) groups. In 1985 an underground e-zine called [[Phrack]] (a combination of the words Phreak and Hack) began circulation among BBSes, and focused on hacking, phreaking, and other related technological subjects. In the early 1990s H/P groups like Masters of Deception and Legion of Doom were shut down by the [[US Secret Service]]'s [[Operation Sundevil]]. Phreaking as a subculture saw a brief dispersion in fear of criminal prosecution in the 1990s, before the popularity of the [[internet]] initiated a reemergence of phreaking as a subculture in the US and spread phreaking to international levels. Into the turn of the 21st century, phreaks began to focus on the exploration and playing with the network, and the concept of toll fraud became widely frowned on among serious phreakers, primarily under the influence of the website Phone Trips, put up by second generation phreaks [[Mark Bernay]] and [[Evan Doorbell]]. ====Toll fraud==== The [[Bell System divestiture|1984 AT&T breakup]] gave rise to many small companies intent upon competing in the long distance market. These included the then-fledgling [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]] and [[MCI Inc.|MCI]], both of whom had only recently entered the marketplace. At the time, there was no way to switch a phone line to have calls automatically carried by non-AT&T companies. Customers of these small long distance operations would be required to dial a local access number, enter their calling card number, and finally enter the area code and phone number they wish to call. Because of the relatively lengthy process for customers to complete a call, the companies kept the calling card numbers short &ndash; usually 6 or 7 digits. This opened up a huge vulnerability to phone phreaks with a computer. 6-digit calling card numbers only offer 1 million combinations. 7-digit numbers offer just 10 million. If a company had 10,000 customers, a person attempting to "guess" a card number would have a good chance of doing so correctly once every 100 tries for a 6-digit card and once every 1000 tries for a 7-digit card. While this is almost easy enough
