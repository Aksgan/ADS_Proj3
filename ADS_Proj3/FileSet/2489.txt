He is an internationally known scholar, focused on computational biology, knowledge-driven extraction of information from the primary biomedical literature, the semantic integration of knowledge resources in molecular biology, and the use of knowledge in the analysis of high-throughput data, as well as for his foundational work in computational biology, which led to the genesis of the major professional organization in the field and two international conferences.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=A pioneer with personality: Larry Hunter, founder of the International Society for Computational Biology |journal=Bioinformatics World |month=Autumn |year=2002 |pages=6}}</ref> ==Career== Hunter completed his Ph.D. at Yale University in 1989, ''Knowledge Acquisition Planning: Gaining Expertise Through Experience'', on diagnosis of lung cancer from x-ray data, under the guidance of [[Roger Schank]]. Faced with a choice between careers in the main applications of artificial intelligence---game programming and defense work—Hunter chose to create a new discipline, [[bioinformatics]]. From 1989 to 2000, Hunter worked as a computer scientist and section chief for National Institutes of Health sections devoted to statistical and bioinformatic research. He was an adjunct faculty member at George Mason University from 1991 through 2000 and an associate professor in the University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine from 2000 to 2008. He was promoted to professor in 2008.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Processes of life: An introduction to molecular biology |publisher=MIT Press}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> ==Organizational work== ===ISCB=== In 1997, Hunter founded what has become the largest professional organization in [[computational biology]] and [[bioinformatics]], the [[International Society for Computational Biology|International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB)]].<ref>Proceedings of Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology, 1998{{Verify source|if this is a journal article, what's the title; who's the author?|date=May 2010}}</ref> ===Conferences=== Hunter was also a founder of three successful international conferences in bioinformatics, the International Conference on [[Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology]] and the [[Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing]]<ref>Proceedings of the Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing, 1996{{Verify source|if this is a journal article, what's the title; who's the author?|date=May 2010}}</ref> and the [http://www.iscb.org/rocky09 Rocky Mountain Bioinformatics Conference]. Hunter cofounded and was a member of the Board of Directors of the Molecular Mining Corporation from 1997 to 2003. Hunter is a Fellow of the [[American College of Medical Informatics]] and the winner of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence’s 2003 Engelmore Prize for Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence. ==Influence== Hunter is credited with being one of the founding fathers of [[bioinformatics]]. Throughout his career Hunter has researched and directed research groups investigating the development and application of advanced computational techniques for biomedicine to high-throughput assays, particularly the application of statistical and knowledge-based techniques to the analysis of high-throughput data and of biomedical texts. He has proposed neurobiologically and evolutionarily informed computational models of cognition, and ethical issues related to computational bioscience. ==Works== * [http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=11776 The Processes of Life: An Introduction to Molecular Biology] *{{Cite journal|author=Rindflesch TC, Tanabe L, Weinstein JN, Hunter L |title=EDGAR: extraction of drugs, genes and relations from the biomedical literature |journal=Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing |volume= |issue= |pages=517–28 |year=2000 |pmid=10902199 |pmc=2709525}} *{{Cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0140525X00051578 |title=Transcending inductive category formation in learning |year=2010 |last1=Schank |first1=Roger C. |last2=Collins |first2=Gregg C. |last3=Hunter |first3=Lawrence E. |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=9 |pages=639}} *{{Cite journal|doi=10.3115/974147.974173 |title=Extracting molecular binding relationships from biomedical text |year=2000 |last1=Rindflesch |first1=Thomas C. |last2=Rajan |first2=Jayant V. |last3=Hunter |first3=Lawrence |pages=188}} * [http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=5vo9zMJRnMwC&oi=fnd&pg=PA41&dq=Lawrence+Hunter&ots=-KkAjqOrvB&sig=VfZ99bcLHtGCtR8KJUdD9RAZE94#v=onepage&q=Lawrence%20Hunter&f=false Planning to learn] The Proceedings of The Twelfth Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society, Boston, MA., July 1990, pp. 26–34, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Hillsdale, NJ. *{{Cite journal|author=Hunter L, Cohen KB |title=Biomedical language processing: what's beyond PubMed? |journal=Molecular Cell |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=589–94 |year=2006 |month=March |pmid=16507357 |pmc=1702322 |doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2006.02.012}} *{{Cite book|author=Hunter, Lawrence |title=Artificial intelligence and molecular biology |publisher=AAAI Press |location=Menlo Park, Calif |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=0-262-58115-9}} *{{Cite journal|author=Baumgartner WA, Cohen KB, Fox LM, Acquaah-Mensah G, Hunter L |title=Manual curation is not sufficient for annotation of genomic databases |journal=Bioinformatics |volume=23 |issue=13 |pages=i41–8 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17646325 |pmc=2516305 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btm229}} *{{Cite journal|doi=10.1186/1471-2105-9-78 |title=OpenDMAP: An open source, ontology-driven concept analysis engine, with applications to capturing knowledge regarding protein transport, protein interactions and cell-type-specific gene expression |year=2008 |last1=Hunter |first1=Lawrence |last2=Lu |first2=Zhiyong |last3=Firby |first3=James |last4=Baumgartner |first4=William A |last5=Johnson |first5=Helen L |last6=Ogren |first6=Philip V |last7=Cohen |first7=K Bretonnel |journal=BMC Bioinformatics |volume=9 |pages=78 |pmid=18237434 |pmc=2275248}} *{{Cite journal|author=Leach SM, Tipney H, Feng W, ''et al.'' |title=Biomedical discovery acceleration, with applications to craniofacial development |journal=PLoS Computational Biology |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=e1000215 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19325874 |pmc=2653649 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000215}} ==External links== * [http://compbio.ucdenver.edu/hunter/ Hunter's web page] ==References== {{Reflist}} <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]] --> {{Persondata |NAME= Hunter, Lawrence E. |ALTERNATIVE NAMES=Larry Hunter |SHORT DESCRIPTION= [[Computational Biology]] |DATE OF BIRTH= January 18, 1961 |PLACE OF BIRTH=[[United States]] |DATE OF DEATH= |PLACE OF DEATH= }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Hunter, Lawrence}} [[Category:1961 births]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:Artificial intelligence researchers]] [[Category:Bioinformaticians]] [[Category:Fellows of the International Society for Computational Biology]]</text> </page> <page> <id>21271</id> <title>Lawrence J.
