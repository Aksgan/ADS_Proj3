It contains most of the features of the professional version but with fewer and simpler options. The program allows users to create, edit, organize and share images, all from the same product. Originally introduced alongside Photoshop version 7, Photoshop Elements targets photography enthusiasts and thus lacks many features that make it useful in a proper print production environment. For example, Photoshop Elements cannot export files in the [[CMYK]] color mode (without using a third-party plug-in), supports a simplified color management system, and excludes detailed soft-proofing. It also either eliminates completely or offers simplified versions of some of the more powerful plug-ins, and instead has a number of features aimed at non-experts (such as removing the [[red-eye effect]] or changing the skin tone in a picture). An example of a redesigned feature would be the Variations correction dialog. Some versions can, however, open, edit, and save [[PDF]]s. Photoshop LE (Limited Edition) was Adobe's consumer raster image editing product prior to the introduction of Elements. Photoshop LE had similar limitations to ''Elements''. Adobe has also released a new free image editing web application, [[Adobe Photoshop Express]], with many more limitations than Adobe Photoshop Elements. ==Versions== {| class="wikitable" ! Version !!
