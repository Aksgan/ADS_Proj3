He grew up in [[San Francisco, California]], and attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[EECS|Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences]] in 1971. == Work with Nolan Bushnell == He worked for the video pioneering company [[Ampex]], where he met [[Ted Dabney]] and several other people that would end up being constants through the [[Atari, Inc]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], Cyan Engineering and [[Pizza Time Theater]] companies. Alcorn was the designer of the [[video arcade]] game ''[[Pong]]'', creating it under the direction of [[Nolan Bushnell|Bushnell]] and Dabney. Pong was a hit in the 1970s. In addition to direct involvement with all the breakout Atari products, such as the [[Atari 2600]], Alcorn was involved at some of the historic meetings of [[Steve Wozniak]] and [[Steve Jobs]] (at that time an Atari employee) presenting their [[Apple I]] prototype. ==After Atari== After Alcorn left Atari in 1981, he consulted to many fledging companies in [[Silicon Valley]], especially involved in the startups of [[Catalyst Technologies]], one of the first technology company incubators, created by Nolan Bushnell and other ex-Atari leaders. Alcorn was involved in several of the startups directly, including [[Cumma (game system)|Cumma]], a re-programmable video game cartridge/kiosk system (and precursor to the similar [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo Geo]] system), and an advisor to [[Etak]], one of the first practical, [[in-car navigation]] systems. Alcorn later became an Apple Fellow, and led and consulted to a variety of startups during the tech boom. In 1998, Alcorn co-founded [[Zowie Intertainment]], a spinoff from [[Interval Research]]. There he developed a child's [[playset]] with a location system that allowed a [[personal computer|PC]] to respond to the child's play. == External links == * [http://www.thedoteaters.com/stage2.php The Dot Eaters entry] on Al Alcorn, PONG and Atari * [http://www.podtech.net/?p=881 short interview about his early involvement with Steve Jobs and Apple] * [http://www.gamearena.com.au/videos/latest.php/bigpond-gamearena-al-alcorn-pong-feature Video interview with Al posted on March 10 2008 discussing the origins of Pong and more.] {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME = Alcorn, Allan | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH = | PLACE OF BIRTH = | DATE OF DEATH = | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Alcorn, Allan}} [[Category:Video game programmers]] [[Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:American computer scientists]] [[Category:American electrical engineers]] [[it:Allan Alcorn]]</text> </page> <page> <id>1509</id> <title>Allan Wells</title> <text>{{Lead too short|date=March 2009}} {{BLP sources|date=August 2008}} {{MedalTableTop}} {{MedalSport | Men's [[Athletics (sport)|Athletics]]}} {{MedalCountry | {{GBR2}} }} {{MedalCompetition|[[Olympic Games]]}} {{MedalGold|[[1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Moscow]]|[[Athletics at the 1980 Summer Olympics|100 metres]]}} {{MedalSilver|[[1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Moscow]]|[[Athletics at the 1980 Summer Olympics|200 metres]]}} {{MedalCompetition|[[IAAF World Cup]]}} {{MedalGold|[[1981 World Cup|1981 Rome]]|100 m}} {{MedalSilver|[[1981 World Cup|1981 Rome]]|200 m}} {{MedalCompetition|[[IAAF Golden Sprints]]}} {{MedalGold|[[1981 Golden Sprints|1981 Berlin]]|Sprints}} {{MedalSilver|[[1979 Golden Sprints|1979 Zurich]]|Sprints}} {{MedalCompetition|[[Euro Cup Semi]]}} {{MedalGold|[[1981 Euro Cup Semi|1981 Helsinki]]|100m}} {{MedalGold|[[1981 Euro Cup Semi|1981 Helsinki]]|200m}} {{MedalCompetition|[[European Cup (athletics)|European Cup]]}} {{MedalGold|[[1979 European Cup in Athletics|1979 Turin]]|200 m}} {{MedalGold|[[1981 European Cup in Athletics|1981 Zagreb]]|100 m}} {{MedalGold|[[1983 European Cup in Athletics|1983 London]]|200 m}} {{MedalSilver|[[1981 European Cup in Athletics|1981 Zagreb]]|200 m}} {{MedalSilver|[[1983 European Cup in Athletics|1983 London]]|100 m}} {{MedalBronze|[[1979 European Cup in Athletics|1979 Turin]]|100 m}} {{MedalCountry | {{SCO}} }} {{MedalCompetition|[[Commonwealth Games]]}} {{MedalGold|[[1978 Commonwealth Games|1978 Edmonton]]|200 m}} {{MedalGold|[[1978 Commonwealth Games|1978 Edmonton]]|4x100 m}} {{MedalGold|[[1982 Commonwealth Games|1982 Brisbane]]|100 m}} {{MedalGold|[[1982 Commonwealth Games|1982 Brisbane]]|200 m}} {{MedalSilver|[[1978 Commonwealth Games|1978 Edmonton]]|100 m}} {{MedalBronze|[[1982 Commonwealth Games|1982 Brisbane]]|4x100 m}} {{MedalCompetition|[[1980 Germany Meeting]]}} {{MedalGold|[[1980 Koblenz Germany Meeting|1980 Koblenz]]|100m}} {{MedalCompetition|[[1981 Van Damme Memorial Meeting]]}} {{MedalGold|[[1981 Van Damme Memorial Games|1981 Brussels]]|200m}} {{MedalCompetition|[[1981 Bislett Games]]}} {{MedalSilver|[[1981 Bislett Games|1981 Bislett]]|200m}} {{MedalCompetition|[[AAA's Championships]]}} {{MedalGold|[[1980 AAA's]]|100m}} {{MedalGold|[[1977 AAA's]]|60m}} {{MedalSilver|[[1976 AAA's]]|100m}} {{MedalSilver|[[1983 AAA's]]|100m}} {{MedalBronze|[[1987 AAA's]]|100m}} {{MedalCompetition|[[UK Championships in Athletics|UK Championships]]}} {{MedalGold|[[1978 Edinburgh]]|100m}} {{MedalGold|[[1978 Edinburgh]]|200m}} {{MedalBottom}} '''Allan Wipper Wells''' <small>[[MBE]]</small> (born 3 May 1952) is a former [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[athletics (sport)|athlete]], who became [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] Champion in the [[100 metres]] at the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]].<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0026/</ref> ==Biography== Born in [[Edinburgh]], Wells was educated at [[Liberton High School]]. Wells, initially a [[triple jump]]er and [[long jump]]er and crowned Scottish indoor [[Long Jump]] champion in 1974, began concentrating on [[Sprint (running)|sprint]] events in 1976. In 1977 he won the [[Amateur Athletic Association|AAA]]'s Indoor [[60 metres]] title, and won his first of seven outdoor Scottish sprint titles. Wells's big breakthrough came at the start of the 1978 season, when his times and victories began to improve, and he won the UK 100/[[200 metres|200]] Championships. British sprinters had made little impression on the international scene, and the sight of the [[Scot]] winning two [[gold medal]]s (200 m, [[4 x 100 metres relay|4 x 100 m]]), and a [[silver medal|silver]] (100 m) at the [[Commonwealth Games]] in [[Edmonton, Alberta]], [[Canada]], was a surprise for British athletics fans. This success continued in 1979, when he won the European Cup 200 metres in [[Turin]], Italy, beating the new World record holder [[Pietro Mennea]] on his home ground; he also finished 3rd in the 100 metres. At the start of the 1980 season, Wells won the AAA's 100 metres, then went to the [[CÃ´te d'Azur]] to finish preparing for the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games. Wells never used starting blocks, until a rule change forced him to do so for the Moscow Olympics. In Moscow, Wells qualified for the final, with a new British record 10.11 s, where he faced pre-race favourite [[Silvio Leonard]] of [[Cuba]]. By 60 metres the field were fading, and by 80 metres the race was
