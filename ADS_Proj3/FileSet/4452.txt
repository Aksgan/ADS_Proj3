Writers Advantage. ISBN 0595274900 / ISBN 978-0595274901 (a work of fiction) * In ''[[The Wheel of Darkness]]'' by [[Douglas Preston]] and [[Lincoln Child]], a tulpa is created. * In [[Warren Ellis]]'s ''[[Doktor Sleepless]]'' the title character creates a Tulpa of himself allowing for one to be imprisoned while the other goes free. *Alvin Schwartz, writer of Superman comics during the '40s and '50s, writes in his book, ''An Unlikely Prophet'' about a tulpa he meets, named Thongden. The tulpa educates Schwartz about his own tulpa, Superman. ISBN 0965952126 and ISBN 978-0965952125 *Starting in July 1989, [[Alan Grant (writer)]] wrote a story arc for [[Batman]] entitled "Tulpa", in which a Tibetan man creates entities to steal for him in order to repay a mob boss. * In the ''[[Fables (Vertigo)|Fables]]'' series of graphic novels by [[Bill Willingham]], the lifespan/health/vitality of each of the "Fable" characters (i.e., Snow White, Goldilocks, etc...) is directly tied into the degree of popularity or belief that real "mundy" (mundane) humans have in them, implying that they are willed into existence by the thoughts of humans. ===Games=== *In the [[role-playing game]] ''Over the Edge'', tulpas are used as background characters (NPC's). They also have natural enemies, sociopathic individuals called "Sandmen", who prey on them to create either "Nightmare" (a drug) or "Dreamweb" (gossamer webs that can capture dreams from people). Dreamweb are typically used to capture the nightmares of neurotic individuals, which are also sold as something like a drug. *Although the word "Tulpa" is never used in the ''Changeling: the Dreaming'' RPG, creatures known as "Chimera" fulfill a role very similar to Tulpa. Chimera may be sentient or non-sentient entities made manifest in the mental alternate reality of "The Dreaming". They typically arise spontaneously due to the force of human thought and emotion, sometimes from the dreams of individuals but potentially as amalgams of all human thought. These beings are typically weakened by exposure to human doubt, but nevertheless some have the necessary strength and abilities to manifest as tangible entities in the mundane world of humans, at least for a time. *In the [[alternate reality game]] ''The Hunt for Sammex83'', it is said that the Sammex83 is a tulpa that lives in both the Internet and the real world. == See also == * [[Bardo]] * [[Dream yoga]] * [[Egregore]] * [[Golem]] * [[Imaginary friend]] * [[Philosophy of mind]] ==Notes== {{reflist}} ==References== * Bailey, Alice (1951).
