levels of the matrix. A second set of vertical "hold" bars is set at right angles to the first (hence the name, "crossbar") and also operated by electromagnets. The select bars carry spring-loaded [[wire]] fingers that enable the hold bars to operate the contacts beneath the bars. When the select and then the hold electromagnets operate in sequence to move the bars, they trap one of the spring fingers to close the contacts beneath the point where two bars cross. This then makes the connection through the switch as part of setting up a calling path through the exchange.Â Once connected, the select magnet is then released so it can use its other fingers for other connections, while the hold magnet remains energized for the duration of the call to maintain the connection. The crossbar switching interface was referred to as the [[TXK]] or TXC switch (''T''elephone e''X''change ''C''rossbar) - in the UK. [[Image:Crossbar-hy1.jpg|left|thumb|Western Electric 100 Point six-wire Type B crossbar switch]] The [[Bell System]] ''Type B'' crossbar switch of the 1960s was made in the largest quantity. The majority were 200 point switches, with twenty verticals and ten levels of three wires, but this example is a 100 point six wire switch. Each select bar carries ten fingers so any of the ten circuits assigned to the ten verticals can connect to either of two levels. Five select bars, each able to rotate up or down, mean a choice of ten links to the next stage of switching. Each crosspoint in this particular model connected six wires. Note the ''Vertical Off-Normal'' contacts next to the hold magnets, lined up along the bottom of the switch. They perform logic and memory functions, and the hold bar keeps them in the active position as long as the connection is up. The ''Horizontal Off Normals'' on the sides of the switch are activated by the horizontal bars when the "butterfly magnets" rotate them. This only happens while the connection is being set up, since the butterflies are only energized then. [[Image:Crossbar-mini-hy2.jpg|thumb|Late-model Western Electric crossbar switch]] [[File:C Xbr sw HON jeh.jpg|thumb|upright|Back of Type C]] The majority of Bell System switches were made to connect three wires including the [[tip and ring]] of a [[balanced pair]] circuit and a sleeve lead for control. Many connected six wires, either for two distinct circuits or for a [[four wire circuit]] or other complex connection. The Bell System ''Type C'' miniature crossbar of the 1970s was similar, but the fingers projected forward from the back and the select bars held paddles to move them. The majority of type C had twelve levels; these were the less common ten level ones. The [[Northern Electric]] ''Minibar'' used in [[SP1 switch]] was similar but even smaller. The ITT Pentaconta Multiswitch of the same era had usually 22 verticals, 26 levels, and six to twelve wires. Ericsson crossbar switches sometimes had only five verticals. ===Electromechanical/instrumentation=== For instrumentation use, James Cunningham, Son and Company [http://www.obs-us.com/people/karen/cunningham/chapter6.htm#47] made high-speed, very-long-life crossbar switches [http://www.obs-us.com/people/karen/cunningham/47.htm] with physically-small mechanical parts which permitted faster operation than telephone-type crossbar switches. Many of their switches had the mechanical Boolean AND function of telephony crossbar switches, but other models had individual relays (one coil per crosspoint) in matrix arrays, connecting the relay contacts to [x] and [y] buses. These latter types were equivalent to separate relays; there was no logical AND function built in. Cunningham crossbar switches had precious-metal contacts capable of handling millivolt signals. ===Telephone exchange=== Early crossbar exchanges were divided into an originating side and a terminating side, while the later and prominent Canadian and US [[SP1 switch]] and [[5XB switch]] were not. When a user picked up the [[telephone]] handset, the resulting line loop operating the user's line relay caused the exchange to connect the user's telephone to an originating sender, which returned the user a dial tone. The sender then recorded the dialed digits and passed them to the originating marker, which selected an outgoing trunk and operated the various crossbar switch stages to connect the calling user to it. The originating marker then passed the trunk call completion requirements (type of pulsing, resistance of the trunk, etc) and the called party's details to the sender and released. The sender then relayed this information to a terminating sender (which could be on either the same or a different exchange). This sender then used a terminating marker to connect the calling user, via the selected incoming trunk, to the called user, and caused the controlling relay set to pass intermittent ring voltage of about 90 VAC at 20 [[hertz|Hz]] to ring the called user's phone bell, and return ringing tone to the caller. The crossbar switch itself was simple: exchange design moved all the logical decision-making to the [[common control]] elements, which as relay sets were themselves very reliable. The design criterion was to have two hours of "downtime" for service every forty years, which was a huge improvement on earlier electromechanical systems. The exchange design concept lent itself to incremental upgrades, as the control elements could be replaced separately from the call switching elements. The minimum size of a crossbar exchange was comparatively large, but in city areas with a large installed line capacity the whole exchange occupied less space than other exchange technologies of equivalent capacity. For this reason they were also typically the first switches to be replaced with [[digital]] systems, which were even smaller and more reliable. Two principles of using crossbar switches were used. One early method was based on the selector principle, and used the switches as functional replacement for [[Strowger switch|Strowger]] or [[stepping switch]]es. Control was distributed to the switches themselves. Call establishment progressed through the exchange stage by stage, as successive digits were dialed. With the selector principle, each switch could only handle its portion of one call at a time. Each moving contact of the array was multipled <!-- No "i" in this switchbank wiring technical term--> to corresponding crosspoints on other switches to a selector in the next bank
