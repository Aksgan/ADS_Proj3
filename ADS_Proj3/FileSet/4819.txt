additional [[user interfaces|Windows shell replacement]] exist. Other GUIs include [[LiteStep]], [[bbLean]] and [[Program Manager]]. The GUI provides a means to control the placement and appearance of individual application windows, and interacts with the Window System. ==See also== *[[Comparison of operating systems]] *[[Architecture of Windows 9x]] ==References== {{Reflist|2}} ==Further reading== {{Wikiversity|at=Operating Systems/Windows|DOS Integrated}} {{Wikibooks|Basic Computing Using Windows/Appendices/Dual Booting}} {{Sisterlinks}} {{History of Windows}} {{Operating system}} [[Category:Computing platforms]] [[Category:Microsoft Windows]] [[Category:Discontinued versions of Microsoft Windows]] [[Category:Criticisms of software and websites]] [[da:Windows 9x]] [[de:Windows 9x]] [[es:Windows 9x]] [[fr:Windows 9x]] [[ko:윈도 9x]] [[id:Windows 9x]] [[it:Windows 9x]] [[he:Microsoft Windows 9x]] [[ms:Windows 9x]] [[nl:Windows 9x]] [[ja:Windows 9x系]] [[pl:Windows 9x]] [[pt:Windows 9x]] [[ro:Windows 9x]] [[ru:Windows 9x]] [[sk:Windows 9x]] [[sr:Виндоуз 9x]] [[sv:Windows 9x]] [[zh:Windows 9x]]</text> </page> <page> <id>40255</id> <title>Windows CE 5.0</title> <text>{{Infobox_OS | name = Windows CE 5.0 | | logo =<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Windows CE.png|220px|Windows CE brand logo]] -->| developer = [[Microsoft]] | family = [[Windows CE]] | source_model = [[Shared source]] | working_state = Current | latest_release_version = CE 5.2.19202 | latest_release_date = | kernel_type = [[Embedded system|Embedded]] | license = Microsoft EULA | }} {{Context|date=October 2009}} '''Windows CE 5.0''' (codenamed ''"Macallan"'')<ref>{{cite web | last = Tilley | first = Chris | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The History of Windows CE | work = | publisher = [[HPC:Factor]] | date = 2001-02-18 | url = http://www.hpcfactor.com/qlink/?linkID=20 | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2009-07-28 }}</ref> is a successor to [[Windows CE]] 4.2, the third release in the Windows CE [[Microsoft .NET|.NET]] family. [[File:Wince50.PNG|thumb|right|Windows CE 5.0 Screenshot]] It was first released on July 09, 2004. Like its predecessors Windows CE 5.0 is marketed towards the embedded device market and independent device vendors. Windows CE 5.0 is billed as a low-cost, compact, fast-to-market, [[Real-time operating system|real-time]] [[operating system]] available for [[x86 architecture|x86]], [[ARM architecture|ARM]], [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], and [[SuperH]] [[microprocessor]]-based systems. Windows CE 5.0 builds on previous Windows CE releases in its adoption of [[shared source]]. Since 2001, Microsoft has been steadily expanding the available Windows CE source tree with embedded system developers. Windows CE 5.0 is the most open Microsoft Operating System to date, though not all of the system is available under shared source agreements. Developers have the freedom to modify down to the kernel level, without the need to share their changes with Microsoft or competitors. On the x86 platform, Windows CE 5.0 competes against Microsoft's other embedded Operating Systems, [[Windows XP Embedded]] and its predecessor [[Windows NT Embedded]]. Platform Builder IDE for Windows CE 5.0 is the last builder tool, available as standalone product. ==Windows CE vs. Windows XP Embedded== According to Microsoft, Windows CE is a preferable choice to [[Windows XP Embedded]] in situations where demanding wireless and multimedia requirements need to be met. The following are the primary considerations for “choosing the right version”: * '''CPU architecture''': Windows CE supports an extensive array of architectures, including [[x86]], whereas Windows XP Embedded only supports the x86 architecture. * '''Real-time applications''': Windows CE is a [[real-time operating system]], while Windows XP Embedded is not by default. * '''Existing Win32 applications''': Windows CE cannot use Win32 binaries, libraries, and drivers without modification. * '''Memory footprint''': The minimum footprint of Windows CE is 350 kilo[[bytes]]. The minimum footprint of Windows XP Embedded is 8 megabytes, making it over 23 times larger. Also consider that Windows CE licensing starts at $3 or €1.25 per device for the Core SKU, while XP Embedded is $90 or €59 per unit shipped. ==References== <references/> {{No footnotes|date=August 2008}} * {{cite web|title=Which to Choose: Evaluating Microsoft Windows CE .NET and Windows XP Embedded|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|date=September [[2003]]|url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/d/a/d/dad198e1-920f-4579-8c0b-fb1b967e107d/choose.doc}} * {{cite web|title=Portable CE 5.0|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/smakofsky/archive/2004/12/20/328001.aspx}} ==See also== * [[Handheld PC]] * [[Palm-Size PC]] * [[Pocket PC]] * [[Personal Digital Assistant]] * [[Windows Mobile]] {{History_of_Windows}} [[Category:Windows CE]] [[az:Windows CE 5.0]] [[ru:Windows CE 5.0]]</text> </page> <page> <id>40263</id> <title>Windows Driver Foundation</title> <text>{{Infobox Software | name = Windows Driver Foundation | logo = | screenshot = | caption = | author = | developer = [[Microsoft]] | released = | latest release version = 1.9 | latest release date = | latest preview version = | latest preview date = | operating system = [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] | platform = | language = [[English language|English]] | status = Active | genre = | license = | website = }} '''Windows Driver Foundation''' (WDF) is a set of Microsoft tools that aid in the creation of device drivers for [[Windows 2000]] and later versions of Windows. The primary tools that comprise WDF are the Kernel Mode Driver Framework (KMDF) and User Mode Driver Framework (UMDF). These tool kits provide a new, object-oriented, programming model for Windows driver development. The primary goal of the Frameworks is "Conceptual Scalability", that is the characteristics of only requiring a driver developer to learn a few simple concepts to be able to write a simple driver, and to be able to incrementally learn more when more complex driver features are required. This differs markedly from the Windows Driver Model (WDM) that requires driver developers to be fully familiar with many complex technical details before writing even a simple driver. Part of the key to achieving Conceptual Scalability is that KMDF and UMDF use an "opt-in" model. This model allows the developer to extend and override the default behavior of a canonical "good driver". This is in contrast to the older [[Windows Driver Model]] that depends on the driver writer to implement all aspects of the driver's behavior. ==Varieties== The Framework comes in two varieties: * The [[Kernel-Mode Driver Framework]], for writing standard kernel-mode device drivers. * The [[User-Mode Driver Framework]], for writing certain classes of driver that can run in user-mode. These share the underlying programming model. However, the kernel-mode framework uses a flat C API while the user-mode framework is based on C++ and a light version of [[Component Object Model|COM]]. WDF also includes a set of static verification tools for use by driver writers. These tools examine driver code for common errors and/or simulate the code of a driver
