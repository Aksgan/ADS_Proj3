The name "Molinux" derives from the Spanish word "molino", meaning "mill" or "windmill". Each version of Molinux is named for a character from the great Spanish novel ''[[Don Quixote]]'', by [[Miguel de Cervantes]]. ==Project information== Molinux is an initiative begun in 2005 by the government of Castilla-La Mancha to introduce the Castile-La Mancha community to the forefront of the Information Society.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The Molinux project is intended to attack the [[digital divide]] by reducing the cost of software and offering an easy-to-use [[operating system]]. The sponsoring regional government's commitment to the [[open source]] philosophy is such that they have committed not to impose the use of Molinux. "The advantage is that the software is free to compete with anyone, and the user can choose between using this or any other software."[http://www.elmundo.es/navegante/2004/12/16/softlibre/1103216028.html] ==Latest version== Version 6.0 of Molinux ("Zoraida") was launched on 2010-06-23. ===Main features=== {{Prose|date=December 2008}} * Based on Ubuntu "Lucid" 10.04 * [[Linux kernel]] 2.6.32 * [[GNOME]] 2.30 * [[OpenOffice.org]] 3.2 * [[Mozilla Firefox]] 3.6 * [[X.Org Server]] 1.7 * The distribution's artistic team has delivered new desktop backgrounds depicting images from the autonomous community and some abstract designs, as well as brand new icons for the panels, menus and desktop. An interesting new feature is a new backup manager that automates backing up of data to external devices or over the local network. {{Commons category}} ==External links== * [http://www.molinux.info/ Official site] * [http://www.ibarataria.org/ Fundación Ínsula Barataria] {{ES-FreeSoftwareDistro}} {{Linux-distro}} {{Ubuntu-distro}} [[Category:Ubuntu (operating system) derivatives]] [[Category:Educational operating systems]] {{linux-distro-stub}} [[ca:Molinux]] [[es:Molinux]]</text> </page> <page> <id>24981</id> <title>Moment (mathematics)</title> <text>{{redirect|Second moment|the technique in probability theory|Second moment method}} {{seealso|Moment (physics)}} [[Image:Moments.svg|right|thumb|300px|Increasing each of the first four moments in turn whilst keeping the others constant, for a [[discrete uniform distribution]] with four values.]] In [[mathematics]], '''moment''' is, loosely speaking, a quantitative measure of the shape of a set of points. The "second moment", for example, is widely used and measures the "width" (in a particular sense) of a set of points in one dimension or in higher dimensions measures the shape of a cloud of points as it could be fit by an [[ellipsoid]]. Other moments describe other aspects of a [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] such as how the distribution is skewed from its mean, or peaked. The mathematical concept is closely related to the concept of [[moment (physics)|moment]] in [[physics]], although moment in physics is [[Moment_of_inertia#Comparison_with_covariance_matrix|often represented somewhat differently]]. Any distribution can be characterized by a number of features (such as the mean, the variance, the skewness, etc.), and the moments of a function<ref>A function such as a [[probability density function]] or [[cumulative distribution function]]; see [[Moment-generating function]].</ref> describe the nature of its distribution. The 1st moment is denoted by ''μ<sub>1</sub>''. The first moment of the distribution of the random variable ''X'' is the expectation operator, i.e., the [[population mean]] (if the first moment exists). In higher orders, the central moments (moments about the mean) are more interesting than the moments about zero. The ''k''th [[central moment]], of a real-valued random variable probability distribution ''X'', with the [[expected value]] ''μ'' is: :<math>\mu_k=E((X-\mu)^k).\,</math> The first central moment is thus 0. The zero-th central moment, ''μ''<sub>0</sub> is one. See also [[central moment]]. ==Significance of the moments== The ''n''<sup>th</sup> moment of a real-valued continuous function ''f''(''x'') of a real variable about a value ''c'' is :<math>\mu'_n=\int_{-\infty}^\infty (x - c)^n\,f(x)\,dx.\,\!</math> It is possible to define moments for [[random variable]]s in a more general fashion than moments for real values—see [[#Moments in metric spaces|moments in metric spaces]].
