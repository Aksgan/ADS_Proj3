as the [[Commodore 64]] or [[Atari 800XL]]. The 5.25" drive was accessible from the side of the computer, on the right hand side. The EX was marketed as a starter system for people new to computing, and sold for $1000.00 from Radio Shack in December 1986. The EX and HX would be among the most popular of the Tandy 1000 line because of their low price. The EX had a 7.16 MHz 8088 (capable of clocking down to 4.77 MHz) and one internal 5.25" floppy drive. An external drive could be connected to a port on the back. ===Tandy 1000 HX=== The Tandy 1000 HX was the bigger brother of the EX. It was mostly the same machine, but had a 3.5" floppy instead of a 5.25" one, and also had DOS 2.11 in ROM, which could be accessed by starting the computer with no bootable disk present. Like the EX, the clock speed of its 8088 CPU was increased to 7.16 MHz, providing a large performance benefit; it could clock down to 4.77 MHz for compatibility with older applications. (4.77 MHz was the speed of the 8088 in the IBM PC and PC/XT models and so was the de-facto standard speed for an 8088 in an IBM-compatible.)

This would be accomplished by placing a memory expansion card, which came with 128k, in the expansion slot and adding another 256 (for a total of 384) kilobytes in memory chips to this board. The cards for the 1000 HX (and 1000 EX) were ISA electrically, but used a pin header rather than an edge connector. Called "PLUS cards", their connector design allowed them to be smaller (and cheaper) than standard ISA cards and to stack, rather than connecting to separate motherboard connectors; both of these aspects of the design saved space and allowed up to three cards to be installed in a small card compartment of the compact integrated system case. Radio Shack eventually sold an adapter card that allowed the installation of a "Plus Card" into a standard ISA slot, such as those in the larger Tandy 1000 models. In addition to the 5.25" drive bay of the EX model, the HX had another 3.5 inch drive bay in the computer case. On the back of the machine there was a port which allowed a user to connect an external 360k 5.25" or 720k 3.5" floppy disk drive unit, available from Tandy. The 1000 HX did not come with a hard drive, and Tandy did not offer fixed disks for it. However a number of third party vendors made fixed disks for the HX available for sale. The design of the EX and HX did not make it easy to add a hard disk, however. The settings on the computer could be changed so that instead of looking in ROM for DOS at bootup that it would go to the floppy drive instead. Most versions of MS-DOS worked with the 1000 HX, including DOS 3.x, and some later versions. There was a quirk in the DOS 4.0 environment that prevented that version of DOS from working with Tandy 1000 HX computers. ===Tandy 1000 SX/TX=== The Tandy 1000 TX was very similar to the Tandy 1000, having an external keyboard and similar casing. The most major difference was the use of an [[80286]] CPU; otherwise, it was nearly identical to the Tandy 1000, including the unique parallel port edge connector. Despite the 80286 processor, it was still an XT-class PC, not an AT-class PC, as it adapted the 80286 to operate over the same 8-bit data bus as previous Tandy 1000 models, and had 8-bit XT-style expansion slots. As such, it could not operate in 80286 protected mode or perform 16-bit memory or I/O transfers in one bus cycle, but it did benefit from the higher speed of the 80286 and its other added instructions in real mode. The TX had a 3.5" internal floppy disk drive, with an optional additional internal 5.25" floppy disk drive. It contained ports for two joysticks in the front along with the keyboard, and included a volume control with a 1/8" headphone jack on the front. The back had all of the same ports as the Tandy 1000, except that the light pen port was replaced with an RS-232 serial port. The memory size was 640k (upgradable to 768k, with the added 128K devoted to video<ref>Because the Tandy 1000 was originally designed to be compatible with the IBM PCjr, and the IBM PCjr used part of its main memory as video memory, so did the Tandy 1000 series (except for the VGA-equipped RLX and RSX). In this respect, the Tandy 1000 and PCjr are unlike the IBM PC, PC/XT, PC AT, and all 100% compatibles, which used display adapters with separate, dedicated video memory. Expanding the memory of the Tandy 1000 TX to 768K ensured that more memory would be available in the 640K of the memory space allocated by IBM for main memory (for programs and their general data). </ref>) and the computer came bundled with [[DeskMate]]. The Tandy 1000 SX was the lower-end sibling of the TX, and was essentially an upgraded reissue of the original Tandy 1000. It used a 7.16 MHz 8088-2 processor, had 384k of memory (upgradeable to 640K on the motherboard,) came with either one or two 5.25" internal floppy disk drives, had the light pen port (not a serial port) like the original Tandy 1000, and lacked the volume control and headphone jack of the TX (also like the original 1000). The 1000 SX came with MS-DOS 3.2 and Deskmate 2 on 5.25" 360K diskettes. The MS-DOS was a version specialized for and only bootable on the Tandy 1000, as it would announce on the screen of any other PC-compatible one tried to boot with it; it
