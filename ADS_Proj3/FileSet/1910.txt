Pollak</title> <text>'''Henry Otto Pollak''' (December 13, 1927) is an [[Austria|Austrian]]-[[United States|American]] mathematician, known for his contributions to [[information theory]]. Born in [[Vienna, Austria]], he since moved to [[USA]]. While at [[Yale University]] for his [[B.Sc.]] in [[mathematics]] (1947) he participated on silver-award winning teams with celebrated mathematicians as [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Murray Gerstenhaber]]. He earned an [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]] and [[Ph.D.]] (1951) degree in [[mathematics]] from [[Harvard University]], the latter on the thesis ''Some Estimates for Extremal Distance'' advised by [[Lars Ahlfors]]. Pollak then joined [[Bell Labs]] (1951), where he in the early 1960s became director of the Mathematics and Statistics Research Center. He authored near forty papers, many of these with [[David Slepian]] and [[Henry Landau]] on analysis, function theory, probability theory, and mathematics education. He has applied mathematics to solve problems in physics and networks, communication theory, discrete systems, statistics and data analysis, and economic analysis. Pollak also holds patents in the area of signalling.<ref>{{US Patent|3710026}}</ref> He has held teaching positions in the mathematics department at [[Columbia University]]. ==Awards== *[[Earle Raymond Hedrick]] lecturer (1973) *[[Mathematical Association of America]] chair of New Jersey section (1958&ndash;59), governor (1961&ndash;63) and president (1975&ndash;76). *honorary ''Sc.D.'' at [[Bowdoin College]] (1977)<ref>[http://library.bowdoin.edu/arch/subject/bowdoin/honors/pollak77.pdf Henry Otto Pollak, honorary Sc.D.] announcement</ref> *honorary doctorate from [[Technische Universiteit Eindhoven]] (1981) *Dan Christie lecture on ''On the Addressing Problem in Loop Switching, or, How to Embed an Arbitrary Graph in a Squashed Cube'' at [[Bowdoin College]] (1983) *[[Mathematical Association of America]] Meritorious Service Award (1990) ==References== {{reflist}} {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME = Pollak, Henry | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH = | PLACE OF BIRTH = | DATE OF DEATH = | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Pollak, Henry}} [[Category:People from Vienna]] [[Category:Austrian mathematicians]] [[Category:American people of Austrian descent]] [[Category:Austrian immigrants to the United States]] [[Category:American mathematicians]] [[Category:Information theorists]] [[Category:Yale University alumni]] [[Category:Harvard University alumni]] [[Category:Columbia University faculty]] [[Category:Scientists at Bell Labs]] [[Category:1927 births]] [[Category:Statisticians]] [[Category:Living people]]</text> </page> <page> <id>16545</id> <title>Herbert Edelsbrunner</title> <text>'''Herbert Edelsbrunner''' (born 1958) is a computer scientist working in the field of [[computational geometry]], the Arts & Science Professor of Computer Science and Mathematics at [[Duke University]], Professor at the [[Institute of Science and Technology Austria]] (IST Austria), and the co-founder of Geomagic, Inc. He was the first of only two computer scientists to win the [[National Science Foundation]]'s [[Alan T. Waterman Award]]. ==Academic biography== Edelsbrunner was born in 1958 in [[Graz]], [[Austria]].<ref name="cw">[http://www.welfenlab.de/events/hcw07/program/who_is_who/index.php Who is Who – Cyberworlds 2007].</ref> He received his Ph.D. in 1982 from [[Graz University of Technology]], under the supervision of [[Hermann Maurer]]; his thesis was entitled “Intersection Problems in Computational Geometry.”<ref>{{mathgenealogy|name=Herbert Edelsbrunner|id=41369}}.</ref> After a brief assistant professorship at Graz, he joined the faculty of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] in 1985, and moved to Duke University in 1999.<ref>[http://www.cs.duke.edu/~edels/ Biographical information from Edelsbrunner's web page at Duke].</ref> In 1996, with his wife Ping Fu (then director of visualization at the [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications]]), he co-founded Geomagic, a company that develops shape modeling software; he continues to serve on its board of directors.<ref>[http://www.geomagic.com/en/about_us/directors.php Geomagic board of directors].</ref> Since August 2009 he is Professor at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (IST Austria) in Klosterneuburg. In 1991, Edelsbrunner received the Alan T. Waterman Award. He was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2005, and received an honorary doctorate from Graz University of Technology in 2006.<ref name="cw"/> In 2008 he was elected to the [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]].<ref>[http://www.leopoldina-halle.de/cms/de/pressemitteilungen/einzelansicht-pressemitteilung/article/268/deutsche-aka-1.html Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina wählt neue Mitglieder], Leopoldina, May 22, 2008.</ref> ==Publications== Edelsbrunner has over 100 research publications<ref>[http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/e/Edelsbrunner:Herbert.html DBLP: Herbert Edelsbrunner].</ref> and is an [[ISI highly cited researcher]].<ref>[http://hcr3.isiknowledge.com/author.cgi?&link1=Results&id=1236 ISI highly cited researcher: Herbert Edelsbrunner].</ref> He has also published two books on computational geometry: ''Algorithms in Combinatorial Geometry'' (Springer-Verlag, 1987, ISBN 9783540137221), and ''Geometry and Topology for Mesh Generation'' (Cambridge University Press, 2001, ISBN 9780521793094). As Edelsbrunner's Waterman Award citation states,<ref>[http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=356892&tstart=1815 Abstracts of NSF Awards (STIS), Computer Research: Alan T.

Dr. Edelsbrunner has had a tremendous impact on computational geometry by his own research as well as by his 1987 book Algorithms in Combinatorial Geometry which systematized the field in its early days. This book is considered by many people to be still the best textbook and reference source on computational geometry.}} ==Research contributions== Edelsbrunner's most heavily cited research contribution<ref>According to Google scholar, August 2008.</ref> is his work with Ernst Mücke on ''alpha shapes'', a technique for defining a sequence of multiscale approximations to the shape of a three-dimensional point cloud. In this technique, one varies a parameter alpha ranging from 0 to the
