All shortcuts require the Control key to be pressed. Additionally, the Heading commands under the Style menu and commands under the Link menu require the Shift key to be held down.]] The simplest keyboard shortcuts consist of only one key. For these, one generally just writes out the name of the key, as in the message "Press F1 for Help". The name of the key is sometimes surrounded in brackets or similar characters. For example: <nowiki>[F1]</nowiki> or <F1>. The key name may also be set off using special formatting (bold, italic, [[capital letters|all caps]], etc.) Many shortcuts require two or more keys to be pressed together. For these, the usual notation is to list the keys names separated by plus signs or hyphens. For example: "Ctrl+C", "Ctrl-C", or "{{keypress|[[Ctrl key|Ctrl]]}}+{{keypress|[[C]]}}". The Ctrl key is sometimes indicated by a caret character (^). Thus Ctrl-C is sometimes written as ^C. At times, usually on [[Unix]] platforms, the case of the second character is significant - if the character would normally require pressing the Shift key to type, then the Shift key is part of the shortcut e.g. '^C' vs. '^c' or '^@' vs. '^2'. Some keyboard shortcuts require keys (or sets of keys) to be pressed individually, in sequence. These are generally written with the individual keys (or sets) separated by commas or semicolons. For example "Alt+F, S" or "Alt+F; S" would mean "First press {{keypress|[[Alt key|Alt]]}} and {{keypress|F}} together, then press {{keypress|S}}". Such shortcuts often represent a series of smaller shortcuts, strung together to create a larger action. To continue the "Alt+F, S" example, in many programs, this will open the "File" menu, and then invoke the "Save" function. ==See also== {{Wiktionary}} * [[Access keys]] * [[Accelerator table]] * [[Common User Access]] * [[Keyboard (computing)|Computer keyboard]] * [[Human interface guidelines]] * [[Pointing device gesture]] * [[Table of keyboard shortcuts]] ==Notes and references== {{reflist}} == External links == * [http://java.sun.com/products/jlf/ed2/book/HIG.Glossary.html#51661 mnemonic definition on SUN glossary] * [http://blog.i18n.ro/keyboard-shortcuts-and-mnemonics-or-accelerators-are-not-the-same-thing/ Differences between keyboard shortcuts and mnemonics] * [http://isometricland.com/keyboard/keyboard.php Video Game Keyboard Charts] - Small graphical database of video game keyboard bindings.

The [[binary prefix]] ''[[kibi-|kibi]]'' means 1024, therefore 1 kibibyte is {{gaps|1024|bytes}}. The unit symbol for the kibibyte is '''KiB'''.<ref>{{cite web | author= International Electrotechnical Commission | title= Prefixes for binary multiples | url= http://www.iec.ch/zone/si/si_bytes.htm | date= 2007 | accessdate= 2007-05-06}}</ref> The unit was established by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) in 1999<ref>International Electrotechnical Commission (January 1999), IEC 60027-2 ''Amendment 2: Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology - Part 2: Telecommunications and electronics''</ref> and has been accepted for use by all major standards organizations. It was designed to replace the [[kilobyte]] used in some computer science contexts to mean 1024 bytes, which conflicts with the SI definition of the prefix [[kilo-|kilo]]. {{Quantities of bytes}} ==Definition== :1 kibibyte = 2<sup>10</sup> bytes = 1024 bytes. The prefix ''kibi'' is derived as a [[portmanteau]] of the words kilo and binary, indicating its origin in the closeness in value to the [[SI prefix]] kilo (1000). While the SI prefix is written with lowercase ([[kilo-|k]]), the IEC prefix starts with an uppercase letter. ==History== The kibibyte is closely related to the [[kilobyte]]. The latter may be used in some contexts as a synonym for the kibibyte, but formally refers to 10<sup>3</sup> bytes = 1000 bytes, as the prefix is defined in the [[International System of Units]]. The binary interpretation of the metric prefixes causes relatively small differences with the smallest prefixes in the series, i.e. for kilo and mega, but grows to substantial differences beyond (see [[Binary_prefix#Deviation_between_powers_of_1024_and_powers_of_1000|Deviation between powers of 1024 and powers of 1000]]). In ''[[Introduction to MMIX]]'', [[Donald Knuth]] proposed that this unit be called a ''large kilobyte'' (abbreviated ''KKB'')<ref name=kilobyte>{{cite web | title = What is a kilobyte? | url = http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/news99.html | accessdate = 2010-05-20 }}</ref>. Other early proposals included using the Greek lowercase letter [[Kappa|''κ'' (kappa)]] for 1024 bytes (and using ''k'' exclusively for 1000), ''bK'', ''KB'', and others. See [[Binary prefix#Early suggestions]]. Adoption of the binary prefixes has been limited, primarily being used in [[open source software]]. In most cases the kilobyte continues to be used to refer to a power of ten as well as a power of two.<ref name=lawsuit>{{cite web | title =Safier vs WDC complaint | url =http://www.wdc.com/settlement/docs/complaint.htm | accessdate = 2007-11-15 }}</ref><ref name=profrowlett>{{cite web | last =Rowlett | first =Prof. Russ | first =Brian | publisher =Independent Computer Products Users Group (ICPUG) | date = 7 August, 2005 | url =http://www.icpug.org.uk/national/features/050807fe.htm | title =I've got a bigger gigabyte than you! | accessdate = 2007-11-15 }}</ref> ==See also== * [[Kilobyte]] * [[IEEE 1541]] * [[Orders of magnitude (data)]] * [[SI prefix]] ==References== {{reflist}} {{Computer Storage Volumes}} [[Category:Units of information]] [[ar:كيبيبايت]] [[be-x-old:Кібібайт]] [[ca:Kibibyte]] [[da:Kibibyte]] [[el:Κιμπιμπάιτ]] [[es:Kibibyte]] [[eo:Kibibajto]] [[eu:Kibibyte]] [[ko:키비바이트]] [[ia:Kibibyte]] [[it:Kibibyte]] [[mk:Кибибајт]] [[ml:കിബിബൈറ്റ്]] [[ms:Kibibait]] [[ja:キビバイト]] [[no:Kibibyte]] [[pt:Kibibyte]] [[simple:Kibibyte]] [[sk:Kibibajt]] [[sr:Кибибајт]] [[uk:Кібібайт]] [[zh:Kibibyte]]</text> </page> <page> <id>20661</id> <title>Kikaider</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=October 2010}} {{cleanup-confusing|list|date=October 2010}} {{Infobox animanga/Header | name = Kikaider | image = | caption = 1974 ''Kikaider'' 0-1 Album cover | ja_kanji = 人造人間キカイダー | ja_romaji = | genre = [[Action genre|Action]], [[Adventure]], [[Mecha]], [[Science Fiction]] }} {{Infobox animanga/Video | type = drama | director = | producer = |
