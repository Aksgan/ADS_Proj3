<id>1685</id> <title>American National Corpus</title> <text>The '''American National Corpus''' (ANC) is a [[text corpus]] of [[American English]] currently containing 22 million words written and spoken data produced since 1990. The ANC includes a range of genres comparable to the [[British National Corpus]] and is annotated for [[Lexical category|part of speech]] and [[lemma (linguistics)|lemma]], [[shallow parsing|shallow parse]], and [[Named entity|named entities]]. The full 22 million word ANC is available from the [[Linguistic Data Consortium]]. A 15 million word subset of the corpus, called the '''Open American National Corpus''' (OANC), is freely available with no restrictions on its use from the [http://www.anc.org/ ANC Website]. The corpus and its annotations are provided according to the specifications of [[ISO/TC 37]] SC4's Linguistic Annotation Framework. By using a freely provided transduction tool, the corpus and user-chosen annotations is provided in multiple formats, including the XML format conformant to the [[XCES|XML Corpus Encoding Standard (XCES)]] (usable with the [[British National Corpus]]'s XAIRA search engine), a [[UIMA]]-compliant format, and formats suitable for input to a wide variety of concordance software. The ANC differs from other corpora of English because it is richly annotated, including different [[Lexical category|part of speech]] annotations (Penn tags, CLAWS5 and CLAWS7 tags), [[shallow parsing|shallow parse annotations]], and annotations for several types of [[Named entity|named entities]]. Additional annotations are added to all or parts of the corpus as they become available, often by contributions from other projects. Unlike on-line searchable corpora, which due to copyright restrictions allow access only to individual sentences, the entire ANC is available to enable research involving, for example, development of statistical language models and full-text linguistic annotation. ANC annotations are automatically-produced and unvalidated. A '''Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus''' (MASC) will be released in Fall 2009,{{Update after|2010|11|25}} which includes validated annotations for the above-mentioned phenomena as well as [[Treebank|Penn Treebank]] syntactic annotation, [[WordNet]] sense annotation, and [[FrameNet]] semantic frame annotations. In Fall, 2009, the OANC Ngram Search Engine will become available on the [http://www.anc.org/ ANC Website], which will provide intra- and inter-sentential pattern-based searches. In early 2010, the OANC will be expanded to include an additional 20-30 million words of written and spoken data.{{Update after|2010|11|25}} ==See also== * [[British National Corpus]] * [[Oxford English Corpus]] * [[Corpus of Contemporary American English]] (COCA). ==External links== * [http://www.cs.vassar.edu/~ide/papers/anc-lrec04.pdf The American National Corpus First Release] * [http://www.anc.org/ ANC Website] [[Category:Corpora]] [[Category:Online databases]]</text> </page> <page> <id>1687</id> <title>American Revolution</title> <text>{{About|political and social developments, and the origins and aftermath of the war|military actions|American Revolutionary War|other uses}} {{pp-semi|small=yes}} :''In this article, inhabitants of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] of [[British America]] that supported the American Revolution are primarily referred to as "Americans," with occasional references to "[[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]]", "Whigs," "Rebels" or "Revolutionaries".

They first rejected the authority of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] to govern them from overseas without representation, and then expelled all royal officials. By 1774 each colony had established a [[Provincial Congress]], or an equivalent governmental institution, to form individual self-governing [[State (polity)|states]]. The British responded by sending combat troops to re-impose direct rule. Through representatives sent in 1775 to the [[Second Continental Congress]], the new states joined together at first to defend their respective [[self-governance]] and manage the armed conflict against the British known as the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775â€“83, also ''American War of Independence''). Ultimately, the states collectively determined that the British monarchy, by acts of [[tyrant|tyranny]], could no longer [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimately]] claim their [[allegiance]]. They then severed ties with the British Empire in July 1776, when the Congress issued the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], rejecting the monarchy on behalf of the new [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] nation. The war ended with effective American victory in October 1781, followed by formal British abandonment of any claims to the United States with the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783. The American Revolution was the result of a series of social, political, and intellectual transformations in early American society and government, collectively referred to as the ''[[American Enlightenment]]''. Americans rejected the [[Oligarchy|oligarchies]] common in [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] Europe at the time, championing instead the development of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] based on the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] understanding of [[Liberalism in the United States|liberalism]]. Among the significant results of the revolution was the creation of a democratically-elected representative government [[Consent of the governed|responsible to the will of the people]]. However, sharp political debates erupted over the appropriate level of [[democracy]] desirable in the new government, with a number of [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founders]] fearing [[Ochlocracy|mob rule]]. Many fundamental issues of national governance were settled with the ratification of the [[United States Constitution]] in 1788, which replaced the relatively weaker first attempt at a national government adopted in 1781, the ''[[Articles of Confederation|Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]]''. In contrast to the loose [[confederation]], the Constitution established a strong [[Federation|federated]] government. The [[United States Bill of Rights]] (1791), comprising the first 10 constitutional amendments, quickly followed. It guaranteed many "[[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]]" that were influential in justifying the revolution, and attempted to balance a strong national government with relatively broad [[Liberty|personal liberties]]. The American shift to liberal republicanism, and the gradually
