a group of users in a network of NT/2000 systems. ==Overview== Windows grants or denies access and privileges to resources based on [[access control list]]s (ACLs), which use SIDs to uniquely identify users and their group memberships. When a user logs into a computer, an [[access token]] is generated that contains user and group SIDs and user privilege level. When a user requests access to a resource, the access token is checked against the ACL to permit or deny particular action on a particular object. SIDs are useful for troubleshooting issues with security audits, Windows server and domain migrations. The format of an SID can be illustrated using the following example: "S-1-5-21-3623811015-3361044348-30300820-1013"; {| class="wikitable" border="1" |- ! S ! 1 ! 5 ! 21-3623811015-3361044348-30300820 ! 1013 |- | The string is a SID. | The revision level (the version of the SID specification). | The identifier authority value. | domain or local computer identifier | a [[Relative ID]] (RID).

Microsoft maintains a complete list of these identifiers in a knowledge base article.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/243330 |title=Well-known security identifiers in Windows operating systems (MSKB 243330) |work=Knowledge Base |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=February 28, 2007 |accessdate=2007-12-08 }}</ref> {| class="wikitable" |- !

This could lead to unexpected access to shared files or files stored on a removable storage: If some [[access control list]]s are set on a file, the actual permissions can be associated with a user SID. If this user SID is duplicated on another computer (because the computer SID is duplicated and because the user SIDs are built based on the computer SID + a sequential number), a user of a second computer having the same SID could have access to the files that the user of a first computer has protected. Now the truth is that when the computers are joined into a domain (Active Directory or NT domain for instance), each computer has a unique Domain SID which is recomputed each time a computer enters a domain. Thus there are usually no real problems with Duplicated SIDs when the computers are members of a domain, especially if local user accounts are not used. If local user accounts are used, there is a potential security issue that is the same as the one described above when the computers are members of a Workgroup but that affects only the files and resources protected by local users, not by domain users. In other words, duplicated SIDs are usually not a problem with Microsoft Windows systems. However Microsoft does provide the '"NewSID" utility to change a machine SID.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897418.aspx | title = NewSID v4.10 | work = Windows Sysinternals | date = 2006-11-01 | publisher = Microsoft }}</ref> But other programs that detect SIDs might have problems with its security. After NewSID's retirement, Microsoft engineer [[Mark Russinovich]] posted an article on his blog<ref>{{cite web | url = http://blogs.technet.com/markrussinovich/archive/2009/11/03/3291024.aspx | title = The Machine SID Duplication Myth | first = Mark | last = Russinovich | authorlink = Mark Russinovich | date = 2009-11-03 | publisher = Microsoft | work = TechNet Blogs }}</ref> explaining the retirement of the NewSID stating that neither he, or the Windows security team, could think of any situation where duplicate SIDs could cause any problems at all, against commonly accepted wisdom. ==Retirement Notice== On November 1, 2009, Microsoft added the following to the NewSID download page: {{blockquote|Note: NewSID will be retired from Sysinternals on November 2, 2009.}} At present, the only supported mechanism for duplicating disks for Windows operating systems is through use of [[SysPrep]]. == Machine SIDs== The machine SID is stored in the '''SECURITY''' registry hive located at '''SECURITY\SAM\Domains\Account''', this key has two values '''F''' and '''V'''. The '''V''' value is a binary value that has the computer SID embedded within it at the end of its data (Last 96 bits).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897418.aspx |title=MS TechNet NewSID Utility - How It Works |work=Knowledge Base |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=November 1, 2006 |accessdate=2008-08-05 }}</ref> *"NewSID ensures that this
