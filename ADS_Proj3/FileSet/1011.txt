1/8 inch (3 mm) monolithic and 5/8 inch (16 mm) insulating glass. Larger thicknesses are typically employed for buildings or areas with higher thermal, [[relative humidity]], or [[Acoustic transmission|sound transmission]] requirements, such as laboratory areas or [[recording studio]]s. Glass may be used which is [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]], [[translucent]], or opaque, or in varying degrees thereof. ''Transparent'' glass usually refers to ''vision'' glass in a curtain wall. Spandrel or vision glass may also contain translucent glass, which could be for security or aesthetic purposes. ''Opaque'' glass is used in areas to hide a column or spandrel beam or shear wall behind the curtain wall. Another method of hiding spandrel areas is through ''shadow box'' construction (providing a dark enclosed space behind the transparent or translucent glass). Shadow box construction creates a perception of depth behind the glass that is sometimes desired. ===Fabric veneer=== Fabric is another type of material which is common for curtain walls. Fabric is often times much less expensive and serves as a less permanent solution. Unlike glass or stone, fabric is much faster to install, less expensive, and often times much easier to modify after it is installed. ===Stone veneer=== Thin blocks (3 to 4 inches (75-100 mm)) of stone can be inset within a curtain wall system to provide architectural flavor. The type of stone used is limited only by the strength of the stone and the ability to manufacture it in the proper shape and size. Common stone types used are: [http://www.arriscraft.com Arriscraft](calcium silicate);[[granite]]; [[marble]]; [[travertine]]; and [[limestone]]. ===Panels=== Metal panels can take various forms including aluminum plate; thin composite panels consisting of two thin aluminum sheets sandwiching a thin plastic interlayer; and panels consisting of metal sheets bonded to rigid insulation, with or without an inner metal sheet to create a sandwich panel. Other opaque panel materials include [[fiber-reinforced plastic]] (FRP), stainless steel, and [[terracotta]]. Terracotta curtain wall panels were first used in Europe, but only a few manufacturers produce high quality modern terracotta curtain wall panels. ===Louvers=== A [[louver]] is provided in an area where mechanical equipment located inside the building requires ventilation or fresh air to operate. They can also serve as a means of allowing outside air to filter into the building to take advantage of favorable climatic conditions and minimize the usage of energy-consuming [[HVAC]] systems. Curtain wall systems can be adapted to accept most types of louver systems to maintain the same architectural sightlines and style while providing the necessary functionality. ===Windows and vents=== Most curtain wall glazing is fixed, meaning there is no access to the exterior of the building except through doors. However, windows or vents can be glazed into the curtain wall system as well, to provide required ventilation or operable windows. Nearly any window type can be made to fit into a curtain wall system. ==Fire safety== [[Image:Curtain wall backpan styrofoam.jpg|thumb|right|Combustible [[Polystyrene]] insulation in point contact with [[sheet metal]] backban. Incomplete [[firestop]] in the [[Joint (building)|perimeter slab edge]], made of [[Mineral wool|rockwool]] without topcaulking.]] [[Firestop]]ping at the [[Joint (building)|"perimeter slab edge"]], which is a gap between the floor and the backpan of the curtain wall is essential to slow the passage of fire and combustion gases between floors. Spandrel areas must have non-combustible insulation at the interior face of the curtain wall. Some building codes require the mullion to be wrapped in heat-retarding insulation near the ceiling to prevent the mullions from melting and spreading the fire to the floor above. It is important to note that the firestop at the perimeter slab edge is considered a continuation of the [[fire-resistance rating]] of the floor slab. The curtain wall itself, however, is not ordinarily required to have a rating. This causes a quandary as [[Compartmentalization (fire protection)]] is typically based upon ''closed'' compartments to avoid fire and smoke migrations beyond each engaged compartment. A curtain wall by its very nature prevents the completion of the compartment (or envelope). The use of fire sprinklers has been shown to mitigate this matter. As such, unless the building is sprinklered, fire may still travel up the curtain wall, if the glass on the exposed floor is shattered due to fire influence, causing flames to lick up the outside of the building. Falling glass can endanger pedestrians, firefighters and firehoses below. An example of this is the [[First Interstate Tower fire]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. The fire here leapfrogged up the tower by shattering the glass and then consuming the [[aluminium]] skeleton holding the glass. Aluminium's melting temperature is 660°C, whereas building fires can reach 1,100°C. The melting point of aluminium is typically reached within minutes of the start of a [[fire]]. Firestops for such building joints can be qualified to [http://www.ul.com/fire/joint.html UL 2079 -- Tests for Fire Resistance of Building Joint Systems]. [[Fire sprinkler system|Sprinklering]] of each floor has a profoundly positive effect on the fire safety of buildings with curtain walls. In the case of the aforementioned fire, it was specifically the activation of the newly installed sprinkler system, which halted the advance of the fire and allowed effective suppression. Had this not occurred, the tower would have collapsed onto fire crews and into an adjacent building, while on fire. Exceptionally sound cementitious spray [[fireproofing]] also helped to delay and ultimately to avoid the possible collapse of the building, due to having the [[structural steel]] skeleton of the building reach the critical temperature, as the post-mortem fire investigation report indicated. This fire proved the positive collective effect of both [[active fire protection]] (sprinklers) and [[passive fire protection]] (fireproofing). Fireman knock-out glazing panels are often required for venting and emergency access from the exterior. Knock-out panels are generally fully [[Architectural Glass|tempered]] glass to allow full fracturing of the panel into small pieces and relatively safe removal from the opening. ==Maintenance and repair== Curtain walls and perimeter sealants require maintenance to maximize service life. Perimeter sealants, properly designed and installed, have a typical service life of 10 to 15 years. Removal and replacement of perimeter sealants require meticulous surface preparation
