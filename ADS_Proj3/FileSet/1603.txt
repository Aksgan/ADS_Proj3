The one time sector key is encrypted using a pseudorandom key. This pseudorandom key is derived from the sector number and a static 2048-bit master key with 128 bits of [[salt (cryptography)|salt]]. The [[pseudorandom number generator]] used for this purpose is called the Cherry Picker. This is not a well established PRNG, but rather one invented for GBDE. This generator may not meet the security levels of standard algorithms, and could be distinguishable from random numbers.<ref name=elric-initial-analysis>{{cite paper |author=Roland C.

Using a different key for each write also introduces a significant CPU overhead, as most [[block cipher]]s use key-specific precomputations, and makes disk updates non-[[atomicity|atomic]] since the keys are written separately from the data. As a result, data loss can occur on unexpected power drops, even when used with [[journaling file system]]s. GBDE also has a disk space [[computational overhead|overhead]] of about 3% to store the per-sector keys. To address these shortcomings, a more typical disk encryption solution for FreeBSD, [[Geli (software)|GELI]], was written later by Pawel Jakub Dawidek. == See also == {{Portal|Free software}} * [[Geli (software)|GELI]] * [[Disk encryption]] * [[Disk encryption software]] * [[Comparison of disk encryption software]] ==References== <references/> {{DEFAULTSORT:Gbde}} [[Category:Disk encryption]] {{crypto-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>14491</id> <title>GDDR</title> <text>'''GDDR''' or '''Graphics Double Data Rate''' memory refers to memory specifically designed for use on [[graphics card]]s.

The main machine in the line was the '''GE-225'''. It used a 20-bit word, of which 13 bits could be used for an address. Along with the basic [[Central processing unit|CPU]] the system could also include a [[floating point|floating-point]] unit, or interestingly, a [[fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] decimal option with three 6-bit decimals per word. It had 11 [[input/output|I/O]] [[channel controller]]s, and GE sold a variety of add-ons including disks, printers and other devices. The machines were built using discrete transistors, with a typical machine including about 10,000 transistors and 20,000 diodes. They used [[core memory]], and a standard 8k-word system held 186,000 magnetic cores. The '''GE-215''' was a scaled-down version of the GE-225, including only 6 I/O channels and only 4K or 8K of core. The '''GE-235''' was a re-implementation of the GE-225 with three times faster memory than the original. <ref>{{cite book |title=GE-235 Central Processor Reference Manual |url= |date=March 1964 |accessdate= |publisher=General Electric |id=CPB-374 }}</ref> The GE-235 consisted of several major components and options: * Central processor * 400 CPM or 1000 CPM card reader * 100 CPM card punch or 300 CPM card punch * Perforated tape subsystem * Magnetic tape subsystem * 12 Pocket high-speed document handler * On-line high speed printer or Off/on-line speed printer * Disc storage unit * Auxiliary Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) * DATANET data communications equipment Through the early 1960s GE worked with [[Dartmouth College]] on the development of a [[time-sharing]] [[operating system]], which would later go on to become [[Dartmouth Time Sharing System]] (DTSS). The system was constructed by attaching a number of [[teletypewriter]]s to a smaller GE machine called the '''Datanet-30''', which was a small computer that had evolved from an earlier process-control machine. DTSS was an odd system; it didn't run on the GE-235, but the DN-30 instead. The DN-30 accepted commands one at a time from the terminals connected to it, and then ran their requested programs on the GE-235. The GE-235 had no idea it was not running in [[batch mode]], and the illusion of [[computer multitasking|multitasking]] was being maintained externally. In 1965 GE started packaging the DN-30 and GE-235 systems together as the '''GE-265'''. The GE-265 achieved fame not only for being the first commercially successful time-sharing system, but it was also the machine on which the [[BASIC programming language]] was first created. ==See also== *[[GE-600 series]] *The [[GE-400]] a high maintenance system that pre-dated the GE-600 ==References== {{reflist}} {{refbegin}} * [http://febcm.club.fr/english/ge200.htm GE-200 Product Line] {{refend}} [[Category:Mainframe computers]] [[Category:Transistorized computers]] [[ja:GE-200シリーズ]] {{mainframe-compu-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>14509</id> <title>GEO-LEO</title> <text>{{Multiple issues|advert =March 2009|notability =March 2009}} {{noref|date=December 2010}} '''GEO-LEO''' ('''G'''EO '''L'''ibrary '''E'''xperts Online) is a [[virtual library]] for the specialty fields of [[mining]], [[geography]], [[maps]] and [[astronomy]]. This is a free [[Web portal|Internet portal]] to search for, find and obtain books, periodicals, articles, websites and maps in the context of geosciences. Free or licensed full texts, e.g. from e-journals, are directly accessible. Furthermore you can publish your own papers in '''GEO-LEOe-docs'''. GEO-LEO is a service provided by the university library “Georgius Agricola” of the TU [[Freiberg University of Mining and Technology|Bergakademie Freiberg]] and the [[Göttingen State and University Library]] (Niedersächsische Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek Göttingen, SUB) of the [[University of Göttingen]]. This cooperation is based on the [http://www.dfg.de/en/index.html DFG]´s ([[Germany]]'s Research Foundation) “national [[distributed library]] plan”, which shares the [[scientific literature]] provision between selected university libraries, each with special scientific priorities. Both libraries have a similar focus on the geosciences aspects of this library plan and therefore they cooperate closely. This is the background of their partnership and of the project GEO-LEO, funded by the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|DFG]] since 2002. ==Services== ===Metasearch=== GEO-LEO searches simultaneously through approximately 1.2 million references in [[library catalog]]ues, approximately 800 000 articles and reviews in data bases and approximately 47 000 full texts on more than 80 repositories. ===Internet resources=== In GEO-LEO more than 3 800 internet resources are integrated with a geosciences background from the
