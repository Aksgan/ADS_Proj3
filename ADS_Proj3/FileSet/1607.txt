supports a quick mask mode where a user can use a brush to paint the area of a selection, visibly this looks like a red colored overlay being added or removed. The foreground select tool is an implementation of [[Simple Interactive Object Extraction]] (SIOX) a method used to perform the extraction of foreground elements, such as a person or a tree in focus. The Paths Tool allows a user to create vectors (also known as [[BÃ©zier curve]]s). Paths can be used to create complex selections around natural curves, paths can also be named, saved, and painted (or "stroked") with brushes, patterns, or various line styles. * ''Image editing'': there are many tools that can be used for editing images in GIMP. The more common tools include a paint brush, pencil, airbrush, eraser and ink tools used to create new or blended pixels. Tools such as the bucket fill and blend tools are used to change large regions of space in an image and can be used to help blend images. GIMP also has a selection of smart tools, which are tools that use a more complex algorythm to enable a user to do things that otherwise would be time consuming or impossible; these smart tools include the clone tool that copies pixels using a brush, the healing brush which copies pixels from an area and corrects the tone and color where it is being used. The perspective clone tool works in a similar way to the clone tool previously mentioned but also allows a user to correct for distance changes. The blur and sharpen tool is a brush that blurs and sharpens. Finally the dodge and burn tool is a brush that makes target pixels lighter (dodges) or darker (burns).<br />A list of GIMP transform tools include the align tool, move, crop, rotate, scale, shear, perspective and flit tools. [[File:Layers Channels Paths.gif|thumb |Animation showing three docked and tabbed dialogs: layers, channels, and paths.]] * ''Layers, layer masks and channels'': an image being edited in GIMP can consist of many [[Layers (digital image editing)|layers]] sitting in a stack. The GIMP user manual suggests that "A good way to visualize a GIMP image is as a stack of transparencies" where in GIMP terminology each transparency is a layer.<ref>{{cite web |author=GIMP documentation team |title=Introduction to layers |url=http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-image-combining.html#gimp-concepts-layers |work=GIMP user manual |publisher=docs.gimp.org |accessdate=2 July 2009}}</ref> Each layer in an image is made up of several channels. In an [[RGB]] image there are normally 3 or 4 channels, each consisting of a red, green and blue channel. Color sublayers look like slightly different gray images, but when put together they make a complete image. The fourth channel that may be part of a layer is the [[alpha channel]] (or layer mask), this channel measures opacity where a whole or part of an image can be completely visible, partially visible or invisible. <!-- -->Text layers can be created using the text tool, allowing a user to write on an image. Text layers can be transformed in several ways, such as converting it to a path or selection.<ref>{{cite web |author=GIMP documentation team |title=Paths and Text |url=http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/ch07s05s05.html |work=GIMP manual |publisher=gimp.org |accessdate=5 July 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=GIMP documentation team |title=Text and Fonts |url=http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-concepts-text.html |work=GIMP manual |publisher=gimp.org |accessdate=5 July 2009}}</ref> * ''Automation, scripts and plug-ins'': GIMP has approximately 150 standard effects and filters, including Drop Shadow, Blur, Motion blur and Noise.<br />GIMP operations can be automated with [[scripting language]]s. The Script-Fu is a [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] based [[extension language]] implemented using [[TinyScheme]], GIMP can also be scripted in [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]] (Python-fu), or [[Tcl]]. GIMP has support for several methods of sharpening and blurring images including the blur and sharpen tool. The [[Unsharp masking#Digital unsharp masking|unsharp mask]] tool is used to sharpen an image selectively - it only sharpens areas of an image that are sufficiently detailed. The unsharp mask tool is considered to give more targeted results for photographs than a normal sharpening filter.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sharpening - Unsharp Mask |url=http://www.scantips.com/simple6.html |publisher=www.scantips.com |accessdate=8 August 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Unsharp Mask |url=http://manual.gimp.org/en/plug-in-unsharp-mask.html |date=2002, 2003<!--, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 -->|work=GIMP manual |publisher=manual.gimp.org |accessdate=8 August 2009}}</ref> The Selective Gaussian Blur tool works in a similar way, except it blurs areas of an image with little detail. * ''GEGL'': The ''[[GEGL|Generic Graphics Library]]'' (''GEGL'') was first introduced as part of GIMP on the 2.6 release of GIMP. This initial introduction does not yet exploit all of the capabilities of GEGL; as of the 2.6 release GIMP can use GEGL to perform high bit depth color operations, because of this less information is lost when performing color operations.<ref> {{cite web |author=GIMP development team |title=GIMP 2.6 Release Notes |url=http://gimp.org/release-notes/gimp-2.6.html |publisher=gimp.org |accessdate=2 July 2009}} </ref> When fully integrated, GEGL will allow GIMP to have a higher color bit depth and also a better non-destructive work-flow. * ''File formats'': GIMP supports saving and loading a large number of different [[file format]]s,<ref> {{cite web |title=File formats supported by the GIMP |url=http://www.gimphelp.org/formats.shtml |year=2007 |publisher=gimphelp.org |accessdate=2 July 2009}}</ref> GIMP's native format [[XCF (file format)|XCF]] is designed to store an image including all features specific to GIMP such as layers, channels and vectors; XCF is named after the e''X''perimental ''C''omputing ''F''acility where GIMP was authored. {|- class="wikitable" !Type !File formats |- !Readable and writable |GIMP has import/export support for popular image formats such as [[BMP file format|BMP]], [[JPEG]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] and [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]], along with the file formats of several other applications such as [[Autodesk]] flic animations, [[Corel Paint Shop Pro]] images, and Adobe Photoshop documents. Other formats with read/write support include [[PostScript]] documents, [[X Window system|X]] bitmap image and Zsoft [[PCX]].
