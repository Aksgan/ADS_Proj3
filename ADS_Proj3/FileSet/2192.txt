device will establish an emergency call carrying both voice and data directly to the nearest emergency point (normally the nearest E[[1-1-2]] [[Public-safety answering point]], PSAP). The voice call enables the vehicle occupant to communicate with the trained eCall operator. At the same time, a minimum set of data will be sent to the eCall operator receiving the voice call. The minimum set of data contains information about the incident, including time, precise location, the direction the vehicle was traveling, and vehicle identification. The pan-European eCall aims to be operative for all new type-approved vehicles as a standard option. Depending on the manufacturer of the eCall system, it could be mobile phone based (Bluetooth connection to an in-vehicle interface), an integrated eCall device, or a functionality of a broader system like navigation, Telematics device, or tolling device. eCall is expected to be offered, at earliest, by the end of 2010, pending standardization by the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]] and commitment from large EU member states such as France and the United Kingdom. [[Image:ERPBugis.JPG|thumb|right|[[Electronic Road Pricing|Congestion pricing]] gantry at North Bridge Road, [[Singapore]].]] ===Cordon zones with congestion pricing=== {{Main|Congestion pricing}} Cordon zones have been implemented in [[Electronic Road Pricing|Singapore]], [[Stockholm congestion tax|Stockholm]], and [[London congestion charge|London]], where a [[congestion pricing|congestion charge]] or fee is collected from vehicles entering a congested city center. This fee or toll is charged automatically using [[electronic toll collection]] or [[automatic number plate recognition]], since stopping the users at conventional toll booths would cause long queues, long delays, and even [[gridlock]]. The main objective of this charge is to reduce traffic congestion within the cordon area. ===Automatic road enforcement=== {{Main|Traffic enforcement camera}} [[Image:BSB 04 2008 412 ETS.JPG|thumb|right|[[Traffic enforcement camera|Automatic speed enforcement]] gantry or "''Lombada Eletrônica''" with ground sensors at [[Brasilia|Brasilia, D.F]].]] A traffic enforcement camera system, consisting of a [[camera]] and a [[vehicle]]-monitoring device, is used to detect and identify vehicles disobeying a [[speed limit]] or some other road legal requirement and automatically ticket offenders based on the license plate number. Traffic tickets are sent by mail. Applications include: * Speed cameras that identify vehicles traveling over the legal [[speed limit]]. Many such devices use [[radar]] to detect a vehicle's speed or electromagnetic loops buried in each lane of the road. * [[Red light camera]]s that detect vehicles that cross a stop line or designated stopping place while a red [[traffic light]] is showing. * [[Bus lane]] cameras that identify vehicles traveling in lanes reserved for [[bus]]es. In some jurisdictions, bus lanes can also be used by taxis or vehicles engaged in [[car pooling]]. * [[Level crossing]] cameras that identify vehicles crossing [[railways]] [[at-grade intersection|at grade]] illegally. * Double white line cameras that identify vehicles crossing these lines. * [[High-occupancy vehicle lane]] cameras for that identify vehicles violating HOV requirements. * Turn cameras at intersections where specific turns are prohibited on red. This type of camera is mostly used in cities or heavy populated areas. ===Variable speed limits=== {{See|Speed limit#Variable speed limits}} [[Image:Variable speed limit.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Example variable speed limit sign in the United States.]] Recently some jurisdictions have begun experimenting with variable speed limits which change with road congestion and other factors. Typically such speed limits only change to decline during poor conditions, rather than being improved in good ones. One example is on Britain's [[M25 motorway]], which circumnavigates London. On the most heavily-traveled {{convert|14|mi|0|adj=on}} section (junction 10 to 16) of the M25 variable speed limits combined with automated enforcement have been in force since 1995. Initial results indicated savings in journey times, smoother-flowing traffic, and a fall in the number of accidents, so the implementation was made permanent in 1997. Further trials on the M25 have been thus far proved inconclusive.<ref>{{cite |url=http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/nao_reports/04-05/040515.pdf |title=Report (HC 15, 2004-05): Tackling congestion by making better use of England's motorways and trunk roads (Full Report) |publisher=[[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] |date=26 November 2004 |accessdate=2009-09-17 |format=PDF }}</ref> ===Collision avoidance systems=== Japan has installed sensors on its highways to notify motorists that a car is stalled ahead.<ref>[http://www.nilim.go.jp/english/conference/asia2006/8-6.pdf Trend in Road Accidents, Japan]</ref> ===Dynamic Traffic Light Sequence=== Intelligent [[RFID]] traffic control has been developed for dynamic [[traffic light]] sequence. It has circumvented or avoided the problems that usually arise with systems such as those, which use image processing and beam interruption techniques. [[RFID]] technology with appropriate [[algorithm]] and database were applied to a multi vehicle, multi lane and multi road junction area to provide an efficient time management scheme. A dynamic time schedule was worked out for the passage of each column. The simulation has shown that, the dynamic sequence [[algorithm]] has the ability to intelligently adjust itself even with the presence of some extreme cases. The real time operation of the system able to emulate the judgment of a traffic policeman on duty, by considering the number of vehicles in each column and the routing proprieties.<ref>[http://www.scipub.org/fulltext/jcs/jcs47517-524.pdf Dynamic Traffic Light Sequence, Science Publications]</ref> ==ITS World Congress== The [http://www.itsworldcongress.org/ World Congress and Exhibition on Intelligent Transport Systems] is an annual event, which rotates between Europe, the Americas and the Asia-Pacific region. The 18th ITS World Congress will be held in Orlando, FL, USA from 16&ndash;20, October 2011 with the theme 'Keeping the Economy Moving'. The 17th ITS World Congress, which took place at the Busan Exhibition & Convention Center from 25&ndash;29, October 2010, in Busan, Korea, centered on the theme, 'Ubiquitous Society with ITS'. The 16th annual event comes to Sweden for the first time and took place at [[Stockholm International Fairs]] from 21&ndash;25, September 2009. The theme of this prestigious event is ‘ITS in Daily Life’, exploring how ITS can improve everyday mobility with strong emphasis on co-modality. ==Cooperative systems on the road== {{Refimprovesect|date=May 2008}} Communication cooperation on the road includes car-to-car, car-to-infrastructure, and vice versa. Data available from vehicles is acquired and transmitted to a server for central fusion and processing. This data can be used to detect events such as rain (wiper activity) and congestion (frequent braking activities). The server processes a driving recommendation dedicated to a single or a specific group
