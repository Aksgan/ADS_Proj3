Arms of the United States: Criticisms and Rebuttals|accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref> It is officially used on documents such as [[United States passport]]s, military [[insignia]], [[Diplomatic mission|embassy]] [[placard]]s, and various [[Flags of the United States|flags]]. As a [[coat of arms]], the design has official colors; the physical Great Seal itself, as affixed to paper, is [[monochrome]]. Since 1935, both sides of the Great Seal have appeared on the reverse of the [[United States one-dollar bill|one-dollar bill]]. The [[Seal of the President of the United States]] is directly based on the Great Seal, and its elements are used in numerous government agency and state seals. ==Design== ===Obverse=== [[File:Coat of arms of the United States of America.svg|thumb|right|180px|<small>'''The central element of the Great Seal is used by itself by the United States Government, on letterheads, license plates, as an element of numerous other departmental seals of the United States Government, and perhaps most noticeably on the cover of the Passport of the United States'''</small>]] The design on the obverse (or front) of the seal is the coat of arms of the United States. The [[Shield (heraldry)|shield]], though sometimes drawn incorrectly, has two main differences from the [[flag of the United States|American flag]]. First, it has no stars on the blue [[chief (heraldry)|chief]] (though other arms based on it do: the chief of the [[Seal of the United States Senate|arms of the United States Senate]] may show 13 or 50, and the shield of the [[National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|9/11 Commission]] has, sometimes, 50 [[star (heraldry)|mullets]] on the [[chief (heraldry)|chief]]). Second, unlike the American flag, the outermost stripes are white, not red; so as not to violate the [[heraldry|heraldic]] [[rule of tincture]]. The [[supporter]] of the shield is a [[bald eagle]] with its wings outstretched (or "displayed," in [[heraldry|heraldic]] terms). From the eagle's perspective, it holds a bundle of 13 [[arrow]]s in its left [[talon]], (referring to the [[Thirteen Colonies|13 original states]]), and an [[olive branch]] in its right talon, together symbolizing that the United States of America has "a strong desire for peace, but will always be ready for war." (see [[Olive Branch Petition]]). Although not specified by law, the olive branch is usually depicted with 13 leaves and 13 olives, again representing the 13 original states. The eagle has its head turned towards the olive branch, said to symbolize a preference for peace. In its beak, the eagle clutches a scroll with the motto ''[[E pluribus unum]]'' ("Out of Many, One"). Over its head there appears a "[[Glory (optical phenomenon)|glory]]" with 13 [[star (heraldry)|mullets]] (stars) on a blue field. In the current (and several previous) dies of the great seal, the 13 stars above the eagle are arranged in rows of 1-4-3-4-1, forming a [[Star (symbol)#Six-pointed stars|six-pointed star]]. The [[1782]] resolution of [[Congress of the Confederation|Congress]] adopting the arms, still in force, legally [[blazon]]ed the shield as "Paleways of 13 pieces, [[argent]] and [[gules]]; a [[Chief (heraldry)|chief]], [[azure]]." As the designers recognized, this is a technically incorrect blazon under traditional English heraldic rules, since in English practice a vertically striped shield would be described as "[[Pale (heraldry)|paly]]", not "paleways", and it could not be striped of an uneven number. A more technically proper blazon would have been ''argent, six pallets gules...'' (six red stripes on a white field), but the phrase used was chosen to preserve the reference to the 13 original states. ===Reverse=== The 1782 resolution adopting the seal [[blazon]]s the image on the reverse as "A [[pyramid]] unfinished. In the zenith an eye in a triangle, surrounded by a glory, proper." The pyramid is conventionally shown as consisting of 13 layers to refer to the 13 original states. The adopting resolution provides that it is inscribed on its base with the date <small>MDCCLXXVI</small> ([[1776]]) in [[Roman numerals]]. Where the top of the pyramid should be, the [[Eye of Providence]] watches over it. Two mottos appear: ''[[Annuit c≈ìptis]]'' signifies that Providence has "approved of (our) undertakings."<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/ll/lljc/022/0300/03490339.gif Journals of the Continental Congress], June 20, 1782</ref> ''[[Novus ordo seclorum]]'', freely taken from [[Virgil]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greatseal.com/mottoes/seclorumvirgil.html |title=Source of NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM|publisher=greatseal.com|first= John D.|last=MacArthur}}</ref> is Latin for "a new order of the ages."<ref>The word ''seclorum'' does not mean "[[secular]]", as one might assume, but is the [[genitive]] (possessive) plural form of the word ''saeculum'', meaning (in this context) generation, century, or age. ''Saeculum'' did come to mean "age, world" in late, Christian, Latin, and "secular" is derived from it, through ''secularis''. However, the adjective "secularis," meaning "worldly," is not equivalent to the genitive plural ''seclorum'', meaning "of the ages."

He wrote: {{quote|The Escutcheon is composed of the chief & pale, the two most honorable ordinaries. The Pieces, paly, represent the several states all joined in one solid compact entire, supporting a Chief, which unites the whole & represents Congress. The Motto alludes to this union. The pales in the arms are kept closely united by the chief and the Chief depends upon that union & the strength resulting from it for its support, to denote the Confederacy of the United States of America & the preservation of their union through Congress. The colours of the pales are those used in the flag of the United States of America; White signifies purity and innocence, Red, hardiness & valor, and Blue, the colour of the Chief signifies vigilance, perseverance & justice. The Olive branch and arrows denote the power of peace & war which is exclusively vested in Congress. The Constellation denotes a new State taking its place and rank among other sovereign powers. The
