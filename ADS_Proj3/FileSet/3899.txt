[[software engine]] which is easily programmed in [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]] to create interactive applications. Contrarily to other tools on the market (such as [[Adobe Flash]] or [[Macromedia Director]]), Salto founding principle is to muse external sensors, beyond the traditional keyboard and mouse interaction devices. The tool is therefore mainly used in the [[edutainment]] domain, typically to create physical interaction setups for museums and amusement parks. Salto proposes a complete separation between technology and contents. The engine takes as argument an XML file which instantiates a particular application by describing: *First, the used sensors, along with the [[signal processing]] to be applied to the grabbed data. *Secondly, the necessary content elements (external resources stored on the hard drive). *Thirdly, the influence of the former ones on the later, i.e. the interactive scenario that makes the application. Programmers can also develop new [[plugin]]s in [[C++]] in order to extend the sensing and actuating features of the engine. ==External links== * [http://www.alterface.com Official website of Alterface, the company releasing Salto] [[Category:Proprietary software]] [[Category:User interface]] {{multimedia-software-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>33131</id> <title>Salute Picture</title> <text>{{Wikify|date=March 2009}}{{Unreferenced|date=March 2009}} A '''salute picture''' is a verification method used by many [[Social networking|social websites]] such as [[MySpace]](c), and GettinCool(c).

This statement is valid for all organisms, with or without a nervous system.<ref>Maturana, Humberto R./Varela, Francisco J. (1980): Autopoiesis and Cognition. The Realization of the Living. Dordrecht: Reidel, p. 13.</ref></blockquote>This theory contributes a perspective that cognition is a process present at other organic levels. The Santiago Theory of Cognition is a direct theoretical consequence of the theory of [[Autopoiesis]]. Cognition is considered as ''the ability of [[adaptation]] in a certain environment''. That definition is not as strange as it seems at first glance: for example, one is considered to have a good knowledge of Mathematics if he can understand and subsequently solve a Mathematical problem. That is, one can recognize the mathematical entities, their interrelations and the procedures used to view other aspects of the relevant phenomena; all these, are the domain of Mathematics. And one with knowledge of that domain, is one adapted to that domain, for he can tweak the problems, the entities and the procedures within the certain domain. Cognition emerges as a consequence of continuous interaction between the [[system]] and its environment. The continuous interaction triggers bilateral [[Perturbation (biology)|perturbation]]s; perturbations are considered [[problem]]s - therefore the system uses its functional differentiation procedures to come up with a [[solution]] (if it doesn't have one handy
