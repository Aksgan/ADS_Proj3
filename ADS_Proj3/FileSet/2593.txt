Ltd.]] implemented an AMR pilot project for [[Saudi Electricity Company]] in 2006. The project was located in the city of Jeddah on the west coast of Saudi Arabia. Digital [[KWh]] meters were installed in parallel with analog KWh meters. Readings taken by the Saudi Electricity Company showed variations of less than 1%. A BPL pilot project was included.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://powerlinesco.com |title=Powerlines Communications |publisher=Powerlinesco.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-29}}</ref><ref>http://powerlinesco.com.sa/Pictures/Downloads/PCC-brochure.pdf</ref> *** [[Saudi Arabian Computer Management Consultants]] (SACMAC) has signed a deal to become an official system integrator and distributor for [[Mitsubishi]] PLC. It is expected to become a great success, because the existing broadband service, monopolized by the [[Saudi Telecom Company]], is expensive and has poor customer service (some clients report that company techs arrive months after ordering). SACMAC has declined to talk about specifics of availability and price but says it will start rolling out the service in a few months (as of May 2006) and its price will be lower than current broadband providers. === Concluded deployments === The following deployments have ended: * Australia, [[Tasmania]]: In November 2007, electricity retailer [[Aurora Energy]] ended its involvement with BPL and announced it was switching to [[Optical Fiber]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.auroraenergy.com.au/news/default.asp?file=27-november-2007.txt |title=Aurora shifts focus to fibre in telecommunications strategy |publisher=Auroraenergy.com.au |date= |accessdate=2009-04-29}}</ref> This ended their commercial trial begun in September 2005, offering BPL services to 500 homes in the suburb of [[Tolmans Hill, Tasmania|Tolmans Hill]] near Hobart, which had followed a successful technological trial earlier that year.<ref>[http://www.tastel.com.au/bpl/index.html TasTel BPL: home of Broadband Over Powerlines]{{dead link|date=April 2009}}</ref> * Portugal ended BPL/PLC deployments in the country in October 2006, reportedly for economic reasons.<ref>[http://tek.sapo.pt/4O0/701371.html ]{{dead link|date=April 2009}}</ref> ,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arrl.org/?artid=7046 |title=ARRLWeb: ARRL Home Page |publisher=Arrl.org |date=2006-12-20 |accessdate=2009-04-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arrl.org/tis/info/HTML/plc/other-articles-archive.html#2006 |title=ARRLWeb: Broadband Over Power Line (BPL) and Amateur Radio |publisher=Arrl.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-29}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> * [[Russia|Russian Federation]]: In September 2008, Russia's only BPL provider Electro-com ended deployments in Moscow for economic reasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e-xecutive.ru/news/news/845545/ |title=E-xecutive — Провайдер «Электро-ком» отказался от попытки развивать интернет через электросеть в Москве |publisher=E-xecutive.ru |date=2007-03-29 |accessdate=2009-04-29}}</ref> * Spain: In May 2007 [[Iberdrola]] and [[Endesa]] (the main power companies in Spain) ended their projects to deploy PLC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.expansion.com/edicion/exp/empresas/telecomunicaciones/es/desarrollo/999533.html |title=Iberdrola y Endesa frenan el lanzamiento de la telefonía a través de la red eléctrica — Expansión.com |publisher=Expansion.com |date=2007-05-29 |accessdate=2009-04-29}}</ref> * United States: As of April 2007, [[Motorola]] has shuttered its Powerline LV Access BPL and reportedly plans to re-purpose the technology to a new system called Powerline MU,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arrl.org/news/stories/2007/04/25/102/ |title=ARRLWeb: Motorola Suspends Powerline LV BPL Development |publisher=Arrl.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-29}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> which is for use within multiple-unit dwellings. Motorola's system uses only residential-side low-voltage power lines for transmission to reduce the antenna effect, and successfully demonstrated frequency-notching for reduced potential for interference over the [[Amperion Inc.]] and [[Current Technologies LLC]] systems. Motorola invited the [[American Radio Relay League]] to participate with these tests,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.arrl.org/news/stories/2005/08/29/1/ |title=ARRLWeb: BPL at HQ: ARRL Cooperating in BPL System Experiment |publisher=.arrl.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-29}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> and even installed the Motorola system at their headquarters. Preliminary results were very positive with regard to interference, because the Motorola system does not use BPL on the powerlines leading up to the neighborhood. The BPL carrier is only used for the last leg of the trip from the pole to the house, and gets the signal to the pole via radio. This limits the interference to the area surrounding the last leg to the house. ** The following other BPL deployments in the US are dismantled as of May 2008:<ref name="p1k.arrl.org">{{cite web|url=http://p1k.arrl.org/~ehare/bpl/ex2.html |title=BPL Database and Interference Information: U.S |publisher=P1k.arrl.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-29}}</ref> {| class="wikitable" border="1" |- !
