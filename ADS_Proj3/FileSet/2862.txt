doppler''': Doppler information is sampled along a line through the body, and all velocities detected at each time point is presented (on a time line) **'''Pulsed wave (PW) doppler''': Doppler information is sampled from only a small sample volume (defined in 2D image), and presented on a timeline **'''Duplex''': a common name for the simultaneous presentation of 2D and (usually) PW doppler information. (Using modern ultrasound machines color doppler is almost always also used, hence the alternative name '''Triplex'''.) Midwives generally use this type of system. ==Expansions== An additional expansion or additional technique of ultrasound is '''biplanar ultrasound''', in which the probe has two 2D planes that are perpendicular to each other, providing more efficient localization and detection.<ref name=reves/> Furthermore, an '''omniplane''' probe is one that can rotate 180° to obtain multiple images.<ref name=reves> Page 161 (part II > Two-dimensional Echocardiography) in: {{cite book |author=Reves, J.

In [[contrast-enhanced ultrasound]], microbubble contrast agents enhance the ultrasound waves, resulting in increased contrast. === Doppler sonography === {{Seealso|Doppler echocardiography}} [[Image:SpectralDopplerA.jpg|thumb|right|Spectral Doppler of Common Carotid Artery]] [[Image:ColourDopplerA.jpg|thumb|right|Colour Doppler of Common Carotid Artery]] [[Image:Doppler ultrasound analyzer of blood velocity.jpg|thumb|right|Computer-enhanced [[transcranial doppler]].]] Sonography can be enhanced with Doppler measurements, which employ the [[Doppler effect]] to assess whether structures (usually blood) are moving towards or away from the probe, and its relative velocity. By calculating the frequency shift of a particular sample volume, for example flow in an artery or a jet of blood flow over a heart valve, its speed and direction can be determined and visualised. This is particularly useful in cardiovascular studies (sonography of the vascular system and heart) and essential in many areas such as determining reverse blood flow in the liver vasculature in [[portal hypertension]]. The Doppler information is displayed graphically using spectral Doppler, or as an image using [[color Doppler]] (directional Doppler) or [[power Doppler]] (non directional Doppler). This Doppler shift falls in the audible range and is often presented audibly using stereo speakers: this produces a very distinctive, although synthetic, pulsating sound. Most modern sonographic machines use pulsed Doppler to measure velocity. Pulsed wave machines transmit and receive series of pulses. The frequency shift of each pulse is ignored, however the relative phase changes of the pulses are used to obtain the frequency shift (since frequency is the rate of change of phase). The major advantages of pulsed Doppler over continuous wave is that distance information is obtained (the time between the transmitted and received pulses can be converted into a distance with knowledge of the speed of sound) and gain correction is applied. The disadvantage of pulsed Doppler is that the measurements can suffer from [[aliasing]]. The terminology "Doppler ultrasound" or "Doppler sonography", has been accepted to apply to both pulsed and continuous Doppler systems despite the different mechanisms by which the velocity is measured. It should be noted here that there are no standards for the display of color Doppler. Some laboratories insist on showing arteries as red and veins as blue, as medical illustrators usually show them, even though, as a result, a tortuous vessel may have portions with flow toward and away relative to the transducer. This can result in the illogical appearance of blood flow that appears to be in both directions in the same vessel. Other laboratories use red to indicate flow toward the transducer and blue away from the transducer which is the reverse of 150 years of astronomical literature on the [[Doppler effect]]. Still other laboratories prefer to display the sonographic Doppler color map more in accord with the prior published physics with the [[red shift]] representing longer waves of echoes (scattered) from blood flowing away from the transducer; and with blue representing the shorter waves of echoes reflecting from blood flowing toward the transducer. Because of this confusion and lack of standards in the various laboratories, the sonographer must understand the underlying acoustic physics of color Doppler and the physiology of normal and abnormal blood flow in the human body.<ref name=" Red Shift">{{cite web | title=Wikipedia: “Red Shift” | url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift| accessdate=January 25, 2008}}</ref><!-- --><ref name=" Flat and Curved Space-Times ">{{cite web | title= Ellis, George FR, Williams, Ruth M.; “Flat and Curved Space-Times“ 2nd Edition; Oxford University Press, 2000” | url= http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0198506562 | accessdate=January 25, 2008}}</ref><ref name=" Confusion and Direction in Diagnostic Doppler Sonography">{{cite web | title= DuBose TJ, Baker AL; “Confusion and Direction in Diagnostic Doppler Sonography “| url= http://jdm.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/25/3/173/ref=sib_dp_ptu#reader-link | accessdate=January 25, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref name=" Doppler Ultrasound History ">{{cite web | title= “Doppler Ultrasound History” | url=http://www.obgyn.net/ultrasound/ultrasound.asp?page=feature/doppler_history/history_ultrasound | accessdate=January 25, 2008}}</ref> === Contrast media === {{Main|Contrast-enhanced ultrasound}} The use of microbubble contrast media in medical sonography to improve ultrasound signal [[backscatter]] is known as [[contrast-enhanced ultrasound]]. This technique is currently used in [[echocardiography]], and may have future applications in molecular imaging and drug delivery. === Compression ultrasonography === Compression ultrasonography is a technique used for diagnosing [[deep vein thrombosis]] and combines ultrasonography of the deep veins with venous compression.<ref name=medscape>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/410882_2 medscape.com > The Diagnostic Approach to Deep Venous Thrombosis: Diagnostic Tests for Deep Vein Thrombosis] Semin Respir Crit Care Med. 2000;21(6). 2000 Thieme Medical Publishers</ref> The technique can be used on deep veins of the upper and lower extremities, with some laboratories limiting the examination to the [[common femoral vein]] and the [[popliteal vein]], whereas other laboratories examine the deep veins from the inguinal region to the calf, including the calf veins.<ref name=medscape/> Compression ultrasonography in B-mode has both high [[sensitivity and specificity]] for detecting proximal deep vein thrombosis in symptomatic patients. The sensitivity lies somewhere between 90 to 100% for the diagnosis of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis, and the specificity ranges between 95 to 100%.<ref name=medscape/> ==Attributes== As with all imaging modalities, ultrasonography has its list of positive and negative attributes. ===Strengths
