Various aspects of OSI design evolved from experiences with the ARPANET, the fledgling Internet, NPLNET, EIN, [[CYCLADES]] network and the work in IFIP WG6.1. The new design was documented in ISO 7498 and its various addenda. In this model, a networking system is divided into layers. Within each layer, one or more entities implement its functionality. Each entity interacts directly only with the layer immediately beneath it, and provides facilities for use by the layer above it. Protocols enable an entity in one host to interact with a corresponding entity at the same layer in another host. Service definitions abstractly describe the functionality provided to an (N)-layer by an (N-1) layer, where N is one of the seven layers of protocols operating in the local host. ==Description of OSI layers== According to recommendation X.200, there are seven layers, each generically known as an N layer. An N+1 entity requests services from the N entity. At each level, two entities (N-entity peers) interact by means of the N protocol by transmitting [[protocol data unit]]s (PDU). A [[Service Data Unit]] (SDU) is a specific unit of data that has been passed down from an OSI layer to a lower layer, and which the lower layer has not yet encapsulated into a protocol data unit (PDU). An SDU is a set of data that is sent by a user of the services of a given layer, and is transmitted semantically unchanged to a peer service user. The PDU at any given layer, layer N, is the SDU of the layer below, layer N-1. In effect the SDU is the 'payload' of a given PDU. That is, the process of changing a SDU to a PDU, consists of an encapsulation process, performed by the lower layer. All the data contained in the SDU becomes encapsulated within the PDU. The layer N-1 adds headers or footers, or both, to the SDU, transforming it into a PDU of layer N-1. The added headers or footers are part of the process used to make it possible to get data from a source to a destination. {| class="wikitable" style="float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;" |- ! colspan="5" | OSI Model |- ! !Data unit !Layer !style="width:9em;"|Function |- !rowspan="4"|Host<br />layers | style="background:#d8ec9b;" rowspan="3"|Data | style="background:#d8ec9b;"| 7.

[[Security service (telecommunication)|Security services]] are not related to a specific layer: they can be related by a number of layers, as defined by [[ITU-T]] X.800 Recommendation.<ref>[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.800-199103-I/e X.800 : Security architecture for Open Systems Interconnection for CCITT applications]</ref> These services are aimed to improve the [[Information Security|CIA triad]] (i.e.[[confidentiality]], [[integrity]], [[availability]]) of transmitted data. Actually the availability of communication service is determined by [[network design]] and/or [[network management]] protocols. Appropriate choices for these are needed to protect against [[denial of service]]. ===Layer 1: Physical Layer=== The [[Physical Layer]] defines the [[electrical]] and physical specifications for devices. In particular, it defines the relationship between a device and a [[transmission medium]], such as a copper or optical cable. This includes the layout of [[Lead (electronics)|pins]], [[voltage]]s, [[cable]] [[specification]]s, [[network hub|hub]]s, [[repeater]]s, [[network card|network adapter]]s, [[host adapter|host bus adapter]]s (HBA used in [[storage area network]]s) and more. To understand the function of the Physical Layer, contrast it with the functions of the Data Link Layer. Think of the Physical Layer as concerned primarily with the interaction of a single device with a medium, whereas the Link Layer is concerned more with the interactions of multiple devices (i.e., at least two) with a shared medium. Standards such as [[RS-232]] do use physical wires to control access to the medium. The major functions and services performed by the Physical Layer are: *Establishment and termination of a [[electrical connector|connection]] to a [[communication]]s [[transmission medium|medium]]. *Participation in the process whereby the communication resources are effectively shared among multiple users. For example, [[Contention (computer networking)|contention]] resolution and [[flow control]]. *[[Modulation]], or conversion between the representation of [[digital data]] in user equipment and the corresponding signals transmitted over a communications [[channel (communications)|channel]]. These are signals operating over the physical cabling (such as copper and [[optical fiber]]) or over a [[electromagnetic wave#Radio waves|radio link]]. [[Parallel SCSI]] buses operate in this layer, although it must be remembered that the logical [[SCSI]] protocol is a Transport Layer protocol that runs over this bus. Various Physical Layer Ethernet standards are also in this layer; Ethernet incorporates both this layer and the Data Link Layer. The same applies to other local-area networks, such as [[IBM token ring|token ring]], [[fiber distributed data interface|FDDI]], [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] and [[IEEE 802.11]], as well as personal area networks such as [[Bluetooth]] and [[IEEE 802.15#Task group 4 (Low Rate WPAN)|IEEE 802.15.4]]. ===Layer 2: Data Link Layer=== The [[Data Link Layer]] provides the functional and procedural means to transfer data between network entities and to detect and possibly correct errors that may occur in the Physical Layer. Originally, this layer was intended for point-to-point and point-to-multipoint media, characteristic of wide area media
