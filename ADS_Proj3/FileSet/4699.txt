[[Image:Virtual address space and physical address space relationship.svg|thumb|300px]] ==Description== The term ''virtual address'' is most commonly used for an address pointing to [[virtual memory]] or, in networking, when referring to a virtual network address. Virtual memory may be simulated by a hard disk, allowing an application to operate as though the computer has more physical memory than actually installed. ==See also== * [[Page table]] * [[Physical address]] * [[Mail Drop]] * [[Virtual office]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Virtual Address}} [[Category:Virtual memory]] [[Category:Computer memory]] {{Compu-storage-stub}} [[de:Virtuelle Adresse]]</text> </page> <page> <id>39520</id> <title>Virtual tape library</title> <text>A '''virtual tape library''' ('''VTL''') is a [[computer storage|data storage]] [[Storage virtualization|virtualization]] technology used typically for backup and recovery purposes. A VTL presents a storage component (usually hard disk storage) as [[tape library|tape libraries]] or [[tape drive]]s for use with existing backup software. Virtualizing the disk storage as tape allows integration of VTLs with existing [[backup software]] and existing backup and recovery processes and policies. The benefits of such virtualization include storage consolidation and faster data restore processes. Most current VTL solutions use [[Parallel ATA|PATA]] or [[SATA]] [[disk array]]s as the primary storage component due to their relatively low cost. The use of array enclosures increases the scalability of the solution by allowing the addition of more disk drives and enclosures to increase the storage capacity. The shift to VTL also eliminates streaming problems that often impair efficiency in tape drives as disk technology does not rely on streaming and can write effectively regardless of data transfer speeds. By backing up data to disks instead of tapes, VTL often increases performance of both backup and recovery operations. Restore processes are found to be faster than backup regardless of implementations. In some cases, the data stored on the VTL's disk array is exported to other media, such as physical tapes, for [[disaster recovery]] purposes (scheme called ''disk-to-disk-to-tape'', or ''D2D2T''). Alternatively, most contemporary backup software products introduce also direct usage of the [[file system]] storage (especially [[network-attached storage]], accessed through [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]] and [[CIFS]] protocols over [[Internet Protocol|IP]] networks) not requiring a tape library emulation at all. They also often offer a [[disk staging]] feature: moving the data from disk to a physical tape for a long-term storage. While a virtual tape library is very fast, the disk storage within is not designed to be removable, and does not usually involve physically removable external disk drives to be used for data archiving in place of tape. Since the disk storage is always connected to power and data sources and is never physically electrically isolated, it is vulnerable to potential damage and corruption due to nearby building or power grid lightning strikes. ==History== The first VTL solution was an IBM Virtual Tape Server (VTS) introduced in 1997. It was targeted for a [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] market, where many legacy applications tend to use a lot of very short tape volumes. It used [[ESCON]] interface, and acted as a disk cache for [[IBM 3494|3494]] tape library. A competitive offering from StorageTek (acquired in 2005 by SUN Microsystems, then subsequently by Oracle Corporation) was known as Virtual Storage Manager (VSM) which leveraged the market dominant STK Powderhorn library as a back store. Each product line has been enhanced to support larger disk buffer capacities, FICON, and more recently (c. 2010) "tapeless" disk-only environments. Other offerings in the mainframe space are also "tapeless". DLm has been developed by EMC Corporation, while Luminex has gained popularity and wide acceptance by teaming with Data Domain to provide the benefits of [[data deduplication]] behind its Channel Gateway platform. With the consequent reduction in off-site replication bandwidth afforded by deduplication, it is possible and practical for this form of virtual tape to reduce [[ Recovery Point Objective ]] /RPO and [[ Recovery Time Objective]] /RTO to approaching zero (or instantaneous). Outside of [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] environment, tape drives and libraries mostly featured [[SCSI]]. Likewise, VTLs were developed supporting popular SCSI transport protocols such as [[SCSI Parallel Interface|SPI]] (legacy systems), [[Fibre Channel]], and [[iSCSI]]. The VTLs currently being adopted by Open Systems (including AS400 series) are dominated by [[FalconStor|FalconStor Software Inc.]] The FalconStor VTL is the foundation of nearly half of the products sold in the VTL market, according to an Enterprise Strategy Group analyst.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infostor.com/index/articles/display/9694734941/s-articles/s-infostor/s-volume-13/s-issue_3/s-New_Analysis___Trends/s-VTLs__Going_beyond_data_de-dupe.html/|title=InfoStor ESG Report on FalconStor Virtual Tape Library}}</ref> == See also == *[[Backup]] *[[Tape library]] *[[Disk staging]] for an alternative approach *[[Emulation]] *[[Storage virtualization]] *[[Linux Virtual Tape Library (Open Source)]] ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Tape-based computer storage]] [[Category:Computer backup]] [[de:Virtual-Tape-Library]] [[fr:Virtual Tape Library]] [[ru:Виртуальная ленточная библиотека]]</text> </page> <page> <id>39525</id> <title>Virtuoso Universal Server</title> <text>{{Multiple issues|advert=March 2009|external links=October 2009|citations missing=October 2009}} {{Infobox software | name = Virtuoso Universal Server | logo = [[File:virtuoso-logo-sm.png]] | screenshot = [[File:conductor-sm.png|250px]] | caption = Virtuoso Conductor (Database Administration User Interface) | developer = [[OpenLink Software]] | released = |
