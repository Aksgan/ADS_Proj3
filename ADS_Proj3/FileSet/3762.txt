his or her next movie. The baseball player with the greatest batting average by the All-Star break is more likely to have a lower average than a higher average over the second half of the season. === Misunderstandings=== The concept of regression toward the mean can be misused very easily. In the student test example above, it was assumed implicitly that what was being measured did not change between the two measurements. But suppose it was a pass/fail course and you had to score above 70 on both tests to pass. Then the students who scored under 70 the first time would have no incentive to do well, and might score worse on average the second time. The students just over 70, on the other hand, would have a strong incentive to study overnight and concentrate while taking the test. In that case you might see movement ''away'' from 70, scores below it getting lower and scores above it getting higher. It is possible for changes between the measurement times to augment, offset or reverse the statistical tendency to regress toward the mean. Statistical regression toward the mean is not a [[causality|causal]] phenomenon. A student with the worst score on the test on the first day will not necessarily increase her score substantially on the second day due to the effect. On average the worst scorers improve, but that's only true because the worst scorers are more likely to have been unlucky than lucky. To the extent that a score is determined randomly, or that a score has random variation or error, as opposed to being determined by the student's academic ability or being a "true value", the phenomenon will have an effect. A classic mistake in this regard was in education. The students that received praise for good work were noticed to do more poorly on the next measure, and the students who were punished for poor work were noticed to do better on the next measure. The educators decided to stop praising and keep punishing on this basis. Such a decision was a mistake, because regression toward the mean is not based on cause and effect, but rather on random error in a natural distribution around a mean.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Although individual measurements regress toward the mean, the second [[Sampling (statistics)|sample]] of measurements will be no closer to the mean than the first. Consider the students again. Suppose their tendency is to regress 10% of the way toward the [[mean]] of 80, so a student who scored 100 the first day is [[Expected value|expected]] to score 98 the second day, and a student who scored 70 the first day is [[Expected value|expected]] to score 71 the second day. Those expectations are closer to the mean, on average, than the first day scores. But the second day scores will vary around their expectations, some will be higher and some will be lower. This will make the second set of measurements farther from the mean, on average, than their expectations. The effect is the exact reverse of regression toward the mean, and exactly offsets it. So for every individual, we expect the second score to be closer to the mean than the first score, but for ''all'' individuals, we expect the average distance from the mean to be the same on both sets of measurements. Related to the point above, regression toward the mean works equally well in both directions. We expect the student with the highest test score on the second day to have done worse on the first day. And if we compare the best student on the first day to the best student on the second day, regardless of whether it is the same individual or not, there is a tendency to regress toward the mean going in either direction. We [[Expected value|expect]] the best scores on both days to be equally far from the mean. === Regression fallacies === {{Main|regression fallacy}} Many phenomena tend to be attributed to the wrong causes when regression to the mean is not taken into account. An extreme example is Horace Secrist’s 1933 book ''The Triumph of Mediocrity in Business'', in which the statistics professor collected mountains of data to prove that the profit rates of competitive businesses tend toward the average over time. In fact, there is no such effect; the variability of profit rates is almost constant over time. Secrist had only described the common regression toward the mean. One exasperated reviewer, [[Harold Hotelling]], likened the book to “proving the multiplication table by arranging elephants in rows and columns, and then doing the same for numerous other kinds of animals”.<ref>Hotelling, H. (1933). Review of The triumph of mediocrity in business by Secrist, H., ''Journal of the American Statistical Association'', 28, 433–435.</ref> The calculation and interpretation of “improvement scores” on standardized educational tests in Massachusetts probably provides another example of the regression fallacy. In 1999, schools were given improvement goals. For each school, the Department of Education tabulated the difference in the average score achieved by students in 1999 and in 2000. It was quickly noted that most of the worst-performing schools had met their goals, which the Department of Education took as confirmation of the soundness of their policies. However, it was also noted that many of the supposedly best schools in the Commonwealth, such as Brookline High School (with 18 National Merit Scholarship finalists) were declared to have failed. As in many cases involving statistics and public policy, the issue is debated, but “improvement scores” were not announced in subsequent years and the findings appear to be a case of regression to the mean. The psychologist [[Daniel Kahneman]], winner of the 2002 [[Nobel prize in economics]], pointed out that regression to the mean might explain why rebukes can seem to improve performance, while praise seems to backfire.<ref>[http://nobelprize.virtual.museum/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2002/kahneman-autobio.html Daniel Kahneman’s autobiography]</ref> {{cquote|I had the most satisfying Eureka experience of my career while attempting to teach flight instructors that praise is more effective than punishment for promoting skill-learning.
