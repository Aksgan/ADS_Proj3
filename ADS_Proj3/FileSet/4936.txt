The format is based on the [[LZW]] compression algorithm and compressed files are identified by the .zoo file extension. It is no longer widely used. Program source code was originally published on the comp.sources.misc [[Usenet]] newsgroup, and was compatible with a variety of [[Unix-like]] operating systems. Binaries were also published for the [[MS-DOS]] user community. A small companion program was also developed, entitled '''booz''', that provides only decompression functionality. {{Fact|date=January 2009}} The .ZOO file format was mostly popular with [[Digital Equipment Corporation|Digital]] (now [[Hewlett Packard]]) [[VAX]] computers running the [[OpenVMS]] operating system, and for a time with the Commodore [[Amiga]] community. {{Fact|date=January 2009}} == Zoo features == Zoo archives can store multiple "generations" of a file; if files are added to an archive with the same pathname yet more recent date, if generations are enabled for the archive the older version(s) will be retained (with a semicolon and version number, similar to version numbers in the VMS and RT-11 operating systems) as the new file is added. This allows files that are frequently modified to be backed up in such a way as to allow access to previous versions (up to the '''version limit''' chosen) from one archive. == External links == * [http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/utils/compress/zoo-2.10-3.src.rpm zoo 2.10 source] * [http://archives.math.utk.edu/software/multi-platform/gap/util/ unzoo] - zoo archive extractor, source included {{Archive formats}} [[Category:Data compression]] [[Category:Archive formats]] [[ja:ZOO (ファイルフォーマット)]] [[ru:Zoo (формат файлов)]] {{software-type-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>41125</id> <title>Zooniverse (citizen science project)</title> <text>'''Zooniverse''' is a [[citizen science]] portal that has grown from the original [[Galaxy Zoo]] project.

It is included as part of the [[Zope]] web [[application server]], but can also be used independently of Zope. Features of the ZODB include: transactions, history/undo, transparently pluggable storage, built-in caching, multiversion concurrency control (MVCC), and scalability across a network (using ZEO). The ZODB is a mature Python datastore that has hundreds of thousands of systems today running on top of it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} ==History== * Created by Jim Fulton of Zope Corporation in the late 90s. * Started as simple Persistent Object System (POS) during Principia development (which later became Zope) * The persistence from ZODB leverages ExtensionClass which was the precursor to current Python metaclass implementation * ZODB 3 was renamed when a significant architecture change was landed. * ZODB 4 was a short lived project to re-implement the entire ZODB 3 package using 100% Python. ==ZEO== ZEO (Zope Enterprise Objects) is a ZODB storage implementation that allows multiple client processes to persist objects to a single ZEO server. This allows transparent scaling, but the ZEO server is still a single point of failure. ==Pluggable Storages== * Network Storage (aka ZEO) - Enables multiple python processes load and store persistent instances concurrently. * File Storage - Enables a single python process to talk to a file on disk. * relstorage - Enables the persistence backing store to be a [[RDBMS]]. * Directory Storage - Each persistent data is stored as a separate file on the filesystem. Similar to FSFS in [[Subversion (software)|Subversion]]. * Demo Storage - An in-memory back end for the persistent store. * BDBStorage - Which uses [[Berkeley DB]] back end. Now abandoned. Failover Technologies * Zope Replication Services (ZRS) - A commercial add-on that removes the single point of failure, providing hot backup for writes and load-balancing for reads. * zeoraid - An open source solution that provides a proxy Network Server that distributes object stores and recovery across a series of Network Servers. * relstorage - since RDBMS technologies are used this obviates need for ZEO server. * NEO - Distributed (fault tolerance, load-balancing) storage implementation. Not ready for production use yet (as of 01/2011). ==See also== * [[Object database]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.python.org/workshops/2000-01/proceedings/papers/fulton/zodb3.html Introduction to the Zope Object Database] * [http://wiki.zope.org/ZODB/guide/index.html ZODB/ZEO Programming Guide] [[Category:Open source database management systems]] [[Category:Cross-platform software]] [[Category:Object-oriented database management systems]] {{Database-software-stub}} [[de:Zope Object Database]] [[el:Βάση δεδομένων Zope]] [[fr:ZODB]] [[it:Zope Object Database]] [[ja:Zope Object
