These emails contain malicious attachments, that when opened, drop a Trojan horse on to the system. This Trojan connects back to a control server, usually located in China, to receive commands. The infected computer will then execute the command specified by the control server. Occasionally, the command specified by the control server will cause the infected computer to download and install a [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan]] known as [[Gh0st Rat]] that allows attackers to gain complete, real-time control of computers running Microsoft Windows.<ref name="nato"/> Such a computer can be controlled or inspected by attackers, and even has the ability to turn on camera and audio-recording functions of infected computers, enabling monitors to perform surveillance.<ref name="NY-TIMES"/> ==Origin== The researchers from the IWM stated they could not conclude that the Chinese government was responsible for the spy network.<ref name=uoft>[http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/ghostnet.pdf Tracking GhostNet: Investigating a Cyber Espionage Network].

By using the email addresses provided by the IWM report, [[Scott J. Henderson]] had managed to trace one of the operators of one of the infections (non-Ghostnet) to [[Chengdu]]. He identifies the hacker as a 27-year-old man who had attended the [[University of Electronic Science and Technology of China]], and currently connected with the Chinese hacker [[Subculture|underground]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Henderson|first=Scott|publication-date=April 2, 2009|title=Hunting the GhostNet Hacker|url=http://www.thedarkvisitor.com/2009/04/hunting-the-ghostnet-hacker/|publisher = The Dark Visitor|accessdate=April 2, 2009}}</ref> Despite the lack of evidence to pinpoint the Chinese government as responsible for intrusions against Tibetan-related targets, researchers at Cambridge have found actions taken by Chinese government officials that corresponded with the information obtained via computer instrusions. One such incident involved a diplomat who was pressured by Beijing after receiving an email invitation to a visit with the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] from his representatives.<ref name="snoop"/> Another incident involved a Tibetan woman who was interrogated by Chinese intelligence officers and was shown transcripts of her online conversations.<ref name=uoft>[http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/ghostnet.pdf Tracking GhostNet: Investigating a Cyber Espionage Network].

Drelwa uses QQ and other instant messengers to communicate with Chinese Internet users. In 2008, IWM found that TOM-Skype, the Chinese version of Skype, was logging and storing text messages exchanged between users. It is possible that the Chinese authorities acquired the chat transcripts through this means.<ref>[http://www.nartv.org/mirror/breachingtrust.pdf]</ref> IWM researchers have also found that when detected, GhostNet is consistently controlled from IP addresses located on the island of [[Hainan]], China, and have pointed out that Hainan is home to the Lingshui signals intelligence facility and the Third Technical Department of the People’s Liberation Army.<ref name="nato"/> Furthermore, one of GhostNet's four control servers has been revealed to be a government server.<ref>http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/meet-the-canadians-who-busted-ghostnet/article732409/ Meet the Canadians who busted Ghostnet] [[Globe and Mail]] Martch 29, 2009</ref> The Chinese embassy in London has denied the involvement of its government, stating that there is no evidence that his government was involved.
