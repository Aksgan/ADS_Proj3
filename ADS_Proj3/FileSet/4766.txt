The incident occurred during a routine fire system inspection. During the inspection, a mistake was made that triggered the release of Inergen, causing damage to servers. WestHost initially stated that the problem was caused by an issue with Sphera [[Hardware virtualization|virtualization]] software and could be fixed in less than 6 hours. However, when the downtime for some websites surpassed 48 hours, several WestHost users became increasingly vocal, citing poor communication from the company<ref>[http://forums.westhost.com/showthread.php?t=14067 WestHost Community Forums]</ref>. At this point, Jeff Hunsaker, President of WestHost parent company UK2 Group, provided a more detailed explanation and apologized for inaccurate information given by support staff. Although the websites for most customers were back online by the time of his letter, he stated that they were still in the process of restoring data from backups and some users might experience over 6 days of downtime<ref>[http://members.westhost.com/outages.php Members Area | Westhost]</ref>. A few days after the beginning of the outage, some users began to wonder if WestHost was being honest about the cause of the problem. The speculation began when a [[Twitter]] user noticed that the Wikipedia article for Inergen was edited to indicate that Inergen can damage hard drives<ref>[http://twitter.com/esawdust/statuses/9511827694 Twitter / ESawdust]</ref>. The edit took place shortly after the start of the service outage. Previous to the edit, the article made no mention of possible damage to server equipment. Furthermore, the IP address was traced back to UK2 Group. Soon after, the CEO of UK2 Group came forward and confirmed rumors about the edit: "Yes, we added that - I feel we had the proof to do so, and it was only fair to warn others. Can you blame us?"<ref>[http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showpost.php?p=6664048&postcount=28 Web Hosting Talk - Inergen vs. Water in Server Room?]</ref> The speculation intensified when a WestHost customer talked to a Inergen vendor who stated that it was highly unlikely that Inergen would cause the damages reported by WestHost<ref>[http://forums.westhost.com/showpost.php?p=47300&postcount=303 WestHost Community Forums | #303]</ref>.
