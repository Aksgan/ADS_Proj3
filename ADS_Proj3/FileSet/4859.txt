capacity and multitasking capability. They are optimized for the [[Visualization (computer graphics)|visualization]] and manipulation of different types of complex data such as 3D mechanical design, engineering simulation (e.g. [[computational fluid dynamics]]), animation and rendering of images, and mathematical plots. Consoles consist of a high resolution display, a [[computer keyboard|keyboard]] and a [[Mouse (computer)|mouse]] at a minimum, but also offer multiple displays, [[graphics tablet]]s, 3D mice (devices for manipulating and navigating 3D objects and scenes), etc. Workstations are the first segment of the computer market to present advanced accessories and [[videoconferencing|collaboration tools]]. Presently, the workstation market is highly [[Commoditization|commoditized]] and is dominated by large PC vendors, such as [[Dell]] and [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], selling [[Microsoft Windows]]/[[Linux]] running on Intel [[Xeon]]/AMD [[Opteron]]. Alternative UNIX based platforms are provided by [[Apple Inc.]], [[Sun Microsystems]], and [[Silicon Graphics International|SGI]]. ==Workstations in particular== In the early 1980s, a high-end workstation had to meet the three Ms, the so-called "[[3M computer]]" had a '''M'''egabyte of memory, a '''M'''egapixel display (roughly 1000x1000), and a "[[megaflop|'''M'''egaFLOPS]]" compute performance (at least one million floating point operations per second).<ref>RFC 782 defined the workstation environment more generally as ''hardware and software dedicated to serve a single user'', and that it provide for the use of additional shared resources.</ref> As limited as this seems today, it was at least an order of magnitude beyond the capacity of the personal computer of the time; the original 1981 [[IBM PC]] had 16 KB memory, a text-only display, and floating-point performance around 1 kiloFLOPS (30 kiloFLOPS with the optional 8087 math coprocessor). Other desirable features not found in desktop computers at that time included networking, graphics acceleration, and high-speed internal and peripheral data buses. Another goal was to bring the price for such a system down under a "'''M'''egapenny", that is, less than $10,000; this was not achieved until the late 1980s, although many workstations, particularly mid-range or high-end still cost anywhere from $15,000 to $100,000 and over throughout the early to mid 1990s. The more widespread adoption of these technologies into mainstream PCs was a direct factor in the decline of the workstation as a separate market segment: *High performance [[Central processing unit|CPUs]]: while [[RISC]] in its early days (early 1980s) offered roughly an order-of-magnitude performance improvement over [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] processors of comparable cost, one particular family of CISC processors, [[Intel]]'s [[x86]], always had the edge in market share and the [[economies of scale]] that this implied. By the mid-1990s, some x86 CPUs had achieved performance on a parity with RISC in some areas, such as integer performance (albeit at a cost of greater chip complexity), relegating the latter to even more high-end markets for the most part. *Hardware support for [[floating-point]] operations: optional on the original IBM PC; remained on a separate chip for Intel systems until the [[80486DX]] processor. Even then, x86 floating-point performance continued to lag behind other processors due to limitations in its architecture. Today even low-price PCs now have performance in the gigaFLOPS range, but higher-end systems are preferred for floating-point intensive tasks. *Large memory configurations: PCs (i.e. IBM-compatibles) were originally limited to a 640 KB memory capacity (not counting bank-switched "expanded memory") until the 1982 introduction of the [[80286]] processor; early workstations provided access to several megabytes of memory. Even after PCs broke the 640 KB limit with the 80286, special programming techniques were required to address significant amounts of memory until the 80386, as opposed to other 32-bit processors such as [[SPARC]] which provided straightforward access to nearly their entire 4 GB memory address range. 64-bit workstations and servers supporting an address range far beyond 4 GB have been available since the early 1990s, a technology just beginning to appear in the PC desktop and server market in the mid-2000s. *[[Operating system]]: early workstations ran the [[Unix]] operating system (OS) or a [[Unix-like]] variant or equivalent such as [[OpenVMS|VMS]]. The PC CPUs of the time had limitations in memory capacity and [[protected mode|memory access protection]], making them unsuitable to run OSes of this sophistication, but this, too, began to change in the late 1980s as PCs with the [[32-bit]] [[80386]] with integrated paged [[Memory management unit|MMUs]] became widely affordable. *High-speed [[computer network|networking]] (10 Mbit/s or better): 10 Mbit/s network interfaces were commonly available for PCs by the early 1990s, although by that time workstations were pursuing even higher networking speeds, moving to 100 Mbit/s, 1 Gbit/s, and 10 Gbit/s. However, economies of scale and the demand for high speed networking in even non-technical areas has dramatically decreased the time it takes for newer networking technologies to reach commodity price points. *Large displays (17" to 21"), high resolutions, high refresh rate were common among PCs by the late 1990s, although in the late 1980s and early 1990s, this was rare. *High-performance [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] hardware: this started to become increasingly popular in the PC market around the mid-to-late 1990s, mostly driven by computer gaming, although workstations featured better quality, sometimes sacrificing performance. *High performance/high capacity data storage: early workstations tended to use proprietary disk interfaces until the emergence of the SCSI standard in the mid-1980s. Although SCSI interfaces soon became available for PCs, they were comparatively expensive and tended to be limited by the speed of the PC's [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] peripheral bus (although SCSI did become standard on the [[Apple Macintosh]]). SCSI is an advanced controller interface which is particularly good where the disk has to cope with multiple requests at once. This makes it suited for use in servers, but its benefits to desktop PCs which mostly run single-user operating systems are less clear. These days, with desktop systems acquiring more multi-user capabilities (and the increasing popularity of [[Linux]]), the new disk interface of choice is [[Serial ATA]], which has throughput comparable to SCSI but at a lower cost. *Extremely reliable components: together with multiple CPUs with greater cache and error correcting memory, this may remain the distinguishing feature of a workstation today. Although most technologies implemented in modern workstations are also available at lower
