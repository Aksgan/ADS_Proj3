It was the first school in Hampshire designated as a Specialist [[Maths and Computing College]] in September 2003. The school is named after the first [[Bishop]] of [[Portsmouth]], [[Neville Lovett]]. ==Academics== As with all [[comprehensive schools]] in the [[town]], it does not provide a [[sixth form]], and instead, pupils looking to take their education to [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-Level]] standard and beyond go to one of the several [[post-secondary education|tertiary colleges]] in the area. In 2007 the school made a technological advance by putting touch sensitive "Smart Boards" in almost all the rooms. ==Subjects== {| class="wikitable" |- !

The feature, which was never completed, was a 90-minute feature that was to be the first entirely computer-generated [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] movie.

Artists' increased use of [[multi-media]], [[digital]], and [[internet]] media since the 1960s has called into question the conventional strategies by which society preserves, cares for, and redisplays cultural artifacts created with or on [[ephemera]] media formats. While the most obvious vulnerability of [[new media art]] is rapid technological [[obsolescence]], the study of
