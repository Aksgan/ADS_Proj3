A refined Nash Equilibrium known as [[Coalition-Proof Nash Equilibrium]] (CPNE)<ref name="CoalitionProof"/> occurs when players cannot do better even if they are allowed to communicate and make "self-enforcing" agreement to deviate. Every correlated strategy supported by [[Dominance (game theory)|iterated strict dominance]] and on the [[Pareto frontier]] is a CPNE<ref name="CPNE">{{Citation|title = Coalition-Proof Equilibrium| author = D. Moreno, J. Wooders|journal = Games and Economic Behavior|volume = 17|year =1996| pages = 80&ndash;112 | doi = 10.1006/game.1996.0095|postscript = .}}</ref>. Further, it is possible for a game to have a Nash equilibrium that is resilient against coalitions less than a specified size, k. CPNE is related to the [[Core (economics)|theory of the core]]. == Occurrence == If a game has a [[unique]] Nash equilibrium and is played among players under certain conditions, then the NE strategy set will be adopted. Sufficient conditions to guarantee that the Nash equilibrium is played are: # The players all will do their utmost to maximize their expected payoff as described by the game. # The players are flawless in execution. # The players have sufficient intelligence to deduce the solution. # The players know the planned equilibrium strategy of all of the other players. # The players believe that a deviation in their own strategy will not cause deviations by any other players. # There is [[common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]] that all players meet these conditions, including this one. So, not only must each player know the other players meet the conditions, but also they must know that they all know that they meet them, and know that they know that they know that they meet them, and so on. === Where the conditions are not met === Examples of [[game theory]] problems in which these conditions are not met: # The first condition is not met if the game does not correctly describe the quantities a player wishes to maximize. In this case there is no particular reason for that player to adopt an equilibrium strategy. For instance, the prisoner’s dilemma is not a dilemma if either player is happy to be jailed indefinitely. # Intentional or accidental imperfection in execution. For example, a computer capable of flawless logical play facing a second flawless computer will result in equilibrium. Introduction of imperfection will lead to its disruption either through loss to the player who makes the mistake, or through negation of the [[common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]] criterion leading to possible victory for the player. (An example would be a player suddenly putting the car into reverse in the [[game of chicken]], ensuring a no-loss no-win scenario). # In many cases, the third condition is not met because, even though the equilibrium must exist, it is unknown due to the complexity of the game, for instance in [[Chinese chess]].<ref>{{Reference necessary|1=Nash proved that a perfect NE exists for this type of finite [[extensive form game]]|date=April 2010}} – it can be represented as a strategy complying with his original conditions for a game with a NE. Such games may not have unique NE, but at least one of the many equilibrium strategies would be played by hypothetical players having perfect knowledge of all {{Reference necessary|10<sup>150</sup> [[game-tree complexity|game trees]]|date=April 2010}}.</ref> Or, if known, it may not be known to all players, as when playing [[tic-tac-toe]] with a small child who desperately wants to win (meeting the other criteria). # The criterion of common knowledge may not be met even if all players do, in fact, meet all the other criteria. Players wrongly distrusting each other's rationality may adopt counter-strategies to expected irrational play on their opponents’ behalf. This is a major consideration in “[[Game of chicken|Chicken]]” or an [[arms race]], for example. === Where the conditions are met === Due to the limited conditions in which NE can actually be observed, they are rarely treated as a guide to day-to-day behaviour, or observed in practice in human negotiations. However, as a theoretical concept in [[economics]] and [[evolutionary biology]], the NE has explanatory power. The payoff in economics is utility (or sometimes money), and in evolutionary biology gene transmission, both are the fundamental bottom line of survival. Researchers who apply games theory in these fields claim that strategies failing to maximize these for whatever reason will be competed out of the market or environment, which are ascribed the ability to test all strategies. This conclusion is drawn from the "[[Nash equilibrium#Stability|stability]]" theory above. In these situations the assumption that the strategy observed is actually a NE has often been borne out by research{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}.{{Verify source|date=July 2007}} == NE and non-credible threats == [[File:SGPNEandPlainNE explainingexample.svg|300px|thumb|Extensive and Normal form illustrations that show the difference between SPNE and other NE. The blue equilibrium is not subgame perfect because player two makes a non-credible threat at 2(2) to be unkind (U).]] The Nash equilibrium is a superset of the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. The subgame perfect equilibrium in addition to the Nash Equilibrium requires that the strategy also is a Nash equilibrium in every subgame of that game. This eliminates all [[non-credible threats]], that is, strategies that contain non-rational moves in order to make the counter-player change his strategy. The image to the right shows a simple sequential game that illustrates the issue with subgame imperfect Nash equilibria. In this game player one chooses left(L) or right(R), which is followed by player two being called upon to be kind (K) or unkind (U) to player one, However, player two only stands to gain from being unkind if player one goes left. If player one goes right the rational player two would de facto be kind to him in that subgame. However, The non-credible threat of being unkind at 2(2) is still part of the blue (L, (U,U)) Nash equilibrium. Therefore, if rational behavior can be expected by both parties the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium may be a more meaningful solution concept when such [[dynamic inconsistency|dynamic inconsistencies]] arise. ==Proof of existence== As above, let <math>\sigma_{-i}</math> be a mixed strategy profile of all players except for player <math>i</math>.
