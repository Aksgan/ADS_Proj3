techniques are currently in development: [[Thermal Assisted Switching]] (TAS)<ref>The Emergence of Practical MRAM http://www.crocus-technology.com/pdf/BH%20GSA%20Article.pdf</ref> which is being developed by [[Crocus Technology]], and [[Spin torque transfer|Spin Torque Transfer]] (STT) on which [[Crocus Technology|Crocus]], [[Hynix]], [[IBM]], and several other companies are working<ref>http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=218000269</ref>. STT-MRAM appears to allow for much higher densities than the 1st generation, but is lagging behind flash for the same reasons as FeRAM &ndash; enormous competitive pressures in the flash market. Another solid-state technology to see more than purely experimental development is [[Phase-change RAM]], or PRAM. PRAM is based on the same storage mechanism as writable [[Compact Disk|CDs]] and [[DVD]]s, but reads them based on their changes in electrical resistance rather than changes in their optical properties. Considered a "dark horse" for some time, in 2006 [[Samsung]] announced the availability of a 512 Mb part, considerably higher capacity than either MRAM or FeRAM. The areal density of these parts appears to be even higher than modern flash devices, the lower overall storage being due to the lack of multi-bit encoding. This announcement was followed by one from [[Intel]] and [[STMicroelectronics]], who demonstrated their own PRAM devices at the 2006 [[Intel Developer Forum]] in October. One of the most attended sessions in the IEDM December 2006 was the presentation by IBM of their PRAM technology. Also seeing renewed interest is silicon-oxide-nitride-oxide-silicon ([[SONOS]]) memory. Perhaps one of the more innovative solutions is [[IBM Millipede|millipede memory]], developed by [[IBM]]. Millipede is essentially a [[punched card]] rendered using [[nanotechnology]] in order to dramatically increase areal density. Although it was planned to introduce millipede as early as 2003, unexpected problems in development delayed this until 2005, by which point it was no longer competitive with flash. In theory the technology offers storage densities on the order of 1 Tbit/in², far greater than even the best [[hard drive]] technologies currently in use ([[perpendicular recording]] offers about 230 Gbit/in²) . However, slow read and write times for memories this large seem to limit this technology to hard drive replacements as opposed to high-speed RAM-like uses, although to a very large degree the same is true of flash as well. It remains to be seen if this technology will ever become practical. A number of more esoteric devices have been proposed, including [[Nano-RAM]] based on [[Carbon nanotube|carbon nanotube technology]], but these are currently far from commercialization. The advantages that nanostructures such as [[quantum dots]], [[carbon nanotubes]] and [[nanowires]] offer over their silicon-based predecessors include their tiny size, speed and their density. Several concepts of molecular-scale memory devices have been developed recently. == See also == *[[Random Access Memory|RAM]] *[[Static random access memory|Static RAM]] (SRAM) *[[Dynamic Random Access Memory|Dynamic RAM]] (DRAM) *[[Non-volatile memory]] *[[MRAM]] *[[EEPROM]] ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Non-volatile memory]] [[Category:Computer memory]] [[ar:ذاكرة الوصول العشوائي غير المتطايرة]] [[da:Nvram]] [[de:NVRAM]] [[es:Memoria de acceso aleatorio no volátil]] [[fr:Mémoire non volatile]] [[hr:NVRAM]] [[ja:不揮発性メモリ]] [[mk:Non-volatile random access memory]] [[pl:NVRAM]] [[pt:NVRAM]] [[ru:Энергонезависимая память]] [[sk:NVRAM]]</text> </page> <page> <id>26590</id> <title>Nonbroadcast multiple-access network</title> <text>{{Unreferenced stub|auto=yes|date=December 2009}} A '''nonbroadcast multiple access network''' ('''NBMA''') is a [[computer network]] to which multiple hosts are attached, but data is transmitted only directly from one computer to another single host over a [[virtual circuit]] or across a [[switched fabric]]. NBMA networks do not support [[multicast]] or [[Broadcasting (computing)|broadcast]] traffic. Some common examples of nonbroadcast network technologies include [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM), [[Frame Relay]], [[X.25]], and home power line networking. ==Power line networks== The [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] standard provides a specification for creating a high-speed (up to 1 Gigabit/s) [[local area network]] using existing home [[Power line communication|power lines]], phone lines and [[Ethernet over coax|coaxial cables]]. Because of [[multipath propagation]], power lines use frequency-selective channels. Channel frequency response is different for each pair of transmitter and receiver, so modulation parameters are unique for each transmitter and receiver pair. Since each pair of devices uses a different modulation scheme for communication, other devices may not be able to demodulate the information sent between them. ==See also== *[[Open Shortest Path First]] *[[Routing protocol]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Nonbroadcast Multiple-Access Network}} [[Category:Network protocols]] {{Compu-network-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>26602</id> <title>Nonextensive entropy</title> <text>[[Entropy]] is considered to be an extensive property, i.e., that its value depends on the amount of material present. [[Constantino Tsallis]] has proposed a '''nonextensive entropy''', which is a generalization of the traditional Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy. The rationale behind the theory is that Gibbs-Boltzmann entropy leads to systems that have a strong dependence on initial conditions. In reality most materials behave quite independently of initial conditions. Nonextensive entropy leads to nonextensive statistical mechanics, whose typical functions are power laws, instead of the traditional exponentials. == See also == * [[Tsallis entropy]] {{Statistical mechanics topics}} [[Category:Probability theory]] [[Category:Entropy and information]] [[Category:Thermodynamic entropy]] [[Category:Information theory]] {{condensedmatter-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>26604</id> <title>Nonlinear complementarity problem</title> <text>In applied mathematics, a '''nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP)''' with respect to a mapping ''&fnof;'' : '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> &rarr; '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, denoted by NCP''&fnof;'', is to find a vector ''x'' &isin; '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> such that : <math>x \geq 0,\ f(x) \geq 0 \text{ and } x^{T}f(x)=0 \,</math> where ''&fnof;''(''x'') is a smooth mapping. == References == * {{cite paper|author=Stephen C.
