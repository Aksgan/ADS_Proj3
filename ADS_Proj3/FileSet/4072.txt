Algebra Engrg. Comm. Comput., 12:327-349, 2001.</ref>. The points (called ''cornerpoints'') and lines (called ''cornerlines'') of such formal series encode the information about discontinuities of the corresponding size functions, while their multiplicities contain the information about the values taken by the size function. Formally: * ''cornerpoints'' are defined as those points <math>p=(x,y)\ </math>, with <math>x<y\ </math>, such that the number <math>\mu (p){\stackrel{{\rm def}}{=}}\min _{\alpha >0 ,\beta>0} \ell _{({M},\varphi )}(x+\alpha ,y- \beta)-\ell _{({ M},\varphi )} (x+\alpha ,y+\beta )- \ell_{({ M},\varphi )} (x-\alpha ,y-\beta )+\ell _{({ M} ,\varphi )} (x-\alpha ,y+\beta )</math> is positive. The number <math>\mu (p)\ </math> is said to be the ''multiplicity'' of <math>p\ </math>. * ''cornerlines'' and are defined as those lines <math>r:x=k\ </math> such that <math>\mu (r){\stackrel{\rm def}{=}}\min _{\alpha >0 ,k+\alpha <y}\ell _{({ M},\varphi )}(k+\alpha ,y)- \ell _{({ M},\varphi )}(k-\alpha ,y)>0.</math> The number <math>\mu (r)\ </math> is sad to be the '' multiplicity'' of <math>r\ </math>. * ''Representation Theorem'': For every <math>{\bar x}<{\bar y}</math>, it holds <math>\ell _{({M},\varphi )}({\bar x},{\bar y})=\sum _{p=(x,y)\atop x\le {\bar x}, y>\bar y }\mu\big(p\big)+\sum _{r:x=k\atop k\le {\bar x} }\mu\big(r\big)</math> This representation contains the same amount of information about the shape under study as the original size function does, but is much more concise. This algebraic approach to size functions leads to the definition of new similarity measures between shapes, by translating the problem of comparing size functions into the problem of comparing formal series. The most studied among these metrics between size function is the [[matching distance]]<ref name="dAFrLa06">Michele d'Amico, Patrizio Frosini and Claudia Landi, ''Using matching distance in Size Theory: a survey'', International Journal of Imaging Systems and Technology, 16(5):154–161, 2006.</ref>. ==References== {{refs}} ==See also== * [[Size theory]] * [[Natural pseudodistance]] * [[Size functor]] * [[Size homotopy group]] * [[Size pair]] * [[Matching distance]] * [[Topological data analysis]] [[Category:topology]]</text> </page> <page> <id>34585</id> <title>Size t</title> <text>{{DISPLAYTITLE:size_t}} '''<code>size_t</code>''' is an unsigned data type defined by several C/C++ standards (e.g., the [[C99]] ISO/IEC 9899 standard) that is defined in <code>[[stddef.h]]</code>.<ref>http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf chapter 7.17</ref> It can be further imported by inclusion of <code>[[stdlib.h]]</code> as this file internally sub includes <code>stddef.h</code>.<ref>http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf chapter 7.20</ref> This type is used to represent the size of an object. Library functions that take or return sizes expect them to be of type or have the return type of <code>size_t</code>. Further, the most frequently used compiler-based operator <code>[[sizeof]]</code> should evaluate to a value that is compatible with <code>size_t</code>. ==Range and storage size of size_t== The actual type of <code>size_t</code> is platform-dependent; a common mistake is to assume <code>size_t</code> is the same as <code>unsigned int</code>, which can lead to programming errors,<ref>[http://www.gamedev.net/reference/programming/features/20issues64bit/ gamedev.net - 20 issues of porting C++ code on the 64-bit platform]</ref><ref>[http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/lessons-on-development-of-64-bit-cc-applications/ software.intel.com - Lessons on development of 64-bit C/C++ applications]</ref> when moving from 32 to 64-bit architecture, for example. According to the 1999 ISO C standard (C99), <code>size_t</code> is an unsigned integer type of at least 16 bits. ==Signed variant ssize_t== In some implementations there is further a non-standard signed variant of this type with name <code>ssize_t</code>. The type definition for <code>ssize_t</code> is available in most Unix compatible systems. It was probably introduced by the second edition of the POSIX 1003.1 standard (1003.1-1996).<ref>http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-help/2006-06/msg00188.html</ref> The <code>ssize_t</code> type follows the same rules as <code>size_t</code> for its storage size, location and inclusion, and uses the implementation's usual representation of signed values&mdash;2's complement in most, if not all, cases. ==References== <references /> [[Category:C_programming_language]]</text> </page> <page> <id>34614</id> <title>Skypix</title> <text>'''Skypix''' is the name of a [[Script (computing)|Script]] [[Markup Language]] aimed to add rich graphic content such as changeable fonts, mouse-controlled actions, animations and sound to Bulletin Board System nodes.
