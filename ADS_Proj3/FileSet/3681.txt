Let <math>(X, \| \cdot \|)</math> be an <math>N</math>-dimensional normed space. There exist subspaces <math>Z \subset Y \subset X</math> such that the following holds: * The [[quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient space]] <math>E = Y/Z</math> is of dimension <math>\text{dim} E \geq c N</math>, where <math>c>0</math> is a universal constant. * The induced [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] <math>\| \cdot \|</math> on <math>E</math>, defined by <math>\| e \| = \min_{y \in Z} \| e-y \|</math> for <math>e \in E</math>, is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to Euclidean. That is, there exists a positive [[quadratic form]] ("Euclidean structure") <math>Q</math> on <math>E</math>, such that :: <math>\frac{\sqrt{Q(e)}}{K} \leq \| e \| \leq K \sqrt{Q(e)}</math> for <math>e \in E,</math> :with <math>K>1</math> a universal constant. In fact, the constant <math>c</math> can be made arbitrarily close to 1, at the expense of the constant <math>K</math> becoming large. The original proof allowed :<math> c(K) \approx 1 - \text{const} / \log \log K </math>; see references for improved estimates. == References == * V.D.Milman, ''Almost Euclidean quotient spaces of subspaces of a finite-dimensional normed space'', Israel seminar on geometrical aspects of functional analysis (1983/84), X, 8 pp., Tel Aviv Univ., Tel Aviv, 1984. * Y.

The points to be identified are specified by an [[equivalence relation]]. This is commonly done in order to construct new spaces from given ones. == Definition == Suppose ''X'' is a [[topological space]] and ~ is an [[equivalence relation]] on ''X''. We define a topology on the [[quotient set]] ''X''/~ (the set consisting of all [[equivalence class]]es of ~) as follows: a set of equivalence classes in ''X''/~ is [[open set|open]] if and only if their [[union (set theory)|union]] is open in ''X''. This is the '''quotient topology''' on the quotient set ''X''/~. Equivalently, the quotient topology can be characterized in the following manner: Let ''q'' : ''X'' &rarr; ''X''/~ be the projection map which sends each element of ''X'' to its equivalence class. Then the quotient topology on ''X''/~ is the [[finest topology]] for which ''q'' is [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]]. Given a [[surjective]] map ''f'' : ''X'' &rarr; ''Y'' from a topological space ''X'' to a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''Y'' we can define the quotient topology on ''Y'' as the finest topology for which ''f'' is continuous. This is equivalent to saying that a subset ''V'' &sube; ''Y'' is open in ''Y'' if and only if its [[preimage]] ''f''<sup>&minus;1</sup>(''V'') is open in ''X''. The map ''f'' induces a unique equivalence relation on ''X'' by saying ''x''<sub>1</sub>~''x''<sub>2</sub> [[if and only if]] ''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>) = ''f''(''x''<sub>2</sub>). The quotient space ''X''/~ is then [[homeomorphic]] to ''Y'' (with its quotient topology) via the homeomorphism which sends the equivalence class of ''x'' to ''f''(''x''). In general, a surjective, continuous map ''f'' : ''X'' &rarr; ''Y'' is said to be a '''quotient map''' if ''Y'' has the quotient topology determined by ''f''. == Examples == *'''Gluing.''' Often, topologists talk of gluing points together. If ''X'' is a topological space and points <math>x,y \in X</math> are to be "glued", then what is meant is that we are to consider the quotient space obtained from the equivalence relation ''a ~ b'' if and only if ''a = b'' or ''a = x, b = y'' (or ''a = y, b = x''). The two points are henceforth interpreted as one point. *Consider the unit square ''I''<sup>2</sup> = [0,1]&times;[0,1] and the equivalence relation ~ generated by the requirement that all boundary points be equivalent, thus identifying all boundary points to a single equivalence class. Then ''I''<sup>2</sup>/~ is homeomorphic to the [[sphere|unit sphere]] ''S''<sup>2</sup>. *'''[[Adjunction space]]'''. More generally, suppose ''X'' is a space and ''A'' is a [[subspace (topology)|subspace]] of ''X''. One can identify all points in ''A'' to a single equivalence class and leave points outside of ''A'' equivalent only to themselves. The resulting quotient space is denoted ''X''/''A''. The 2-sphere is then homeomorphic to the unit disc with its boundary identified to a single point: ''D''<sup>2</sup>/&part;''D''<sup>2</sup>. *Consider the set ''X'' = '''R''' of all [[real number]]s with the ordinary topology, and write ''x'' ~ ''y'' [[if and only if]] ''x''&minus;''y'' is an [[integer]]. Then the quotient space ''X''/~ is [[homeomorphic]] to the [[unit circle]] ''S''<sup>1</sup> via the homeomorphism which sends the equivalence class of ''x'' to exp(2&pi;''ix''). *A vast generalization of the previous example is the following: Suppose a [[topological group]] ''G'' [[group action|acts]] continuously on a space ''X''. One can form an equivalence relation on ''X'' by saying points are equivalent if and only if they lie in the same [[orbit (group theory)|orbit]]. The quotient space under this relation is called the '''orbit space''', denoted ''X''/''G''. In the previous example ''G'' = '''Z''' acts on '''R''' by translation. The orbit space '''R'''/'''Z''' is homeomorphic to ''S''<sup>1</sup>. ''Warning'': The notation '''R'''/'''Z''' is somewhat ambiguous. If '''Z''' is understood to be a group acting on '''R''' then the quotient is the circle. However, if '''Z''' is thought of as a subspace of '''R''', then the quotient is an infinite [[bouquet of circles]] joined
