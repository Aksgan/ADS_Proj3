"brilliant, difficult book", "rich with insights about the passive construction in English, reference, hypostasis, evidence, and many other subjects", as well as "marvelously written, philosophical poetry". Other reviews used words like "rich", "provocative", "iconoclastic", "bold", "subtle, interesting, inventive and stylishly written", with "a fascinating line of anti-skeptical argument" from an author of "undoubted acumen and insight". The book went against the grain and did not extend the usual ideas. It did not have any of the "justified, true belief" analysis and the search for a fourth condition to patch it up, or talk about varieties of foundationalism, externalism or internalism, let alone the merits of naturalizing. Indeed, Ziff never mentioned [[Edmund Gettier|Gettier]] or most of the usual crowd then - say [[Alvin Goldman|Goldman]], [[Gilbert Harman|Harman]], [[Fred Dretske|Dretske]], [[Jean-Yves Pollock|Pollock]] and [[Peter Unger|Unger]]; a few pages are on [[Robert Nozick|Nozick]]. He maintained that it was senseless to speak about a justified belief, that "neither knowledge nor belief either require or can accept justification", that you did not need evidence to "know that p", or need to believe that p, that 'know' is univocal and means, at bottom, you are in a position to know, no matter whether it is knowing that p, how to do something, or knowing a person, that knowing something (or someone) always counts as an increase in "global coherence" compared to not, and that "coherence is a matter of logical structure". Ziff’s coherence view differs from the other [[Coherence theory of truth|coherentists]] ([[Keith Lehrer|Lehrer]], [[Laurence BonJour|BonJour]], [[Nicholas Rescher|Rescher]]). He stated his analysis of the philosopher’s favorite, knows that p, like this: "one knows that p if and only if p is true, and one is in a position such that, in that position, any possibility of one’s being in error with respect to the truth of p may be safely discounted". This is a fallibilist analysis and Ziff used it to counter skepticism in terms of a technical notion, a safe position, "in which the possibility of error may safely be discounted". '''''Antiaesthetics''''' was his second book with Reidel, and it also came out in 1984. The book is subtitled "An Appreciation of the Cow with the Subtile Nose", which refers to [[Jean Dubuffet]]’s painting in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|Metropolitan Museum]]. There is a page-size picture of this painting at the start of the book and Ziff discussed it at length in places. It is an example of what he called "antiart". The book has eight previously published papers from 1972&ndash;1981 and three unpublished ones. "The Cow on the Roof" was an invited symposium paper at the American Philosophical Association’s Eastern Division, and came out in ''The Journal of Philosophy'', along with comments by Kendall Walton and Guy Sircello. It is about the identity of a piece of music and Ziff emphasized the idea that pieces of music have variants. Ziff first wrote on this topic in his critical review of Goodman’s "Languages of Art" in ''The Philosophical Review'' (1971). "Art and Sociobiology" was in ''Mind'' in 1981, and was another first: viz., a serious philosopher taking a biological view of aesthetic practices and ideas such as appreciating and intrinsic value. Ziff combined the sociobiology with his notion of "aspection" and person-act-entity-conditions approach from his early paper, "Reasons in Art Criticism". Other papers were invited for conferences and their proceedings - on sports, dance, Wittgenstein, and literature - and a Reidel [[festschrift]]. One appeared in a book about philosophy along with similar papers by [[A.J. Ayer|Ayer]], [[Paul Feyerabend|Feyerabend]], [[Karl Popper|Popper]], and [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]], among others.
