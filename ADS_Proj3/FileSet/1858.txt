were renamed '''Compaq BASIC for OpenVMS VAX''' and '''Compaq BASIC for OpenVMS Alpha'''. Likewise, when [[Compaq]] merged with [[HP]] in 2001/02, the products were renamed '''HP BASIC for OpenVMS on VAX''' and '''HP BASIC for OpenVMS on AlphaServer'''. HP has since built new [[Server (computing)|server]] platforms based upon [[Intel]]'s [[Itanium]] chip, and there is now a '''HP BASIC for OpenVMS on Integrity''' as well. ==Sample code== ===Hello, world=== <source lang="QBasic"> 10 PRINT "Hello, world!" 20 END </source> ==Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion== <source lang="QBasic"> 10 PRINT "Enter a temperature in " 20 INPUT C 30 PRINT "Temperature in degrees Fahrenheit is "; (C * 1.8) + 32 40 END </source> ==External links== * [http://h71000.www7.hp.com/doc/basic.html Official BASIC documentation at HP] * [http://www3.sympatico.ca/n.rieck/links/openvms_demos.html Some excellent HP BASIC demos for OpenVMS] {{BASIC}} [[Category:Articles with example BASIC code]] [[Category:OpenVMS software]] [[Category:BASIC compilers]]</text> </page> <page> <id>16069</id> <title>HP Compaq TC1100</title> <text>[[Image:TC1100-1.JPG|thumb|right|250px|TC1100 in slate mode with the keyboard removed]] [[Image:Tc1100-2.JPG|thumb|right|250px|TC1100 unfolded with keyboard attached]] The '''HP Compaq TC1100''' is a [[tablet PC]] sold by [[Hewlett-Packard]] that was the follow up to the [[Compaq TC1000]]. The TC1100 had either an [[Intel Celeron]] or an [[Intel Pentium M]] chip set and could be upgraded to a maximum amount of 2 gigabytes of memory. These upgrades from the TC1000 were much welcomed after numerous complaints about the poor performance of the TC1000. The TC1100 was the last version from [[Hewlett Packard|HP]] in this style of tablet. It was replaced by the [[HP Compaq TC4200]], which featured a more traditional non-detachable design. ==Design== The TC1100 has a 10.4 inch LCD display and [[Wacom|pressure-sensitive pen]] that shares the same basic design as its predecessor, the TC1000. It has a unique design that has been coined by many as a [[Tablet_PC#Hybrids|hybrid tablet]]. This refers to the fact that it has the properties of both a convertible and slate tablet. All the necessary hardware components are stored within the casing of the display and [[digitizer]]. This allows it to work with or without a keyboard attached. With the keyboard attached it can either be used in the same fashion as a laptop, with the keyboard supporting the rest of the tablet, or with the back of the tablet folded into the keyboard allowing the user to write on the screen easily. This sort of design gives much versatility and has gathered a cult-like following due to the lack of similar designs on the market. The range of processors includes Pentium-M 1.0Ghz, 1.1Ghz, and 1.2Ghz. The high end TC1100 features the 1.2 GHz Intel Pentium M 753 Ultra Low Voltage processor(1.20 GHz, 2MB L2 cache, 400 MHz FSB), 60 GB hard drive, 512 MB (333 MHz) of installed RAM (2 GB max), 54g wi-fi connectivity (802.11b/g), Bluetooth wireless connectivity, Secure Digital memory card slot, and Windows XP Tablet PC Edition operating system. The TC1100 allows for easy access to its memory, hard drive, and wireless card. The memory comes standard as either 256MB or 512MB and can be upgraded to 2GB. The hard drive is also easily upgradeable, most 2.5-inch [[Integrated Drive Electronics|IDE]] hard drives are compatible with it but the tablet will only address up to 137GB due to a lack of LBA48 support. The wireless card can be accessed from the same area as the memory, but some tablets that did not originally have a wireless card installed may not have the antenna installed either making a new installation either hard or impossible.<ref name="TC-one-thousand - TC Upgrades">{{Cite web|url=http://81.5.185.34/tc-one-thousand/upgrades.html|title=TC Upgrades|accessdate=2006-11-29|year=2005|author=Christopher J. James}}</ref> HP implemented 6 customizable controls: 3 physical buttons along the side of the unit, and 3 stylus-sensitive spots in the bezel of the display. In addition, there is a "jog dial" in line with the physical buttons, which can be used for scrolling or zooming, as controlled by software. Two small retractable "feet" were also included on the back on the tablet, allowing for an angled writing surface when extended, and ventilation when placed on a flat surface. ==Discontinued== By the end of 2005, HP had discontinued the TC1100. It retained a loyal following, however, due to its uncommon design. HP's official response to questions asked about the TC1100's discontinuation is that "HP remains committed to the Tablet PC platform".<ref name="What is HP Thinking?">{{Cite web|url=http://vermontslate.blogspot.com/2005/11/what-is-hp-thinking.html |title=What is HP Thinking|accessdate=2006-11-26|year=2005|author=Mark Payton|work=Vermont Slate}}</ref> ==TX1000 Series== Since discontinuing the TC1100, HP has released a new line of tablets, the TX1100US and the TX1200US being the first of the line. These updated versions are substantially more powerful than the TC series, but are of the more conventional [[Tablet PC#Convertibles|convertible]] design. ==References== {{reflist}} ==Further reading== * [http://reviews.cnet.com/HP_Compaq_Tablet_PC_TC1100/4505-3126_7-30573412.html HP Compaq Tablet PC TC1100 Reviews] * [http://mobilepcwiki.com/mpc/index.php?title=HP/TC1100/Windows_Vista_Installation_Notes Windows Vista Installation Notes] * [http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Home.jsp?lang=en&cc=us&prodTypeId=321957&prodSeriesId=376810&lang=en&cc=us Manual and User Guide] * [http://www.tabletpcbuzz.com/showthread.php?s=8f92b29e421048c0cdea55668073e539&t=34009&page=3 Upgrade info] * [http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/TC1100 Linux on TC1100 - LinuxQuestions wiki] * [http://dorienherremans.blogspot.com/2010/08/how-to-install-opensuse-113-on-hp.html OpenSuse Linux on a tc1100] ==External links== [[Category:Hewlett-Packard products]] [[Category:Mobile computers]] [[Category:Tablet PC]] [[cs:HP Compaq TC1100]] [[it:HP Compaq tc1100]]</text> </page> <page> <id>16070</id> <title>HP Insight Manager</title> <text>{{orphan|date=August 2009}} HP ([[Hewlett-Packard|Hewlett Packard]]) Systems '''Insight Manager''' is an IT [[systems management]] tool that is free of charge and widely adopted in the IT industry.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} HP Systems Insight Manager (HPSIM) is the basis for the HP unified infrastructure management approach to IT [[system management]] and is the foundation for HP's unified infrastructure management strategy.
