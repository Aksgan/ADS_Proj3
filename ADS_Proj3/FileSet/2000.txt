creating a design that purportedly accounted for all of these problems, they decided to create Humanistic Robotics Inc. Its land mine–clearing robot is approaching the final test phase, and the company will be looking to produce their new robot en masse within the next few years. ==Board== The board is composed of Michael Douglas, Ian McMillan, Iqbal Quadir, Jonathan Granoff and Steve Goodman.<ref>[http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/what_is_business/stories/reeves.htm Samuel Reeves<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.landminesurvivors.org/news_article.php?id=516 LSN - Landmine Survivors Network<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://philadelphia.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2006/05/01/story3.html?page=1 Competition spawns companies - Philadelphia Business Journal:<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Robotics companies]] [[Category:Explosives detection]]</text> </page> <page> <id>17089</id> <title>Humanoid Robotics Project</title> <text>{{Portal|Robotics}} The '''Humanoid Robotics Project''' has developed a series of humanoid and general domestic helper robots, sponsored by the [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry]] (METI) and [[New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization]] (NEDO), spearheaded by [[Kawada Industries]] and supported by the [[National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology]] (AIST) and [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]], Inc. The HRP series also goes by the name Promet. The HRP should not be confused with the [[HOAP]] series (Humanoid for Open Architecture Platform), which is manufactured by [[Fujitsu]]. == Features and technology == The project started with three [[Honda P series|Honda P3]] which were bought from [[Honda]].<ref name="robocon 2003/4">{{cite news|title=HRPが最終成果を公開！ |url=http://www.ohmsha.co.jp/robocon/archive/maga/no027/pdf/2703.pdf |language=Japanese |Author=Junya Asano |work=[http://www.ohmsha.co.jp/robocon/ Robocon Magazine] |publisher=Ohmsha, Ltd |date=April 2003 |accessdate=2010-06-12}}</ref> And, the project developed them as the HRP-1 with original features, such as [[telecommand]] system.<ref name="robocon 2003/4" /><ref>{{cite news|title=産総研、働く人間型ロボット開発の中間成果を発表 |url=http://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/2002/0411/hrp1.htm |language=Japanese |Author= |work=PC Watch |publisher=Impress Watch Corporation |date=2002-04-10 |accessdate=2010-06-12}}</ref> An interesting feature that HRP-2 has is the ability to stand up again after lying flat on the floor either on its back or front.
