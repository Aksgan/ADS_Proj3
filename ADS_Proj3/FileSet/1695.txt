the new Weimar government helped fuel the growth of the [[Communist Party of Germany|German Communist Party]]. Many conservatives were drawn towards the reactionary/revolutionary right, particularly the National Socialist German Workers Party—the [[Nazi Party]]. By 1932, these two parties controlled the majority of parliament (296 total parliamentary seats by July 1932). After a series of unsuccessful cabinets, President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] made a crucial decision: on 30 January 1933, seeing little alternative and pushed by right-wing advisors, von Hindenburg appointed [[Adolf Hitler]] as [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor of Germany]], honoring Hitler's request. ===Third Reich 1933–1945=== {{Main|Nazi Germany}} [[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S33882, Adolf Hitler retouched.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Adolf Hitler]], chancellor of the ''[[Nazi Germany|Großdeutsches Reich]]'']] On 27 February 1933 the [[Reichstag fire|Reichstag]] building went up in flames, and a consequent [[Reichstag Fire Decree|emergency decree]] abrogated basic citizens' rights. An [[Enabling Act]] passed in parliament gave Hitler unrestricted legislative power.

Leading to [[World War II]] and roughly in parallel with military rearmament, German foreign policy became more aggressive and [[Lebensraum|expansionistic]]. In 1938 and 1939, [[Anschluss|Austria]] and [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]] were brought under control and the [[invasion of Poland]] prepared through the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop pact]] and [[Operation Himmler]]. On 1 September 1939 the German [[Wehrmacht]] launched a [[blitzkrieg]] on [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], which was swiftly occupied by Germany and by the Soviet [[Red Army]]. The UK and France declared war on Germany, marking the beginning of World War II in Europe. As the war progressed, Germany and its [[Axis powers|allies]] quickly gained control of much of [[Occupied Europe|continental Europe]] while the plan to [[Operation Sea Lion|occupy the United Kingdom]] failed. [[File:Potsdamer Platz 1945.jpg|thumb|left|Berlin in ruins after [[World War II]], [[Potsdamer Platz]] 1945]]On 22 June 1941, Germany broke the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop pact]] and [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]]. The same year, [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked the American base at Pearl Harbor]], and Germany declared war on the United States as a consequence of its alliance with Japan. Although the German army advanced into the Soviet Union quite rapidly, the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] marked a major turning point in the war. Subsequently, the German army started to retreat on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern front]]. In September 1943, Germany's ally Italy surrendered, and German forces were forced to defend an additional front in Italy. [[Normandy Landings|D-Day]] marked another major turning point in the war, opening up a [[Western Front (World War II)|Western front]]; the Allied forces landed on the beaches of [[Normandy]] and made advances towards German territory. Germany's defeat soon followed. On 8 May 1945, [[Victory in Europe Day|the German armed forces surrendered]] after the [[Red Army]] occupied Berlin. Approximately seven million German soldiers and civilians — including [[ethnic Germans]] from Eastern Europe — died during World War II.<ref>Steinberg, Heinz Günter.
