loads and stores, other applications of memory dependence prediction have been proposed. See for example [4]. Memory dependence prediction is an optimization on top of '''memory dependence speculation'''. Sequential execution semantics imply that stores and loads appear to execute in the order specified by the program. However, as with out-of-order execution of other instructions, it may be possible to execute two memory operations in a different than the program implied order. This is possible when the two operations are independent. In memory dependence speculation a load may be allowed to execute before a store that precedes it. Speculation succeeds when the load is independent of the store, that is, when the two instructions access different memory locations. Speculation fails when the load is dependent upon the store, that is, when the two accesses overlap in memory. In the first, modern out-of-order designs, memory speculation was not used as its benefits were limited. Αs the scope of the our-of-order execution increased over few tens of instructions, naive memory depedence speculation was used. In '''naive memory dependence speculation'''<sup>[3]</sup>, a load is allowed to bypass any preceding store. As with any form of speculation, it is important to weight the benefits of correct speculation against the penalty paid on incorrect speculation. As the scope of out-of-order execution increases further into several tens of instructions, the performance benefits of naive speculation decrease. To retain the benefits of aggressive memory dependence speculation while avoiding the costs of mispeculation several predictors have been proposed. '''Selective memory dependence prediction'''<sup>[3][5]</sup> stalls specific loads until it is certain that no violation may occur. It does not explicitly predict dependences. This predictor may delay loads longer than necessary and hence result in suboptimal performance. In fact, in some cases it performs worse than naively speculating all loads as early as possible. This is because often its faster to mispeculate and recover than to wait for all preceding stores to execute. Exact memory dependence prediction was developed at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Specifically, '''Dynamic Speculation and Synchronization'''<sup>[3][5]</sup> delays loads only as long as it is necessary by predicting the exact store a load should wait for. This predictor predicts exact dependences (store and load pair). The '''synonym predictor'''<sup>[4]</sup> groups together all dependences that share a common load or store instruction. The '''store sets'''<sup>[1]</sup> predictor represents multiple potential dependences efficiently by grouping together all possible stores a load may dependent upon. The '''store barrier'''<sup>[2]</sup> predictor treats certain store instructions as barriers. That is, all subsequent load or store operations are not allowed to bypass the specific store. The store barrier predictor does not explicitly predict dependences. This predictor may unnecessarily delay subsequent, yet independent loads. Memory dependence prediction has other applications beyond the scheduling of loads and stores. For example, '''speculative memory cloaking'''<sup>[4]</sup> and '''speculative memory bypassing'''<sup>[4]</sup> use memory dependence prediction to streamline the communication of values through memory. ===Analogy to branch prediction=== Memory dependence prediction for loads and stores is analogous to [[branch predictor|branch prediction]] for [[conditional branch]] instructions. In branch prediction, the branch predictor predicts which way the branch will resolve before it is known. The processor can then speculatively fetch and execute instructions down one of the paths of the branch. Later, when the branch instruction executes, it can be determined if the branch instruction was correctly predicted. If not, this is a [[misprediction|branch misprediction]], and a pipeline flush is necessary to throw away instructions that were speculatively fetched and executed. Branch prediction can be thought of as a two step process. First, the predictor determines the direction of the branch (taken or not). This is a binary decision. Then, the predictor determines the actual target address. Similarly, memory dependence prediction can be thought of as a two step process. First, the predictor determines whether there is a dependence. Then it determines which this dependence is. ==Concept and Mechanisms== [1] Memory Dependence Prediction using Store Sets, Chrysos and Emer, in the Proceedings of the 25th Annual ACM/IEEE Conference on Computer Architecture, June 1998.

Unlike [[tampons]] and [[sanitary napkin|pads]], the cup collects menstrual fluid rather than absorbing it. ==Description== [[File:Menstrual cup insertion.svg|right|thumb|Insertion of a menstrual cup in the vagina]] There are two types of menstrual cup currently available: The first type is a bell-shaped cup made of [[rubber]] ([[latex]]), [[silicone]] or [[thermoplastic elastomer]] (TPE). It is reusable and designed to last for up to 10 years. Some brands recommend replacement each year, 5–10 years or state that women have been comfortable using them up to 10 years. These bell-shaped silicone or rubber cups must be removed before penetrative vaginal sex.<ref name=human/> The second type is a soft, flexible, disposable cup made of polyethylene and resembles the [[diaphragm (contraceptive)|contraceptive diaphragm]]. Soft, disposable menstrual cups may be worn during sex, though they are not contraceptive devices.<ref name=human> LeVay, Simon & Sharon M. Valente. ''Human Sexuality''. Sinauer Associates (2002),
