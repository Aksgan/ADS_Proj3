stakeholder that creates an expensive problem for another. # Senior Application Developers, over time, build up the experience needed to create valid estimates of project development cost. By presenting a use case survey to a Senior Developer, a richer understanding of the business problem can be communicated than by most other mechanisms. This allows the developer to produce more accurate and reliable estimates and to provide better development assumptions. The use case survey is a practical way to gather user requirements for most types of business [[software development]] including [[rapid application development]] but may be less useful for needs such as [[game development]]. {{DEFAULTSORT:Use Case Survey}} [[Category:Software requirements]]</text> </page> <page> <id>39046</id> <title>User-generated content</title> <text>{{Redirect|UGC}} The term user generated content entered [[mainstream]] usage during 2005 having arisen in web publishing and [[new media]] content production circles. Its use for a wide range of applications, including problem processing, [[news]], [[gossip]] and [[research]], reflects the expansion of media production through new technologies that are accessible and affordable to the general public. All digital media technologies are included, such as question-answer databases, [[digital video]], [[blogging]], [[podcasting]], forums, review-sites, social networking, [[Camera phone|mobile phone photography]] and [[wiki]]s. In addition to these technologies, user generated content may also employ a combination of [[open source]], [[free software]],<!--and relaxed restrictions on [[intellectual property]]--> and flexible [[licensing]] or related agreements to further reduce the barriers to [[collaboration]], [[skill|skill-building]] and [[Discovery (observation)|discovery]]. Sometimes UGC can constitute only a portion of a website. For example on [[Amazon.com]] the majority of content is prepared by [[System administrator|administrators]], but numerous user reviews of the products being sold are submitted by regular visitors to the site. Often UGC is partially or totally monitored by website administrators to avoid offensive content or language, copyright infringement issues, or simply to determine if the content posted is relevant to the site's general theme. However, there has often been little or no charge for uploading user generated content. As a result, the world's data centers are now replete with exabytes of UGC that, in addition to creating a corporate asset, may also contain data that can be regarded as a liability.<ref>See section below in this Wikipedia page on Legal Problems Related to UGC, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-generated_content#Legal_problems_related_to_UGC</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scl.org/site.aspx?i=ed9981|title=Web Site Operators & Liability for UGC - Facing up to Reality?|coauthors=Robert Goldstone & James Gill|date=2008-12-31|publisher=Society for Computers and Law|accessdate=3 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minterellison.com/public/connect/Internet/Home/Legal+Insights/Articles/A-TMT2-Riding+the+Web|title=Riding the Web 2.0 wave â€“ limiting liability for user generated content|last=Scott|first=Veronica|date=30 March 2010|publisher=MinterEllison Lawyers|accessdate=3 April 2010}}</ref> ==General requirements== The advent of user-generated content marked a shift among media organizations from creating online content to providing facilities for amateurs to publish their own content. User generated content has also been characterized as [[Citizen media|'Conversational Media']], as opposed to the [[mass media|'Packaged Goods Media' of the past century]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} The former is a two-way process in contrast to the one-way distribution of the latter. Conversational or two-way media is a key characteristic of so-called [[Web 2.0]] which encourages the publishing of one's own content and commenting on other people's. The role of the passive audience therefore has shifted since the birth of New Media, and an ever-growing number of participatory users are taking advantage of the interactive opportunities, especially on the Internet to create independent content. Grassroots experimentation then generated an innovation in sounds, artists, techniques and associations with audiences which then are being used in mainstream media.<ref>Jenkins, Henry (SODA), "Convergence Culture", New York University Press, New York</ref> The active, participatory and creative audience is prevailing today with relatively accessible media, tools and applications, and its culture is in turn affecting mass media corporations and global audiences. The [[OECD]] has defined three central schools for UGC: # '''Publication requirement:''' While UGC could be made by a user and never published online or elsewhere, we focus here on the work that is published in some context, be it on a publicly accessible website or on a page on a social networking site only accessible to a select group of people (eg, fellow university students). This is a useful way to exclude email, two-way instant messages and the like. # '''Creative effort:''' This implies that a certain amount of creative effort was put into creating the work or adapting existing works to construct a new one; i.e. users must add their own value to the work. UGC often also has a collaborative element to it, as is the case with websites which users can edit collaboratively. For example, merely copying a portion of a television show and posting it to an online video website (an activity frequently seen on the UGC sites) would not be considered UGC. If a user uploads his/her photographs, however, expresses his/her thoughts in a blog, or creates a new music video, this could be considered UGC. Yet the minimum amount of creative effort is hard to define and depends on the context. # '''Creation outside of professional routines and practices:''' User generated content is generally created outside of professional routines and practices. It often does not have an institutional or a commercial market context. In extreme cases, UGC may be produced by non-professionals without the expectation of profit or remuneration. Motivating factors include: connecting with peers, achieving a certain level of fame, notoriety, or prestige, and the desire to express oneself. Mere [[copy & paste]] or a [[hyperlink|link]] could also be seen as user generated self-expression. The action of linking to a work or copying a work could in itself motivate the creator, express the taste of the person linking or copying. Digg.com, Stumbleupon.com, leaptag.com is a good example where such linkage to work happens. The culmination of such linkages could very well identify the tastes of a person in the community and make that person unique. ==Adoption and recognition by mass media== The [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] set up a user generated content team as a pilot in April 2005 with 3 staff. In the wake of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] and the [[2005 Hertfordshire Oil Storage Terminal fire|Buncefield oil depot fire]], the team was made permanent
