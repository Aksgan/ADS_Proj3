like [[Walmart]], which attempt to reduce prices by reducing the number of intermediaries between the supplier and the buyer. Disintermediation is also closely associated with the idea of [[Just In Time (business)|just in time manufacturing]], as the removal of the need for [[inventory]] removes one function of an intermediary. The existence of laws which discourage disintermediation has been cited as a reason for the poor economic performance of [[Japan]] and [[Germany]] in the 1990s. However, Internet-related disintermediation occurred less frequently than many expected during the [[dot com boom]]. Retailers and wholesalers provide essential functions such as the extension of credit, aggregation of products from different suppliers, and processing of returns. In addition, shipping goods to and from the manufacturer can in many cases be far less efficient than shipping them to a store where the consumer can pick them up (if the consumer's trip to the store is ignored). In response to the threat of disintermediation, some retailers have attempted to integrate a virtual presence and a physical presence in a strategy known as [[bricks and clicks]]. ==Reintermediation== Reintermediation can be defined as the reintroduction of an intermediary between end users (consumers) and a producer. This term applies especially to instances in which disintermediation has occurred first. At the start of the Internet revolution, [[electronic commerce]] was seen as a tool of disintermediation for cutting operating costs. The concept was that by allowing consumers to purchase products directly from producers via the Internet, the product delivery chain would be drastically shortened, thereby "disintermediating" the standard supply model middlemen. However, what largely happened was that new intermediaries appeared in the digital landscape (e.g. witness the success of Amazon and Ebay).<ref>[Intermediaries and Cybermediaries: A Continuing Role for Mediating Players in the Electronic Marketplace http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol1/issue3/sarkar.html] Sarkar, Butler and Steinfield, 1995</ref>; Reintermediation occurred due to many new problems associated with the e-commerce disintermediation concept, largely centered on the issues associated with the direct-to-consumers model. The high cost of shipping many small orders, massive customer service issues, and confronting the wrath of disintermediated retailers and supply channel partners all presented real obstacles. Huge resources are required to accommodate presales and postsales issues of individual consumers. Before disintermediation, supply chain middlemen acted as salespeople for the producers. Without them, the producer itself would have to handle procuring those customers. Selling online has its own associated costs: developing quality websites, maintaining product information, and marketing expenses all add up. Finally, limiting a product's availability to Internet channels forces the producer to compete with the rest of the Internet for customers' attention, a space that is becoming increasingly crowded over time. ===Examples of companies=== The most notable example to disintermediation is [[Dell, Inc.|Dell]], which has succeeded in creating a brand, well recognized by consumers, profitable and with continuous growth. Likewise, maybe the most notable example of reintermediation is the [[Levi Strauss]] company, who unsuccessfully launched a multimillion dollar web site and later shut down most of its online operations{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}. == References == {{Reflist}} *Graham, Mark.

DiskXtender is produced by [[EMC Corporation]] and is supported on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]], and [[Unix]] environments. As of August 2011 DXUL-SM (DiskXtender Unix/Linux Storage Manager) will see this product become end-of-life{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}. The Windows version of DX implements a file-system filter driver that intercepts user mode I/O requests. These intercepted requests are then processed by DX components. If necessary, files are fetched off of secondary storage media and then passed back to the calling applications. Otherwise, if no processing is necessary, the filter driver does nothing and simply passes the request through the stack of lower level drivers. Other applications that implement similar architecture in terms of file system filters include anti-virus and file system replication software. [[Information Lifecycle Management]] As of 2003, DiskXtender is one of the three ILM offerings from EMC after EMC acquired Legato and focusing on File System archiving. The remaining two products include EmailXtender and DatabaseXtender which archive emails and database correspondingly. In any environment, a majority of data can be categorized as inactive (either not modified nor accessed for a long period of time) but yet still stored on primary storage. This results in a multifolded growth in capacity for production storage which increase costs for storage, protection, disaster recovery and management. For example, a file system of 1TB with annual growth of 25%. Every year, 25% data will need to be stored, protect, DR etc. which means 25% growth in all the storage, protection and DR systems. If, supposed 60% of the data is inactive and can be moved safely off the production, with the same growth rate, changes to the production system is only 40% * 25% =10% which is much easier to cope with. DiskXtender, by intercepting I/O from operating system, is capable of detecting inactive data and then migrating those data to secondary and/or tertiary storage with lower cost/GBs while still maintaining transparency to both applications and end users. Applications and end users have full visibility of migrated data and when access is requested, those migrated data will either be redirected to users and applications or copied back to the production system. == External links == * [http://software.emc.com/products/product_family/diskxtender_family.htm DiskXtender Family] (official site) {{DEFAULTSORT:Diskxtender}} [[Category:Windows software]] [[Category:Linux file system-related software]] [[Category:Unix file system-related software]]
