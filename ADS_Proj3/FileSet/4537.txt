[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] and [[Free Software Foundation]] claim trust in the underlying companies is not deserved and that the technology puts too much power and control into the hands of those who design systems and software. They also believe that it may cause consumers to lose anonymity in their online interactions, as well as mandating technologies Trusted Computing opponents deem unnecessary. They suggest Trusted Computing as a possible enabler for future versions of [[mandatory access control]], [[copy protection]], and [[digital rights management]]. Some security experts<ref>{{cite news | title = Trusted Computing comes under attack | url = http://news.zdnet.co.uk/internet/security/0,39020375,39249368,00.htm | publisher = ZDNet | first = Ingrid | last = Marson | date = 2006-01-27 | accessdate = 2007-02-07 }}</ref><ref name = "Schneier">{{cite news | url = http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-0208.html#1 | title = Palladium and the TCPA | date = 2002-08-15 | work = Crypto-Gram Newsletter | author = [[Bruce Schneier|Schneier, Bruce]] | accessdate = 2007-02-07 }}</ref> have spoken out against Trusted Computing, believing it will provide computer manufacturers and software authors with increased control to impose restrictions on what users are able to do with their computers. There are concerns that Trusted Computing would have an [[Anti-competitive practices|anti-competitive]] effect on competition in the IT market.<ref name = "Anderson"/> There is concern amongst critics that it will not always be possible to examine the hardware components on which Trusted Computing relies, the [[Trusted Platform Module]], which is the ultimate [[hardware]] system where the core 'root' of trust in the platform has to lie.<ref name = "Anderson"/> If not implemented correctly, it presents a security risk to overall platform integrity and protected data. The specifications, as published by the [[Trusted Computing Group]], are open and are available for anyone to review. However, the final implementations by commercial vendors will not necessarily be subjected to the same review process. In addition, the world of cryptography can often move quickly, and that hardware implementations of algorithms might create an inadvertent obsolescence. Trusting networked computers to controlling authorities rather than to individuals may create [[digital imprimatur]]s. The Cambridge cryptographer [[Ross J. Anderson|Ross Anderson]] has great concerns that "TC can support remote censorship [...] In general, digital objects created using TC systems remain under the control of their creators, rather than under the control of the person who owns the machine on which they happen to be stored (as at present) [...] So someone who writes a paper that a court decides is defamatory can be compelled to censor it &mdash; and the software company that wrote the word processor could be ordered to do the deletion if she refuses. Given such possibilities, we can expect TC to be used to suppress everything from pornography to writings that criticize political leaders."<ref name = "Anderson">{{cite web | url = http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/tcpa-faq.html | title = `Trusted Computing' Frequently Asked Questions: TC / TCG / LaGrande / NGSCB / Longhorn / Palladium / TCPA Version 1.1 |month=August | year=2003 | author = [[Ross J. Anderson|Anderson, Ross]] | accessdate = 2007-02-07 }}</ref> He goes on to state that: :[...] software suppliers can make it much harder for you to switch to their competitors' products. At a simple level, Word could encrypt all your documents using keys that only Microsoft products have access to; this would mean that you could only read them using Microsoft products, not with any competing word processor. [...] :The [...] most important benefit for Microsoft is that TC will dramatically increase the costs of switching away from Microsoft products (such as Office) to rival products (such as OpenOffice). For example, a law firm that wants to change from Office to OpenOffice right now merely has to install the software, train the staff and convert their existing files. In five years' time, once they have received TC-protected documents from perhaps a thousand different clients, they would have to get permission (in the form of signed digital certificates) from each of these clients in order to migrate their files to a new platform. The law firm won't in practice want to do this, so they will be much more tightly locked in, which will enable Microsoft to hike its prices.<ref name = "Anderson"/> Anderson summarizes the case by saying "The fundamental issue is that whoever controls the TC infrastructure will acquire a huge amount of power. Having this single point of control is like making everyone use the same bank, or the same accountant, or the same lawyer. There are many ways in which this power could be abused."<ref name = "Anderson"/> ===Digital rights management=== One of the early motivations behind trusted computing was a desire by media and software corporations for stricter [[digital rights management]] technology to prevent users from freely sharing and using potentially copyrighted or private files without explicit permission. An example could be downloading a music file from a band: the band's record company could come up with rules for how the band's music can be used. For example, they might want the user to play the file only three times a day without paying additional money. Also, they could use remote attestation to only send their music to a music player that enforces their rules: sealed storage would prevent the user from opening the file with another player that did not enforce the restrictions. Memory curtaining would prevent the user from making an unrestricted copy of the file while it is playing, and secure output would prevent capturing what is sent to the sound system. ===Users unable to modify software=== A user who wanted to switch to a competing program might find that it would be impossible for that new program to read old data, as the information would be "[[vendor lock-in|locked in]]" to the old program. It could also make it impossible for the user to read or modify their data except as specifically permitted by the software. Remote attestation could cause other problems.
