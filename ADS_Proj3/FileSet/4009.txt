directory (chmod g+s) causes new files and subdirectories created within it to '''inherit its groupID''', rather than the primary groupID of the user who created the file (the ownerID is never affected, only the groupID). Newly created subdirectories inherit the setgid bit. Note that setting the setgid permission on a directory only affects the groupID of new files and subdirectories created after the setgid bit is set, and is not applied to existing entities. Setting the setgid bit on existing subdirectories must be done manually, with a command such as the following: <code> [root@foo]# find /path/to/directory -type d -exec chmod g+s '{}' \;</code> The setuid permission set on a directory is ignored on [[UNIX]] and [[Linux]] systems <ref>{{cite web|last=Bauer|first=Mick|year=2004|url=http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7727|title=Paranoid Penguin - Linux Filesystem Security, Part II|publisher=linuxjournal.com}}</ref>. [[FreeBSD]] can be configured to interpret it analogously to setgid, namely, to force all files and sub-directories to be owned by the top directory owner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=chmod&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=FreeBSD+6.1-RELEASE&format=html|title=chmod manpage on www.freebsd.org}}</ref> == Security == Programs that use this bit must be carefully designed to be immune to buffer overrun attacks. Successful buffer overrun attacks on vulnerable applications allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code under the rights of the process being exploited. In the event a vulnerable process uses the setuid bit to run as root, the code will be executed with root privileges, in effect giving the attacker root access to the system on which the vulnerable process is running. ==History== The setuid bit was invented by [[Dennis Ritchie]]. His employer, AT&T, applied for a patent in 1972; the patent was granted in 1979 as patent number {{patent|US|4135240|"Protection of data file contents"}}. The patent was later placed in the public domain.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.textfiles.com/law/softpat.txt|title=Summary of key software patents}}</ref> == See also == * [[Confused deputy problem]] * [[sudo]] * [[PolicyKit]] * [[Unix security]] * [[chmod]] * [[User identifier (Unix)]] * [[Group identifier (Unix)]] * [[File system permissions]] * [[Privilege revocation]] * [[Privilege separation]] * [[Environment variable]] == References == {{Reflist}} ==External links== * Hao Chen, [[David A.

It occupies all of the [[space]] behind an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] object with light in front of it. The [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] of a shadow is a two-[[dimension]]al [[silhouette]], or reverse [[Projection (linear algebra)|projection]] of the object blocking the light.The sun causes many objects to have shadows and at certain times of the day, when the sun is at certain hights, the length of shadows change. An [[astronomical object]] casts human-visible shadows when its [[apparent magnitude]] is equal or lower than -4.<ref>[http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/scienceques2005/20060406.htm NASA Science Question of the Week, April 7, 2006]</ref> Currently the only astronomical objects able to produce visible shadows on Earth are the [[sun]], the [[moon]] and, in the right conditions, the planets of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]]. ==History== [[Image:101031 Italie sud 055.jpg|thumb|right|Shadow of a cactus on a wall]] A shadow
