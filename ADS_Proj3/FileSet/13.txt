Like in other cognitive architectures (e.g., [[ACT-R]]), these processing centers have been identified with corresponding cortical regions in the human brain. Performing specific task, such as reading or driving, requires the simultaneous contribution of many of such regions. Notably, 4CAPS differs from other architectures for its stress on the capacity constraints (that is, limited computational power), and the dynamic collaboration between different centers. In particular, according the Just and Varma <ref name="jv2006"/>, 4CAPS is based on four characteristic assumptions: # Each cortical area can perform multiple cognitive functions # Each cortical area has a limited capacity of computational resources # The cortical network of regions that is responsible for carrying out a particular task changes dynamically as the regions' capacity resources are saturated. # Communications between cortical regions is also subject to specific constraints, similar to bandwidth limitations along information channels. ==Implementation and Applications== Like other cognitive architectures (such as [[ACT-R]], [[EPIC (cognitive architecture)|EPIC]], and [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]]), 4CAPS is implemented as a [[production system]]<ref name="jv2006"/>. It is written in the [[Common Lisp]] programming language<ref>The source code for 4CAPS can be found at http://www.ccbi.cmu.edu/4CAPS/index.html</ref>. This system has been used to create computational models for a variety of phenomena, especially in the field of cognitive neuroscience. In particular, 4CAPS models have been created and used to fit behavioral and imaging data for tasks such as the Tower of London<ref>Newman, S. D., Carpenter, P. A., Varma, S., & Just, M. A. (2003).

In 2003 they were introduced to the (previously [[32-bit]]) mainstream [[personal computer]] arena, in the form of the [[x86-64]] and 64-bit [[PowerPC]] processor architectures. Without further qualification, a ''64-bit'' computer architecture generally has integer and addressing [[processor register|registers]] that are 64 bits wide, allowing direct support for 64-bit data types and addresses. However, a CPU might have external [[data bus]]es or [[address bus]]es with different sizes from the registers, even larger (the 32-bit [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] had a 64-bit data bus, for instance). The term may also refer to the size of low-level data types, such as 64-bit [[Floating point|floating-point]] numbers. ==Architectural implications== Processor registers are typically divided into several groups: ''integer'', ''floating-point'', ''[[SIMD]]'', ''control'', and often special registers for address arithmetic which may have various uses and names such as ''address'', ''index'' or ''base registers''. However, in modern designs, these functions are often performed by more general purpose ''integer'' registers. In most processors, only integer and/or address-registers can be used to address data in memory, the other types cannot. The size of these registers therefore normally limits the amount of directly addressable memory, even if there are registers, such as floating-point registers, that are wider. Most high performance 32-bit and 64-bit processors (some notable exceptions are most [[ARM architecture|ARM]] and 32-bit [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] CPUs) have integrated floating point hardware, which is often, but not always, based on 64-bit units of data. For example, although the [[x86]]/[[x87]] architecture has instructions capable of loading and storing 64-bit (and 32-bit) floating-point values in memory, the internal data and register format is 80 bits wide. In contrast, the 64-bit [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] family uses a 64-bit floating-point data and register format (as well as 64-bit integer registers). ==History== Most CPUs are designed so that the contents of a single integer register can store the [[memory address|address]] (location) of any datum in the computer's [[virtual memory]]. Therefore, the total number of addresses in
