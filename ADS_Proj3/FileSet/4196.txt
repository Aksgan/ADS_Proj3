The SMSS can travel up to 25 miles/h and carry up to 1000 pounds in gear. Unloaded, the SMSS weight up to 2000 pounds and can be parachuted from an [[aircraft]]. The SMSS can be driven by an operator or remotely operated. Currently the SMSS is unarmed, but there are plans to arm it with either [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]] or small [[missile]] systems. No SMSS are in service as of yet. Testing is expected to begin in Afghanistan sometime in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1884169,00.html?iid=tsmodule|title=Army Robots: Will Humans Still Be in Control?|quote=Meanwhile, the mountainous terrain and high altitudes of Afghanistan have led the Army to increasingly emphasize rapid delivery of anything that can lighten a soldier's load. As a result, the U.S. Army Infantry Center at Fort Benning, Ga., is experimenting with a 4,000-lb, six-wheeled semiautonomous, supply-carrying robot vehicle called the Squad Mission Support System (SMSS), which will likely head to the mountains of Afghanistan for testing sometime next year.|author=[[Kris Osborn]]|date=2009-03-15|work=[[Time magazine]]|language=English|accessdate=2009-03-16}}</ref> ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.spacewar.com/reports/Lockheed_Martin_Develops_Supervised_Autonomy_For_Unmanned_Ground_Vehicles_999.html Lockheed Martin Develops Supervised Autonomy For Unmanned Ground Vehicles] *[http://videos.howstuffworks.com/discovery/7122-future-weapons-smss-ground-vehicle-video.htm How Stuff Works] [[Category:Unmanned vehicles]] [[Category:Lockheed Martin]]</text> </page> <page> <id>35461</id> <title>Squib (weblog)</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=February 2009}} {{Infobox programming language |name = Squib |year = 2005 |designer = Matt Mower |developer = Matt Mower |latest_release_version = 0.5 |latest_release_date = [[2006]] |implementations = Ruby |influenced_by = [[Ruby (programming language)]] |operating_system = [[Cross-platform]] |license = [http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php Open Source Initiative OSI - The MIT License:Licensing] |website = [http://squib.rubyforge.org/ http://squib.rubyforge.org/] }} '''Squib''' is a free, open source, weblog publishing application available under the liberal MIT Licence. Squib is written in the [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] programming language and uses the [[Ruby on Rails]] web framework. ==History== Squib was written by Matt Mower in 2005. Squib was written as a replacement for his blogging package [[Radio Userland]] and an urge to learn [[Ruby on Rails|Rails]] <ref>[http://www.mattmower.org/ About Squib]</ref>.

There was a 0.4 branch intended to support multiple weblogs that was eventually abandoned. Squib 0.5 is the current stable release and was released in 2006 containing a few fixes and improvements to the 0.3 release. ==References== {{reflist|2}} == External links == *[http://squib.rubyforge.org/ Squib home page] *[http://www.mattmower.org/ Matt Mower home page] *[http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php Open Source Initiative OSI - The MIT License:Licensing] {{Ruby programming language}} [[Category:Free compilers and interpreters]] [[Category:Scripting languages]] [[Category:Ruby programming language]]</text> </page> <page> <id>35468</id> <title>Srivastava code</title> <text>In [[coding theory]], '''Srivastava codes''' form a class of parameterised [[Error detection and correction|error-correcting codes]] which are a special case of [[alternant code]]s. ==Definition== The original ''Srivastava code'' over GF(''q'') of length ''n'' is defined by a parity check matrix ''H'' of [[alternant matrix|alternant]] form :<math>\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\alpha_1^\mu}{\alpha_1-w_1} & \cdots & \frac{\alpha_n^\mu}{\alpha_n-w_1} \\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ \frac{\alpha_1^\mu}{\alpha_1-w_s} & \cdots & \frac{\alpha_n^\mu}{\alpha_n-w_s} \\ \end{bmatrix} </math> where the α<sub>''i''</sub> and ''z''<sub>''i''</sub> are elements of GF(''q''<sup>''m''</sup>) ==Properties== The parameters of this code are length ''n'', dimension ≥ ''n'' &minus; ''m''s and minimum distance ≥ s + 1. == References == * {{cite book | author=F.J.
