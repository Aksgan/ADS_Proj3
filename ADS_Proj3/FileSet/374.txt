</ref> It differs from simple [[disk mirroring]] in that it enables a roll-back of the log and thus restoration of old image of data. ; '''Full system backup''' : This type of backup is designed to allow an entire PC to be recovered to "bare metal" without any installation of operating system, application software and data. Most users understand that a backup will prevent "data" from being lost. The expense in a full system recovery is in the hours that it takes for a technician to rebuild a machine to the point of restoring the last data backup. So, a full system backup makes a complete [[system image|image]] of the computer so that if needed, it can be copied back to the PC, usually using some type of bespoke software such as [[Ghost (software)|Ghost]], and the user can carry on from that point. ===Storage media=== Regardless of the repository model that is used, the data has to be stored on some data storage medium somewhere. ; [[Magnetic tape data storage|Magnetic tape]] : Magnetic tape has long been the most commonly used medium for bulk data storage, backup, archiving, and interchange. Tape has typically had an order of magnitude better capacity/price ratio when compared to hard disk, but recently the ratios for tape and hard disk have become a lot closer.<ref>[http://www.storagesearch.com/engenio-art2.html Disk to Disk Backup versus Tape - War or Truce?] (9 December 2004). Retrieved on 10 March 2007 </ref> There are myriad formats, many of which are proprietary or specific to certain markets like mainframes or a particular brand of personal computer. Tape is a sequential access medium, so even though access times may be poor, the rate of continuously writing or reading data can actually be very fast. Some new tape drives are even faster than modern hard disks. A principal advantage of tape is that it has been used for this purpose for decades (much longer than any alternative) and its characteristics are well understood. ; [[Hard disk]] : The capacity/price ratio of hard disk has been rapidly improving for many years. This is making it more competitive with magnetic tape as a bulk storage medium. The main advantages of hard disk storage are low access times, availability, capacity and ease of use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/2007/04/18/bye_bye_tape/ |title=Bye Bye Tape, Hello 5.3TB eSATA |accessdate=22 April 2007}}</ref> External disks can be connected via local interfaces like [[SCSI]], [[USB]], [[FireWire]], or [[eSATA]], or via longer distance technologies like [[Ethernet]], [[iSCSI]], or [[Fibre Channel]]. Some disk-based backup systems, such as Virtual Tape Libraries, support [[data deduplication]] which can dramatically reduce the amount of disk storage capacity consumed by daily and weekly backup data. The main disadvantages of hard disk backups are that they are easily damaged, especially while being transported (e.g., for off-site backups), and that their stability over periods of years is a relative unknown. ; [[Optical storage]] : [[Blu-ray Disc]]s dramatically increase the amount of data possible on a single optical storage disk. Systems containing Blu-ray discs can store massive amounts of data and be more cost efficient than hard drives and magnetic tape. Some optical storage systems allow for cataloged data backups without human contact with the discs, allowing for longer data integrity. A [[recordable CD]] can be used as a backup device. One advantage of CDs is that they can be restored on any machine with a CD-ROM drive. (In practice, writable CD-ROMs are not always universally readable.) In addition, [[recordable CD]]'s are relatively cheap. Another common format is [[DVD recordable|recordable DVD]]. Many optical disk formats are [[Write Once Read Many|WORM]] type, which makes them useful for archival purposes since the data can't be changed. Other rewritable formats can also be utilized such as [[CD-RW]] or [[DVD-RAM]]. ; [[Floppy disk]] : During the 1980s and early 1990s, many personal/home computer users associated backing up mostly with copying to floppy disks. The low data capacity of a floppy disk makes it an unpopular and obsolete choice today.<ref>[http://www.seniortechcenter.org/data/choosing_a_data_backup.php Choosing a Data Backup Method]. Retrieved on 10 March 2007 </ref> ; [[Solid state storage]] : Also known as [[flash memory]], [[thumb drive]]s, [[USB flash drive]]s, [[CompactFlash]], [[SmartMedia]], [[Memory Stick]], [[Secure Digital card]]s, etc., these devices are relatively costly for their low capacity, but offer excellent portability and ease-of-use. ; [[Remote backup service]] : As [[broadband internet access]] becomes more widespread, remote backup services are gaining in popularity. Backing up via the internet to a remote location can protect against some worst-case scenarios such as fires, floods, or earthquakes which would destroy any backups in the immediate vicinity along with everything else. There are, however, a number of drawbacks to remote backup services. First, Internet connections are usually slower than local data storage devices. Residential broadband is especially problematic as routine backups must use an upstream link that's usually much slower than the downstream link used only occasionally to retrieve a file from backup. This tends to limit the use of such services to relatively small amounts of high value data. Secondly, users must trust a third party service provider to maintain the privacy and integrity of their data, although confidentiality can be assured by encrypting the data before transmission to the backup service with a [[key (cryptography)|encryption key]] known only to the user. Ultimately the backup service must itself use one of the above methods so this could be seen as a more complex way of doing traditional backups. ===Managing the data repository=== Regardless of the data repository model or data storage media used for backups, a balance needs to be struck between accessibility, security and cost. These media management methods are not mutually exclusive and are frequently combined to meet the needs of the situation. Using on-line disks for staging data before it is sent to a near-line [[tape library]] is a common example. ; [[Online|On-line]] : On-line backup storage is typically the most accessible type of data storage, which can begin restore in milliseconds time. A good example would be an internal hard disk or a [[disk array]] (maybe connected to
