Such devices may either be specially designed for the purpose of remote control of other devices (usually for controlling media playback and navigation) or may have be allowing of user-installed remote control application options. Touchscreen remote controls, which control other devices through various methods ([[Wi-Fi]], [[Bluetooth]], [[infrared]] or [[Wireless USB]]), incorporate less crowded, more dynamic and fluid user interfaces for virtual buttons; in the case of controlling another, larger visual device (such as a television), most touchscreen RC interfaces also incorporate in-remote [[virtual keyboard]]s for simultaneous text input onto the screen. ==Examples== * [[iTunes Remote]] application for [[iPhone OS]] * [[Sonos]] CR200 * [[Logitech]] Squeezebox Duet and Harmony 1000 * [[Philips]] Pronto TSU9400 * [[Universal Electronics]] NevoSL {{Home theater PC (application software)}} [[Category:Remote control]] [[Category:Touchscreens]] [[Category:Pointing-device text input]]</text> </page> <page> <id>37985</id> <title>Toxics Release Inventory</title> <text>[[Image:TRI-ME2006.jpg|thumb|right|250px|'''TRI-ME''', the TRI computer reporting program]] The '''Toxics Release Inventory''' (TRI) is a publicly available database containing information on [[toxic]] [[chemical]] releases and other [[waste management]] activities in the [[United States]]. ==Overview== ===Summary of requirements=== The database is available from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and contains information reported annually by certain industry groups as well as [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] facilities. Each year, companies across a wide range of industries (including chemical, mining, paper, oil and gas industries) that produce more than 25,000 pounds or handle more than 10,000 pounds of a listed toxic chemical must report it to the TRI. The TRI threshold was initially set at 75,000 pounds annually. If the company treats, recycles, disposes, or releases more than 500 pounds of that chemical into the environment (as opposed to just handling it), then they must provide a detailed inventory of that chemical's inventory. ===Origins of TRI=== The inventory was first proposed in a 1985 [[New York Times]] op-ed piece<ref>''Too Little Toxic Waste Data'', New York Times, Oct 7, 1985, pg A31</ref> written by David Sarokin and Warren Muir, researchers for an environmental group, INFORM. [[United States Congress|Congress]] established TRI under the [[Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act]] of 1986 ([[EPCRA]]), and later expanded it in the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990. The law grew out of concern surrounding [[Union Carbide|Union Carbide's]] releases of toxic gases in the 1984 [[Bhopal disaster]] and a smaller 1985 release in [[Institute, West Virginia]].<ref>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, DC.
