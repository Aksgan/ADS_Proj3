''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'', which completes the story, was released six months after ''Reloaded'', in November 2003. ==Plot== [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] wakes from a nightmare in which [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]] is shot by an agent of the Matrix while falling from a building. [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] receives a message from Captain [[Niobe (The Matrix)|Niobe]] ([[Jada Pinkett Smith]]) of the ''[[Logos (The Matrix)|Logos]]'' calling an emergency meeting of all of [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]]'s hovercraft. Zion has confirmed the last [[Final Flight of the Osiris|transmission]] of the ''Osiris'': an army of Sentinels is tunneling towards Zion and will reach it within 72 hours. [[List of minor characters in the Matrix series#Lock|Commander Lock]] ([[Harry Lennix|Harry J. Lennix]]), the ranking [[military officer]] of Zion, orders all ships to return to Zion to prepare for the onslaught. Morpheus asks a ship to remain in order to contact the Oracle, in defiance of Commander Lock's orders. The ''[[List of ships in the Matrix series#Caduceus|Caduceus]]'' receives a message from the Oracle, and the ''[[List of ships in the Matrix series#Nebuchadnezzar ("Neb")|Nebuchadnezzar]]'' ventures out so Neo can contact her. One of the ''Caduceus''' crew, [[List of minor characters in the Matrix series#Bane|Bane]], encounters [[Agent Smith]], who takes over Bane's avatar. Smith then leaves the Matrix, gaining control of Bane's real body. In Zion's temple, Morpheus announces the news of the advancing machines to the people. Neo receives a message from the Oracle and returns to the Matrix, meeting her. After realizing that the Oracle is part of the Matrix, Neo asks how he can trust her; she replies that it is his decision. The Oracle explains that she is an exiled program and instructs Neo to reach the Source of the Matrix by finding the [[Keymaker (The Matrix)|Keymaker]], a prisoner in the home of the [[Merovingian (The Matrix)|Merovingian]]. The Keymaker makes keys that can open portals hidden within the Matrix. As the Oracle departs, Smith appears, telling Neo that after being defeated, he knew he was supposed to return to the Source to be deleted, but refused, and is now not bound to remove threats from the Matrix. He demonstrates his ability to clone himself using other people in the Matrix as hosts. He then tries to absorb Neo as a host, but fails, prompting a fight between Neo and Smith's clones. Neo is more than a match for each clone individually, and is able to more than hold his own against the growing army of Smith clones. Unfortunately, Smith's clones keep coming in more and more numbers, until eventually, overwhelmingly outnumbered, Neo flees. Neo, Morpheus and Trinity visit the Merovingian and ask for the Keymaker, but the Merovingian refuses. His wife [[Persephone (The Matrix)|Persephone]], tired of her husband's attitude, betrays him and leads the trio to the Keymaker, allowing one of the Merovingian's henchmen to escape and notify him of it. The Merovingian soon appears and, while Morpheus, Trinity, and the Keymaker escape, Neo fights the Merovingian's henchmen and ends up in an unknown mountain range. He then heads for town, where Morpheus and Trinity are trying to escape with the Keymaker on the highway, facing several Agents and [[Twins (The Matrix)|The Twins]]. Ultimately, the Twins are destroyed, and Neo saves Morpheus and the Keymaker. Zion's remaining ships prepare to battle the machines. Within the Matrix, the crews of the ''Nebuchadnezzar'', ''Vigilant'' and ''Logos'' help the Keymaker and Neo reach the door to the Source. The crew of the ''Logos'' must [[Enter The Matrix|destroy a power plant]] in order to prevent a security system from being triggered by the Keymaker's keys, and the crew of the ''Vigilant'' must destroy a back-up power station. The ''Logos'' is successful, while the ''Vigilant'' is bombed by a Sentinel, killing everyone on board. Although Neo requested that Trinity remain on the ''Nebuchadnezzar'', she destroys the back-up station. However, her escape is compromised by an agent, and they fight. As Neo, Morpheus and the Keymaker reach the Source through a hallway of shortcuts to other doors in the Matrix, the Smiths appear and try to kill them. The Keymaker unlocks the door to the Source, allowing Neo and Morpheus to escape the Smiths, but the Keymaker is killed. Neo meets an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] program called the [[Architect (The Matrix)|Architect]], the Matrix's creator. The Architect tells Neo that there have been multiple versions of the Matrix and multiple versions of the One, a computer anomaly used as a means of control. As humanity rejected the "perfect" Matrix as well as the dystopian Matrix, the machines realized that humanity needed to be offered the power of choice in order for them to accept it. The current Matrix is flawed and remains an unbalanced equation. The One is the sum of the remainder of that flaw. The One's purpose is to return to the Source, resetting the Matrix to its prime program. Afterwards, he will choose sixteen females and seven males to repopulate Zion and provide another round of humans for the "rebellion". Otherwise, the unresolved error will spiral out of control, destroying the humans connected to the Matrix, which coupled with the battle at Zion, will result in the [[Human extinction|extinction of the human race]]. Neo retorts that the machines need humans to survive and will not allow this; the Architect replies that, "there are levels of survival we are prepared to accept". The Architect gives Neo a choice of two exits from the room: one door leads to the Source and the resetting of the Matrix, the other will lead to the Matrix's failure and humanity's destruction. Neo notices Trinity's battle with the agent on the viewscreens and returns to the Matrix to save her. Neo's
