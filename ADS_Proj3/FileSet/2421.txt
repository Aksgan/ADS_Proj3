key of [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]]. This is intended to increase the complexity of a [[brute force attack]], increasing the effective size of the key without major changes in the algorithm. DES-X's inventor, [[Ron Rivest]], named the technique ''whitening''. The cipher [[FEAL]] (followed by [[Khufu and Khafre]]) introduced the practice of key whitening using portions of the same key used in the rest of the cipher. Obviously this offers no additional protection from brute force attacks, but it can make other attacks more difficult. In a [[Feistel cipher]] or similar algorithm, key whitening can increase security by concealing the specific inputs to the first and last round functions. In particular, it is not susceptible to a [[meet-in-the-middle attack]]. This form of key whitening has been adopted as a feature of many later block ciphers, including [[MARS (cryptography)|MARS]], [[RC6]], and [[Twofish]]. ==References== {{cite book | last = Schneier | first = Bruce | authorlink = Bruce Schneier | title = Applied Cryptography | edition = 2nd | publisher = [[John Wiley & Sons]] | date = 1996 | pages = 366&ndash;367 | isbn = 0-471-11709-9 }} {{Crypto navbox | block}} [[Category:Key management]] [[Category:Block ciphers]] [[de:Key Whitening]] [[it:Key whitening]] [[simple:Key whitening]]</text> </page> <page> <id>20621</id> <title>Keyboard shortcut</title> <text>{{selfref|For Wikipedia keyboard shortcuts, see [[Wikipedia:Keyboard shortcuts]].}} {{selfref|For a list of keyboard shortcuts, see [[Table of keyboard shortcuts]].}} {{refimprove|date=December 2010}} [[Image:Firefoxshortcuts.png|thumb|300px|right|[[Mozilla Firefox 3|Firefox 3.0]] menu with shortcuts highlighted with green and mnemonics highlighted with yellow.]] In [[computing]], a '''keyboard shortcut''' is a finite set of one or more [[Computer keyboard|key]]s that invoke a [[software]] or [[operating system]] operation when triggered by the [[User (computing)|user]]. A meaning of term "keyboard shortcut" can vary depending on software manufacturer. For instance, Microsoft differentiates keyboard shortcuts from '''hotkeys''' (mnemonics) whereby the former consists of a specific key combination used to trigger an action, and the latter represents a designated letter in a menu command or toolbar button that when pressed together with the Alt key, activates such command. ==Description== Keyboard shortcuts are typically an alternate means for invoking one or more commands that would otherwise be accessible only through a [[menu (computing)|menu]], a [[pointing device]], different levels of a [[user interface]], or via a [[command line|command console]]. Keyboard shortcuts generally expedite common operations by reducing input sequences to a few keystrokes, hence the term "shortcut".<ref name="shortcut_lingo">In the English language a "shortcut" may unintentionally suggest an incomplete or sloppy way of completing something. Consequently, some computer applications designed to be controlled mainly by the keyboard, such as [[Emacs]], use the alternate term "key binding".</ref> Some keyboard shortcuts require the user to press a single key or a sequence of keys one after the other. Other keyboard shortcuts require pressing and holding several keys simultaneously. For simultaneous keyboard shortcuts, one usually first holds down the [[modifier key]](s), then quickly presses and releases the regular (non-modifier) key, and finally releases the modifier key(s). This distinction is important, as trying to press all the keys simultaneously will frequently either miss some of the modifier keys, or cause unwanted auto-repeat. One exception is shortcuts involving the {{keypress|Esc}} key, which almost always requires pressing and releasing the Esc key before pressing the next key. [[mnemonics (keyboard)|Mnemonics]] are distinguishable from keyboard shortcuts. One difference between them is that the keyboard shortcuts are not localized on multi-language software but the mnemonics are generally localized to reflect the symbols and letters used in the specific locale. In most [[GUI]]s, a program's keyboard shortcuts are discoverable by browsing the program's menus - the shortcut is indicated in the menu choice. There are keyboards, commonly called [[Specialty Keyboards]] that have the shortcuts for a particular application already marked on them. These keyboards can help the users learn the shortcuts and improve their speed of using the particular applications. In certain cases, those keyboards can be created by applying shortcut stickers on a regular keyboard, which usually gives quicker access to software program features not visible otherwise. Such keyboards are often used for editing video, audio, or graphics,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-27076_3-10409035-248.html|title=Hardware for Gmail: The 'Gboard' keyboard|publisher=[[CNET.com]]|date=3 December 2009|accessdate=7 January 2011|first=Josh|last=Lowensohn}}</ref> as well as in software training courses. == Customization == When shortcuts are referred to as '''key bindings''' it carries the connotation that the shortcuts are customizable to a user's preference and that program functions may be 'bound' to a different set of keystrokes instead of or in addition to the default.{{citation needed|date=March 2009}}<!--all things that keys do are bindings, a key is meaningless without a binding--> This highlights a difference in philosophy regarding shortcuts. Some systems, typically [[end-user]]-oriented systems such as [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] or [[Macintosh]] consider standardized shortcuts essential to the environment's ease of use. These systems usually limit a user's ability to change shortcuts, typically requiring a separate, possibly third-party, utility to perform the task. Other systems, typically [[Unix]] and related, consider shortcuts to be a user's prerogative, and that they should be changeable to suit individual preference. [[Hardcore gamers]] often customize their key bindings in order to increase performance via faster reaction times. In most real-world environments, both philosophies co-exist; a core set of ''sacred'' shortcuts remain fixed while others, typically involving an otherwise unused modifier key or keys, are under the user's control. === "Sacred" Keybindings === The original Macintosh interface defined a set of keyboard shortcuts that would remain consistent across application programs. This provides a better [[user experience]] than the situation then prevalent of applications using wholly-unrelated keys for different functions. This could result in [[data loss]] under multitasking systems if, for example, one program used {{cmd}}-D to mean "Delete" while another used it to access a "Disk" menu. The standard bindings were: *{{cmd}}-Q : '''Q'''uit *{{cmd}}-W : Close '''W'''indow *{{cmd}}-I : '''I'''talicize text *{{cmd}}-U : '''U'''nderline text *{{cmd}}-O : '''O'''pen *{{cmd}}-P : '''P'''rint *{{cmd}}-A : Select '''A'''ll *{{cmd}}-S : '''S'''ave *{{cmd}}-F : '''F'''ind *{{cmd}}-Z : Undo (resembles the action of striking out a mistake) *{{cmd}}-X : Cut (resembles scissors) *{{cmd}}-C : '''C'''opy *{{cmd}}-V : Paste (resembles an arrow pointing downward "into" the document or a brush used for
