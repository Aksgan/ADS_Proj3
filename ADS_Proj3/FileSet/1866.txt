when [[Gerald Jay Sussman|the Sussman]] was a novice, [[Marvin Minsky|Minsky]] once came to him as he sat hacking at the [[PDP-6]].'' :"What are you doing?", ''asked Minsky.'' :"I am training a randomly wired [[neural network|neural net]] to play [[Tic-tac-toe]]", ''Sussman replied.'' :"Why is the net wired randomly?", ''asked Minsky.'' :"I do not want it to have any preconceptions of how to play", ''Sussman said.'' :''Minsky then shut his eyes.'' :"Why do you close your eyes?" ''Sussman asked his teacher.'' :"So that the room will be empty." :''At that moment, Sussman was enlightened.'' Similar to traditional Zen koans, this koan has a possible concrete and correct answer: just as the room is not really empty when Minsky shuts his eyes, neither is the neural network really free of preconceptions when it is randomly wired. The network still has preconceptions, they are simply random now, and from a [[randomness|random]] rather than a [[human]] source. This particular koan seems to have been closely based on a real incident; the following text extract is from ''[[Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution]]'' (chapter 6): {{cquote|So Sussman began working on a program. Not long after, this odd-looking bald guy came over. Sussman figured the guy was going to boot him out, but instead the man sat down, asking, "Hey, what are you doing?" Sussman talked over his program with the man, Marvin Minsky. At one point in the discussion, Sussman told Minsky that he was using a certain randomizing technique in his program because he didn't want the machine to have any preconceived notions. Minsky said, "Well, it has them, it's just that you don't know what they are." It was the most profound thing Gerry Sussman had ever heard. And Minsky continued, telling him that the world is built a certain way, and the most important thing we can do with the world is avoid randomness, and figure out ways by which things can be planned. Wisdom like this has its effect on seventeen-year-old freshmen, and from then on Sussman was hooked.|20px|20px|Steven Levy|[http://sch57.msk.ru/~khim/hackers/part1/chapter6.html HACKERS: Heroes of the Computer Revolution]}} ===Victory=== :''A student was playing a handheld video game during a class.'' :''The teacher called on the student and asked him what he was doing.'' :''The student replied that he was trying to master the game.'' :''The teacher said, ''"There exists a state in which you will not attempt to master the game, and the game will not attempt to master you." :''The student asked, ''"What is this state?" :''The teacher said,'' "Give me your video game, and I will show you." :''The student gave him the game, and the teacher threw it to the ground, breaking it into pieces. The student was enlightened.'' A very similar story exists in the ''[[The Tao of Programming]]''. ===Enlightenment=== This koan is attributed to [[Tom Knight (scientist)|Tom Knight]], one of the primary developers of the [[Lisp machine]] at MIT: :''A novice was trying to fix a broken Lisp machine by turning the power off and on.'' :''Knight, seeing what the student was doing, spoke sternly: ''"You cannot fix a machine by just power-cycling it with no understanding of what is going wrong." :''Knight turned the machine off and on.'' :''The machine worked.'' ===Master Foo=== :''It is recorded that once, when Master [[Foo]] was [[iteration|iterating]] along a beach, he came upon two of his disciples arguing by a computer processor. :"It is subtracting [[1 (number)|positive 1]]"'', declared the first.'' :"No; it is adding [[−1 (number)|negative 1]]"'', asserted the other.'' :''Master Foo answered them thus: ''"Not incrementing, not decrementing — Equalizing!"'' whereupon both were enlightened.'' ::(Derived from "[[The Gateless Gate#Case 29: Huineng's flag|Huineng's flag]]", Case 29, [[The Gateless Gate]].) ===Emacs and Bolio=== This particular koan is sometimes [[pun]]ningly referred to as an “ice cream koan”, though that term also refers to an ice cream koan in [[q:Jack Kerouac#The Dharma Bums (1958)|The Dharma Bums]]. This koan refers to AI Lab tools that predate the [[GNU]] project: : ''A cocky novice once said to [[Richard Stallman|Stallman]]:'' “I can guess why the editor is called [[Emacs]], but why is the [[Markup language|justifier]] called Bolio?”. ''Stallman replied forcefully'', “Names are but names, ‘[[Emack & Bolio's]]’ is the name of a popular ice cream shop in [[Boston]]-town. Neither of these men had anything to do with the software.” : ''His question answered, yet unanswered, the novice turned to go, but Stallman called to him,'' “Neither Emack nor Bolio had anything to do with the ice cream shop, either.”<ref>This is correct – the store is named after two homeless men. See [[Emack & Bolio's#Name]]. (This is not correct. Emack and Bolio knew the store owner, and served as a mascot for the original store for a time{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}.)</ref> A possible interpretation is that this is about the arbitrariness of [[identifier]]s in computer code – the name of variables does not affect the function of the code. ==Collections== [[Eric S.
