This article covers only some of the software used. ==Uses== 3D modelers are used in a wide variety of industries. The medical industry uses them to create detailed models of organs. The movie industry uses them to create and manipulate characters and objects for animated and real-life [[film|motion pictures]]. The [[video game industry]] uses them to create assets for [[video game]]s. The science sector uses them to create highly detailed models of chemical compounds. The architecture industry uses them to create models of proposed buildings and landscapes. The engineering community uses them to design new devices, vehicles and structures as well as a host of other uses. There are typically many stages in the "[[Pipeline (computing)|pipeline]]" that studios and manufacturers use to create 3D objects for film, games, and production of hard goods and structures. ==Features== Many 3D modelers are designed to model various real-world entities, from [[plant]]s to [[automobile]]s to [[human|people]]. Some are specially designed to model certain objects, such as chemical compounds or internal [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s. 3D modelers allow users to create and alter models via their 3D mesh. Users can add, subtract, stretch and otherwise change the mesh to their desire. Models can be viewed from a variety of angles, usually simultaneously. Models can be rotated and the view can be zoomed in and out. 3D modelers can export their models to [[computer file|files]], which can then be imported into other applications as long as the [[metadata]] is compatible. Many modelers allow [[importer (computing)|importers]] and [[exporter (computing)|exporters]] to be [[plugin|plugged-in]], so they can read and write data in the native formats of other applications. Most 3D modelers contain a number of related features, such as [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracers]] and other rendering alternatives and [[texture mapping]] facilities. Some also contain features that support or allow animation of models. Some may be able to generate [[full-motion video]] of a series of rendered scenes (i.e. [[animation]]). ==Commercial packages== A basic comparison including release date/version information can be found on the [[Comparison of 3D computer graphics software]] page. A comprehensive comparison of significant 3D packages can be found at [http://wiki.cgsociety.org/index.php/Comparison_of_3d_tools CG Society Wiki] and [http://www.tdt3d.be/articles_viewer.php?art_id=99 TDT3D 3D applications 2007 comparisons table.]. *'''[[3ds Max]]''' ([[Autodesk]]), originally called 3D Studio MAX, is a comprehensive and versatile 3D application used in film, television, video games and architecture for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. It can be extended and customized through its SDK or scripting using a Maxscript. It can use third party rendering options such as [[Brazil R/S]], [[finalRender]] and [[V-Ray]]. *'''[[AC3D]]''' (Inivis) is a 3D modeling application that began in the 90's on the [[Commodore Amiga|Amiga]] platform. Used in a number of industries, [[MathWorks]] actively recommends it in many of their aerospace-related articles<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/toolbox/aeroblks/index.html?/access/helpdesk/help/toolbox/aeroblks/f3-22568.html |title=About Aerospace Coordinate Systems |accessdate=2007-11-23 }}</ref> due to price and compatibility. AC3D does not feature its own renderer, but can generate output files for both [[RenderMan]] and [[POV-Ray]] among others. *'''[[Aladdin4D]]''' ([[DiscreetFX]]), first created for the [[Commodore Amiga|Amiga]], was originally developed by [[Adspec Programming]]. After acquisition by DiscreetFX, it is multi-platform for [[Mac OS X]], Amiga OS 4.1, [[MorphOS]], [[Linux]], [[AROS]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. *'''[[Alibre Design]]''' ([[Alibre Inc.]]), 3D design software. Alibre Design 2011 is a parametric 3D CAD suite that provides 3D model creation and documentation capabilities for a variety of downstream applications such as CAM, Rendering or 3D Printing. The software consists of several integrated modules that allow the creation of parts, unfoldable sheet metal parts, assemblies, and 2D drawings. photo realistic rendering and CAM. [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. *'''[[Animation:Master]]''' from HASH, Inc is a modeling and animation package that focuses on ease of use. It is a spline-based modeler. Its strength lies in character animation. *'''[[Carrara (software)|Carrara]]''' ([[DAZ Productions]]) is a fully-featured 3D toolset for modeling, texturing, scene rendering and animation. *'''[[Cinema 4D]]''' ([[MAXON]]) is a light (Prime) to full featured (Studio) 3d package dependant on version used. Although used in film usually for 2.5d work, Cinema's largest user base is in the television motion graphics and design/visualisation arenas. Originally developed for the [[Commodore Amiga|Amiga]], it is also available for [[Mac OS X]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Linux]]. *'''[[CityEngine]]''' ([[Procedural Inc]]) is a [[3D modeling]] application specialized in the generation of three dimensional urban environments. With the [[procedural modeling]] approach, [[CityEngine]] enables the efficient creation of detailed large-scale 3D city models, it is available for [[Mac OS X]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Linux]]. * '''[[Cobalt (CAD program)|Cobalt]]''' is a [[Solid_modeling#Parametric_Solid_modeling_CAD|parametric-based]] [[Computer-aided design]] (CAD) and [[3D modeling]] software for both the [[Macintosh]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. It integrates [[wireframe]], freeform surfacing, feature-based solid modeling and photo-realistic rendering (see [[Ray tracing (graphics)|Ray tracing]]), and animation. *'''[[Electric Image Animation System]]''' ([[EI Technology Group]]) is a 3D animation and rendering package available on both [[Mac OS X]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. Mostly known for its rendering quality and rendering speed it does not include a built-in modeler. The popular film ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl|Pirates of the Caribbean]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pr.com/press-release/35014 |title=Electric Image Animation Software (EIAS) v6.6.1 UB Port Is Shipping |accessdate=2007-11-23 }}</ref> and the television series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eitechnologygroup.com/products/production_list/ |title=EIAS Production List |accessdate=2007-11-23 }}</ref> used the software. *'''[[form-Z|form•Z]]''' ([[AutoDesSys, Inc.]]) is a general purpose solid/surface 3D modeler.
