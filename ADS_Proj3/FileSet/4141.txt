is needed (70–200 mm for a 35 mm camera), and for the disk to fill most of the frame, a longer lens is needed (over 500 mm). As with viewing the sun directly, looking at it through the viewfinder of a [[camera]] can produce damage to the retina, so care is advised.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eclipse-chasers.com/eclphot.htm |title=Photographing the Total Solar Eclipse |publisher=Eclipse-chasers.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-07}}</ref> ==Other observations== [[Image:2008-08-01 Solar eclipse progression with timestamps.jpg|thumb|The progression of a solar eclipse on August 1, 2008 in [[Novosibirsk]], [[Russia]]. All times UTC (local time was UTC+7). The time span between shots is three minutes.]] For [[astronomers]], a total solar eclipse forms a rare opportunity to observe the [[corona]] (the outer layer of the Sun's atmosphere). Normally this is not visible because the [[photosphere]] is much brighter than the corona. According to the point reached in the [[solar cycle]], the corona may appear small and symmetric, or large and fuzzy. It is very hard to predict this prior to totality.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The science of eclipses |publisher=ESA |url=http://www.esa.int/esaSC/SEMYK9R1VED_index_0.html |accessdate=2007-08-04}}</ref> During a solar eclipse, special (indirect) observations can also be achieved with the unaided eye only. Normally the spots of light which fall through the small openings between the leaves of a tree have a circular shape. These are images of the Sun. During a partial eclipse, the light spots will show the partial shape of the Sun, as seen on the picture. Another famous phenomenon is [[shadow bands]] (also known as ''flying shadows''), which are similar to shadows on the bottom of a swimming pool. They only occur just prior to and after totality, and are very difficult to observe. Many professional eclipse chasers have never been able to witness them.<ref>{{Cite web|author=D. Dravins |title=Flying Shadows |publisher=Lund Observatory |url=http://www.astro.lu.se/~dainis/HTML/FLYSHAD.html}}</ref> During a partial eclipse, a related effect that can be seen is anisotropy in the shadows of objects. Particularly if the partial eclipse is nearly total, the unobscured part of the sun acts as an approximate line source of light. This means that objects cast shadows which have a very narrow penumbra in one direction, but a broad penumbra in the perpendicular direction. ===1919 observations=== [[Image:1919 eclipse negative.jpg|thumb|upright|The original photograph of the 1919 eclipse which was claimed to confirm [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]].]] The observation of a total [[solar eclipse of May 29, 1919]] helped to confirm [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]]. By comparing the apparent distance between two stars, with and without the Sun between them, [[Arthur Eddington]] stated that the [[predictive power|theoretical predictions]] about [[gravitational lens]]es were confirmed, though it now appears the data was ambiguous at the time. The observation with the Sun between the stars was only possible during totality, since the stars are then visible.<ref>{{Cite web|publisher=ESA |title=Relativity and the 1919 eclipse |url=http://www.esa.int/esaSC/SEM7I9R1VED_index_1.html |accessdate=2007-08-04}}</ref> ===Gravity anomalies=== There is a long history of observations of gravity-related phenomena during solar eclipses, especially around totality. In 1954 and again in 1959, [[Maurice Allais]] reported observations of strange and unexplained movement during solar eclipses.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Maurice |last=Allais |title=Should the Laws of Gravitation be Reconsidered? |journal=Aero/Space Engineering |volume=9 |pages=46–55 |year=1959 |postscript=<!--None--> }}</ref> This phenomenon is now called the [[Allais Effect]]. Similarly, Saxl and Allen in 1970 observed sudden change in motion of a torsion pendulum, and this phenomenon is called the Saxl effect.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Erwin J. |last=Saxl |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Mildred |last2=Allen |title=1970 solar eclipse as 'seen' by a torsion pendulum |journal=[[Physical Review D]] |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=823–825 |year=1971 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.3.823 |postscript=<!--None--> }}</ref> A recent published observation during the 1997 solar eclipse by Wang ''et al.'' suggested a possible gravitational shielding effect,<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Qian-shen|last= Wang|coauthors=Xin-she Yang, Chuan-zhen Wu, Hong-gang Guo, Hong-chen Liu, & Chang-chai Hua |title=Precise measurement of gravity variations during a total solar eclipse |journal=Physical Review D |volume=62 |issue=4 |page=041101(R) |year=2000 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.62.041101 |postscript=<!--None--> }}</ref> though there is some serious debate.

It is, however, possible for a solar eclipse to attain totality (or in the event of a partial eclipse, near-totality) before (visual and actual) sunrise or after sunset from a particular location. When this occurs shortly before the former or after the latter, the sky will appear much darker than it would otherwise be immediately before sunrise or after sunset. On these occasions, an object (especially a [[planet]], often [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]) may be visible near the sunrise or sunset point of the horizon when it could not have been seen without the eclipse.<ref>{{Cite web|author=D. Criner |title=Musings About Twilight |url=http://www.enginova.com/twilight.htm}}</ref> ===Eclipses and transits=== In principle, the simultaneous occurrence of a Solar eclipse and a transit of a planet is possible. But these events are extremely rare because of their short durations. The next anticipated simultaneous occurrence of a Solar eclipse and a [[transit of Mercury]] will be on July 5, 6757, and a Solar eclipse and a [[transit of Venus]] is expected on April 5, [[15232]].<ref>{{Cite web|author=J. Meeus and A. Vitagliano |title=Simultaneous transits |url=http://www.marco-peuschel.de/simtrans.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> Only five hours after the transit of Venus on June 4, 1769, there was a total solar eclipse, which was visible in Northern America, Europe, and Northern Asia as partial solar eclipse. This was the lowest time difference between a transit of a planet and a solar eclipse in the historical past. More common, but still infrequent, is a [[astronomical conjunction|conjunction]] of any planet (not only Mercury or Venus) at the time of a total solar eclipse, in which event the planet will be visible very near the eclipsed Sun, when without the eclipse it would have been lost in the Sun's glare. At one time, some scientists hypothesized that there
