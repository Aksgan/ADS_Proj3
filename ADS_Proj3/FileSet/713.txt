digital library and continues in the CiteSeer tradition. As an example, CiteSeer's notion of "contribution" to [[acknowledgment (creative arts)|acknowledgments]] in addition to citations made it the first automatically generated [[acknowledgment index]]. CiteSeer<sup>''x''</sup> is designed differently from CiteSeer with new algorithms for entity extraction and a modular, expandable, robust, scalable architecture based on the open source tool [[SeerSuite]] which uses [[Solr]] and many other Apache projects. As such, CiteSeer<sup>''x''</sup> hopes to promote the creation of other Seer-like systems. This design has permitted CiteSeer<sup>"x"</sup> to add a new table search feature and a feature for author disambiguation. CiteSeer<sup>''x''</sup> regularly gives away its data resources such as document pdfs, ascii, databases and metadata to other researchers and scholar. The current model of distribution is [[rsync]]. The Next Generation CiteSeer, CiteSeer<sup>''x''</sup>, is now available in beta [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu] with now over 1.5 million documents indexed and is constantly growing. ==See also== * [[Citation index]] * [[CiteSeerX]] * [[CiteULike]] * [[ChemXSeer]] * [[The Collection of Computer Science Bibliographies]] * [[DBLP]] (Digital Bibliography & Library Project) * [[getCITED]] * [[Google Scholar#Scholar|Google Scholar]] * [[Institute for Scientific Information]]'s [[Web of Science]] * [[Libra (Academic Search)]] * [[List of academic databases and search engines]] * [[Scirus]] * [[Scopus]] * [[SeerSuite]] * [[SmealSearch]] ==References== {{No footnotes|date=July 2009}} {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu Official website of CiteSeer<sup>''x''</sup>] * [http://paracite.eprints.org ParaCite] * [http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/search Citebase] * [http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/ DBLP] * [http://liinwww.ira.uka.de/bibliography/index.html The Collection of Computer Science Bibliographies] (includes among other collections also CiteSeer and DBLP) *[http://cs-structure.inr.ac.ru/ CiteSeer search tool] *[http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/aci-computer/aci-computer99.html Digital Libraries and Autonomous Citation Indexing] by Steve Lawrence, C.

On 18 April 2006 it was announced that instead of continuing as a separate project, it would be integrated into the '''[[National Identity Register]]''', the database behind the proposed national identity cards. It has been estimated that this might add £200 million to the cost of the identity cards [http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labour/story/0,,1756464,00.html]. ==Scope and purpose== The register was to have been used as a single reference point for government contact, for the exchange of personal contact data, and for the collection of [[statistics]], so reducing duplication in government departments and agencies. Government databases would have been linked together using [[National Insurance]] or other personal numbers. In late 2003 the project moved into a definition phase. It was hoped that the CIP would be able to use data from the proposed [[National Identity Register]]. A report on preliminary testing was due in April 2005, and it had been expected that it would have been implemented before the end of 2007 if approval had been given by Government. Initial estimates in 2004 suggested that the costs might have been £1.2 - £2.4 billion (240 million annually for a period of 5 to 10 years). ==External links== * [http://www.gro.gov.uk/cip/ Citizen Information Project] * [http://www.kablenet.com/kd.nsf/Frontpage/42B580307B3D8F5780256EC9003A7D21?OpenDocument Testing of technology involved in a UK population register is soon to begin] * [http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200304/cmselect/cmhaff/uc130-vi/uc13002.htm Evidence to the Homes Affairs Committee on the CIP in relation to ID cards] * [http://www.bigbrotherawards.org Big Brother Awards] * [http://www.privacyinternational.org Privacy International] [[Category:Databases in the United Kingdom]] [[Category:Programmes of the Government of the United Kingdom]] [[Category:Office for National Statistics]]</text> </page> <page> <id>6334</id> <title>CitySurf Globe</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=February 2009}} {{Infobox Software | name = CitySurf Globe | logo = [[Image:Citysurflogo.jpg]] | screenshot = [[Image:Citysurfglobe.jpg]] | caption = | developer = [[PiriReis Bilişim Teknolojileri]] | released = | latest_release_version = | latest_release_date = | programming language = | size = | operating system = [[Windows 2000]], [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Server 2003]]| | language = English, Turkish, Arabic | genre = [[GIS]] | license = | website = http://www.citysurf.com.tr }} '''CitySurf Globe''' is a family of Geography 2.0 [[Geographical Information System]] software, developed by [[PiriReis Bilişim Teknolojileri]], known as a new model in mapping servers and interaction with the final user. '''CitySurf Globe''' family models raster data, such as high resolution [[satellite images]] and aerial images, under high speeds using [[digital terrain model]] and vector [[geographical information systems]] and accordingly serves these via internet or local nets. Prepares geographical analyses and arranges the geographical data thanks to its interaction with the final user. '''CitySurf Globe''' has an [[OpenGL]]-based viewer, which connects to the servers for streaming of content, elevation, satellite and/or airphoto imagery, roads, 3D buildings, points of interest, etc. This is similar to [[Google Earth]], [[Microsoft Virtual Earth]], and [[ArcGIS]] concepts. ==CitySurf Globe Screenshots== <gallery> Image:Citysurfturism.JPG| Image:Citysurf3d.JPG| Image:Citysurfwikipedi.JPG| </gallery> == Applications Areas == * 3D city information system * 3D visualization of for civil engineering, landscape design and urban planning * Military and defence * Real estate industry * Oil, gas and electric industry * Travel and tourism [[Category:Earth sciences graphics software]]</text> </page> <page> <id>6338</id> <title>Civil Pages</title> <text>{{Cleanup|date=December 2010}} The '''Civil Pages''' is a computer system that acts as a private social media site for the UK [[Civil Service]].
