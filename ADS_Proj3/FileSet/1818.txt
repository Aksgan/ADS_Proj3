signer of the Declaration of Independence, helped design the American flag, and also helped design state and other government seals. He made two similar proposals, each having an obverse and reverse side, with themes of war and peace.<ref name="ahdesign"/> Hopkinson's first design had a shield with thirteen diagonal red and white stripes, supported on one side by figure bearing an olive branch and representing peace, and on the other an Indian warrior holding a bow and arrow, and holding a shiver. The crest was a radiant constellation of thirteen stars. The motto was "Bello vel pace paratus", meaning "prepared in war or in peace". The reverse, in Hopkinson's words, was "Liberty is seated in a chair holding an olive branch and her [[Liberty pole|staff]] is topped by a [[phrygian cap|Liberty cap]]. The motto `Virtute perennis' means `Everlasting because of virtue.' The date in Roman numerals is 1776."<ref name="ahdesign"/><ref name="gs2nd"/> {{double image|right| HopkinsonPrelimGreatSealDesignObverse.jpg|112|HopkinsonPrelimGreatSealDesignReverse.jpg|112| Hopkinson's first proposal}} In his second proposal, the Indian warrior was replaced by a soldier holding a sword, and the motto was shortened to "Bello vel paci", meaning "For war or for peace".<ref name="gs2nd"/> The committee chose the second version, and reported back to Congress on May 10, 1780, six weeks after being formed. Their final blazon, printed in Congress journals on May 17, was: "The Shield charged on the Field Azure with 13 diagonal stripes alternate rouge and argent. Supporters; dexter, a Warriour holding a Sword; sinister, a Figure representing Peace bearing an Olive Branch. The Crest; a radiant Constellation of 13 Stars. The motto, Bella vel Paci."<ref name="ahdesign"/> Once again, Congress did not find the result acceptable.<ref name="statepub"/> They referred the matter back to the committee, which did no further work on the matter.<ref name="ahdesign"/> As with the first design, several elements were eventually used in the final seal; the thirteen stripes on the shield with their colors, the constellation of stars surrounded by clouds, the olive branch, and the arrows (from Hopkinson's first proposal).<ref name="statepub"/> Hopkinson had previously used the constellation and clouds on a $40 [[Continental currency]] note he designed in 1778. The same note also used an Eye of Providence, taken from the first committee's design.<ref name="gsmoney"/> ===Third committee=== {{double image|right| BartonGreatSealDesignObverse.jpg|216|BartonGreatSealDesignReverse.jpg|178|Third committee's proposal, drawn by William Barton}} After two more years, Congress formed a third committee on May 4, 1782, this time consisting of [[John Rutledge]], [[Arthur Middleton]], and [[Elias Boudinot]]. [[Arthur Lee (diplomat)|Arthur Lee]] replaced Rutledge, although he was not officially appointed. As with the previous two committees, most of the work was delegated to a heraldic expert, this time 28-year-old [[William Barton (heraldist)|William Barton]].<ref name="statepub"/><ref name="gs3rd">{{cite web|url= http://www.greatseal.com/committees/thirdcomm/index.html|title= Third Great Seal Committee - May 1782|publisher=greatseal.com|first= John D.|last=MacArthur|accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref> Barton drew a design very quickly, using a rooster on the crest, but it was much too complex. No drawing of this design seems to have survived.<ref name="ahdesign"/><ref name="gs3rd"/> [[File:Continental $50 note 1778 pyramid.jpg|120px|thumb|left|Hopkinson's pyramid from 1778]] Barton then came up with another design, which the committee submitted back to Congress on May 9, 1782, just five days after being formed. This time, the figures on each side of the shield were the "Genius of the American Confederated Republic" represented by a maiden, and on the other side an American warrior. At the top is an eagle and on the pillar in the shield is a "Phoenix in Flames". The mottos were "In Vindiciam Libertatis" (In Defense of Liberty) and "Virtus sola invicta" (Only virtue unconquered).<ref name="gs3rd"/> For the reverse, Barton used a [[pyramid]] of thirteen [[step pyramid|steps]], with the radiant Eye of Providence overhead, and used the mottos "Deo Favente" (With God's Favor, or more literally, God Favoring) and "Perennis" (Everlasting).<ref name="gs3rd"/> The pyramid had come from another Continental currency note designed in 1778 by Hopkinson, this time the $50 note, which had a nearly identical pyramid and the motto "Perennis".<ref name="gs3rd"/> Barton had at first specified "on the Summit of it a Palm Tree, proper", with the explanation that "The Palm Tree, when burnt down to the very Root, naturally rises fairer than ever", but later crossed it out and replaced it with the Eye of Providence, taken from the first committee's design.<ref name="gs3rdblazon">{{cite web|url= http://www.greatseal.com/committees/thirdcomm/bartonblazon.html|title= Third Great Seal Committee Blazon|publisher=greatseal.com|first= John D.|last=MacArthur|accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref> Congress again took no action on the submitted design. ===Final design=== {{double image|right| GreatSealThomsonReportPage1.jpg|181| GreatSealThomsonReportPage2.jpg|180|Thomson's report to Congress, which was accepted and is still the law today.}} On June 13, 1782, the Congress turned to its Secretary [[Charles Thomson]], and provided all material submitted by the first three committees.<ref name="statepub"/> Thomson was 53 years old, and had been a Latin master at a Philadelphia academy.<ref name="gsfinal">{{cite web|url=http://www.greatseal.com/committees/finaldesign/index.html|title= The Final Design of the Great Seal â€“ June 20, 1782|publisher=greatseal.com|first= John D.|last=MacArthur|accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref> Thomson took elements from all three previous committees, coming up with a new design which provided the basis for the final seal.<ref name="statepub"/> Thomson used the eagle &ndash; this time specifying an American [[bald eagle]] &ndash; as the sole supporter on the shield. The shield had thirteen stripes, this time in a [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]] pattern, and the eagle's claws held an olive branch and a bundle of thirteen arrows. For the crest, he used Hopkinson's constellation of thirteen stars. The motto was ''E Pluribus Unum'', taken from the first committee, and was on a scroll held in the eagle's beak.<ref name="statepub"/><ref name="gsfinal"/> An eagle holding symbols of war and peace has a long history, and also echoed the second committee's themes. Franklin owned a 1702 emblem book, which included an eagle with olive branch and arrows near its talons, which may have been a source for Thomson.<ref name="ahsource"/> The arrows also mirror those in the arms of the [[Dutch Republic]], the only country in Europe with a representative government at the time, which depicted a lion holding seven arrows representing their seven provinces.<ref name="heraldica"/><ref name="ahsource"/> State currency may have provided further inspiration; a 1775 South Carolina bill showed a bundle of 13 arrows and a 1775 Maryland note depicted a hand with an olive branch of 13 leaves.<ref
