future they have spent a great deal of time pondering what is to come (a logical, if unproven, theory) or maybe its just because the host is an SF writer himself and finds it easiest to find guests within his own field. Also notable is the show's length. Striving for so much variety forces the program to a far greater length than most podcasts. Episodes have fluctuated from 68 minutes to 150 minutes. For many months the target length seemed to be 79 minutes. (Perhaps because 80 minutes is the most that can be burned to a 700 megabyte audio CD.) But many episodes of the first and second time period seem to gravitate to around two hours. All the old episodes have remained available for listening (which is typical of most podcasts). And like most podcasts, there is no charge for listening to one episode or for subscribing. '''Second Time Period: Monthly Episodes''' Beginning May 1, 2006, episodes were released once per month on the first of each month, but no change was made to the format or the content. '''Third Time Period: Weekly Episodes''' On January 1, 2008, episodes started being released weekly, becoming available one minute after midnight every Wednesday morning. The format also changed to feature an interview with only one guest per episode. Other changes seem to include: less news, a more streamlined opening, and promos for other podcasts were moved to after the closing credits. '''Other Historical Changes and Events:''' The December 1, 2006 episode had two major events. It was declared the show's One Year Anniversary Episode (the first episode was actually uploaded on December 15, 2005) and it was the beginning of the show's alliance with '''''[[Jim Baen's Universe]]''''' the online magazine of SF&F. This alliance brought ten minutes of new content to each episode. These ten minute segments were provided by the staff of '''''[[Jim Baen's Universe]]''''' and were produced by Walt Boyes (AKA: Bananaslug) and Stoney Compton. The June 1, 2006 episode was the first to use VoIP for recording all the phone interviews, and so was the first to provide professional quality sound. (The May 1, 2006 episode contained one VoIP interview, but all the rest were recorded over conventional analog phone lines.) October 1, 2006 saw another improvement in the show's audio quality. This was done by changing the mp3 file compression from 32 kbit/s (which had been used for all previous episodes) to 64 kbit/s. This better sound was good, but it was also bad in that it made the files twice as large, and take twice as long to download. ==Awards== The 2006 [[Parsec Awards|Parsec Award]] for "Best Speculative Fiction News Podcast" was given to the show's host, [[Stephen Euin Cobb]], on the evening of September 2, 2006, at the first annual Parsec Award ceremony in Atlanta, Georgia. In his acceptance speech, Stephen thanked the three podcasters who had encouraged him to create a podcast when he knew little about how podcasting was done: Mur Lafferty, Tee Morris, and Rich Sigfrit. Stephen also thanked his photographer and assistant, Peggy Gregory (who is also his sister) for helping him throughout his many promotional travels to science fiction conventions, book signings and TV appearances. == References == {{Reflist}} == External links == * [http://www.thefutureandyou.com/ ''The Future and You'' descriptive website] Includes program notes, links to sites mentioned within the show, a list of guests who have been on the show (with links to their sites and books), and access to the blog page from which episodes of the show may be downloaded. * [http://www.thefutureandyou.libsyn.com/ Page from which episodes of ''The Future and You'' may be downloaded] * [http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=110378990 The show's page at iTunes.] {{DEFAULTSORT:Future and You, The}} [[Category:Audio podcasts]] [[Category:Science podcasts]] [[Category:Science fiction podcasts]] [[Category:Singularitarianism]] [[Category:Artificial intelligence publications]] [[Category:Futurology]] [[Category:Nanotechnology]] [[Category:Sociology]] [[Category:Transhumanism]]</text> </page> <page> <id>37302</id> <title>The Game (treasure hunt)</title> <text>'''The Game''' is a non-stop 24â€“48 hour [[treasure hunt]], [[puzzlehunt]] or [[road rally]] that has run in the [[San Francisco Bay Area|San Francisco Bay]] and [[Seattle]] areas since 1973. Its teams use [[van]]s rigged with power and [[Internet]] access and drive hundreds of miles from puzzle site to puzzle site, overcoming often outrageous physical and mental challenges along the way, usually with no sleep. Teams in recent games have been required to walk around the roof of the [[Space Needle]], find a puzzle hidden in a live rat, and circulate a petition to ban [[dihydrogen monoxide hoax|dihydrogen monoxide]] from local ecosystems while dressed in superhero outfits. Game founder '''Joe Belfiore''' has described the Game as "the ultimate test for Renaissance men and women." ==History== The Game was created in [[Los Angeles]] in [[1973]] by a graphic designer named Donald Luskin and longtime friend, Patrick Carlyle. Teams competed all night long solving puzzles across L.A. for a $100 first prize. The game was a mostly underground affair, but eventually drew the attention of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.<ref>[http://family.puzzalot.com/v/puzevents/firstgames/ ''Los Angeles Times'' clippings from the first Games]</ref> and later the [[Walt Disney Company]], who produced a movie, ''[[Midnight Madness (film)|Midnight Madness]]'', based on Luskin's game.<ref>[http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Hills/1867/mmdirector.html&date=2009-10-25+08:05:23 "Fagabeefe: The Unofficial ''Midnight Madness'' Home Page / Director's Chair"] - notes from the ''[[Midnight Madness (film)|Midnight Madness]]'' directors</ref> In 1985 Joe Belfiore (at that time a student at [[Clearwater Central Catholic High School]]) and his friends, inspired by ''[[Midnight Madness (film)|Midnight Madness]]'', created a race like the one in the film. They played four more games before Joe moved to [[Stanford University]] to go to school. With Stanford classmates Eli Ben-Shoshan and Andrew Reisner, he created the Bay Area Race Fantastique ([[barf|BARF]]) which occurred six times before changing its name to 'The Game'. There are some interesting notes about the initial BARFs and number of teams that actually completed them due to the hyper-competitive aspect of the BARF format.<ref>http://www.gamecontrol.com/history/history2.htm</ref>{{Clarifyme|date=February 2009}} The term "Gentleman's Game" was used to describe the Stanford Game shortly after Joe Belfiore graduated, meaning there was no prize for winning, only bragging rights.
