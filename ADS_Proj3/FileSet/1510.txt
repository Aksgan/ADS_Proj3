the solutions are mutated and selected for those with higher fitness, until a satisfying solution has been found. Evolutionary optimization techniques are particularly useful in situations in which it is easy to determine the quality of a single solution, but hard to go through all possible solutions one by one (it is easy to determine the driving time for a particular route of the delivery truck, but it is almost impossible to check all possible routes once the number of destinations grows to more than a handful). The concept of a scalar valued fitness function ''f(s)'' also corresponds to the concept of a potential or [[energy function]] in [[physics]]. The two concepts only differ in that [[physicists]] traditionally think in terms of minimizing the potential function, while [[biologists]] prefer the notion that fitness is being maximized. Therefore, taking the inverse of a potential function turns it into a fitness function, and vice versa. [[Image:fitness-landscape-cartoon.png|frame|none|Figure 1: Sketch of a fitness landscape.

This is in contrast to [[random effects model]]s and [[mixed model]]s in which either all or some of the explanatory variables are treated as if they arise from the random causes. Often the same structure of model, which is usually a [[linear regression]] model, can be treated as any of the three types depending on the analyst's viewpoint, although there may be a natural choice in any given situation. In [[panel data]] analysis, the term '''fixed effects estimator''' (also known as the '''within estimator''') is used to refer to an [[estimator]] for the [[coefficient]]s in the regression model. If we assume fixed effects, we impose time independent effects for each entity that are possibly correlated with the regressors. == Qualitative description == Such models assist in controlling for unobserved [[heterogeneity]] when this heterogeneity is constant over time and correlated with independent variables. This constant can be removed from the data through differencing, for example by taking a first difference which will remove any time invariant components of the model. There are two common assumptions made about the individual specific effect, the random effects assumption and the fixed effects assumption. The random effects assumption (made in a [[random effects model]]) is that the individual specific effects are uncorrelated with the independent variables. The fixed effect assumption is that the individual specific effect is correlated with the independent variables. If the random effects assumption holds, the random effects model is more [[Efficiency (statistics)|efficient]] than the fixed effects model. However, if this assumption does not hold (i.e., if the
