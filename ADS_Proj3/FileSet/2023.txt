The network is a simple layer that applications can use to anonymously and securely send messages to each other. Possible uses include anonymous surfing, chatting, blogging and file transfers. The application itself is called an ''I2P router'' and a computer running I2P is called an ''I2P node'' - whereas those, too, are often referred to as ''routers''. ==Technical design== I2P is [[Development stage#Beta|beta]] software. Developers emphasize that there are likely to be bugs in the software and that there has been insufficient [[peer review]] to date. However, they believe the code is now reasonably stable and well-developed, and more exposure can help development of I2P. The network itself is strictly message-based (like [[Internet Protocol|IP]]), but there is a library available to allow reliable streaming communication on top of it (similar to [[Transmission control protocol|TCP]], although from version 0.6 there is a new [[User datagram protocol|UDP]]-based SSU transport). All communication is end-to-end [[encryption|encrypted]] (in total there are four layers of encryption used when sending a message), and even the end points ("destinations") are cryptographic identifiers (essentially a pair of [[public key]]s), so that neither sender nor recipient of a message need to reveal their [[IP address]] to the other side or to third-party observers. Although many of the developers had been a part of the [[Invisible IRC Project|IIP]] and [[Freenet]] communities, there are significant differences between their designs and concepts. IIP was an anonymous centralized [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] server. Freenet is a [[censorship]]-resistant [[distributed data store]]. I2P is an [[Anonymous P2P|anonymous peer-to-peer]] distributed communication layer designed to run ''any'' traditional internet service (e.g. [[Usenet]], [[E-mail]], [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], [[file sharing]], [[Web hosting]] and [[HTTP]], [[Telnet]]), as well as more traditional distributed applications (e.g. a distributed data store, a web proxy network using [[Squid (software)]], and [[Domain Name System|DNS]]). Many developers of I2P are known only under [[Pseudonymity|pseudonyms]]. While the previous main developer, ''[[J. Random Hacker|jrandom]]'', is currently on hiatus, others, such as zzz and Complication have continued to lead development efforts, and are assisted by numerous contributors.<ref>[http://www.i2p2.de/statnotes0108 Status Update 01 2008]</ref> ==I2P software tools== [[File:I2P router console 0.7.7.png|I2P router console|thumb]] Since I2P is an anonymous [[network layer]], it is designed so ''other'' software can use it for anonymous communication. As such there are a variety of tools currently available for I2P or in development. The I2P router is controlled through the router console which is a web frontend accessed through a web browser. ===I2PTunnel=== I2PTunnel is an application embedded into I2P that allows arbitrary TCP/IP applications to communicate over I2P by setting up "[[Tunneling protocol|tunnels]]" which can be accessed by connecting to pre-determined ports on [[localhost]]. ===SAM=== SAM is a protocol which allows a client application written in any language to communicate over I2P, by using a socket-based interface to the I2P router.<ref>[http://www.i2p2.de/sam SAM - I2P<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> ===BitTorrent=== Several programs provide [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] functionality for use within the I2P network. Each relies on the user being able to access the I2P network with a [[web browser]] to download the .torrent files. Users cannot connect to non-I2P torrents or peers from within I2P, nor can they connect to I2P torrents or peers from outside I2P.<ref>[http://forum.i2p2.de/viewtopic.php?t=2068 I2P Bittorrent FAQ]</ref> ''I2PSnark'', included in the I2P install package, is a port of the BitTorrent client named Snark.<ref>[http://www.klomp.org/snark/ The Hunting of the Snark Project - BitTorrent Application Suite<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> ''[[Vuze]]'', formerly known as Azureus, is a [[BitTorrent client]] that includes a plugin for I2P, allowing anonymous swarming through this network.<ref>[http://azureus.sourceforge.net/plugin_details.php?plugin=azneti2p Azureus : Plugin Details for I2P Network Plugin<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>A tutorial exists for setting it up at http://azureus.sourceforge.net/doc/AnonBT/i2p/I2P_howto.htm</ref> This plugin is still in an early stage of development, however it is already fairly stable. ''I2P-BT'' is a [[BitTorrent client]] for I2P that allows anonymous [[Swarm (disambiguation)|swarming]] for [[file sharing]]. This client is a modified version of the original BitTorrent 3.4.2 program which runs on Windows and most dialects of [[Unix]] in a GUI and command-line environment. It was developed by the individual known as 'duck' on I2P in cooperation with 'smeghead'. It is no longer being actively developed; however, there is a small effort to upgrade the I2P-BT client up to par with the BitTorrent 4.0 release. ''I2PRufus'' is an I2P port of the Rufus BitTorrent client.<ref>[http://rufus.sourceforge.net/ Rufus - BitTorrent Client : Home<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [http://sponge.i2p/files/ Robert] is the most actively maintened I2PRufus fork. (i2p-internal link) And there is "I2P-Transmission". ===eDonkey iMule=== [[File:IMule.png|iMule|thumb]] [[iMule]] (''invisible Mule'') <ref>[http://aceini.no-ip.info/imule iMule download]</ref> is a port of the 'All-Platform' client [[aMule]] for I2P network. iMule is made for anonymous [[file sharing]]. In contrast to other [[eDonkey network|eDonkey]] clients, iMule only uses the [[Kademlia]] proceeding to connect trough I2P network, so no servers are needed. ===Gnutella I2Phex ===<!-- This section is linked from [[File sharing]] --> [[I2Phex]] is a port of the popular [[Gnutella]] client [[Phex]] to I2P. It is stable and fairly functional. ===Susimail=== I2P has a free pseudonymous e-mail service run by an individual called 'Postman'. The mail transfer servers are ''pop.mail.i2p'' ([[Post Office Protocol|POP3]]) and ''smtp.mail.i2p'' ([[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]]). ''Susimail'' was created to address privacy concerns in using these servers directly using traditional email clients, such as leaking the
