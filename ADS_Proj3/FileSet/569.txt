activities, news anchorman [[Patrick Poivre d'Arvor]] announced that the CNIL had registered 125,000 files <ref name=History/>. By the end of 1980, Poivre d'Arvor counted 250,000 files (public and private) <ref name=History/>. ==Composition and independence== The CNIL is composed of seventeen members from various government entities, four of whom are members of the parliament (''Assemblée nationale'' and ''Sénat''). Twelve of these members are elected by their representative organisations in the CNIL. The CNIL's administrative authority status gives it total independence to select the actions that it will undertake. However, its power is limited and defined by law. The CNIL is financed by the budget of the French Republic. {| class="wikitable" |- !width="50%" align="center"|'''Presidents of the CNIL''' !width="25%" align="center"|'''Began''' !width="25%" align="center"|'''Ended''' |- |width="50%" align="center"| [[Pierre Bellet]] |width="25%" align="center"| December 5, 1978 |width="25%" align="center"| November 27, 1979 |- |width="50%" align="center"| [[Jacques Thyraud]] |width="25%" align="center"| 1979 |width="25%" align="center"| 1983 |- |width="50%" align="center"| [[Jean Rosenwald]] |width="25%" align="center"| 1983 |width="25%" align="center"| June 1984 |- |width="50%" align="center"| [[Jacques Fauvet]] |width="25%" align="center"| June 14, 1984 |width="25%" align="center"| 1999 |- |width="50%" align="center"| [[Michel Gentot]] |width="25%" align="center"| February 3, 1999 |width="25%" align="center"| January 7, 2004 |- |width="50%" align="center"| [[Alex Türk]] |width="25%" align="center"| February 3, 2004 |width="25%" align="center"| |- |} ==Power== The CNIL registers the setup of information systems that process personal data on French territories. By September 2004, more than 800,000 declarations of such systems had been made. Additionally, CNIL checks the law to be applied in this domain as well as in about 50 annual 'control missions'. CNIL can warn organisations or people who are found to be noncompliant with the law, and also report them to the [[Parquet (legal)|Parquet]]. * 300 nominal information systems registered daily. * 8000 phone calls handled each month. * 4000 ''plaintes'' or requests for information received each year. ==Regulation== The main principles for regulation of personal data processing are as follows (list not all-inclusive): * all illegal means of data collection are forbidden; * the aim of the data files must be explicitly stated; * people registered in files must be informed of their rights, for example, for rectification and deletion of data on demand; * finally, no decision about an individual can be decided by a computer. The archival of ''sensitive'' information can result in a 5 year prison term and a €300,000 fine. ==European and International Contexts== [[Germany]] in 1971, [[Sweden]] in 1973, and France in 1978 were the first three States to vote for a "Computers and Liberty" law; these work with an independent control authority. International, economic, and political structures have been created or assigned to apply CNIL directives. Amongst these are the [[Organisation pour la coopération et le développement économique]] (OCDE/[[EDCO]]) in 1980, the [[Council of Europe]] in 1981 and the [[United Nations]] (ONU) ([[UN|UNO]]) in 1990. In 1995, the [[European Commission]] voted through a directive in this manner. As of 2004, 25 countries have applied this directive. == Criticisms == The CNIL is the target of various criticisms, alleging its lack of seriousness and tendency to support governmental legislation, forgetting its original aims of protecting data privacy and citizens' rights <ref name=History>Chloé Leprince, [http://www.rue89.com/2008/01/06/cnil-trente-ans-contre-la-tyrannie-de-lordinateur Cnil: trente ans contre la "tyrannie de l'ordinateur"], ''[[Rue 89]]'', 6 January 2008 {{fr icon}}</ref>.

The model uses a basic [[Regression analysis|regression]] formula, with parameters that are derived from historical project data and current project characteristics. COCOMO was first published in 1981 [[Barry Boehm|Barry W. Boehm's]] Book ''Software engineering economics''<ref name="cocomo1">[[Barry Boehm]]. ''[[Software engineering economics (book)|Software engineering economics]]''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ:Prentice-Hall, 1981. ISBN 0-13-822122-7</ref> as a model for estimating effort, cost, and schedule for software projects. It drew on a study of 63 projects at [[TRW]] Aerospace where [[Barry Boehm]] was Director of Software Research and Technology in 1981. The study examined projects ranging in size from 2,000 to 100,000 [[lines of code]], and programming languages ranging from [[assembly language|assembly]] to [[PL/I]]. These projects were based on the [[waterfall model]] of software development which was the prevalent software development process in 1981. References to this model typically call it ''COCOMO 81''. In 1997 ''COCOMO II'' was developed and finally published in 2000 in the book ''Software Cost Estimation with COCOMO II''.<ref name="cocomo2">[[Barry Boehm]], Chris Abts, A. Winsor Brown, Sunita Chulani, Bradford K. Clark, Ellis Horowitz, Ray Madachy, Donald J. Reifer, and Bert Steece''[[Software cost estimation with COCOMO II (book)|Software cost estimation with COCOMO II]]'' (with CD-ROM). Englewood Cliffs, NJ:Prentice-Hall, 2000. ISBN 0-13-026692-2</ref> COCOMO II is the successor of COCOMO 81 and is better suited for estimating modern software development projects. It provides more support for modern [[software development process]]es and an updated project database. The need for the new model came as software development technology moved from mainframe and overnight batch processing to desktop development, code reusability and the use of off-the-shelf software components. This article refers to ''COCOMO 81''. COCOMO consists of a hierarchy of three increasingly detailed and accurate forms. The first level, ''Basic COCOMO'' is good for quick, early, rough order of magnitude estimates of software costs, but its accuracy is limited due to its lack of factors to account for difference in project attributes (''Cost Drivers''). ''Intermediate COCOMO'' takes these Cost Drivers into account and ''Detailed COCOMO'' additionally accounts for the influence of individual project phases. == Basic COCOMO == '''Basic COCOMO''' computes software development effort
