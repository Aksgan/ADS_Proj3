This includes the types and numbers of wires required along with the strength and frequency of the signal. It also includes the physical design of the plugs and sockets. An interface may define a connector that is used only by that interface (e.g., [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]]) or may define a connector that is also used by another interface; for example, [[RCA Jack|RCA]] connectors are defined both by the [[composite video]] and [[component video]] interfaces. == Interfaces and their connectors == {| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" |- ! colspan="3" style="background:#cdf" | Interface ! rowspan="2" style="background:#cfe" | Connectors |- ! style="background:#def" | Audio or Video ! style="background:#def" | Digital or Analog ! style="background:#def" | Description |- | rowspan="2"| '''Audio Only''' |'''Analog''' |[[PC System Design Guide]].

PC 99 introduced a color code for the various standard types of plugs and connectors used on PCs. The color code for audio plugs follow<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/archive/pcguides.mspx PC 99 System Design Guide], Intel Corporation and Microsoft Corporation, 14 July 1999.

Note that there are no differences in the signals transmitted over optical or coaxial [[S/PDIF]] connectors—both carry exactly the same information. Selection of one over the other rests mainly on the availability of appropriate connectors on the chosen equipment and the preference and convenience of the user. Connections longer than 6 meters or so, or those requiring tight bends, should use coaxial cable, since the high light signal attenuation of [[TOSLINK]] cables limits its effective range. == Connectors == === Audio Connectors === ==== TRS ==== [[Image:Photo-audiojacks.jpg|thumb|left|150px|2.5 mm (3/32") mono (TS), 3.5 mm (1/8") mono and stereo (TRS), and 6.3 mm (1/4") stereo (TRS) jack plugs]] A [[Tip ring sleeve|TRS]] connector (tip, ring, sleeve) also called an audio jack, phone plug, jack plug, stereo plug, mini-jack, or mini-stereo. Note: In the USA, the connectors illustrated are never called "jacks", but in other languages and countries they might well be, apparently using "jack" as a short form of "jack plug". The sockets that these plugs mate with are called "jacks" in the USA. For special applications, plugs with two ring contacts have been made in both 3.5 mm and 6.3 mm sizes. <div style="clear:both"></div> ==== DIN ==== [[Image:5pin180dinplug.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Five-pin male 180° DIN connector]] A [[DIN connector]] is a connector that was originally standardized by the Deutsches Institut für Normung (DIN). <div style="clear:both"></div> ==== BNC ==== [[Image:BNC connector.jpg|thumb|left|Male 50 ohm BNC connector]] The [[BNC connector|BNC]] (Bayonet Neill Concelman) connector is a very common type of RF connector used for terminating coaxial cable. <div style="clear:both"></div> ==== TOSLINK ==== [[Image:TOS LINK clear cable.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Clear TOSLINK cable with a round connector]] [[TOSLINK]] or Optical Cable is a standardized optical fiber connection system. <div style="clear:both"></div> ==== XLR ==== [[Image:Xlr-connectors.jpg|thumb|left|XLR3 cable connectors, female on left and male on right]] The [[XLR connector]] is an electrical connector design.

[[Mini-DIN connector|Mini-DIN]] is similar to the larger, older [[DIN connector]]. Both are standards of the Deutsches Institut für Normung, the German standards body. <div style="clear:both"></div> ==== D-subminiature ==== [[Image:DSubminiatures.svg|thumb|left|150px|DA, DB, DC, DD, and DE sized connectors]] [[D-subminiature]] or D-sub is a common type of electrical connector used particularly in computers.
