The spoken form of logorrhoea (other than in [[Logorrhea (psychology)|the medical sense]]) is a kind of [[wiktionary:verbosity|verbosity]] which uses superfluous (or fancy) words to disguise an otherwise useless message as useful or intellectual. Logorrhoea is also known as "verbal [[diarrhea]]" and the utterer is colloquially called a "[[motor mouth]]". Some partial and complete [[synonyms]] include "bloviation", "[[prolixity]]", "tumidity", and "[[wordiness]]". == Logorrhoea as a description of rhetoric == The word ''logorrhoea'' is often used [[pejorative]]ly to describe prose which is highly [[figurative language|abstract]], and, consequently, contains little [[Literal and figurative language|concrete language]]. Since abstract writing is hard to visualize, it often seems as though it makes no sense, and that all the words are excessive. Writers in academic fields which concern themselves mostly with the abstract, such as [[philosophy]], especially [[postmodernism]], often fail to include extensive concrete examples of their ideas; so an examination of their work might lead one to believe that it is all [[nonsense]], hence the pejorative epithet "pomobabble" (a [[portmanteau]] of ''postmodernist [[Babbling|babble]]''). In an attempt to prove this lack of academic rigor, physics professor [[Alan Sokal]] wrote a nonsensical essay, and had it published in a respected journal (''[[Social Text]]'') as a [[practical joke]]. The journal kept defending it as a genuine article even after its own author rebuked the editors publicly in a subsequent article in another academic journal. The episode has come to be known as the [[Sokal Affair]].<ref name="Sokal">[http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/ The Sokal Affair]</ref>{{Clarify|date=June 2010|reason=<nowiki>This is not a proper reference citation.

Several computer programs have been made that can generate texts resembling the styles of these fields but which are actually nonsensical. Some examples include: * [[SCIgen]] (which randomly generates fake research papers), "[[Mark V. Shaney]]" (which uses a [[Markov chain]] method to generate nonsense based on another text), [[Dissociated Press]] (which transforms any text into potentially humorous garbage), the [http://www.elsewhere.org/cgi-bin/postmodern/ Postmodernism Generator] (which writes meaningless but superficially convincing essays in pomobabble), and the [http://www.pakin.org/complaint/ Automatic Complaint-letter Generator] (which creates realistic but tumid rants). Logorrhoea can also be used as a form of [[euphemism]] and [[obfuscation]], to disguise unpleasant facts and ideas and mislead others about them. The term is also sometimes less precisely applied to unnecessarily (and often redundantly) wordy speech in general; this is more usually referred to as [[prolixity]]. Some people defend the use of additional words which sometimes look unnecessary as [[idiom]]atic, a matter of artistic preference, or helpful in explaining complex ideas or messages. == Examples of logorrhoea == In his [[essay]] "[[Politics and the English Language]]" (1946), the [[England|English]] writer [[George Orwell]] wrote about logorrhoea in politics. He took the following verse (9:11) from the book of [[Ecclesiastes]] in the [[Bible]]: <blockquote>"I returned and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all."</blockquote> He rewrote it like this: <blockquote>"Objective considerations of contemporary phenomena compel the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account."</blockquote> Orwell’s deliberate usage of unnecessary words only serves to further complicate the statement. For instance, the words "objective", "contemporary" and "invariably" could be cut, with virtually no loss of meaning. What both the Bible and Orwell were trying to say could be paraphrased (albeit obtusely) in three simple words: "Success is [[stochastic]]". In the chapter "Is Electricity Fire?" of his anecdote collection ''[[Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!|Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!]]'', the physicist and storyteller [[Richard Feynman]] describes a time when he participated in a multi-disciplinary conference discussing the [[wikt:nebulous|nebulous]] topic "the ethics of equality". Feynman was at first apprehensive, having read none of the books which the conference organizers had recommended. A [[sociology|sociologist]] brought a paper which he had written beforehand to the committee where Feynman served, asking everyone to read it. Feynman found it completely incomprehensible, and feared that he was out of his depth — until he decided to pick one sentence at random and [[parsing|parse]] it until he understood. The sentence he chose (to the best of his recollection) was: :''The individual member of the social community often receives his information via visual, symbolic channels''. Feynman "translated" the sentence and discovered it meant "People read". The rest of the paper soon made sense in the same fashion. Further examples are easy to create: :''The medical community indicates that a program of downsizing average total daily caloric intake is maximally efficacious in the field of proactive weight-reduction methodologies''. :([[Id est|I.e.]], "Doctors say that the best way to lose weight is to eat less".) == The benefits of being concise == While some authors may feel that using long and obscure words gives them the appearance of greater intelligence, a recent study from the [[Psychology]] department of [[Princeton University]] found that this was not the case. Dr. Daniel M. Oppenheimer conducted a series of five experiments which found that when shown samples of writing with varying word length, undergraduate students rated those with
