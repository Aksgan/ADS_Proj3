two methods of reporting sizes had serious financial consequences for at least one hard drive manufacturer when a [[class action suit]] argued the different methods effectively misled consumers.<ref>http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,201269,00.html Western Digital Settles Hard-Drive Capacity Lawsuit, Associated Press June 28, 2006 retrieved 2010 Nov 25</ref> Semiconductor memory chips are organized so that memory sizes are expressed in multiples of powers of two. Hard disks by contrast have no inherent binary size. Capacity is the product of the number of heads, number of tracks, number of sectors per track, and the size of each sector. Sector sizes are standardized for convenience at 256 or 512 and more recently 4096 bytes, which are powers of two. This can cause some confusion because operating systems may report the formatted capacity of a hard drive using [[binary prefix]] units which increment by powers of 1024. For example, [[Microsoft Windows]] reports disk capacity both in a decimal [[integer]] to 12 or more digits and in binary prefix units to three significant digits. A one terabyte (1 TB) disk drive would be expected to hold around 1 trillion bytes (1,000,000,000,000) or 1000 GB; and indeed most 1 TB hard drives will contain slightly more than this number. However some operating system utilities would report this as around 931 GB or 953,674 MB. (The actual number for a formatted capacity will be somewhat smaller still, [[comparison of file systems|depending on the file system]].) Following are the several ways of reporting one Terabyte. {| class="wikitable" |- ! [[SI prefix]]es (hard drive) ! equivalent ! [[Binary prefixes]] (OS) ! equivalent |- | 1 TB ([[Terabyte]]) | 1 * 1000<sup>4</sup> B | 0.9095 TiB (Tebibyte) | 0.9095 * 1024<sup>4</sup> B |- | 1000 GB ([[Gigabyte]]) | 1000 * 1000<sup>3</sup> B | 931.3 GiB (Gibibyte) | 931.3 * 1024<sup>3</sup> B |- | 1,000,000 MB ([[Megabyte]]) | 1,000,000 * 1000<sup>2</sup> B | 953,674.3 MiB (Mebibyte) | 953,674.3 * 1024<sup>2</sup> B |- | 1,000,000,000 KB ([[Kilobyte]]) | 1,000,000,000 * 1000 B | 976,562,500 KiB (Kibibyte) | 976,562,500 * 1024 B |- | 1,000,000,000,000 B ([[byte]]) | - | 1,000,000,000,000 B (byte) | - |} ===Addressing data on large drives=== The capacity of an HDD can be calculated by multiplying the number of [[Cylinder (disk drive)|cylinders]] by the number of heads by the number of [[Disk sector|sectors]] by the number of bytes/sector (most commonly 512). Drives with the [[AT Attachment|ATA]] interface and a capacity of eight gigabytes or more behave as if they were structured into 16383 cylinders, 16 heads, and 63 sectors, for compatibility with older operating systems. Unlike in the 1980s, the [[Cylinder-head-sector|cylinder, head, sector]] (C/H/S) counts reported to the CPU by a modern ATA drive are no longer actual physical parameters since the reported numbers are constrained by historic operating-system interfaces and with [[zone bit recording]] the actual number of sectors varies by zone. Disks with [[SCSI]] interface address each sector with a unique integer number; the operating system remains ignorant of their head or cylinder count. The old C/H/S scheme has been replaced by [[logical block addressing]]. In some cases, to try to "force-fit" the C/H/S scheme to large-capacity drives, the number of heads was given as 64, although no modern drive has anywhere near 32 platters. Not all the space on a hard drive is available for user files. The operating system [[file system]] uses some of the disk space to organize files on the disk, recording their file names and the sequence of disk areas that represent the file. Examples of data structures stored on disk to retrieve files include the [[MS DOS]] [[file allocation table]] (FAT), and [[UNIX]] [[inodes]], as well as other operating system data structures. This file system overhead is usually less than 1% on drives larger than 100 MB. For [[RAID]] drives, data integrity and fault-tolerance requirements also reduce the realized capacity. For example, a RAID1 drive will be about half the total capacity as a result of data mirroring. For RAID5 drives with x drives you would lose 1/x of your space to parity. RAID drives are multiple drives that appear to be one drive to the user, but provides some fault-tolerance. A general rule of thumb to quickly convert the manufacturer's hard disk capacity to the standard [[Microsoft Windows]] formatted capacity is 0.93*capacity of HDD from manufacturer for HDDs less than a terabyte and 0.91*capacity of HDD from manufacturer for HDDs equal to or greater than 1 terabyte. === HDD Formatting === {{Main|Disk formatting}} The presentation of an HDD to its host is determined by its [[disk controller|controller]]. This may differ substantially from the drive's native [[interface]] particularly in [[mainframe computer|mainframes]] or [[server computer|servers]]. Modern HDDs, such as SAS<ref>{{epigraph | quote = The LBAs on a logical unit shall begin with zero and shall be contiguous up to the last logical block on the logical unit. | cite = Information technology - Serial Attached SCSI - 2 (SAS-2), INCITS 457 Draft 2, May 8, 2009, chapter 4.1 Direct-access block device type model overview }}</ref> and SATA<ref>ISO/IEC 791D:1994, AT Attachment Interface for Disk Drives (ATA-1), section 7.1.2</ref> drives, appear at their interfaces as a contiguous set of logical blocks; typically 512 bytes long but the industry is in the process of changing to 4,096 byte logical blocks; see [[Advanced Format]].<ref>[http://www.anandtech.com/show/2888 Western Digital's Advanced Format: The 4K Sector Transition Begins]</ref> The process of initializing these logical blocks on the physical disk platters is called ''low level formatting'' which is usually performed at the factory and is not normally changed in the field.<ref>See: [http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/geom/formatLow-c.html Low-Level Formatting].
