attack''' is a type of attack related to [[Man-in-the-middle attack|man-in-the-middle]] and [[Replay attack|replay]] attacks, in which an attacker relays verbatim a message from the sender to a valid receiver of the message. The sender may or may not be aware of even sending the message to the attacker; if the sender is aware, it is likely under the impression that the attacker is the intended receiver of the message. Relay attacks are forecast to get more and more common with the increasing number of contactless (RLC and [[Radio frequency]]) devices.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} ==Example attack== A typical relay attack is when a [[Hacker (computing)|hacker]] follows a car owner with a relay that forwards the frequency of the alarm's remote control to the car, waiting for the car owner to accidentally press the open button during his jogging, if pressing a button is necessary (for security reasons, it should be necessary, but for convenience of the owner and the hacker, it is often not necessary). ==External links== *[http://www.rfidblog.org.uk/research.html#relay2009 Academic Survey on Relay Attacks] *[http://www.rfidblog.org.uk/research.html#relay Detailed Practical Example of Relay Attack on RFID system] *[http://www.libnfc.org/documentation/examples/relay Relay Attack Demonstration] [[Category:Hacking (computer security)]] [[Category:Computer security exploits]]</text> </page> <page> <id>31750</id> <title>Relevance vector machine</title> <text>'''Relevance vector machine (RVM)''' is a [[machine learning]] technique that uses [[Bayesian inference]] to obtain [[Parsimony|parsimonious]] solutions for [[Regression analysis|regression]] and [[Statistical classification|classification]]. The RVM has an identical functional form to the [[support vector machine]], but provides probabilistic classification. It is actually equivalent to a [[Gaussian process]] model with [[covariance function]]: :<math>k(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x'}) = \sum_{j=1}^N \frac{1}{\alpha_j} \phi(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}_j)\phi(\mathbf{x}',\mathbf{x}_j) </math> where φ is the [[kernel function]] (usually Gaussian), and '''x'''<sub>1</sub>,…,'''x'''<sub>''N''</sub> are the input vectors of the [[training set]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Compared to the SVM, the Bayesian formulation avoids the set of free parameters of the SVM (that usually require cross-validation-based post-optimizations). However RVMs use an [[Expectation Maximization]] (EM)-like learning method and are therefore at risk of local minima, unlike the standard [[Sequential Minimal Optimization|SMO]]-based algorithms employed by [[Support vector machine|SVM]]s which are guaranteed to find a global optimum.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} == References == * {{cite journal | last=Tipping | first=Michael E. | last2=Smola | first2=Alex |title=Sparse Bayesian Learning and the Relevance Vector Machine |year=2001 |journal = [[Journal of Machine Learning Research]] |volume=1 |pages=211&ndash;244 |url=http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/v1/tipping01a.html | doi=10.1162/15324430152748236 }} == Software == * [http://dlib.net dlib C++ Library] * [http://www.terborg.net/research/kml/ The Kernel-Machine Library] ==External links== *[http://www.relevancevector.com Tipping's webpage on Sparse Bayesian Models and the RVM] *[http://www.tristanfletcher.co.uk/RVM%20Explained.pdf A Tutorial on RVM by Tristan Fletcher] [[Category:Classification algorithms]] [[Category:Ensemble learning]] [[Category:Machine learning]] [[Category:Non-parametric Bayesian methods]] [[zh:相关向量机]]</text> </page> <page> <id>31770</id> <title>Remorse ASCII</title> <text>{{Infobox computer underground | group_name = Remorse ASCII | image = | caption = | origin = | country = [[United States]] | status = active | years_active = 1994&ndash;1995<br />1996&ndash;present | category = [[artscene]] | founders = Necromancer<br />Necronite | products = | affiliates = [[ACiD Productions]] | website = http://www.remorse.org | }} '''Remorse ASCII''', or ''Remorse 1981'', is the official ASCII sub-label of [[ACiD Productions]]. ==History== Remorse was established in late 1994 by two [[IBM PC|IBM-PC]] scene [[ASCII art]]ists from [[San Jose, California|San José]], [[California]] who went by the [[pseudonym]]s Necromancer and Necronite. After releasing five (5) artpacks between 1994-1995, Remorse temporarily disbanded. Prominent members each went their separate ways; some created their own groups (such as Trank) and another joined ANSI Creators in Demand to assist with their ASCII division. In 1996, it was decided by the leaders of Trank, ACiD proper, and the newly formed ACiD ASCII division (not yet named Remorse) that they should consolidate (and in some ways reunite) as a single group. Like [[pHluid]], the music sublabel of ACiD, the leaders of these three organizations merged together under the new name of ''Remorse/ACiD ASCII'', and became an official extension of ACiD Productions. This is the Remorse which continues to exist to this day (1996-present). ===Present day=== Remorse continues to release ASCII in the same traditional artpack format that it started with. These packs are now distributed via the internet on IRC and FTP servers; decorating FTP sites, telnet BBSes, [[NFO]] files or art for the sake of art. == Member List == As of May 2005, the active member list of Remorse included the following people: === Founders === * Necromancer * Necronite === Leaders === * [[RaD Man]] === Senior staff === * Haliphax * Nightrain === Active artists === AnsiChrist, Binear Walker, Bornholme, Cmang (Computer Man), Cubon, Joplex, Pesho (Silas), Polygon Breasts, Raster Burn, and Yce. === Mascot === M0lo === Alumni === Arrogance, Axel Barebones ([http://www.iaxb.com AXB]), Bad Sector,(aka -bd-) Barium, Black Jack, bLACKDAWn (aka ForgE),Cannibal (Cannabis), cD_, cRu, Cypher Hex, Enigmatic, Empty, Erupt, Ewheat, Fahrenheit, Firestorm, F0st, Hiro Protagonist (Devin), Creature Of Hell, J. Hale (Asphixia), Kaleidas (Acid Jack), Kayozz, Killa Hertz, Kxmode, Kyr, Megga Hertz, Miasma, Mister Kite, Mister Self Destruct, Mjolnir, Ogre, Omicron, Palmore, phaser-X, Pix, [http://sixteencolors.net/artist/polymorph/index.html Polymorph], phz, Poskgubbe, Rek, Talo, Terminator 2, The Messiah, The Upright Man (TUM), [http://kostecki.net tinyz], Tzeentch, Whodini, Windrider, and Zooyork. ==Trivia== * It is worth noting that at the time Remorse was founded, ASCII art itself within the IBM-PC underground [[computer art scene]] was not taken seriously within the ANSI art community. Against these odds Remorse rose to the challenge and established itself as what is now the longest operating organization of ASCII artists in history. * Remorse, which also goes by "Remorse 1981", makes heavy use of [[Code page 437]], a superset of ASCII commonly referred to as "[[extended ASCII]]". This eight-bit system was introduced by the IBM Corporation in 1981 for use with its first model of personal computer. * The 21st Remorse ASCII pack (<tt>RMRS-21.ZIP</tt>) does not exist on any artpacks archives. When the Remorse group was first revived the leaders decided to release under the file name <tt>RMRS-21.ZIP</tt>; twenty-one was said to be the combined sum of all packs from Trank, Remorse-prior, and ACiD ASCII ("ASCiiD"). Soon after this file was pulled and renamed to <tt>RMRS-06.ZIP</tt>, perhaps due to public outcry. When the new Remorse had completed its 20th pack, the 21st was skipped over to avoid
