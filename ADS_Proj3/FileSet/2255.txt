the long term, by ensuring that success is appropriately recognized in both the formal and informal reward systems of the organization. To say that they have a key role to play is an understatement. Finance is connected to most, if not all, of the key business processes within the organization. It should be steering the stewardship and accountability systems that ensure that the organization is conducting its business in an appropriate, ethical manner. It is critical that these foundations are firmly laid. So often they are the litmus test by which public confidence in the institution is either won or lost. Finance should also be providing the information, analysis and advice to enable the organizations’ service managers to operate effectively. This goes beyond the traditional preoccupation with budgets – how much have we spent so far, how much do we have left to spend? It is about helping the organization to better understand its own performance. That means making the connections and understanding the relationships between given inputs – the resources brought to bear – and the outputs and outcomes that they achieve. It is also about understanding and actively managing risks within the organization and its activities. ===FIFO vs. LIFO accounting=== {{main|FIFO and LIFO accounting}} When a merchant buys goods from inventory, the value of the inventory account is reduced by the [[cost of goods sold]] (COGS). This is simple where the CoG has not varied across those held in stock; but where it has, then an agreed method must be derived to evaluate it. For [[commodity]] items that one cannot track individually, accountants must choose a method that fits the nature of the sale. Two popular methods that normally exist are: [[FIFO and LIFO accounting]] (first in - first out, last in - first out). FIFO regards the first unit that arrived in inventory as the first one sold. LIFO considers the last unit arriving in inventory as the first one sold. Which method an accountant selects can have a significant effect on net income and [[book value]] and, in turn, on taxation. Using LIFO accounting for inventory, a company generally reports lower net income and lower book value, due to the effects of inflation. This generally results in lower taxation. Due to LIFO's potential to skew inventory value, [[UK GAAP]] and [[International Accounting Standards|IAS]] have effectively banned LIFO inventory accounting. ===Standard cost accounting=== Standard cost accounting uses [[ratio]]s called [[Efficiency (economics)|efficiencies]] that compare the labour and materials actually used to produce a good with those that the same goods would have required under "standard" conditions. As long as similar actual and standard conditions obtain, few problems arise. Unfortunately, standard cost accounting methods developed about 100 years ago, when labor comprised the most important cost in manufactured goods. Standard methods continue to emphasize labor efficiency even though that resource now constitutes a (very) small part of cost in most cases. Standard cost accounting can hurt managers, workers, and firms in several ways. For example, a policy decision to increase inventory can harm a manufacturing manager's [[performance evaluation]]. Increasing inventory requires increased production, which means that processes must operate at higher rates. When (not if) something goes wrong, the process takes longer and uses more than the standard labor time. The manager appears responsible for the excess, even though s/he has no control over the production requirement or the problem. In adverse economic times, firms use the same efficiencies to downsize, rightsize, or otherwise reduce their labor force. Workers laid off under those circumstances have even less control over excess inventory and cost efficiencies than their managers. Many financial and cost accountants have agreed for many years on the desirability of replacing standard cost accounting. They have not, however, found a successor. ===Theory of constraints cost accounting=== [[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]] developed the [[Theory of Constraints]] in part to address the cost-accounting problems in what he calls the "cost world." He offers a substitute, called [[throughput accounting]], that uses [[Throughput (business)|throughput]] (money for goods sold to customers) in place of output (goods produced that may sell or may boost inventory) and considers labor as a fixed rather than as a variable cost. He defines inventory simply as everything the organization owns that it plans to sell, including buildings, machinery, and many other things in addition to the categories listed here. Throughput accounting recognizes only one class of variable costs: the truly variable costs, like materials and components, which vary directly with the quantity produced. Finished goods inventories remain [[balance sheet|balance-sheet]] assets, but labor-efficiency ratios no longer evaluate managers and workers. Instead of an incentive to reduce labor cost, throughput accounting focuses attention on the relationships between throughput (revenue or income) on one hand and controllable operating expenses and changes in inventory on the other. Those relationships direct attention to the constraints or [[Bottleneck (logistics)|bottlenecks]] that prevent the system from producing more throughput, rather than to people - who have little or no control over their situations. ==National accounts== Inventories also play an important role in [[national accounts]] and the analysis of the [[business cycle]]. Some short-term [[macroeconomic]] fluctuations are attributed to the inventory cycle. ==Distressed inventory== Also known as distressed or expired stock, distressed inventory is inventory whose potential to be sold at a normal [[cost]] has passed or will soon pass. In certain industries it could also mean that the stock is or will soon be impossible to sell. Examples of distressed inventory include products that have reached their [[Expiration date|expiry date]], or have reached a date in advance of expiry at which the planned market will no longer purchase them (e.g. 3 months left to expiry), clothing that is defective or out of [[fashion]], and old newspapers or magazines. It also includes computer or consumer-electronic equipment that is obsolete or discontinued and whose manufacturer is unable to support it. One current example of distressed inventory is the [[VHS]] format.<ref>{{cite news |last=Boucher |first=Geoff |title=VHS era is winding down |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2008-12-22 |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-vhs-tapes22-2008dec22,0,5852342.story |accessdate=2008-12-28}}</ref> In 2001, Cisco wrote off
