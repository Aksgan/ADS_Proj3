against the rules so feelings of confusion and disappointment are common. Another, slightly more academic, suggestion as to the term ''silo effect'' focuses on the gradual draining of the entire silo's grain from a remarkably small opening in the bottom.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The [[wiktionary:Homogeneous|homogeneous]] state of the entire [[volume]] of grain makes it highly susceptible to small changes as they occur further and further down. This is because gravity, although apparently "unimportant" to a fully contained silo, suddenly shows itself to be an ''underlying force'' binding every single grain—something which becomes apparent when an "anomaly" occurs at the bottom. Moreover, the nature of grain makes it an excellent example of a "poorly connected" substance, prone to [[cascades]] of extreme collapse when they occur in favor of the systems overriding unified force. In this case, [[gravity]]. If the grain were more like a soapy [[foam]], or even a [[gel]], such a terrible collapse would be ''intrinsically'' averted, by means of the distributed multidirectional stability of its parts. == Information silo technologies == From a technology viewpoint, silos are managed by computer systems that do not provide efficient machine communication systems to other computers. In this view, "silo technologies" limit what software developers can do, and are the reason organizations must employ [[middle-ware]] and [[web service]]s to overcome the limitations of disparate systems. While effective for addressing specific needs, middle-ware and web services are considered stopgap measures because they must be applied on a case-by-case basis and cannot achieve [[business process interoperability]] among all disparate management systems worldwide. Silo technologies restrict the capabilities of the applications which manage much of the world's structured information. [[Databases]] are the time-tested way of storing, using and safeguarding vital enterprise business procedures and data. Most of every organization's computerized information is controlled by database applications, including all the "back end" data on the web. While many applications are very capable, even the most sophisticated are built with silos in mind, all but assuring that the business procedures and data in one maker's system will be unable to interact with similar—or even identical―business procedures and data in another maker's system. The vast number of incompatible database applications in use perpetuates the existence of silos, making it impossible for run-the-business software to take full advantage of the Internet. == See also == * [[Enterprise application integration]] * [[Data warehouse]] * [[Metadata publishing]] * [[Walled garden (technology)|Walled garden]] ==External links== *[http://www.camagazine.com/archives/print-edition/2002/march/columns/camagazine23400.aspx The silo effect in business] [[Category:Business software]] [[Category:Information systems]] [[Category:Enterprise application integration]] [[zh:信息烟囱]]</text> </page> <page> <id>18361</id> <title>Information society</title> <text>{{mergefrom|Informational society|date=January 2011}} {{Otheruses}} An '''information society''' is a [[society]] in which the creation, distribution, diffusion, use, integration and manipulation of [[information]] is a significant economic, political, and cultural activity. The [[knowledge economy]] is its economic counterpart whereby wealth is created through the economic exploitation of understanding. People that have the means to partake in this form of society are sometimes called [[digital citizens]]. As Beniger<ref>{{cite book |title=The Control Revolution: Technological and Economic Origins of the Information Society |last= Beniger |first=James R. |year=1986 |location=Cambridge, Mass. |publisher=Harvard University Press}}</ref> shows, this is one of many dozen labels that have been identified to suggest that we are entering a new phase of society. The markers of this rapid change may be technological, economic, occupational, spatial, cultural, or some combination of all of these.<ref>{{cite book |last=Webster |first=Frank |title=Theories of the Information Society |year=2002 |publisher=Routledge |location=Cambridge}}</ref> Information society is seen as the successor to [[industrial society]]. Closely related concepts are the [[post-industrial society]] ([[Daniel Bell]]), [[post-fordism]], [[postmodernity|post-modern]] society, [[knowledge society]], Telematic Society, [[Information Revolution]], and [[network society]] ([[Manuel Castells]]). ==Development of the information society model== One of the first people to develop the concept of the information society was the [[economist]] [[Fritz Machlup]]. In 1933 Machlup began studying the effect of patents on research. His work culminated in the breakthrough study "The production and distribution of knowledge in the United States" in 1962. This book was [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=227258 widely regarded] and was eventually translated into [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. The Japanese have also studied the information society (or ''johoka shakai'', [http://ja.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=情報化社会 情報化社会]). The issue of technologies and their role in contemporary society have been discussed in the scientific literature using a range of labels and concepts. This section introduces some of them. Ideas of a knowledge or [[information economy]], [[post-industrial society]], [[postmodernism|postmodern]] society, [[network society]], the [[information revolution]], informational capitalism, network capitalism, and the like, have been debated over the last several decades. [[Fritz Machlup]] (1962) introduced the concept of the [[knowledge economy|knowledge industry]]. He distinguished five sectors of the knowledge sector: education, research and development, mass media, information technologies, information services. Based on this categorization he calculated that in 1959 29% per cent of the GNP in the USA had been produced in knowledge industries. {{Citation needed|reason=What's the year referring to?|date=November 2009}} [[Peter Drucker]] has argued that there is a transition from an economy based on material goods to one based on knowledge.<ref>[[Peter Drucker]] (1969) The Age of Discontinuity. London: Heinemann</ref> [[Marc Porat]] distinguishes a primary (information goods and services that are directly used in the production, distribution or processing of information) and a secondary sector (information services produced for internal consumption by government and non-information firms) of the information economy.<ref>[[Marc Porat]] (1977) The Information Economy. Washington, DC: US Department of Commerce</ref> Porat uses the total value added by the primary and secondary information sector to the GNP as an indicator for the information economy. The [[OECD]] has employed Porat's definition for calculating the share of the information economy in the total economy (e.g. OECD 1981, 1986). Based on such indicators the information society has been defined as a society where more than half of the GNP is produced and more than half of the employees are active in the information economy.<ref name=deutsch1983>Karl Deutsch (1983) Soziale und politische Aspekte der Informationsgesellschaft.
