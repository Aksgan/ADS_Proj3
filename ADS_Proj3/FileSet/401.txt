Although it is unlikely that people are still manufacturing fakes,{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} older fakes continue to surface on [[eBay]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} ===Cases=== The [[FBI]] strictly cracked down on counterfeit beanies in the late 1990s, and some people were prosecuted for direct known involvement in their commerce. For example, a St. Louis Park, MN couple was sentenced to prison, probation, and fines for their involvement in smuggling counterfeit beanies.<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62458632.html Couple sentenced for selling counterfeit Beanie Babies.(NEWS) - Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN) - HighBeam Research<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[York]], [[North Yorkshire]], [[England]] authorities seized more than 6000 [[Princess (Beanie Baby)|Princesses]] and Britanniae from a [[Organized crime|ring]].<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-19416915.html British authorities seize 6,000 counterfeit Beanie Babies - AP Online - HighBeam Research<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> ==Media== During the wake of Beanie Babies' success, many Beanie Baby-centric publications were issued. One of the largest was ''[[Mary Beth's Bean Bag World]]'', a monthly magazine dedicated to Beanie Babies and competing plush toys.

These included characters from [[cartoons]] on the Nickelodeon television channel such as ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' and ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'', as well as characters from [[DreamWorks Animation]] movies such as ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' and most recently, 20th Century Fox's [[Ice Age 3|Ice Age: Dawn Of The Dinosaurs]]. They also made beanie babies for the promotion of the Legend of the Guardians movie based on the beloved owl fantasy books by Kathryn Lasky. The owl beanies are Soren, Gylfie, Digger and Eglantine. ==Competitors== {{Expand section|Other notable competitors|date=June 2009}} In wake of the toy line's success in the late 1990s, many competing plush toy lines were started.

In this [[data structure]] a node usually has two parents (unless it is the first or last on a level) and two children (unless it is on the last level). What separates the beap from Williams' [[Heap_%28data_structure%29|heap]] is that beap allows [[sublinear]] search. [[Image:beap.jpg|frame|Beap]] ==Performance== The height of the structure is approximately <math>\sqrt{n}</math>. Also, assuming the last level is full, the number of elements on that level is also <math>\sqrt{n}</math>. In fact, because of these properties all basic operations (insert, remove, find) run in <math>O(\sqrt{n})</math> time on average. Find operations in the heap can be <math>O(n)</math> in the worst case. Removal and insertion of new elements involves propagation of elements up or down (much like in a heap) in order to restore the beap invariant. An additional perk is that beap provides constant time access to the smallest element and <math>O(\sqrt{n})</math> time for the maximum element. ==Advantages== The main advantage of the beap is that it can be fully implemented in-place - only data nodes need to be present (no pointers or other extra information is required). However, this structure should be used with care since it is not <math>O(\log{n})</math> nor does it perform much better than a vector for small values of n. ==References== J.

The objective is to assemble these pieces into a 4 x 4 x 4 cube. There are 19,186 distinct ways of doing so, excluding rotations and reflections. Although the Bedlam cube is essentially just the logical next step up from the 3 x 3 x 3 [[Soma cube]], it is much more difficult to solve. == History == Two of the BBC2 'dragons', [[Rachel Elnaugh]] and [[Theo Paphitis]], were to invest in the The Bedlam puzzle during the second series of "[[Dragons' Den]]". They offered £100,000 for a 30% share of equity in Bedlam Puzzles. Danny Bamping (the entrepreneur behind Bedlam cube) finally chose a bank loan instead of their investment, as seen in the relevant "Where Are They Now" episode of "Dragons' Den".{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} == Records == The official world record for assembling the Bedlam Cube is 7.77 seconds, and was set by Aleksander Iljasov (Norway) on 28 September 2007.<ref name="record">Guinness World Records</ref> ==See also== * [[Slothouber–Graatsma puzzle]] * [[Conway puzzle]] * [[Polycube]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.bedlampuzzles.com The Official Site of Bedlam Puzzles] * [http://www.danieltebbutt.com/bedlam.html Bedlam Cube solver] * [http://scottkurowski.com/bedlamcube/ All 19,186 Bedlam Cube Solutions] [[Category:Discrete geometry]] [[Category:Tiling puzzles]] [[Category:Recreational mathematics]] {{Mathapplied-stub}} [[ar:مكعب بيدلام]] [[bs:Bedlamova kocka]] [[es:Cubo de Bedlam]] [[eo:Kubo de Bedlam]] [[ko:베들람 큐브]] [[no:Bedlams kube]] [[pl:Kostka Bedlam]] [[fi:Bedlamin kuutio]]</text> </page> <page> <id>3547</id> <title>Bedrock (framework)</title> <text>'''Bedrock''' was a joint effort by [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] and [[Symantec]] to produce a [[cross-platform|cross platform]] programming [[Software framework|framework]] for writing applications on the [[Macintosh|Apple Macintosh]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] platforms.
