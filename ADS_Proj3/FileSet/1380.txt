scripts) uses a [[procedural]] [[programming language]] specific to the Essbase calculation engine. This type of calculation may act upon any data value in the hypercube, and can therefore perform calculations that cannot be expressed as a simple formula. A calculation script must also be executed to trigger the calculation of aggregated values or stored calculations as described aboveâ€”a built-in calculation script (called the "default calculation") can be used to execute this type of calculation. ==Aggregate storage (Enterprise Analytics)== Although block storage effectively minimizes storage requirements without impacting retrieval time, it has limitations in its treatment of aggregate data in large applications, motivating the introduction of a second storage engine, named '''Aggregate Storage Option''' ('''Essbase ASO''') or more recently, '''Enterprise Analytics'''. This storage option makes the database behave much more similarly to OLAP databases like [[SQL Server Analysis Services]]. Following a data load, Essbase ASO does not store any aggregate values, but instead calculates them on demand. For large databases, where the time required to generate these values may become inconvenient, the database can materialize one or more aggregate "views", made up of one aggregate level from each dimension (for example, the database may calculate all combinations of the fifth generation of Product with the third generation of Customer), and these views are then used to generate other aggregate values where possible. This process can be partially automated, where the administrator specifies the amount of disk space that may be used, and the database generates views according to actual usage. This approach has a major drawback in that the cube cannot be treated for calculation purposes as a single large hypercube, because aggregate values cannot be directly controlled, so write-back from front-end tools is limited, and complex calculations that cannot be expressed as [[Multidimensional Expressions|MDX]] expressions are not possible. ===Calculation engine=== Essbase ASO can specify calculations as: * the aggregation of values through dimensional hierarchies; or * dynamically calculated dimension members. The first method (dimension aggregation) basically duplicates the algorithm used by Essbase BSO. The second method (dynamic calculations) evaluates [[Multidimensional Expressions|MDX]] expressions against dimension members. ==User interface== Many users work with Essbase data using as their [[user interface|interface]] an [[add-in]] for [[Microsoft Excel]] (previously also [[Lotus 1-2-3]]). The add-in adds a menu to the spreadsheet application that can be used to connect to Essbase databases, retrieve data, and navigate the cube's dimensions ("Zoom in", "Pivot", etc.).<ref name="dbag">Hyperion Solutions Corporation (2006). [http://dev.hyperion.com/techdocs/essbase/essbase_712/Docs/dbag/dba_html.htm Essbase Database Administrator's Guide].</ref> With the release of System 9, Hyperion provided a new user interface add-in for Essbase called "SmartView for [[Microsoft Office]]". SmartView provides access to Essbase and other System 9 content for [[Microsoft Powerpoint]], [[Microsoft Word]], [[Microsoft Outlook]] as well as supplanting the previous add-in for [[Microsoft Excel]]. In 2005, Hyperion began to offer a [[Visualization (computer graphics)|visualization]] tool called [[Tableau Software|Tableau]] under the name "[[Hyperion Visual Explorer]]".<ref name="Ref_">Tableau Software (2005). ''[http://www.tableausoftware.com/docs/ts_pr_Hyperion.pdf Tableau Software Lands Global OEM Deal with Hyperion]. Press release.</ref> Tableau originated at [[Stanford University]] as a government-sponsored research project to investigate new ways for users to interact with [[relational database|relational]] and [[OLAP]] databases. Other user-facing applications with support for Essbase databases include: * [[Hyperion Analyzer]] (aka Hyperion System 9 BI+ Web Analysis) * [[Hyperion Reports]] (aka Hyperion System 9 BI+ Financial Reporting) * [[Hyperion Enterprise Reporting]] * [[Hyperion Intelligence]] (aka Hyperion System 9 BI+ Interactive Reporting) * [[Hyperion SQR]] (aka Hyperion System 9 BI+ Production Reporting) * [[Alphablox]] * [[Arcplan dynaSight]] (aka Arcplan Enterprise) * [[Oracle Business Intelligence Suite Enterprise Edition]] (aka OBIEE, Siebel Analytics) * [http://www.appliedolap.com/products/dodeca Applied OLAP Dodeca] * [http://www.cxo-cockpit.com/CXOCockpit/OracleHyperionEssbaseandPlanningBenefits/tabid/140/Default.aspx CXO-Cockpit Reporting Suite] The previous offerings from Hyperion acquired new names as given below: {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center" !

The standardised [[XML for Analysis]] protocol can query Essbase data sources using the [[Multidimensional Expressions|MDX]] language. In 2007, Oracle Corporation began bundling Hyperion BI tools into Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition Plus.. ==Administrative interface== A number of standard interfaces can administer of Essbase applications: * ''ESSCMD'', the original [[command line interface]] for administration commands; * ''MaxL'', a "multi-dimensional database access language" which provides both a superset of ESSCMD commands, but with a syntax more akin to [[SQL]], as well as support for [[Multidimensional Expressions|MDX]] queries; * ''Essbase Application Manager'', the original [[Microsoft Windows]] [[GUI]] administration client, compatible with versions of Essbase before 7.0; * ''Essbase Administration Services'', later renamed ''Analytic Administration Services'', and then back to 'Essbase Administration Services' in v. 9.3.1, the currently-supported [[GUI]] administration client; and * ''Essbase Integration Server'' for maintaining the structure and content of Essbase databases based on data models derived from relational or file-based data sources. == Competitors == There are several significant competitors among the OLAP, analytics products to that of Essbase (HOLAP/MOLAP) on the market, among them Microsoft SQL Server [[Microsoft Analysis Services]], (MOLAP, HOLAP, ROLAP), IBM [[Cognos]] (ROLAP), IBM/Cognos/Applix [[TM1]] (MOLAP), [[Oracle OLAP]] (ROLAP/MOLAP), and [[MicroStrategy]] (ROLAP). Also note that of the above competitors, including Essbase, all use heterogenous relational ([[Microsoft SQL Server]], Oracle, IBM DB/2, TeraData, Access, etc.) or non-relational data sourcing (Excel, text Files, CSV Files, etc.) to feed the cubes (facts and dimensional data), except for Oracle OLAP which may only use Oracle relational sourcing. ==Export and/or product migration of Essbase== {{As of | 2009}} two options can export Essbase cubes into other formats: # [[CubePort]], a commercial conversion application, converts Essbase cubes to the Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services product. This product performs an object-to-object translation that make up an Essbase cube, including: outline, member formulas, calc scripts, data loading (load rules), report scripts to MDX
