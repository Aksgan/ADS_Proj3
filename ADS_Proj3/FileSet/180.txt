The first step counts the number of items in each bucket, and the second step computes where each bucket will start in the [[array data structure|array]]. The last step cyclically [[Permutation|permutes]] items to their proper bucket. Since the buckets are in order in the array, there is no collection step. The name comes by [[analogy]] with the [[Dutch national flag]] problem in the last step: efficiently [[Partition of a set|partition]] the array into many "stripes". Using some efficiency techniques, it is twice as fast as [[quicksort]] for large sets of [[String_%28computer_science%29|strings]]. Note: This works especially well when sorting a byte at a time, using 256 buckets. ==See also== *[[Bucket sort]] == External links == * {{DADS|American flag sort|americanFlagSort}} {{sorting}} [[Category:Sorting algorithms]] {{compu-prog-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>1708</id> <title>AmiZilla</title> <text>'''AmiZilla''' was an ongoing project which tried to port the [[Mozilla Firefox]] browser - and other Mozilla projects - to [[AmigaOS]], [[MorphOS]] and [[AROS]], and to fund efforts for achieving that goal. ==History== This project started in May 2003 from an idea of [[DiscreetFX]], a firm based in United States (Chicago, [[Illinois]]) which supports still existing Amiga [[Video Toaster]] market and produces and sells programs and Digital/FX sample collections for amateur, professional and broadcast studios customers. The AmiZilla project started in the form of [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] contest (i.e. donors uses internet online funding & money-transfer resources like [[PayPal]] to donate a free amount of money, which will be collected as a whole "booty" sum of money and then used to "pay" the person or the team who proves himself to be capable of realizing the whole project). The project was announced on Amigaworld Portal on 19 May 2003 with an amount of 1000 US Dollars<ref name=Announcement>{{Cite web| title = Announce of starting of AmiZilla Project at Amigaworld.net site | url = http://amigaworld.net/modules/news/article.php?storyid=500 | publisher=DiscreetFx and AmigaWorld.net site | accessdate = May 19, 2003}}</ref>, and in only one day it collected 2000 dollars by donations, climbing from 1000 to 3000 dollars <ref name=OSNews>{{Cite web| title = Announcement on OSNews.com stating on May 20, 2003 that AmiZilla Project collected 3000 dollars | url = http://www.osnews.com/story/3604/3000_USD_for_First_Programmer_to_Port_Mozilla_to_AmigaOS | publisher=OSNews | accessdate = May 20, 2003}}</ref>. Noteworthy for a very little community of users, by the 11th of June 2003 it had reached more than 4000 US$, and this enormous effort, and the rapid rampage in collecting money by the Amiga users (who were considered a sparse community) was noted also by Mozillazine online news portal <ref name=Mozillazine>{{Cite web| title = Announcement on Mozillazine (and update of 11 june) | url = http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3262 | publisher=MozillaZine online news magazine | accessdate = June 7, 2003}}</ref>, and by Slashdot.org online magazine<ref name=Slashdot>{{Cite web| title = Slashdot news corner on June 11 | url = http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/03/06/11/128248.shtml | publisher=Slashdot magazine and The Rest ©, Geeknet, Inc. | accessdate = June 11, 2003}}</ref>. As of 2007, a port of Mozilla's [[SpiderMonkey]] [[JavaScript]] engine was achieved, while a recompile of [[Netscape Portable Runtime|NSPR]] was in pre-alpha development. In the intentions of the support team, the future goals of the project included better support through the [[cairo (graphics)|cairo]] 2D graphics library which is slated for integration into the codebase of Firefox 3 (code-named Gran Paradiso), that was already ported to the Amiga platform. The AmiZilla project was closed November 19, 2009 without realizing significant results mainly due to the retirement of a contribution of $5,000 donated by a former Netscape executive who wanted to keep his anonymity and was tired of waiting for results that never come. The project during its entire life was capable to raise the noteworthy sum of $11,869.64 (as been evidenced in the page of donors at its site<ref name=Donors_Page>{{Cite web| title = Page of Donors at AmiZilla Project site | url = http://www.discreetfx.com/amizilla_donors.html | publisher=DiscreetFx | accessdate = August 10, 2008}}</ref>). Part of this amount of money was then transferred to [[TimberWolf Browser|TimberWolf]] browser bounty, and the main part of the money was given back to the former donors. The abrupt closing of the AmiZilla project caused a vaste echo in Amiga community and started a flamewar on Amiga community discussion sites, due to the fact that just some day before Amizilla Project ceased its operations, it were released to public the first screenshots of TimberWolf Browser by Friedens bothers. Some members of the Amiga community thought Timberwolf should be considered as the candidate to win the whole booty amount of money collected by the AmiZilla Project<ref name=Flamewar>{{Cite web| title = Announce of ending of AmiZilla Project at Amigaworld.net site | url = http://amigaworld.net/modules/news/article.php?storyid=5159 | publisher=DiscreetFx and AmigaWorld.net site | accessdate = November 20, 2009}}</ref>. But many others disagreed since Timberwolf had its own Bounty, set of rules and requirements and was only for Amiga OS 4.1. ==Rules== There were some main rules for AmiZilla project to be accomplished by those developers who wanted to achieve the full prize bounty. The main rule was the fact that Amizilla should be a porting of any of the Mozilla/Firefox browsers into Amiga platform, and it should be an Open Source project. the code should be made freely available to any Amiga developer, and easily ported (with any obvious obliged differences) to any actually existing Amiga system such as
