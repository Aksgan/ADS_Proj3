spreadsheet fields. The generator would automatically create the database input form, all the underlying spreadsheet architecture, with range names and query fields, turning a simple spreadsheet into an instant database in seconds. 3.0-Symphony extended earlier enhancements with additional add-ons, most notably: *WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) GUI (graphical user interface) and the addition of mouse support *BASE, the ability to integrate with any dBase IV file, no matter its size. *ExtraK add-on, extending memory capabilities for spreadsheet larger than 4MB. Like its predecessor Lotus 1-2-3, Symphony contained a reasonably powerful [[programming language]] referred to as its "Symphony Command Language (or SCL) ", which could be saved either within a spreadsheet or separately in "libraries" in the form of ''macros'': lists of menu operations, data, and other macro keywords. (One is "menucall," which allows users to call their own menus, embedded into spreadsheets, which behave just like Symphony's own.) Symphony's "learn" mode for macro recording automated this process, helping the end-user to quickly write macros to duplicate repetitive tasks or to go beyond that, without the need to understand computer programming. One of the most significant features of Symphony was the integration of the various modules using this command language. In its day, it was one of the few programs that would be able to log onto a stock market source, select data using dynamic or pre-assigned criteria, place that data into a spreadsheet, perform calculations, then chart the data and print out the results. All of this could take place unattended on a preset schedule. ==External links== *[http://content.techrepublic.com.com/2346-10877_11-175285.html Dinosaur Sightings: Lotus Symphony 3.0] (for DOS) by Greg Shultz, TechRepublic {{Lotus Software}} [[Category:Lotus software|Symphony]] [[Category:Office suites]] [[Category:DOS software]] [[Category:Spreadsheet software]] [[cs:Lotus Symphony]] [[de:Lotus Symphony]] [[es:Lotus Symphony]] [[fr:Lotus Symphony]] [[it:Lotus Symphony]] [[nl:Lotus Symphony]] [[pt:Lotus Symphony]] [[ru:IBM Lotus Symphony]] [[uk:Lotus Symphony]]</text> </page> <page> <id>22692</id> <title>Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma</title> <text>{{Refimprove|date=August 2010}} {{Peacock|date=August 2010}} {{Lead too short|date=August 2010}} {{Infobox officeholder | honorific-prefix = <small>[[The Right Honourable]]</small><br> | name = The Earl Mountbatten of Burma<br> | image=mountbatten.jpg | order=[[Governor-General of India|24th Viceroy of India]] | term_start=12 February 1947 | term_end=15 August 1947 | monarch=[[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI, Emperor of India]] | primeminister=[[Clement Attlee]] | predecessor=[[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]] | successor=Title extinguished on Independence of India and Pakistan<br>Himself (as Governor General of India)<br>[[Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari]] ([[Governor General of India]])<br>[[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] ([[Governor General of Pakistan]]) | order2=[[Governor General of India]] | term_start2=15 August 1947 | term_end2=21 June 1948 | monarch2=[[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI of India]] | primeminister2=[[Jawaharlal Nehru]] | predecessor2=Himself (as Viceroy of India) | successor2=[[C.

He was the last [[Viceroy of India]] (1947) and the [[Firsts in India|first]] [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]] of the independent [[Union of India]] (1947–48), from which the modern [[India|Republic of India]] would emerge in 1950. From 1954 until 1959 he was the [[First Sea Lord]], a position that had been held by his father, [[Prince Louis of Battenberg]], some forty years earlier. In 1979 Mountbatten was [[assassinated]] by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA), who planted a bomb in his fishing boat, the ''Shadow V'', at [[Mullaghmore, County Sligo]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]].<ref>''The Long War'' by Brendan O'Brien (ISBN 978-0815603191), page 55</ref> ==Ancestry== Lord Mountbatten was born as ''[[His Serene Highness]] Prince Louis of Battenberg'', although his [[German Empire|German]] [[Royal and noble styles|styles and titles]] were dropped in 1917. He was the youngest child and the second son of [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Marquess of Milford Haven|Prince Louis of Battenberg]] and his wife [[Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine]]. His maternal grandparents were [[Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse|Ludwig IV, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine]] and [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom]], who was a daughter of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]. His paternal grandparents were [[Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine|Prince Alexander of Hesse]] and [[Julia von Hauke|Princess Julia]] of [[Battenberg, Hesse|Battenberg]]. His paternal grandparents' marriage was [[morganatic]], because his grandmother was not of royal lineage; as a result, he and his father were styled "Serene Highness" rather than "Royal Highness," were not eligible to be titled Princes of Hesse and were given the less desirable Battenberg title. His siblings were [[Princess Alice of
