used as if it were for a real [[locale]]. Pseudolocalized text should be longer than the original text (perhaps twice as long), contain longer unbroken strings of characters to test line breaking, and contain characters from different [[writing system]]s. A tester will then inspect each element of the UI to make sure everything is displayed properly. To make it easier for the tester to find his or her way around the UI, the text may include the original text, or perhaps characters that look similar to the original text. For example, the string: Edit program settings might be replaced with: [!!! εÐiţ Þr0ģЯãm səTτıИğ§ !!!] The brackets on either side of the text make it easier to spot text that is cut off. This type of transformation can be performed by a simple tool and does not require a human translator, resulting in time and cost savings. Alternatively, a [[machine translation|machine translation system]] can be used for automatically generating translated strings. This type of machine-generated pseudolocalization has the advantage of the translated strings featuring the characteristics specific to the target language and being available in real time at very low cost. One approach to automatically generating translated strings is to add non-ASCII characters at the beginning and end of the existing text. This allows the existing text to still be read, but clearly identifies what text has been externalized and what text has not been externalized and exposes UI issues such as the need to accommodate longer text strings. This allows regular QA staff to test that the code has been properly internationalized. == See also == {{Portal|Software Testing}} * [[Fuzz testing]] * [[Localization testing]] ==References== [http://blogs.msdn.com/b/e7/archive/2009/07/07/engineering-windows-7-for-a-global-market.aspx Engineering Windows 7 for a Global Market] {{reflist}} [[Category:Software testing]] [[Category:Internationalization and localization]] [[zh:偽翻譯]]</text> </page> <page> <id>30439</id> <title>Pseudonormal space</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=May 2009}} In [[mathematics]], in the field of [[topology]], a [[topological space]] is said to be '''pseudonormal''' if given two disjoint [[closed set]]s in it, one of which is [[countable]], there are disjoint open sets containing them. Note the following: * Every [[normal space]] is pseudonormal. * Every pseudonormal space is [[regular space|regular]].

The real and the pseudo wavefunction and potentials match above a certain cutoff radius <math>r_c</math>.]] In [[physics]], a '''pseudopotential''' or '''effective potential''' is used as an approximation for the simplified description of complex systems. Applications include [[atomic physics]] and [[neutron scattering]]. == Atomic physics == The pseudopotential is an attempt to replace the complicated effects of the motion of the [[Core electron|core]] (i.e. non-[[Valence electron|valence]]) [[electrons]] of an [[atom]] and its nucleus with an effective [[potential]], or pseudopotential, so that the [[Schrödinger equation]] contains a modified effective potential term instead of the [[Coulomb's law|Coulombic]] potential term for core electrons normally found in the Schrödinger equation. The pseudopotential approximation was first introduced by [[Hans Hellmann]] in the 1930s. By construction of this pseudopotential, the valence [[wavefunction]] generated is also guaranteed to be [[orthogonal]] to all the core [[Quantum state|states]]. The pseudopotential is an effective potential constructed to replace the atomic all-electron potential such that core states are eliminated and the valence electrons are described by nodeless pseudo-wavefunctions. In this approach only the chemically active valence electrons are dealt with explicitly, while the core electrons are 'frozen', being considered together with the nuclei as rigid non-polarizable ion cores. Norm-conserving pseudopotentials are derived from an atomic reference state, requiring that the pseudo- and all-electron valence eigenstates have the same energies and amplitude (and thus density) outside a chosen core cutoff radius <math>r_c</math>. Pseudopotentials with larger cutoff radius are said to be ''softer'', that is more rapidly convergent, but at the same time less ''transferable'', that is less accurate to reproduce realistic features in different environments. Motivation: # Reduction of basis set size # Reduction of number of electrons # Inclusion of relativistic and other effects Approximations: # One-electron picture. # The small-core approximation assumes that there is no significant overlap between core and valence wave-function.
