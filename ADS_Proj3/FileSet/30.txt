DC-link quantity is then impressed by an energy storage element that is common to both stages, which is a capacitor C for the voltage DC-link or an inductor L for the current DC-link. The PWM rectifier is controlled in a way that a sinusoidal mains current is drawn, which is in phase or anti-phase (for energy feedback) with the corresponding mains phase voltage. Due to the DC-link storage element, there is the advantage that both converter stages are to a large extent decoupled for control purposes. Furthermore, a constant, mains independent input quantity exists for the PWM inverter stage, which results in high utilization of the converter’s power capability. On the other hand, the DC-link energy storage element has a relatively large physical volume, and when electrolytic capacitors are used, in the case of a voltage DC-link, there is potentially a reduced system lifetime. In order to achieve higher power density and reliability, it is makes sense to consider Matrix Converters that achieve three-phase AC/AC conversion without any intermediate energy storage element. Conventional Direct Matrix Converters (Fig. 4) perform voltage and current conversion in one single stage. A [[cycloconverter]] constructs an output, variable-frequency, approximately sinusoid waveform by switching segments of the input waveform to the output; there is no intermediate DC link. With switching elements such as [[SCR]]s, the output frequency must be lower than the input. Very large cycloconverters (on the order of 10 MW) are manufactured for compressor and wind-tunnel drives, or for variable-speed applications such as [[cement]] kilns. There is the alternative option of indirect energy conversion by employing the Indirect Matrix Converter (Fig. 5) or the Sparse Matrix Converter which was invented by Prof. Johann W. Kolar from the ETH Zurich. As with the DC-link based systems (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3), separate stages are provided for voltage and current conversion, but the DC-link has no intermediate storage element. Generally, by employing matrix converters, the storage element in the DC-link is eliminated at the cost of a larger number of semiconductors. Matrix converters are often seen as a future concept for variable speed drives technology, but despite intensive research over the decades they have until now only achieved low industrial penetration. The reason for this could be the higher complexity in modulation and analysis effort. ==References== {{Reflist}} [[Category:Electronic circuits]] [[Category:Electrical power conversion]] [[Category:Power electronics]]</text> </page> <page> <id>273</id> <title>ACCESS.bus</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=April 2008}} '''ACCESS.bus''' (or '''A.b''') is a peripheral-interconnect [[computer bus]] developed by [[Philips]] in the early 1990s. It is similar in purpose to [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]], in that it allows low-speed devices to be added or removed from a computer on the fly. While it was in use earlier than USB, it never became popular, largely due to considerably less corporate backing in the industry. A.b is a [[physical layer]] definition that describes the physical cabling and connectors used in the network. The higher layers, namely the signaling and protocol issues, are already defined to be the same as Philips' [[I²C]] bus. Compared to I²C, A.b: * adds two additional pins to provide power to the devices (+5 V and GND) * allows for only 125 devices out of I²C's 1024 * supports only the 100 kbit/s "standard mode" and 10 kbit/s "low-speed mode" The idea was to define a single standard that could be used both inside and outside a computer. A single I²C/A.b controller chip would be used inside the machine, connected on the [[motherboard]] to internal devices like the clock and battery power monitor. An A.b connector on the outside would then allow additional devices to be plugged into the bus. This way all of the low- and medium-speed devices on the machine would be driven by a single controller and [[protocol stack]]. A.b also defined a small set of standardized device classes. These included monitors, keyboards, "locators" (pointing devices like mice and joysticks), battery monitors, and "text devices" (modems, etc.). Depending on how much intelligence the device needed, the interface in the device could leave almost all of the work to the [[device driver|driver]]. This allows A.b to scale down to price points low enough for devices like mice. Although A.b mice and keyboards have been available (in limited fashion) for some time, the only serious attempt to use the system was by the [[VESA]] group. They needed a standardized bus for communicating device abilities between monitors and computers, and selected I²C because it required only two pins; by re-using existing "reserved" pins in the standard [[VGA]] they could implement a complete A.b bus (including power). A number of monitors with A.b connectors started appearing in the mid-1990s, notably those by [[NEC]], but this was at about the same time USB was being heavily promoted and few devices were available to plug into them. The bus remained the standard way for a monitor to communicate setup information to the host graphics card. Compared to USB, A.b has several advantages. One is that any device on the bus can be a master or a slave, and a protocol is defined for selecting which one a device should use under any particular circumstance. This allows devices to be plugged together with A.b without a host computer. For instance, a digital camera could be plugged directly into a printer and become the master. Under USB the computer is always the master and the devices are always slaves. In order to support the same sort of device-to-device connection, USB requires additional support in the dual-role devices in order to emulate a host and provide similar functionality. Another advantage of A.b is that devices can be strung together into a single daisy-chain&mdash;A.b can support, but does not require, the use of hubs. This can reduce cable-clutter significantly. On the downside, A.b is much slower than USB. Had [[FireWire|IEEE 1394]] (also known as FireWire) been widely available at the time, a computer with both A.b and FireWire would have been an attractive solution for all speed ranges. As it was, USB fit neatly into the niche between the two. With
