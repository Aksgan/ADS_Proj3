software and circuit research in cloud computing: accessdate=2009-12-02. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8392392.stm Intel has loaded Linux on each core; each core has an X86 architecture]: accessdate=2009-12-3</ref> [[Content-addressable memory]] (CAM)<ref>{{harvnb|Kohonen|1980|pp=1–368}}</ref> has become inexpensive enough to be used in networking, although no computer system has yet implemented hardware CAMs for use in programming languages. Currently, CAMs (or associative arrays) in software are programming-language-specific. Semiconductor memory cell arrays are very regular structures, and manufacturers prove their processes on them; this allows price reductions on memory products. During the 1980s, CMOS [[logic gates]] developed into devices that could be made as fast as other circuit types; computer power consumption could therefore be decreased dramatically. Unlike the continuous current draw of a gate based on other logic types, a [[CMOS]] gate only draws significant current during the 'transition' between logic states<!--ref>{{harvnb|Mead |Conway|1980|pp= 0}}</ref-->, except for leakage. This has allowed computing to become a [[commodity]] which is now ubiquitous, embedded in many forms, from greeting cards and telephones to [[Satellite communications#History|satellites]]. Computing hardware and its software have even become a metaphor for the operation of the universe.<ref>{{harvnb|Smolin|2001|pp= 53–57}}.Pages 220–226 are annotated references and guide for further reading.</ref> Although DNA-based computing and [[Quantum computer|quantum]] [[qubit]] computing are years or decades in the future, the infrastructure is being laid today, for example, with [[DNA origami]] on photolithography.<ref>Ryan J.

This allows the separation of RAM from CPU by optical interconnects.<ref>[http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/25924/?a=f Tom Simonite, "Computing at the speed of light", ''Technology Review'' Wed., Aug. 4, 2010] [[MIT]]</ref> An indication of the rapidity of development of this field can be inferred by the history of the seminal article.<ref>{{harvnb|Burks|Goldstine|von Neumann|1947|pp=1–464}} reprinted in ''[[Datamation]]'', September–October 1962.

After 1945, others read John von Neumann's ''First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC'', and immediately started implementing their own systems.
