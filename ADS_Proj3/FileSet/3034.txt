[[multiprocessor]] systems to be built more easily; a single MC88200 could support up to four MC88100s. However, this also meant that building the most basic system, with a single processor, required both chips and considerable wiring between them, driving up costs. This is likely another major reason for the 88000's limited success. [[Image:Motorola XC88110RS50G CPU overhead view.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Motorola 88110 RISC CPU]] This was later addressed by the [[superscalar]] [[MC88110]], which combined the CPU, FPU, MMU, and [[L1 cache]] into a single package. An additional modification, made at the behest of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]'s *T project, resulted in the MC88110MP, including on-chip communications for use in multi-processor systems.<ref name="*T:">{{cite web |title=*T: Integrated Building Blocks for Parallel Computing |url=http://csg.csail.mit.edu/pubs/memos/Memo-351/Memo-351.pdf |format=PDF |date=July 28, 1993 |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |author=Papadopoulos et al. |accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref> A version capable of speeds up to 100 MHz was planned as the MC88120, but was never built. An implementation for embedded applications, the MC88300, was under development during the early 1990s, but was eventually canceled. Ford was the only design win, and they were offered a PowerPC design as a replacement, which they accepted. == Products and applications == [[Image:Mvme-197le.jpg|thumb|right|[[Motorola Single Board Computers|MVME-197LE]]]] Motorola released a series of [[single-board computer]]s, known as the [[Motorola Single Board Computers|MVME]] series, for building "out of the box" systems based on the 88000, as well as the Series 900 ''stackable'' computers employing these MVME boards. Unlike tower or [[rack mount]] systems, the Series 900 sat on top of each other and connected to one another with bus-like cabling. The concept never caught on. [[Network Computing Devices|NCD]] used the 88100 (without the 88200) in its 88K [[X_Window_System#X_terminals|X-Terminals]]. The 88110 made it into some versions of a never released [[NeXT]] machine, the [[NeXT RISC Workstation]], but the project was canceled along with all NeXT hardware projects in 1993. The 4-processor [[OMRON]] luna88k machines from Japan used the m88k, and were used for a short time on the [[Mach kernel]] project at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. A number of similar smaller systems were also built, but none are widely known. In the embedded computer space, the "Tri-channel VMS Computer" in the [[F-15 S/MTD]] used three 88000s in a triply-redundant computer.<ref name="VMS">{{cite web |title=PSC Implementation and Integration |page=63 |url=http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19950026593_1995126593.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=NASA |author=Nobbs, Steven G |accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref> Major users were limited. The only widespread third-party computer use would be in the [[Data General AViiON]] series. These were fairly popular, and remain in limited use today. [[Encore Computer]] built their Encore-91 machine on the m88k, then introduced a completely ground-up redesign as the Infinity 90 series, but it is unclear how many of these machines were sold. In the early 1990s [[Northern Telecom]] used the 88100 and 88110 as the central processor in its [[Digital Multiplex System|DMS]] SuperNode family of telephone switches. All of these users were forced to move to other processors when Motorola later gave up on the m88k; DG went to Intel, Encore to the [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]]. [[GEC Computers]] used the 88100 to build the GEC 4310, one of the [[GEC 4000 series]] computers, but issues with memory management meant it didn't perform as well as their earlier [[gate array]] based and [[Am2900]] based GEC 4000 series computers, and no more GEC systems were design using the 88000 family. The [[BBN Butterfly]] model TC-2000 used the 88100 processor, and scaled to 512 CPUs. [[Linotype-Hell]] used the 88110 in their "Power" workstations running the [[Linotype-Hell DaVinci|DaVinci]] [[raster graphics editor]] for image manipulation. Dolphin Server, a spin-off from the dying Norsk Data built servers based on the 88k. Around 100 systems were shipped during 1988-1992. [[Alpha Microsystems]] originally planned to migrate to the 88K architecture from the [[Motorola 68000]], and internally created a machine around it running [[UNIX System V]], but it was later scrapped in favour of later 68K derivatives.<ref>http://ampm.floodgap.com/www/models.htm</ref> {{-}} == Operating system support == Motorola released its own [[UNIX System V]] derivative, System V/88, for its 88000-based systems.

The counterpart '''umount''' instructs the operating system that the file system should be disassociated from its mount point, making it no longer accessible. The mount and umount commands require [[root user]] privilege or the corresponding fine-grained privilege, unless the file system is defined as "user mountable" in the <code>/etc/[[fstab]]</code> file (which can only be modified by the root user). == Example == The second partition of a hard disk is mounted with the command: <source lang="bash"> $ mount /dev/hda2 /new/subdir </source> and unmounted with the command: <source lang="bash"> $ umount /dev/hda2 </source> or <source lang="bash"> $ umount /new/subdir </source> To list all mounted file systems: <source lang="bash"> $ mount </source> To remount a partition with specific [[fstab#Options common to all filesystems|options]]: <source lang="bash"> $ mount -o remount,rw /dev/hda2 </source> To mount an [[ISO 9660|ISO]] file (Linux): <source lang="bash"> $ mount -o loop <isofile-source> <mount-point> </source> To mount all filesystems listed in [[fstab]]: <source lang="bash"> $ mount -a </source> == pmount == pmount is a [[wrapper]] around the standard mount program which permits normal users to mount removable devices without a matching /etc/[[fstab]] entry. This provides a robust basis for [[automounter|automounting]] frameworks like GNOME's [[Utopia
