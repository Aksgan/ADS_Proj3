Each of the logical rules introduces a new logical formula either on the left or on the right of the [[Turnstile (symbol)|turnstile]] <math>\vdash</math>. In contrast, the structural rules operate on the structure of the sequents, ignoring the exact shape of the formulae. The two exceptions to this general scheme are the axiom of identity (I) and the rule of (Cut). Although stated in a formal way, the above rules allow for a very intuitive reading in terms of classical logic. Consider, for example, the rule (&and;L<sub>1</sub>). It says that, whenever one can prove that &Delta; can be concluded from some sequence of formulae that contain A, then one can also conclude &Delta; from the (stronger) assumption, that A&and;B holds. Likewise, the rule (&not;R) states that, if &Gamma; and A suffice to conclude &Delta;, then from &Gamma; alone one can either still conclude &Delta; or A must be false, i.e. &not;A holds. All the rules can be interpreted in this way. For an intuition about the quantifier rules, consider the rule (&forall;R). Of course concluding that &forall;x A holds just from the fact that A[y/x] is true is not in general possible. If, however, the variable y is not mentioned elsewhere (i.e. it can still be chosen freely, without influencing the other formulae), then one may assume, that A[y/x] holds for any value of y. The other rules should then be pretty straightforward. Instead of viewing the rules as descriptions for legal derivations in predicate logic, one may also consider them as instructions for the construction of a proof for a given statement. In this case the rules can be read bottom-up; for example, (&and;R) says that, to prove that A&and;B follows from the assumptions &Gamma; and &Sigma;, it suffices to prove that A can be concluded from &Gamma; and B can be concluded from &Sigma;, respectively. Note that, given some antecedent, it is not clear how this is to be split into &Gamma; and &Sigma;. However, there are only finitely many possibilities to be checked since the antecedent by assumption is finite. This also illustrates how proof theory can be viewed as operating on proofs in a combinatorial fashion: given proofs for both A and B, one can construct a proof for A&and;B. When looking for some proof, most of the rules offer more or less direct recipes of how to do this. The rule of cut is different: It states that, when a formula A can be concluded and this formula may also serve as a premise for concluding other statements, then the formula A can be "cut out" and the respective derivations are joined. When constructing a proof bottom-up, this creates the problem of guessing A (since it does not appear at all below). The [[cut-elimination theorem]] is thus crucial to the applications of sequent calculus in [[automated deduction]]: it states that all uses of the cut rule can be eliminated from a proof, implying that any provable sequent can be given a ''cut-free'' proof. The second rule that is somewhat special is the axiom of identity (I). The intuitive reading of this is obvious: every formula proves itself. Like the cut rule, the axiom of identity is somewhat redundant: the [[completeness of atomic initial sequents]] states that the rule can be restricted to [[atomic formula]]s without any loss of provability. Observe that all rules have mirror companions, except the ones for implication. This reflects the fact that the usual language of first-order logic does not include the "is not implied by" connective <math>\not\leftarrow</math> that would be the De Morgan dual of implication. Adding such a connective with its natural rules would make the calculus completely left-right symmetric. ===An example derivation=== As for an example, this is the sequential derivation of <math>\vdash</math>(A &or; &not;A), known as the ''[[Law of excluded middle]]'' (''tertium non datur'' in Latin). [[Image:Excluded middle proof.png|center]] This derivation also emphasizes the strictly formal structure of the sequent calculus. For example, the right logical rules as defined above always act on the first formula of the right sequent, such that the application of (PR) is formally required. Note, though, that this is in part an artifact of the presentation, in the original style of Gentzen. A common simplification is the use of [[multiset]]s of formulas, rather than sequences, eliminating the need for an explicit permutation rule. ===Structural rules=== The structural rules deserve some additional discussion. Weakening (W) allows the addition of arbitrary elements to a sequence. Intuitively, this is allowed in the antecedent because we can always add assumptions to our proof, and in the succedent because we can always allow for alternative conclusions. Contraction (C) and Permutation (P) assure that neither the order (P) nor the multiplicity of occurrences (C) of elements of the sequences matters. Thus, one could instead of [[sequence]]s also consider [[Set (mathematics)|sets]]. The extra effort of using sequences, however, is justified since part or all of the structural rules may be omitted. Doing so, one obtains the so-called [[substructural logic]]s. ===Properties of the system LK=== This system of rules can be shown to be both [[soundness|sound]] and [[completeness|complete]] with respect to first-order logic, i.e. a statement A follows [[semantics|semantically]] from a set of premises &Gamma; (<math>\Gamma \vDash A</math>) [[iff]] the sequent <math>\Gamma \vdash A</math> can be derived by the above rules. In the sequent calculus, the rule of [[cut-elimination|cut is admissible]]. This result is also referred to as Gentzen's ''Hauptsatz'' ("Main Theorem"). ==Variants== The above rules can be modified in various ways: ===Minor structural alternatives=== There is some freedom of choice regarding the technical details of how sequents and structural rules are formalized. As long as every derivation in LK can be effectively transformed to a derivation using
