Teams design and build an autonomous ground vehicle capable of completing several difficult challenges. The competition is well suited to senior design “capstone” courses as well as extracurricular design projects. <ref>Bernard L. Theisen and Dmitri Nguyen, "The 14TH Annual Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition: intelligent teams creating intelligent ground robots", Proceedings Vol. 6384, Intelligent Robots and Computer Vision XXIV: Algorithms, Techniques, and Active Vision, 2 October 2006</ref> The competition has taken place each year since 1993. The competition is normally held on the campus of [[Oakland University]] in [[Rochester, Michigan]], although it has occasionally moved to other venues within the state of Michigan. Approximately 40 teams typically participate. ==Competition Overview== The details of the competition change from year to year. In 2010 the competition included the following four events. <ref>“Official Competition Rules” retrieved from http://www.igvc.org/rules.html on July 31, 2010.</ref> # Design Competition: The design competition includes a written design report, an oral presentation, and an examination of the vehicle. # Autonomous Challenge: The autonomous challenge is the major event. Qualification for this event is required. A fully autonomous ground vehicle must navigate an outdoor obstacle course. The course consists of a lane painted with white or yellow lines on a grassy field. Obstacles come in a wide variety of shapes and colors including barrels, cones, saw horses, and posts. The vehicles often use a camera to detect the boundary lines and a laser rangefinder to detect obstacles, although a variety of other approaches have been used. # Navigation Challenge: This event requires the vehicle to travel autonomously from a specified starting point to a sequence of destinations specified by latitude and longitude. Qualification for this event is also required. Various obstacles are placed around the course including a fence with a randomly relocated opening. # JAUS Challenge: The JAUS challenge is optional. This challenge requires a vehicle to demonstrate compatibility with the [[JAUS]] (Joint Architecture for Unmanned Systems) standard by receiving and responding to a specified list of JAUS commands from the judges. The competition is often sponsored by the [[United States Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center]] (TARDEC) and the [[Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International]] (AUVSI) in addition to other sponsors. ==References== {{Reflist}} [[Category:Robotics competitions]]</text> </page> <page> <id>18760</id> <title>Intelligent Small World Autonomous Robots for Micro-manipulation</title> <text>'''Intelligent Small World Autonomous Robots for Micro-manipulation''' (I-Swarm) is a [[Europe]]an research project to develop millimeter-scale [[robots]] for dangerous activities. It is coordinated by Jörg Seyfried at the [[University of Karlsruhe]] in [[Germany]]. The robots operate on [[solar power]] and can communicate between each other. ==Aims== The I-Swarm project aims to develop and produce a large scale [[swarm]] (up to 1,000<ref>ISWARM, University of Karlsruhe, Research and Innovation in Baden-Württemberg http://www.wissenschaftwirtschaft-bw.de/index.php4?topic=universitaet&uni_id=6&profile_id=28</ref>) of [[Microbotics|microrobots]].<ref>IPR Publications, 2004, Abstract http://wwwipr.ira.uka.de/en/Publications/detailed_publication.htm?id=1095254176</ref> ==Robots== The robots' proposed size is 2 x 2 x 1 mm. This small size means that [[sensory]] and computational capabilities will be limited.
