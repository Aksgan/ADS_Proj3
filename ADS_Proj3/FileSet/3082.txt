as an interface to [[Atomistix ToolKit]] (version 2.1) in order to provide a more flexible input format. A NanoLanguage script (or input file) is just a Python program and can be anything from a few lines to a script performing complex numerical simulations, communicating with other scripts and files, and communicating with other software (e.g. plotting programs). NanoLanguage is not a [[Property|proprietary]] product of Atomistix and can be used as an interface to other [[density functional theory]] codes as well as to codes utilizing e.g. [[Tight binding|tight-binding]], k.p, or [[quantum chemistry|quantum-chemical]] methods. <ref>Atomistix unveils open software platform for nanotech modeling, SmallTimes, 2006 [http://www.smalltimes.com/articles/article_display.cfm?Section=ONART&C=Mater&ARTICLE_ID=274363&KEYWORDS=atomistix&p=109]</ref> <ref>[http://www.atomistix.com/manuals/ATK_2.2/html/index.html Introduction to NanoLanguage]</ref> == Features == Built on top of [[Python language|Python]], NanoLanguage includes the same functionality as Python and with the same syntax. Hence, NanoLanguage contains, among other features, common programming elements ([[for loop]]s, [[conditional statement|if statements]], etc), mathematical functions, and data [[array data structure|arrays]]. In addition, a number of concepts and [[object (computer science)|objects]] relevant to [[quantum chemistry]] and physics are built into NanoLanguage, e.g. a [[periodic table]], a unit system (including both [[SI units]] and atomic units like [[Ångström]]), [[constructor (computer science)|constructor]]s of atomic geometries, and different functions for density-functional theory and transport calculations. <ref>[http://www.atomistix.com/index.php?id=nanolanguage atomistix | NanoLanguage<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> == Example == This NanoLanguage script uses the [[Kohn-Sham equations|Kohn-Sham method]] to calculate the total energy of a water molecule as a function of the bending angle. <source lang="python"> #Define function for molecule setup def waterConfiguration(angle,bondLength): from math import sin,cos theta = angle.inUnitsOf(radians) positions = [(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)*Angstrom, (1.0, 0.0, 0.0)*bondLength, (cos(theta), sin(theta), 0.0)*bondLength] elements = [Oxygen] + [Hydrogen]*2 return MoleculeConfiguration(elements,positions) #Choose DFT method with default arguments method = KohnShamMethod() #Scan different bending angles and calculate the total energy for i in range(30,181,10): theta = i*degrees h2o = waterConfiguration(theta, 0.958*Angstrom) scf = method.apply( h2o ) print 'Angle = ', theta, ' Total Energy = ',calculateTotalEnergy(scf) </source> == External links == *http://www.atomistix.com/index.php?id=nanolanguage *http://www.atomistix.com/manuals/ATK_2.2/html/index.html Introduction to NanoLanguage ==See also== *[[List of software for nanostructures modeling]] == References == <references/> [[Category:Nanotechnology]] [[Category:Computational science]] [[Category:Computational chemistry software]] [[Category:Physics software]] {{nano-tech-stub}} {{science-software-stub}} [[ar:لغة نانو]]</text> </page> <page> <id>25762</id> <title>Nanonetwork</title> <text>A '''nanonetwork''' or '''nanoscale network''' is a set of interconnected [[nanomachines]], i.e., devices in the order of a few hundred [[nanometer]]s or a few [[micrometer]]s at most, which are able to perform only very simple tasks such as [[computing]], [[data storing]], [[sensing]] and [[actuation]].<ref>[[Ian F.

Nanonetworks enable new applications of [[nanotechnology]] in the [[biomedical]] field, [[Natural environment|environmental]] research, [[military]] technology and [[industrial]] and [[consumer goods]] applications. ==Communication Approaches== Classical communication paradigms need to be revised for the nanoscale. The two main alternatives for communication in the nanoscale are based either on electromagnetic communication or on molecular communication. ===Electromagnetic Communication=== This is defined as the transmission and reception of [[electromagnetic radiation]] from components based on novel [[nanomaterials]].<ref>C.

For the time being, two main alternatives for electromagnetic communication in the nanoscale have been envisioned. First, it has been experimentally demonstrated that is possible to receive and [[demodulate]] an electromagnetic wave by means of a [[nanoradio]], i.e., an electromechanically resonating [[carbon nanotube]] which is able to decode an amplitude or frequency modulated wave.<ref>B.

The different molecular communication techniques can be classified according to the type of molecule propagation in walkaway-based, flow-based or diffusion-based communication. In '''walkway-based''' molecular communication, the molecules propagate through pre-defined pathways by using carrier substances, such as [[molecular motors]].<ref>M. Moore, A. Enomoto, T. Nakano, R.
