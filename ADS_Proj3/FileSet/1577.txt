and ideas. According to Meiklejohn, democracy will not be true to its essential ideal if those in power are able to manipulate the electorate by withholding information and stifling criticism. Meiklejohn acknowledges that the desire to manipulate opinion can stem from the motive of seeking to benefit society. However, he argues, choosing manipulation negates, in its means, the democratic ideal.<ref>{{cite book |title=Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion |last=Marlin |first=Randal |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Broadview Press |location= |isbn=1551113767 978-1551113760 |pages=226–227 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Zp38Ot2g7LEC&pg=PA226&dq=%22free+speech%22+democracy }}</ref> [[Eric Barendt]] has called this defence of free speech on the grounds of democracy "probably the most attractive and certainly the most fashionable free speech theory in modern Western democracies".<ref>{{cite book |title=Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion |last=Marlin |first=Randal |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Broadview Press |location= |isbn=1551113767 978-1551113760 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Zp38Ot2g7LEC&pg=PA226&dq=%22free+speech%22+democracy |page=226 }}</ref> Thomas I. Emerson expanded on this defence when he argued that freedom of speech helps to provide a balance between [[stability]] and [[Social change|change]]. Freedom of speech acts as a "safety valve" to let off steam when people might otherwise be bent on [[revolution]]. He argues that "The principle of open discussion is a method of achieving a moral adaptable and at the same time more stable community, of maintaining the precarious balance between healthy cleavage and necessary consensus." Emerson furthermore maintains that "Opposition serves a vital social function in offsetting or ameliorating (the) normal process of bureaucratic decay."<ref>{{cite book |title=Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion |last=Marlin |first=Randal |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Broadview Press |location= |isbn=1551113767 978-1551113760 |pages=228–229 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Zp38Ot2g7LEC&pg=PA226&dq=%22free+speech%22+democracy }}</ref> Research undertaken by the [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]] project at the [[World Bank]], indicates that freedom of speech, and the process of accountability that follows it, have a significant impact in the quality of [[governance]] of a country. "Voice and Accountability" within a country, defined as "the extent to which a country's [[citizen]]s are able to participate in selecting their [[government]], as well as freedom of expression, [[freedom of association]], and [[Freedom of the press|free media]]" is one of the six dimensions of governance that the Worldwide Governance Indicators measure for more than 200 countries.<ref>http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi2007/pdf/booklet_decade_of_measuring_governance.pdf A Decade of Measuring the Quality of Governance</ref> == Social interaction and community == Richard Moon has developed the argument that the value of freedom of speech and freedom of expression lies with social interactions.

However, Mill also introduced what is known as the harm principle, in placing the following limitation on free expression: "the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others."<ref name="leeds1"/> In 1985 [[Joel Feinberg]] introduced what is known as the "offence principle", arguing that Mill's harm principle does not provide sufficient protection against the wrongful behaviours of others. Feinberg wrote "It is always a good reason in support of a proposed criminal prohibition that it would probably be an effective way of preventing serious offense (as opposed to injury or harm) to persons other than the actor, and that it is probably a necessary means to that end."<ref name="ref1">[http://www.iep.utm.edu/l/law-phil.htm Philosophy of Law]</ref> Hence Feinberg argues that the harm principle sets the bar too high and that some forms of expression can be legitimately prohibited by law because they are very offensive. But, as offending someone is less serious than harming someone, the penalties imposed should be higher for causing harm.<ref name="ref1"/> In contrast Mill does not support legal penalties unless they are based on the harm principle.<ref name="leeds1"/> Because the degree to which people may take offense varies, or may be the result of unjustified prejudice, Feinberg suggests that a number of factors need to be taken into account when applying the offense principle, including: the extent, duration and social value of the speech, the ease with which it can be avoided, the motives of the speaker, the number of people offended, the intensity of the offense, and the general interest of the community at large.<ref name="leeds1"/> == The Internet and Information Society == Jo Glanville, editor of the [[Index on Censorship]], states that "the Internet has been a revolution for [[censorship]] as much as for free speech".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/nov/17/censorship-internet |title=The big business of net censorship |last=Glanville |first=Jo |date=17 November 2008 |publisher= The Guardian | location=London}}</ref> International, national and regional standards recognise that freedom of speech, as one form of freedom of expression, applies to any medium, including the [[Internet]].<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The [[Communications Decency Act]] (CDA) of 1996 was the first notable attempt by the [[United
