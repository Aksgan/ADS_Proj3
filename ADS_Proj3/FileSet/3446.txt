"thunder" - which was presented as a challenge, and answered with the correct response - "flash". The challenge and response were changed periodically. American paratroopers also famously used a device known as a "cricket" on [[D-Day]] in place of a password system as a temporarily unique method of identification; one metallic click given by the device in lieu of a password was to be met by two clicks in reply.<ref>Bando, Mark ''Screaming Eagles: Tales of the 101st Airborne Division in World War II''</ref> Passwords have been used with computers since the earliest days of computing. [[MIT]]'s [[Compatible Time-Sharing System|CTSS]], one of the first time sharing systems, was introduced in 1961. It had a LOGIN command that requested a user password. "After typing PASSWORD, the system turns off the printing mechanism, if possible, so that the user may type in his password with privacy."<ref>CTSS Programmers Guide, 2nd Ed., MIT Press, 1965</ref> [[Robert Morris (cryptographer)|Robert Morris]] invented the idea of storing login passwords in a hashed form as part of the [[Unix]] operating system. His algorithm, known as [[crypt (Unix)|crypt(3)]], used a 12-bit [[salt (cryptography)|salt]] and invoked a modified form of the [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] algorithm 25 times to reduce the risk of pre-computed [[dictionary attack]]s. ==See also== * [[Access Code]] * [[Authentication]] * [[CAPTCHA]] * [[Diceware]] * [[Kerberos (protocol)]] * [[Keyfile]] * [[Passphrase]] * [[Password manager]] * [[Password policy]] * [[Password psychology]] * [[Password strength]] * [[Password length parameter]] * [[Password cracking]] * [[Password fatigue]] * [[Password-authenticated key agreement]] * [[Password notification e-mail]] * [[Password synchronization]] * [[Pre-shared key]] * [[Random password generator]] * [[Rainbow table]] * [[Self-service password reset]] * [[Shibboleth (computer security)|Shibboleth]] ==References== <references/> ==External links== <!--========================({{No More Links}})============================ | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

A common approach is to repeatedly try guesses for the password. The purpose of password cracking might be to help a user recover a forgotten password (though installing an entirely new password is less of a security risk, but involves system administration privileges), to gain unauthorized access to a system, or as a preventive measure by system administrators to check for easily crackable passwords. On a file-by-file basis, password cracking is utilized to gain access to digital evidence for which a judge has allowed access but the particular file's access is restricted. ==Prevention== {{main|Shadow password}} The best method of preventing password cracking is to ensure that attackers cannot get access even to the encrypted password. For example, on the [[Unix]] [[operating system]], encrypted passwords were originally stored in a publicly accessible file <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>. On modern Unix (and similar) systems, on the other hand, they are stored in the file <tt>/etc/shadow</tt>, which is accessible only to programs running with enhanced privileges (ie, 'system' privileges). This makes it harder for a malicious user to obtain the encrypted passwords in the first instance. Unfortunately, many common network protocols transmit passwords in cleartext or use weak challenge/response schemes.<ref>[http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/2001-11/pdfs/singer.pdf No Plaintext Passwords]</ref><ref>[http://www.schneier.com/paper-pptp.html Cryptanalysis of Microsoft's Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol]</ref> Modern Unix systems have replaced traditional DES-based password hashing with stronger methods based on MD5 and Blowfish.<ref>[http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix99/provos.html A Future-Adaptable Password Scheme]</ref> Other systems have also begun to adopt these methods. For instance, the Cisco IOS originally used a reversible [[Vigenère cipher]] to encrypt passwords, but now uses md5-crypt with a 24-bit salt when the "enable secret" command is used.<ref>[http://c3rb3r.openwall.net/mdcrack/download/FAQ-18.txt MDCrack FAQ 1.8]</ref> These newer methods use large salt values which prevent attackers from efficiently mounting offline attacks against multiple user accounts simultaneously. The algorithms are also much slower to execute which drastically increases the time required to mount a successful offline attack.<ref name="usenix.org">[http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/2004-06/pdfs/alexander.pdf Password Protection for Modern Operating Systems]</ref> Solutions like a [[security token]] give a [[formal proof]] answer by constantly shifting password. Those solutions abruptly reduce the timeframe for [[Brute-force attack|brute forcing]] (attacker needs to break and use the password within a single shift) and they reduce the value of the stolen passwords because of its short time validity. ==Software== {{maincat|Password cracking software}} There are many password cracking software tools, but the most popular<ref name="sectools-top-10">{{cite web |url=http://sectools.org/crackers.html |accessdate=2008-11-01 |title=Top 10 Password Crackers |publisher=Sectools }}</ref> are [[Cain (software)|Cain and Abel]], [[John the Ripper]], [[Hydra (software)|Hydra]], [[ElcomSoft]] and [[Lastbit]]. Many [[litigation support software]] packages also include password cracking functionality. Most of these packages employ a mixture of
