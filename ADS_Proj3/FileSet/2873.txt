The smaller size is normally recommended for women under 25 who have not given birth vaginally. The larger size is normally recommended for women over 25 or who have given birth vaginally. The menstrual cups with the smallest size diameter are recommended for teenagers. As well as width, length also needs to be considered. If a woman's cervix sits particularly low, she may need to consider a shorter length cup. Shape is also important, as women vary in shape preferences for comfort. Capacity is important to women who have heavier flows; however, all of the menstrual cups currently available have higher capacity than a regular tampon.<ref name=AssortedSizeCharts>{{cite web |url=http://community.livejournal.com/menstrual_cups/1285963.html |title=Assorted Size Charts |date=18 August 2008 |publisher=Menstrual Cup Support |accessdate=8 November 2009}}</ref> ==History== An early version of a bell-shaped menstrual cup was patented in 1932.<ref>Goddard, L.J.

This proved to be the first commercially viable menstrual cup as it is still in manufacture today. The first silicone menstrual cup was the UK-manufactured Mooncup. Most menstrual cups are now manufactured from silicone because of its hypoallergenic properties. The German brand Meluna manufacture their cup out of TPE (thermoplastic elastomer). ==Advantages and Disadvantages== Menstrual cups are more cost-efficient and environmentally friendly than tampons, as they are reusable. They also carry less risk of TSS, because they do not absorb menstrual blood (TSS most often results from bacteria entering the bloodstream after tearing of vaginal tissue results from the drying caused by tampons or other absorption products). In addition, most disposable tampons are made of artificial fibers that break away and are left inside the vagina, which does not occur with use of a menstrual cup. Using menstrual cups is more time-consuming, with the required cleaning and disinfection after use. It is also possible for them to be more difficult to remove (though risk of any negative effects from this are low). ==See also== {{commons|Menstrual cup}} *[[Tampon]] *[[Sanitary napkin]] *[[Cloth menstrual pad]] *[[Toxic shock syndrome]] *[[Cervical cap]] *[[Diaphragm (contraceptive)]] == References == {{Reflist|2}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Menstrual Cup}} [[Category:Feminine hygiene]] [[Category:Menstrual cycle]] [[ca:Mooncup]] [[cs:Menstruační kalíšek]] [[da:Menstruationsbæger]] [[de:Menstruationstasse]] [[es:Copa menstrual]] [[fr:Coupe menstruelle]] [[it:Coppa mestruale]] [[he:גביעונית (היגיינה)]] [[hu:Menstruációs csésze]] [[nl:Menstruatiecup]] [[ja:月経カップ]] [[no:Damebeger]] [[pl:Miseczka menstruacyjna]] [[pt:Coletor menstrual]] [[ro:Cupă menstruală]] [[ru:Менструальная чашечка]] [[sl:Menstrualna skodelica]] [[fi:Kuukautiskuppi]] [[sv:Menskopp]]</text> </page> <page> <id>24072</id> <title>Mental property</title> <text>{{Weasel|date=April 2010}} {{Inappropriate person|date=April 2010}} {{Unreferenced|auto=yes|date=December 2009}} A '''mental property''' or a '''mind property''' is a [[property]] of a/the [[mind]].
