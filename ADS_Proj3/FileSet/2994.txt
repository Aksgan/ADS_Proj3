to at least 100,000 years ago, though there is no evidence of a society or economy that relied primarily on barter.<ref>[[Marcel Mauss|Mauss, Marcel]]. 'The Gift: The Form and Reason for Exchange in Archaic Societies.' pp. 36-37.</ref> Instead, non-monetary societies operated largely along the principles of [[gift economics]]. When barter did occur, it was usually between either complete strangers or potential enemies.<ref>Graeber, David. 'Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value'. pp. 153-154.</ref> Many cultures around the world eventually developed the use of [[commodity money]]. The [[shekel]] was originally a unit of weight, and referred to a specific weight of [[barley]], which was used as currency.<ref>Kramer, ''History Begins at Sumer'', pp. 52–55.</ref>. The first usage of the term came from [[Mesopotamia]] circa 3000 BC. Societies in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Australia used [[shell money]] – often, the shells of the money [[cowry]] (''Cypraea moneta L.'' or ''C. annulus L.''). According to [[Herodotus]], the [[Lydians]] were the first people to introduce the use of gold and [[silver coin]]s.<ref>Herodotus. ''Histories'', I, 94</ref> It is thought by modern scholars that these first stamped [[coins]] were minted around 650–600 BC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rg.ancients.info/lion/article.html |title=Goldsborough, Reid.

Eventually, these receipts became generally accepted as a means of payment and were used as money. Paper money or [[banknotes]] were first used in [[China]] during the [[Song Dynasty]]. These banknotes, known as "[[Jiaozi (currency)|jiaozi]]" evolved from [[promissory notes]] that had been used since the 7th century. However, they did not displace commodity money, and were used alongside coins. Banknotes were first issued in Europe by [[Stockholms Banco]] in 1661, and were again also used alongside coins. The [[gold standard]], a [[monetary system]] where the medium of exchange are paper notes that are convertible into pre-set, fixed quantities of gold, replaced the use of gold coins as currency in the 17th-19th centuries in Europe. These gold standard notes were made [[legal tender]], and redemption into gold coins was discouraged. By the beginning of the 20th century almost all countries had adopted the gold standard, backing their legal tender notes with fixed amounts of gold. After [[World War II]], at the [[Bretton Woods Conference]], most countries adopted fiat currencies that were fixed to the [[US dollar]]. The US dollar was in turn fixed to gold. In 1971 the US government suspended the convertibility of the US dollar to gold. After this many countries de-pegged their currencies from the US dollar, and most of the world's currencies became unbacked by anything except the governments' fiat of legal tender and the ability to convert the money into goods via payment. ===Etymology=== The word "money" is believed to originate from a temple of [[Hera]], located on [[Capitoline]], one of Rome's seven hills. In the ancient world Hera was often associated with money. The temple of [[Juno Moneta]] at Rome was the place where the mint of Ancient Rome was located.<ref>D'Eprio, Peter & Pinkowish, Mary Desmond (1998). What Are The Seven Wonders Of The World? First Anchor Books, p.192. ISBN 0-385-49062-3</ref> The name "Juno" may derive from the Etruscan goddess [[Uni (mythology)|Uni]] (which means "the one", "unique", "unit", "union", "united") and "Moneta" either from the Latin word "monere" (remind, warn, or instruct) or the Greek word "moneres" (alone, unique). In the Western world, a prevalent term for coin-money has been ''[[wikt:specie|specie]]'', stemming from Latin ''in specie'', meaning 'in kind'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=specie&searchmode=phrase |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref> == Functions == {{Economics sidebar}} In the past, money was generally considered to have the following four main functions, which are summed up in a [[rhyme]] found in older economics textbooks: "Money is a matter of functions four, a [[medium]], a [[measure]], a standard, a store." That is, money functions as a [[medium of exchange]], a [[unit of account]], a [[standard of deferred payment]], and a [[store of value]].<ref name="greco"/> However, most modern textbooks now list only three functions, that of [[medium of exchange]], [[unit of account]], and [[store of value]], not considering a standard of deferred payment as a distinguished function, but rather subsuming it in the others.<ref name="mankiw"/><ref name="krugman">Krugman, Paul & Wells, Robin, ''Economics'', Worth Publishers, New York (2006)</ref><ref name="abel_bernanke">{{cite book|last=Abel |first=Andrew |last2=Bernanke |first2=Ben |authorlink2=Ben Bernanke |title=Macroeconomics |publisher=Pearson |year=2005 |edition=5th |pages=266–269 |chapter=7|isbn=0201327899}}</ref> There have been many historical disputes regarding the combination of money's functions, some arguing that they need more separation and that a single unit is insufficient to deal with them all. One of these arguments is that the role of money as a [[medium of exchange]] is in conflict with its role as a [[store of value]]: its role as a store of value requires holding it without spending, whereas its role as a medium of exchange requires it to circulate.<ref name="greco" /> Others argue that storing of value is just deferral of the exchange, but does not diminish the fact that money is a medium of exchange that can be transported both across space and time.<ref>[http://www.econlib.org/library/Mises/msT.html ''Theory of Money and Credit'']– Library of Economics and Liberty</ref> The term 'financial capital' is a more general and inclusive term for all liquid instruments, whether or not they are a uniformly recognized tender. === Medium of exchange === {{Main|Medium of exchange}} When money is used to intermediate the exchange of goods and services, it is performing a function as a ''medium of exchange''. It thereby avoids the inefficiencies of a barter system, such as the '[[double coincidence of wants]]' problem. === Unit of account === {{Main|Unit of account}} A ''unit of account'' is a standard numerical unit of measurement of the market value of goods, services, and other transactions. Also known as a "measure" or "standard" of relative worth and deferred payment, a unit of account is a necessary prerequisite for the formulation of commercial agreements that involve debt. To function as a 'unit of account', whatever
