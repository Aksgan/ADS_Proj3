2004: "ITU-T Rec. X.906|ISO/IEC 19793: Information technology - Open distributed processing - Use of UML for ODP system specifications". This document (usually referred to as [http://www.rm-odp.net/files/resources/LON-040_UML4ODP_IS/LON-040_UML4ODP_IS.pdf UML4ODP]) defines use of the [[Unified Modeling Language]] 2 (UML 2; ISO/IEC 19505), for expressing the specifications of open distributed systems in terms of the viewpoint specifications defined by the RM-ODP. It defines a set of [[Profile (UML)|UML Profiles]], one for each viewpoint language and one to express the correspondences between viewpoints, and an approach for structuring them according to the RM-ODP principles. The purpose of "UML4ODP" to allow ODP modelers to use the UML notation for expressing their ODP specifications in a standard graphical way; to allow UML modelers to use the RM-ODP concepts and mechanisms to structure their large UML system specifications according to a mature and standard proposal; and to allow UML tools to be used to process viewpoint specifications, thus facilitating the software design process and the [[enterprise architecture]] specification of large software systems. In addition, ITU-T Rec. X.906 | ISO/IEC 19793 enables the seamless integration of the RM-ODP [[enterprise architecture framework]] with the [[Model-driven architecture|Model-Driven Architecture (MDA]] initiative from the OMG, and with the [[Service-orientation|service-oriented architecture (SOA)]]. == Applications == In addition, there are several projects that have used or currently use RM-ODP for effectively structuring their systems specifications: * The COMBINE project<ref>[http://www.opengroup.org/combine/overview.htm COMBINE]</ref> * The Reference Architecture for Space Data Systems (RASDS)<ref>[http://public.ccsds.org/review/default.aspx Reference Architecture for Space Data Systems (RASDS)]</ref> From the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems. * Interoperability Technology Association for Information Processing (INTAP), Japan.<ref>[http://www.net.intap.or.jp/e Interoperability Technology Association for Information Processing (INTAP)]</ref> * The Synapses European project.<ref>[http://www.cs.tcd.ie/synapses/public/ The Synapses Project: a three-year project funded under the EU 4th Framework Health Telematics Programme]</ref> == See also == * [[Enterprise Architecture framework]] * [[Enterprise Collaboration Architecture]] * [[Enterprise Modelling Methodology/Open Distributed Processing]] (EMM/ODP) * [[Reference model]] * [[Triune Continuum Paradigm]] * [[View model]] == Notes and references == {{reflist}} == External links == * [http://www.rm-odp.net/ RM-ODP Resource site] * [http://www.joaquin.net/ODP/ Open Distributed Processing - Reference Model] * [http://lamswww.epfl.ch/reference/rm-odp RM-ODP information at LAMS], Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland. * [http://www.ansa.co.uk/ Official Record of the ANSA project] * [http://www.cs.ukc.ac.uk/ Computing Laboratory], University of Kent, Canterbury UK. * [http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~kjt/research/formosa.html FORMOSA] (Formalisation of ODP Systems Architecture), University of Stirling, UK. * [http://www-src.lip6.fr/ Systèmes Répartis et Coopératifs], UMPC, Paris, France. * [http://www.infres.enst.fr/recherche/ILR/rapport.html ILR], Networks and ComputerScience Department of ENST, Paris France. * [http://archive.dstc.edu.au/AU/research_news/ Distributed Systems Technology Center], Australia.

The RNS system uses the method of [[vagus nerve stimulation]] via a [[brain pacemaker]] and a [[neurostimulator]]. The neurostimulator is a device that is implanted within the skull by a study physician. The device is powered by a battery and contains a [[computer chip]] that detects and stores a record of the brain’s electrical activity. When the device identifies seizure activity, it attempts to suppress the seizure by sending electrical stimulation through the leads to a small part of the brain. This type of treatment is called ''responsive stimulation''. The study physician has a programmer device while the patient has a data transmitter to provide information from his or her neurostimulator to the study physician. The physician-operated programmer communicates with the RNS neurostimulator via a hand-held wand. The study physician uses the programmer to look at information stored in the device about the patient’s detections and stimulations. The study physician can also look at records of actual brain electrical activity. This information helps the study physician select the best detection and stimulation settings for a particular patient. The programmer is then used to program the detection and stimulation settings in the neurostimulator. The data transmitter (or DTR) is used by the patient to provide information to the study physician. Patients use a wand to transfer information from the neurostimulator to the DTR. Patients then connect the DTR to a phone line and information is provided to his or her study physician via a protected website. The study physician is then able to view the response to the stimulation and decide on the best seizure detection and stimulation settings for the patient. The system is implanted by a study physician during a two- to five-hour procedure that occurs while the patient is asleep. Two to four leads are placed in the brain where the seizures start. Then the neurostimulator is placed in the skull. After the procedure, the patient will typically stay in the hospital one to three days. The RNS system is currently being evaluated to determine how well it can reduce the frequency of uncontrolled seizures. The treatment is being studied for people with epilepsy
