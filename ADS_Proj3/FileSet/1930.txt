the ideology of "liberty" inherent in written documents at this time. There are varieties of ways in which history can be organized, including chronologically, [[culture|culturally]], territorially, and thematically. These divisions are not mutually exclusive, and significant overlaps are often present, as in "The International Women's Movement in an Age of Transition, 1830–1975." It is possible for historians to concern themselves with both the very specific and the very general, although the modern trend has been toward specialization. The area called [[Big History]] resists this specialization, and searches for universal patterns or trends. History has often been studied with some practical or [[theory|theoretical]] aim, but also may be studied out of simple intellectual curiosity.<ref name="graham-ch1">{{cite book |title=The Shape of the Past |author=Graham, Gordon |publisher=[[Oxford University]] |year=1997 |chapter=Chapter 1}}</ref> ==History and prehistory== {{Human history and prehistory|222}} {{See|Protohistory}} The [[history of the world]] is the memory of the past [[experience]] of ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]'' around the world, as that experience has been preserved, largely in written records. By "prehistory", historians mean the recovery of knowledge of the past in an area where no written records exist, or where the writing of a culture is not understood. [[Human history]] is marked both by a gradual [[List of discoveries|accretion of discoveries]] and [[Timeline of historic inventions|inventions]], as well as by [[quantum leap]]s — [[paradigm shift]]s, [[revolution]]s — that comprise epochs in the material and spiritual evolution of humankind. By studying painting, drawings, carvings, and other artifacts, some information can be recovered even in the absence of a written record. Since the 20th century, the study of prehistory is considered essential to avoid history's implicit exclusion of certain civilizations, such as those of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[pre-Columbian]] America. Historians in the West have been criticized for focusing disproportionately on the [[Western world]].<ref>[[Jack Goody]] (2007) ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=jo1UVi48KywC&pg=RA2-PA1930&dq=Jack+Goody+2007&sig=g0N7ZF9nz_Uy8nrQTiGdsc0N3sI#PPA12,M1 The Theft of History]'' (from [[Google Books]])</ref> In 1961, British historian [[E. H. Carr]] wrote: {{quote|The line of demarcation between prehistoric and historical times is crossed when people cease to live only in the present, and become consciously interested both in their past and in their future. History begins with the handing down of tradition; and tradition means the carrying of the habits and lessons of the past into the future. Records of the past begin to be kept for the benefit of future generations.<ref>Carr, Edward H. (1961). ''What is History?'', p.108, ISBN 0140206523</ref>}} This definition includes within the scope of history the strong interests of peoples, such as [[Australian Aboriginals]] and New Zealand [[Māori]] in the past, and the oral records maintained and transmitted to succeeding generations, even before their contact with European civilization. ==Historiography== {{Main|Historiography}} Historiography has a number of related meanings. Firstly, it can refer to how history has been produced: the story of the development of [[Historical method|methodology]] and practices (for example, the move from short-term biographical narrative towards long-term thematic analysis). Secondly, it can refer to what has been produced: a specific body of historical writing (for example, "medieval historiography during the 1960s" means "Works of medieval history written during the 1960s"). Thirdly, it may refer to why history is produced: the [[Philosophy of history]]. As a [[meta-level]] analysis of descriptions of the past, this third conception can relate to the first two in that the analysis usually focuses on the narratives, [[Language interpretation|interpretation]]s, [[worldview]], use of [[evidence]], or method of presentation of other [[historian]]s. Professional historians also debate the question of whether history can be taught as a single coherent narrative or a series of competing narratives. ==Philosophy of history== {| class="toccolours" style="float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em; width:222px; text-align:left; clear:right;" |<div style="background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;"> History's philosophical questions </div> * What is the proper unit for the study of the human past — the individual?

Is human history random and devoid of any meaning? |} {{Main|Philosophy of history}} Philosophy of history is an area of [[philosophy]] concerning the eventual significance, if any, of [[human history]]. Furthermore, it speculates as to a possible [[teleology|teleological]] end to its development—that is, it asks if there is a design, purpose, directive principle, or finality in the processes of human history. Philosophy of history should not be confused with historiography, which is the study of history as an academic discipline, and thus concerns its methods and practices, and its development as a discipline over time. Nor should philosophy of history be confused with the [[history of philosophy]], which is the study of the development of philosophical ideas through time. Professional historians debate the question of whether history is a science or a liberal art. The distinction is artificial, as many view the field from more than one perspective.<ref>Elizabeth Harris, In Defense of the Liberal-Arts Approach to Technical Writing. College English, Vol. 44, No. 6 (Oct., 1982), pp. 628-636</ref> Recent argument in support for the transformation of history into science have been made by [[Peter Turchin]] in an article titled "Arise [[Cliodynamics]]" in the journal ''Nature''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Nature |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v454/n7200/full/454034a.html |title=Arise Cliodynamics.
