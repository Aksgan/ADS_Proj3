<math>t</math> for a single photon sources, where <math>t</math> is the transmittance of the quantum channel). There are several solutions to this problem. The most obvious is to use a true single photon source instead of an attenuated laser. While such sources are still at a developmental stage QKD has been carried out successfully with them.<ref>P. M. Intallura, , M. B. Ward, O. Z. Karimov, Z. L. Yuan, P. See, A. J. Shields, P. Atkinson, and D. A. Ritchie, Appl. 43 Phys. Lett. 91, 161103 (2007)</ref> However as current sources operate at a low efficiency and frequency key rates and transmission distances are limited. Another solution is to modify the BB84 protocol, as is done for example in the [[SARG04]] protocol,<ref>V. Scarani, A. Ac´ın, G. Ribordy and N. Gisin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 057901 (2004)</ref> in which the secure key rate scales as <math>t^{3/2}</math>. The most promising solution is the decoy state idea,<ref>W.-Y. Hwang, Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 057901 (2003)</ref> in which Alice randomly sends some of her laser pulses with a lower average photon number. These decoy states can be used to detect a PNS attack, as Eve has no way to tell which pulses are signal and which decoy. Using this idea the secure key rate scales as <math>t</math>, the same as for a single photon source. This idea has been implemented successfully first at University of Toronto,<ref>Y.Zhao, B. Qi, X. Ma, H.-K. Lo, and L. Qian, Phys. Rev. Lett., 96, 070502 (2006).</ref><ref>Y.Zhao, B. Qi, X. Ma, H.-K. Lo, and L. Qian, in Proc. IEEE ISIT, pp. 2094--2098 (2006).</ref> and in several follow-up QKD experiments,<ref>Z. L. Yuan, A. W. Sharpe, and A. J. Shields, Appl. Phys. Lett. 90, 011118 (2007)</ref> allowing for high key rates secure against all known attacks. === Hacking attacks === Hacking attacks target imperfections in the implementation of the protocol or deficiencies in the components of the physical device. If the equipment used in quantum key distribution can be tampered with, it could be made to generate keys that were not secure using a [[random number generator attack]]. Another common class of attacks is the [[Trojan horse]] attack<ref>Vakhitov, A. V. Makarov and D. R. Hjelme, J. Mod. Opt. 48, 2023 (2001)</ref> which does not require physical access to the endpoints: rather than attempt to read Alice and Bob's single photons, Mallory sends a large pulse of light back to Alice in between transmitted photons. Alice's equipment reflects some of Mallory's light, revealing the state of Alice's polarizer. This attack is easy to avoid, for example using an optical isolator to prevent light from entering Alice's system, and all other hacking attacks can similarly be defeated by modifying the implementation. Apart from Trojan horse there are several other known attacks including faked-state attacks,<ref>V. Makarov and D. R. Hjelme, J. Mod. Opt. 52, 691. (2005)</ref> phase remapping attacks<ref>C.-H. F. Fung, B. Qi, K. Tamaki, and H.-K. Lo, Phys. Rev. A 75, 032314. (2007)</ref> and time-shift attacks.<ref>B. Qi, C.-H. F. Fung, H.-K. Lo, and X. Ma, Quant. Info. Compu. 7, 43 (2007)</ref> The time-shift attack has even been successfully demonstrated on a commercial quantum crypto-system.<ref>Y. Zhao, C.-H. F. Fung, B. Qi, C. Chen, and H.-K. Lo, Phys. Rev. A 78:042333 (2008)</ref> This is the first successful demonstration of quantum hacking against a non-homemade quantum key distribution system. On May 18, 2010, "The Register" published news of what was claimed as the first successful attack against a commercial system based on quantum key distribution (made and sold by the Swiss company [[Id Quantique]]), exploiting the fact that these systems accept an error rate of less than 20% during quantum key exchange.<ref>[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/05/18/quantum_crypto_attack/ Quantum crypto boffins in successful backdoor sniff - Erroneous error-handling undermines bulletproofness] retrieved 2010-05-26</ref>. Later on, the company denounced this claim and made clear that the commercially-deployed versions of their devices abort the key distribution at around 10 per cent error only. In a new (and what turned out to be actually, even an earlier) claim<ref>L. Lydersen, C. Wiechers, C. Wittmann, D. Elser, J. Skaar and V. Makarov, Nat. Photonics 4, 686 (2010)</ref>, it has now been shown (experimentally) that the detectors of two commercial devices could be fully remote-controlled using specially tailored bright illumination, which makes it possible to tracelessly acquire the full secret key. In a spree of publications<ref>C. Wiechers, L. Lydersen, C.Wittmann, D. Elser, J. Skaar, Ch. Marquardt, V. Makarov and G. Leuchs, arXiv:1009.2683 (2010)</ref>,<ref>L. Lydersen, C. Wiechers, C. Wittmann, D. Elser, J. Skaar and V. Makarov, Opt. Exp. 18, 27938 (2010)</ref> thereafter, this collaboration between the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]] in Norway and [[Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light]] in Germany, has now demonstrated several methods to eavesdrop on commercial QKD systems based on [[Avalanche photodiodes]] (APDs) operating in gated mode. === Denial of service === Because currently a dedicated fibre optic line (or line of sight in free space) is required between the two points linked by quantum key distribution, a [[denial of service attack]] can be mounted by simply cutting or blocking the line. This is one of the motivations for the development of [[quantum network|quantum key distribution networks]], which would route communication via alternate links in case of disruption. == History == Quantum cryptography was proposed first by [[Stephen Wiesner]], then at Columbia University in New York, who, in the early 1970s, introduced the concept of quantum conjugate coding. His seminal paper titled "Conjugate Coding" was rejected by IEEE Information Theory but was eventually published in 1983 in SIGACT News (15:1 pp. 78–88, 1983). In this paper he showed how to store or transmit two messages by encoding them in two “conjugate observables”, such as linear and circular polarization of light, so that either, but not both, of which may be received and decoded. He illustrated his idea with a design of unforgeable bank notes. A decade later, building upon this work, [[Charles H. Bennett (computer scientist)|Charles H. Bennett]], of the IBM [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center]], and [[Gilles Brassard]], of the Université de Montréal, proposed a
