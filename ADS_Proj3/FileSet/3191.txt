Nomad provided an interactive environment for [[data management]] and application development, including commands for database definition, data manipulation, and reporting. All components were accessible by and integrated through a database-oriented programming language. Unlike many data management tools of the day, which were geared to the needs of professional programmers in MIS departments, Nomad was particularly designed for (and sold to) application end-users in large corporations. ==Capabilities== Nomad was distinguished by four characteristics: *An intuitive database-oriented [[Fourth-generation programming language|4GL]] for creating databases, managing data, and writing applications *An interactive environment in which any [[Fourth-generation programming language|4GL]] statement could be typed and immediately processed (comparable to modern interactive tools like PHP or Perl) *[[Relational database]] features, supporting lookup tables and the other elements of a [[database normalization|normalized]] relational database *Powerful set-at-a-time operations under the control
