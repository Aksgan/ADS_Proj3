On the website of the Global Times (www.huanqiu.com) such examples are found, one user wrote "''Get the hell out''" while another one wrote "''Ha ha, I'm going to buy firecrackers to celebrate!''".<ref name="reuters" /> According to [[Isaac Mao]], a high profile Chinese Internet expert, maybe 90% of [[Internet in the People's Republic of China|Internet users in China]] don't care whether Google leaves or not.

However, one of Google's responses to concerns about privacy laws outside the United States has been a pledge to blur the faces of people who are filmed on Street View photos taken both inside and outside the U.S. Google began blurring faces on May 13, 2008<ref>{{cite web|last=Shankland |first=Stephen |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9943140-7.html |title=Google begins blurring faces in Street View |publisher=News.cnet.com |date= |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}</ref> and the images published since then, including the first launch of images in Europe on July 2, 2008, have all used face blurring (this process is automated; as a result even facial images on posters and billboards are often blurred).
