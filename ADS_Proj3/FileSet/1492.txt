The flexibility of friction ridge skin means that no two finger or palm prints are ever ''exactly'' alike in every detail; even two impressions recorded immediately after each other from the same hand. Fingerprint identification, also referred to as individualization, involves an expert, or an [[expert system|expert computer system]] operating under [[Adaptive thresholding|threshold scoring]] rules, determining whether two friction ridge impressions are likely to have originated from the same finger or palm (or toe or sole). An intentional recording of friction ridges is usually made with black printer's [[ink]] rolled across a contrasting white background, typically a white card. Friction ridges can also be recorded digitally using a technique called [[Live Scan]]. A "latent print" is the chance recording of friction ridges deposited on the surface of an object or a wall. Latent prints are invisible to the naked eye, whereas "patent prints" or "plastic prints" are viewable with the un-aided eye. Latent prints are often fragmentary and require chemical methods, [[fingerprint powder|powder]], or alternative light sources in order to be made clear. Sometimes an ordinary bright flashlight will make a latent print visible. When friction ridges come into contact with a surface that will take a print, material that is on the friction ridges such as [[perspiration]], oil, grease, ink or blood, will be transferred to the surface. Factors which affect the quality of friction ridge impressions are numerous. Pliability of the skin, deposition pressure, slippage, the material from which the surface is made, the roughness of the surface and the substance deposited are just some of the various factors which can cause a latent print to appear differently from any known recording of the same friction ridges. Indeed, the conditions surrounding every instance of friction ridge deposition are unique and never duplicated. For these reasons, fingerprint examiners are required to undergo extensive training. ===Fingerprint types=== ====Exemplar prints==== Exemplar prints, or known prints, is the name given to fingerprints deliberately collected from a subject, whether for purposes of enrollment in a system or when under arrest for a suspected criminal offense. During criminal arrests, a set of exemplar prints will normally include one print taken from each finger that has been rolled from one edge of the nail to the other, plain (or slap) impressions of each of the four fingers of each hand, and plain impressions of each thumb. Exemplar prints can be collected using [[Live Scan]] or by using ink on paper cards. ====Latent prints==== Although the word latent means hidden or invisible, in modern usage for [[forensic science]] the term latent prints means any chance or accidental impression left by friction ridge skin on a surface, regardless of whether it is visible or invisible at the time of deposition. Electronic, chemical and physical processing techniques permit visualization of invisible latent print residues whether they are from natural sweat on the skin or from a contaminant such as motor oil, blood, ink, paint or some other form of dirt. The different types of fingerprint patterns, such as arch, loop and whorl, will be described below. Latent prints may exhibit only a small portion of the surface of a finger and this may be smudged, distorted, overlapped by other prints from the same or from different individuals, or any or all of these in combination. For this reason, latent prints usually present an “inevitable source of error in making comparisons,” as they generally “contain less clarity, less content, and less undistorted information than a fingerprint taken under controlled conditions, and much, much less detail compared to the actual patterns of ridges and grooves of a finger.”<ref name=zabell>{{Cite journal | url = http://wwy.brooklaw.edu/students/journals/bjlp/jlp13i_zabell.pdf | last = Zabell | first = Sandy | title = Fingerprint Evidence | journal = Journal of Law and Policy }}</ref> ====Patent prints==== Patent prints are chance friction ridge impressions which are obvious to the human eye and which have been caused by the transfer of foreign material from a finger onto a surface. Some obvious examples would be impressions from flour and wet clay. Because they are already visible and have no need of enhancement they are generally photographed rather than being lifted in the way that latent prints are. An attempt to preserve the actual print is always made for later presentation in court, and there are many techniques used to do this. Patent prints can be left on a surface by materials such as ink, dirt,
