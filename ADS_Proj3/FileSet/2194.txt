These include a [[dialogue]] section for the [[personification]] of things, a "depth dimension" to aid in accessing the [[subconscious]] and other places for recording remembrances and meditations. The original Intensive Journal contained only sixteen sections, but was later expanded to include five additional sections as part of Progoff's "process meditation" method. It has been the inspiration for many other "writing therapies" since then, and is used in a variety of settings, including [[hospital]]s and [[prison]]s, by private individuals as an aid to [[creativity]] or [[autobiography]], and often as an adjunct to treatment in [[analytical psychology|analytic]], [[humanistic psychology|humanistic]] or [[cognitive therapy]]. The Intensive Journal Method is a registered trademark of Dr. Progoff and used under license by Dialogue House Associates, Inc of New York, who train facilitators and consultants in the use of the method and coordinate an ongoing series of public workshops using the method throughout the United States and elsewhere. == References == *''At a Journal Workshop'' by Ira Progoff, 1975. *''The Practice of Process Meditation'' by Ira Progoff, 1980. *''At a Journal Workshop: Writing to Access the Power of the Unconscious and Evoke Creative Ability'' by Ira Progoff, 1992.

It is most commonly used in the fields of [[multicast]]ing and [[routing]] between [[internet]]s, or as a substitute for the term [[inter-server]]. The term is also occasionally used in [[chemistry]], for example with regard to [[protein domains]]. Internet [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]]s that are focused on inter-domain functions include: [[Border Gateway Multicast Protocol]], [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]], [[Multicast Source Discovery Protocol]], and [[Protocol Independent Multicast]]. The opposite of inter-domain routing is ''intra-domain routing'': Routing ''within'' a domain or an [[autonomous system (Internet)|autonomous system]]. == See also == * [[List of routing protocols]].

Processes may be running on one or more computers connected by a [[computer network|network]]. IPC techniques are divided into methods for [[message passing]], [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronization]], [[shared memory]], and [[remote procedure call]]s (RPC). The method of IPC used may vary based on the bandwidth and latency of communication between the threads, and the type of data being communicated. There are several reasons for providing an environment that allows process cooperation: *Information sharing * speedup; *Modularity; *Convenience; and *[[Privilege separation]]. IPC may also be referred to as ''inter-thread communication'' and ''inter-application communication.'' The combination of IPC with the [[address space]] concept is the foundation for address space independence/isolation.<ref> [[Jochen Liedtke]].
