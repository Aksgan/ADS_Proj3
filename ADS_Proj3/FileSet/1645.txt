Initially, Veasey was the only administrator and therefore had full control over the boards; however, more administrators have since been appointed. Tyner, who uses the username "SBAllen" (formerly "Sailor Bacon"), is an administrator on the boards.<ref name="about"/> GameFAQs' moderators are volunteer users selected by the administrator and are responsible for keeping order within the message board community. Because of the size of the boards, the moderators do not patrol every board and topic. Instead, messages that break the site's [[Terms of Service]] can be "[[moderation system|marked]]" by regular users, which brings the message to the attention of the moderators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/help/?cat=19|title=Rules and Standards|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref> ==FAQs== All of the guides and walkthroughs on GameFAQs are contributed by volunteers.<ref>Mary-Kate and Ashley: Winner's Circle; ''[[The Times]]'' ([[London]]); July 1, 2001; Stuart Andrews; p. Doors.2 "Guides to completing thousands of video games, compiled by gamers worldwide"</ref> Most of the FAQs are not actually lists of [[FAQ|frequently asked questions]]; instead, they cover aspects of gameplay in the same way as [[strategy guide]]s, with walkthroughs, item lists, maps, and puzzle solutions. Nearly all of the FAQs hosted on the site are in [[plain text]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/help/?cat=28|title=Composing Your Guide|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2006-10-26}}</ref> though GameFAQs does also accept stand-alone images, such as maps, diagrams and puzzle solutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/help/?cat=11|title=Images (Maps and other graphics)|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2007-01-01}}</ref> From December 2009, formatted guides which allow authors to use mark-up loosely based on [[Wiki markup]] in the document were being accepted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/genmessage.php?board=11&topic=52525167|title=Ask GameFAQs: A new approach to FAQs|publisher=GameFAQs|author=Tyner, Allen|date=2009-12-04|accessdate=2009-12-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/help/?cat=53|title=GameFAQs Help: Formatted FAQs|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref> In addition to FAQs, contributors can also submit reader reviews, cheat codes, developer credits, game release data, game saves, [[screenshot]]s, and images of [[video game packaging|game boxes]].

GameFAQs agrees to host the guide only on their servers but does allow other affiliates to link directly to the guides (including [[GameSpot]], [[Yahoo!
