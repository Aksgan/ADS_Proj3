First, the ''process'' of risk management is an ongoing iterative [[Business process|process]]. It must be repeated indefinitely. The business environment is constantly changing and new [[threat (computer)|threats]] and [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]] emerge every day. Second, the choice of [[countermeasure (computer)]]s ([[security controls|controls]]) used to manage risks must strike a balance between productivity, cost, effectiveness of the countermeasure, and the value of the informational asset being protected. ''[[Risk management]] is the process that allows IT managers to balance the operational and economic costs of protective measures and achieve gains in mission capability by protecting the IT systems and data that support their organizations’ missions. This process is not unique to the IT environment; indeed it pervades decision-making in all areas of our daily lives''.<ref name=SP80030/> The head of an organizational unit must ensure that the organization has the capabilities needed to accomplish its mission. These mission owners must determine the security capabilities that their IT systems must have to provide the desired level of mission support in the face of real world [[threat (computer)|threat]]s. Most organizations have tight budgets for IT security; therefore, IT security spending must be reviewed as thoroughly as other management decisions. A well-structured risk management methodology, when used effectively, can help management identify appropriate [[security controls|controls]] for providing the mission-essential security capabilities.<ref name=SP80030/> Risk management in the IT world is quite a complex, multi faced activity, with a lot of relations with other complex activities. The picture show the relationships between different related terms.
