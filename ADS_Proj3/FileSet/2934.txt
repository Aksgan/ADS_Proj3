With this [[e-learning]] tool, devices like miniaturized [[calculator]]s, [[microcontroller]], [[Central processing unit|microprocessors]], and [[computer technology|computer]] can be explained didactically on own-developed [[Instruction (computer science)|instruction code]] on [[register transfer level]], which are controlled by program sequences of micro [[instruction]]s ([[microcode]]). Based on this, on higher level of abstraction it is possible to develop an [[instruction set]] being able to control a virtual application board. == General == Initially, MikroSim was developed with the intention to be a processor simulation software, which is available manifold in educational areas. Since MikroSim operability starts on the basis of microcode development defined as a sequence of micro instructions (microcoding) for a virtual [[control unit]], the software’s intention is on first approach a microcode simulator with various levels of abstractions including the ability of CPU simulators and instruction set emulators. In the current software revision, even a microcode controlled virtual application is feasible to operate on own coded instruction sets. With MikroSim typical and well known concepts in the area of [[computer engineering]] like [[computer architecture]] and [[instruction set architecture]] are unspecifically treated, which have been established since the early days of the information era and being still valid. In this fashion the simulation software gains a timeless, free didactical benefit without being restricted on special developments of the past and in the future. The detailed documentation and the bilingual application’s graphical user interface ([[GUI]]) in German and English, as well as the software’s upward compatibility given to some extend by MicroSoft’s operating system Windows, are reasons for being a well established valuable e-learning tool in field of computer engineering since 1992 for educational use. == History of development == The software bases on a revision written under Turbo-Pascal compiled for [[MS-DOS]] operating systems, which has been used for educational use in computer engineering and [[computer science]] at the [[University of Marburg|Philipps-University Marburg (Germany)]] until 1992. The didactical concept has been picked up by Martin Perner during his study of physics (1990–1995) in summer 1992, revised and converted into a windows application compiled with Microsoft [[Visual Basic]] and running on [[Windows 3.1x]]. In doing so, at this time a simulator with huge conceptual improvements arose by exploiting the novel functionality and utilisation of Windows’ GUI for supporting the composition of microcode and the traceability of its instructional influence. The enhancements of the e-learning tool under Windows has been supported and promoted by the Fachbereich Mathematik/Informatik of the University of Marburg by Heinz-Peter Gumm until end 1995. The Simulator has been awarded with the ‘’European Academic Software Award 1994’’ in the category computer science in Heidelberg (Germany) in November 1994. In March 1995 the simulator has been presented at the computer exhibition [[CeBIT]]’95 in Hannover at the stand of the ‘’Hessischen Hochschulen’’. Between 1995 until the year 2000 the simulator has been published as ‘’Mikrocodesimulator MikroSim 1.2’’ without any significant improvements. At this time the tool has been awarded by the European Union in the context of the ‘’European Year of Livelong Learning 1996’’ with 1000 ECU. In 1997, the software has been presented at the contest ‘’Multimedia Transfer’97’’ in connection to the exhibition ‘’LearnTec’97’’.<ref>[http://www.mikrocodesimulator.de/index_eng.php#PreiseAuszeichnungen Awards and Honours] on MikroSim’s Website (Retrieved 5. December 2010.)</ref> In its penultimate revision, the simulator has been published under ‘’Mikrocodesimulator MikroSim2000’’, optimized for [[Windows95]]’s 32-bit operation.<br /> Between 2008 and 2009, the simulator concept has been revised, reworked, and thoughtful extended. So it has received wide ranging improvements and extensions without touching the successful conceptual aspects of the microcode simulation abilities in the core. For this purpose, advantage is taken of today’s computing system’s performance determined by operating system and
