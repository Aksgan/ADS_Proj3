Since then, Microsoft has unveiled its next generation mobile platform, [[Windows Phone 7]]. Microsoft plans on being more aggressive with mobile Xbox Live-connected games by strictly controlling the phone hardware that Windows Phone 7 runs on, and enabling [[DirectX]] 9 graphics for Windows Phone 7, the same version of Direct X that the Xbox 360 uses. Live Gamertags are also used for the [[Microsoft XNA|XNA]] Creator's Club service. ==Features== *Single identity ([[Gamertag]]/Zune Tag) across all platforms (tied to [[Windows Live ID]]) *Cross-platform chat, with both text and voice *Unified friends list and message system *Single, worldwide currency for purchasing virtual games, music, videos and content ([[Microsoft Points]]) *Cross-platform multiplayer online gaming, including game invites ==Pricing== Live is available in two tiers: Silver and Gold. Anybody who signs up to Live is given a Silver account, which offers a basic set of features that differ with each platform. Gold accounts require a subscription, but offer a greater variety of features. {| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="2" style="border-collapse: collapse;" !Country !1 Month !3 Months !12 Months !Games for Windows – Live !Zune Social |- |'''[[Europe]]''' |[[Euro|€]]6.99 |[[Euro|€]]19.99 |[[Euro|€]]59.99 |Free |Free |- |'''[[United Kingdom]]''' |[[Pound sterling|£]]4.99 |[[Pound sterling|£]]14.99 |[[Pound sterling|£]]39.99 |Free |Free |- |'''[[Australia]]''' |[[Australian dollar|$]]10.95 |[[Australian dollar|$]]29.95 |[[Australian dollar|$]]79.95 |Free |Free |- |'''[[Sweden]]''' |[[Swedish krona|kr]]60 |[[Swedish krona|kr]]179 |[[Swedish krona|kr]]549 |Free |Free |- |'''[[USA]]''' |[[United States dollar|$]]9.99 |[[United States dollar|$]]24.99 |[[United States dollar|$]]59.99 |Free |Free |- |'''[[Japan]]''' |[[Japanese yen|¥]]819 |[[Japanese yen|¥]]2079 |[[Japanese yen|¥]]5229 |Free |Free |} The original [[Xbox]] does not recognize Silver accounts, requiring Gold for all Live features.

Perhaps one of the most famous examples of this is the [[Christmas Truce]] of 1914. It is a process that can be characterised as the deliberate abstaining from the use of violence during war. Sometimes it can take the form of overt truces or pacts negotiated locally by soldiers. At other times it can be a tacit behaviour—sometimes characterised as "letting sleeping dogs lie"—whereby both sides refrain from firing or using their weapons, or deliberately discharge them in a ritualistic or routine way that signals their non-lethal intent. This behaviour was found at the small-unit level, sections, platoons or companies, usually observed by the "other ranks" e.g. privates and non-commissioned officers. Examples were found from the lone soldier standing sentry duty, refusing to fire on exposed enemy soldiers, up to snipers, machine-guns teams and even field-artillery batteries. Tony Ashworth in his book ''Trench Warfare 1914–1918: The Live and Let Live System'' researched this topic based upon diaries, letters, and testimonies of veterans from the war. He discovered that 'live and let live' was widely known about, at the time, and was common usually at specific times and places. It was often to be found when a unit had been withdrawn from battle and was sent to a rest sector. During the [[First World War]], 1914–1918, the Higher Commands, Division, Corps and Army Commanders and their staffs were aware of this un-aggressive behaviour, and in some cases used to analyse casualty statistics to detect it. As a counter, raids or patrols were often ordered to foster the correct "offensive spirit" in the troops. The ''Live and Let Live'' system was fragile at best and was thus easily broken by the use of lethal force. ==Game Theory== Some [[game theory]] theorists, like [[Robert Axelrod]], have characterised ''Live and Let Live'' as an iterated variant of the [[Prisoner's Dilemma]]. Axelrod linked ''Live and Let Live'' to the co-operative strategy referred to as [[Tit for Tat]]. ==See also== * [[Christmas Truce]] ==Further reading== *Ashworth, Tony ''Trench Warfare 1914–1918: The Live and Let Live System'' (1980).
