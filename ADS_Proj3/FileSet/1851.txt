February 2011, as originally proposed, but a small number (currently 19) of the 200 staff will remain until March 2013 in a sub-office of Croydon, operating out of Portsmouth City Council premises. Head Office will move out of its famous Lincoln's Inn Fields building by March 2011 and be housed instead in the Croydon office. The building has been purchased by the [[London School of Economics]] for a sum of £37.5 million. The early part of 2011 will also see the Plymouth office being relocated to the Information Systems office in Seaton Court, thus allowing the older Plumer House building to be sold. == Structure == Each local office has an area manager, a land registrar who is the senior lawyer in the office, and a customer services manager. Each office also has a team of staff responsible for processing applications lodged by members of the legal profession and the general public. The organisation is headed by the Chief Land Registrar and Chief Executive. With the largest property database in [[Europe]], the Land Registry underpins the [[economy of the United Kingdom]] by guaranteeing the ownership of many billions of pounds worth of property. Around £1 million worth of property is processed every minute in England and Wales.<ref>http://www1.landregistry.gov.uk/strategy/10yearplan/ Land Registry website: 10 Year Plan, April 2007</ref> Since December 1990, the Land Register has been open to the public. For a fee anyone can inspect the Register, find out the name and address of the current owner of any registered property or obtain a copy of any registered title. This can also be done online. In 2004 the Land Registry was awarded the government's [[Charter Mark]] for a record fifth time, becoming only one of a handful of organisations to achieve this. The Land Registry has an Independent Complaints Reviewer. Disputed applications to the Land Registry are determined by the Adjudicator to HM Land Registry, an independent office created by the Land Registration Act 2002. Under previous legislation this function had been the responsibility of the Chief Land Registrar. The Land Registry has a recognised course on land registration law and its underpinning property law, the 'Qualification in Land Registration Law and Practice. It also covers the Land Registry's legal and plans practice. There are two levels: a one year certificate course at [[A level]] standard and a two-year diploma course at degree standard. ==History== In 1857 the Royal Commission on Registration of Title proposed a system of registration administered by a central registry in London with district offices. The Land Registration Act 1862 was introduced by the then [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Richard Bethell, 1st Baron Westbury]]. The Act provided for the registration of [[Freehold (English law)|Freehold]] estates in land. The system of registration adopted had its origins in a system that had been piloted in [[South Australia]] by that colony's then Prime Minister Sir [[Robert Torrens]]. [[Brent Spencer Follett]], the first Chief Land Registrar, opened the Land Registry's first offices, at 34 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London, on 15 October 1862. Mr Follett had a staff of just six people and was paid £2,500 a year. At first registration was not compulsory, and once property was registered there was no compulsion to register any subsequent transactions. Thus it was possible for the person registered as the owner of a property to cease to be the owner while remaining on the register. Following the Land Transfer Act 1875 there were seven further attempts to introduce Land Registration Acts, all of which failed. A report by Sir [[Charles Brickdale]] on the system of land registration used in Germany proved influential. In 1897 the then Lord Chancellor, [[Hardinge Giffard, 1st Earl of Halsbury]] introduced the [[Land Transfer Act 1897]], which brought an element of compulsion into the registration system. To satisfy the demands of the legal profession, the option of a county veto was offered. London County Council was attracted to the idea of compulsory registration and voted in favour of it in 1899. This led the Land Registry to expand. At this time the first female staff were employed and new technology, in the form of [[typewriter]]s, was introduced. In 1913 a new Land Registry headquarters was completed in Lincoln's Inn Fields. Two new pieces of land legislation were enacted in 1925: the Law of Property Act and the Land Registration Act. Government-initiated extensions to compulsory registration were suspended for ten years, but [[Eastbourne]] and [[Hastings]] voluntarily became areas of compulsory registration. In 1925 the government forecast that the whole of England and Wales would be subject to compulsory registration by 1955, but in fact the process was to take much longer. In 1940, after the 193rd air raid on Central London, the Land Registry was evacuated to the Marsham Court Hotel so that it could carry on its normal business. In 1950, 88 years after its creation, the Land Registry registered its one millionth title. The growth in property ownership after the war years meant that the potential number of properties to be registered increased dramatically. This in turn slowed down the rate of land registration. To deal with the increasing workload, an office was opened in Tunbridge Wells in 1955 and a further office at Lytham St. Annes in 1957. In 1963, 101 years after the registry started, it registered its two millionth title. Theodore Ruoff was appointed Chief Land Registrar in 1963, laid down the three fundamental principles of Land Registration: * The Mirror principle — the register of title should reflect, accurately and completely, and beyond all argument, the facts that are material to the title * The Curtain principle — the register should be the sole and definitive source of information for proposing purchasers * The Insurance principle — if, as a result of human error, the title is proved to be defective in any way, then the person or persons suffering loss as a result must be able to claim compensation New offices were opened in Gloucester (1964), Stevenage (1964), Durham (1965) and Harrow (1965).
