from an external scale; metal ones only from a scale marked on the inside. There are different types of measuring cups, such as glass or/and plastic The units may be millilitres or fractions of a litre, or (especially in the United States and Australia{{Fact|date=December 2007}}) the [[cup (unit)|cup]] and its fractions (typically 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, and 3/4), [[pint]]s, and sometimes fluid ounces. Sometimes multiples of [[teaspoon]]s and [[tablespoon]]s are included. There may also be scales for the approximate weight for particular substances, such as flour and sugar. There are eight ounces in one cup (American measurement). ==For dry measure== [[File:MeasuringCups2.JPG|thumb|right|A set of plastic measuring cups which usually include one full cup measure, half a cup and one third of a cup]] Many dry ingredients, such as granulated sugar, are not very [[compressibility|compressible]], so volume measures are consistent. Others, notably flour, are more variable. For example, 1 cup of all-purpose flour sifted into a cup and levelled weighs about 100 grams, whereas 1 cup of all-purpose flour scooped from its container and levelled weighs about 140 grams.<ref>Julia Child and Simone Beck, [[Mastering the Art of French Cooking]], vol. 2, p. 544.</ref> Using a measuring cup to measure bulk foods which can be compressed to a variable degree such as chopped vegetables or shredded cheese leads to large measurement uncertainties. It is easier to chop down the units for a better measure. == See also == *[[Cup (volume)]] ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Cooking utensils]] [[Category:Cooking weights and measures]] [[Category:Volumetric instruments]] [[Category:Units of volume]] [[de:Messbecher]] [[es:Jarra medidora]] [[fr:Verre doseur]] [[nl:Maatbeker]] [[ja:計量カップ]] [[simple:Measuring cup]] [[he:משורה]]</text> </page> <page> <id>23882</id> <title>Measuring network throughput</title> <text>{{Essay-like|date=January 2010}} People are often concerned about '''measuring the maximum data [[throughput]]''' rate of a communications link or network access. A typical method of performing a measurement is to transfer a 'large' file and measure the time taken to do so. The throughput is then calculated by dividing the file size by the time to get the throughput in [[megabit]]s, [[kilobit]]s, or [[bit]]s per second. Unfortunately, the results of such an exercise will result in the [[goodput]] which is less than the maximum throughput, leading to people believing that their communications link is not operating correctly. In fact, there are many overheads accounted for in goodput in addition to transmission overheads, including [[Latency (engineering)|latency]], [[Receive_Window#Window_size|TCP Receive Window size]] and machine limitations, which means the calculated goodput does not reflect the maximum achievable throughput. The Maximum bandwidth can be calculated as follows: <math> \mathrm{Throughput} \le \frac {\mathrm{RWIN}} {\mathrm{RTT}} \,\!</math> <!-- The \,\! is to keep the formula rendered as PNG instead of HTML. Please don't remove it. It matches the next formula. --> where RWIN is the TCP Receive Window and RTT is the [[Round-trip delay time|round-trip time]] for the path. The Max TCP Window size in the absence of [[TCP window scale option]] is 65,535 [[byte]]s. Example: Max Bandwidth = 65535 bytes / 0.220 s = 297886.36 bytes/s * 8 = 2.376 [[megabit|Mbit]]/s. We multiply the Byte per second times 8 to get the Bit per second rate. Over a single TCP connection between those endpoints, the tested Bandwidth will be restricted to 2.376 Mbit/s even if the contracted Bandwidth is greater. ==Bandwidth test software== Bandwidth test software is used to determine the maximum bandwidth of a [[computer network|network]] or [[internet]] connection. It is typically undertaken by attempting to download or upload the maximum amount of data in a certain period of time, or a certain amount of data in the minimum amount of time. For this reason, Bandwidth tests can delay internet transmissions through the internet connection as they are undertaken, and can cause inflated data charges. A more accurate method is to use dedicated software such as Netcps, [[IxChariot]], [[Iperf]], [[Ttcp]], [[netperf]] or [[bwping]] for measuring the maximum throughput of a network access. ==Nomenclature== {{bitrates}} The throughput of communications links is measured in bits per second (bit/s), kilobits per second (kbit/s), megabits per second (Mbit/s) and gigabits per second (Gbit/s). In this application, kilo, mega and giga are the standard [[SI|S.I.]] prefixes indicating multiplication by 1,000 ([[Kilo-|kilo]]), 1,000,000 ([[Mega-|mega]]), and 1,000,000,000 ([[giga]]). File sizes are typically measured in [[byte]]s &mdash; [[kilobyte]]s, [[megabyte]]s, and [[gigabyte]]s being usual, where a byte is eight bits. In modern textbooks one kilobyte is defined as 1,000 byte, one megabyte as 1,000,000 byte, etc., in accordance with the 1998 [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) standard. However, when Windows systems measure file size, the old computer science definition is still used, where 1 kilobyte is defined as 1,024 (or 2<sup>10</sup>) bytes, which should be denoted 1 [[kibibyte]] according to IEC terminology. Similarly, a file size of 1 megabyte is 1,024 × 1,024 byte (should be called 1 [[mebibyte]]), and 1 gigabyte 1,024 × 1,024 × 1,024 byte (should be called one [[gibibyte]]). The result of all this is that a file that according to the operational system consists of 64 kilobyte data contains 64 × 1024 bytes, or 64 × 1024 × 8 bits. ===Kibi, mebi, gibi, tebi, and pebi prefixes=== {{main|binary prefix}} Kibi, mebi, gibi, tebi, pebi, and exbi are binary prefix multipliers that, in 1998, were approved as a standard by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) in an effort to eliminate the confusion that sometimes occurs between decimal (power-of-10) and binary (power-of-2) numeration terms. At present, the prefix multipliers kilo- (k or K), mega- (M), giga- (G), tera- (T), peta- (P), and exa- (E) are ambiguous. In most of the physical sciences, and when describing quantities of objects generally, these multipliers refer to powers of 10. However, when used to define data quantity in terms of bytes, they refer to powers of 2. The following table denotes the most often-used prefixes and their meanings. {| class="wikitable" |- !Prefix !Symbol(s) !Power of 10 !Power of 2 |- |kilo- |k or K <sup>Note 1</sup> |10<sup>3</sup> |2<sup>10</sup> |- |mega- |M |10<sup>6</sup> |2<sup>20</sup> |- |giga- |G |10<sup>9</sup> |2<sup>30</sup> |- |tera- |T |10<sup>12</sup> |2<sup>40</sup> |- |peta- |P |10<sup>15</sup> |2<sup>50</sup> |- |exa- <sup>Note 2</sup> |E |10<sup>18</sup> |2<sup>60</sup> |- |zetta- <sup>Note 2</sup> |Z |10<sup>21</sup> |2<sup>70</sup>
