over who is a software engineer|Debate over who is a software engineer]]) A '[[programmer]]' is responsible for writing [[source code]],<ref name="Sourcegear_2005" /> but a 'developer' could be involved in wider aspects of the software development process such as: *Software Design *Actual core implementation (programming which is often the most important portion of software development) *Other required implementations (e.g. installation, configuration, customization, integration, data migration) *Participation in [[Software product management|software product definition]], including [[Business case]] or [[Gap_analysis#Market_gap_analysis|Gap]] analysis *Specification *[[Requirements analysis]] *Development and refinement of throw-away [[Software prototyping|simulations or prototypes]] to confirm requirements *[[Requirements_management#Feasibility|Feasibility]] and [[Cost-benefit analysis]], including the choice of application [[Application Architecture|architecture]] and [[Application framework|framework]], leading to the [[budget]] and schedule for the project *Authoring of [[Software documentation#User_documentation|documentation]] needed by users and implementation partners etc. *Testing, including defining/supporting [[acceptance testing]] and gathering feedback from [[Software_release_life_cycle#Software_release_stages|pre-release testers]] *Participation in [[Software_product_management#Management_of_aspects_of_software_development|software release and post-release]] activities, including support for product launch [[Technology evangelist|evangelism]] (e.g. developing demonstrations and/or samples) and competitive analysis for subsequent product build/release cycles *Maintenance In a large company there may be employees whose sole responsibility may consist of only one of the phases above. In smaller development environments, a few, or even a single individual might handle the complete process. ==References== {{reflist}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Software Developer}} [[Category:Computer programmers]] [[Category:People in information technology| Software developer]] [[ar:مطور برمجيات]] [[bn:সফটওয়্যার ডেভলপার]] [[bg:Софтуерен разработчик]] [[ca:Desenvolupador de programari]] [[cs:Vývojář]] [[de:Softwareentwickler]] [[et:Tarkvara arendaja]] [[es:Desarrollador de software]] [[eu:Software garatzaile]] [[fa:توسعه‌دهنده]] [[fr:Développeur]] [[ko:소프트웨어 개발자]] [[id:Pengembang perangkat lunak]] [[it:Sviluppatore software]] [[ms:Pembangun perisian]] [[nl:Softwareontwikkelaar]] [[ja:ソフトウェア開発者]] [[ru:Разработчик программного обеспечения]] [[simple:Software developer]] [[fi:Ohjelmistosuunnittelija]] [[sv:Systemutvecklare]] [[ta:மென்பொருள் உருவாக்குனர்]] [[th:นักพัฒนาซอฟต์แวร์]] [[tr:Yazılım geliştiricisi]] [[vi:Nhà phát triển phần mềm]] [[zh:软件设计师]]</text> </page> <page> <id>34985</id> <title>Software engine</title> <text>In computer science, a '''software engine''' refers to the core of a [[computer program]]. Software engines drive the functionality of the program, and are distinct from peripheral aspects of the program, such as [[look and feel]]. == Elucidation == The term Engine when used to describe a piece of software is frequently used by developers when speaking to a wider, layman audience, to describe what they would otherwise refer to as [[Library (computing) |library]], [[Computing platform|platform]], [[SDK]] or [[Object_(computer_science)|object]], to denote an encapsulated block of functionality. The term most frequently shows up in marketing material that need to describe software internals, as well as in product names. (see http://www.ableton.com/live-7-whats-new, http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/streamingengine, http://embird.com/sw/embird/fonteng.htm) Distinct definitions have however become established in certain fields, such as 3D rendering engine or game engine. Many of these have that in common, that they describe an input/output system where the output is of a different order than the input, such as the conversion of HTML to a rendered page, as opposed something like a spell checking component where the input and output are of the same order, only slightly different. But it is not a rule, just a tendency. ==See also== * [[search engine]] * [[game engine]] * [[layout engine]] * [[chess engine]] [[Category:Software engineering terminology]] {{Compu-soft-stub}} [[ar:محرك برمجي]] [[ca:Motor de programari]] [[fa:موتور نرم‌افزاری]] [[pl:Silnik (informatyka)]] [[ru:Движок]] [[sv:Motor (datalogi)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>34987</id> <title>Software engineering</title> <text>[[Image:Airbus A380 cockpit.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Airbus A380]] uses a substantial amount of software to create a "paperless" cockpit.]] '''Software engineering''' ('''SE''') is a [[profession]] dedicated to designing, implementing, and modifying [[computer software|software]] so that it is of higher quality, more affordable, maintainable, and faster to build.
