Development Agency, Indian Space Research Organization), and multinationals (Hewlett-Packard, Hitachi, IBM, Intel, Lucky Goldstar, Philips Research, ST Microelectronics, Texas Instruments). Many of these exercises have fed critical inputs to various National Initiatives in High Performance Computing and Communication Technology.<br /> '''Computational Facilities:''' SERC's objective is to meet a wide spectrum of computing requirements of the campus users. The Centre is thriving to provide excellent computing power, in terms of both hardware and software packages, to accommodate the needs of both science and engineering disciplines. In addition to meeting the demands in scientific computing, the Centre also provides the needed resource for symbolic computing and state-of-the-art graphics and visualization. The Centre's facilities are balanced to meet both the instructional and research program of the Institute. It accomplishes this through a variety of specialized heterogeneous machines which are homogenized by the network and system software.<br /> '''Education:''' SERC offers PhD and M Sc(Engg) in all the research areas mentioned above. A masters degree programme MTech in Computational Science, one of the first of its kind in India, was started by SERC in 1999. This is an inter-disciplinary programme that brings together the domain specific knowledge of science and engineering and the relevant topics of computer science and mathematics. SERC is located at the [[Indian Institute of Science]] in [[Bangalore]], [[India]] ==External links== * [http://www.serc.iisc.ernet.in Official site] {{coord missing|India}} [[Category:Supercomputers]] [[Category:Indian Institute of Science]] [[Category:Research institutes in India]] [[Category:Computer science institutes]]</text> </page> <page> <id>36187</id> <title>Superconvergence</title> <text>In [[numerical analysis]], a '''superconvergent''' method is one which converges faster than generally expected. For example in the [[Finite Element Method]] approximation to [[Poisson's equation]] in two dimensions, using piecewise linear elements, the average error in the [[gradient]] is [[First order approximation|first order]]. However under certain conditions it's possible to recover the gradient at certain locations within each element to [[Second order approximation|second order]]. == References == *S. Barbeiro, J.A.

This is done by viewing a [[voltage]] source on a wire as a point source voltage in relation to other point voltages located at various nodes in the circuit, relative to a [[ground (electricity)|ground]] node assigned a zero or negative charge. Each super-node contains two nodes, one a non-reference node and another node that may be a second non-reference node or the reference node. Super-nodes containing the reference node have one node voltage variable. For Nodal circuit analysis, the super-node construct is only required between two non-reference nodes. ==See also== * [[Nodal analysis]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Super-node (Circuit)}} [[Category:Electronic circuits]] {{Electronics-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>36204</id> <title>Superorganism</title> <text>[[Image:Termite Cathedral DSC03570.jpg|thumb|right|240px|A termite mound made by the cathedral termite]] [[Image:Reef0484.jpg|thumb|right|240px|A coral colony]] A '''superorganism''' is an [[organism]] consisting of many organisms. This is usually meant to be a [[social unit]] of [[eusociality|eusocial]] animals, where [[division of labour]] is highly specialised and where individuals are not able to survive by themselves for extended periods of time. [[Ants]] are the best-known example of such a superorganism, while the [[naked mole rat]] is a famous example of the [[eusociality|eusocial]] [[mammal]]. The technical definition of a superorganism is "a collection of agents which can act in concert to produce phenomena governed by the collective,"<ref>{{cite book |author=Kelly, Kevin |title=Out of control: the new biology of machines, social systems and the economic world |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Boston |year=1994 |pages=98 |isbn=0-201-48340-8 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> phenomena being any activity "the hive wants" such as ants collecting food or bees choosing a new nest site. The [[Gaia hypothesis]] of [[James Lovelock]]<ref>''Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth'', James Lovelock, Oxford University Press, 1979</ref> and the work of [[James Hutton]], [[Vladimir Vernadsky]] and [[Guy Murchie]], have suggested that the [[biosphere]] can be considered a superorganism. However, strict ecological studies reveal little or no self control inside organism communities,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} and such communities usually easily go off balance or change into entirely different ones. This view is countered and balanced by [[Systems Theory]] and the dynamics of a [[complex system]]. Superorganisms are important in [[cybernetics]], particularly [[biocybernetics]]. They exhibit a form of "distributed intelligence," a system in which many individual agents with limited intelligence and information are able to pool resources to accomplish a goal beyond the capabilities of the individuals. Existence of such behavior in organisms has many implications for military and management applications, and is being actively researched.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kelly, Kevin |title=Out of control: the new biology of machines, social systems and the economic world |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Boston |year=1994 |pages=251|isbn=0-201-48340-8 |oclc= |doi=}}<br><blockquote>If Col.

"The Data of Sociology", Herbert Spencer, 1876</ref>), though this was apparently a distinction between the organic and the social, ''not'' an identity: Spencer explored the [[holism in science|holistic]] nature of society as a [[social organism]] while distinguishing the ways in which society did not behave like an organism.<ref>''The Principles of Sociology'', Vol. 1, Part 2, Chapter II, "A Society Is an Organism" (sections 222 and 223), Herbert Spencer, 1876</ref>
