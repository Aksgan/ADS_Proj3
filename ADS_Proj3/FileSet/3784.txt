It is most commonly used in [[software development]], where a [[team]] of people may change the same files. Changes are usually identified by a number or letter code, termed the "revision number", "revision level", or simply "revision". For example, an initial set of files is "revision 1". When the first change is made, the resulting set is "revision 2", and so on. Each revision is associated with a [[timestamp]] and the person making the change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged. Version control systems (VCSs â€“ singular VCS) most commonly run as stand-alone applications, but revision control is also embedded in various types of software such as [[word processor]]s (e.g., [[Microsoft Word]], [[OpenOffice.org Writer]], [[KWord]], [[Pages]], etc.), spreadsheets (e.g., [[Microsoft Excel]], [[OpenOffice.org Calc]], [[KSpread]], [[Numbers (software)|Numbers]], etc.), and in various [[content management system]]s (e.g., [[Drupal]], [[Joomla]], [[WordPress]]). Integrated revision control is a key feature of [[wiki software]] packages such as [[MediaWiki]], [[DokuWiki]], [[TWiki]] etc. In [[wiki]]s, revision control allows for the ability to revert a page to a previous revision, which is critical for allowing editors to track each other's edits, correct mistakes, and defend public wikis against vandalism and [[Spam (electronic)|spam]].

This system of control implicitly allowed returning to any earlier state of the design, for cases in which an engineering dead-end was reached in the development of the design. Likewise, in computer [[software engineering]], revision control is any practice that tracks and provides control over changes to source code. [[Software developer]]s sometimes use revision control software to maintain documentation and [[configuration file]]s as well as source code. Also, version control is widespread in business and law. Indeed, "[[contract redline]]" and "[[legal blackline]]" are some of the earliest forms of revision control,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}<!-- need source for "earliest" --> and are still employed with varying degrees of sophistication. An entire industry has emerged to service the document revision control needs of business and other users, and some of the revision control technology employed in these circles is subtle, powerful, and innovative. The most sophisticated techniques are beginning to be used for the electronic tracking of changes to [[computer-aided design|CAD]] files (see [[product data management]]), supplanting the "manual" electronic implementation of traditional revision control. As teams design, develop and deploy software, it is common for multiple versions of the same software to be deployed in different sites and for the software's developers to be working simultaneously on updates. [[Computer bug|Bugs]] or features of the software are often only present in certain versions (because of the fixing of some problems and the introduction of others as the program develops). Therefore, for the purposes of locating and fixing bugs, it is vitally important to be able to retrieve and run different versions of the software to determine in which version(s) the problem occurs. It may also be necessary to develop two versions of the software concurrently (for instance, where one version has bugs fixed, but no new
