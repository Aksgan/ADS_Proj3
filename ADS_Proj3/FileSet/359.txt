However, in graphics mode the values of the variables HO and VE are relative. That means that the values for painting a pixel in the middle of the screen are HO=0.5 and VE=0.5, for the upper left corner HO=0 and VE=0 and for the lower right corner HO=1 and VE=1. This is to ensure a comparable graphics output regardless of available screen resolution. '''Further general rules and definitions (in addition to the BASICODE 2 standard)''' The names of new functions may only be two characters long, just like variable names. Defining new string functions is not possible in BASICODE. The program ends with "GOTO 950", because the commands RUN, END and STOP are no longer allowed. The following variable names are not available to programs in BASICODE: <pre> - all variables starting with the letter "O" - AS, AT, DI, DI$, DS, DS$, EI, EI$, EL, ER, FN, GO, GR, IF, LN, SQ, SQ$, ST, TI, TI$, TO - PI </pre> The following variables are used by the Bascoder, for example for passing values from the program to the Bascoder or for returning them from the Bascoder to the program: <pre> - A, CN, CT, FR, HG, HO, IN, IN$, NF, NF$, RV, SD, SP, SR, SR$, SV, VE, VG </pre> ==See also== * [[hardware abstraction layer]] * [[library (computer science)]] * [[virtual machine]] * [[Kansas City standard]] ==References== * {{de}} ==Further reading== * {{de icon}} Michael Wiegand, Manfred Fillinger: ''BASICODE.

While the BATON algorithm itself is secret, the public PKCS#11 standard includes some general information about how it is used. It has a 320-bit key and uses a 128-bit block in most modes, and also supports a 96-bit [[Electronic codebook#Electronic codebook (ECB)|electronic codebook mode]]. 160 bits of the key are [[checksum]] material. It supports a "shuffle" mode of operation, like the NSA cipher [[JUNIPER]]. It may use up to 192 bits as an initialization vector, regardless of the block size.<ref>[ftp://ftp.rsasecurity.com/pub/pkcs/pkcs-11/201final/spec/v201.pdf PKCS #11 spec]</ref> In response to a Senate question about encrypted video links, NSA said that BATON could be used for encryption at speeds higher than those possible with [[Skipjack (cipher)|Skipjack]].<ref>[http://csrc.nist.gov/keyrecovery/ees_q-a.txt]</ref> ==Usage== BATON is used in a variety of products and standards: *[[APCO Project 25]] (Public standard for land mobile radio) (Algorithm IDs 01 and 41) *[[PKCS11|PKCS#11]] (Public standard for encryption tokens) *[[CDSA/CSSM]] (Another public standard) *[[HAIPE-IS]] ([[NSA]]'s version of [[IPsec]]) *[[FNBDT]] (Advanced flexible voice security protocol) *[[Thales Group|Thales]] [[Datacryptor 2000]] (a British network-encryption box) *[[SecNet-11]] (a crypto-secure [[802.11b]] [[PC Card]], based on the [[Sierra (microchip)|Sierra chip]]) *[[KOV-14|Fortezza Plus]] (a [[PC Card]] product, used in the [[Secure Terminal Equipment|STE]]) *[[SafeXcel-3340]] (a HAIPIS network-encryption box) *Numerous embeddable encryption modules: [[Advanced INFOSEC Machine|AIM]], [[CYPRIS (microchip)|CYPRIS]], [[MYK-85]], [[Sierra (microchip)]], etc. ==References== {{reflist}} ==See also== * [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] ==External links== * [http://www.scardsoft.com/documents/Security/pkcs11_v211.pdf PKCS documentation] * [http://www.security-forums.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=12641 Discussion of BATON] * [http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/crypto/2000-q4/0028.html Quotes about BATON] * [http://csrc.nist.gov/keyrecovery/ees_q-a.txt Senate security interview] [[Category:Type 1 encryption algorithms]] {{crypto-stub}} {{Crypto navbox | block}} [[Category:Block ciphers]] [[it:BATON]]</text> </page> <page> <id>3070</id> <title>BBN Butterfly</title> <text>The '''BBN Butterfly''' was a massively [[parallel computer]] built by [[Bolt, Beranek and Newman]] in the 1980s. It was named for the "butterfly" multi-stage switching network around which it was built. Each machine had up to 512 [[Central processing unit|CPUs]], each with local memory, which could be connected to allow every CPU access to every other CPU's memory, although with a substantially greater latency (roughly 15:1) than for its own. The CPUs were commodity microprocessors. The memory address space was shared. The first generation<ref>Rettberg, R„ С Wyman, D. Hunt, M. Hoffman. P. Carvey, B. Hyde. W. Clark, and M.

The Butterfly connect was developed specifically for this computer. The second or third generation, GP-1000 models used Motorola [[68020]]'s and scaled to 256 CPUs. The later, TC-2000 models (called "Monarchs") used Motorola [[MC88100]]'s, and scaled to 512 CPUs.<ref> {{Citation | author1 = Patrick R. Amestoy | author2 = Michel J. Daydé | author3 = Iain S.
