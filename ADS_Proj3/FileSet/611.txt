example of an Xbox 360 case mod]] ''Console case modding'' refers to gamers who modify the case of their game consoles. The most common consoles to modify are the Xbox and Xbox 360, because there is much more room inside to customize them with items such as lights, fans, etc. These consoles and their controllers are also relatively easy to take apart. For those who do not wish to scratch-build mods, there are several companies that sell transparent Xbox cases and various cooling/lighting equipment for them. Console case modding started in the late 1980s when the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] and [[Sega Mega Drive|Sega Genesis]], were released; many customers simply put pictures or stickers on them until the [[PlayStation]] was released. Many case modders started to change hardware, for example by altering them to play copied games (known as 'chipping' the games console). The most common modification for the PlayStation was the 'chipping' process (mentioned above). When the [[Nintendo 64]], [[Dreamcast]] and [[PlayStation 2]] was released, many chipped them, styled them, and added additional cooling; some went as far as changing the hardware itself. When the [[Xbox]] and [[Xbox 360]] were released, many modders personally customized them further, using neon lights, transparent cases, fans, and PC hard drives (as opposed to Xbox-branded drives). Many modders found that altering the interior of Xbox 360s was difficult due to absence of a power cable (normally in a PC, this cord attaches the hard disk drive to its motherboard). Despite shortcomings, modders also found a way to power neon lighting and other powered equipment by using the DVD-ROM power supply; however, due to insufficient power to the hard disk drive, it often caused freezing during disk access.

Fortunately, the most recent products available for internal case modding uses the power outlet for the internal fan by splitting the cord with a "Y" connector. ==See also== *[[Hardware hacking]] *[[Modchip]] *[[Modding]] *[[Overclocking]] *[[USB decoration]] ==External links== {{commons category|Modding}} <!--If you add a valid external link, remove the remark mark-up above--> <!---For anyone editing these links, do not add any sites that are not in English (there are wikis in the desired language for that), or sites that are commercial.

All services to the public were free, including [[malware]] and [[rootkit]] cleanup of infected computers, malware and [[Phishing|phish]] investigations and terminations, and searchable database lists of malware and file hashes. It was targeted by spammers throughout its existence, but fought back using legal means to defeat them.<ref>[http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9096278 'Hacker' pleads guilty to attacking antiphishing group] posted June 10, 2008 on [[ComputerWorld]]</ref> ==History== Education and collaborative information sharing were among CastleCops (formerly known as ''Computer Cops'' before the name change in 2005) highest priorities. They had been achieved by training the volunteer staff in their anti-malware, phishing, and rootkit academies and through additional services including CastleCops forums, news, reviews, and continuing education. CastleCops consistently worked with industry experts and law enforcement to reach their ultimate goal in securing a safe and smart computing experience for everyone online. CastleCops reached its five year anniversary in February 2007 with accolades from well-known computer security industry pundits and players.<ref> *[http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2007/01/in_praise_of_the_phish_fighter.html Washington Post: In Praise of the Phish Fighters] *[http://www.symantec.com/enterprise/security_response/weblog/2007/02/castlecops_celebrates_five_yea.html Symantec: CastleCops "Phighting" Phish] *[http://blog.spywareguide.com/2007/01/celebrate_with_castlecops.html SpywareGuide.com: CastleCops Five Year Anniversary] *[http://sunbeltblog.blogspot.com/2007/02/recognizing-paul-and-robin-laudanski.html Sunbelt: In Recognition of the Founders] *[http://www.google.com/corporate/security.html Google: Thanks You]</ref> On December 24, 2008, the CastleCops Website announces that "All things come to an end" and that Castlecops has ceased to exist, for an as yet undetermined reason.
