The production started in 1959&ndash;1960. Models 1001, 1002, 1003, 1013, 1103, 1204 were of original Polish construction. Models 1304 and 1305 were functional counterparts of [[International Computers Limited|ICL]] 1905 and 1906 due to software agreement.<ref>http://itpedia.pl/index.php/ODRA_1305</ref> The last model was 1325 based on two models from ICL. The name comes from the [[Oder river|Odra River]] that flows through the city of Wrocław The computers were built at the [[Elwro]] manufacturing plant, which was closed in 1989. ODRA-1002 were capable of only 100-400 operations per second.<ref>http://www.warmus.com.pl/pdf/tytul_ang.pdf</ref> The operating system used by the ODRA-1204 is called SODA. It was designed to work on a small computer without magnetic storage and can run simultaneous loading and execution of programs.<ref>http://comjnl.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/11/2/148</ref> An [[ALGOL 68]] compiler was produced for the ODRA 1204/IL in 1976. As for 2008 there is still at least one machine working at railway station in Wrocław Brochów.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wfp.pl/wroclaw-miasto/news.php?id=10004|title=Zabytkowa Odra pracuje na stacji kolejowej|opublikowany=Alert24.pl|date=25 April 2008|accessdate=26 April 2008|language=pl|author=Jacek Bomersbach |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080530115600/http://www.wfp.pl/wroclaw-miasto/news.php?id=10004 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 30 May 2008}}</ref> This machine was shut down on 30 April 2010, 22:00 CEST<ref>{{cite web | title=Wyłączono ostatni komputer Odra w Polsce! | url=http://www.computerworld.pl/news/358487/Wylaczono.ostatni.komputer.Odra.w.Polsce.html}}</ref> and replaced with a contemporary computer system. Few Odras are placed on exhibition in museums and at least one is still operational and maintained by students of electrical school which created a fan club around the machine.

It functions as the office of the [[National Statistician]], who is also the UK Statistics Authority's Chief Executive and principal statistical adviser to the UK's National Statistics Institute<ref>'National Statistics Institute' and NSI are a standard expression and its acronym used about statistical services in [[OECD]] & EU terminology</ref> and the 'Head Office' of the Government Statistical Service (GSS). Its main office is in Newport near the [[United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office]] and [[Tredegar House]], but another significant office is in [[Titchfield]] in [[Hampshire]], and an administrative office on ''Myddelton Street'' in [[Islington]], the former home of the [[Family Records Centre]]. This office moved from ''Drummond Gate'' in [[Pimlico]] in 2008. == History == The ONS was formed on 1 April 1996 by the merger of the [[Central Statistical Office, UK|Central Statistical Office]] (CSO) and the [[Office of Population Censuses and Surveys]] (OPCS).<ref>John Pullinger (1997) [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0306-7734%28199712%2965%3A3%3C291%3ATCOTOF%3E2.0.CO%3B2-2&size=LARGE&origin=JSTOR-enlargePage ''"The Creation of the Office for National Stfstics"''], ''International Statistical Review'', Vol. 65, No. 3, pp. 291-308</ref> Following the [[Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007]], the United Kingdom Statistics Authority became a [[non-ministerial department]] on the 1 April 2008<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about/data/independence/thestatisticsact.asp The Statistics Act: Office for National Statistics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. == Purpose and scope == ONS produces and publishes a
