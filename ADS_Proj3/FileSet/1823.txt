created the U.S. system of currency, and most of its rules were followed for many years. Among them was a basic design for any gold or silver coins; the obverse was required to have an "impression emblematic of liberty", with the reverse having a "figure or representation of an eagle". While using a depiction of the national arms was not necessary, various different arms designs were often used until the early 1900s, and still sometimes appear today on commemorative coins. Even before the mint, the 1787 [[Brasher Doubloon]] had a depiction of the arms on one side. <center><gallery> File:Draped Bust Heraldic Eagle Quarter.png|1806 quarter File:Double Eagle 1856 O Reverse.jpg|1856 [[Double Eagle]] File:25 центов Барбера 1898 года (реверс).png|1898 [[United States Barber coinage|Barber quarter]] File:American Silver Eagle, reverse.jpg|[[American Silver Eagle]] </gallery></center> ===Senate carpet=== [[File:Congress Hall Great Seal rug reproduction.jpg|thumb|1978 reproduction]] When the U.S. government moved back to Philadelphia in 1790, the city, in an attempt to convince the federal government not to move to Washington, was determined to provide luxurious accommodations at [[Congress Hall]], the recently constructed building where Congress was to meet. One of the finishing touches was in June 1791, when a large [[Axminster carpet]] was installed in the Senate's upper-floor chamber. The central design was the U.S. coat of arms, complete with the constellation of 13 stars, surrounded by the linked shields of all thirteen states. Under the arms, there was also a pole with a [[phrygian cap|liberty cap]] and a balance of justice. The carpet was 22 by 40 feet, and was made by William Peter Sprague, an Englishman from [[Axminster]] (probably trained under [[Thomas Whitty]]) who had set up a factory in Philadelphia. The carpet was not brought to [[Washington, D.C.]], when the government moved in 1800, and is long lost. The [[National Park Service]] had a reproduction made in 1978 as part of the restoration of Congress Hall; they had to speculate on the exact design of the eagle and chose the representation seen on the first seal die.<ref name="carpet2">{{cite book|title=The Most Splendid Carpet|last=Anderson|first=Susan H.|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/inde/anderson/index.htm|chapter=A Masterpiece for the Senate|chapterurl=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/inde/anderson/chap1.htm|oclc=06279577}}</ref> [[File:US-GreatSeal-Reverse-Lossing1856.jpg|thumb|150px|Lossing's reverse]] ===Benson Lossing reverse=== In the July 1856 ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's New Monthly Magazine]]'', historian [[Benson John Lossing]] wrote an article on the Great Seal. To illustrate the article, along with copies of Hopkinson's and Barton's original drawings and his own interpretations of the first committee's designs, he also included an apparently original version of the reverse. This depiction more resembles the [[Egyptian pyramids]], and changed the Eye of Providence to a left eye. Lossing's reverse has heavily influenced all future renditions, including today's official version.<ref name="statepub"/> ===Centennial Medal=== {{double image|left|1882 US Great Seal Centennial Medal Obverse.jpg |100| 1882 US Great Seal Centennial Medal Reverse.jpg |100|Barber's centennial medal}} In February 1882, [[C. A. L. Totten]] (then a 1st lieutenant in the U.S. Army) wrote to both the Secretaries of State and Treasury to suggest some sort of commemoration for the Great Seal, which was to have its centennial later that year, in particular including a version of the never-cut and rarely seen reverse side. The State Department demurred, but the Treasury Department (having the ability to act without express permission of Congress) decided that a commemorative medal would be appropriate and agreed to make one later that year.<ref name="totten"/><ref name="hunt1909"/> The medal was designed by [[Charles E. Barber]], the chief engraver of the U.S. Mint. For the obverse, Barber primarily used Trenchard's 1786 ''Columbian Magazine'' version, but replaced the eagle with the superior one from Dupré's 1792 Diplomatic Medal (which had been rediscovered a few years before). For the reverse, Barber directly copied Trenchard's 1786 design. According to Totten, two [[Proof coinage|proofs]] were made in time for the June 20, 1882, centennial date with general circulation following in October 1882. This was the first time a design for the reverse had been officially issued by the U.S. government.<ref name="statepub"/><ref name="totten"/> {{image stack|align=right|image_size=180|image1=1935 Dollar Bill Back Early Design.jpg|image2=2007 US $1 Bill Reverse.jpg|image2_cap=The first design of the 1935 $1 [[Federal Reserve Note]] with Roosevelt's change instructions, and the finished design as seen on a 2007 note.}} ===1935 dollar bill=== [[File:US-GreatSeal-Hunt1909Reverse.jpg|left|thumb|110px|The 1909 reverse]] According to [[Henry A. Wallace]] (then the [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]] in President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s cabinet), in 1934 he saw a 1909 pamphlet on the Great Seal by [[Gaillard Hunt]]. The pamphlet included a full-color copy of the reverse of the Great Seal, which Wallace had never seen. He especially liked the motto ''Novus Ordo Seclorum'' ("New Order of the Ages"), likening it to Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] (i.e., "New Deal of the Ages"). He suggested to Roosevelt that a coin be made which included the reverse, but Roosevelt instead decided to put it on the [[United States one-dollar bill|dollar bill]]. The initial design of the bill had the obverse on the left and the reverse on the right, but Roosevelt ordered them to be switched around.<ref name="statepub"/><ref name="gsdollar">{{cite web|url=http://www.greatseal.com/dollar/hawfdr.html|title=How the Great Seal Got on the One-Dollar Bill|publisher=greatseal.com|first= John D.|last=MacArthur|accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref> The first bill to contain both sides of the seal was the series 1935 $1 [[Silver Certificate]].<ref name="bepfaq">{{cite web|url=http://www.moneyfactory.gov/faqlibrary.html|title=Bureau of Engraving and Printing FAQ Library|accessdate=2011-1-16}}</ref> The obverse had originally appeared on the back of the $20 [[Gold Certificate]], Series 1905.<ref name="bepfaq"/> In 2008, the redesigned front side of the [[United States five-dollar bill|five-dollar bill]] added a purple outline of the obverse of the Great Seal as a background, as part of freedom-related symbols being added to redesigned bills.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bep.treas.gov/newmoney/main.cfm/currency/new5|title=About the New $5 Bill|author=[[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]]|accessdate=2008-02-12}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> ===Current versions=== Today's official versions from the Department of State are largely unchanged from the 1885 designs. The current rendering of the reverse was made by Teagle & Little of Norfolk, Virginia, in 1972. It is nearly identical to previous versions, which in turn were based on Lossing's 1856 version.<ref>''The Eagle and the Shield'', p. xxxvii</ref><ref>The vector version of the obverse at the top of this article was taken from U.S. government publications, while the vector reverse was made by a Wikipedia
