blue light is at the short wavelength end of the visible spectrum, it is more strongly scattered in the atmosphere than long wavelength red light. The result is that the human eye perceives blue when looking toward parts of the sky other than the sun.<ref>"[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9062822 Rayleigh scattering]."

Smith, ''American Journal of Physics'', Volume 73, Issue 7, pp. 590-597 (2005).</ref> Near [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]], most of the light we see comes in nearly tangent to the Earth's surface, so that the light's path through the atmosphere is so long that much of the blue and even green light is scattered out, leaving the sun rays and the clouds it illuminates red. Therefore, when looking at the sunset and sunrise, you will see the color red more than any of the other colors. Scattering and absorption are major causes of the [[attenuation]] of radiation by the atmosphere. Scattering varies as a function of the ratio of the particle diameter to the wavelength of the radiation. When this ratio is less than about one-tenth, [[Rayleigh scattering]] occurs in which the scattering coefficient varies inversely as the fourth power of the wavelength. At larger values of the ratio of particle diameter to wavelength, the scattering varies in a complex fashion described, for spherical particles, by the [[Mie theory]]; at a ratio of the order of 10, the laws of [[geometric optics]] begin to apply. ==Neutral points== There are three commonly detectable points of zero [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] of diffuse sky radiation (known as neutral points) lying along the [[vertical circle]] through the [[sun]]. *The '''Arago point''', named after its discoverer, is customarily located at about 20° above the [[antisolar point]]; but it lies at higher altitudes in turbid air. The latter property makes the Arago distance a useful measure of atmospheric [[turbidity]]. *The '''Babinet point''', discovered by Babinet in 1840, is located about 15° to 20° above the sun, hence it is difficult to observe because of solar glare. *The '''Brewster point''', discovered by Brewster in 1840, is located about 15° to 20° below the sun; hence it is difficult to observe because of solar glare. ==Under an overcast sky== There is essentially no direct sunlight under an overcast sky, so all light is then diffuse sky radiation. The flux of light is not very wavelength dependent because the cloud droplets are larger than the light's wavelength and scatter all colors approximately equally. The light passes through the translucent clouds in a manner similar to frosted glass. The intensity ranges (roughly) from {{frac|1|6}} of direct sunlight for relatively thin clouds down to {{frac|1|1000}} of direct sunlight under the extreme of thickest storm clouds{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}. ==See also== *[[Aerial perspective]] *[[Daylight]] *Nighttime [[airglow]] *[[Tyndall effect]] *[[Rayleigh scattering]] *[[Rayleigh Sky Model]] == References == {{Reflist}} ==Further reading== *{{cite book |first=Peter|last=Pesic | title=Sky in a Bottle | year=2005 | publisher=The MIT Press | isbn=978-0-262-16234-0}} ==External links== *[http://www.arvindguptatoys.com/arvindgupta/raman.htm Dr. C.

It uses [[encryption]] to send the [[password]] over the network which is safer than the [[Basic access authentication]] that sends [[plaintext]]. Technically digest authentication is an application of [[MD5]] [[cryptographic hash]]ing with usage of [[Cryptographic nonce|nonce]] values to discourage [[cryptanalysis]]. It uses the [[HTTP]] protocol. == Overview == Digest access authentication was originally specified by RFC 2069 (''An Extension to HTTP: Digest Access Authentication''). RFC 2069 specifies roughly a traditional digest authentication scheme with security maintained by a server-generated [[Cryptographic nonce|nonce]] value. The authentication response is formed as follows (where HA1, HA2, A1, A2 are names of string variables): :<math>\mathrm{HA1} = \mathrm{MD5}\Big(\mathrm{A1}\Big) = \mathrm{MD5}\Big( \mathrm{username} : \mathrm{realm} : \mathrm{password} \Big)</math> :<math>\mathrm{HA2} = \mathrm{MD5}\Big(\mathrm{A2}\Big) = \mathrm{MD5}\Big( \mathrm{method} : \mathrm{digestURI} \Big)</math> :<math>\mathrm{response} = \mathrm{MD5}\Big( \mathrm{HA1} : \mathrm{nonce} : \mathrm{HA2} \Big) </math> RFC 2069 was later replaced by RFC 2617 (''HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication''). RFC 2617 introduced a number of optional security enhancements to digest authentication; "quality of protection" (qop), nonce counter incremented by client, and a client-generated random nonce. These enhancements are designed to protect against, for example, [[chosen-plaintext attack]] [[cryptanalysis]]. :<math>\mathrm{HA1} = \mathrm{MD5}\Big(\mathrm{A1}\Big) = \mathrm{MD5}\Big( \mathrm{username} : \mathrm{realm} : \mathrm{password} \Big)</math> If the qop directive's value is "auth" or is unspecified, then HA2 is :<math>\mathrm{HA2} = \mathrm{MD5}\Big(\mathrm{A2}\Big) = \mathrm{MD5}\Big( \mathrm{method} : \mathrm{digestURI} \Big)</math> If the qop directive's value is "auth-int" , then HA2 is :<math>\mathrm{HA2} = \mathrm{MD5}\Big(\mathrm{A2}\Big) = \mathrm{MD5}\Big( \mathrm{method} : \mathrm{digestURI} : \mathrm {MD5}(entityBody)\Big)</math> If the qop directive's value is "auth" or "auth-int" , then compute the response as follows: :<math>\mathrm{response} = \mathrm{MD5}\Big( \mathrm{HA1} : \mathrm{nonce} : \mathrm{nonceCount} : \mathrm{clientNonce} : \mathrm{qop} : \mathrm{HA2} \Big)</math> If the qop directive is unspecified, then compute the response as follows: :<math>\mathrm{response} = \mathrm{MD5}\Big( \mathrm{HA1} : \mathrm{nonce} : \mathrm{HA2} \Big) </math> The above shows that when qop is not specified, the simpler RFC 2069 standard is followed. == Impact of MD5 security on digest authentication == The MD5 calculations used in HTTP digest authentication is intended to be "[[one-way function|one way]]", meaning that it should be difficult to determine the original input when only the output is known. If the password itself is too simple, however, then it may be possible to test all possible inputs and find a matching output (a [[brute-force attack]]) – perhaps aided by a dictionary or suitable look-up list.
