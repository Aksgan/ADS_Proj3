included text (entered on [[BBC Micro]] computers) and photographs from over 1 million contributors in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], and covering the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user-interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until 2008.<ref name="Domesday Project">[http://www.domesday1986.com/ Website discussing the emulator of the Domesday Project User Interface] for the data from the Community Disc (contributions from the general public); the site is currently out of action following the death of its creator</ref> One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was [[h2g2]], which was created by [[Douglas Adams]] and is run by the [[BBC]]. The h2g2 encyclopedia was relatively light-hearted, focusing on articles which were both witty and informative. Both of these projects had similarities with Wikipedia, but neither gave full editorial privileges to public users. A similar non-wiki project, the [[GNUPedia]] project, co-existed with Nupedia early in its history; however, it has been retired and its creator, [[free software]] figure [[Richard Stallman]], has lent his support to Wikipedia.<ref name="stallman1999" /> Wikipedia has also spawned several sister projects, which are also run by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. The first, "In Memoriam: September<!--Do not reformat this date, it is quoted--> 11 Wiki,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sep11memories.org/wiki/In_Memoriam |title=In Memoriam: September 11, 2001 |accessdate=2007-02-06}}</ref> created in October 2002,<ref>[http://www.sep11memories.org/index.php?title=In_Memoriam&oldid=1502 First edit to the wiki] In Memoriam: September 11 wiki (October 28, 2002),</ref> detailed the [[September 11 attacks]]; this project was closed in October 2006. [[Wiktionary]], a dictionary project, was launched in December 2002;<ref>"[http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikimedia_News&diff=prev&oldid=4133 Announcement of Wiktionary's creation]," December 12, 2002. Retrieved on 2007-02-02.</ref> [[Wikiquote]], a collection of quotations, a week after Wikimedia launched, and [[Wikibooks]], a collection of collaboratively written free textbooks and annotated texts. Wikimedia has since started a number of other projects, including [[Wikiversity]], a project for the creation of free learning materials and the provision of online learning activities.<ref name="OurProjects">"[http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Our_projects Our projects]," [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. Retrieved on 2007-01-24</ref> None of these sister projects, however, has come to meet the success of Wikipedia. Several languages of Wikipedia also maintain a reference desk, where volunteers answer questions from the general public. According to a study by Pnina Shachaf in the Journal of Documentation, the quality of the Wikipedia reference desk is comparable to a standard library reference desk, with an accuracy of 55%.<ref>"[http://www.slis.indiana.edu/news/story.php?story_id=2064 Wikipedia Reference Desk]," fetched 17 February 2010</ref> Other websites centered on collaborative [[knowledge base]] development have drawn inspiration from or inspired Wikipedia. Some, such as [[Susning.nu]], [[Enciclopedia Libre Universal en Español|Enciclopedia Libre]], [[Hudong]], [[Baidu Baike]], and [[WikiZnanie]] likewise employ no formal review process, whereas others use more traditional [[peer review]], such as [[Encyclopedia of Life]], [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], [[Scholarpedia]], [[h2g2]], and [[Everything2]]. The online wiki-based encyclopedia [[Citizendium]] was started by Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger in an attempt to create an "expert-friendly" Wikipedia.<ref name="defactoleader">{{Cite news |first=Holden |last=Frith |url=http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/the_web/article1571519.ece |title=Wikipedia founder launches rival online encyclopedia |publisher=The Times |date=March 26, 2007, |accessdate=2007-06-27 |quote=Wikipedia's de facto leader, Jimmy Wales, stood by the site's format. – Holden Frith. | location=London}}</ref><ref name="Orlowski18"> {{Cite news |first=Andrew |last=Orlowski |authorlink=Andrew Orlowski |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/09/18/sanger_forks_wikipedia/ |title=Wikipedia founder forks Wikipedia, More experts, less fiddling? |publisher=The Register |date=September 18, 2006 |accessdate=2007-06-27 |quote=Larry Sanger describes the Citizendium project as a "progressive or gradual fork," with the major difference that experts have the final say over edits.}} – Andrew Orlowski.</ref><ref name="JayLyman">{{Cite news |first=Jay |last=Lyman |url=http://www.crmbuyer.com/story/53137.html |title=Wikipedia Co-Founder Planning New Expert-Authored Site |publisher=LinuxInsider |date=September 20, 2006 |accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> == See also == {{meta|List of Wikipedias}} {{Spoken Wikipedia|Wikipedia.ogg|2005-06-25}} * [[Behind the Mirror: A Search for a Natural History of Human Knowledge]], philosophical background * [[Democratization of knowledge]] * [[Interpedia]], an early proposal for a collaborative Internet encyclopedia * [[GNUPedia]] * [[Nupedia]] * [[List of online encyclopedias]] * [[List of wikis]] * [[Network effect]] * [[USA Congressional staff edits to Wikipedia]] * [[User-generated content]] * [[Wikipedia Review]] {{clear}} * {{intitle|Wikipedia}} * {{lookfrom|Wikipedia}} == Notes == {{reflist|colwidth=30em}} == Further reading == ;Academic studies {{Main|Academic studies about Wikipedia}} * {{Cite journal|first=Finn|last=Nielsen|url=http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue12_8/nielsen/index.html|title=Scientific Citations in Wikipedia|journal=[[First Monday (journal)|First Monday]]|volume=12 |issue=8|month=August|year=2007|accessdate=2008-02-22}} * {{Cite journal|unused_data=DUPLICATE DATA: page=88|last=Pfeil|first=Ulrike|year=2006|title=Cultural Differences in Collaborative Authoring of Wikipedia|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|volume=12|issue=1|url=http://jcmc.indiana.edu./vol12/issue1/pfeil.html |accessdate=2008-12-26|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2006.00316.x|page=88|coauthors=Panayiotis Zaphiris and Chee Siang Ang}} * Priedhorsky, Reid, Jilin Chen, Shyong (Tony) K.
