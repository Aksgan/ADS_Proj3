Only commands like "Go", "Turn Left", "Turn Right", "Conjure" were implemented and building stand-alone executable application was not possible. The application itself was developed in SGP Systems's language called ''Baltazar'' based on C language in early 1995. ===Baltie 3=== ===Baltie 4 C#=== Baltie 4 C# is an educational programming language which is a continuation of Baltie 3. As a first version of Baltie, programmers can use text commands (not only icons as in previous versions). Is based on C# language, contains [[compiler]] and [[debugger|built-in debugger]]. Also creates [[exe|executable files]] (.exe) which can be executed without Baltie IDE. Programming in Baltie is [[object oriented programming|object oriented]]. Users can choose whether they use primary icons (graphical representation of text commands like ''for'' statement or ''if'' statement) in the icon editor or text commands in the text editor. Icon commands are converted to the C# code which is compiled. Baltie contains a special window called C# code preview where user can see icon commands and correspondent C# code. This is very useful for young and kids which have no experiences with programming at all. The biggest noticeable change in Baltie 4 C# is a complete 3D environment with Baltie character (or without for mature users). Baltie 4 C# consist of following modes: 3D interactive mode with Baltie, 2D interactive mode with Baltie, 3D(2D) programming mode with Baltie, 3D(2D) programming mode, Console programming mode and C# programming mode where icons are completely hidden and model editor. ==External links== {{Commons category|Baltie}} * [http://www.sgpsys.com/ SGP Systems website] * [http://www.rsei.umk.pl/issep/workshops/baltie.pdf Brief description of Baltie 4 C#] [[Category:Visual programming languages]] [[Category:.NET programming tools]] [[Category:Educational programming languages]] [[Category:Integrated development environments]] [[Category:Pedagogic integrated development environments]] [[Category:Video game creation software]] {{programming-software-stub}} [[cs:Baltík]] [[pl:Baltie]]</text> </page> <page> <id>3302</id> <title>Banbury mixer</title> <text>The '''Banbury Mixer''' is a [[brand]] of internal [[Batch production|batch]] [[Industrial mixer|mixer]]. The "Banbury" trademark is owned by [[Farrel Corporation]]. Internal batch mixers such as the Banbury mixer are used for mixing or compounding [[rubber]] and plastics. The original design dates back to [[1916]].<ref>[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-29505973_ITM Process machinery: advancements in mixing technologies--part 1.]</ref> The mixer consists of two rotating spiral shaped blades encased in segments of cylindrical housings. These intersect so as to leave a ridge between the blades. The blades may be cored for circulation of heating or cooling. Its invention resulted in major labor and capital savings in the tire industry, doing away with the initial step of roller-milling rubber.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=XSybNRCfYn0C&pg=PA336&dq=%22Banbury+mixer%22+history&lr=&num=100&as_brr=0&sig=JRnz_SnRvRt3SWgw9zIND4JEomE The Labor History Reader by Daniel J.

Bandelets can be interpreted as a warped [[wavelet]] basis. The motivation behind bandelets is to perform a transform on functions defined as smooth functions on smoothly bounded domains. As bandelet construction utilizes [[wavelets]], many of the results follow. Similar approaches to take account of geometric structure were taken for [[contourlet]]s and [[curvelet]]s. == See also == *[[Wavelet]] *[[Multiresolution analysis]] *[[Scale space]] == References == * Le Pennec, E., and Mallat, S., Sparse Geometric Image Representation with Bandelets, IEEE Trans. on Image Processing, vol 14, no. 4, p. 423-438, April 2005.

Forouzan]], ''Data communications and networking'', McGraw-Hill, 2007</ref> is a [[bit rate]] measure of available or consumed data communication resources expressed in bits/second or multiples of it (kilobits/s, megabits/s etc.). Note that in textbooks on [[data transmission]], [[digital communications]], [[wireless communications]], [[electronics]], etc., bandwidth refers to analog [[signal bandwidth]] measured in [[hertz]] - the original meaning of the term. Some computer networking authors prefer less ambiguous terms such as ''[[bit rate]]'', ''[[channel capacity]]'' and ''[[throughput]]'' rather than bandwidth in bit/s, to avoid this confusion. ==Network bandwidth capacity== In computer networking, ''bandwidth'' in bit/s sometimes means the [[net bit rate]] (also known as ''peak bit rate'', ''information rate'' or physical layer ''useful bit rate''), [[channel capacity]], or the [[maximum throughput]] of a logical or physical communication path in a digital communication system. For example, [[bandwidth test]]s measure the maximum throughput of a computer network. The reason for this usage is that according to [[Hartley's law]], the maximum data rate of a physical communication link is proportional
