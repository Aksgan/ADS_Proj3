It aims in bringing together Malware and Information Security Researchers from across the globe to share key research insights into building and containment of the next generation malwares. Unlike most hacker conventions, MALCON is opposed to the much debated ‘[[Zero-day attack|zero day]]’ and ‘[[full disclosure]]’. The first MalCon conference took place in December 2010 at Mumbai and Pune, India. Many of the attendees at MALCON include security professionals, Government employees, lawyers, researchers, journalists and [[Hacker (computing)|hackers]] with interest in malwares and its global impact on economy. The event promotes “[[proactive]]” research in malware coding and openly invites malcoders to come forward and demonstrate their creation. == History == MalCon was founded in 2010 by Rajshekhar Murthy,<ref name="ThreatpostConference">{{cite web |url= http://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/new-conference-wants-bring-malware-writers-out-shadows-082510 |title= New Conference Wants to Bring Malware Writers Out of the Shadows |author= Paul Roberts |date= August 25, 2010 |work= [[Kaspersky Lab]] Security News Service |accessdate= December 26, 2010 }}</ref><ref name="TechgossExploit">{{cite web |url= http://www.techgoss.com/Story/141S11-Terrorists-exploit-Mumbai-net-security.aspx |title= Terrorists exploit Mumbai net security |author= Pulkit Sharma |date= August 25, 2008 |work= Techgoss |accessdate= December 26, 2010 }}</ref><ref name="MidDayYoungest">{{cite web |url= http://www.mid-day.com/news/2009/mar/100309-News-Mumbai-youngest-ethical-hacker-computer-programmer-Wiz-kid-IT-firm-Hackers.htm |title= India's youngest ethical hacker |author= Vinod Kumar Menon |date= March 10, 2009 |work= [[MiD DAY]] |accessdate= December 26, 2010 }}</ref> known as '''thebluegenius''',<ref name="PacketStormBluegenius">{{cite web |url= http://packetstormsecurity.org/files/author/7857/ |title= Files from thebluegenius |author= Rajshekhar Murthy |date= February 2010 |work= [[Packet Storm]] |accessdate= December 26, 2010 }}</ref><ref name="BlueGenius">{{cite web |url= http://www.thebluegenius.com |title= Rajshekhar Murthy's Official Blog |work= The Blue Genius |accessdate= M D, Y }}</ref> is a science graduate and an ex-employee of [[Microsoft|Microsoft Corporation]], currently head of Information Security at an Indian telecommunications firm.

The need of MalCon conference is bridge that ignored gap between security companies and malcoders. They have to get on a common platform and talk to each other. Just like the concept of ‘ethical hacking’ has helped organizations to see that hackers are not all that bad, it is time to accept that ‘ethical malcoding’ is required to research, identify and mitigate newer malwares in a ‘proactive’ way".'' Rajshekhar Murthy coined new security term “'''ethical malcoding'''” to differentiate between malcoders who work in the background independently or with various security firms for research and those who do it for financial gain; and another term '''"GuuWare"'''<ref name="MalconGuuware">{{cite web |url= http://malcon.org/web/2010/guuware/ |title= GuuWare |date= December 1, 2010 |work= malcon.org |accessdate= December 26, 2010 }}</ref> to describe software’s that may have similar attributes of a malware but are used for defensive purposes. == Controversies == MalCon approach of openly inviting '''"ethical malcoders"''' gained a lot of International attention<ref name="TechgossMedia">{{cite web |url= http://www.techgoss.com/Story/2640S14-Mumbai-MalCon-gets-media.aspx |title= Mumbai MalCon gets media |author= Sameer |date=
