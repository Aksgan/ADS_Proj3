This is also called indentation or "fixed-width" data formatting. Another common convention is to separate columns using one or more [[delimiter]] characters. There are ''many'' different conventions for depicting data such as that above in text. (See e.g., [[Comma-separated values]], [[Delimiter-separated values]], [[Markup language]], [[Programming language]]). Using delimiters incurs some [[Computational overhead|overhead]] in locating them every time they are processed (unlike fixed-width formatting) which may have some [[Computer performance|performance]] implications. However, use of character delimiters (especially commas) is also a crude form of [[data compression]] which may assist overall performance by reducing data volumes - especially for [[data transmission]] purposes. Use of character delimiters which include a length component ([[String literal#Declarative notation|Declarative notation]]) is comparatively rare but vastly reduces the overhead associated with locating the extent of each field. * '''Relational algebra:''' Each row or record in the above table meets the standard definition of a [[tuple]] under [[relational algebra]] (the above example depicts a series of 3-tuples). Additionally, the first row specifies the [[Tuple#Field_names|field names]] that are associated with the values of each row. * '''Database management system:''' Since the formal operations possible with a text file are usually more limited than desired, the text in the above example would ordinarily represent an intermediary state of the data prior to being transferred into a [[database management system]]. == Practical implementations == * [http://www.gnu.org/software/recutils/ GNU Recutils], a set of tools and libraries to access human-editable, text-based databases called recfiles * [[SQLite]], software library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. * [[Berkeley DB]], a robust flat file database for critical applications which supports [[ACID]] transactions * [[Borland Reflex]] * [http://sourceforge.net/projects/textdb TextDB], a file-based database designed to handle high loads.

Flattr is a project started by [[Peter Sunde]] and Linus Olsson. Users are able to pay a small amount every month (minimum 2 [[euro]]s) and then click Flattr buttons on sites to share out the money they paid in among those sites, kind of like an Internet tip jar. (The word "flattr" is used as a verb, to indicate payments through the Flattr system - so when a user clicks a Flattr button and they are logged in to the Flattr site, they are said to be "[[Flattery|flattring]]" the page they are on.) Sunde said, "We want to encourage people to share money as well as content."<ref name=bbc>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8512263.stm | work=BBC News | title=Pirate boss to make the web pay | date=February 12, 2010 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref> In the beginning of the service Flattr itself takes 10% of all the users monthly flatrate, although this fee may be reduced at a later date if the economics permit it.<ref name=bbc/> The service was opened to the general public on 12 August 2010<ref>[http://blog.flattr.com/2010/08/open-beta/ Flattr now open for everyone!]</ref>. In December 2010, Flattr received large-scale attention when it was tweeted to be a method of donating money to Wikileaks, which had recently been cutoff by Paypal, Visa, and Mastercard.<ref>http://eu.techcrunch.com/2010/12/08/wikileaks-continues-to-fund-itself-via-tech-startup-flattr/</ref> == Extensions == As the service relies on [[network effect]] to prove useful, it is necessary that users join and have the opportunity to flattr and be flattr'd. However, due to the young age of the system, the number of supporting platforms is very limited. To foster faster adoption, including on sites that may not natively support Flattr, a Firefox plugin, Överallt (“everywhere” in Swedish) has been developed<ref>{{cite web|url=http://overallt.p4ul.info/|title= Överallt : Flattr Everywhere ! |last=da Silva|first=Paul|date=June 19, 2010|accessdate=June 22, 2010}}</ref>. It allows the equipped browsers to parse a simple plain-text tag (<code>[Flattr=ID]</code>) and replace it inline with the Flattr widget. This extends the range of Flattr, so that not only sites that support Flattr, but all sites, can have Flattr buttons. ===For real-world or non-web content=== Flattr is also being demonstrated as being useful for micro-donations to offline content, including those which are non-computer based, by way of mobile device recognition of [[QR code]]s. A number of existing services<ref>{{cite web|url = http://flattr.com/support/offline/|title = Offline Flattr}}</ref> exist to allow for the "flattr-ing" of non-web-based content, including offline content, using most Android phones' capability of recognizing physical QR codes.
