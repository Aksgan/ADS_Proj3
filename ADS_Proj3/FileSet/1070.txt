more variables, although this can also be done during the main analysis phase.<ref>Adèr, 2008, p. 344.</ref><br /> Possible transformations of variables are:<ref>Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007, p. 87-88.</ref><br /> *Square root transformation (if the distribution differs moderately from normal) *Log-transformation (if the distribution differs substantially from normal) *Inverse transformation (if the distribution differs severely from normal) *Make categorical (ordinal / dichotomous) (if the distribution differs severely from normal, and no transformations help) ===Did the implementation of the study fulfill the intentions of the research design?=== One should check the success of the [[randomization]] procedure, for instance by checking whether background and substantive variables are equally distributed within and across groups. <br /> If the study did not need and/or use a randomization procedure, one should check the success of the non-random sampling, for instance by checking whether all subgroups of the population of interest are represented in sample.<br /> Other possible data distortions that should be checked are: *[[Dropout (electronics)|dropout]] (this should be identified during the initial data analysis phase) *Item [[Response rate|nonresponse]] (whether this is random or not should be assessed during the initial data analysis phase) *Treatment quality (using [[manipulation check]]s).<ref>Adèr, 2008, p. 344-345.</ref> ===Characteristics of data sample=== In any report or article, the structure of the sample must be accurately described. It is especially important to exactly determine the structure of the sample (and specifically the size of the subgroups) when subgroup analyses will be performed during the main analysis phase.<br /> The characteristics of the data sample can be assessed by looking at: *Basic statistics of important variables *Scatter plots *Correlations *Cross-tabulations<ref>Adèr, 2008, p. 345.</ref> ===Final stage of the initial data analysis=== During the final stage, the findings of the initial data analysis are documented, and necessary, preferable, and possible corrective actions are taken.<br /> Also, the original plan for the main data analyses can and should be specified in more detail and/or rewritten.<br /> In order to do this, several decisions about the main data analyses can and should be made: *In the case of non-[[Normal distribution|normal]]s: should one [[Data transformation (statistics)|transform]] variables; make variables categorical (ordinal/dichotomous); adapt the analysis method? *In the case of [[missing data]]: should one neglect or impute the missing data; which imputation technique should be used? *In the case of [[outlier]]s: should one use robust analysis techniques? *In case items do not fit the scale: should one adapt the measurement instrument by omitting items, or rather ensure comparability with other (uses of the) measurement instrument(s)? *In the case of (too) small subgroups: should one drop the hypothesis about inter-group differences, or use small sample techniques, like exact tests or bootstrapping? *In case the [[randomization]] procedure seems to be defective: can and should one calculate [[propensity score]]s and include them as covariates in the main analyses?<ref>Adèr, 2008, p. 345-346.</ref> ===Analyses=== Several analyses can be used during the initial data analysis phase:<ref>Adèr, 2008, p. 346-347.</ref><br /> *Univariate statistics *Bivariate associations (correlations) *Graphical techniques (scatter plots) It is important to take the measurement levels of the variables into account for the analyses, as special statistical techniques are available for each level:<ref>Adèr, 2008, p. 349-353.</ref> *Nominal and ordinal variables **Frequency counts (numbers and percentages) **Associations ***circumambulations (crosstabulations) ***hierarchical loglinear analysis (restricted to a maximum of 8 variables) ***loglinear analysis (to identify relevant/important variables and possible confounders) **Exact tests or bootstrapping (in case subgroups are small) **Computation of new variables *Continuous variables **Distribution ***Statistics (M, SD, variance, skewness, kurtosis) ***Stem-and-leaf displays ***Box plots ==Main data analysis== In the main analysis phase analyses aimed at answering the research question are performed as well as any other relevant analysis needed to write the first draft of the research report. <ref>Adèr, 2008, p. 363.</ref> ===Exploratory and confirmatory approaches=== In the main analysis phase either an exploratory or confirmatory approach can be adopted. Usually the approach is decided before data is collected. In an exploratory analysis no clear hypothesis is stated before analysing the data, and the data is searched for models that describe the data well. In a confirmatory analysis clear hypotheses about the data are tested. Exploratory analyses should be interpretative carefully. When testing multiple models at once there is a high chance on finding at least one of them to be significant, but this can be due to a [[type 1 error]]. It is important to always adjust the significance level when testing multiple models with, for example, a [[bonferroni correction]]. Also, one should not follow up an exploratory analysis with a confirmatory analysis in the same dataset. An exploratory analysis is used to find ideas for a theory, but not to test that theory as well. When a model is found exploratory in a dataset, then following up that analysis with a comfirmatory analysis in the same dataset could simply mean that the results of the comfirmatory analysis are due to the same [[type 1 error]] that resulted in the exploratory model in the first place. The comfirmatory analysis therefore will not be more informative than the original exploratory analysis.<ref>Adèr, 2008, p. 361-362.</ref> ===Stability of results=== It is important to obtain some indication about how generalizable the results are<ref>Adèr, 2008, p. 368-371.</ref>. While this is hard to check, one can look at the stability of the results. Are the results reliable and reproducible? There are two main ways of doing this: * [[Crossvalidation]]: By splitting the data in multiple parts we can check if analyzes (like a fitted model) based on one part of the data generalize to another part of the data as well. * [[Sensitivity analysis]]: A procedure to study the behavior of a system or model when global parameters are (systematically) varied. One way to do this is with [[bootstrapping (statistics)]]. ===Statistical methods=== A lot of statistical methods have been used for statistical analyses. A very brief list of four of the more popular methods is: * [[General linear model]]: A widely used model on which various statistical methods are based (e.g. [[t test]] [[ANOVA]] [[ANCOVA]] [[MANOVA]]). Usable for assessing the effect of
