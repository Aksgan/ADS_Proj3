If the motherboard has two pairs of differently colored DIMM sockets (the colors indicate which bank they belong to, bank 0 or bank 1), then one can place a matched pair of memory modules in bank 0, but a different-capacity pair of modules in bank 1, as long as they are of the same speed. Using this scheme, a pair of 1 [[gigabyte|GB]] memory modules in bank 0 and a pair of matched 512 MB modules in bank 1 would be acceptable for dual-channel operation.<ref name="Kingston520DDR">{{cite web | author = Infineon Technologies North America Corporation and Kingston Technology Company, Inc. | month = September | year = 2003 | url = http://www.kingston.com/newtech/MKF_520DDRwhitepaper.pdf | title = "Intel Dual-Channel DDR Memory Architecture White Paper", Rev. 1.0 | format = PDF, 1021 [[kilobyte|KB]] | publisher = Kingston Technology | accessdate = 2007-09-06 }}</ref> Modules rated at different speeds can be run in dual-channel mode, although the motherboard will then run all memory modules at the speed of the slowest module. Some motherboards, however, have compatibility issues with certain brands or models of memory when attempting to use them in dual-channel mode. For this reason, it is generally advised to use identical pairs of memory modules, which is why most memory manufacturers now sell "kits" of matched-pair [[DIMM]]s. Several motherboard manufacturers only support configurations where a "matched pair" of modules are used. A matching pair needs to match in: * Capacity (e.g. 1024 MB). Certain Intel chipsets support different capacity chips in what they call Flex Mode: the capacity that can be matched is run in dual-channel, while the remainder runs in single-channel. * Speed (e.g. PC5300). If speed is not the same, the lower speed of the two modules will be used. Likewise, the higher latency of the two modules will be used. * Number of chips and sides (e.g. 2 sides with 4 chips on each side). Dual-channel architecture is a technology implemented on motherboards by the motherboard manufacturer and does not apply to memory modules. Theoretically any matched pair of memory modules may be used in either single- or dual-channel operation, provided the motherboard supports this architecture. == Purpose == [[Image:ram bottleneck.gif|frame|Graphic illustrating bottleneck between CPU, RAM, and other peripherals]] Dual-channel technology was created to address the issue of [[Von_Neumann_architecture#von_Neumann_bottleneck|bottleneck]]s. Increased processor speed and performance requires other, less prominent components to keep pace. In the case of dual channel design, the intended target is the memory controller, which regulates data flow between the CPU and system memory (RAM). The memory controller determines the types and speeds of RAM as well as the maximum size of each individual memory module and the overall memory capacity of the system. However, when the memory is unable to keep up with the processor, a bottleneck occurs, leaving the CPU with nothing to process. Under the single-channel architecture, any CPU with a bus speed greater than the memory speed would be susceptible to this bottleneck effect. The dual-channel configuration alleviates the problem by doubling the amount of available memory bandwidth. Instead of a single memory channel, a second parallel channel is added. With two channels working simultaneously, the bottleneck is reduced. Rather than wait for memory technology to improve, dual-channel architecture simply takes the existing RAM technology and improves the method in which it is handled. While the actual implementation differs between [[Intel]] and [[AMD]] motherboards, the basic theory stands. == Performance == There have been varying reports as to the performance increase of dual-channel configurations, with some tests citing significant performance gains while others suggest almost no gain. [[Tom's Hardware]] found little significant difference between single-channel and dual-channel configurations in synthetic and gaming benchmarks (using a "modern" system setup). In its tests, dual channel gave at best a 5% speed increase in memory-intensive tasks.<ref>[http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/PARALLEL-PROCESSING,1705-15.html Parallel Processing, Part 2: RAM and HDD | Tom's Hardware<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Another comparison by laptoplogic.com resulted in a similar conclusion for integrated graphics.<ref>[http://laptoplogic.com/resources/detail.php?id=20 Intel's Sonoma Platform: Dual Channel Performance]</ref> The test results published by Tom's Hardware had a discrete graphics comparison. The difference can be far more significant in applications that manipulate large amounts of data in memory. A comparison by [[TechConnect Magazine]] demonstrated considerable gains for dual-channel in tasks using [[Memory pool|block sizes]] greater than 4 MB, and during [[stream processing]] by the CPU.<ref>[http://www.tcmagazine.com/articles.php?action=show&id=128&perpage=1&pagenum=11 TechConnect Magazine - The Battle of the Channel - Dual vs Single]</ref>{{Dead link|date=July 2010}} == Ganged vs Unganged == Dual-channel was originally conceived as a way to maximize memory throughput by combining two 64-bit buses into a single 128-bit bus. This is retrospectively called the "ganged" mode. However, due to lackluster performance gains in consumer applications as discussed above, more modern implementations of dual-channel use the "unganged" mode by default, which maintains two 64-bit memory buses but allows independent access to each channel, in support of [[Multithreading (computer architecture)|multithreading]] with [[multi-core processor]]s. == See also == * [[List of device bandwidths]] * [[Triple-channel architecture]] == References == {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/cs-011965.htm Single, dual, triple and flex memory modes] [[Category:Computer memory]] [[ca:Dual channel]] [[de:Dual Channel]] [[es:Doble canal]] [[fr:Canal double]] [[ko:듀얼 채널]] [[it:Dual channel]] [[ja:デュアルチャネル]] [[pl:Dual channel]] [[ru:Двухканальный режим]] [[zh:雙通道]]</text> </page> <page> <id>11144</id> <title>Dual Sector model</title> <text>{{About|the economic model|the diagram representing atomic bonding|Lewis structure}} {{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}} The '''Dual Sector model''', or the '''Lewis model''', is a model in [[Development economics|Developmental economics]] that explains the growth of a developing economy in terms of a [[labour (economics)|labour]] transition between two sectors, a traditional agricultural sector and a modern industrial sector. ==History== Initially enumerated in an article entitled "Economic Development with Unlimited Supplies of Labor" written in
