Its [[Hamel dimension|dimension]] is equal to the [[Rank (linear algebra)|rank]] of the matrix and is at most min(''m'',''n'').<ref>http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/CliffsReviewTopic/Row-Space-and-Column-Space-of-a-Matrix.topicArticleId-20807,articleId-20793.html</ref> ==Overview== Let A be a n by m matrix. Then :1. rank(A) = dim(rowsp(A)) = dim(colsp(A)), :2. rank(A) = number of pivots in any echelon form of A, :3. rank(A) = the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns of A. If one considers the matrix as a [[linear transformation]] from '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>, then the column space of the matrix equals the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of this linear transformation. The column space of a matrix A is the set of all linear combinations of the columns in A. If A = ['''a'''<sub>1</sub>, ...., '''a'''<sub>n</sub>], then colsp(A) = span {'''a'''<sub>1</sub>, ...., '''a'''<sub>n</sub>}. The concept of '''row space''' generalises to matrices to '''C''', the field of [[complex number]]s, or to any [[field (mathematics)|field]]. Intuitively, given a matrix '''A''', the action of the matrix '''A''' on a vector '''x''' will return a linear combination of the columns of '''A''' weighted by the coordinates of '''x''' as coefficients. Another way to look at this is that it will (1) first project '''x''' into the '''row space''' of A, (2) perform an invertible transformation, and (3) place the resulting vector '''y''' in the '''column space''' of '''A'''. Thus the result ''' y =A x''' must reside in the '''column space''' of A. See the [[singular value decomposition]] for more details on this second interpretation. ==Example== Given a matrix J: :<math> J = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4 & 1 & 3 & 2\\ -1 & -2 & 1 & 0 & 5\\ 1 & 6 & 2 & 2 & 2\\ 3 & 6 & 2 & 5 & 1 \end{bmatrix} </math> the rows are '''r'''<sub>1</sub> = (2,4,1,3,2), '''r'''<sub>2</sub> = (−1,−2,1,0,5), '''r'''<sub>3</sub> = (1,6,2,2,2), '''r'''<sub>4</sub> = (3,6,2,5,1). Consequently the row space of J is the subspace of '''R'''<sup>5</sup> [[linear span|spanned]] by { '''r'''<sub>1</sub>, '''r'''<sub>2</sub>, '''r'''<sub>3</sub>, '''r'''<sub>4</sub> }. Since these four row vectors are [[Linear independence|linearly independent]], the row space is 4-dimensional. Moreover in this case it can be seen that they are all [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] to the vector '''n''' = (6,−1,4,−4,0), so it can be deduced that the row space consists of all vectors in '''R'''<sup>5</sup> that are orthogonal to '''n'''. ==See also== *[[Row space]] *[[Column space]] *[[null space]] ==External links== {{wikibooks|Linear Algebra/Column and Row Spaces}} *[http://mfile.akamai.com/7870/rm/mitstorage.download.akamai.com/7870/18/18.06/videolectures/strang-1806-lec06-20sep1999-80k.rm Lecture on column space and nullspace by Gilbert Strang of MIT] *[http://wps.prenhall.com/am_leon_linearalg_7/53/13727/3514210.cw/content/index.html Row Space and Column Space] ==Notes== {{reflist}} [[Category:Abstract algebra]] [[Category:Linear algebra]] [[it:Spazi delle righe e delle colonne]] [[nl:Kolom- en rijruimte]] [[ur:قطار اور ستون فضا]] [[zh:行空间与列空间]]</text> </page> <page> <id>32523</id> <title>Royal Meteorological Society</title> <text>The '''Royal Meteorological Society''' traces its origins back to 3 April 1850 when the British Meteorological Society was formed as ''a society the objects of which should be the advancement and extension of meteorological science by determining the laws of climate and of meteorological phenomena in general''. Along with nine others, including [[James Glaisher]], John Drew, [[Edward Joseph Lowe]], [[Joseph Bancroft Reade|The Revd Joseph Bancroft Reade]], and Samuel Charles Whitbread, [[John Lee (astronomer)|Dr John Lee]], an astronomer, of [[Hartwell House, Buckinghamshire|Hartwell House]], near [[Aylesbury]], [[Buckinghamshire]] founded in the library of his house the British Meteorological Society, which became the Royal Meteorological Society.<ref>[http://www.rmets.org/pdf/metsocearlymembers.pdf Early members of the society]</ref> It became The Meteorological Society in 1866, when it was incorporated by [[Royal Charter]], and the Royal Meteorological Society in 1883, when Her Majesty [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] granted the privilege of adding 'Royal' to the title. Along with 74 others, the famous meteorologist [[Luke Howard]] joined the original 15 members of the Society at its first ordinary meeting on 7 May 1850. As of 2008 it has more than 3,000 members worldwide. The Chief Executive of the Society is Professor Paul Hardaker<ref>[http://www.rmets.org/faq.php RMetS website FAQ]</ref>. ==Mission== Advancing the understanding of weather and climate, the science and its applications, for the benefit of all. ==Membership== Membership is open to anyone with an interest in meteorology or related sciences. Associate Fellows may be any age and do not require any specific expertise in meteorology. Fellows normally require a formal qualification in a subject related to meteorology plus five years experience and must be nominated by two other fellows. ===Benefits of membership=== Both Fellows and Associate Fellows receive the monthly magazine ''Weather''. They may also attend, free of charge, meetings arranged by the Society and are eligible for travel and conference bursaries and to be proposed for awards and prizes. Fellowship of the Society is a formal statement of professional competence and those elected to it are entitled to use the title Fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society (FRMetS). Both Associate Fellows and Fellows can vote at the Annual General Meeting and Special General Meetings. Members of the Society also have the opportunity to become involved in the many varied and interesting areas of work of the Society. ==Programmes of work== The Society has a very broad programme of work including: * developing education resources for primary and secondary schools and for teacher [[Continuing professional development|CPD]] * promoting public engagement and dialogue on weather and climate science * providing evidence-based policy support to Government * encouraging continuing professional development (through [[National Vocational Qualification|NVQ]]/[[Scottish Vocational Qualification|SVQ]]) and offering professional accreditation as a Chartered Meteorologist (CMet) * awarding grants and bursaries to young scientists working in meteorology * recognising excellence through the programme of international awards and prizes *
