Here are some facts: * Every [[Hausdorff space]] is locally Hausdorff. * Every locally Hausdorff space is [[T1 space|T<sub>1</sub>]]. * There are locally Hausdorff spaces where a sequence has more than one limit. This can never happen for a Hausdorff space. * The [[non-Hausdorff manifold|bug-eyed line]] is locally Hausdorff (it is in fact [[locally metrizable]]) but not Hausdorff. * The [[etale space]] for the [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] of differentiable functions on a [[differential manifold]] is not Hausdorff, but it is locally Hausdorff. * A T<sub>1</sub> space need not be locally Hausdorff; an example of this is an infinite set given the [[cofinite topology]]. * Let ''X'' be a set given the particular point topology. Then ''X'' is locally Hausdorff at precisely one point. From the last example, it will follow that a set (with more than one point) given the [[particular point topology]] is not a [[topological group]]. Note that if ''x'' is the 'particular point' of ''X'', and y is distinct from ''x'', then any set containing ''y'' that doesn't also contain ''x'' inherits the discrete topology and is therefore Hausdorff. However, no neighbourhood of ''y'' is actually Hausdorff so that the space cannot be locally Hausdorff at ''y''. * If ''G'' is a topological group that is locally Hausdorff at ''x'' for some point ''x'' of ''G'', then ''G'' is Hausdorff. This follows from that fact that if ''y'' is a point of ''G'', there exists a homeomorphism from ''G'' to itself carrying ''x'' to ''y'', so ''G'' is locally Hausdorff at every point, and is therefore T<sub>1</sub> (and T<sub>1</sub> topological groups are Hausdorff). ==See also== * [[Hausdorff space]] {{topology-stub}} [[Category:Topology]] [[Category:Properties of topological spaces]]</text> </page> <page> <id>22486</id> <title>Locally weighted regression</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=February 2009}} {{Context|date=October 2009}} In [[machine learning]], '''locally weighted regression''' is a [[memory]]-based method that performs a regression around a point of interest using only training data that are local to that point. ==See also== *[[Least squares|Weighted least squares]] ==External links== * [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume4/cohn96a-html/node7.html locally weighted regression in CMU] {{DEFAULTSORT:Locally Weighted Regression}} [[Category:Machine learning]] {{comp-sci-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>22489</id> <title>Location-based authentication</title> <text>{{notability|date|October 2010|date=October 2010}} {{orphan|date=May 2010}} '''Location based authentication''' is a special procedure to prove an individual's identity and authenticity on appearance simply by detecting its presence at a distinct location. To enable location based authentication, a special combination of objects is required. * Firsthand, the individual that applies for being identified and authenticated has to present a sign of identity. * Secondly, the individual has to carry at least one human authentication factor that may be recognized on the distinct location. * Thirdly, the distinct location must be equipped with a resident means that is capable to determine the coincidence of individual at this distinct location. == Distinctiveness of locating == Basic requirement for safe location based authentication is a well defined separation of locations as well as an equally well defined proximity of the applying individual to this location. == Applications == * Location based authentication is a standard procedure to grant access to an area by detecting a person at an entrance. Then of course a discrimination is recommended to recognise a person entering or leaving, just to prevent two persons gaining access on one ticket only. * Location based authentication is a standard procedure to get access to a machine, especially a working position with a computer and the functions of this computer <ref>[http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?wo=2006103387&IA=GB2006000856&DISPLAY=DESC LOCATION BASED AUTHENTICATION]</ref>. * Location based authentication is a novel procedure to provide additional information about the authenticity of a product <ref>[http://www.autoidlabs.org/single-view/dir/article/6/284/page.html Probabilistic Approach for Location-Based Authentication]</ref>. == Challenges == {{As of|2008}}, no offered technical solution for simple location based authentication includes a method for limiting the granted access to the presence, hence terminating the granted authentication on leave.
