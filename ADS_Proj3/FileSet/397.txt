manner. == Example == The goal is to calculate the Bayesian average of the heights of various occupations of adult American men. In the larger population of adult American men, the [[average height]] is 176 cm. A value of ''C'' is chosen as 10. For the purpose of this example, the occupations used will be "Basketball Players", "Actors" and "Students". For the basketball players, a group of 15 individuals are identified with an average height of 191 cm among them. For the students, a group of 10 individuals is identified with an average height of 179 cm. For the actors, only [[James Cromwell]] is available, for an average height of 201 cm. {| border="1" rules="all" !Group !''N'' !Group [[mean]] !Bayesian average |- |Basketball players |15 |191 cm |185 cm |- |Students |10 |179 cm |177.5 cm |- |Actors |1 |201 cm |178 cm |} Here, the Bayesian average correctly reduces the effect of a single anomalously large value. If the sample sizes for basketball players were similarly small, the Bayesian average would have mis-estimated basketball players as being far closer to average. == See also == * [[Additive smoothing]] [[Category:Bayesian statistics]] {{statistics-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>3494</id> <title>BbLean</title> <text>{{lowercase|title=bbLean}} {{Infobox_Software |name = bbLean |logo = |screenshot = |caption = |developer = |latest_release_version = 1.17.1 | latest_release_date = {{release date and age|2009|12|08}} |operating_system = [[Microsoft Windows]] |genre = [[Windows shell replacement]] |license = |website = http://bb4win.sourceforge.net/bblean/ }} '''bbLean''' is a [[Shell (computing)|shell]] replacement for [[Microsoft Windows]]. It is a development branch of [[BB4Win]], and like that shell, it has a minimalist look. bbLean deviates slightly from the minimalist intent of its parent by offering added functionality while retaining the basic simplicity of BB4Win. Despite this added functionality, the stated goal of the developers is to produce a ''lean'' shell (the name is an abbreviation for "[[Blackbox]] Lean"), one that offers more core features than the parent shell while improving shell speed and restraining system overhead. As a result, bbLean has gained a reputation as a shell that works better than BB4Win or [[Xoblite]] on older PCs and older versions of Windows. The shell is extensible by the myriad of plugins that exist, and some extensive mods have been created. [http://www.lostinthebox.com/viewtopic.php?t=2286 bbClean] is a rewrite of former mod [http://www.lostinthebox.com/viewtopic.php?t=2108 bbLean 1.16z]; along with improvements upon 1.16z's operation, it includes several new features (e.g. volume bars, menu icon support) and customization options (e.g. expanded transparency options and text shadows); there is a fork of bbClean called [http://utbox.weebly.com/ utbox]. Another such mod is [http://www.lostinthebox.com/viewtopic.php?p=11681#11681 bbLean Mod], which adds aesthetic elements such as new bullets and text shadows. bbLean is not under active development and the forum's admins have all left.

BFS was developed by [[Dominic Giampaolo]] and [[Cyril Meurillon]] over a ten month period, starting in September 1996,<ref name="practical-book">{{cite book | last=Giampaolo | first=Dominic | year=1999 | url=http://www.nobius.org/~dbg/practical-file-system-design.pdf | title=Practical File System Design with the Be File System | publisher=Morgan Kaufmann | isbn=1-55860-497-9 | format=PDF}}</ref> to provide [[BeOS]] with a modern [[64-bit]] capable [[journaling file system]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/03/29/windows_on_a_database_sliced/ | title=Windows on a database – sliced and diced by BeOS vets | author=Andrew Orlowski | date=2002-03-29 | publisher=The Register | accessdate=2006-12-09}}</ref> It is [[case sensitive]] and capable of being used on [[floppy]], [[hard disk]]s and read-only media such as [[CD-ROM]]s, although its use on small removable media is not advised, as the file system headers consume from 600KB to 2MB, rendering floppy disks virtually useless. Like its predecessor, OFS (Old Be File System, written by [[Benoit Schillings]], was also called BFS when current),<ref name="bortmaninterview">{{cite web | url=http://www.birdhouse.org/beos/bible/bos/int_schillings.html | title=Benoît Schillings, Software Engineer | author=Henry Bortman | work=The BeOS Bible | accessdate=2006-09-10}}</ref> it includes support for extended file attributes ([[Metadata (computing)|metadata]]) with indexing and querying characteristics to provide functionality similar to that of a [[relational database]]. Whilst intended as a 64-bit capable file system, the size of some on-disk structures mean that practical size limit is approximately 2 exabytes. Similarly the extent based file allocation reduces the maximum practical file size to approximately 260 gigabytes at best and as little as a few blocks in a pathological worst case, depending on the degree of [[file system fragmentation|fragmentation]]. Its design process, [[application programming interface]], and internal workings are, for the most part, documented in the book ''Practical File System Design with the Be File System''.<ref name="practical-book" /> ==Implementations== In addition to the original 1996 BFS used in [[BeOS]], there are several implementations for [[Linux]]. In early 1999, Makoto Kato developed a Be File System driver for Linux; however, the driver never
