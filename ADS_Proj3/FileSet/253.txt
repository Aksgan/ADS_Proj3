led to failures in the Apple III. Among them was the ProDOS operating system, which was based on Apple III's Sophisticated Operating System (SOS). ===Apple IIc=== {{Main|Apple IIc}} [[Image:Apple iicb.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Apple IIc was Apple's first compact and portable computer.]] Apple released the '''[[Apple IIc]]''' in April 1984, billing it as a portable Apple II, because it could be easily carried, though unlike modern [[portable computer|portables]] it lacked a built-in display and battery. The IIc even sported a carrying handle that folded down to prop the machine up into a typing position. It was the first of three Apple II models to be made in the [[Snow White design language]], and the only one that used its unique creamy off-white color.<ref>"Kunkel, Paul, AppleDesign: The work of the Apple Industrial Design Group, with photographs by Rick English, New York: Graphis, 1997, p.30</ref> (The other Snow White computers from the Apple II series, the II<small>GS</small> and the IIc Plus, were light gray, called "Platinum" by Apple.) The Apple IIc was the first Apple II to use the [[WDC 65C02|65C02]] low-power variant of the 6502 processor, and featured a built-in 5.25-inch floppy drive and 128 kB RAM, with a built-in disk controller that could control external drives, composite video (NTSC or PAL), serial interfaces for modem and printer, and a port usable by either a joystick or mouse. Unlike previous Apple II models, the IIc had no internal expansion slots at all, this being the means by which its compact size was attained. Third parties did eventually figure out how to wedge up to 1 MB of additional memory and a real-time clock into the machine, and a later revision of the motherboard provided an expansion slot that could accept an Apple memory card bearing up to 1 MB of RAM. The disk port, originally intended for a second 5.25-inch floppy drive, eventually was able to interface to 3½-inch disk drives and (via third parties) even hard disks. To play up the portability, two different monochrome [[LCD]] displays were sold for use with the IIc's video expansion port, although both were short-lived due to high cost and poor legibility. (An Apple IIc with the smaller of these displays appeared briefly in the film ''[[2010 (film)|2010]]''.) The IIc had an external power supply that converted AC power to 12 V DC, allowing third parties to offer battery packs and automobile power adapters that connected in place of the supplied AC adapter. The Apple IIc (in its American version) was the first microcomputer to include support for the [[Dvorak Simplified Keyboard]], which was activated using a switch above the keyboard. This feature was also later found in late-model American Apple IIe computers (though the switch was inside the computer) and in the Apple II<small>GS</small> (accessible via the built-in control panel). The international models used the same mechanism to switch between the localized and the American keyboard layouts, but did not offer Dvorak. ===Apple II<small>GS</small>=== {{Main|Apple IIGS}} [[Image:Apple IIGS.jpg|right|thumb|150|The Apple IIGS, the most powerful Apple II, featuring a true 16-bit CPU, 4096 colors, Ensoniq synthesizer, a Mac-like GUI and a mouse.]] [[Image:Apple iigs.jpg|right|thumb|150|The Apple IIGS setup, with keyboard and mouse shown.]] The next member of the line was the '''[[Apple IIGS|Apple II<small>GS</small>]]''' computer, released on September 15, 1986. A radical departure from the existing Apple II line, the II<small>GS</small> featured a true [[16-bit]] microprocessor, the [[WDC 65816/65802|65C816]], operating at {{nowrap|2.8 MHz}} with 24-bit addressing, allowing expansion up to 8 MB of RAM without the bank-switching hassles of the earlier machines (RAM cards with more than 4 MB were never directly supported by Apple<ref>Regan, Joe. ''A2Pro Roundtable'', October 1991, Category 16, Topic 2.</ref>). It introduced two completely new graphic modes sporting higher resolutions and a palette of 4,096 colors; however, only 4 (at 640×200 resolution) or 16 (at 320×200 resolution) colors could be used on a single line at a time, although a technique known as ''[[dither]]ing'' was often employed in software to increase the number of perceived colors.<ref name="making">Duprau, Jeanne, and Tyson, Molly. "The Making of the Apple IIGS", ''A+ Magazine'', November 1986: 57-74.</ref> In a departure from earlier Apple II graphics modes, the new modes laid out the scanlines sequentially in memory. However, programmers in search of a graphics challenge could always turn to 3200-color mode, which involved precisely swapping in a different 16-color palette for each of the screen's 200 scanlines as the monitor's electron beam traced the screen line by line. This exotic technique did not leave many CPU cycles available for other processing, so this "mode" was best suited to displaying static images. The Apple II<small>GS</small> stood out from any previous (or future) Apple II models, evolving and advancing the platform into the next generation of computing while still maintaining near-complete backward compatibility. The secret of the Apple II<small>GS</small>'s compatibility was a single chip called the [[Mega II]], which contained the functional equivalent of an entire Apple IIe computer (sans processor). This, combined with the flawless 65C02 emulation mode of the 65C816 processor, provided full support for legacy software. The computer also included a 32-voice [[Ensoniq]] [[Ensoniq 5503|5503]], '[[wavetable synthesis|wavetable']] [[sample-based synthesis|sample-based music synthesizer]] chip with 64 kB dedicated RAM,<ref>{{cite web|title=Apple IIGS|url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=71|author=Old-Computers.com Museum|year=|accessdate=2006-11-16}}</ref> 256 kB of standard RAM, built-in peripheral ports (switchable between IIe-style card slots and IIc-style onboard controllers for disk drives, mouse, RGB video, and serial devices), built-in [[AppleTalk]] networking, and a ROM toolbox that supported a graphical user interface derived from the Macintosh toolbox. The computer could run existing 8-bit Apple II software (including software written for the very first Apple II in Integer BASIC), but also supported 16-bit software running under a new OS first called ProDOS 16 and later called GS/OS.<ref name="making"/> The new OS eventually included a Finder that could be used for managing disks and files and opening documents and applications, along with desk accessories — just like the Macintosh. The 16-bit operating system would automatically switch to the text display and downshift to 8-bit mode to run legacy software, while offering a consistent, Macintosh-like graphical
