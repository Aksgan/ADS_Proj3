One is a [[Multiprocessing| Tighly-coupled Capability System]] (TCS) which has 104 Power 6 nodes, wherein each node contains 32 cores (4.7 GHz) and 128 GiB RAM. Theoretical peak is 60 [[TFLOPS| TFlops]] and 14 TiB of RAM. The second is the General Purpose Cluster (GPC) which has 30,240 cores of an Intel [[Nehalem (microarchitecture)|Nehalem]]-based processor, each with 2GiB RAM. Theoretical peak is 306 TFlops and 60 TiB of RAM. The computer room itself is {{convert|3000|sqft|m2}} on a raised floor. IT has a 735 ton chiller and cooling towers for “free-air” cooling. A significant research area that will be addressed using the SciNet machines is that of climate change and global warming, which is why creating one of the greenest datacenters in the world was of key importance in this project. A traditional datacenter generally uses 33% of the energy going into its centre for cooling and other non-computing power consumption; however, SciNet and IBM have successfully created a centre that uses less than 20% towards these areas. == Partners == ;Founding Institution * [[University of Toronto]] ;Affiliated Hospitals * [[Hospital for Sick Children|Hospital for Sick Kids]] * [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Toronto)|Mount Sinai Hospital]] * [http://www.oicr.on.ca/ Ontario Institute for Cancer Research] * [[Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Care]] ==Common uses== {{Wikinews|Canada's supercomputer goes online}} The U of T supercomputer which can perform 300 trillion calculations per second will be used for highly calculation-intensive tasks such as problems involving [[quantum mechanical physics]], [[weather forecasting]], climate research, climate change models, [[computational chemistry|molecular modeling]] (computing the structures and properties of chemical compounds, biological [[macromolecules]], polymers, and crystals), physical simulations (such as simulation of the [[big bang]] theory in conjunction with the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) in [[CERN]], [[Geneva]] which will produce cataclysmic conditions that will mimic the beginning of time,and the U of T supercomputer will examine the particle collisions.<Ref name="AHN UT"/><ref name="CBC June"/><Ref name="UofT"/> Part of the collaboration with LHC will be to answer questions about why matter has mass and what comprises the Universe's mass? Additional areas of research will be models of greenhouse gas-induced global warming and the effect on Arctic sea ice. The international ATLAS project will be explored by the new supercomputer to discover forces which govern the universe.<Ref name="world">{{cite web | title = IBM Supercomputer at University of Toronto Is Canada's Most Powerful | work = Newswire | publisher = CNW Group Ltd. | date = June 18, 2009 | url = http://newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/June2009/18/c7981.html | accessdate = 2009-06-18}} </ref> ==References== {{reflist}} == External links == * [http://www.scinet.utoronto.ca SciNet HPC Consortium] – Official website * [http://www.top500.org/lists/2008/11 Top 500 List] – November 2008 * [http://www.news.utoronto.ca/campus-news/u-of-t-to-acquire-canadas-most-powerful-supercomputer-from-ibm.html UofT’s Official Announcement of IBM contract] – August 2008 [[Category:Supercomputer sites]] [[Category:University of Toronto]] [[Category:Computer science institutes]] [[Category:Parallel computing]] [[de:SciNet Consortium]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33329</id> <title>SciPlore MindMapping</title> <text>{{Infobox software | name = SciPlore MindMapping | logo = [[Image:SPLMM_Logo.png|thumb]] | screenshot = [[Image:Screenshot-large.png|thumb]] | developer = Jöran Beel, Christoph Müller, Bela Gipp | latest_release_version = SciPlore MindMapping Beta 13 | latest_release_date = {{release date|2010|12|09}} | operating_system = [[Cross-platform]] | platform = [[Java platform|Java]] | genre = [[Science]] and [[Research]] | license = [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] | website = [http://www.sciplore.org/software/sciplore_mindmapping/] }} '''SciPlore MindMapping''' is a [[mind mapping]] application written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. It is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]] and based on the open source software [[FreeMind]]. The focus of SciPlore MindMapping is on combining mind maps with PDF and reference management. It is especially suited for the needs of researchers and scientists as it offers four unique features.<ref name=heise>{{Citation | contribution=SciPlore MindMapping auf Heise| contribution-url=http://www.heise.de/software/download/sciplore_mindmapping_ehemals_freemind_scholar/65482 | title=SciPlore MindMapping (ehemals FreeMind Scholar) Beta 11 | year=2010, September}}</ref>: * Adding Reference Keys Manually: With this feature, researchers can assign a reference key to the node of a mind map. This way researchers can reference their sources from within the mind map. * Adding Reference Keys (BibTeX) Automatically: If a file (e.g. PDF) is linked from a mind map and the same file is linked in the bibliographic database (BibTeX), SciPlore MindMapping extracts the BibTeX key and assigns it to the corresponding node in the mind map. * PDF Bookmark Import: When a user drag&drops a PDF to a mind map, all bookmarks of the PDF are imported as separate nodes and each of the nodes is linked to the PDF file. * PDF Monitoring: When new PDFs are stored in a folder on the user's hard drive, these PDFs are listed in the mind map. SciPlore MindMapping is supposed to be the first mind mapping tool that integrates mind mapping with reference management and enables the import of PDF bookmarks.<ref name=boukobza09>{{Citation | first=Philippe | last=Boukubza | contribution=SciPlore MindMapping | contribution-url=http://www.visual-mapping.com/2009/11/based-on-freemind-and-free-sciplore.html | title=Visual Mapping: Mind Mapping, Design and Social Media | year=2009, November}}</ref> The software maintains a compatible file format to [[FreeMind]] 0.9. == See also == * [[Mind map]] * [[List of mind mapping software]] * [[Information retrieval]] == References == {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.sciplore.org/software/sciplore_mindmapping/ Official Homepage of SciPlore MindMapping] *[https://sourceforge.net/projects/splmm/ Project Homepage on SourceForge] [[Category:Java platform software]] [[Category:Mind-mapping software]] [[Category:Mac OS software]] [[Category:Free notetaking software]] [[Category:Free software programmed in Java]] [[de:SciPlore MindMapping]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33331</id> <title>SciTech SNAP</title> <text>'''SciTech SNAP''' (System Neutral Access Protocol) is an operating system portable, dynamically loadable, native-size 32-bit/64-bit device driver architecture.
