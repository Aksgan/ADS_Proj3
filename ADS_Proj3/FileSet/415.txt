is where both firms are pricing at marginal cost. Another way of thinking about it, a simpler way, is to imagine if both firms set equal prices above marginal cost, firms would get half the market at a higher than MC price. However, by lowering prices just slightly, a firm could gain the whole market, so both firms are tempted to lower prices as much as they can. It would be irrational to price below marginal cost, because the firm would make a loss. Therefore, both firms will lower prices until they reach the MC limit. == Implications == * Note that [[collusion|colluding]] to charge the [[monopoly]] price and supplying one half of the market each is the best that the firms could do in this set up. However not colluding and charging [[marginal cost]], which is the non-cooperative outcome is the only [[Nash equilibrium]] of this model. * If one firm has lower average cost (a superior [[production function|production technology]]), it will charge the highest price that is lower than the average cost of the other one (i.e. a price ''just'' below the lowest price the other firm can manage) and take all the business. This is known as [[limit price|"limit pricing"]] == Bertrand competition versus [[Cournot competition]]== * Bertrand predicts a duopoly is enough to push prices down to marginal cost level; a duopoly will result in an outcome exactly equivalent to what prevails under perfect competition. * Neither model is necessarily "better." The accuracy of the predictions of each model will vary from industry to industry, depending on the closeness of each model to the industry situation. * If capacity and output can be easily changed, Bertrand is generally a better model of duopoly competition. Or, if output and capacity are difficult to adjust, then Cournot is generally a better model. * Under some conditions the Cournot model can be recast as a two stage model, where in the first stage firms choose capacities, and in the second they compete in Bertrand fashion. == Critical analysis of the Bertrand model == * The classic Bertrand model assumes firms compete purely on price, ignoring non-price competition. Firms can [[product differentiation|differentiate]] their products and charge a higher price. For example, would someone travel twice as far to save 1% on the price of their vegetables? The Bertrand model can be extended to include product or location differentiation but then the main result - that price is driven down to marginal cost - no longer holds. * The model ignores capacity constraints. If a single firm does not have the capacity to supply the whole market then the "price equals marginal cost" result may not hold. * The classical model only focuses on the pure strategy Nash equilibrium. There are mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium with positive economic profits (see Kaplan & Wettstein, 2000, and Baye & Morgan, 1999). * The classical model ignores search cost of consumers. If the consumer does not know the price of the product before visiting a firm and each visit is costly (however small), then a Nash equilibrium price will not arise. This creates the possibility that firms will randomly price at some point between marginal cost and the monopoly price. == See also == * [[Cournot competition]] * [[Differentiated Bertrand competition]] * [[Stackelberg competition]] * [[Nash equilibrium]] * [[Game theory]] * [[Bertrand paradox (economics)]] ==References== * Bertrand, J.

The paradox is that in reality, it usually takes a large number of firms to ensure that prices equal marginal cost. Typically, a small number of firms (oligopoly) earn positive profits by charging prices above cost. Suppose two firms, A and B, sell an identical [[commodity]], each with the same cost of [[Economic production|production]] and [[Distribution (business)|distribution]], so that customers choose the product solely on the basis of price. It follows that neither A nor B will set a higher price than the other because doing so would yield the entire market to their rival. If they set the same price, the companies will share both the market and profits. On the other hand, if either firm were to lower its price, even a little, it would gain the whole market and substantially larger profits. Since both A and B know this, they will each try to undercut their competitor until the product is selling at zero economic profit. This is the pure-strategy [[Nash equilibrium]]. Recent work has shown that there may be an additional mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium with positive economic profits (see Kaplan & Wettstein, 2000, and Baye & Morgan, 1999). The Bertrand paradox rarely appears in practice because real products are almost always [[product differentiation|differentiated]] in some way other than price ([[brand name]], if nothing else); firms have limitations on their capacity to manufacture and distribute; and two firms rarely have identical costs. Bertrand's result is paradoxical because if the number of firms goes from one to two, the price decreases from the [[monopoly]] price to the [[Competition#Economics and business|competitive]] price and stays at the same level as the number of firms increases further. This is not very realistic, as in reality, markets featuring a small number of firms with market power typically charge a price in excess of marginal cost. The empirical analysis shows that in most industries with two competitors, positive profits are made. Solutions to the Paradox attempt to derive solutions that are more in line with solutions from the [[Cournot competition|Cournot model]] of competition, where two
