It decomposes one of the [[multiplicand]]s (generally the larger) into a sum of [[powers of two]] and creates a table of doublings of the second multiplicand. This method may be called '''mediation and duplation''', where [[division by two|mediation]] means halving one number and duplation means doubling the other number. It is still used in some areas. The second [[Egyptian multiplication and division]] technique was known from the [[hieratic]] [[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus|Moscow]] and [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus|Rhind Mathematical Papyri]] written in the seventeenth century B.C. by the scribe [[Ahmes]]. == The decomposition == The decomposition into a sum of powers of two was not intended as a change from base ten to base two; the [[Egyptians]] then were unaware of such concepts and had to resort to much simpler methods. The [[ancient Egypt]]ians had laid out tables of a great number of powers of two so as not to be obliged to recalculate them each time. The decomposition of a number thus consists of finding the powers of two which make it up. The Egyptians knew empirically that a given power of two would only appear once in a number. For the decomposition, they proceeded methodically; they would initially find the largest power of two less than or equal to the number in question, subtract it out and repeat until nothing remained. (The Egyptians did not make use of the number zero in mathematics). To find the largest power of 2 keep doubling your answer starting with number 1.<br> Example:<br> <br> 1 x 2 = 2<br> 2 x 2 = 4<br> 4 x 2 = 8<br> 8 x 2 = 16<br> 16 x 2 = 32 <br> Example of the decomposition of the number 25: * the largest power of two less than or equal to 25 is 16, * 25 – 16 = 9, * the largest power of two less than or equal to 9 is 8, * 9 – 8 = 1, * the largest power of two less than or equal to 1 is 1, * 1 – 1 = 0 25 is thus the sum of the powers of two: 16, 8 and 1. == The table == After the decomposition of the first multiplicand, it is necessary to construct a table of powers of two times the second multiplicand (generally the smaller) from one up to the largest power of two found during the decomposition. In the table, a line is obtained by multiplying the preceding line by two. For example, if the largest power of two found during the decomposition is 16, and the second multiplicand is 7, the table is created as follows: * 1; 7 * 2; 14 * 4; 28 * 8; 56 * 16; 112 == The result == The result is obtained by adding the numbers from the second column for
