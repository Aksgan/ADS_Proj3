widely used in Internet forums. Forum software packages are widely available on the [[Internet]] and are written in a variety of [[programming language]]s, such as [[PHP]], [[Perl]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Active Server Pages|ASP]]. The configuration and records of posts can be stored in [[text file]]s or in a [[database]]. Each package offers different features, from the most basic, providing text-only postings, to more advanced packages, offering [[multimedia]] support and formatting code (usually known as [[BBCode]]). Many packages can be integrated easily into an existing website to allow visitors to post comments on articles. Several other web applications, such as [[weblog]] software, also incorporate forum features. Wordpress comments at the bottom of a [[blog]] post allow for a single-threaded discussion of any given blog post. [[Slashcode]], on the other hand, is far more complicated, allowing fully threaded discussions and incorporating a robust moderation and meta-moderation system as well as many of the profile features available to forum users. Some stand alone threads on forums have reached fame and notability such as the "[[I am lonely will anyone speak to me]]" thread on MovieCodec.com's forums which was described as the "web's top hangout for lonely folk" by Wired Magazine.<ref>http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2005/06/68010</ref> ==Registration or anonymity== In the [[United States]] and some parts of [[Europe]], most Internet forums require registration to post. Registered users of the site are referred to as ''members'' and are allowed to submit or send electronic messages through the [[web application]]. The process of registration involves verification of one's age (typically over 12 is required so as to meet [[COPPA]] requirements of American forum software) followed by a declaration of the [[terms of service]] (other documents may also be present) and a request for agreement to said terms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/faq.php?faq=vb3_board_usage#faq_vb3_register |title=vBulletin Community forum - FAQ: Registration |publisher=vBulletin.com |accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/faq.php#f01 |title=phpBB FAQ: Why do I need to register at all? |publisher=phpBB.com |accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/faq.php#f07 |title=phpBB FAQ: What is COPPA? |publisher=phpBB.com |accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref> Subsequently, if all goes well, the candidate is presented with a [[web form]] to fill requesting at the very least: a [[username]] (an alias), password, email and validation of a [[CAPTCHA]] code. While simply completing the registration [[web form]] is generally enough to generate an account<ref group="note">an account is a space on the site identified by the chosen username through which a member carries out activities and contributes.</ref> the status label ''Inactive'' is commonly provided by default until the registered user confirms the email address given while registering indeed belongs to the user. Until that time, the registered can log in to the new account but may not [[#Post|post]], [[#Thread|reply]], or send [[#Private message|private messages]] in the forum. [[Image:Spacetrace forum.png|thumb|280px|Internet Forums are used frequently in conjunction with multiplayer online games.]] Sometimes a ''referrer system'' is implemented. A ''referrer'' is someone who introduced or otherwise "helped someone" with the decision to join the site (similarly how a [[HTTP referrer]] is the site who linked one to another site). Usually, referrers are other forum members,and members are usually rewarded for referrals. The referrer system is also sometimes implemented so that if a visitor visits the forum though a link such as <code>referrerid=300</code>, the user with the id number (in this example, 300) would receive referral credit if the visitor registers.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2008-09-15 |publisher=vBulletin.com |title=vBulletin Options - User registration |url=http://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/}}</ref> The purpose is commonly just to give credit (sometimes rewards are implied) to those who help the community grow. In areas such as China and Japan, registration is frequently optional and anonymity is sometimes even encouraged.<ref>http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2007/04/2channel</ref> On these forums, a [[tripcode]] system may be used to allow verification of an identity without the need for formal registration. People who do not register and/or post are often referred to as "lurkers". ==Rules and policies on forums== Forums are governed by a set of individuals, collectively referred to as ''staff'', made up of ''administrators'' and ''moderators'', which are responsible for the forums' conception, technical maintenance, and policies (creation and enforcing). Most forums have a list of rules detailing the wishes, aim and guidelines of the forums creators. There is usually also a [[FAQ]] section contain basic information for new members and people not yet familiar with the use and principles of a forum (generally tailored for specific forum software). Rules on forums usually apply to the entire user body and often have preset exceptions, most commonly designating a section as an exception. For example, in an [[Information technology|IT]] forum any discussion regarding anything but computer [[programming languages]] may be against the rules, with the exception of a ''general chat'' section. Forum rules are maintained and enforced by the moderation team, but users are allowed to help out via what is known as a report system. Most American forum software contains such a system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/faq.php#f29 |title=phpBB FAQ: How can I report posts to a moderator? |publisher=phpBB.com |accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref><ref name="vBFAQDTU">{{cite web |url=http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/faq.php?faq=vb3_board_usage#faq_vb3_troublesome_users |title=vBulletin FAQ: Dealing with Troublesome Users |publisher=vBulletin.com |accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref> It consists of a small function applicable to each post (including one's own). Using it will notify all currently available moderators of its location, and subsequent action or judgment can be carried out immediately, which is particularly desirable in large or very developed boards. Generally, moderators encourage members to also use the ''private message'' system if they wish to report behavior. Moderators will generally frown upon attempts of moderation by non-moderators, especially when the would-be moderators do not even issue a report. Messages from non-moderators acting as moderators generally declare a post as against the rules, or predict punishment. While not harmful, statements which attempt to enforce the rules are discouraged.<ref>{{cite news|accessdate=2008-09-14 |publisher=phpBB.com |title=Community Rules [http://www.phpbb.com/rules/#rule1c 1c] |quote=Members are asked to not act as 'back seat moderators'.

Members who constantly 'act' as moderators may be warned.}}</ref> When rules are broken several steps are commonly
