[[Image:Deluxe CDPlayer screenshot.png|thumb|left|Deluxe CD Player running in Windows 7]] When the CD Player is launched, it searches the optical drive looking for [[Compact Disc Audio track|CD Audio Tracks]], looks up disc [[metadata]] with an internet service, and plays the disc. CD recognition, track and artist data can be manually entered and are redisplayed on next load. If no disc is inserted, the message "Data or no disc loaded, Please insert an audio compact disc." is displayed. ==Deluxe CD Player== ''Deluxe CD Player'', a modified version of CD Player with a different skin, was also included in [[Microsoft Plus!#Microsoft Plus! 98|Microsoft Plus! for Windows 98]] and [[Windows 2000]]. ==Compatibility== *The version downloaded from the [http://download.microsoft.com/download/win95upg/cdrom_b/1/w95/en-us/cdply.exe Microsoft website] works on any [[Windows 9x]] operating system such as Windows 95/98/Me. *To get it working on any [[Windows NT]] operating system such as Windows XP, users can copy these files from a computer running either Windows NT 3.51 or Windows 4.0 for the regular edition, or Windows 2000 for the deluxe edition: **cdplayer.exe **cdplayer.cnt **cdplayer.hlp *In Windows Vista/7, the time display in CD Player is frozen, resulting in the Time Elapsed/Remaining information and Track number not shown correctly. ==See also== *[[DVD Player (Windows)]] *[[Media Player (Microsoft)|Media Player]] ==External links== *[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/135315 CD-ROM Extras for Microsoft Windows 95 Upgrade] *[http://www.threetix.net/articles/0008.html Microsoft's CD Players] *[http://www.guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/cdplayer GUIdebook - Screenshots of CD Player] {{windows-stub}} {{Windows Components}} {{Media player (application software)}} [[Category:Discontinued Microsoft software]] [[Category:Discontinued Windows components]] [[Category:Microsoft Windows multimedia technology]] [[Category:Tag editors]] [[Category:Windows media players]] [[zh:CD播放程式]]</text> </page> <page> <id>5019</id> <title>CESG Claims Tested Mark</title> <text>The '''CESG Claims Tested Mark''' (abbreviated as '''CCT Mark'''), formerly '''CSIA Claims Tested Mark'''<ref>[http://www.cctmark.gov.uk/FAQs/tabid/56/Default.aspx FAQs About CCTM<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, is a [[UK]] Government Standard for [[computer security]]. The CCT Mark is based upon framework where vendors can make claims about the security attributes of their products and/or services, and independent testing laboratories can ''evaluate'' the products/services to determine if they actually meet the claims. In other words, the CCT Mark provides quality assurance approach to validate whether the implementation of a computer security product or services has been performed in an appropriate manner. == History == The CCT Mark was developed under the auspices of the UK Government's '''Central Sponsor for Information Assurance'''<ref>[http://www.csia.gov.uk Central Sponsor for Information Assurance (CSIA)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> (CSIA), which is part of the [[Cabinet Office|Cabinet Office's]] Intelligence, Security and Resilience (ISR) function. The role of providing specialist input to the CCT Mark fell to [[GCHQ|CESG]] as the UK National Technical Authority (NTA) for Information Security, who assumed responsibility for the scheme as a whole on 7 April 2008. == Operation == All Testing Laboratories must comply with [[ISO 17025]], with the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) carrying out the accreditation. == Comparisons == The CCT Mark is often compared to the international [[Common Criteria]] (CC), which is simultaneously both correct and incorrect: *Both provide methods for achieving a measure of assurance of computer security products and systems *Neither can provide a guarantee that approval means that no exploitable flaws exist, but rather reduce the likelihood of such flaw being present *The Common Criteria is constructured in a layered manner, with multiple [[Evaluation Assurance Level]] (EAL) specifications being available with increasing complexity, timescale and costs as the EAL number rises *Common Criteria is supported by a Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA), which, at the lower EAL numbers at least, means that products tested in one country will normally be accepted in other markets *The CCT Mark is aimed at the same market as the lower CC EAL numbers (currently EAL1/2), and has been specifically designed for timescale and cost efficiency == Future == As of September 2010, CESG have announced that the product assurance element of CCT Mark will be overtaken by the new [[Commercial Product Assurance]] (CPA) approach. It is unclear as yet whether CCT Mark will remain in existence for assurance of [[Information Security]] services. == External links == * [http://www.cctmark.gov.uk/ The official website of the CESG Claims Tested Mark] == References == <references/> [[Category:Computer security procedures]] [[Category:Evaluation]]</text> </page> <page> <id>5020</id> <title>CESG Listed Advisor Scheme</title> <text>The '''CESG Listed Advisor Scheme''' is a programme run by [[Government Communications Headquarters#CESG|CESG]], to provide a pool of [[information assurance]] consultants to government departments and other public-sector bodies in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cesg.gov.uk/products_services/iacs/clas/index.shtml|accessdate=2010-11-02|title=CESG Listed Adviser Scheme (CLAS) - What is CLAS?}}</ref> CLAS consultants advise on systems that handle [[Classified information in the United Kingdom#System of classification|protectively marked information]], up to and including secret;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vega.co.uk/services/information_assurance/penetration_testing_services/clas.aspx|accessdate=2010-11-02|title=CLAS - CESG Listed Adviser Scheme - VEGA Consulting Services|quote=protect}}</ref> for instance, they may advise on [[Government Secure Intranet|GSI]] accreditation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nta-monitor.com/services/consultancyservices.html|accessdate=2010-11-02|title=NTA Monitor - Services - consultancy|date=2010-10-14}}</ref> CLAS consultants hold a security clearance, at least [[Classified information in the United Kingdom#Security Check (SC)|SC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sapphire.net/clas-consultancy-7/clas-consultancy-68.html|accessdate=2010-11-02|title=CLAS Consultancy}}</ref> CLAS consultants may develop risk assessments in line with [[HMG Infosec Standard No.1|IS1]], and Risk Management and Accreditation Document Set(s) (RMADS) in line with [[HMG Infosec Standard No.2|IS2]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commissum.com/consulting/clas/|accessdate=2010-11-02|title=CESG Listed Advisor Scheme | Commissum|date=2010-11-02}}</ref> ==External Links== * [http://www.cesg.gov.uk/products_services/iacs/clas/index.shtml CLAS homepage] * [https://www.clasconsultants.net/kb/index.php/Main_Page CLAS knowledgebase] ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Information assurance standards]] [[Category:Information Risk Management]]</text> </page> <page> <id>5025</id> <title>CFD-DEM</title> <text>{{Wikify|date=December 2010}} {{orphan|date=August 2009}} '''CFD-DEM''' model is suitable for the modelling or simulation of [[fluid]]-solids or fluid-particles systems. In the CFD-DEM, the motion of discrete solids or particles phase is obtained by the Discrete Element Method (DEM) which applies Newton's laws of motion to every particle, while the flow of continuum fluid is described by the local averaged Navier–Stokes equations that can be solved using the traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach. The interactions between the fluid phase and solids phase is modeled by use of [[Newton's third law]]. The direct incorporation of CFD into DPM to study the gas fluidization process so far has been attempted by Tsuji et al.<ref>Tsuji, Y., Kawaguchi, T. and Tanaka, T.
