Mr. Morgan's presentation was entitled “Wikipedia and the National Portrait Gallery – A bad first date? A perspective on the developing relationship between Wikipedia and cultural heritage organisations”.<ref>[http://blog.wikimedia.org.uk/2010/11/glam-wiki-schedule-announced/ Wikimedia UK blog post], "GLAM-WIKI Schedule Announced", 14 November 2010. Accessed 28 November 2010</ref> ==Background== The 1999 [[United States District Court]] case ''[[Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp.]]'' (in which [[Bridgeman Art Library]] sued the [[Corel Corporation]] for copyright infringement for distributing copies of digital reproductions of public domain paintings sourced from Bridgeman on a CD-ROM) established that "a photograph which is no more than a copy of a work of another as exact as science and technology permits lacks [[Threshold of originality|originality]]. That is not to say that such a feat is trivial, simply not original."<ref name="subjectmatter"> {{cite web | author=Filler, Stephen C. | title=Copyright Protection and Subject Matter in Photographs | url = http://www.nylawline.com/articlephotog1.htm | date=December 9, 2006, from Internet Archive) |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061209234905/http://www.nylawline.com/articlephotog1.htm |archivedate = 2006-12-09}} </ref> As a result, reproductions of works that have fallen into the public domain cannot attract any new copyright in the United States.<ref name="subjectmatter"/> As such, local policies of the Wikimedia Commons web site ignore any potential copyright that could subsist in reproductions of public domain works.<ref name="bjp-atwar"/> However, British case law can take into account the amount of [[Sweat of the brow|skill and labour]] that took place in the creation of a work for considering whether it can be copyrighted in the country.<ref name="bjp-atwar"/> As a ruling made in a US court, ''Bridgeman v. Corel'' is not a binding precedent for any court in the UK (though it may be influential). The letter from the National Portrait Gallery implies that the case should be determined using UK law and not US law. The issue of jurisdiction is complicated as the National Portrait Gallery is located in England, but Wikimedia Commons, and the uploader, are both located within the United States. The letter also claims that by making the images freely available on Wikimedia Commons, Coetzee would also be liable under the British [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] for any [[copyright infringement]] committed by other users who download and use the images.<ref name= "BBC-NPG legal threat-2009-07-15">{{ cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/arts_and_culture/8151989.stm | title = Gallery in Wikipedia legal threat | date=July 15, 2009 | work = BBC News | publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation | accessdate=2009-07-27}}</ref><ref name="Register-Orlovski-2009-07-13"/> ==Reaction== {{POV|section|date=October 2009}} ===Response by the Wikimedia Foundation=== [[Erik Möller]], deputy director of the Wikimedia Foundation, made a statement on the issue, clarifying the stance of the Wikimedia Foundation on the incident.<ref name = "BBC News-Cellan-Jones-2009-07-19"> {{cite news | title = Wikipedia painting row escalates | first = Rory | last = Cellan-Jones | work = BBC News | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8156268.stm | publisher = British Broadcasting Corporation | date = July 17, 2009 | accessdate = July 28, 2009 }} </ref><ref name="Wikimedia Fdn-Möller-2009-16-2009"/> Möller stated that although the NPG has agreed that the images are in the public domain, the NPG had contended that they own the exclusive rights to their reproductions of the images, using this to monetize their collection and assert control over public domain content.<ref name="Wikimedia Fdn-Möller-2009-16-2009"> {{cite web|title=Protecting the public domain and sharing our cultural heritage |url=http://blog.wikimedia.org/2009/07/16/protecting-the-public-domain-and-sharing-our-cultural-heritage/ |last=Möller|first=Erik |date=July 16, 2009|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate=2009-07-28}} </ref> Möller also stated "It is hard to see a plausible argument that excluding public domain content from a free, non-profit encyclopaedia serves any public interest whatsoever." <ref name = "BBC News-Cellan-Jones-2009-07-19"/> Möller further described the agreement that other cultural institutions have made with Wikipedia to disseminate images: two German photographic archives donated 350,000 copyrighted images, and other institutions in the United States and the UK have made material available for use.<ref name = "BBC News-Cellan-Jones-2009-07-19"/> The NPG stated that the images released by the German archives were medium resolution images, and that the NPG had offered to share images of the same quality.<ref name = "BBC News-Cellan-Jones-2009-07-19"/> A reporter for the BBC reported that the NPG made a total of £339,000 from licensing images for use in traditional publications in
