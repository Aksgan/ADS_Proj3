For example, members of [[health information exchange]]s (HIEs) can use a service such as eMix to share radiology data even when those members have mutually incompatible IT systems. The service also makes it possible for a healthcare institution to include radiology data obtained from out-of-network facilities or physicians in the institution's [[PACS]], [[radiology information system]] (RIS), [[healthcare information system]] (HIS), or [[electronic medical record]] (EMR). Finally, it is a logical system for patients to use when adding medical imaging information to their [[personal health record]] (PHR).<ref name=Cadet /> A potential advantage of using a cloud-based system is affordability. Healthcare institutions, physician offices, and patients need no special infrastracture to use such a system -- they only need a computer connected via [[broadband]] to the Internet. They don't even need to acquire special hardware or software, and can pay for the service on a per-use basis, much like phone service.<ref name=Reicher />, <ref>Tang K (2009). “Cloud Computing Drives Design of New Imaging Management Platform,” Diagnostic Imaging, 30 November 2009.
