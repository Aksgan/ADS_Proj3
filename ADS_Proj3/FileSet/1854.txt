It enabled several devices such as printers, floppy disk drives, tape readers, etc. to be connected to programmable calculators such as the [[HP-41C]], [[HP-71B]] and [[HP-75|HP-75C/D]], the [[HP series 80|80-series]] and [[HP-110]] computers, as well as generic [[ISA bus]] based [[Personal Computer|PC]]s. ==Principles== The HP-IL can be seen as a precursor to the [[Universal Serial Bus]] now largely in use on desktop computers. However, as its name implies, the cable formed a loop: the cable originated in the HP-IL extension module, ran through all connected devices, then came back to the module. On the bus, devices could act as controllers (the calculators/computers) or slaves (the peripherals). Certain controllers like the HP-71 module or the HP82973A ISA interface could act as slaves as well, enabling a small network of calculators to be set up. The IL used a form of [[Token passing]] protocol for media access control. Every device on the bus has a ring-in and a ring-out connector, either on pigtails or built in. HP used a proprietary two-pin connector design with polarizing "D"-shaped shells. HP-IL cables can be interconnected without further adapters to extend their length. ==Applications== Hewlett-Packard developed a range of devices to be connected to the HP-IL, mostly peripherals such as printers and storage devices for calculators. Through the 82169A HP-IL/HP-IB Interface, HP-IL controllers could be connected to instruments with an [[HP-IB]] (aka GPIB or IEEE-488) interface, or vice versa. There were also plans to make test equipment with IL interfaces, but apart from the somewhat popular 3468A multimeter, only a few devices were introduced before HP-IL itself became obsolete. In addition to the HP-IB interface, HP also sold [[RS-232]] and general-purpose parallel I/O interfaces as well as a prototype kit to create custom interfaces. ==Equipment with HP-IL Interface== ===Controllers=== *HP 82160A HP-IL [[HP-41 extension module]] (for the [[HP-41C]]) *HP 82973A HP-IL interface for IBM PC and compatibles with [[ISA bus]] *HP 82938A Interface for [[HP series 80|Series 80]] desktop computers/controllers *HP 82401A HP-IL module for [[HP-71B]] *[[HP-75|HP-75C/D]] *[[HP-110]] *[[HP-150]] ===Interfaces=== *HP 82164A HP-IL/RS-232C Interface (serial port) *HP 82165A HP-IL/GPIO Interface (generic parallel port) *HP 82166A HP-IL Converter (smaller version of GPIO interface intended for embedded use) *HP 82166C HP-IL Converter Prototyping Kit *HP 82169A HP-IL/HPIB Interface (bidirectional) *HP 82985A HP-IL/NTSC (monochrome) ===Peripherals=== *HP 9114A/B Disc Drives *HP 82161A Tape Drive *HP 82162A Thermal Printer (HP-IL version of HP 82143A printer for HP-41C) *HP 82163A Video Interface *HP 92198A 80-Column Video Interface (Mountain Computer) *HP 82168A, 92205M Acoustic Couplers (Modems) *HP 82905A/B Printers *HP 2225B ThinkJet Printer *HP 7470A Graphics Plotter (Opt. 003 HPIL Interface) *HP 2671A/G Alphanumeric Graphics Thermal Printer ===Test instruments=== *HP 1630 and HP1631 [[Logic analyzer]]s (can be loop controller) *HP 3421A Data Acquisition/Control Unit *HP 3468A/B Digital Multimeters (HP-IL version of HP 3478A with GPIB) *HP 5384A and HP 5385A frequency counters with option 003 (HP-IL) ===Software=== *HP-IL Development Module (plug-in Application ROM module for HP-41C) *HP 82183A Extended I/O Module ===Third-party=== *FSI164A HP-IL/RS-232C Interface *Leitz IL-41 [[Theodolite]] interface ==References== *The HP-IL Interface Specification.

The name is an [[initialism]] for '''''H'''ewlett-'''P'''ackard '''G'''raphics '''L'''anguage''. It later became a standard for almost all plotters. Hewlett-Packard's [[Computer printer|printers]] also usually support HPGL in addition to [[Printer Command Language|PCL]]. The language is formed from a series of two letter codes, followed by optional parameters. For instance an [[Arc (geometry)|arc]] can be drawn on a page by sending the string: <code>AA100,100,50;</code> This means ''Arc Absolute'', and the parameters place the center of the arc at absolute [[Cartesian coordinate system|coordinates]] 100,100 on the page, with a starting angle of 50 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] measured counter-clockwise. A fourth optional parameter (not used here) specifies how far the arc continues, and defaults to 5 degrees. Typical HPGL files start with a few setup commands, followed by a long string of graphics commands. The file was in [[ASCII]] ([[text file]]) [[File format|format]], for instance: :{| class="wikitable" |+ An example HPGL file |----- ! Command ! Meaning |----- | IN; || initialize, start a plotting job |----- | IP; | set the initial point (origin), in this case the default 0,0 |----- | SC0,40,0,40; | allows scaling in millimeters since 1 mm = 40 plotter units.
