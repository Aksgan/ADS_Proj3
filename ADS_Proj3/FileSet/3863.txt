In 1981, [[Sankyo Seiki]], [[Pentel]] and [[NEC]] presented a completely new concept for assembly robots. The robot was developed under the guidance of Hiroshi Makino, a professor at the [[University of Yamanashi]]. The robot was called Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm, SCARA. Its arm was rigid in the Z-axis and pliable in the XY-axes, which allowed it to adapt to holes in the XY-axes.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Extended Arm of Man, A History of the Industrial Robot|isbn=91-7736-467-8|date=2000|first=Lars|last=Westerland}}</ref> By virtue of the SCARA's parallel-axis joint layout, the arm is slightly compliant in the X-Y direction but rigid in the ‘Z’ direction, hence the term: Selective Compliant. This is advantageous for many types of assembly operations, i.e., inserting a round pin in a round hole without binding. The second attribute of the SCARA is the jointed two-link arm layout similar to our human arms, hence the often-used term, Articulated. This feature allows the arm to extend into confined areas and then retract or “fold up” out of the way. This is advantageous for transferring parts from one cell to another or for loading/ unloading process stations that are enclosed. SCARA's are generally faster and cleaner than comparable Cartesian systems. Their single pedestal mount requires a small footprint and provides an easy, unhindered form of mounting. On the other hand, SCARA's can be more expensive than comparable Cartesian systems and the controlling software requires [[inverse kinematics]] for linear interpolated moves. This [[software]] typically comes with the SCARA though and is usually transparent to the end-user. ==See also== * [[Autonomous robot]] * [[Articulated robot]] * [[Gantry robot]] == References == {{reflist|1}} ==External links== * [http://www.peakrobotics.com/What_is_a_SCARA.htm What is a SCARA?] &ndash; Description and illustration from Peak Robotics, Inc. * [http://www.innovativerobotics.com/Downloads/SCARA%20robot%20vs%20r-theta.pdf Why SCARA?

The SCO Group alleges that its license agreements with IBM means that [[source code]] that IBM wrote and donated to be incorporated into Linux was added in violation of SCO's contractual rights. Members of the Linux community disagree with SCO's claims; [[IBM]], [[Novell]] and [[Red Hat]] have ongoing claims against SCO. On August 10, 2007 a federal district court judge in ''SCO v. Novell'' ruled on summary judgement that Novell, not the SCO Group, is the rightful owner of the copyrights covering the Unix operating system. The court also ruled that "SCO is obligated to recognize Novell's waiver of SCO's claims against IBM and Sequent". After the ruling Novell announced they have no interest in suing people over Unix and stated "We don't believe there is Unix in Linux".<ref name="doc377">[http://sco.tuxrocks.com/Docs/Novell/Novell-377.pdf MEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER Civil Case No. 2:04CV139DAK]</ref><ref>{{cite news | last= Montalbano |first= Elizabeth | url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,135959-c,unix/article.html | title= Novell Won't Pursue Unix Copyrights| publisher = PC World | date= 2007-08-15 | accessdate= 2007-09-04}}</ref><ref name=nyt1>{{cite news|title=Judge Says Unix Copyrights Rightfully Belong to Novell |publisher = New York Times|date = 2007-08-11| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/11/technology/11novell.html | accessdate= 2007-08-15 | first=John | last=Markoff}}</ref><ref name=gl070810>{{cite web|title=Court Rules: Novell owns the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights!

However, the company refused to identify the specific segments of code, claiming that it was a secret which they would reveal only to the court. They did say that the code could be found in the [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]], [[Read-copy-update|RCU]] and a few other parts of the [[Linux kernel]]. On 6 March 2003 they announced<ref>http://news.cnet.com/2100-1016-991464.html CNET news article</ref> that they were suing [[IBM]] for $1 billion, claiming that IBM transferred SCO [[trade secret]]s into Linux. That amount later rose to $3 billion, and then again to $5 billion. Some educated parties note that the ''[[USL v. BSDi]]'' case had shown that the Unix copyrights are weak and unenforceable. SCO has not claimed [[patent infringement]], as according to the [[US Patent and Trademark Office]] database, no [[AT&T]] or Novell patent was ever assigned to SCO. The UNIX [[trademark]] was not owned by SCO. That left arguing over trade secrets, which after some opposition, was hard to take beyond a breach of contract between SCO and IBM, and consequentially a claim only against IBM. SCO was looking for something directed at the greater Linux community, and has since explicitly dropped all trade secret claims from their case. SCO now had little legal ground at this point and therefore began numerous legal
