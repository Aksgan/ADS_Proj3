While he was working on it, he had discovered and played Crowther and Woods' ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'' at the [[Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]], and decided that a graphical video game version "would be really cool".<ref name="halcyon" /> However, with 128 bytes of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]] and 4096 bytes of [[Read-only memory|ROM]], Atari's ''Adventure'' was a much simpler program, and with only a [[joystick]] for input, the set of "commands" was necessarily brief.<ref name="halcyon" /> Even so, ''Adventure'' was a hit upon its 1979 release, and eventually sold a million copies.<ref name="thejadedgamer" /> Atari designers at the time were not given credit for their games, because Atari feared having to bargain with well-known designers.<ref name="thejadedgamer" /> In response to this, Robinett placed a hidden object in the game that would allow the player to reach a hidden screen which displayed the words "Created by Warren Robinett," hence creating one of the earliest known [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter eggs]] in a video game, and the first to which the name "Easter egg" was applied.<ref name="thejadedgamer" /><ref name="halcyon" /> Robinett then wrote the ''[[BASIC Programming]]'' cartridge, finishing both ''BASIC Programming'' and ''Adventure'' in June 1979, and quit Atari.<ref name="halcyon" /> He founded [[The Learning Company]]<ref name="arthurshall" /> in 1980,{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} and worked on several educational games there, including ''[[Rocky's Boots]]'' for the [[Apple II series]] computer.<ref name="thejadedgamer" /> He has since worked on [[virtual reality]] projects for [[NASA]]<ref name="halcyon" /> and the [[University of North Carolina]].<ref name="arthurshall" /> ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.warrenrobinett.com/ Warren Robinett's homepage] * [http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,114639/ MobyGames' entry on Robinett] * [http://www.giantbomb.com/warren-robinett/72-80905/ Warren Robinett infopage on GiantBomb] ===Interviews=== * [http://www.dadgum.com/halcyon/BOOK/ROBINETT.HTM Warren Robinett interview] from ''[[Halcyon Days (book)|Halcyon Days]]'' &mdash; official copy on James Hague website * [http://www.arthurshall.com/x_adventure.shtml Warren Robinett Interview: A.

It houses electronic [[Image scanner|scans]] of state, county, and local records that have permanent value, including records of censuses, immigration, prisoners, military service, and legislation dating back to the 19th century. The digital archives opened in October 2004, managed by [[Adam Jansen]] until December 2007. They had been planned and built from 2000 through 2004, with a new building to house both the traditional paper archives and the new digital archives being completed in June 2004. The Washington State Digital Archives is part of the Office of the Secretary of State and directed under the supervision of [[Sam Reed]]. ==References== * {{cite book | author = Nancy A.

The challenge is to make sure the watchman peeks behind every corner and to determine the best order in which corners should be visited in. There are [[polynomial-time solution]]s but they all suffer from severe [[numerical problems]] inherent in the computations. Note that this is not the same as [[the museum problem]], which is about a similar situation, but with multiple, stationary watchmen.
