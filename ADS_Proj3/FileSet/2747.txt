To allow developers to begin producing software for these Intel-based Macs, Apple made Developer Transition Kits available for sale which included a version of Mac OS X v10.4.1 designed to run on [[x86]] processors. This build includes Apple’s [[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]]—a translation process that allows Intel processor versions of the OS to run PPC software with little penalty. This is contrasted with the current Mac OS 9 [[Classic (Mac OS X)|Classic]] mode, which uses comparably larger amounts of system resources. Soon after the Developer Transition Kits began shipping, copies of Tiger x86 leaked onto [[file sharing]] networks. Although Apple had implemented a [[Trusted Computing]] [[Digital Rights Management|DRM]] scheme in the transition hardware and OS in an attempt to stop people installing Tiger x86 on non-Apple PCs, [[OSx86]] project had soon managed to remove this restriction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/commentary/cultofmac/2005/08/68501|title=Mac Hacks Allow OS X on PCs|author=Mark Baard|date=12 August 2005|publisher=Wired News|accessdate= 2006-07-10}}</ref> As Apple released each update with newer safeguards to prevent its use on non-Apple hardware, hacked versions were released that circumvented Apple’s safeguards. However, with the release of 10.4.5, 10.4.6, and 10.4.7 the hacked versions continued to use the kernel from the 10.4.4 because later kernels have hardware locks and depend heavily on [[Extensible Firmware Interface]]. By late 2006, the 10.4.8 kernel was cracked.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2006/10/25/osx_generic_intel/|title=Mac OS X 10.4.8 runs on any PC...| author=Tony Smith|date=25 October 2006|publisher=Reg Hardware ([[The Register]])|accessdate= 2006-12-16}}</ref> At MacWorld San Francisco 2006, Jobs announced the immediate availability of Mac OS X v10.4.4, the first publicly available release of Tiger compiled for both PowerPC and Intel x86 based machines. ==Release history== {|class="wikitable" |- !|Version !|Build !|Date !|[[uname|OS name]] !|Notes |- |rowspan=2 |10.4 ||8A428 |rowspan=2 |April 29, 2005 |rowspan=2 |[[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]] 8.0 ||Preinstalled on much of new line |- ||8A432 ||Original ''retail'' release |- |rowspan=2 |10.4.1 ||8B15 ||May 16, 2005 |rowspan=2 |Darwin 8.1 ||[http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2318 About the Mac OS X 10.4.1 Update] |- ||8B17 ||May 19, 2005 ||Server edition |- |rowspan=5 |10.4.2 ||8C46 |rowspan=2 |July 12, 2005 |rowspan=5 |Darwin 8.2 ||[http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2247 About the Mac OS X 10.4.2 Update (Delta)] |- ||8C47 ||Server Edition |- ||8E102 ||October 12, 2005 ||exclusively for [[Front Row (software)|Front Row]] [[iMac G5]] released on same date |- ||8E45 |rowspan=2 |October 19, 2005 ||exclusively for [[PowerBook G4]]s released on same date |- ||8E90 ||exclusively for [[Power Mac G5|Power Mac G5 Dual and Quad]] released on same date |- ||10.4.3 ||8F46 ||October 31, 2005 ||Darwin 8.3 ||[http://support.apple.com/kb/TA23396 About the Mac OS X 10.4.3 Update (Delta)] Updated ''retail'' release |- |rowspan=2 |10.4.4 ||8G32 |rowspan=2 |January 10, 2006 |rowspan=2 |Darwin 8.4 ||[http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2343 About the Mac OS X 10.4.4 Update (Delta)] PowerPC |- ||8G1165 ||[http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2343 About the Mac OS X 10.4.4 Update (Delta)] Intel |- |rowspan=2 |10.4.5 ||8H14 |rowspan=2 |February 14, 2006 |rowspan=2 |Darwin 8.5 ||[http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2581 About the Mac OS X 10.4.5 Update (delta)] PowerPC |- ||8G1454 ||[http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2581 About the Mac OS X 10.4.5 Update (delta)] Intel |- |rowspan=2 |10.4.6 ||8I127 |rowspan=2 |April 3, 2006 |rowspan=2 |Darwin 8.6 ||[http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2200 About the Mac OS X 10.4.6 Update (delta)] PowerPC;
