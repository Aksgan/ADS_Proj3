against "Poincaré (1906, p. 307) [who states that] a definition is 'predicative' and logically admissible only if it ''excludes'' all objects that are dependent upon the notion defined, that is, that can in any way be determined by it".<ref>van Heijenoort 1967:190</ref> He gives two examples of impredicative definitions -- (i) the notion of [[Dedekind chain]]s and (ii) "in analysis wherever the maximum or minimum of a previously defined "completed" set of numbers ''Z'' is used for further inferences. This happens, for example, in the well-known Cauchy proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra, and up to now it has not occurred to anyone to regard this as something illogical".<ref>van Heijenoort 1967:190-191</ref> He ends his section with the following observation: "A definition may very well rely upon notions that are equivalent to the one being defined; indeed, in every definition ''definiens'' and ''definiendum'' are equivalent notions, and the strict observance of Poincaré's demand would make every definition, hence all of science, impossible".<ref>van Heijenoort 1967:191</ref> Zermelo's example of minimum and maximum of a previously defined "completed" set of numbers reappears in Kleene 1952:42-42 where Kleene uses the example of [[Least upper bound]] in his discussion of impredicative definitions; Kleene does not resolve this problem. In the next paragraphs he discusses Weyl's attempt in his 1918 ''Das Kontinuum (The continuum)'' to eliminate impredicative definitions and his failure to retain the "theorm that an arbitrary non-empty set M of real numbers having an upper bound has a least upper bound (Cf. also Weyl 1919.)"<ref>Kleene 1952:43</ref> [[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]] argued that "impredicative" definitions can be harmless: for instance, the definition of "Tallest person in the room" is impredicative, since it depends on a set of things of which it is an element, namely the set of all persons in the room. Concerning mathematics, an example of an impredicative definition is the smallest number in a set, which is formally defined as: ''y'' = min(''X'') if and only if for all elements ''x'' of ''X'', ''y'' is less than or equal to ''x'', and ''y'' is in ''X''. Burgess (2005) discusses predicative and impredicative theories at some length, in the context of [[Frege]]'s logic, [[Peano arithmetic]], [[second order arithmetic]], and [[axiomatic set theory]]. == See also == * [[Richard's paradox]] * [[Predicative arithmetic]] == Notes == {{Reflist}} == References == * [http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/Predicativism.html PlanetMath article on predicativism] * [[John Burgess]], 2005.

He states that his 6 or so (famous) examples of paradoxes (antinomies) are all examples of impredicative definition, and says that Poincaré (1905&ndash;6, 1908) and Russel (1906, 1910) "enunciated the cause of the paradoxes to lie in these impredicative definitions" (p. 42), however, "parts of mathematics we want to retain, particularly analysis, also contain impredicative definitions." (ibid). Weyl in his 1918 ("Das Kontinuum") attempted to derive as much of analysis as was possible without the use of impredicative definitions, "but not the theorem that an arbitrary non-empty set M of real numbers having an upper bound has a least upper bound (CF. also Weyl 1919)" (p. 43). * [[Hans Reichenbach]] 1947, ''Elements of Symbolic Logic'', Dover Publications, Inc., NY, ISBN 0-486-24004-5.

The antinomies and the theory of types''' (pp. 218 &mdash; wherein he demonstrates how to create antinomies, including the definition of ''impredicable'' itself ("Is the definition of "impredicable" impredicable?"). He claims to show methods for eliminating the "paradoxes of syntax" ("logical paradoxes") &mdash; by use of the theory of types &mdash; and "the paradoxes of semantics" &mdash; by the use of metalanguage (his "theory of levels of language"). He attributes the suggestion of this notion to Russell and more concretely to Ramsey. *[[Jean van Heijenoort]] 1967, third printing 1976, ''From Frege to Gödel: A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1879-1931'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge MA, ISBN 0-674-32449-8 (pbk.)
