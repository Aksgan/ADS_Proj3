Using this program, which is specifically targeted at children,<ref>{{cite news |title=Microsoft Aims for Younger Market |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5DE153EF934A35751C1A965958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |publisher=New York Times |date=1993-12-07 |first=Steve |last=Lohr}}</ref> it is possible to create documents such as letters, posters, flyers and stories complete with different fonts, [[Clip art]], [[WordArt]] and effects. The interface and environment is especially targeted towards children and is set in Imaginopolis with the main helper being a character known as [[McZee]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Computers, Curriculum, and Cultural Change: An Introduction for Teachers, Second Edition |authors=Eug√®ne F.

Creative Writer is discontinued, but it can still be acquired from online stores and auction websites such as [[eBay]]. The original Creative Writer was announced by [[Microsoft]] on 7 December 1993 <ref>http://www.thocp.net/companies/microsoft/microsoft_company_part2.htm</ref> and was released in 1994. It ran on both [[MS-DOS]] 3.2 and the [[Windows 3.1]] operating system.<ref>Creative Writer & Fine Artist manual</ref> A version was also released for the [[Apple computer|Apple]] [[Macintosh]]. The program took place in the fictional place of Imaginopolis and had several levels of a building each with a different topic (e.g. one for plain writing, one for story templates, one for poster templates). The design of the program was very similar to that of its sister program [[Fine Artist]]. The program runs full screen and creates an all inclusive environment. The interface was probably inspired by an earlier product called [[Microsoft Bob]]. Creative Writer featured many of the features found on Microsoft's [[Word for Windows]] product, including the [[WordArt]] feature used to create titles and headlines and the ability to add clip art. Creative Writer also used sounds heavily where each tool would make a different noise. Examples of this include a vacuum cleaner suction to delete and an explosion to denote deleting everything off a page. Creative Writer (and its sequel Creative Writer 2) both use different versions of the proprietary .max file format. This file format does not open in other word processors such as Word. Files created in Creative Writer can be viewed in Creative Writer 2 but files saved using Creative Writer 2 will not open correctly in Creative Writer. Creative Writer was also able to open .doc files kept in a location known as "Outside Of Imaginopolis". == See also == * [[Microsoft Home]] * [[Fine Artist]] * [[Creative Writer 2]] == References == {{Reflist}} [[Category:Discontinued Microsoft software]] [[Category:Mac OS software]] [[it:Creative Writer]] [[pl:Creative Writer]]</text> </page> <page> <id>8415</id> <title>Creatures 3</title> <text>{{Infobox VG |title= Creatures 3 |image= |developer= [[Creature Labs]] |publisher= [[Mindscape]], [[Linux Game Publishing]] (Linux version) |designer= |engine= |released= November 4, 1999 |genre= |modes= |ratings= |platforms= [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] |media= |requirements= |input= }} '''''Creatures 3''''' is the third game in the ''[[Creatures (artificial life program)|Creatures]]'' [[artificial life|a-life]] game series made by [[Creature Labs]]. In this installment, the [[Shee (Creatures)|Shee]] have left Albia in a spaceship, the Shee Ark, to search for a more spherical world. The Ark was abandoned by the Shee because a meteor hit the ship, but the infrastructure still remains in working order. There are 6 main "[[Closed ecological system|metarooms]]" on the ship; the Norn Terranium, Grendel Jungle, Ettin Desert, Marine area, Bridge, and Engineering Room. The [[Norn]] Terranium is where you can safely hatch and raise your norns. The Grendel Jungle is where the [[Grendel]] mother (egg-layer) is, and it is well suited for Grendels. The Ettin Desert is where the [[Ettin]] mother is; it is a dry, harsh environment for all creatures. The Bridge is where you will find the most gadgets, and also the most Ettins. The Engineering Room is where the Agent Creator is, with which you can create objects for your world. Grendels are now vicious, unlike the original ''Creatures'' Grendels; these Grendels enjoy hunting down, and then killing norns. The Ettins, which first appeared in ''[[Creatures 2]]'', love gathering gadgets and taking them back to the Ettin Desert. Creatures 3 is free on the Spanish PlayStation Network. == See also == *[[Creatures (artificial life program)]] *[[Creatures (artificial life program)#Later bundled releases|Bundles with ''Creatures 3'']] *[[Docking Station (Creatures)]] == External links == *[http://www.gamewaredevelopment.co.uk/creatures_index.php Creature Labs] *[http://creatureswiki.net/wiki/Creatures_3 Creatures Wiki article on the ''Creatures'' wiki] *{{moby game|id=/creatures-3|name=''Creatures 3''}} *[http://www.nornenmeister.creaturesforum.de/ NornenMeister] [[Category:Artificial life]] [[Category:Creatures]] [[Category:Creature Labs games]] [[Category:Virtual pets]] [[Category:Biological simulation video games]] [[Category:God games]] [[Category:Linux games]] [[Category:Windows games]] [[Category:1999 video games]] [[Category:Video game sequels]] [[Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom]] {{life-simulation-videogame-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>8421</id> <title>Credit (creative arts)</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=July 2007}} {{Mergefrom|Closing credits|date=March 2010}} In general, the term '''credit''' in the artistic or intellectual sense refers to an acknowledgement of those who contributed to a work, whether through ideas or in a more direct sense. ==Credit in the arts== In the creative [[arts]], credits are an acknowledgement of those who participated in the production. They are often shown at the end of movies and on CD jackets. In [[film]], [[video]], [[television]], [[theater]], etc., ''credits'' means the list of [[actor]]s and behind-the-scenes staff who contributed to the production. {{seealso|motion picture credits}} ==Credit in writing== ===Non-fiction=== In [[non-fiction]] writing, especially academic works, it is generally considered important to give credit to sources of information and ideas. Failure to do so often gives rise to charges of [[plagiarism]], and "piracy" of [[intellectual rights]] such as the right to receive a [[copyright|royalty]] for having written. In this sense the financial and [[individual capital|individual]] meanings are linked. Academic papers generally contain a lengthy section of footnotes or [[scientific citation|citations]]. Such detailed crediting of sources provides readers with an opportunity to discover more about the cited material. It also provides a check against misquotation, as it's easy for an attributed quote to be checked when the reference is available. All of this is thought to improve [[integrity]] of the [[instructional capital]] conveyed, which may be quite fragile, and easy to misinterpret or to
