For example on [[Prince Edward Islands|Marion Island]] cats were infected with the [[feline panleukopenia]] virus, which drastically reduced their population within six years. The remaining cats were killed by shooting. Feral cats can also be controlled by larger native predators like [[coyote]]s or [[dingo]]es, because cats are too small to defend themselves against larger predators. The multiple, managed, feral colonies at the [[Colosseum]] in [[Rome]] exceed 250 cats. Other notable colonies include the [[Canadian Parliamentary Cats]], and the cats of Jerusalem <ref>{{Cite web| last = Hamilton| first = Jill| title = Blair and the stray cats of Jerusalem| work = JPost.com| accessdate = 2009-08-25| date = 2007-07-30| url = http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&cid=1185379025278}}</ref> ==See also== *[[The Society for the Improvement of Conditions for Stray Animals (SICSA)]] ==References== {{Reflist|2}} == External links == {{Commons category|Feral cats}} *[http://www.messybeast.com/ukferal.htm Feral cat control in the UK] *[http://www.avma.org/onlnews/javma/jan04/040115a.asp The cat debate] American Veterinary Medical Association *[http://www.mailtribune.com/archive/2006/1203/life/stories/columndec366.htm/ Feral cats are everybody's problem] Southern Oregon Mail Tribune *[http://www.feralcats.org.uk/ Study of the feral cats in Portsmouth Naval Dockyard, UK] with photos and scientific papers *[http://www.alleycat.org/NetCommunity/Page.aspx?pid=431 Feral cat guides] at Alley Cat Allies *[http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/feral_cats/tips/feral_cat_organizations.html List of Feral Cat Rescue Groups By State] Humane Society of the United States *[http://www.saveacat.org/catlinks.html List of Humane Societies and Rescue Groups With TNR Programs] Alley Cat Rescue {{Cat nav}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Feral Cat}} [[Category:Cats]] [[Category:Feral animals|Cat]] [[Category:Cat types]] [[Category:Invasive animal species|Cat, Feral]] [[Category:Urban animals|Cat, Feral]] [[fr:Chat haret]] [[he:חתול רחוב]] [[nl:Verwilderde kat]] [[ja:野良猫]] [[zh:流浪貓]]</text> </page> <page> <id>13450</id> <title>Ferranti Orion</title> <text>The '''Orion''' was a mid-range [[mainframe computer]] introduced by [[Ferranti]] in 1959 and installed for the first time in 1961. Ferranti positioned Orion to be their primary offering during the early 1960s, complementing their high-end [[Atlas Computer (Manchester)|Atlas]] and smaller systems like the [[Ferranti Sirius|Sirius]] and [[Ferranti Argus|Argus]]. The Orion was based on a new type of logic circuit known as "Neuron" and included built-in [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] support, one of the earliest commercial machines to do so. Performance of the system was much less than expected and the Orion was a business disaster, selling only about eleven machines. The '''Orion 2''' project was quickly started to address its problems, and five of these were sold. The failure of the Orion was the capstone to a long series of losses for the Manchester labs, and with the failure of the Orion management grew tired of the entire market. The division was sold to [[International Computers and Tabulators]] (ICT), who selected the Canadian [[Ferranti-Packard 6000]] as their mid-range offering, ending further sales of the Orion 2. ==History== ====Magnetic amplifiers==== During the 1950s [[transistor]]s were expensive and relatively fragile devices.<ref name=s>Scarrott</ref> Although they had advantages for computer designers, namely lower power requirements and their smaller physical packaging, [[vacuum tube]]s remained the primary logic device until the early 1960s. Through this period there were widespread efforts to use [[magnetic amplifier]]s as an alternative [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] device. Similar to [[magnetic core memory]], or "cores", magnetic amplifiers used small toroids of [[Ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] as a switching element. When current passed through the core a magnetic field would be induced that would reach a maximum value based on the saturation point of the material being used. The field induced current in a separate read circuit, creating an amplified output. Unlike digital logic based on tubes or transistors, which uses defined voltages to represent values, magnetic amplifiers based their logic values on current flows. This was known as "Ballot Box Logic" due to the way the inputs "voted" on the output.<ref name=s/> One advantage to magnetic amplifiers is that they are open in the center and several input lines can be threaded through them. This makes it easy to implement chains of "OR" logic by threading a single core with all the inputs that need to be ORed together. This was widely used in the "best two out of three" circuits that were widely used in binary adders,<ref name=s/> which could reduce the component count of the [[ALU]] considerably. Another way to use this feature was to use the same cores for different duties during different periods of the machine cycle, say to load memory during one portion and then as part of an adder in another. Each of the cores could be used for as many duties as there was room for wiring through the center. In the late 1950s new techniques were introduced in transistor manufacture that led to a rapid fall in prices while reliability shot up. By the early 1960s most magnetic amplifier efforts were abandoned. Few machines using the circuits reached the market, the best known examples being the mostly-magnetic [[UNIVAC Solid State]] (1959)<ref>George Gray, [https://wiki.cc.gatech.edu/folklore/index.php/The_UNIVAC_Solid_State_Computer "The UNIVAC Solid State Computer"], ''Unisys History Newsletter'', Volume 1 Number 2 (December 1992, Revised 1999)</ref> and the mostly transistorized [[English Electric KDF9]] (1963).<ref>Bill Findlay, [http://www.findlayw.plus.com/KDF9/The%20Hardware%20of%20the%20KDF9.pdf "The Hardware of the KDF9"], 2009</ref> ====Neuron==== The
