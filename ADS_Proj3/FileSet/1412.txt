discovered that subjects sometimes exhibit signs of preference reversals with regard to their certainty equivalents of different lotteries. Specifically, when eliciting [[certainty equivalent]]s, subjects tend to value "p bets" (lotteries with a high chance of winning a low prize) lower than "$ bets" (lotteries with a small chance of winning a large prize). When subjects are asked which lotteries they prefer in direct comparison, however, they frequently prefer the "p bets" over "$ bets."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lichtenstein |first=S.|coauthors=P.

However, this is unknown in practice: one is operating under [[uncertainty]] (in economics, one talks of [[Knightian uncertainty]]). Thus one must make assumptions, but then the expected value of various decisions is very [[sensitivity analysis|sensitive]] to the assumptions. This is particularly a problem when the expectation is dominated by rare extreme events, as in a [[long-tailed distribution]]. Alternative decision techniques are [[robust]] to uncertainty of probability of outcomes, either not depending on probabilities of outcomes and only requiring [[scenario analysis]] (as in [[minimax]] or [[minimax regret]]), or being less sensitive to assumptions. ==See also== * [[Allais paradox]] * [[Bayesian probability]] * [[Behavioral economics]] * [[Decision theory]] * [[Subjective expected utility]] * [[Generalized expected utility]] * [[Rank-dependent expected utility]] * [[Prospect theory]] * [[Risk#Risk in psychology|Risk in psychology]] * [[Risk aversion]] * [[Ambiguity aversion]] * [[Marginal utility]] * [[Two-moment decision models]] ==References== <references /> * {{cite journal| author=[[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[Joseph Jastrow]]|year=1885|title=[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Peirce/small-diffs.htm On Small Differences in Sensation]| journal=Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=3|pages=73–83}} http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Peirce/small-diffs.htm * [[Frank P.

In particular, the explained sum of squares measures how much variation there is in the modelled values and this is compared to the [[total sum of squares]], which measures how much variation there is in the observed data, and to the [[residual sum of squares]], which measures the variation in the modelling errors. ==Definition== The '''explained sum of squares (ESS)''' is the sum of the squares of the deviations of the predicted values from the mean value of a response variable, in a standard [[regression model]] — for example, {{nowrap|1=''y''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''a'' + ''b''<sub>1</sub>''x''<sub>1''i''</sub> + ''b''<sub>2</sub>''x''<sub>2''i''</sub> + ... + ''&epsilon;''<sub>''i''</sub>}}, where ''y''<sub>''i''</sub> is the ''i'' <sup>th</sup> observation of the [[response variable]], ''x''<sub>''ji''</sub> is the ''i'' <sup>th</sup> observation of the ''j'' <sup>th</sup> [[explanatory variable]], ''a'' and ''b''<sub>''i''</sub> are [[coefficient]]s, ''i'' indexes the observations from 1 to ''n'', and ''ε''<sub>''i''</sub> is the ''i'' <sup>th</sup> value of the [[error term]]. In general, the greater the ESS, the better the estimated model performs. If <math>\hat{a}</math> and <math>\hat{b}_i</math> are the estimated [[coefficient]]s, then :<math>\hat{y}_i=\hat{a}+\hat{b_1}x_{1i} + \hat{b_2}x_{2i} + \cdots \, </math> is the ''i''<sup> th</sup> predicted value of the response variable. The ESS is the sum of the squares of the differences of the predicted
