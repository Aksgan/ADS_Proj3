has received significant coverage in reliable secondary sources that are independent of the subject.}}</ref> which usually means that it must have received significant coverage in reliable secondary sources such as mainstream media or major academic journals that are independent of the subject of the topic. Further, Wikipedia must expose knowledge that is already established and recognized.<ref name=NOR>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research |title=Wikipedia:No original research |accessdate=2008-02-13|quote=Wikipedia does not publish original thought}}</ref> In other words, it must not present, for instance, new information or original works. A claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a reliable source. Among Wikipedia editors, this is often phrased as "verifiability, not truth" to express the idea that the readers, not the encyclopedia, are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making their own interpretations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability |title= Wikipedia:Verifiability |accessdate=2008-02-13 |quote=Material challenged or likely to be challenged, and all quotations, must be attributed to a reliable, published source.}}</ref> Finally, Wikipedia must not take a side.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view|title=Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view|accessdate=2008-02-13 |quote=All Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view, representing significant views fairly, proportionately and without bias.}}</ref> All opinions and viewpoints, if attributable to external sources, must enjoy an appropriate share of coverage within an article.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/61365/?page=entire|title=Will Unethical Editing Destroy Wikipedia's Credibility?|author=Eric Haas|publisher=AlterNet.org|date=2007-10-26|accessdate=2008-12-26}}</ref> This is known as neutral point of view, or NPOV. Wikipedia has many methods of settling disputes. A "bold, revert, discuss" cycle sometimes occurs, in which a user makes an edit, another user reverts it, and the matter is discussed on the appropriate talk page. In order to gain a broader community consensus, issues can be raised at the Village Pump, or a Request for Comment can be made soliciting other users' input. "Wikiquette Alerts" is a non-binding noticeboard where users can report impolite, uncivil, or other difficult communications with other editors. Specialized forums exist for centralizing discussion on specific decisions, such as whether or not an article should be deleted. [[Mediation]] is sometimes used, although it has been deemed by some Wikipedians to be unhelpful for resolving particularly contentious disputes. The [[Wikipedia Arbitration Committee]] settles disputes when other methods fail. The ArbCom generally does not rule on the factual correctness of article content, although it sometimes enforces the "Neutral Point of View" policy. Statistical analyses suggest that Wikipedia's dispute resolution ignores the content of user disputes and focuses on user conduct instead, functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting users, but to weed out problematic users while weeding potentially productive users back in to participate. Its remedies include banning users from Wikipedia (used in 15.7% of cases), subject matter remedies (23.4%), article bans (43.3%) and cautions and [[probation]]s (63.2%). Total bans from Wikipedia are largely limited to instances of impersonation and [[anti-social behavior]]. Warnings tend to be issued for editing conduct and conduct that is anti-consensus, rather than anti-social.<ref>{{Cite document|title=Wikitruth through Wikiorder|url=http://www.law.emory.edu/fileadmin/journals/elj/59/59.1/Hoffman_Mehra.pdf|publisher=Emory Law Journal|volume=59|issue=1|year=2009|pages=151â€“210|author=Hoffman, David A.; Mehra, Salil K.|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> === Content licensing === All text in Wikipedia was covered by [[GNU Free Documentation License]] (GFDL), a [[copyleft]] license permitting the redistribution, creation of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright of their work,<ref>[[Wikipedia:Copyrights]]</ref> up until June 2009, when the site switched to [[Creative Commons]] Attribution-ShareAlike (CC-by-SA) 3.0.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.wikimedia.org/2009/05/21/wikimedia-community-approves-license-migration/ |title=Wikimedia community approves license migration |work=Wikimedia Foundation|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation |accessdate=2009-05-21}}</ref> Wikipedia had been working on the switch to [[Creative Commons licenses]] because the GFDL, initially designed for software manuals, was not considered suitable{{Clarify|date=January 2011}} for online reference works and because the two licenses were incompatible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:License_update |title=Resolution:License update|year=2007|author=Walter Vermeir|publisher=Wikizine|accessdate=2007-12-04}}</ref> In response to the Wikimedia Foundation's request, in November 2008, the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) released a new version of GFDL designed specifically to allow Wikipedia to {{srlink|Wikipedia:Licensing update|relicense its content to CC-BY-SA}} by August 1, 2009.

Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia, include non-free image files under [[fair use]] doctrine, while the others have opted not to. This is in part because of the difference in copyright laws between countries; for example, the notion of fair use does not exist in [[Japanese copyright law]]. Media files covered by [[free content]] licenses (e.g., Creative Commons' cc-by-sa) are shared across language editions via [[Wikimedia Commons]] repository, a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. === Reusing Wikipedia's content === Because Wikipedia content is distributed under an open license, anyone can re-distribute it at no charge. The content of Wikipedia has been published in many forms, both online and offline, outside of the Wikipedia website. Thousands of "[[mirror site]]s" exist that republish content from Wikipedia; two prominent ones, that also include content from other reference sources, are [[Reference.com]] and [[Answers.com]]. Another example is [[Wapedia]], which began to display Wikipedia content in a mobile-device-friendly format before Wikipedia itself did. Some [[web search engine]]s also display content from Wikipedia on search results: examples include [[Bing.com]] (via technology gained from [[Powerset (company)|Powerset]])<ref>[http://www.bing.com/toolbox/blogs/search/archive/2009/07/27/researching-with-bing-reference.aspx Researching With Bing Reference]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}, Bing Community blog, July 27, 2009</ref> and [[Duck Duck Go]]. Some wikis, most notably Enciclopedia Libre and Citizendium, began as forks of Wikipedia content. The website [[DBpedia]], begun in 2007, is a project that extracts data from the infoboxes and category declarations of the English-language Wikipedia and makes it available in a queriable [[Semantic
