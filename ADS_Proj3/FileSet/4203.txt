It was released in 1983. The rifle is bundled with three games on tape, High Noon, Shooting Gallery and Grouse Shoot for the Spectrum. Different games were offered for the Commodore 64 and VIC-20 versions (all the games for these two systems were included on one cassette). It retailed for about $60, which is extraordinarily expensive given the fact that most cartridges were $10–20 each. The Stack Light Rifle is differentiated from future light guns as being very realistic looking; future unrealistic light guns such as the [[NES Zapper]] and the Sega [[Light Phaser]] dealt with controversy due to the guns still being misidentified as real firearms. The main pistol is attached to 12 feet of cable which ends in a dead-ended ZX81-size connector which plugs into the Spectrum's user port. A barrel, stock and [[telescopic sight]] can all be attached to the pistol. The barrel actually facilitated the gun's performance as it filtered out ambient light. These three parts combined to provide a reasonable - if not perfect - degree of accuracy, and allowed the user to effectively use the light gun from the comfort of an armchair. One can extrapolate that the multi-part design was later mimicked on the [[Sega]] [[Menacer]]. Variants of the Light Rifle were available for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore VIC-20]] and [[Commodore 64]] and all perform the same function. Like the Atari [[XG-1]] light gun, the Stack Light Rifle was treated by the hardware as a [[light pen]]. Due to lack of availability of software drivers for the Light Rifle, only the three games that came with the device were available. In April 1985, Sinclair User magazine reported that Stack Computer Services company disappeared. Stack Computer Solutions Limited now trades from Bootle Lancashire and can be found at www.stack.co.uk ==Technical specifications== The main component of the Stack Light Rifle System is the electronic target pistol that is connected to the computer by a generous length of lead. At the computer end, depending on the version, there is a connector for the appropriate socket or edge connector. On the [[ZX Spectrum]] version the connector contains two chips and a couple of simple components to interface the main electronics inside the gun to the computer. To make the pistol more accurate and to turn it into a rifle - it is supplied with a shoulder stock that clips and secures to the rear of the pistol, a barrel and a make-believe telescopic sight. The electronics inside the pistol consist of a light detector or photo-diode and a small amplifier and buffer. Light coming down the barrel is focused by a small plastic lens onto the photo-diode, and the device is sensitive enough to detect the changes in intensity of the picture. Once boosted by the amplifier, the signal is clipped to provide a digital pulse rather than an analogue waveform and is then fed to the computer via the switch. The screen position that is being scanned at that moment is the position the rifle is pointing at. As the computer receives the pulse from the Light Rifle it compares the value of its scan registers with the screen position of the target and, if a match is found, the played has scored a direct hit. ==Supported Games== ===Commodore 64=== *Escape From Alcatraz *High Noon "Stack" *Glorious 12th "Stack" *Gallery "Stack" *Crowshoot *Rat's & Cats ===Vic-20=== *High Noon "Stack" *Glorious 12th "Stack" *Gallery "Stack" {{Expand section|date=June 2008}} ==External links== *[http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/037/news.htm Sinclair User Magazine: Issue 37, April 1985] *[http://www.worldofspectrum.org/hardware/feat8.html World of Spectrum Feature on the Stack Light Rifle] *{{WoS game|id=0012585|Stack Light Rifle Software}} {{Use dmy dates|date=January 2011}} [[Category:Commodore VIC-20]] [[Category:ZX Spectrum games]] [[Category:Commodore 64]] [[Category:Light guns]]</text> </page> <page> <id>35499</id> <title>Stack machine</title> <text>In [[computer science]], a '''stack machine''' is a [[model of computation]] in which the computer's memory takes the form of one or more [[stack (data structure)|stack]]s. The term also refers to an actual computer implementing or simulating the idealized stack machine. In addition, a '''stack machine''' can also refer to a real or simulated machine with a "[[instruction set#Number of operands |0-operand]]" [[instruction set]]. In such a machine, most instructions implicitly operate on values at the top of the stack and replace those values with the result. Typically such machines also have a "load" and a "store" instruction that reads and writes to arbitrary RAM locations. (Like all other instructions, the "load" and "store" instructions in a typical stack machine need no operands &mdash; they always take the RAM address from the top of the stack.) One advantage of stack machines ("0-operand instruction set") over [[accumulator machine]]s ("1-operand instruction set") and [[register machine]]s ("2-operand instruction set" or a "3-operand instruction set") is that programs written for a "0-operand" instruction set generally have higher [[Instruction_set#Code_density|code density]] than equivalent programs written for other [[instruction set]]s. == Performance issues == Stack machines compete against conventional register machines for market share. Both architectures have strengths. The following discussion is to give a feel for the relative advantages of the two architectures. Conventional references say<ref>"Computer Architecture, a Quantitative Approach", John L. Henessy, David Goldberg; See the discussion of stack machines.</ref> that stack machines are slow because the stacks are in memory, and therefore slower to access than registers. However, this is somewhat counterbalanced by the smaller code size of a stack machine, which is faster to fetch and execute. This is borne out by experiments with aggressive optimization of both the machine architecture and
