It is one of the largest credit unions in the United States. HVFCU offers a wide variety of services, including [[checking accounts]], [[savings accounts]], vehicle loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, mortgages, financial planning through HVFCU Financial Services, property & casualty insurance through Insurance Agency of the Hudson Valley, business loans and accounts, and [[VISA]] debit, credit, and gift cards.

Their product line in the beginning was modest, consisting of basic savings and consumer loans. By the end of their first year, the credit union had 14 member accounts and $172 in assets. The name of the credit union changed a few times over the years, and in 1994, the name changed to the present-day name of Hudson Valley Federal Credit Union. At the beginning of 2003, membership requirements were changed to allow those who live, work, worship, volunteer, or attend school in Dutchess, Orange, or Ulster counties to join the credit union.<ref name='Eligibility'> {{cite web|url=https://www.hvfcu.org/about-us/membership |title=Hudson Valley Federal Credit Union Membership |accessdate=2010-04-12 }}</ref> On July, 1, 2010, HVFCU merged with Putnam Federal Credit Union, in Putnam County, New York.

The business grew steadily, and after the father's death in 1880 expanded rapidly under the management of Dixson and his brother Robert. It was subsequently merged in the British-Australian Tobacco Company Proprietary Limited, probably the largest business of its kind in Australia at the time. Dixson then retired, but with his wife continued his interest in the [[Baptist Church]] and in various philanthropic institutions. An early substantial gift was £5000 as the beginning of a fund to present a battleship to England. This fund was not successful and his gift was devoted to educating English boys at Australian agricultural colleges. A gift of £10,000 helped
