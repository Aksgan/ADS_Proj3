Hoffman's work focused on creating a set of four pericyclic reactions in organic chemistry, based on orbital symmetry, which he coauthored with [[Robert Burns Woodward]] entitled, "The Conservation of Orbital Symmetry." Fukui's own work looked at the frontier orbitals, and in particular the effects of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital ([[HOMO]]) and the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital ([[LUMO]]) on reaction mechanisms, which led to it being called Frontier Molecular Orbital Theory (FMO Theory). He used these interactions to better understand the conclusions of the [[Woodward-Hoffmann rules]]. == Theory == Fukui realized that a good approximation for reactivity could be found by looking at the frontier orbitals ([[HOMO/LUMO]]). This was based on three main observations of molecular orbital theory as two molecules interact: # The occupied orbitals of different molecules repel each other. # Positive charges of one molecule attract the negative charges of the other. # The occupied orbitals of one molecule and the unoccupied orbitals of the other (especially the HOMO and LUMO) interact with each other causing attraction. From these observations, frontier molecular orbital (FMO) theory simplifies reactivity to interactions between the HOMO of one species and the LUMO of the other. This helps to explain the predictions of the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for thermal pericyclic reactions, which are summarized in the following statement: <blockquote> ''"A ground-state pericyclic change is symmetry-allowed when the total number of (4q+2)<sub>s</sub> and (4r)<sub>a</sub> components is odd"'' </blockquote> (4q+2)<sub>s</sub> refers to the number of [[aromatic]], [[suprafacial]] electron systems; likewise, (4r)<sub>a</sub> refers to [[antiaromatic]], [[antarafacial]] systems. It can be shown that if the total number of these systems is odd then the reaction is thermally allowed.<ref name=fleming>{{citation | last = Fleming | first = Ian | authorlink = Ian Fleming (chemist) | title = Frontier Orbitals and Organic Chemical Reactions | publisher = Wiley | year = 1978 | location = London | pages = 29–109 | isbn = 0471018198}} </ref> == Applications == === Cycloadditions === A [[cycloaddition]] is a reaction that simultaneously forms at least two new bonds, and in doing so, converts two or more open-chain molecules into rings.<ref name=miller>{{citation | last = Miller | first = Bernard | title = Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions and Mechanisms | publisher = Pearsons | year = 2004 | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ | pages = 53–54 | isbn = 0130655880}} </ref> The [[transition state]]s for these reactions typically involves the electrons of the molecules moving in continuous rings, making it a [[pericyclic reaction]]. These reactions can be predicted by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules and thus are closely approximated by FMO Theory. The [[Diels-Alder reaction]] between [[maleic anhydride]] and [[cyclopentadiene]] is allowed by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules because there are six electrons moving suprafacially and no electrons moving antarafacially. Thus, there is one (4q+2)<sub>s</sub> component and no (4r)<sub>a</sub> component, which means the reaction is allowed thermally. FMO theory also finds that this reaction is allowed and goes even further by predicting its [[stereoselectivity]], which is unknown under the Woodward-Hoffmann rules. Since this is a [4+2], the reaction can be simplified by considering the reaction between [[butadiene]] and [[ethene]]. The HOMO of butadiene and the LUMO of ethene are both antisymmetric (rotationally symmetric), meaning the reaction is allowed.<sup>*</sup> [[File:Butadiene Ethene Cycloaddition123.png]] In terms of the stereoselectivity of the reaction between maleic anhydride and cyclopentadiene, the ''[[Endo-exo isomerism|endo]]''- product is favored, a result best explained through FMO theory. The maleic anhydride is an electron-withdrawing species that makes the dieneophile electron deficient, forcing the regular Diels-Alder reaction. Thus, only the reaction between the HOMO of cyclopentadiene and the LUMO of maleic anhydride is allowed. Furthermore, though the ''[[Endo-exo isomerism|exo]]''- product is the more thermodynamically stable isomer, there are secondary (non-bonding) orbital interactions in the ''endo''- transition state, lowering its energy and making the reaction towards the ''endo''- product faster, and therefore more kinetically favorable. Since the ''exo''-product has primary (bonding) orbital interactions it can still form, but since the ''endo''-product forms faster it is the major product.<ref name=fleming/> [[File:Cyclopentadiene Maleic Anhydride Diels Alder.png]] <sup>*</sup>''Note: The LUMO of ethene and the HOMO of butadiene are both [[symmetric]], meaning the reaction between these species is allowed as well. This is referred to as the "inverse electron demand Diels-Alder."'' === Sigmatropic Reactions === A [[Sigmatropic reaction|sigmatropic rearrangement]] is a reaction in which a sigma bond moves across a conjugated pi system with a concomitant shift in the pi bonds. The shift in the sigma bond may be antarafacial or suprafacial. In the example of a [1,5] shift in pentadiene, if there is a suprafacial shift, there is 6 e<sup>-</sup> moving suprafacially and none moving antarafacially, implying this reaction is allowed by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules. For an antarafacial shift, the reaction is not allowed. These results can be predicted with FMO theory by observing the interaction between the HOMO and LUMO of the species. To use FMO theory, the reaction should be considered as two separate ideas: (1)
