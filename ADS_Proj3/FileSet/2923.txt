MMS can be transported via [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] or [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]]. The MMS default [[TCP and UDP port|port]] is [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers|UDP/TCP 1755]]. Microsoft deprecated MMS in favor of [[Real Time Streaming Protocol|RTSP]] (TCP/UDP port 554) in 2003 with the release of the Windows Media Services 9 Series, but continued to support the MMS for some time in the interest of [[backwards compatibility]]. Support for the protocol was finally dropped in [[Windows Media Services]] 2008<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/licensing/netprokit.aspx#TechnicalSpecificationDelivery Microsoft's Windows Media Networking Protocols Porting Kit]</ref>. Note however that Microsoft still recommends<ref name=autogenerated1 /> using "mms://" as a "protocol rollover<ref>[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/aa390673.aspx Microsoft's Windows Media Format 11 SDK Protocol Rollover]</ref> [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]". As part of protocol rollover a [[Windows Media Player]] version 9, 10, or 11 client opening an "mms://" URL will attempt to connect first with RTSP over UDP and if that fails it will attempt RTSP over TCP. After an RTSP attempt fails, Windows Media Player versions 9 & 10 will attempt MMS over UDP, then MMS over TCP<ref>[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa390673(VS.85).aspx Protocol Rollover<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. If using Windows Media Player 11 and an [[RTSP]] attempt fails, or if using a previous version of Windows Media Player and MMS fails, a modified version of a [[HyperText Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] over TCP connection will be attempted.
