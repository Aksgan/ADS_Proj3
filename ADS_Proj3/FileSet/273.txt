Within the context of this hypothetical universe, they represent the highest level to which living beings are currently known to have evolved. ==Archailects as described in the OA Universe== There is not one, but rather several toposophic grades of archailects (or "Archai" as they are also known). This is to say, the [[Technological singularity|''Singularity'']] postulated by [[transhumanist]]s and some [[Futures studies|futurist]]s is not actually a singular, ''one-off'' event - rather, it is merely the first of several major changes which intelligences undergo as they improve themselves, mutate, and evolve into higher forms. Within the OA Universe, then, there are said to be approximately six such Singularities which are thought to have happened so far, each producing vastly superior ''grades'' of intelligence. ==Origin of the Concept== The concept of archailects was inspired by a number of sources, including the work of AI researcher [[Hugo de Garis]], who coined the term "artilect" for "artificial intellect"; [[science fiction]] writer [[David Zindell]] who refers to godlike AIs that he calls "mainbrains"; and concepts from mysticism and mythology, such as the ideas of [[Carl Jung|Jung]], and the gods of [[Homer]]ic mythology who interfere in all sorts of ways in the lives of mortals. The concept of moon-, jupiter-, dyson-, and nebula-sized computing nodes was inspired by [[Anders Sandberg]]'s paper on this subject (see references). The term "archailect" is a play on "artilect", "archetype", and "AI", and is a meshing of the phrase "archetypal AI intellect." As the ''Orion's Arm'' project has progressed, various other themes have been added, including memetics, and replacing a purely [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] concept with the idea of archailects as equally beyond biological sophonts and AIs in the limited sense. ==External links== *[http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-topic/492d76d2f173e Orion's Arm - Archailects] ==References== *[http://www.orionsarm.com/xcms.php?r=oa-page&page=gen_primer_toc The Orion's Arm Primer ] by the Orion's Arm Worldbuilding Group * Sandberg, Anders, [http://www.jetpress.org/volume5/Brains2.pdf The Physics of Information Processing Superobjects : Daily Life Among the Jupiter Brains], ''Journal of Evolution and Technology'', 5 December 1999 [[category:Science fiction themes]]</text> </page> <page> <id>2309</id> <title>ArchiCAD</title> <text>{{Multiple issues|advert=December 2010|refimprove=December 2010}} {{Infobox Software | name = ArchiCAD | logo = [[Image:ArchiCAD-logo.jpg]] | screenshot =<!-- Commented out: [[Image:ArchiCAD-12-NHS-3D.png|296px|Screenshot of a building created in ArchiCAD 12]] --> | caption = | developer = [[Graphisoft]] | latest_release_version = v14 | latest_release_date = May 2010 | operating_system = [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Mac OS X]] | genre = [[CAD]], [[Building Information Modeling]] | license = [[Proprietary software|Proprietary]] | website = [http://www.graphisoft.com/products/archicad/ Graphisoft ArchiCAD site] }} <!-- Commented out: [[Image:ArchiCAD-12-NHS-Floor-Plan.png|thumb|300px|Screenshot of ArchiCAD 12 running on Mac OS X]] --> '''ArchiCAD''' is an architectural [[Building Information Modeling|BIM]] [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] software for [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] developed by the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] company [[Graphisoft]]. The newest version (2010) is ArchiCAD 14. ArchiCAD offers specialized solutions for handling all common aspects of aesthetics and engineering during the whole design process of the built environment — buildings, interiors urban areas, etc. Development of ArchiCAD started in 1982 for the original Apple Macintosh. ArchiCAD is recognized as the first [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] product on a personal computer able to create both 2D drawings and parametric 3D geometry.<ref>[http://www.laiserin.com/features/bim/newforma_bim.pdf Building Information Modeling Two Years Later – Huge Potential, Some Success and Several Limitations]</ref> In its debut in [[1987]] ArchiCAD also became the first implementation of [[Building Information Modeling|BIM]] under Graphisoft's '''[[Virtual Building]]''' concept.<ref>[http://www.laiserin.com/features/issue19/feature01.php Graphisoft on BIM]</ref> Today more than 150,000 [[architect]]s are using it in the building design industry.{{Fact|date=May 2009}} == Product overview == ArchiCAD is a complete design suite with 2D and 3D drafting, visualization and other functions for architects, designers and planners. A wide range of software applications are integrated in ArchiCAD to cover most of the design needs of an architectural office: * 2D [[CAD]] software — drawing tools for creating accurate and detailed technical drawings * [[3D Modeling]] software — a 3D CAD interface specially developed for architects capable of creating various kind of building forms * [[Architectural rendering]] and Visualization software — a high performance rendering tool to produce photorealistic pictures or videos * [[Desktop publishing]] software — with similar features to mainstream DTP software to compose printed materials using technical drawings pixel-based images and texts * [[Document management]] tool — a central data storage server with remote access, versioning tool with backup and restore features * [[Building Information Modeling]] software — not just a collection of the above mentioned applications with an integrated user interface but a novel approach to building design called BIM == Versions and license types == === Supported platforms === ArchiCAD is available for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]] operating systems. ArchiCAD 14 runs on Windows® XP Professional (32-bit and 64-bit), Windows® Vista Business and Ultimate Edition (32-bit and 64-bit), Windows® 7 (32-bit and 64-bit), Mac OS X 10.5, Mac OS X 10.6. === License types === Commercial, Educational and Full functional 30-day trial versions can be installed with the same installer. The license type is to be chosen upon installation. The installers and the necessary educational or trial registration numbers can be obtained on [https://www.myarchicad.com MyarchiCAD.com] after registration. * Commercial version is protected by hardware protection key. If no key is present ArchiCAD switches to Demo mode where Save, Copy, TeamWork features are disabled (printing/plotting is still enabled). * Educational versions are protected by registration numbers. Format files in educational version ArchiCAD are compatible with commercial ArchiCAD versions, but carry a watermark identifying the license type. Once a project has been edited with an Educational version the watermark will persist in the file. * Trial version is
