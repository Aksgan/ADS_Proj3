According to Taylor, Popper's criticisms are completely baseless, but they are received with an attention and respect that Popper's "intrinsic worth hardly merits".<ref> Taylor, Charles, "Overcoming Epistemology", in ''Philosophical Arguments'', Harvard University Press, 1995, ISBN 0-674-66477-9</ref> William W. Bartley defended Popper against such allegations: "Sir Karl Popper is not really a participant in the contemporary professional philosophical dialogue; quite the contrary, he has ruined that dialogue. If he is on the right track, then the majority of professional philosophers the world over has wasted or is wasting their intellectual careers. The gulf between Popper's way of doing philosophy and that of the bulk of professional philosophers is as great as that between astronomy and astrology."<ref>[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=12846597 Philosophia.

Selz himself never published his ideas, partly because of the rise of [[Nazism]] which forced him to quit his work in 1933, and the prohibition of referring to Selz' work. Popper, the historian of ideas and his scholarship, is criticized in some academic quarters, for his rejection of Plato, Hegel and Marx.<ref>See: "Popper is committing a serious historical error in attributing the organic theory of the state to Plato and accusing him of all the fallacies of post-Hegelian and Marxist historicism--the theory that history is controlled by the inexorable laws governing the behavior of superindividual social entities of which human beings and their free choices are merely subordinate manifestations."

See Also: "In spite of the high rating one must accord his initial intention of fairness, his hatred for the enemies of the 'open society,' his zeal to destroy whatever seems to him destructive of the welfare of mankind, has led him into the extensive use of what may be called terminological counterpropaganda ..." and "With a few exceptions in Popper's favor, however, it is noticeable that reviewers possessed of special competence in particular fields--and here Lindsay is again to be included--have objected to Popper's conclusions in those very fields ..." and "Social scientists and social philosophers have deplored his radical denial of historical causation, together with his espousal of Hayek's systematic distrust of larger programs of social reform; historical students of philosophy have protested his violent polemical handling of Plato, Aristotle, and particularly Hegel; ethicists have found contradictions in the ethical theory ('critical dualism') upon which his polemic is largely based."

Levinson, New York, 1970, Russell and Russell, 20.</ref> According to Karl Popper, a theory is scientific only in so far as it is falsifiable, and should be given up as soon as it is falsified.<ref>Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge, 1963</ref> By applying Popper's account of scientific method, John Gray's ''Straw Dogs'' states that this would have killed the theories of Darwin and Einstein at birth.
