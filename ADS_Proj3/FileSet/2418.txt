exploiting structural weaknesses in its algorithm, it is possible to run through the entire space of keys in what is known as a ''brute force attack''. Since longer symmetric keys require exponentially more work to brute force search, a sufficiently long symmetric key makes this line of attack impractical. With a key of length ''n'' bits, there are 2<sup>n</sup> possible keys. This number grows very rapidly as ''n'' increases. [[Moore's law]] suggests that computing power doubles roughly every 18 to 24 months, but even this doubling effect leaves the larger symmetric key lengths currently considered acceptably well out of reach. The large number of operations (2<sup>128</sup>) required to try all possible 128-bit keys is widely considered to be [[Large numbers#Computers and computational complexity|out of reach]] for conventional digital computing techniques for the foreseeable future. However, alternative forms of computing technology are anticipated which may have superior processing power than classical computers. If a suitably sized [[quantum computer]] capable of running [[Grover's algorithm]] reliably becomes available, it would reduce a 128-bit key down to 64-bit security, roughly a DES equivalent. This is one of the reasons why AES supports a 256-bit key length. See the discussion on the relationship between key lengths and quantum computing attacks at the bottom of this page for more information. ==Symmetric algorithm key lengths== US Government export policy has long [[Export of cryptography|restricted the 'strength' of cryptography]] which can be sent out of the country. For many years the limit was [[40-bit encryption|40 bits]]. Today, a key length of 40 bits offers little protection against even a casual attacker with a single PC. The restrictions have not been removed (in 2007, it is still illegal to export cryptographic software using key lengths greater than 64-bits without authorization from the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security),{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} but it became easier to gain authorization to export to certain countries in 1999/2000. When the [[Data Encryption Standard]] cipher was released in 1977, a key length of 56 bits was thought to be sufficient. There was speculation at the time, however, that the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] has deliberately reduced the key size from the original value of 112 bits (in IBM's [[Lucifer (cipher)|Lucifer cipher]]) or 64 bits (in one of the versions of what was adopted as DES) so as to limit the strength of encryption available to non-US users. The NSA has major computing resources and a large budget; some thought that 56 bits was NSA-breakable in the late '70s. However, by the late 90s, it became clear that DES could be cracked in a few days' time-frame with custom-built hardware such as could be purchased by a large corporation. The book ''Cracking DES'' (O'Reilly and Associates) tells of the successful attempt to break 56-bit DES by a brute force attack mounted by a cyber civil rights group with limited resources; see [[EFF DES cracker]]. 56 bits is now considered insufficient length for [[Symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric algorithm]] keys, and may have been for some time. More technically and financially capable organizations were surely able to do the same long before the effort described in the book. [[Distributed.net]] and its volunteers broke a 64-bit RC5 key in several years, using about seventy thousand (mostly home) computers. The [[NSA]]'s [[Skipjack (cipher)|Skipjack]] algorithm used in its [[Fortezza]] program employs 80 bit keys. DES has been replaced in many applications by [[Triple DES]], which has 112 bits of security with 168-bit keys. The [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] published in 2001 uses a key size of (at minimum) 128 bits. It also can use keys up to 256 bits (a specification requirement for submissions to the [[AES contest]]). 128 bits is currently thought, by many observers, to be sufficient for the foreseeable future for symmetric algorithms of AES's quality. The U.S. Government requires 192 or 256-bit AES keys for [[highly sensitive]] data. In 2003 the U.S. National Institute for Standards and Technology, [[NIST]], proposed that 80-bit keys should be phased out by 2015. As of 2005, 80-bit keys were allowed to be used only until 2010. ==Asymmetric algorithm key lengths== The effectiveness of [[public key cryptography|public key cryptosystems]] depends on the intractability (computational and theoretical) of certain mathematical problems such as [[integer factorization]]. These problems are time consuming to solve, but usually faster than trying all possible keys by brute force. Thus, asymmetric algorithm keys must be longer for equivalent resistance to attack than symmetric algorithm keys. As of 2002, a key length of 1024 bits was generally considered the minimum necessary for the [[RSA]] encryption algorithm. {{As of|2003}} [[RSA Security]] claims that 1024-bit RSA keys are equivalent in strength to 80-bit symmetric keys, 2048-bit RSA keys to 112-bit symmetric keys and 3072-bit RSA keys to 128-bit symmetric keys. RSA claims that 1024-bit keys are likely to become crackable some time between 2006 and 2010 and that 2048-bit keys are sufficient until 2030. An RSA key length of 3072 bits should be used if security is required beyond 2030.<ref>[http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2004 TWIRL and RSA Key Size]</ref> NIST key management guidelines further suggest that 15360-bit RSA keys are equivalent in strength to 256-bit symmetric keys.<ref>[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-57/sp800-57-Part1-revised2_Mar08-2007.pdf Recommendation for Key Management â€“ Part 1: General (Revised) page 63]</ref> The Finite Field [[Diffie-Hellman]] algorithm has roughly the same key strength as RSA for the same key sizes. The work factor for breaking Diffie-Hellman is based on the [[discrete logarithm problem]], which is related to the integer factorization problem on which RSA's strength is based. Thus, a 3072-bit Diffie-Hellman key has about the same strength as a 3072-bit RSA key. One of the asymmetric algorithm types, [[elliptic curve cryptography]], or ECC, appears to be secure with shorter keys than those needed by other asymmetric key algorithms. [[NIST]] guidelines state that ECC keys should be twice the length of equivalent strength symmetric key algorithms. So, for example, a 224-bit ECC key would have roughly the same strength as a 112-bit symmetric key. These estimates assume no major breakthroughs in solving the underlying mathematical problems that ECC is based on. A message encrypted
