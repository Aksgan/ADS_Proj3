chemistry are a result of interaction either between different chemical substances or between [[matter]] and [[energy]]. Traditional chemistry involves study of [[chemical interaction|interactions]] between [[chemical substance|substances]] in a chemistry [[laboratory]] using various forms of [[laboratory glassware]]. [[Image:Lab bench.jpg|thumb|left|[[Laboratory]], Institute of Biochemistry, [[University of Cologne]]]] A [[chemical reaction]] is a transformation of some substances into one or more other substances.<ref>IUPAC [[Gold Book]] [http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/C01033.pdf Definition]</ref> It can be symbolically depicted through a [[chemical equation]]. The number of atoms on the left and the right in the equation for a chemical transformation is most often equal. The nature of chemical reactions a substance may undergo and the energy changes that may accompany it are constrained by certain basic rules, known as chemical laws. [[Energy]] and [[entropy]] considerations are invariably important in almost all chemical studies. Chemical substances are classified in terms of their [[structure]], phase as well as their [[chemical composition]]s. They can be analyzed using the tools of [[chemical analysis]], e.g. [[spectroscopy]] and [[chromatography]]. [[Scientists]] engaged in chemical [[research]] are known as [[chemists]].<ref>[http://www.calmis.ca.gov/file/occguide/CHEMIST.HTM California Occupational Guide Number 22: Chemists]</ref> Most chemists specialize in one or more sub-disciplines. ==History== {{Main|History of chemistry}} {{See also|Alchemy|Timeline of chemistry|Nobel Prize in Chemistry}} [[Ancient Egypt]]ians pioneered the art of synthetic "wet" chemistry up to 4,000 years ago.<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg16121734.300-first-chemists.html First chemists], February 13, 1999, New Scientist</ref> By 1000 BC ancient civilizations were using technologies that formed the basis of the various branches of chemistry such as; extracting metal from their ores, making pottery and glazes, fermenting beer and wine, making pigments for cosmetics and painting, extracting chemicals from plants for medicine and perfume, making cheese, dying cloth, tanning leather, rendering fat into soap, making glass, and making alloys like bronze. [[Image:Epicurus Louvre.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Democritus]]' atomist philosophy was later adopted by [[Epicurus]] (341–270 BCE).]] The genesis of chemistry can be traced to the widely observed phenomenon of [[combustion|burning]] that led to [[metallurgy]]&mdash;the art and science of processing ores to get metals (e.g. [[History of metallurgy in the Indian subcontinent|metallurgy in ancient India]]). The greed for gold led to the discovery of the process for its purification, even though the underlying principles were not well understood&mdash;it was thought to be a transformation rather than purification. Many scholars in those days thought it reasonable to believe that there exist means for transforming cheaper (base) metals into gold. This gave way to alchemy and the search for the [[Philosopher's Stone]] which was believed to bring about such a transformation by mere touch.<ref>[http://www.chemheritage.org/explore/ancients-time.html Alchemy Timeline] - Chemical Heritage Society</ref> [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[atomism]] dates back to 440 BC, as what might be indicated by the book ''De Rerum Natura'' (The Nature of Things)<ref>{{cite web |last=Lucretius |title=de Rerum Natura (On the Nature of Things) |work=The Internet Classics Archive |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |date=50 BCE |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Carus/nature_things.html |accessdate=2007-01-09}} </ref> written by the Roman [[Lucretius]]<ref>{{cite web |last=Simpson |first=David |title=Lucretius (c. 99 - c. 55 BCE) |work=The Internet History of Philosophy |date=29 June 2005 |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/l/lucretiu.htm |accessdate= 2007-01-09}} </ref> in 50 BC. Much of the early development of purification methods is described by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''. A tentative outline is as follows: # Egyptian alchemy [3,000 BCE – 400 BCE], formulate early "element" theories such as the [[Ogdoad]]. # Greek alchemy [332 BCE – 642 CE], the Greek king [[Alexander the Great]] conquers Egypt and founds [[Alexandria]], having the world's largest library, where scholars and wise men gather to study. # [[Alchemy (Islam)|Arab alchemy]] [642 CE – 1200], the Muslim conquest of Egypt (primarily Alexandria); development of the Scientific Method by [[Alhazen]] and [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] revolutionise the field of Chemistry. Jābir (Latin name Geber) accepted many of the ideas of [[Aristotle]] but also modified Aristotle's ideas.<ref name="chemistry"/> #The House of Wisdom (Arabic: بيت الحكمة‎; Bait al-Hikma), Al-Andalus (Arabic: الأندلس‎) and Alexandria (Arabic: الإسكندرية) become the world leading institutions where scientists of all religious and ethnic backgrounds worked together in harmony expanding the reaches of Chemistry in a time known as the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. #Arabs and Persians continue to dominate the field of Chemistry, mastering it and expanding the boundaries of knowledge and experimentation. Besides technical advances in processes and apparatus, the Arabs had developed and improved the purity of substances such as [[alcohol]]s, [[acid]]s, and [[gunpowder]], which were not available to the Europeans.<ref name="chemistry">Richard Myers (2003).
