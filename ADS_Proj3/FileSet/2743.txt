Language (EL)]] | license = [[Apache License]] | website = http://mvel.codehaus.org/ }} '''MVFLEX Expression Language''' (MVEL) is a hybrid dynamic/statically typed, embeddable [[Expression Language]] and [[Run-time system|runtime]] for the [[Java_Platform#Platform|Java Platform]]. Originally started as a utility language for an application framework, the project is now developed completely independently. MVEL is typically used for exposing basic logic to end-users and programmers through configuration such as [[XML]] files or [[Java annotations|annotations]]. It may also be used to parse simple [[JavaBean]] expressions. The runtime allows MVEL expressions to be executed either interpretively, or through a pre-compilation process with support for runtime [[bytecode]] generation to remove overhead. Since MVEL is meant to augment Java-based software, it borrows most of its syntax directly from the Java programming language with some minor differences and additional capabilities. For example: as a side effect of MVEL's typing model, which treats class and method references as regular variables, it is possible to use both class and function pointers (but only for static methods). <source lang="java"> millis = System.currentTimeMillis; // get millis time = millis(); </source> MVEL also allows collections to be represented as folds (or projections) in a [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]-like syntax. <source lang="java"> namesOfParents = (parent.name in (children in employees)); </source> ==Hello world example== <source lang="java"> System.out.println("Hello, world!"); </source> MVEL relies on Java namespaces and classes, but does not possess the ability to declare namespaces or classes. ==Quicksort Example== Here is an example of the [[Quicksort]] algorithm implemented in MVEL 2.0, demonstrating the scripting capabilities of the language. <source lang="javascript"> import java.util.*; // the main quicksort algorithm def quicksort(list) { if (list.size() <= 1) { list; } else { pivot = list[0]; concat(quicksort(($ in list if $ < pivot)), pivot, quicksort(($ in list if $ > pivot))); } } // define method to concatenate lists. def concat(list1, pivot, list2) { concatList = new ArrayList(list1); concatList.add(pivot); concatList.addAll(list2); concatList; } // create a list to sort list = [5,2,4,1,18,10,15,1,0]; // sort it! quicksort(list); </source> ==See also== {{Portal|Free software}} * [[Java (programming language)|Java]] * [[OGNL]] * [[Expression Language]] ==External links== * [http://mvel.codehaus.org/Language+Guide MVEL Language Guide] {{DEFAULTSORT:Mvel}} [[Category:Scripting languages]] [[Category:Free software programmed in Java]] {{Prog-lang-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>23107</id> <title>M (programming language)</title> <text>{{Distinguish2|the programming language [[MUMPS]], also sometimes known as "M"}} {{Infobox programming language | name = M | logo = | paradigm = | year = 2008 | designer = | developer = [[Microsoft|Microsoft Corporation]] | latest_release_version = | latest_release_date = | latest_test_version = | latest_test_date = | typing = | implementations = | dialects = | influenced_by = | influenced = | operating_system = | license = | website = http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd285282.aspx }} '''M''' is a <ref>[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd285271.aspx M Language Specification - Microsoft February 2009]</ref> [[programming language]] developed by [[Microsoft]].

It runs on Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. The software transcribes dictation recorded by an individual speaker. Typically the speaker will record their dictation using a digital recording device such as a handheld digital recorder, mobile smartphone (e.g. iPhone), or desktop or laptop computer with a suitable microphone. MacSpeech Scribe supports specific audio file formats for recorded dictation: .aif, .aiff, .wav, .mp4, .m4a, and .m4v. MacSpeech Scribe was originally developed by [[MacSpeech]], Inc. and released February 11, 2010 at Macworld Expo in San Francisco. The product is now owned by [[Nuance Communications]] which acquired MacSpeech on February 16, 2010. Nuance is the developer of other speech recognition products including Dragon [[NaturallySpeaking]] for Windows, [[DragonDictate|Dragon Dictate for Mac]] (formerly "[[MacSpeech Dictate]]"), and Dragon Dictation apps for iOS. Jeffery Battersby of Macworld noted in his September 2010 review [http://www.macworld.com/reviews/product/664604/review/scribe_11.html] of MacSpeech Scribe v1.1: <blockquote>Small foibles aside, MacSpeech Scribe is a powerful and intelligent tool for transcribing your recorded speech. A simple training process and access to a wide variety of standard audio formats mean that you’ll be moving your spoken text to the printed page in a matter of minutes and with a minimum of hassle. Scribe is the best, simplest way for you to get your spoken word to the printed page.</blockquote> {| class="wikitable" |- ! Version ! Release Date !
