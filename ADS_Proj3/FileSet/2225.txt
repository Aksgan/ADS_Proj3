While this list of forbidden URLs is only supposed to contain addresses of known child pornography sites, the content of the list is secret.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Many countries, including the United States, have enacted laws against the possession or distribution of certain material, such as [[child pornography]], via the Internet, but do not mandate filtering software. There are many free and commercially available software programs, called [[content-control software]], with which a user can choose to block offensive websites on individual computers or networks, in order to limit a child's access to pornographic materials or depiction of violence. The Internet has been a major outlet for leisure activity since its inception, with entertaining social experiments such as [[MUD]]s and [[MOO]]s being conducted on university servers, and humor-related [[Usenet]] groups receiving much traffic. Today, many [[Internet forum]]s have sections devoted to games and funny videos; short cartoons in the form of [[Flash animation|Flash movies]] are also popular. Over 6 million people use blogs or message boards as a means of communication and for the sharing of ideas. The pornography and [[gambling]] industries have taken advantage of the World Wide Web, and often provide a significant source of advertising revenue for other websites.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Although many governments have attempted to restrict both industries' use of the Internet, this has generally failed to stop their widespread popularity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} One main area of leisure activity on the Internet is [[multiplayer gaming]]. This form of recreation creates communities, where people of all ages and origins enjoy the fast-paced world of multiplayer games. These range from [[MMORPG]] to [[first-person shooter]]s, from [[computer role-playing game|role-playing games]] to [[online gambling]]. This has revolutionized the way many people interact{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} while spending their free time on the Internet. While online gaming has been around since the 1970s,{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} modern modes of online gaming began with subscription services such as [[GameSpy Arcade|GameSpy]] and [[MPlayer.com|MPlayer]]. Non-subscribers were limited to certain types of game play or certain games. Many people use the Internet to access and download music, movies and other works for their enjoyment and relaxation. Free and fee-based services exist for all of these activities, using centralized servers and distributed peer-to-peer technologies. Some of these sources exercise more care with respect to the original artists' copyrights than others. Many people use the World Wide Web to access news, weather and sports reports, to plan and book vacations and to find out more about their interests. People use [[online chat|chat]], [[instant messaging|messaging]] and e-mail to make and stay in touch with friends worldwide, sometimes in the same way as some previously had [[pen pal]]s. The Internet has seen a growing number of [[Web desktop]]s, where users can access their files and settings via the Internet. [[Cyberslacking]] can become a drain on corporate resources; the average UK employee spent 57 minutes a day surfing the Web while at work, according to a 2003 study by Peninsula Business Services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=914&id=1001802003 |title=Net abuse hits small city firms |publisher=News.scotsman.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-07}}</ref> [[Internet addiction disorder]] is excessive computer use that interferes with daily life.
