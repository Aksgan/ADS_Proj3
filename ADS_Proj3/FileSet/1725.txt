In general terms, the angular difference between satellites in each orbit is 30, 105, 120, and 105 degrees apart which, of course, sum to 360 degrees. Orbiting at an altitude of approximately 20,200 kilometers (about 12,550 miles or 10,900 [[nautical mile]]s; orbital radius of approximately 26,600 km (about 16,500 mi or 14,400 NM)), each SV makes two complete orbits each [[sidereal day]], repeating the same ground track each day.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Finding the repeat times of the GPS constellation |author=Agnew, D.C. and Larson, K.M.|journal=GPS Solutions |volume=11 |pages=71–76 |year=2007 |publisher=Springer |doi=10.1007/s10291-006-0038-4 |issue=1 }} [http://spot.colorado.edu/~kristine/gpsrep.pdf This article from author's web site], with minor correction.</ref> This was very helpful during development because even with only four satellites, correct alignment means all four are visible from one spot for a few hours each day.

The additional satellites improve the precision of GPS receiver calculations by providing redundant measurements. With the increased number of satellites, the constellation was changed to a nonuniform arrangement. Such an arrangement was shown to improve reliability and availability of the system, relative to a uniform system, when multiple satellites fail.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Massatt | first = Paul | coauthors = Wayne Brady | url = http://www.aero.org/publications/crosslink/summer2002/index.html | title = Optimizing performance through constellation management | journal = Crosslink | month = Summer | year = 2002 | pages = 17–21 }}</ref> About eight satellites are visible from any point on the ground at any one time (see animation at right). === Control segment === [[File:GPS monitor station.jpg|right|thumb|Ground monitor station used from 1984 to 2007, on display at the [[Air Force Space & Missile Museum]] ]] The control segment is composed of # a master control station (MCS), # an alternate master control station, # four dedicated ground antennas and # six dedicated monitor stations The MCS can also access U.S. Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) ground antennas (for additional command and control capability) and NGA ([[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]]) monitor stations. The flight paths of the satellites are tracked by dedicated U.S. Air Force monitoring stations in [[Hawaii]], [[Kwajalein]], [[Ascension Island]], [[Diego Garcia]], [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]] and Cape Canaveral, along with shared NGA monitor stations operated in England, Argentina, Ecuador, Bahrain, Australia and Washington DC.<ref>US Coast Guard [http://igs.bkg.bund.de/root_ftp/IGS/mail/igsmail/year2005/5209 General GPS News 9-9-05]</ref> The tracking information is sent to the Air Force Space Command's MCS at [[Schriever Air Force Base]] 25 km (16 miles) ESE of Colorado Springs, which is operated by the [[2nd Space Operations Squadron]] (2 SOPS) of the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF). Then 2 SOPS contacts each GPS satellite regularly with a navigational update using dedicated or shared (AFSCN) ground antennas (GPS dedicated ground antennas are located at Kwajalein, Ascension Island, Diego Garcia, and Cape Canaveral). These updates synchronize the atomic clocks on board the satellites to within a few [[nanosecond]]s of each other, and adjust the [[ephemeris]] of each satellite's internal orbital model. The updates are created by a [[Kalman filter]] that uses inputs from the ground monitoring stations, [[space weather]] information, and various other inputs.<ref>[[USNO]] [http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/gpsinfo.html NAVSTAR Global Positioning System]. Retrieved May 14, 2006.</ref> Satellite maneuvers are not precise by GPS standards. So to change the orbit of a satellite, the satellite must be marked ''unhealthy'', so receivers will not use it in their calculation. Then the maneuver can be carried out, and the resulting orbit tracked from the ground. Then the new ephemeris is uploaded and the satellite marked healthy again. === User segment === [[Image:GPS Receivers.jpg|thumb|right|GPS receivers come in a variety of formats, from devices integrated into cars, phones, and watches, to dedicated devices such as those shown here from manufacturers [[Trimble Inc|Trimble]], [[Garmin]] and [[Leica Geosystems|Leica]] (left to right).]] The user segment is composed of hundreds of thousands of U.S. and allied military users of the secure GPS Precise Positioning Service, and tens of millions of civil, commercial
