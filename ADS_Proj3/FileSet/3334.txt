reviews are anonymous and no article is published without being reviewed. Authors have the opportunity to withdraw their article, to revise it in response to the reviews, or to publish it without revision. If the authors proceed with publication of their article despite critical comments, readers can clearly see any negative comments along with the names of the reviewers.<ref>[http://www.biology-direct.com/info/about/ Biology Direct |<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> An extension of peer review beyond the date of publication is [[Open Peer Commentary]], whereby expert commentaries are solicited on published articles, and the authors are encouraged to respond. In the summer of 2009, American academic [[Kathleen Fitzpatrick (American academic)|Kathleen Fitzpatrick]] explored open peer review and commentary in her book, [http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/mcpress/plannedobsolescence/ Planned Obsolescence], which was published by [[MediaCommons]] using [http://www.futureofthebook.org/commentpress/ Commentpress], a [[Wordpress]] plugin that enables readers to comment on and annotate book-length texts. ==See also== * [[Open research]] ==References== {{Reflist|2}} ==External links== * [http://www.joimr.org/phorum/peer-review.htm Open peer review rules at Journal of Independent Medical Research] [[Category:Academic publishing]] [[Category:Scientific method]] [[Category:Academic literature]] [[Category:Peer review]] [[de:Offenes Peer-Review]]</text> </page> <page> <id>27567</id> <title>Open source intelligence</title> <text>{{External links|date=March 2010}} {{Globalize/USA|date=December 2010}} '''Open source intelligence''' ('''OSINT''') is a form of [[intelligence collection management]] that involves finding, selecting, and acquiring information from publicly available sources and analyzing it to produce actionable [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]]. In the [[Intelligence agency|intelligence community]] (IC), the term "open" refers to overt, publicly available sources (as opposed to covert or classified sources); it is not related to [[open-source software]] or public intelligence. ==Open sources for intelligence== OSINT includes a wide variety of information and sources: * [[Media (communication)|Media]]: newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and computer-based information. * [[Web 2.0|Web-based communities]] and [[user generated content]]: social-networking sites, [[video hosting service|video sharing sites]], wikis, blogs, and [[folksonomies]]. * [[Public data]]: government reports, official data such as budgets, demographics, hearings, legislative debates, press conferences, speeches, marine and aeronautical safety warnings, environmental impact statements and contract awards. * Observation and reporting: amateur airplane spotters, radio monitors and [[amateur satellite observer|satellite observer]]s among many others have provided significant information not otherwise available. The availability of worldwide satellite photography, often of high resolution, on the Web (e.g., Google Earth) has expanded open source capabilities into areas formerly available only to major intelligence services. * Professional and academic: conferences, symposia, professional associations, academic papers, and subject matter experts.<ref>Lowenthal, Mark M. ''Intelligence: From Secrets to Policy'', 2nd Ed. (Washington, D.C.: CQ Press, 2003) p. 79.</ref> * Most information has geospatial dimensions, but many often overlook the geospatial side of OSINT: not all open source data is unstructured text. Examples of geospatial open source include hard and softcopy maps, atlases, gazetteers, port plans, gravity data, aeronautical data, navigation data, geodetic data, human terrain data (cultural and economic), environmental data, commercial imagery, [[LIDAR]], hyper and multi-spectral data, airborne imagery, geo-names, geo-features, urban terrain, vertical obstruction data, boundary marker data, geospatial [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|mashups]], [[spatial database]]s, and [[web services]]. Most of the geospatial data mentioned above is integrated, analyzed, and syndicated using geospatial software like a [[GIS|Geographic Information System]] (GIS) not a browser ''per se''. OSINT is distinguished from research in that it applies the [[process of intelligence]] to create tailored knowledge supportive of a specific decision by a specific individual or group.<ref>{{cite web |title=Spy Agencies Turn to Newspapers, NPR, and Wikipedia for Information: The intelligence community is learning to value 'open-source' information |url=http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/national/2008/09/12/spy-agencies-turn-to-newspapers-npr-and-wikipedia-for-information.html |accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref> ==Definers for OSINT== OSINT is defined by both the U.S. [[Director of National Intelligence]] and the U.S. [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD), as "produced from publicly available information that is collected, exploited, and disseminated in a timely manner to an appropriate audience for the purpose of addressing a specific intelligence requirement."<ref>[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ163.109 As defined in Sec. 931 of Public Law 109-163, entitled, "National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006."]</ref> OSINT is, as of 2005, defined by the U.S. [[Office of Management and Budget]] under the category of "Forces And Direct Support" and specifically for the DoD under Commercial Code M320 as<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/procurement/fair/2005_fair/2005_inv_function_codes.html FAIR Act Inventory Commercial Activities Inventory Function Codes]</ref> :''Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) Collection/Processing'' A wide variety of vendors sell information products specifically within this category. Open source intelligence under one name or another has been around for hundreds of years. The significance today of OSINT in the USA is the conflict between military, government and the private sector as to how the bulk of intelligence should be obtained. With the Internet, instant communications, and advanced media search the bulk of actionable and predictive intelligence can be obtained from public, unclassified sources. Government agencies have been slow to embrace OSINT, or believe they already have suitable information feeds from the media, academia and public records. OSINT is especially helpful in addressing [[global coverage]], a term encompassing all of the countries and topics that are not considered by the secret or national security worlds to be "vital." Until recently, that included terrorism.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} ==Competitive intelligence== In the private sector [[competitive intelligence]], focused and directed to specific industries still has opportunities for small and medium businesses to compete in niche markets, but that too is being consolidated by the major information providers. In the media OSINT is considered as nothing new, the everyday operation of a traditional newsroom. [[Investigative journalist]]s use searches, databases, primary interviews, sources, and leaks to write every feature. ==Risks for practitioners== Accredited journalists have some protection in asking questions, and researching for recognized media outlets. Even so they can be imprisoned, even executed, for seeking out OSINT. Private individuals illegally collecting data for a foreign military or intelligence agency is considered [[espionage]] in most countries. Of course, espionage that is not treason (i.e. betraying one's country of citizenship) has been a tool of statecraft since ancient times, is widely engaged in by nearly all countries, and is considered an honorable trade. Most countries recognize this, and if their counterintelligence agencies capture a foreign spy, that spy is usually unceremoniously deported or traded back to their homeland (for other spies) after a hostile debriefing; actual execution or refusal
