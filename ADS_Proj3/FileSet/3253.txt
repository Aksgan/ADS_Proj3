It was written by [[A.S. Douglas|Alexander S. Douglas]] as an illustration for his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] thesis on human-computer interaction for the [[University of Cambridge]]. ''OXO'' was the first digital graphical game to run on a computer.<ref>http://www.pong-story.com/1952.htm</ref> The simulation was played using a rotary telephone controller. OXO is often listed as the first computer game.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} In '''''OXO''''' the player played against the computer, and output was displayed on the computer's 35×16 [[pixel]] [[cathode ray tube]]. The [[source code]] was short, yet it played a perfect game of noughts and crosses. ''OXO'' did not have widespread popularity because the EDSAC was a computer unique to [[Cambridge]]. ==Startscreen== <pre> 9 8 7 NOUGHTS AND CROSSES 6 5 4 BY 3 2 1 A S DOUGLAS, C.1952 LOADING PLEASE WAIT...

It has an innovative visual text-based [[user interface]] for activating commands. == History == The Oberon operating system was originally developed as part of the [[NS320xx|NS32032]]-based [[Ceres (workstation)|Ceres]] workstation project. It is written almost entirely in the [[Oberon (programming language)|Oberon]] [[programming language]]. The basic system was designed and implemented by a team of two part-time programmers at [[ETH Zürich]] (ETHZ), [[Niklaus Wirth]] and Jürg Gutknecht. It was later extended and ported to other hardware by a team at ETHZ. == User interface == Oberon has a [[text user interface]] (TUI). It combines the point-and-click convenience of a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) with the linguistic strength of a [[command line interface]] (CLI) and is closely tied to naming conventions of the Oberon language. Any text appearing on the screen can be edited and used as command input. Nothing like a [[prompt (computing)|prompt]] is required. Although radical, the TUI is efficient and powerful.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} It has yet to appear in more commonplace operating systems, although it strongly inspired [[Rob Pike]]'s [[Acme (text editor)|Acme]] system under [[Plan 9 From Bell Labs|Plan 9]]. Whether it inspired the worksheet interface of the [[Macintosh Programmer's Workshop]] or vice versa is difficult to decide since the Oberon System and its TUI was based on Wirth's previous computer design the [[Lilith (computer)|Lilith]] and both, the Apple [[Macintosh (computer)|Macintosh]] and the [[Lilith (computer)|Lilith]] were inspired by the [[Alto (computer)|Alto]]. == Versions and availability == The Oberon OS is available for several other hardware platforms,
