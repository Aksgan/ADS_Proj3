expose problems systematically and to use the tools where the ideal cannot be achieved. From this perspective, the tools are [[workaround]]s adapted to different situations, which explains any apparent incoherence of the principles above. === Origins === Also known as the flexible mass production, the TPS has two pillar concepts: [[Just-in-time (business)|Just-in-time]] (JIT) or "flow", and "[[autonomation]]" (smart automation).<ref>Suprateek Roy (1988), p 4</ref> Adherents of the Toyota approach would say that the smooth flowing delivery of value achieves all the other improvements as side-effects. If production flows perfectly then there is no inventory; if customer valued features are the only ones produced, then product design is simplified and effort is only expended on features the customer values. The other of the two TPS pillars is the very human aspect of autonomation, whereby automation is achieved with a human touch.<ref>Suprateek Roy (1988), p 6</ref> The "human touch" here meaning to automate so that the machines/systems are designed to aid humans in focusing on what the humans do best. This aims, for example, to give the machines enough intelligence to recognize when they are working abnormally and flag this for human attention. Thus, in this case, humans would not have to monitor normal production and only have to focus on abnormal, or fault, conditions. Lean implementation is therefore focused on getting the right things to the right place at the right time in the right quantity to achieve perfect work flow, while minimizing waste and being flexible and able to change. These concepts of flexibility and change are principally required to allow production leveling, using tools like [[SMED]], but have their analogues in other processes such as [[research and development]] (R&D). The flexibility and ability to change are within bounds and not open-ended, and therefore often not expensive capability requirements. More importantly, all of these concepts have to be understood, appreciated, and embraced by the actual employees who build the products and therefore own the processes that deliver the value. The cultural and managerial aspects of Lean are possibly more important than the actual tools or methodologies of production itself. There are many examples of Lean tool implementation without sustained benefit, and these are often blamed on weak understanding of Lean throughout the whole organization. Lean aims to make the work simple enough to understand, do and manage. To achieve these three goals at once there is a belief held by some that Toyota's mentoring process,(loosely called ''[[Senpai]]'' and ''[[Kohai]]''), which is Japanese for senior and junior, is one of the best ways to foster Lean Thinking up and down the organizational structure. This is the process undertaken by Toyota as it helps its suppliers improve their own production. The closest equivalent to Toyota's mentoring process is the concept of "''[[Lean Sensei]]''," which encourages companies, organizations, and teams to seek outside, third-party experts, who can provide unbiased advice and coaching, (see Womack et al., Lean Thinking, 1998). There have been recent attempts to link Lean to Service Management, perhaps one of the most recent and spectacular of which was London Heathrow Airport's Terminal 5. This particular case provides a graphic example of how care should be taken in translating successful practices from one context (production) to another (services), expecting the same results. In this case the public perception is more of a spectacular failure, than a spectacular success, resulting in potentially an unfair tainting of the lean manufacturing philosophies.<ref>"Problems continue at Heathrow's Terminal 5", New York Times, March 31, 2008 article [http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/03/31/europe/heathrow.php]</ref> ==A brief history of waste reduction thinking== The avoidance and then lateral removal of waste has a long history, and as such this history forms much of the basis of the philosophy now known as "Lean". In fact many of the concepts now seen as key to lean have been discovered and rediscovered over the years by others in their search to reduce waste. === Pre-20th century === [[Image:Benjamin-Franklin-U.S.-$100-bill.jpg|thumb|right|The printer [[Benjamin Franklin]] contributed greatly to waste reduction thinking]] Most of the basic goals of lean manufacturing are common sense, and documented examples can be seen as early as [[Benjamin Franklin]]. ''[[Poor Richard's Almanac]]'' says of wasted time, "He that idly loses 5[[shilling|s.]] worth of time, loses 5s., and might as prudently throw 5s. into the river." He added that avoiding unnecessary costs could be more profitable than increasing sales: "A penny saved is two pence clear. A pin a-day is a [[groat]] a-year. Save and have." Again Franklin's ''[[The Way to Wealth]]'' says the following about carrying unnecessary inventory. "You call them goods; but, if you do not take care, they will prove evils to some of you. You expect they will be sold cheap, and, perhaps, they may [be bought] for less than they cost; but, if you have no occasion for them, they must be dear to you. Remember what Poor Richard says, 'Buy what thou hast no need of, and ere long thou shalt sell thy necessaries.' In another place he says, 'Many have been ruined by buying good penny worths'." [[Henry Ford]] cited Franklin as a major influence on his own business practices, which included [[Just In Time (business)|Just-in-time]] manufacturing. The concept of waste being built into jobs and then taken for granted was noticed by motion efficiency expert [[Frank Gilbreth]], who saw that masons bent over to pick up bricks from the ground. The bricklayer was therefore lowering and raising his entire upper body to pick up a 2.3 kg (5 lb.) brick, and this inefficiency had been built into the job through long practice. Introduction of a non-stooping scaffold, which delivered the bricks at waist level, allowed masons to work about three times as quickly, and with less effort. === 20th century === [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]], the father of [[scientific management]], introduced what are now called standardization and best practice deployment. In his ''[[Principles of Scientific Management]]'', (1911), Taylor said: "And whenever a workman proposes an improvement, it should be the policy of the management to make a careful analysis of the new method,
