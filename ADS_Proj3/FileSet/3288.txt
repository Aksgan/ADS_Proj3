short consulting assignment which Codd undertook for former Arbor Software (later [[Hyperion Solutions]], and in 2007 acquired by Oracle), as a sort of marketing coup. The company had released its own OLAP product, ''[[Essbase]]'', a year earlier. As a result Codd's "twelve laws of online analytical processing" were explicit in their reference to Essbase. There was some ensuing controversy and when Computerworld learned that Codd was paid by Arbor, it retracted the article. OLAP market experienced strong growth in late 90s with dozens of commercial products going into market. In 1998, [[Microsoft]] released its first OLAP Server - [[Microsoft Analysis Services]], which drove wide adoption of OLAP technology and moved it into mainstream. ===Product comparison=== See: [[Comparison of OLAP Servers]]. ===Market structure=== Below is a list of top OLAP vendors in 2006, with figures in millions of [[US Dollar]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olapreport.com/market.htm |title=OLAP Market |publisher=OLAP Report |author=Nigel Pendse |year=2006 |accessdate=2008-03-17 }}</ref> {| border="2" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;" |- bgcolor="#CCCCCC" align="center" !

It overlaps with, but is not identical to, [[e-democracy]]. Online deliberation is very interdisciplinary, and includes practices such as [[online consultation]], [[e-participation]], online [[deliberative polling]], [[online facilitation]], [[online research communities]], interactive [[e-learning]], civic dialogue in [[Internet forums]] and [[online chat]], and group decision making that utilizes [[collaborative software]] and other forms of [[computer-mediated communication]]. Work in all these endeavors is tied together by the challenge of using electronic media in a way that deepens thinking and improves mutual understanding. Open international conferences on online deliberation have been held at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in 2003, [[Stanford University]] in 2005, and the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 2008. The most recent conference was held at the [[University of Leeds]], June 30-July 2, 2010. Attendees of the 2005 conference voted to create an international society for online deliberation, but no formal organization has yet been established.
