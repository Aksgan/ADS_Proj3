The modification of a large equation into smaller form is not difficult. However, it should be noted that an equation set with binary variables cannot be always solved by applying linear algebra. The following is an example for applying the subtraction of two equations: :'''''a''''' '''+''' '''''b''''' '''+''' '''''c''''' '''+''' '''''d''''' '''= 3''' :'''''c''''' '''+''' '''''d''''' '''= 1''' The first statement has four variables whereas the second statement has only two variables. The latter one means that the sum of '''''c''''' and '''''d''''' is '''1'''. Using this fact on the first statement, the equations above can be reduced to :'''''a''''' '''+''' '''''b''''' '''= 2''' :'''''c''''' '''+''' '''''d''''' '''= 1''' ==The algebra on a board== [[File:tentaizu 4x4 example.png|thumb|right|alt=tentaizu_4x4_example|Figure 1: An example puzzle on 4x4 board]] A game based on the algebra with binary variables can be visualized in many different ways. One generic way is to represent the right side of an equation as a clue in a cell (clue cell), and the some neighbors of a clue cell as variables. A simple case is shown in Figure 1. The neighbors can be assumed to be the up/down, left/right, and corner cells that are sharing an edge or a corner. The white cells may contain a hidden object or nothing. In other words, they are the binary variables. They take place on the left side of the equations. Each clue cell, a cell with blue background in Figure 1, contains a positive number corresponding to the number of its neighbors that have hidden objects. The total number of the objects on the board can be given as an additional clue. The same board with variables marked is shown in Figure 2. ===The reduction into a set of equations with binary variables=== The main equation is written by using the total number of the hidden objects given. From the first figure this corresponds to the following equation :'''''a''''' '''+''' '''''b''''' '''+''' '''''c''''' '''+''' '''''d''''' '''+''' '''''e''''' '''+''' '''''f''''' '''+''' '''''h''''' '''+''' '''''i''''' '''+''' '''''j''''' '''+''' '''''k''''' '''+''' '''''m''''' '''= 3''' The other equations are composed one by one for each clue cells: :'''''a''''' '''+''' '''''b''''' '''+''' '''''c''''' '''+''' '''''e''''' '''+''' '''''f''''' '''+''' '''''h''''' '''+''' '''''i''''' '''+''' '''''j''''' '''= 1''' :'''''f''''' '''+''' '''''g''''' '''+''' '''''j''''' '''+''' '''''m''''' '''= 1''' :'''''h''''' '''+''' '''''i''''' '''+''' '''''j''''' '''+''' '''''k''''' '''= 2''' :'''''i''''' '''+''' '''''j''''' '''+''' '''''m''''' '''= 2''' Although there are several ways to solve the equations above, the following explicit way can be applied: #It is known from the equation set that '''''i''''' '''+''' '''''j''''' '''+''' '''''m''''' '''= 2'''. However, since '''''j''''' and '''''m''''' are neighbors of a cell with number '''1''', the following is true: '''''j''''' '''+''' '''''m''''' '''≤ 1'''. This means that the variable '''''i''''' must be '''1'''. #Since '''''i''''' '''= 1''' and the variable '''''i''''' is the neighbor to the clue cell with number '''1''', the variables '''''a''''', '''''b''''', '''''c''''', '''''e''''', '''''f''''', '''''h''''', and '''''j''''' must be zero. The same result can be obtained by replacing '''''i''''' '''= 1''' into the second equation as follows: '''''a''''' '''+''' '''''b''''' '''+''' '''''c''''' '''+''' '''''e''''' '''+''' '''''f''''' '''+''' '''''h''''' '''+''' '''''j''''' '''= 0'''. This is equivalent to '''''a''''' '''= 0''', '''''b''''' '''= 0''', '''''c''''' '''= 0''', '''''e''''' '''= 0''', '''''f''''' '''= 0''', '''''h''''' '''= 0''', '''''j''''' '''= 0'''. #Figure 3 is obtained after Step 1 and Step 2. The grayed cells with '–' are the variables with value '''0'''. The cell with the symbol '''Δ''' corresponds to the variable with value '''1'''. The variable '''''k''''' is the only the neighbor of the left most clue cell with value '''2'''. This clue cell has one neighbor with an object and only one remaining cell with variable '''''k'''''. Therefore '''''k''''' must be '''1'''. #Similarly, the variable '''''m''''' must be '''1''' too because it is the only remaining variable neighbor to the right most clue cell with value '''2'''. #Since '''''k''''' '''= 1''', '''''m''''' '''= 1''' and '''''i''''' '''= 1''', we complete the marking of three hidden objects therefore '''''d''''' '''= 0''', and '''''g''''' '''= 0'''. The final solution is given in Figure 4. {| | [[Image:tentaizu 4x4 example with variables.png|thumb|upright|alt=tentaizu_4x4_example_with_variables|Figure 2: Binary variables are marked]] | [[Image:tentaizu 4x4 example with variables solved partially.png|thumb|upright|alt=tentaizu_4x4_example_solved_partially|Figure 3: The example solved partially]] | [[Image:tentaizu 4x4 example solved.png|thumb|upright|alt=tentaizu_4x4_example_with_variables_solved|Figure 4: The example solved]] |} ===Use of [[Uniqueness|uniqueness]]=== In the example above (Figure 2), the variables '''''a''''', '''''b''''', '''''c''''', and '''''e''''' are the neighbors of the clue cell '''1''' and they are not neighbors of any other cell. It is obvious that the followings are possible solutions: *'''''a''''' '''= 1''', '''''b''''' '''= 0''', '''''c''''' '''= 0''', '''''e''''' '''= 0''' *'''''a''''' '''= 0''', '''''b''''' '''= 1''', '''''c''''' '''= 0''', '''''e''''' '''= 0''' *'''''a''''' '''= 0''', '''''b''''' '''= 0''', '''''c''''' '''= 1''', '''''e''''' '''= 0''' *'''''a''''' '''= 0''', '''''b''''' '''= 0''', '''''c''''' '''= 0''', '''''e''''' '''= 1''' However, if the puzzle is prepared so that we should have one only one (unique) solution, we can set that all these variables '''''a''''', '''''b''''', '''''c''''', and '''''e''''' must be 0. Otherwise there become more than one solutions. ===Use of [[Partition of a set|partitioning]]=== [[File:tentaizu 4x4 example partitioned.png|thumb|right|alt=tentaizu_4x4_example_partitioned|Figure 5: An example for partitioning]] Some puzzle configurations may allow the player to use partitioning<ref>Halmos 1960</ref> for complexity reduction. An example is given in Figure 5. Each partition corresponds to a number of the objects hidden. The sum of the hidden objects in the partitions must be equal to the total number of objects hidden on the board. One possible way to determine a partitioning is to choose the lead clue cells which have no common neighbors. The cells out of the red transparent zones in Figure 5 must be empty, in other word, no hidden objects in the cells out of the red-transparent zones. Since there must be a hidden object within the upper partition zone, the third row from top shouldn't contain a hidden object. This leads to the fact that the two variable cells on the bottom row around the clue cell must have hidden objects. The rest
