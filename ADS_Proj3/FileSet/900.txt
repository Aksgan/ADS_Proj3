This causes problems because the predictions become less accurate as the times passes. The term ''concept'' refers to the quantity you are looking to predict. More generally, it can also refer to other phenomena of interest besides the target concept, such as an input, but, in the context of concept drift, the term commonly refers to the target variable. ==Examples== In a [[fraud detection]] application the target concept may be a [[Binary numeral system|binary]] attribute FRAUDULENT with values "yes" or "no" that indicates whether a given transaction is fraudulent. Or, in a [[weather prediction]] application, there may be several target concepts such as TEMPERATURE, PRESSURE, and HUMIDITY. The behavior of the customers in an [[online shop]] may change over time.

The model may use inputs such as the amount of money spent on [[advertising]], [[Promotion
