The [[hormonal]] communication through blood streams inside the human body is an example of this type of propagation. The flow-based propagation can also be realized by using carrier entities whose motion can be constrained on the average along specific paths, despite showing a random component. A good example of this case is given by [[pheromone|pheromonal]] long range molecular communications.<ref>L. Parcerisa and [[Ian F. Akyildiz]], "Molecular Communication Options for Long Range Nanonetworks," Computer Networks Journal (Elsevier), Vol. 53, No. 16, pp. 2753-2766, November, 2009.</ref> In '''diffusion-based''' molecular communication, the molecules propagate through spontaneous diffusion in a fluidic medium. In this case, the molecules can be subject solely to the laws of diffusion or can also be affected by non-predictable turbulence present in the fluidic medium. Pheromonal communication, when pheromones are released into a fluidic medium, such as air or water, is an example of diffusion-based architecture. Other examples of this kind of transport include [[calcium signaling]] among cells, as well as [[quorum sensing]] among bacteria.<ref name="TechReview">"The challenge of molecular communication", Technology Review (Physics arXiv blog), June 28, 2010.

Each [[morpheme]] may correspond to several such elements, which do not have to form a "subtree". Some recent work in [[theoretical linguistics]] suggests that the "atoms" of syntax are much smaller than [[word]]s or [[morpheme]]s. From that it immediately follows that the responsibility of syntax is not limited to ordering "preconstructed" words. Instead, within the framework of nanosyntax, the words are derived entities built in syntax, rather than primitive elements supplied by a lexicon. The beginnings of nanosyntax can be traced to a 1993 article by [[Kenneth Hale]] and [[Samuel Jay Keyser|S. Jay Keyser]] titled 'On Argument Structure and the Lexical Representation of Syntactic Relations'<ref>Hale, Kenneth and S. Jay Keyser. 1993.

The term nano is used to indicate that the pixel sizes of the cross-sections are in the nanometer range Although a lot of research is done to create nano-CT scanners, currently there are only a few available commercially. The SkyScan-2011 [http://www.skyscan.be] has a range of about 150 to 250 nanometers per pixel with a resolution of 400 nm and a [[field of view]] (FOV) of 200 micrometers. The Xradia nanoXCT [http://www.xradia.com] has a spatial resolution of better than 50 nm and a FOV of 16 micrometers<ref>Tkachuk et. al., 2007, pp. 650-655</ref>. At the Ghent University, the UGCT team developed a nano-CT scanner based on commercially available components. The UGCT facility is an open nano-CT facility giving access to scientists from universities, institutes and industry.

Winter</ref> or a '''plus perfect number'''<ref>{{OEIS|id=A005188}}</ref>) is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. This definition depends on the base ''b'' of the number system used, e.g. ''b'' = 10 for the [[decimal|decimal system]] or ''b'' = 2 for the [[binary numeral system|binary system]]. The definition of a narcissistic number relies on the decimal representation ''n'' = ''d''<sub>''k''</sub>''d''<sub>''k''-1</sub>...''d''<sub>1</sub>''d''<sub>0</sub> of a [[natural number]] ''n'', e.g. :''n'' = ''d''<sub>''k''</sub>·10<sup>''k''-1</sup> + ''d''<sub>''k''-1</sub>·10<sup>''k''-2</sup> + ... + ''d''<sub>2</sub>·10 + ''d''<sub>1</sub>, with ''k'' digits ''d''<sub>''i''</sub> satisfying 0 ≤ ''d''<sub>''i''</sub> ≤ 9. Such a number ''n'' is called narcissistic if it satisfies the condition :''n'' = ''d''<sub>''k''</sub><sup>''k''</sup> + ''d''<sub>''k''-1</sub><sup>''k''</sup> + ... + ''d''<sub>2</sub><sup>''k''</sup> + ''d''<sub>1</sub><sup>''k''</sup>. For example the 3-digit decimal number 153 is a narcissistic number because 153 = 1<sup>3</sup> + 5<sup>3</sup> + 3<sup>3</sup>. Narcissistic numbers can also be defined with respect to [[numeral system]]s with a base ''b'' other than ''b'' = 10. The base-''b'' representation of a natural number ''n'' is defined by :''n'' = ''d''<sub>''k''</sub>''b''<sup>''k''-1</sup> + ''d''<sub>''k''-1</sub>''b''<sup>''k''-2</sup> + ... + ''d''<sub>2</sub>''b'' + ''d''<sub>1</sub>, where the base-''b'' digits ''d''<sub>''i''</sub> satisfy the condition 0 ≤ ''d''<sub>i</sub> ≤ ''b''-1. For example the (decimal) number 17 is a narcissistic number with respect
