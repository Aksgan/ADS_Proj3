The antenna is connected to the screw terminals to the left of center.]] '''Electronic [[Filter (signal processing)|filters]]''' are [[electronic circuit]]s which perform [[signal processing]] functions, specifically to remove unwanted frequency components from the signal, to enhance wanted ones, or both. Electronic filters can be: *[[passive component|passive]] or [[active filter|active]] *[[analog circuit|analog]] or [[digital filter|digital]] *[[high-pass filter|high-pass]], [[low-pass filter|low-pass]], [[band-pass filter|bandpass]], [[band-stop filter|band-reject]] (band reject; notch), or [[all-pass filter|all-pass]]. *[[discrete-time]] (sampled) or [[continuous-time]] *[[linear filter|linear]] or [[non-linear filter|non-linear]] *[[infinite impulse response]] (IIR type) or [[finite impulse response]] (FIR type) The most common types of electronic filters are [[linear filters]], regardless of other aspects of their design. See the article on linear filters for details on their design and analysis. == History == The oldest forms of electronic filters are passive analog linear filters, constructed using only [[resistors]] and [[capacitor]]s or resistors and [[inductor]]s. These are known as RC and RL single-[[Pole (complex analysis)|pole]] filters respectively. More complex multipole LC filters have also existed for many years, and their operation is well understood. Hybrid filters are also possible, typically involving a combination of analog amplifiers with [[mecahnical resonance|mechanical resonators]] or delay lines. Other devices such as [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] [[delay line]]s have also been used as discrete-time filters. With the availability of digital signal processing, active digital filters have become common. == Classification by technology == ===Passive filters=== Passive implementations of linear filters are based on combinations of [[resistor]]s (R), [[inductor]]s (L) and [[capacitor]]s (C). These types are collectively known as ''passive filters'', because they do not depend upon an external power supply and/or they do not contain active components such as transistors. Inductors block high-frequency signals and conduct low-frequency signals, while [[capacitor]]s do the reverse. A filter in which the signal passes through an [[inductor]], or in which a capacitor provides a path to ground, presents less attenuation to low-frequency signals than high-frequency signals and is a ''[[low-pass filter]]''. If the signal passes through a capacitor, or has a path to ground through an inductor, then the filter presents less attenuation to high-frequency signals than low-frequency signals and is a ''[[high-pass filter]]''. [[Resistor]]s on their own have no frequency-selective properties, but are added to inductors and capacitors to determine the ''time-constants'' of the circuit, and therefore the frequencies to which it responds. The inductors and capacitors are the [[Reactance (electronics)|reactive]] elements of the filter. The number of elements determines the order of the filter. In this context, an [[LC circuit|LC tuned circuit]] being used in a band-pass or band-stop filter is considered a single element even though it consists of two components. At high frequencies (above about 100 [[hertz|megahertz]]), sometimes the inductors consist of single loops or strips of sheet metal, and the capacitors consist of adjacent strips of metal. These inductive or capacitive pieces of metal are called [[stub (electronics)|stub]]s. ====Single element types==== [[Image:1st Order Lowpass Filter RC.svg|framed|A low-pass electronic filter realised by an [[RC circuit]]]] The simplest passive filters, [[RC circuit|RC]] and [[RL circuit|RL]] filters, include only one reactive element, except [[Hybrid LC Filter|hybrid LC filter]] which
