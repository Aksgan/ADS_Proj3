itself; but rather a discussion with the intelligence in a format which more closely resembles classical (human) [[psychology]]. If the intelligence cannot be reprogrammed by directly inputting new code, but requires the intelligence to reprogram itself through a process of analysis and decision based on information provided by a human, in order for it to overcome behavior which is inconsistent with the machines purpose or ability to function normally, then artificial psychology is by definition, what is required. The level of complexity that is required before these thresholds are met is currently a subject of extensive debate. The theory of artificial psychology does not address the specifics of what those levels may be, but only that the level is sufficiently complex that the intelligence cannot simply be recoded by a software developer, and therefore dysfunctionality must be addressed through the same processes that humans must go through to address their own dysfunctionalities. Along the same lines, artificial psychology does not address the question of whether or not the intelligence is actually conscience or not. The current level of artificial intelligence in 2008 does not approach any threshold where any of the theories or principles of artificial psychology may even be tested, and therefore, for the foreseeable future, artificial psychology will remain a theoretical discipline.

Stone masonry utilizing dressed stones is known as ashlar masonry, whereas masonry using irregularly shaped stones is known as rubble masonry. Ashlar blocks are large rectangular [[cuboid]] blocks that are [[masonry]] [[sculpt]]ed to have square edges and smooth faces. The blocks are generally about {{convert|35|cm}} in height. When shorter than {{convert|30|cm}}, they are usually called “small ashlar”. Ashlar blocks were used in the [[construction]] of many old buildings as an alternative to [[brick]]. Generally the external face is smooth or [[polished]]; occasionally it can be decorated by small grooves achieved by the application of a metal comb. (This process is usually used only on a softer stone ashlar block. The decoration is known as ''mason's drag''.)<ref name="Dundee"> {{cite web | url = http://www.trp.dundee.ac.uk/research/glossary/ashlar.html | title = The Conservation Glossary | publisher = University of Dundee | accessdate = 2009-05-04 }}</ref> ==Etymology== {{wiktionary}} [[Middle English]]: from [[Old French]] ''aisselier'', from [[Latin]] ''axilla'', diminutive of ''axis'', ‘plank.’ ==Scope== In [[Classical architecture]], ''ashlar'' wall surfaces are contrasted with [[Rustication (architecture)|rustication]]. The term is frequently used to describe the dressed stone work of [[Aegean civilization|prehistoric Greece and Crete]], although the dressed blocks are usually much larger than the {{convert|30|cm}} to {{convert|35|cm}} mentioned above. For example, the ''tholos'' tombs of [[Bronze Age]] [[Mycenae]] use ashlar masonry in the construction of the so-called “bee-hive” dome. This dome consists of finely cut ashlar blocks that decrease in size and terminate in a central “[[capstone]]”.<ref name="Preziosi"> {{cite book | last = Preziosi | first = D.|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2tn3ffOnbocC&pg=PA175 | coauthors = Hitchcock, L.A.|isbn=0192842080 | title = Aegean Art and Architecture | year = 1999 | series = Oxford History of Art | pages = 175–6 }}</ref> These domes are not true domes, but are constructed using the [[corbel arch]]. Ashlar masonry is also heavily used in the construction of palace facades on [[Crete]], including [[Knossos]] and [[Phaistos]]. These constructions date to the [[MM III-LM Ib]] period, ca. 1700–1450 BC. ==Freemasonry== In some [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] jurisdictions, ashlars are used as a symbolic metaphor for progress. A rough ashlar is a stone as taken directly from the quarry, and allegorically represents the Freemason prior to his initiation; a smooth ashlar (or "perfect ashlar") is a stone that has been smoothed and dressed by the experienced stonemason, and allegorically represents the Freemason who, through education and diligence, has learned the lessons of Freemasonry and who lives an upstanding life. ==References== {{Reflist}} [[Category:Masonry]] [[Category:Construction]] [[Category:Architectural elements]] [[Category:Garden features]] [[Category:Masonic symbolism]] [[an:Piedra picata]] [[ca:Carreu]] [[da:Kvadersten]] [[de:Werkstein]] [[es:Sillar]] [[eu:Harlandu]] [[fr:Pierre de taille]] [[nl:Parement]] [[ja:切石積み]] [[pt:Silhar]] [[ru:Белый камень]] [[sv:Kvadersten]]</text> </page> <page> <id>2516</id> <title>Asian American studies</title> <text>{{unreferenced|date=April 2007}} '''Asian American Studies''' is an academic discipline which studies the experience of people of Asian ancestry in America. Closely related to other [[Ethnic Studies]] disciplines such as [[African American Studies]], [[Latino/a Studies]], and [[Native American Studies]], Asian American Studies critically examines the history, culture, politics, issues, and experiences of [[Asian Americans]]. Drawing from numerous disciplines such as [[sociology]], [[history]], [[literature]], [[political science]], and [[gender studies]], Asian American Studies scholars consider a variety of perspectives and employ diverse analytical tools in their work. Unlike "Asian" Studies which focuses on the history, culture, religion, etc. of Asian people living in Asia, Asian American Studies is interested in the history, culture, experiences, of Asians living in America. ==History== Asian American Studies was born in the 1960s as a part of the third world movement on the West Coast that gave birth to African American Studies, Chicano/Latino Studies, and Native American Studies. While African American Studies, and to a lesser extent Chicano/Latino Studies, have spread quickly to hundreds of colleges and universities around the U.S., Asian American Studies (mostly due to smaller numbers of Asian Americans
