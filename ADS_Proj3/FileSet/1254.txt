Henry Bruce for a routine traffic stop. Both had felony records, the officer found a .38-caliber revolver in the car. Because no other known crimes had been committed at the time the gun was found, officers took their time getting ballistics exams done of the gun. Several months later, when the gun was test-fired, police found that its bullet matched a bullet already in the imaging system, that slug had come from Cain's body. With the information, Reynolds and Bruce were questioned and eventually confessed to the murder. It turned out Cain had run into the men while they were in the midst of a day-long robbery spree and they had shot Cain while attempting to escape.

[[File:Bullet mark.jpg|frame|Drugfire can identify Firing pin impressions or Breechface and ejector marks to identify a bullet and the gun it was fired from.]] == How Drugfire Differs from the Old Method of Identifying Shot Casings == Before Drugfire was invented, firearm examiners had to rely on a technique devised in the 1920s to compare ammunition markings, this involved looking at a casing under a microscope and the examiner had to compare the two casings to see if there were similar markings on the bullet which would most likely mean that the bullets had been fired from the same gun<ref> http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/1997/05/19/focus6.html Retrieved on February 5th 2008 - How Drugfire identifies bullet casings</ref>. == Statistics of Drugfire's Usage == Drugfire has been considered by many experts to be a widespread success because it has resulted in many previously unsolved "[[Cold case (criminology)|cold case]]s" being solved <ref> http://www.fdle.state.fl.us/publications/tech_success_stories/DRUGFIRE.htm - Retrieved on February 8th 2008 - Info about the success of Drugfire </ref>.

Dual-channel-enabled memory controllers utilize two 64-bit data channels. == Operation == Dual-channel architecture requires a dual-channel-capable motherboard and two or more [[DDR SDRAM|DDR]], [[DDR2 SDRAM]], or [[DDR3 SDRAM]] memory modules. The memory modules are installed into matching banks, which are usually color coded on the [[motherboard]]. These separate channels allow each memory module access to the memory controller, increasing throughput bandwidth. It is not required that identical
