Not only was she one of the first women in space, but in [[weightlessness]], she displayed a halo of flowing locks, a startling sight to many viewers who were accustomed to seeing closely cropped men. During the flight, she was acclaimed for her weightless acrobatics and a playful sense of humor, once holding a sign reading "Hi Dad" up to the camera, and displaying a sticker on her flight locker that advertised her crush on actor [[Tom Selleck]].<ref>{{Cite web | last = Wade | first = Mark | title = Resnik | url=http://www.astronautix.com/astros/resnik.htm | accessdate = 2009-11-21 }} </ref> Since her death, Resnik has been awarded many posthumous honors. Numerous public buildings and facilities have been named after her, mostly schools and educational facilities, including a dormitory at her [[alma mater]], Carnegie Mellon, and the main engineering lecture hall at the University of Maryland. The [[IEEE Judith A. Resnik Award]] was established in 1986 by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] and is presented annually to an individual or team in recognition of outstanding contributions to space engineering in areas of relevance to the IEEE.<ref name="IEEE">{{cite web |title=IEEE Judith A.

Resnik has been portrayed in numerous works of nonfiction and fiction, including the 1990 [[made for TV movie]] ''[[Challenger (1990 film)|Challenger]]'' where [[Julie Fulton]] played as her.

To circumvent this problem, various numeric or diagram-based notation systems have been developed to facilitate communication of patterns or tricks between jugglers, as well the investigation and discovery of new patterns. ==Diagram-based systems== While diagrams are the most visual and reader-friendly way to notate many juggling patterns, they rely on images, so are complicated to produce and unwieldy to share via text or speech. * '''Ladder diagrams''' - Each rung on the "ladder" represents a point in time (or "beat"). The juggled objects are represented as lines, their paths through time and between a pair of hands. * '''Causal diagrams''' - Similar to the ladder diagram but doesn't show the props held in a juggler's hands. Instead it only shows each "problem" &mdash; an incoming prop &mdash; and what the juggler should do to make space in his or her hands to catch that incoming prop. It is usually used for [[passing (juggling)|club passing]] and can be displayed or edited in some juggling software. *'''Mills Mess State Transition Diagrams''' - [[Mills Mess]] is a popular pattern in which the arms cross and uncross. Mills Mess State Transition Diagrams can be used to track these basic arm movements. ==Numeric systems== The following notation systems use only numbers and common characters. The patterns can easily be communicated by text. Most numeric systems are designed to be processed by software juggling
