[[ULE scheduler]] has seen much improvement but a decision was made to ship the 7.0 release with the older 4BSD scheduler, leaving ULE as a kernel compile-time tunable. In FreeBSD 7.1 ULE was the default for the i386 and AMD64 architectures. Starting from version 7.1 [[DTrace]] was also integrated and FreeBSD 7.2 brought support for multi-IPv4/IPv6 [[FreeBSD jail|jails]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freebsd.org/releases/7.2R/announce.html|title=FreeBSD 7.2-RELEASE Announcement|publisher=freebsd.org|accessdate=2009-05-04}}</ref> Code supporting the [[DEC Alpha]] architecture (supported since FreeBSD 4.0) was removed in FreeBSD 7.0.<ref name=alpha-7.0>{{cite web|url=http://www.freebsd.org/releases/7.0R/relnotes.html|title=FreeBSD 7.0-RELEASE Release Notes|publisher=freebsd.org|accessdate=2009-05-03}}</ref> ===FreeBSD 8=== FreeBSD 8.1 is the latest stable release of FreeBSD, having been [[Branching (software)|branched]] from the trunk in June 2010. It features [[Page (computer memory)#Huge_pages|superpages]], [[Xen]] DomU support, network stack virtualization, [[stack-smashing protection]], TTY layer rewrite, much improved [[ZFS]] support, a new [[USB]] stack, [[multicast]] updates including [[Internet Group Management Protocol|IGMPv3]], and rewritten [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]] client/server introducing [[NFSv4]]. Inclusion of improved device mmap() extensions enables implementation of a 64-bit Nvidia display driver for the x86-64 platform.
