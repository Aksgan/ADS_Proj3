He also commented, "... cyberpunk films are very difficult to describe to a third person. I'd imagine that ''The Matrix'' is the kind of film that was very difficult to draw up a written proposal for to take to film studios." He stated that since ''Ghost in the Shell'' had gained recognition in America, the Wachowski brothers used it as a "promotional tool".<ref name="south bank show">[[Mitsuhisa Ishikawa]], interviewed in ''[[The South Bank Show]]'', episode broadcast 19 February 2006 [http://www.itv.com/page.asp?partid=2701]</ref> Besides ''Ghost in the Shell'', another Japanese [[anime]] which influenced ''The Matrix'' was the 1985 film ''[[Megazone 23]]'', directed by [[Noboru Ishiguro]] and [[Shinji Aramaki]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Megazone 23|publisher=[[A.D.

As in the film, the [[Matrix (Doctor Who)|Matrix]] of that series (introduced in the 1976 serial ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'') is a massive computer system which one enters using a device connecting to the head, allowing users to see representations of the real world and change its laws of physics; but if killed there, they will die in reality.<ref>Condon, Paul.

The film also shares many ideas with [[Grant Morrison]]'s [[Counterculture|counter-culture]] comic book ''[[The Invisibles]]'' and Morrison states that the comic book could be found in the film's settings. However, most of the similarities between the two works can be, probably, explained by the common influence received from the works of [[Carlos Castaneda]]<ref>http://www.consciencia.org/castaneda/castaneda-matrix.html</ref><ref>http://www.barbelith.com/topic/7699</ref><ref>http://www.barbelith.com/bomb/1_2.htm</ref><ref>http://www.manwithoutfear.com/messageboard/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=2223&view=previous&sid=78ca2f9aa26ea99f11b8c37ded719933</ref> that is fairly obvious and extensive in the first film and in the volume I of the comic book.<ref>http://groups.google.com.br/group/rec.arts.comics.dc.vertigo/browse_thread/thread/dbb72191f2048789/50f9a3c7ac5a473d?hl=pt-BR&q=morrison+carlos+castaneda+invisibles</ref> Morrison acknowledged the influence though he, indeed, believes in the debt of the Wachowski's brothers to his work. The "inheritance chain" here is a problem of difficult solution since the borrowings were, in both cases, quite literal and similar.

Though Matrixists cite references to "the matrix" from a text of the Bahá'í Faith, called "The Promulgation of Universal Peace", to make a connection with broader world religious history, the commercial Matrix trilogy, along with related mass media products such as video games, is generally considered to be the "sacred text" of the movement. Matrixism carries with it four main beliefs that are described as "The Four Tenets of Matrixism".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newmatrixism.com/tenets |title=The Tenets of
