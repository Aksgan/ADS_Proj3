to the design that allow for faster processing or have found a way to increase yield or improve the "bin splits" (i.e. create faster transistors and hence faster CPUs). One result of some new steppings is that altered the CPU design is improved such that it overclocks better than others.<ref name="JumpingJack"/> Many CPUs have a means of interrogating them in order to discover their stepping level. For example, on [[x86]] CPUs executing the [[CPUID]] with the EAX register set to '1' will place values in other registers that show the CPUs stepping level. ==References== <references/> [[Category:Central processing unit]]</text> </page> <page> <id>35748</id> <title>Sternberg peer review controversy</title> <text>{{Merge from|Richard Sternberg|discuss=Talk:Sternberg peer review controversy#Merger proposal|date=January 2011}} The '''Sternberg peer review controversy''' concerns the conflict arising from the publication of an article supporting the [[controversy|controversial]] concept of [[intelligent design]] in a scientific journal, and the subsequent questions of whether proper editorial procedures had been followed and whether it was properly [[peer review]]ed. One of the primary criticisms of the [[intelligent design movement]] is that there are no research papers supporting their positions in peer reviewed [[scientific journal]]s.<ref>Judge [[John E. Jones III]]: "A final indicator of how ID has failed to demonstrate scientific warrant is the complete absence of peer-reviewed publications supporting the theory...The evidence presented in this case demonstrates that ID is not supported by any peer-reviewed research, data or publications."

On 7 September 2004, the publisher of the journal, the Council of the Biological Society of Washington, released a statement repudiating the article: {{quotation|''The paper by Stephen C. Meyer, "The origin of biological information and the higher taxonomic categories", in vol. 117, no. 2, pp. 213-239 of the Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington, was published at the discretion of the former editor, Richard v. Sternberg. Contrary to typical editorial practices, the paper was published without review by any associate editor; Sternberg handled the entire review process. The Council, which includes officers, elected councilors, and past presidents, and the associate editors would have deemed the paper inappropriate for the pages of the Proceedings because the subject matter represents such a significant departure from the nearly purely systematic content for which this journal has been known throughout its 122-year history.
