or AB push–pull circuits are the most common design type found in audio power amplifiers. Class AB is widely considered a good compromise for audio amplifiers, since much of the time the music is quiet enough that the signal stays in the "class A" region, where it is amplified with good fidelity, and by definition if passing out of this region, is large enough that the distortion products typical of class B are relatively small. The crossover distortion can be reduced further by using negative feedback. Class B and AB amplifiers are sometimes used for RF linear amplifiers as well. Class B amplifiers are also favored in battery-operated devices, such as [[transistor radio]]s. ==== Digital class B ==== A limited power output class B amplifier with a single-ended supply rail of 5±0.5 V. === Class C === [[File:Electronic Amplifier Class C.png|right|thumb|Class C amplifier]] Class C amplifiers conduct less than 50% of the input signal and the distortion at the output is high, but high efficiencies (up to 90%) are possible. Some applications (for example, [[megaphone]]s) can tolerate the distortion. A much more common application for class C amplifiers is in RF [[transmitter]]s, where the distortion can be vastly reduced by using tuned loads on the amplifier stage. The input signal is used to roughly switch the amplifying device on and off, which causes pulses of current to flow through a [[LC circuit|tuned circuit]]. The class C amplifier has two modes of operation: tuned and untuned.<ref>A.P. Malvino, ''Electronic Principles'' (2nd Ed.1979. ISBN 0-07-039867-4) p.299.</ref> The diagram shows a waveform from a simple class C circuit without the tuned load. This is called untuned operation, and the analysis of the waveforms shows the massive distortion that appears in the signal. When the proper load (e.g., a pure inductive-capacitive filter) is used, two things happen. The first is that the output's bias level is clamped, so that the output variation is centered at one-half of the supply voltage. This is why tuned operation is sometimes called a ''clamper''. This action of elevating bias level allows the waveform to be restored to its proper shape, allowing a complete waveform to be re-established despite having only a one-polarity supply. This is directly related to the second phenomenon: the waveform on the center frequency becomes much less distorted. The distortion that is present is dependent upon the [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the tuned load, with the center frequency seeing very little distortion, but greater attenuation the farther from the tuned frequency that the signal gets. The tuned circuit will only resonate at particular frequencies, and so the unwanted frequencies are dramatically suppressed, and the wanted full signal (sine wave) will be extracted by the tuned load (e.g., a high-quality bell will ring at a particular frequency when it is hit periodically with a hammer). Provided the transmitter is not required to operate over a very wide band of frequencies, this arrangement works extremely well. Other residual harmonics can be removed using a filter. === Class D === {{Main|Class D amplifier}} [[Image:Pwm amp.svg|thumb|400px|Block diagram of a basic switching or PWM (class D) amplifier.]] [[File:Inside of a Boss Audio DD3600 Class D mono block amp.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Boss Audio]] class D mono [[car audio]] amplifier with a [[low pass filter]] for powering [[subwoofers]]]] In the [[class D amplifier]] the input signal is converted to a sequence of higher voltage output pulses. The averaged-over-time power values of these pulses are directly proportional to the instantaneous amplitude of the input signal. The frequency of the output pulses is typically ten or more times the highest frequency in the input signal to be amplified. The output pulses contain inaccurate spectral components (that is, the pulse frequency and its [[harmonics]]) which must be removed by a low-pass passive [[electronic filter|filter]]. The resulting filtered signal is then an amplified replica of the input. These amplifiers use [[pulse width modulation]], [[pulse density modulation]] (sometimes referred to as pulse frequency modulation) or more advanced form of modulation such as [[Delta-sigma modulation]] (for example, in the Analog Devices AD1990 class D audio power amplifier). Output stages such as those used in [[pulse generator]]s are examples of class D amplifiers. The term ''class D'' is usually applied to devices intended to reproduce signals with a bandwidth well below the switching frequency. Class D amplifiers can be controlled by either [[analog circuit|analog]] or [[digital circuit]]s. The digital control introduces additional distortion called ''quantization error'' caused by its conversion of the input signal to a digital value. The main advantage of a class D amplifier is power efficiency. Because the output pulses have a fixed amplitude, the switching elements (usually [[MOSFET]]s, but valves and [[bipolar transistor]]s were once used) are switched either completely on or completely off, rather than operated in linear mode. A MOSFET operates with the lowest resistance when fully-on and thus has the lowest power dissipation when in that condition, except when fully off. When operated in a linear mode the MOSFET has variable amounts of resistance that vary linearly with the input voltage and the resistance is something other than the minimum possible, therefore more electrical energy is dissipated as heat. Compared to class A/B operation, class D's lower losses permit the use of a smaller [[heat sink]] for the MOSFETS while also reducing the amount of AC [[power supply]] power required. Thus, class D amplifiers do not need as large or as heavy power supply transformers or heatsinks, so they are smaller and more compact in size than an equivalent class AB amplifier. Class D amplifiers have been widely used to control [[Electric motor|motor]]s, and almost exclusively for small DC motors, but they are now also used as audio amplifiers, with some extra circuitry to allow analogue to be converted to a much higher frequency pulse width modulated signal. The relative difficulty of achieving good audio quality means that nearly all are used in applications where quality is not a factor, such as modestly-priced bookshelf audio systems and "DVD-receivers" in mid-price home theater systems.
