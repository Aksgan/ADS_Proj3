the basic functions. ===Security=== The DECT media access control layer also provides [[encryption]] services with the [[DECT Standard Cipher]] (DSC). The encryption is [[Key size|fairly weak]], using a 35-bit [[initialization vector]] and encrypting the voice stream with 64-bit encryption. The security algorithm has been broken.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.heise-online.co.uk/security/25C3-Serious-security-vulnerabilities-in-DECT-wireless-telephony--/news/112326 | title = Serious security vulnerabilities in DECT wireless telephony | publisher = Heise | date = 2008-12-29 }}</ref><ref name="25c3">{{cite paper | url = https://dedected.org/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/attachment/wiki/25C3/talk-25c3.pdf?format=raw | first = Andreas | last = Schuler | coauthors = Tews, Erik; Weinmann, Ralf-Philipp | title = deDECTed.org | date = 2008-12-29 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://dedected.org/trac/attachment/wiki/DSC-Analysis/FSE2010-166.pdf | title = Cryptanalysis of the DECT Standard Cipher | first1 = Karsten | last1 = Nohl | first2 = Erik | last2 = Tews | first3 = Ralf-Philipp | last3 = Weinmann | date = 2010-04-04 }}</ref> Another attack involves impersonating a DECT base station, which allows calls to be listened to, recorded, and re-routed to a different destination.<ref name="25c3" /> ==DECT for data networks== Other interoperability profiles exist in the DECT suite of standards, and in particular the DPRS (DECT Packet Radio Services) bring together a number of prior interoperability profiles for the use of DECT as a wireless LAN and wireless internet access service. With good range (up to 200 m indoors and 6 km using directional antennae outdoors), dedicated spectrum, high interference immunity, open interoperability and data speeds of around 500 kbit/s, DECT appeared at one time to be a superior alternative to [[Wi-Fi]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://scitation.aip.org/vsearch/servlet/VerityServlet?KEY=CCEJEL&smode=strresults&sort=chron&maxdisp=25&threshold=0&possible1=flatman&possible1zone=article&OUTLOG=NO&viewabs=CCEJEL&key=DISPLAY&docID=1&page=1&chapter=0 | title = Wireless LANs: developments in technology and standards | publisher = IEE Journal of Computing and Control Engineering | date = 1994-10 }}</ref> The protocol capabilities built into the DECT networking protocol standards were particularly good at supporting fast roaming in the public space, between hotspots operated by competing but connected providers. The first DECT product to reach the market, Olivetti's [[Net3|Net<sup>3</sup>]], was a wireless LAN, and German firms [[Dosch & Amand]] and [[Hoeft & Wessel]] built niche businesses on the supply of data transmission systems based on DECT. However, the timing of the availability of DECT, in the mid 1990s, was too early to find wide application for wireless data outside niche industrial applications. Whilst contemporary providers of Wi-Fi struggled with the same issues, providers of DECT retreated to the more immediately lucrative market for cordless telephones. A key weakness was also the inaccessibility of the U.S. market, due to FCC spectrum restrictions at that time. By the time mass applications for wireless Internet had emerged, and the U.S. had opened up to DECT, well into the new century, the industry had moved far ahead in terms of performance and DECT's time as a wireless data transport had passed. ===Radio links=== DECT operates in the 1880–1900 MHz band and defines ten channels from 1881.792 MHz to 1897.344 MHz with a band gap of 1728 kHz. Each base station frame provides 12 duplex speech channels, with each time slot occupying any channel. DECT operates in multicarrier/TDMA/TDD structure. DECT also provides [[Frequency-hopping spread spectrum]] over [[Time division multiple access|TDMA]]/TDD structure. If frequency-hopping is avoided, each base station can provide up to 120 channels in the DECT spectrum before frequency reuse. Each time slot can be assigned to a different channel in order to exploit advantages of frequency-hopping and to avoid interference from other users in asynchronous fashion.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} == DECT 6.0 == The "6.0" in '''DECT 6.0''' does not specify a spectrum band, but is a marketing term coined by Rick Krupka, Director of Cordless Products at [[Siemens]], for DECT devices manufactured for use in the U.S. and Canada. Although DECT 6.0 operates at 1.9 GHz, he realized the term '''DECT 1.9''' might have confused customers who equate larger numbers (such as the '''2.4''' and '''5.8''' in existing 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz cordless telephones) with later products. The DECT and DECT 6.0 technologies are nearly identical, except for operating frequency. As DECT 6.0 does not operate in the 2.4 GHz [[ISM band]], it is not subject to the interference arising in this band from its use by [[IEEE 802.11b-1999|802.11b]] and [[IEEE 802.11g-2003|802.11g]] WiFi, and 2.4 GHz cordless phones. == XDECT R == XDECT R is a [[Uniden]] technology for extending the range of DECT phones (apparently indefinitely) by using multiple repeater stations.<ref>Uniden Press release http://www.uniden.com.au/new_zealand/n_news.asp?page=1#Signal%20loud%20and%20clear%20from%20Bondi%20to%20Bronte</ref> The company has demonstrated the technology to a 2.2 kilometre range in Australia.<ref>http://www.uniden.com.au/AUSTRALIA/XDECTR_RangeTestPopUp.html</ref> XDECTR is not a "technology" but a marketing term used by Uniden to differentate their products for the consumer. ==Health and safety== {{See also|Wireless electronic devices and health}} DECT is a microwave technology, with science similar to mobile phones, baby monitors, Wi-Fi, and other cordless telephone technologies. As with all such technologies, consensus is that there are negligible health effects from the microwave radiation. Most studies have shown either no health effects, or have been inconclusive. Nevertheless, there has been persistent controversy over their health safety, and some national and international agencies have made specific recommendations about exposure.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/features/qa/30/en|title= What are the health risks associated with mobile phones and their base stations?|accessdate=2008-01-19|date= 2005-12-05|work= Online Q&A|publisher= [[World Health Organization]]}}</ref> ==See also== *[[Generic access profile]] (GAP) *[[GSM Interworking Profile (DECT)|GSM Interworking Profile]] (GIP) *[[IP-DECT]] *[[CorDECT]] *[[Unlicensed Personal Communications Services]] *[[Wireless local loop]] *[[Microcell]] *[[CT2]] (DECT's predecessor) *[[Wideband Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications|WDECT]] *[[Net3|Net<sup>3</sup>]] *[[Cat-iq]] *[[Cordless telephone]] ==References== General references: {{refbegin}} * {{cite book | title = Cordless Telecommunications Worldwide | publisher = Springer | year = 1996 | first = Wally H.W. | last = Tuttlebee | isbn = 978-3540199700 }} * {{cite book | title = Personal Wireless Communication with DECT and PWT | publisher = Artech | year = 1998 | first = John A. | last = Phillips | coauthors = Mac Namee, Gerard | isbn = 978-0890068724 }} * {{cite web | url = http://einstein.informatik.uni-oldenburg.de/rechnernetze/seite24.htm | title = Rechnernetze – The DECT Standard | date = 2007-03-13 | accessdate = 2008-12-29 | author = Prof. Dr. W.
