Formalisms depicting transport networks include membrane systems and [[brane calculi]]<ref name=Cardelli>Cardelli, L.

Springer, 2005.</ref>. === Synthetic biology === : ''Further information: [[synthetic biology]]'' Synthetic biology aims at engineering synthetic biological components, with the ultimate goal of assembling whole biological systems from their constituent components. The history of synthetic biology can be traced back to the [[1960s]], when [[Francois Jacob]] and [[Jacques Monod]] discovered the mathematical logic in gene regulation. Genetic engineering techniques, based on [[recombinant DNA]] technology, are a precursor of today's synthetic biology which extends these techniques to entire systems of genes and gene products. Along with the possibility of synthesizing longer and longer DNA strands, the prospect of creating synthetic genomes with the purpose of building entirely artificial [[synthetic organism]]s became a reality. Indeed, rapid assembly of chemically synthesized short DNA strands made it possible to generate a 5386bp synthetic genome of a virus.<ref name="Smith03">Smith, H., Hutchison III, C., Pfannkoch, C., and Venter, C.

''PNAS 100'', 26 (2003), 15440-15445.</ref> Alternatively, Smith et al. found about 100 genes that can be removed invidually from the genome of ''[[Mycoplasma Genitalium]]''. This discovery paves the way to the assembly of a minimal but still viable artificial genome consisting of the essential genes only. A third approach to engineering semi-synthetic cells is the construction of a single type of RNA-like molecule with the ability of self-replication.<ref name="SLS04">Sazani, P., Larralde, R., Szostak, J.

Another effort in this field is towards engineering multi-cellular systems by designing, e.g., [[cell signaling|cell-to-cell communication modules]] used to coordinate living bacterial cell populations.<ref name="WeKn01">Weiss, R., Knight, Jr., T.

[[cellular computing]], or [[in-vivo computing]]) is another approach to understand nature as computation. One particular study in this area is that of the computational nature of gene assembly in unicellular organisms called [[ciliate]]s. Ciliates store a copy of their DNA containing functional genes in the [[macronucleus]], and another "encrypted" copy in the [[micronucleus]]. Conjugation of two ciliates consists of the exchange of their micronuclear genetic information, leading to the formation of two new micronuclei, followed by each ciliate re-assembling the information from its new micronucleus to construct a new functional macronucleus. The latter process is called [[gene assembly]], or gene re-arrangement. It involves re-ordering some fragments of DNA ([[permutation]]s and possibly [[inversion]]) and deleting other fragments from the micronuclear copy. From the computational point of view, the study of this gene assembly process led to many challenging research themes and results, such as the Turing universality of various models of this process. <ref>Landweber, L. and Kari, L.
