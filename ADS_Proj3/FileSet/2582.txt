product has a different name, the [[inner product|hermitian inner product]], with different properties: [[Conjugate (algebra)|conjugate]] symmetric, [[bilinear]], and [[positive definite]].<ref>Birkhoff and MacLane (1979: 369).</ref> *[[Graded vector space]]: a vector space such that the members of ''M'' have a [[direct sum of vector spaces|direct sum]] decomposition. See [[graded algebra]] below. Structures that build on the notion of vector space: *[[Matroid]]: *[[Antimatroid]]: ===Multilinear algebras=== '''Four''' [[binary operation]]s. Two sets, ''V'' and ''K'': # The members of ''V'' are [[multivector]]s (including [[vector space|vectors]]), denoted by lower case Latin letters. ''V'' is an [[abelian group]] under [[multivector]] addition, and a [[monoid]] under [[outer product]]. The outer product goes under various names, and is [[tensor (intrinsic definition)|multilinear]] in principle but usually [[bilinear]]. The outer product defines the multivectors recursively starting from the vectors. Thus the members of ''V'' have a "degree" (see [[graded algebra]] below). Multivectors may have an [[inner product]] as well, denoted ''u''•''v'': ''V''×''V''→''K'', that is [[symmetric]], [[linear]], and [[positive definite]]; see [[inner product space]] above. # The properties and notation of ''K'' are the same as those of ''R'' above, except that ''K'' may have -1 as a distinguished member. ''K'' is usually the [[real field]], as multilinear algebras are designed to describe physical phenomena without [[complex number]]s. # The [[scalar multiplication]] of scalars and multivectors, ''V''×''K''→''V'', has the same properties as [[Module (mathematics)|module]] scalar multiplication. *[[Symmetric algebra]]: a [[unital algebra|unital]] commutative algebra with vector multiplication. * [[Universal enveloping algebra]]: Given a [[Lie algebra]] ''L'' over ''K'', the "most general" [[unital algebra|unital]] [[associative algebra|associative ''K''-algebra]] ''A'', such that the Lie algebra ''A<sub>L</sub>'' contains ''L''. **[[Hopf algebra]]: ***[[Group Hopf algebra]]: * [[Graded algebra]]: an associative algebra with [[unital algebra|unital]] outer product. The members of ''V'' have a [[directram]] decomposition resulting in their having a "degree," with vectors having degree 1. If ''u'' and ''v'' have degree ''i'' and ''j'', respectively, the outer product of ''u'' and ''v'' is of degree ''i+j''. ''V'' also has a distinguished member '''0''' for each possible degree. Hence all members of ''V'' having the same degree form an [[Abelian group]] under addition. ** [[Tensor algebra]]: A graded algebra such that ''V'' includes all finite iterations of a binary operation over ''V'', called the [[tensor product]]. All multilinear algebras can be seen as special cases of tensor algebra. *** [[Exterior algebra]] (also ''Grassmann algebra''): a graded algebra whose [[anticommutative]] outer product, denoted by infix ∧, is called the [[exterior product]]. ''V'' has an [[orthonormal basis]]. ''v''<sub>1</sub> ∧ ''v''<sub>2</sub> ∧ ... ∧ ''v''<sub>k</sub> = 0 if and only if ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>k</sub> are [[linearly dependent]]. Multivectors also have an [[inner product]]. **** [[Clifford algebra]]: an exterior algebra with a symmetric [[bilinear form]] ''Q'': ''V''×''V''→''K''. The special case ''Q''=0 yields an exterior algebra. The exterior product is written 〈''u'',''v''〉. Usually, 〈''e''<sub>i</sub>,''e''<sub>i</sub>〉 = -1 (usually) or 1 (otherwise). **** [[Geometric algebra]]: an exterior algebra whose exterior (called ''geometric'') product is denoted by concatenation. The geometric product of parallel multivectors commutes, that of orthogonal vectors anticommutes. The product of a scalar with a multivector commutes. ''vv'' yields a scalar. *****[[Grassmann-Cayley algebra]]: a geometric algebra without an inner product. ===Structures with topologies or manifolds=== These algebraic structures are not varieties, because the underlying set either has a [[topology]] or is a [[manifold]], characteristics that are not algebraic in nature. This added structure must be compatible in some sense, however, with the algebraic structure. The case of when the added structure is [[partial order]] is discussed above, under varieties. [[Topology]]: * [[Topological group]]: a group whose ''S'' has a [[topology]]; **[[Discrete group]]: a topological group whose topology is [[discrete topology|discrete]]. Also a 0-dimensional [[Lie group]]. * [[Topological vector space]]: a [[normed vector space]] whose ''R'' has a [[topology]]. [[Manifold]]: * [[Lie group]]: a group whose ''S'' has a smooth [[manifold]] structure. ===Categories=== Let there be two [[class (mathematics)|classes]]: *''O'' whose elements are [[category theory|objects]], and *''M'' whose elements are [[morphism]]s defined over ''O''. Let ''x'' and ''y'' be any two elements of ''M''. Then there exist: *Two [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], ''c'', ''d'' : ''M''→''O''. ''d''(''x'') is the [[domain (mathematics)#3|domain]] of ''x'', and ''c''(''x'') is its [[codomain]]. *A binary [[partial function|partial operation]] over ''M'', called [[function composition|composition]] and denoted by [[concatenation]]. ''xy'' is defined [[iff]] ''c''(''x'')=''d''(''y''). If ''xy'' is defined, ''d''(''xy'') = ''d''(''x'') and ''c''(''xy'') = ''c''(''y''). [[category theory|Category]]: [[function composition|Composition]] associates (if defined), and ''x'' has [[identity element|left]] and [[identity element|right identity]] elements, the domain and codomain of ''x'', respectively, so that ''d''(''x'')''x'' = ''x'' = ''xc''(''x''). Letting φ stand for one of ''c'' or ''d'', and γ stand for the other, then φ(γ(''x'')) = γ(''x''). If ''O'' has but one element, the associated category is a [[monoid]]. *[[Groupoid]]: Two equivalent definitions. **''Category theory'': A [[small category]] in which every morphism is an [[isomorphism]]. Equivalently, a category such that every element ''x'' of ''M'', ''x''(''a'',''b''), has an inverse ''x''(''b'',''a''); see diagram in section 2.2. **''Algebraic definition'': A group whose product is a [[partial function]]. Group product associates in that if ''ab'' and ''bc'' are both defined, then ''ab.c''=''a.bc''. (''a'')''a'' and ''a''(''a'') are always defined. Also, ''ab''.(''b'') = ''a'', and (''a'').''ab'' = ''b''. ==Examples== Recurring underlying sets: '''N'''=[[natural numbers]]; '''Z'''=[[integers]]; '''Q'''=[[rational numbers]]; '''R'''=[[real number]]s; '''C'''=[[complex number]]s. ===Arithmetics=== *'''N''' is a pointed unary system, and the standard interpretation of [[Peano arithmetic]]. * A Dedekind algebra is a [[free algebra|free S-algebra]] on zero [[generating set|generators]] of type 〈1,0〉. Freeness implies that no two terms are equal. Very general results from the theory of free algebras, e.g., definition by recursion, and uniqueness up to isomorphism, are now applicable.<ref>[[Paul Cohn|Cohn, Paul]], 1965. ''Universal Algebra'', chpt. VII.1.</ref> *A [[Peano axioms|Dedekind-Peano structure]] is a [[free object]] with one [[generating set|generator]]. *The [[universe (mathematics)|universe]] of [[singleton]]s forms a [[Peano axioms|Dedekind-Peano structure]] if {''x''} interprets the [[successor function|successor]] of ''x'', and the [[null set]] interprets 0.<ref>Lewis (1991).</ref> ===Group-like structures=== *Nonzero '''N''' under [[addition]] is a [[magma (algebra)|magma]]. * '''Z''' under [[subtraction]] (&minus;) is a [[quasigroup]]. * Nonzero '''Q''' under [[division (mathematics)|division]] (÷) is a [[quasigroup]]. * '''Z''' under addition (+) is an [[abelian group]]. *
