This trick gives the appearance of a phone call with a famous celebrity, including real pre-recorded voices of the celebrity. There are multiple celebrities available within the application, including [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Barack Obama]], as well as the ability to add your own. ====iBeer==== [[File:Ibeer icon.png|right|75 px]] '''iBeer''' is a trick that gives the illusion that the device screen "fills" with many varieties of [[beer]] (including sound). If the device is tilted, the virtual beer swishes around to give the illusion of truly being filled with beer. The beer can be "drained" if the device is tilted enough, and a belch sounds when the beer has been completely drained. iBeer appeared in both the "Top Paid Apps (Overall)" and "Top Paid Entertainment" lists published by Apple in December 2008.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kumparak|first=Greg|authorlink=Greg Kumparak|title=Apple announces Top 10 iPhone App downloads of 2008|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|date=December 2, 2008|url=http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2008/12/02/apple-announces-top-10-iphone-app-downloads-of-2008/|accessdate=September 3, 2009}}</ref> ====iBug==== '''iBug''' is a trick that gives the appearance of a virtual insect appearing on the screen of the device. It responds to touch and can get fat. The bug laughs when the device is shaken. ====iMilk==== '''iMilk''' is a trick similar to iBeer, but appears as different varieties of [[milk]], such as chocolate milk, strawberry milk, and "martian milk." iMilk has a pay trick and a magic button to perform various tricks with money. ====iMunchies==== '''iMunchies''' is a trick that gives the illusion that the device is filling with many varieties of snacks such as [[candy]], [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]], and [[popcorn]]. A person could then pretend to pull snacks out of the device by reaching beneath it and retrieving a previously-hidden snack using [[sleight of hand]]. The snacks can also be poured out of the device. ====iSoda==== '''iSoda''' is a trick similar to iBeer and iMilk, but with various [[soft drink]]s, such as cola, energy drink, and fizzy water. ====Jarheads==== '''Jarhead Bob''', '''Jarhead Tim''', and '''Jarhead Ned''' are tricks that have dungeon lab samples in potent juice. The heads roll their eyes when the device is tilted and the juice turns into blood when shaken. The liquid drains when the device is tilted enough, similar to iBeer. ====Magic Wallet==== '''Magic Wallet''' is a trick similar to iMunchies, but with [[money|coins]] in many currencies instead of snacks. ===Premier apps=== These tricks are like App Store apps, but are only available at Hottrix's Premier App Shop. *'''iHypno''', a "card trick" application, mentioned in the [[Wall Street Journal]] as an example of a legal workaround to the Apple iTunes Store.<ref>{{cite news|last=Charny|first=Ben|title=Developers Start To Look For Work-Around To Apple App Store|publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=August 13, 2009|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090813-713707.html|accessdate=September 10, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> *'''MindBeam''' **'''MB: Euro''' *'''Snapshot''' ===Simulated apps=== These tricks play as a video on the iPhone's video player. *'''iBugClassic''' *'''iCharger''' *'''iFireplace''' *'''iGoldfish''' *'''iGoyfish''' *'''iRescueCall''' *'''iSnail''' *'''iVegas''' *'''iYuleLog''' *'''MMS-3D''' ==List of Palm OS applications== *'''AbraMath''' *'''AbraPick''' *'''e-spresso''' *'''NerdAlert''' ==See also== *[[Micromagic]] ==References== {{reflist}} == External links == *[http://www.hottrix.com/ Official Web Site] [[Category:IOS software]] [[Category:Magic (illusion)]] [[Category:Palm OS software]] [[Category:Software companies of the United States]]</text> </page> <page> <id>16997</id> <title>HouseCall</title> <text>{{For|the customer service practice|Housecall}} {{Merge|Trend Micro|date=September 2009}} '''HouseCall''' is a free web-based utility offered by [[Trend Micro]], which scans for and cleans computers of [[viruses]], [[Trojans]], [[spyware]], and other [[malware]].

It is claimed to be the first ever first-person shooter and is sometimes inaccurately claimed to be the first 3D game for [[MS-DOS]], although it was preceded at least by ''[[History of Microsoft Flight Simulator|Microsoft Flight Simulator]]'', ''[[Elite (computer game)|Elite]]'', ''[[Alpha Waves]]'', ''[[Starglider]]'', ''[[Starglider 2]]'', and ''[[3-Demon]]''. The game used the same combination of scaled [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s and drawn walls that would later show up in ''[[Catacomb 3D]]'' and ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', but the walls in ''Hovertank 3D'' were in solid color, without any textures. ==Story== ''Hovertank 3D'' is set during a [[Nuclear War]]. In ''Hovertank 3D'', the player controls Brick Sledge, a [[mercenary]] hired by an unknown organization (referred to by the game as the "UFA") to rescue people from cities under the threat of [[nuclear attack]] (largely political activists), both by the government and by large corporations. However, the cities are also full of [[mutated]] humans, strange creatures, armed guards, and enemy hovertanks. == Gameplay == The player must drive a hovertank through the levels and try and find the people Brick is supposed to rescue. There are also many enemies in the levels, who are hunting down the people as well as the player. The player can keep track of both people and enemies in the radar box at the bottom of the screen. There is also a timer that counts how long until the nuke is dropped. Once all the living people are collected a yellow teleporter appears somewhere in the level, and the player must find it to win. Then the player receives their fee, based on the amount of people safely rescued, and how
