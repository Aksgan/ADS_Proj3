([[myocardium]]).<ref>{{MeshName|Myocardial+Perfusion+Imaging}}</ref> It evaluates many heart conditions from [[coronary artery disease]] (CAD) to [[hypertropic cardiomyopathy]] and myocardial wall motion abnormalities. The function of the myocardium is also evaluated by calculating the left ventricular [[ejection fraction]] (LVEF) of the heart. This scan is done in conjunction with a [[cardiac stress test]]. Planar techniques, such as conventional [[scintigraphy]], are rarely used. Rather, [[Single photon emission computed tomography|SPECT]] is more common in the US. With multihead SPECT systems, imaging can often be completed in less than 10 minutes. With SPECT, inferior and posterior abnormalities and small areas of infarction can be identified, as well as the occluded blood vessels and the mass of infarcted and viable myocardium.<ref name=merck>[http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec07/ch070/ch070i.html Merck manuals > Radionuclide Imaging] Last full review/revision May 2009 by Michael J.

Content last modified May 2009</ref> ==Major indications for a myocardial perfusion test== * Diagnosis of CAD and various cardiac abnormalities. * Identifying location and degree of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with a history of CAD. * Prognostication (risk stratification) and evaluation of patients that are at risk of having a myocardial or coronary incident. (ex: myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, coronary aneurysm, wall motion abnormalities) * Post intervention revascularivation (coronary artery bypass graph, [[angioplasty]]) evaluation of heart. ==Risks vs. benefits== Critics have written that myocardial perfusion imaging has risks of cancer from high radiation doses that are not justified by randomized, controlled studies demonstrating benefit. In a study of patient exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation, myocardial perfusion imaging had the highest average effective dose (15.6 millisieverts) and the highest percentage (22.1%) of all effective doses to the entire patient population from all major radiological procedures, including computer tomographic studies. Older patients, 60 to 64 years old, had the highest doses, with 5.27% getting a high dose (>20 to 50 mSv/year) and 0.57% getting a very high dose (>50 mSv/year) from all sources.<ref name=Fazel>Exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation from medical imaging procedures, Reza Fazel et al. N Engl J Med, 27 Aug 2009, 361(9):849.</ref> Experimental and epidemiologic evidence has linked exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation with up to 2% of solid cancers and leukemia. Workers are monitored and limited to 100mSv every 5 years, but medical patients are not typically monitored. In one study of CT in abdominal and flank pain, "less than 50% of radiologists and only 9% of emergency department physicians reported even being aware that CT was associated with an increased risk of cancer."<ref name=Fazel/><ref>Diagnostic CT scans: assessment of patient, physician, and radiologist awareness of radiation dose and possible risks, Lee CI, et al. Radiology 2004;231:393-8.</ref> From 1993-2001, myocardial perfusion scans increased >6%/y with "no justification," according to a commentary by Lauer. Mycardial perfusion imaging scans are "powerful predictors of future clinical events," and in theory may identify patients for whom aggressive therapies should improve outcome. But this is "only a hypothesis, not a proof," wrote Lauer. There are no randomized, controlled trials to demonstrate any benefits, and there is a small but cumulative danger from radiation.<ref name=Lauer>Perspective: Elements of danger -- the case of medical imaging, Michael S.

Mythryl is self-hosting, that is to say the Mythryl compiler is written in Mythryl. Mythryl is derived from [[SML/NJ]], a compiler and programming environment for [[Standard ML]]. It differs in that SML/NJ is a platform-neutral research testbed with an idiosyncratic syntax derived from [[Robin Milner]]'s work with the logic framework [[LF (logical framework)|LF]], whereas Mythryl is a [[Linux]]-centric production-oriented software development platform with a [[C (programming language)|C]]-like syntax. ==Language== Mythryl syntax is easily learned by mainstream programmers. For example the script #!/usr/bin/mythryl for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i) { printf "%d\n" i; }; does just what a C++ or Java programmer would expect. Mythryl provides [[Perl]]-like scripting convenience in a typed, compiled language. For example the script #!/usr/bin/mythryl foreach (dir_tree::files ".") .{ if (#file =~ ./\\.[ch]$/) printf "%s\n" #file; fi; }; finds and prints all C files under the current directory. This example illustrates Mythryl's support for Perl-compatible [[regular expression]]s via the standard library <code>=~</code> operator, the compact Mythryl <code>.{ ... #arg ...}</code> syntax for [[anonymous function]]s, and also the standard library routines <code>dir_tree::files</code> and <code>foreach</code>. Unlike (say) Perl, Mythryl does not hardwire into the compiler functionality like <code>foreach</code> and <code>=~</code>.
