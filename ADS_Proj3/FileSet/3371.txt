Origin supports various 2D/3D graph types. Data analyses in Origin include [[statistics]], [[signal processing]], [[curve fitting]] and peak analysis. Origin's curve fitting is performed by the [[Nonlinear regression|nonlinear least squares]] fitter which is based on the [[Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm]] (LMA). Origin imports data files in various formats such as [[ASCII text]], [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]], [[National Instruments|NI TDM, DIADem]], [[NetCDF]], [[SPC file format|SPC]], etc. It also exports the graph to various image file formats such as [[JPEG]], [[GIF]], [[Encapsulated post script|EPS]], [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]], etc. There is also a built-in query tool for accessing database data via [[ActiveX Data Objects|ADO]]. == Interface == [[Image:Cshome price sparklines.jpg||thumb|right|400px|Origin Workbook with [[sparkline]]s above data columns, this allows a quick glance of the data without plotting them.]] Origin is primarily a [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] software with a [[spreadsheet]] front end. Unlike popular spreadsheets like [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]], Origin's worksheet is column oriented. Each column has associated attributes like name, units and other user definable labels. Instead of cell formulae, Origin uses column formulae for calculations. Origin also has a [[scripting language]] ([http://wiki.originlab.com/~originla/wiki/index.php?title=Category:LabTalk LabTalk]) for controlling the software, which can be extended using a built-in [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]]-based [[compiled language]] (Origin C). Origin can be also used as a [[Component Object Model|COM]] server for programs which may be written in [[Visual Basic .NET]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[LabVIEW]], etc. == OriginPro == Origin is available in two editions, the regular version(Origin 8) and the pricier OriginPro 8. The latter adds additional data analysis features like surface fitting, short-time Fourier Transform, and more advanced statistics.<ref>[http://www.scientificcomputing.com/originpro-8-151-not-just-for.aspx Review article in Scientific Computing (OriginPro 8)]</ref> == History == Origin was first created for use solely with microcalorimeters manufactured by [[MicroCal]] Inc. The software was used to graph the instruments data, and perform nonlinear curve fitting and parameter calculation. The software was first published for the public in 1992 by Microcal Software, which later was renamed to OriginLab Corporation,<ref>[http://www.speciation.net/Appl/Companies/company.html?id=497 EVISA Company Database]</ref> located in [[Northampton (Massachusetts)|Northampton]], [[Massachusetts]]. ==Support== Technical support is available to registered users via e-mail and telephone. A user forum [http://originlab.com/forum/default.asp http://originlab.com/forum] is also available, and posts are routinely answered by OriginLab staff and others in the user community. ==Release history== * 2010.9 Origin 8.5.0 * 2009.10 Origin 8.1 * 2009.8 Origin 8 SR6 * 2009.4 Origin 8 SR5 * 2008.10 Origin 8 SR4 * 2008.6 Origin 8 SR2 * 2007.12 Origin 8 SR1<ref>[http://www.dddmag.com/Product-Origin-9-analysis-and-graphing-software.aspx Drug Discovery & Development magazine: Vol. 11, No. 2, February, 2008, pp. 30-32]</ref> * 2007.10 Origin 8<ref>[http://www.techbriefs.com/content/view/2000/36/ NASA Tech Briefs Product of the Month]</ref> * 2006.1 Origin 7.5 SR6 * 2003.10 Origin 7.5 * 2002.2 Origin 7.0 * 2000.9 Origin 6.1 * 1999.6 Origin 6.0 * 1997.8 Origin 5.0 * 1995.2 Origin 4.1 * 1993.?
