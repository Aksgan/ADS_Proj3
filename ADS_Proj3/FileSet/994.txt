start with ''FORT'' (from ''Fortsetzung'', meaning "continuation") followed by the time of the first message given twice bracketed by the letter ''Y''. At this time numerals were represented by the letters on the top row of the Enigma keyboard. So, "continuation of message sent at 2330" was represented as ''FORTYWEEPYYWEEPY''. {|class="wikitable" | border=1 | style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto; width:30%" |+ Top row of the Enigma keyboard and the numerals they represented |- |align="center" |Q||align="center" |W||align="center" |E||align="center" |R||align="center" |T||align="center" |Z||align="center" |U||align="center" |I||align="center" |O |- |align="center" |1||align="center" |2||align="center" |3||align="center" |4||align="center" |5||align="center" |6||align="center" |7||align="center" |8||align="center" |9 |- | colspan="9" align="center" | (Zero was represented by P) |- |} ''Cribs'' were fundamental to the British approach to breaking Enigma, but guessing the [[plaintext]] for a message was a highly skilled business. So in 1940 [[Stuart Milner-Barry]] set up a special ''Crib Room'' in Hut 8.<ref>Mahon (1945) p. 24 </ref><ref name=Welchman84p120>[[Gordon Welchman|Welchman]] (1984) p. 120</ref> Foremost amongst the knowledge needed for identifying cribs was the text of previous decrypts. Bletchley Park maintained detailed indexes<ref> {{ Citation | title = Bletchley Park Archives: Government Code & Cypher School Card Indexes | url = http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/edu/archives/gccscoll.rhtm | accessdate = 8 July 2010 }} </ref> of message preambles, of every person, of every ship, of every unit, of every weapon, of every technical term and of repeated phrases such as forms of address and other German military jargon.<ref>Budiansky (2000) p. 301 </ref> For each message the [[traffic analysis]] recorded the radio frequency, the date and time of intercept, and the preamble—which contained the network-identifying discriminant, the time of origin of the message, the callsign of the originating and receiving stations, and the indicator setting. This allowed cross referencing of a new message with a previous one.<ref>[[Gordon Welchman|Welchman]] (1984) p. 56</ref> Thus, as [[Derek Taunt]], another Cambridge mathematician-cryptanalyst wrote, the truism that "nothing succeeds like success" is particularly apposite here.<ref>[[Derek Taunt|Taunt]] (1993) p. 108</ref> Stereotypical messages included ''Keine besonderen Ereignisse'' (literally, "no special occurrences"—perhaps better translated as "nothing to report"),<ref>[[Stuart Milner-Barry|Milner-Barry]] (1993) p. 93</ref> ''An die Gruppe'' ("to the group") <ref>[[Michael Smith (newspaper reporter)|Smith]] (2007) p. 38</ref> and a number that came from weather stations such as ''weub null seqs null null'' ("weather survey 0600"). This was actually rendered as ''WEUBYYNULLSEQSNULLNULL''. The word ''WEUB'' being short for ''wetteruebersicht'', ''YY'' was used as a separator and ''SEQS'' was common abbreviation of ''sechs'' ("six").<ref>[[Derek Taunt|Taunt]] (1993) pp. 104, 105</ref> Field Marshall [[Erwin Rommel|Erwin Rommel's]] Quartermaster started all of his messages to his commander with the same formal introduction.<ref>Lewin (2001) p. 118</ref> With a combination of probable plaintext fragment and the fact that no letter could be enciphered as itself, a corresponding ciphertext fragment could often be tested by trying every possible alignment of the crib against the ciphertext, a procedure known as ''crib-dragging''. This allowed the elimination of possible crib positions. Comparing the crib ''Keine besonderen Ereignisse'' with a section of ciphertext might produce the following, where the red cells represent ''crashes'', the co-occurrence of the same letter in the crib and the ciphertext: {|class="wikitable" | border=1 | style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto" |+ Exclusion of possible positions for the crib ''Keine besonderen Ereignisse'' |- align=center ! align=left | Ciphertext |O||H||J||Y||P||D||O||M||Q||N||J||C||O||S||G||A||W||H||L||E||I||H||Y||S||O||P||J||S||M||N||U |- align=center ! align=left | Position 1 | || ||K||E||I||N||E||B||E||S||O||N||D||E||R||E||N||E||R||style="background:red"|E||style="background:red"|I||G||N||I||S||S||E|| || || || |- align=center ! align=left | Position 2 | || || ||K||E||I||N||E||B||E||S||O||N||D||E||R||E||N||E||R||E||I||G||N||I||S||S||E|| || || |- align=center ! align=left | Position 3 | || || || ||K||E||I||N||E||B||E||S||style="background:red"|O||N||D||E||R||E||N||style="background:red"|E||R||E||I||G||N||I||S||S||E|| || |- ! | colspan="31" align="center" | Positions 1 and 3 for the crib are impossible because of matching ciphertext and crib letters.

Derek Taunt has written that the three cardinal personal qualities that were in demand for cryptanalysis were (1) a creative imagination, (2) a well-developed critical faculty, and (3) a habit of meticulousness.<ref>[[Derek Taunt|Taunt]] (1993) p. 111</ref> Skill at solving crossword puzzles was famously tested in recruiting some cryptanalysts. This was useful in working out plugboard settings when a possible solution was being examined. For example, if the crib was the word ''WETTER'' (German for "weather") and a possible decrypt before the plugboard settings had been discovered, was ''TEWWER'', it is easy to see that ''T'' with ''W'' are ''stecker partners''.<ref>[[Simon Singh|Singh]] (1999) p. 174</ref> These examples, although illustrative of the principles, greatly over-simplify the cryptanalysts' tasks. A fruitful source of cribs was re-encipherments of messages that had previously been decrypted either from a lower-level manual cipher or from another Enigma network.<ref>Mahon (1945) p. 44</ref> This was called a ''[[Kiss (cryptanalysis)|kiss]]'' and happened particularly with German naval messages being sent in the ''dockyard cipher'' and repeated ''verbatim'' in an Enigma cipher. One German agent in Britain, code named ''Treasure'', who had been ''[[Double Cross System|turned]]'' to work for the Allies, was very verbose in her messages back to Germany, which were then re-transmitted on the ''Abwehr'' Enigma network. She was kept going by [[MI5]] because of providing long cribs in this way, not because of her usefulness as an agent to feed incorrect information to the ''Abwehr''.<ref name="Michael Smith 2007 p. 129">[[Michael Smith (newspaper reporter)|Smith]] (2007) p. 129</ref> Occasionally, when there was a particularly urgent need to break the German naval code, such as when an [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoy]] was about to depart, mines would be laid by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in a defined position, whose grid reference in the German naval system did not contain any of the words (such as ''sechs'' or ''sieben'') for which abbreviations or alternatives were sometimes used.<ref>Mahon (1945) p. 41</ref> The warning message about the mines and then the "all clear" message, would be transmitted both using the ''dockyard cipher'' and the U-boat Enigma network. This process of ''planting'' a crib was called ''[[Gardening (cryptanalysis)|gardening]]''.<ref>Morris (1993) p. 235</ref> Although ''cillies'' were not actually cribs, the ''chit-chat'' [[Cleartext|in clear]] that Enigma operators indulged in amongst themselves, often gave a clue as to the cillies that
