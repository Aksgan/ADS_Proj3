Aertsen (1988), ''Nature and Creature: Thomas Aquinas's Way of Thought'', p. 152.

Marmura }}</ref>}} ====Aquinas==== Following Avicenna, and also Augustine and Aristotle, [[Thomas Aquinas]] stated in his ''Disputed Questions on Truth'': {{quote|A natural thing, being placed between two intellects, is called ''true'' insofar as it conforms to either. It is said to be true with respect to its conformity with the divine intellect insofar as it fulfills the end to which it was ordained by the divine intellect... With respect to its conformity with a human intellect, a thing is said to be true insofar as it is such as to cause a true estimate about itself.<ref>''Disputed Questions on Truth'', 1, 2, c, reply to Obj. 1. Trans. Mulligan, McGlynn, Schmidt, ''Truth'', vol. I, pp. 10-12.</ref>}} Thus, for Aquinas, the truth of the human intellect (logical truth) is based on the truth in things (ontological truth).<ref>"Veritas supra ens fundatur" (Truth is founded on being). ''Disputed Questions on Truth'', 10, 2, reply to Obj. 3.</ref> Following this, he wrote an elegant re-statement of Aristotle's view in his [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1016.htm Summa I.16.1]: {{quote|Veritas est adæquatio intellectus et rei. <br> (Truth is the conformity of the intellect to the things.)}} Aquinas also said that real things participate in the act of being of the [[God|Creator God]] who is Subsistent Being, Intelligence, and Truth. Thus, these beings possess the light of intelligibility and are knowable. These things (beings; [[reality]]) are the foundation of the truth that is found in the human mind, when it acquires knowledge of things, first through the [[sense]]s, then through the [[understanding]] and the [[judgement]] done by [[reason]]. For Aquinas, human [[intelligence]] ("intus", within and "legere", to read) has the capability to reach the [[essence]] and [[existence]] of things because it has a non-material, [[Spirituality|spiritual]] element, although some moral, educational, and other elements might interfere with its capability. ===Modern age=== ====Kant==== [[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|125px|right|[[Immanuel Kant]]]] [[Immanuel Kant]] discussed the correspondence theory of truth<ref name=StanfordCorr/> in the following manner, criticizing correspondence theory as [[Begging the question|circular reasoning]]. <blockquote>Truth is said to consist in the agreement of knowledge with the object. According to this mere verbal definition, then, my knowledge, in order to be true, must agree with the object. Now, I can only compare the object with my knowledge by this means, namely, by taking knowledge of it. My knowledge, then, is to be verified by itself, which is far from being sufficient for truth. For as the object is external to me, and the knowledge is in me, I can only judge whether my knowledge of the object agrees with my knowledge of the object. Such a circle in explanation was called by the ancients [[Diallelos]]. And the logicians were accused of this fallacy by the sceptics, who remarked that this account of truth was as if a man before a judicial tribunal should make a statement, and appeal in support of it to a witness whom no one knows, but who defends his own credibility by saying that the man who had called him as a witness is an honourable man.<ref name = "Kant-1800">Kant, Immanuel (1800), Introduction to Logic. Reprinted, Thomas Kingsmill Abbott (trans.), Dennis Sweet (intro.) (2005)</ref></blockquote> According to Kant, the definition of truth as correspondence is a "mere verbal definition", here making use of Aristotle's distinction between a nominal definition: a definition in name only, and a real definition: a definition that shows the [[Definition#Essence|true cause or essence]] of the term that is being defined. From Kant's account of the history, the definition of truth as correspondence was already in dispute from classical times, the "skeptics" criticizing the "logicians" for a form of circular reasoning, though the extent to which the "logicians" actually held such a theory is not evaluated.<ref name = "Kant-1800"/> ====Hegel==== [[Georg Hegel|Hegel]] tried to distance his philosophy from psychology by presenting truth as being an external self&ndash;moving object instead of being related to inner, subjective thoughts. Hegel's truth is analogous to the [[mechanics]] of a material body in motion under the influence of its own inner force. "Truth is its own self&ndash;movement within itself."<ref>"Die Wahrheit ist die Bewegung ihrer an ihr selbst." ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', Preface, ¶ 48</ref> Teleological truth moves itself in the three&ndash;step form of [[Dialectic|dialectical triplicity]] toward the final goal of perfect, final, absolute truth. For Hegel, the progression of philosophical truth is a resolution of past oppositions into increasingly more accurate approximations to absolute truth. [[Heinrich Moritz Chalybäus|Chalybäus]] used the terms "[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|thesis]]", "[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|antithesis]]", and "[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]]" to describe Hegel's dialectical triplicity. The "thesis" consists of an incomplete historical movement. To resolve the incompletion, an "antithesis" occurs which opposes the "thesis." In turn, the "synthesis" appears when the "thesis" and "antithesis" become [[Sublation|reconciled]] and a higher level of truth is obtained. This "synthesis" thereby becomes a "thesis," which will again necessitate an "antithesis," requiring a new "synthesis" until a final state is reached as the result of reason's historical movement. History is the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute Spirit]] moving toward a goal. This historical progression will finally conclude itself when the Absolute Spirit understands its
