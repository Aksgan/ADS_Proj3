Although Wikimapia Administrators have historically taken recommendations by senior users into account when promoting new users,<ref name="Forum_Goodusers">{{cite web|url=http://wikimapia.org/forum/?t=754&goto=7269|title=Wikimapia forum: Good users|accessdate=2009-07-18}}</ref> they have also occasionally acted unilaterally to demote UL2 users. == Clutter and filtering == In some areas of the world with out-of-date or very expensive mapping, such as [[India]], WikiMapia growth has been phenomenally rapid. This rapid growth brought problems of its own, however. Urban areas became covered with thousands of overlapping rectangles marking the positions of private residences, but there was no provision in the WikiMapia interface for distinguishing those residences from places of public interest. == Licensing == December 2010 Wikimapia announces<ref name="CC_announce">{{cite web|url=http://blog.wikimapia.org/node/33|title=Wikimapia Blog: Wikimapia content is now available under Creative Commons License|accessdate=2010-12-10}}</ref> that all the content is now available under [[Creative_Commons_licenses|Creative Commons licence 3.0(by-nc-sa)]] through the API. Because the WikiMapia's geo-located data is all built based on aerial imagery from Google Maps, the dataset (and any further derivations from it) may attract copyright as a "[[derived work]]". This will depend on jurisdiction, and generally is an unclear area of copyright law, but the principle allows aerial photography companies to license (at great expense) the right to derive geo-data from their imagery. Although Google have not been known to sue for copyright violation in the courts over use of aerial imagery, their terms of service do include provisions regarding their rights over derived data. The approach taken by Wikimapia is in contrast with a more clean-room "from scratch" re-mapping approach as followed by the [[OpenStreetMap]] project. == Business model == The site generates some income using [[Adsense|Google ads]]. == Interoperability == A [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] [[GPS tracking|receiver]] can be connected to WikiMapia using a plug-in program (beta, download for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] OS from WikiMapia site <ref>[http://wikimapia.org/gps.htm GPS to WikiMapia (at this time for Windows only)]</ref>).

Like [[Wikipedia]], it contains various articles on Philippine-related topics. Unlike Wikipedia, many of the articles cover topics that would otherwise be deemed [[unencyclopedic]] by the stricter Wikipedia. The service for example, promotes the concept of [[original research]] and eschews the larger encyclopedia's [[NPOV|neutral point-of-view]] principle. Conceived in late 2006 by Philippine publishing magnate [[Gaspar Vibal]], WikiPilipinas (as Wikipiniana) officially went live on June 12, 2007 with several thousand Philippine-related articles [[forked]] from the English Wikipedia. Its name was officially changed from Wikipiniana to WikiPilipinas a few weeks later on the 7th of July. The service was formally launched at the 28th Manila International Book Fair in late August of the same year. ==Overview== While it started as a [[WP:FORK|fork]] of [[Wikipedia]], WikiPilipinas does not fancy itself an "[[academic]] [[encyclopedia]]" as stated in its official policies and guidelines page. Despite this, the online resource does contain articles on encyclopedic topics such as history, culture, sports, and politics. In addition to those mentioned, WikiPilipinas styles itself as a mash-up of several entities; a "Who's Who" of prominent Filipinos, a directory of institutions and companies, an [[almanac]] of the Philippines and a multi-racial [[Web portal|community portal]] for the different ethnic groups in the Philippines. As an online resource using the [[wiki]] model, it bills itself as a [[Collaborative writing|collaborative effort]]-content provider. The most major goal that the wiki has stated is "to build the largest Philippine knowledge database". Like Wikipedia, the contents of WikiPilipinas are open to editing by anyone with access to the [[Internet]]. However, editors must register before they are allowed to edit.<ref name="WPnasAbout">{{cite web | title =WikiPilipinas: About | publisher =WikiPilipinas | date =2007-08-23 | url =http://en.wikipilipinas.org/index.php?title=Wikipiniana:About | accessdate = 2007-08-27 }}</ref>[[Image:WikiPilipinas icon.png|thumb|right|100px|The WikiPilipinas logo, featruing a green Muslim vinta which a logo of the colors of the Philippine Flag was superimposed.]] Wikipilipinas was particularly launched by the Vibal Foundation, a nonprofit organization which previously created Filipiniana.net, and WikiPilipinas.org (a reference guide on the Philippines).
