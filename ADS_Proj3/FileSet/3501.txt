set up for Paul Revere on +1 (218) 488-1307, for phone phreaks across the world to "say their goodbyes" to MF signalling and the N2 in Wawina. During the days prior to the cutover, many famous phone phreaks such as [[Mark Bernay]], [[Joybubbles]], [[Bob Bernay]], and [[John Draper|Captain Crunch]] could be heard leaving their comments on the message board. The official date for the cutover from N2 to [[T-carrier]] was Wednesday, June 14. As early as June 7, there was a noticeable static on what had previously been clear lines. By Monday, June 12, many numbers were unreachable, and the static had peaked. The recording on +1 (218) 488-1307 was generally inaccessible, and MFing through the switch was becoming increasingly difficult due to the increased static. On June 15, at around 1:40 am, Eastern Daylight Time, any new incoming calls were unreachable}. As of July 20, 2010, the message played at +1 (218) 488-1307 was simply the current time for Wawina, Minnesota.<ref>http://www.binrev.com/forums/index.php/topic/20956-wawina/ Wawina cut off message board</ref> ==2600 Hz== {{Mergeto|2600 hertz|date=November 2008}} In the original analog networks, short-distance telephone calls were completed by sending relatively high-power electrical signals through the wires to the [[end office]], which then switched the call. This technique could not be used for long-distance connections, because the signals would be filtered out due to [[capacitance]] in the wires. Long-distance switching remained a manual operation years after short-distance calls were automated, requiring operators at either end of the line to set up the connections. Bell automated this process by sending "in-band" signals. Since the one thing the long-distance trunks were definitely able to do was send voice-frequency signals, the Bell system used a selection of tones sent over the trunks to control the system. When calling long-distance, the local end-office switch would first route the call to a special switch (this is why it is necessary to dial "1" in North America or "0" in most of Europe for long-distance calls) which would then convert further dialing into tones and send them over an appropriately selected trunk line (selected with the area code). A similar machine at the far end of the trunk would decode the tones back into electrical signals, and the call would complete as normal. In addition to dialing instructions, the system also included a number of other tones that represented various commands or status. 2600 Hz, the key to early phreaking, was the [[frequency]] of the tone sent by the long-distance switch indicating that the user has gone [[on-hook]] (hung up the phone). This normally resulted in the remote switch also going on-hook, freeing the trunk for other uses. In order to make free lines easy to find, the 2600 Hz tone was continually played into free trunks. Engressia's whistling had triggered the remote switch to go on-hook, but critically, the ''local'' switch knew he was still off-hook because that was signaled electrically. The system was now in an inconsistent state, leaving him connected to an operational long-distance trunk line. With further experimentation, the phreaks learned the rest of the signals needed to dial on the remote switch. Normally long-distance calls are billed locally. Since the "trick" required a long distance call to be placed in order to connect to the remote switch, it would be billed like normal. However there are a class of calls that have either no billing, like calls to directory service, or reverse the billing, like [[Wide Area Telephone Service|WATS]] lines (1-800 numbers). By dialing one of these numbers the user was connected to a remote switch as normal, but no billing record was made locally. A number of people in the 1960s discovered a loophole that resulted from this combination of features that allowed free long distance calls to be made. First you would dial a toll-free number in the area code you wanted to connect to, then play the 2600 Hz tone into the line to return the remote switch to on-hook, and then use a [[blue box]] to dial the number you wanted to connect to. The local Bell office would have no record of the call. As knowledge of phreaking spread, a minor culture emerged from the increasing number of phone phreaks. Sympathetic (or easily [[Social engineering (computer security)|social-engineered]]) telephone company employees began to provide the various routing codes to use international satellites and trunk lines. At the time it was felt that there was nothing Bell could do to stop this. Their entire network was based on this system, so changing the system in order to stop the phreakers would require a massive infrastructure upgrade. In fact, Bell responded fairly quickly, but in a more targeted fashion. Looking on local records for inordinately long calls to directory service or other hints that phreakers were using a particular switch, filters could then be installed to block efforts at that end office. Many phreakers were forced to use pay telephones as the telephone company technicians regularly tracked long-distance toll free calls in an elaborate cat-and-mouse game. AT&T instead turned to the law for help, and a number of phreaks were caught by the government. Eventually, the phone companies in North America did, in fact, replace all their hardware. They didn't do it to stop the phreaks, but simply as a matter of course while moving to fully digital switching systems. Unlike the crossbar, where the switching signals and voice were carried on the same lines, the new systems used separate lines for signalling that the phreaks couldn't get to. This system is known as [[Common Channel Interoffice Signaling]]. Classic phreaking with the 2600 Hz tone continued to work in more remote locations into the 1980s, but was of little use in North America by the 1990s. ==Famous phone phreaks== * [[John Draper]] (''Captain Crunch'') * [[Mark Abene]] (''Phiber Optik'') * [[Denny Teresi]] * [[Joybubbles]] (Joe Engressia, ''The Whistler'') * [[Patrick Kroupa]] (''Lord Digital'') * [[Kevin Mitnick]] (''Condor'') * [[Kevin Poulsen]] (''Dark Dante'') * [[Steve Wozniak]] (''Berkeley Blue'') * [[Lucky225|Jered Morgan]] (''Lucky225'')<ref>http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.12/phreakers_pr.html</ref> * [[Direct Access Test
