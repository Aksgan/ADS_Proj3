However, CDs created by users do not attain [[first sale]] rights and cannot be legally leased, lent, sold or distributed to others by the creator. ** The CD audio still bears the artifacts of compression, so converting it back into a [[lossy]] format such as [[MP3]] may aggravate the sound artifacts of encoding (see [[transcoding]]). When re-ripping such a CD one could use a lossless audio codec such as [[AIFF]], [[Apple Lossless]], [[FLAC]] or [[WAV]] however such files take up significantly more space than the original .mp4 files. At this time, it appears that the restrictions mentioned above are hard-coded into QuickTime and the iTunes application, and not configurable in the protected files themselves. Fairplay prevents iTunes customers from using the purchased music directly on any portable digital music player other than the [[Apple iPod]], [[Motorola ROKR E1]], [[Motorola SLVR]], [[Motorola RAZR V3i]], the [[iPhone]] and the [[iPad]]. ==Legal issues== On January 3, 2005, an iTunes online music store customer, Thomas Slattery, filed a lawsuit against [[Apple Inc.]], alleging the company broke [[antitrust]] laws by using FairPlay with iTunes so that purchased music will work only with its own music player, the iPod, freezing out competitors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/3455431 |title=InternetNews Realtime IT News – Apple Hit by Lawsuit |publisher=Internetnews.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-13}}</ref> Though most of the complaints have been dropped, the case has since been combined with two other lawsuits and continues today under the temporary name "The Apple iPod iTunes Antitrust Litigation".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000110465907037745/a07-13266_110q.htm | title=Apple Inc. 10-Q| date=2007-05-10 | work=[[EDGAR]] | pages=38 | accessdate=2007-06-21}}</ref> On June 28, 2004, [[Virgin Megastores|VirginMega]] filed a complaint with the [[Conseil de la Concurrence|French Competition Council]] against Apple regarding its refusal to license Fairplay to VirginMega for use in their own online music commerce store. The Council (''Conseil'') rejected the complaint over accused anti-competitive behavior.<ref>[http://www.conseil-concurrence.fr/pdf/avis/04d54.pdf Décision n° 04-D-54 du 9 novembre 2004 relative à des pratiques mises en oeuvre par la société Apple Computer, Inc. dans les secteurs du téléchargement de musique sur Internet et des baladeurs numériques]</ref> The Conseil ruled against the notion that FairPlay was an "[[Essential facilities doctrine|essential facility]]" for three distinct reasons: 1) Playing purchased music on portable players was a small part of the market; 2) CD Burning provides an adequate work-around to get purchased music from other vendors onto an iPod; and 3) There is sufficient availability of portable players that support Microsoft's WMA DRM as a viable alternative and choice for consumers.<ref>[http://www.reckon.co.uk/open/iTunes iTunes, DRM and competition law]</ref> ==Circumvention== After the launch of the iTunes Store multiple people attempted to circumvent the encryption of FairPlay-protected files. ===QTFairUse=== [[Jon Johansen]] – also known for his [[DeCSS]] program – was the first to devise a way to circumvent the DRM. The [[open source]] application [[QTFairUse]] intercepted the decrypted output and wrote it to a raw AAC file. Many media players do not support such raw files and the files had to be processed with a tool like [[Advanced Audio Coding#FAAC and FAAD2|FAAD]] to create normal files. One of the few media players that is able to play raw AAC files is [[foobar2000]]. The second time around, Johansen [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineered]] the encryption technique used in FairPlay and created an algorithm to completely remove the encryption without re-encoding the encrypted AAC stream. This method was also used by [[VLC media player]] in order to play FairPlay-protected tracks until a newer version of iTunes and FairPlay broke it. Only a few days after the release of iTunes 7.0 the experimental version 2.3 of QTFairUse6, a derivative of the python open source [[QTFairUse]], was released which dumps each track to a raw AAC file which then can be converted to any format. Jon Johansen himself also released a tool to remove the encryption, called DeDRMS. Later he released FairKeys, which uses Apple’s own servers to retrieve the keys needed by DeDRMS. All these applications have two things in common. First of all, they use the user keys from either the Apple servers, the iTunes key repository, or the iPod key repository, which ensures they can decrypt only files that are legally bought; a user cannot use these applications to decrypt files that another user bought. Second, they keep user specific metadata inside the MP4 container intact, so it is possible to identify the user who originally bought the file after it is decrypted. In March 2005, it was revealed through a front end of the iTunes Store called [[PyMusique]] that the FairPlay DRM was added only as a song was being purchased from the store by the client software itself. In October 2006, [[Jon Johansen]] announced that instead of breaking FairPlay, he had reverse-engineered it so that other companies could play their DRM-protected music and movies on iPods and Apple's new [[Apple TV]]. His company, [[doubleTwist]], would license the technology to media companies who wished to have their media playable on the iPod or Apple TV, with the protection of FairPlay DRM, but without having to go through Apple.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gannes |first=Liz |title=DVD Jon Fairplays Apple |publisher=[[GigaOM]] |date=2006-10-02 |url=http://featured.gigaom.com/2006/10/02/dvd-jon-fairplays-apple/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071102203847rn_1/gigaom.com/2006/10/02/dvd-jon-fairplays-apple/ |archivedate=2007-11-02}}</ref> ===Playfair, Hymn, and JHymn=== A software package named [[PlayFair]] – created by an anonymous author – also appeared. It can remove the encryption from files using the FairPlay DRM mechanism. The author of Playfair used the source code written by Jon Johansen for VLC. Apple's legal department forced PlayFair to be first removed from [[SourceForge.net]], and then when the Indian open source web site [[Sarovar.org]] hosted the project they too were sent a [[cease and desist]] by Apple's lawyers. However, Playfair's successor [[Hymn (software)|Hymn]] (a [[backronym]] for "'''H'''ear '''Y'''our '''M'''usic a'''N'''ywhere") is alive and well and has become [[JHymn]], a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] variant of the program,
