included a version of BASICA (Microsoft's Advanced GW-BASIC) with support for the enhanced CGA graphics modes (a.k.a. Tandy Graphics or TGA) and three-voice sound hardware of the Tandy 1000. All original Tandy-provided internal floppy disk drives for the 1000 SX and TX were double-density drives. The Tandy 1000 SX and TX were the first models in the Tandy 1000 line to have a built-in DMA controller. The earlier 1000/1000A, 1000 HD, 1000 EX and 1000 HX models, like the IBM PCjr, did not have a DMA controller, but could be upgraded with one. The DMA controller chip was included on the PLUS-type memory expansion board for the EX and HX, and on regular ISA memory expansion cards sold by Tandy and other companies for the 1000, 1000A, and 1000HD. Adding the DMA chip improved the speed and IBM PC-compatibility of these earlier Tandy 1000 models. ===Tandy 1000 SL, SL/2, TL, TL/2, TL/3=== The Tandy SL and TL series of computers were updates of the SX and TX respectively. Aside from having a redesigned case, the SL and TL each offered improved video hardware capable of 640x200x16 graphics, on-board [[Hercules Graphics Card]] compatible monochrome video offering 720x350 resolution, and an improved sound circuit featuring an 8-bit mono DAC/ADC. The composite output was also dropped. The latter device, which became known as the "Tandy DAC," was broadly similar in function to sound devices which connected to the parallel port (such as the Disney Sound Source), but unlike those devices it supported DMA transfers and could sample at frequencies up to 48 kHz. While the Tandy DAC's features compared favorably to those offered by [[Creative Technology|Creative's]] 8-bit [[Sound Blaster]] audio cards, it never saw widespread adoption by software developers. The 640x200x16 graphics mode was rarely used either, as it was not supported by the BIOS. The TL line also allowed the onboard floppy controller, parallel port, and joystick ports to be disabled, which the earlier models did not. The Tandy 1000 SL and SL/2 feature an Intel 8086 processor running at 8 MHz. The 8086's 16-bit bus and slightly higher clock speed gives the SL models a small but definite performance advantage over the earlier 8088-based Tandy 1000s. The SL came with 384k of RAM preinstalled, whereas the SL/2 offered 512k. Both machines can be expanded to 640k, although only 576k could be used by the operating system. The Tandy 1000 TL and TL/2 use 8 MHz Intel 80286 processors, whereas the TL/3 uses a 10 MHz 80286. These computers had 640 kilobytes of memory preinstalled, with an option for an extra 128 kilobytes to be installed for use as video memory for the onboard ETGA (Enhanced TGA, the "Enhanced" referring to the added 640x200x16 color mode) video hardware. It is therefore impractical to expand the onboard memory beyond 640 KB if a VGA graphics card is installed. Notably, the TL/3 had a high-density floppy controller for the first time, although it only shipped with a double-density 3.5" drive. Since the TL series are XT-class machines, it is impossible to install or use extended memory (XMS), although expanded memory (EMS) can be used in conjunction with an 8-bit LIM EMS memory card for software that supports expanded memory. The SL and TL were also shipped with MS-DOS 3.3 and [[DeskMate]] 3 in ROM, and featured an [[EEPROM]] memory chip to store BIOS settings (which enabled similar functionality to today's [[CMOS NVRAMs]], so that startup options could be saved). (Earlier Tandy 1000 models, like IBM PC and PC/XT systems, used DIP switches for startup configuration settings.) The machines could also run 'normal' MS-DOS 3.x, 5, and 6 and Windows 2 and 3.0, albeit in real mode. In common with many PC clones of the era, MS-DOS 4 was problematic and generally avoided. ===Tandy 1000 RL, RL/HD, RLX, RSX=== The Tandy 1000 RL/RLX/RSX series were slim-line desktop home computers. The RL and RL/HD featured a 9.56 MHz 8086 processor, 512 KB of RAM (expandable to 768 KB to provide 128 KB for video), smaller keyboard and mouse ports (which were similar to the PS/2's ports but not directly compatible), a bidirectional parallel port instead of the edge-connector ports, and the SL's enhanced graphics and sound. The RL/HD also included a built-in [[Industry Standard Architecture#XT-IDE|XT IDE]] hard drive. The RLX was the 'mid-range' offering of the RL line. It had a 10 MHz 286, and unlike other 286-based Tandy 1000s, it supported up to 384k of extended memory. However, it was not a full AT-class machine, as it still had an 8-bit ISA bus and only 8 IRQs. While the 3-voice sound chip and DAC were still present, Tandy video was dropped. The RLX had VGA instead, but it only had 256k of video memory and was limited to 640x480x16 graphics. Also, the RLX featured a high-density, 1.44 MB 3.5" disk drive. The RLX offered 512KB of memory preinstalled, which could be expanded to 1 MB. (The hard disk version came with 1 MB preinstalled.) The RSX offered a 25 MHz 80386SX processor, two 16-bit ISA slots, AcuMos SVGA video, an AT compatible IDE interface and standard PS/2 keyboard and mouse ports. It was a full 386-class PC, and could use up to 8MB of memory. On the other hand, the RSX still had the 3-voice sound chip and Tandy DAC. ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://support.radioshack.com/productinfo/ProductResults.asp?Name=Tandy_Desktops&ID=001001001 Radio Shack Tandy Computer Support], the official support site for Tandy Computers ([http://support.radioshack.com/productinfo/ product search page]) *[http://www.oldskool.org/pc/tand-em/ The Tand-Em Project], a Tandy 1000 emulator project *[http://sourceforge.net/projects/dosbox/ DOSBox] MS-DOS, Tandy 1000, PCjr Emulator *[http://www.mess.org/ MESS] Multiple emulator with Tandy 1000HX support *[http://www.oldskool.org/guides/tvdog/ Tvdog's Archive], Major archive of Tandy 1000 programs and documentation *[http://www.brooksdeforest.com/tandy1000/ Tandy 1000 BASIC Programs], Games and applications *[http://www.oldskool.org/shrines/pcjr_tandy The OldSkool Shrine], Tandy 1000 History And Memories *[http://r.webring.com/hub?ring=tandy1000 Tandy 1000 Webring], More Sites On The Tandy 1000 [[Category:Home computers]] [[Category:IBM PC compatibles]] [[Category:RadioShack]] [[fr:Tandy 1000]] [[it:Tandy 1000]] [[pt:Tandy 1000]]</text> </page> <page> <id>36844</id> <title>Tangram</title> <text>{{Other uses}} {{Contains Chinese text}} [[Image:Tangram set 00.jpg|thumb|300px|Like most modern sets, this wooden tangram is stored
