Often the term '''vectorial mechanics''' is applied to the form based on Newton's work, to contrast it with analytical mechanics. This distinction makes sense because analytical mechanics uses two ''scalar'' properties of motion, the kinetic and potential energies, instead of vector forces, to analyze the motion.<ref name=Lanczos>{{cite book |title=The variational principles of mechanics |author=Cornelius Lanczos |page=Introduction, pp. xxi–xxix |edition=4rth Edition |publisher=Dover Publications Inc. |location= New York |isbn=0-486-65067-7 |year=1970 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZWoYYr8wk2IC&pg=PR4&dq=isbn=0486650677&sig=NL35zjprkiKvcdCyu5qa9AWQBLY#PPR21,M1 |nopp=true}}</ref> The subject has two parts: [[Lagrangian mechanics]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]. The Lagrangian formulation identifies the actual path followed by the motion as a selection of the path over which the [[time integral]] of [[kinetic energy]] is least, assuming the total energy to be fixed, and imposing no conditions on the time of transit. The Hamiltonian formulation is more general, allowing time-varying energy, identifying the path followed to be the one with least ''[[Principle of least action|action]]'' (the integral over the path of the difference between kinetic and potential energies), holding the departure and arrival times fixed.<ref name=Lanczos/><ref name=note>The term ''action'' has various meanings. This definition is only one, and corresponds specifically to an integral of the system [[Lagrangian]].</ref> These approaches underlie the [[path integral formulation]] of [[quantum mechanics]]. It began with [[d'Alembert's principle]]. By analogy with [[Fermat's principle]], which is the [[variational principle]] in [[geometric optics]], [[Maupertuis' principle]] was discovered in classical mechanics. Using generalized [[coordinate]]s, we obtain [[Lagrange's equations]]. Using the [[Legendre transformation]], we obtain [[generalized momentum]] and the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]]. [[Hamilton's canonical equations]] provides [[integral equation|integral]], while [[Lagrange's equation]] provides [[differential equations]]. Finally we may derive the [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation]]. The study of the solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equations leads naturally to the study of [[symplectic manifold]]s and [[symplectic topology]].<ref name=Arnold>{{cite book |title=Mathematical methods of classical mechanics |author=VI Arnolʹd |year=1989 |publisher=Springer |edition=2nd Edition |page= Chapter 8 |isbn=978-0-387-96890-2 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Pd8-s6rOt_cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn=9780387968902#PPT18,M1 |nopp=true}}</ref><ref name=Doran>{{cite book |title=Geometric algebra for physicists |author=C Doran & A Lasenby |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=§12.3, pp. 432–439 |isbn=978-0-521-71595-9 |year=2003 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9780521715959&qt=owc_search}}</ref> In this formulation, the solutions of the Hamilton–Jacobi equations are the [[integral curve]]s of [[Hamiltonian vector field]]s. ==References and notes== <references/> ==See also== *[[Action (physics)]] *[[Applied mechanics]] *[[Classical mechanics]] *[[Analytical dynamics|Dynamics]] *[[Hamilton–Jacobi equation]] *[[Hamilton's principle]] *[[Kinematics]] *[[Kinetics (physics)]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Analytical Mechanics}} [[Category:Theoretical physics]] [[Category:Dynamical systems]] {{classicalmechanics-stub}} [[bg:Теоретична механика]] [[cv:Теориллĕ механика]] [[cs:Teoretická mechanika]] [[de:Theoretische Mechanik]] [[es:Mecánica analítica]] [[fr:Mécanique analytique]] [[it:Meccanica razionale]] [[he:מכניקה אנליטית]] [[ja:解析力学]] [[ru:Теоретическая механика]] [[sq:Mekanika analitike]] [[scn:Miccanica razziunali]] [[sv:Analytisk mekanik]] [[tt:Теоретик механика]] [[uk:Теоретична механіка]] [[zh:分析力学]]</text> </page> <page> <id>1816</id> <title>Analytical stereoplotter</title> <text>[[Image:alpha2000.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Alpha 2000 analytical stereoplotter.]] With the introduction of computers, the '''analytical stereoplotter''' became a popular machine of choice [[photogrammetry]] in the late 1960’s to 1970’s. A [[stereoplotter]] is an instrument that uses stereo photographs to determine elevations for the purpose of creating contours on [[Topographic map|topographic maps]]. Computers brought the capability to execute more precise calculations that ensure additional accurate output instead of approximations. This innovation also allowed a shift to a digital format rather than paper. Analytical stereoplotters edged out their analog predecessors and became the primary method of acquiring [[elevation]] data from [[Stereoscopy|stereo photographs]]. == Projection system == Analytical stereoplotters use a math projection based on the [[Collinearity equation|co-linearity]] (two vectors pointing in the same direction) equation model. The mechanical element of the device is a very accurate computer-controlled instrument that can view two photographs at the same time. The measurement system can be made to create a very precise and accurate measurement for images because the photo stages only move via the x and y [[Coordinates_(geographic)|coordinates]] that are programmed into the system. In comparison, to the analytical stereoplotter, the Kelsh stereoplotter was built with a fixed focal distance and [[focal length]] of lens for projection. The ratio for scale was also fixed. On the other hand, the analytical stereoplotter has no substantial limitations on focal length or [[Map scale|scale]]. == Viewing System == The analytical stereoplotters viewing system has an optical train system, which usually includes the ability to change the focal length of a camera by adjusting the lens. Style, size and color of the measuring mark can be adjusted in viewing system as well. There is also an illumination adjustment to each eye. == Measuring and Tracing System == The analytical stereoplotter measuring system is made up of an input device for the operator to move the elevation point in three dimensions. The input device is programmed, and the digital measure of the elevation point deviation is sent to the computer. With this information, the program then is able to set and locate points for both the interior and exterior of the elevation and record measurements. The transfer of information is immediate and thus the person operating the machine is able to make any necessary adjustments to the coordinates. Elevations are measured in three steps, that include first measuring the interior orientation, then the relative orientation, and finally the absolute orientation. Interior orientation photographs are placed in relation to the center of the stereoplotter by aligning the fixed standard of reference points for measurement to corresponding points on the photograph. The focal length of the camera is also set. With relative orientation the angle of orientation of the camera relative to the place where the photos were the stereo-photo is taken programmed in the stereoplotter. This allows the effects of parallax (distortion of the final stereo-photo) to be reduced. In absolute orientation, the ground coordinates of a position are used to scale the model. You can use this to get the x, y, or z coordinates of any position on the stereo photographs. This information can be used for the construction of [[Contour_line|contour lines]] for topographic maps. == Examples of Analytical Stereoplotters == *Galileo Digicart *Intergraph Intermap *Kern (now Leica) DSR series *Wild
