In classical logic each formula can be brought into this form by replacing implications and equivalences by their definitions, using [[De Morgan's laws]] to push negation inside, and eliminating double negations. This process can be represented using the following [[rewrite rule]]s: :<math>\lnot (\forall x. G) \to \exists x. \lnot G</math> :<math>\lnot (\exists x.

Most of his early Animutations used music from the original Japanese version of ''[[Pokémon]]''. ==''Potter Puppet Pals''== {{main|Potter Puppet Pals}} Cicierega's '''''Potter Puppet Pals''''' is a comedy series which parodies ''[[Harry Potter]]''. It originated as a pair of Flash animations on [[Newgrounds]] in 2003, and later resurfaced in the form of a series of live action [[puppet show]]s released onto [[YouTube]] and [http://potterpuppetpals.com Potterpuppetpals.com], starting in 2006 and continuing to the present.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/user/NeilCicierega YouTube Channel Displaying Potter Puppet Pals episodes through 2010]</ref> The central characters of the Harry Potter series are portrayed simply by puppets.
