MacRecorder Sound System, by a company called [[Farallon Computing]] (which eventually became Netopia). One of the major drivers for SoundEdit was Apple's [[HyperCard]]. With MacRecorder Sound System, stack makers could finally create alternatives to HyperCard's two built-in sounds. SoundEdit was later bought by Macromind-Paracomp, which became [[Macromedia]] (now [[Adobe Systems]]). [[Macromedia]] rebranded the program as 'SoundEdit 16' and expanded its capabilities to support CD-quality audio and [[Quicktime]] soundtrack editing and an audio plug-in architecture. A plug-in was included to convert sounds into '.SWA' format, an early form of mp3 file. These streaming audio files could be delivered to viewers using by embedded [[Adobe Shockwave|Shockwave]] content in web pages ([[Adobe Shockwave|Shockwave]] created using [[Adobe Director|Director]]). [[Macromedia]] discontinued sales of SoundEdit as of 1 December 2004, continuing its official support through 1 June 2005 and still offering some downloads for this application to this date. This final version only runs on Powermacs running Mac OS Classic. It does not run under Mac OS-X. {{Audio editors}} {{Mac-software-stub}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Soundedit}} [[Category:Mac OS-only software]] [[Category:Audio editors]]</text> </page> <page> <id>35128</id> <title>Sound Blaster AWE32</title> <text>'''[[Sound Blaster]] AWE32''' is an [[industry standard architecture|ISA]] [[sound card]] from [[Creative Technology]]. It is an expansion board for [[IBM PC compatible|PCs]]. The Sound Blaster AWE32, introduced in [[1994#March|March 1994]], was a near full-length ISA sound card, measuring 14 inches (356 mm) in length. It needed to be this large due to the number of features included. ==Sound Blaster AWE32 == ===MIDI capability=== [[Image:Creative_Sound_Blaster_AWE32_PNP_CT3990.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Sound Blaster AWE32 (CT3990)]] The Sound Blaster AWE32 included two distinct audio sections; one being the Creative digital audio section with their audio codec and optional CSP/ASP chip socket, and the second being the [[E-mu]] MIDI synthesizer section. The synthesizer section consisted of the [[EMU8000]] synthesizer and effects processor chip, 1 [[MiB]] EMU8011 sample ROM, and a variable amount of RAM (none on the SB32, 512 [[KiB]] on the AWE32; RAM was expandable to 28 [[MiB]] on both cards). These chips comprised a powerful and flexible [[sample-based synthesis]] system, based on E-mu's high-end sampler systems such as the [[E-mu Emulator III]] and [[E-mu Proteus]]. The effects processor generated various effects (i.e. [[Reverberation|reverb]] and [[Chorus effect|chorus]]) and [[Room acoustics|environments]] on MIDI output, similar to the later ''[[Environmental audio extensions|EAX]]'' standard on Live! and newer cards. It can also add effects to the output from the Yamaha [[OPL-3]]'s FM synthesis. The AWE32 was the first sampler to support E-Mu's [[SoundFont]] standard, which allowed users to build custom sound sets using their own samples, the samples included in ROM, or both. The card included software for building custom SoundFonts. All of Creative's subsequent cards, other than the ''Sound Blaster PCI64/128'' series, support SoundFonts. On the initial release, Creative promoted the EMU8000 as a [[Digital waveguide synthesis|waveguide]] [[physical modelling synthesis]] engine, due to its ability to work with [[delay line]]s. The option was used mostly as an effect engine for chorus and [[flanging]] effects. Actual physical modeling instruments were not popular on the AWE, although some support exists in the [[SoundFont]] format. The AWE32 didn't use its [[MPU-401]] port to access the EMU8000&mdash;Creative decided to expose the EMU8000's registers directly, through three sets of non-standard ports, and interpret MIDI commands in software on the host CPU. As with the [[Gravis Ultrasound]], software designers had to write special AWE32 support into their programs. To support older software, the AWE32 featured [[OPL-3]] FM synthesis, and came with the AWEUTIL program which attempted to provide GM/[[MT-32]]/[[Roland GS|GS]] redirection to the native AWE hardware; however, AWEUTIL wasn't compatible with all programs or motherboards due to its use of the [[non-maskable interrupt]] (a featured that was omitted or disabled on many [[IBM PC compatible|clone]] boards), and it used a lot of precious DOS [[conventional memory]]. Also, if a game used DOS 32-bit [[protected mode]] through a non-[[DPMI]] compliant [[DOS extender]], then the MPU-401 emulation would not function and the EMU8000 would not be used unless directly supported by the software. This also affected the [[Creative Wave Blaster]] [[daughterboard]] header. AWE32's usage in Windows was simplified by the fact that [[Windows 3.1x]] had drivers which made the OPL3 and the EMU8000 appear like any another MIDI peripheral, on their own MIDI interfaces. The Creative digital audio section was basically an entire [[Sound Blaster 16]], and as such, was compatible with Creative's earlier sound cards, including Sound Blaster Pro, Sound Blaster 2.0, and the original Sound Blaster (minus the C/MS audio chips.) Its specifications included 16-bit 44.1 kHz [[analog to digital converter|AD]]/[[digital to analog converter|DA]] conversion with real-time on-board compression / decompression and the Yamaha [[OPL3]] FM synthesizer chip. However, compatibility was not always perfect and there were situations where various bugs could arise in games. Many of the Sound Blaster AWE32 cards had codecs which supported bass, treble, and gain adjustments through Creative's included mixer software. There were many variants and revisions of the AWE32, however, and not all of them use the same digital audio chipset and features do vary. For example, the Sound Blaster AWE32 boards that utilize the VIBRA chip do not have bass and treble adjustments, but usually noticeably better signal-to-noise ratio.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} ===Sound Blaster AWE32 Value=== The '''Sound Blaster AWE32 Value''' was another value-oriented offering. It lacked SIMM slots but featured 512kB onboard RAM and an ASP chip socket. ===CD-ROM Interfaces=== Also on ''AWE32'' was a [[Panasonic]]/[[Sony]]/[[Mitsumi]] [[CD-ROM]] interface (to support proprietary non-[[ATAPI]] CD-ROM drives), the Wave Blaster header and two 30-pin [[SIMM]] slots to increase sample memory. Later Sound Blaster AWE32 revisions replaced the proprietary CD-ROM interfaces with the ATAPI interface. The Sound Blaster AWE32 supported up to 28 MB of additional SIMM memory. A maximum of 32 MB could be added to the Sound Blaster AWE3 but the synthesizer could not address all of it (4MB of the EMU8000's address space was reserved for sample ROM). ===Sound Blaster AWE32 Model Numbers=== The following model numbers were assigned to the Sound Blaster AWE32: * CT27**: CT2760 * CT36**: CT3601, CT3602, CT3603, CT3607, CT3631, CT3630, CT3631, CT3632, CT3636, CT3360, CT3660, CT3661, CT3662, CT3665, CT3666, CT3670, CT3680
