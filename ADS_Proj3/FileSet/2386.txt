the discovery of the planet [[Neptune]]: when the motion of [[Uranus]] was found not to match the predictions of Newton's laws, the theory "There are seven planets in the solar system" was rejected, and not Newton's laws themselves. Popper discussed this critique of [[Falsifiability#Naïve|naïve falsificationism]] in Chapters 3 & 4 of ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]''. For Popper, theories are accepted or rejected via a sort of selection process. Theories that say more about the way things appear are to be preferred over those that do not; the more generally applicable a theory is, the greater its value. Thus Newton’s laws, with their wide general application, are to be preferred over the much more specific “the solar system has seven planets”.{{Dubious|date=February 2010|reason=I just rechecked the mentioned chapters 3-4 of 'Logic of Scientific Discovery', and they don't appear to say any of this, or its equivalent -- quotations, please, if that is disagreed -- see talk.}} [[Thomas Kuhn]]’s influential book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' argued that scientists work in a series of [[paradigm]]s, and that falsificationist methodologies would make science impossible. {{quote|"No theory ever solves all the puzzles with which it is confronted at a given time; nor are the solutions already achieved often perfect. On the contrary, it is just the incompleteness and imperfection of the existing data-theory fit that, at any given time, define many of the puzzles that characterize normal science. If any and every failure to fit were ground for theory rejection, all theories ought to be rejected at all times. On the other hand, if only severe failure to fit justifies theory rejection, then the Popperians will require some criterion of 'improbability' or of 'degree of falsification.' In developing one they will almost certainly encounter the same network of difficulties that has haunted the advocates of the various probabilistic verification theories [that the evaluative theory cannot itself be legitimated without appeal to another evaluative theory, leading to regress]"---''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions''. pp. 145-6.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Kuhn, Thomas | authorlink= | coauthors= | title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions | year=1970 | publisher=University of Chicago Press | location=Chicago | isbn= }} </ref>|}} Popper's student [[Imre Lakatos]] attempted to reconcile Kuhn’s work with [[falsificationism]] by arguing that science progresses by the falsification of ''research programs'' rather than the more specific [[universal quantification|universal statements]] of naïve falsificationism. Another of Popper’s students [[Paul Feyerabend]] ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology, and argued that the only universal method characterizing scientific progress was ''anything goes''. Popper claimed to have recognized already in the 1934 version of his ''Logic of Discovery'' a fact later stressed by Kuhn, "that scientists necessarily develop their ideas within a definite theoretical framework", and to that extent to have anticipated Kuhn's central point about 'normal science'.<ref>'K R Popper (1970)', "Normal Science and its Dangers", pages 51-58 in [[#refcgk1970|I Lakatos & A Musgrave (eds.) (1970)]], at [http://books.google.com/books?id=Vutfm5n6LKYC&pg=PA51 page 51].</ref> (But Popper criticised what he saw as Kuhn's relativism.<ref>'K R Popper (1970)', in I Lakatos & A Musgrave (eds.) (1970), at [http://books.google.com/books?id=Vutfm5n6LKYC&pg=PA56 page 56].</ref>) Also, in his collection ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge'' (Harper & Row, 1963), Popper writes, "Science must begin with myths, and with the criticism of myths; neither with the collection of observations, nor with the invention of experiments, but with the critical discussion of myths, and of magical techniques and practices. The scientific tradition is distinguished from the pre-scientific tradition in having two layers. Like the latter, it passes on its theories; but it also passes on a critical attitude towards them. The theories are passed on, not as dogmas, but rather with the challenge to discuss them and improve upon them." Another objection is that it is not always possible to demonstrate falsehood definitively, especially if one is using [[statistical significance|statistical]] criteria to evaluate a [[null hypothesis]]. More generally it is not always clear, if evidence contradicts a hypothesis, that this is a sign of flaws in the hypothesis rather than of flaws in the evidence. However, this is a misunderstanding of what Popper's philosophy of science sets out to do. Rather than offering a set of instructions that merely need to be followed diligently to achieve science, Popper makes it clear in ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' that his belief is that the resolution of conflicts between hypotheses and observations can only be a matter of the collective judgment of scientists, in each individual case.<ref name="LdF">Popper, Karl, (1934) ''Logik der Forschung'', Springer. Vienna. Amplified English edition, Popper (1959), ISBN 0-415-27844-9</ref> Popper's falsificationism can be questioned logically: it is not clear how Popper would deal with a statement like "for every metal, there is a temperature at which it will melt." The hypothesis cannot be falsified by any possible observation, for there will always be a higher temperature than tested at which the metal may in fact melt, yet it seems to be a valid scientific hypothesis. These examples were pointed out by [[Carl Gustav Hempel]]. Hempel came to acknowledge that Logical Positivism's verificationism was untenable, but argued that falsificationism was equally untenable on logical grounds alone. The simplest response to this is that, because Popper describes how theories attain, maintain and lose scientific status, individual consequences of currently accepted scientific theories are scientific in the sense of being part of tentative scientific knowledge, and both of Hempel's examples fall under this category. For instance, [[atomic theory]] implies that all metals melt at some temperature. An early adversary of so-called critical rationalism, [[Karl-Otto Apel]] attempted a comprehensive refutation of Popper's philosophy. In ''Transformation der Philosophie'' (1973), Apel charged Popper with being guilty of, amongst other things, a pragmatic contradiction.<ref>See: "Apel, Karl-Otto," ''La philosophie de A a Z'', by Elizabeth Clement, Chantal Demonque, Laurence Hansen-Love, and Pierre Kahn, Paris, 1994, Hatier, 19-20.
