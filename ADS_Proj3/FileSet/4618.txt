Frustrated by the unstable software (Windows 3.0/3.1 with NDW), users and developers were frequently wiping out their hard disks, reinstalling Windows and their applications. Bicer, who was working on the installation program for Norton Desktop for Windows, came up with the uninstall concept and developed the first uninstaller. Ken Spreitzer wrote the first widely used PC program called "UnInstaller", first licensed to MicroHelp and then by February 1998 sold by CyberMedia.<ref name="NYT">{{cite news | first= Steve| last= Lohr | url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE0D61E3CF934A15750C0A963958260 | title= INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY; Minds Behind the Product | publisher= [[New York Times]]| date=March 27, 1995}}</ref><ref name="tiger">{{cite news | first= | last= | url= http://searchmarketingexpo.com/bio.php?id=727 | title= SMX Bio | publisher= |date=2008}}</ref><ref name="BW">{{cite news | first= Allison | last= Engler| url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1997_March_12/ai_19207443 | title= Maximized Software introduces ultra fast Web site log file analyzer | publisher= [[Business Wire]]| date=March 12, 1997}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= Piracy Protection Available|author= |newspaper=[[The Daily Courier]] |date=1996-08-07 |url= http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sRoOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=h30DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4898,894541&dq=ken-spreitzer&hl=en}}</ref> After writing the program, Spreitzer went on to create Maximized Software.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/now-tidy-up-your-computer-1583941.html |title=Now tidy up your computer |publisher=The Independent (UK) |work=Life & Style |date=27 November 1995 |accessdate=27 January 2010 |last=Gallivan |first=Joseph }} </ref> ==See also== * [[Installation (computer programs)]] * [[AppZapper]] * [[Revo Uninstaller]] * [[Windows Installer]] ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Utility software]] [[Category:Package management systems]] [[de:Deinstallationsprogramm]] [[ko:제거 프로그램]] [[ja:アンインストール]] [[pl:Dezinstalacja]] [[pt:Desinstalador]] [[ro:Uninstaller]] [[simple:Ken Spreitzer]]</text> </page> <page> <id>38824</id> <title>Union (set theory)</title> <text>[[File:Venn0111.svg|thumb|150px|Union of two sets:<br><math>~A \cup B</math>]] [[File:Venn 0111 1111.svg|thumb|150px|Union of three sets:<br><math>~A \cup B \cup C</math>]] In [[set theory]], the '''union''' (denoted as ∪) of a collection of sets is the set of all distinct [[element (set theory)|element]]s in the collection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Union.html|title=Union|author=Weisstein, Eric W|publisher=Wolfram's Mathworld|accessdate=2009-07-14}}</ref> The union of a collection of sets <math>S_1, S_2, S_3, \dots , S_n\,\!</math> gives a set <math>S_1 \cup S_2 \cup S_3 \cup \dots \cup S_n</math>. == Definition == The union of two sets A and B is the collection of points which are in A or in B (or in both): :<math>A \cup B = \{ x: x \in A \,\,\,\textrm{ or }\,\,\, x \in B\}</math> A simple example: : <math>A = \{1,2,3,4\}</math> : <math>B = \{5,6,7,8\}</math> : <math>A \cup B = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\}</math> Other more complex operations can be done including the union, if the set is for example defined by a property rather than a finite or assumed infinite enumeration of elements. As an example, a set could be defined by a property or algebraic equation, which is referred to as a solution set when resolved. An example of a property used in a union would be the following: : A = {x is an even number, x > 1} : B = {x is an odd number, x > 1} : <math>A \cup B = \{2,3,4,5,6,...\}</math> If we are then to refer to a single element by the variable "''x''", then we can say that ''x'' is a member of the union if it is an element present in set A or in set B, or both. Sets cannot have duplicate elements, so the union of the sets {1, 2, 3} and {2, 3, 4} is {1, 2, 3, 4}. Multiple occurrences of identical elements have no effect on the [[cardinality]] of a set or its contents. The number 9 is ''not'' contained in the union of the set of [[prime number]]s {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, …} and the set of [[even number]]s {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, …}, because 9 is neither prime nor even. === Algebraic properties === Binary union is an [[associative]] operation; that is, :''A'' ∪ (''B'' ∪ ''C'') = (''A'' ∪ ''B'') ∪ ''C''. The operations can be performed in any order, and the parentheses may be omitted without ambiguity (i.e. either of the above can be expressed equivalently as ''A'' ∪ ''B'' ∪ ''C''). Similarly, union is [[commutative]], so the sets can be written in any order. The [[empty set]] is an [[identity element]] for the operation of union. That is, ''A'' ∪ {} = ''A'', for any set ''A''. In terms of the definitions, these facts follow from analogous facts about [[logical disjunction]]. Together with [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] and [[complement (set theory)|complement]], union makes any [[power set]] into a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]. For example, union and intersection [[distributive law|distribute]] over each other, and all three operations are combined in [[De Morgan's laws]]. Replacing union with [[symmetric difference]] gives a [[Boolean ring]] instead of a Boolean algebra == Forms == === Finite unions === More generally, one can take the union of several sets at once. The union of ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'', for example, contains all elements of ''A'', all elements of ''B'', and all elements of ''C'', and nothing else. Formally, ''x'' is an element of ''A'' ∪ ''B'' ∪ ''C'' if and only if ''x'' is in ''A'', ''B'', or ''C''. Union is an [[associative operation]], it doesn't matter in what order unions are taken. In mathematics a '''finite union''' means any union carried out on a finite number of sets: it doesn't imply that the union set is a [[finite set]]. === Arbitrary unions === The most general notion is the union of an arbitrary collection of sets. If '''M''' is a set whose elements are themselves sets, then ''x'' is an element of the union of '''M''' [[if and only if]] [[existential quantification|for at least one]] element ''A'' of '''M''', ''x'' is an element of ''A''. In symbols: : <math>x \in \bigcup\mathbf{M} \iff \exists A \in \mathbf{M},\ x \in A.</math> That this union of '''M''' is a set no matter how large
