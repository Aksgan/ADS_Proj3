Though not the default, Microsoft Sam is available in [[Windows Vista Home Premium]]. It is used by [[Microsoft Narrator|Narrator]], the [[screen reader]] program built into the operating system. Microsoft Mike and Microsoft Mary are optional male and female voices respectively, available for download from the Microsoft website. Lernout and Hauspie Michael and Michelle are also optional male and female voices licensed by Microsoft from [[Lernout & Hauspie]], and available through [[Microsoft Office XP]] and [[Microsoft Office 2003]] or [[Microsoft Reader]]. There are both SAPI 4 and SAPI 5 versions of these text to speech voices. SAPI 5 voices are only available on Windows 2000 and later Windows NT-based operating systems. While SAPI 5 versions of Microsoft Mike and Microsoft Mary are downloadable only as a [[Merge Module]] <ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=5e86ec97-40a7-453f-b0ee-6583171b4530 Speech SDK 5.1]</ref>, the installable versions may be installed on end users' systems by third party speech applications. SAPI 4 redistributable versions are downloadable for [[Windows 9x]], although no longer from the Microsoft website. Beginning with [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]], ''Microsoft Anna'' is the default English voice. Under [[Windows Vista Home Premium]], Microsoft Sam can be chosen from the drop-down list. Microsoft Anna is a SAPI 5-only voice and is designed to sound more natural than Microsoft Sam.<ref>[http://blogs.msdn.com/robch/archive/2006/08/29/730032.aspx Microsoft Anna - The new TTS voice in Vista]</ref> [[Microsoft Streets & Trips]] 2006 and later install the Microsoft Anna voice on [[Windows XP]] systems for the voice-prompt direction feature.

Scandinavia Online AB</title> <text>{{orphan|date=April 2008}} '''Microsystems Software, Inc. v. Scandinavia Online AB''' is a [[2000]] US District Court civil case, numbered 00-cv10488-EFH, in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. It received considerable attention in the online community because it involved [[reverse engineering]] and [[cryptanalysis]] of [[content-control software]], allegedly in violation of [[copyright]] law and a [[clickwrap]] license agreement. In early [[2000]], [[Eddy L. O. Jansson]] and [[Matthew Skala]] reverse engineered the content-control package [[Cyber Patrol]] and published a report titled ''The Breaking of Cyber Patrol 4'' detailing what they found, including a [[cryptanalysis]] of the [[CRC-32]]-based [[hash function]] that concealed the configuration password and Web site and [[Usenet]] newsgroup blacklists. They commented critically on the content of the blacklist, and highlighted apparent errors in it, innocuous sites and newsgroups blocked as objectionable for no visible reason. Along with the essay, they included software in C and Delphi demonstrating the attacks and allowing users to disable the package, change its configuration, or browse the blacklists in decrypted form. The break was widely reported on March 11, 2000. [http://slashdot.org/yro/00/03/11/117240.shtml] On March 15, [[Microsystems Software]], the publisher of [[Cyber Patrol]], and [[Mattel]], its parent company, filed suit against Jansson, Skala, and the ISPs that hosted their personal Web sites, [[Scandinavia Online]] and [[Islandnet]]. They filed in US court, though Jansson and Scandinavia Online were located in [[Sweden]] and Skala and Islandnet were located in [[Canada]]. They alleged that the reverse engineering was copyright infringement by Jansson and Skala; that distributing the essay and software (or, in the case of Islandnet, the link on Skala's site pointing to the essay and software on Jansson's site) was copyright infringement by the ISPs; and that Jansson and Skala's actions constituted breach of the [[clickwrap]] license agreement on [[Cyber Patrol]], interference with advantageous business relations, [[Conversion (law)|conversion]], and theft of [[trade secret]]s. [http://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/lawpoli/youthrights/cpbfaq.php#whatclaims] Once the lawsuit became known, it attracted considerable attention from the online community, far overshadowing the discussion of the reverse engineering itself. [http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,34998,00.html] In response to demands from the plaintiffs, Scandinavia Online deleted Jansson's Web site and Islandnet asked Skala to remove his link to Jansson's (now non-existent anyway) Web site. The document and software had already been mirrored on many sites worldwide, however. The plaintiffs asked for, and received, a temporary restraining order against distribution of what they termed the "bypass code", and were authorized to serve it by email on mirror sites, along with a subpoena demanding the identities of every Web user who accessed the information. [http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,35196,00.html] Some commentators dubbed these email-distributed subpoenas "[[spampoenas]]"; use of email for official service of court documents was, and remains, highly unusual if not absolutely unheard of. [http://tbtf.com/jargon-scout.html#spampoena] On March 27, Skala announced that he had settled the cases against him (including one filed in a Canadian court as well as the US case) out of court and that Jansson was close to doing the same, with an agreement to stop distributing the essay and software and assign its copyrights to the plaintiffs. [http://cryptome.org/skala.htm] Other parties had become involved, however, including three mirror site operators associated with [[Peacefire]] and backed by the [[ACLU]]. The suit continued with the main issue being whether those mirror sites would also be forced to stop distributing the material. When their motions on that topic were dismissed, the mirror sites took that as an indication that they could continue to distribute it safely. Meanwhile, some controversy erupted when news sources suggested that the exploit software had been released under the [[GPL]], making any restriction on its distribution problematic. [http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,35226,00.html] Statements from Jansson and Skala denying any intention to place it under the GPL, the lack of any copyright notice in Skala's code, and a vague nonstandard GPL notice in Jansson's code, made it fall apart as a possible GPL test case. In [[2001]], Jansson stated on his Web site that he had in fact
