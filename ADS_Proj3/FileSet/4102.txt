SPE's technical library contains more than 42,000 technical papers — products of SPE conferences and periodicals, made available to the entire industry. SPE has offices in Dallas, Houston, Calgary, London, Dubai, Moscow and Kuala Lumpur. ==History== The history of the SPE began well before its actual establishment. During the decade after the 1901 discovery of the Spindletop field, the American Institute of Mining Engineers ([[American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers|AIME]]) saw a growing need for a forum in the booming new field of petroleum engineering. As a result, AIME formed a standing committee on oil and gas in 1913. In 1922, the committee was expanded to become one of AIME’s 10 professional divisions. The Petroleum Division of AIME continued to grow throughout the next three decades. By 1950, the Petroleum Division had become one of three separate branches of AIME, and in 1957 the Petroleum Branch of AIME was expanded once again to form a professional society. The first SPE Board of Directors meeting was held 6 October 1957, making 2007 the 50th anniversary year for SPE as a professional society. ===Chronology=== *1950s: During the 1950s, the petroleum membership of AIME grew significantly, leading to restructuring decisions that would shape the future Society of Petroleum Engineers. *1957: The Petroleum Branch of AIME becomes a full-fledged professional society - the Society of Petroleum Engineers of AIME. On October 6, 1957, the first Board of Directors meeting was held in Dallas, Texas, with President John H. Hammond presiding. *1958: The SPE Reprint Series begins with the publication of Well Logging. *1961: The first issue of the Society of Petroleum Engineers Journal is published. *1979: The first Middle East Oil and Gas Show and Conference is held. *1985: SPE is incorporated separately from AIME. == OnePetro == Launched in March 2007, OnePetro.org is a multi-society library that allows users to search for and access a broad range of technical literature related to the oil and gas exploration and production industry. OnePetro is a multi-association effort that reflects participation of many organizations. The Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) operates OnePetro on behalf of the participating organizations. SPE provides the computers and technology on which OnePetro operates and provides customer service support. OnePetro currently contains more than 85,000 documents, with more being added frequently. The number of documents is expected to grow as additional organizations choose to make their materials available through OnePetro. OnePetro is the first online offering of documents from some organizations, making these materials widely available for the first time. The following organizations currently have their technical documents available through OnePetro: *American Petroleum Institute (API) *American Rock Mechanics Association (ARMA) *American Society of Safety Engineers (ASSE) *Offshore Technology Conference (OTC) *NACE International (corrosion engineers) *Petroleum Society of Canada (PETSOC) *Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) *Society of Petrophysicists and Well Log Analysts (SPWLA) *The Society of Underwater Technology (SUT) *World Petroleum Council (WPC) [http://www.onepetro.org OnePetro.org] ==SPE Petroleum Engineering Certification== The SPE Petroleum Engineering Certification program was instituted as a way to certify petroleum engineers by examination and experience. This certification is similar to the Registration of Petroleum Engineers by the States in the United States. Certified professionals use SPEC after their name == Petroleum Reserves and Resources Definitions == The Society of Petroleum Engineers has developed a system for evaluating oil and gas reserves and resources. The Petroleum Resources Management System (PRMS) is used by oil and gas companies in determining their reserves and serves as the primary basis for reporting rules established by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.
