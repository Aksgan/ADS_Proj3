[[algorithm]]s have been developed, some of great mathematical complexity. The end result is an image far sharper and clearer than could be obtained in the optical domain alone. This is typically a 3-dimensional operation, that analyzes a volumetric image (i.e. images taken at a variety of focal planes through the sample) and uses this data to reconstruct a more accurate 3-dimensional image. ==3D image techniques== Another common requirement is to take a series of images at a fixed position, but at different focal depths. Since most microscopic samples are essentially transparent, and the [[depth of field]] of the focused sample is exceptionally narrow, it is possible to capture images "through" a three-dimensional object using 2D equipment like [[Confocal microscopy|confocal microscopes]]. Software is then able to reconstruct a 3D model of the original sample which may be manipulated appropriately. The processing turns a 2D instrument into a 3D instrument, which would not otherwise exist. In recent times this technique has led to a number of scientific discoveries in cell biology. ==Analysis== Analysis of images will vary considerably according to application. Typical analysis includes determining where the edges of an object are, counting similar objects, calculating the area, perimeter length and other useful measurements of each object. A common approach is to create an image mask which only includes pixels that match certain criteria, then perform simpler scanning operations on the resulting mask. It is also possible to label objects and track their motion over a series of frames in a video sequence. ==References== {{cite book |last=Russ |first=John C. |title=The Image Processing Handbook |origyear=1992 |origmonth=January |edition=5th edition |date=2006-12-19 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=0849372542}} * Jan-Mark Geusebroek, Color and Geometrical Structure in Images, Applications in Microscopy, ISBN 90-5776-057-6 * Young Ian T., Not just pretty pictures: Digital quantitative microscopy, Proc.

The operating system is developed by [[Microsoft]] through the Microsoft Automotive Business Unit that formed in August 1995. The first automotive product built by Microsoft's Automotive Business Unit debuted on December 4, 1998 as the [[AutoPC]], and also includes [[Ford Sync]] and [[Blue&Me]]. Microsoft's Automotive Business Unit has built both the software platforms used for automotive devices as well as the devices themselves. The current focus is on the software platforms and includes two products, Microsoft Auto and Windows Automotive. ==History== The Microsoft Auto operating system was originally shipped with the [[AutoPC]] that was jointly-developed by Microsoft and [[Clarion (car audio)|Clarion]]. The system was released in December 1998, and referred to the operating system itself as "Auto PC".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/1998/12-4autopc.mspx |title=Drivers Keep Hands on Wheel, Eyes on Road, as Auto PC Provides Easy Access to Information and Entertainment |date=1998-12-04 |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=2009-05-07}}</ref> Microsoft's Auto PC platform was based on Windows CE 2.0, and had been announced in January of that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/1998/Jan98/AutoPCpr.mspx |title=Microsoft Pioneers Interactive Speech Technology |date=1998-01-08 |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=2009-05-07}}</ref> On October 16, 2000 Microsoft officially announced the next version of the platform.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2000/Oct00/WindowsPR.mspx |title=New Microsoft Windows CE for Automotive - Reliable, Flexible and Connected |date=2000-10-16 |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=2009-05-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://windowsitpro.com/article/articleid/19473/japanese-carmakers-sign-on-to-windows-ce.html |title=Japanese carmakers sign on to Windows CE |author=Thurrott, Paul |date=2000-09-19 |publisher=Windows IT Pro |accessdate=2009-05-07}}</ref> This version of the operating system was renamed to "Windows CE for Automotive".
