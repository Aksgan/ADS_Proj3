In the city of Calgary, with one of the most acute housing shortages, only 16 new units of rental housing were built in 1996. ===Deinstitutionalization=== [[Image:Homeless in Toronto.jpg|thumb|275px||A homeless man sleeps on the [[Toronto Transit Commission|TTC subway]].]] {{main|Deinstitutionalization}} The 1960s and 1970s also saw an international movement towards deinstitutionalization of the [[mentally ill]], moving them out of [[History of psychiatric institutions|asylums]] and other facilities, and releasing them into the community. Studies found that the vast majority of those who had been placed in asylums could be healthy and productive members of society if placed in the community and provided with the proper care and medication. Thus over these decades the number of people confined to mental institutions fell dramatically from just under 70,000 to about 20,000. However, while great savings were made by shutting down empty institutions much of this money was absorbed by general government funds, and did not make it into community care. No assurances were made that those discharged had access and were taking the medication they needed. While some of those discharged did integrate with the community, a significant number estimated at around 75% did not. Many of these individuals became homeless. Today up to 40% of homeless have some sort of mental illness.<ref>Murphy, Barbara. ''On the Street: How We Created the Homeless.'' Winnipeg: J. Gordon Shillingford, c2000.</ref> ===Poverty in Canada=== {{main|Poverty in Canada}} Poverty in Canada remains prevalent with certain groups in Canada. The measurement of poverty has been a challenge as there is no official government measure. Some groups, like the Canadian Council on Social Development and the National Anti-Poverty Organization, believe the low-income cut off published by Statistics Canada is applicable as a poverty measure regardless of whether its intent or designation is to be one. They have argued, that as it stands, the LICO is the best measure available that accurately measures a relative poverty rate. The LICO has fallen to a near a record low at 9.4% as of 2008, down from a recent high of 15.7% in 1996.[http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/famil19a-eng.htm] In the 2001 census, 702, 600 Canadians were considered to be at-risk for homelessness, in that they spent more than 50 per cent of their household income on shelter. Lack of income security combined with the lack of affordable housing creates the problem of "hidden" homelessness. The "hidden homeless" may actually fall back and forth between homelessness and being housed, making the problem of homelessness much larger than that identified in street or shelter counts<ref name="chumirethicsfoundation.ca"/> ==Solutions== The National Homeless Initiative (NHI), created in 1999, was the federal secretariat most directly responsible for homelessness matters until its closure in 2007. The NHI was created to fund transitional housing and a range of services for homeless people across the country. NHI funded the federal program Supporting Community Partnerships Initiative (SCPI) which covered the costs of temporary shelters and services for the homeless.<ref>Shapcott, M. (October 2007). "Ten Things You Should Know about housing and homelessness." Wellesley Institute. Policy Primer.</ref> The federal government replaced the NHI with the Homelessness Partnering Strategy (HPS) which was allocated to spend $270 million between 2007 and 2009<ref>Laird, Gordon (2007).

Government of Canada website [http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/corp/nero/nere/2008/2008-09-19-1000.cfm]</ref> Canada is one of the few countries in the world without a national housing strategy (United Nations, 2009). Many of the federal governments' expenditures are cost-sharing, one-time only funding initiatives that lack long-term leadership on homelessness. The United Nations has also noted the lack of information on these expenditures, including the number of houses produced.<ref name="United Nations 2009"/> Housing has been declared a fundamental human right. Canada helped to draft the 1948 UN Declaration of Human Rights that includes a right to access housing in Article 25. Canada also ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights in 1976, which recognizes an adequate standard of living, including housing, in Article 11.<ref>Experiencing Homelessness: Fourth Report Card on Ending Homelessness in Ottawa—January to December 2007.

Government of British Columbia.</ref> A plan to house Vancouver's homeless was proposed by a local architect. It called for the rapid erection of temporary villages assembled from the same type of modular units that mining companies provide for remote workers. "Stop Gap Shelters" is what architect [[Gregory Henriquez]] calls it. "All of us in this community have long been advocates for permanent housing," he said. "But we've gotten to the point where the numbers of homeless are so staggering that I'm left wondering if we will ever catch up doing it that way. I don't think we can. I think there has to be a stop-gap measure. And that's what this is." Henriquez drew up plans for a motel-like village, with 48 to 120 suites clustered around central courtyards. The colourful compound includes a managers' office, a covered patio, and a second storey meeting room.
