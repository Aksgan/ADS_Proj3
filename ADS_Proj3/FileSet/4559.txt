[[Loebner Prize]] competition. However, after nineteen Loebner Prize competitions, the contest is not viewed as contributing toward the science of machine intelligence, nor palliating the controversy surrounding the usefulness of Turing's test. ===Loebner Prize=== {{main|Loebner Prize}} The Loebner Prize provides an annual platform for practical Turing Tests with the first competition held in November, 1991.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sundman|2003}}</ref> It is underwritten by [[Hugh Loebner]]; the Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies in [[Massachusetts]], [[United States]] organized the Prizes up to and including the 2003 contest. As Loebner described it, one reason the competition was created is to advance the state of AI research, at least in part, because no one had taken steps to implement the Turing Test despite 40 years of discussing it [http://loebner.net/Prizef/In-response.html]. The first Loebner Prize competition in 1991 led to a renewed discussion of the viability of the Turing Test and the value of pursuing it, in both the popular press{{sfn|"Artificial Stupidity"|1992}} and in academia.<ref name=SHAPIRO_SHIEBER>{{harvnb|Shapiro|1992|page=10–11}} and {{harvnb|Shieber|1994}}, amongst others.</ref> The first contest was won by a mindless program with no identifiable intelligence that managed to fool naive interrogators into making the wrong identification. This highlighted several of the shortcomings of Turing test (discussed [[#Weaknesses of the test|below]]): The winner won, at least in part, because it was able to "imitate human typing errors";{{sfn|"Artificial Stupidity"|1992}} the unsophisticated interrogators were easily fooled;<ref name=SHAPIRO_SHIEBER/> and some researchers in AI have been led to feel that the test is merely a distraction from more fruitful research.<ref name=SHIEBER>{{harvnb|Shieber|1994|page=77}}</ref> The silver (text only) and gold (audio and visual) prizes have never been won. However, the competition has awarded the bronze medal every year for the computer system that, in the judges' opinions, demonstrates the "most human" conversational behavior among that year's entries. [[Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity]] (A.L.I.C.E.) has won the bronze award on three occasions in recent times (2000, 2001, 2004). Learning AI [[Jabberwacky]] won in 2005 and 2006.<ref>Jabberwacky is discussed in {{harvnb|Shah|Warwick|2009a}}.</ref> The Loebner Prize tests conversational intelligence; winners are typically [[chatterbot]] programs, or [[Artificial Conversational Entity (ACE)|Artificial Conversational Entities (ACE)]]s. Early Loebner Prize rules restricted conversations: Each entry and hidden-human conversed on a single topic, thus the interrogators were restricted to one line of questioning per entity interaction. The restricted conversation rule was lifted for the 1995 Loebner Prize. Interaction duration between judge and entity has varied in Loebner Prizes. In Loebner 2003, at the University of Surrey, each interrogator was allowed five minutes to interact with an entity, machine or hidden-human. Between 2004 and 2007, the interaction time allowed in Loebner Prizes was more than twenty minutes. In 2008, the interrogation duration allowed was five minutes per pair, because the organiser, [[Kevin Warwick]], and coordinator, Huma Shah, consider this to be the duration for any test, as Turing stated in his 1950 paper: " ... making the right identification after five minutes of questioning".<ref name=T442>{{Harvnb|Turing|1950|p=442}}</ref> They felt Loebner's longer test, implemented in Loebner Prizes 2006 and 2007, was inappropriate for the state of artificial conversation technology.{{sfn|Shah|2009}} It is ironic that the 2008 winning entry, [[Elbot]], does not mimic a human; its personality is that of a robot, yet Elbot deceived three human judges that it was the human during human-parallel comparisons.<ref>See {{Harvtxt|Shah|Warwick|2010}}.

This was to test the alternative reading of Turing's prediction that the 5-minute interaction was to be with the computer. For the 2010 competition, the Sponsor has again increased the interaction time, between interrogator and system, to 25 minutes ([http://loebner.net/Prizef/2010_Contest/Loebner_Prize_Rules_2010.html Rules for the 20th Loebner Prize contest]). ===2005 Colloquium on Conversational Systems=== In November 2005, the University of Surrey hosted an inaugural one-day meeting of artificial conversational entity developers,<ref> {{cite web | url=http://www.alicebot.org/bbbbbbb.html | title=ALICE Anniversary and Colloquium on Conversation | publisher=A.L.I.C.E.

Invited speakers included [[David Hamill]], Hugh Loebner (sponsor of the [[Loebner Prize]]) and Huma Shah. ===AISB 2008 Symposium on the Turing Test=== In parallel to the 2008 [[Loebner Prize]] held at the [[University of Reading]],<ref> {{cite web | url=http://www.reading.ac.uk/cirg/loebner/cirg-loebner-main.asp | title=Loebner Prize 2008 | publisher=University of Reading | accessdate=29 March 2009 }} </ref> the [[Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and the Simulation of Behaviour]] (AISB), hosted a one-day symposium to discuss the Turing Test, organised by [http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~jab/ John Barnden], [[Mark Bishop]], Huma Shah and [[Kevin Warwick]].<ref> {{cite web | url= http://www.aisb.org.uk/events/turingevent.shtml | title=AISB 2008 Symposium on the Turing Test | publisher=Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and the Simulation of Behaviour | accessdate=29 March 2009 }} </ref> The Speakers included Royal Institution's Director [[Susan Greenfield, Baroness Greenfield|Baroness Susan Greenfield]], [[Selmer Bringsjord]], Turing's biographer [[Andrew Hodges]], and consciousness scientist [[Owen Holland]]. No agreement emerged for a canonical Turing Test, though Bringsjord expressed that a sizeable prize would result in the Turing Test being passed sooner. ===The Alan Turing Year, and Turing100 in 2012=== 2012 will <!-- or "The year 2010 will": First letter of a sentence is capitalized-->see a celebration of Turing’s life and scientific impact, with a number of major events taking place throughout the year.
