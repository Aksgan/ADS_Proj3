''physical'' object apprehended in [[perception]]: it can just as well be a fantasy or a memory. Consequently, these "structures" of consciousness, i.e., perception, memory, fantasy, etc., are called ''intentionalities''. The cardinal principle of phenomenology, the term intentionality originated with the [[Scholastics]] in the medieval period and was resurrected by Brentano who in turn influenced Husserl’s conception of phenomenology, who refined the term and made it the cornerstone of his theory of consciousness. The meaning of the term is complex and depends entirely on how it is conceived by a given philosopher. The term should not be confused with “intention” or the psychoanalytic conception of unconscious “motive” or “gain.” ===Intuition=== [[Intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]] in phenomenology refers to those cases where the intentional object is directly present to the intentionality at play; if the intention is "filled" by the direct apprehension of the object, you have an intuited object. Having a cup of coffee in front of you, for instance, seeing it, feeling it, or even imagining it - these are all filled intentions, and the object is then ''intuited''. The same goes for the apprehension of mathematical formulae or a number. If you do not have the object as referred to directly, the object is not intuited, but still intended, but then ''emptily''. Examples of empty intentions can be signitive intentions - intentions that only ''imply'' or ''refer to'' their objects. ===Evidence=== In everyday language, we use the word [[evidence]] to signify a special sort of relation between a state of affairs and a proposition: State A is evidence for the proposition "A is true." In phenomenology, however, the concept of evidence is meant to signify the "subjective achievement of truth." <ref>Robert Sokolowski, ''Introduction to Phenomenology'', Cambridge University Press (2000). Pp. 159-160. This use of the word evidence may seem strange in English, but is more common in German, which is the language Husserl wrote in.</ref> This is not an attempt to reduce the objective sort of evidence to subjective "opinion," but rather an attempt to describe the structure of having something present in intuition with the addition of having it present as ''intelligible'': "Evidence is the successful presentation of an intelligible object, the successful presentation of something whose truth becomes manifest in the evidencing itself." <ref>Sokolowski, ''Introduction'', pp. 160-161.</ref> ===Noesis and Noema=== {{Main|Noema}} In Husserl's phenomenology, this pair of terms, derived from the Greek ''[[nous]]'' (mind), designate respectively the real content, noesis, and the ideal content, noema, of an intentional act (an act of consciousness). The [[Noesis]] is the part of the act which gives it a particular sense or character (as in judging or perceiving something, loving or hating it, accepting or rejecting it, and so on). This is real in the sense that it is actually part of what takes place in the consciousness (or psyche) of the subject of the act. The [[Noesis]] is always correlated with a [[Noema]]; for Husserl the full Noema is a complex ideal structure comprising at least a noematic sense and a noematic core. The correct interpretation of what Husserl meant by the [[Noema]] has long been controversial, but the noematic sense is generally understood as the ideal meaning of the act <ref>I.e. if A loves B, loving is a real part of A's conscious activity - [[Noesis]] - but gets its sense from the general concept of loving, which has an abstract or ideal meaning, as "loving" has a meaning in the English language independently of what an individual means by the word when they use it.</ref> and the noematic core as the act's referent or object ''as it is meant in the act''. One element of controversy is whether this noematic object is the same as the actual object of the act (assuming it exists) or is some kind of ideal object.<ref>For a full account of the controversy and a review of positions taken, see David Woodruff Smith, ''Husserl'', Routledge, 2007, pp304-311.</ref> ===Empathy and Intersubjectivity=== {{Main|empathy}} {{Main|intersubjectivity}} In phenomenology, [[empathy]] refers to the experience of another human body ''as'' another. While we often identify others with their physical bodies, this type of phenomenology requires that we focus on the [[subjectivity]] of the other, as well as our intersubjective engagement with them. In Husserl's original account, this was done by a sort of [[apperception]] built on the experiences of your own lived-body. The [[lived body]] is your own body as experienced by yourself, ''as'' yourself. Your own body manifests itself to you mainly as your possibilities of acting in the world. It is what lets you reach out and grab something, for instance, but it also, and more importantly, allows for the possibility of changing your point of view. This helps you differentiate one thing from another by the experience of moving around it, seeing new aspects of it (often referred to as making the absent present and the present absent), and still retaining the notion that this is the same thing that you saw other aspects of just a moment ago (it is identical). Your body is also experienced as a duality, both as object (you can touch your own hand) and as your own subjectivity (you experience being touched). The experience of your own body as your own subjectivity is then applied to the experience of another's body, which, through apperception, is constituted as another subjectivity. You can thus recognise the Other's intentions, emotions, etc. This experience of empathy is important in the phenomenological account of [[intersubjectivity]]. In phenomenology, intersubjectivity constitutes objectivity (i.e., what you experience as objective is experienced as being intersubjectively available - available to all other subjects. This does not imply that objectivity is reduced to subjectivity nor does it imply a relativist position, cf. for instance [[intersubjective verifiability]]). In the experience of intersubjectivity, one also experiences oneself as being a subject among other subjects, and one experiences oneself as existing objectively ''for'' these [[Other]]s; one experiences oneself as the noema of Others' noeses, or as a subject in another's empathic experience. As such, one experiences oneself
