thus allowing informed diagnostic intervention in [[heart failure]]. It is also called '''radionuclide angiography''', as well as '''gated blood pool imaging'''. This modality uniquely provides a [[cine]] image of the beating heart, and allows the interpreter to determine the efficiency of the individual [[heart valve]]s and [[heart chamber|chamber]]s. MUGA/Cine scanning represents a robust but invasive adjunct to the noninvasive [[echocardiogram]]. Mathematics regarding acquisition of [[cardiac output|''Q'']] is well served by both of these methods as well as other inexpensive models supporting [[ejection fraction]] as a product of the heart/myocardium in [[systole]]. == Purpose == MUGA is typically ordered for the following patients: * With known or suspected [[coronary artery disease]], to diagnose the disease and predict outcomes * With [[lesion]]s in their [[heart valve]]s * With [[heart failure|congestive heart failure]] * Who have undergone [[percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty]], [[coronary artery bypass graft]] surgery, or medical therapy, to assess the efficacy of the treatment * With low [[cardiac output]] after [[open-heart surgery]] * Who are undergoing [[cardiotoxic]] drug agents such as in [[chemotherapy]] e.g., with [[doxorubicin]] or [[immunotherapy]] ([[herceptin]]) * Who have had a [[cardiac transplant]] == Procedure == At a high level, the MUGA test involves the introduction of a [[radioactive marker]] into the bloodstream of the patient. The patient is subsequently scanned to determine the circulation dynamics of the marker, and hence the blood. The introduction of the radioactive marker can either take place ''[[in vivo]]'' or ''[[in vitro]]''. In the in vivo method, stannous ([[tin]]) ions are injected into the patient's bloodstream. A subsequent intravenous injection of the [[radioactive]] substance, [[technetium]]-99m-[[pertechnetate]], labels the red blood cells ''[[in vivo]]''. With an administered activity of about 800 [[Becquerel|MBq]], the [[effective dose|effective radiation dose]] is about 8 [[Sievert|mSv]] to 12 mSv. In the ''in vitro'' method, some of the patient's blood is drawn and the stannous ions (in the form of [[stannous chloride]]) are injected into the drawn blood. The technetium is subsequently added to the mixture as in the ''in vivo'' method. In both cases, the stannous chloride dilutes the technetium and prevents it from leaking out of the red blood cells during the procedure. The patient is placed under a [[gamma camera]], which detects the low-level 140[[keV]] [[gamma ray|gamma]] radiation being given off by technetium-99m. As the gamma camera images are acquired, the patient's heart beat is used to 'gate' the acquisition. The final result is a series of images of the heart (usually sixteen), one at each stage of the [[cardiac cycle]]. Depending on the objectives of the test, the doctor may decide to perform either a resting or a stress MUGA. During the resting MUGA, the patient lies stationary, whereas during a stress MUGA, the patient is asked to exercise during the scan. The stress MUGA measures the heart performance during exercise and is usually performed to assess the impact of a suspected coronary artery disease. In some rare cases, a [[nitroglycerin]] MUGA may be performed, where nitroglycerin (a [[vasodilator]]) is administered prior to the scan. The resulting images show that the [[volumetric]]ally derived blood pools in the chambers of the heart and timed images may be computationally interpreted to calculate the [[ejection fraction]] and [[injection fraction]] of the heart. This antiquated nuclear medicine scan yields an accurate, inexpensive and easily reproducible means of measuring and monitoring the ejection and injection fractions of the ventricles, which are one of many of the important clinical metrics in assessing global heart performance. == Results == ===Normal results=== In normal subjects, the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) should be about 60% (range, 50-80%). There should be no area of abnormal wall motion ([[hypokinesis]] or [[dyskinesis]]). Abnormalities in cardiac function may be manifested as a decrease in LVEF and/or the presence of abnormalities in global and regional wall motion. For normal subjects, peak filling rates should be between 2.4 and 3.6 [[end diastolic volume]] (EDV) per second, and the time to peak filling rate should be 135-212 msec. ===Abnormal results=== An uneven distribution of technetium in the heart indicates that the patient has coronary artery disease, a [[cardiomyopathy]], or blood shunting within the heart. Abnormalities in a resting MUGA usually indicate a heart attack, while those that occur during exercise usually indicate [[ischemia]]. In a stress MUGA, patients with coronary artery disease may exhibit a decrease in ejection fraction. For a patient that has had a heart attack, or is suspected of having another disease that affects the heart muscle, this scan can help pinpoint the position in the heart that has sustained damage as well as assess the degree of damage. MUGA scans are also used to evaluate heart function prior to and while receiving certain chemotherapies (e.g. doxorubicin (Adriamycin)) or immunotherapy (specifically, [[herceptin]]) that have a known effect on heart function. ==External links== * {{MeshName|Radionuclide+Angiography}} {{Vascular procedures}} [[Category:Medical imaging]] [[fa:اسکن موگا]]</text> </page> <page> <id>31150</id> <title>Radiosity (3D computer graphics)</title> <text>{{Cleanup-jargon|date=July 2009}} [[Image:Radiosity - RRV, step 79.png|thumb|300px|right|Screenshot of scene rendered with RRV (simple implementation of radiosity renderer based on OpenGL) 79<sup>th</sup> iteration.]] '''Radiosity''' is a [[global illumination]] [[algorithm]] used in [[3D computer graphics]] [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]]. Radiosity is an application of the [[finite element method]] to solving the [[rendering equation]] for scenes with purely diffuse surfaces. Unlike [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo algorithms]] (such as [[path tracing]]) which handle all types of light paths, typical radiosity methods only account for paths which leave a light source and are reflected diffusely some number of times (possibly zero) before hitting the eye. Such paths are represented as "LD*E". Radiosity calculations are viewpoint independent which increases the computations involved, but makes them useful for all viewpoints. Radiosity methods were first developed in about 1950 in the engineering field of [[heat transfer]]. They were later refined specifically for application to the problem of rendering computer graphics in 1984 by researchers at [[Cornell University]]<ref>"[http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~cutler/classes/advancedgraphics/S07/lectures/goral.pdf Modeling the interaction of light between diffuse surfaces]", C.
