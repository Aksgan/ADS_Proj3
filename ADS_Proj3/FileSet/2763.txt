The album was re-released in 1985 for the European market and re-packaged as ''Madonna â€“ The First Album''. In 1982, during establishing herself as a singer in New York downtown, Madonna met Seymour Stein, president of Sire Records, who signed her after listening to her single "[[Everybody (Madonna song)|Everybody]]". The success of the single prompted Sire to sign her for an album's deal. For the album, Madonna chose to work with [[Reggie Lucas]], a Warner Bros. producer. However, she was not happy with the completed tracks and disagreed with Lucas's production techniques, so decided to seek additional help with the production. Madonna then invited her boyfriend at the time, [[John Benitez|John "Jellybean" Benitez]], to help her finish the album. Benitez remixed many of the tracks and produced "[[Holiday (Madonna song)|Holiday]]". The overall sound of ''Madonna'' is dissonant, and is in the form of upbeat synthetic disco, utilising some of the new technology of the time, like the usage of [[LinnDrum|Linn drum machine]], [[Moog Taurus|Moog bass]] and the [[:File:OB-X keyboard.jpg|OB-X synthesizer]]. The songs on the album are sung by Madonna in a bright, girlish vocal timbre, and lyrically talks about love and relationships. Contemporary critics have applauded the album, but it received negative feedback when it was released in 1983. In 2008, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' named it as the fifth of "Top 100 Best Albums of Past 25 Years." The album was successful on the charts, reaching number eight on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and the top ten of the charts in Australia, France, Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden and United Kingdom. It was certified five-times [[RIAA certification|platinum]], by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), for shipments of five million copies across the United States. Worldwide, the album has sold ten million copies. Five singles were released from the album, with "[[Holiday (Madonna song)|Holiday]]" becoming her first song to chart on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and "[[Lucky Star (song)|Lucky Star]]", her first top-five hit. The album was promoted by [[The Virgin Tour]] in 1985. Madonna has often remarked that she wished she had more variety in the songs of the album, and had more creative control. However, critics and scholars noted that with the album, Madonna introduced a style of upbeat dance music that would prove particularly appealing to future gay audiences. With ''Madonna'', she began her career as a disco diva. ==Background== [[File:18.DWT-Holiday.jpg|thumb|Madonna performing "Holiday" on the [[Drowned World Tour]], 2001|alt=Right profile of a blond woman, flanked by two other woman who are singing in a microphone.

Soon they abandoned playing songs in the hard-rock genre, and got signed by a music management company called Gotham Records, planning to move in a new musical direction.<ref name="madonnabbc">{{harvnb|Cross|2007|p=27}}</ref> They decided to pursue the [[funk]] genre, but the record company was not happy with their musical talents and they were dropped from the label; Madonna and Bray left the band also.<ref name="rook"/> Meanwhile, she had written and developed some songs on her own. She carried rough tapes of three of the songs, "[[Everybody (Madonna song)|Everybody]]", "Ain't No Big Deal" and "[[Burning Up]]". At that time she was frequenting the [[Danceteria]] nightclub in New York. It was here that Madonna convinced the [[Disc jockey|DJ]] [[Mark Kamins]] to play "Everybody".<ref name="rook"/> The song was received positively by the crowd, and Kamins decided that he should get Madonna a record deal, on the understanding that he would get to produce the [[single (music)|single]].<ref name="rook"/> He took her to his boss [[Chris Blackwell]], who owned [[Island Records]], but Blackwell refused to sign Madonna so they approached [[Sire Records]].<ref name=morton1>{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=142}}</ref> Michael Rosenblatt, who worked at the [[artists and repertoire]] department of Sire, offered Madonna $ 5,000 in advance, plus $ 10,000 in royalties, for each song she wrote.<ref name="rook2">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=5}}</ref><ref name=cross1>{{harvnb|Cross|2007|p=25}}</ref> Madonna was ultimately signed for two [[12-inch single|12" singles]] by the President of Sire, Seymour Stein, who was impressed by her singing,<ref name="rook2"/> after listening to "Everybody" at a hospital in Lenox Hill where he was admitted.<ref name=cross1/> The 12" version of "Everybody" was produced by Mark Kamins at Blank Tapes Studios in New York, who took over the [[Record producer|production]] work from Steve Bray.<ref name=cross1/> The new recording ran 5:56 on one side and 9:23 for the dub version on the reverse side.
