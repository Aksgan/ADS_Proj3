microscopic details, such as the choice of the lattice. One important quantity that appears in conjectures for universal laws is the connective constant, defined as follows. Let <math>c_n</math> denote the number of n-step self-avoiding walks. Since every n+m step self avoiding walk can be decomposed into an n-step self-avoiding walk and an m-step self-avoiding walk, it follows that <math> c_{n+m} \leq c_n c_m </math>. Then by applying [[Fekete's lemma]] to the logarithm of the above relation, the limit <math>\mu = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} c_n^{1/n}</math> can be shown to exist. This number <math>\mu</math> is called the connective constant, and clearly depends on the particular lattice chosen for the walk since <math>c_n</math> does. The value of <math>\mu</math> is only precisely known for the hexagonal lattice, where it is equal to <math>\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}</math>. For other lattices, <math>\mu</math> has only been approximated numerically, and is believed to not even be an algebraic number. It is conjectured that <math>c_n \approx \mu^n n^{11/32}</math> as n goes to infinity, where <math>\mu</math> depends on the lattice, but the power law correction <math>n^{11/32}</math> does not, in other words, this law is believed to be universal. ==Limits== Consider the uniform measure on n-step self-avoiding walks in the full plane. It is currently unknown whether the limit of the uniform measure as n goes to infinity induces a measure on infinite full-plane walks. However, [[Harry Kesten]] has shown that such a measure exists for self-avoiding walks in the half-plane. One important question involving self-avoiding walks is the existence and conformal invariance of the scaling limit, that is, the limit as the length of the walk goes to infinity and the mesh of the lattice goes to zero. The scaling limit of the self-avoiding is conjectured to be described by [[Schramm-Loewner Evolution]] with parameter <math>\kappa = 8/3</math>. ==Further reading== <div class="references-small"> # {{ cite book | last = Madras | first = N. | coauthors = Slade, G. | year = 1996 | title = The Self-Avoiding Walk | publisher = Birkhäuser | isbn = 978-0817638917 }} # {{ cite book | last = Lawler | first = G.

For example, the statement "I am lazy" is a self-assessment that contributes to the self-concept. In contrast, the statement "I am tired" would not normally be considered part of someone's self-concept, since being tired is a temporary state (and moreover one not reflecting the element of subjective judgement involved in the assessment of perceived laziness). A person's self-concept may change with time, possibly going through turbulent periods of [[identity crisis (psychology)|identity crisis]] and reassessment. The self-concept is not restricted to the present. It includes past selves and future selves. Future selves or "possible selves" represent individuals' ideas of what they might become, what they would like to become, and what they are afraid of becoming. They correspond to hopes, fears, standards, goals, and threats. Possible selves may function as incentives for future behavior and they also provide an evaluative and interpretive context for the current view of self.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.41.9.954 | last1 = Markus | first1 = H. | last2 = Nurius | first2 = P. | year = 1986 | title = Possible selves | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 41 | issue
