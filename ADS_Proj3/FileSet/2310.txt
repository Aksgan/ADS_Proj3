In 2005, Mr. Burks was a suspect in the remote access of the [[National security|National Security]] database. The investigation concluded that there was not sufficient evidence to gain interest to a primary suspect because there was no evidence of file disturbance. In 2006, he designed a method of programming that utilizes [[probability theory]]. The method is still under investigation however it is being utilized at several universities throughout the United States. Jason Burks was also believed to be part of the Caltech 6 which is a group of civilian personnel, all of which have special forces backgrounds. They assist with high level I.T. security within government agencies.<ref>http://www.answers.com/topic/hacker</ref> Mr. Burks was an engineering consultant with several government agencies and intelligence communities.

"Mr. Burks' vehicle slowed to a stop in the outside turn lane, then suddenly turned left and accelerated to the east side of the road on Aspen. The vehicle went over the curb, struck several roadside objects including a fire hydrant, then rolled on to the top of the vehicle coming to rest in the westbound lanes of Albany," "The cause of the collision appears to be a medical condition on the part of Mr. Burks", said BAPD Traffic Specialist Sgt. Ed Ferguson. == Trivia == {{Trivia|date=September 2009}} * Mr. Burks' pseudonym was taken from the religion Voodoo because both he and the religion are widely misunderstood. == External links == *http://www.corpsecinternational.com/news *http://www.hackerscrypt.com *http://www.v00d00.com == References == {{reflist}} *HackerMAG, page 26 "Going Straight" author Sam Davies.

Jones began programming on [[Apple Inc|Apple computers]] in high school, assembling a multiplayer game called ''[[Minotaur: The Labyrinths of Crete]]''. While attending the [[University of Chicago]] Jones met Seropian and the two formed a partnership to publish ''Minotaur''. Following the modest success of ''Minotaur'', Jones programmed Bungie's next game, ''[[Pathways Into Darkness]]'', and worked on code, level design and story development for Bungie's ''[[Marathon Trilogy|Marathon]]'' and ''[[Myth (series)|Myth]]'' series. For Bungie's next projects, ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' and ''[[Halo 2]]'', Jones took on a more managerial role as project lead. He is currently working on an unannounced video game series. ==Early life== Jones became interested in programming in high school, and learned [[Applesoft BASIC]] and [[Assembly language|6502 Assembly]] on an [[Apple II series]] computer. When Apple released its [[Macintosh]] line, Jones' family purchased a [[Macintosh 128K]], but Jones never programmed much for it. After high school Jones got a job programming for a [[computer-aided design]] company on PCs, before going to college the next year. In his off time Jones said that all he ever did on the Apple II was write games, "and it seemed logical to continue that on the Mac," he said. "The first thing I did on the Mac was to port a modem game I'd written called ''Minotaur'' from 6502 Assembly on the Apple II into MPW C on the Mac. I was still finishing that when I came to college. By that time, I knew I wanted to write games."<ref name="img-93 interview">{{cite web|author=Rouse, Richard III|year=1993|month=October|title=IMG Interview: Bungie's Jason Jones|publisher=[[Inside Mac Games]]}}â€”[http://pid.bungie.org/IMGjasoninterviewOct93.html Archive] available at [[Halo.Bungie.Org|Bungie.org]], retrieved 2010-02-22.</ref> ==Bungie== Jones met [[Alex Seropian]] in his second year at the [[University of Chicago]].
