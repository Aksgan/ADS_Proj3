reported that some, but not all, will work with EDO memory<ref>[http://www.hpprintermemory.com/index.html#y Page on memory upgrades for HP printers]</ref>. It is fairly easy to solder wires to the PD pins to make non-HP modules work<ref>[http://www.keycruncher.com/blog/2003/12/14/making-standard-simm-s-work-memory-upgrade-on-the-hp-laserjet-6mp-5mp/ Making Standard SIMMs Work â€“ Memory Upgrade on the HP LaserJet 6MP/5MP]</ref>. HP printers of this type specify that RAM not faster than 70ns be used; this is probably due to a limitation of the PD encoding. Faster RAM can be used, but the PD encoding should indicate a speed of 70 ns. ==References== <references/> ==External links== * [http://www.jedec.org/download/search/4_01_02_00R9.PDF Serial Presence Detect Standard, General Standard] * [http://www.jedec.org/download/search/4_01_02_04R13.PDF SPD Rev1.0 for DDR SDRAM] * [http://www.jedec.org/download/search/4_01_02_10R14.pdf SPD Rev1.2 for DDR2 SDRAM] * [http://www.jedec.org/download/search/4_01_02_10R17.pdf SPD Rev1.3 for DDR2 SDRAM] * [http://www.jedec.org/download/search/JESD208.pdf SPECIALITY DDR2-1066 SDRAM] * Linux package [http://www.lm-sensors.org/wiki/I2CTools i2c-tools] * Instructions on how to use lm-sensors or i2c-tools to read the data: [http://ornellas.apanela.com/dokuwiki/pub:spd http://ornellas.apanela.com/dokuwiki/pub:spd] {{Use dmy dates|date=September 2010}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Serial Presence Detect}} [[Category:Computer memory]] [[de:Serial Presence Detect]] [[es:Serial Presence Detect]] [[pl:Serial Presence Detect]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33990</id> <title>Series and parallel circuits</title> <text>[[Image:Series circuit.svg|right|thumb|A series circuit with a [[voltage source]] (such as a battery) and 3 resistors]] Components of an [[electrical circuit]] or [[electronic circuit]] can be connected in [[topology (electronics)|many different ways]]. The two simplest of these are called '''series''' and '''parallel''' and occur very frequently. Components connected in series are connected along a single path, so the same [[electric current|current]] flows through all of the components.<ref name=R&H321>Resnick ''et al.'' (1966), Chapter 32, Example 1.</ref><ref>Smith, R.J. (1966), page 21</ref> Components connected in parallel are connected so the same [[voltage]] is applied to each component.<ref name=R&H324>Resnick ''et al.'' (1966), Chapter 32, Example 4.</ref> A circuit composed solely of components connected in series is known as a '''series circuit'''; likewise, one connected completely in parallel is known as a '''parallel circuit'''. In a series circuit, the current through each of the components is the same, and the [[voltage]] across the components is the sum of the voltages across each component.<ref name=R&H321/> In a parallel circuit, the voltage across each of the components is the same, and the total current is the sum of the currents through each component.<ref name=R&H324/> As an example, consider a very simple circuit consisting of four light bulbs and one 6 V [[battery (electricity)|battery]]. If a wire joins the battery to one bulb, to the next bulb, to the next bulb, to the next bulb, then back to the battery, in one continuous loop, the bulbs are said to be in series. If each bulb is wired to the battery in a separate loop, the bulbs are said to be in parallel. If the four light bulbs are connected in series, there is same current through all of them, and the voltage drop is 1.5 V across each bulb, which may not be sufficient to make them glow. If the light bulbs are connected in parallel, the currents through the light bulbs combine to form the current in the battery, while the voltage drop is 6.0 V across each bulb and they all glow. In a series circuit, every device must function for the circuit to be complete. One bulb burning out in a series circuit breaks the circuit. In parallel circuits, each light has its own circuit, so all but one light could be burned out, and the last one will still function. == Series circuits ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Battery (electricity)]] --> '''Series circuits''' are sometimes called ''current''-coupled or [[Daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy chain]]-coupled. The [[Electric current|current]] in a series circuit goes through every component in the circuit. Therefore, all of the components in a series connection carry the same current. {{anchor|Rseries}} === Resistors === [[Image:Resistors in series.svg|This is a diagram of several resistors, connected end to end, with the same amount of current through each.]] :<math>R_\mathrm{total} = R_1 + R_2 + \cdots + R_n</math> {{anchor|Lseries}} [[Electrical conductance]] presents a reciprocal quantity to resistance. Total conductance of a series circuits of pure resistors, therefore, can be calculated from the following expression: :<math>\frac{1}{G_\mathrm{total}} = \frac{1}{G_1} + \frac{1}{G_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{G_n}</math>. For a special case of two resistors in series, the total conductance is equal to: :<math>G_{total} = \frac{G_1 G_2}{G_1+G_2}.</math> === Inductors === [[Inductor]]s follow the same law, in that the total [[inductance]] of non-coupled inductors in series is equal to the sum of their individual inductances: [[Image:Inductors in series.svg|A diagram of several inductors, connected end to end, with the same amount of current going through each.]] :<math>L_\mathrm{total} = L_1 + L_2 + \cdots + L_n</math> However, in some situations it is difficult to prevent adjacent inductors from influencing each other, as the magnetic field of one device couples with the windings of its neighbours. This influence is defined by the mutual inductance M. For example, if two inductors are in series, there are two possible equivalent inductances depending on how the magnetic fields of both inductors influence each other. When there are more than two inductors, the mutual inductance between each of them and the way the coils influence each other complicates the calculation. For a larger number of coils the total combined inductance is given by the sum of all mutual inductances between the various coils including the mutual inductance of each given coil with itself, which we term self-inductance or simply inductance. For three coils, there are six mutual inductances <math>M_{12}</math>, <math>M_{13}</math>, <math>M_{23}</math> and <math>M_{21}</math>, <math>M_{31}</math> and <math>M_{32}</math>. There are also the three self-inductances of the three coils: <math>M_{11}</math>, <math>M_{22}</math> and <math>M_{33}</math>. Therefore :<math>L_\mathrm{total} = (M_{11} + M_{22} + M_{33}) + (M_{12} + M_{13} + M_{23}) + (M_{21} + M_{31} + M_{32})</math> By reciprocity <math>M_{ij}</math> = <math>M_{ji}</math> so that the last two groups can be combined. The first three terms represent the sum of the self-inductances of the various coils. The formula is easily extended to any number of series coils with mutual coupling. The method can be used to find the self-inductance of large coils of wire of any cross-sectional shape by computing the sum of the mutual inductance of each turn
