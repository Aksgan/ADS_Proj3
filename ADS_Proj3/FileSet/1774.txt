Google, UM serves as an agent in an initiative that radically increases the availability of information to the public. The University of Michigan embraces this project as a means to make information available as broadly and conveniently as possible. Moreover, the UM Library embarked on this ground-breaking partnership for a number of very compelling reasons: :* "We believe that, beyond providing basic access to library collections, this activity is critically transformative, enabling the University Library to build on and re-conceive vital library services for the new millennium. :* "This work will create new ways for users to search and access library content, opening up our collections to our own users and to users throughout the world. :* "Although we have engaged in large-scale, preservation-based conversion of materials in the Library's collection for several years, and have been a leader in digital preservation efforts among research libraries, we know that only through partnerships of this sort can conversion of this scale be achieved. Our program is strong, and we have been able to digitize approximately 5,000 volumes/year; nevertheless, at this rate, it would take us more than a thousand years to digitize our entire collection." ::: -– [[John P. Wilkin]], Associate University Librarian.<ref name="GBLP1"/> ====University of Oxford==== [[University of Oxford]] is an institutional participant in this project.<ref>[http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/google/ Oxford + Google]</ref> Oxford is the oldest university in the English-speaking world, and its historic [[Bodleian Library]] is the oldest university library. :"The Bodleian Library's mission, from its founding in 1602, has been based on Sir Thomas Bodley's vision of a library serving the worldwide 'Republic of Letters', with the Library's collections open to all who have need to use them. To this day over 60% of readers who use and work in the Bodleian Library have no direct affiliation with the University of Oxford . The Google Library Project in Oxford testifies to our ongoing commitment to enable and facilitate access to our content for the scholarly community and beyond. The initiative will carry forward Sir Thomas Bodley's vision and the ethos of the Bodleian Library into the digital age, allowing readers from around the world to access the Library's collections over the World Wide Web." ::: -– [[Ronald Milne]], former Director of Oxford University Library & Bodleian Librarian.<ref name="GBLP1"/> ===<u>Additional Project Partners</u>=== Other institutional partners have joined the Project in the years since the partnership was first announced. ====Bavarian State Library==== The [[Bavarian State Library]] (''[[Bayerische Staatsbibliothek]]'' or [[Bavarian State Library|BSB]]) is an institutional participant in the project.<ref>[http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6422888.html Bavaria + Google (in English)]; [http://wiki.netbib.de/coma/GooglePrint Staatsbibliothek + Google (in German)]</ref> :"With today's announcement we are opening our library to the world and bringing the true purpose of libraries — the discovery of books and knowledge — a decisive step further in into the digital era. This is an exciting effort to help readers around the world discover and access Germany's rich literary tradition online — whenever and wherever they want." ::: — Dr. [[Rolf Griebel]], Director General of the Bavarian State Library.<ref name="GBLP1"/> ====Columbia University==== [[Columbia University]] (and [[Columbia University Library System]]) is an institutional participant in the project.<ref name="GBLP1"/> :"Our participation in the Google Book Search Library Project will add significantly to the extensive digital resources the Libraries already deliver," said James Neal, Columbia's vice president for information services and university librarian. "It will enable the Libraries to make available more significant portions of its extraordinary archival and special collections to scholars and researchers worldwide in ways that will ultimately change the nature of scholarship." ::: — [[James G.

Today the CIC is an active participant in the Google Books Library Project, which becomes something of a logical extension of the initial working relationships forged a half century ago amongst Big Ten universities and the University of Chicago. * The CIC is a consortium of 12 research universities: ** [[Indiana University]], [[Bloomington, Indiana]] ** [[Michigan State University]] ** [[Northwestern University]] ** [[Ohio State University]] ** [[Pennsylvania State University]] ** [[Purdue University]] ** [[University of Chicago]] ** [[University of Illinois]] ** [[University of Iowa]] ** [[University of Michigan]] ** [[University of Minnesota]] ** [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] The CIC is guided by the Provosts of the member universities; and the CIC Digital Library Initiatives Overview Committee monitors the digitization and dissemination of books in the CIC collections.<ref>[http://www.cic.uiuc.edu/groups/DigitalLibraryInitiativeOverviewCommittee/index.shtml CIC overview]</ref> :"This partnership with Google is one of the most ambitious undertakings in the history of the CIC, and sets the stage for a remarkable transformation of library services and information access. We're opening up these resources as both a common good shared among the universities, as well as a public good available more broadly.
