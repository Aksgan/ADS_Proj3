time-frequency interpretation of the CWT (1991), Newland's [[Harmonic wavelet transform]] (1993) and many others since. === Timeline === * First wavelet ([[Haar wavelet]]) by [[Alfred Haar]] (1909) * Since the 1970s: [[George Zweig]], [[Jean Morlet]], [[Alex Grossman]]n * Since the 1980s: [[Yves Meyer]], [[Stéphane Mallat]], [[Ingrid Daubechies]], [[Ronald Coifman]], [[Victor Wickerhauser]], == Wavelet transforms == A wavelet is a mathematical function used to divide a given function or [[continuous signal|continuous-time signal]] into different scale components. Usually one can assign a frequency range to each scale component. Each scale component can then be studied with a resolution that matches its scale. A wavelet transform is the representation of a function by wavelets. The wavelets are [[Scaling (geometry)|scaled]] and [[Translation (geometry)|translated]] copies (known as "daughter wavelets") of a finite-length or fast-decaying oscillating waveform (known as the "mother wavelet"). Wavelet transforms have advantages over traditional [[Fourier transform]]s for representing functions that have discontinuities and sharp peaks, and for accurately deconstructing and reconstructing finite, non-[[Periodic function|periodic]] and/or non-[[stationary process|stationary]] signals. Wavelet transforms are classified into [[discrete wavelet transform]]s (DWTs) and [[continuous wavelet transform]]s (CWTs). Note that both DWT and CWT are continuous-time (analog) transforms. They can be used to represent continuous-time (analog) signals. CWTs operate over every possible scale and translation whereas DWTs use a specific subset of scale and translation values or representation grid. There are a large number of wavelet transforms each suitable for different applications. For a full list see [[list of wavelet-related transforms]] but the common ones are listed below: * [[Continuous wavelet transform]] (CWT) * [[Discrete wavelet transform]] (DWT) * [[Fast wavelet transform]] (FWT) * [[Lifting scheme]] & [[Generalized lifting|Generalized Lifting Scheme]] * [[Wavelet packet decomposition]] (WPD) * [[Stationary wavelet transform]] (SWT) * [[Fractional wavelet transform]] (?) === Generalized transforms === There are a number of generalized transforms of which the wavelet transform is a special case. For example, Joseph Segman introduced scale into the [[Heisenberg group]], giving rise to a continuous transform space that is a function of time, scale, and frequency. The CWT is a two-dimensional slice through the resulting 3d time-scale-frequency volume. Another example of a generalized transform is the [[chirplet transform]] in which the CWT is also a two dimensional slice through the chirplet transform. An important application area for generalized transforms involves systems in which high frequency resolution is crucial. For example, [[darkfield microscope|darkfield]] electron optical transforms intermediate between direct and [[reciprocal space]] have been widely used in the [[harmonic analysis]] of atom clustering, i.e. in the study of [[crystal]]s and [[crystal defect]]s<ref>P.

Fractional wavelet transforms are based on scaling functions which, contrary to the "integer" wavelet transform, may have infinite support. Nonetheless, they allow non truncation of basis functions, exact treatment of boundaries, and perfect reconstruction.<ref>Michael Unser, Thierry Blu, "Fractional Splines and Wavelets", SIAM Review, Vol. 42, No. 1 (Mar., 2000), pp. 43-67, Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Stable URL: [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2653376 http://www.jstor.org/stable/2653376]</ref> == List of wavelets == === Discrete wavelets === * [[Beylkin]] (18) * [[BNC wavelets]] * [[Coiflet]] (6, 12, 18, 24, 30) * [[Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau wavelet]] (Sometimes referred to as CDF N/P or Daubechies biorthogonal wavelets) * [[Daubechies wavelet]] (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20) * [[Binomial-QMF]] (Also referred to as Daubechies wavelet) * [[Haar wavelet]] * [[Mathieu wavelet]] * [[Legendre wavelet]] * [[Villasenor wavelet]] * [[Symlet]] === Continuous wavelets === ==== Real-valued ==== * [[Beta wavelet]] * [[Hermitian wavelet]] * [[Hermitian hat wavelet]] * [[Mexican hat wavelet]] * [[Shannon wavelet]] ==== Complex-valued ==== * [[Complex mexican hat wavelet]] * [[Morlet wavelet]] * [[Shannon wavelet]] * [[Modified Morlet wavelet]] == See also == * [[Chirplet transform]] * [[Curvelet]] * [[Filter bank]]s * [[Fractal compression]] * [[Fractional Fourier transform]] * [[JPEG 2000]] * [[Multiresolution analysis]] * [[Noiselet]] * [[Scale space]] * [[Short-time Fourier transform]] * [[Ultra wideband]] radio- transmits wavelets * [[Wave packet]] * [[Gabor wavelet#Wavelet space]] * [[Dimension reduction]] * [[Fourier-related transforms]] ==Notes== <references/> == References == * Haar A., ''Zur Theorie der orthogonalen Funktionensysteme'', Mathematische Annalen, '''69''', pp 331–371, 1910. * [[Ingrid Daubechies]], ''Ten Lectures on Wavelets'', Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, 1992, ISBN 0-89871-274-2 * [[Ali Akansu]] and Richard Haddad, ''Multiresolution Signal Decomposition: Transforms, Subbands, Wavelets'', Academic Press, 1992, ISBN 0-12-047140-X * P.
