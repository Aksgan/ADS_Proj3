these claims, arguing that holding educators accountable for test results leads to the practice of "[[teaching to the test]]." Additionally, many argue that the focus on standardized testing encourages teachers to equip students with a narrow set of skills that enhance test performance without actually fostering a deeper understanding of subject matter or key principles within a knowledge domain.<ref>(nd) [http://www.fairtest.org/facts/whatwron.htm What's Wrong With Standardized Testing?] FairTest.org.

Opponents say that no student who has put in four years of [[seat time]] should be denied a high school diploma merely for repeatedly failing a test, or even for not knowing the required material.<ref>{{cite news |title=Reform education, not exit exams |work=Daily Bruin |author=Dang, Nick |date=18 March 2003 |quote=One common complaint from failed test-takers is that they weren't taught the tested material in school.

Why? Because it's working. It's telling students they need to learn more. We call that useful information. To the plaintiffs who are suing to stop the use of the test as a graduation requirement, it's something else: Evidence of unequal treatment... the exit exam was deemed unfair because too many students who failed the test had too few credentialed teachers. Well, maybe they did, but granting them a diploma when they lack the required knowledge only compounds the injustice by leaving them with a worthless piece of paper." |url=http://old.investors.com/editorial/editorialcontent.asp?secid=1501&status=article&id=155734&secure=3598}}</ref> High-stakes tests have been blamed for causing sickness and [[test anxiety]] in students and teachers, and for teachers choosing to narrow the curriculum towards what the teacher believes will be tested. In an exercise designed to make children comfortable about testing, a Spokane, Washington newspaper published a picture of a [[monster]] that feeds on fear.<ref>[http://www2.asd.wednet.edu/Pioneer/barnard/projects/04-05/art/WhatsaWASL/index.html ASD.wednet.edu]</ref> The published image is purportedly the response of a student who was asked to draw a picture of what she thought of the state assessment. Other critics, such as Washington State University's [[Don Orlich]], question the use of test items far beyond standard cognitive levels for students' age.<ref name="Bach, Deborah, & Blanchard, Jessica">Bach, Deborah, & Blanchard, Jessica (April 19, 2005).

[[Standardized test]]s (all students take the same test under the same conditions) often use multiple-choice tests for these reasons. Orlich criticizes the use of expensive, holistically graded tests, rather than inexpensive multiple-choice "bubble tests", to measure the quality of both the system and individuals for very large numbers of students.<ref name="Bach, Deborah, & Blanchard, Jessica"/> Other prominent critics of high-stakes testing include [[Fairtest]] and [[Alfie Kohn]]. The use of [[IQ tests]] has been banned in some states for educational decisions, and [[norm-referenced tests]], which rank students from "best" to "worst", have been criticized for bias against minorities. Most education officials support [[criterion-referenced tests]] (each individual student's score depends solely on whether he answered the questions correctly, regardless of whether his neighbors did better or worse) for making high-stakes decisions. ===21st century assessment=== It has been widely noted that with the emergence of [[social media]] and [[Web 2.0]] technologies and mindsets, learning is increasingly collaborative and knowledge increasingly distributed across many members of a learning community. Traditional assessment practices, however, focus in large part on the individual and fail to account for knowledge-building and learning in context. As researchers in the field of assessment consider the cultural shifts that arise from the emergence of a more [[participatory culture]], they will need to find new methods of applying assessments to learners.<ref name="Fadel, Charles, Honey, Margaret, & Pasnik, Shelley">Fadel, Charles, Honey, Margaret, & Pasnik, Shelley (May 18, 2007).

Students decide for themselves how to measure their progress as self-starting learners as a process of self-evaluation: real life-long learning and the proper educational assessment for the 21st century, they adduce.<ref>Greenberg, D.

However, they admit it makes the process more difficult, but that such hardship is part of the students learning to make their own way, set their own standards and meet their own goals. The no-grading and no-rating policy helps to create an atmosphere free of competition among students or battles for adult approval, and encourages a positive
