Adobe is developing again for iPhone and iPad CS5</ref> |} ===Third-party tools=== [[Open Source]] projects like [[Ajax framework|Ajax Animator]] and the (now defunct) [[UIRA]] aim to create a Flash development environment, complete with a graphical user environment. Alternatively, programs such as [[swfmill]], [[SWFTools]], and [[MTASC]] provide tools to create SWF files, but do so by compiling text, actionscript or XML files into [[Flash animation]]s. It is also possible to create SWF files programmatically using the [[Ming library]], which has interfaces for [[C (Programming Language)|C]], [[PHP]], [[C++]], [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]]. [[haXe]] is an open source, high-level object-oriented programming language geared towards web-content creation that can compile Flash files. Many [[shareware]] developers produced Flash creation tools and sold them for under US$50 between 2000 and 2002. In 2003 competition and the emergence of free Flash creation tools had driven many third-party Flash-creation tool-makers out of the market, allowing the remaining developers to raise their prices, although many of the products still cost less than US$100 and support ActionScript. As for open source tools, [[KToon]] can edit vectors and generate SWF, but its interface is very different from Macromedia's. Another, more recent example of a Flash creation tool is [[SWiSH Max]] made by an ex-employee of Macromedia. [[ToonBoom|Toon Boom]] Technologies also sells a traditional animation tool, based on Flash. In addition, several programs create [[.swf]]-compliant files as output from their programs. Among the most famous of these are [[Screencast]] tools, which leverage the ability to do lossless compression and playback of captured screen content in order to produce demos, tutorials, or software simulations of programs. These programs are typically designed for use by non-programmers, and create Flash content quickly and easily, but cannot actually edit the underlying Flash code (i.e. the tweening and transforms, etc.) [[Screencam]] is perhaps the oldest screencasting authoring tool to adopt Flash as the preferred output format, having been developed since the mid-90s. The fact that screencasting programs have adopted Flash as the preferred output is testament to Flash's presence as a ubiquitous cross-platform animation file format. Other tools are focused on creating specific types of Flash content. [[Anime Studio]] is a 2D animation software package specialized for character animation which creates SWF files. [[Express Animator]] is similarly aimed specifically at animators. [[Question Writer]] publishes its quizzes to Flash file format. Users who are not programmers or web designers will also find on-line tools that allow them to build full Flash-based websites. One of the oldest services available (1998) is [http://www.flashtogo.com/ FlashToGo]. Such companies provide a wide variety of pre-built models (templates) associated to a Content Management System that empowers users to easily build, edit and publish their websites. Other sites, that allows for greater customization and design flexibility are [[Wix.com]] and [[CirclePad]]. Adobe wrote a software package called [[Adobe LiveMotion]], designed to create interactive animation content and export it to a variety of formats, including SWF. LiveMotion went through two major releases, but failed to gain any notable user base. In February 2003, Macromedia purchased Presedia, which had developed a Flash authoring tool that automatically converted PowerPoint files into Flash. Macromedia subsequently released the new product as Breeze, which included many new enhancements. In addition, (as of version 2) [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[Keynote (software)|Keynote]] presentation software also allows users to create interactive presentations and export to SWF. {{anchor|Installed user base}} ==User experience== Flash as a format has become widespread on the desktop market; one estimate is that 95% of PCs have it,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://statowl.com/plugin_overview.php |title=Web Browser Plugin Market Share |accessdate=2009-08-18 |publisher=StatOwl}}</ref> while Adobe claims that 98 percent of U.S. web users and 99.3 percent of all Internet desktop users have installed the Flash Player,<ref>98%: [[NPD Group|NPD]] [http://www.macromedia.com/software/player_census/npd/ study]</ref><ref name="Flash Player Statistics">99.3%: Millward Brown survey, conducted June 2009. {{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/products/player_census/flashplayer/ |title=Flash Player Statistics |accessdate=2009-06-04 |author= |authorlink= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher=Adobe Systems |pages= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref><ref name="turfwar">{{cite journal |last=Shankland |first=Stephen |title=HTML vs. Flash: Can a turf war be avoided? |publisher=[[CNET News]] |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20000037-264.html |date=February 3, 2010 |accessdate=December 26, 2010 }}</ref> with 92 to 95% (depending on region) having the latest version.<ref name="versionpenetration">{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/products/player_census/flashplayer/version_penetration.html |title=Adobe Flash Player Version Penetration |accessdate=2009-06-04|author= |authorlink= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher=Adobe Systems |pages= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> Numbers vary depending on the detection scheme and research demographics. The Adobe Flash Player exists for a variety of systems and devices: Windows, [[Mac OS 9]]/[[Mac OS X|X]], [[Linux]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[HP-UX]], [[Pocket PC]]/[[Windows CE]], [[OS/2]], [[QNX]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Symbian]], [[Palm OS]], [[BeOS]], and [[IRIX]], although the performance is typically best on Windows (see [[#Performance|Performance]]). For compatibility with devices (embedded systems), see [[Macromedia Flash Lite]]. [[File:Noflash.png|thumb|Some websites rely on Flash so heavily that they are totally unusable without this plugin]] Among mobile devices, Flash has less penetration because Apple does not bundle or allow third-party runtimes on its iPhone, which accounts for more than 60% of global smartphone web traffic, or the iPod touch, which makes up more than 95% of "mobile Internet device" traffic. This hurts Adobe's ability to market Flash as a ubiquitous mobile platform. However, Flash is enabled on competing mobile platforms, including the version 2.2 [[Android (operating system)|Android]]<ref>{{cite web|author=Posted on Tuesday, Apr 27, 2010 by Phil Nickinson <!----> |url=http://www.androidcentral.com/andy-rubin-says-flash-coming-froyo-version-android-operating-system |title=Andy Rubin says Flash is coming in Froyo version of Android operating system |publisher=Androidcentral.com |date=2010-04-27 |accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref> while other O.S.s such as Symbian and Palm have versions coming.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} Downloading Flash is blocked in countries that are under U.S [[economic sanction|sanctions]] (such as Syria & Sudan).
