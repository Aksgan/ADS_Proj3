However, Google will pay all earned revenue greater than US$10 when an AdSense account is closed and not disabled. Many website owners complain that their AdSense accounts have been disabled just before they were supposed to receive their first paycheck from Google. Google claims accounts have been disabled due to click fraud or forbidden content, but have offered no proof of this. An automated email is sent to the publisher's owner which offers no reasoning, or options but a link to file an appeal. In the email, Google states that "Because we have a responsibility to protect our AdWords advertisers from inflated costs due to invalid activity, we've found it necessary to disable your AdSense account. Your outstanding balance and Google's share of the revenue will both be fully refunded back to the affected advertisers." The revenue generated - whether legitimate or not - is taken, and all complaints are deferred.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/answer.py?answer=57153 |title=Disabled Account FAQ - AdSense Help |date=2010-11-08}}</ref> Google came under fire when the official Google AdSense Blog showcased the French video website Imineo.com.

Schapire. [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.56.9855 "A Decision-Theoretic Generalization of on-Line Learning and an Application to Boosting"], 1995</ref>. It is a [[meta-algorithm]], and can be used in conjunction with many other learning algorithms to improve their performance. AdaBoost is adaptive in the sense that subsequent classifiers built are tweaked in favor of those instances misclassified by previous classifiers. AdaBoost is sensitive to noisy data and [[outlier]]s. However in some problems it can be less susceptible to the [[overfitting (machine learning)|overfitting]] problem than most learning algorithms. AdaBoost calls a [[Boosting|weak classifier]] repeatedly in a series of rounds <math> t = 1,\ldots,T</math>. For each call a distribution of weights <math>D_{t}</math> is updated that indicates the importance of examples in the data set for the classification. On each round, the weights of each incorrectly classified example are increased (or alternatively, the weights of each correctly classified example are decreased), so that the new classifier focuses more on those examples. == The algorithm
