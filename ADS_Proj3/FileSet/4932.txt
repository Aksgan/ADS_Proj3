them," complained Ebert. "They were used to going to movies, sure, and they'd seen some horror movies before, sure, but this was something else." According to Ebert, the film affected the audience immediately:<blockquote>''The kids in the audience were stunned. There was almost complete silence. The movie had stopped being delightfully scary about halfway through, and had become unexpectedly terrifying. There was a little girl across the aisle from me, maybe nine years old, who was sitting very still in her seat and crying.''<ref name="Ebertreview">Roger Ebert, review of ''Night of the Living Dead'', Chicago ''Sun-Times'', January 5, 196[9], at [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19670105/REVIEWS/701050301/1023 RogerEbert.com]; last accessed June 24, 2006.</ref></blockquote> Romero's reinvention of zombies is notable in terms of its thematics; he used zombies not just for their own sake, but as a vehicle "to criticize real-world social ills—such as government ineptitude, bioengineering, slavery, greed and exploitation—while indulging our post-apocalyptic fantasies".<ref>Liz Cole, ''Zombies'' http://www.greencine.com/static/primers/zombies1.jsp</ref> ''Night'' was the first of five films in the [[Living Dead#Romero's Dead series|''Living Dead'' series]]. Innately tied with the conception of the modern zombie is the "[[zombie apocalypse]]", the breakdown of society as a result of zombie infestation, portrayed in countless zombie-related media post-''Night''.<ref name="Paffenroth">Kim Paffenroth, ''Gospel of the Living Dead: George Romero's Visions of Hell on Earth''. Waco: Baylor University Press, 2006.</ref> Scholar Kim Paffrenroth notes that "more than any other monster, zombies are fully and literally apocalyptic ... they signal the end of the world as we have known it."<ref name="Paffenroth"/> ''Night'' made no reference to the creatures as "zombies". In the film, they are referred as "[[ghoul]]s" on the TV news reports. However, the word ''zombie'' is used continually by Romero in his 1978 script for ''[[Dawn of the Dead]]'',<ref>George A. Romero ''Dawn of the Dead'' (Working draft 1977) http://www.horrorlair.com/scripts/dawnofthedead.txt</ref> including once in dialog. This "retroactively fits (the creatures) with an invisible [[Haiti]]an/[[African]] prehistory, formally introducing the zombie as a new archetype".<ref>American Stranger, '' I Am Legend (Zombie Apocalypse part 1)'' http://amstranger.blogspot.com/2007/03/i-am-legend-zombie-apocalypse-part-1.html</ref> [[File:Night of the Living Dead.jpg|right|thumb|Movie poster for the 1968 film ''Night of the Living Dead'']] ''Dawn of the Dead'' was released under this title just months before the release of [[Lucio Fulci]]'s ''[[Zombi II]]'' (1979). Fulci's gory epic was filmed at the same time as Romero's ''Dawn'', despite the popular belief that it was made in order to cash in on the success of ''Dawn''. The only reference to ''Dawn'' was the title change to ''Zombi II'' (''Dawn'' generally went by ''Zombi'' or ''Zombie'' in other countries.)<ref>{{imdb title|id=0077402|title=Dawn of the Dead}}</ref> The early 1980s was notable for the introduction of zombies into [[Cinema of China|Chinese]] and other Asian films, often martial arts/horror crossover films, that featured zombies as thralls animated by magic for purposes of battle.<ref>{{imdb title|id=0199148|title=Wu long tian shi zhao ji gui}}</ref> Though the idea never had large enough appeal to become a sub-genre, zombies are still used as martial-arts villains in some films today.<ref>{{imdb title|id=0275773|title=Versus}}</ref> 1981's ''[[Hell of the Living Dead]]'' was the first film to reference a mutagenic gas as a source of zombie contagion, later echoed by Trioxin in [[Dan O'Bannon]]'s 1985 film, ''[[Return of the Living Dead]]''. ''RotLD'' took a more comedic approach than Romero's films; ''Return'' was the first film to feature zombies which hungered specifically for brains instead of all human flesh (this included the vocalization of "Brains!" as a part of zombie vocabulary), and is the source of the now-familiar cliché of brain-devouring zombies seen elsewhere. The mid-1980s produced few zombie films of note (the ''[[Evil Dead]]'' series, while highly influential and notable on their own, are not technically zombie films but films about [[demonic possession]]). 1985's ''[[Re-Animator]]'', loosely based on the Lovecraft story, stood out in the genre, achieving nearly unanimous critical acclaim,<ref>[[Rotten Tomatoes]] http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/reanimator/?critic=columns</ref> and becoming a modest success, nearly outstripping 1985's ''[[Day of the Dead]]'' for box office returns. Lovecraft's prescient depiction is notable here; the zombies in the film are consistent with other zombie films of the period, and it may escape the viewer that they are nearly unchanged from the 1921 story. The 1988 [[Wes Craven]] film ''[[The Serpent and the Rainbow (film)|The Serpent and the Rainbow]]'', based on the non-fiction book by [[Wade Davis]], attempted to re-connect the zombie genre with the [[Haitian Vodou|Haitian vodou]] ("voodoo") roots that inspired it. The film poses both supernatural and scientific possibilities for "zombification" and other aspects of [[Haitian Vodou|vodou]], though the scientific explanations for them, which involve use of the poison [[tetrodotoxin]], have been dismissed by the scientific community.<ref>Hines, Terence; "Zombies and Tetrodotoxin"; ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]''; May/June 2008; Volume 32, Issue 3; Pages 60-62.</ref> The film was relatively well-reviewed<ref>Roger Ebert, ''The Serpent And The Rainbow'', Feb. 1988 (film review) http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19880205/REVIEWS/802050302/1023</ref><ref>Rotten Tomatoes http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/serpent_and_the_rainbow/</ref> and enjoyed modest financial success,<ref>Internet Movie Database http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096071/business</ref> and is notable as perhaps the only vodou-themed zombie film of recent times. Also in 1988, the Romero zombies were featured in ''[[Waxwork (1988 film)|Waxwork]]'', where the protagonists are drawn to the world of ''Night of the Living Dead''. After the mid-1980s, the subgenre was mostly relegated to the underground. Notable entries include director [[Peter Jackson|Peter Jackson's]] ultra-gory film ''[[Braindead (1992 film)|Braindead]]'' (1992) (released as ''Dead Alive'' in the U.S.), [[Bob Balaban|Bob Balaban's]] comic 1993 film ''[[My Boyfriend's Back (film)|My Boyfriend's Back]]'' where a self-aware high school boy returns to profess his love for a girl and his love for human flesh, and Michele Soavi's ''[[Dellamorte Dellamore]]'' (1994) (released as ''Cemetery Man'' in the U.S.). Several years later, zombies experienced a renaissance in low-budget Asian cinema, with a sudden spate of dissimilar entries including ''[[Bio Zombie]]'' (1998), ''[[Wild Zero]]'' (1999), ''[[Junk (film)|Junk]]'' (1999), ''[[Versus (film)|Versus]]'' (2000) and ''[[Stacy (film)|Stacy]]'' (2001). In Disney's 1993 film ''[[Hocus Pocus (film)|Hocus Pocus]]'', a "good zombie", Billy Butcherson played by [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]], was introduced, giving yet a new kind of zombie in an intelligent, gentle, kind, and heroic being.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thedougjonesexperience.com/hocuspocus~prosthetics.htm |title=The Creation of Billy Butcherson |accessdate=6 December 2008 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=The Doug Jones Experience}}</ref> The turn of the millennium coincided with a decade of box office successes
