services to the main server. Each client consumes the services via its own mailbox called "exchange" and well-published message formats. The communication works on "request codes" that are owned by the service. The operating system maintains the exchanges, message queues, scheduling, control, message passing, etc., while the service manages the messages at its own exchange using "wait", "check", and "respond" macros. CTOS ran on [[Intel]] [[X86]] computers, and could run concurrently with [[Windows NT]]. The system API was presented to both high-level languages and assembly language. ===Programs=== The assembler was very advanced, with a [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]-like pattern-matching macro facility unmatched by almost any other assembler before or since. There was an always-resident debugger. Most of the system programs were written in [[PL/M]], an [[ALGOL]]-like language from [[Intel]] which compiled directly to [[object code]] without a [[runtime library]]. The [[word processor]] was one of the first screen-oriented editors with many high-powered features, such as multiple views of the same file, cut/copy/paste, unlimited undo/redo, no typing lost after a crash or power failure, user-selectable fonts, and much more. The spreadsheet allowed blocks of cells to be protected from editing or other user input. The BTOS version allowed scripts to be written that included opening the spreadsheet for user input, then automatically printing graphs based on the input data. The system shell was extensible, making it possible to define new commands. To get the parameters, the system would display the form which was to be filled out by the user. The input form had conventions for mandatory and optional input fields, which made it very easy to train new users. ==Usage== [[Convergent Technologies (Unisys)|Convergent Technologies]]' first product was the IWS (Integrated Workstation) based on the [[Intel 8086]] processor, which had CTOS as its operating system. This was a modular operating system with built in [[local area networking]]. CTOS supported multiple processes or threads, and message-based interprocess communication. Companies that licensed CTOS included [[Groupe Bull|Bull]] (STARSYS), and [[Burroughs Corporation|Burroughs]] (BTOS) and who later merged with Sperry to become [[Unisys]]. Unisys was the single largest customer with whom Convergent Technologies merged to become one company in 1988. At its peak, CTOS had over 800,000 users worldwide. Diskless workstations (e.g., ''Bull'') used the [[Intel 80186]] processor, a processor seldom used by standard PCs. [[Progress Software Corporation]] made a commercial database application for CTOS that was in [[4GL]]. The [[United States Coast Guard]] used these databases for logistics administration for their vessels. There was a port of [[CorelDRAW]] for CTOS running the [[Presentation Manager]]. CTOS is no longer marketed to new customers; former major customers included police forces, banks, airlines, the [[U.S. Postal Service]], the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]], the [[U.S. Army]] and the [[United States Coast Guard]]. The Coast Guard used the operating system from approximately 1986 until 2000. ==References== * {{cite book | first = Edna Ilyin | last = Miller | coauthors= Jim Crook, June Loy | title = Exploring CTOS | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]] | year = 1991 | isbn = 0132973421 }} ==External links== *[http://www.ctosfaq.com/CtosFaqOct1999.htm The CTOS FAQ October 1999] *[http://www.byte.com/art/9412/sec13/art2.htm CTOS Revealed, Byte, December 1994] *[http://www.angelfire.com/ga/paulmooney/ctos.html Paul Mooney's CTOS Central] *[http://www.ctosfaq.com/CTOSPictures.htm The CTOS FAQ Picture Archive] *[http://www.softwarepreservation.org/meetings/2006/2006-05-17/CTOS_Intro_2006_05_17.pdf Exhuming CTOS: The Convergent Technologies Project, Nadia Ilyin] *[http://bitsavers.org/pdf/convergent Convergent archive] at bitsavers.org {{FOLDOC}} [[Category:Proprietary operating systems]] [[Category:Unisys operating systems]] [[de:CTOS]] [[fr:Convergent Technologies Operating System]]</text> </page> <page> <id>8083</id> <title>Conversational Programming System</title> <text>{{Unreferenced stub|auto=yes|date=December 2009}} {{Orphan|date=December 2009}} '''Conversational Programming System''' or '''CPS''' was an early [[Time-sharing]] system offered by [[IBM]] which ran on [[System/360]] [[mainframe computer|mainframes]] ''circa'' 1967 through 1972. '''CPS''' was implemented as an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]], and users could select either a rudimentary form of [[BASIC]] or a reasonably complete version of [[PL/I]]. A third option provided [[Remote Job Entry|remote job entry]] (RJE) features allowing users to submit [[Job Control Language|JCL]] [[JOB Stream]]s for batch processing. A fourth option was called control mode. Normally, only the system operator would be permitted to use control mode. The available features in control mode included: *Send a message to an individual user or all users. *Clobber (today it would be called re-boot) a specific user's virtual '''CPS''' machine. *Monitor the activity of an individual user. *Terminate the entire '''CPS''' system. '''CPS''' provided a highly interactive user experience. It accomplished this by giving an immediate [[syntax error]] (when necessary) as soon as each line of a program was entered. Early versions of '''CPS''' were designed to run on the [[IBM 2741]] terminal. Later support was added for the [[IBM 2260]] terminal. '''CPS''' was ultimately superseded by [[Time Sharing Option|TSO]]. Some installations ported '''CPS''' so that it could run as a command-invoked subsystem under TSO.

This article explains how to convert between the two representations. Actually this simple use of "quaternions" was first presented by [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] some seventy years earlier than [[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]] to solve the problem of [[magic square]]s. For this reason the dynamics community commonly refers to quaternions in this application as "Euler parameters". ==Definition== A unit [[quaternion]] can be described as: :<math>\mathbf{q} = \begin{bmatrix} q_0 & q_1 & q_2 & q_3 \end{bmatrix}^T</math> :<math>|\mathbf{q}|^2 = q_0^2 + q_1^2 + q_2^2 + q_3^2 = 1</math> We can associate a [[quaternion]] with a rotation around an axis by the following expression :<math>\mathbf{q}_0 = \cos(\alpha/2)</math> :<math>\mathbf{q}_1 = \sin(\alpha/2)\cos(\beta_x)</math> :<math>\mathbf{q}_2 = \sin(\alpha/2)\cos(\beta_y)</math> :<math>\mathbf{q}_3 = \sin(\alpha/2)\cos(\beta_z)</math> where α is a simple rotation angle (the value in radians of the [[angle of rotation]]) and cos(β<sub>''x''</sub>), cos(β<sub>''y''</sub>) and cos(β<sub>''z''</sub>) are the "[[Unit vector|direction cosines]]" locating the axis of rotation (Euler's Theorem). == Rotation matrices == [[Image:Eulerangles.svg|right|thumb|300px|Euler angles - The xyz (fixed) system is shown in blue, the XYZ (rotated) system is shown in red.
