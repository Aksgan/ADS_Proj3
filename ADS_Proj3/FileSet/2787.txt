Artem Pavlenko, the original developer of Mapnik, set out with the explicit goal of creating beautiful maps<ref name=beautmaps>[http://www.mapnik.org/faq/ Beautiful Maps as an explicit goal in the Mapnik FAQ]</ref> by employing the subpixel anti-aliasing of the [[Anti-Grain Geometry]] (AGG) library. Mapnik now also has a powerful [[Cairo (graphics)|Cairo]] rendering backend. When it comes to handling common software tasks such as memory management, filesystem access, regular expressions, and XML parsing, Mapnik utilizes the [[Boost C++ Libraries]]. ==Data Format== A number of data formats are supported in Mapnik using a plugin framework. Current plugins exist that utilize [[GDAL|OGR]] and [[GDAL]] to read a range of vector and raster datasets. Mapnik also has custom [[Shapefile]], [[PostGIS]] and [[GeoTIFF]] readers. More data access plug-ins will be available in the future. There is also an osm2pgsql utility<ref name=osm2pgsql>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osm2pgsql|title=Osm2pgsql}}</ref>, that converts [[OpenStreetMap]] data into a format that can be loaded into [[PostgreSQL]]. Mapnik can then be used to render the OSM data into maps with the appearance you want. ==Platforms== Mapnik is a cross platform toolkit that runs on Windows, Mac, [[Unix-like]] systems like Linux and Solaris (since release 0.4). ==Usage== Mapnik is used as the rendering backend of [[OpenStreetMap]]'s default layer<ref>{{cite web|title=Mapnik|url=http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapnik|publisher=OpenStreetMap Wiki}}</ref>, but is also used by [[CloudMade]]<ref>{{cite web|title=CloudMade|url=http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/CloudMade#Technical|publisher=OpenStreetMap Wiki}}</ref>, and [[MapQuest]]<ref>{{cite web|title=MapQuest Mapnik Style|url=https://github.com/MapQuest/MapQuest-Mapnik-Style|publisher=GitHub}}</ref>. ==License== Mapnik is free software and is released under [[LGPL]] (Lesser General Public Licence). ==References== <references/> == External links == * [http://www.mapnik.org/ Project page] * [http://trac.mapnik.org/wiki Mapnik wiki page] [[Category:Collaborative mapping]] [[Category:Distributed computing projects]] <!-- tiles@home component --> [[Category:Web mapping]] [[Category:Web Map Services]] [[Category:Cartography]] [[Category:Free websites]] [[Category:Geographic information systems]]</text> </page> <page> <id>23421</id> <title>Marabunta</title> <text>{{otheruses}} {{primarysources|date=August 2009}} {{Expert-subject|Software/Free Software|date=February 2009}} {{ infobox software | name = Marabunta | logo = [[File:LogoMarabunta.png|40px]] | screenshot = [[Image:MarabuntaGui.v.030.png|200px]] | caption = Marabunta version 0.3 running under Linux | developer = Marabunta developers | latest release version = 0.3.2 | latest release date = {{release date|2006|03|31}} | operating system = [[Cross-platform]] | genre = [[Anonymous P2P]] | license = [[GNU General Public License]] | website = http://marabunta.laotracara.com/english.php }} '''Marabunta''' is a fully distributed [[software]] application for [[anonymous P2P]]. The main goal is the fight against internet [[censorship]] and assuring the [[freedom of speech]]. It is a [[peer-to-peer]] platform for information exchange among nodes in an [[Anonymity|anonymous]] way based on several communication algorithms called "Order and Chaos" which can be found in massive social organizations such as [[Ant colony|ant colonies]]. The project was founded at the [[University of Zaragoza]], [[Spain]], developed and promoted by students of computing engineering although development teams and users from many different places have shown interest, perhaps attracted by the ideological aims of the project. The [[software]] is available only in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], but the website is also available in [[English language|English]]. Marabunta uses the [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]] graphical [[widget toolkit]], allowing it to be used on both [[Linux]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. Released under the [[GNU General Public License]], Marabunta is [[free software]]. == Purpose == Marabunta is an implementation of the ideas explained in the "''Free Nets project '''[http://apeiron.laotracara.com APEIRON (only in Spanish)]'''''" and it has been developed with these ideas in mind: * Avoiding [[censure]]: Communication between people avoiding central servers is allowed. So it is free from censure attacks, which are commonly launched from many governments and corporations that want to control the communications. * [[Anonymity]]: A degree of anonymous communication is made possible, such that information can be accessed without knowledge of its original source. * Motives and development: Marabunta is the first project of this kind developed in Spain. Still, the software has potential use by people anywhere in the world, especially in countries with little or no freedom of speech. == Features == There are many potential services that can be run on top of Marabunta. Text message interchange is the first service. It could be taken as a platform for [[telegram]] distribution, where each [[computer]] in the net works as a host and as a [[Server (computing)|server]]. * As a host: Messages are sent, active nodes are sought, etc. * As a server: Text messages and requests to increase the connectivity between nodes are [[Routing|routed]] to the network using a [[Broadcasting (networks)|broadcast]] forwarding method. There are four message distribution lists, so receivers only receive messages sent to the list they are interested in: General, [[Technology]], [[Philosophy]], and [[Politics]]. Content filters are allowed so only messages with certain patterns are displayed. This is specially useful when searching for some specific information because Marabunta just selects potentially interesting messages. === Connections === All generated traffic uses the [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]]/[[Internet Protocol|IP]] [[Protocol (computing)|protocols]]. Avoiding setting up connections between nodes lets more traffic flow in the network and the operational redundancy of every node can be used. Moreover, the UDP protocol could be seen as increasing the anonymity in the net because there is no need to validate source hosts to receive a [[datagram]]. ==== Port-forwarding on NATs ==== Marabunta does not yet support [[UDP hole punching]], and users behind [[Network address translation|NATs]] have to establish a [[port forwarding]] route to let the router know to which port and node of the internal net it should forward the arriving datagrams. ==References== {{reflist}} == External links == * [http://marabunta.laotracara.com/english.php Marabunta home page] (software in Spanish only) [[Category:Free file sharing software]] [[Category:Anonymity networks]] [[Category:Anonymous file sharing networks]] [[es:Marabunta (informática)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>23444</id> <title>Marcus Hutter</title> <text>'''Marcus Hutter''' (born 1967) is a German computer scientist and professor at the [[Australian National University]]. Hutter was born and educated in [[Munich]], where he studied [[physics]] and [[computer science]]. In 2000 he joined [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s group at the Swiss [[Artificial Intelligence]] lab [[IDSIA]], where he developed the first mathematical theory of optimal Universal Artificial Intelligence, based on [[Kolmogorov complexity]] and [[Ray Solomonoff]]'s theory of universal [[inductive inference]]. In 2006 he also accepted a professorship at the Australian National University in [[Canberra]]. Hutter's notion of universal AI describes the optimal strategy of an agent that wants to maximize its future expected reward in some unknown dynamic environment, up to some fixed future horizon.
