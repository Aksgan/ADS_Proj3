lower extremity muscular activity during level walking'', Journal of Orthopaedic Science 2003(8):55-61</ref> One of the main advantages of using PET is that it can also provide muscle activation data about deeper lying muscles such as the vastus intermedialis and the gluteus minimus, as compared to other muscle studying techniques like [[Electromyography]], which can only be used on superficial muscles (i.e. directly under the skin). A clear disadvantage, however, is that PET provides no timing information about muscle activation, because it has to be measured after the exercise is completed. This is due to the time it takes for FDG to accumulate in the activated muscles. == Safety == PET scanning is non-invasive, but it does involve exposure to [[ionizing radiation]]. The total dose of radiation is not insignificant, usually around 5–7 m[[Sievert|Sv]]. However, in modern practice, a combined PET/CT scan is almost always performed, and for PET/CT scanning, the radiation exposure may be substantial - around 23-26 mSv (for a 70 kg person - dose is likely to be higher for higher body weights).<ref>G.

The term comes from the [[Latin]] ''post scriptum'', an expression meaning "written after"<ref Name="Sullivan">{{cite book | last =Sullivan | first =Robert Joseph | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =A dictionary of the English language | publisher = | year =1877 | location =Original from Oxford University | pages = 509 and 317 | url =http://books.google.com/books?id=d24CAAAAQAAJ&pg=PT37&dq=postscript+dictionary+post+scriptum+Latin&lr=&as_brr=1&client=firefox-a#PPT37,M1 | doi = | id = }}</ref><ref Name="Tanner">{{cite book | last =Tanner | first =William Maddux | authorlink =cool | coauthors = | title =Composition and Rhetoric | publisher =Ginn & Co | year =1922 | location =Original from the University of California | pages = xxvii | url =http://books.google.com/books?id=ydREAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PR27&dq=postscript+dictionary+post+scriptum+Latin&lr=&as_brr=1&client=firefox-a | doi = | id = | nopp =true }}</ref> (which may be interpreted in the sense of "that which comes after the writing"). A postscript may be a sentence, a paragraph, or occasionally many paragraphs added, often hastily and incidentally, after the signature of a letter or (sometimes) the main body of an essay or book. In a book or essay, a more carefully-composed addition (e.g., for a second edition) is called an [[afterword]]. An afterword, not usually called a postscript, is written in response to critical remarks on the first edition. The word "postscript" has, poetically, been used to refer to any sort of addendum to some main work, even if not attached to a main work, as in [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s book titled ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript]].'' Sometimes, when additional points are made after the first postscript, abbreviations such as PPS (post-post-scriptum, or postquam-post-scriptum) and PPPS (post-post-post-scriptum, and so on, ''[[ad infinitum]]'') are used, though only PPS has
