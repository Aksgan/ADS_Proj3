Colossus was the world's first totally ''electronic'' programmable computing device. The Colossus used a large number of valves (vacuum tubes). It had paper-tape input and was capable of being configured to perform a variety of [[boolean logic]]al operations on its data, but it was not [[Turing-complete]]. Nine Mk II Colossi were built (The Mk I was converted to a Mk II making ten machines in total). Details of their existence, design, and use were kept secret well into the 1970s. [[Winston Churchill]] personally issued an order for their destruction into pieces no larger than a man's hand, which was to ensure the fact the British were capable of cracking Lorenz was kept secret during the oncoming cold war. Due to this secrecy, the Colossi were not included in many histories of computing. A reconstructed copy of one of the Colossus machines is now on display at Bletchley Park. ===American developments=== In 1937, [[Claude Shannon]] showed there is a [[one-to-one correspondence]] between the concepts of [[Boolean logic]] and certain electrical circuits, now called [[logic gate]]s, which are now ubiquitous in digital computers.<ref>[[Claude Shannon]], "[[A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits]]", ''Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers'', Vol. '''57''',(1938), pp. 713–723</ref> In his master's thesis<ref>{{harvnb|Shannon|1940}}</ref> at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], for the first time in history, Shannon showed that electronic relays and switches can realize the [[expression (mathematics)|expression]]s of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]]. Entitled ''[[A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits]]'', Shannon's thesis essentially founded practical [[digital circuit]] design. George Stibitz completed a relay-based computer he dubbed the "Model K" at [[Bell Labs]] in November 1937. Bell Labs authorized a full research program in late 1938 with Stibitz at the helm. Their ''[[Complex Number Calculator]]'',<ref> [[George Stibitz]], {{Ref patent |country=US |number=2668661|status=patent|title=Complex Computer|gdate=1954-02-09 |assign1 =[[AT&T]]}}, 102 pages.</ref> completed January 8, 1940, was able to calculate [[complex numbers]]. In a demonstration to the [[American Mathematical Society]] conference at [[Dartmouth College]] on September 11, 1940, Stibitz was able to send the Complex Number Calculator remote commands over telephone lines by a [[teletype]]. It was the first computing machine ever used remotely, in this case over a phone line. Some participants in the conference who witnessed the demonstration were [[John von Neumann]], John Mauchly, and [[Norbert Wiener]], who wrote about it in their memoirs. [[File:Atanasoff-Berry Computer at Durhum Center.jpg|thumb|[[Atanasoff–Berry Computer]] replica at 1st floor of Durham Center, [[Iowa State University]] ]] In 1939, John Vincent Atanasoff and Clifford E. Berry of Iowa State University developed the [[Atanasoff–Berry Computer]] (ABC),<ref>January 15, 1941 notice in the ''Des Moines Register''.</ref> The Atanasoff-Berry Computer was the world's first electronic digital computer.<ref>The First Electronic Computer By Arthur W. Burks</ref> The design used over 300 vacuum tubes and employed capacitors fixed in a mechanically rotating drum for memory. Though the ABC machine was not programmable, it was the first to use electronic tubes in an adder. ENIAC co-inventor John Mauchly examined the ABC in June 1941, and its influence on the design of the later ENIAC machine is a matter of contention among computer historians. The ABC was largely forgotten until it became the focus of the lawsuit ''[[Honeywell v. Sperry Rand]]'', the ruling of which invalidated the ENIAC patent (and several others) as, among many reasons, having been anticipated by Atanasoff's work. In 1939, development began at IBM's Endicott laboratories on the [[Harvard Mark I]]. Known officially as the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator,<ref>{{harvnb|Da Cruz|2008}}</ref> the Mark I was a general purpose electro-mechanical computer built with IBM financing and with assistance from IBM personnel, under the direction of Harvard mathematician Howard Aiken. Its design was influenced by Babbage's Analytical Engine, using decimal arithmetic and storage wheels and rotary switches in addition to electromagnetic relays. It was programmable via punched paper tape, and contained several calculation units working in parallel. Later versions contained several paper tape readers and the machine could switch between readers based on a condition. Nevertheless, the machine was not quite Turing-complete. The Mark I was moved to [[Harvard University]] and began operation in May 1944. ====ENIAC==== {{Main|ENIAC}} [[File:Eniac.jpg|thumb|[[ENIAC]] performed ballistics trajectory calculations with 160 kW of power]] The US-built ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was the first electronic general-purpose computer. It combined, for the first time, the high speed of electronics with the ability to be programmed for many complex problems. It could add or subtract 5000 times a second, a thousand times faster than any other machine. (Colossus couldn't add). It also had modules to multiply, divide, and square root. High speed memory was limited to 20 words (about 80 bytes). Built under the direction of [[John Mauchly]] and [[J. Presper Eckert]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], ENIAC's development and construction lasted from 1943 to full operation at the end of 1945. The machine was huge, weighing 30 tons, and contained over 18,000 vacuum tubes. One of the major engineering feats was to minimize tube burnout, which was a common problem at that time. The machine was in almost constant use for the next ten years. ENIAC was unambiguously a Turing-complete device. It could compute any problem (that would fit in memory). A "program" on the ENIAC, however, was defined by the states of its patch cables and switches, a far cry from the [[stored program]] electronic machines that evolved from it. Once a program was written, it had to be mechanically set into the machine. [[ENIAC#Programming|Six women did most of the programming of ENIAC.]] (Improvements completed in 1948 made it possible to execute stored programs set in function table memory, which made programming less a "one-off" effort, and more systematic). ===Early computer characteristics=== {{Early computer characteristics}} ==First-generation machines== {{See|List of vacuum tube computers}} [[File:von Neumann architecture.svg|right|thumb|Design of the [[von Neumann architecture]] (1947)]] Even before the ENIAC was finished, Eckert and Mauchly recognized its limitations and started the design of a stored-program computer, EDVAC. [[John von Neumann]] was credited with a [[First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC|widely circulated report]] describing the [[EDVAC]] design in which both the programs and working data
