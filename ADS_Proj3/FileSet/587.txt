Its actions model indivisible communications between exactly two participants. The formal language includes primitives for describing parallel composition, choice between actions and scope restriction. CCS is useful for evaluating the qualitative correctness of properties of a system such as [[deadlock]] or [[livelock]].<ref>{{cite book |editor1-first=Ulrich |editor1-last=Herzog |title=Formal Methods for Performance Evaluation |accessdate=2009-04-21 |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |volume=4486 |year=2007 |month=May |publisher=Springer |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-72522-0 |pages=318&ndash;370 |chapter=Tackling Large State Spaces in Performance Modelling |chapterurl=http://aesop.doc.ic.ac.uk/pubs/large-state-spaces/ }}</ref> According to Milner, "There is nothing canonical about the choice of the basic combinators, even though they were chosen with great attention to economy. What characterises our calculus is not the exact choice of combinators, but rather the choice of interpretation and of mathematical framework". The expressions of the language are interpreted as a [[state transition system|labelled transition system]]. Between these models, [[bisimilarity]] is used as a semantic equivalence. ==Syntax== Given a set of action names, the set of CCS processes is defined by the following [[BNF grammar]]: :<math>P ::= \emptyset\,\,\, | \,\,\,a.P_1\,\,\, | \,\,\,A\,\,\, | \,\,\,P_1+P_2\,\,\, | \,\,\,P_1|P_2\,\,\, | \,\,\,P_1[b/a]\,\,\, | \,\,\,P_1{\backslash}a\,\,\,</math> The parts of the syntax are, in the order given above ; empty process : the empty process <math>\emptyset</math> is a valid CCS process ; action : the process <math>a.P_1</math> can perform an action <math>a</math> and continue as the process <math>P_1</math> ; process identifier : write <math>A \overset{\underset{\mathrm{def}}{}}{=} P_1</math> to use the identifier <math>A</math> to refer to the process <math>P_1</math> ; choice : the process <math>P_1+P_2</math> can proceed either as the process <math>P_1</math> or the process <math>P_2</math> ; parallel composition : <math>P_1|P_2</math> tells that processes <math>P_1</math> and <math>P_2</math> exist simultaneously ; renaming : <math>P_1[b/a]</math> is the process <math>P_1</math> with all actions named <math>a</math> renamed as <math>b</math> ; restriction : <math>P_1{\backslash}a</math> is the process <math>P_1</math> without action <math>a</math> ==Related calculi and models== * [[Communicating Sequential Processes]] (CSP), developed by [[Tony Hoare]], is a language that arose at a similar time to CCS. * The [[Pi-calculus|<math>\pi</math>-calculus]], developed by Milner in the late 80's, provides mobility of communication links by allowing processes to communicate the names of communication channels themselves. * [[PEPA]], developed by [[Jane Hillston]] introduces activity timing and probabilistic choice, allowing performance metrics to be evaluated. Some other languages based on CCS: * [[Calculus of Broadcasting Systems]] * [[Language Of Temporal Ordering Specification]] (LOTOS) Models that have been used in the study of CCS-like systems: * [[History monoid]] * [[Actor model]] ==References== * Robin Milner: ''A Calculus of Communicating Systems'', Springer Verlag, ISBN 0-387-10235-3. 1980. * Robin Milner, ''Communication and Concurrency'', Prentice Hall, International Series in Computer Science, ISBN 0-131-15007-3. 1989 {{Reflist}} [[Category:Process calculi]] {{comp-sci-stub}} [[ca:CCS]] [[es:Cálculo de sistemas comunicantes]] [[ru:Исчисление общающихся систем]]</text> </page> <page> <id>5348</id> <title>Calendaring software</title> <text>'''Calendaring software''' is [[software]] that minimally provides users with an electronic version of a '''calendar'''. Additionally, the software may provide an appointment book, address book, and/or contact list. These tools are an extension of many of the features provided by time management software such as desk accessory packages and computer office automation systems. The software may be a local package designed for individual use (e.g. Lightning extension for [[Mozilla Thunderbird]], [[Microsoft Outlook]] without Exchange Server, or [[Windows Calendar]]) or may be a networked package that allows for the sharing of information between users (e.g. [[Mozilla Sunbird]], [[Windows Live Calendar]], [[Google Calendar]], or [[Microsoft Outlook]] with Exchange Server). ==Features== Calendaring software will contain one or more of the following features: * '''Calendar''' – a [[calendar]] showing dates and days of the week. An example a simple software calendar is the [[Unix]] [[cal (Unix)|cal]] command, which simply outputs a monthly or yearly calendar. * '''[[Address book]]''' – a list of contacts with information to enable the user to communicate with the contacts. * '''[[Appointment attachments]]''' – This feature allow users to attached a file to an appointment. If the appointment includes other participants, the attachment is shared with them. * '''[[Appointment calendar]]''' – a list of appointments and the attendees for the appointments. This software may include the capability of detecting scheduling conflicts, notifying the participants of the conflict, and suggesting alternate meeting times. * '''[[Appointment reminder]]s''' – Automatically reminds participants of an upcoming meeting. * '''Availability sharing''' – this feature allows users to share their availability with others (users can select how much detail is shared); thus facilitating meeting scheduling amongst several individuals. * '''[[Calendar publishing]]''' – some calendaring tools allow the user to publish select calendar information on a public link. * '''[[Calendar exporting]]''' – Users are allowed to export selected calendars into varies file formats, including [[iCalendar]] standard. * '''Collaborative scheduling''' – the capability of the software to check schedules and propose meeting times to all of the participants. This allows the invitees to suggest times that will work best for them, allowing the organizer to pick a meeting time that works best for all of the participants. * '''[[Customization]]''' – This feature allow users to customize several available features such as: email appointment remainders, calendar viewing default, workweek and work hours display, etc. * '''[[E-mail]]''' – an electronic mail communication system. This can be tied into the appointment calendar to send reminders and notify the participants of issues arising with scheduled meetings. *
