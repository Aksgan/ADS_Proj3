He from time to time strongly upbraided the Prince for showing tendencies towards the idle pleasure-seeking dilettantism of his predecessor as Prince of Wales, [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]], later known as the Duke of Windsor, whom Mountbatten had known well in their youth. Yet he also encouraged the Prince to enjoy the bachelor life while he could and then to marry a young and inexperienced girl so as to ensure a stable married life.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Junor| first = Penny| title = The Firm: the troubled life of the House of Windsor| url =http://books.google.com/?id=e_f6-ZPQuKAC&pg=PA72&lpg=PA72&dq=%22sow+his+wild+oats+and+have+as+many+affairs+as+he+can%22|accessdate = 2007-05-13| year = 2005| publisher = Thomas Dunne Books| location = New York| isbn =9780312352745| oclc = 59360110|page = 72|chapter = The Duty of an Heir}}</ref> Mountbatten's qualification for offering advice to this particular heir to the throne was unique; it was he who had arranged the visit of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth to [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Dartmouth Royal Naval College]] on 22 July 1939, taking care to include the young Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret in the invitation, but assigning his nephew, [[Cadet]] Prince Philip of Greece, to keep them amused while their parents toured the facility.

Within days, Philip received a command from his cousin and sovereign, King [[George II of Greece]], to resume his naval career in Britain which, though given without explanation, the young prince obeyed.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Vickers|first=Hugo|title=Alice, Princess Andrew of Greece|publisher=Hamish Hamilton|location=London|year=2000|isbn=0-241-13686-5|page=281}} </ref> In 1974 Mountbatten began corresponding with Charles about a potential marriage to his granddaughter, Hon.

Prince Philip thought that the Indian public's reception would more likely reflect response to the uncle than to the nephew. [[John Knatchbull, 7th Baron Brabourne|Lord Brabourne]] counselled that the intense scrutiny of the press would be more likely to drive Mountbatten's godson and granddaughter apart than together.<ref name=JD/> Charles was re-scheduled to tour India alone, but Mountbatten did not live to the planned date of departure. When Charles finally did propose marriage to Amanda, later in 1979, the circumstances were tragically changed, and she refused him.<ref name=JD/> ==Television appearance== On 27 April 1977, shortly before his 77th birthday, Mountbatten became the first member of the Royal Family to appear on the TV guest show [[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]].<ref>[http://www.eofftv.com/t/thi/this_is_your_life_1969_main.htm]</ref> ==Assassination== Mountbatten usually holidayed at his summer home in [[Mullaghmore, County Sligo|Mullaghmore]], [[County Sligo]], a small seaside village between [[Bundoran]], [[County Donegal]] and [[Sligo]], County Sligo, on the northwest coast of [[Ireland]]. Bundoran was a popular holiday destination for IRA [[Volunteer (Irish republican)|volunteers]], many of whom may have been aware of Mountbatten's presence and movements in Mullaghmore.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Despite security advice and warnings from the [[Garda Síochána]], on 27 August 1979, Mountbatten went lobster-potting and tuna fishing in a thirty-foot (10 m) wooden boat, the ''Shadow V'', which had been moored in the harbour at Mullaghmore. An IRA member named [[Thomas McMahon (IRA)|Thomas McMahon]] had slipped on to the unguarded boat that night and attached a radio-controlled fifty-pound (23 kg) bomb. When Mountbatten was on the boat en route to [[Donegal Bay]], an unknown person detonated the bomb from shore. McMahon had been arrested earlier at a Garda checkpoint between [[Longford]] and [[Granard]]. Mountbatten, then aged 79, was seriously wounded and died soon after the blast by drowning while unconscious in the bay. Others killed in the blast were [[Nicholas Knatchbull]], his elder daughter's 14-year-old son; Paul Maxwell, a 15-year-old youth from [[County Fermanagh]] who was working as a crew member; and [[Doreen Knatchbull, Baroness Brabourne|Baroness Brabourne]], his elder daughter's 83-year-old mother-in-law who was seriously injured in the explosion, and died from her injuries the following day.<ref>Patton, Allyson, "Broadlands: Lord Mountbatten's Country Home," ''British Heritage'' March
