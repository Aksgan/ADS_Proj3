also [[theoretical semiotics]] as a basis for [[theoretical biology]]. The ISBS assures the organization of regular meetings on research into the semiotics of nature, as well as promotes publication of scholarly work on the semiotics of life processes. The ISBS organizes the annual international conferences (''Gatherings in Biosemiotics'') that were started by Copenhagen and Tartu biosemioticians and have taken place regularly already since 2001.<ref>[[Claus Emmeche|Emmeche, Claus]] 2001.

It developed from the [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs]]. ==History== Students have been invited as participants in Pugwash Conferences since the early 1970s. Following interest to create a forum specifically for students, student/young Pugwash groups started to form in the late 70s, [[Student Pugwash USA]] doing so in 1979. International collaboration among the groups began in 1988 in the [[Netherlands]] for the first jointly organized IS/YP conference. Student pre-conferences to the annual Pugwash Conferences began at the 1997 Pugwash Conference held in [[Norway]]. ==Organization== ISYP's members comprise national groups, which themselves may comprise loose or formal collections of [[school]] or [[university]] chapters. National entities include [[Student Pugwash USA]] (SPUSA), the largest, and Student Pugwash UK (SPUK) among others. ==External links== * [http://www.student-pugwash.org International Student/Young Pugwash] * [http://student.pugwash.no/ Norway Student Pugwash] * [http://user.it.uu.se/~pugwash/ Student Pugwash Sweden] * [http://www.spusa.org Student Pugwash USA] * [http://young-pugwash.org.uk/ Student/Young Pugwash UK] {{DEFAULTSORT:Pugwash, International}} [[Category:International nongovernmental organizations]] [[Category:International relations education]] [[Category:International conferences]] [[Category:International security]] [[Category:Student political organizations]] [[Category:Youth organizations]] [[Category:Technology in society]] [[Category:Ethics of science and technology]]</text> </page> <page> <id>19059</id> <title>International Symposium on Distributed Computing</title> <text>{{Infobox Academic Conference | history = 1985– | discipline = [[Distributed computing]] | abbreviation = DISC | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science|LNCS]] | country = International | frequency = annual (since 1989) }} The '''International Symposium on Distributed Computing''' ('''DISC''') is an annual [[academic conference]] for refereed presentations, whose focus is the theory, design, analysis, implementation, and application of distributed systems and networks. The Symposium is organized in association with the [[European Association for Theoretical Computer Science]] (EATCS). The [[Edsger W.
