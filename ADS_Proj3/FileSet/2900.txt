card manufacturers developed such designs on their own. Consequently customers were not provided many advanced capabilities to justify the purchase of comparatively more expensive MCA systems and opted for the plurality of cheaper ISA designs offered by IBM's competition. IBM used MCA for all but the lowest end machines, as did [[NCR Corporation|NCR]], but other manufacturers such as [[Apricot Computers|Apricot]], [[Dell]], [[Tandy Corporation|Tandy]], [[RM plc|Research Machines]] and [[Olivetti]] who adopted it used it for only part of their PC range. IBM had patents on MCA system features and required MCA system manufacturers to pay a licence fee. As a reaction to this, in late 1988 the "[[Gang of Nine]]", led by [[Compaq]], announced a rival bus - [[Extended Industry Standard Architecture|EISA]]. Offering similar performance benefits, it had the advantage of being able to accept older [[XT bus architecture|XT]] and [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] boards. While [[Extended Industry Standard Architecture|EISA]] and MCA battled it out in the server arena, the desktop PC largely stayed with [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] up until the arrival of [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]], although the [[VESA Local Bus]], an acknowledged stopgap, was briefly popular. The failure of MCA adoption, and the broader industry support for [[Extended Industry Standard Architecture|EISA]], was made very clear when IBM themselves produced some EISA bus servers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-306.ibm.com/common/ssi/fcgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=an&subtype=ca&appname=redbooks&htmlfid=897/ENUS196-134 |title=IBM PC Server 520 -- New 166MHz SMP Models and Feature Enhancements |publisher=IBM |date=June 18, 1996 |accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref> MCA disappeared within a few years after the introduction of the [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] bus, which had much wider industry support. Intel's establishment of a PCI Special Interest Group (PCI SIG) among card manufacturers and system developers encouraged the development of the PCI market and standardized the technical implementation of PCI. == See also == * [[Industry Standard Architecture]] (ISA) * [[Extended Industry Standard Architecture]] (EISA) * [[NuBus]] * [[VESA Local Bus]] (VESA) * [[Peripheral Component Interconnect]] (PCI) * [[Accelerated Graphics Port]] (AGP) * [[PCI Express]] (PCIe) * [[List of device bandwidths]] ==References== {{reflist}} == External links == * [http://www.mcamafia.de/ MCA Enthusiasts Page] * [http://pinouts.ru/Slots/mca_32bit_pinout.shtml MCA connector pinout and signals] * [http://members.datafast.net.au/dft0802/mca.htm Craig Hart's freeware MCA card IDs list] {{Computer-bus}} [[Category:Computer buses]] [[Category:IBM personal computers]] [[bs:MCA]] [[de:Micro Channel Architecture]] [[es:Bus MCA]] [[fr:Micro Channel Architecture]] [[hr:Micro Channel Architecture]] [[id:Bus MCA]] [[ja:Micro Channel Architecture]] [[pl:MCA]] [[pt:Micro Channel architecture]] [[ru:Micro Channel Architecture]] [[fi:MCA]] [[sv:Micro Channel Architecture]]</text> </page> <page> <id>24407</id> <title>Microdose</title> <text>{{Notability|date=November 2007}} {{Orphan|date=February 2009}} '''Microdose''' refers to a category of [[Medical_imaging|radiology modalities]] providing a very low [[R%C3%B6ntgen|radiation dose]]. These modalities are typically based on a photon-counting detector for capturing the image. ==Photon-counting Detector== A photon-counting detector utilizes the discrete nature of [[X-rays]], as it counts individual [[photon]]s when they are captured in a detector medium. This is in contrast to “pseudo-digital” detectors that [[Integral|integrates]] photon energy over time, thus in practice measuring an [[analog signal]] that in turn is [[Analog-to-digital_converter|digitized]]. While the conversion steps from analog to digital signal in a traditional detector introduces [[thermal noise]], [[Quantization_error|quantization errors]] and loss of information during signal processing, a truly digital detector suffers from none of these weaknesses. A photon-counting detector is capable of capturing close to all information in the signal. This way it is possible to lower the radiation dose to a minimum while preserving or even improving image quality. ==Uses== There are today very few commercially available Microdose modalities. The first to hit the market was a [[mammography]] system from Medical imaging supplier [[Sectra]], mainly targeted for intense breast [[screening]] programs. Breast examinations is one of the most demanding with respect to image quality, as early detection of cancerous changes relies on finding [[Dystrophic_calcification|micro-calcifications]] in the breast tissue. These tiny structures can be perceived by a trained eye, but only as far as the image quality allows. At the same time, the significance of low dose comes particularly apparent in screening programs, as a large part of a population is targeted. The Sectra system uses [[silicon]] as detector medium, where a large array of very thin silicon sticks constitutes the [[pixel]]s in the photon-counting detector. Another mammography system under development by [[XCounter]] uses [[noble gas]] contained in thin glass tubes as detector medium. ==References== * M. Lundqvist, B. Cederström,V. Chmill, M.

These mechanisms include low-level [[address space]] management, [[thread (computer science)|thread]] management, and [[inter-process communication]](I.P.C). As an operating system design approach, microkernels permit typical operating system services, such as [[device driver]]s, [[protocol stack]]s, [[file system]]s and [[user interface]] code, to run in [[user space]]. If the hardware provides multiple [[Hierarchical protection domains|rings]] or [[CPU modes]], the microkernel is the only software executing at the most privileged level (generally referred to as [[kernel mode|supervisor or kernel mode]]). Microkernels are closely related to [[exokernel]]s.<ref name="Liedtke_96">{{cite journal | last = Liedtke | first = Jochen | month = September | year = 1996 | title = Towards Real Microkernels | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume =
