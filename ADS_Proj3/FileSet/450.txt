be freely distributed and modified. Currently, BIND includes a data specification, a database and associated data mining and visualization tools. Eventually, it is hoped that BIND will be a collection of all the interactions occurring in each of the major model organisms. ===Database structure=== BIND contains information on three types of data: interactions, molecular complexes and pathways. # Interactions are the basic component of BIND and describe how 2 or more objects (A and B) interact with each other. The objects can be a variety of things: [[DNA]], [[RNA]], [[genes]], [[proteins]], [[ligands]], or [[photons]]. The interaction entry contains the most amount of information about a molecule; it provides information on its name and synonyms, where it is found (e.g. where in the cell, what species, when it is active, etc.), and its sequence or where its sequence can be found. The interaction entry also outlines the experimental conditions required to observe binding in vitro, chemical dynamics (including [[thermodynamics]] and [[kinetics]]). # The second type of BIND entries are the molecular complexes. Molecular complexes are defined as an aggregate of molecules that are stable a have a function when bound to each other. The record may also contain some information on the role of the complex in various interactions and the molecular complex entry links data from 2 or more interaction records. # The third component of BIND is the pathway record section. A pathway consists of a network of interactions that are involved in the regulation of cellular processes. This section may also contain information on phenotypes and diseases related to the pathway. <br />The minimum amount of information needed to create an entry in BIND is a [[PubMed]] publication reference and an entry in another database (e.g. [[GenBank]]). Each entry withiin the database provides references/authors for the data. As BIND is a constantly growing database, all components of BIND track updates and changes.<ref name= "BIND, 2001">Bader, GD, ''et al.'' BIND- The Biomolecular Interaction Network Database. ''Nucleic Acids Research'' 29: 242-245 (2001).</ref> BIND is based on a data specification written using Abstract Syntax Notation 1 ([[ASN.1]]) language. ASN.1 is used also by [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|NCBI]] when storing data for their [[Entrez]] system and because of this BIND uses the same standards as NCBI for data representation. The ASN.1 language is preferred because it can be easily translated into other data specification languages (e.g. [[XML]]), can easily handle complex data and can be applied to all biological interactions â€“ not just proteins. <ref name= "BIND, 2001"/>. Bader and Hogue (2000) have prepared a detailed manuscript on the ASN.1 data specification used by BIND.<ref name= "BIND, 2000">Bader, GD, Hogue, CWV. BIND- a data specification for storing and describing biomolecular interactions, molecular complexes and pathways. ''Bioinformatics'' 16(5): 465-477 (2000).</ref> ===Data submission and curation=== User submission to the database is encouraged. To contribute to the database, one must submit: contact info, [[PubMed]] identifier and the two molecules that interact. The person who submits a record is the owner of it. All records are validated before being made public and BIND is curated for quality assurance. BIND curation has two tracks: high-throughput (HTP) and low-throughput (LTP). HTP records are from papers which have reported more than 40 interaction results from one experimental methodology. HTP curators typically have a [[bioinformatics]] backgrounds. The HTP curators are responsible for the collection of storage of experimental data and they also create scripts to update BIND based on new publications. LTP records are curated by individuals with either an MSc or PhD and laboratory experience in interaction research. LTP curators are given further training through the [[Canadian Bioinformatics Workshops]]. Information on [[small molecule]] chemistry is curated separately by chemists to ensure the curator is knowledgeable about the subject. The priority for BIND curation is to focus on LTP to collect information as it is published. Although, HTP studies provide more information at once, there are more LTP studies being reported and similar numbers of interactions are being reported by both tracks. In 2004, BIND collected data from 110 journals.<ref name= "2005 update">Alfarano, C, ''et al.'' The Biomolecular Interaction Network Database and related tools 2005 update. ''Nucleic Acids Research'' 33: D418-D424 (2005). </ref> ===Database growth=== BIND has grown significantly since its conception; in fact, the database saw a 10 fold increase in entries between 2003 and 2004. By September 2004, there were over 100,000 interaction records by 2004 (including 58,266 protein-protein, 4,225 genetic, 874 protein-small molecule, 25,857 protein-DNA, and 19,348 biopolymer interactions). The database also contains sequence information for 31,972 proteins, 4560 DNA samples and 759 RNA samples. These entries have been collected from 11,649 publications; therefore, the database represents an important amalgamation of data. The organisms with entries in the database include: ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', ''[[Mus musculus]]'', ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'', ''[[Bos taurus]]'', [[HIV-1]], ''[[Gallus gallus]]'', ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'', as well as others. In total, 901 [[taxa]] were included by September 2004 and BIND has been split up into BIND-Metazoa, BIND-Fungi, and BIND-Taxroot.<ref name= "2005 update"/> Not only is the information contained within the database continually updated, the software itself has gone through several revisions. Version 1.0 of BIND was released in 1999 and based on user feedback it was modified to include additional detail on experimental conditions required for binding and a hierarchical description of cellular location of the interaction. Version 2.0 was released in 2001 and included the capability to link to information available in other databases.<ref name= "BIND, 2001"/> Version 3.0 (2002) expanded the database from physical/biochemical interactions to also include genetic interactions.<ref name= "BIND, 2003">Bader, GD, ''et al.''. BIND: the Biomolecular Interaction Network Database. ''Nucleic Acids Research'' 31: 248-250 (2003).</ref> Version 3.5 (2004) included a refined user-interface that aimed to simplify information retrieval.<ref name= "2005 update"/> In 2006, BIND was incorporated into the Biomolecular Object Network Database (BOND) where it continues to be updated and improved. ===Special features=== BIND was the first database of its kind to contain info on biomolecular interactions, reactions and pathways in one schema.
