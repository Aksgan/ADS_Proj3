Introduced by [[Peter Mandelson|Peter Mandelson, Lord Mandelson]], it received [[Royal Assent]] on 8 April 2010, and came into force on 8 June 2010 (with the exception of certain sections that came into force on 8 April; and certain other sections that will be brought into force by [[statutory instrument]]).<ref name="dea_sec47">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/47?view=plain|title=Digital Economy Act, section 16: Commencement|publisher=[[UK Government]]|accessdate=July 15, 2010}}</ref> On 10 November 2010 the [[High Court of Justice]] granted permission for a [[Judicial review in English law|judicial review]] of Section 3 to 18 of the Act. == Contents == === Online infringement of copyright === ==== Section 3 to 16 ==== The Act's provisions against the act of [[copyright infringement]] proved controversial.<ref name="guardian_dea">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/digital-economy-bill|title=Digital Economy Bill on The Guardian|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=July 2, 2010 | location=London}}</ref> It establishes a system of law which aims to first increase the ease of tracking down and suing persistent infringers, and after a minimum of one year permit the introduction of "technical measures" to reduce the quality of, or potentially terminate, those infringers' Internet connections. It also creates a new ex-[[judicial]] process to handle appeals.<ref name="dea_sec10" /> The new process, which will come into force when [[Ofcom]]'s regulatory code is approved by Parliament, begins with [[rightsholder]]s gathering lists of [[Internet Protocol]] addresses which they believe have infringed their copyrights. (This data could be gathered most easily by a rightsholder connecting to a [[Peer-to-Peer]] download of a work they own, and noting the other IP addresses to which their computer connects.) They would then send each IP number to the appropriate [[Internet Service Provider]] (newly-defined in the Act as a provider of IP addresses<ref name="dea_sec16">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/16?view=plain|title=Digital Economy Act, section 16: Interpretation and consequential provision|publisher=[[UK Government]]|accessdate=July 15, 2010}}</ref>) along with a "copyright infringement report". The ISP must then send a notification to the subscriber in question. The conditions under which this is required (i.e. the standard of evidence required) are not specified in the Act, but left to [[#Ofcom's code|Ofcom's regulatory code]]. The report and its recipient is noted by the ISP, if valid, but no further action is taken.<ref name="dea_sec3">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/3?view=plain|title=Digital Economy Act, section 3: Obligation to notify subscribers of reported infringements|publisher=[[UK Government]]|accessdate=July 2, 2010}}</ref> The next stage in proceedings involves the rightsholder requesting a "copyright infringement list" from the ISP. This contains an anonymous list of all subscribers who have "reached the threshold set in the [Ofcom] code" with regard to infringement reports for their works.<ref name="dea_sec4">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/4?view=plain|title=Digital Economy Act, section 4: Obligation to provide infringement lists to copyright owners|publisher=[[UK Government]]|accessdate=July 2, 2010}}</ref> The rightsholder can then approach a judge to gain a [[court order]] to identify some or all of the subscribers on the list, and with that information launch standard copyright infringement litigation against them.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} ===== Ofcom's code ===== Most operational details of the copyright infringement provisions are not defined in the Act, but left to a series of regulatory codes produced by [[Ofcom]]. The Act defines only the utmost limits within which these codes can work. On May 28, 2010 Ofcom published a draft initial obligations code for consultation.<ref>[http://www.Ofcom.org.uk/consult/condocs/copyright-infringement/ a consultation draft of their initial obligations code]</ref> According to the Act Ofcom must produce "progress reports" once every three months on the levels of copyright infringement in the country, with a larger report coming once every 12 months.<ref name="dea_sec8">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/8?view=plain|title=Digital Economy Act, section 8: Progress reports|publisher=[[UK Government]]|accessdate=July 2, 2010}}</ref> ===== Technical measures ===== After [[#Ofcom's code|Ofcom's code]] has been in force for one year, the [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]]<!-- which one? could be business or media! --> becomes able to lay down an order for ISPs to impose "technical measures" on subscribers who meet the copyright infringement report threshold (see above). These measures may limit Internet access in any way, including suspending it entirely. Unlike other areas of the Act Ofcom do not produce a code that defines what the measures are (though they are responsible for enforcing them): instead the Secretary of State decides all specifics, needing only to "take into account" Ofcom's recommendations.<ref name="dea_sec10" /> ===== Appeals ===== The Act requires the provision of an independent [[appeal]]s process, covering the grounds on which infringement reports are made. Cases are heard by a body set up by [[Ofcom]], or if a technical measure has been applied a [[First-tier Tribunal]].<ref name="dea_sec13">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/13|title=Digital Economy Act, section 13: Subscriber appeals|publisher=[[UK Government]]|accessdate=July 2, 2010}}</ref> Unlike in judicial appeals, the subscriber is [[innocent until proven guilty]]: the Act states that "an appeal on any grounds must be determined in favour of the subscriber unless the copyright owner or internet service provider shows that a) the apparent infringement was an infringement of copyright, and b) the report relates to the subscriber’s IP
