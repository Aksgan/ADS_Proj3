clients, and one for backhaul.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The "1+1" appellation indicates that these radios are separate - the radio providing service does not participate in the backhaul, and the radio participating in the backhaul does not service clients. These two radios can operate in different bands. For example, a 2.4 GHz [[IEEE 802.11|802.11]] b/g radio can be used for service and an 802.11a (5 [[GHz]]) radio can be used for backhaul. Most mesh products available today fall into this category.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Separating service from backhaul improves performance when compared with single-radio ad hoc mesh networks. But since a single-radio mesh is still servicing the backhaul, packets traveling toward the Internet share bandwidth at each hop along the backhaul path with other interfering mesh backhaul nodes - all-operating on the same channel. This degrades throughput as shown in Figure 3, which are not as severe as for the single-radio mesh, but which are sizeable nevertheless. Second generation mesh products are best employed in 1 or 2 hop configurations. ===2 radio backhauls=== The last configuration shown (Figure 2) is one that provides separate backhaul and service functionality and dynamically manages channels of all of the radios so that all radios are on non-interfering channels. Performance analysis indicates that this provides the better performance than the other two methods considered here.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Note that the two backhaul radios for the 3-radio configuration shown in Figure 2 are of the same type - not to be confused with 1+1 so-called dual radio meshes where one radio is typically of type 802.11 a (backhaul) and the other of type 802.11 b/g (service). In the 3-radio configuration, 2 radios provide up link and down link backhaul functionality, and the other radio services clients. Figure 4 shows how the two backhaul radios transmit traffic, with both radios operating independently and on separate channels. == Examples == ===Border security=== The [[Naval Postgraduate School]], Monterey CA, demonstrated a third configuration multi-radio wireless mesh network for border security.<ref>{{ citepaper|title=OPTIMUM ANTENNA CONFIGURATION FOR MAXIMIZING ACCESS POINT RANGE OF AN IEEE 802.11 WIRELESS MESH NETWORK IN SUPPORT OF MULTIMISSION OPERATIONS RELATIVE TO HASTILY FORMED SCALABLE DEPLOYMENTS|url=http://theses.nps.navy.mil/07Sep_Lounsbury.pdf|format=PDF|author=Robert Lee Lounsbury, Jr.|accessdate=2008-02-23}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In a 2007 pilot system, aerial cameras kept aloft by balloons relayed real time high resolution video to ground personnel via a mesh network. ===Laptop computers=== A [[MIT Media Lab]] project developed the [[XO-1 (laptop)|XO-1]] single-radio laptop or "OLPC" for under-privileged schools in developing nations and uses mesh networking (based on the [[IEEE 802.11s]] standard) to create a robust and inexpensive infrastructure.<ref>{{ citeweb|title=XO-1 Mesh Network Details|url=http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Mesh_Network_Details|publisher=laptop.org|accessdate=2008-02-23}}</ref> The instantaneous connections made by the laptops are claimed by the project to reduce the need for an external infrastructure such as the Internet to reach all areas, because a connected node could share the connection with nodes nearby.

For example [[Firetide]] and Wave Relay second configuration dual radio mesh networks have the option to communicate node to node on 5.2 GHz or 5.8 GHz, but communicate node to client on 2.4 GHz (802.11). This is accomplished using [[Software Defined Radio]] (SDR). == See also == * [[Mesh networking]] * [[Wireless mesh network]] * [[Wireless community network]] * [[Mobile ad hoc network]] * [[List of ad hoc routing protocols]] * [[Software Defined Radio]] == External links == <!-- Only links to sites that provide actual information about mesh networking.

The result of the hit-or-miss transform is the set of positions, where the first structuring element fits in the foreground of the input image, and the second structuring element misses it completely. == Mathematical definition == In binary morphology, an image is viewed as a [[subset]] of an [[Euclidean space]] <math>\mathbb{R}^d</math> or the integer grid <math>\mathbb{Z}^d</math>, for some dimension ''d''. Let us denote this space or grid by ''E''. A structuring element is a simple, pre-defined shape, represented as a binary image, used to probe another binary image, in morphological operations such as [[erosion (morphology)|erosion]], [[dilation (morphology)|dilation]], [[opening (morphology)|opening]], and [[closing (morphology)|closing]]. Let <math>C</math> and <math>D</math> be two structuring elements satisfying <math>C\cap D=\emptyset</math>. The pair (''C'',''D'') is sometimes called ''composite structuring element''. The hit-or-miss transform of a given image ''A'' by ''B''=(''C'',''D'') is given by: ::<math>A\odot B=(A\ominus C)\cap(A^c\ominus D)</math>, where <math>A^c</math> is the [[set complement]] of ''A''. That is, a point ''x'' in ''E'' belongs to the hit-or-miss transform output if ''C'' translated to ''x'' fits in ''A'', and ''D'' translated to ''x'' misses ''A'' (fits the background of ''A''). == Some applications == ===Thinning=== Let <math>E=Z^2</math>, and consider the eight composite structuring elements, composed by: :<math>C_1=\{(0,0),(-1,-1),(0,-1),(1,-1)\}</math> and <math>D_1=\{(-1,1),(0,1),(1,1)\}</math> :<math>C_2=\{(-1,0),(0,0),(-1,-1),(0,-1),\}</math>
