correlated familial pedigrees from participants around the world. After reaching their 100,000 sample goal, SMGF modified their goals to focus less on collecting new samples and more on analysis of previous samples.<ref>http://www.smgf.org/get_involved.jspx</ref> New participants are still accepted through SMGF's subsidiary, [[GeneTree]]. Also, previous SMGF participants can buy their DNA report through GeneTree.com.<ref>[http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20100428005716&newsLang=en Business Wire article]</ref> Another one of the goals of SMGF is to advance research in the scientific field of molecular genealogy. SMGF conducts research to identify additional DNA markers which link an individual to their genealogical family, however direct or distant. SMGF researchers have published a number of [http://www.smgf.org/publications.jspx research papers], many of which involve collaborations with other researchers. DNA collection for the project initially involved drawing blood samples; since August 2002, the SMGF has used a mouthwash-based collection method (GenetiRinse), which has the advantage that it can be mailed to participants living in remote areas. == References == {{Reflist}} ==External links== '''Official sites''' *[http://www.smgf.org Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation] *[http://www.genetree.com GeneTree] '''News articles''' *[http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2010/07/22/4913663.htm Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation Offers Free Ancestry Website], TMCnet.com, 2010-07-22. *[http://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/2007-07-01-sorenson_N.htm Goal for DNA Research?

For the sorting to be unique, these two are restricted to a [[total order]] and a strict total order, respectively. Sorting [[n-tuple]]s (depending on context also called e.g. [[Object composition|record]]s consisting of fields) can be done based on one or more of its components. More generally objects can be sorted based on a property. Such a component or property is called a '''sort key'''. For example, the items are books, the sort key is the title, subject or author, and the order is alphabetical. A new sort key can be created from two or more sort keys by [[lexicographical order]]. The first is then called the '''primary sort key''', the second the '''secondary sort key''', etc. For example, addresses could be sorted using the city as primary sort key, and the street as secondary sort key. If the sort key values are [[total order|totally ordered]], the sort key defines a {{ml|strict weak ordering|Total preorders|weak order}} of the items: items with the same sort key are equivalent with respect to sorting. See also {{ml|Sorting_algorithm|Stability|stable sorting}}. If different items have different sort key values then this defines a unique order of the items. A standard order is often called ''ascending'' (corresponding to the fact that the standard order of numbers is ascending, i.e. A to Z, 0 to 9), the reverse order ''descending'' (Z to A, 9 to 0). In [[computer science]], sorting is one of the most extensively researched subjects because of the need to speed up the operation on thousands or millions of records during a search operation; ''see [[sorting algorithm]].'' The main purpose of sorting information is to optimise its usefulness for specific tasks. In general, there are two ways of grouping information: '''by category''' e.g. a shopping catalogue where items are compiled together under headings such as 'home', 'sport & leisure', 'women's clothes' etc. ([[Sampling (statistics)#Nominal and ordinal scales|nominal scale]]) and '''by the intensity''' of some property, such as price, e.g. from the cheapest to most expensive (ordinal scale). [[Richard Saul Wurman]], in his book ''Information Anxiety'', proposes that the most common sorting purposes are '''Name''', by '''Location''' and by '''Time''' (these are actually special cases of category and hierarchy). Together these give the acronym LATCH (Location, Alphabetical, Time, Category, Hierarchy) and can be used to describe just about every type of ordered information. Often information is sorted using different methods at different levels of abstraction: e.g. the UK telephone directories which are sorted by location, by category (business or residential) and then alphabetically. New media still subscribe to these basic sorting methods: e.g. a Google search returns a list of web pages in a hierarchical list based on its own scoring system for how closely they match the search criteria (from closest match downwards). The opposite of sorting, rearranging a sequence of items in a random or meaningless order, is called [[shuffling]]. ==Physical sorting processes== Various sorting tasks are essential in industrial processes. For example, during the extraction of [[gold]] from ore, a device called a [[shaker table]] uses [[gravity]], [[oscillation|vibration]], and flow to separate gold from lighter materials in the ore (sorting by size and weight). Sorting is also a naturally occurring process that results in the concentration of [[ore]] or [[Sorting (sediment)|sediment]]. Sorting results from the application of some criterion or differential stressor to a mass to separate it into its components based on some variable quality. Materials that are different, but only slightly so, such as the isotopes of uranium, are very difficult to separate. ==See also== * [[Collation]] * [[Sorting algorithm]] * [[Unicode collation algorithm]] * [[Organizing]] ==External links== * [http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~harrison/Java/sorting-demo.html Demonstration of Sorting Algorithms] (includes bubble and quicksort) * [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxENKlcs2Tw Animated video] explaining bubble sort and quick sort and compares their performance.
