It is developed by RobotGroup. It is based on a robust kernel that is [[FreeRTOS]] and that is completely [[open source]]. This system can plug in the [[Arduino]]'s IDE (development environment). == Changelog == * 0.1.0 Alpha / 2009.11.02 - Arduino IDE updated to version 0017 (?) <br /> - FreeRTOS updated to version 5.4.2 <br /> - Add example MoreComplexBlinking (Blinks two LEDs) <br /> * 0.2.0 Alpha / 2010.06.30 - Arduino IDE updated to version 0018 <br /> - FreeRTOS updated to version 6.0.5 <br /> - Add new example MoreComplexBlinkingAndSound (Blinks two LEDs and play sound) <br /> == See also == * [[Arduino]] * [[FreeRTOS]] * [[List of real-time operating systems]] == External links == * (en) [http://www.multiplo.org/duinos/wiki DuinOS official website] * (en) [http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1256745982 Arduino English Forum discussion thread] * (en) [http://code.google.com/p/duinos/ Duinos Source code repository at Google code] * (en) [http://www.freertos.org FreeRTOS.org] * (es) [http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/RobotGroup RobotGroup] {{Real-time operating systems}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Duinos}} [[Category:Real-time operating systems]] [[Category:Embedded operating systems]] [[Category:Free software operating systems]] [[Category:Microkernel-based operating systems]] {{operating-system-stub}} [[es:DuinOS]] [[fr:DuinOS]]</text> </page> <page> <id>11184</id> <title>Dunia Engine</title> <text>{{Infobox Software | name = Dunia Engine | logo = | screenshot = | caption = | developer = [[Ubisoft Montreal]] | latest_release_version = | latest_release_date = | latest_preview_version = | latest_preview_date = | operating_system = | genre = [[Game engine]] | license = | website = http://www.ubi.com/ }} The '''Dunia Engine''' is a game engine, based on [[CryEngine]], but heavily modified by the [[Ubisoft]] Montréal development team for ''[[Far Cry 2]]''.<ref>http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=nl&u=http://tweakers.net/nieuws/50850/ubisoft-licht-tipje-van-de-sluier-over-far-cry-2-op.html&sa=X&oi=translate&resnum=1&ct=result&prev=/search%3Fq%3Dhttp://tweakers.net/nieuws/50850%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26hs%3DxUy</ref> A heavily modified version of the Dunia Engine is used for ''[[James Cameron's Avatar: The Game]]''.

In [[radar]] and radio communications systems, it isolates the [[receiver (radio)|receiver]] from the [[transmitter]] while permitting them to share a common [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]]. Most [[radio repeater]] systems include a duplexer. ''Note 1:'' A duplexer must be designed for operation in the [[frequency]] [[band (radio)|band]] used by the receiver and transmitter, and must be capable of handling the [[output]] [[Power (physics)|power]] of the transmitter. ''Note 2:'' A duplexer must provide adequate rejection of transmitter [[noise]] occurring at the receive frequency, and must be designed to operate at, or less than, the frequency separation between the transmitter and receiver. ''Note 3:'' A duplexer must provide sufficient isolation to prevent receiver desensitization.

Dust-Off products are used to remove dust, debris, fingerprints, and smudges from hard to reach areas of keyboards, screens, and other components of electronic equipment. The Dust-Off brand also encompasses a line of electronics and home office cleaning supplies, including LCD/Plasma screen sprays, microfiber cleaning cloths, and the Dust-Off Screen Shammy. Dust-Off is manufactured by [[Falcon Safety Products]]. The compressed gas duster product has also gained attention as it has been abused as an [[inhalant]] by teenagers, as seen in the movie ''[[Thirteen (film)|Thirteen]]''. A warning email has been circulated by Jeff Williams, a police officer in [[Cleveland]], whose son, Kyle, died after inhaling Dust-Off in [[Painesville]] Township, [[Ohio]]. <ref>{{cite web | url = http://news-herald.com/articles/2007/03/22/top%20stories/18111657.txt | title = Riverside High School continues to grieve | accessdate = 2006-06-10 | publisher = The News-Herald}} </ref> Falcon has now added a [[bitterant]] to the product to deter inhalation.

It can be summoned by phone call or [[SMS]], and uses [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] to automatically make its way to the customer, collect the rubbish, and take it to a dustbin. In addition, the Dustbots carry environmental sensors to monitor the pollution levels over, for example, a pedestrian area. Prototypes have
