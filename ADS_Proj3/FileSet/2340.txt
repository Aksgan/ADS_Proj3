on the [[EDVAC]] project, von Neumann wrote an incomplete ''[[First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC]]''. The paper, which was widely distributed, described a [[computer]] architecture in which the data and the program are both stored in the computer's memory in the same address space. This architecture is to this day the basis of modern computer design, unlike the earliest computers that were 'programmed' by altering the electronic circuitry. Although the single-memory, stored program architecture is commonly called [[von Neumann architecture]] as a result of von Neumann's paper, the architecture's description was based on the work of [[J. Presper Eckert]] and [[John William Mauchly]], inventors of the [[ENIAC]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].<ref>The mistaken name for the architecture is discussed in [http://www.library.upenn.edu/exhibits/rbm/mauchly/jwm9.html John W. Mauchly and the Development of the ENIAC Computer], part of the online [http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~museum/ ENIAC museum], in Robert Slater's computer history book, ''Portraits in Silicon'', and in Nancy Stern's book ''From ENIAC to UNIVAC''.</ref> Von Neumann also created the field of [[cellular automaton|cellular automata]] without the aid of computers, constructing the first [[self-replication|self-replicating]] automata with pencil and graph paper. The concept of a [[Von Neumann universal constructor|universal constructor]] was fleshed out in his posthumous work ''Theory of Self Reproducing Automata''.<ref name=TSRA>{{Cite book|year=1966|author=John von Neumann|editor=[[Arthur W. Burks]]|title=Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata|publisher=Univ. of Illinois Press|place=Urbana and London|.}} [http://www.history-computer.com/Library/VonNeumann1.pdf PDF reprint]</ref> Von Neumann proved that the most effective way of performing large-scale mining operations such as mining an entire [[natural satellite|moon]] or [[asteroid belt]] would be by using self-replicating machines, taking advantage of their [[exponential growth]]. He is credited with at least one contribution to the study of algorithms. [[Donald Knuth]] cites von Neumann as the inventor, in 1945, of the [[merge sort]] algorithm, in which the first and second halves of an array are each sorted recursively and then merged together.<ref>{{ cite book | last=Knuth | first=Donald | authorlink=Donald Knuth | year=1998 | title=The Art of Computer Programming: Volume 3 Sorting and Searching | pages=159 | isbn=0-201-89685-0 | publisher=Addison-Wesley | location=Boston }}</ref> His algorithm for simulating a [[fair coin]] with a biased coin<ref>{{ cite journal | last=von Neumann | first=John | year=1951 | title=Various techniques used in connection with random digits | journal=National Bureau of Standards Applied Math Series | volume=12 | pages=36 }}</ref> is used in the "software whitening" stage of some [[hardware random number generator]]s. He also engaged in exploration of problems in numerical [[hydrodynamics]]. With [[R. D. Richtmyer]] he developed an algorithm defining ''artificial viscosity'' that improved the understanding of [[shock wave]]s. It is possible that we would not understand much of astrophysics, and might not have highly developed jet and rocket engines without that work. The problem was that when computers solve hydrodynamic or aerodynamic problems, they try to put too many computational grid points at regions of sharp discontinuity ([[shock wave]]s). The ''artificial viscosity'' was a mathematical trick to slightly smooth the shock transition without sacrificing basic physics. ==Politics and social affairs == Von Neumann obtained at the age of 29 one of the first five professorships at the new [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] (another had gone to [[Albert Einstein]]). He was a frequent consultant for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], the [[United States Army]], the [[RAND Corporation]], [[Standard Oil]], [[IBM]], and others. Throughout his life von Neumann had a respect and admiration for business and government leaders; something which was often at variance with the inclinations of his scientific colleagues. He enjoyed associating with persons in positions of power, and this led him into government service.<ref>MAA documentary, especially comments by Morgenstern regarding this aspect of von Neumann's personality</ref> As President of the Von Neumann Committee for Missiles, and later as a member of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]], from 1953 until his death in 1957, he was influential in setting U.S. scientific and military policy. Through his committee, he developed various scenarios of nuclear proliferation, the development of intercontinental and submarine missiles with atomic warheads, and the controversial strategic equilibrium called [[mutual assured destruction]]. During a [[United States Senate|Senate]] committee hearing he described his political ideology as "violently anti-[[Communism|communist]], and much more militaristic than the norm". Von Neumann's interest in meteorological prediction led him to propose manipulating the environment by spreading colorants on the [[polar ice caps]] to enhance absorption of solar radiation (by reducing the [[albedo]]), thereby raising global temperatures. He also favored a preemptive nuclear attack on the [[Soviet Union]], believing that doing so could prevent it from obtaining the atomic bomb.<ref>Macrae p. 332; Heims, pp. 236–247.</ref> ==Personality== Von Neumann invariably wore a conservative grey flannel business suit – he was even known to play tennis wearing his business suit – and he enjoyed throwing large parties at his home in Princeton, occasionally twice a week.<ref>Macrae pp. 170–171</ref> His white clapboard house at 26 Westcott Road was one of the largest in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]].<ref>Ed Regis.
