Louis, Missouri, and was composed of many teenage hackers, phreakers, coders, and largely black hat-style underground computer geeks. One of the more notable group members was '''Tennessee Tuxedo''', a young man that was instrumental with developing conference calls via the use of trunk line phreaking via the use of the Novation Apple Cat II that allowed them to share their current hacks, phreaking codes, and new software releases. Other notable members were The Apple Bandit, Krakowicz, and Krac-man. Black Bart was clever at using his nationally known and very popular BBS system in order to promote the latest gaming software. He used that relationship to his advantage, often shipping the original pre-released software to his most trusted code crackers during the beta-testing phase, weeks prior to their public release. The Warelords often collaborated with other piracy groups at the time, such as The Syndicate and The Midwest Pirates Guild and developed an international ring of involved piracy groups that reached as far away as Japan. Long before the movie War Games went into pre-production, The Warelords had successfully infiltrated such corporations and institutions as The White House, Southwestern Bell "Ma Bell" Mainframe Systems, and large corporate providers of voice mail systems. ===1982=== * [[The 414s]] break into 60 computer systems at institutions ranging from the Los Alamos Laboratories to Manhattan's [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]].<ref name="time">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,949797-1,00.html The 414 Gang Strikes Again, Aug 29 1983, Time magazine]</ref> The incident appeared as the cover story of [[Newsweek]] with the title ''Beware: Hackers at play'',<ref>''Beware: Hackers at play'', Newsweek, September 5, 1983, pp. 42-46,48</ref> possibly the first mass-media use of the term ''hacker'' in the context of computer security.
