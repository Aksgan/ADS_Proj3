The [[Packet (information technology)|packets]] of each description are routed over multiple, (partially) disjoint paths. In order to decode the media stream, any description can be used, however, the quality improves with the number of descriptions received in parallel. The idea of MDC is to provide error resilience to media streams. Since an arbitrary subset of descriptions can be used to decode the original stream, network congestion or packet loss — which are common in [[best-effort network]]s such as the [[Internet]] — will not interrupt the stream but only cause a (temporary) loss of quality. The quality of a stream can be expected to be roughly proportional to data rate sustained by the receiver. MDC is a form of data partitioning, thus comparable to layered coding as it is used in [[MPEG-2]] and [[MPEG-4]]. Yet, in contrast to MDC, layered coding mechanisms generate a base layer and n enhancement layers. The base layer is necessary for the media stream to be decoded, enhancement layers are applied to improve stream quality. However, the first enhancement layer depends on the base layer and each enhancement layer ''n'' + 1 depends on its subordinate layer ''n'', thus can only be applied if ''n'' was already applied. Hence, media streams using the layered approach are interrupted whenever the base layer is missing and, as a consequence, the data of the respective enhancement layers is rendered useless. The same applies for missing enhancement layers. In general, this implies that in lossy networks the quality of a media stream is not proportional to the amount of correct received data. Besides increased fault tolerance, MDC allows for rate-adaptive streaming: Content providers send all descriptions of a stream without paying attention to the download limitations of clients. Receivers that can't sustain the data rate only subscribe to a subset of these streams, thus freeing the content provider from sending additional streams at lower data rates. The vast majority of state-of-the art [[codec]]s uses single description (SD) video coding. This approach does not partition any data at all. Despite the aforementioned advantages of MDC, SD codecs are still predominant. The reasons are probably the comparingly high complexity of codec development, the loss of some compression efficiency as well as the caused transmission overhead. Though MDC has its practical roots in media communication, it is widely researched in the area of Information Theory. ==References== *V. K.

In MGL, locks are set on objects that contain other objects. MGL exploits the hierarchical nature of the ''contains'' relationship. For example, a database may have files, which contain pages, which further contain records. This can be thought of as a [[tree (data structure)|tree]] of objects, where each node contains its children. A [[lock (computer science)|lock]] locks a [[node (computer science)|node]] and its descendants. Multiple granularity locking is usually used with non-strict [[two-phase locking]] to guarantee [[serializability]]. MGL uses [[lock escalation]] to determine granularity lock on a node and its ancestors. ==Lock Modes== In addition to shared (S) locks and exclusive (X) locks from other locking schemes, like strict two-phase locking, MGL also uses ''intention shared'' and ''intention exclusive'' locks. IS locks conflict with X locks, while IX locks conflict with S and X locks. The null lock (NL) is compatible with everything. To lock a node in S (or X), MGL has the transaction locks all of its ancestors with IS (or IX), so if a transaction locks a node in S (or X), no other transaction can access its ancestors in X (or S and X). MGL locking modes are compatible with each other as defined in the following matrix. {| class="wikitable" |- ! Mode || NL || IS || IX || S || SIX || X |- !

It does not refer to the unauthorized republication by someone else, which constitutes [[plagiarism]], [[copyright violation]], or both. There are several forms of duplicate publication: ==Copyright violation== ===Legitimate derivatives=== This is deliberate republication in another format, such as the simultaneous publication of a motion picture and a tie-in book. In doing this, it is necessary to respect copyright, for the rights to a derivative of the original work remains with the author of the work, or the publisher or other party to whom the author has assigned the copyright. ===Legitimate reformatting=== Is another kind of copyright violation. ==Self-plagiarism== There are two
