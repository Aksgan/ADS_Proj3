all. What is it, then? An 'equivalent object'. --> ===Stateful encoding=== A method of encoding programs, such that each substring of the encoding is an instruction to both: #Locate the next instruction in a list, and #Apply it to transform the current program state. Note that a single instruction always includes two sequential phases: choosing an operation, and executing it. The list of operations may either be static – as in [http://esoteric.voxelperfect.net/wiki/ReMorse reMorse] or [http://esoteric.voxelperfect.net/wiki/THRAT THRAT] - or dynamic - as in reMorse4ever. Here is an example based on reMorse or THRAT: Select Next Operation in list Perform Operation ===Despotic language=== A despotic language is a Turing tarpit with a stateful encoding, namely a language in which commands are used to select from a finite range of operations and apply these operations to the current state of the program. Examples include [http://esoteric.voxelperfect.net/wiki/ReMorse reMorse], [http://esoteric.voxelperfect.net/wiki/Whirl Whirl] and, arguably, [[INTERCAL programming language|INTERCAL]]. ===Language paradigm=== The [[Programming paradigm|paradigm of a language]] can fall into a number of categories, and these categories are used to get a general understanding of the way that a specific language operates. These include imperative/despotic languages such as [[brainfuck]], in which instructions describe how to change data; functional languages such as [[Unlambda programming language|Unlambda]], in which data and code are more or less interchangeable and execution is the repeated application of functions to the results of other functions; and rewriting languages such as [[Thue (programming language)|Thue]], in which transformation functions are applied to an initial state. === Funges === A '''funge''' is an esoteric programming language which models its programs as [[metric space]]s with [[coordinate systems]] (often, but not necessarily, [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]]) and which execute instructions located at points in their program space by moving an instruction pointer (a [[position vector]] which indicates the currently executing instruction) through that space. Different instructions determine the direction in which the instruction pointer moves, and consequently, the sequence of instructions that is executed. The current official standard for the behaviour of these programming languages is the Funge-98 Specification. This specification is a generalisation of the semantics of the [[Befunge]] programming language, which has a two-[[dimension]]al [[torus|toroidal]] topology. Languages which adhere closely to this standard, such as Unefunge (one-dimensional) and Trefunge (three-dimensional), are sometimes called ''funges'', while more "distant relatives" which differ in significant respects, such as Wierd, are referred to as ''fungeoids''. ===Nondeterministic language=== For a deterministic language, if one is given the current state of a program, the next state can always be predicted. This is not true for a nondeterministic language. Most languages are deterministic, but some languages, such as Befunge, supply a built-in randomization instruction. Moreover, languages such as [http://p-nand-q.com/humor/programming_languages/java2k.html Java2K] have only randomized instructions. Thus, getting even trivial programs to have a reliable output is often a monumental task. Nondeterministic languages can be used to explore large search spaces, such as grammars, where exhaustive search is impractical. Random text generators such as [http://dev.null.org/dadaengine/ the Dada Engine]{{Dead link|date=November 2010}} and [http://www.schneertz.com/rmutt/ rmutt] are examples of this kind of nondeterminstic language. More esoterically, nondeterministic algorithms have been employed in the theoretical investigation of [[hypercomputation]]. ==Internet community== There is a small but thriving community on the Internet of hobbyists who program in and design esoteric programming languages. The esolang community is active sporadically, and topics of discussion range from debate as to whether a language is [[Turing-complete]] to how one would go about representing abstract and hard to visualise mathematical concepts in a programming environment. There is a mailing list, but it is nearly abandoned and most discussion happens on the [[wiki]] (see below) or on [[IRC]]. Turing completeness is a favorite topic of discussion, since it is not immediately obvious whether or not a language is Turing complete, and it often takes rather large intuitive leaps to come to a solution. New languages with new features are always being created, so proof of Turing completeness is always a challenge. A related pursuit among programming language enthusiasts is the writing of [[obfuscated code]]. ==Examples== Below are some characteristic examples of esoteric programming languages: * [[LOLCODE]] is designed to resemble the speech of [[lolcat]]s. The following is the "hello world" example: HAI CAN HAS STDIO? VISIBLE "HAI WORLD!" KTHXBYE * [[Befunge]] and its ilk allow the instruction pointer to roam in multiple dimensions through the code. For example the following program displays "Hello World" by pushing the characters in reverse order onto the stack, then printing the characters in a loop which circulates clockwise through the instructions [>], [:], [v], [_], [,], and [^]. "dlroW olleH">:v ^,_@ * [[Brainfuck]] is designed for extreme minimalism and leads to obfuscated code, with programs containing only 8 distinct characters. e.g. the following program outputs "Hello World": ++++++++++[>+++++++>++++++++++>+++>+<<<<-]>++.>+.+++++++ ..+++.>++.<<+++++++++++++++.>.+++.------.--------.>+.>. * [[Chef (programming language)|Chef]] is designed to make programs look like cooking recipes. e.g. the following statement pushes an item onto a stack: Put cinnamon into 2nd mixing bowl * [[FALSE]] is a [[stack-based language]] with single-character commands and variables. For example, 3 + 1 can be calculated by evaluating (λ x → x + 1)(3): <code>3[1+]!</code> * [[One instruction set computer]] is a machine language with only one operation. This is actually a class of languages because one can define such a language for any given operation. * [[Piet (programming language)|Piet]] is a visual language whose programs are bitmaps that resemble [[abstract art]]. * [[Velato]] uses MIDI files as input, with the interval between successive notes determining each command. * [[Shakespeare (programming language)|Shakespeare]] is designed to make programs look like Shakespearean plays. e.g. the following statement declares a point in the program which can be reached via a GOTO-type statement: <code>Act I: Hamlet's insults and flattery.</code>. * [[Whitespace (programming language)|Whitespace]] only considers the layout of whitespace and ignores all non-whitespace characters. * [[INTERCAL]], short for "Compiler Language With No Pronounceable Acronym"<ref name="woods-lyon-intercal"/>. * [[Taxi Programming Language]], a language that uses a [[pointer (computing)|pointer]] analogy of a [[taxicab|taxi]]. * [[Malbolge]] (the 8th circle of Hell) was designed to be the most difficult and esoteric programming language.
