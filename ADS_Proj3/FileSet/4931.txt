and various [[Gothic Romanticism]] tales by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. Though their works couldn't be properly considered zombie fiction, the supernatural tales of Bierce and Poe would prove influential on later undead-themed writers such as [[H. P. Lovecraft]], by Lovecraft's own admission.<ref>H. P. Lovecraft, ''Supernatural Horror in Literature'' (1927, 1933–1935) http://gaslight.mtroyal.ca/superhor.htm</ref> One book to expose more recent western culture to the concept of the zombie was ''The Magic Island'' by W.B. Seabrook in 1929. ''Island'' is the sensationalized account of a narrator in [[Haiti]] who encounters [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] cults and their resurrected thralls. [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] claimed that the book "introduced 'zombi' into U.S. speech".<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,764649,00.html "Mumble-Jumble"], [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']], 9 September 1940.</ref> In the 1920s and early 1930s, the American horror author H. P. Lovecraft wrote several novelettes that explored the zombie or undead theme from different angles. "[[Cool Air]]", "[[In the Vault]]" (which includes perhaps the first recorded character ''bitten'' by a zombie), "[[s:The Thing on the Doorstep|The Thing on the Doorstep]]", "[[The Outsider (short story)|The Outsider]]" and "[[Pickman's Model]]" are all undead or zombie-related, but the most definitive zombie story in Lovecraft's oeuvre was 1921's ''[[Herbert West--Reanimator]]'', which "helped define zombies in popular culture".<ref>[http://www.ugo.com/a/zombies-attack/?cur=favorite-zombies&content=reanimator "Our Favorite Zombies"], Underground Online</ref> This ''Frankenstein''-inspired series featured [[Herbert West]], a [[mad scientist]] who attempts to revive human corpses with mixed results. Notably, the resurrected dead are uncontrollable, mostly mute, primitive and extremely violent; though they are not referred to as zombies, their portrayal was prescient, anticipating the modern conception of zombies by several decades. [[Image:Tor Johnson.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tor Johnson]] as a zombie with his victim in cult movie ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' (1959)]] In 1932, [[Victor Halperin]] directed ''[[White Zombie (film)|White Zombie]]'', a horror film starring [[Bela Lugosi]]. This film, capitalizing on the same voodoo zombie themes as Seabrook's book of three years prior, is often regarded as the first legitimate zombie film ever made.<ref>Roberts, Lee. [http://www.best-horror-movies.com/white-zombie.html "''White Zombie'' is regarded as the first zombie film"], November 2006.</ref> Here zombies are depicted as mindless, unthinking henchmen under the spell of an evil magician. Zombies, often still using this voodoo-inspired rationale, were initially uncommon in cinema, but their appearances continued sporadically through the 1930s to the 1960s,<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/keyword/zombie/?start=601&sort=date Search results for keyword "zombie"], [[Internet Movie Database]]</ref> with notable films including ''[[I Walked With a Zombie]]'' (1943) and the infamous ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' (1959). The 1936 film ''[[Things to Come]]'', based on the novel by [[H. G. Wells]], anticipates later zombie films with an apocalyptic scenario surrounding "the wandering sickness", a highly contagious viral plague that causes the infected to wander slowly and insensibly, very much like zombies, infecting others on contact.<ref>''Things to Come'' ([http://monsterhunter.coldfusionvideo.com/ThingsToCome.html film review])</ref> Though this film's direct influence on later films isn't known, ''Things to Come'' is still compared favorably by some critics<ref>Philip French, [http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,,824813,00.html ''28 Days Later'' (film review)], ''[[The Observer]]'', 3 November 2002.</ref> to modern zombie movies. Avenging zombies would feature prominently in the early 1950s [[EC Comics]] such as ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comic)|Tales from the Crypt]]'', which [[George A. Romero]] would later claim as an influence.<ref name="Biodrowski">Biodrowski, Steve. [http://www.hollywoodgothique.com/nightofthelivingdead.html "''Night of the Living Dead'': The classic film that launched the modern zombie genre"]</ref> The comics, including ''Tales'', ''Vault of Horror'' and ''Weird Science'', featured avenging undead in the Gothic tradition quite regularly, including adaptations of Lovecraft's stories which included "In the Vault", "Cool Air" and ''Herbert West—Reanimator''.<ref>[http://www.yankeeclassic.com/miskatonic/library/stacks/periodicals/comics/lovecraft/comics1.htm "H.

It is the story of a future [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], overrun with undead bloodsucking beings. Notable as influential on the zombie genre is the portrayal of a worldwide [[apocalypse]] due to the infestation, in addition to the initial conception of vampirism as a [[disease]] (a scenario comparable to recent zombie media such as ''[[Resident Evil]]''). The novel was a success, and would be adapted to film as ''[[The Last Man on Earth (1964 film)|The Last Man on Earth]]'' in 1964, as ''[[The Omega Man]]'' in 1971, and again in 2007 as ''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]''. Although classified as a vampire story and referred to as "the first modern vampire novel",<ref>David Carroll and Kyla Ward, ''The Horror Timeline'', Burnt Toast No. 13 http://www.tabula-rasa.info/DarkAges/Timeline2.html</ref> ''Legend'' had definitive impact on the zombie genre by way of George A. Romero. Romero was heavily influenced by the novel and its 1964 adaptation when writing the film ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'',<ref>''House of Horrors Presents: The Night of the Living Dead'' http://www.houseofhorrors.com/night68.htm</ref> by his own admission.<ref name="Biodrowski"/> Critics have also noted extensive similarities between ''Night'' and ''Last Man on Earth'',<ref>Danel Griffin ''The Last Man on Earth'' (film review) http://uas.alaska.edu/pub/filmasart/lastmanonearth.htm</ref> indicating further influence. ''Night of the Living Dead'', a taboo-breaking and genre-defining classic, would prove to be more influential on the concept of zombies than any literary or cinematic work before it.<ref>Richard Scheib, ''Night of the Living Dead'' (film review) http://www.moria.co.nz/horror/notld.htm</ref> ==George A.
