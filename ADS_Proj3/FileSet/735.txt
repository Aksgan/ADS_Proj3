Meyer]] with the publication of "The Economics of Slavery in the Antebellum South," in the ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]''.<ref name="Glaeser"/> The New economic history revolution actually began in the mid-1960s and was resisted because many incumbent economic historians were either historians or economists who had very little connection to economic modeling or statistical techniques.<ref>Claudia Goldin, "Cliometrics and the Nobel", ''The Journal of Economic Perspectives'', Vol. 9, No. 2 (Spring, 1995), p. 194.</ref> Areas of key interest included transportation history<ref name="Fogel64">Fogel R.

The Cliometrics Meetings began to be held around this time at [[Purdue University]] and are still held annually in different locations. Today, cliometric approaches are standard in several journals, including the ''[[Journal of Economic History]]'', ''[[Explorations in Economic History]]'', the ''[[European Review of Economic History]]'', and ''[[Cliometrica]]''. According to economist Claudia Goldin, the success of the cliometric revolution had as an unintended consequence the disappearance of economic historians from history departments. As economic historians started using the same tools as economists, they started to seem more like other economists. In Goldin's words, "the new economic historians extinguished the other side".<ref>Claudia Goldin, "Cliometrics and the Nobel", ''The Journal of Economic Perspectives'', Vol. 9, No. 2 (Spring, 1995), p. 206.</ref> The other side nearly disappeared altogether, with only a few remaining in history departments and business schools. However, some new economic historians did, in fact, begin research around this time, among them were Kemmerer and Larry Neal (a student of [[Albert Fishlow]], a leader of the cliometric revolution) from Illinois, Paul Uselding from Johns Hopkins, Jeremy Atack from Indiana, and Thomas Ulen from Stanford.{{Fact|date=March 2009}} In spite of this, the separation of economic history and economics continued until the 1970s.{{Fact|date=March 2009}} A group to encourage and further the study of cliometrics, [http://eh.net/Clio/ The Cliometric Society], was founded in 1983. ==Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics== In October 1993, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Economics]] to Robert William Fogel and Douglass Cecil North "for having renewed research in economic history." The Academy noted that "they were pioneers in the branch of economic history that has been called the 'new economic history,' or cliometrics."<ref name="nobelpress">The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1993, [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1993/press.html Press Release], October 12, 2003.</ref> Fogel and North received the prize for turning the theoretical and statistical tools of modern economics on the historical past: on subjects ranging from slavery and railroads to ocean shipping and property rights. Fogel is often described as the father of modern econometric history.<ref name="nobelpress"/> He's especially noted for using careful empirical work to overturn conventional wisdom. North, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis, was honored as a pioneer in the "new" institutional history. In the Nobel announcement<ref name="nobelpress"/>, specific mention was made of a 1968 paper on ocean shipping, in which North showed that organizational changes played a greater role in increasing productivity than did technical change.<ref>North, Douglass C.

It investigates dynamic processes in history, and is led by [[Peter Turchin]] and [[Andrey Korotayev]].
