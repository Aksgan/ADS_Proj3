'''Three''' binary operations: :::*[[Boolean semigroup]]: a Boolean algebra with an added binary operation that associates, distributes over join, and is annihilated by 0. ::*[[Implicative lattice]]: a distributive lattice with a third binary operation, implication, that distributes left and right over each of meet and join. ::*[[Brouwerian algebra]]: a distributive lattice with a [[greatest element]] and a third binary operation, denoted by infix " ' ", satisfying ((''x''∧''y'')≤''z'')∧(''y''≤''x'')' ''z''. :::*[[Heyting algebra]]: a Brouwerian algebra with a [[least element]], whose third binary operation, now called [[relative pseudo-complement]], satisfies the identities ''x'x''=1, ''x''(''x'y'') = ''xy'', ''x' ''(''yz'') = (''x'y'')(''x'z''), and (''xy'')'''z'' = (''x'z'')(''y'z''). In [[pointless topology]], a Heyting algebra is called a '''frame'''. '''Four''' or more binary operations: *[[Residuated semilattice]]: a semilattice under meet or join, a monoid under product, and two further binary operations, residuation, satisfying the axioms . **[[Action algebra]]: a [[residuated semilattice]] that is also [[Kleene algebra|Kleene lattice]]. Hence combines a 〈∨, •, 1, ←, →〉 algebra with a 〈∨, 0, •, 1, *〉 algebra. **[[Residuated lattice]]: a Brouwerian algebra with a least element and a fourth binary operation, denoted by infix ⊗, such that (⊗,1) is a commutative [[monoid]] obeying the adjointness property ((''x''≤''y'')' ''z'') ↔ (''x''⊗''y''≤''z''). ***[[Residuated Boolean algebra]]: a [[residuated lattice]] whose lattice part is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]. **** [[Relation algebra]]: a [[residuated Boolean algebra]] with an added unary operation, [[inverse relation|converse]]. ''S'', the [[Cartesian square]] of some set, is a [[monoid]] under an added [[residuated lattice|residuated]] binary operation, [[relation composition|composition]] with identity element '''I''', such that 1='''I''' '∨'''I'''. Composition and converse distribute over join. ''A<math>\oplus</math>B'' = (''A'' '⊗''B'' ')' defines a 4th binary operation, relational addition. The following [[Hasse diagram]] illustrates some pathways from a very general concept, [[partially ordered set]]s, to the oldest and most researched lattice, [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]. This diagram reveals some of the hierarchical structure linking a number of important types of lattices, not all discussed above because some are not varieties. This diagram consists of a number of links of the form ''A''→''B'', each meaning that structure ''A'' is included in structure ''B''. [[Image:Lattice v4.png|800px]] ====Lattice ordered structures==== ''S'' includes distinguished elements and is closed under additional operations, so that the axioms for a [[semigroup]], [[monoid]], [[group (mathematics)|group]], or a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] are satisfied. ===Ring-like structures=== '''Two''' [[binary operations]], addition and multiplication. That multiplication has a 0 is either an axiom or a theorem. *[[shell (mathematics)|Shell]]: [[Multiplication]] has left/right [[identity element]] of 1, and a [[zero element]], 0, which is also the left/right [[identity element]] for [[addition]]. *[[Ringoid]]: multiplication distributes over addition. **[[Nonassociative ring]]: a ringoid that is an abelian group under addition. ***[[Lie ring]]: a nonassociative ring whose multiplication [[anticommutative|anticommutes]] and satisfies the [[Jacobi identity]]. ***[[Jordan ring]]: a nonassociative ring whose multiplication commutes and satisfies the [[Jordan identity]]. **Newman algebra: a ringoid that is also a shell. There is a unary operation, [[inverse]], denoted by a postfix "'", such that x+x'=1 and xx'=0. The following are provable: inverse is unique, ''x''"=''x'', addition commutes and associates, and multiplication commutes and is idempotent. ** [[Semiring]]: a ringoid that is also a shell. Addition and multiplication associate, addition commutes. *** Commutative [[semiring]]: a semiring whose multiplication commutes. ** [[Rng (algebra)|Rng]]: a ringoid that is an [[Abelian group]] under addition and 0, and a semigroup under multiplication. *** [[Ring (mathematics)|Ring]]: a rng that is a monoid under multiplication and 1. **** [[Commutative ring]]: a ring with commutative multiplication. ***** [[Boolean ring]]: a commutative ring with [[idempotent]] multiplication, [[isomorphic]] to [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]]. ****[[differential algebra|Differential ring]]: A ring with an added [[unary operation]], [[differential algebra|derivation]], denoted by [[Suffix|prefix]] ∂ and satisfying the [[product rule]], ∂(''xy'') = ∂''xy''+''x''∂''y''. N.B. The above definitions of ''rng'', ''ring'', and ''semiring'' do not command universal assent: *Some employ "ring" to denote what is here called a [[Rng (algebra)|rng]], and call a ring in the above sense a "ring with identity"; *Some define a semiring as having no identity elements. ===Modules and algebras=== These structures feature a set ''R'' whose elements are [[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]], denoted by Greek letters, and a set ''S'' whose members are denoted by Latin letters. For every ring ''R'', there is a corresponding [[variety (universal algebra)|variety]] of ''R''-modules. *[[Monoid ring]]: ''R'' is a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] and ''S'' is a [[monoid]]. **[[Group ring]]: a monoid ring such that ''S'' is a group. ***[[Group algebra]]: a group ring whose group product commutes. *[[Module (mathematics)|Module]]: ''S'' is an abelian [[group with operators]], each unary operator indexed by ''R''. The operators are [[scalar multiplication]] ''R''x''S''→''S'', which commutes, associates, is [[unital algebra|unital]], and distributes over module and scalar addition. If only the pre(post)multiplication of module elements by scalars is defined, the result is a ''left'' (''right'') ''module''. **[[Comodule]]: the [[dual (category theory)|dual]] of a module. **[[Vector space]]: A module such that ''R'' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. ** [[Algebra over a ring]] (also ''R-algebra''): a module where ''R'' is a [[commutative ring]]. There is a second binary operation over ''S'', called multiplication and denoted by concatenation, which distributes over module addition and is [[bilinear]]: α(''xy'') = (α''x'')''y'' = ''x''(α''y''). ***[[Algebra over a field]]: An algebra over a ring whose ''R'' is a field. **** [[Associative algebra]]: an algebra over a field or ring, whose vector multiplication associates. *****[[Coalgebra]]: the [[dual (category theory)|dual]] of a unital associative algebra. *****[[Commutative algebra]]: an associative algebra whose vector multiplication commutes. *****[[Incidence algebra]]: an associative algebra such that the elements of ''S'' are the functions ''f'' [''a,b'']: [''a,b'']→''R'', where [''a,b''] is an arbitrary closed interval of a locally finite [[poset]]. Vector multiplication is defined as a [[convolution]] of functions. ****[[Jordan algebra]]: an algebra over a field
