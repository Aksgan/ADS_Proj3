communication, voice recognition, and voice memos, which can be useful for recording things, such as an academic tutorial, a voice lesson, or a college lecture, and a three-axis gyroscopic sensor which enables the device to recognize approximately how far, fast, and in which direction it has moved in space. The device originally shipped with [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] [[iOS (Apple) version history|4.1]], which added Game Center to iOS along with the ability to use FaceTime through Wi-Fi. ==Hardware== The iPod Touch has a slim rectangular shape with rounded edges, with a glass [[multi-touch]] display covering most of the top surface and a physical home button off the touchscreen. The display functions similarly to the [[Multi-touch|multi-touch trackpad]] as implemented in Apple's [[Mac family|current line]] of laptop computers. It is also very similar to the iPad interface and the Apple Magic Trackpad. The touch and gesture features of the iPod Touch are based on technology originally developed by [[FingerWorks]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=iGesture Game Mode Guide|last=Fingerworks, Inc.|year=2003|publisher=www.fingerworks.com|url=http://rwservices.no-ip.info:81/pens/biblio05.html#Fingerworks03|accessdate=2009-04-30}}</ref> ==Software== {{Prose|section|date=December 2010}} The home screen, called [[SpringBoard]], has a grid of icons for the available applications. All iPod Touch models include applications such as Music, Videos, and Photos (collectively duplicating the standard functions of the [[iPod Classic]]), [[iTunes]] (providing access to the [[iTunes Store#iTunes Store for iOS|iTunes Music Store]]), [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], [[YouTube]], Calendar, Contacts, Clock, Calculator, and Settings. Later models added [[Mail (application)|Mail]] (accessing [[Post Office Protocol|POP]]/[[Internet Message Access Protocol|IMAP]]/[[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]] e-mail), [[Google Maps#Google Maps for Mobile|Maps]], Stocks, Notes, and Weather, which could also be added to the earlier models with the purchase of a software upgrade. The user can add direct links to Web sites, called "Web Clips", to the home screen. All iPod Touch models are equipped with [[Wi-Fi]] [[IEEE 802.11|802.11b/g]]. The 4th Generation Model is equipped with [[Wi-Fi]] 802.11b/g/n (2.4 GHz only). On July 11, 2008, the [[iOS (Apple)|iPhone OS 2.0 Software Update]] was released for purchase for the iPod Touch. The update allowed 1st generation iPod Touch devices access to the [[App Store]] to download third-party applications, in addition to a host of minor bug fixes. On June 17, 2009, the [[iOS (Apple)|iPhone OS 3.0 Software Update]] was released for purchase for the iPod Touch. The update allowed the devices to use new apps, and unlocked the [[Bluetooth]] functionality of the 2nd generation iPod Touch, enabling [[A2DP]] and [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] apps, as well as file transfer to other (non Apple) devices such as Bluetooth-enabled mobile phones or [[Jailbreaking for iOS|jailbroken]] iPods using software such as iBlueNova. On June 21, 2010, the new [http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/ios4-software-update.html iOS 4.0] software update was released to second and third generation iPod Touch users for free. It includes multitasking, app folders, backgrounds, iAd, and much more. However, second generation iPod Touch devices did not receive multitasking, backgrounds, and Bluetooth keyboard support. iOS 4 is not supported on the first-generation iPod Touch, and further software update support has been discontinued. On November 25, 2010, the new [http://www.apple.com/ios] iOS 4.2 software was released to second, third, and fourth generations iPod Touch users for free. It includes multitasking, more room for apps, AirPrint, AirPlay, access to Find my iPhone (or iPod, iPad), and much more. However, Find my iPhone is not available for the second and third generation iPod Touch. iOS 4.2 is not supported on the first generation iPod Touch. Software update is still available. ==Comparisons to the iPhone and model comparisons== {{further|[[iOS (Apple)]]|[[iOS version history]]}} The iPod Touch and the [[iPhone]], a [[smartphone]] by [[Apple Inc.]], share the same hardware platform and run the same [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] operating system. The iPod Touch lacks some of the iPhone's features and associated apps, such as access to cellular networks (and speaker on older models). As a result, the iPod Touch is slimmer and lighter than the iPhone. [[Steve Jobs]] once referred to the iPod Touch as "training wheels for the iPhone".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/iphone-finally-arrives-but-its-neither-cheap-nor-g3-402835.html |title=iPhone finally arrives but it's neither cheap nor G3. |first=Nic |last=Fildes |work=[[The Independent]] |date=September 19, 2007 |accessdate=2008-10-24}}</ref> The 2nd generation iPod Touch has an external volume switch and a built-in speaker like the [[iPhone]]. The 2nd generation also comes with the chrome frame seen on the iPhone 3G, making the two almost identical when viewed from the front. However, there are some notable differences, as there is no speaker above the screen, no silent/ringer switch, the back is metal, and the sleep/wake button is on the other side. The 2nd generation also supports audio input when a headphone or earphone with microphone capabilities is plugged into the audio output (headphone) jack.
