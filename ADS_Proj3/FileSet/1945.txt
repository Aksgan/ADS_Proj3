This "conciliar" calendar divided the year into "[[prytanies]]", one for each of the "[[phylai]]", the subdivisions of Athenian citizens. The number of phylai, and hence the number of prytanies, varied over time. Until 307 BCE, there were 10 phylai. After that the number varies between 11 and 13 (usually 12). Even more confusing, while the conciliar and festival years were about the same length in the 4th century BCE, such was not regularly the case earlier or later. documents dated by prytany are frequently very difficult to assign to a particular equivalent in the [[Gregorian calendar]].
