Berkeley offers around 300 undergraduate and [[graduate degree]] programs in a wide range of disciplines, and the university has the highest number of graduate programs ranked in the top 10 in their fields by the [[United States National Research Council]]. Among other distinctions, University faculty, alumni, and researchers have won 66 [[Nobel Prize]]s, 9 [[Wolf Prize]]s, 7 [[Fields Medal]]s, 12 [[Turing Award]]s, 43 [[MacArthur Fellowship]]s, 19 [[Academy Award]]s, and 11 [[Pulitzer Prize]]s. Cal student-athletes compete intercollegiately as the ''[[California Golden Bears]]''. A member of both the [[Pacific-10 Conference]] and the [[Mountain Pacific Sports Federation]] in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], Cal students have won national titles in many sports, including football, men's basketball, baseball, men's gymnastics, softball, water polo, rugby, and crew. In addition, they have won over 100 [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] medals. The official colors of the university and its athletic teams are [[Yale Blue]] and California [[Gold (color)|Gold]]. Berkeley was a founding member of the [[Association of American Universities]]. Berkeley physicist [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] was the scientific director of the [[Manhattan Project]], which he personally headquartered at [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]], during [[World War II]]. Since that time, the university has managed or co-managed the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], as well as the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] and [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] for the [[U.S. Department of Energy]]. ==History== [[Image:CampanileMtTamalpiasSunset-original.jpg|thumb|right|Sather Tower (the Campanile) looking out over the [[San Francisco Bay]] and [[Mount Tamalpais]].]] {{Main|History of the University of California, Berkeley}} In 1866, the land comprising the current Berkeley campus was purchased by the private [[College of California]]. Because it lacked sufficient funds to operate, it eventually merged with the state-run Agricultural, Mining, and Mechanical Arts College to form the [[University of California]], the first full-curriculum public university in the state of California. The university opened in September 1869. [[Andrew Gabrielson]] was a trustee of the College of California and suggested that the college be named in honor of the [[Anglo-Irish]] philosopher [[George Berkeley]].<ref name="Berkeley">{{cite web| url=http://berkeleypubliclibrary.org/system/Chapter2.html| work=Berkeley, A City in History| author=Wollenberg, Charles| year=2002| title=Chapter 2: Tale of Two Towns| publisher=Berkeley Public Library| accessdate=June 6, 2009}}</ref> In 1870 [[Henry Durant]], the founder of the College of California, became the first president.

Originally, military training was compulsory for male undergraduates, and Berkeley housed an armory for that purpose. In 1917, Cal's ROTC program was established, and its School of Military Aeronautics trained future pilots, including [[Jimmy Doolittle]], who graduated with a B.A. in 1922. Both [[Robert McNamara]] and [[Frederick C. Weyand]] graduated from Cal's ROTC program, earning B.A. degrees in 1937 and 1938, respectively. During World War II, the military increased its presence on campus to recruit more officers, and by 1944, the student body at Berkeley included more than 1,000 Navy personnel. The Board of Regents ended compulsory military training at Berkeley in 1962. During the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy era]] in 1949, the [[Regents of the University of California|Board of Regents]] adopted an anti-[[communist]] [[loyalty oath]].
