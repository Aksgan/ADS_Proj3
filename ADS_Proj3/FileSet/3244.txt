to OpenMath content dictionaries. On each level, formal syntax and informal natural language can be used, depending on the application. ==Semantics and Presentation== OMDoc is a semantic markup language that allows to write down the ''meaning'' of texts about mathematics. In contrast to [[LaTeX]], for example, it is not primarily presentation-oriented. An OMDoc document need not specify what its contents should look like. A conversion to LaTeX and [[XHTML]] (with Presentation [[MathML]] for the formulae) is possible, though. To this end, the presentation of each symbol can be defined. == Applications == Today, OMDoc is used in the following settings: ;[[E-learning]]:creation of customized textbooks ;Data exchange:OMDoc import and export modules are available for many [[automated theorem proving|automated theorem provers]] and [[computer algebra system]]s. OMDoc is intended to be used for communication between mathematical [[web service]]s. ;Document preparation:Documents about mathematics can be prepared in OMDoc and later exported to a presentation-oriented format like LaTeX or XHTML+MathML. == History == OMDoc has been developed by the German mathematician and computer scientist [[Michael Kohlhase]] since 1998. So far, there have been the following releases: * 1.0 (November 2000) * 1.1 (December 2001) * 1.2 (July 2006) == Future Developments == It is planned to create the infrastructure for a “[[semantic web]] for technology and science” based on OMDoc. To this end, OMDoc is being extended towards sciences other than mathematics. The first result is [[PhysML]], an OMDoc variant extended towards [[Physics]]. For a better integration with other Semantic Web applications, an [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] ontology of OMDoc is under development, as well as an export facility to [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]. == References == * Michael Kohlhase (2006): ''[http://www.mathweb.org/omdoc/pubs/omdoc1.2.pdf An Open Markup Format for Mathematical Documents (Version 1.2)]''.

Its mission was to intercept, decrypt, and analyze naval communications from [[Japanese Imperial Navy|Japanese]], [[Germany|German]], and [[Italy|Italian]] navies. In addition OP-20-G also copied diplomatic messages of many foreign governments. The majority of the sections effort was directed towards [[Japan]] and included breaking the early Japanese [[Japanese naval codes|“Blue” book fleet code]]. This was made possible by intercept and [[High Frequency Direction Finder]] (HFDF) sites in the [[Pacific]], [[Atlantic]], and continental U.S., as well as a Japanese telegraphic code school for radio operators in [[Washington D.C.]] ==History== The Code and Signal Section was formally made a part of the Division of Naval Communications (DNC), as Op-20-G, on July 1, 1922. In January 1924, a 34-year-old [[US Navy]] [[lieutenant]] named [[Laurance F. Safford]] was assigned to expand OP-20-G's domain to radio interception. He worked out of Room 2646, on the top floor of the [[United States Department of the Navy|Navy Department]] building in Washington DC. Japan was of course a prime target for [[radio]] interception and [[cryptanalysis]], but there was the problem of finding personnel who could speak [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. The Navy had a number of [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] who had served in a [[diplomatic]] capacity in Japan and could speak Japanese fluently, but there was a shortage of radiotelegraph operators who could read Japanese [[Morse code]] communications sent in ''[[kana]]''. Fortunately, a number of [[US Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] radiotelegraph operators operating in the [[Pacific]] had formed an informal group in 1923 to compare notes on [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[kana]] transmissions. Four of these men became instructors in the art of reading kana transmissions when the Navy began conducting classes in the subject in 1928. The classes were conducted by the Room 2646 crew, and the radiotelegraph operators became known as the "On-The-Roof Gang". By June 1940, OP-20-G included 147 officers, enlisted men, and civilians, linked into a network of radio listening posts as far-flung as the Army's. OP-20-G did some work on Japanese diplomatic codes, but the organization's primary focus was on Japanese military codes. The [[US Navy]] first got a handle on Japanese naval codes in 1922, when Navy agents broke into the Japanese consulate in [[New York]], cracked the safe, took [[photographs]] of pages of a Japanese navy codebook, and left, having put everything back as they had found it. Before the war, the Navy cipher bureau operated out of three main bases: *headquarters in [[Washington DC]] * [[Station Hypo]], a section at [[Pearl Harbor]] in Hawaii * [[Station Cast]], a section in the fortified caves of the island of [[Corregidor]], in the [[Philippines]]. The [[codebreakers]] were backed up by a far-flung network of listening and radio direction finding stations. The [[US Army]] [[Signals Intelligence Service]] (SIS) and OP-20-G were badly hobbled by bureaucracy. Part of the problem was that they had unsurprisingly become rivals, competing with each other to provide their intelligence data, codenamed "[[Magic (cryptography)|MAGIC]]", to high officials. Both organizations came out looking foolish and obnoxious, and word came down that the two groups were to cooperate. That was easier said than done, and rivalries between the two [[cryptanalysis]] teams would remain a problem for a long time. The best that SIS and OP-20-G were able to do was come
