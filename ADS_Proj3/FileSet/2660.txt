The '''load average''' represents the average system load over a period of time. It conventionally appears in the form of three numbers which represent the system load during the last '''one'''-, '''five'''-, and '''fifteen'''-minute periods. == Unix-style load calculation == All Unix and Unix-like systems generate a [[Software metric|metric]] of three "load average" numbers in the [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]]. Users can easily query the current result from a [[Unix shell]] by running the <tt>[[uptime]]</tt> command: $ uptime 14:34:03 up 10:43, 4 users, load average: 0.06, 0.11, 0.09 The [[W (Unix)|<tt>w</tt>]] and [[Top (Unix)|<tt>top</tt>]] commands show the same three load average numbers, as do a range of [[graphical user
