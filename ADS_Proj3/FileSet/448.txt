Sydney]]. * [[Discovery Net]] (circa 2000) is one of the earliest examples of scientific workflow systems. It was the winner of the “Most Innovative Data Intensive Application Award” at the ACM SC02 (Supercomputing 2002) conference and exhibition, based on a demonstration of a fully interactive distributed genome annotation pipeline for a Malaria genome case study. The Discovery Net system originated from a £2m [[EPSRC]]-funded project with the same name investigating the development of an e-Science platform for scientific discovery from the data generated by a wide variety of high throughput devices at [[Imperial College London]]. Many of the features of the system (architecture features, visual front-end, simplified access to remote Web and Grid Services and inclusion of a workflow store) were considered novel at the time, and have since found their way into other academic and commercial systems. * [[Ergatis]] is a web-based system used to create, run, and monitor reusable bioinformatics analysis pipelines. It contains pre-built components for common bioinformatics analysis tasks, such as blast searches or storing data in a [[Generic Model Organism Database|Chado]] database. These components can be arranged graphically to create highly-configurable pipelines. * [[Galaxy (computational biology)|Galaxy]] is an [[open source]] workflow system developed at [[Pennsylvania State University]]. * [[GenePattern]] is a genomic analysis platform developed at the [[Broad Institute|Broad Institute of MIT & Harvard]] that provides access to more than 120 tools for gene expression analysis, proteomics, SNP analysis, and common data processing tasks. A web-based interface provides access to these tools and allows the creation of multi-step analysis pipelines that enable reproducible in silico research. * [[Geodise]] (Grid Enabled Optimisation and Design Search for Engineering) was developed at the [[University of Southampton]]. * [[Kepler scientific workflow system|Kepler]] enables scientists in a variety of disciplines like biology, ecology and astronomy to compose and execute workflows. Kepler is based on the Ptolemy II system for heterogeneous, concurrent modeling and design. Ptolemy II was developed by the members of the Ptolemy project at [[University of California Berkeley]]. Although not originally intended for scientific workflows, it provides a mature platform for building and executing workflows, and supports multiple models of computation. * [[LONI Pipeline]] is a Java-based distributed graphical data-analysis environment for constructing, validating, executing and disseminating scientific workflows. As the [[LONI Pipeline]] references all data, services and tools as external objects, it directly allows resource interoperability without the need for rebuilding the software. * [[Medicel Integrator Workflow]] is a cluster-enabled bioinformatics workflow design and execution application. It can be used stand-alone or integrated with a biology data warehouse. * [[Pegasus Workflow Management System|Pegasus]] is a flexible framework that enables the mapping of complex scientific workflows onto the [[Grid computing|grid]] developed at the [[Information Sciences Institute]] at the [[University of Southern California]]. * [[Pegasys]] is a software for executing and integrating analyses of biological sequences, developed by the [[University of British Columbia]]. * [[Taverna workbench]] is an [[open source]] workflow system that enables scientists (typically, though not exclusively, in bioinformatics) to compose and execute scientific workflows. It has been developed as part of a £5.5m EPSRC project called [[myGrid]] based at the [[University of Manchester]]. Independently, other researchers have created [[Programming by example]] workflow development tools that are interoperable with Taverna. * [[Triana]] is an open source problem solving environment developed at [[Cardiff University]] that combines an intuitive visual interface with powerful data analysis tools. * [[Wildfire]] is a distributed, Grid-enabled workflow construction and execution environment]. It has a graphical user interface for constructing and running workflows. Wildfire borrows user interface features from Jemboss and adds a drag-and-drop interface allowing the user to compose [[EMBOSS]] (and other) programs into workflows. For execution, Wildfire uses GEL, the underlying workflow execution engine, which can exploit available parallelism on multiple CPU machines including Beowulf-class clusters and Grids. * [[Sight (workflow platform)|Sight]] is a web agent – oriented workflow platform that historically has extensive means to integrate websites with ordinary web forms and HTML responses (there is also support for WSDL as well). The system has a GUI-based workflow composer that supports modules with multiple ports and allows to access data from the modules that stand earlier in workflow. Sight was developed in [[University of Ulm|Ulm university]] using java and it currently released under [[GPL]]. * [[RetroGuide]] is a query framework for querying retrospective bioinformatics data. * [[UGENE|UGENE Workflow Designer]] is an [[open source]] visual environment designed for building and executing bioinformatics workflows. The main purpose of the system is providing user-friendly [[GUI]] for creating computational workflows that can be executed as well as on commodity hardware as on high-performance clusters and supercomputers. * [[HCDC]] is an open source workflow system developed at [[ETH Zurich]] that is focus on large scale image based biological experiments. Include large collection of components for multiwell plate handling (96, 384, ...). ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cpe.993 Taverna: Lessons in creating a workflow environment for the Life Sciences] This paper reviews some of the above workflow systems * [http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1084805.1084814 A taxonomy of scientific workflow systems for grid computing] from the ACM [[SIGMOD]] Record * [http://www.embracegrid.info/ Portal of a joint European Grid and web-services project called EMBRACE].
