It is designed to facilitate the process of [[re-conform]]ing audio data in film and television productions. The application operates by comparing [[EDL]]s, [[cutlist]]s, or [[Final Cut Pro]] [[XML]] files to determine the changes made between two versions of an edited picture sequence. Once the changes have been identified it is capable of automatically moving audio data into correct sync with the recut picture. This [[re-conform]] process can be applied to audio in a [[Pro Tools]] session or to [[timecode]] and [[Feet+Frames]] information from a database. ==History== Conformalizer was developed by Justin Webster, a Wellington, New Zealand sound editor and was first employed on [[Roger Donaldson]]'s [[The World's Fastest Indian]]. v2.0 was released in December 2006 and, amongst other things, added support for the [[Final Cut Pro]] XML interchange format. Conformalizer has found widespread popularity amongst [[feature film]] sound editors, especially on large budget, [[VFX]] heavy productions where recuts and animation updates continue until very late in the sound post-production process. In particular, director [[Peter Jackson]]'s sound team rely heavily on Conformalizer, using multiple copies to keep each editor up to date with rapidly changing cuts and [[VFX]]. Other notable facilities using Conformalizer are [[Skywalker Sound]] and [[Technicolor Sound Services]]. ==Key features== *Compatible with EDL, FCP XML, Cutlist, AVID Changenote *Exports proprietary EDL and changenote *Traces and tracks VFX updates *Loads [[Quicktime]] movies for comparison and verification *Conforms Pro Tools sessions, or any Tab-separated data containing [[timecode]] or [[Feet+Frames]] *Handles rebalances between film reels *allows extensive editing and manipulation of the 'change EDL' *intelligently heals the 'change EDL' to minimize damage when re-conforming. ==Productions known to have used Conformalizer== *[[The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep]] *[[Bridge to Terabithia (2007 film)]] *[[King Kong (2005 film)]] *[[Out of the Blue (2006 film)]] *[[Transformers (film)]] *[[Perfume: The Story of a Murderer (film)]] *[[Mr. Brooks]] *[[30 Days of Night (film)]] *[[The Black Dahlia (film)]] *[[The World's Fastest Indian]] *[http://imdb.com/title/tt1043869/ Shabat Shalom Maradona] *[http://imdb.com/title/tt0870211/ Battle for Haditha] ==See also== *[[EDL]] *[[Cutlist]] *[[XML]] ==References== *[http://www.editorsguild.com/v2/magazine/archives/0506/features_article05.htm Editors Guild article - Conformalizer keeps Kong in sync] *[http://www.toolfarm.com/2007/11/plugged-in-podcast-13-has-some-hot.html Toolfarm - Plugged In Podcast - Interview] ==External links== *[http://www.maggot.co.nz maggot software] *[http://www.maggot.co.nz/software/letterToEd.shtml conformalizer 'letter to the editor'] [[Category:Mac OS X software]] [[Category:Audio editors]]</text> </page> <page> <id>7760</id> <title>Conjugate diameters</title> <text>[[Image:Conjugate Diameters.svg|thumb|300px|right|Two conjugate diameters of an [[ellipse]]. Each edge of the bounding [[parallelogram]] is [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to one of the diameters.]] In [[geometry]], two [[diameter]]s of a [[conic section]] are said to be '''conjugate''' if each [[chord (geometry)|chord]] [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to one diameter is [[bisection|bisected]] by the other. For example, two diameters of a [[circle]] are conjugate if and only if they are [[perpendicular]]. For an [[ellipse]], two diameters are conjugate if and only if the [[tangent line]] to the ellipse at the endpoint of one diameter is parallel to the other. Each pair of conjugate diameters of an ellipse has a corresponding tangent [[parallelogram]], sometimes called a '''bounding parallelogram'''. In his manuscript [[De motu corporum in gyrum]], and in the '[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica‎|Principia]]', [[Isaac Newton]] cites as a [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] proved by previous authors that all (bounding) parallelograms for a given ellipse have the same [[area]]. It is possible to [[Compass and straightedge constructions|reconstruct]] an ellipse from any pair of conjugate diameters, or from any bounding parallelogram. For example, in [[proposition]] 14 of Book VIII of his ''Collection'', [[Pappus of Alexandria]] gives a method for constructing the axes of an ellipse from a given pair of conjugate diameters. Two [[hyperbola]]s are conjugate if they are images of each other in a [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] across an [[asymptote]]. A diameter of one hyperbola is conjugate to its reflection in the asymptote, which is a diameter of the other hyperbola. They are [[hyperbolic-orthogonal]] to each other. In a [[spacetime]] plane, one hyperbola corresponds to events a constant [[distance]] from the origin event, the other hyperbola corresponds to events a constant [[proper time]] from it. The [[principle of relativity]] can be formulated as "Any pair of conjugate diameters of conjugate hyperbolas can be taken for the axes of space and time", as indicated by [[E. T. Whittaker]] in 1910. ==References== *{{PlanetMath|urlname=ConjugateRadii|title=Conjugate Diameters of Ellipse}} *[http://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Geometry/ConjugateDiameters.shtml Conjugate Diameters in Ellipse] at cut-the-knot.org. * [[William Kingdon Clifford]] (1878) [http://dlxs2.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=math;cc=math;view=toc;subview=short;idno=04370002 Elements of Dynamic], page 90, London: MacMillan & Co; on-line presentation by [[Cornell University]] ''Historical Mathematical Monographs''. * [[George Salmon]] (1900) ''A Treatise on Conic Sections'', page 165, London: [[Longmans, Green & Co.]]. * {{Citation | author=Whittaker, E.T. | year=1910 | title= 1.
