test phase. Through this test phase, the author hopes for [[Software bug|bug]] reports and discussion that will help shape Perfect Dark into the most useful application possible. In comparison to its predecessors [[Winny]] and [[Share (P2P)|Share]], the [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] and [[hard disk drive|hard drive]] space requirements have increased. The minimum upload speed required by perfect dark is 100KB/sec, and it also requires a minimum of 40GB of hard drive space for its "unity" (cache) folder. ==Overview== Like other Japanese sharing software, Perfect Dark has its own proprietary P2P network called "unity". One of the biggest characteristics of Perfect Dark is the strong searching capability. By using [[distributed hash table]]s searching performance is greatly improved compared to either [[Winny]] or [[Share (P2P)|Share]] making it unnecessary to rely on the construction of node clusters. This frees users from inputting or switching cluster keywords and also enables users to search for files of different genres at the same time. This is in contrast to "Winny" and "Share", where cluster keywords, such as "DVDISO" or "アニメ"/"anime" are used to specify what types of files the user is searching for. These keywords segregate the network and introduce delays when the user is to change them. The concept of "tree search" brings its strong searching ability. Also, the flexible use of AND, OR and NOT like operators helps filtering out undesirable results. Perfect Dark requires more bandwidth and HDD space than Winny and Share, forcing fairer loads for all users. If a user does not have Perfect Dark configured with the proper settings or if the user is unable to support the settings then download rates will be throttled and priority will be given to other users. The intention of this is to increase the retention rate of the Perfect Dark network. The author implements an architecture called ''dkt+dht+du'' in the design of the network. Other features besides file sharing are also given considerations. For instance, a simple bulletin system has been implemented. ===dkt+dht+du=== Respectively, they stand for Distributed Keyword Table, Distributed Hash Table and Distributed Unity, which compose the whole network according to the author. dkt is mainly for providing effective file searching, while dht+du is for effective file sharing and anonymity enhancement. ==Security== The overall structure of the Perfect Dark network broadly resembles recent versions of [[Freenet]], only with a heavier use of [[distributed hash tables]]. The anonymity relies on a [[Mix network|mixnet]] where traffic is forwarded according to a certain probability, as well as the deniability of the distributed datastore ("unity"), which is stored and transferred in encrypted blocks, with the [[Key (cryptography)|key]]s distributed separately. Perfect Dark uses [[RSA]] (1024-bit) and [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] (128-bit) to [[encrypt]] data transmitted between peers. Exchanged keys are cached for efficiency. Published files and boards (including automatic updates from the author, where enabled) are usually signed with 160-bit [[ECDSA]] signatures. Automatic updates are additionally protected with a 2048-bit RSA signature. The author believes that initially, a layer of obscurity due to the closed-source nature of the program will frustrate attempted attacks on the anonymity, as well as network degradation due to "free riders" and junk files; however, the author has stated that it may become open-source in the future should an acceptable solution to these problems be found. There also came the news that Perfect Dark has been deciphered by NetAgent, which allegedly has the capability to determine encrypted information such as [[IP address]]es, [[TCP and UDP port|port numbers]], keywords, version numbers of clients, and even file names, file sizes, cache creation dates and ratings from the public nodes.<ref>[http://forensic.netagent.co.jp/pd_chosa.html The Perfect Dark investigation service (Japanese)]</ref> ==Legal issues== * On 1 January 2010 a stricter copyright law went into effect in Japan that rendered the intentional unauthorized downloading of copyrighted material illegal, even if only for private use.

Instead of contracting for goods and services, a product support provider (PSP) or product support integrator (PSI) is contracted to meet [[performance metric]](s) for a system or product. The provider often commits to this performance level at a lower cost, or increased performance at costs similar to those previously achieved under a non-PBL contract. Many times the results in employing a PBL strategy have resulted in both increased system performance and cost reductions. Ideally, the provider has more control over constituent elements that are used to generate the performance results. The acronym “PBL” also can be applied synonymously to the term “Performance Based Lifecycle Product Support.”{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} For expensive U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition programs, the PBL approach is mandated as a first-choice strategy and is encouraged for less expensive programs as well. == History == By the early 1990s, increases in the costs to support fielded systems, decreases in the reliability in general, and an overall decrease in readiness of those systems were
