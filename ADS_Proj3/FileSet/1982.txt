people, the mechanisms do not work efficiently enough or the quantity of the substance exceeds the levels at which it can be managed. In these cases, medical intervention is necessary to restore the balance, or permanent damage to the organs may result. ===Varieties=== The [[Dynamic Energy Budget]] theory for metabolic organization delineates structure and (one or more) reserves in an organism. Its formulation is based on three forms of homeostasis: *'''Strong homeostasis''', whereas structure and reserve do not change in composition. Because the amount of reserve and structure can vary, this allows a particular change in the composition of the whole body (as explained by the [[Dynamic Energy Budget]] theory). *'''Weak homeostasis''', wherein the ratio of the amounts of reserve and structure becomes constant as long as food availability is constant, even when the organism grows. This means that the whole body composition is constant during growth in constant environments. *'''Structural homeostasis''', wherein the sub-individual structures grow in harmony with the whole individual; the relative proportions of the individuals remain constant. ==Ecological ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Equilibrium]] --> The concept of homeostasis is central to the topic of [[Ecological stoichiometry|Ecological Stoichiometry]]. There it refers to the relationship between the nutrient content of a resource and the nutrient content of its resources. Stoichiometric homeostasis helps explain nutrient recycling and population dynamics. Historically, [[ecological succession]] was seen as having a stable end-stage called the [[Climax community|climax]] (see [[Frederic Clements]]), sometimes referred to as the 'potential biodiversity' of a site, shaped primarily by the local climate. This idea has been largely abandoned by modern ecologists in favor of nonequilibrium ideas of how ecosystems function, as most natural ecosystems experience disturbance at a rate that makes a "climax" community unattainable. Only on small, isolated habitats known as [[ecological island]]s can the phenomenon be observed. One such case study is the island of [[Krakatoa]] after its major eruption in 1883: the established stable homeostasis of the previous [[forest]] climax ecosystem was destroyed, and all life was eliminated from the island. In the years after the eruption, Krakatoa went through a sequence of ecological changes in which successive groups of new plant or animal species followed one another, leading to increasing [[biodiversity]] and eventually culminating in a re-established climax community. This ''[[ecological succession]]'' on Krakatoa occurred in a number of stages; a ''[[sere]]'' is defined as "a stage in a sequence of events by which succession occurs". The complete chain of seres leading to a climax is called a ''[[prisere]]''. In the case of Krakatoa, the island reached its climax community, with eight hundred different recorded species, in 1983, one hundred years after the eruption that cleared all life off the island. Evidence confirms that this number has been homeostatic for some time, with the introduction of new species rapidly leading to elimination of old ones. The evidence of Krakatoa, and other disturbed island ecosystems, has confirmed many principles of [[Island Biogeography]], mimicking general principles of ecological succession albeit in a virtually closed system comprised almost exclusively of [[endemism|endemic]] species. ==Biosphere== In the [[Gaia hypothesis]], [[James Lovelock]] stated that the entire mass of living matter on Earth (or any planet with life) functions as a vast homeostatic [[superorganism]] that actively modifies its planetary environment to produce the environmental conditions necessary for its own survival. In this view, the entire planet maintains homeostasis. Whether this sort of system is present on Earth is still open to debate. However, some relatively simple homeostatic mechanisms are generally accepted. For example, when atmospheric carbon dioxide levels rise, certain plants are able to grow better and thus act to remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. When sunlight is plentiful and atmospheric temperature climbs, the [[phytoplankton]] of the ocean surface waters thrive and produce more [[dimethyl sulfide]], DMS. The DMS molecules act as [[cloud condensation nuclei]], which produce more clouds, and thus increase the atmospheric [[albedo]], and this feeds back to lower the temperature of the atmosphere. As scientists discover more about Earth, vast numbers of positive and negative feedback loops are being discovered, that, together, maintain a metastable condition, sometimes within very broad range of environmental conditions. Environmental pressure, such as competition or change in temperature, can lead to adaptation/extinction of species over time. ==Reactive== Example of use: "Reactive homeostasis is an immediate homeostasic response to a challenge such as predation." However, ''any'' homeostasis is impossible without reaction - because homeostasis is and must be a "feedback" phenomenon. The phrase "reactive homeostasis" is simply short for "reactive compensation reestablishing homeostasis", that is to say, "reestablishing a point of homeostasis." - it should not be confused with a separate ''kind'' of homeostasis or a distinct phenomenon ''from'' homeostasis; it is simply the compensation (or compensatory) phase of homeostasis. ==Other fields== The term has come to be used in other fields, as well. ====Risk==== {{Main|Risk homeostasis}} An [[actuary]] may refer to ''risk homeostasis'', where (for example) people that have anti-lock brakes have no better safety record than those without anti-lock brakes, because the former unconsciously compensate for the safer vehicle via less-safe driving habits. Previous to the innovation of anti-lock brakes, certain maneuvers involved minor skids, evoking fear and avoidance: now the anti-lock system moves the boundary for such feedback, and behavior patterns expand into the no-longer punitive area. It has also been suggested {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} that ecological crises are an instance of risk homeostasis in which a particular behavior continues until proven dangerous or dramatic consequences actually occur. ====Stress==== Sociologists and psychologists may refer to ''stress homeostasis'', the tendency of a population or an individual to stay at a certain level of stress, often generating artificial stresses if the "natural" level of stress is not enough. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} [[Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard]], a postmodern theorist, has applied this term to societal 'power centers' that he describes as being 'governed by a principle of homeostasis,' for example, the scientific hierarchy, which will sometimes ignore a radical new discovery for years because it destabilises previously-accepted norms.
