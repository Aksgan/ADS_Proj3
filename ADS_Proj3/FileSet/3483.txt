It is used to perform automated GUI testing and for general process automation. Phantom currently supports the automation of Microsoft Windows based graphical interfaces. ==The Phantom language== Automation is accomplished by interpreting a set of commands written using the Phantom scripting language. The Phantom scripting language has a syntax similar to the C language. It includes capabilities common to any high-level scripting language such as: *Script flow control *Multi-dimensional variables *User defined functions *Exception handling *Complex variable types Additionally, the Phantom language includes automation specific function sets: *Window control interaction functions *System interaction functions *Bitmap capture and control functions *Registry interaction functions *Mouse and keyboard simulation functions A simple example of a Phantom script is below: <code> # Phantom Sample Script use "hello.dec"; string notepad = "notepad.exe"; string welcome = "Hello, welcome to Phantom!!!"; System(notepad); Notepad.Edit1.TypeKeys(welcome);</code> ==Window Declarations== Phantom scripts interact with windows through the use of Window Declarations. Window Declarations are text files created using the freely available Window Declarations Recorder. These text files contain information about each window and control to be automated. The declarations are in hierarchical form so that each window or control is referenced to its parent window. By using this method, as opposed to coordinate-based automation, a window or control can be moved or resized without breaking automation scripts. An example of a script calling a window using window declarations is below: <code> use "MyWin.dec"; # Include the window declarations file MyWin.MyControl.SetText("Sample Text"); # Set the control text MyWin.MyControl.MouseClick(0, 1, 1, 0); # Simulate a mouse click in 'MyControl'</code> ==Commercial products== There are three primary products supplied by Phantom Automated Solutions, Inc. that support Phantom automation technology. ===Phantom Test Driver=== The Phantom Test Driver (PTD) application is a Microsoft Windows GUI based IDE for the Phantom language. Its primary purpose is to support large scale GUI test automation processes. It supports Phantom script development through a built-in script editor and debugger. PTD handles test automation by grouping similar test cases into groups called Suites. PTD can execute entire groups of test cases by running a single Suite. Some features of PTD include: *Color-coded script editor *Built-in, fully functional Phantom script debugger *Automation organization through the use of script Suites *Script and Suite output collection and display *Built-in script recorder utility *Built-in Window Declarations Editor *Remote machine automation using the Phantom Remote Agent ===Phantom Sidekick=== Phantom Sidekick is a small utility that uses Phantom scripts to automate repetitive processes. Its primary use is to act a 'system wide' macro, with a single script automating multiple applications. Scripts can be triggered using a user-defined key combination or by scheduling the script using the built-in scheduler. Phantom Sidekick includes a script recorder, a script scheduler, a task-bar script execution menu, and a script editor. ===Phantom Command Line Utility=== The Phantom Command Line Utility is a freely available DOS based utility used to run Phantom scripts. The Phantom Command Line Utility was the original automation tool developed by Phantom Automated Solutions, Inc. The current version (2.0) can run any Phantom script, including those developed using the Phantom Test Driver and Phantom Sidekick applications. The Phantom Command Line Utility includes a script recorder, a Window Declaration recorder, and a target application used to test Phantom automation commands. ==History== Phantom version 1.0 was released in 2000. Version 2.0 of the Phantom Test Driver and Phantom Command Line Utility, as well as version 2.1 of Phantom Sidekick was released in 2008. The new releases represent a major structural change to the underlying automation engine. A precursor to the existing Phantom engine was released in 1999 as Phantom version 0.9. ==See also== {{Portal|Software Testing}} *[[List of GUI testing tools]] ==External links== *[http://www.phantomtest.com Phantom Automated Solutions homepage] *[http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/sqe/bettersoftware_0509/#/20 Better Software Magazine] *[http://hubble.nasa.gov/ Hubble Space Telescope] *[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/120359/tools-for-automated-gui-testing-on-windows/564533#564533 Stack Overflow] *[http://www.sqaforums.com/showflat.php?Cat=0&Board=UBB34&Number=289630&Searchpage=1&Main=289624&Words=phantomtest&topic=&Search=true#Post289630 QAForums] {{DEFAULTSORT:Phantom}} [[Category:Graphical user interface]] [[Category:Program testing tools]] [[Category:Computer programming tools]]</text> </page> <page> <id>29048</id> <title>Phase detector</title> <text>[[Image:Phase detectors.svg|right|frame| Four phase detectors. Signal flow is from left to right. In the upper left is a [[Gilbert cell]], which works well for [[sine wave]]s and [[square wave]]s, but less well for pulses. In the case of square waves it acts as an XOR gate, which can also be made from NAND gates. On the middle left are two phase detectors: adding feedback and removing one NAND gate produces a time frequency detector. The delay line avoids a dead band. On the right is a charge pump with a filter at its output.]] A '''phase detector''' or '''phase comparator''' is a [[frequency mixer]], [[analog multiplier]] or [[Digital logic|logic]] circuit that generates a voltage signal which represents the difference in phase between two signal inputs. It is an essential element of the [[phase-locked loop]] (PLL). Detecting phase differences is very important in many applications, such as [[electric motor|motor]] control, [[radar]] and [[telecommunication]] systems, [[Servomechanism|servo]] mechanisms, and [[demodulator]]s. ==Types== Phase detectors for [[phase-locked loop]] circuits may be classified in two types.<ref>Paul Horowitz and Winfield Hill, ''The Art of Electronics 2nd Ed. '' Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1989 ISBN 0-521370957 pg. 644</ref> A Type I detector is designed to be driven by analog signals or square-wave digital signals and produces an output pulse at the difference frequency. The Type I detector always produces an output waveform, which must be filtered to control the phase-locked loop [[voltage-controlled oscillator]] (VCO). A type II detector is sensitive only to the relative timing of the edges of the input and reference pulses, and produces a constant output proportional to phase difference when both signals are at the same frequency. This output will tend not to produce ripple in the control voltage of the VCO. ===Analog
