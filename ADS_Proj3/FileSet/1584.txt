It was developed by [[Ann Arbor Softworks]] and was sold as a more powerful alternative to Apple's [[MacPaint]]. One of the notable features that differentiated it from MacPaint was its resizable window, and with it the ability to scroll within the document using scroll bars rather than by dragging with the Hand Tool. The rest of the interface was closely modeled on MacPaint's, with a palette of familiar tools such as the Pencil, Paintbrush, and Paint Bucket, which have survived today in [[Adobe Systems]] [[Photoshop]]. FullPaint also introduced the screen modes (windowed, full screen with menubar, and full screen without menubar) and the iconic selectors for them which were later used in [[Photoshop]]. Like MacPaint, this was a black-and-white graphics application as the hardware available did not support true grayscale. Grays were simulated using a technique called [[dithering]]. ==See also== *[[MacPaint]] *[[FullWrite Professional]] *[[SuperPaint (Macintosh)]] *[[CricketPaint]] *[[List of old Macintosh software]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Fullpaint}} [[Category:Mac OS-only software]] [[Category:Raster graphics editors]] [[Category:Mac OS software]] [[Category:Discontinued software]] {{Mac-software-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>14334</id> <title>Full employment theorem</title> <text>In [[computer science]] and [[mathematics]], the term '''full employment theorem''' has been used to refer to a theorem showing that no algorithm can optimally perform a particular task done by some class of professionals. The name arises because such a theorem ensures that there is endless scope to keep discovering new techniques to improve the way a specific task is done. For example, the ''full employment theorem for compiler writers'' states that there is no such thing as a perfect size-optimizing compiler, as such a compiler would have to [[halting problem|detect non-terminating computations]] and reduce them to a one-instruction [[infinite loop]]. Thus, the existence of a perfect size-optimizing compiler would imply a solution to the [[halting problem]], which cannot exist, making it an [[undecidable problem]]. Similarly, [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] have been called full employment theorems for mathematicians. In [[theoretical computer science]] this field of study is known as [[Kolmogorov complexity]], or the smallest program which outputs a given string. Less formally, combative tasks such as virus writing and detection, and spam filtering and filter-breaking appear to be candidates for full employment. ==Additional examples== *[[No free lunch in search and optimization]] - no efficient general-purpose solver exists, and hence there is always scope for improving algorithms for better performance on particular problems. ==References== * Solomonoff, Ray, "[http://world.std.com/~rjs/z138.pdf A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference]", Report V-131, Zator Co., Cambridge, Ma.
