other volume structures such as the Catalog File or Extent Overflow File. The Volume Header is always located in the same place. # The '''Allocation File''' which keeps track of which allocation blocks are free and which are in use. It is similar to the Volume Bitmap in HFS, each allocation block is represented by one bit. A zero means the block is free and a one means the block is in use. The main difference with the HFS Volume Bitmap, is that the Allocation File is stored as a regular file, it does not occupy a special reserved space near the beginning of the volume. The Allocation File can also change size and does not have to be stored contiguously within a volume. # The '''Catalog File''' is a [[B-tree]] that contains records for all the files and directories stored in the volume. The HFS Plus Catalog File is very similar to the [[Hierarchical File System#Design|HFS Catalog File]], the main differences being records are larger to allow more fields and to allow for those fields to be larger (for example to allow the longer 255-character unicode file names in HFS Plus). A record in the HFS Catalog File is 512 bytes in size, a record in the HFS Plus Catalog File is 4KB in Mac OS and 8KB in Mac OS X. Fields in HFS are of fixed size, in HFS Plus the size can vary depending on the actual size of the data they store. # The '''Extents Overflow File''' is another [[B-tree]] that records the allocation blocks that are allocated to each file as extents. Each file record in the Catalog File is capable of recording eight extents for each fork of a file; once those are used extents are recorded in the Extents Overflow File. Bad blocks are also recorded as extents in the Extents Overflow File. The default size of an extent record in Mac OS is 1 KB and 4 KB in Mac OS X. # The '''Attributes File''' is a new [[B-tree]] in HFS Plus that does not have a corresponding structure in HFS. The Attributes File can store three different types of 4 KB records: ''Inline Data Attribute'' records, ''Fork Data Attribute'' records and ''Extension Attribute'' records. Inline Data Attribute records store small attributes that can fit within the record itself. Fork Data Attribute records contain references to a maximum of eight extents that can hold larger attributes. Extension Attributes are used to extend a Fork Data Attribute record when its eight extent records are already used. # The '''Startup File''' is designed for non-Mac OS systems that don't have HFS or HFS Plus support. It is similar to the Boot Blocks of an HFS volume. # The second to last sector contains the '''Alternate Volume Header''' equivalent to the Alternate Master Directory Block of HFS. # The last sector in the volume is reserved for use by Apple. It is used during the computer manufacturing process. == Other operating systems == === Linux === The [[Linux kernel]] includes the hfsplus module<ref>[http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=tree;f=fs/hfsplus;hb=HEAD Git Repository Kernel.org]</ref> for mounting HFS+ filesystems. HFS+ [[fsck]] and [[mkfs]] have been ported to [[Linux]] and are part of the hfsprogs package.<ref>[http://packages.debian.org/sid/hfsprogs User-space supporting tools for HFS+ filesystems under Posix systems.]</ref> The Linux HFS+ kernel driver has support to read and write to HFS+ non-journaled drives/parititions but only has read support of journaled HFS+. Journaling ability was added to HFSplus when OSX came out and is by default on for OS X installations. Journaling is a redundant behavior of a filesystem that helps protect data loss. If planning to write to an HFS+ parition or drive journaling must be turned off in OSX.<ref>http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=2346494</ref> === Windows === On Windows, a fairly complete filesystem driver for HFS+ exists as a commercial software package called MacDrive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediafour.com/products/macdrive/ |title=MacDrive |publisher=Mediafour |date= |accessdate=2010-07-05}}</ref> This package allows Windows users to read and write HFS+ formatted drives, and read Mac-format optical disks. Another solution is provided by Paragon, with their HFS+ for Windows driver; this supports both read and write on HFS+ partitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paragon-software.com/home/hfs-windows/ |title=HFS for Windows - file system driver &#124; PARAGON Software Group |publisher=Paragon-software.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-05}}</ref> Apple has released read-only HFS+ drivers for Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7 in [[Boot Camp (software)|Boot Camp]] in [[Mac OS X 10.6]]. Microsoft has created a HFS+ driver for the XBox 360 mainly for the purpose of reading HFS+ formatted iPods. A [[free software|free]] ([[GPL]]) alternative to MacDrive is HFSExplorer written by Erik Larsson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://catacombae.org/hfsx.html |title=Catacombae - HFSExplorer |publisher=Erik Larsson |date=2008-12-23 |accessdate=2010-12-19}}</ref> HFSExplorer is an application for viewing and extracting files from an HFS+ volume (Mac OS Extended) or an HFSX volume (Mac OS Extended, Case-sensitive) located either on a physical disk, on a .dmg disk image, or in a raw file system dump. HFSExplorer is less complete than MacDrive in the sense that it can read, but not write to HFS formatted volumes. == See also == * [[Comparison of file systems]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn1150.html Apple Technote 1150] - HFS Plus Volume Format * [http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn1189.html Apple Technote 1189] - The Monster Disk Driver Technote * [http://www.osxbook.com/software/hfsdebug/ hfsdebug] - A debugger for HFS Plus volumes by Amit Singh * [http://packages.debian.org/sid/hfsprogs hfsprogs] - Userspace support tools for HFS+ filesystems under Linux systems (adapted from Apple's native tools). * [http://apps.tempel.org/iBored/ iBored] - A disk editor and viewer supporting HFS Plus <br/><!-- Spacing for aesthetic purposes: so that bottom templates don't stick to text above it --> {{Mac OS X}} {{Mac OS}} {{Filesystem}} [[Category:Disk file systems]] [[Category:Mac OS]] [[Category:Mac OS X]] [[Category:Computer file systems]] [[ca:HFS Plus]] [[cs:HFS+]] [[de:HFS plus]] [[es:HFS+]] [[fr:HFS+]] [[ko:HFS 플러스]] [[it:HFS Plus]] [[ja:HFS Plus]] [[pt:HFS+]] [[ro:HFS Plus]] [[ru:HFS Plus]] [[sv:HFS Plus]] [[zh:HFS+]]</text> </page> <page> <id>16023</id> <title>HITAC S-810</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=October 2009}} The '''HITAC S-810''' is a [[Vector processor|vector]] [[supercomputer]] developed, manufactured and marketed by [[Hitachi]].
