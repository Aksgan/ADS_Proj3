location at the university grounds, which were locked down during the holidays.<ref name=gamegrene297/> In April 2009, Elfwood was re-launched in a new look and feel, with several important improvements at the site. In May 2009, Elfwood launched a completely revised set of simplified rules, accepting a much wider range of works and even out-of-genre items under a special 'Other Works' tab. The Extranet was taken down its functions fully transferred to the main site, replaced by a more user friendly upload interface and simpler moderation process. ==Site content== ===Artistic Display Areas=== Elfwood has three main display areas for creative work: * '''SciFi & Fantasy Art''' is the main section (it was formerly divided in two sections, "Lothlorien" for [[high fantasy]] art and "Zone 47" for science fiction and modern/futuristic fantasy art). * '''Wyvern's Library''' is for sci-fi and fantasy themed [[stories]] and [[poetry]], including short stories as well as longer novels broken up by chapters. * '''FanQuarter''' is devoted to [[fan art]] based on sci-fi or fantasy themed visual media such as games, [[movies]], [[cartoons]] or TV-shows. As of August 16, 2010, there were 941 separate galleries in SciFi & Fantasy Art<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elfwood.com/fantasy_art_galleries.html |title=FanArt Galleries |publisher=Elfwood.com |date= |accessdate=August 16, 2010}}</ref> and 148 galleries in FanQuarter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elfwood.com/fanq/fanart.html |title=SciFi and Fantasy Art Galleries |publisher=Elfwood.com |date= |accessdate=August 16, 2010}}</ref> ===Art and Writing Tutorials=== <!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Farplogosmall.png|right|thumb|FARP Logo {{deletable image-caption}}]] --> Elfwood currently host a sub section, called the "FARP" (Fantasy Art Resource Project), dedicated to articles on the creation of Fantasy and Science Fiction art and stories. It is a free guide to the techniques used by artists and writers of Elfwood in the creation of their work. The name is slightly misleading since the section also contain articles on writing and world creation in general, and includes art, writing, business, and other guides which may be useful to the amateur artist. It also features the history of art, tricks & tips, and so much more. === Community === ''The Twilight Tavern'', released in February 2008, is the official forum of Elfwood. Two other notable community projects of Elfwood were Elftown and ''Woodworks''. ====Elftown==== {{See also|Elftown}} [[Elftown]] started out as the official Elfwood social networking site in February 2002 by Henrik Wallin. Later on the projects became more like sister projects and the projects got physically split in 2007 when Elfwood's servers moved. ====''Woodworks''==== The Elfwood [[ezine]] ''Woodworks'' <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elfwood.com/woodworks/ |title=Woodworks |publisher=Elfwood.com |date= |accessdate=August 16, 2010}}</ref> was started in January 2002 by Georgette Tan, which featured articles, reviews, artwork and tutorials by Elfwood members. Tan later retired as Editor and Megan Larson took the position, leading Woodworks to its final issue in December 2004. It is now hosted in an inactive state at the main Elfwood site after the domain was finally shut down in late 2006. ==Statistics== In 2003, Elfwood had 6700 artists and 1300 writers. It logged 14500 sessions per day, each averaging 35 minutes in length. Sixty percent of the users were in the USA and most of the rest in Canada and Europe.<ref name=LHS>{{citation |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bdWpeA28Y1oC&pg=PA291 |title=Human factors and Web development |chapter=Live Help Systems |author=Johan Aberg, Nahid Shahmehri}}</ref> {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;" |- !
