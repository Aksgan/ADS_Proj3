Retrieved 7 July 2008.</ref> ==Biography== Playfair was born in 1759 in Scotland during [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]], a Golden Age in the arts, sciences, industry and commerce. He was the fourth son of the [[reverend]] James Playfair of the parish of Liff & Benvie near the city of [[Dundee]] in [[Scotland]]; his notable brothers were architect [[James Playfair]] and mathematician [[John Playfair]]. His father died in 1772 when William was 13, leaving the eldest brother John to care for the family and his education. After his [[apprenticeship]] with [[Andrew Meikle]], the inventor of the threshing machine, he became draftsman and personal assistant to [[James Watt]] in 1777 at 18.<ref name="IS97">[http://www.psych.utoronto.ca/~spence/Spence_Wainer_1997b.pdf Ian Spence and Howard Wainer (1997). "Who Was Playfair?". In: ''Chance'' 10, p. 35–37.]</ref> Playfair had a variety of careers. He was in turn a millwright, engineer, draftsman, accountant, inventor, silversmith, merchant, investment broker, economist, statistician, pamphleteer, translator, publicist, land speculator, convict, banker, ardent royalist, editor, blackmailer and journalist. On leaving Watt's company in 1782, he set up a silversmithing business and shop in London, which failed. In 1787 he moved to Paris, taking part in the [[storming of the Bastille]] two years later. He returned to London in 1793, where he opened a "security bank", which also failed. From 1775 he worked as a writer and pamphleteer and did some engineering work.<ref name="IS97"/> ==Work== Spence & Wainer in 2001 describe Playfair as "engineer, political economist and scoundrel" while "Eminent Scotsmen" calls him an "ingenious mechanic and miscellaneous writer." It compares his career with the glorious one of his older brother [[John Playfair]], the distinguished Edinburgh professor, and draws a moral about the importance of "steadiness and consistency of plan" as well as of "genius."<ref>Ian Spence and Howard Wainer (2001). "William Playfair". In: ''Statisticians of the Centuries''. C.C. Heyde and E. Seneta (eds.) New York: Springer. pp. 105–110.</ref> ===Bar chart=== Two decades before Playfair's first achievements, in 1765 [[Joseph Priestley]] had created the innovation of the first [[timeline]] charts, in which individual bars were used to visualize the life span of a person, and the whole can be used to compare the life spans of multiple persons. According to Beniger and Robyn (1978) "Priestley's timelines proved a commercial success and a popular sensation, and went through dozens of editions".<ref name="JRB78">James R.
