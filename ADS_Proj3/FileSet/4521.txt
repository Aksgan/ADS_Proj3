newcomer receiving the choice between them. As in the 1970s version, the contestant who had the pop-up surprise in her jack-in-the-box went on the Treasure Hunt. The player selected from one of the 66 boxes, and again was given the opportunity to sell the box back to Edwards for a cash payoff, now worth only between $500 and $1,000. In this version, the prizes were also of much lesser value than the 1970s series; however, winning the right to go on the Treasure Hunt also guaranteed a contestant the opportunity to play the next game for a chance to go on another one. Winning contestants frequently only won one or two [[home appliance]]s, a trip, or a small room package; the cars were scaled back to inexpensive models (especially the [[Chevrolet Chevette]]); there were also no longer checks worth less than the grand prize. However, a 52-day cruise valued over $18,000 was offered regularly, and was won at least once. The klunks, of course, remained. ===Grand prize reveal=== At the end of the show, if the check was not won, Geoff again visited with Emile Autouri to find out where the check was hidden, and again Autouri remained speechless except for saying "Yes, I did". On this version, Edwards would also bring small children up to try to get Emile to crack a smile, but still to no effect. Autouri, however, did play on to Geoff's teasing several times, once pretending to fall asleep while Geoff was talking to him. At the end of one episode in which the top prize was won during the second game, Autouri responded "Yes, I shall" when Geoff asked him to get another check ready for the next show. Finally, near the end of the series, Autouri broke character and asked for a [[cue card]], catching Edwards totally off guard. ==Episode status== The 1950s series is believed to have been [[wiping|wiped]] as per network practices. The March 20, 1958 and April 24, 1959 episodes are the only two known to exist of the original series. The syndicated versions remain intact and are held by [[Sony Pictures Television]] (as they own the Chuck Barris library). GSN has aired sporadic episodes from the 1970s version and nearly all of the 1980s version. ==Controversy== An incident often talked about regarding ''The New Treasure Hunt'' concerned a contestant on an April 1974 episode named Vera Augenbach, who fainted on-stage upon being told that she had won a 1937 [[Rolls-Royce car|Rolls-Royce]] Phantom convertible. This incident was replayed on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' as part of an exposé on the series; producer [[Chuck Barris]] expressed pride in the incident, given the show's premise. In addition to playing on the presumed emotionalism of female contestants, the decision of Barris to only allow women in the game was reportedly a safety precaution – he was concerned that a male contestant might become angered by the show's antics (presumably including being led by a skit, which typically ran for around five minutes or so, into a Klunk) and physically attack Edwards or other staffers. However, in an interview on Blog Talk Radio, Edwards said that men would most likely not show as much enthusiasm as the women, even if they won the grand prize. During the 1970s run, Barris told Edwards during the fourth season (1976–1977) that he wanted to make ''The New Treasure Hunt'' even more sadistic for the upcoming fifth season (1977–1978) – an example being that the contestant would be shown a very expensive car (such as a [[Rolls-Royce (car)|Rolls-Royce]], [[Ferrari]], or [[Mercedes-Benz]]) but, after the excitement subsided, revealing that the prize was only a small part of the vehicle (such as the rear-view mirror). Edwards refused and was initially fired, but Barris quickly went back on that decision and Edwards didn't miss any episodes. However, Edwards left on his own after the season and Barris, unwilling to replace him, canceled the series shortly thereafter. ==See also== *''[[Deal or No Deal]]''–Game show similar in concept to Chuck Barris' ''Treasure Hunt''. *''[[Let's Make a Deal]]''–Another game show similar in concept. ==External links== *[http://tv4u.com/show-video.asp?cid=21&sid=765&vid=2295&t=Treasure%20Hunt&cat=Game%20Show TV4U.com webpage with a complete episode of the '50s version of ''Treasure Hunt''] *[http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/TelevisionCity/5987/treasure.html&date=2009-10-25+11:07:24 Matt Kaiser's ''Treasure Hunt'' page, focusing on the 80s version] *{{IMDb name|tt0281473|''The New Treasure Hunt''}} *{{IMDb name|tt0283807|''Treasure Hunt''}} *[http://illustriousgameshowpage.com/treasurehunt.html Chuck Donegan's page outlining the rules of the show] *[http://members.tripod.com/lawbrosvidcapspage/gswitcheast.html Vidcaps of (The New)Treasure Hunt] ==References== {{reflist}} {{Use mdy dates|date=August 2010}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Treasure Hunt (Us Game Show)}} [[Category:American game shows]] [[Category:American Broadcasting Company network shows]] [[Category:NBC network shows]] [[Category:First-run syndicated television programs in the United States]] [[Category:1950s American television series]] [[Category:1956 television series debuts]] [[Category:1959 television series endings]] [[Category:1970s American television series]] [[Category:1973 television series debuts]] [[Category:1977 television series endings]] [[Category:1980s American television series]] [[Category:1981 television series debuts]] [[Category:1982 television series endings]] [[Category:Television series by Barris Industries]] [[Category:Television series by Sony Pictures Television]]</text> </page> <page> <id>38185</id> <title>Treasure hunt (game)</title> <text>{{Other uses|Treasure hunt (disambiguation)}} {{Refimprove|date=August 2008}} [[Image:Easter-Eggs-1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Children hunt for [[Easter eggs]] like these.]] A '''treasure hunt''' is one of many different types of games which can have one or more players who try to find hidden articles, locations or places by using a series of clues. This is a fictional activity; [[treasure hunting]] can also be a real life activity. Treasure hunt games may be an indoor or outdoor activity. Outdoors they can be played in a garden or the treasure could be located anywhere around the world. ==Children's games== [[Image:Puzzlehunt2003.jpeg|thumb|left|200px|A [[puzzlehunt]] is a type of treasure hunt game.]] A [[puzzlehunt]] is a typical treasure hunt game involving clues. Sometimes though a hunt may not have clues because of the age of the children. An example of this is an [[Easter egg hunt]] that is performed on a day near [[Easter]] Sunday. Young children just search for as many eggs as they can find whilst older children may have clues to one egg. Treasure hunt are sometimes organised by parents as a game to be played at children's parties. This could be in a range of formats; just searching
