process redesign==== Product and service offerings are constantly changing - and so are the processes to innovate, design, manufacture, and deliver them. Multiple, inter-dependent, and concurrent processes are too complex for traditional process mapping, but can be analyzed very quickly with the value network method. ====Reconfiguring the organization==== Mergers, acquisitions, downsizing, expansion to new markets, new product groups, new partners, new roles and functions - anytime relationships change, value interactions and flows change too <ref>Stabell, Charles B., and Fjeldstad, Ø. "Configuring value for competitive advantage: On chains, shops, and networks" Strategic Management Journal 19. [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/2193/ABSTRACT abstract] 1998</ref>. ====Supporting knowledge networks and communities of practice==== Understanding the transactional dynamics is vital for purposeful networks of all kinds, including networks and communities focused on creating knowledge value. A value network analysis helps [[communities of practice]] negotiate for resources and demonstrate their value to different groups within the organization. ====Develop scorecards, conduct ROI and cost/benefit analyses, and drive decision making==== Because the value network approach addresses both financial and non-financial assets and exchanges, it expands metrics and indexes beyond the lagging indicators of financial return and operational performance - to also include leading indicators for strategic capability and system optimization. ==See also== * [[Clayton Christensen]] * [[Creativity techniques]] * [[Complexity science]] * [[Economic network]] * [[Institutional]] * [[Interdependence]] * [[Knowledge]] * [[Open innovation]] * [[Organization]] * [[Social good]] * [[Social networks]] * [[Trade]] * [[Value (economics)]] * [[Value chain]] * [[Value conversion]] * [[Value network analysis]] ==External links== * [http://www.openvna.org/ OpenVNA] - the non-commercial, open network site leading value network standards, taxonomies, visualization, analytics, vocabulary, methods, tools and techniques. * [http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~wellman/netlab/ NetLab]- at the University of Toronto, studies the intersection of social, communication, information and computing networks. * [http://www.vernaallee.com/value_networks/Value_Conversion_JIC_online_version.pdf Value Network Analysis and Value Conversion of Tangible and Intangible Assets], Verna Allee. * [http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu CASOS] - Center for Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems at Carnegie Mellon. ==References== <references/> {{DEFAULTSORT:Value Network}} [[Category:Value]] [[Category:Social networks]] [[Category:Sociology]]</text> </page> <page> <id>39200</id> <title>Van Eck phreaking</title> <text>'''Van Eck phreaking''' is the process of [[eavesdropping]] on the contents of a [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] and [[LCD]] display by detecting its [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emissions]].

This caused the Dutch government to ban the use of NewVote [[computer]] [[voting machine]]s manufactured by [[SDU]] in the [[Dutch general election, 2006|2006 national elections]], under the belief that ballot information might not be kept secret.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/10/30/europe/EU_GEN_Netherlands_Voting_Machines.php Dutch government scraps plans to use voting computers in 35 cities including Amsterdam (Herald tribune, 30.

But Van Eck Phreaking Allowed Hacker To Record Votes (Techdirt, 23 November 2009)]</ref> == Basic principle == Information that drives the [[video display]] takes the form of [[high frequency]] electrical signals. These [[oscillating]] [[electric currents]] create [[electromagnetic radiation]] in the [[radio frequency|RF]] range. These [[radio]] [[radio waves|emission]]s are correlated to the [[video]] image being displayed, so, in theory, they can be used to recover the displayed image. === CRTs === In a [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] the image is generated by an [[electron beam]] that sweeps back and forth across the [[screen]]. The electron beam excites the [[phosphor]] coating on the glass and causes it to glow. The strength of the beam determines the brightness of individual [[pixel]]s (see [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] for a detailed description). The electric signal which drives the electron beam is amplified to hundreds of volts from TTL circuitry. This high frequency, high voltage signal creates electromagnetic radiation that has, according to Van Eck, "a remarkable resemblance to a broadcast TV signal".<ref name="emr"/> The signal leaks out from displays and may be captured by an antenna, and once [[Analogue television synchronization|synchronization pulses]] are recreated and mixed in, an ordinary analog television receiver can display the result. The sync can be recreated either through manual adjustment or by processing the signals emitted by [[electromagnetic coil]]s as they deflect the CRT's electron beam back and forth.<ref name="emr"/> In the paper, Van Eck reports that in February 1985 a successful test of this concept was carried out with the cooperation of the [[BBC]]. Using a van filled with electronic equipment and equipped with a [[Very high frequency|VHF]] [[antenna array]], they were able to eavesdrop from a "large distance". Van Eck phreaking and protecting a CRT display from it was demonstrated on an episode of [[Tech TV]]'s [[The Screen Savers]] on December 18, 2003.<ref>[http://g4tv.com/videos/8041/van-eck-phreaking Van Eck Phreaking]</ref><ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0zsgrAMQ7g The Screen Savers: Dark Tip - Van Eck Phreaking]</ref> === LCDs === In April 2004 new academic research has revealed that flat panel and laptop displays are also vulnerable to electromagnetic eavesdropping. The required equipment for espionage was constructed in a university lab for less than US$2000.<ref name=Kuhn2004>{{cite journal | author = Kuhn, M.G. | year = 2004 | title = Electromagnetic Eavesdropping Risks of Flat-Panel Displays | journal = 4th Workshop on Privacy Enhancing Technologies | pages = 23–25 | url = http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/pet2004-fpd.pdf }}</ref> == Countermeasures == [[Countermeasure]]s are detailed in the article on [[TEMPEST]], the [[National Security Agency|NSA]]'s standard on spy-proofing digital equipment. One countermeasure involves [[Electromagnetic shielding|shielding]] the equipment to minimize [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] emissions. Another method, specifically for video information, [[scramble]]s the signals such that the image is perceptually undisturbed, but the emissions are harder to [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineer]] into images. Examples of this include [[low-pass filter|low
