Graphics Adapter|CGA]] video) and 3-voice sound, but didn't use the PCjr [[cartridge (electronics)|cartridge]] ports. As the Tandy 1000 line outlasted the PCjr by many years (and in fact did not make it to market until shortly after IBM announced the discontinuation of the PCjr) these graphics and sound standards became known as "Tandy-compatible" or (for the graphics) "TGA" (standing for Tandy Graphics Adapter) and many software packages of the era listed their support for Tandy standard hardware on the package. Tandy 1000 computers were some of the first IBM PC clones to incorporate a complete set of basic peripherals on the motherboard using proprietary [[ASIC]]s, the forerunner of the [[chipset]]. All Tandy 1000 computers featured built-in Tandy video hardware with color graphics (CGA compatible with enhancements), enhanced sound (based on one of several variants of the Texas Instruments SN76496 sound generator), [[game port]]s compatible with those on the [[TRS-80 Color Computer]], an IBM-standard floppy disk controller supporting two drives, and a parallel printer port, all integrated into the motherboard. This is in addition to the hardware standard on the IBM PC, PC/XT, and PC/AT motherboards: keyboard interface, expansion slots, memory subsystem, DMA, interrupt controller, and math coprocessor socket. (Hard disks were high end, not standard, equipment for home computers until the late years of the Tandy 1000 line, explaining the absence of an integrated hard disk controller from most Tandy 1000 motherboards.) An IBM PC, XT or AT would require at least 4 expansion cards for similar hardware: one video graphics adapter card, one floppy disk controller (FDC) card, one serial and parallel port card, and one sound card with a joystick port. (A third-party multi-IO card might merge the ports and FDC onto one card.) Therefore, the 5 XT slots of the original Tandy 1000, 1000 TX, 1000 SX, and similar models remained available for other hardware, making them equivalent or better than the 8 slots in IBM's XT and AT models (which had 8 slots because the original PC's 5 proved inadequate.) The earlier models of the Tandy 1000 had a composite video output, and could be used with a color or monochrome composite monitor, or a TV with an RF modulator. The original 1000 and SX had a light-pen port. Unlike most PC clones, several Tandy 1000 computers had [[MS-DOS]] built into [[read-only memory|ROM]] and could boot in a few seconds. Tandy bundled [[DeskMate]], a graphical suite of consumer-oriented applications, with various Tandy 1000 models. The original line was equipped with the [[Intel 8088]] [[central processing unit|CPU]], which was later extended to faster clock speeds and also the [[Intel 8086|8086]] and [[Intel 80286|80286]] processors. Tandy 1000s (at least all early models) used [[Phoenix Technologies|Phoenix BIOS]]. Common models of the machine included the Tandy 1000, 1000 EX, 1000 HX, 1000 SX, 1000 TX, 1000 SL, 1000 RL, and 1000 TL. For most Tandy 1000 models other than the compact EX and HX that did not come already equipped with a hard drive, Tandy offered hard disk options in the form of "hardcards" that were installed in one of the computer's expansion slots and consisted of a controller and drive (typically a 3.5" MFM or RLL unit with a Western Digital controller) mounted together on a metal bracket. Although this arrangement provided a neat physical coupling between the controller and the disk, single-sector internal transfers and dependence on the speed of the host machine to transfer data to memory meant that a trial-and-error approach was still needed to set the disk [[interleave]] correctly to ensure optimum transfer rates. Even then, transfer rates could be as low as 40kB/s for 8088 and 8086 machines. Eventually, in 1993, Tandy Corporation sold its computer manufacturing business to [[AST Computers]], and all Tandy computer lines were terminated. This was done because changes in the market made it increasingly difficult for Tandy to make a profit on its computer line. When that occurred, Radio Shack stores began selling computers made by other manufacturers, such as [[Compaq]]. ==Selected Tandy 1000 Models== ===Tandy 1000=== The original Tandy 1000 was a large computer almost the size of the [[IBM PC]], though with a plastic case over a steel lower chassis to reduce weight. The original Tandy 1000 featured a proprietary keyboard port (using an 8-pin [[DIN connector]]) along with 2 joystick ports (using 6-pin DIN connectors) on the front of the case. The rear featured a RGB monitor connector (a standard 9-pin female D-shell compatible with [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]]/[[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] monitors), an RCA-style composite video-out connector, a single RCA-style monophonic line-level audio connector, a light pen port, and an edge-card connector used to attach a parallel printer. The printer port followed the old Centronics standard and was not fully compatible with the parallel port found on PCs. The original Tandy 1000 came standard with one internal 5.25" double density floppy disk drive, with an additional exposed internal bay usable for the installation of a second 5.25" disk drive (available as a kit from [[Radio Shack]]). The floppy drives used the old-fashioned method of selecting the drive number with jumpers instead of the IBM cable twist. 128k of memory was standard, with the computer accepting up to 768k of total memory with the addition of expansion cards. MS-DOS 2.11 and [[DeskMate]] 1.0 were included with the system. A later revision of the original Tandy 1000 model was the Tandy 1000A. ===Tandy 1000 HD=== The original Tandy 1000 (and many other models), like most home computers sold at the time, did not have a hard disk drive. The Tandy 1000 HD was essentially an original Tandy 1000 with a hard disk option factory installed. The factory hard disk had a capacity on the order of 10 or 20 MB. ===Tandy 1000 EX=== The Tandy 1000 EX was designed as an entry-level IBM compatible personal computer. The EX was a compact computer that had the keyboard and 5.25" floppy drive built into the computer casing. This form factor would have been familiar to users upgrading from [[home computers]] such
