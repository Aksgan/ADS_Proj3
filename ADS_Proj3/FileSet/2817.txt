MCA requires bachelors degree from any field of computer science like BCA(Bachelor in Computer Application) etc. MCA syllabus contains topics which helps the person to be a computer programmer, a software developer, software tester, web-developer, web designer, a game developer, graphic designer etc. The syllabus cantains the topics like program structures, operating systems, computer networks, system administration, system analysis, software structor-development, software testing, computer graphics, maths etc. A BCA and MCA holder is compared to Software Engineer and with knowledge of many activities in computer like hardware, networks, websites . As programming is the thing which developed everything that we see today on computer - "We use them and the programmer develops them". As programming language is the way of communication with computers and commanding them what to do and what not to. Computers can understand only this languages (programming). Programmer or Coder is the person who do all this things, for that they require a good logic and knowledge on computer progrmming. Programming is used to develop programs, softwares, websites, games and also used in writing codes for exploit writing in hacking.As Expert hackers use progamming to develop many hacking tools and writing Virus coding using programming languages. A BCA and MCA holder has more knowledge compared to software engineer,they are like an all rounder in the field of computers. This holder can get a good creative opportunity in the field of computers.<br />Some Universities/Institutes which offer excellent faculty, lab facilities and placements (through campus recruitment programme) are: • Banaras Hindu University<ref>BHU ,Syllabi for MCA ,http://www.bhu.ac.in/syllabus/MCA.pdf</ref> <br/> • BIT,Mesra,Ranchi <br /> • Cochin Univ of Science & Tech <br /> • IIT Roorkee (MCA) <br /> • Jawaharlal Nehru Univ(JNU),Delhi <br /> • NIT Allahabad <br /> • NIT Bhopal <br /> • NIT Calicut <br /> • NIT Durgapur <br /> • NIT Jamshedpur <br /> • NIT Kurukshetra <br /> • NIT Raipur <br /> • NIT Surathkal <br /> • NIT Trichy <br /> • NIT Warangal <br /> • Pondicherry Central University <br /> • University of Delhi <br /> • University of Hyderabad <br /> • University of Pune <br /> • Banasthali University<ref> Banasthali University ,Syllabi for MCA http://www.banasthali.org/banasthali/wcms/en/home/lower-menu/faculties/maths-app-comp-tech/maths-app-comp-tech_top/computer_science/academic_programs/mca_cs.html</ref> <br/> • VIT University Vellore <br /> • West Bengal University of Technology (WBUT) <br /> == Footnotes == {{Reflist}} Master of computer JAVED AHMED IBRAHIM CLASS 5 Gopalganj == References == {{Portal box|Computer science|Information technology}} * {{Cite conference | first = | last = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = AICTE Act | booktitle = AICTE Act | pages = Section 10(b) & 10(o) | publisher = | date = 1987 (52 of 1987) | location = | url = | doi = | id = | accessdate = }} * {{Cite court |litigants = |vol = No.F.37-3/Legal/2003 |reporter = |opinion = |pinpoint = |court = Supreme Court Judgement(s) |date = August 14, 2003 and October 31, 2002 |url= }} * {{Cite journal | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Policy framework,MHRD,Govt. of India | journal = vide No.F.17-18/2000.TS.I | volume = | issue = | pages = | publisher = | location = | date = October 10, 2003 | url = | issn = | doi = | id = | accessdate = }} {{Academic degrees}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Master Of Computer Applications}} [[Category:Master's degrees|Computer Applications, Master]] [[Category:Information technology education in India]] [[Category:Information technology qualifications]] [[Category:Information technology education]] {{edu-stub}} {{comp-sci-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>23653</id> <title>Mastermind (board game)</title> <text>{{Other uses|Mastermind (disambiguation)}} {{Infobox Game| | subject_name=Mastermind | image_link=[[File:Mastermind.jpg|200px]] | image_caption=A game of Mastermind completed. | players=2 | ages= 8 and up | setup_time= < 5 minutes | playing_time= 10-30 minutes | complexity=Easy | strategy=Low | random_chance=Some | footnotes = }} '''Mastermind''' or '''Master Mind''' is a [[code]]-breaking game for two players.
