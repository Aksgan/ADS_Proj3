as the [[POU domain]]. The various members of the POU family have a wide variety of functions, all of which are related to the development of an [[organism]]. POU6F2 is also known as [[Human accelerated regions|Human Accelerated Region]] 8. It may, therefore, have played a key role in differentiating Humans from Apes. ==Etymology== The acronym POU is derived from the names of three [[mammal]]ian transcription factors: * the [[pituitary|'''P'''ituitary]]-specific [[pituitary-specific positive transcription factor 1|Pit-1]] * the [[octamer transcription factor|'''O'''ctamer transcription factor]] proteins [[POU2F1|Oct-1]] and [[Oct-2]] (octamer sequence is ATGCAAAT) * the [[neural]] '''U'''nc-86 transcription factor from [[Caenorhabditis elegans]]. ==Diversity== POU domain [[genes]] have been described in organisms as divergent as ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', ''[[Drosophila]]'', ''[[Xenopus]]'', [[zebrafish]] and human but have not been yet identified in [[plants]] and [[fungi]]. There is a surprisingly high degree of amino acid sequence conservation (37%-42%) of POU homeodomains to the transcriptional regulator comS from the [[gram positive]] [[prokaryote]] [[Bacillus subtilis]].<ref name="pmid7937777">{{cite journal | author = D'Souza C, Nakano MM, Zuber P | title = Identification of comS, a gene of the srfA operon that regulates the establishment of genetic competence in Bacillus subtilis | journal = Proc.

It was originally based on [[DKBTrace]], written by David Kirk Buck and Aaron A. Collins. There are also influences from the earlier Polyray raytracer contributed by its author Alexander Enzmann. POV-Ray is [[freeware]] with the source code available. ==History== Sometime in the 1980s, David Kirk Buck downloaded the [[source code]] for a [[Unix]] raytracer to his [[Amiga]]. He experimented with it for a while, eventually deciding to write his own raytracer, named [[DKBTrace]] after his initials. He posted it to a [[bulletin board system]], thinking others might be interested in it. In 1987, Aaron A. Collins downloaded DKBTrace and began working on an [[x86]]-based port of it. He and David Buck collaborated to add several more features. When the program proved to be more popular than anticipated, they could not keep up with demand for more features. Thus, in July 1991 David turned over the project to a team of programmers. At the same time, he felt that it was inappropriate to use his initials on a program he no longer maintained. The name "STAR" (Software Taskforce on Animation and Rendering) was considered, but eventually the name became the "Persistence of Vision Raytracer", or "POV-Ray" for short.<ref>[http://www.povray.org/documentation/view/3.6.0/7/ POV-Ray: Documentation: 1.1.5 The Early History of POV-Ray<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> POV-Ray was the first ray tracer to render an image in [[Earth orbit|orbit]], rendered by [[Mark Shuttleworth]] inside the [[International Space Station]].<ref>[http://www.oyonale.com/iss.php Reach for the stars<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Features of the application and a summary of its history are discussed in an interview with David Kirk Buck and Chris Cason on episode 24 of [[FLOSS Weekly]].<ref>[http://twit.tv/floss24 The TWiT Netcast Network with Leo Laporte<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> ==Features== [[Image:Glasses 800 edit.png|thumb|300px|right|Glass scene rendered in POV-Ray, demonstrating radiosity, photon mapping, focal blur, and other photorealistic capabilities.]] POV-Ray has matured substantially since it was created. Recent versions of the software include the following features: * A [[Turing-completeness|Turing-complete]] scene description language (SDL) that supports macros and loops.<ref>[http://local.wasp.uwa.edu.au/~pbourke/geometry/supershape3d/ Paul Bourke: Supershape in 3D] are examples of POV-Ray images made with very short code</ref> * Library of ready-made scenes, textures, and objects * Support for a number of [[geometric primitive]]s and [[constructive solid geometry]] * Several kinds of [[light source]]s * Atmospheric effects such as [[fog]] and media ([[smoke]], [[clouds]]) * [[Reflection (physics)|Reflection]]s, [[refraction]]s, and light [[caustic (optics)|caustics]] using [[photon mapping]] * Surface patterns such as [[wrinkle]]s, bumps, and [[ripple]]s, for use in [[Procedural texture|procedural textures]] and [[bump mapping]] * [[Radiosity (3D computer graphics)|Radiosity]] * Image format support for [[Texture (visual arts)|textures]] and rendered output, including [[Truevision Targa file format|TGA]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[JPEG]] (only input) among others * Extensive user documentation One of POV-Ray's main attractions is its large collection of third party support. A large number of tools, textures, models, scenes, and tutorials can be found on the web. It is also a useful reference for those wanting to learn how [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] and related geometry and graphics algorithms work. ===Current version=== The current official version of POV-Ray is 3.6. Some of the main features of this release: * Extends [[UV mapping]] to more primitives. * Adds 16 and 32 bit integer data to density file. * Various [[bugfix]]es and speed-ups. * Improved 64-bit [[computer compatibility|compatibility]]. Beta-testing of version 3.7 is underway as of July 2008. The main improvement over 3.6 will be [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]] support to allow the renderer to take advantage of multiple processors. Additionally, support
