be modestly robust, but also to have a low information capacity due to host [[Interference (communication)|interference]]. A digital watermarking method is said to be of ''quantization type'' if the marked signal is obtained by quantization. Quantization watermarks suffer from low robustness, but have a high information capacity due to rejection of host interference. A digital watermarking method is referred to as ''[[Amplitude Modulation|amplitude modulation]]'' if the marked signal is embedded by additive modification which is similar to spread spectrum method, but is particularly embedded in the spatial domain. == Evaluation and benchmarking == The evaluation of digital watermarking schemes may provide detailed information for a watermark designer or for end-users, therefore, different evaluation strategies exist. Often used by a watermark designer is the evaluation of single properties to show, for example, an improvement. Mostly, end-users are not interested in detailed information. They want to know if a given digital watermarking algorithm may be used for their application scenario, and if so, which parameter sets seems to be the best. ==Secure digital camera== A secure digital camera (SDC) was proposed by Mohanty, et al. in 2003 and published in January 2004.<ref name=VLSID2004> {{citation |url=http://www.cse.unt.edu/~smohanty/research/ConfPapers/2004/MohantyVLSID2004Chip.pdf |title=VLSI Implementation of Visible Watermarking for a Secure Digital Still Camera Design |author=Saraju P.

This would make the images acceptable for legal purposes.

Inspection is a critical step in [[product development]] and [[quality control]]. Dimensional Metrology requires the use of a variety of physical scales to determine dimension, with the most accurate of these being holographic etalons or laser interferometers. The realization of dimension using these accurate scale technologies is the end goal of dimensional metrologists. Early [[metrologist]]s would often create a central measurement standard based on a yard stick or meter. For example, early Egyptian meter sticks where based on a piece of metal that was the size of the Pharaoh's forearm called a [[Cubit]]. Carpenters were some of the first dimensional inspectors as seen today. Modern measurement equipment includes; hand tools, CMM ([[Coordinate-Measurement Machine]]), and optical comparators. For hand tools, see [[Caliper]] and [[micrometer]]. A CMM is based on [[CNC]] technology to automate measurement of Cartesian coordinates from physical contact with the part. Optical comparators are used when physically touching the part is undesirable. Optical comparators can now build 3D models of a scanned part and internal passages using x-ray technology. Furthermore, optical 3d (laser) scanners are becoming more and common. By using a light sensitive detector (e.g. digital camera) and a light source (laser, line projector) the triangulation principle is employed to generate 3d data, which is evaluated in order to compare the measures against nominal geometries. Data is collected in or compared to a print. A print is a blueprint illustrating crucial features. Prints can be hand drawn or automatically generated by a [[CAD]] model. ==See also== * [[Mechanical Engineering]] ==References== {{Unreferenced|article|date=July 2008}} ==Notes== <references/> {{Measurement-stub}} == External links == *[http://www.coherix.com/auto/surfacedetective/index.htm Description of a high-definition dimensional metrology technology ] *[http://www.zeiss.com An example
