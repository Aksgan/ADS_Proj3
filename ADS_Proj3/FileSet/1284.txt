is of particular note that in order for this type of cooling to be effective, a closed-loop system was required. ETA had to innovate to make this possible, since there were not any commercially available solutions in the market. The 44-layer PCB was also innovative, and ETA had to develop new processes to manufacture it. Each CPU had its own 4 million word local memory built from SRAM ICs. Each CPU is also connected to a 256 million word shared memory built from DRAM ICs. In addition to these memories, there is a ''communication buffer'' used for CPU synchronization and other multiprocessor-related protocol communication. I/O was facilitated by one to eighteen I/O processors that each have a direct path to the shared memory. The ETA10 used [[fiber-optic]] lines for communication between the CPUs and I/O devices, a novel approach for systems interconnection in the 1980s. ==Installations== Before ETA Systems was reincorporated into CDC, a total of 25 systems were delivered. Among the recipients were: * [[Florida State University]] (took delivery of the first ETA10 system, serial number 1, on January 5, 1987) * [[Johnson Space Center]] * [[John von Neumann Supercomputer Center]] (when no buyers could be found for the two ETA10 machines at this center, they were destroyed with sledgehammers to prevent illicit use) * [[Purdue University]] (contributed to ETA System V, the [[System V]] [[UNIX]] variant that ran on the ETA10). * [[Tokyo Institute of Technology]] Took delivery of an 8 CPU liquid cooled system in 1988 * [http://www.sinica.edu.tw/main_e.shtml Academia Sinica] * [[Deutscher Wetterdienst]] By the end of the 1980s, the remaining ETA10 systems were donated to high schools through a [[computer science]] competition, [[SuperQuest]]: * [[Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology]] ==See also== * [[EOS (operating system)|EOS]], the operating system ETA Systems developed in-house ==References== {{no footnotes|date=December 2010}} *R.W.

Such applications are characterized by some specificities that traditional approaches fail to manage, while also give opportunity for additional optimization; namely: a) the possibility for multiple sources for the same content and the establishment of multiple connections among peers, b) the continuous change in the structure of the overlay networks and c) the cooperation between several Internet Service Providers (ISPs). These motivated and necessitated the development of Economic Traffic Management (ETM), a new approach to manage P2P (peer-to-peer) traffic. ETM employs mechanisms that after taking into consideration the application requirements, the traffic characteristics and the charging schemes between ISPs, provide the appropriate incentives to all stakeholders (ISPs, Application Providers and Users) for cooperation in order to optimize the use of network resources while reaching a mutually beneficial situation (TripleWin). == The ETM mechanisms == ETM mechanisms that project [[SmoothIT project|SmoothIT]] develops focus on two classes of applications that appear to be among the major contributors of Internet traffic, namely Peer-to-Peer file sharing and Peer-to-Peer Video-on-Demand. The mechanisms that these applications use for the selection of content-pieces (referred to as chunks) and peers to get these chunks from, are those that influence the traffic patterns. (in particular, peer-to-peer file-sharing and VoD mechanisms use [[tit-for-tat]] and give-to get respectively.) Therefore, such mechanisms are employed by ETM as a means to influence traffic favourably for all involved participants. Furthermore, the charging schemes between ISPs constitute a significant factor as well. Under certain interconnection agreements between ISPs, the proliferation of P2P traffic may lead to increased expenses. This constitutes one of the main reasons and incentives for the ISPs to adopt ETM mechanisms and thus control P2P traffic patterns and the relevant interconnection charges. Therefore, an ETM mechanism should take into account both the structure of this charging scheme and the aforementioned mechanisms employed by the applications. A prominent charging scheme for transit agreements is that based on the [[95th percentile]] of either the inbound traffic or of its difference with the outbound traffic. An integral part of each ETM mechanism is the provision of the appropriate incentives to the stakeholders in order to adopt the mechanism, cooperate (either implicitly or explicitly) with each other and provide the information that is needed. Begging with the ISPs, the incentives of an ETM mechanism have to be strong and the tradeoff between their gain and the possible cost that will be imposed to them (for running the mechanism) has to be maximized in order for the mechanism to be adopted. The strongest incentive concerns the reduction of overlay traffic and inter-domain traffic that will lead to minimized charges of inter-domain costs. Furthermore, ETM may lead to less congested links and of course to better performance, which in combination with reduced prices will affect favorably their reputation. Concerning providers of overlay applications, an active role to the traffic management through the provision of information and the adoption of ETM mechanisms can be expected if it results in the improvement of service quality which can also lead to a better reputation. Finally, for the users of overlay applications, ETM mechanisms provide monetary incentives, that is lower prices for network access which derive from the reduction of the costs of the ISPs and as well incentives related to improved performance and quality and experience. == Related work == * SmoothIT web page: http://www.smoothit.org. {{DEFAULTSORT:Economic Traffic Management}} [[Category:Electronic commerce| ]] [[Category:Marketing]] [[Category:Information technology management]] [[Category:Web applications]] [[Category:Web development]]</text> </page> <page> <id>11522</id> <title>EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing</title> <text>{{Infobox Journal | cover = | discipline = [[signal processing]], [[image processing]], [[pattern recognition]], [[robotics]] | abbreviation =
