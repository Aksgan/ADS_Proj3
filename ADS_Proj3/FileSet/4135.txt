lower importance) is affected. * Cosmetic - The system works correctly, but the appearance does not match the expected one. For example: wrong colors, too much or too little spacing between contents, incorrect font sizes, typos, etc. This is the lowest priority issue. In many software companies, issues are often investigated by [[Quality assurance|Quality Assurance Analysts]] when they verify a system for correctness, and then assigned to the developer(s) that are responsible for resolving them. They can also be assigned by system users during the [[Acceptance testing|User Acceptance Testing (UAT)]] phase. Issues are commonly communicated using [[Issue tracking system|Issue]] or Defect Tracking Systems. In some other cases, emails or instant messengers are used. ==Philosophy== As a subdiscipline of project management, some regard the management of software development akin to the management of [[manufacturing]], which can be performed by someone with management skills, but no programming skills. [[John C. Reynolds]] rebuts this view, and argues that software development is entirely [[design]] work, and compares a [[Management|manager]] who cannot [[Programmer|program]] to the [[managing editor]] of a [[newspaper]] who cannot [[write]].<ref>John C. Reynolds, ''Some thoughts on teaching programming and programming languages'', [[SIGPLAN]] Notices, Volume 43, Issue 11, November 2008, p.108: "Some argue that one can manage software production without the ability to program. This belief seems to arise from the mistaken view that software production is a form of manufacturing. But manufacturing is the repeated construction of identical objects, while software production is the construction of unique objects, i.e., the entire process is a form of design. As such it is closer to the production of a newpaper — so that a software manager who cannot program is akin to a managing editor who cannot write."</ref> ==See also== *[[Estimation]] *[[Estimation in software engineering]] *[[Incremental funding methodology]] *[[Issue management]] *[[Project management]] *[[Risk management]] *[[Software development process]] *[[Software engineering]] *[[Anti-pattern]] - A number of anti-patterns (ineffective and/or counter-productive design patterns) directly relate to software project management and the software development process in general. *[[NNPP]] Net-Negative-Producting-Programmer; jargon related to concepts from Software Project Management ==External links== * Resources on Software Project Management from Steve McConnell: http://www.construx.com/Page.aspx?nid=22 * Resources on Software Project Management from [[Dan Galorath]]: http://www.galorath.com/wp/category/project-management ==References== {{reflist}} *{{citebook|title=Software project management in practice|first=Pankaj|last=Jalote|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=2002|ISBN=0201737213}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Software Project Management}} [[Category:Software]] [[Category:Project management]] [[hu:Szoftverprojekt-menedzsment]] [[vi:Quản lý dự án phần mềm]]</text> </page> <page> <id>35048</id> <title>Solar eclipse</title> <text>{{About|the astronomical phenomenon|the video game|Solar Eclipse (video game)}} [[File:Geometry of a Total Solar Eclipse.svg|thumb|300px|Geometry of a Total Solar Eclipse (not to scale)]] [[File:Solar eclips 1999 4 NR.jpg|thumb|Photo of [[Solar eclipse of August 11, 1999|1999 total eclipse]]]] As seen from the [[Earth]], a '''solar [[eclipse]]''' occurs when the [[Moon]] passes between the [[Sun]] and the Earth, and the Moon fully or partially covers the Sun as viewed from a location on Earth. This can only happen during a [[new moon]], when the Sun and Moon are in [[conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] as seen from Earth. At least two, and up to five, solar eclipses occur each year; no more than two can be total eclipses.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Littmann | first = Mark | coauthors = Fred Espenak, Ken Willcox | title = Totality: Eclipses of the Sun | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2008 | pages = 18–19 | isbn = 0199532095}}</ref><ref>Five solar eclipses occurred in 1935. {{Cite book|chapterurl=http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEcat5/SE1901-2000.html|last=[[NASA]]|chapter=Five Millennium Catalog of Solar Eclipses|date=6 September 2009|title=[http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse.html NASA Eclipse Web Site]|others=[[Fred Espenak]], Project and Website Manager|accessdate=26 January 2010}}</ref> Total solar eclipses are nevertheless rare at any particular location because totality exists only along a narrow path on the Earth's surface traced by the Moon's [[umbra]].

The [[solar eclipse of August 11, 1999]], in [[Europe]] helped to increase public awareness of the phenomenon{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}, which apparently led an unusually large number of journeys made specifically to witness the annular [[solar eclipse of October 3, 2005]], and [[solar eclipse of March 29, 2006|of March 29, 2006]]. The last total solar eclipse was the [[solar eclipse of July 11, 2010]]; the next will be the [[solar eclipse of November 13, 2012]]. The recent [[solar eclipse of January 4, 2011]], was a partial eclipse (''see [[Solar eclipse#Types|Types]] below''); the next partial eclipse will occur on [[Solar eclipse of June 1, 2011|June 1, 2011]]. A total solar eclipse is a [[natural phenomenon]]. Nevertheless, in ancient times, and in some cultures today, solar eclipses have been attributed to [[supernatural]] causes or regarded as bad [[omen]]s. A total solar eclipse can be frightening to people who are unaware of their [[astronomy|astronomical]] explanation, as the Sun seems to disappear during the day and the sky darkens in a matter of minutes. ==Types== <!--This section linked from [[Template:Lists of solar eclipses]]--> [[File:Ecl-ann.jpg|thumb|[[Solar eclipse of October 3, 2005|Annular solar eclipse on October 3, 2005]]]] There are four types of solar eclipses: * A ''total eclipse'' occurs when the dark silhouette of the Moon completely obscures the intensely bright disk of the Sun, allowing the much fainter solar [[corona]] to be visible. During any one eclipse, totality only occurs at best in a narrow track on the surface of the Earth. * An ''annular eclipse'' occurs when the Sun and Moon are exactly in line, but the apparent size of the Moon is smaller than that of the Sun. Hence the Sun appears as a very bright ring, or [[annulus (mathematics)|annulus]], surrounding the outline of the Moon. * A ''hybrid eclipse'' (also called ''annular/total eclipse'') shifts between a total and annular eclipse. At some points on the surface of the Earth it appears as a total eclipse, whereas at others it appears as annular. Hybrid eclipses are comparatively rare. * A ''partial eclipse'' occurs when the Sun and Moon are not exactly in line and the Moon only partially obscures the Sun. This phenomenon can usually be seen from a large
