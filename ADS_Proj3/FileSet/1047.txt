and YSFX were part of its feature set. <br /> 1992 - Power Windows.<br /> 1992 - Custom Curves.<br /> 1994 - da Vinci wholly acquired the TLC product line from Time Logic. The TLC is viewed as the defacto standard edit control interface between telecines, color correctors, VTRs and DDRs. TLC (really stands for "Time Logic Controller") is a edit controller for telecines, vision mixers (switchers), and VTRs. It provides accurate 2:3 editing when transferring 24fps film in a 30fps video environment. TLC 1 was originally made in Moorpark, CA (started in Redondo Beach, then Simi Valley). In 1994, the TLC product line was acquired by da Vinci and the TLC 2 was released. <br /> 1995 - 8:8:8 DUI was introduced to the market. The DUI offered the same color processing as the Renaissance 8:8:8 but featured a new "windows style" user interface, an SGI hosted operating system, a migration of the external TLC controller into the DUI, and EDWIN, an extension of the industry renowned Power Windows. The telecine interface card controlled the telecine's internal color corrector. The 888 DUI came in two configurations; the first was the DUI with an SGI Indy workstation. The second DUI system used an SGI O2 workstation (affectionately called the "Toaster"). These systems supported da Vinci's new Control Panels. da Vinci also made the da Vinci Light. This was not marketed, so not many were sold. It is a da Vinci DUI 888 without the digital 888 cards. The da Vinci DUI 888 had the electrical equivalent of the TLC2 designed on the IMC (along with Telecine Interface) boards. The ability to edit, control VTRs, switchers, and use an EDL were all software options to the DUI. <br /> 1996 - Dynatech sells the Dynatech Video Group, except da Vinci Systems.<br /> 1998 - The da Vinci 2K, the company's first high definition and data color grading system for film and video was released. It offered a huge boost in color processing quality and performance. New features like PowerTiers, Defocus and Colorist Toolbox were presented to the market. These features, unmatched by any competitive product, have become the standard which other companies now attempt to emulate. Feature filmmakers began to use the da Vinci 2K in the color grading finishing process, a process that would later become known as "digital intermediate" or DI. The 2K was designed to work for SD, HD and Data and to have room for future upgrades. Base system has In/Out Primaries, Secondaries, New Power Windows and a new interface. Originally controlled by an SGI 02, it must now be upgraded to Linux for the latest software updates. The 2K was to have a newly designed machine control system also called TLC. Since this functionality was a bit late to completion, the ability to use the external TLC2 connected to the 2K provided some necessary breathing room. It was this configuration that required the A/B RS-422 switch box in the Tape to Tape configuration, allowing the TLC2 to synchronize the decks, while the 2K provided the necessary frame accurate color corrections.<br /> 1998 - da Vinci Academy formed.<br /> 1999 - Power Tiers Option. Add up to 8 channels, each with Power Windows, full Primary and Master Secondary control. 1999 - da Vinci acquires Sierra Design Labs, Incline Village NV.<br /> 2000 - Defocus Option. In or Out Defocus or Sharpness effects (In and Out with Defocus Plus) plus Power Windows, In/Out color and matte defocus. Defocus is adjustable, but includes realtime Gaussian blur in HD.<br /> 2000 - da Vinci acquires Nirvana Digital of Singapore, creator of the Revival film restoration system, and incorporates the product into its line up.<br /> 2001 - PowerGrade.<br /> 2001 - Gallery Option. Integrated reference store, with optional Central Server and Palette paint program interface. Windows interface converts stills between resolutions and export them as jpg, tiff or bmp files. Standard on all 2K Plus systems. <br /> 2002 - 2K Plus created to support HDTV and SDTV, uses an IBM PC computer running Red Hat Linux interface software. The 2k Plus is used on high-end DataCines and telecines, Like Thomson-Grass Valley's [[Spirit DataCine]] and Cintel's C-Reality & ITK Millennium. The 2k can operate in with a 4:2:2, 4:4:4 or 8:4:4 input in NTSC or PAL. In HDTV it can operate with 4:2:2, 4:4:4 input. Redesigned Primaries, Secondaries and Keys make this more than just a 2K upgrade. Linux control interface is standard.<br /> 2002 - TLC Assistant. External Linux terminal with keyboard and mouse for those that need permanent access to the editor. Single and Dual user modes.<br /> 2002 - Colorist Toolbox Option. Hardware upgrade for those that have outgrown the Defocus option. Adds 4 Power Vectors, each with its own matte Defocus, Power Windows, In/Out Master Secondaries, Filter Effects and Textures. The Filters include the equivalent of a Defocus Plus board.<br /> 2003 - Acterna filed bankruptcy. <br /> 2003 - Resolve. Software Color Corrector.<br /> 2003 - Nucleas. Server to Server software enables 2K systems to work from data disks and storage networks. HiPPI and HSDL interfaces. System includes data waveforms, CMS and data playback.<br /> 2004 - Resolve, a software based, resolution independent color grading system is launched. Resolve, developed specifically for the DI market, operates on conventional PC hardware but with optimized performance via da Vinci's own custom designed PC based PowerPlant acceleration and Transformer image translation hardware. Resolve offers color enhancement at the core but also features a highly advanced toolset including conforming, network file browsing, image resizing and formatting.<br /> da Vinci also creates Nucleas Conform, which builds a data timeline from an EDL, renders dissolves and allows switching between Source and Record order. System was shown at NAB configured as Server to Server and Server to Video.<br /> 2005 - JDSU acquires Acterna.<br /> 2005 - Toolbox 2 Option. Toolbox 2 has an improved interface and includes filter presets. It is even easier and faster to use, and comes free with
