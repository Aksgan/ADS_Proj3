This number is at most 2''n'', since if 2''n'' + 1 points are placed in the grid some row will contain three points. ==Lower bounds== [[Paul Erdős]] (in Roth, 1951) observed that, when ''n'' is a prime number, the set of ''n'' grid points (''i'', ''i''<sup>2</sup> mod ''n''), for 0 ≤ ''i'' < ''n'', contains no three collinear points. When ''n'' is not prime, one can perform this construction for a ''p'' × ''p'' grid contained in the ''n'' × ''n'' grid, where ''p'' is the largest prime that is at most ''n''. As a consequence, for any ε and any sufficiently large ''n'', one can place :(1 − ε)''n'' points in the ''n'' × ''n'' grid with no three points collinear. Erdős' bound has been improved subsequently: Hall et al. (1975) show that, when ''n''/2 is prime, one can obtain a solution with 3(''n'' - 2)/2 points by placing points on the [[hyperbola]] ''xy'' ≡ ''k'' (mod ''n''/2) for a suitable ''k''. Again, for arbitrary ''n'' one can perform this construction for a prime near ''n''/2 to obtain a solution with :(3/2 − ε)''n'' points. ==Conjectured upper bounds== Guy and Kelly (1968) conjectured that one cannot do better, for large ''n'', than ''cn'' with :<math>c = \sqrt[3]{\frac{2\pi^2}{3}} \approx 1.874.</math> As recently as March, 2004, Gabor Ellmann notes an error in the original paper of Guy and Kelly's heuristic reasoning, which if corrected, results in :<math>c = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt 3} \approx 1.814.</math> ==Applications== The [[Heilbronn triangle problem]] asks for the placement of ''n'' points in a unit square that maximizes the area of the smallest triangle formed by three of the points. By applying Erdős' construction of a set of grid points with no three collinear points, one can find a placement in which the smallest triangle has area :<math>\frac{1-\epsilon}{2n^2}.</math> ==Generalizations== A noncollinear placement of ''n'' points can also be interpreted as a [[graph drawing]] of the [[complete graph]] in such a way that, although edges cross, no edge passes through a vertex. Erdős' construction above can be generalized to show that every ''n''-vertex ''k''-colorable graph has such a drawing in a ''O(n)'' x ''O(k)'' grid (Wood 2005). Non-collinear sets of points in the three-dimensional grid were considered by Pór and Wood (2007). They proved that the maximum number of points in the ''n'' x ''n'' x ''n'' grid with no three points collinear is <math>\Theta(n^2)</math>. Similarly to Erdős's 2D construction, this can be accomplished by using points (x, y, x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>) mod p, where p is a prime congruent to 3 mod 4. One can also consider graph drawings in the three-dimensional grid. Here the non-collinearity condition means that a vertex should not lie on a non-adjacent edge, but it is normal to work with the stronger requirement that no two edges cross (Pach et al. 1998; Dujmović et al. 2005; Di Giacomo 2005). ==Small values of ''n''== For ''n'' ≤ 40, it is known that 2''n'' points may be placed with no three in a line. The numbers of solutions (not counting reflections and rotations as distinct) for small ''n'' = 2, 3, ..., are :[[1 (number)|1]], [[1 (number)|1]], [[4 (number)|4]], [[5 (number)|5]], [[11 (number)|11]], [[22 (number)|22]], [[57 (number)|57]], [[51 (number)|51]], [[156 (number)|156]], [[158 (number)|158]], 566, 499, 1366, ... {{OEIS|id=A000769}}. ==References== * {{cite book | author = Dudeney, Henry | authorlink = Henry Dudeney | title = Amusements in Mathematics | year = 1917 | location = Edinburgh | publisher = Nelson}} * {{cite journal | title = Computing Straight-line 3D Grid Drawings of Graphs in Linear Volume | journal = Comput.
