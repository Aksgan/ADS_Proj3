Tin Mandigma, editor-in-chief of E-turo.org explained that it is an e-learning portal which "seeks to provide free and quality learning materials online to teachers and students; it gives teachers access to lesson plans and modules based on textbook materials published by Vibal Publishing House, Inc. amid plans to offer Department of Education-approved content from various learning institutions as supplementary teaching materials. One of the most common complaints of teachers is that while the Internet has so much information, most of it cannot be adapted to the local classroom. With this project, we hope to help teachers sort through the clutter and give them quality information that would be useful for their students."<ref>[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=121529 abs-cbnnews.com, RP e-learning portal launched on Independence Day]</ref> ===Differences from Wikipedia=== Although it is modeled after Wikipedia, WikiPilipinas differs from it in distinct ways.

One of the key pillars of Wikipedia is that articles be written from a [[neutral point of view]], a major difference in [[encyclopedia]] models. WikiPilipinas supports the concept of [[original research]], something Wikipedia forbids. WikiPilipinas encourages users to, "''present their own research and findings on the site''" and expects adequate references from editors for factual information. In addition, the site does not have the [[Wikipedia:Notability]] concept that is another cornerstone of Wikipedia. Articles about practically anything are allowed on the site.<ref name="MST20070904"/> Also, WikiPilipinas' conceptualization is far removed from that of an [[academic]] [[encyclopedia]].

The site initially used the [[Plone (software)|Plone content management system]] the production of articles was deemed too slow under the system. In September 2006, plans to shift the system to use the [[wiki]]-model were conceived (after the founding of Filipiniana.net) by its New York-based founder Gaspar Vibal and [[webmaster]] Richard Grimaldo.<ref>[http://www.yehey.com/News/print.aspx?id=177982 www.yehey.com, Wiki comes to the Philippines]</ref> Octogenarian book publisher Esther A. Vibal, founder of Vibal Publishing House (VPHI), and mother of [[Gaspar Vibal]] learned about online publishing and knowledge sharing. She introduced the concepts through Gaspar's Filipiniana.net and WikiPilipinas.org, the world’s biggest Philippine encyclopedia available on the Web.<ref>[http://business.inquirer.net/money/topstories/view/20080426-132901/Business-lessons-from-an-octogenarian Inquirer.net, Business lessons from an octogenarian]</ref> The actual conceptualization of WikiPilipinas (then-Wikipiniana) occurred in February 2007. In planning, [[MediaWiki]] was officially selected to be the site's platform and it was decided that the site were to be modeled after the [[Wikipedia]]. Instead of a complete [[WP:FORK|fork]] of Wikipedia however, Wikipiniana was to be a "hipper" and "freer" version, including [[almanac]] lists and [[directories]].<ref name="BM20070823"/> The WikiPilipinas team, headed by Grimaldo as webmaster and Alfred Ursua as its managing editor, drew up an initial masterlist of priority contents for Project Wikipiniana.<ref>[http://isulong-seoph.aboutmyrecovery.com/2007/08/23/wikipilipinas-profile/ isulong-seoph.aboutmyrecovery.com, WikiPilipinas Profile]</ref> The project officially began on March 15, 2007.
