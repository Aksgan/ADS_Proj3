It runs on [[Linux]] and other [[POSIX]]-compliant systems. == Features == Its most prominent feature is "simplicity". It is built on top of a single internal [[data type]] (cell), without giving up flexibility and expressive power. On the language level, it supports just three data types (numbers, symbols and lists), constructed from internal cells. Because the only [[S-expression|non-atomic]] data type is the linked list, many interoperable functions exist that concentrate on [[list processing]]. As a result, PicoLisp programs are often more succinct - and at the same time faster - than those of other interpreted languages (see examples in [http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:PicoLisp rosettacode.org]). [[Function (computer science)|Functions]] are free from the restrictions that would be imposed by a [[compiler]], and can so accept arbitrary types and numbers of arguments. Macros are needed only in rare cases. A special feature is the intrinsic [[database]] functionality. Persistent symbols are [[first-class object]]s, they are loaded from database files automatically when accessed, and written back when modified. Applications are written using a [[class hierarchy]] of [[Entity-relationship model|entities and relations]]. Furthermore: [[Prolog]] engine and database queries, distributed databases, inlining of [[C (programming language)|C language]] functions and native C function calls, child process management, [[interprocess communication]], Browser GUI, [[Internationalization and localization|internationalization]]. == History == Originally developed on the [[Apple Macintosh]] in the 1980s, and used in commercial application development since then. It was soon ported to [[MS-DOS]] and [[SCO Unix]], and used mainly on Linux since 1993. Database functionality was added in the mid-1990s. While the first versions were written in a mix of C and [[Assembly language]], a first rewrite from scratch was done in 1999 completely in C. That version was released 2002 under the [[GNU GPL]] license, and changed to a MIT/X11 license in 2010. In 2009 the [[64-bit]] version was released, another rewrite, this time written in a generic assembler which in turn is implemented in PicoLisp. A [[Java (programming language)|Java]] version was released in December 2010.[http://software-lab.de/ersatz/README] == External links == *[http://home.picolisp.com PicoLisp Home] *[http://software-lab.de/picoLisp.tgz Latest Version] (immediate download) *[http://software-lab.de/down.html Download page] *[http://www.software-lab.de/doc/ref.html Reference manual] *[http://www.software-lab.de/doc/faq.html Frequently asked questions] *[http://www.prodevtips.com/2008/03/28/pico-lisp/ First Glance] *[irc://irc.freenode.net/picolisp #picolisp IRC channel] *[http://www.mail-archive.com/picolisp@software-lab.de Mailing list archive] *[https://www.ohloh.net/p/PicoLisp ohloh project page] == References == {{Reflist}} *[http://software-lab.de/radical.pdf Paper] A Radical Approach to Application Development (PDF) *[http://www.heise.de/kiosk/archiv/ct/2006/13/190 c't Magazine] Database contest results (in German) *[http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2124 Lambda the Ultimate 2007] A Case for Minimalist Interpreters? *[http://john.freml.in/teepeedee2-vs-picolisp John Fremlin's blog] PicoLisp takes the performance crown?

The chip is known for its effective use of [[Memory (computers)|memory]], using very little memory to store graphical data. It was rather advanced for its time when the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] (Japanese version of the Nintendo Entertainment System) was released, sporting full [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] support, movable backgrounds, and many colors on screen at the same time. To compete with other video game systems, like the technically superior [[Sega Master System]], [[Nintendo]] also extended the PPU's technical capabilities through the use of [[Multi-Memory Controller|mappers]], which were placed on the game cartridge. The mappers added more memory or could bank switch data into the PPU's [[address space]], making it possible to create more advanced graphics, using more colors and bigger [[tile set]]s. ==Key features== *2KB external [[RAM]] for graphics information storage *256 bytes for [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] data storage *32 bytes for palette storage *8 × 8 or 8 × 16 (selectable) sized [[tile]]s *Two 4KB [[tile set]]s with space for 256 tiles each *Up to 64 sprites (movable objects) on screen simultaneously (only
