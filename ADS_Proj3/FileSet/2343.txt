It was equally possible to locate servers that held no security and were openly sharing personal identifiable information such as [[Social Security number]]s and [[credit card]] numbers. These efforts grew into the creation of the [http://johnny.ihackstuff.com/ghdb/ Google Hacking Database], through which hundreds of Google hacking search terms are stored. The field of Google hacking has evolved over time to not just using Google to passively search for vulnerable servers, but to actually use Google search queries to attack servers. == Published works == Long has contributed to the following published works: * ''Google Hacking for Penetration Testers'', Syngress Publishing, 2004.

The movement was realized after a viewing of ''[[Invisible Children]]'', a documentary movie that showcases many brutalities committed in northern [[Uganda]] that have remained invisible to the global media. Along with coordinating the donation of goods and supplies, Johnny traveled to areas of Africa to personally setup computer networks and help build village infrastructures. == Personal life == Long is known to publicly pronounce his faith in [[Christianity]].

The DOE JGI also collaborates with other national labs such as [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (ORNL) and [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]] (PNNL). In 1999, the [[University of California]], which manages the three national labs for the DOE, leased laboratory and office space in a light industrial park in [[Walnut Creek, California]] to consolidate genome research activities. Led by [[Edward Rubin|Eddy Rubin]], M.D., Ph.D., the DOE JGI receives its funding from the Office of Biological and Environmental Research in DOE's Office of Science. Originally established to work on the [[Human Genome Project]]--the DOE JGI generated the complete sequences of Chromosomes 5, 16 and 19—the DOE JGI has since shifted its focus to the non-human components of the biosphere, particularly those relevant to the DOE's science mission. Since 2004, the DOE JGI has been a user facility that advances genomics research in a broad range of disciplines where DNA sequence information is likely to drive scientific discoveries. In February 2004, the DOE JGI launched the Community Sequencing Program (CSP), which provides the scientific community at large with access to high-throughput, high-quality sequencing. Sequencing projects involve many important multicellular organisms, microbes and communities of microbes called [[Metagenome|metagenomes]] related to the DOE mission areas of [http://www.energy.gov/energysources/bioenergy.htm bioenergy], understanding global cycles such as the [[carbon cycle]] and [[biogeochemistry]], and are chosen based on outside scientific review. Microorganisms such as those that thrive under extreme conditions such as high acidity, radiation and metal contamination are of particular interest to the DOE. Investigations by the DOE JGI and its partners are shedding light on the cellular machinery of microbes and how they can be harnessed to clean up contaminated soil or water, capture carbon from the atmosphere and produce potentially important sources of energy such as hydrogen and methane. In 2006, the DOE JGI published the genome of the [http://www.jgi.doe.gov/News/news_9_14_06.html first tree sequenced]--the cottonwood ([[Poplar|Populus trichocarpa]]). In partnership with other federal institutions and universities, the DOE JGI has also published the genome sequences of sorghum; the microbial community in the termite hindgut, which could provide enzymes useful to biofuel production; microbes such as the bacteria ''Desulfovibrio'' that clean up sites contaminated with radioactive or toxic compounds; and algae involved in the
