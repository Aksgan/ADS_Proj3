The column families are fixed when a Cassandra database is created, but columns can be added to a family at any time. Furthermore, columns are added only to specified keys, so different keys can have different numbers of columns in any given family. The values from a column family for each key are stored together, making Cassandra a hybrid between a [[column-oriented DBMS]] and a row-oriented store.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} == History == Cassandra was developed at [[Facebook]] to power their Inbox Search feature by Avinash Lakshman (one of the authors of Amazon's Dynamo) and Prashant Malik. It was released as open source project on [[Google code]] in July 2008.<ref name=JH2008 /> In March 2009, it became an [[Apache Incubator]] project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mail-archive.com/cassandra-dev@incubator.apache.org/msg00004.html |title=Is this the new hotness now? |publisher=Mail-archive.com |date=2009-03-02 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}</ref> On February 17, 2010 it graduated to a top-level project.<ref name=GRAD /> == Features == === Decentralized === Every node in the cluster is identical. There is no [[single point of failure]]. === Fault-tolerant === Data is automatically replicated to multiple nodes for fault-tolerance. Replication across multiple data centers is supported. Failed nodes can be replaced with no downtime. === Tunable consistency === Writes and reads offer a tunable level of consistency, all the way from "writes never fail" to "block for all replicas to be readable", with the quorum level in the middle. === Elasticity === Read and write throughput both increase linearly as new machines are added, with no downtime or interruption to applications. == Data model == A table in Cassandra is a distributed multidimensional map indexed by a key. The value is an object which is highly structured. The row key in a table is a string with no size restrictions, although typically 16 to 36 bytes long. Every operation under a single row key is atomic per replica no matter how many columns are being read or written into. Columns are grouped together into sets called column families very much similar to what happens in the [[BigTable]] system. Cassandra exposes two kinds of column families, Simple and Super column families. Super column families can be visualized as a column family within a column family. The top dimension in Cassandra is called Keyspace. Therefore Cassandra can handle maps with 4 or 5 dimensions: Map with 4 dimensions: # Keyspace -> Column Family # Column Family -> Column Family Row # Column Family Row -> Columns # Column -> Data value Map with 5 dimensions: # Keyspace -> Super Column Family # Super Column Family -> Super Column Family Row # Super Column Family Row -> Super Columns # Super Column -> Columns # Column -> Data value The first dimension - Keyspace -> (Super) Column Family - is limited to a (small) set of schema-predefined keys. Cassandra documentation mentions similarities of this dimension with the table definition inside a relational database. Furthermore, applications can specify the sort order of columns within a Super Column or Simple Column family. The system allows columns to be sorted either by time or by name. Time sorting of columns is exploited by applications like [[Facebook]] Inbox Search where the results are always displayed in time sorted order. Any column within a column family is accessed using the convention column_family : column and any column within a column family that is of type super is accessed using the convention column_family : super_column : column. == Prominent users == * [[Facebook]] uses Cassandra to power Inbox Search, with over 200 nodes deployed.<ref name=FBIS /> * [[Digg]], a large social news website, announced on Sep 9th, 2009 that it is rolling out its use of Cassandra<ref name=NM2009>{{cite web |url=http://blog.digg.com/?p=966 |title=Looking to the future with Cassandra |author=Ian Eure }}</ref> and confirmed this on March 8, 2010.<ref name=DG2010>{{cite web |url=http://about.digg.com/node/564 |title=Saying Yes to NoSQL; Going Steady with Cassandra |author=John Quinn }}</ref> [[TechCrunch]] has since linked Cassandra to Digg v4 reliability criticisms and recent company struggles.<ref name=ES2010>{{cite web|url=http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/07/digg-struggles-vp-engineering-door/|title=As Digg Struggles, VP Of Engineering Is Shown The Door|author=Erick Schonfeld}}</ref> Lead engineers at Digg later rebuked these criticisms as red herring and blamed a lack of load testing.<ref name=QU2010>{{cite web|url=http://www.quora.com/Is-Cassandra-to-blame-for-Digg-v4s-technical-failures/|title=Is Cassandra to Blame for Digg v4's Failures?}}</ref> * [[Twitter]] announced it is planning to use Cassandra because it can be run on large server clusters and is capable of taking in very large amounts of data at a time.<ref name=TWITTER>{{cite web|last=Popescu |first=Alex |url=http://nosql.mypopescu.com/post/407159447/cassandra-twitter-an-interview-with-ryan-king |title=Cassandra @ Twitter: An Interview with Ryan King |publisher=myNoSQL |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}</ref><ref name=TWITTER2>{{cite web|last=Babcock |first=Charles |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/open_source/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=223100894&pgno=1&queryText=&isPrev= |title=Twitter Drops MySQL For Cassandra - Cloud databases |publisher=InformationWeek |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}</ref> Twitter continues to use it but not for Tweets themselves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://engineering.twitter.com/2010/07/cassandra-at-twitter-today.html|title=Cassandra at Twitter Today}}</ref> * [[Rackspace]] is known to use Cassandra internally.<ref name=SURVEY>{{cite web|url=http://n2.nabble.com/Cassandra-users-survey-td4040068.html |title=Nabble - cassandra-user@incubator.apache.org - Cassandra users survey |publisher=N2.nabble.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}</ref> * [[Cisco]]'s [[WebEx]] uses Cassandra to store user feed and activity in near real time.<ref name=CISCO>{{cite web|url=http://www.mail-archive.com/cassandra-dev@incubator.apache.org/msg01163.html |title=Re: Cassandra users survey |publisher=Mail-archive.com |date=2009-11-21 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}</ref> * [[IBM]] has done research in building a scalable email system based on Cassandra.<ref name=IBM>{{cite web|url=http://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://ewh.ieee.org/r6/scv/computer//nfic/2009/IBM-Jun-Rao.pdf |title=Powered by Google Docs |publisher=Docs.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}</ref> * [[Reddit]] switched to Cassandra from [[memcacheDB]] on March 12, 2010<ref
