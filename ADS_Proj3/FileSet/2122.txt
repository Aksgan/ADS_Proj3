phase correlation uses the [[fast Fourier transform]] to compute the cross-correlation between the two images, generally resulting in large performance gains. The method can be extended to determine rotation and scaling differences between two images by first converting the images to [[Log-polar coordinates|log-polar]] coordinates. Due to properties of the [[Fourier transform]], the rotation and scaling parameters can be determined in a manner invariant to translation. === Single- vs. multi-modality methods === Another classification can be made between single-modality and multi-modality methods. Single-modality methods tend to register images in the same modality acquired by the same scanner/sensor type, while multi-modality registration methods tended to register images acquired by different scanner/sensor types. Multi-modality registration methods are often used in [[medical imaging]] as images of a subject are frequently obtained from different scanners. Examples include registration of brain [[Computed tomography|CT]]/[[MRI]] images or whole body [[Positron emission tomography|PET]]/[[Computed tomography|CT]] images for tumor localization, registration of contrast-enhanced [[Computed tomography|CT]] images against non-contrast-enhanced [[Computed tomography|CT]] images for segmentation of specific parts of the anatomy, and registration of [[ultrasound]] and [[Computed tomography|CT]] images for [[prostate]] localization in [[radiotherapy]]. === Automatic vs. interactive methods === Registration methods may be classified based on the level of automation they provide. Manual, interactive, semi-automatic, and automatic methods have been developed. Manual methods provide tools to align the images manually. Interactive methods reduce user bias by performing certain key operations automatically while still relying on the user to guide the registration. Semi-automatic methods perform more of the registration steps automatically but depend on the user to verify the correctness of a registration. Automatic methods do not allow any user interaction and perform all registration steps automatically. === Similarity measures for image registration === Image similarities are broadly used in [[medical imaging]]. An image similarity measure quantifies the degree of similarity between intensity patterns in two images.<ref name="AG"/> The choice of an image similarity measure depends on the modality of the images to be registered. Common examples of image similarity measures include [[cross-correlation]], [[mutual information]], sum of squared intensity differences, and ratio image uniformity. Mutual information and normalized mutual information are the most popular image similarity measures for registration of multimodality images. Cross-correlation, sum of squared intensity differences and ratio image uniformity are commonly used for registration of images in the same modality. == Uncertainty == There is a level of [[uncertainty]] associated with registering images that have any spatio-temporal differences. A confident registration with a measure of uncertainty is critical for many [[change detection]] applications such as medical diagnostics. In remote sensing applications where a digital image pixel may represent several kilometers of spatial distance (such as NASA's [[LANDSAT]] imagery), an uncertain image registration can mean that a solution could be several kilometers from ground truth. Several notable papers have attempted to quantify uncertainty in image registration in order to compare results.<ref name="simonson">Simonson, K., Drescher, S., Tanner, F., A Statistics Based Approach to Binary Image Registration with Uncertainty Analysis. IEEE Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2007</ref><ref name="Domokos">Domokos, C., Kato, Z., Francos, J., Parametric estimation of affine deformations of binary images. Proceedings of IEEE [[International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing]], 2008</ref> However, many approaches to quantifying uncertainty or estimating deformations are computationally intensive or are only applicable to limited sets of spatial transformations. == Applications == Image registration has applications in remote sensing (cartography updating), and computer vision. Due to the vast applications to which image registration can be applied, it is impossible to develop a general method that is optimized for all uses. [[Medical imaging|Medical image]] registration (for data of the same patient taken at different points in time such as change detection or tumor monitoring)) often additionally involves ''elastic'' (also known as ''nonrigid'') registration to cope with deformation of the subject (due to breathing, anatomical changes, and so forth). Nonrigid registration of medical images can also be used to register a patient's data to an anatomical atlas, such as the [[Jean Talairach|Talairach]] atlas for neuroimaging. It is also used in [[astrophotography]] to align images taken of space. Using control points (automatically or manually entered), the computer performs transformations on one image to make major features align with a second image. Image registration is essential part of Panoramic image creation. There are many different techniques that can be implemented in real time and run on embedded devices like cameras and camera-phones. == See also == {{Portal|Free software}} * [[Spatial normalization]] ==References== <references/> ==External links== *Richard Szeliski, [http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=75695 Image Alignment and Stitching: A Tutorial].

Image schemas are formed from our bodily interactions, from linguistic experience, and from historical context. The term is explained in [[Mark Johnson (professor)|Mark Johnson]]'s book ''The Body in the Mind'', in case study 2 of [[George Lakoff]]'s ''Women, Fire and Dangerous Things'' and by [[Rudolf Arnheim]] in ''Visual Thinking''. In contemporary [[cognitive linguistics]], an image schema is considered an embodied prelinguistic structure of experience that motivates [[conceptual metaphor]] mappings. Evidence for image schemata is drawn from a number of related disciplines, including work on cross-modal cognition in [[psychology]], from spatial cognition in both [[linguistics]] and psychology, and from [[neuroscience]]. ==Johnson: From image schemas to abstract reasoning via metaphor== [[Image:OutSchemas.png|175px|thumb|''Figure 2'' - Containment Image Schema (as applied to the English word ''out'')]] {{cleanup-laundry|section|date=February 2008}} Image schemas are dynamic embodied patterns—they take place ''in'' and ''through'' time. Moreover, they are multi-modal patterns of experience, not simply visual. For instance, consider how the dynamic nature of the containment schema is
