In addition to proper [[Linda (coordination language)|Linda]] implementations, these include other systems such as the following: * [http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-concurrent-collections-for-cc/ Intel Concurrent Collections (CnC)] is a programming model based on "item collections" which resemble tuple spaces, but are single assignment (tuples may not be removed or replaced). Because of this restriction Concurrent Collections has a deterministic execution semantics, but has difficulties with storage deallocation. * [[Category:Parallel computing]]</text> </page> <page> <id>21687</id> <title>Linda B.

Buck''', [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], (born January 29, 1947) is an [[United States of America|American]] [[biologist]] best known for her work on the [[olfactory system]]. She was awarded the 2004 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]], along with [[Richard Axel]], for their work on [[olfactory receptor]]s. In their landmark paper published in 1991, Buck and Axel [[cloning|cloned]] olfactory receptors, showing that they belong to the family of [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s. By analyzing [[rat]] [[DNA]], they estimated that there were approximately one thousand different [[gene]]s for olfactory receptors in the [[mammal]]ian [[genome]]. This research opened the door to the [[genetics|genetic]] and [[molecular biology|molecular]] analysis of the mechanisms of [[olfaction]]. In their later work, Buck and Axel have shown that each [[olfactory receptor neuron]] remarkably only expresses one kind of olfactory receptor protein and that the input from all neurons expressing the same receptor is collected by a single dedicated [[glomerulus (olfaction)|glomerulus]] of the [[olfactory bulb]]. Born in [[Seattle, Washington]], Buck received her [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in [[psychology]] and [[microbiology]] in 1975 from the [[University of Washington]], Seattle and her [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[immunology]] in 1980 from the [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas]]. She did her [[post-doctoral]] work at [[Columbia University]] under Axel. In 1991 Buck became an assistant professor of neurobiology at Harvard University where she expanded her knowledge of the nervous system.<ref>http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2004/buck-autobio.html</ref> Her primary research interest is on how [[pheromone]]s and [[odor]]s are detected in the nose and interpreted in the brain. She is a Full Member of the Basic Sciences Division at [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]], an Affiliate Professor of [[Physiology]] and [[Biophysics]] at the [[University of Washington]], Seattle and an Investigator of the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]]. She was inducted into the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 2004. {{Expand section|date=March 2008}} ==See also== * [[List of female Nobel laureates]] ==References== <div class="references-small"> * Buck L, Axel R.

On discrete media, such as [[pixel]]-based [[computer display|display]]s and [[computer printer|printer]]s, line drawing requires such an approximation (in nontrivial cases). On continuous media, by contrast, no algorithm is necessary to draw a line. For example, [[oscilloscope]]s use natural phenomena to draw lines and curves. ==A na&iuml;ve line-drawing algorithm== <code> dx = x2 - x1 dy = y2 - y1 '''for''' x '''from''' x1 '''to''' x2 { y = y1 + (dy) * (x - x1)/(dx) plot(x, y) } </code> It is assumed here that the points have already been ordered so that <math>x_2 > x_1</math>. This algorithm works just fine when <math>dx >= dy</math> (ie., slope is less than or equal to 1), but if <math>dx < dy</math> (ie., slope greater than 1), the line becomes quite sparse with lots of gaps, and in the limiting case of <math>dx = 0</math>, only a single point is plotted! The na&iuml;ve line drawing algorithm is inefficient and thus, slow on a digital computer. Its inefficiency stems from the number of operations and the use of floating-point calculations. Line drawing algorithms such as [[Bresenham's line algorithm|Bresenham]]'s or
