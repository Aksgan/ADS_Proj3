The American Association for the Advancement of Science, in a position statement describing the events around the controversy, said "Given these associations, Dr. Sternberg would appear to be, at very least, an advocate for 'intelligent design' and critical of standard peer review processes as they bear on the scientific assessment of the 'intelligent design' hypothesis."<ref name="aaas_pr_statement">[http://www.aaas.org/spp/dser/03_Areas/evolution/issues/peerreview.shtml Intelligent Design and Peer Review] [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]</ref> Critics describe Sternberg's explanation of events, that a pro-intelligent design paper just happened to find its way to a publication with a sympathetic editor ultimately responsible for ensuring proper peer review and editing of his last issue, and that he decided it was appropriate to deal with the review process in person on a subject in which he has a personal interest, as improbable and that "people who want us to believe that the publication process outlined [by Sternberg and his defenders] was transparent and only had to do with science" are "disingenuous."<ref name="bottaro_comment"/> Journalist [[Chris Mooney (journalist)|Chris Mooney]] has compared the Sternberg controversy to that of a paper published by [[Climate change denial|climate change skeptic]]s [[Willie Soon]] and [[Sallie Baliunas]] in ''Climate Change'', where a sympathetic editor [[Chris de Freitas]] allowed it to be published, despite its lack of scientific merit.<ref>[http://www.csicop.org/doubtandabout/deja-vu/ Déjà vu All Over Again], [[Chris Mooney (journalist)|Chris Mooney]], September 13, 2004</ref> == Smithsonian controversy == After the peer review controversy became public, Sternberg filed a religious discrimination complaint against the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of Natural History]], where he had an unpaid appointment as a research associate,<ref>[http://www.nmnh.si.edu/rtp/other_opps/intern/associates04.html Natural History Research Associates Alphabetical Listing 2004], [[Smithsonian Institution]] [[National Museum of Natural History]]</ref><ref name="coddington">[http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/02/sternberg_vs_sm.html#comment-14871 Sternberg vs. Smithsonian], Jonathan Coddington, [[The Panda's Thumb (blog)|The Panda's Thumb]]</ref> while employed by the [[National Institutes of Health]].<ref>{{Cite news | last = Powell | first = Michael | title = Editor Explains Reasons for 'Intelligent Design' Article| newspaper = Washington Post| pages = A19| year = 2005 | date = 19 August| url =http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/18/AR2005081801680.html | postscript = <!--None-->}}.</ref><ref>[http://aapsonline.org/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Store_Code=AOAPAS&Category_Code=Sternberg Association of American Physicians and Surgeons: Richard Sternberg<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>Barbara Bradley Hagerty.

It was determined that as an unpaid research associate at the Smithsonian, Sternberg was not actually an employee, and thus the Office of Special Counsel had no jurisdiction. [[Nick Matzke]], Jason Rosenhouse and other critics have commented that the Office of Special Counsel itself appears biased in its initial handling of the matter, given the links between the [[Christian right|religious right]] and the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], with [[George W.
