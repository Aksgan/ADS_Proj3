in which the zombie sub-genre experienced a resurgence: the ''[[Resident Evil (film)|Resident Evil]]'' movies (2002, 2004, 2007, 2010); the [[Dawn of the Dead (2004 film)|''Dawn of the Dead'' remake]] (2004), the British films ''[[28 Days Later]]'' and ''[[28 Weeks Later]]'' (2002, 2007)<ref name="guardian2">{{cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,2073292,00.html|title=A capital place for panic attacks|accessdate=2007-05-12|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|author=Mark Kermode | location=London | date=May 6, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{ cite web | title = Stylus Magazine’s Top 10 Zombie Films of All Time | url = http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/movie_review/stylus-magazines-top-10-zombie-films-of-all-time.htm }}</ref> and the comedy/homage ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' (2004). The new interest allowed Romero to create the fourth entry in his zombie series: ''[[Land of the Dead]]'', released in the summer of 2005. Romero has recently returned to the beginning of the series with the films ''[[Diary of the Dead]]'' (2008) and ''[[Survival of the Dead]]'' (2010). The depiction of zombies as biologically infected people has become increasingly popular, likely due to the ''28 Days Later'' and ''Resident Evil'' series. 2006's ''[[Slither (2006 film)|Slither]]'' featured zombies infected with alien parasites, and 2007's ''[[Planet Terror]]'' featured a zombie outbreak caused by a biological weapon. The comedy films ''[[Zombie Strippers]]'', ''[[Zombieland]]'' and ''[[Fido (film)|Fido]]'' have also taken this approach. Zombies in recent popular culture have considerably increased their locomotion, as exampled in recent movies like ''[[28 Days Later]]'' (and its sequel, ''[[28 Weeks Later]]''), the [[Dawn of the Dead (2004 film)|''Dawn of the Dead'' remake]], ''[[House of the Dead (film)|House of the Dead]]''<ref name=josh>[http://www.slate.com/id/2180271/ The Running Dead - How did movie zombies get so fast?] By Josh Levin Posted Wednesday, Dec. 19, 2007, at 7:34 AM ET</ref>, ''[[Zombieland]]'' and the video game ''[[Left 4 Dead]]''. In contrast, zombies have historically been portrayed as slow. As part of this resurgence, there have been numerous [[direct-to-video]] (or [[DVD]]) zombie movies made by low-budget filmmakers using [[digital video]]. A proliferation of 'documentary-style' zombie films has resulted, including ''The Zombie Diaries'', ''American Zombie'' and ''[[Colin (film)|Colin]]'', each taking distinct approaches to the undead phenomenon. ==The modern zombie in print and literature== {{seealso|List of zombie novels}} Though zombies have appeared in many books prior to and after ''Night of the Living Dead'', it wouldn't be until 1990 that zombie fiction emerged as a distinct literary subgenre, with the publication of ''[[Book of the Dead (anthology)|Book of the Dead]]'' in 1990 and its follow-up ''Still Dead: Book of the Dead 2'' in 1992, both edited by horror authors [[John Skipp]] and [[Craig Spector]]. Featuring Romero-inspired stories from the likes of [[Stephen King]] and other famous names, the ''Book of the Dead'' compilations are regarded as influential in the horror genre and perhaps the first true "zombie literature". Recent zombie fiction of note includes [[Brian Keene]]'s 2005 novel ''[[The Rising (Keene novel)|The Rising]]'', followed by its sequel ''City of the Dead'', which deal with a worldwide apocalypse of intelligent zombies, caused by demonic possession. Though the story took many liberties with the zombie concept, ''The Rising'' proved itself to be a success in the subgenre, even winning the 2005 Bram Stoker award.<ref>Past Stoker Nominees & Winners http://www.horror.org/stokerwinnom.htm</ref> Famed horror novelist [[Stephen King]] has mined the zombie theme, first with 1990's "[[Home Delivery (short story)|Home Delivery]]", written for the aforementioned ''Book of the Dead'' compilation and detailing a small town's attempt to defend itself from a classic zombie outbreak. In 2006 King published ''[[Cell (novel)|Cell]]'', which concerns a struggling young artist on a trek from [[Boston]] to [[Maine]] in hopes of saving his family from a possible worldwide zombie outbreak, created by "The Pulse", a global electromagnetic phenomenon that turns the world's cellular phone users into bloodthirsty, zombie-like maniacs. ''Cell'' was a number-one bestseller upon its release<ref>''[[The New York Times]]'', 12 Feb. 2006</ref> Aside from ''Cell'', the most well-known current work of zombie fiction is 2006's ''[[World War Z]]'' by [[Max Brooks]], which was an immediate hit upon its release and a New York Times bestseller<ref>''The New York Times'', 15 Nov. 2006</ref>. Brooks had previously authored the cult hit ''[[The Zombie Survival Guide]]'', an exhaustively researched, zombie-themed parody of pop-fiction survival guides published in 2003.<ref name="USA Today" /> Brooks has said that zombies are so popular because: {{Quote|Other monsters may threaten individual humans, but the living dead threaten the entire human race.... Zombies are slate wipers.}} [[David Wellington (author)|David Wellington]]'s trilogy of zombie novels began in 2004 with ''[[Monster Island (novel)|Monster Island]]'', followed by two sequels, ''[[Monster Nation (novel)|Monster Nation]]'' and ''[[Monster Planet (novel)|Monster Planet]]''. The Monster Trilogy reveals the flesh-eating urge of the zombie is caused by a desire for life force, a golden energy that is found in living organisms. When pushed, Wellington's zombies will even consume plant matter. The reader is informed of this golden energy via the accounts of Liches, individuals who have voluntarily or involuntarily managed to maintain the flow of oxygen to the brain during death and emerge 'zombified' yet intelligent. [[Jonathan Maberry]]'s ''Zombie CSU: The Forensics of the Living Dead'', released in August 2008, interviewed over 250 experts in forensics, medicine, science, law enforcement, the military and similar disciplines to discuss how the real world would react, research and respond to zombies. In the fantasy trilogy ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' by [[Philip Pullman]], a zombie is described as a human who has been artificially separated from his soul (which, in the alternate world of the novels, takes the form of a visible animal-shaped companion called ''[[Dæmon (His Dark Materials)|dæmon]]'') by means of a process called ''[[intercision]]''. When the intercision is performed on an adult, the victim is prived of many human characteristics, most notably his free will. Some African tribes traditionally use this process in order to create slaves that will work day and night without ever running away or complaining, and with no fear of death or injury. The novels' main villain, [[Marisa Coulter]], also uses intercision to create apathic and obedient servants, bodyguards and soldiers. [[J. K. Rowling]] includes zombies, known as [[Inferius|Inferi]], in the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince|sixth book]] of her Harry Potter series. The Inferi are dead humans who are
