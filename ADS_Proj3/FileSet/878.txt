alternative approach, based on [[security engineering]] principles. ==Security and systems design== Many current real-world computer security efforts focus on external [[threat (computer)|threats]], and generally treat the computer system itself as a [[trusted system]]. Some knowledgeable observers consider this to be a disastrous mistake, and point out that this distinction is the cause of much of the insecurity of current computer systems â€” once an attacker has subverted one part of a system without fine-grained security, he or she usually has access to most or all of the features of that system. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Because computer systems can be very complex, and cannot be guaranteed to be free of [[Software bug|defect]]s, this [[security stance]] tends to produce insecure systems. ===Financial cost=== Serious financial damage has been caused by computer [[security breaches]], but reliably estimating costs is quite difficult. Figures in the billions of dollars have been quoted in relation to the damage caused by [[malware]] such as [[computer worm]]s like the [[Code Red worm]], but such estimates may be exaggerated. However, other losses, such as those caused by the compromise of [[credit card]] information, can be more easily determined, and they have been substantial, as measured by millions of individual victims of [[identity theft]] each year in each of several nations, and the severe hardship imposed on each victim, that can wipe out all of their finances, prevent them from getting a job, plus be treated as if ''they'' were the criminal. Volumes of victims of [[phishing]] and other scams may not be known. Individuals who have been infected with [[spyware]] or [[malware]] likely go through a costly and time-consuming process of having their computer cleaned. Spyware is considered to be a problem specific to the various Microsoft Windows operating systems{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}, however this can be partially explained by the fact that Microsoft controls a major share of the PC market and thus represents the most prominent target. ===Reasons=== There are many similarities (yet many fundamental differences) between computer and [[physical security]]. Just like real-world security, the motivations for breaches of computer security vary between attackers, sometimes called [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] or [[cracker (computing)|cracker]]s. Some are thrill-seekers or [[Vandalism|vandal]]s (the kind often responsible for defacing web sites); similarly, some [[web site defacement]]s are done to make political statements. However, some attackers are highly skilled and motivated with the goal of compromising computers for financial gain or espionage. An example of the latter is [[Markus Hess]] (more diligent than skilled), who spied for the [[KGB]] and was ultimately caught because of the efforts of [[Clifford Stoll]], who wrote a memoir, [[The Cuckoo's Egg (book)|The Cuckoo's Egg]], about his experiences. For those seeking to prevent security breaches, the first step is usually to attempt to identify what might motivate an attack on the system, how much the continued operation and information security of the system are worth, and who might be motivated to breach it. The precautions required for a home [[personal computer|PC]] are very different for those of [[bank]]s' Internet banking system, and different again for a [[Classified information|classified]] military [[computer network|network]]. Other computer security writers suggest that, since an attacker using a network need know nothing about you or what you have on your computer, attacker motivation is inherently impossible to determine beyond guessing. If true, blocking all possible attacks is the only plausible action to take. ==Vulnerabilities== {{main|Vulnerability (computing)}} To understand the techniques for securing a computer system, it is important to first understand the various types of "attacks" that can be made against it. These [[threat (computer)|threats]] can typically be classified into one of these seven categories: ===Exploits=== {{main|Exploit (computer security)}} An exploit (from the same word in the French language, meaning "achievement", or "accomplishment") is a piece of software, a chunk of data, or sequence of commands that take advantage of a software '[[bug]]' or '[[glitch]]' in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer software, hardware, or something electronic (usually computerized). This frequently includes such things as gaining control of a computer system or allowing privilege escalation or a denial of service attack. Many development methodologies rely on [[Software testing|testing]] to ensure the [[code quality|quality]] of any code released; this process often fails to discover unusual potential exploits. The term "exploit" generally refers to small programs designed to take advantage of a software flaw that has been discovered, either remote or local. The code from the exploit program is frequently reused in [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan horse]]s and [[computer virus]]es. In some cases, a vulnerability can lie in certain programs' processing of a specific file type, such as a non-executable media file. Some security web sites maintain lists of currently known unpatched vulnerabilities found in common programs (see "External links" below). ===Eavesdropping=== Eavesdropping is the act of surreptitiously listening to a private conversation, typically between hosts on a network. Even machines that operate as a closed system (i.e., with no contact to the outside world) can be eavesdropped upon via monitoring the faint [[electromagnetism|electro-magnetic]] transmissions generated by the hardware such as [[TEMPEST]]. The [[FBI]]'s proposed [[Carnivore (FBI)|Carnivore program]] was intended to act as a system of eavesdropping protocols built into the systems of [[internet service providers]]. ===Social engineering and human error=== {{main|Social engineering (security)}} A computer system is no more secure than the human systems responsible for its operation. Malicious [[individual]]s have regularly penetrated well-designed, secure computer systems by taking advantage of the carelessness of trusted individuals, or by deliberately deceiving them, for example sending messages that they are the system administrator and asking for passwords. This deception is known as [[Social engineering (computer security)|Social engineering]]. ===Denial-of-service attack=== {{main|Denial-of-service attack}} Unlike other exploits, denial of service attacks are not used to gain unauthorized access or control of a system. They are instead designed to render it unusable. Attackers can deny service to individual victims, such as by deliberately entering a wrong password 3 consecutive times and thus causing the victim account to be locked, or they may overload the capabilities of a machine
