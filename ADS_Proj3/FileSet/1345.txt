[[rope|string]]<!-- a piece of wire, so the link to [[rope|string]] is not ambiguous--> whose endpoints are fixed at two points <math>a<b</math> on the real line (here viewed as a horizontal line). Let the vertical outer [[force density]] at each point <math>x</math> <math>(a\le x \le b)</math> on the string be <math>f(x)\mathbf{e}</math>, where <math>\mathbf{e}</math> is a [[unit vector]] pointing vertically and <math>f:[a, b]\to \mathbb R.</math> Let <math>u(x)</math> be the [[deflection]] of the string at the point <math>x</math> under the influence of the force. Assuming that the deflection is small, the [[elastic energy]] of the string is : <math>\frac{1}{2} \int_a^b\! u'(x)^2\, dx</math> and the total [[potential energy]] of the string is : <math>F(u) = \frac{1}{2} \int_a^b\! u'(x)^2\,dx - \int_a^b\! u(x)f(x)\,dx.</math> The deflection <math>u(x)</math> minimizing the potential energy will satisfy the [[differential equation]] : <math>-u''=f\,</math> with [[boundary conditions]] :<math>u(a)=u(b)=0.\,</math> To study this equation, consider the space <math>X=L^2(a, b), </math> that is, the [[Lp space]] of all [[square integrable function]]s <math>u:[a, b]\to \mathbb R</math> in respect to the [[Lebesgue measure]]. This space is Hilbert in respect to the inner product : <math>(u|v)=\int_a^b\! u(x)v(x)\,dx,</math> with the norm being given by : <math>\|u\|=\sqrt{(u|u)}.</math> Let <math>Y</math> be the set of all [[smooth function|twice continuously differentiable functions]] <math>u:[a, b]\to \mathbb R</math> with the [[boundary conditions]]s <math>u(a)=u(b)=0.</math> Then <math>Y</math> is a linear subspace of <math>X.</math> Consider the operator <math>B:Y\to X</math> given by the formula : <math>Bu = -u'',\,</math> so the deflection satisfies the equation <math>Bu=f.</math> Using [[integration by parts]] and the boundary conditions, one can see that : <math>(Bu|v)=-\int_a^b\! u''(x)v(x)\, dx=\int_a^b u'(x)v'(x) = (u|Bv) </math> for any <math>u</math> and <math>v</math> in <math>Y.</math> Therefore, <math>B</math> is a symmetric linear operator. <math>B</math> is also strongly monotone, since, by the [[Friedrichs' inequality]] : <math>\|u\|^2 = \int_a^b u^2(x)\, dx \le C \int_a^b u'(x)^2\, dx = C\,(Bu|u)</math> for some <math>C>0.</math> The energetic space in respect to the operator <math>B</math> is then the [[Sobolev space]] <math>H^1_0(a, b).</math> We see that the elastic energy of the string which motivated this study is : <math>\frac{1}{2} \int_a^b\! u'(x)^2\, dx = \frac{1}{2} (u|u)_E,</math> so it is half of the energetic inner product of <math>u</math> with itself. To calculate the deflection <math>u</math> minimizing the total potential energy <math>F(u)</math> of the string, one writes this problem in the form :<math>(u|v)_E=(f|v)\,</math> for all <math>v</math> in <math>X_E</math>. Next, one usually approximates <math>u</math> by some <math>u_h</math>, a function in a finite-dimensional subspace of the true solution space. For example, one might let <math>u_h</math> be a continuous [[piecewise-linear function]] in the energetic space, which gives the [[finite element method]]. The approximation <math>u_h</math> can be computed by solving a [[linear system of equations]]. The energetic norm turns out to be the natural norm in which to measure the error between <math>u</math> and <math>u_h</math>, see [[CÃ©a's lemma]]. ==See also== * [[Inner product space]] * [[Positive definite kernel]] ==References== *{{cite book | last = Zeidler | first = Eberhard | title = Applied functional analysis: applications to mathematical physics | publisher = New York: Springer-Verlag | date = 1995 | pages = | isbn = 0387944427 }} *{{cite book | last = Johnson | first = Claes | title = Numerical solution of partial differential equations by the finite element method | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = 1987 | pages = | isbn = 0521345146 }} [[Category:Functional analysis]] [[Category:Hilbert space]]</text> </page> <page> <id>12155</id> <title>Engel expansion</title> <text>The '''Engel expansion''' of a positive [[real number]] ''x'' is the unique non-decreasing sequence of [[natural number|positive integer]]s <math>\{a_1,a_2,a_3,\dots\}</math> such that :<math>x=\frac{1}{a_1}+\frac{1}{a_1a_2}+\frac{1}{a_1a_2a_3}+\cdots.\;</math> [[Rational number]]s have a finite Engel expansion, while [[irrational number]]s have an infinite Engel expansion. If ''x'' is rational, its Engel expansion provides a representation of ''x'' as an [[Egyptian fraction]]. Engel expansions are named after [[Friedrich Engel (mathematician)|Friedrich Engel]], who studied them in 1913. An expansion analogous to an '''Engel expansion''', in which alternating terms are negative, is called a [[Pierce expansion]]. == Engel expansions, continued fractions, and Fibonacci == Kraaikamp and Wu (2004) observe that an Engel expansion can also be written as an ascending variant of a [[continued fraction]]: :<math>x = \frac{\displaystyle 1+\frac{\displaystyle 1+\frac{\displaystyle 1+\cdots}{\displaystyle a_3}}{\displaystyle a_2}}{\displaystyle a_1}.</math> They claim that ascending continued fractions such as this have been studied as early as [[Fibonacci]]'s [[Liber Abaci]] (1202). This claim appears to refer to Fibonacci's compound fraction notation in which a sequence of numerators and denominators sharing the same fraction bar represents an ascending continued fraction: :<math>\frac{a\ b\ c\ d}{e\ f\ g\ h} = \dfrac{d+\dfrac{c+\dfrac{b+\dfrac{a}{e}}{f}}{g}}{h}.</math> If such a notation has all numerators 0 or 1, as occurs in several instances in [[Liber Abaci]], the result is an Engel expansion. However, Engel expansion as a general technique does not seem to be described by Fibonacci. ==Algorithm for computing Engel expansions== To find the Engel expansion of ''x'', let :<math>u_1=x,</math> :<math>a_k=\left \lceil \frac{1}{u_k} \right \rceil,</math> and :<math> u_{k+1}=u_ka_k-1</math> where <math>\left \lceil r \right \rceil</math> is the [[floor function#The ceiling function|ceiling function]] (the smallest integer not less than ''r''). If <math>u_i=0</math> for any ''i'', halt the algorithm. == Example == To find the Engel expansion of 1.175, we perform the following steps. :<math>u_1 = 1.175, a_1=\left \lceil \frac{1}{1.175} \right\rceil = 1; \, </math> :<math>u_2 = u_1a_1-1=1.175\cdot1-1=0.175, a_2=\left\lceil\frac{1}{0.175}\right\rceil=6 \, </math> :<math>u_3 = u_2a_2-1=0.175\cdot6-1=0.05, a_3=\left\lceil\frac{1}{0.05}\right\rceil=20 \, </math> :<math>u_4 = u_3a_3-1=0.05\cdot20-1=0 \, </math> The series ends here. Thus, :<math>1.175=\frac{1}{1}+\frac{1}{1\cdot6}+\frac{1}{1\cdot6\cdot20}</math> and the Engel expansion of 1.175 is {1, 6, 20}. ==Engel expansions of rational numbers== Every positive rational number has a unique finite Engel expansion. In the algorithm for Engel expansion, if ''u<sub>i</sub>'' is a rational number ''x''/''y'', then ''u''<sub>''i''+1</sub> = (&minus;''y'' mod ''x'')/''y''. Therefore, at each step, the numerator in the remaining fraction ''u<sub>i</sub>'' decreases and the process of constructing the Engel expansion must terminate in a finite number of steps. Every rational number also has a unique infinite Engel expansion: using the identity :<math>\frac{1}{n}=\sum_{r=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n+1)^r}.</math> the final digit ''n'' in a finite Engel expansion can be replaced by an infinite sequence of (''n'' + 1)s without changing its value. For example :<math>1.175=\{1,6,20\}=\{1,6,21,21,21,\dots\}.\;\;</math> This is analogous to the fact that any rational number with a finite decimal representation also has an infinite decimal representation
