(2006). [http://www.palgrave-journals.com/ejis/journal/v15/n1/pdf/3000598a.pdf "Process models representing knowledge for action: a revised quality framework"]. In: ''[[European Journal of Information Systems]]'' (2006) 15, pp.91–102.</ref> The SEQUAL framework is grounded in [[semiotics]], particularly the semiotic theory of [[Charles W. Morris]]. It builds on semiotic theory and defines several quality aspects based on relationships between a model, a body of knowledge, a domain, a modeling language, and the activities of learning, taking action, and modeling.<ref name="Men06">Jan Mendlin et al.

''Conceptual Modeling - ER 2002, Proceedings, LNCS 2503'', pp. 380-396.</ref> The basic idea behind the SEQUAL framework is, that [[conceptual model]]s can be considered as sets of statements in a [[language]], and therefore can be evaluated in semiotic/linguistic terms. A first semiotic framework for evaluating conceptual models was originally proposed by Lindland et al. in the 1994 article "Understanding quality in conceptual modeling".<ref>O.I. Lindland, G. Sindre and [[Arne Sølvberg]] (1994) "Understanding quality in conceptual modeling". In: ''IEEE Software'' 11(2), 42–49.</ref> In its initial version, it considered three quality levels: * syntactic, * semantic, and * pragmatic quality The framework was later extended, and called the SEQUAL framework by Krogstie et al. in the 1995 article "Defining quality aspects for conceptual models".<ref>KROGSTIE J, LINDLAND OI and SINDRE G (1995) "Defining quality aspects for conceptual models".

Originally he majored in [[chemistry]] and minored in [[mathematics]], but his studies were interrupted by [[World War II]]. After basic training in the U. S. Army Infantry, the Army put him in a specialized training program to study [[electrical engineering]], which he found very interesting, especially electronics and communications.<ref name = "background"> [http://www.gwu.edu/~asc/warfield/ John N. Warfield Background], retrieved 24 August 2007.</ref> After the war he completed his original undergraduate program and continued on to get advanced degrees in [[electrical engineering]]. He received the Bachelor of Arts in 1948, Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering in 1948, and Master of Science in Electrical Engineering in 1949 from the University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri. He received the Doctor of Philosophy degree from [[Purdue University]], [[West Lafayette, Indiana]] in 1952.<ref> [https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/People/Alumni/WallOfFame/Classes/1952/013/view John N. Warfield] picture. 1952</ref> His major was [[electrical engineering]] with a specialty in [[communications engineering]]. He has about 10 years of industrial experience with these firms: Wilcox Electric Company, Battelle Memorial Institute, and Burroughs Corporation.
