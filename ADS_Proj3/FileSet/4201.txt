In Phase 2, the rotation ''r''<sub>1</sub> = (''p''<sub>1</sub>,''p''<sub>4</sub>), (''p''<sub>3</sub>,''p''<sub>2</sub>) is first identified. This is because ''p''<sub>2</sub> is ''p''<sub>1</sub>'s second favourite, and ''p''<sub>4</sub> is the second favourite of ''p''<sub>3</sub>. Applying ''r''<sub>1</sub> gives the new set ''S'' = {(''p''<sub>1</sub>,''p''<sub>2</sub>), (''p''<sub>2</sub>,''p''<sub>6</sub>), (''p''<sub>3</sub>,''p''<sub>4</sub>), (''p''<sub>4</sub>,''p''<sub>5</sub>), (''p''<sub>5</sub>,''p''<sub>3</sub>), (''p''<sub>6</sub>,''p''<sub>1</sub>)}. Next, the rotation ''r''<sub>2</sub> = (''p''<sub>1</sub>,''p''<sub>2</sub>), (''p''<sub>2</sub>,''p''<sub>6</sub>), (''p''<sub>4</sub>,''p''<sub>5</sub>) is identified, and application of ''r''<sub>2</sub> gives ''S'' = {(''p''<sub>1</sub>,''p''<sub>6</sub>), (''p''<sub>2</sub>,''p''<sub>5</sub>), (''p''<sub>3</sub>,''p''<sub>4</sub>), (''p''<sub>4</sub>,''p''<sub>2</sub>), (''p''<sub>5</sub>,''p''<sub>3</sub>), (''p''<sub>6</sub>,''p''<sub>1</sub>)}. Finally, the rotation ''r''<sub>3</sub> = (''p''<sub>2</sub>,''p''<sub>5</sub>), (''p''<sub>3</sub>,''p''<sub>4</sub>) is identified, application of which gives ''S'' = {(''p''<sub>1</sub>,''p''<sub>6</sub>), (''p''<sub>2</sub>,''p''<sub>4</sub>), (''p''<sub>3</sub>,''p''<sub>5</sub>), (''p''<sub>4</sub>,''p''<sub>2</sub>), (''p''<sub>5</sub>,''p''<sub>3</sub>), (''p''<sub>6</sub>,''p''<sub>1</sub>)}.
