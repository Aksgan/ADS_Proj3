[[Image:Ne1000.jpg|right|thumb|NE1000 8-bit ISA card (rev B, added AUI port for transceiver)]] [[Image:Ne2000.jpg|right|thumb|NE2000 16-bit ISA card (rev B, added AUI port for transceiver)]] == History == In the late 1980s, Novell was looking to shed its hardware server business and transform its flagship [[Novell NetWare|NetWare]] product into a [[IBM Personal Computer|PC]]-based server operating system that was agnostic and independent of the physical network implementation and [[Network topology|topology]] (Novell even referred to NetWare as a NOS, or "network operating system"). To do this, Novell needed networking technology in general &mdash; and networking cards in particular &mdash; to become a commodity, so that the server operating system and protocols would become the differentiating technology. Most of the key pieces of this strategy were already in place: Ethernet and token ring (among others) had been codified by the [[IEEE]] [[IEEE 802|802 standards]] committee &mdash; the draft was not formally adopted until 1990, but was already in widespread use, and cards from one vendor were, on the whole, wire-compatible with cards complying with the same 802 working group. However, networking hardware vendors in general, and industry leaders 3Com and IBM in particular, were charging high prices for their hardware. To combat this, Novell decided to develop its own line of cards. In order to create these at minimal [[research and development|R&D]], [[Electrical engineering|engineering]] and [[Manufacturing|production]] costs, Novell simply implemented, almost verbatim, a prototype design created by [[National Semiconductor]] using the 8390 Ethernet chip. National Semiconductor, for its part, had no qualms about the use of the design; the use of NatSemi chips made the proposal almost pure profit. However, since the design had only been intended as a proof-of-concept prototype, it implemented bare-minimum functionality: [[Programmed I/O|PIO]] was used instead of [[Direct Memory Access|DMA]], no [[Buffer (computer science)|buffering]] was provided and no provision was made for the use of a [[Medium Attachment Unit|transceiver]]. The original cards, the NE1000 (8-bit [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]]) and NE2000 (16-bit ISA)<ref> {{cite journal|title=Novell unveils LAN gear, new version of NetWare|journal=Network World|date=1988-05-16|first=Laura|last=DiDio|coauthors=|volume=5|issue=20|pages=4,71|id= |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GRIEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA4&dq=novell%20NE2000%20review&pg=PA4#v=onepage&q=novell%20NE2000%20review&f=false|format=|accessdate=2009-12-03 }}</ref>, and the corresponding use of limited 8-bit and later 16-bit DMA in the NE2000<ref name="packages_e_kth_se-ne2000">{{cite web|title=NetBSD/1.3.2/../ne2000.c|url=http://packages.e.kth.se/common/src/os/NetBSD/1.3.2/sys/dev/ic/ne2000.c}} 090428 packages.e.kth.se</ref> uses [[10BASE2|thin Ethernet]]; the second ("B") revision added an AUI port to support a transceiver, and later models NE1000T and NE2000T added built-in [[Ethernet over twisted pair|10BASE-T]] support. The "NE" prefix stood for "Novell Ethernet". Novell released the cards through its Eagle subsidiary, and sold them for little to no profit. The cards were widely criticized for poor performance; but, for organizations rolling out NetWare LANs with hundreds or thousands of desktop nodes, the cost savings afforded by Novell's cards (they were as little as 25% of the cost of competitive cards), combined with guaranteed NetWare compatibility, made them an easy choice. Novell, for its part, made its profit from the sales of NetWare, which was licensed on a per-node, per-server model; thus, it could afford to sell the cards themselves at zero profit, knowing that every card sold virtually guaranteed a corresponding NetWare node license. The success of the cards prompted the creation of a cottage industry of clone cards, which were compatible (to varying degrees) with Novell's cards. Novell eventually spun off the Eagle division as a separate company, Anthem Technologies<ref> {{cite journal|title=Novell discounts boards; Anthem to market them|journal=Network World|date=1989-06-19|first=Susan|last=Breidenbach|coauthors=|volume=6|issue=24|pages=70|id= |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zxwEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA70&dq=novell%20ne2000&lr=&as_drrb_is=b&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=1&as_maxy_is=1990&as_brr=0&pg=PA70#v=onepage&q=novell%20ne2000&f=true|format=|accessdate=2009-12-03 }}</ref>, which was later bought by Artisoft, then sold to Microdyne. These companies continued to develop enhanced versions of the cards, producing versions with technology improvements (e.g. DMA/bus mastering, buffering), [[Plug and Play]], and support for other network topologies (e.g. token ring, [[Fast Ethernet]]) and bus architectures (e.g. [[Extended Industry Standard Architecture|EISA]], [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]], [[PC Card|PCMCIA]]). In order to remain competitive with Novell's bargain-price cards, [[3Com]] and other vendors were forced to cut the pricing of their entry-level network cards, contributing greatly to the networking boom of the 1990s. To a lesser extent, it is arguable that the success of the NE1000/2000 cards helped to tip the scale of the "LAN wars" in favor of [[Ethernet]] (championed by 3Com) over [[token ring]] (championed by [[IBM]]). In 2003 National Semiconductor ceased manufacturing of the 8390 chip. == Clones == Many other manufacturers copied the design labeling under their own brand, while still claiming NE1000/NE2000 compatibility. However, in reality this was not always the case. For instance, the Winbond 83C901 ignores the reset signal. <ref name="web_bilkent_edu_tr-Ethernet-HOWTO-3_html_ne2k-probs">{{cite web|title=Linux Ethernet-Howto: Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://web.bilkent.edu.tr/Online/Linux/HOWTO/Ethernet-HOWTO-3.html#ne2k-probs}} 090428 web.bilkent.edu.tr</ref> == Supported operating systems == Besides NetWare, driver support for these cards was (and still is) available for a variety of operating systems, including [[DOS]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[UNIX]], [[FreeBSD]], [[QNX]], and [[Linux]]<ref name="beowulf_es_embnet_org-ne2k-pci">{{cite web|title=PCI NE2000 cards and Linux|url=http://beowulf.es.embnet.org/linux/drivers/ne2k-pci.html}} 090428 beowulf.es.embnet.org</ref>.

Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) was created by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to move forward the development of improvements and innovations in infrastructure design and construction practices to prevent or minimize damage during an earthquake or tsunami. Its headquarters are based at [[Purdue University]] in West Lafayette, Indiana as part of cooperative agreement #CMMI-0927178. The mission of NEES is to accelerate improvements in seismic design and performance by serving as a collaboratory for discovery and innovation. The NEES network features 14 geographically-distributed, shared-use laboratories that support several types of experimental work: geotechnical centrifuge research, shake table tests, large-scale structural testing, tsunami wave basin experiments, and field site research. Participating universities include: Cornell University; Lehigh University; Oregon State University; Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; University at Buffalo, SUNY; University of California, Berkeley; University of California, Davis; University of California, Los Angeles; University of
