It allows the user to compose and send [[SMS]] and [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]] messages that are [[encrypted]] and [[Digital signature|digitally signed]] using methods that are based on the [[S/MIME]] standard. Secure e-mail messaging is not supported. The [[cipher|cryptographic algorithms]] supported by CryptoGraf include [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]], [[RSA]] and [[SHA-256]]. RSA [[public key]]s of other users are stored in a "Crypto Contacts" list [http://cryptograf.com/cryptomanual.php]. The user sends an encrypted SMS or MMS to a recipient listed in Crypto Contacts. Keys must be exchanged before messages can be sent. The way a Crypto Contact is received determines the [http://cryptograf.com/cryptomanual.php#heading14 trust level] assigned to the key: * High trust for Crypto Contacts received by [[Bluetooth]]. * Medium trust for Crypto Contacts received via High trust contacts. * Low trust for Crypto Contacts received by [[SMS]] or [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]]. The Crypto Contacts list is based on a trust model similar to the [[Web of trust]] known from [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]]. Crypto Contacts are compatible with [[X.509]] [[digital certificate]]s and contain RSA (1024/2048 bit) public keys. Messages are [[encrypted]] using [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES-256 bit]] and [[Digital signature|digitally signed]] using [[RSA]] (1024/2048 bit) with [[SHA-256]]. CryptoGraf is integrated with standard messaging application in both Symbian and Windows Mobile and stores messages in the default Inbox, Sent and other folders. == CryptoGraf in the press == CryptoGraf got attention from local newspaper after their first release. * The Nation, 23 January 2007.

It can be used to [[Digital signature|digitally sign]], [[Cryptographic hash function|digest]], [[Message authentication code|authenticate]] or [[encryption|encrypt]] any form of digital data. CMS is based on the syntax of [[PKCS]]#7, which in turn is based on the [[Privacy-enhanced Electronic Mail|Privacy-Enhanced Mail]] standard. The newest version of CMS ({{As of|2009|lc=on}}) is specified in RFC 5652 (but see also RFC 5911 for updated ASN.1 modules conforming to ASN.1 2002). The architecture of CMS is built around [[X.509|certificate-based]] key management, such as the profile defined by the [[PKIX]] [[working group]]. CMS is used as the key cryptographic component of many other cryptographic standards, such as [[S/MIME]], [[PKCS]]#12 and the RFC 3161 [[Digital timestamping]] protocol. [[OpenSSL]] is an [[open source]] software that can encrypt, decrypt, sign and verify, compress and uncompress CMS documents. ==See also== {{Portal|Cryptography}} * [[CAdES (computing)|CAdES - CMS Advanced Electronic Signatures]] * [[S/MIME]] * [[PKCS]]#7 ==External links== * [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2630.txt RFC 2630] * [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3852.txt RFC 3852] * [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5652.txt RFC 5652] * [http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5911.txt RFC 5911] * [http://www.globaltrustfinder.com/PKCS7UserSigningStep1.aspx GlobalTrustFinder - CMD Demo Powered by ADSS)] <!-- Categories --> [[Category:Cryptographic protocols]] {{Crypto navbox}} {{Crypto-stub}} [[de:Cryptographic Message Syntax]] [[ja:暗号メッセージ構文]] [[pl:Cryptographic Message Syntax]]</text> </page> <page> <id>8615</id> <title>Cryptographic engineering</title> <text>{{unreferenced|date=March 2009}} '''[[cryptography|Cryptographic]] [[engineering]]''' is the discipline of using cryptography to solve human problems. Cryptography is typically applied when trying to ensure data [[confidentiality]], to [[authentication|authenticate]] people or devices, or to verify [[data integrity]] in risky environments. ==Major Issues== In modern practice, cryptographic engineering is deployed in [[crypto system]]s. Like most engineering design, these are wholly human creations. Most crypto systems are [[computer software]], either embedded in [[firmware]] or running as ordinary executable files under an [[operating system]]. In some system designs, the cryptography runs under manual direction, in others, it is run automatically, often in the background. Like other software design, and unlike most other engineering, there are few external constraints. ===Active opposition=== In other engineering design, a successful design or implementation of one, is one which 'works'. Thus, an aircraft which actually flies without crashing due to some [[aerodynamic]] design blunder is a successful design. How successful is important, of course, and depends on how
