Fairly accessible introduction, but somewhat dated. The categorical approach to higher-order logics over polymorphic and dependent types was developed largely after this book was published. *{{cite book | first = Bart | last = Jacobs | title = Categorical Logic and Type Theory | date = 1999 | publisher = North Holland, Elsevier | isbn = 0-444-50170-3 | series = Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics 141 | url = http://www.cs.ru.nl/B.Jacobs/CLT/bookinfo.html }} A comprehensive monograph written by a computer scientist; it covers both first-order and higher-order logics, and also polymorphic and dependent types. The focus is on [[fibred category]] as universal tool in categorical logic, which is necessary in dealing with polymorphic and dependent types. According to [[P.T. Johnstone]], this approach is unwieldy for simple types. * [[P.T. Johnstone]], 2002, ''Sketches of an Elephant'', part D (vol 2) covers both first-order and higher-order logics, but not dependent or polymorphic types, considered by the author of interest mainly to computer science. Because it avoids polymorphic and dependent types, the categorical approach is easier to present in therms of a [[syntactic category]] just as in Lambek's book, but ''Sketches'' includes more recent developments, like <!-- that article needs to cover this-->. * [[John Lane Bell]] (2005) ''The Development of Categorical Logic''.

''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]]'' Oxford University Press, p. 58.</ref>, or, alternatively, a property is ascribed to a thing that could not possibly have that property. All (propositional) mistakes involve some sort of [[misascription]] of properties, so in a sense any mistake is a "category mistake": putting a thing into a class to which it does not belong. But a "category mistake" in colloquial philosophical usage seems to be the most severe form of misascription, involving the endorsement of what is in fact logically impossible. Thus the mistaken claim that "Most Americans are atheists" is not a category mistake, since it is merely contingently true that most Americans are theists. On the other hand, "Most bananas are atheists" is a category mistake. To show that a category mistake has been committed one must typically show that once the phenomenon in question is properly understood, it becomes clear that the claim being made about it could not possibly be true. ==Gilbert Ryle== The term "category-mistake" was introduced by [[Gilbert Ryle]] in his book ''[[The Concept of Mind]]'' (1949) to remove what he argued to be a confusion over the nature of mind born from [[Descartes|Cartesian]] [[metaphysics]]. Ryle alleged that it was a mistake to treat the mind as an object made of an immaterial substance because predications of substance are not meaningful for a collection of dispositions and capacities. Specifically, the phrase is introduced in chapter 1, section 2.<ref>Gilbert Ryle ''The Concept of Mind]]'', 1949. p. [http://books.google.com/books?id=ryl-ezY6Mn8C&printsec=find&pg=PA16=onepage=false#v=onepage&q&f=false 16.]</ref> The first example he gives is of a visitor to [[Oxford]]. The visitor, upon viewing the [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|colleges]] and [[Bodleian Library|library]], reportedly inquired “But where is the University?"<ref>MacFadden, T.G.: ''Understanding the Internet: Model, Metaphor, and Analogy'', [[Library Trends]], Vol. 50, No. 1, Summer 2001, [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], [[Baltimore]], p.96 [http://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/8386/librarytrendsv50i1h_opt.pdf;jsessionid=07186822B34BFE980C3278B1F354D971?sequence=1]</ref> The visitor's mistake is presuming that a University is part of the category "units of physical infrastructure" or some such thing, rather than the category "institutions", say, which are far more abstract and complex conglomerations of buildings, people, procedures, and so on. Ryle's second example is of a child witnessing the march-past of a division. After having had battalions, batteries, squadrons, etc. pointed out, the child asks when is the division going to appear. 'The march-past was not a parade of battalions, batteries, squadrons ''and'' a division; it was a parade of the battalions, batteries and squadrons ''of'' a division.' (Ryle's italics) His third example is of a foreigner being shown a cricket match. <!-- (All Ryle's examples are ''very'' English) --> After being pointed out batsmen, bowlers and fielders, the foreigner asks: 'who is left to contribute the famous element of team-spirit?' He goes on to argue that the Cartesian dualism of mind and body rests on a category-mistake. ==References== {{reflist}} == See also == * [[catachresis]] * [[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously]] * [[Metaphor#Terms_and_categorization|mixed metaphor]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Category Mistake}} [[Category:Logical fallacies]] [[Category:Philosophy of language]] [[Category:Philosophy of mind]] [[de:Kategorienfehler]] [[et:Kategooriaviga]] [[es:Error categorial]] [[ja:カテゴリー錯誤]] [[ro:Eroare categorială]] [[fi:Kategoriavirhe]]</text> </page> <page> <id>5636</id> <title>Category talk:Unix software</title> <text>== Sane Organization == In order to standardize the UNIX software listing with the [[:Category:Software_by_operating_system|other operating systems]], I am creating this category and moving all the previously categorized.
