Both products are based on [[hypervisor]] technology and allow users to run an additional 32- or 64-bit [[x86]] [[operating system]] in a [[virtual machine]] alongside [[Mac OS X]] on an [[Intel]]-powered Mac. The similarity in features and functionality between '''[[VMware Fusion]]''' and '''[[Parallels Desktop for Mac]]''' has given occasion for much comparison. ==Features== {| class="wikitable" style="font-size: smaller; text-align: center; width: 100%; table-layout: fixed;" ! rowspan="2"| Feature ! colspan="2"| Product |- !
