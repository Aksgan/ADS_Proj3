The contest began on June 12, and ended on September 30. Entries tended to either xor the region with a retrievable pseudo-random mask or append the masked data to the end of the file format. The two placing programs both used improperly defined macros while the winner, choosing to work with an uncommon text based format, zeroed out pixel values while keeping the number of digits intact. ==2009 Contest== The 2009 contest required participants to write a program that sifts through routing directives but redirects a piece of luggage based on some innocuous-looking comment in the space-delimited input data file. The contest began 2009 December 29, and ended on 2010 March 1.<ref>http://underhanded.xcott.com/?p=18</ref> ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== *[http://underhanded.xcott.com/ Home page] *[http://underhanded.xcott.com/?p=8 2008 contest page] and [http://underhanded.xcott.com/?p=12 winners] [[Category:Programming contests]] [[Category:Ironic and humorous awards]] [[Category:C programming language]]</text> </page> <page> <id>38765</id> <title>Underwater glider</title> <text>{{No footnotes|date=April 2009}} [[Image:Slocum-Glider-Auvpicture 5.jpg|thumb|right|NOAA Personnel launch a ''Slocum'' Glider off Florida]] [[Image:RU02 flying in Sargasso Sea.jpg|thumb|right|Rutgers Slocum Glider RU02 deployed in Sargasso Sea]] [[Image:SeagliderPreparing.jpg|thumb|right|Dr. Bruce Howe and Bill Felton of University of Washington prepare a Seaglider for deployment]] [[Image:Seaglider-Surface.jpg|thumb|right|UW Seaglider at the surface between dives]] An '''underwater glider''' is a type of [[autonomous underwater vehicle]] (AUV) that uses small changes in its [[buoyancy]] in conjunction with wings to convert vertical motion to horizontal, and thereby propel itself forward with very low power consumption. While not as fast as conventional AUVs, gliders using buoyancy-based propulsion represent a significant increase in range and duration compared to vehicles propelled by [[electric motor]]-driven [[propeller]]s, extending [[ocean sampling]] missions from hours to weeks or months, and to thousands of kilometers of range. Gliders follow an up-and-down, [[sawtooth wave|sawtooth]]-like profile through the water, providing data on temporal and spatial scales unavailable to previous AUVs, and much more costly to sample using traditional shipboard techniques. == History == The DARPA SBIR program received a proposal for a temperature gradient glider in 1988. DARPA was aware at that time of similar research projects underway in the USSR.<ref name="DARPAEARLY">{{cite web |url=http://ideaintegrator.com/boats/pass/pass.htm|title=Perpetual Autonomus Survey Submersible|accessdate=2009-07-03 |publisher=Tony Bigras }}</ref> The concept of the glider <!--(Fallon Patent 3,204,596 Hydro Glider 09/07/1965)--> was introduced to the oceanographic community by [[Henry Stommel]] in a 1989 article in ''Oceanography'', when he proposed a glider concept called ''Slocum'', developed with research engineer Doug Webb. They named the glider after [[Joshua Slocum]], who made the first solo circumnavigation of the globe by sailboat. They proposed harnessing energy from the [[thermal]] [[gradient]] between deep ocean water (2-4 Â°C) and surface water (near atmospheric temperature) to achieve globe-circling range, constrained only by battery power onboard for communications, sensors, and navigational computers. By 2005, not only had a working thermal-powered glider (''Slocum Thermal'') been demonstrated by Webb Research (founded by Doug Webb), but they and other institutions had introduced battery-powered gliders with impressive duration and efficiency, far exceeding that of traditional survey-class AUVs. The [[University of Washington]] ''Seaglider'' and [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] ''Spray'' vehicles have performed feats such as crossing the [[Gulf Stream]] from the mainland USA to Bermuda, and, together with the Webb ''Slocum'', conducting sustained, multi-vehicle collaborative monitoring of oceanographic variables in [[Monterey Bay]]. Originally conceived as testbed for the thermal-power gliders before developing into a platform of their own, the Webb Slocum electric gliders have been widely deployed since 2003. On December 4, 2009, one of these gliders, [[RU-27]], became the first to complete a [[Transatlantic crossing|transatlantic]] journey, traveling from New Jersey to the coast of Spain in 221 days.<ref>Kirk Moore, "Rutgers undersea glider makes trans-Atlantic crossing," Daily Record, December 6, 2009 [http://www.dailyrecord.com/article/20091206/NEWS02/91204128/1123/Rutgers-undersea-glider-makes-trans-Atlantic-crossing]</ref> The effort was led by a team from [[Rutgers University]], which has become one of the largest glider operators. == Functional Description == Gliders typically make measurements such as [[temperature]], [[conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivity]] (to calculate [[salinity]]), currents, [[chlorophyll]] [[fluorescence]], optical [[backscatter]], bottom depth, and (occasionally) acoustic backscatter. They navigate with the help of periodic surface [[GPS]] fixes, pressure sensors, tilt sensors, and magnetic compasses. Vehicle [[Tait-Bryan angles|pitch]] is controllable by movable internal ballast (usually battery packs), and steering is accomplished either with a rudder (as in ''Slocum'') or by moving internal ballast to control [[Tait-Bryan angles|roll]] (as in ''Spray'' and ''Seaglider''). Buoyancy is adjusted either by using a [[piston]] to flood/evacuate a compartment with seawater (''Slocum'') or by moving oil in/out of an external bladder (''Seaglider'', ''Spray'', and ''Slocum Thermal''). Commands and data are relayed between gliders and shore by satellite. Gliders vary in the pressure they are able to withstand. The coastal ''Slocum'' model is rated for 200 meters depth. ''Spray'' can operate to 1500 meters, ''Seaglider'' to 1000 meters, ''SeaExplorer'' to 700, and ''Slocum Thermal'' to 1200. In August 2010, a ''Deep Glider'' variant of the Seaglider achieved a repeated 6000-meter operating depth. == XRay Flying Wing == As of 2006, the US Navy [[Office of Naval Research]] is developing the world's largest glider, the [[Liberdade XRay]], which uses a [[blended wing body]] hullform to achieve hydrodynamic efficiency. It is intended to quietly track [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel electric]] submarines in [[littoral]] waters, remaining on station for up to 6 months, with major field testing beginning in August 2006.<ref>[http://www.onr.navy.mil/media/extra/fact_sheets/advanced_underwater_glider.pdf]</ref> ==See also== *[[AUV]] *[[Argo (oceanography)|Argo floats]] *[[Paravane (weapon)]] *[[Paravane (water kite)]] == References == {{reflist}} ==External links== {{commons category|Underwater gliders}} * [http://www.underwater-gps.com/uk/product-detail.php?pr_id=8 ''Seaexplorer'' page at ACSA Underwater GPS] * [http://spray.ucsd.edu/ ''Spray'' page at Scripps Institution of Oceanography] * [http://www.apl.washington.edu/projects/seaglider/summary.html ''Seaglider'' page at Applied Physics Laboratory - University of Washington] * [http://iop.apl.washington.edu/seaglider/ ''Seaglider'' Operations page at APL-UW] * [http://marine.rutgers.edu/cool/auvs/ Rutgers University Coastal Ocean Observations Lab -- Glider Operations] * [http://www.webbresearch.com/slocumglider.aspx ''Slocum'' page at Webb Research Corp.] * [http://auvac.org/resources/search/capabilities.php?glider=y&submit=Search Underwater glider configurations and details - AUVAC.org] * [http://www-pord.ucsd.edu/~rdavis/publications/MTS_Glider.pdf Underwater Gliders for Ocean Research] * [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7234544.stm Robot glider harvests ocean heat] * [http://www.noc.soton.ac.uk/omf/projects/glider/ National Oceanography Centre, UK.
