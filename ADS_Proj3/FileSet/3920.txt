refers to the other. [[John Dewey]] praised ''Possibility'' as a "significant intellectual achievement". His second book, ''Poetry and Mathematics'', was published in 1929 by The John Day Company. Developed from materials for Buchanan's lectures at the [[People's Institute]], this book was recognized by [[Richard McKeon]], who had studied medieval philosophy under [[Étienne Gilson]], as a rediscovery of the medieval [[trivium (education)|trivium]] and [[quadrivium]]. This insight of McKeon's, wrote Buchanan in 1961, is what led to the "radical reform of teaching and learning in a small province of the modern academy" for which Buchanan is remembered today. The American philosopher [[Morris Raphael Cohen|Morris Cohen]] praised ''Poetry and Mathematics'' as "an admirable piece of work." ''Symbolic Distance in Relation to Analogy and Fiction'', Buchanan's third book, appeared in London in 1932 as part of Ogden's "Psyche Miniatures" series. Part of it had been published earlier in ''Psyche'', the journal of Ogden's [[Orthological Institute]]. Although Buchanan later claimed that this work was inspired by a year's study of the English logician [[Boole|George Boole]], it does not mention Boole. Rather, ''Symbolic Distance'' was obviously written in collaboration with Ogden's investigation of the linguistic theories of [[Jeremy Bentham]], and Ogden cites ''Symbolic Distance'' in his own book ''Bentham's Theory of Fictions''. This is the first of Buchanan's books to mention the medieval [[trivium (education)|trivium]] and [[quadrivium]]. Buchanan's fourth book, ''The Doctrine of Signatures: A Defence of Theory in Medicine'' appeared in New York, in 1938, also (like ''Possibility'') as part of Ogden's ''International Library of Psychology, Philosophy and Scientific Method''. A portion of the first chapter had appeared earlier in the 1934 issue of ''Psyche'', under the title "Introduction to Medieval Orthology". ''Truth in the Sciences'' was completed by Buchanan in 1950 under contract to the ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' for a project that never materialized. The manuscript was published posthumously in book form by the [[University of Virginia]] in 1972. Buchanan's final book, ''Essay in Politics'', was published in 1953 by the Philosophical Library in New York. Stemming from his involvement with the 1948 [[Henry A. Wallace|Wallace]] campaign and later with the [[Foundation for World Government]], Buchanan reflects on the problems of political representation and democracy that are posed by technology and industrialization. Buchanan continued to work on these ideas during his years at the [[Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions]]. ==See also== *[[St. John's College, U.S.]] *[[Liberal Arts, Inc.]] *[[Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions]] *[[Robert Maynard Hutchins]] *[[Mortimer Adler]] *[[Alexander Meiklejohn]] *[[Liberal arts]] *[[Trivium (education)|Trivium]] *[[Quadrivium]] *[[Adult education]] *[[World government]] *[[American philosophy]] *[[List of American philosophers]] ==References== <references/> *Nelson, Charles A.

SCOTS has been available online since November 2004, and can be freely searched and browsed. By the end of the project, in mid-2007, SCOTS aims to increase the size of the text collection to 4 million words. The project is a venture by the Department of English Language and STELLA project at the [[University of Glasgow]]. SCOTS is grant-funded by the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]]. ==Language Variety== SCOTS contains texts in [[Scottish English]] and varieties of broad Scots, including [[Doric dialect (Scotland)|Doric]], [[Lallans]], urban varieties such as [[Glaswegian]] and [[Insular Scots]]. SCOTS contains a [[geographical]] spread of texts as well as a [[demographic]] spread. Each text is accompanied by extensive [[metadata]], including such information as author’s decade of birth, gender, occupation, birthplace and place of residence, and details about the text such as publication information, audience, date and genre. ==Genre and Mode== SCOTS is a [[multimedia]] [[text corpus|corpus]], containing written texts and spoken texts, available as [[transcription (linguistics)|orthographic transcriptions]], accompanied by source audio or video files. SCOTS includes a large number of [[genre]]s and text types, including prose fiction, poetry, business and personal correspondence, religious texts, parliamentary and administrative documents, emails, conversations and interviews. ==Search and Analysis== SCOTS can be investigated in various ways, depending on the user’s interest. The corpus can be browsed, for example by the author’s name or date of the text, and all texts can be downloaded in [[plain text]] format. [[transcription (linguistics)|Transcriptions]] are synchronised with audio / video files, which are streamed and may also be downloaded. An Advanced Search facility allows the user to build up more complex queries, choosing from all the fields available in the [[metadata]]. Geographical results are plotted on an interactive map, so regional variation may be investigated. Advanced Search results can also be viewed as a [[Key Word in Context|KWIC]] concordance, which can be reordered to highlight [[collocation]]al patterns. <gallery> Image:ScotsVideo.png|SCOTS video screenshot Image:ScotsMap.png|SCOTS map screenshot Image:ScotsConc.png|SCOTS concordance screenshot </gallery> ==External links== * [http://www.scottishcorpus.ac.uk/ Scottish Corpus of Texts & Speech] * [http://www.scottishcorpus.ac.uk/about/publications/ List of academic publications by Scottish Corpus of Texts & Speech] [[Category:Scots language]] [[Category:Scottish English]] [[Category:Corpora]] [[Category:University of Glasgow]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33421</id> <title>Scour</title> <text>{{about||the hydrological process|Bridge scour|the physical process|wiktionary:scouring}} <!-- commented out deleted image [[File:Scour Exchange screenshot.png|thumb|right|A screenshot of Scour Exchange.]] --> '''Scour Inc.''' was a [[multimedia]] search engine on the internet, and provided '''Scour Exchange''', an early [[peer-to-peer]] file exchange service.
