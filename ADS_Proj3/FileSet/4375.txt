Support for new programming environments followed with TeeChart's first native C# version for [[Microsoft Visual Studio .NET]] released in 2002<ref name="keydates"/> and TeeChart.Lite for .NET, a free charting component, released for Visual Studio.NET in 2003<ref name="keydates"/> and supporting too, [[Mono (programming)]]. Steema Software released the first native TeeChart [[Java (programming language)]] version in 2006<ref name="keydates"/> and TeeChart's first native [[PHP]] version was released in 2009 and published as [[open-source]] in June 2010.<ref name="keydates"/> ==Usage== TeeChart is a general purpose charting component designed for use in differing ambits, offering a wide range of aesthetics to chart data. Generally TeeCharts published in the field, in areas where large amounts of data require to be interpreted regularly, remain by designer choice in their simplest form to minimise the "data-ink ratio".<ref>{{Citation | last = Tufte | first = Edward Rolf | authorlink = Edward Rolf Tufte | title = The visual display of quantitative information | publisher = Graphics Press | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780961392147 }}</ref> [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]], SDSS Web Services' use for charting "Scientific .. plotting of online data" <ref>{{Citation | last = Budavári | first = Tamás | publisher = [[Royal Observatory Edinburgh]] | title = Coding against the Universe | page = 10 | work = [http://grist.caltech.edu/sc4devo/ Workshop on Service Composition for Data Exploration in the Virtual Observatory] | year = 2004 | accessdate = June 2010 | url = http://www.roe.ac.uk/~rgm/sc4devo/sc4devo1/sc4devo1_09budavari.pdf}}</ref> at The Virtual Observatory Spectrum Services<ref>[http://voservices.net/spectrum/ The Virtual Observatory Spectrum Services]</ref> reflects that approach. The SDSS chart authors choose to represent data using TeeChart's standard 2D line display. Speed is also a factor when choosing how to most effectively plot data. Realtime data, at frequencies of up to tens or hundreds of data points or more per second, require the most processor economic approach to charting. Computer processing time dedicated to the plotting of data needs to be as lightweight as possible, freeing-up computer tasks "to achieve real-time data acquisition, display and analysis".<ref>{{Citation | last = Zheng | first = Xiaofeng | last2 = Zeng | first2 = Qiyong | last3 = Wu | first3 = Kai | last4 = Yu | first4 = Zhonghua | last5 = Li | first5 = Xiaotong | editor = [[IEEE Computer Society]] | title = Cutting Temperature and Force Data Acquisition and Measuring
