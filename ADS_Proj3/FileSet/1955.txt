storage was [[Sequential access|serial-access]] mercury delay lines capable of storing 1,000 words of 11 decimal digits plus sign (72-bit words). A key feature of the UNIVAC system was a newly invented type of metal magnetic tape, and a high-speed tape unit, for non-volatile storage. Magnetic media are still used in many computers.<ref>Magnetic tape will be the primary data storage mechanism when [[CERN]]'s [[Large Hadron Collider]] comes online in 2008.</ref> In 1952, IBM publicly announced the [[IBM 701]] Electronic Data Processing Machine, the first in its successful [[IBM 700/7000 series|700/7000 series]] and its first [[IBM mainframe]] computer. The [[IBM 704]], introduced in 1954, used magnetic core memory, which became the standard for large machines. The first implemented high-level general purpose [[programming language]], [[Fortran]], was also being developed at IBM for the 704 during 1955 and 1956 and released in early 1957. (Konrad Zuse's 1945 design of the high-level language [[Plankalkül]] was not implemented at that time.) A volunteer [[user group]], which exists to this day, was founded in 1955 to [[SHARE (computing)|share]] their software and experiences with the IBM 701. [[File:IBM-650-panel.jpg|thumb|IBM 650 front panel]] IBM introduced a smaller, more affordable computer in 1954 that proved very popular.<ref>For example, Kara Platoni's article on [[Donald Knuth]] [http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2006/mayjun/features/knuth.html stated that "there was something special about the] [[IBM 650]]", ''Stanford Magazine'', May/June 2006</ref> The [[IBM 650]] weighed over 900 kg, the attached power supply weighed around 1350 kg and both were held in separate cabinets of roughly 1.5 meters by 0.9 meters by 1.8 meters. It cost $500,000 (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|500000|1954|r=-4}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) or could be leased for $3,500 a month (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|3500|1954|r=-4}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|US}} Its drum memory was originally 2,000 ten-digit words, later expanded to 4,000 words. Memory limitations such as this were to dominate programming for decades afterward. The program instructions were fetched from the spinning drum as the code ran. Efficient execution using drum memory was provided by a combination of hardware architecture: the instruction format included the address of the next instruction; and software: the Symbolic Optimal Assembly Program, SOAP,<ref>{{Citation | last = IBM | title = SOAP II for the IBM 650 | year = 1957 | url = http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/650/24-4000-0_SOAPII.pdf | id = C24-4000-0 |format=PDF}}</ref> assigned instructions to the optimal addresses (to the extent possible by static analysis of the source program). Thus many instructions were, when needed, located in the next row of the drum to be read and additional wait time for drum rotation was not required. In 1955, [[Maurice Wilkes]] invented [[microprogram]]ming,<ref>{{harvnb|Wilkes|1986|pp=115–126}}</ref> which allows the base instruction set to be defined or extended by built-in programs (now called [[firmware]] or [[microcode]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Horowitz|Hill|1989|p=743}}</ref> It was widely used in the [[Central processing unit|CPUs]] and [[floating-point]] units of [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] and other computers, such as the [[Manchester University|Manchester]] [[Atlas Computer|Atlas]] <ref>[http://www.chilton-computing.org.uk/acl/technology/atlas/p019.htm The microcode was implemented as ''extracode'' on Atlas] accessdate=20100209</ref> and the [[IBM 360]] series.<ref>{{harvnb|Patterson|Hennessy|1998|p=424}}</ref> IBM introduced its [[Early IBM disk storage|first magnetic disk system]], [[RAMAC]] (Random Access Method of Accounting and Control) in 1956. Using fifty {{convert|24|in|mm|sing=on}} metal disks, with 100 tracks per side, it was able to store 5 [[megabyte]]s of data at a cost of $10,000 per megabyte (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|10000|1956|r=-4}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|US}}<ref>{{harvnb|IBM|1956}}</ref> ==Second generation: transistors== {{Main|Transistor computer}} {{See|List of transistorized computers}} [[File:Transistor-die-KSY34.jpg|thumb|A [[bipolar junction transistor]]]] The bipolar [[transistor]] was invented in 1947.

The later machine used 200 transistors and 1,300 [[Solid-state (electronics)|solid-state]] [[diode]]s and had a power consumption of 150 watts. However, it still required valves to generate the clock waveforms at 125 kHz and to read and write on the magnetic [[drum memory]], whereas the [[Harwell CADET]] operated without any valves by using a lower clock frequency, of 58 kHz when it became operational in February 1955.<ref>{{Citation|last= Cooke-Yarborough |first= E.H. |title= Some early transistor applications in the UK. |journal= Engineering and Science Education Journal |volume= 7 |issue= 3 |pages= 100–106 |publisher= IEE |location= London, UK |date = June 1998|url= http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=00689507 |issn= 0963-7346 |accessdate= 2009-06-07|doi= 10.1049/esej:19980301 }}</ref> Problems with the reliability of early batches of point contact and alloyed junction transistors meant that the machine's [[mean time between failures]] was about 90 minutes, but this improved once the more reliable [[bipolar junction transistor]]s became available.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lavington|1998|pp=36–37}}</ref> Compared to vacuum tubes, transistors have many advantages: they are smaller, and require less power than vacuum tubes, so give off less heat. Silicon junction transistors were much more reliable than vacuum tubes and had longer, indefinite, service life. Transistorized computers could contain tens of thousands of binary logic circuits in a relatively compact space. Transistors greatly reduced computers' size, initial cost, and [[operating cost]]. Typically, second-generation computers were composed of large numbers of [[printed circuit board]]s such as the [[IBM Standard Modular System]]<ref name=IBM_SMS>{{harvnb|IBM_SMS|1960}}</ref> each carrying one to four [[logic gate]]s or [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]]. A second generation computer, the [[IBM 1401]], captured about one third of the world market. IBM installed more than one hundred thousand 1401s between 1960 and 1964. [[File:IBM 350 RAMAC.jpg|thumb|left|This [[RAMAC]] [[Direct access storage device|DASD]] is being restored at the [[Computer History Museum]]]] Transistorized electronics improved not only the [[Central processing units|CPU]] (Central Processing Unit), but also the [[peripheral|peripheral devices]]. The [[IBM 350]] RAMAC was introduced in 1956 and was the world's first disk drive. The second generation [[disk storage|disk data storage units]] were able to store tens of millions of letters and digits. Next to the [[Hard disk drive|fixed disk storage units]], connected to the CPU via high-speed data transmission, were removable disk data storage units. A removable disk stack can be easily exchanged with another stack in a few seconds. Even if the removable disks' capacity is smaller than fixed disks,' their
