network did not gain a public face until the 1990s. On 6 August 1991, [[CERN]], a pan-European organization for particle research, publicized the new [[World Wide Web]] project. The Web was invented by British scientist [[Tim Berners-Lee]] in 1989. An early popular [[web browser]] was [[ViolaWWW]], patterned after [[HyperCard]] and built using the [[X Window System]]. It was eventually replaced in popularity by the [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]] web browser. In 1993, the [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications]] at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]] released version 1.0 of Mosaic, and by late 1994 there was growing public interest in the previously academic, technical Internet. By 1996 usage of the word ''Internet'' had become commonplace, and consequently, so had its use as a [[synecdoche]] in reference to the World Wide Web. Meanwhile, over the course of the decade, the Internet successfully accommodated the majority of previously existing public computer networks (although some networks, such as [[FidoNet]], have remained separate). During the late 1990s, it was estimated that traffic on the public Internet grew by 100 percent per year, while the mean annual growth in the number of Internet users was thought to be between 20% and 50%.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/internet.size.pdf |format=PDF| title=The size and growth rate of the Internet | accessdate=2007-05-21 | author=Coffman, K.

While the hardware can often be used to support other software systems, it is the design and the rigorous standardization process of the software architecture that characterizes the Internet and provides the foundation for its scalability and success. The responsibility for the architectural design of the Internet software systems has been delegated to the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/ |title=IETF Home Page |publisher=Ietf.org |date= |accessdate=2009-06-20}}</ref> The IETF conducts standard-setting work groups, open to any individual, about the various aspects of Internet architecture. Resulting discussions and final standards are published in a series of publications, each called a [[Request for Comments]] (RFC), freely available on the IETF web site. The principal methods of networking that enable the Internet are contained in specially designated RFCs that constitute the [[Internet Standard]]s. Other less rigorous documents are simply informative, experimental, or historical, or document the best current practices (BCP) when implementing Internet technologies. The Internet Standards describe a framework known as the [[Internet Protocol Suite]]. This is a model architecture that divides methods into a layered system of protocols (RFC 1122, RFC 1123). The layers correspond to the environment or scope in which their services operate. At the top is the [[Application Layer]], the space for the application-specific networking methods used in software applications, e.g., a web browser program. Below this top layer, the [[Transport Layer]] connects applications on ''different hosts'' via the network (e.g., [[client–server model]]) with appropriate data exchange methods. Underlying these layers are the core networking technologies, consisting of two layers. The [[Internet Layer]] enables computers to identify and locate each other via [[IP address|Internet Protocol (IP) addresses]], and allows them to connect to one-another via intermediate (transit) networks. Lastly, at the bottom of the architecture, is a software layer, the [[Link Layer]], that provides connectivity between hosts on the same local network link, such as a local area network ([[LAN]]) or a [[Dial-up Internet access|dial-up connection]]. The model, also known as [[TCP/IP]], is designed to be independent of the underlying hardware which the model therefore does not concern itself with in any detail. Other models have been developed, such as the [[Open Systems Interconnection]] (OSI) model, but they are not compatible in the details of description, nor implementation, but many similarities exist and the TCP/IP protocols are usually included in the discussion of OSI networking. The most prominent component of the Internet model is the [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) which provides addressing systems ([[IP address]]es) for computers on the Internet. IP enables [[internetworking]] and essentially establishes the Internet itself. IP Version 4 ([[IPv4]]) is the initial version used on the first generation of the today's Internet and is still in dominant use. It was designed to address up to ~4.3 billion (10<sup>9</sup>) Internet hosts. However, the explosive growth of the Internet has led to [[IPv4 address exhaustion]] which is estimated to enter its final stage in approximately 2011.<ref>{{cite web | last=Huston | first=Geoff | title=IPv4 Address Report, daily generated | url=http://www.potaroo.net/tools/ipv4/index.html | accessdate=2009-05-20}}</ref> A new protocol version, [[IPv6]], was developed in the mid 1990s which provides vastly larger addressing capabilities and more efficient
