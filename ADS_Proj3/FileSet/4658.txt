also includes a tool to clean the [[Windows Registry]] from superfluous and faulty software entries which are often the result of incompletely uninstalled software. '''2 million''' users already profit from the reliable and secure UpdateStar service per month (December 2009) and receive updates for their PCs software{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}. UpdateStar currently provides users with program update information for '''4.5 million''' installations - daily{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}. UpdateStar released version 5 on Oct 19, 2009 introducing improved version recognition, improved Windows 7 support, new language support for Korean and Lithuanian, and improved translations of Russian, Hungarian, and Romanian<ref>[http://client.updatestar.com/files/press/pr_20091019_updatestar.pdf Press release 2009-10-19. Retrieved on 2010-02-23.]</ref>. == Revenue model == UpdateStar uses the software search engine website to share ad revenue with software authors. Other professional services include software market research (Analytics) as well as targeted marketing services (Connect) to software vendors. This allows UpdateStar to provide their update information service for free to their user community. === Share - the ad sharing program === The UpdateStar website tracks created ad revenues on program pages. The Share program creates PPC based revenue streams. When users click on ads on a program’s download page in the UpdateStar web, the advertiser is charged and the advertising fee is split between UpdateStar and the software vendor, if the vendor participates as a Share partner. UpdateStar website’s user traffic comes from targeted alerts about newly available updates for used software and offering information and downloads. Traffic multiplies with the number of updates and users. This way Share software vendor partners participate repeatedly from revenue created with their content (their software) as long as they participate. == Online Backup == In February 2010, UpdateStar started to offer a commercial [[online backup]] service called UpdateStar Online Backup<ref>[http://client.updatestar.com/files/press/pr_20100211_updatestar.pdf Press release 2010-02-11. Retrieved on 2010-02-23.]</ref>. Users of UpdateStar Online Backup can select files and folders through a [[desktop application]], which are then periodically backed up to a remote data center. The program employs a [[differential backup]] algorithm to minimize the amount of data that needs to be backed up on subsequent runs. UpdateStar offers plans with unlimited storage for home and business [[desktop computer]]s and limited storage (100 [[Gigabyte|GB]], 250 [[Gigabyte|GB]], 500 [[Gigabyte|GB]]) for [[server computer]]s. The program runs on [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows 7]] (desktop edition), and [[Windows Server 2003]] and [[Windows Server 2008]] (server edition). == See also == * [[User-generated content]] == References == <references /> == External links == * [http://www.updatestar.com UpdateStar] * [http://client.updatestar.com/en/onlinebackup/overview/ UpdateStar Online Backup] * [http://www.killerstartups.com/Web-App-Tools/updatestar-com-simplify-your-software-life KillerStartups about UpdateStar] * [http://www.softpedia.com/reviews/windows/UpdateStar--Review-72586.shtml Softpedia, Only the Latest Updates for the Software on Your PC] * [http://www.kcsoftwares.com/?sumo SUMo, precursor to UpdateStar and main competitor]{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Updatestar}} [[Category:Windows software]] [[Category:Windows-only freeware]] [[Category:Package management systems]]</text> </page> <page> <id>39014</id> <title>Uppaal Model Checker</title> <text>{{Infobox software | name = UPPAAL | logo = | screenshot = | caption = | developer = [[Uppsala University]]<br/>[[Aalborg University]] | released = {{Start date|1999}} | latest release version = 4.0.11 | latest release date = {{release date and age|2010|02|11}} | latest preview version = | latest preview date = | programming_language = [[C++]] and [[GUI]] in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] | operating system = [[Linux]]<br/>[[Mac OS X]]<br/>[[Microsoft Windows]] | platform = | genre = [[Model checking]] | language = [[English language|English]] | license = [[Commercial Licenses]]<br/>[[Academic Licenses]] | website = http://www.uppaal.com/ }} '''Uppaal''' is an integrated [[tool]] [[software platform|environment]] for [[model checking|modeling]], validation and verification of [[real-time computing|real-time]] systems modeled as networks of timed [[automaton|automata]], extended with [[data type]]s (bounded integers, arrays etc.).

This [[artifact (software development)|artifact]] is short and inexpensive to produce early in the analysis or envisioning stages of a software development project. There are a wide array of different process models for software development. Some processes, like the [[Rational Unified Process]], define clear goals for creating the Use Case Survey, while other processes do not mention this artifact at all. In practice, the use case survey can be valuable for the following reasons: # By creating a single list of the use cases, the analyst effectively creates a detailed list of potential scope items for one or more projects. This provides an excellent introduction to the business problem for those individuals who need to learn the context of a project. # With a single list of use cases, an analyst can work with business customers to determine if the elements of business process change envisioned by the tools is sensible, long before prototypes or wire-frames would be useful. # The fact that the use case survey is inexpensive to produce and is fairly easy to understand makes it less difficult to change. No one, including the analyst, is heavily invested in the effort that produces this artifact. # The use case survey is not the scope of the project per se. It is intended to be the scope of the business problem. As a result, each of the aspects of the business problem can be weighed for priority and considered by different [[project shareholder|stakeholder]]s before the project scope is actually decided. This helps form common consensus and reduces a potential cause of friction later. # The survey itself can be viewed as a holistic view of the business problem. This is a useful tool for analysis because each of the stakeholders can review the list to make sure that their processes are captured and described. Gaps can be easily identified before the project scope is finalized and costs are estimated. This reduces the chance that a project will deliver a solution for one
