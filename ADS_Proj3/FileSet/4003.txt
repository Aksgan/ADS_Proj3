parts, but through complex interactions, the parts create a system whose behavior is difficult to predict and model. In many cases, a main source of complexity in a service system is its people, whether those at the client, those at the provider, or those at other organizations. Service systems are designed and constructed, are often very large, and as complex systems, they have emergent properties. This makes them a kind of engineering system (in MIT’s terms – see http://esd.mit.edu). Large-scale service systems include, for instance, major metropolitan hospitals, highway or high-rise construction projects, or large IT outsourcing operations in which one company takes over the daily operations of IT infrastructure for another. In all these cases, systems are designed and built to provide and sustain service, yet because of their complexity and size, operations do not always go smoothly, and all interactions and results cannot be anticipated. ==Toward a Science of Service== There is a long history of academic and industrial interest in the service sector – starting with [[Adam Smith]] and continuing right up to the present day. Yet most such interest in service has focused narrowly on marketing or management or economics. With the rise of [[Web Services|technology-enabled services]], many traditionally manufacturing-based companies have begun to see more and more revenue generated by service operations. So in industry, there was a growing recognition that service innovation is now as important – if not more important than – technology innovation. Yet, service innovation is generally unknown (save for a few economists studying the relationship between investment and innovation in service industries; e.g., GADREY & GALLOUJ). The key to service science is interdisciplinarity, focusing not merely on one aspect of service but rather on service as a system of interacting parts that include people, technology, and business. As such, service science draws on ideas from a number of existing disciplines – including computer science, cognitive science, economics, organizational behavior, human resources management, marketing, operations research, and others – and aims to integrate them into a coherent whole. In fact, IBM relabeled its initiative in this area [http://www.ibm.com/university/ssme Service Science, Management, and Engineering] to highlight the interdisciplinary nature of the effort. HP has created the [http://www.services-sciences.org Centre for Systems and Services Sciences] for the same reason. Oracle Corp. working with IBM, joined in creating an industry consortium called the [http://www.thesrii.org Service Research and Innovation Initiative] focused on establishing what it calls "service science" as both a key area for investment by companies and governments and as a full-blown academic discipline. The NESSI (Networked European Software and Services Initiative) group in the European Union has established a [http://www.nessi-europe.com/Nessi/Workinggroups/HorizontalWorkingGroups/ServicesSciences/tabid/244/Default.aspx Services Sciences Working Group.] Definitions of 'service science' can be misleading. An analogy can be made with Computer Science. The success of CS is not in the definition of a basic science (as in physics or chemistry for example) but more in its ability to bring together diverse disciplines, such as mathematics, electronics and psychology to solve problems that require they all be there and talk a language that demonstrates common purpose. Services Science may be the same thing - just bigger - as an interdisciplinary umbrella that enables economists, social scientists, mathematicians, computer scientists and legislators (to name a small subset of the necessary disciplines) to cooperate in order to achieve a larger goal - analysis, construction, management and evolution of the most complex systems we have ever attempted to construct. Universities have begun to act on the need for service science or SSME as well. For instance, UC Berkeley created an [http://ssme.berkeley.edu SSME program]. And North Carolina State University created an [http://www.mgt.ncsu.edu/mba/academics/concentrations_services_curricula_info.php MBA track] for service and a computer engineering degree for services well. In both cases, the schools recognize the interdisciplinary character of the field and incorporate content from a variety of disciplines. Other schools with interdisciplinary interests in SSME include [http://www.cmu.edu Carnegie Mellon University], [http://ssme.rhsmith.umd.edu University of Maryland], [http://wpcarey.asu.edu/csl Arizona State University], [http://niu.edu Northern Illinois University], [http://ssme.soe.ucsc.edu UC Santa Cruz], [http://www.cob.sjsu.edu/ssme San Jose State University], [http://dsl.cs.usu.edu/cisc.html Utah State University], [http://www.dses.rpi.edu RPI], [[University of Manchester]], [[Helsinki University of Technology]], [http://www.usyd.edu.au/news/84.html?newsstoryid=1651 The University of Sydney], [http://www.eorg.uni-karlsruhe.de/servicescience.htm Karlsruhe Institute of Technology], [http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/newsroom/article170308/index.shtml National University of Singapore], [http://www.sis.smu.edu.sg/programme/SSME/index.asp Singapore Management University], [http://ssme.fi.muni.cz/ Masaryk University] and a MBA in Services Sciences, Management And Engineering at [http://liss.ulusofona.pt/index.php/component/content/article/20 Lusofona University - Information Systems School (Portugal)].
