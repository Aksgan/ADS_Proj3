Therefore, most Spanish citizens are against censorship of any kind and prefer personal responsibility and liberalism, thus very few people show serious respect for certification of films. For example, cinemas in Spain never ask for identification.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} * '''APTA''' - Suitable for all audiences * '''Especialmente Recomendada para la Infancia''' - Especially suitable for small children * '''7''' - Suitable for audiences 7 and older * '''12''' - Suitable for audiences 12 and older * '''16''' - Suitable for audiences 16 and older * '''18''' - Suitable for audiences 18 and older * '''Película X''' - Pornographic movie, violence apology.

This means that films not intended for public viewing do not have to be screened; however, this is the practice: when a film is let through, is rated and not prohibited, it can not be considered to violate any laws regarding its content. It is a criminal offense to hire or sell videos containing unlawful depictions of violence, thus meaning that the distributor could be held responsible for the content of a film if unrated or prohibited. It is illegal also to rent or sell videos depicting realistic violence to children below the age of 15. The censors, scientific professionals in the field of [[behavioural sciences]], are contracted for a term of two years (so that they do not become habituated) and rate films so that they are not harmful in any psychological or behavioral sense for a certain age group - and not if the film is suitable for the age group, a common misconception. Violence is seen as far more socially disruptive than consensual sexual acts, nudity or strong language, which is generally looked at more liberally than violence. This can have the effect that some PG or PG-13 rated films in USA are being rated "15 years" in Sweden for violence, while some films getting an R in USA for containing profanity or depictions of sexuality are rated at 7 or 11 years, or even for all audiences. The censors have the option to cut out scenes from ''15 years'' films if they are considered brutalizing. However, this has been used only rarely in the last 15 years. The director-general has expressed that the censors have a hard time convincing friends and even themselves that anything in a non-pornographic movie would affect the values of an adult, especially in a brutalizing manner. There is a strong political opinion for dismantling the board in the future and to replace it with a solution similar to that in Denmark or Norway. Even though it is practically inactive, government censorship is widely seen as a pre-democratic anachronism, especially in a society which portraits itself as one of the banners bearer when it comes to freedom of expression. However, disagreements on the details have stalled the question. The following categories are used by the SBB: * '''Btl''' ''Barntillåten'' (Children allowed) Suitable for all ages. * '''7 years''' ''7 År'' is deemed non-harming for children of at least 7 years of age. Younger children are not admitted unless accompanied by an adult 18 or older, may include drug use. * '''11 years''' ''11 År'' is deemed non-harming for children of at least 11 years of age. Children of at least 7 years of age are admitted if accompanied by an adult 18 or older, may include mild drug use, obscured depictions of consensual sexual activity. * '''15 years''' ''15 År'' states that no one under 15 years of age is admitted, may include strong drug use, explicit depictions of sexual activity. This also includes [[pornography]]; however, it is not shown at ordinary cinemas. There are common unofficial ratings used by television channels, rental shops and adult cinemas to hinder persons below the age of 18 years to be exposed to pornography, such as ''Barnförbjuden'' ("prohibited for minors"), ''18 År'' ("18 years") and ''Vuxenfilm'' ("movies for adults"). * '''Prohibited''' ''Förbjuden'' If considered to be brutalizing, films can be banned from public display, these films include scenes of prolonged or intrusive graphic violence, or sexual violence and constraint. There is a possible gap between what the boards puts its prohibited stamp on and what's considered illegal due to its content, making some prohibited films possible to obtain for private use or to be seen by members of closed societies at cinemas. No (non-pornographic) motion picture has been banned since 1996. ==Switzerland== Switzerland is composed of 26 [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]], each having their own rating system.
