It was "released" in February 1985, ran on [[VAX]] hardware, and was a variant of [[Berkeley Software Distribution|4.1cBSD]] with some [[UNIX System V#SVR2|System V.1 (SVR2)]] features (notably the [[shell (computing)|shell]]). V8 was the successor to [[Version 7 Unix|V7]] and the predecessor to [[Version 9 Unix|V9]]. V8 is perhaps best remembered for its [[regular expression]] (RE) matching library, which established a [[de facto]] standard for RE syntax until a [[POSIX]] standard was developed. It also introduced the [[STREAMS]] I/O mechanism, the <tt>[[Procfs|/proc]]</tt> filesystem, kernel support for [[interpreter directive]]s, and several other features later incorporated into [[UNIX System V#SVR3|System V.2 (SVR3)]] and subsequent versions of Unix. V8 also featured a [[Distributed file system|network file system]], which permitted access to other machines' entire filesystem trees. For example, the file <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> on [[Server (computing)|server]] <tt>foovax</tt> would be accessible to [[Client (computing)|client]] machines as <tt>/n/foovax/etc/passwd</tt>. ''[[The Unix Programming Environment]]'' was prepared on a VAX-11/750 running a preliminary version of V8 Unix.

According to the separability of electronic and nuclear motion in the [[Born-Oppenheimer approximation]], the [[vibrational transition]] and electronic transition may be described separately. The [[selection rule]] for electronic transitions is given by [[Koopmans' theorem]], while that for vibrational transitions is described by the [[Franck-Condon principle]]. Most processes leading to the absorption and emission of [[visible light]], and therefore the colorful world around us, are due to vibronic transitions. This may be contrasted to pure electronic transitions which occur in [[atom]]s and lead to sharp monochromatic lines (e.g. in a [[sodium vapor lamp]]) or pure vibrational transitions which only absorb or emit [[infrared light]]. == See also == * [[Vibronic coupling]] == External links == * [http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/V06618.pdf Definition of "vibronic transition"] in the [[IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology]] {{physical-chemistry-stub}} [[Category:Quantum chemistry]] [[fr:Transition vibronique]]</text> </page> <page> <id>39385</id> <title>Victor Basili</title> <text>'''Victor R.
