perform 3 actions. You need to guess what the foal wants based on what it does. Each week, you should go to the library and read up on foal care, and take notes so you can look at them and decide which action you think your foal is doing, and act accordingly. '''Learning:''' Once you have your foal, you need to raise it. Learning involves you teach your foal different gaits. ==Horsez 2== A sequel was created for Horsez. With somewhat similar plots: the main character is a young woman named Emma. She was sent to France to train to become a veterinarian. However, with the taxi broken down, she has no choice but to take refuge in a small, quiet town. There, she meets Oliver, a nephew of his aunt's stud farm, who is missing its real owner, Marie. After finding out Emma is a vet, he offers to give her shelter if she helps them with a mare in foal. Emma agrees, after meeting Flora, Micheal (formerly called Miguel in Horsez), and Carol, the character is given some objectives. The character delivers a healthy foal, and then is given the choice of the player to stay with the stud farm or leave as a vet. Either way, the game still continues. Most of the main parts are: The character is given a challenge to spy on the Mayor, who wants to take over the stud farm for a housing development. The character saves Oliver in three different ways. The character is given secondary objectives to complete. The character competes in competitions for extra money and horse breeds. In the end, the characters win back the stud farm, though end results are dependent on the player's choices throughout the game. In one part, find out that Marie is still alive and well. In this ending she leaves the stud farm to Flora, and promises to visit soon, having settled in New Zealand. Other possible endings include Emma getting Oliver (and herself) tickets to the US so she can show him her country, and Emma and Oliver sharing a kiss on the beach. ==External links== *[http://petz.uk.ubi.com Ubisoft's Official Petz Website] *[http://petz.us.ubi.com/horsez Ubisoft's US Horsez Website] *[http://www.pippafunnellgame.com Official Pippa Funnell games Website] [[Category:2006 video games]] [[Category:Game Boy Advance games]] [[Category:Nintendo DS games]] [[Category:PlayStation 2 games]] [[Category:Ubisoft Entertainment games]] [[Category:Video games developed in Japan]] [[Category:Virtual pets]] [[Category:Windows games]] [[it:Horsez]]</text> </page> <page> <id>16979</id> <title>Host system</title> <text>{{Unreferenced stub|auto=yes|date=December 2009}} '''Host system''' is any [[computer networking|networked]] computer that provides services to other systems or users.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}<!-- are services really necessary? isn't a client also a host? --> These services may include but are not limited to [[Computer printer|printer]], [[World wide web|web]] or [[database]] access.
