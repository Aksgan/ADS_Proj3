the scale giving points <math>((x_1-\bar{x})/s,(y_1-\bar{y})/s)</math>. Other methods for removing the scale are also used. Removing the rotational component is more complex. Consider two objects with scale and translation removed, let the points of these be <math>((x_1,y_1),\ldots)</math>, <math>((w_1,z_1),\ldots)</math>. Fix one of these and rotate the other around the origin so that the sum of the squared distances between the points is minimised. A rotation by angle <math>\theta\,\!</math> gives <math>(u_1,v_1) = (\cos\theta\,w_1-\sin\theta\,z_1,\,\sin\theta\,w_1+\cos\theta\,z_1)\,\!</math>. (Where the points (u,v) are the rotated results of (w,z)).The '''Procrustes distance''' is :<math> d = \sqrt{(u_1-x_1)^2+(v_1-y_1)^2+\cdots}, \,</math> the distance can be minimised by using a [[least squares]] technique to find the angle <math>\theta</math> which gives the minimum distance. Taking the derivative of <math> (u_1-x_1)^2+(v_1-y_1)^2+\cdots </math> with respect to <math>\theta</math> and solving for <math>\theta</math> when the derivative is zero gives :<math> \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\sum_{i=1}^k(w_iy_i - z_ix_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^k(w_ix_i + z_iy_i)}\right). </math> == Variations == There are many ways of representing the shape of an object. The shape of object can be considered as a member of an equivalence class formed by taking the set of all sets of ''k'' points in ''n'' dimensions, that is '''R'''<sup>kn</sup> and factoring out the set of all translations, rotations and scalings. A particular representation of shape is found by choosing a particular representation of the equivalence class. This will give a [[manifold]] of dimension ''kn''-4. Procrustes is one method of doing this with particular statistical justification. Bookstein obtains a representation of shape by fixing the position of two points called the bases line. One point will be fixed at the origin and the other at (1,0) the remaining points form the ''Bookstein'' coordinates. It is also common to consider ''shape and scale'' that is with translational and rotational components removed. == Examples == [[Shape analysis]] is used in [[biological data]] to identify the variations of anatomical features characterised by landmark data, for example in considering the shape of jaw bones.<ref>[http://www.rps.psu.edu/mar94/goodall.html "Exploring Space Shape"] by Nancy Marie Brown, Research/Penn State, Vol. 15, no. 1, March 1994</ref> One study by [[David George Kendall]] examined the triangles formed by [[standing stones]] to deduce if these were often arranged in straight lines. The shape of a triangle can be represented as a point on the sphere, and the distribution of all shapes can be though of a distribution over the sphere. The sample distribution from the standing stones was compared with the theoretical distribution to show that the occurrence of straight lines was no more than average.<ref>[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0883-4237(198905)4%3A2%3C87%3AASOTST%3E2.0.CO%3B2-P "A Survey of the Statistical Theory of Shape"], by David G.

It tends to perform very well, due to the simplicity of design. The device is split into two main areas. At the beginning of the device is the metadata section, which consists of a root block, and a generic array of blocks that can be allocated to store metadata. The rest of the device is another contiguous generic array of blocks that can be allocated to store data. The metadata section usually uses a few percent of the device, depending on the size of the device. The metadata is stored as a tree of single blocks in the metadata section. The entire directory structure is recorded in the metadata, so the data section purely contains data from files. The metadata describes the location of data in files with extents of blocks, which makes the metadata quite compact. When a metadata update occurs, the system looks at the block containing the metadata to be changed, and copies it to a newly-allocated block from the metadata section, with the change made, then it recursively changes the metadata in the block that points to that block in the same way. This way, eventually the root block needs to be changed, which causes the atomic metadata update. The filesystem is reasonably good at keeping files unfragmented, although there is a defragmentation tool available which will work on an online filesystem. It was the first filesystem to introduce the concept of the [[Recycle bin (computing)|Recycle Bin]] natively at filesystem-level to the Amiga, holding the last few deleted files in a hidden directory on the disk root. As is common (and generally required) with Amiga filesystems, the filesystem does not need to be unmounted in order to be "cleanly" mounted afterwards.

Lack of performance is most often component failure. The predicted time becomes then the '''remaining useful life''' (RUL). The science of prognostics is based on the analysis of failure modes, detection of early signs of wear and aging, and fault conditions. These signs are then correlated with a damage propagation model. Potential uses for prognostics is in [[condition-based maintenance]]. The discipline that links studies of failure mechanisms to system lifecycle management is often referred to as '''prognostics and health management''' ('''PHM'''), sometimes
