at one time, one waiting for acknowledgement, and one waiting for EOI. There are a number of common priority schemas in PICs including hard priorities, specific priorities, and rotating priorities. Interrupts may be either [[interrupt#Edge-triggered|edge triggered]] or [[interrupt#Level-triggered|level triggered]]. There are a number of common ways of acknowledging an interrupt has completed when an EOI is issued. These include specifying which interrupt completed, using an implied interrupt which has completed (usually the highest priority pending in the ISR), and treating interrupt acknowledgement as the EOI. ==Well-known types== One of the best known PICs, the [[Intel 8259|8259A]], was included in the [[x86 architecture|x86]] PC. In modern times, this is not included as a separate chip in an x86 PC. Rather, its function is included as part of the motherboard's [[Southbridge (computing)|southbridge]] chipset. In other cases, it has been replaced by the newer [[Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller]]s which support more interrupt outputs and more flexible priority schemas. ==More information== More information on the Intel APIC can be found in the ''IA-32 Intel Architecture Software Developer's Manual, Volume 3A: System Programming Guide, Part 1, Chapter 10'', freely available on the [[Intel]] website. ==See also== * [[Intel 8259]] * [[Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller]] (APIC) * [[Intel APIC Architecture]] * [[Inter-processor interrupt]] (IPI) * [[Interrupt]] * [[Interrupt handler]] * [[Interrupt request]] (IRQ) * [[Interrupt latency]] * [[Non-maskable interrupt]] (NMI) ==External links== * [http://www.intel.com/Assets/PDF/manual/253668.pdf IA-32 Intel Architecture Software Developer's Manual, Volume 3A] [[Category:Motherboard]] [[Category:Digital electronics]] [[Category:Interrupts]] [[cs:Řadič přerušení]] [[de:Programmable Interrupt Controller]] [[it:Controllore di Interruzioni Programmabile]] [[ms:Pengawal Sampukan boleh aturcara]] [[nl:Programmable Interrupt Controller]] [[ja:Programmable Interrupt Controller]] [[pt:Programmable Interrupt Controller]] [[ru:Контроллер прерываний]] [[uk:Контролер переривань]]</text> </page> <page> <id>30204</id> <title>Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly</title> <text>[[Image:Puma Robotic Arm - GPN-2000-001817.jpg|thumb|PUMA arm at NASA]] The '''PUMA''' ('''''P'''rogrammable '''U'''niversal '''M'''achine for '''A'''ssembly'', or '''''P'''rogrammable '''U'''niversal '''M'''anipulation '''A'''rm'') is an industrial robot arm developed by [[Victor Scheinman]] at pioneering [[robot]] company [[Unimation]]. Initially developed for [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], the PUMA was based on earlier designs Scheinman invented while at [[Stanford University]]. Unimation produced PUMAs for years until being purchased by [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]] (ca. 1980), and later by Swiss company [[Stäubli]] (1988). [[Nokia]] Robotics manufactured about 1500 PUMA robots during the 1980s, the Puma-650 being their most popular model with customers. Nokia sold their Robotics division in 1990. In 2002, General Motors Controls, Robotics and Welding (CRW) organization donated the original prototype PUMA robot to the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History. It joins a distinguished collection of historically important robots that includes an early [[Unimate]] and the Odetics Odex 1.[http://www.roboticsonline.com/public/articles/details.cfm?id=729] ==External links== *[http://www.staubli.com/en/robotics/ Stäubli Robotics] [[Category:Robots]] {{robo-stub}} [[de:PUMA (Roboter)]] [[es:PUMA (robot)]] [[fa:ربات صنعتی پوما]]</text> </page> <page> <id>30208</id> <title>Programmed Data Processor</title> <text>{{refimprove|date=February 2010}} '''Programmed Data Processor''' (abbreviated ''PDP'') was the name of a series of [[minicomputer]]s made by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]. The name 'PDP' intentionally avoided the use of the term 'computer' because at the time of the first PDPs, computers had a reputation of being large, complicated, and expensive machines, and the [[venture capitalist]]s behind Digital (esp. [[Georges Doriot]]) wouldn't support Digital's attempting to build a "computer". The word "minicomputer" was not invented yet. So instead, Digital used their existing line of logic modules to build a ''Programmable Data Processor'' and aimed it at a market which couldn't afford the larger computers. The various PDP machines can generally be grouped into families based on word length. ==PDP series== [[Image:PDP-1.jpg|thumb|PDP-1]] [[Image:DEC PDP 8e.jpg|thumb|PDP-8/e]] [[Image:Pdp-11-40.jpg|thumb|PDP-11/40]] [[Image:PDP-12-Update-Uppsala.jpeg|thumb|PDP-12]] Members of the PDP series include: ;[[PDP-1]]: The original PDP, an [[18-bit]] machine used in early [[time-sharing]] [[operating system]] work, and prominent in early [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hacker]] culture. One of the first [[computer game]]s, [[Spacewar!]], was developed for this machine. ;PDP-2: An unbuilt 24-bit design. ;PDP-3: First 36-bit machine DEC designed, though DEC did not offer it as a product. The only PDP-3 was built by the [[CIA]]'s Scientific Engineering Institute (SEI) in [[Waltham, MA]] to process [[radar cross section]] data for the [[Lockheed A-12]] [[reconnaissance aircraft]] in 1960.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.decconnection.org/announcements.htm |title=Announcements from The DEC Connection |date=2007-02-14 |accessdate=2008-11-24 |work=The DEC Connection}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/dec-faq/pdp8/ |title=PDP-8 Frequently Asked Questions |date=2001-04-08 |accessdate=2008-11-24 |work=www.faqs.org}}</ref> Architecturally it was essentially a PDP-1 stretched to 36-bit word width. ;PDP-4: Supposed to be a slower, cheaper alternative to the PDP-1, but not commercially successful; all later 18-bit PDP machines were based on its [[instruction set]]. One customer of these early PDP machines was [[Atomic Energy of Canada]]. The installation at Chalk River, Ontario included an early PDP-4 with a display system and a new PDP-5 as interface to the research reactor instrumentation and control. ;PDP-5: DEC's first [[12-bit]] machine. Introduced the instruction set later used in the PDP-8. ;[[PDP-6]]: [[36-bit]] [[timesharing]] machine. Very elegant architecture. It was considered a large [[minicomputer]] or a [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]]. ;[[PDP-7]]: Replacement for the PDP-4; DEC's first [[wire-wrap]]ped machine. The first version of [[Unix]] was for this machine. ;[[PDP-8]]: 12-bit machine with a tiny instruction set; DEC's first major commercial success. Many were purchased by schools, university departments, and research laboratories. Later models were also used in the [[DECmate]] [[word processor]] and the [[VT-78]] [[workstation]]. It is reported that Edson de Castro, who had been a key member of the design team, left to form [[Data General]] when his design for a 16-bit successor to the PDP-8 was rejected in favour of the PDP-11; the "PDP-X" did NOT resemble the [[Data General Nova]], although that is a common myth. ;[[LINC-8]]: A hybrid of the [[LINC]] and PDP-8 computers; two instruction sets. Progenitor of the PDP-12. ;PDP-9: Successor to the PDP-7, DEC's first [[micro-program]]med machine. ;[[PDP-10]]: 36-bit timesharing machine, and fairly successful over several different models. The instruction set was a slightly elaborated form of that of the PDP-6. ;[[PDP-11]]: The archetypal minicomputer; a [[16-bit]] machine and another commercial success for DEC. (Also the LSI-11, primarily for [[embedded system]]s). The [[32-bit]] [[VAX]] series was descended from it, and early VAX models had a PDP-11 compatibility mode. The 16-bit PDP-11 instruction set has been very influential, with processors ranging from the [[Motorola 68000]] to the [[Renesas]] [[Renesas H8|H8]] and [[Texas Instruments]] [[MSP430]], inspired
