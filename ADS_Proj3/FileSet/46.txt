It was developed by [[Robert Fourer]], [[David Gay]] and [[Brian Kernighan]] at [[Bell Labs|Bell Laboratories]]. AMPL does not solve problems directly; instead, it calls appropriate external [[solver]]s (such as [[CPLEX]], [[FortMP]], [[MINOS (solver)|MINOS]], [[IPOPT]], [[SNOPT]], [[KNITRO]], and so on) to obtain solutions. Problems are passed to solvers as [[nl (format)|nl files]]. One particular advantage of AMPL is the similarity of its syntax to the mathematical notation of [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problems. This allows for a very concise and readable definition of problems in the domain of [[mathematical programming|optimization]]. Many modern solvers available on the NEOS <ref name="neos">http://www-neos.mcs.anl.gov/neos/</ref> server hosted at the [[Argonne National Laboratory]] accept AMPL input. According to the NEOS statistics AMPL is the most popular format for representing mathematical programming problems. ==Availability== AMPL is available for many popular 32- and 64-bit platforms including [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[Windows]]. It is a proprietary software currently maintained by AMPL Optimization LLC. However there exist several online services <ref name="neos"/><ref>http://www.ampl.com/TRYAMPL/</ref> providing free modeling and solving facilities using AMPL. Also a free student version with limited functionality is available <ref>http://www.ampl.com/DOWNLOADS/index.html</ref>. ==Optimization problems supported== AMPL handles a wide range of problem types, among them: * [[Linear programming]] * [[Quadratic programming]] * [[Nonlinear programming]] * [[Linear_programming#Integer_unknowns|Mixed-integer programming]] * Mixed-integer quadratic programming with or without [[Convex function|convex]] quadratic constraints * Mixed-integer nonlinear programming * [[Global optimization]] * [[Semidefinite programming]] problems with [[Bilinear form|bilinear]] matrix inequalities * [[Complementarity theory|Complementarity problems]] (MPECs) in discrete or continuous variables ==Timeline== * 1990 Paper describing the AMPL modeling language was published in [[Management Science: A Journal of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences|Management Science]]<ref> {{Cite journal | authorlink = Robert Fourer | authorlink = David M.

Use of AMSRefs allows for the retention of rich [[markup language|markup]] that makes references easier to reuse in other publishing environments, such as on the [[Internet|Web]], in other book or journal formats, or with citation services. The package is available for free on the [[American Mathematical Society]]'s website. The purpose of AMSRefs is to provide a simpler, more flexible way to use many of the bibliography and citation features that users of LaTeX and [[BibTeX]] have come to expect. AMSRefs has been designed to encourage the preservation of structured markup of the bibliography throughout the entire lifetime of a document, from rough draft to final archival version. It does this by replacing the unstructured [[.bbl]] file format of LaTeX by a fully structured format. The package is compatible with the “showkeys”, “hyperref”, and “backrefs” packages and implements the functionality of the “cite” package. AMSRefs provides that the bibliography style is controlled completely through LaTeX instead of being determined partly by a BibTeX style file and partly through
