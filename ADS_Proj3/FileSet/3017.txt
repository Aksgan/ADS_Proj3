This commission issues an age recommendation for each title from the following list: *Freigegeben für alle Altersstufen - no age restriction *Freigegeben ab 6 Jahren - not recommended for people younger than 6 years of age *Freigegeben ab 10 Jahren - not recommended for people younger than 10 years of age *Freigegeben ab 12 Jahren - not recommended for people younger than 12 years of age *Freigegeben ab 14 Jahren - not recommended for people younger than 14 years of age *Freigegeben ab 16 Jahren - not recommended for people younger than 16 years of age The ratings are published on the ministries website and can be either accepted or changed by the nine [[States of Austria|federal states]]. === DVD and video === Home video releases are not rated in Austria. Usually the [[Motion picture rating system#Germany|German FSK-ratings]] are printed on the cases, although they do not have any legal meaning. For this reason many films which are banned in Germany can be bought on [[DVD]] in Austria. ==Belgium== There are only three classifications for movies shown in Belgian movie theatres: * '''KT/EA''' - '''Kinderen Toegelaten/Enfants Admis''' (Children Admitted) - Allowed for all * '''KNT/ENA''' - '''Kinderen Niet Toegelaten/Enfants Non Admis''' (Children Not Admitted) - Not allowed for children younger than 16 of age * '''E''' - Exempt For DVD releases, Belgium uses the [[#Netherlands|same system as the Netherlands]]. ==Brazil== [[Image:Brazilian film and TV rating system.png|right|thumb|150px|Symbols used by the Ministry of Justice for the film ratings]] Movies are rated in Brazil by the [[DJCTQ]], or Department of Justice, Rating, Titles and Qualification (''Departamento de Justiça, Classificação, Títulos e Qualificação'' in Portuguese), controlled by the Brazilian [[Justice ministry|Ministry of Justice]] (''Ministério da Justiça'').
