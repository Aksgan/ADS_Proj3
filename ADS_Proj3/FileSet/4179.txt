laws where it appears, for example, by determining the values of the electromagnetic constants ''ε''<sub>0</sub> and ''μ''<sub>0</sub> and using their relation to ''c''. Historically, the most precise results have been obtained by separately determining the frequency and wavelength of a lightwave, with their product equaling ''c''. In 1983 the metre was defined as "the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1⁄299,792,458 of a second",<ref name=Resolution_1/> fixing the value of the speed of light at {{val|299792458|u=m/s}} by definition, as [[#Increased accuracy and redefinition of the metre|described below]]. Consequently, precision measurements of the speed of light yield a precise realization of the metre rather than a precise value of ''c''. ===Astronomical measurements=== [[Outer space]] is a natural setting for measuring the speed of light because of its large scale and nearly perfect [[vacuum]]. Typically, one measures the time needed for light to traverse some reference distance in the [[solar system]], such as the [[radius]] of the Earth's orbit. Historically, such measurements could be made fairly accurately, compared to how accurately the length of the reference distance is known in Earth-based units. It is customary to express the results in [[astronomical unit]]s (AU) per day. An astronomical unit is approximately the average distance between the Earth and Sun; it is not based on the [[International System of Units]].{{#tag:ref|The astronomical unit is defined the radius of an unperturbed circular Newtonian orbit about the Sun of a particle having infinitesimal mass, moving with an [[angular frequency]] of {{gaps|0.017|202|098|95}} [[radian]]s (approximately {{frac|{{val|365.256898}}}} of a revolution) per day.<ref>{{SIbrochure8th|page=126}}. </ref> It may be noted that the astronomical unit increases at a rate of about (15 ± 4) cm/yr, probably due to the changing mass of the Sun.<ref name=Nieto>{{cite journal |id={{arxiv|0907.2469}} |title=Astrometric solar-system anomalies |author=John D.

The distance travelled by light from the planet (or its moon) to Earth is shorter when the Earth is at the point in its orbit that is closest to its planet than when the Earth is at the farthest point in its orbit, the difference in distance being the [[diameter]] of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The observed change in the moon's orbital period is actually the difference in the time it takes light to traverse the shorter or longer distance. Rømer observed this effect for [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]]'s innermost moon [[Io (moon)|Io]] and deduced that light takes 22 minutes to cross the diameter of the Earth's orbit.

While the light travels down the telescope to its eyepiece, the telescope moves to the right. For the light to stay inside the telescope, the telescope must be tilted to the right, causing the distant source to appear at a different location to the right.]] Another method is to use the [[aberration of light]], discovered and explained by [[James Bradley]] in the 18th century.<ref name="Bradley1729">{{Cite journal |last=Bradley |first=J |year=1729 |title=Account of a new discoved Motion of the Fix'd Stars |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k55840n.image.f375.langEN |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions]] |volume=35 |pages=637–660 |doi= }}</ref> This effect results from the [[vector addition]] of the velocity of light arriving from a distant source (such as a star) and the velocity of its observer (see diagram on the right). A moving observer thus sees the light coming from a slightly different direction and consequently sees the source at a position shifted from its original position. Since the direction of the Earth's velocity changes continuously as the Earth orbits the Sun, this effect causes the apparent position of stars to move around.

In 1729, Bradley used this method to derive that light travelled 10,210 times faster than the Earth in
