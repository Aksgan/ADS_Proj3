of a [[memetracker]]. The project is no longer active, but a similar function is now served by [[tailrank.com]]. Blogs are given rankings by [[Technorati]] based on the number of incoming links and [[Alexa Internet]] based on the Web hits of Alexa Toolbar users. In August 2006, Technorati found that the most linked-to blog on the internet was that of Chinese actress [[Xu Jinglei]].<ref name="Fickling">Fickling, David, [http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/news/archives/2006/08/15/internet_killed_the_tv_star.html Internet killed the TV star], [[The Guardian]] NewsBlog, 15 August 2006</ref> Chinese media [[Xinhua]] reported that this blog received more than 50 million page views, claiming it to be the most popular blog in the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-08/24/content_672747.htm|title=Xu Jinglei most popular blogger in world|date=2006-08-24|accessdate=2008-06-05|publisher=China Daily}}</ref> Technorati rated [[Boing Boing]] to be the most-read group-written blog.<ref name="Fickling"/> <!-- The section below is out of date, but interesting - someone want to follow up on it? [[Gartner]] forecasts that blogging will peak in 2007, leveling off when the number of writers who maintain a personal Web site reaches 100 million. Gartner analysts expect that the novelty value of the medium will wear off as most people who are interested in the phenomenon have checked it out, and new bloggers will offset the number of writers who abandon their creation out of boredom. The firm estimates that there are more than 200 million former bloggers who have ceased posting to their online diaries, creating an exponential rise in the amount of "dotsam" and "netsam" — that is to say, unwanted objects on the Web (analogous to flotsam and jetsam). --> ==Blurring with the mass media== Many bloggers, particularly those engaged in [[participatory journalism]], differentiate themselves from the [[mainstream media]], while others are members of that media working through a different channel. Some institutions see blogging as a means of "getting around the filter" and pushing [[messages]] directly to the public. Some critics worry that bloggers respect neither [[copyright]] nor the role of the [[mass media]] in presenting society with credible news. Bloggers and other contributors to [[user generated content|user-generated content]] are behind [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine naming their 2006 [[person of the year]] as "you". Many mainstream journalists, meanwhile, write their own blogs — well over 300, according to CyberJournalist.net's J-blog list.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The first known use of a blog on a news site was in August 1998, when [[Jonathan Dube]] of The [[Charlotte Observer]] published one chronicling Hurricane Bonnie.<ref>{{cite news|title=blogging Bonnie.|work=Poynter.org|date=2003-09-18 |url=http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=52&aid=48413/}}</ref> Some bloggers have moved over to other media. The following bloggers (and others) have appeared on radio and television: [[Atrios|Duncan Black]] (known widely by his pseudonym, Atrios), [[Glenn Reynolds]] ([[Instapundit]]), [[Markos Moulitsas Zúniga]] ([[Daily Kos]]), [[Alex Steffen]] ([[Worldchanging]]), [[Ana Marie Cox]] ([[Wonkette]]), [[Nate Silver]] ([[FiveThirtyEight.com]]), and [[Ezra Klein]] (Ezra Klein blog in ''[[The American Prospect]],'' now in the ''[[Washington Post]]''). In counterpoint, [[Hugh Hewitt]] exemplifies a mass-media personality who has moved in the other direction, adding to his reach in "old media" by being an influential blogger. Equally many established authors, for example [[Mitzi Szereto]] have started using Blogs to not only update fans on their current works but also to expand into new areas of writing. Blogs have also had an influence on [[minority language]]s, bringing together scattered speakers and learners; this is particularly so with blogs in [[Goidelic language|Gaelic languages]]. Minority language publishing (which may lack economic feasibility) can find its audience through inexpensive blogging. There are many examples of bloggers who have published books based on their blogs, e.g., [[Salam Pax]], [[Ellen Simonetti]], [[Jessica Cutler]], [[ScrappleFace]]. Blog-based books have been given the name [[blook]]. A prize for the best blog-based book was initiated in 2005,<ref>{{cite news|title=Blooker rewards books from blogs|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4326908.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=2005-10-11|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref> the [[Lulu Blooker Prize]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Blooker prize honours best blogs|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6446271.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=2007-03-17|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref> However, success has been elusive offline, with many of these books not selling as well as their blogs. Only blogger [[Tucker Max]] made the [[New York Times Bestseller List]].<ref>{{cite news|last=St |first=Warren |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/16/fashion/sundaystyles/16CADS.html?ex=1302840000&en=778087aa367d0620&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss |title=Dude, here's my book |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2006-04-16 |accessdate=2010-07-31}}</ref> The book based on [[Julie Powell]]'s blog "The Julie/Julia Project" was made into the film ''[[Julie & Julia]]'', apparently the first to do so. ==Consumer generated advertising in blogs== [[Consumer generated advertising]] is a relatively new and controversial development and it has created a new model of marketing communication from businesses to consumers. Among the various forms of advertising on blog, the most controversial are the sponsored posts. <ref>Mutum, Dilip and Wang, Qing (2010). “Consumer Generated Advertising in Blogs”. In Neal M. Burns, Terry Daugherty, Matthew S. Eastin (Eds) Handbook of Research on Digital Media and Advertising: User Generated Content Consumption (Vol 1), IGI Global, 248-261.</ref> These are blog entries or posts and may be in the form of feedbacks, reviews, opinion, videos, etc. and usually contain a link back to the desired site using a keyword/s. Blogs have led to some disintermediation and a breakdown of the traditional advertising model where companies can skip over the advertising agencies (previously the only interface with the customer) and contact the customers directly themselves. On the other hand, new companies specialised in blog advertising have been established, to take advantage of this new development as well. However, there are many people who look negatively on this new development. Some believe that any form of commercial activity on blogs will destroy the blogosphere’s credibility. <ref>[http://wwwtechcrunch.com/2006/06/30/payperpostcom-offers-to-buy-your-soul/ PayPerPost.com Offers to Sell Your Soul], Kirkpatrick, M. (2006, June 30).</ref> ==Legal and social consequences== Blogging can result in a range of legal liabilities and other unforeseen consequences. ===Defamation or liability=== Several cases have been brought before the national courts against bloggers concerning issues of [[Slander and libel|defamation or liability]]. U.S. payouts related to blogging totaled $17.4 million by 2009; in some cases these have been covered by [[umbrella insurance]].<ref>McQueen MP. (2009). [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124287328648142113.html Bloggers, Beware: What You Write Can Get You Sued]. WSJ.</ref> The courts have returned with mixed verdicts. [[Internet Service Provider]]s (ISPs), in general, are immune from liability for information that originates with third parties (U.S. [[Communications Decency Act]] and the EU Directive 2000/31/EC). In ''Doe v. Cahill'', the [[Delaware Supreme Court]] held that stringent standards had to
