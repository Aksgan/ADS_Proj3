Henry II allied with German Protestant princes at the [[Treaty of Chambord]] in 1552. Simultaneously, the continuation of his father's [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]] allowed Henry II to push for French conquests towards the [[Rhine]] while a Franco-Ottoman fleet defended southern France.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=4AuJvd2Tyt8C&pg=PA328&dq=Ottoman+Hungary+French+artillery&as_brr=3&ei=QwzXSbOsB5HGzATilfm6DQ&hl=en#PPA328,M1 ''The Cambridge History of Islam'', p.328]</ref> An early offensive into [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] was successful, with Henry capturing the three episcopal cities of [[Metz]], [[Toul]], and [[Verdun]], and securing them by defeating the Hapsburg army at the [[Battle of Renty]] in 1554. However the attempted French invasion of [[Tuscany]] in 1553 was defeated at the [[Battle of Marciano]]. After Charles's abdication in 1556 split the Hapsburg empire between [[Philip II of Spain]] and [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]], the focus of the war shifted to [[Flanders]], where Phillip, in conjunction with [[Emmanuel Philibert]] of [[Savoy]], defeated the French at [[Battle of St. Quentin (1557)|St. Quentin]]. England's entry into the war later that year led to the French capture of [[Calais]], and French armies plundered Spanish possessions in the [[Low Countries]]. Henry was nonetheless forced to accept the [[Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis]], in which he renounced any further claims to Italy. [[File:Cateau-Cambresis.jpg|thumb|The [[Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis]] (1559). Henry II and [[Philip II of Spain]] were in reality absent, and the peace was signed by their ambassadors.]] The [[Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis]] was signed between [[Elizabeth I of England]] and Henry on 2 April and between Henry and [[Philip II of Spain]] on 3 April 1559 at [[Le Cateau-Cambrésis]], around twenty kilometers southeast of [[Cambrai]]. Under its terms, France restored [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]] and [[Savoy]] to the Duke of Savoy, but retained [[Saluzzo]], [[Calais]] and the bishoprics of [[Diocese of Metz|Metz]], [[Diocese of Toul|Toul]], and [[Diocese of Verdun|Verdun]]. Spain retained [[Franche-Comté]]. [[Emmanuel Philibert]], Duke of [[Savoy]], married [[Margaret of France, Duchess of Berry]], the sister of Henry II, and [[Philip II of Spain]] married Henry's daughter [[Elizabeth of Valois|Élisabeth]]. Henry raised the young [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], at his court, hoping to use her to ultimately establish a dynastic claim to Scotland. On 24 April 1558, Henry's fourteen-year-old son Francis was married to Mary in a union intended to give the future king of France not only the throne of Scotland but a claim to the throne of England. Henry had Mary sign secret documents, illegal in Scottish law, that would ensure Valois rule in Scotland even if she died without an heir (Guy 2004:91). Mary's claim to the English throne quickly became an issue when [[Mary I of England]] died later in 1558, Henry and his Catholic advisers regarding [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] unfit to reign because of her illegitimacy. ==Patent innovation== [[File:16th century French cypher machine in the shape of a book with arms of Henri II.jpg|thumb|left|A [[cryptography|cypher machine]] in the shape of a book, with arms of Henri II.]] Henry II introduced the concept of publishing the description of an invention in the form of a [[patent]]. The idea was to require an inventor to disclose his invention in exchange for monopoly rights to the patent. The description is called a patent “specification”. The first patent specification was submitted by the inventor [[Abel Foullon]] for "Usaige & Description de l'holmetre", (a type of [[rangefinder]].) Publication was delayed until after the patent expired in 1561.<ref>M. Frumkin, "The Origin of Patents", Journal of the Patent Office Society, March 1945, Vol. XXVII, No. 3, pp 143 et Seq.</ref> ==Death== [[File:French bastard culverin 1548 with arms of Henri II and Catherine de Medicis and crescent of Diane 85mm 300cm 1076kg.jpg|thumb|"[[Calibres de France|Bastard culverin]]" of 1548, with arms of Henri II and [[Catherine de Medicis]] and crescent of [[Diane de Poitiers]].

On 30 June 1559, at the Place Royale, during a match to celebrate the [[Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis]] with his longtime enemies, the [[Habsburg]]s of [[Austria]], and to celebrate the marriage of his daughter [[Elisabeth of Valois]] to King [[Philip II of Spain]], King Henry was mortally wounded by the lance of [[Gabriel Montgomery]], captain of the King's [[Scottish Guard]]. The lance pierced his eye and, despite the efforts of royal surgeon [[Ambroise Paré]], he died on 10 July 1559 from [[Sepsis|septicemia]].<ref>[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Henry_II_Of_France Classic Encyclopedia Web, Based on 1911 Edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica]</ref> He was buried in a [[cadaver tomb]] in [[Saint Denis Basilica]]. [[File:Tournament between Henry II and Lorges.jpg|thumb|left|The fatal tournament between Henry II and [[Gabriel, comte de Montgomery|Montgomery]] (Lord of "Lorges").]] As Henry lay dying, [[Catherine de' Medici|Queen Catherine]] limited access to his bedside and denied his mistress [[Diane de Poitiers]] access to him, even though he repeatedly asked for her. Following his death, Catherine sent Diane into exile, where she lived in comfort on her own properties until her death. Henry was succeeded by his son, [[Francis II of France|Francis II]], who died the following year and was succeeded by his two brothers. Their mother acted as [[Regent]]. For the forty years following Henry II's death, France was filled with turbulence as Protestants and Catholics fought the bitter [[French Wars of Religion]]. ==Ancestors and Descendants== {{ahnentafel top|width=100%}} {{ahnentafel-compact5 |style=font-size: 90%; line-height: 110%; |border=1 |boxstyle=padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0; |boxstyle_1=background-color: #999; |boxstyle_2=background-color: #bbb; |boxstyle_3=background-color: #ddd; |boxstyle_4=background-color: #eee; | 1 = 1.
