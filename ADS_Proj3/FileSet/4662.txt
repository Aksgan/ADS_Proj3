In certain cases use of copyright protected material can be allowed without a permission from the original right holder. In the US, the notion of [[fair use]] doctrine is used to determine whether the use of copyright protected material is allowed or not. Within this assessment the courts must focus on following list of non-exhaustive factors; 1. The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; 2. The nature of the copyrighted work; 3. The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and 4. The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. In the EU level, the possibility to allow copyright exceptions is tackled by the article 5 of the so-called [[Copyright Directive]], also known as the Information Society Directive. Article 5 of the Copyright Directive stipulates an exhaustive list of optional defenses which are subjected to the classical [[Berne three-step test]]. The list of optional defenses is conditional to members states [[implementation]] but these include use of copyright protected material for private use, education purposes, quotations and parody among others. In general, unauthorized use of copyright protected material in the context of UGC might be allowed if it falls under the fair use doctrine or can be justified according to the list set out in the Copyright Directive. The fundamental difference between the US and the EU system is the more lenient case-by-case assessment practiced by US courts in relation to a more rigid system in the EU level. ==See also== {| | * [[Blog]] * [[Buzzword]] * [[Carr-Benkler wager]] * [[Citizen journalism]] * [[Happy slapping]] * [[Collective intelligence]] * [[Consumer generated marketing]] * [[Communal marketing]] | * [[Customer engagement]] * [[Creative Commons]] * [[Crowdsourcing]] * [[Democracy Player]] * [[Deviantart]] * [[Fan art]] * [[Fan Fiction]] * [[Generation C]] * [[Mod (computer gaming)]] * [[Open source]]/[[Free Software]] | * [[Participatory design]] * [[Networked information economy]] * [[Prosumer]] * [[Reputation system]] * [[Social media]] * [[User innovation]] * [[User-generated TV]] * [[Web 2.0]] * [[YouTube]] |} ==References== {{reflist|2}} ==External links== {{Wikinews2|New web search engine uses only user generated results|User generated search engine "Jatalla" launched}} * [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/57/14/38393115.pdf OECD study on the Participative Web: User Generated Content] * [http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/page/0,,1939196,00.html A Bigger Bang] an overview of the UGC trend on the Web in 2006 * [http://battellemedia.com/archives/003160.php Packaged Goods Media vs. Conversational Media] a comparison of UGC and professional/corporate media {{DEFAULTSORT:User-Generated Content}} [[Category:Citizen media]] [[Category:Collective intelligence]] [[Category:Social network services]] [[Category:Virtual communities]] [[Category:Video game design]] [[de:User Generated Content]] [[fr:Contenu généré par les utilisateurs]] [[ko:손수제작물]] [[it:Contenuto generato dagli utenti]] [[he:תוכן גולשים]] [[nl:User-generated content]] [[ja:Consumer Generated Media]] [[no:Brukergenerert innhold]] [[pl:User-generated content]] [[pt:Conteúdo Gerado pelo Consumidor]] [[ru:User-generated content]] [[sl:Vsebina ki jo ustvarijo uporabniki]] [[sv:Användargenererat innehåll]] [[tr:Kullanıcının geliştirdiği içerik]]</text> </page> <page> <id>39049</id> <title>User Account Control</title> <text>[[File:Windows 7 UAC.png|thumb|310px|User Account Control dialog in [[Windows 7]]]] '''User Account Control''' ('''UAC''') is a technology and security infrastructure introduced with [[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows Server 2008]] [[operating system]]s, with a more relaxed<ref name="winsupersiteuac">[http://www.winsupersite.com/win7/ff_uac.asp Windows 7 Feature Focus: User Account Control], An overview of UAC in Windows 7 by [[Paul Thurott]]</ref> version also present in [[Windows 7]] and [[Windows Server 2008 R2]] . It aims to improve the security of [[Microsoft Windows]] by limiting [[application software]] to standard user privileges until an [[System administrator|administrator]] authorizes an increase or elevation. In this way, only applications trusted by the user may receive administrative privileges, and [[malware]] should be kept from compromising the operating system. In other words, a user account may have administrator privileges assigned to it, but applications that the user runs do not inherit those privileges unless they are approved beforehand or the user explicitly authorizes it. To reduce the possibility of lower-privilege applications communicating with higher-privilege ones, another new technology, [[User Interface Privilege Isolation]] is used in conjunction with User Account Control to isolate these processes from each other.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa905330.aspx | title=The Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 Developer Story: Windows Vista Application Development Requirements for User Account Control (UAC) | month=April | year=2007 | accessdate=2007-10-08 | work=The Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 Developer Story Series | publisher=[[Microsoft]] }}</ref> One prominent use of this is [[Internet Explorer 7]]'s "Protected Mode".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb250462.aspx |title=Understanding and Working in Protected Mode Internet Explorer |month=January | year=2006 |accessdate=2007-12-08 |coauthors=Marc Silbey, Peter Brundrett |publisher=[[Microsoft]] }}</ref> ==History== Differentiation of a [[Superusers|superuser]] and [[Userland (computing)|userland]] has been common in mainframes and servers for decades. This had an obvious security component, but also an administrative component, in that it prevented users from accidentally changing system settings. Microsoft home operating systems (such as [[MS-DOS]], [[Windows 95]], [[Windows 98]] and [[Windows Me]]) did not have a concept of different user accounts on the same machine, and all actions were performed as [[Superuser|super user]]. [[Windows NT]] introduced multiple user accounts, but in practice most users continued to operate as super user administrator for their normal operations. Further, many applications tend to assume that the user is super user, and will simply not work if they are not.<ref name="Channel 9">{{cite web |url=http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=288259 |title=UAC - What.

Introduced in [[Windows Vista]], User Account Control (UAC) is an integrated, more balanced approach to encourage "super-user when necessary". Linux and Unix users will be familiar with this, as UAC's functionality is very similar to the "[[sudo]]" command. The key to UAC lies in its ability to elevate privileges without changing the user context (user "Bob" is still user "Bob"). As always, it is difficult to introduce new security features without breaking compatibility with existing applications. When logging into Vista as a standard user, a logon session is created and a [[Token (Windows NT architecture)|token]] containing only the most basic privileges is assigned. In this way, the new logon session is incapable of making changes that would affect
