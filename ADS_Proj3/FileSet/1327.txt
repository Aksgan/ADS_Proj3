H(s)</math> of a filter is the ratio of the output signal <math>\ Y(s)</math> to that of the input signal <math>\ X(s)</math> as a function of the complex frequency <math>\ s</math>: :<math>\ H(s)=\frac{Y(s)}{X(s)}</math> with <math>\ s = \sigma + j \omega</math>. The transfer function of all linear time-invariant filters, when constructed of discrete components, will be the ratio of two polynomials in <math>\ s</math>, i.e. a [[rational function]] of <math>\ s</math>. The order of the transfer function will be the highest power of <math>\ s</math> encountered in either the numerator or the denominator. == Classification by topology == Electronic filters can be classified by the technology used to implement them. Filters using [[passive filter]] and [[active filter]] technology can be further classified by the particular [[electronic filter topology]] used to implement them. Any given filter transfer function may be implemented in any [[electronic filter topology]]. Some common circuit topologies are: * [[Cauer topology (electronics)|Cauer topology]] - Passive * [[Sallen Key filter|Sallen Key topology]] - Active * [[Multiple feedback topology (electronics)|Multiple Feedback topology]] - Active * [[State variable topology|State Variable Topology]] - Active * [[Biquadratic topology]] [[biquad filter]] - Active ==Classification by design methodology== {{Linear analog electronic filter}} Historically, linear analog filter design has evolved through three major approaches. The oldest designs are simple circuits where the main design criterion was the [[Q factor]] of the circuit. This reflected the radio receiver application of filtering as Q was a measure of the frequency selectivity of a tuning circuit. From the 1920s filters began to be designed from the [[image impedance|image]] point of view, mostly being driven by the requirements of telecommunications. After [[World War II]] the dominant methodology was [[network synthesis filters|network synthesis]]. The higher mathematics used originally required extensive tables of polynomial coefficient values to be published but modern computer resources have made that unnecessary.<ref>Bray, J, ''Innovation and the Communications Revolution'', Institute of Electrical Engineers''</ref> ===Direct circuit analysis=== Low order filters can be designed by directly applying basic circuit laws such as [[Kirchoff's laws]] to obtain the transfer function. This kind of analysis is usually only carried out for simple filters of 1st or 2nd order. [[Image:RL filter response.png|thumb|left|250px|RL filter frequency response]] <br style="clear:left;"/> ===Image impedance analysis=== :{{main|Composite image filters}} This approach analyses the filter sections from the point of view of the filter being in an infinite chain of identical sections. It has the advantages of simplicity of approach and the ability to easily extend to higher orders. It has the disadvantage that accuracy of predicted responses relies on filter terminations in the image impedance, which is usually not the case.<ref name="MYJ">Matthaei, Young, Jones ''Microwave Filters, Impedance-Matching Networks, and Coupling Structures'' McGraw-Hill 1964</ref> [[Image:Constant k order 5.png|thumb|left|250px|Constant k filter response with 5 elements]] [[Image:Zobel 5 sections.png|thumb|none|250px|Zobel network (constant R) filter, 5 sections]] [[Image:m-derived order 1.png|thumb|left|250px|m-derived filter response, m=0.5, 2 elements]] [[Image:m-derived order 5.png|thumb|none|250px|m-derived filter response, m=0.5, 5 elements]] <br style="clear:left;"/> ===Network synthesis=== :{{main|Network synthesis filters}} The network synthesis approach starts with a required transfer function and then expresses that as a polynomial equation of the input impedance of the filter. The actual element values of the filter are obtained by continued-fraction or partial-fraction expansions of this polynomial. Unlike the image method, there is no need for impedance matching networks at the terminations as the effects of the terminating resistors are included in the analysis from the start.<ref name="MYJ"/> Here is an image comparing Butterworth, Chebyshev, and elliptic filters. The filters in this illustration are all fifth-order low-pass filters. The particular implementation &ndash; analog or digital, passive or active &ndash; makes no difference; their output would be the same. [[Image:Electronic linear filters.svg|500px|center]] As is clear from the image, elliptic filters are sharper than all the others, but they show ripples on the whole bandwidth. == See also == {{Commons category|Electronic filters}} {{MultiCol}} *[[Active filter]] *[[ADSL broadband filter]] *[[Analog filter]] *[[Audio crossover]] *[[Audio filter]] *[[Cascaded integrator-comb filter]] *[[Comb filter]] *[[Digital filter]] *[[Distributed element filter]] *[[Composite image filters|Image filters]] *[[Linear filter]] *[[Non-linear filter]] {{ColBreak}} *[[Network synthesis filters]] *[[Nyquist filter]] *[[Passive filter]] *[[Q factor]] *[[Resonance]] *[[RF and microwave filter]] *[[Spurline]] *[[Switched-capacitor filter]] *[[Tone control circuits]] *[[Voltage-controlled filter]] {{EndMultiCol}} ==External links and references== {{reflist}} <div class="references-small"> :*{{cite book|author=Zverev, Anatol, I|year=1969|title=Handbook of Filter Synthesis|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=0-471-98680-1}} Catalog of passive filter types and component values.
