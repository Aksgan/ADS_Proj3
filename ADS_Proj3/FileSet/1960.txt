Mankind has '''[[Construction|constructed]]''' [[building]]s and other structures since [[prehistory]]. The History of Construction is not limited to buildings but covers bridges, amphitheatres, dams, electricity pylons, road and canals to give just a few examples. Today we take the incredible feats of engineering very much for granted but virtually all of the building materials we use today have a long history and some of the structures built thousands of years ago without the aid of modern technology still have the ability to amaze. The history of construction is related to, but not identical with, the history of structural engineering. To understand why things were constructed the way they were, we also need to rely on archaeology to record the form of the parts that survive and the tools they used, economic history to inform us of how much they cost, social history to tell us about how the builders lived, and architectural history to tell us about the books and writings of the builders. It is a huge subject, but one that should interest anyone who wants to know more about how and why the built world around them is the way it is. ==Chronological Development== The history of construction is a complex subject encompassing the history of building materials, the history of engineering, the history of building techniques, economic and social history of builders and workmen, the history of construction machinery and temporary works etc etc. Each of these has a complex literature devoted to it, but it perhaps worth providing the briefest of summaries here in the hope that others will start new more detailed pages. ===Neolithic construction=== [[Image:Skara Brae 12.jpg|thumb|right|'''Neolithic buildings in [[Skara Brae]]''', [[Skara Brae]] is listed as a [[UNESCO]] [[world heritage site]]]] The first [[bridge]]s made by humans were probably wooden logs placed across a stream. The first buildings were simple [[hut (dwelling)|hut]]s, [[tent]]s and shelters meant to suit the basic needs of protection from the elements, built by their inhabitants (see [[self-sufficiency]]). The very simplest shelters, tents, leave no traces behind them. Because of this, what little we can say about very early construction is mostly conjecture and based on what we know about the way nomadic hunter-gatherers and herdsmen in remote areas build shelters today. The absence of metal tools placed limitations on the materials that could be worked, but it was still possible to build quite elaborate stone structures with ingenuity using dry stone walling techniques (see the stone structures at [[Skara Brae]]. The first mud bricks, formed with the hands rather than wooden moulds belong to the late neolithic period and were found in [[Jericho]]. One of the largest structures if this period was the [[Neolithic long house]]. In all cases of timber structures in these very early cultures, only the very lowest parts of the walls and post holes are unearthed in
