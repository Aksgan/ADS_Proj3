According to the exclusion principle, there must be an event that does not supervene on ''e'' while causing ''e*''. To show this better, substitute "''the desire to lift one's arm''" for "''e''", and "''one to lift their arm''" for "''e*''". :If ''the desire to lift one's arm'' causes ''one to lift their arm'', then there is no event such that it is non-supervenient on ''the desire to lift one's arm'' and it causes ''one to lift their arm''. This is interpreted as meaning, mental events supervene upon the physical. However, some philosophers do not accept this principle, and accept [[epiphenomenalism]], which states mental events are caused by physical events, but physical events are not caused by mental events (called ''causal impotence''). However, If ''e#'' does not cause ''e'', then there is no way to verify that ''e*'' exists. Yet, this debate has not been settled in the philosophical community. ==External links== * [http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/chapters/s7971.html Princeton University Press] * [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/physicalism/#15 Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] [[Category:Philosophy of mind]] [[Category:Epistemology]] [[Category:Cognitive science]] {{Philo-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>12771</id> <title>Executable Architecture</title> <text>{{Wiktionary|Executable Architecture}} An '''Executable Architecture''' ('''EA'''), in general, is the description of a [[system architecture]] (including software and/or otherwise) in a [[formal]] [[notation]] together with the tools (e.g. [[compilers]]/[[Translator (computers)|translators]]) that allow the automatic or semi-automatic generation of artifacts (e.g. Capability Gap Analysis (CGA), [[scientific modelling|Models]], software stubs, [[Military Scenario Definition Language]] (MSDL)) from that notation and which are used in the analysis, refinement, and/or the implementation of the architecture described.<ref>Pawlowski, Tom, "Executable Architecture", [[MITRE]], 2004 [http://www.mitre.org/news/events/tech04/briefings/729.pdf]</ref><ref>Garcia, Johnny, "Executable architecture analysis modeling", ISBN 1-56555-314-4, 2007 [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1404840]</ref><ref>Youssef, R., Kim, B., Pagotto, J., Vallerand, A., Lam, S., Pace, P., Pogue, C., Greenley, A., "Toward an Integrated Executable Architecture and M&S Based Analysis for Counter Terrorism and Homeland Security", RTO-MP-MSG-045, NATO OTAN, February 2007 [http://ftp.rta.nato.int/public//PubFullText/RTO/MP/RTO-MP-MSG-045///MP-MSG-045-07.pdf]</ref><ref>Harrison, Gregory A., Hutt, Russell, Kern, Howard S., Saidi, Salaheddine, Young, Christopher A., "Federated executable architecture technology as an enabling technology for simulation of large systems", 2006 [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006SPIE.6227E..13H]</ref> ==Closely Related Subjects== Subjects closely related to '''EA''' include: * [[Object Management Group]]'s [[Model-driven architecture]] * [[Object Management Group]]'s [[Business Process Management Initiative]] * [[Vanderbilt University]]'s Model Integrated Computing (MIC) ==Implementations== Implementations of '''EA''' include: * [[Rational Rose]] * [[Generic Modeling Environment]] (GME) * Open Source eGov Reference Architecture (OSERA) ==See also== * [[Business Process Execution Language]] (BPEL) * [[Business Process Management Initiative]] (BPMI) * [[Business Process Modeling Language]] (BPMN) * [[Operational View#Executable Operational Architecture|Executable Operational Architecture]] * [[Model-driven architecture]] (MDA) * [[Model-driven engineering]] (MDE) * [[Object Management Group]] (OMG) * [[Semantic Web]] * [[Unified Process]] * [[Universal Modeling Language]] (UML) * [[Vanderbilt University]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/research/MIC Model Integrated Computing (MIC) Website] * [https://osera.gov/web/guest/home OSERA's Website] [[Category:Systems engineering]] [[Category:Military acquisition]] [[Category:Modeling and simulation]]</text> </page> <page> <id>12777</id> <title>Executive information system</title> <text>An '''Executive Information System''' (EIS) is a type of [[management information system]] intended to facilitate and support the information and [[decision-making]] needs of senior executives by providing easy access to both internal and external [[information]] relevant to meeting the strategic goals of the [[organization]].
