files in the proprietary format and re-exporting them. Other, generally simpler WYSIWYG editors are designed to work directly with HTML files. Exported files tend to be larger than hand-coded pages (those produced with a text-based HTML editor or a plain text editor). WYSIWYG generators tend to be better than word processors at producing highly graphical and interactive pages. Although the term WYSIWYG is often used for these editors, they are generally not truly WYSIWYG (see [[HTML editor#Difficulties in achieving WYSIWYG|Difficulties in achieving WYSIWYG]]). {{Multicol}} * [[ASP.NET Web Matrix]] * [[Adobe Dreamweaver]] * [[Amaya (web browser)|Amaya]] * [[BestAddress HTML Editor]] * [[BlueGriffon]] * [[CoffeeCup HTML Editor]] * [[FirstPage]] * [[Freeway (software)|Freeway]] * [[Hyper Publish]] * [[iWeb]] {{Multicol-break}} * [[KompoZer]] * [[Microsoft Expression Web]] * [[Microsoft SharePoint Designer]] * [[Microsoft Visual Studio]] * [[Microsoft Visual Studio Express#Visual Web Developer Express|Microsoft Visual Web Developer Express]] * [[Microsoft Publisher]] * [[Macromedia Dreamviewer]] * [[NetObjects Fusion]] * [[OpenBEXI]] * [[Opera Dragonfly]] {{Multicol-break}} * [[Quanta Plus]] * [[RapidWeaver]] * [[Sandvox]] * [[SeaMonkey|SeaMonkey Composer]] * [[SiteGrinder]] * [[tkWWW]] * [[WebPlus]] * [[WordPress]] <!-- There is a [[Wordpress.com]] article --> * [[WorldWideWeb]] {{Multicol-end}} == WYSIWYM editors == [[WYSIWYM]] (what you see is what you mean) is an alternative paradigm to WYSIWYG, in which the focus is on the semantic structure of the document rather than on the presentation. These editors produce more logically structured markup than is typical of WYSIWYG editors, while retaining the advantage in ease of use over hand-coding using a text editor. * [[WYMeditor]] ==Discontinued editors== Editors that have been discontinued, but may be in common use * [[Adobe GoLive]] – ''Now discontinued.
