At the center of the [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] is a [[lighthouse]] with a rising sun, surrounded by seven stars and an abbreviation for [[Wisconsin]], ''WIS.'' The middle area displays (beginning at top, clockwise) a railroad locomotive, a church, a [[steamboat]], and a factory. The words ''CITY OF MILWAUKEE'' are at the top of the outer circle, and ''INCORPORATED JAN. 31 1846'' are at the bottom. ==See also== * [[History of Milwaukee]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Seal Of Milwaukee, Wisconsin}} [[Category:Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] [[Category:Seals (insignia)|Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Seal of]] [[Category:Symbols of Wisconsin]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33494</id> <title>Seal of New York City</title> <text>[[File:Seal of the City of New York.svg|200px|right]] The '''seal of the [[New York City|city of New York]]''', adopted in an earlier form in 1686, bears the legend <small>SIGILLUM CIVITATIS NOVI EBORACI</small> which means simply "The Seal of the City of New York": ''[[Eboracum]]'' was the Roman name for York, the [[Titular ruler|titular]] [[Seat (legal entity)|seat]] of [[James II of England|James II as Duke of York]].

The shield and supporters rest upon a horizontal [[Bay Laurel|laurel]] branch. The [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] over the seal is the [[Bald Eagle]], added in 1784, after the [[American Revolution]]. Prior to this change, a crown had been located in this space, representing the authority of the monarchy during the British colonial period. The eagle rests upon a hemisphere. At the bottom is the date, 1625, ostensibly as the founding of [[New Amsterdam]], the colonial Dutch settlement which would later become the City of New York. This date, however, was chosen for somewhat unknown reasons and most historians believe no significant event actually occurred that year. The first Dutch settlers actually arrived in the region in 1624, and the town of New Amsterdam was incorporated in 1653.<ref>{{cite news |title=New York's Birth Date: Don't Go by City's Seal |first=Sam |last=Roberts |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/14/nyregion/14seal.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 14, 2008 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> A [[laurel wreath]] encircles the seal.

The [[gold]] rope which borders the seal represents the county's bond to the sea and its geographic location between the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. The four panels represent the county's economy (in [[agriculture]] and [[fish]]eries), life-style (coastal) and the community's relationship with the environment (depicted by the [[crab]]s, fish and [[geese]]). The three dates in the inner circle represent: *The first recorded [[England|English]] landing in 1603 by [[Bartholomew Gilbert]]. *The first permanent English settlement in 1620. *Recognition as an original shire of the colony governed by England in 1634. The black stems separating the gold band signifies points of the [[compass]] and the county's nautical history. The blue field surrounding the map represents clear skies and calm seas. The gold band depicts the county as a "unique area; precious and rare." Northampton County, shown in white, represents sunlight and a desire to do well. {{DEFAULTSORT:Seal Of Northampton County, Virginia}} [[Category:Northampton County, Virginia]] [[Category:Seals (insignia)|Northampton County, Virginia]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33497</id> <title>Seal of Portland, Oregon</title> <text>[[File:Seal of Portland OR.png|right|200px|Seal of the City of Portland, Oregon]] The '''city [[Seal (device)|seal]] of [[Portland, Oregon]]''' was originally adopted in 1878, standardized in 1964, and most recently revised August 3, 2005. According to the city's website, "The female figure in the center of the seal represents Commerce, while the sheaf of grain, cogwheel, and sledgehammer symbolize the origins of the city, its culture, agrarian base, and industry." The seal's symbolism was discussed upon its adoption by the ''Morning Oregonian'' of March 22, 1878 (page 3): "SEAL OF THE CITY.--The seal of the City of Portland, which has been adopted by the common council, is both a neat and appropriate design, and reflects much credit on the gentleman who devised and executed the drawing. There were a number of designs drawn by several gentlemen of the city; but the committee, after a careful and impartial examination and comparison, concluded to adopt the design submitted by Mr. C. A. Bjourkman. The drawing, of which the seal is to be an exact counterpart, will be 2½ inches in diameter. Around, near
