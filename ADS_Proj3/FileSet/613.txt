</page> <page> <id>5613</id> <title>Catalysis software design method</title> <text>{{advert|date=September 2008}} {{refimprove|date=September 2008}} '''Catalysis''' is a method for the specification and design of component-based computer systems originally developed by Desmond D’Souza and Alan Cameron Wills in their 1999 book<ref>''Objects, Components and Frameworks with UML: The Catalysis Approach'', D’Souza, D.F. and Wills, A.C., Reading MA: Addison-Wesley, 1999 ISBN 0-201-31012-0</ref>. It shows how to make precise abstractions, and emphasizes the formal specification of use cases using pre- and postconditions and ‘guarantees’ clauses. It also places stress on the specification of collaboration protocols so that kits of components can interact in a coherent ‘pluggable’ fashion. This removes much of the need to build translation or ‘mapping’ code. Catalysis therefore enhances the [[Unified Modelling Language]] (UML) with a definite method, showing how the various UML diagrams relate to each other and offering many design heuristics and process and [[design pattern]]s. Catalysis builds on the [[Syntropy]] method and key ideas from both influenced the development of [[UML 2.0]]. More recently, building on the work of D’Souza, Wills and that of John Cheesman and John Daniels<ref>''UML Components'', Cheesman, J. and Daniels, J., Harlow, England: Addison-Wesley, 2000 ISBN 0-201-70851-5</ref>, Derek Andrews of consultancy Trireme International has developed Catalysis II, which extends Catalysis to address the key issues of [[Service Oriented Architecture]] (SOA). Also building on the same foundation, Ian Graham developed Catalysis Conversation Analysis<ref>''Requirements Modelling and Specification for Service Oriented Architecture'', Graham, I., Chichester: Wiley, 2008, ISBN 978-0-470-77563-9</ref>, a method of business process modelling with its roots in [[Semiotics]] and the idea of a [[use case]] (''cf''. Graham, 2008). ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.trireme.com Trireme International] for more details on Catalysis and Catalysis II. {{DEFAULTSORT:Catalysis Software Design Method}} [[Category:Computer programming]]</text> </page> <page> <id>5614</id> <title>Catan</title> <text>{{two other uses||the board game|The Settlers of Catan|the Scottish saint|Saint Cathan}} {{Mergefrom|Catan (PS3)|date=June 2009}} {{Infobox VG |width= |title= Catan |image= [[Image:Catanlogo.jpg]] |caption= The [[Xbox Live Arcade]] cover |developer= [[Big Huge Games]] |publisher= [[Big Huge Games]] |distributor= |designer= |series= |engine= Big Huge Engine |version= |released= May 2, 2007 |genre= [[Turn-based strategy]] |modes= [[Single player]], [[multiplayer game|Multiplayer]] (via [[Xbox Live]]) |ratings= [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]]: Everyone (E) |platforms= [[Xbox 360]] ([[Xbox Live Arcade|XBLA]]) |media= Download |requirements= |input= [[Gamepad#Xbox_360|Gamepad]] }} '''''Catan''''' is the [[Xbox Live Arcade]] version of [[Klaus Teuber|Klaus Teuber's]] ''[[The Settlers of Catan]]'', developed by [[Big Huge Games]] in collaboration with Teuber. It was released on May 2, 2007 for 800 [[Microsoft Points]] ([[US$]]10). It is the first [[German-style board game]] to be released on Xbox Live Arcade, which was followed by ''[[Carcassonne (video game)|Carcassonne]]''. == Development == During an interview with Big Huge Games founder [[Brian Reynolds]], it was revealed that [[Microsoft]] approached Big Huge Games with the idea for the project.<ref name=joystiq>{{cite web | url=http://www.joystiq.com/2007/02/22/off-the-grid-interviews-brian-reynolds-of-big-huge-games/ | title=Off the Grid interviews Brian Reynolds of Big Huge Games | last=Siegel | first=Scott Jon | publisher=Joystiq.com | date=2007-02-22 | accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref> As part of the same interview, Klaus Teuber's collaboration on the project was explained, noting that he was instrumental in helping Reynolds create the AI, using notes and statistics he had generated years ago but had never previously been able to apply. Reynolds later stated, regarding the board game, "The design is so elegant you can teach someone to play in minutes and then spend years trying to master it. With our expertise in interface design and artificial intelligence, it seemed like a natural fit for the project!".<ref name=catanlive>{{cite web | url=http://catanlive.com/ | title=Catan - Big Huge Games | publisher=Big Huge Games | accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref> Teuber has fully endorsed the Big Huge Games version, claiming that the game has exceeded his expectations and noting that he himself has lost several games in a row to the AI.<ref name="catanlive" /> The rules of the computerized version are faithful to the original, with one exception suggested by Teuber himself; the number of resource cards held by players is not limited to the number of resource cards which came with the board game. This was the original design intent, but one which couldn't be implemented due to the necessity to include only a finite number of physical cards in game boxes.<ref name=igninterview>{{cite web | url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/784/784819p1.html | title=IGN: Big Huge Games Talks Catan | last=Brudvig | first=Erik | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=2007-05-01 | accessdate=2007-05-04}}</ref> == Features == [[Image:Catan360.jpg|right|thumb|Typical gameplay screenshot.]] As with the traditional [[board game]], ''Catan'' uses a game board composed of 19 randomly arranged hexagonal tiles, each representing a different type of terrain or resource. Through strategy, luck, and skillful negotiation, 3 or 4 players vie to be the first to earn 10 victory points. This is done through building and enlarging settlements, by establishing the largest army, by building the longest road, or through the use of certain ''development cards''. ''Catan'' claims to have the best ''Settlers of Catan'' [[artificial intelligence]] to date, featuring thirteen unique AI personalities for single player play and multiplayer games with fewer than four humans.<ref name="catanlive" /> Each AI personality, portrayed by a likeness of a famous leader or general (e.g. [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Alexander the Great]], [[Cleopatra]], etc.), has attributes such as their preferred strategy for winning, how quickly they like to expand, and their favorite resource.<ref name="joystiq" /> Three difficulty levels (easy, medium, and hard) control the level of expertise displayed by these opponents. The game features two different "skins" for the game board. The first is a traditional flat view of the board, while the second is a "living world", showing the board as a 3D environment. The board can be rotated during gameplay to provide the desired view, and users can also tweak other visual options such as player colors (for those who are [[Color blindness|color blind]]). As is typical of Xbox Live Arcade games, the game features online play and leaderboards. Separate leaderboards are used to display single player and multiplayer rankings. Unlike many games which keep the [[Xbox Live#TrueSkill|TrueSkill]] level of the players hidden, ''Catan'' displays the calculated current values on one of the leaderboards. Gameplay is turn-based, but turn timers are used to prevent individual players from halting
