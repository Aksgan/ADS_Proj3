There are only [[#The_tight_binding_matrix_elements|three kinds of elements]] that play a significant role in the theory. Two of those three kinds of elements should be close to zero and can often be neglected. The most important elements in the model are the inter atomic matrix elements, which would simply be called the '''[[Bond energy|bond energies]]''' by a chemist. In general there is a number of [[Energy level|atomic energy levels]] and atomic orbitals involved in the model. This can lead to complicated band structures because the orbitals belong to different [[Point groups in three dimensions|point group]] representations. The [[reciprocal lattice]] and the [[Brillouin zone]] often belong to a different [[space group]] than the [[Crystal structure|crystal]] of the solid. High symmetry points in the Brillouin zone belong to different point group representations. When simple systems are studied, like the lattices of elements or simple compounds, it is often not very difficult to calculate eigenstates in high symmetry points analytically. So the tight binding model can provide nice examples for those who want to learn more about [[group theory]]. What is known as the '''"tight binding model"''' has a long history and has been applied in many ways and with many different purposes and different outcomes. The model doesn't stand on its own. Parts of the model can be filled in or extended by other kinds of calculations and models like the [[nearly-free electron model]]. The model itself, or parts of it, can serve as the basis for other calculations<ref name=Harrison> {{cite book |author=Walter Ashley Harrison |title=Electronic Structure and the Properties of Solids |year= 1989 |publisher=Dover Publications |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=R2VqQgAACAAJ |isbn=0-486-66021-4 }} </ref>. In the study of [[Conductive polymer|conductive polymers]], [[Organic semiconductor|organic semiconductors]] and [[molecular electronics]] for example, tight binding like models are applied in which the role of the atoms in the original concept is replaced by the [[Molecular orbital|molecular orbitals]] of [[Conjugated system|conjugated systems]] and where the inter atomic matrix elements are replaced by inter or intra molecular hopping and [[Quantum tunneling|tunneling]] parameters. These conductors nearly all have very anisotropic properties and sometimes are almost perfectly one-dimensional. ==Historical background== By 1928, the idea of a molecular orbital had been advanced by [[Robert_S._Mulliken|Robert Mulliken]], who was influenced considerably by the work of [[Friedrich Hund]]. The LCAO method for approximating molecular orbitals was introduced in 1928 by B. N. Finklestein and G. E. Horowitz, while the LCAO method for solids was developed by [[Felix Bloch]], as part of his doctoral dissertation in 1928, concurrently with and independent of the LCAO-MO approach. A much simpler interpolation scheme for approximating the electronic band structure, especially for the d-bands of [[Transition metal|transition metals]], is the parameterized tight-binding method conceived in 1954 by [[John_C._Slater|John Clarke Slater]] and George Fred Koster<ref name=SlaterKoster></ref>, ''the absolute climax in the history of this model''. Hence, it is sometimes referred to as the [[#Table_of_inter_atomic_matrix_elements|SK tight-binding method]]. With the SK tight-binding method, electronic band structure calculations on a solid need not be carried out with full rigor as in the original [[Bloch's theorem]] but, rather, first-principles calculations are carried out only at high-symmetry points and the band structure is interpolated over the remainder of the [[Brillouin zone]] between these points. In this approach, interactions between different atomic sites are considered as [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation]]s. There exists several kinds of interactions we must consider. The crystal [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] is only approximately a sum of atomic Hamiltonians located at different sites and atomic wave functions overlap adjacent atomic sites in the crystal, and so are not accurate representations of the exact wave function. There are further explanations in the next section with some mathematical expressions. Recently, in the research about [[strongly correlated material]], the tight binding approach is basic approximation because highly localized electrons like 3-d [[transition metal]] electrons sometimes indicate strongly correlated behaviors. In this case, the role of electron-electron interaction must be considered using the [[Many-body theory|many-body physics]] description. The tight-binding model is typically used for calculations of [[electronic band structure]] and [[band gap]]s in the static regime. However, in combination with other methods such as the [[random phase approximation]] (RPA) model, the dynamic response of systems may also be studied. ==Mathematical formulation== We introduce the [[atomic orbital]]s <math>\varphi_m( \boldsymbol{r} )</math>, which are [[eigenfunction]]s of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] ''H''<sub>at</sub> of a single isolated atom. When the atom is placed in a crystal, this atomic wave function overlaps adjacent atomic sites, and so are not true eigenfunctions of the crystal Hamiltonian. The overlap is less when electrons are tightly bound, which is the source of the descriptor "tight-binding". Any corrections to the atomic potential Δ''U'' required to obtain the true Hamiltonian ''H'' of the system, are assumed small: :<math>H (\boldsymbol{r}) = \sum_{\boldsymbol{R_n}} H_{\mathrm{at}}(\boldsymbol{r - R_n}) +\Delta U (\boldsymbol{r}) \ . </math> A solution ψ('''''r''''') to the time-independent single electron [[Schrödinger equation]] is then approximated as a [[Linear combination of atomic orbitals molecular orbital method|linear combination of atomic orbitals]] <math>\varphi_m( \boldsymbol{r- R_n})</math>: :<math>\psi(\boldsymbol{r}) = \sum_{m,\boldsymbol{R_n}} b_m ( \boldsymbol{R_n}) \ \varphi_m (\boldsymbol{r-R_n})</math>, where ''m'' refers to the ''m-th'' atomic energy level and '''''R<sub>n</sub>''''' locates an atomic site in the [[Crystal structure|crystal lattice]]. ===Translational symmetry and normalization=== The [[translational symmetry]] of the crystal implies the wave function under translation can change only by a phase factor: :<math>\psi(\boldsymbol{r+R_{\ell}}) = e^{i\boldsymbol{k \cdot R_{\ell}}}\psi(\boldsymbol{r}) \ , </math> where '''''k''''' is the [[wave vector]] of the wave function. Consequently, the coefficients satisfy :<math>\sum_{m,\boldsymbol{R_n}} b_m ( \boldsymbol{R_n}) \ \varphi_m (\boldsymbol{r-R_n+R_{\ell}})=e^{i\boldsymbol{k \cdot R_{\ell}}}\sum_{m,\boldsymbol{R_n}} b_m ( \boldsymbol{R_n}) \ \varphi_m (\boldsymbol{r-R_n})\ .</math> By substituting '''''R'''''<sub>p</sub> = '''''R'''''<sub>n</sub> − '''''R'''''<sub>ℓ</sub>, we find :<math>b_m ( \boldsymbol{R_p+R_{\ell}}) = e^{i\boldsymbol{k \cdot R_{\ell}}}b_m ( \boldsymbol{R_p}) \ , </math> or :<math> b_m (\boldsymbol{R_p}) = e^{i\boldsymbol{k \cdot R_{p}}} b_m ( \boldsymbol{0}) \ . </math> [[Normalizable wave function|Normalizing]] the wave function to unity: :<math> \int d^3 r \ \psi^*
