landline in this context are security and [[survivability]]. For example, a military headquarters might be linked to front-line units "by landline" to ensure that communication remains possible even if the conventional telephone network is damaged or destroyed. This was the case in the [[Second World War]], in which the [[RAF Fighter Command]] had its radar stations and aerodromes connected to headquarters by land lines; its more mobile opponent, the German [[Luftwaffe]], used radio - and so its commands were intercepted and deciphered by the British (see [[Ultra]]). Some telecommunications experts have at times seen the more popular use as a misuse of the word. As a consequence, in professional contexts the terms "fixed line" or "wireline" are more commonly used than "landline." "Landline Check" refers to calling a landline and checking to see if there is connectivity, to make sure emergency landline phones are working. ==See also== {{Wiktionary}} *[[Plain old telephone service]] (POTS) *[[Local loop]] *[[Last mile]] *[[Telephone]] ==References== {{Reflist}} [[Category:Telephony]] [[Category:Local loop]] [[ar:هاتف ثابت]] [[da:Fastnet]] [[de:Festnetz]] [[eo:Fiksa telefono]] [[id:Jaringan tetap]] [[hu:Vezetékes telefon]] [[ja:固定電話]] [[no:Fasttelefoni]] [[pl:Telefon stacjonarny]] [[pt:Telefone fixo]] [[sk:Pevná linka]] [[so:Taleefoonada fiilada]] [[zh:固网电信]]</text> </page> <page> <id>21115</id> <title>Landmark point</title> <text>In [[morphometrics]], '''landmark point''' or shortly '''landmark''' is a point in a [[shape]] object in which correspondences between and within the populations of the object are preserved. In other disciplines, landmarks may be known as [[vertex|vertices]], [[anchor]] points, control points, sites, profile points, 'sampling' points, nodes, markers, [[Fiduciary marker|fiducial markers]], etc. Landmarks can be defined either manually by experts or automatically by a [[computer program]]. There are three basic types of landmarks: anatomical landmarks, mathematical landmarks or pseudo-landmarks. An anatomical landmark is a [[biology|biologically]]-meaningful point in an [[organism]]. Usually experts define anatomical points to ensure their correspondences within the same [[species]]. Examples of anatomical landmark in shape of a [[human skull|skull]] are the eye corner, tip of the nose, jaw, etc. Anatomical landmarks determine [[homology (biology)|homologous]] parts of an organism, which share a common ancestry. Mathematical landmarks are points in a shape that are located according to some mathematical or geometrical property, for instance, a high [[curvature]] point or an [[extreme point]]. A computer program usually determines mathematical landmarks used for an automatic [[pattern recognition]]. Pseudo-landmarks are constructed points located between anatomical or mathematical landmarks. A typical example is an equally-spaced set of points between two anatomical landmarks to get more sample points from a shape. Pseudo-landmarks are useful during shape matching, when the matching process requires a large number of points. == See also == * [[Statistical shape analysis]] * [[Fiduciary marker]] == References == * {{cite book|author=I.L.

It is situated just north of the [[A4 road (England)|A4]] next to Kedermister Park. Cycle route 61 passes north-south next to the west side of the school. Langley Grammar School selects its incoming students on the basis of examined ability, at age 11 by [[NFER]] 11+ examination or for Sixth Form by performance at [[GCSE]] and interview. Mr John Constable is the current headteacher of the school. Around 70% of pupils come from outside of the LEA, with a lot from [[London Borough of Hillingdon|Hillingdon]]. ==History== It was founded in 1956. In the early 1980s, there were plans to close the school to reduce Slough's grammar schools from 5 to 4. In the end, two single-sex grammar schools merged instead to form Upton Grammar School (now [[Slough Grammar School]]). ==Facilities== Langley Grammar School has recently sold tracts of land at the end of the former school field to fund building and restoration works comprising of, amongst others, a new teaching block of six classrooms, a sports hall, fitness suite, multi-purpose area, and astro-turf pitch. On September 11 2006, the new Sports Hall was officially opened by the mayor of Slough. A new sixth form centre is currently being built and is due for completion in August 2007, which was opened on 28 September 2007 by Princess Anne. ==Notable alumni== * [[Daniel Johnson (journalist)]], editor of ''[[Standpoint (magazine)|Standpoint]]'', and son of [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] * [[Luke Johnson (businessman)|Luke Johnson]], and brother of Daniel, and Chairman of [[Channel 4]] * [[Susannah Simons]] Broadcaster and BBC Executive ==External links== * [http://www.langley-grammar.slough.sch.uk Official website] * [http://www.langley-grammar.slough.sch.uk/Ofsted_report/Ofsted%20report.pdf Langley Grammar School Ofsted report] * [http://www.edubase.gov.uk/establishment/summary.xhtml?urn=110101 EduBase] ===News items=== * [http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2004/jul/22/uk.schools1 ''Guardian'' July 2004] {{Schools in Berkshire}} [[Category:Grammar schools in Berkshire]] [[Category:Schools in Slough]] [[Category:Educational institutions established in 1956]] [[Category:Mathematics and Computing Colleges in England]]</text> </page> <page> <id>21131</id> <title>Language Acquisition Device (computer)</title> <text>The '''Language Acquisition Device''' is a computer program developed by Lobal Technologies, a computer company in the [[United Kingdom]], and scientists from [[King's College]]{{dn}}.
