subscript ''i'' is the satellite number and has the value 1, 2, 3, or 4. Knowing the indicated time the message was received <math>\scriptstyle\ tr</math>, the GPS receiver can compute the transit time of the message as <math>\scriptstyle\left (tr-t_i\right ) </math>. Assuming the message traveled at the speed of light, [[speed of light|''c'']], the distance traveled or pseudorange, <math>\scriptstyle p_i</math> can be computed as <math>\scriptstyle\left (tr-t_i\right )c</math>. A satellite's position and pseudorange define a sphere, centered on the satellite with radius equal to the pseudorange. The position of the receiver is somewhere on the surface of this sphere. Thus with four satellites, the indicated position of the GPS receiver is at or near the intersection of the surfaces of four spheres. In the ideal case of no errors, the GPS receiver would be at a precise intersection of the four surfaces. If the surfaces of two spheres intersect at more than one point, they intersect in a circle. The article [[trilateration]] shows this mathematically. A figure, ''Two Sphere Surfaces Intersecting in a Circle'', is shown below. Two points where the surfaces of the spheres intersect are clearly shown in the figure. The distance between these two points is the diameter of the circle of intersection. [[Image:Lat 2spheres 2.svg|thumb|left|Two sphere surfaces intersecting in a circle]] The intersection of a third spherical surface with the first two will be its intersection with that circle; in most cases of practical interest, this means they intersect at two points.<ref>It is also possible for a circle and a spherical surface to intersect at zero points, one point, or in the very special case where the centers of the three spheres are co-linear (i.e., all three on the same straight line) the sphere surface could intersect the entire circumference of the circle.</ref> Another figure, ''Surface of Sphere Intersecting a Circle (not a solid disk) at Two Points'', illustrates the intersection. The two intersections are marked with dots. Again the article [[trilateration]] clearly shows this mathematically. [[Image:Circle sphere 2-colour.svg|thumb |right|Surface of sphere Intersecting a circle (not a solid disk) at two points]] For automobiles and other near-earth vehicles, the correct position of the GPS receiver is the intersection closest to the Earth's surface.<ref> The two intersections are symmetrical about the plane containing the three satellites. Excluding the exceptional case when the three satellites are all in a plane containing the center of the earth, one intersection will be nearer the earth than the other. </ref> For space vehicles, the intersection farthest from Earth may be the correct one. The correct position for the GPS receiver is also the intersection closest to the surface of the sphere corresponding to the fourth satellite. === Correcting a GPS receiver's clock === One of the most significant error sources is the GPS receiver's clock. Because of the very large value of the [[speed of light]], ''c'', the estimated distances from the GPS receiver to the satellites, the [[pseudorange]]s, are very sensitive to errors in the GPS receiver clock; for example an error of one microsecond (0.000 001 second) corresponds to an error of {{convert|300|m|ft}}. This suggests that an extremely accurate and expensive clock is required for the GPS receiver to work. Because manufacturers prefer to build inexpensive GPS receivers for mass markets, the solution for this dilemma is based on the way sphere surfaces intersect in the GPS problem. [[Image:Sphere clock cor.svg|thumb|Diagram depicting satellite 4, sphere, p4, r4, and da]] It is likely that the surfaces of the three spheres intersect, because the circle of intersection of the first two spheres is normally quite large, and thus the third sphere surface is likely to intersect this large circle. It is very unlikely that the surface of the sphere corresponding to the fourth satellite will intersect either of the two points of intersection of the first three, because any clock error could cause it to miss intersecting a point. However, the distance from the valid estimate of GPS receiver position to the surface of the sphere corresponding to the fourth satellite can be used to compute a clock correction. Let <math>\scriptstyle r_4</math> denote the distance from the valid estimate of GPS receiver position to the fourth satellite and let <math>\scriptstyle p_4</math> denote the pseudorange of the fourth satellite. Let <math>\scriptstyle da \,=\, r_4 \,-\, p_4</math>. <math>\scriptstyle da</math> is the distance from the computed GPS receiver position to the surface of the sphere corresponding to the fourth satellite. Thus the quotient, <math>\scriptstyle b \,=\, da / c\ </math>, provides an estimate of :(correct time) âˆ’ (time indicated by the receiver's on-board clock), and the GPS receiver clock can be advanced if <math>\scriptstyle b</math> is positive or delayed if <math>\scriptstyle b</math> is negative. However, it should be kept in mind that a less simple function of <math>\scriptstyle da</math> may be needed to estimate the time error in an iterative algorithm as discussed in the [[Global Positioning System#Navigation equations|Navigation equations]] section. == Structure == The current GPS consists of three major segments. These are the space segment (SS), a control segment (CS), and a user segment (US).<ref>{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/systems/gps_3-ocx.htm |title=GPS III Operational Control Segment (OCX) |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2009-12-08}}</ref> The [[U.S. Air Force]] develops, maintains, and operates the space and control segments. GPS satellites [[broadcast signal]]s from space, and each GPS receiver uses these signals to calculate its three-dimensional location (latitude, longitude, and altitude) and the current time.<ref name=gps.gov>{{cite web|url=http://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/index.html |title=Global Positioning System |publisher=Gps.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}</ref> The space segment is composed of 24 to 32 satellites in [[medium Earth orbit]] and also includes the payload adapters to the boosters required to launch them into orbit. The control segment is composed of a master control station, an alternate master control station, and a host of dedicated and shared [[ground antenna]]s and monitor stations. The user segment is composed of hundreds of thousands of U.S. and allied military users of the secure GPS Precise Positioning Service, and tens of millions of civil, commercial, and scientific users of the Standard Positioning Service (see [[GPS navigation device]]s). === Space
