to trade back foreign spies with non-official cover would result in consequences in bilateral relations of the gravest possible magnitude, being an extraordinarily hostile act, even if those consequences were unofficially and extrajudicially imposed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} ==Value== According to the [[Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction]] report submitted in March 2005, OSINT must be included in the all-source intelligence process for the following reasons (as stated in the report): #The ever-shifting nature of our intelligence needs compels the IC to quickly and easily understand a wide range of foreign countries and cultures. - … today’s threats are rapidly changing and geographically diffuse; it is a fact of life that an intelligence analyst may be forced to shift rapidly from one topic to the next. Increasingly, IC professionals need to quickly assimilate social, economic, and cultural information about a country—information often detailed in open sources. #Open source information provides a base for understanding classified materials. Despite large quantities of classified material produced by the IC, the amount of classified information produced on any one topic can be quite limited, and may be taken out of context if viewed only from a classified-source perspective. Perhaps the most important example today relates to terrorism, where open source information can fill gaps and create links that allow analysts to better understand fragmented intelligence, rumored terrorist plans, possible means of attack, and potential targets. #Open source materials can protect sources and methods. Sometimes an intelligence judgment that is actually informed with sensitive, classified information can be defended on the basis of open source reporting. This can prove useful when policymakers need to explain policy decisions or communicate with foreign officials without compromising classified sources. #Only open source can ''store history.'' A robust open source program can, in effect, gather data to monitor the world’s cultures and how they change with time. This is difficult, if not impossible, using the ''snapshots'' provided by classified collection methods.<ref>(The Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities, 378-379). [[Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction]]</ref> ==Process== Information collection in OSINT is generally a different problem from collection in other intelligence disciplines where obtaining the raw information to be analyzed may be the major difficulty, particularly if it is to be obtained from non-cooperative targets. In OSINT, the chief difficulty is in identifying relevant, reliable sources from the vast amount of publicly available information. However, this is not as great a challenge for those who know how to access local knowledge and how to leverage human experts who can create new tailored knowledge on the fly. ==History== The [[Foreign Broadcast Information Service]] (FBIS) was created in 1941 to access and exploit OSINT in relation to World War II. A classic example of their value and success is reflected in the price of oranges in Paris as an indicator of whether railroad bridges had been bombed successfully. The recent history of OSINT began in 1988 when General [[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.]], Commandant of the Marine Corps, called for a redirection of US intelligence away from the collapsing Soviet Union and toward non-state actors and Third World zones of instability. Additionally, he pointed out that most of the intelligence which needs to be known could be obtained via OSINT, and recommended a substantive increase in resources for this aspect of the intelligence collection spectrum of sources.<ref>General Alfred M. Gray, "Global Intelligence Challenges in the 1990's", [[American Intelligence Journal]] (Winter 1989-1990)</ref> In the fall of 1992, Senator [[David Boren]], then Chairman of the [[Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]], sponsored the National Security Act of 1992, attempting to achieve modest reform in the U.S. Intelligence Community. His counterpart on the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] was Congressman [[Dave McCurdy]]. The House version of the legislation included a separate Open Source Office, at the suggestion of Larry Prior, a Marine Reservist familiar with the [[Marine Corps Intelligence Command|MCIC]] experience and then serving on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence staff. The [[Aspin-Brown Commission]] stated in 1996 that US access to open sources was "severely deficient" and that this should be a "top priority" for both funding and DCI attention. In issuing its July 2004 report, the [[9/11 Commission]] recommended the creation of an open-source intelligence agency, but without further detail or comment.<ref>See page 413 of the [http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_FM.pdf 9-11 Commission Report (pdf)].</ref> Subsequently, the [[Iraq Intelligence Commission|WMD Commission]] (also known as the Robb-Silberman Commission) report in March 2005 recommended the creation of an Open Source Directorate at the CIA. Following these recommendations, in November 2005 the [[United States Director of National Intelligence|Director of National Intelligence]] announced the creation of the DNI [[Open Source Center]]. The Center was established to collect information available from "the Internet, databases, press, radio, television, video, geospatial data, photos and commercial imagery."<ref>Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

Press release, 8 November 2005.</ref> In addition to collecting openly available information, it would train analysts to make better use of this information. The Center absorbed the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s previously existing [[Foreign Broadcast Information Service]] (FBIS), originally established in 1941, with FBIS head [[Douglas Naquin]] named as director of the Center.<ref>Ensor, David.
