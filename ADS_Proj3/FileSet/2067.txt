Internet banks in the Korea need these programs by law, so users using [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]], or other browsers or operating systems besides [[Internet Explorer]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] can not access these online banks.<ref>Simply go to Internet banking page of the Post office of Korea, http://www.epostbank.go.kr/?dp_id=D_001 Using MSIE, you can see many Security Alerts. Using other browsers, you will be unable to proceed. That page means 'If you see alert message, '''must allow all'''(Message for only MSIE).</ref> Most of the functions run at kernel level of an [[OS]], so versions of Windows that use [[UAC]] or User Account Control ([[Windows Vista]], [[Windows 7]]) are unable to run smoothly. Some input devices especially [[USB]] [[Keyboard (computing)|Keyboard]] are unable to function in conjunction with nProtect. nProtect Netizen, nProtect Personal and nProtect Keycrypt are programs used mostly for internet banking in Korea. They are programmed to terminate processes that are not associated with banking, but processes are terminated indiscriminately if they are deemed a threat and thus may compromise a system's stability. These programs also inject themselves into all existing processes from startup, and sometimes collide with other anti-viruses. More problematically, Korean banks do not update their program every time INCA releases an update. == See also == *[[nProtect GameGuard]] *[[Anti-virus|Anti-Virus Software]] == Notes and references == {{Reflist}} ==External links== *[http://gameguard.nprotect.com nProtect GameGuard Online Scanner website] *[http://eng.nprotect.com/nprotect_gameguard.htm nProtect GameGuard official website] *[http://www.inca.co.kr/ INCA Internet official website] *[http://www.gameguard.co.kr/gameguard/faq/eng/index.htm nProtect GameGuard FAQ] {{DEFAULTSORT:Inca Internet}} [[Category:Computer security software companies]] [[Category:Antivirus software]] [[Category:Software companies of South Korea]] [[Category:Companies established in 2000]] [[ko:잉카인터넷]] [[ja:NProtect]] [[ro:INCA Internet]] [[zh:INCA Internet]]</text> </page> <page> <id>17582</id> <title>INDICARE</title> <text>== Goal == The overall goal of INDICARE (The '''IN'''formed '''DI'''alogue about '''C'''onsumer '''A'''cceptability of [[Digital Rights Management|DRM]] Solutions in '''E'''urope) was to raise awareness, help to reconcile heterogeneous interests of multiple [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]], and to support the emergence of a common European position with regard to consumer and user issues of [[Digital Rights Management]] (DRM) solutions. == The eContent Programme == INDICARE responded to the 3rd call, subline 3.3: Management of rights for digital content, of the eContent Programme of the [[European Commission]], DG Information Society. INDICARE, a so called Accompanying Measure, was initiated March 2004 and is scheduled for two years (Ref.: EDC - 53042 INDICARE / 28609). The eContent Programme has been replaced by [[eContentplus]] as of 9 March 2005. == Focus == INDICARE addresses problems pointed out in the eContent Work Programme 2003-2004: “There has been little attention to the [[consumer]] side of managing rights. Questions remain open as to the level of [[consumer]] acceptability of rights management solutions. [[User interface|Interface]] and functionality of systems, as well as policy issues linked to [[privacy]] and access to information should be the investigated. The consumer question also involves the easiness of access, the legitimate use of content and business models and the easiness of access for disabled persons” (p. 19). In addition to consumer issues, INDICARE addresses the user side, in particular concerns of creators and small and medium-sized information providers. == Approach == The INDICARE project establishes and maintains an informed dialogue about [[consumer]] and user issues of DRM. Informed dialogue means that discussions will be stimulated and informed by good quality input such as news information and profound analyses (see below). Part of the input will be derived from interdisciplinary in-depth research of the INDICARE partners as well as from knowledge of experts and stakeholders co-operating with INDICARE. == External links == * [http://www.indicare.org/tiki-view_articles.php INDICARE website ] with all publications * [http://www.cordis.lu/econtent/workprogramme.htm eContent Work Programme 2003-2004 ] * [http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/econtentplus/index_en.htm eContent''plus'' ] == Project Consortium == * [http://www.itas.fzk.de/home_e.htm Institute for Technology Assessment and Systems Analysis (ITAS)], Karlsruhe, Germany (Project Initiator and Co-ordinator) * [http://www.ivir.nl/index-english.html Institute for Information Law (IViR)], University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands * [http://www.mit.bme.hu/eng Department of Measurement and Information Systems], Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Hungary * [http://www.berlecon.de/en/index.html Berlecon Research GmbH], Berlin, Germany [[Category:Digital rights management]]</text> </page> <page> <id>17592</id> <title>INT 10H</title> <text>This corresponds to the [[BIOS interrupt call]] for video services. Such services include setting the video mode, character and string output, and graphics primitives (reading and writing [[pixels]] in graphics mode). To use this call, load AH with the subfunction you want to use, load other parameters in the other registers, and make the call. [[INT (x86 instruction)|INT]] 10h is fairly slow, so many programs bypass this BIOS routine and access the display hardware directly. Setting the video mode, which is done infrequently, can be accomplished by using the [[BIOS]], while drawing graphics on the screen in a game needs to be done quickly, so direct access to video RAM is more appropriate than making a BIOS call for every pixel. ==List of supported functions== {{Expand section|date=December 2007}} {| class = "wikitable" !Function !Parameters !Return |- | Set video mode | AH = 00h AL = video mode | AL = video mode flag / CRT controller mode byte |- | Set text-mode cursor shape | AH = 01h CH = Scan Row Start, CL = Scan Row End Normally a character cell has 8 scan lines, 0-7.
