Currently, the portions capable of being offloaded by VDPAU onto the GPU are [[motion compensation]] (mo comp), [[inverse discrete cosine transform]] (iDCT), [[Variable-length code|VLD (Variable-Length Decoding)]] and [[Deblocking filter (video)|Deblocking]] for [[MPEG-1#Part_2:_Video|MPEG-1]], [[H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2|MPEG-2]], [[MPEG-4 Part 2|MPEG-4 ASP (MPEG-4 Part 2)]], [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] and [[VC-1]], [[WMV3]]/[[WMV9]] encoded videos.<ref name='vdpau_dxva'/> Which specific codecs of these that can be offloaded to the GPU depends on the generation version of the GPU hardware, specifically to also decode MPEG-4 ASP (MPEG-4 Part 2), Xvid / OpenDivX (DivX 4), and DivX 5 formats, a GeForce 200M (2xxM) Series (the eleventh generation of [[NVIDIA]]'s [[GeForce]] [[graphics processing unit]]s) or newer GPU hardware is required.<ref>[http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=NzUxMQ NVIDIA 190.32 Beta Brings New VDPAU Features]</ref> VDPAU can be described as the X Window System equivalent of the [[Microsoft]]'s [[DirectX Video Acceleration|DxVA (DirectX Video Acceleration) API]] for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].<ref name='vdpau_dxva'/> == Device drivers and hardware supporting VDPAU == Each hardware video [[GPU]] capable of VDPAU video acceleration requires a [[X11]] software [[device driver]] to enable these features. Currently only second generation of [[PureVideo HD]] bit-stream processor in some of NVIDIA's [[GeForce 8 series]] and later graphics cards hardware that has support since the Beta device driver version 180.06.<ref name='vdpau_dxva'/> Unsupported hardware from the GeForce 8 series includes the 8800GTS 320/640MB editions and the 8800GTX. Later cards based on the G9x series cores e.g. the 8400GS and the 8800GTS 512mb (G92 core) are supported. Nvidia currently has no plans to introduce support for the unsupported hardware.<ref>http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=123095</ref> All supported graphic devices are listed in [[Nvidia PureVideo]]. [[S3 Graphics]] added support for VDPAU to the Linux drivers of its [[S3 Graphics Chrome 400|Chrome 400]] [[video card]]s since version 14.02.17 of its device driver for Linux, it supports the S3 Chrome 430 GT, S3 Chrome 440 GTX, S3 Chrome 530 GT and the S3 Chrome 540 GTX hardware.<ref>http://drivers.s3graphics.com/en/download/drivers/chrome4x-Linux/RN_Linux_EN.txt</ref> [[Intel]] and [[ATI]] currently offer no support for VDPAU.
