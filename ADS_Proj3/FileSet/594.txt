detection|differential edge detection]], where the requirement of non-maximum suppression is formulated in terms of second- and third-order derivatives computed from a [[scale-space]] representation (Lindeberg 1998) – see the article on [[Edge detection#Differential edge detection|edge detection]] for a detailed description. === Variational-geometric formulation of the Haralick-Canny edge detector === A variational explanation for the main ingredient of the Canny edge detector, that is, finding the zero crossings of the 2nd derivative along the gradient direction, was shown to be the result of minimizing a Kronrod-Minkowski functional while maximizing the integral over the alignment of the edge with the gradient field (Kimmel and Bruckstein 2003) see article on regularized Laplacian zero crossings and other optimal edge integrators for a detailed description. == Parameters == The Canny algorithm contains a number of adjustable parameters, which can affect the computation time and effectiveness of the algorithm. * The size of the Gaussian filter: the smoothing filter used in the first stage directly affects the results of the Canny algorithm. Smaller filters cause less blurring, and allow detection of small, sharp lines. A larger filter causes more blurring, smearing out the value of a given pixel over a larger area of the image. Larger blurring radii are more useful for detecting larger, smoother edges – for instance, the edge of a rainbow. * Thresholds: the use of two thresholds with hysteresis allows more flexibility than in a single-threshold approach, but general problems of thresholding approaches still apply. A threshold set too high can miss important information. On the other hand, a threshold set too low will falsely identify irrelevant information (such as noise) as important. It is difficult to give a generic threshold that works well on all images. No tried and tested approach to this problem yet exists. == Conclusion == The Canny algorithm is adaptable to various environments. Its parameters allow it to be tailored to recognition of edges of differing characteristics depending on the particular requirements of a given implementation. In Canny's original paper, the derivation of the optimal filter led to a [[Finite Impulse Response]] filter, which can be slow to compute in the spatial domain if the amount of smoothing required is important (the filter will have a large spatial support in that case). For this reason, it is often suggested to use [[Rachid Deriche]]'s [[infinite impulse response]] form of Canny's filter (the Canny-Deriche detector), which is recursive, and which can be computed in a short, fixed amount of time for any desired amount of smoothing. The second form is suitable for real time implementations in [[FPGA]]s or [[Digital signal processor|DSPs]], or very fast embedded PCs. In this context, however, the regular recursive implementation of the Canny operator does not give a good approximation of rotational symmetry and therefore gives a bias towards horizontal and vertical edges. ==See also== *[[Feature detection (computer vision)]] *[[Feature extraction]] *[[Scale space]] *[[Ridge detection]] *[[Computer vision]] *[[Digital image processing]] == References == * Canny, J., ''A Computational Approach To Edge Detection'', IEEE Trans.

Regression analysis quantifies a relationship between a predictor variable and a criterion variable by the coefficient of [[correlation]] ''r'', coefficient of determination ''r''², and the standard regression coefficient β. Multiple regression analysis expresses a relationship between a set of predictor variables and a single criterion variable by the [[multiple correlation]] R, multiple coefficient of determination R², and a set of standard partial regression weights β<sub>1</sub>, β<sub>2</sub>, etc. Canonical variate analysis captures a relationship between a set of predictor variables and a set of criterion variables by the [[canonical correlation]]s ρ<sub>1</sub>, ρ<sub>2</sub>, ..., and by the sets of canonical weights C and D. == Canonical analysis == Canonical analysis belongs to a group of methods which involve solving the [[characteristic equation]] for its latent roots and vectors. It describes formal structures in [[Minkowski spacetime|hyperspace]] invariant with respect to the rotation of their coordinates. In this type of solution, rotation leaves many optimizing properties preserved, provided it takes place in certain ways and in a subspace of its corresponding hyperspace. This rotation from the maximum intervariate correlation structure into a different, simpler and more meaningful structure increases the interpretability of the canonical weights C and D. In this the canonical analysis differs from [[Harold Hotelling]]’s (1936) canonical variate analysis (also called the [[canonical correlation analysis]]), designed to obtain maximum (canonical) correlations between the predictor and criterion canonical variates. The difference between the canonical variate analysis and canonical analysis is analogous to the difference between the [[principal components analysis]] and [[factor analysis]], each with its characteristic set of commonalities, [[eigenvalues]] and [[eigenvectors]]. == Canonical analysis (simple) == Canonical analysis is a multivariate technique which is concerned with determining the relationships between groups of variables in a data set. The data set is split into two groups, let's call these groups X and Y, based on some common characteristics. The purpose
