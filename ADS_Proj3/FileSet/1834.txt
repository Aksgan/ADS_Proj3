whole ground-structure system is influenced by the type of ground as well as by the type of structure. The main types of foundations, based upon several building characteristics, are: * Isolated [[plinths]] (currently not feasible) * Plinths connected by foundations beams * Reverse beams * A [[plate]] (used for low-quality grounds) The filing of foundations grounds takes place according to the [[mechanical]] properties of the grounds themselves: in [[Italy]], for instance, according to the new [[earthquake]]-proof norm – Ordinanza 3274/2003 – you can identify the following categories: * Category A: [[homogeneous]] [[Rock (geology)|rock]] formations * Category B: compact [[granular]] or clayey soil * Category C: quite compact granular or clayey soil * Category D: not much compact granular or clayey soil * Category E: [[alluvial]] [[surface]] layer grounds (very low quality soil) The type of [[Foundation (architecture)|foundations]] is selected according to the type of ground; for instance, in the case of homogeneous rock formations connected plinths are selected, while in the case of very low quality grounds plates are chosen. [[Image:groundstruct.jpg]] For further information about the various ways of building foundations see [[foundation (architecture)]]. Both grounds and structures can be more or less deformable; their combination can or cannot cause the [[Amplifier|amplification]] of the [[seismic]] effects on the structure. Ground, in fact, is a filter with respect to all the main [[seismic waves]], as stiffer soil fosters high-frequency seismic waves while less compact soil accommodates lower frequency waves. Therefore, a stiff building, characterized by a high fundamental [[frequency]], suffers amplified damage when built on stiff ground and then subjected to higher frequencies. For instance, suppose there are two buildings that share the same high [[stiffness]]. They stand on two different soil types: the first, stiff and rocky&mdash;the second, sandy and deformable. If subjected to the same seismic event, the building on the stiff ground suffers greater damage. The second interaction effect, tied to mechanical properties of soil, is about the lowering (sinking) of foundations, worsened by the seismic event itself, especially about less compact grounds. This phenomenon is called [[soil liquefaction]]. ==Mitigation== The methods most used to [[mitigate]] the problem of the ground-structure interaction consist of the employment of the before-seen isolation systems and of some ground brace techniques, which are adopted above all on the low-quality ones (categories D and E). The most diffused techniques are the jet-grouting technique and the [[pilework]] technique. The jet-grouting technique consists of injecting in the subsoil some liquid concrete by means of a [[drill]]. When this concrete hardens it forms a sort of column that consolidates the surrounding soil. This process is repeated on all areas of the structure. The pilework technique consists of using piles, which, once inserted in the ground, support the foundation and the building above, by moving the loads or the weights towards soil layers that are deeper and therefore more compact and movement-resistant.

Groundwater models are used to simulate and predict [[aquifer]] conditions. ==Characteristics== [[Image:Aquifer en.svg|thumb|250px|Fig. 1. Typical aquifer cross-section]] An unambiguous definition of "groundwater model" is difficult to give, but there are many common characteristics. A [[groundwater]] model may be a [[scale model]] or an electric model of a groundwater situation or [[aquifer]]. Usually, however, a groundwater model is meant to be a (computer) program for the calculation of groundwater flow and level. Some groundwater models include (chemical) quality aspects of the groundwater. Groundwater models may be used to predict the effects of hydrological changes (like groundwater abstraction or irrigation developments) on the behavior of the aquifer and are often named groundwater simulation models. As the computations in [[mathematics|mathematical]] groundwater models are based on [[groundwater flow equation]]s, which are [[differential equations]] that can often be solved only by [[numerical solution|approximate methods]] using a [[numerical analysis]], these models are also called ''mathematical, numerical, or computational groundwater models''.<ref>Rushton, K.R., 2003, Groundwater Hydrology: Conceptual and Computational Models. John Wiley and Sons Ltd. ISBN 0-470-85004-3</ref> Various types of ''numerical solutions'' like the [[finite difference method]] and the [[finite element method]] are discussed in the article on "[[Hydrogeology]]". ==Inputs== For the calculations one needs inputs like: *hydrological inputs, *operational inputs, *external conditions: [[Initial condition|initial]] and [[Boundary condition|boundary]] conditions, *(hydraulic) [[parameters]]. The model may have chemical components like [[salinity|water salinity]], [[soil salinity]] and other quality indicators of water and soil, for which inputs may also be needed. ===Hydrological inputs=== The hydrological inputs may consist of hydrological data like [[rainfall]], [[evapotranspiration]] and [[surface runoff]], which determine the [[Groundwater recharge|recharge]]. These inputs may vary both from time to time and from place to place. [[Image:Surface water cycle.svg‎|thumb|150px|left|Hydrological factors at the soil surface determining the recharge]] ===Operational inputs=== The operational inputs concern human interferences with the ''water management'' like [[irrigation]], [[drainage]], pumping from [[Water well|wells]], [[watertable control]], and the operation of [[Retention basin|retention]] or [[Infiltration basin|infiltration]] basins, which are often of an hydrological nature. <br /> These inputs may also vary in time and space. Many groundwater models are made for the purpose of assessing the effects [[hydraulic engineering]] measures. [[File:Boundary value problem-en.svg|thumb|250px|Fig. 2. Boundary conditions]] ===Boundary and initial conditions=== ''Boundary conditions'' can be related to levels of the [[water table]], [[artesian aquifer|artesian pressures]], and [[hydraulic head]] along the boundaries of the model on the one hand (the ''head conditions''), or to groundwater inflows and outflows along the boundaries of the model on the other hand (the ''flow conditions''). The may also include quality aspects of the water like salinity. The ''initial conditions'' refer to initial values of elements that may increase or decrease in the course of the time ''inside'' the model domain and they cover largely the same phenomena as the boundary conditions do.
