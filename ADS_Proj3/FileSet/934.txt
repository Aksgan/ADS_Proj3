section of this discussion. === The Control-Feedback concept === The Control – Feedback concept consisted of a ‘Control’ that gave information on the way the component was to perform and then adjustments to the control's present operation based upon the feedback. It used a concept called ‘Sampling’ to determine how often the ‘Control’ used the ‘Feedback’ information so that the ‘Control’ could modify instructions to the component. == What is the CFA Loop == Figure 1 shows a model of the CFA loop. The CFA loop consists of three main elements - The Control element, the Feedback element and the Abort element. Within any system, the lack of any one of these three elements will result in the system failing at some point in time. The term ‘system’ used in this document can represent any environment, task, process, procedure or system in a physical, organizational or natural structure where an entity will respond to influences. It has been found, through experience, that even trees appear to follow the CFA model. The diagram in Figure 1 can be used as an analysis diagram by inserting functions of the controls, feedbacks and aborts in each of the related circles defining the system being analyzed. (Example: Control - Workflow requests, Feedback - Results of requests, Aborts - Requests that failed, workflow exception path) The CFA model can be used effectively with 3-sigma Control Charts. CFA loops and Control Charts share the same functionality, which will be discussed later in this document. [[File:CFALOOP1 Fig1.jpg]] Figure 1 – The CFA Loop == A description of the Control-Feedback-Abort (CFA) Loop == As mentioned, the CFA Loop consists of three elements – Control, Feedback and Abort. First, we will discuss the Control element of the loop. === The control element === The Control element of the CFA loop, as highlighted in Figure 2, controls the activity of the system in question. A basic characteristic of the Control element is that it is always in a static state until it receives new information from the feedback. This static state is, in reality, the Control element holding the system in a [[status quo]] condition. Using an automobile as an example, if the previous instruction provided by the Control to the auto was to accelerate, it would continue to accelerate until a feedback reading would indicate to the Control that the Control should issue an instruction to stop accelerating. Remember, the idea of the static condition is not saying that nothing is happening but rather to say that nothing is changing in the instructions given to the system since the last instruction from the Control. If the last instruction by the Control is to accelerate, the system will continue to accelerate until told otherwise. The Control element is the ‘primary control’ for the system. While everything is operating within a ‘normal’ operational mode, the Control element remains the primary control. [[File:CFALOOP2 Fig2.jpg]] Figure 2 – CFA Loop – Control Element === The feedback element === The Feedback element feeds back information on the present state of the system. Due to the fact that the Feedback element is always reading the present state of the system, the feedback element has the basic characteristic of always being in a ‘dynamic’ state. This means that the feedback is reading constantly changing conditions. No system is ever in a non-changing condition except if it is off, no longer functioning or dead. Look at a computer in a [[wait state]]. It is still performing administrative activities even while it waits for some activity to happen. Change is the constant state of the Feedback element. For this reason, the Feedback element needs to provide information to the Control element at intervals necessary to provide the Control element time to adequately respond to the changing environment. This interval period is called ‘sampling’, which will be discussed later in this document. [[File:CFALOOP3 Fig3.jpg]] Figure 3 – CFA Loop – Feedback Element The communication between the Control element and the Feedback element is performed by way of the ‘Primary Path’ (see Figure 4). The Primary Path is a bidirectional path that allows for the Control Element to request a sample of the information and the Feedback element to respond. [[File:CFALOOP4 Fig4.jpg]] Figure 4 – CFA Loop – Primary Path === The abort element === The Abort element (see Figure 5) is so named because it responds to conditions that resulted in the primary path being ‘aborted’. The Abort element then takes over the act of control until conditions can be brought back into acceptable parameters. [[File:CFALOOP5 Fig5.jpg]] Figure 5 – CFA Loop – Abort Element The ‘Alternate Path’ (see Figure 6) is used for communication between the Alternate Control (Abort) and the Feedback. The Feedback at this point may be a different set of feedbacks than was defined for the primary path. [[File:CFALOOP6 Fig 6.jpg]] Figure 6 – CFA Loop – Alternate Path To demonstrate that the Feedback may be another set of feedback elements, we look at the following example. Let’s use the act of driving the auto once more for our example (see Figure 7). When a driver is driving the car, the primary path is the Control element (gas pedal) and the Feedback element (speedometer and [[Traffic sign|street signs]]). Once a [[stop sign]] is detected ahead, the driver will take the foot off the gas pedal (primary control) and press the brake pedal (alternate control). Note that the driver is no longer looking at the speedometer or street signs once the auto gets to the stop sign. The driver is looking for other cars that may cross his path. In other words, the driver is looking for a different set of feedback sources. Once he feels it is safe to go, he will go back to the primary control and feedback and the primary path.
