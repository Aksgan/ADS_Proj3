inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Photo Story 3 for Windows.jpg|thumb|Screenshot of Photo Story 3 for Windows, one of the programs that encode video using the Windows Media Video 9.1 Image codec.]] --> Windows Media Video Image (WMV Image) is a video [[slideshow]] codec. The codec works by applying timing, [[panning (camera)|panning]] and transition effects to a series of images during playback.<ref name="image">[http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/forpros/codecs/video.aspx#WindowsMediaVideo9ImageVersion2 Windows Media Video 9 Series Codecs: Windows Media Video 9 Image Version 2]</ref> The codec achieves a higher compression ratio and image quality than WMV 9 for still images as files encoded with WMV Image store static images rather than full-motion video. Since the codec relies on the decoder (player) to generate video frames in real-time, playing WMV Image files even at moderate resolutions (e.g. 30 [[frames per second]] at 1024 Ã— 768 resolution) requires heavy computer processing. The latest version of the codec, WMV 9.1 Image, used by [[Photo Story]] 3, features additional transformation effects, but is not compatible with the original WMV 9 Image codec.<ref name="image" /> Hardware support for WMV Image is available from Portable Media Centers, [[Windows Mobile]]-powered devices with Windows Media Player 10 Mobile.<ref name="winmobilefaq" /> Since no known domestic DVD player supports this format, users of Photo Story 3 wishing to generate material capable of being played in a DVD player will first have to convert to [[MPEG-2]] before burning a DVD (average file sizes in MPEG-2 are 5 to 6 times the .wmv file). ==Video quality== Microsoft claims that WMV 9 provides a compression ratio that is two times better than MPEG-4, and three times better than <ref>ebu.ch/en/technical/trev/trev_301-samviq.pdf Subjective quality of internet video codecs - Phase 2 evaluations using SAMVIQ]</ref> Many 3rd party WMV compilers have had worse performance than [[Windows Movie Maker]]. ==Players== Software that can play WMV files include [[Windows Media Player]], [[RealPlayer]], [[MPlayer]], [[The KMPlayer]], [[Media Player Classic]] and [[VLC Media Player]]. The Microsoft Zune media management software supports the WMV codec, but uses a Zune-specific variation of [[Windows Media DRM]] which is used by PlaysForSure. Many third-party players exist for various platforms such as [[Linux]] that use the [[FFmpeg]] implementation of the WMV codecs. On the [[Macintosh]] platform, Microsoft released a [[PowerPC]] version of Windows Media Player for [[Mac OS X]] in 2003,<ref name="wmp9mac">[http://www.microsoft.com/mac/downloads.aspx?pid=download&location=/mac/download/misc/winmp_osx.xml&secid=80&ssid=8&flgnosysreq=True Windows Media Player 9 for Mac OS X ]</ref> but further development of the software has ceased. Microsoft currently endorses the 3rd party [[Flip4Mac]] WMV, a [[QuickTime]] Component which allows Macintosh users to play WMV files in any player that uses the QuickTime framework.<ref name="flip4mac">[http://www.microsoft.com/mac/otherproducts/otherproducts.aspx?pid=windowsmedia Important information for Windows Media Player for Mac users]</ref> The WMV installer is bundled with Microsoft Silverlight by default, installation without Silverlight can be accomplished with a "Custom" install. According to the Flip4Mac website, WMV files with DRM encryption are not compatible with the component. ==Decoders / Transcoders== [[Linux]] users can rely on [[FFmpeg]] based software like [[MPlayer]], [[MEncoder]]. For [[Macintosh|Mac]] or [[Windows]] users who wish to convert non-DRM WMV to [[MP4]], [[HandBrake]] is [[Free Software]] that will do the job. ==Encoders== Software that exports video in WMV format include [[Avid]] (PC Version), [[Windows Movie Maker]], [[Windows Media Encoder]], [[Microsoft Expression Encoder]], [[Sorenson Squeeze]],<ref name="premiere">[http://sorensonmedia.com Sorenson Media<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Sony Vegas Pro]],<ref name="vegas pro">[http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/products/product.asp?PID=457&PageID=107 Sony Creative Software - Vegas Pro 8 - Technical Specifications<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Adobe Premiere Pro]], [[Adobe After Effects]], [[Telestream Episode]], [[Total video converter]] and [[Telestream FlipFactory]].<ref name="premiere">[http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewContent.do?externalId=332612 Supported file formats in Adobe Premiere Pro 2.0]</ref><ref name="Easy Ingest">[http://www.easymediasuite.com <!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Programs that encode using the WMV Image codec include [[Windows Media Encoder]] and [[Photo Story]]. ==Digital rights management== {{Main|Windows Media DRM}} While none of the WMV codecs themselves contain any [[digital rights management]] facilities, the ASF container format, in which a WMV stream may be encapsulated, can. Windows Media DRM, which can be used in conjunction with WMV, supports time-limited subscription video services such as those offered by [[CinemaNow]].<ref name="cinemanow">[http://www.playsforsure.com/ItemDetail.aspx?id=26 PlaysForSure: CinemaNow]</ref> Windows Media DRM, a component of PlaysForSure and [[Windows Media Connect]], is supported on many modern portable video devices and streaming media clients such as the Xbox 360. ==Criticism== WMV has been the subject of numerous complaints from users and the press. Users dislike the digital rights management system which is sometimes attached to WMV files.<ref name="inquirerrights">[http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=34523 Microsoft Media Player shreds your rights]</ref> The loss of the ability to restore licenses for WMV files in the Windows Media Player 11 was not positively received.<ref name="inquirerrights" /> In addition, the Microsoft Zune does not support the standard Windows Media DRM system, rendering protected WMV files unplayable.<ref name="inquirerzune">[http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=34478 Zune won't play MS DRM infected files]</ref> ==Versions== {| class="wikitable" |- !
