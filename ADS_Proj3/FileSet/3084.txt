If each player has chosen a strategy and no player can benefit by changing his or her strategy while the other players keep theirs unchanged, then the current set of strategy choices and the corresponding payoffs constitute a Nash equilibrium. Stated simply, Amy and Phil are in Nash equilibrium if Amy is making the best decision she can, taking into account Phil's decision, and Phil is making the best decision he can, taking into account Amy's decision. Likewise, a group of players is in Nash equilibrium if each one is making the best decision that he or she can, taking into account the decisions of the others. However, Nash equilibrium does not necessarily mean the best cumulative payoff for all the players involved; in many cases all the players might improve their payoffs if they could somehow agree on strategies different from the Nash equilibrium (e.g., competing businesses forming a [[cartel]] in order to increase their profits). ==Applications== The Nash equilibrium concept is used to analyze the outcome of the [[strategy|strategic interaction]] of several [[decision making|decision makers]]. In other words, it is a way of predicting what will happen if several people or several institutions are making decisions at the same time, and if the outcome depends on the decisions of the others. The simple insight underlying John Nash's idea is that we cannot predict the result of the choices of multiple decision makers if we analyze those decisions in isolation. Instead, we must ask what each player would do, ''taking into account'' the decision-making of the others. Nash equilibrium has been used to analyze hostile situations like [[war]] and [[arms race]]s<ref>Schelling, Thomas, ''[http://books.google.es/books?id=7RkL4Z8Yg5AC&dq=thomas+schelling+strategy+of+conflict&printsec=frontcover&source=bn&hl=en&ei=xuSjSbK-I4-O_gai_ticBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=4&ct=result#PPP13,M1 The Strategy
