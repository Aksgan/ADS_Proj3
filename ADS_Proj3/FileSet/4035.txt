As well as an Elta EL/L-8300 SIGINT system,<ref name=Elta-ELL8300>{{citation | url = http://www.janes.com/extracts/extract/jrew/jrew1088.html | title = EL/L-8300 (Israel), AIRBORNE SIGNALS INTELLIGENCE (SIGINT), ELECTRONIC SUPPORT AND THREAT WARNING SYSTEMS | journal = Jane's Radar and Electronic Warfare Systems | date =July 12, 2007 }} {{Dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref> In the baseline version, this multi-operator Elta system contains 0.5 to 18 GHz ELINT (0.03 to 40 GHz as an option), 20 to 1,000 MHz (2 to 1,500 MHz as an option) COMINT, and control and analysis sub-systems. In addition to the SIGINT payload, the aircraft has a Tamam Stabilised Long Range Observation System (LOROS) high-resolution TV camera and recording systems.<ref name=SLOROS>{{citation | url = http://www.iai.co.il/Default.aspx?FolderID=18688&lang=en | title = Electro-optical payloads }}</ref> The SLOROS is reported to have a range of at least 62 miles (100 km). The aircraft has been reported around the western edge of North Africa, the Western Sahara and the Mediterranean.<ref name=Spyflight707 /> ===Sweden: Aircraft Platforms=== The Swedish Air Force operates the S-102B Korpen aircraft which is a modified Gulfstream G-IV business jet. ===Turkey: Aircraft Platforms=== Turkey has 6 C-130B ELINT aircraft, ===United Kingdom: Aircraft Platforms=== The British [[Hawker_Siddeley_Nimrod#R1|Nimrod R1]] is a variant of the Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft. Its sensors cover the tactical to strategic spectrum. It is reported to have a SIGINT suite from Thales.<ref name=SpyflightFrance /> UK E4D AWACS also have SIGINT capability.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} ===United States: Aircraft Platforms=== Some platforms considered strategic, including the [[P-3]] and [[RC-135]] RIVET JOINT aircraft, may be assigned in support of large tactical units. There are both MASINT and SIGINT versions of the RC-135, the best-known SIGINT variant being the RC-135V/W RIVET JOINT. ====United States: Tactical Aircraft Platforms==== In the 1950s and 1960s, SIGINT personnel flew aboard Navy EA-3B aircraft. As a result of ASA casualties during ground SIGINT in Vietnam, ASA developed its own fleet of tactical SIGINT aircraft, starting with the U-6 Beaver. The reconnaissance mission for these aircraft was indicated with an "R" prefix, hence RU-6. Beavers, however, had poor capabilities. The RU-1 Otter had more built-in SIGINT equipment, but the first purpose-built Army SIGINT aircraft was the RU-8D Seminole, which had a Doppler navigation system and wing-mounted direction-finding equipment, although SIGINT operations still required much manual work. Some RU-8D aircraft had MASINT sensors for categorizing specific transmissions. Especially with tactical aircraft, there was a gap between the knowledge of SIGINT personnel and the understanding of warfighters. For example, end users often expected a direction-finding fix to be a point, rather than an area of probability. In 1968, the next tactical improvement was the RU-21 LAFFIN EAGLE and the JU-21 LEFT JAB, the latter being the first with computerized direction finding and data storage. Even more advanced ASA equipment was on P-2V aircraft borrowed from the Navy, and called CEFLIEN LION or CRAZY CAT platforms. During the Vietnam era, six UH-1 helicopters were converted to SIGINT platforms, called EH-1 LEFT BANK aircraft and operated in direct support of combat aircraft. US tactical SIGINT aircraft include the EH-60A Quickfix helicopter, which has interception capabilities in the 1.5-150 MHz and direction finding between 20-76 MHz. The EH-60L has better communications and ungradability than the A model, with the AN/MSR-3 TACJAM-A system <ref>{{Cite web | last = Pike | first = John | authorlink = John E.

[[RC-12]] Guardrail aircraft provide a corps-level ESM capability, with the unusual approach of putting all the analysis equipment on the ground, with the RC-12K/N/P/Q aircraft acting purely as intercept and relay platforms. The Guardrail aircraft normally fly in units of three, to get better cross-bearings in direction-finding. The Navy EA-6 replaced the USAF EF-111 EW aircraft for all services, and the EA-6 is being replaced by the EF-18G Growler. All EW aircraft have some ELINT capability if for no other reason than targeting. Naval MH-60R helicopters have AN/ALQ-210 ESM suites. ====United States: Strategic Aircraft Platforms==== The most common aircraft used in a strategic role by US allies are Boeing 707 conversions for the lower-budget, lower-capability installations, and Boeing 767 conversions for the higher-end. Gulfstream executive jets are another platform of interest. The US military is considering, as its aircraft age, replacing with variants on the foreign platforms, often built on US-made aircraft. Some features are common to multiple countries, such as a pair are two "chipmunk cheek" bulges containing SIGINT antennas. There is a US made set used on the RC-135V and RC-135W Rivet Joint aircraft. A US-made variant, reported to have internal differences, is used by Saudi Arabia. A third variant, with a similar appearance, but of Israeli manufacture, are used by Israel and South Africa. In no case, however, are these the only SIGINT antennas on the aircraft <ref name=Spyflight707>{{Citation | title = The Spyflight Website | date=1 January 2007 | url = http://www.spyflight.co.uk/boeing707.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-09 }}</ref>. Dedicated [[RC-135]] aircraft, operated by the US Air Force, are in a variety of SIGINT and MASINT configurations. An effort is underway to develop a standard RC-135 open architecture, allowing at least some of the aircraft to be quickly reconfigured. RIVET JOINT is the most common SIGINT type. On the long-range Navy P-3 maritime surveillance aircraft is the AN/ALR-66B(V)3 ELINT/MASINT system targeted against radars. Major improvements are an improved direction-finding antenna and an EP-2060 pulse analyzer.<ref name=NISR /> The dedicated SIGINT EP-3 uses a JMOD (Joint Airborne SIGINT Modification)
