While working with [[Vikram Adve]], he designed and began the implementation of LLVM, an innovative infrastructure for [[Compiler optimization|optimizing compilers]], which was the subject of his 2002 MSc thesis. He completed a PhD in 2005, researching new techniques for optimizing pointer-intensive programs and adding them to LLVM. In 2005, [[Apple Inc.]] hired Lattner to work with a newly-formed team of LLVM developers. Lattner's recent work involves designing, implementing, and evangelizing the [[LLVM]] and [[Clang]] compilers, as well as a new set of assemblers and disassemblers. This work may eventually replace the GCC compiler suite on a broad variety of systems. It is already used in Apple systems. In June 2010, the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]'s [[Special Interest Group]] on [[programming language]]s ([[SIGPLAN]]) gave Lattner its inaugural Programming Languages Software Award "for his design and development of the Low Level Virtual Machine", noting that Professor Adve has stated "that Lattner’s talent as a compiler architect, together with his programming skills, technical vision, and leadership ability were crucial to the success of LLVM."<ref name=SIGPLAN/> ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== {{wikiquote}} *[http://www.nondot.org/sabre/ Chris Lattner homepage] {{DEFAULTSORT:Lattner, Chris}} [[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign alumni]] [[Category:Apple Inc. employees]] [[Category:American computer programmers]] [[Category:American computer scientists]] [[Category:University of Portland alumni]] {{compu-scientist-stub}} {{US-compu-bio-stub}} [[fr:Chris Lattner]]</text> </page> <page> <id>6187</id> <title>Chris Watts</title> <text>{{Infobox person |name = Chris Watts |image = Csw.jpg |full_name = Christopher Stella Watts |birth_date = {{Birth date and age|mf=yes|1965|6|16|mf=46}} |birth_place = [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], [[California]], [[United States]] |nationality = {{flagicon|United States}} [[United States|American]] |occupation = President of Bake Visual Effects Inc.,<br />[[Visual effects supervisor|Visual Effects Supervisor]] |years active = 1985–Present |awards = [[Satellite Award for Best Visual Effects]]<br />[[Visual Effects Society|VES Award for Outstanding Visual Effects in a Music Video]] |spouse = Betsy Paterson (1999–2001)<br />Joyce Wu (2006–2007) |children = TC Watts <br />Noelle Mckenzie Watts |website = [http://www.bake.org/ Bake VFX] }} {{Portal box|Visual Arts|Film}} '''Chris Watts''' (born June 16, 1965), is an [[United States|American]] inventor, businessman, award winning [[filmmaker]] and [[Visual effects supervisor|Visual Effects Supervisor]].
