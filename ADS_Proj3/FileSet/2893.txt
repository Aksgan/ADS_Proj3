state. After some time, the project was incorporated within a bigger plan. OSIS was an effort to create an Atari TOS/GEM compatible environment for Linux, constisting of the subsystems oTOSis (TOS/MiNT replacement), oAESis (AES replacement), oVDIsis (VDI replacement) and oFBis (a framebuffer library). On a funny side note, the name OSIS is also Swedish slang for "bad luck". The project progressed until around year 2000, when it seemed like the involved programmers were losing interest and time to keep things going. '''XaAES''' Also started in 1995, there was XaAES. The UK programmer Craig Graham was frustrated that there was no decent user interface that could take advantage of the power of the pre-emptive multitasking in MiNT. '''[http://myaes.lutece.net MyAeS]''' is another AES project, it was started in May 2003 in France, by Olivier Landemarre. First public version was available in February 2004. == See also == * [[EmuTOS]] * [[Atari TOS]] * [[MultiTOS]] * [[XaAES]] * [[SpareMiNT]] == External links == *[http://xaaes.atariforge.net The Unofficial XaAES page] *[http://myaes.lutece.net The Official MyAeS page] * [http://www.old-computers.com/museum/doc.asp?c=125 MiNT is Now TOS &ndash; an interview with Mr Eric R.

It is designed for low data transmission rates and short distance, cost constrained networks, such as industrial monitoring and control, home and building automation, remote control, low-power wireless sensors, lighting control and automated meter reading. The MiWi protocols are supported on certain Microchip [[PIC microcontroller|PIC]] and [[PIC_microcontroller#PIC24 and dsPIC 16-bit microcontrollers|dsPIC]] [[microcontroller]]s. When developing for these platforms, proprietary [[Software development kit|SDK]]s and hardware development tools, such as the [[#Hardware|ZENA]] wireless packet sniffer, may be used. ==Protocols== Microchip has released two application notes which present technical information on MiWi.<ref>[http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&nodeId=1824&appnote=en520606 AN1066] MiWi Wireless Networking Protocol Stack, describing the Microchip MiWi stack</ref><ref>[http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&nodeId=1824&appnote=en536181 AN1204] Microchip MiWi P2P Wireless Protocol, focussing on MiWi P2P</ref> These are not primarily protocol specifications and more than half of these documents are focussed on implementing the MiWi protocol on Microchip microcontrollers. As of 2009, interoperable third party implementations have not appeared. Unless they do, it will not be clear if those specifications are complete or accurate enough to serve roles other than supporting Microchip's code or being one more proprietary example of a lightweight WPAN stack. Many developers trying to use WPAN technologies have observed that [[Zigbee]] seems undesirably complex.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Accordingly, there exists a technical niche for a simpler protocols, of which MiWi is a proprietary example. ==Software== On the PIC platform, the MiWi protocol stacks are small foot-print alternatives (3K-17K) to [[ZigBee]] (40K-100K), which makes them useful for cost-sensitive applications with limited memory. Although the MiWi software can all be downloaded for free from its official website, there exists a unique restriction and obligation to use it only with Microchip microcontrollers.<ref>[http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&nodeId=2113&param=en520414 Microchip ZigBee Protocol Connectivity Solutions]</ref> The MiWi P2P protocol stack supports [[Star network|star]] and [[peer-to-peer]] wireless-network topologies, useful for simple, short-range, wireless node-to-node communication. Additionally, the stack provides sleeping-node, active-scan and energy-detect features while supporting the low-power requirements of battery-operated devices. ==Hardware== In 2008, Microchip released a 2.4 GHz wireless transceiver module that is compatible with certain Microchip PIC and dsPIC microcontrollers, and can be used in production devices.<ref>[http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&nodeId=2664&param=en535767 Microchip MRF24J40MA 2.4GHz IEEE 802.15.4 Transceiver Module]</ref> Being ZigBee compliant, and capable of communicating using MiWi wireless protocols, it is based on the IEEE 802.15.4 Wireless PAN standard. Designed only for low-data rates and being low-cost, it has an integrated [[Antenna (radio)|PCB antenna]]. The module is regulatory-agency certified for the USA ([[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC)), Canada ([[Industry Canada]]) and Europe ([[ETSI]]), and would save money for small and medium project designers, by eliminating the need to receive independent FCC certification for their wireless products.<ref>[http://www.electronicstalk.com/news/ari/ari279.html Ready-certified transceiver eases radio design] Electronicstalk</ref> The Microchip '''ZENA''' (or formerly, '''Z'''igbee '''E'''nhanced '''N'''etwork '''A'''nalyzer) is a wireless packet sniffer and network analyzer following the IEEE 802.15.4 specification on the 2.4 GHz band. The ZENA analyzer supports both the ZigBee and MiWi protocols. Accompanying software can analyze network traffic and graphically display decoded packets. It can also display the network topology and the messages as they flow through the network. With the provided key of the network, data on encrypted MiWi networks can be sniffed and viewed as well.<ref>[http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&nodeId=1406&dDocName=en520682 Microchip ZENA wireless network analyzer]</ref> ==References== {{Reflist}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Miwi}} [[Category:Wireless networking]] [[Category:IEEE 802]] [[Category:Home automation]] [[Category:Personal area networks]]</text> </page> <page> <id>24272</id> <title>Mice problem</title> <text>[[File:N=2.jpg|thumb|right|n=2]] [[File:Problema dei topi n=3 animazione.gif|thumb|right|n=3]] [[File:Problema dei topi n=6 animazione.gif|thumb|right|n=6]] In mathematics, the '''mice problem''' is a problem in which a number of mice (or bugs, dogs, missiles, etc.), starting from the corners of a regular polygon, follow each other and it must be determined when they meet. The most common version has the mice starting at the corners of a unit square, moving at unit speed. In this case they meet after a time of one unit, because the distance between two neighboring bugs always decreases at a speed of one unit. More generally, for a regular polygon of ''n'' sides, the distance between neighboring bugs decreases at a speed of 1 &minus; cos(2&pi;/''n''), so they meet after a time of 1/(1 &minus; cos(2&pi;/''n'')). ==References== *{{citation|last=Gamow |first=George|author1-link=George Gamow|last2=Stern|first2=Marvin|title=Puzzle math|year=1958|pages=112–114|publisher=Viking press|publication-place=New York}} *{{citation|authorlink=Édouard Lucas|last=Lucas|first= E. |title=Problem of the Three Dogs|journal= Nouv.
