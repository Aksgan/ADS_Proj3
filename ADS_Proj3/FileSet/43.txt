Gave rise to many other programming languages, including [[BCPL]], [[B (programming language)|B]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[Simula]], [[C (programming language)|C]], and many others. [[ALGOL 58]] introduced code blocks and the <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> pairs for delimiting them. ALGOL 60 was the first language implementing [[nested function]] definitions with [[lexical scope]]. [[Niklaus Wirth]] based his own [[ALGOL W]] on ALGOL 60 before moving to develop [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]. Algol-W was intended to be the next generation ALGOL but the [[ALGOL 68]] committee decided on a design that was more complex and advanced rather than a cleaned simplified ALGOL 60. The official ALGOL versions are named after the year they were first published. Note: [[ALGOL 68]] is substantially different from Algol 60 but was not well received so that in general "Algol" means dialects of Algol 60. ==Standardization== ALGOL 60 - with [[COBOL]] - were the first languages to seek standardization. * ISO 1538:1984, Programming language Algol 60 (now withdrawn) * ISO TR 1672:1977, Algol 60 Hardware Representation (now withdrawn) ==History== ALGOL 60 was used mostly by research computer scientists in the United States and in Europe. Its use in commercial applications was hindered by the absence of standard input/output facilities in its description and the lack of interest in the language by large computer vendors. ALGOL 60 did however become the standard for the publication of algorithms and had a profound effect on future language development. [[John Backus]] developed the [[Backus–Naur Form|Backus normal form]] method of describing programming languages specifically for ALGOL 58. It was revised and expanded by [[Peter Naur]] for ALGOL 60, and at [[Donald Knuth]]'s suggestion renamed [[Backus–Naur Form]].<ref>Knuth, Donald E. (1964) Backus Normal Form vs Backus Naur Form. Communications of the ACM 7(12):735-736</ref> Peter Naur: "As editor of the ALGOL Bulletin I was drawn into the international discussions of the language and was selected to be member of the European language design group in November 1959. In this capacity I was the editor of the ALGOL 60 report, produced as the result of the ALGOL 60 meeting in Paris in January 1960."<ref name="naur_acm">[http://awards.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1024454&srt=all&aw=140&ao=AMTURING&yr=2005 ACM Award Citation / Peter Naur], 2005</ref> The following people attended the meeting in Paris (from January 1 to 16): * [[Friedrich L. Bauer]], [[Peter Naur]], [[Heinz Rutishauser]], [[Klaus Samelson]], [[Bernard Vauquois]], [[Adriaan van Wijngaarden]], and [[Michael Woodger]] (from Europe) * [[John Backus|John W. Backus]], [[Julien Green (computer scientist)|Julien Green]], [[Charles Katz]], [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]], [[Alan Perlis|Alan J. Perlis]], and [[Joseph Henry Wegstein]] (from the USA). Alan Perlis gave a vivid description of the meeting: "The meetings were exhausting, interminable, and exhilarating. One became aggravated when one's good ideas were discarded along with the bad ones of others. Nevertheless, diligence persisted during the entire period. The chemistry of the 13 was excellent." Both John Backus and Peter Naur served on the committee which created ALGOL 60 as did [[Wally Feurzeig]], who later created [[Logo (programming language)|Logo]]. ALGOL 60 inspired many languages that followed it. [[C. A. R. Hoare]] remarked: "Here is a language so far ahead of its time that it was not only an improvement on its predecessors but also on nearly all its successors."<ref>[http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~bchandra/courses/papers/Hoare_Hints.pdf "Hints on Programming Language Design"], C.A.R.
