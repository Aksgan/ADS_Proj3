It can take the form of [[art]], [[drawing]]s, or [[language|word]]s, including [[poetry]] and personal reflections. Other types of Latrinalia include Political commentary as well as Derogatory comments and pictures. When done without the [[property]] owner's [[consent]], it constitutes [[vandalism]]. Some venues have attempted to curb such vandalism by installing in the restrooms large [[blackboard]]s and providing free [[chalk]]; it is hoped that patrons will avail themselves of the blackboard and chalk rather than applying their latrinalia directly to the walls or toilet stalls.<ref>[http://130.212.44.5/storys01.php?storyid=3407 Golden Gate [X&#93;Press Online | R.I.P.

Instead of solving the [[Navier–Stokes equations]], the discrete [[Boltzmann equation]] is solved to simulate the flow of a [[Newtonian fluid]] with [[collision]] models such as [[Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook]] (BGK). By simulating streaming and collision processes across a limited number of particles, the intrinsic particle interactions evince a microcosm of viscous flow behavior applicable across the greater mass. ==Algorithm== LBM is a relatively new simulation technique for complex fluid systems and has attracted interest from researchers in computational physics. Unlike the traditional CFD methods, which solve the conservation equations of macroscopic properties (i.e., mass, momentum, and energy) numerically, LBM models the fluid consisting of fictive particles, and such particles perform consecutive propagation and collision processes over a discrete lattice mesh. Due to its particulate nature and local dynamics, LBM has several advantages over other conventional CFD methods, especially in dealing with complex boundaries, incorporating of microscopic interactions, and parallelization of the algorithm. A different interpretation of the lattice Boltzmann equation is that of a discrete-velocity Boltzmann equation. The numerical methods of solution of the system of partial differential equations then gives rise to a discrete map, which can be interpreted as the propagation and collision of fictitious particles. In the computer algorithm, the collision and streaming step are defined as follows: Collision step: <math>f_i^t(\vec{x},t+\delta_t) = f_i(\vec{x},t) + \frac{1}{\tau_f} (f_i^{eq}-f_i)\,\!</math> Streaming step: <math>f_i(\vec{x}+\vec{e}_i\delta_t,t+\delta_t) =f_i^t(\vec{x},t+\delta_t) \,\! </math> ==Development from the LGA method== LBM originated from the [[lattice gas automata]] (LGA) method, which can be considered as a simplified fictitious molecular dynamics model in which space, time, and particle velocities are all discrete.
