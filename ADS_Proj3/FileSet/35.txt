It was founded in 1969 by [[Andries van Dam|Andy van Dam]] (its direct predecessor, ACM SICGRAPH was founded two years earlier in 1967).<ref>ACM SIGGRAPH: "[http://www.siggraph.org/programs/pioneers/reception Personal Reflections on four decades of Computer Graphics]"</ref> ACM SIGGRAPH convenes the annual [[SIGGRAPH]] conference, attended by tens of thousands of computer professionals. The organization also sponsors other conferences around the world, and regular events are held by its professional and student chapters in several countries. The organization's stated values are excellence, integrity, volunteerism, passion and cross-disciplinary interaction. ''[[Computer Graphics (publication)|Computer Graphics]]'' is the quarterly [[periodical publication]] of ACM SIGGRAPH. ==See also== * [[Association for Computing Machinery]] * [[ACM Transactions on Graphics]] * [[Computer Graphics (publication)]] * [[SIGGRAPH|SIGGRAPH Conferences]] ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://wiki.siggraph.org/ ACM SIGGRAPH wiki] *[http://www.siggraph.org/ ACM SIGGRAPH website] *[http://www.siggraph.org/mainblog/ ACM SIGGRAPH blog] *[http://chapters.siggraph.org/ ACM SIGGRAPH chapters] {{compu-graphics-stub}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Acm Siggraph}} [[Category:Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Groups]] [[Category:Computer graphics organizations]] [[Category:Organizations established in 1969]] [[fr:Pôle Graphisme et Infographie de l'ACM]]</text> </page> <page> <id>308</id> <title>ACORD</title> <text>'''ACORD''', the Association for Cooperative Operations Research and Development, is the [[insurance]] industry's nonprofit standards developer, a resource for information about [[object technology]], [[EDI]], [[XML]] and [[electronic commerce]] in the United States and abroad. ACORD's most widely known accomplishment is the publication and maintenance of a huge library of standardized forms for the insurance industry.

It is based on the theory of [[John Maynard Keynes]] presented in his work ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money]]''. One of the primary simplified representations in the modern field of [[macroeconomics]], and is used by a broad array of economists, from [[libertarian]], [[Monetarist]] supporters of [[laissez-faire]], such as [[Milton Friedman]] to [[Post-Keynesian economics|Post-Keynesian]] supporters of [[economic interventionism]], such as [[Joan Robinson]]. ==Modeling== The AD/AS model is used to illustrate the [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] model of the [[business cycle]]. Movements of the two curves can be used to predict the effects that various [[exogeny|exogenous]] events will have on two variables: real [[GDP]] and the [[price level]]. Furthermore, the model can be incorporated as a component in any of a variety of dynamic models (models of how variables like the price level and others evolve over time). The AD-AS model can be related to the [[Phillips curve]] model of wage or price inflation and unemployment. ==Aggregate demand curve== {{main|Aggregate Demand}} The AD curve is defined by the IS-LM equilibrium income at different potential price levels. The equation for the AD curve in general terms is: : <math>Y=Y^{d}(\tfrac{M}{P}, G, T, Z_1)</math> where Y is real [[GDP]], M is the nominal [[money supply]], G is real [[government spending]], T is an exogenous component of real taxes levied, P is the [[price level]], and Z<sub>1</sub> is a vector of other exogenous variables that affect the location of the IS curve (exogenous influences on any component of spending) or the LM curve (exogenous influences on money demand). The real money supply has a positive effect on aggregate demand, as does real government spending (meaning that when the independent variable changes in one direction, aggregate demand changes in the same direction); the exogenous component of taxes has a negative effect on it. ==Aggregate supply curve== {{main|Aggregate supply}} The aggregate supply curve
