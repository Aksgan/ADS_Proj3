However, the artificial heart is not a major part of his identity and is seldom mentioned, so that most viewers would not consider him a cyborg. He was also at one point briefly conscripted into the Borg (see above). *A cyborg secret agent was featured in the "Fumble on the One" episode of ''[[Misfits of Science|The Misfits of Science]]''. *[[Jonas Venture Junior]] from ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'' *[[Master Billy Quizboy]] from ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'' *[[Mr. Freeze]] from ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' *[[Curt Conners]] from ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' *The [[Jokerz]] from ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' *Gadget Boy from ''[[Gadget Boy & Heather]]'' *Morticon from ''[[Power Rangers: Mystic Force]]'' *[[Adam (Buffyverse)|Adam]] in the series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', who is part human, part demon and part robot. *In ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion franchise|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' the [[Evangelion (mecha)|Evangelion]] [[mecha]] are not robots but clones of aliens outfitted with cybernetics to allow their human pilots (or a backup computer, as in the Mass Production Eva series) to control them. *[[Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist#Edward Elric|Edward Elric]] (anime series and manga ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist]]'') has two prosthetic limbs - the right arm and the left leg - the technology used to create them is called ''[[automail]]''.

In the "Nip/Duck" episode an [[X-ray]] reveals that the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] cat is mostly mechanical, apart from his two [[brain]]s and his three [[lungs]]; it's not clear if his paws are mechanical or not, but they probably are since Mr. Kat has a lot of robotic gadgets inside his hands. * [[Jeremiah Gottwald]], a character in the anime series ''[[Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion]]'', is enhanced with extensive cybernetics after being grievously wounded in battle.
