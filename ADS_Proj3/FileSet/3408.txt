same single mechanism for ''both'' virtual memory and [[cache|disk caching]]. A page may be then transferred to or from ''any'' ordinary disk file, not necessarily a dedicated space. ''Page in'' is transferring a page from the disk to RAM. ''Page out'' is transferring a page from RAM to the disk. ''Swap in'' and ''out'' only refer to transferring pages between RAM and dedicated ''swap space'' or ''swap file'', and not any other place on disk. On [[Windows NT]] based systems, dedicated swap space is known as a page file and paging/swapping are often used interchangeably. ==Implementations== ===Ferranti Atlas=== The first computer to support paging was the [[Atlas Computer (Manchester)|Atlas]],<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Sumner | first1 = F.

Microsoft introduced virtual memory in response to the failures of [[Windows 1.0]] and [[Windows 2.0]], attempting to slash resource requirements for the operating system. Confusion abounds about Microsoft's decision to refer to the swap file as "virtual memory". Novices unfamiliar with the concept accept this definition without question, and speak of adjusting Windows' virtual memory size. In fact ''every'' process has a fixed, unchangeable virtual memory size, usually 2 [[gigabyte|GB]]. The user has only an option to change disk capacity dedicated to paging. Windows 3.x creates a [[hidden file]] named <tt>386SPART.PAR</tt> or <tt>WIN386.SWP</tt> for use as a swap file. It is generally found in the [[root directory]], but it may appear elsewhere (typically in the WINDOWS directory). Its size depends on how much swap space the system has (a setting selected by the user under [[Windows Control Panel|Control Panel]] → Enhanced under "Virtual Memory".) If the user moves or deletes this file, a [[Blue Screen of Death|blue screen]] will appear the next time Windows is started, with the [[error message]] "The permanent swap file is corrupt". The user will be prompted to choose whether or not to delete the file (whether or not it exists). [[Windows 95]], [[Windows 98]] and [[Windows Me]] use a similar file, and the settings for it are located under Control Panel → System → Performance tab → Virtual Memory. Windows automatically sets the size of the page file to start at 1.5&times; the size of physical memory, and expand up to 3&times; physical memory if necessary. If a user runs memory-intensive applications on a system with low physical memory, it is preferable to manually set these sizes to a value higher than default. ===Windows NT=== In NT-based versions of Windows (such as [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Vista]], and [[Windows 7]]), the file used for
