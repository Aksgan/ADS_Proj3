"Data Visualization and Infographics"] in: ''Graphics'', Monday Inspiration, January 14th, 2008.</ref> Data visualization is closely related to [[Information graphics]], [[Information visualization]], [[Scientific visualization]] and [[Statistical graphics]]. In the new millennium data visualization has become active area of research, teaching and development. According to Post et al (2002) it has united the field of scientific and information visualization".<ref name= "FHP02">Frits H. Post, Gregory M. Nielson and Georges-Pierre Bonneau (2002). [http://visualisation.tudelft.nl/publications/post2003b.pdf ''Data Visualization: The State of the Art''. Research paper TU delft, 2002.].</ref> KPI Library has developed the “Periodic Table of Visualization Methods”, an interactive chart displaying various different data visualization methods [http://www.visual-literacy.org/periodic_table/periodic_table.html]. It details 6 types of data visualization methods: data, information, concept, strategy, metaphor and compound.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Data visualization strategies were recently used by the [[Barack Obama]] administration as a way to enhance and broaden the support of his campaign. The "Road to Recovery" visualization became famous by showing US job loss figures between December 2007 and January 2010. This enabled people to compare the number of jobs lost during President Obama’s first year in office with the number of jobs lost during President Bush’s last year in office.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} == Data visualization scope == There are different approaches on the scope of data visualization. One common focus is on information presentation such as Friedman (2008) presented it. On this way Friendly (2008) presumes two main parts of data visualization: [[statistical graphics]], and [[Thematic map|thematic cartography]].<ref name = "MF08"/> In this line the "Data Visualization: Modern Approaches" (2007) article gives an overview of seven subjects of data visualization:<ref>[http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/08/02/data-visualization-modern-approaches/ "Data Visualization: Modern Approaches"]. in: ''Graphics'', August 2nd, 2007</ref> * [[Mindmap]]s * Displaying [[news]] * Displaying [[data]] * Displaying [[connections]] * Displaying [[website]]s * [[Article (publishing)|Articles]] & [[resources]] * Tools and services All these subjects are all close related to [[graphic design]] and information representation. <!-- This is hardly a reliable source and this list should maybe be moved to Information graphics --> On the other hand, from a [[computer science]] perspective, Frits H. Post (2002) categorized the field into a number of sub-fields:<ref name= "FHP02">Frits H. Post, Gregory M. Nielson and Georges-Pierre Bonneau (2002). [http://visualisation.tudelft.nl/publications/post2003b.pdf ''Data Visualization: The State of the Art''].</ref> * Visualization [[algorithm]]s and techniques * [[Volume visualization]] * [[Information visualization]] * Multiresolution methods * Modelling techniques and * [[Interaction techniques]] and architectures == Related fields == === Data acquisition === [[Data acquisition]] is the sampling of the real world to generate data that can be manipulated by a computer. Sometimes abbreviated '''DAQ''' or '''DAS''', data acquisition typically involves acquisition of signals and waveforms and processing the signals to obtain desired information. The components of data acquisition systems include appropriate sensors that convert any measurement parameter to an electrical signal, which is acquired by data acquisition hardware. === Data analysis === [[Data analysis]] is the process of looking at and summarizing [[data]] with the intent to extract useful [[information]] and develop conclusions. Data analysis is closely related to [[data mining]], but data mining tends to focus on larger data sets, with less emphasis on making [[inference]], and often uses data that was originally collected for a different purpose. In [[statistics|statistical applications]], some people divide data analysis into [[descriptive statistics]], [[exploratory data analysis]] and [[inferential statistics]] (or [[confirmatory data analysis]]), where the EDA focuses on discovering new features in the data, and CDA on confirming or falsifying existing hypotheses. Types of data analysis are: * [[Exploratory data analysis]] (EDA): an approach to analyzing data for the purpose of formulating [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] worth testing, complementing the tools of conventional [[statistics]] for testing hypotheses. It was so named by [[John Tukey]]. * [[Qualitative data analysis]] (QDA) or [[qualitative research]] is the analysis of non-numerical data, for example words, photographs, observations, etc.. === Data governance === This is very useful information for DM Seminars. [[Data governance]] encompasses the people, processes and technology required to create a consistent, enterprise view of an organisation's data in order to: * Increase consistency & confidence in decision making * Decrease the risk of regulatory fines * Improve data security * Maximize the income generation potential of data * Designate accountability for information quality === Data management === [[Data management]] comprises all the academic disciplines related to managing [[data]] as a valuable resource. The official definition provided by [[DAMA]] is that "Data Resource Management is the development and execution of architectures, policies, practices and procedures that properly manage the full data lifecycle needs of an enterprise." This definition is fairly broad and encompasses a number of professions which may not have direct technical contact with lower-level aspects of data management, such as [[relational database]] management. === Data mining === [[Data mining]] is the process of [[sorting]] through large amounts of data and picking out relevant information. It is usually used by [[business intelligence]] organizations, and [[financial analyst]]s, but is increasingly being used in the sciences to extract information from the enormous [[data set]]s generated by modern experimental and observational methods. It has been described as "the nontrivial extraction of implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful [[information]] from [[data]]"<ref>{{cite journal |author=W. Frawley and G.
