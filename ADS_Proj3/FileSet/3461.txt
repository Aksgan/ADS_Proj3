Sotropians believe that advances in social networking will drastically change the way humans interact and coexist. Sotropianism was originally produced at [[Tim O'Reilly]]'s [[Foo Camp]], on June 26, 2010, during which time the small group of 12 Foo Campers including [[Jodee Rich]], Roger Magoulas, Nancy, Charlene Li, Joe Klout and Anima met and brainstormed the concept of “Humans in 2040...After 35 years of [[Social Networking]]”, asking the question of how we as individuals will be different in 30 years as a result of social networking technology. == References == {{reflist}} == External links == *[http://www.peoplebrowsr.com PeopleBrowsr] *[http://www.research.ly ReSearch.ly] <!--- Categories ---> {{DEFAULTSORT:Peoplebrowsr}} [[Category:Articles created via the Article Wizard]] [[Category:Social media]] [[Category:Social information processing]] [[Category:Internet properties established in 2006]]</text> </page> <page> <id>28778</id> <title>People For Internet Responsibility</title> <text>The '''People For Internet Responsibility (PFIR)''' is a global, [[ad hoc]] network of individuals concerned about the operations, development, management, and regulation of the [[Internet]] in responsible ways, co-founded by [[Lauren Weinstein (technology expert)|Lauren Weinstein]] and [[Peter G.

It is often used as a quantitative indicator of [[quality assurance]] and [[quality control]] for repeated measurements where the outcome is expected to be the same. The general requirement for selecting two values to be compared is that the user of this technique expects the two values to be numerically equivalent. In other words, obtaining a [[percent]] [[difference]] of 0% is the optimum result as it explains that the two values are exactly the same.
