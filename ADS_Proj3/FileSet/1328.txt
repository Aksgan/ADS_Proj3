can read/save its configuration/state using a consistent [[Application programming interface|API]]. Being a common infrastructure, it also lets other applications be aware of this application configurations, leveraging easy software integration. It is designed to be lightweight, with no dependencies, ready to be used also by early boot stage programs. Using Elektra, configuration file's syntax and handling will not be a rework for each software. Elektra lets [[system administrator]]s control security in a more fine grained manner. With the current flat file paradigm it is impossible to control permissions and access times on each of the <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> or <tt>/etc/shadow</tt> atoms. Elektra lets you do that because each information atom stored in it (key) has a unique name (key name) and access properties. The first name for the Elektra Initiative was the '''Linux Registry Project''', which caused [[controversy]] due to its similarities to the [[Windows registry]]. The mains concepts, documentation, architecture and implementation of the Elektra Initiative was created by [[Avi Alkalay]]. ==Backends== *[[file system]] *[[Berkeley DB]] *[[GConf]] ([[XML]]) ==See also== {{Portal|Free software}} *[[Portland Project]] *[[Windows registry]] ==External links== * [http://www.libelektra.org/ The Elektra Initiative website (libelektra)] * [http://elektra.sourceforge.net/presentation/elektra.html Elektra Initiative presentation] * [https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/registry-list Mailing list] [[Category:Linux]] [[de:Elektra (Software)]] [[fr:Elektra (registre linux)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>11955</id> <title>Elfwood</title> <text>{{Infobox Website | name = Elfwood | logo = [[Image:Elfwoodlogopngsmall.png]] | screenshot = <!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Elfwoodscreenshot2006small.png]] --> | caption = Elfwood Main Page {{deletable image-caption}} | url = http://www.elfwood.com/ | commercial = Mixed | type = Artistic community | registration = Yes | owner = Thomas F Abrahamsson | author = Thomas F Abrahamsson | launch date = May 1, 1996 | current status = Active | revenue = | alexa = 25,869<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/elfwood.com |title=Elfwood.com Site Info |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Alexa |accessdate=August 15, 2010}}</ref> }} '''Elfwood''' is a popular web-based alternative [[art gallery]] and [[online community]] devoted to original [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] art and [[writing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.killerstartups.com/Web20/elfwood-com-fantasy-art-community |title=Elfwood.com - Fantasy Art Community &#124; Visit elfwood.com |publisher=Killerstartups.com |date= |accessdate=August 16, 2010}}</ref><ref name=CrystalRupp10Nov04>Rupp, Crystal.

Hall, Blake Stimson, Lisa Tamiris Becker}}</ref> ==History== ===Early years=== Elfwood was originally founded on May 1, 1996, by Thomas Abrahamsson, under the name of the "Lothlorien" project and was aimed at amateur high-fantasy artists.<ref name=gamegrene297/> The site was hosted by the academic computer club [[Lysator]] of [[Linköping University]] in [[Sweden]].<ref name=gamegrene297/><ref>http://madman.the90s.ww.freebase.com/view/en/lysator</ref><ref>http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UW55K0BV8II1</ref> At the time, its gallery consisted of three artists (including Abrahamsson), and all submissions and updates to the site were managed directly by Abrahamsson, with the individual users e-mailing Abrahamsson with their requested submissions or changes. As the Lothlorien membership and gallery expanded, Abrahamsson developed the site's [[extranet]] in August 1997,<ref name=gamegrene297/> allowing Elfwood members to manage their own individual art galleries and account information directly, without requiring webmaster assistance. After a while, "Zone 47" was created for sci-fi and modern fantasy art, and two years later the "Wyvern's Library" was created for written science fiction and fantasy submissions. A few months later, '''FARP''' ('''F'''antasy '''A'''rt '''R'''esource '''P'''roject) was created. In April 2000 the '''ERB''' ('''E'''lfwood '''R'''eview '''B'''oard) was founded; it is responsible for maintaining the rules on Elfwood. ===Temporary closing=== In June 2001, Elfwood was closed due to death threats and reopened a month later.<ref name=gamegrene297/> In July the FanQuarter area was opened. At the end of 2001 changes to Elfwood were put on hold so a more manageable system could be created. Elfwood was reopened in February 2002 with a new moderating system.<ref name=gamegrene297/> After that, every update has had to go through the Elfwood moderators. Along with the new moderating system came Mod's Choice awards. These awards are designated by a star on the thumbnail and an icon of a phoenix feather on the page of the artwork. Each day's Mod's Choice awards can be found on the Elfwood homepage. In January 2004 the sections known as Zone 47 and Lothlorien followed suit with the Wyvern's Library, merging to create the current SF&F Art area. Along with the change came a new layout for the whole site, as well as revisions to the rules. In November of that year, Elfwood artist Paul Cameron Bennett was charged in [[League City, Texas]] for [[kidnapping]] a 14-year-old girl, Margaret “Katy” Catherine Wilkerson, who he met through a chat-room linked through Elfwood.<ref>TJ Aulds.

All data was lost and the last backup was from February. The site came back with a timewarp to February and the rules were again revised and rewritten.{{Citation needed|reason=Is this a real crash, or not? sources are unclear whether it was a joke|date=August 2010}} Elfwood celebrated its 10th anniversary in May 2006, and to commemorate this anniversary, the [[Opus Fantasy Arts Festival]] held the very first Elfwood summit in conjunction with the festival. A guest writer and guest artist was featured at the summit.{{Citation needed|reason=Two people, guest artist and write, or one person who is both artist and writer?|date=August 2010}} ===Commercialization and afterwards=== After 11 years as an [[amateur]] website, Elfwood was transformed into a commercial community in September 2007,<ref name=SliceofSciFi090508>Sloan, Sam.

Founder Thomas Abrahamsson said, "Cost for hosting and servers had become too high to handle as a hobby project."<ref name=SliceofSciFi090508/> With this came the move of the servers from Linköping University. Before the move, Abrahamsson was frequently physically unable to access the servers to maintain the site due to their former
