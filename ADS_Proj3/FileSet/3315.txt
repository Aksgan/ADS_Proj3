Graphite, the font developer has to encapsulate all that expertise in the font. This means that AAT and Graphite can handle any arbitrary language, but that it requires more work and expertise from the font developers. On the other hand, OpenType fonts are easier to make, but can only support [[complex text layout]] if the application or operating system knows how to handle them. Prior to supporting OpenType, Adobe promoted [[multiple master fonts]] and [[expert fonts]] for high-end typography. Multiple master fonts lacked the controls for alternate glyphs and languages provided by OpenType, but provided smooth transitions between styles within a type family. Expert fonts were intended as supplementary fonts, such that all the special characters that had no place in the [[Adobe Standard Encoding]] character set – ligatures, fractions, small capitals, etc. – were placed in the expert font instead. Usage in applications was tricky, with, for example, typing a ''Z'' causing the ''ffl'' ligature to be generated. In modern OpenType fonts all these glyphs are encoded with their Unicode indices and selection method (i.e. under what circumstances that glyph should be used). ==OpenType support== ===Basic Roman support=== OpenType support may be divided into several categories.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Virtually all applications and most modern operating systems have basic Roman support and work with OpenType fonts just as well as other, older formats. What is of particular interest apart from basic Roman support is: extended language support through [[Unicode]], support for "complex" writing scripts such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indic languages]], and advanced typographic support for [[Latin alphabet|Latin script]] languages such as [[English language|English]]. Amongst Microsoft's operating systems, OpenType TT fonts (.TTF) are backward compatible and therefore supported by all [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] versions starting with Windows 3.1. OpenType PS fonts (.OTF) are supported in all Windows versions starting with [[Windows 2000]]; [[Adobe Type Manager]] is required to be installed on Windows 95/98/NT/Me for basic Roman support (only) of OpenType PS fonts. ===Extended language support=== Extended language support via [[Unicode]] for both OpenType and TrueType is present in most Windows applications (including [[Microsoft Office Publisher]], most [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] applications, and Microsoft Office 2003, though not Word 2002), CorelDRAW X3 and newer, and many Mac OS X applications, including Apple's own such as [[TextEdit]], [[Apple Pages|Pages]] and [[Keynote (presentation creation software)|Keynote]]. It is also widely supported in free operating systems, such as GNU/Linux (e.g. in multiplatform applications like [[Abiword]], [[Gnumeric]], [[KOffice]], [[Scribus]], [[OpenOffice.org]] 3.2 and later versions<ref>{{cite web |url=http://qa.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=78858 |title=OpenOffice Supports OpenType Fonts ... |accessdate=201-02-03}}</ref>, etc.). OpenType support for [[complex script|complex written scripts]] has so far mainly appeared in Microsoft applications in [[Microsoft Office]], such as [[Microsoft Word]] and [[Microsoft Publisher]]. [[Adobe InDesign]] provides extensive OpenType capability in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] but does not directly support Middle Eastern or [[Brahmic family|Indic scripts]]— though a separate version of InDesign is available that supports Middle Eastern scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew. Undocumented functionality in many Adobe Creative Suite 4 applications, including InDesign, Photoshop and Illustrator, enables Middle Eastern, Indic and other languages, but is not officially supported by Adobe, and requires third-party plug-ins to provide a user interface for the features. ===Advanced typography=== Advanced typographic support for Latin script languages first appeared in Adobe applications such as [[Adobe InDesign]], [[Adobe Photoshop]] and [[Adobe Illustrator]]. [[QuarkXPress]] 6.5 and below ([[Quark, Inc.]]) were not [[Unicode]] compliant. Hence text that contains anything other than [[Code page#Windows (ANSI) code pages|WinANSI]]/[[Mac OS Roman|MacRoman]] characters will not display correctly in an OpenType font (nor in other Unicode font formats, for that matter). However, Quark offers support similar to Adobe's in QuarkXPress 7, which shipped in May 2006. Corel's [[CorelDRAW]] does not support OpenType typographic features, either. [[Mellel]], a Mac OS X-only word processor from Redlers, claims parity in typographic features with InDesign, but also extends the support to right-to-left scripts; so does the [[Classical Text Editor]], a specialized word processor developed at the Austrian Academy of Sciences. {{As of|2009}}, popular Windows word processors do not support advanced OpenType typography features. Advanced typography features are implemented only in high-end [[desktop publishing]] software. However, the text engine from [[Windows Presentation Foundation]], which is a [[managed code]] implementation of OpenType is the first Windows [[Application Programming Interface|API]] to expose OpenType features to software developers, supporting both OpenType [[TrueType]], and OpenType CFF ([[Compact Font Format]]) fonts. It supports advanced typographic features such as [[Typographical ligature|ligatures]], [[Text figures|old-style numerals]], [[swash (typography)|swash]] variants, [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]], [[superscript]] and [[subscript]], [[small caps|small capitalization]], [[Font substitution|glyph substitution]], multiple [[baseline (typography)|baselines]], contextual and stylistic alternate character forms, [[kerning]], line-level [[justification (typesetting)|justification]], [[ruby character]]s etc. WPF applications automatically gain support for advanced typography features. OpenType ligatures are accessible in [[Microsoft Word#Word 2010|Microsoft Office Word 2010]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orzeszek.org/blog/2009/05/17/how-to-enable-opentype-ligatures-in-word-2010/ |title=How to Enable OpenType Ligatures in Word 2010 |publisher=Orzeszek.org |date= |accessdate=2009-11-11}}</ref> Windows 7 introduced [[DirectWrite]], a hardware accelerated [[native code|native]] [[DirectX]] API for text rendering with support for multi-format text, resolution-independent outline fonts, [[ClearType]], advanced OpenType typography features, full Unicode text, layout and language support and low-level glyph rendering APIs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Win7DeveloperGuide/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=1702 |title=Windows 7 Developer's Guide |publisher=Code.msdn.microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-11}}</ref> On Mac OS X, [[Apple Advanced Typography|AAT]]-supporting applications running on [[Mac OS X 10.4]] and later, including TextEdit and Keynote, get considerable OpenType support. Apple's support for OpenType in Mac OS X 10.4 included most advanced typographic features necessary for [[Latin script]] languages, such as [[small caps]], [[oldstyle figures]], and various sorts of ligatures. It did not yet support contextual alternates, positional forms, nor glyph reordering as handled by Microsoft's Uniscribe library on Windows. Thus, Mac OS X 10.4 did not offer support for Arabic or Indic scripts via OpenType (though such scripts are fully supported by existing AAT fonts). [[Mac OS X 10.5]] has improved support for OpenType and supports Arabic OpenType fonts. Bitstream [[Panorama (Layout Engine)|Panorama]], a line layout and text composition engine from [[Bitstream Inc.]], provides complete OpenType support for compact and standard Asian fonts, Arabic, Hebrew, Indic, Thai and over 50 other worldwide languages. The application supports key OpenType tables required for line layout, such as BASE, glyph definition (GDEF), glyph
