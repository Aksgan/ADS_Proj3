given in this form (a dash and then a letter or word), they are more often called ''flags'' - as in '''compiler flags'''.

However, with the increasingly widespread use of software from the [[GNU Project]], particularly in the [[Linux]] operating system, GNU's '''long options''' are also widely used. == See also == * [[getopt]] * [[getopts]] * [[Command-line argument parsing]] == External links == * [http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/xbd_chap12.html#tag_12_01c Utility Argument Syntax] of the standard utilities and introduces terminology used throughout IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.

It is the analog of <code>[[COMMAND.COM]]</code> in [[MS-DOS]] and [[Windows 9x]] (where it is called MS-DOS Prompt) systems, or of the [[Unix shell]]s used on [[Unix-like]] systems. == Versions == Therese Stowell developed the initial version of <code>cmd.exe</code> for Windows NT.<ref>{{cite book |title=Showstopper! The Breakneck Race to Create Windows NT and the Next Generation at Microsoft |first=G. Pascal |last=Zachary | year=1994 |publisher=Warner Books |isbn=0-02-935671-7}}</ref> Although some old DOS commands are unsupported or have been changed (ex: the functionality of <code>[[deltree]]</code> was rolled into <code>[[rmdir|rd]]</code> in the form of the /s parameter), <code>cmd.exe</code> still has a greater number of [[Shell builtin|built-in commands]]. Both the OS/2 and the Windows NT versions of <code>cmd.exe</code> have more detailed error messages than the blanket "Bad command or file name" (in the case of malformed commands) of command.com. In the OS/2 version of <code>cmd.exe</code>, errors are reported in the current language of the system, their text being taken from the system message files. The '''help''' command can then be issued with the error message number to obtain further information. <code>cmd.exe</code> remains part of [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows Server 2008]], and [[Windows 7]]. == Technical information == Unlike <code>[[COMMAND.COM]]</code>, which is a [[DOS]] program, <code>cmd.exe</code> is a native program for the platform. This allows it to take advantage of features available to native programs on the platform that are otherwise unavailable to DOS programs. For example, since <code>cmd.exe</code> is a native text-mode application on [[OS/2]], it can use real [[Pipeline (Unix)|pipes]] in command pipelines, allowing both sides of the pipeline to run concurrently. As a result, it is possible to redirect the standard error in <code>cmd.exe</code>, unlike <code>COMMAND.COM</code>. (<code>COMMAND.COM</code> uses temporary files, and runs the two sides serially, one after the other.) In reality, <code>cmd.exe</code> is a Windows program that acts as a DOS-like command line interpreter. It is generally compatible, but provides extensions which address the limitations of <code>COMMAND.COM</code>: * <code>SETLOCAL</code>/<code>ENDLOCAL</code> commands limit the scope of changes to the environment * internal <code>CALL</code> and <code>GOTO</code> labels lessen the need for individual batch files to perform parts of a task. * filename-parsing extensions to the <code>SET</code> command are comparable to [[C shell]]. * an expression-evaluation extensions is also provided in the <code>SET</code> command. * an expansion of the <code>FOR</code> command to support parsing files and arbitrary sets in addition to filenames. * use of arrow keys to scroll through command history (provided by <code>[[DOSKey]]</code> in <code>COMMAND.COM</code>) * off-by-default path completion capabilities similar to <code>bash</code> [[tab completion]] * a [[Directory (file systems)|directory]] stack accessible with the <code>[[pushd and popd|PUSHD]]</code> and <code>[[pushd and popd|POPD]]</code> commands * <code>IF</code> can perform [[Case sensitivity|case-insensitive]] comparisons and numeric equality and inequality comparisons in addition to case-sensitive string comparisons * the ability to [[escape character|escape]] reserved characters by using the [[caret]] character (<code>^</code>) <!-- Output of CMD.EXE's help text, as regards Command Extensions: The command extensions involve changes and/or additions to the following commands: DEL or ERASE COLOR CD or CHDIR MD or MKDIR PROMPT PUSHD POPD SET SETLOCAL ENDLOCAL IF FOR CALL SHIFT GOTO START (also includes changes to external command invocation) ASSOC FTYPE TIME ECHO (Used mainly in batch files) PAUSE To get specific details, type commandname /? to view the specifics. --> The extensions can be disabled, providing a stricter compatibility mode. == See also == * [[Comparison of computer shells]] * [[List of DOS commands]] == References == {{reflist|1}} == Further reading == * [http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/cmd.mspx?mfr=true MSDN Documentation for cmd.exe on Windows XP] * [http://www.dostips.com/DtTutoFunctions.php DOS Batch - CALL Functions and Recursion] * [http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/ Console], a Free front end with support for multiple tabs and other features. * [http://www.kapcom.com.au/Windows-CMD-Commands-CMD-Network-Commands.html Windows CMD Commands], Quick list of CMD commands {{Windows commands}} {{Windows Components}} [[Category:Windows components]] [[Category:Scripting languages]] [[Category:Command shells]] [[cs:Cmd.exe]] [[de:Cmd.exe]] [[es:Cmd (Windows)]] [[fr:Cmd.exe]] [[ko:Cmd.exe]] [[id:Command Prompt (Windows)]] [[it:Cmd.exe]] [[ja:Cmd.exe]] [[pl:Cmd.exe]] [[pt:Prompt de Comando]] [[ro:Cmd.exe]] [[ru:Cmd.exe]] [[fi:CMD.EXE]] [[sv:Cmd.exe]] [[zh:Cmd.exe]]</text> </page> <page> <id>6969</id> <title>Comment (computer programming)</title> <text>:''For comments in Wikipedia markup, see [[Help:Wiki markup#Character formatting]] and [[WP:COMMENT]].''
