Keen's 2007 book, [[Cult of the Amateur]], argues that the core assumption of Web 2.0, that all opinions and user-generated content are equally valuable and relevant, is misguided. Additionally, Sunday Times reviewer John Flintoff has characterized Web 2.0 as "creating an endless digital forest of mediocrity: uninformed political commentary, unseemly home videos, embarrassingly amateurish music, unreadable poems, essays and novels", and also asserted that [[Wikipedia]] is full of "mistakes, half truths and misunderstandings".<ref>{{cite news |title= Thinking is so over|url=http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/personal_tech/article1874668.ece | location=London | work=The Times | first=JohnPaul | last=Flintoff | date=2007-06-03}}</ref> ==Trademark== In November 2004, [[CMP Media]] applied to the [[USPTO]] for a [[service mark]] on the use of the term "WEB 2.0" for live events.<ref name="uspto">[http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=78322306 USPTO serial number 78322306]</ref> On the basis of this application, CMP Media sent a [[cease and desist|cease-and-desist]] demand to the Irish non-profit organization [[IT@Cork]] on May 24, 2006,<ref>{{cite web |title=O'Reilly and CMP Exercise Trademark on 'Web 2.0' |work=Slashdot |url=http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/05/26/1238245 |date=2006-05-26 |accessdate=2006-05-27 }}</ref> but retracted it two days later.<ref>{{cite web | title=O'Reilly's coverage of Web 2.0 as a service mark | work=O'Reilly Radar | url=http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/05/more_on_our_web_20_service_mar.html | author=Nathan Torkington | date=2006-05-26 | accessdate=2006-06-01 }}</ref> The "WEB 2.0" service mark registration passed final PTO Examining Attorney review on May 10, 2006, and was registered on June 27, 2006.<ref name="uspto"/> The [[European Union]] application (application number 004972212, which would confer unambiguous status in Ireland) was [http://oami.europa.eu/CTMOnline/RequestManager/en_Result?transition=ResultsDetailed&ntmark=&application=CTMOnline&bAdvanced=0&language=en&deno=&source=search_basic.jsp&idappli=004972212# refused] on May 23, 2007. ==Web 3.0== {{See also|Semantic Web}} <!-- FYI: [[Web 3.0]] redirects to here via #Redirect[[Web 2.0#Web 3.0]] . --> Definitions of Web 3.0 vary greatly. Amit Agrawal states that Web 3.0 is, among other things, about the [[Semantic Web]] and [[personalization]].<ref>Agarwal, Amit. "Web 3.0 concepts explained in plain English". [http://www.labnol.org/internet/web-3-concepts-explained/8908/ Labnol.org]</ref> Focusing on the computer elements, [[Conrad Wolfram]] has argued that Web 3.0 is where "the computer is generating new information", rather than humans.<ref>[http://www.itpro.co.uk/621535/q-a-conrad-wolfram-on-communicating-with-apps-in-web-3-0 Conrad Wolfram on Communicating with apps in web 3.0] IT PRO, 17 Mar 2010</ref> Andrew Keen, author of ''The Cult of the Amateur'', considers the Semantic Web an "unrealisable abstraction" and sees Web 3.0 as the return of experts and authorities to the Web. For example, he points to Bertelsmann's deal with the [[German Wikipedia]] to produce an edited print version of that encyclopedia. [[CNN Money]]'s Jessi Hempel expects Web 3.0 to emerge from new and innovative Web 2.0 services with a profitable business model.<ref>Hempel, Jessi. "Web 2.0 is so over. Welcome to Web 3.0."

"Web 1.0 + Web 2.0 = Web 3.0."

"Metaverse Roadmap: Pathways to the 3D Web."]</ref> echoes Sharma's perspective, defining Web 3.0 as the first-generation [[Metaverse]] (convergence of the virtual and physical world), a web development layer that includes TV-quality open video, 3D simulations, augmented reality, human-constructed semantic standards, and pervasive broadband, wireless, and sensors. Web 3.0's early geosocial (Foursquare, etc.) and augmented reality (Layar, etc.) webs are an extension of Web 2.0's participatory technologies and social networks (Facebook, etc.) into 3D space. Of all its metaverse-like developments, Smart suggests Web 3.0's most defining characteristic will be the mass diffusion of NTSC-or-better quality [http://openvideoalliance.org/about/?l=en open video] to TVs, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices, a time when "the internet swallows the television."<ref>Smart, John. 2010. "The Television Will Be Revolutionized: The iPad, Internet TV, and Web 3.0."[http://www.accelerating.org/articles/televisionwillberevolutionized.html]</ref> Smart considers Web 4.0 to be the [[Semantic Web]] and in particular, the rise of statistical, machine-constructed semantic tags and algorithms, driven by broad collective use of conversational interfaces, perhaps circa 2020.<ref>[http://www.accelerationwatch.com/lui.html Smart, John. 2003. "The Conversational Interface."]</ref> David Siegel's perspective in ''Pull: The Power of the Semantic Web'', 2009, is consonant with this, proposing that the growth of human-constructed semantic standards and data will be a slow, industry-specific incremental process for years to come, perhaps unlikely to tip into broad social utility until after 2020. ==See also== {{Wikiversity}} * [[Cloud computing]] * [[Collective intelligence]] * [[Consumer generated media|Consumer-generated media]] * [[Enterprise social software]] * [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|Mashups]] * [[New Media]] * [[Office suite]] * [[Open Mashup Alliance]] * [[Open source governance]] * [[Radical Trust]] * [[Social commerce]] * [[Social media]] * [[Social shopping]] * [[User-generated content]] * [[Web 1.0]] * [[Web 2.0 for development]] ([[web2fordev]]) * [[You (Time Person of the Year)]] ; Application Domains * [[Sci-Mate]] * [[Business 2.0]] * [[E-learning#E-Learning 2.0|E-learning 2.0]] * [[Government 2.0]] * [[Health 2.0]] *
