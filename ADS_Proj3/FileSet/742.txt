Accordingly to [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]], Clube do Hardware is the 98th most accessed website in Brazil{{ref|1}} and the 30th largest website in Portuguese in the World{{ref|2}}. Clube do Hardware publishes tutorials, articles and news about computer hardware and has a very active forum where users can discuss technology topics. It was created in 1996 by the hardware expert [[Gabriel Torres]], initially as a personal webpage on [[Geocities]] with the title "Hardware By Gabriel Torres" to announce the works from this professional. In 1997 the author registered the domain gabrieltorres.com with the website changing its name to "Hardware Site". The final name, Clube do Hardware, was adopted in 1999{{ref|3}}. Currently Clube do Hardware gets 3.7 million visitors per month and prints around 22 million monthly pageviews{{ref|4}}. These stats make Clube do Hardware bigger than several well-known international websites about PC hardware like [[Xbitlabs]], [[The Inquirer]], [[HardOCP]] and [[DailyTech]]. In order to manage such traffic Clube do Hardware uses an array of nine dedicated servers{{ref|5}}. == Notes == {{note|1}} http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&url=www.clubedohardware.com.br {{note|2}} http://www.alexa.com/site/ds/top_sites?ts_mode=lang&lang=pt {{note|3}} http://www.clubedohardware.com.br/artigos/227 {{note|4}} http://www.clubedohardware.com.br/pagina/estatisticas {{note|5}} http://www.clubedohardware.com.br/blog/196 ==External links== * [http://www.clubedohardware.com.br Clube do Hardware website] [[Category:Computing websites]] [[Category:Computer magazines]] [[Category:Internet forums]] [[pt:Clube do Hardware]]</text> </page> <page> <id>6595</id> <title>Cluster manager</title> <text>A '''Cluster manager''' usually is a backend GUI or command-line software that runs on one or all cluster nodes (in some cases it runs on a different server or cluster of management servers.) The cluster manager works together with a cluster management agent. These agents run on each node of the cluster to manage and configure services, a set of services, or to manage and configure the complete [[Cluster (computing)|cluster]] server itself (see [[super computing]].) In some cases the cluster manager is mostly used to dispatch work for the cluster (or [[cloud computing|cloud]]) to perform. In this last case a subset of the cluster manager can be a remote desktop application that is used not for configuration but just to send work and get back work results from a cluster. In other cases the cluster is more related to [[high availability|availability]] and [[load balancing]] than to computational or specific service clusters. ==Some [[Free and open source software]] solutions== * [[Linux-HA|Heartbeat]], from [[Linux-HA]] * [[IP_Virtual_Server|IPVS]], from [[Linux Virtual Server]] * Keepalived, [http://keepalived.sourceforge.net keepalived.sourceforge.net] * [[mysqlBind]], from [http://unixservice.com unixservice.com] * [[Nimbus_(cloud_computing)|Nimbus]], from [[Linux Labs]] * [[oneSIS]], from [http://onesis.org onesis.org] * Piranha, from [[Red Hat]] * [[Project Kusu]], from [[Platform Computing]] * Ultra Monkey, from [http://www.ultramonkey.org www.ultramonkey.org] * Surealived [http://surealived.sourceforge.net surealived.sf.net ] ==Some Proprietary solutions== * [http://www.uniclust.it/index.php/it/component/content/article/61.html UniClust Web Portal], from [http://www.uniclust.it UniClust HPC Solutions] * [[Microsoft Cluster Server|Cluster Server]], from [[Microsoft]] * [http://www.brightcomputing.com/Bright-Cluster-Manager.php Bright Cluster Manager], from [http://www.brightcomputing.com Bright Computing] ==See also== * [[Grid network|Hypercube]] ==Cluster Management Papers== * [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1153919.1154083&coll=&dl=acm&CFID=15151515&CFTOKEN=6184618 Adaptive Control of Extreme-scale Stream Processing Systems] Proceedings of the 26th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems. * [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1142522&dl=GUIDE&coll=GUIDE&CFID=15151515&CFTOKEN=6184618# Design, implementation, and evaluation of the linear road benchmark on the stream processing core] Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data. * [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cache/papers/cs/30567/http:zSzzSzwww.cs.huji.ac.ilzSz~feitzSzparschedzSzp-04-1.pdf/feitelson04parallel.pdf Parallel Job Scheduling A Status Report (2004)] 10th Workshop on Job Scheduling Strategies for Parallel Processing, New-York, NY, June 2004. * [http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/doc/condorg-hpdc10.pdf Condor-G: A Computation Management Agent for Multi-Institutional Grids] Springer Journal Cluster Computing Volume 5, Number 3 / July, 2002 * [http://www.zib.de/roeblitz/2003-roeblitz-cluster.pdf From clusters to the fabric: the job management perspective] Cluster Computing, 2003.

If there exists a way to solve a co-NP-complete problem quickly, then that algorithm can be used to solve all co-NP problems quickly. Each Co-NP-complete problem is the [[complement (complexity)|complement]] of an [[NP-complete]] problem. The two sets are either equal or disjoint. The latter is thought more likely, but this is not known. See [[co-NP]] and [[NP-complete]] for more details. Fortune showed in 1979 that if any [[sparse language]] is co-NP-complete (or even just co-NP-hard), then {{nowrap|[[P = NP problem|P = NP]]}},<ref>S. Fortune. A note on sparse complete sets.
