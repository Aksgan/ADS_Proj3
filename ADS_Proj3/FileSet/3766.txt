to define regular languages. If: * Σ is a finite alphabet, * Σ* denotes the [[free monoid]] over Σ consisting of all strings over Σ, * ''f'' : Σ* → ''M'' is a [[monoid homomorphism]] where ''M'' is a ''finite'' monoid, * ''S'' is a subset of ''M'' then the set <math>\{ f^{-1}(s) | s \in S \}</math> is regular. Every regular language arises in this fashion. If ''L'' is any subset of Σ*, one defines an [[equivalence relation]] ~ (called the [[syntactic relation]]) on Σ* as follows: ''u'' ~ ''v'' is defined to mean :''uw'' &isin; ''L'' if and only if ''vw'' &isin; ''L'' for all ''w'' &isin; &Sigma;* The language ''L'' is regular if and only if the number of equivalence classes of ~ is finite (A proof of this is provided in the article on the [[syntactic monoid]]). When a language is regular, then the number of equivalence classes is equal to the number of states of the [[minimal deterministic finite automaton]] accepting ''L''. A similar set of statements can be formulated for a monoid <math>M\subset\Sigma^*</math>. In this case, equivalence over ''M'' leads to the concept of a [[recognizable language]]. ==Finite languages == A specific subset within the class of regular languages is the finite languages – those containing only a finite number of words. These are regular languages, as one can create a [[regular expression]] that is the [[Union (set theory)|union]] of every word in the language. ==The number of words in a regular language== For any regular language <math>L</math> there exist constants <math>\lambda_1,\,\ldots,\,\lambda_k</math> and polynomials <math>p_1(x),\,\ldots,\,p_k(x)</math> such that for every <math>n</math> the number <math>s_L(n)</math> of words of length <math>n</math> in <math>L</math> satisfies the equation <math>s_L(n)=p_1(n)\lambda_1^n+\ldots+p_k(n)\lambda_k^n</math>. Thus, a non-regularity of some language <math>L'</math> can be proved by counting the words in <math>L'</math>. Consider, for example, the [[Dyck language]] of strings of balanced parentheses. The number of words of length <math>2n</math> in [[Dyck language]] equals to the [[Catalan number]] <math>C_n\sim\frac{4^n}{n^{3/2}\sqrt{\pi}}</math> which is not of the form <math>p(n)\lambda^n</math>, witnessing the non-regularity of [[Dyck language]]. ==See also== * [[Pumping lemma for regular languages]] * [[Union of two regular languages]] == References == {{Cleanup|date=December 2008}} {{Refbegin}} * {{cite book|author = [[Michael Sipser]] | year = 1997 | title = [[Introduction to the Theory of Computation]] | publisher = PWS Publishing | isbn = 0-534-94728-X}} Chapter 1: Regular Languages, pp.31&ndash;90.

A verb that cannot be conjugated like this is called an [[irregular verb]]. All [[natural language]]s, to different extents, have a number of irregular verbs. [[Auxiliary language]]s usually have a single regular pattern for all verbs (as well as other [[part of speech|parts of speech]]) as a matter of design. Other [[constructed language]]s need not show such regularity, especially if they are designed to look similar to natural ones. The most simple form of regularity involves a single class of verbs, a single principal part (the [[root (linguistics)|root]] or a conjugated form in a given person, number, tense, aspect, mood, etc.), and a set of unique rules to produce each form in the verb [[paradigm]]. More complex regular patterns may have several verb classes (e. g. distinguished by their infinitive ending), more than one principal part (e. g. the infinitive and the first person singular, present tense, indicative mood), and more than one type of rule (e. g. rules that add suffixes and other rules that change the vowel in the root). Sometimes it is highly subjective to state whether a verb is regular or not. For example, if a language has ten different conjugation patterns and two of them only comprise five or six verbs each while the rest are much more populated, it is a matter of choice to call the verbs in the smaller groups "irregular". The concept of regular and irregular verbs belongs mainly in the context of second language acquisition, where the defining of rules and listing of exceptions is an important part of foreign language learning. The concepts can also be useful in psycholinguistics, where the ways in which the human mind processes irregularities may be of interest. However, most other branches of linguistics do not use these categories; historical/comparative linguistics is more interested in categories such as strong and weak. ==Psycholinguistic aspects== Although the causes of irregular verbs are almost exclusively historical, the way we process them is a matter for [[synchronic analysis]], and in particular for [[psycholinguistics]]. A common error for [[language acquisition|small children]] is to conjugate irregular verbs as though they were regular. This is regarded as evidence that we learn and process our native language partly by the application of rules, rather than, as some earlier scholarship had postulated, solely by learning the forms. In fact, children often use the most common irregular verbs correctly in their earliest utterances but then switch to incorrect regular forms for a time when they begin to operate systematically. This allows a fairly precise analysis of the phases of this aspect of first language acquisition. {{lexical categories|state=collapsed}} [[Category:Verb types]] [[de:Regelmäßiges Verb]] [[is:Óregluleg sögn]] [[ja:規則動詞]] [[scn:Verbi rigulari]]</text> </page> <page> <id>31693</id> <title>Regulator (automatic control)</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}} In [[automatic control]], a '''regulator''' is a device which has the function of maintaining a designated characteristic.
