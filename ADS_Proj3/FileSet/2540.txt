Lingolook Flashcards for Foreign Travel are designed to help English-speaking travelers get by abroad in a flash. These language guides feature basic keywords travelers need—helpfully organized on “75+” electronic flashcards. These fully illustrated cards feature translations in extra large type, audio recordings by native speakers, and easy phonetics. Travelers just flash their iPhones or repeat the pronunciation to get a point across fast. Lingolook guides also contain destination-specific travel tips, menu readers and more. As of 2008, it published about 1 titles in 5 languages and sold more than 20000 copies. Lingolook Flashcards is headquartered in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] USA.

More than 10 different nationalities are presented in the Lingueo team. ==The service== Lingueo.com is a social network whose aim is to help its users to practice and learn foreign languages. The site connects people who wish to learn and practice foreign languages with suitable tutors all over the world. The courses are held directly on the website through videoconferences, and no software to install whatsoever. The fees vary depending on the tutor, the minimum fee being 10€/hour. No subscription is needed and a student is free to end the course at any time. Besides enabling direct contact, Lingueo offers a free access to a linguistic video library consisting of little video courses made by the tutors. This practical data bank aims at familiarizing a learner with everyday words and expressions. Lingueo offers a possibility to learn the most commonly spoken languages, and promotes the learning of regional languages as well as the [[French Sign Language|Sign Language]]. <ref>[http://www.france-handicap-info.com/en/articles/langue-des-signes.html France handicap info (in English)]</ref> In addition to linguistic learning, Lingueo promotes diversity and cultural exchange. More than 50 different languages are taught on Lingueo by almost 1000 tutors around the world. This effort has been recognized by the [[European Commission]], who rewarded Lingueo in the spring of 2009 with the European Language Label, which is a prize awarded to the most innovative language learning projects. <ref>[http://entrepreneurs.telecom-paristech.fr/incubes/lingueo-laureat-du-label-europeen-des-langues/ Telecom Paristech (in French)]</ref> ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.lingueo.com Lingueo homepage] * [http://www.crunchbase.com/company/Lingueo Lingueo on Crunchbase] * [http://www.killerstartups.com/Web20/lingueo-com-speak-like-me Lingueo on Killer Startups] [[Category:Social networking language education websites]] [[Category:Educational websites]] [[Category:Global internet community]] [[Category:Social network services]] [[es:Lingueo]] [[fr:Lingueo]] [[it:Lingueo]]</text> </page> <page> <id>21786</id> <title>Link-state routing protocol</title> <text>A '''link-state routing protocol''' is one of the two main classes of [[routing protocol]]s used in [[packet switching]] networks for [[computer communication]]s, the other major class being the [[distance-vector routing protocol]]. Examples of link-state routing protocols include [[OSPF]] and [[IS-IS]]. The link-state protocol is performed by every ''switching node'' in the network (i.e. nodes that are prepared to forward packets; in the [[Internet]], these are called [[router]]s). The basic concept of link-state routing is that every node constructs a ''map'' of the connectivity to the network, in the form of a [[graph theory|graph]], showing which nodes are connected to which other nodes. Each node then independently calculates the next best logical ''path'' from it to every possible destination in the network. The collection of best paths will then form the node's [[routing table]]. This contrasts with [[distance-vector routing protocol]]s, which works by having each node share its '''routing table''' with its neighbors. In a link-state protocol the only information passed between nodes is connectivity related. Link state algorithms are sometimes characterized by the ‘Each router tells the world about its neighbors’. ==History== What is believed to be the first adaptive routing network of computers, using link-state routing as its heart, was designed and implemented during 1976-77 by a team from Plessey Radar led by Bernard J Harris; the project was for "Wavell" - a system of computer command and control for the British Army. The first link-state routing concept was published in 1979 by [[John M. McQuillan]] (then at [[Bolt, Beranek and Newman]]) as a mechanism that would calculate routes more quickly when network conditions
