to 5" badge which is unlocked when someone checks into a venue categorized as Corporate/Business 15 times within 30 days. The badge explanation reads as "Looks like someone's filed 15 TPS reports in 30 days. Ummm... Yeeaahh... we're gonna need to go ahead and move you downstairs into Storage B." TPS reports are also mentioned by the character Khan in TV's The King of the Hill. == Notes == {{reflist}} ==External links== * [http://standards.ieee.org/reading/ieee/std_public/description/se/829-1998_desc.html IEEE 829-1998 - Standard for Software Test Documentation] {{DEFAULTSORT:Tps Report}} [[Category:Software testing]] [[Category:Pop-culture neologisms]] [[Category:Computer humor]] {{Compu-prog-stub}} {{culture-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>36710</id> <title>TRACKER Network UK</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=October 2007}} [[File:Tracker logo.png|frame|Tracker logo]] The '''TRACKER Network UK''' is a [[vehicle tracking system]] used for recovering stolen vehicles in the [[United Kingdom]]. The TRACKER's stolen vehicle recovery system is operated by all of the UK's 52 police forces<ref>{{cite web | title = Tracker Police | publisher = Tracker UK | url =http://www.tracker.co.uk/TRACKER/TrackerPolice.aspx }}</ref> <!-- Info from Tracker UK website, guessing this is a reliable source? -->. Police aircraft and several police vehicles in each force are fitted with police tracking computers, which pick up radio signals emitted from the stolen vehicle. Tracker network now offer various different models of Tracking unit to its private retail customers, the Tracker Retrieve, Tracker Monitor, Tracker Horizon and more recently the Tracker Response was added. The lead time for having a Tracker unit fitted is seven to ten working days. The Tracker Reporter is used for fleet vehicle tracking and users can look at where their vehicle is using the internet and by logging on to www.trackervam.co.uk. The Tracker Network office is located in [[Uxbridge]]. The average time that it takes the police to recover a TRACKER activated vehicle is just 4 and a half hours.<ref>{{cite web | title = Stolen Vehicle Recovery | publisher = Tracker UK | url = http://www.tracker.co.uk/SVR/Police.html }}</ref> <!-- Info from Tracker UK website, guessing this is a reliable source? --> == External links == * [http://www.tracker.co.uk/ Tracker.co.uk] <!-- Official Tracker UK website --> * [https://www.tracking-service.eu/vapour/vapour.dll Tracker website] <!-- a redirect from the one given in the running text --> ==References== <references /> {{Royal Bank of Scotland Group}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Tracker Network Uk}} [[Category:Automotive accessories]] [[Category:Road transport]] [[Category:Technology systems]] [[Category:Vehicle technology]] [[Category:Road transport in the United Kingdom]]</text> </page> <page> <id>36711</id> <title>TRADIC</title> <text>{{Infobox information appliance |name = TRADIC |image = <!-- include the [[file:]] tag --> |caption = <!-- include if image is not a logo --> |manufacturer = [[Bell Labs]] |type = |releasedate = {{Start date|1954|01}} |price = <!-- this is price at initial release, not the current price --> |connectivity = |lifespan = |unitssold = |media = |os = <!-- operating system --> |input = |camera = |power = |cpu = |storage = |memory = |display = |audio = |service = <!-- online service/s offered --> |dimensions = |weight = |touchpad = |predecessor= |successor = |related = }} The '''TRADIC''' (for '''TRA'''nsistor '''DI'''gital '''C'''omputer or '''TR'''ansistorized '''A'''irborne '''DI'''gital '''C'''omputer) was the first transistorized [[computer]] in the USA, completed in 1954.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Irvine | first = M.

The project initially examined the feasibility of constructing a transistorized airborne digital computer. A second application was a transistorized digital computer to be used in a Navy track-while-scan shipboard radar system. Several models were completed: TRADIC Phase One computer, Flyable TRADIC, Leprechaun (using [[junction transistor]]s in 1956) and XMH-3 TRADIC. TRADIC Phase One was developed to explore the feasibility, in the laboratory, of using transistors in a digital computer that could be used to solve aircraft bombing and navigation problems. Flyable TRADIC was used to establish the feasibility of using an airborne solid-state computer as the control element of a bombing and navigation system. Leprechaun was a second-generation laboratory research transistor digital computer designed to explore the capabilities of new solid-state devices for airborne computers. The TRADIC Phase One computer was completed in January 1954.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Irvine | first = M.

In the UK, the [[Manchester computers#Transistor Computer|Manchester University Transistor Computer]] demonstrated a working prototype in 1953 which incorporated transistors before TRADIC was operational, although that was not a fully transistorized computer because it used vacuum tubes to generate the clock signal. The 30 watts of power for the 1 MHz clock in the TRADIC was also supplied by a vacuum tube supply because no transistors were available that could supply that much power at that frequency. If the TRADIC can be called fully transistorized while incorporating vacuum tubes, then the Manchester University Transistor Computer should also be, in
