The module width (byte 8) divided by the number of bits per chip (byte 7) gives the number of chips per rank. That can then be multiplied by the per-chip capacity (byte 4) and the number of ranks of chips on the module (usually 1 or 2, from byte 7). ==Extensions== The JEDEC standard only specifies some of the SPD bytes. The truly critical data fits into the first 64 bytes,<ref name=spd_ddr>[http://www.jedec.org/download/search/4_01_02_04R13.PDF JEDEC Standard 21-C section 4.1.2.4] "SPDs for DDR SDRAM"</ref><ref name=spd_ddr2>[http://www.jedec.org/download/search/4_01_02_10R13.pdf JEDEC Standard 21-C section 4.1.2.10] "Specific SPDs for DDR2 SDRAM"</ref><ref name=spd_ddr3>[http://www.jedec.org/download/search/4_01_02_11R18.pdf JEDEC Standard 21-C section 4.1.2.11] "Serial Presence Detect (SPD) for DDR3 SDRAM Modules"</ref><ref name=spd_base>[http://www.jedec.org/download/search/4_01_02_00r9.pdf JEDEC Standard 21-C section 4.1.2] "SERIAL PRESENCE DETECT STANDARD, General Standard"</ref><ref name=spd_sdr>[http://www.jedec.org/download/search/4_01_02_05R12.PDF JEDEC Standard 21-C section 4.1.2.5] "Specific PDs for Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM)"</ref> while the some of the remainder is earmarked for manufacturer identification. However, a 256-byte EEPROM is generally provided. A number of uses have been made of the remaining space. ===Enhanced Performance Profiles (EPP)=== Memory generally comes with conservative timing recommendations in the SPD ROM, to ensure basic functionality on all systems. Enthusiasts often spend considerable time manually adjusting the memory timings for higher speed. Enhanced Performance Profiles is an extension of SPD, developed by [[NVIDIA]] and [[Corsair]], which includes additional information for higher-performance operation of [[DDR2 SDRAM]], including supply voltages and command timing information not included in the JEDEC SPD spec. The EPP information is stored in the same EEPROM, but in bytes 99-127 which are unused by standard DDR2 SPD.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.nvidia.com/content/epp/epp_specifications.pdf |title=DDR2 UDIMM Enhanced Performance Profiles Design Specification |publisher=[[NVIDIA]] |date=2006-05-12 |accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref> {|class=wikitable |+ EPP SPD ROM usage |- !

NVIDIA encourages support for EPP in the [[BIOS]] for its high-end motherboard chipsets. This is intended to provide "one-click [[overclocking]]" to get better performance with minimal effort. NVIDIA's name for EPP memory that has been qualified for performance and stability is "SLI-ready memory".<ref>http://www.nvidia.com/docs/CP/45121/sli_memory.pdf</ref> The term "SLI-ready-memory" has caused some confusion, as it has nothing to do with [[Scalable Link Interface|SLI video]]. One can use EPP/SLI memory with a single video card (even a non-NVIDIA card), and one can run a multi-card SLI video setup without EPP/SLI memory. An extended version, EPP 2.0, supports DDR3 memory as well.<ref>[http://www.nvidia.com/docs/IO/52280/NVIDIA_EPP2_TB.pdf Enhanced Performance Profiles 2.0] (pages 2–3)</ref> ===Extreme Memory Profile (XMP)=== A similar, [[Intel]]-developed JEDEC SPD extension for [[DDR3 SDRAM]] DIMMs. This uses bytes 176–255, which are unallocated by JEDEC, to encode higher-performance memory timings.<ref>[http://www.intel.com/assets/pdf/whitepaper/319124.pdf Intel Extreme Memory Profile (Intel XMP) DDR3 Technology]</ref> {|class=wikitable |+ XMP SPD ROM usage<ref name="xmp1.1">{{Citation |url=http://www.softnology.biz/pdf/IntelXMP_Rev1.1.pdf |title=Intel<sup>®</sup> Extreme Memory Profile (XMP) Specification, Rev 1.1 |date=October 2007 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}</ref> |- !

Most importantly, it contains a "medium timebase" value MTB, as a rational number of nanoseconds (common values are 1/8, 1/12 and 1/16 ns). Many other later timing values are expressed as an integer number of MTB units. Also included in the header is the number of DIMMS per memory channel that the profile is designed to support; including more DIMMS may not work well. {|class="wikitable" |+ XMP Header bytes<ref name="xmp1.1"/> |- !
