on the voyages of ships and their navigation as well as the carriage of cargo in ships." [Footnotes omitted.] A notary, in almost all [[common law]] jurisdictions other than most of North America, is a practitioner trained in the drafting and execution of legal documents.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Notaries traditionally recorded matters of judicial importance as well as private transactions or events where an officially authenticated record or a document drawn up with professional skill or knowledge was required. The functions of notaries specifically include the preparation of certain types of documents (including international contracts, deeds, wills, and powers of attorney) and certification of their due execution, administering of oaths, [[witness]]ing [[affidavit]]s and statutory declarations, certification of copy documents, noting and protesting of [[bill of exchange|bills of exchange]], and the preparation of [[ship]]s' protests. [[Image:Pakistan Notary example.jpg|thumb|left|An example of a notarized acknowledgment.]] Documents certified by notaries are sealed with the notary's [[Seal (device)|seal]] or stamp and are recorded by the notary in a register (also called a "protocol") maintained and permanently kept by him or her. These are known as "notarial acts". In countries subscribing to the Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement for Legalization for Foreign Public Documents only one further act of certification is required, known as an [[apostille]], and is issued by a government department (usually the Foreign Affairs Department or similar). For other countries an "authentication" or "legalization" must be issued by the Foreign Affairs Ministry of the country from which the document is being sent or the Embassy, Consulate-General, or High Commission of the country to which it is being sent. ==Information on individual countries== ===Australia=== In all Australian States and Territories (except Queensland) notaries public are appointed by the [[Australian court hierarchy#State and territory courts|Supreme Court of the relevant State or Territory]]. Very few have been appointed as a notary for more than one State or Territory. Queensland, like [[New Zealand]], continues the practice of appointment by the Archbishop of Canterbury acting through the [[Master of the Faculties]]. Many Australian notaries are lawyers but the overall number of lawyers who choose to become a notary is relatively low. For example, in [[South Australia]] (a State with a population of 1.5 million), of the over 2,500 lawyers in that state only about 100 are also notaries and most of those do not actively practice as such. In [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], in 2002 there were only 66 notaries for a city with a population of 3.5 million and only 90 for the entire state. Compare this with the United States where it has been estimated that there are over 3 million notaries for a nation with a population of 296 million. As Justice Debelle of the [[Supreme Court of South Australia]] said in the case of ''In The Matter of an Application by Marilyn Reys Bos to be a Public Notary'' [2003] SASC 320, delivered 12 September 2003,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/sa/SASC/2003/320.htm | title= AN APPLICATION BY MARILYN REYES BOS TO BE A PUBLIC NOTARY No. SCCIV-02-1688 <nowiki>[</nowiki>2003<nowiki>]</nowiki> SASC 320 (12 September 2003) | accessdate = 22 March 2008 | publisher = [http://www.austlii.edu.au/ Australasian Legal Information Institute, A joint facility of UTS and UNSW Faculties of Law] }}</ref> in refusing the application: {{quote|As a general rule, an applicant [for appointment as a notary] should be a legal practitioner of several years standing at least. Even a cursory perusal of texts on the duties and functions of a public notary demonstrates that a number of those functions and duties require at the very least a sound working knowledge of Australian law and commercial practice. In other words, the preparation of a notarial act plainly requires a sound knowledge of law and practice in Australia especially of the due preparation and execution of commercial and contractual instruments. It is essential that notaries in this State have a sufficient level of training, qualification and status to enable them efficiently and effectively to discharge the functions of the office.}} Historically there have been some very rare examples of patent attorneys or accountants being appointed, but that now seems to have ceased. However, there are three significant differences between notaries and other lawyers. *the duty of a notary is to the transaction as a whole, and not just to one of the parties. In certain circumstances a notary may act for both parties to a transaction as long as there is no conflict between them, and in such cases it his or her duty is to ensure that the transaction that they conclude is fair to both sides. *a notary will often need to place and complete a special clause or attach a special page (known as an [[eschatocol]]) on or to a document in order to make it valid for use overseas. :In the case of some documents which are to be used in some foreign countries it may also be necessary to obtain another certificate known either as an "authentication" or an "[[apostille]]" (depending on the relevant foreign country) from the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]]. *a notary identifies himself or herself on documents by the use of his or her individual seal. Such seals have historical origins and are regarded by most other countries as of great importance for establishing the genuineness of a document. Their principal duties include: # attestation of documents and certification of their due execution for use in Australia and internationally # preparation and certification of powers of attorney, wills, deeds, contracts and other legal documents for use in Australia and internationally # administering of oaths for use in Australia and internationally # witnessing affidavits, statutory declarations and other documents for use in Australia and internationally # certification of copy documents for use Australia and internationally # exemplification of official documents for use internationally # noting and protesting of bills of exchange # preparation of ships' protests Although it was once usual for Australian notaries to use a red embossed seal, it is now common for them to
