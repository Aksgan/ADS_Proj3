The other half of the sculpture comprises a [[Vigenère cipher|Vigenère]] encryption tableau, comprising 869 characters, if spaces are counted. Sanborn worked with a retiring CIA employee named [[Ed Scheidt]], Chairman of the CIA Cryptographic Center, to come up with the cryptographic systems used on the sculpture. Sanborn has revealed that the sculpture contains a riddle within a riddle, which will be solvable only after the four encrypted passages have been decrypted. He said that he gave the complete solution at the time of the sculpture's dedication to then-CIA director [[William Hedgcock Webster|William H. Webster]]. Sanborn said, however, that he had not given Webster the entire solution. He did, however, confirm that where in part 2 it says "Who knows the exact location? Only WW," that "WW" was intended to refer to William Webster. Sanborn also confirmed that should he die before the entire sculpture becomes deciphered that there will be someone able to confirm the solution.<ref>Zetter, Kim. [http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2005/01/66333 "Questions for Kryptos' Creator,"] ''Wired'' (January 20, 2005).</ref> == Solvers == Over the years, only three individuals have uncovered parts of the solutions. The first person to publicly announce solving the first three sections, in 1999, was [[James Gillogly]], a [[computer scientist]] from southern [[California]]. He and others thought at the time that he had correctly deciphered the sections K1, K2 and K3. After Gillogly's announcement, the CIA revealed that their analyst David Stein had also thought he had solved the same sections in 1998, using pencil and paper techniques, though at the time of his solution the information was only disseminated within the intelligence community, and no public announcement was made. The [[National Security Agency|NSA]] also claimed at that time that they had solvers, but would not reveal names or dates until 2005, when it was learned that a [[National Security Agency|NSA]] team led by Ken Miller, along with Dennis McDaniels and two other unnamed individuals, had thought they had solved parts 1&ndash;3 using a computer in late 1992. All of these early attempts to solve Kryptos presumed that K2 ended with WESTIDBYROWS. They were mistaken. It wasn't until [[October 10]], [[2005]]<ref>[http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/Kryptos/message/3719?threaded=1&l=1 Message 3719, posted to the Yahoo Kryptos group]</ref>, that Ms. [[Monet Friedrich]], a computer engineer from [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] came across the character sequence LAYERTWO at the end of K2.<ref>[http://sites.google.com/site/sarenasix/home From a radio interview on BellCoreRadio, season 1, episode 32, Barcode Brothers]</ref> To clarify.. Where all earlier attempts proposed that K2 ended with the plain text :...FOUR SECONDS WEST IDBYROWS, Monet discovered that K2 ended with the plain text :...FOUR SECONDS WEST X LAYERTWO. Monet's revelation came six months before [[Jim Sanborn]] announced an error. This 'error' served to confirm Monet's find. == Solutions == The following are the solutions of parts 1&ndash;3 of the sculpture.<ref>[http://www.elonka.com/kryptos/mirrors/cypherpunks/1999/0930.html Kryptos: The Sanborn Sculpture at CIA Headquarters]</ref> Misspellings present in the code are included as-is. Kryptos K1 and K2 ciphers are polyalphabetic substitution, using a [[Vigenère cipher|Vigenere Tableau]] similar to the tableau on the other half of the sculpture. K3 is a [[transposition cipher]], and K4 is still unsolved. === Solution 1 === Keywords: Kryptos, [[Palimpsest]] :BETWEEN SUBTLE SHADING AND THE ABSENCE OF LIGHT LIES THE NUANCE OF IQLUSION <!-- Yes, Iqlusion looks like a typo, but it's not, so please DO NOT CHANGE.

He said that he made an error in the sculpture by omitting an "X" used to indicate a break for aesthetic reasons, and that the decrypted text which ended "...FOUR SECONDS WEST ID BY ROWS" should actually be "...FOUR SECONDS WEST X LAYER TWO".<ref>[http://www.elonka.com/kryptos/CorrectedK2Announcement.html The Kryptos Group announces a corrected answer to Kryptos Part 2]</ref> Note: The coordinates mentioned in the plaintext: {{coord|38|57|6.5|N|77|8|44|W}}; [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=38%C2%B057%276.5%22+N+77%C2%B08%2744%22+W&t=k&om=1 on Google Maps]; [http://kryptos.arcticus.com/coords.html analysis of the cited location].

This is a paraphrased and misspelled quotation from [[Howard Carter (archaeologist)|Howard Carter]]'s account of the opening of the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]] on November 26, 1922, as described in his 1923 book ''The Tomb of Tutankhamun''. The question with which it ends is that posed by [[George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon|Lord Carnarvon]], to which Carter (in the book) famously replied "wonderful things". In the actual November 26, 1922 field notes, his reply was, "Yes, it is wonderful."<ref>[http://www.ashmolean.org/gri/4tut.html Tutankhamun: Anatomy of an Excavation]</ref> === Solution 4 === Part 4 remains unsolved, though there is an active [[Yahoo!

To solve it, it is crucial to have the first three sections correct, since when commenting on his error in section 2, Sanborn said they contain the clues to the last section.<ref>[http://www.wired.com/news/technology/1,70701-1.html Typo Confounds Kryptos Sleuths]</ref> In November 2010, Jim Sanborn released a clue that letters 64-69 NYPVTT equals
