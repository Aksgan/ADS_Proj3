An MSIC must be: <br />• attached to your outer clothing <br />• above waist height <br />• on the front of your body <br />• with the whole MSIC clearly visible You must keep your MSIC in a safe and secure location whilst not in use. You must not alter or deface your MSIC. Your MSIC is not transferable and can only be used by you. You must return your MSIC within 30 days to the issuing body after it: <br />• expires; <br />• is cancelled; <br />• has been damaged, altered or defaced; or <br />• you no longer need to enter a maritime security zone. If you change your name you must notify the body that issued the MSIC within 30 days. You will be issued with a replacement MSIC. If your MSIC is lost or stolen, you will need to provide a statutory declaration or police report or other information issued by the police before a replacement card can be issued by an issuing body. You will have committed an offence if your MSIC is lost, stolen or destroyed and you do not advise your issuing body within 7 days. You will have committed an offence if you contravene the regulations on how and where and MSIC must be worn. Further information on offences for contravening the MSIC regulations and their penalties can be found in the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Regulations 2005.<ref>http://www.comlaw.gov.au/comlaw/management.nsf/lookupindexpagesbyid/IP200401219?OpenDocument</ref> == Notes == {{Reflist}} == References == [http://www.infrastructure.gov.au/transport/security/maritime/msic.aspx Infrastructure Australia] <br /> [http://www.msic.id.au MSIC Issuing Body] [[Category:Personal identification]]</text> </page> <page> <id>23498</id> <title>Mark Handley (computer scientist)</title> <text>'''Mark Handley''' is Professor of Networked Systems in the Department of Computer Science of [[University College London]] since 2003, where he leads the Networks Research Group.

It was used on a variety of ships, ranging from [[destroyer]]s (one per ship) to [[battleship]]s (four per ship). The Mark 37 system used [[tachymetric]] target motion prediction to compute a fire control solution. Weighing more than 3000 pounds (1363 kilograms), the Mark 1 itself was installed in the plotting room, a water tight compartment that was located deep inside the ship's hull to provide as much protection against [[battle damage]] as was possible. Essentially an [[electromechanical]] [[analog computer]], the Mark 1 was electrically linked to the [[gun turret]]s and the Mark 37 [[director (military)|gun director]], the latter mounted as high on the superstructure as possible to afford maximum visual and radar range. The gun director was equipped with both optical and radar range finding, and was able to rotate on a small [[barbette]]-like structure. Using the range finders, the director was able to produce a continuously varying set of outputs, referred to as line-of-sight (LOS) data, that were electrically relayed to the Mark 1 via [[synchro|synchro motors]]. The LOS data provided the target's present range, bearing, and in the case of aerial targets, altitude. Additional inputs to the Mark 1 were continuously generated from the [[stable vertical]], a [[gyroscopic]] device that reacted to the roll and pitch of the ship, the [[pitometer log]], which measured the ship's speed through the water, and an [[anemometer]], which provided wind speed and direction. In "Plot" (the plotting room), a team of [[sailor]]s stood around the {{convert|4|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} Mark 1 and continuously monitored its operation. They would also be responsible for calculating and entering the average [[muzzle velocity]] of the [[projectile]]s to be fired before action started. This calculation was based on the type of [[propellant]] to be used and its temperature, the projectile type and weight, and the number of rounds fired through the guns to date. Given these inputs, the Mark 1 automatically computed the lead angles to the future position of the target at the end of the projectile's time of flight, adding in corrections for gravity, relative wind, the [[magnus effect]] of the spinning projectile, and [[parallax]], the latter compensation necessary due to the fact that the guns themselves were widely displaced along the length of the ship. Lead angles and corrections were added to the LOS data to generate the line-of-fire (LOF) data. The LOF data, bearing and elevation, as well as the projectile's fuze time, was sent to the turrets by synchro motors, whose motion actuated hydraulic machinery to aim the guns. Once the system was "locked" on the target, it produced a continuous
