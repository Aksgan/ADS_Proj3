Zoroastrian [[Parsis]] in his three-volume ''Zend-Avesta'' (1771 CE). * William Jones's publication of his grammar (also in 1771 CE) marked when knowledge of Persian grammar became really accessible, since the prior works were not available to most people. He hoped the work would open up study of the Persian Classics, but it was intended to assist East India Company employees. William Jones founded the Asiatic Society of Bengal (1784 CE), the first [[Orientalism|Oriental]] society. === Orientalism, Rediscovery, 19th century === During this period of intense interest in the Orient, Persian proved to be one of the most important languages for the incipient field of [[Comparative Linguistics]]. Many scholars in prior centuries had commented on the similarities between Germanic and Iranian languages<ref>Ibid, 14-15.</ref> But in the 19th century, scholars for the first time postulated a common ancestor to languages like [[Sanskrit]], [[Persian language|Persian]], and European languages which has since come to be called the [[Proto-Indo-European language]]. As important was the deciphering of [[Old Persian]], the language of dozens of inscriptions which still stand in Iran. [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Rawlinson]] first discovered that the language of these inscriptions was an ancient form of the Persian language. Since these inscriptions often included inscriptions in other Cuneiform scripts, this decipherment became like a [[Rosetta Stone]] for the languages of ancient [[Mesopotamia]]. All that we know of the languages and histories of the empires of [[Babylonia]], [[Assyria]], [[Sumer]], [[Elam]], and so on is indirectly indebted to knowledge of the Persian language. === Modernization, 20th century === During the [[Qajar dynasty]], Iranians first encountered Europeans in the context of the rise of the West. [[Napoleon I of France#Egyptian Expedition of 1798-99|Napoleon's expedition to Egypt]] in 1798 CE was the first European intrusion into the Muslim Middle East and prefigured many more disruptions for the peoples of this region, especially Iran. Iran lost territory in several wars with Russia<ref>[[Treaty of Gulistan]]</ref> and Britain.<ref>[[Anglo-Persian War]]</ref> Iran's economy suffered greatly as European sea lanes bypassed the legendary [[Silk Road]] which had always been a pillar of Iran's economy. New [[Industrialization|industrial]] processes of production made traditional ways of living impossible for Iranians. As in many other countries during this time like [[Japan]],<ref>[[Meiji Period]]</ref> [[China]],<ref>[[Self-Strengthening Movement]]</ref> and [[Ottoman Empire|Turkey]],<ref>[[Decline of the Ottoman Empire]]</ref> a [[Nationalism|nationalist]] reaction occurred in Iran as Iranians realized the importance of modernizing as quickly as possible to fight off the encroachment of the Western powers. It was at this point that modern educational institutions in Western tradition<ref>[[Dar ul-Funun]]</ref> were first opened in Iran. Iran would never be the same, and the study of language there merged with the tradition in Europe. == Persian Studies in Europe == {{Empty section|date=July 2010}} == Persian Studies in the United States == * [http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/mes/persian/ University of Texas at Austin] * [http://www.languages.umd.edu/persian/ University of Maryland] * [http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~nelc/iranian_persian.html Harvard University] * [http://nelc.osu.edu/ Ohio State University] == References == {{Ibid|date=March 2010}} {{Reflist|3}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Persian Studies}} [[Category:Iranian culture]] [[Category:Interdisciplinary fields]] [[Category:Cultural studies]] [[Category:Middle East]] [[Category:Area studies]]</text> </page> <page> <id>28888</id> <title>Persistence of a number</title> <text>In [[mathematics]], the '''persistence of a number''' is a term used to describe the number of times one must apply a given operation to an integer before reaching a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]], i.e. until further application does not change the number any more. Usually, this refers to the additive or multiplicative persistence of an integer, which is how often one has to replace the number by the sum or product of its digits until one reaches a single digit. Because the numbers are broken down into their digits, the additive or multiplicative persistence depends on the [[radix]]. In the remaining article, we will assume a radix of 10. The single-digit final state reached in the process of calculating an integers's additive persistence is its [[digital root]]. Put another way, a number's additive persistence is the measure of how many times we must [[digit sum|sum the digits]] it takes us to arrive at its digital root. == Examples == The additive persistence of 2718 is 2: first we find that 2 + 7 + 1 + 8 = 18, and then that 1 + 8 = 9. The multiplicative persistence of 39 is 3, because it takes three steps to reduce 39 to a single digit: 39 &rarr; 27 &rarr; 14 &rarr; 4. Also, 39 is the smallest number of multiplicative persistence 3. == Smallest numbers of a given persistence == For a radix of 10, there is thought to be no number with a multiplicative persistence > 11. The smallest numbers with persistence 0 through 11 are: 0, 10, 25, 39, 77, 679, 6788, 68889, 2677889, 26888999, 3778888999, 277777788888899 (by cleverly using the specific properties of numbers in this sequence, it can be calculated in a fraction of a second). The additive persistence of a number, however, can become arbitrarily large (proof: For a given number <math>n</math>, the persistence of the number consisting of <math>n</math> repetitions of the digit 1 is 1 higher than that of <math>n</math>). The smallest numbers of additive persistence 0 through 4 are: 0, 10, 19, 199, 19999999999999999999999. The next number in the sequence (the smallest number of additive persistence 5) is 2 &times; 10<sup>2&times;(10<sup>22</sup> &minus; 1)/9</sup> &minus; 1 (that is, 1 followed by 2222222222222222222222 9's). For any fixed base, the sum of the digits of a number is proportional to its [[logarithm]]; therefore, the additive persistence is proportional to the [[iterated logarithm]]. == External links == * Sequence {{OEIS2C|A003001}} of smallest numbers for given multiplicative persistence in the [[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences]] * Sequence {{OEIS2C|A006050}} of smallest numbers for given additive persistence [[Category:Number theory]] [[de:Querprodukt]] [[fr:Persistance (statistiques)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>28893</id> <title>Person-to-person lending</title> <text>'''Person-to-person lending''' (also known as '''peer-to-peer lending''', '''peer-to-peer investing''', and '''social lending'''; abbreviated frequently as '''P2P lending''') is a certain breed of financial transaction (primarily [[lending]] and [[borrowing]], though other more complicated transactions can be facilitated) which occurs directly between individuals or "peers" without the intermediation of a traditional financial institution.
