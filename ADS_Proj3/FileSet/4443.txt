It provides a model of how economic decisions might be decentralized and yet coordinated so as to achieve a global optimum. It was introduced by the Hungarian economist [[János Kornai]] and the mathematician Tamás Lipták in 1965. It is an alternative to [[Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition]]. ==See also== * [[Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition]] * [[Benders' decomposition]] * [[Delayed column generation|Column generation]] ==References== * J.

The largest thesaurus in the world is the [[Historical Thesaurus of the Oxford English Dictionary]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}, which contains more than 920,000 words. ==History and use of term== In antiquity, [[Philo of Byblos]] authored the first text that could now be called a thesaurus{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. In [[Sanskrit]], the [[Amarakosha]] is a thesaurus in verse form, written in the 4th century. The first example of the modern [[genre]], ''[[Roget's Thesaurus]]'', was compiled in 1805 by [[Peter Mark Roget]], and published in 1852. Entries in ''Roget's Thesaurus'' are listed conceptually rather than alphabetically. Although including synonyms, a thesaurus should not be taken as a complete list of all the synonyms for a particular word. The entries are also designed for drawing distinctions between similar words and assisting in choosing exactly the right word. Unlike a [[dictionary]], a thesaurus entry does not define words. The word "thesaurus" is derived from 16th-century [[New Latin]], in turn from [[Latin]] ''thesaurus'', which is the [[romanization]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''{{polytonic|θησαυρός}}'' (''thēsauros''), literally "treasure store",<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dqhsauro%2Fs θησαυρός], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> generally meaning a collection of things which are of big importance or value (and thus the medieval rank of '''thesaurer''' was a synonym for [[treasurer]]). This meaning has been largely supplanted by Roget's usage of the term. ==Thesauri in IT== In [[Information Science]], [[Library Science]], and [[Information Technology]], specialized thesauri are designed for information retrieval. They are a type of [[controlled vocabulary]], for indexing or tagging purposes. Such a thesaurus can be used as the basis of an index for online material. The [[Art and Architecture Thesaurus]], for example, is used to index the Canadian national database of museums, Artifacts Canada, held by the [[Canadian Heritage Information Network]] (CHIN). Information retrieval thesauri are formally
