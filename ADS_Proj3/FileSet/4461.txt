TOTP was submitted to the IETF as an Internet-Draft. it is a cornerstone of [[Initiative For Open Authentication]] (OATH). ==Applications== TOTP can be used to authenticate a user in a system via an authentication server. Also, if some more steps are carried out, the user can also authenticate the validation server. ==History== The TOTP draft was developed through the collaboration of several OATH members in order to create an industry-backed standard. It complements the event-based one-time standard HOTP, and offers end user organizations and enterprises more choice in selecting technologies that best fit their application requirements and security guidelines. In addition, OATH also submitted the final version of the OCRA (OATH Challenge-Response Algorithms) specification to the IETF. This version incorporates all the feedback and commentary that the authors received from the technical community based on the prior versions submitted to the IETF.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.openauthentication.org/news/20080408|title=OATH Submits TOTP: Time-Based One Time Password Specification to IETF|last=Alexander|first=Madison|work=Open Authentication|date=|accessdate=22 February 2010}}</ref> ==See also== * [[Initiative For Open Authentication]] * [[HOTP]] ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== * [http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mraihi-totp-timebased Draft from IETF web site] * [http://www.openauthentication.org/ Initiative for Open Authentication] {{DEFAULTSORT:Time-Based One-Time Password Algorithm}} [[Category:Internet protocols]] [[Category:Authentication methods]]</text> </page> <page> <id>37735</id> <title>Time-bin encoding</title> <text>{{No footnotes|date=April 2009}} '''Time-bin encoding''' is a technique used in [[Quantum information science]] to encode a [[qubit]] of information on a [[photon]]. Quantum information science makes use of qubits as a basic resource similar to [[bit]]s in classical [[computing]]. Qubits are any two-level quantum mechanical system; there are many different physical implementations of qubits, one of which is time-bin encoding. While the time-bin encoding technique is very robust against [[decoherence]], it does not allow easy interaction between the different qubits. As such, it is much more useful in [[quantum communication]] (such as [[quantum teleportation]] and [[quantum key distribution]]) than in [[quantum computation]].
