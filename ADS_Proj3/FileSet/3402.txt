If the network could not deliver the message, it would send an error message back to the sending host. Meanwhile, the developers of [[CYCLADES]] and of [[ALOHAnet]] demonstrated that it was possible to build an effective computer network without providing reliable packet transmission. This lesson was later embraced by the designers of [[Ethernet]]. If a network does not guarantee packet delivery, then it becomes the host's responsibility to provide reliability by detecting and retransmitting lost packets. Subsequent experience on the ARPANET indicated that the network itself could not reliably detect all packet delivery failures, and this pushed responsibility for error detection onto the sending host in any case. This led to the development of the [[end-to-end principle]], which is one of the [[Internet]]'s fundamental design assumptions. == Example: IP packets ==<!-- This section is linked from [[IPsec]] --> [[Internet Protocol|IP]] packets are composed of a header and payload. The [[IPv4#Packet structure|IPv4 packet]] header consists of: # 4 bits that contain the ''version'', that specifies if it's an [[IPv4]] or [[IPv6]] packet, # 4 bits that contain the ''Internet Header Length'' which is the length of the header in multiples of 4 bytes (e.g. 5 means 20 bytes). # 8 bits that contain the ''Type of Service'', also referred to as [[Quality of Service]] (QoS), which describes what priority the packet should have, # 16 bits that contain the ''length'' of the packet in bytes, # 16 bits that contain an ''identification tag'' to help reconstruct the packet from several [[IP fragmentation|fragments]], # 3 bits that contain a zero, a flag that says whether the packet is allowed to be ''fragmented'' or not (DF: Don't fragment), and a flag to state whether more fragments of a packet follow (MF: More Fragments) # 13 bits that contain the ''fragment offset'', a field to identify position of fragment within original packet # 8 bits that contain the ''[[Time to live]]'' (TTL) which is the number of hops (router, computer or device along a network) the packet is allowed to pass before it dies (for example, a packet with a TTL of 16 will be allowed to go across 16 routers to get to its destination before it is discarded), # 8 bits that contain the ''protocol'' (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.) # 16 bits that contain the ''Header Checksum,'' a number used in error detection, # 32 bits that contain the ''source IP address'', # 32 bits that contain the ''destination address''. After those, optional flags can be added of varied length, which can change based on the protocol used, then the data that packet carries is added. An IP packet has no trailer. However, an IP packet is often carried as the payload inside an Ethernet frame, which has its own header and trailer. === Delivery not guaranteed === Many networks do not provide guarantees of delivery, nonduplication of packets, or in-order delivery of packets, ''e.g.'', the [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] protocol of the [[Internet protocol suite|Internet]]. However, it is possible to layer a [[transport protocol]] on top of the packet service that can provide such protection; [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] and [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] are the best examples of layer 4, the Transport Layer, of the seven layered [[OSI model]]. The header of a packet specifies the data type, packet number, total number of packets, and the sender's and receiver's [[IP address]]es. The term [[frame (telecommunications)|frame]] is sometimes used to refer to a packet exactly as transmitted over the wire or radio. == Example: the NASA Deep Space Network == The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems ([[CCSDS]]) packet telemetry standard defines the protocol used for the transmission of spacecraft instrument data over the deep-space channel. Under this standard, an image or other data sent from a spacecraft instrument is transmitted using one or more packets. === CCSDS packet definition === A packet is a block of data with length that can vary between successive packets, ranging from 7 to 65,542 bytes, including the packet header. * Packetized data is transmitted via frames, which are fixed-length data blocks. The size of a frame, including frame header and control information, can range up to 2048 bytes. * Packet sizes are fixed during the development phase. Because packet lengths are variable but frame lengths are fixed, packet boundaries usually do not coincide with frame boundaries. === Telecom processing notes === Data in a frame is typically protected from channel errors by error-correcting codes. * Even when the channel errors exceed the correction capability of the error-correcting code, the presence of errors nearly always is detected by the error-correcting code or by a separate error-detecting code. * Frames for which uncorrectable errors are detected are marked as undecodable and typically are deleted. === Handling data loss === Deleted undecodable whole frames are the principal type of data loss that affects compressed data sets. There generally would be little to gain from attempting to use compressed data from a frame marked as undecodable. * When errors are present in a frame, the bits of the subband pixels are already decoded before the first bit error will remain intact, but all subsequent decoded bits in the segment usually will be completely corrupted; a single bit error is often just as disruptive as many bit errors. * Furthermore, compressed data usually are protected by powerful, long-blocklength error-correcting codes, which are the types of codes most likely to yield substantial fractions of bit errors throughout those frames that are undecodable. Thus, frames with detected errors would be essentially unusable even if they were not deleted by the frame processor. This data loss can be compensated for with the following mechanisms. * If an erroneous frame escapes detection, the decompressor will blindly use the frame data as if they were reliable, whereas in the case of detected erroneous frames, the decompressor can base its reconstruction on incomplete, but not misleading, data. * Fortunately, it is extremely rare for an erroneous frame to go undetected. * For frames coded by the CCSDS [[Reedâ€“Solomon
