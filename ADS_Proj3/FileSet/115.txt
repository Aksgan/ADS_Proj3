It is not a re-entry permit; it is only issued to aliens without [[permanent residency]]. Advance Parole is permission for certain aliens, who do not have a valid immigrant [[Visa (document)|visa]], to re-enter the United States after traveling abroad. Such aliens include those who have applied to adjust their status to that of permanent resident or to change non-immigrant status. Advance parole must be approved before the applicant leaves the United States, or any residency application will in general be denied. Travel outside of the United States may have severe consequences for aliens who have been unlawfully present even if they have obtained advance parole. ==Who needs Advance Parole?== Aliens in the United States who have: *an application for adjustment of status pending. *been admitted as a [[refugee]] or have been granted asylum. *been granted benefits under the Family Unity Program. *been granted Temporary Protected Status. *an asylum application pending. *an emergent personal or bona fide reason to travel temporarily abroad. Note: Aliens holding valid H-1 (temporary worker in a specialty occupation) or L-1 (intra-company transferee) visas and their dependants in H-4 or L-2 status who have filed for adjustment of status do not have to file for advance parole as long as they maintain their non-immigrant status. ==Who is not eligible for Advance Parole?== Aliens in the United States are not eligible for Advance Parole if they are: *in the United States without a valid immigration status. *an exchange alien subject to the foreign residence requirement. *the beneficiary of a private bill. *under removal proceedings. ==How does one obtain advance parole?== To obtain advance parole, file USCIS Form I-131 (Application for Travel Document), complete with supporting documentation, photos and fee, at your local [[USCIS]] office or the Service Center having jurisdiction over your place of residence. After receiving USCIS Form I-131, read it carefully and note the documentation and photos that must be submitted. Detailed information is provided in the instructions. Further information on forms, filing fees, and fee waivers is available in Forms, Fees & Filing Locations. ==Does Advance Parole guarantee admission into the United States?== Advance parole does not guarantee admission into the United States. Aliens who have obtained advance parole are still subject to the USCIS inspection process at the port of entry. {{DEFAULTSORT:Re-Entry Permit}} [[Category:Personal identification]]</text> </page> <page> <id>1095</id> <title>Advanced 365</title> <text>{{Infobox Company | company_name = Advanced 365 (formerly Business Systems Group | logo = [[Image:Advanced365logo.png|200px]] | foundation = Incorporated in 1987 | parent = Advanced Computer Software PLC (AIM:ASW) | location = [[London]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] | industry = IT Managed Services | products = [[Managed Services]], [[IT Outsourcing]], [[Software as a Service]], [[Cloud Computing]], [[Software Development]], [[Business Intelligence]]. | key_people = Vin Murria <small>([[CEO]])</small>, Nick Gerard <small>([[Executive Chairman]])</small>, Neil Cross <small>([[Managing Director]])</small><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsg.co.uk/page.aspx?id=292 |title=Leadership |publisher=Advanced 365 |date= |accessdate=2010-12-30}}</ref> | homepage = [http://www.bsg.co.uk www.bsg.co.uk] }} '''Advanced 365''' rebranded from '''Business Systems Group Ltd (BSG)''' in November 2010 and provides outsourced IT managed services, software development and business intelligence services to the commercial, not for profit, health and public sector markets. ==Operations== BSG was based on [[City Road (London)|City Road]] in [[London]].
