Both can be setup to use [[DTMF]] or [[FSK]] for the data transport layer. ==See also== * [[Telemetry]] == References == <References/> [[Category:Computer peripherals]] [[Category:Telemetry]] [[ar:وحدة تحكم طرفية]] [[ca:Unitat Terminal Remota]] [[de:Fernbedienungsterminal]] [[es:UTR]]</text> </page> <page> <id>31784</id> <title>Remote computer</title> <text>{{moreref|date=July 2007}} A '''remote computer''' is a [[computer]] to which a user does not have physical access, but which he or she can access or manipulate via some kind of [[computer network|network]]. <ref>http://www.ks-soft.com/glossary/glossary.htm</ref> <ref>www.ehow.com/about_6505443_definition-remote-computer.html</ref> Extranet remote computer is a remote computer in the [[extranet]]. == See also == * [[Computer network]] * [[Firewall]] * [[Intranet]] * [[Ping]] * [[Remote desktop]] == References == <References/> [[Category:Classes of computers]] [[Category:Computer networking]] {{Compu-hardware-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>31794</id> <title>Remote manipulator</title> <text>[[Image:WaldoNTS.jpg|thumb|right|300px|'''Manipulator arms''' inside the Hot Bay, Area 25, [[Nevada Test Site]] ]] A '''remote manipulator''', also known as a '''telefactor''', '''telemanipulator''', or '''waldo''' (after the short story "[[Waldo (short story)|Waldo]]" by [[Robert A. Heinlein]] which features a man who invents and uses such devices),<ref>[http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=23 Technovelgy telemanipulator page]</ref> is a device which, through [[Electronics|electronic]], [[hydraulic]], or [[Machine|mechanical]] linkages, allows a [[hand]]-like mechanism to be controlled by a [[human]] operator. The purpose of such a device is usually to move or manipulate hazardous materials for reasons of [[safety]]. ==History== In 1945, the company Central Research Laboratories<ref>[http://www.centres.com/nuclear/manip/maniphis.htm CRL history]</ref> was given the [[contract]] to develop a remote manipulator for the [[Argonne National Laboratory]]. The intent was to replace devices which manipulated highly [[radioactivity|radioactive]] materials from above a sealed chamber or [[hot cell]], with a mechanism which operated through the side wall of the chamber, allowing a researcher to stand normally while working. The result was the '''Master-Slave Manipulator Mk. 8''', or MSM-8, which became the iconic remote manipulator<ref>[http://www.centres.com/nuclear/manip/manip.htm Telemanipulator page]</ref> seen in newsreels and movies, such as the ''[[The Andromeda Strain (film)|Andromeda Strain]]'' or ''[[THX 1138]]''.

It includes the [[RenderMan Shading Language]]. As Pixar's technical specification for a standard [[communications protocol]] (or [[interface (computer science)|interface]]) between modeling programs and rendering programs capable of producing photorealistic-quality images, RISpec is a similar concept to [[PostScript]] but for describing 3D [[scene]]s rather than 2D page layouts. Thus, modelling programs which understand the RenderMan Interface protocol can send data to rendering software which implements the RenderMan Interface, without caring what [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] [[algorithm]]s are utilized by the latter. The interface was first published in 1988 (version 3.0) and was designed to be sufficiently [[future proof]] to encompass advances in technology for a significant number of years. The current revision is 3.2.1, released in November 2005. ==RenderMan Interface Specification== What set the RISpec apart from other standards of the time was that it allowed using high-level geometric primitives, like quadrics or bicubic patches, to specify geometric primitives implicitly, rather than relying on a modeling application to generate polygons approximating these shapes explicitly beforehand. Another novelty introduced by the RISpec at the time was the specification of a [[shading language]] (SL). The [[RenderMan Shading Language|RenderMan shading language]] allows [[Procedural textures|material definition]]s of [[surface]]s to be described not only by adjusting a small set of parameters, but in an arbitrarily complex fashion by using a [[C (programming language)|C]]-like programming language to write [[shading]] procedures commonly known as [[procedural textures]] and [[shader]]s. Lighting, and displacements on the surface are also programmable using the [[SL]] language. The shading language allows each statement to be executed in a [[SIMD]] manner, but does not insist on it. Another feature that sets renderers based on the RISpec apart from many other renderers is the ability to output arbitrary variables as an image; surface normals, separate lighting passes and pretty much anything else can be output from the renderer in a single pass. RenderMan has much in common with [[OpenGL]], despite the two APIs being targeted to different sets of users
