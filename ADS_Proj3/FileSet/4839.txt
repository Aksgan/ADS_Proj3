was critical of this approach, describing it as "horribly inefficient" and susceptible to attacks. In a posting to [[BugTraq]], he explained that, "every single Windows 98 computer that wishes to get an update has to rely on a single host for the security. If that one server got compromised one day, or an attacker cracks the MS DNS server again, there could be millions of users installing [[trojan horse (computing)|trojans]] every hour. The scope of this attack is big enough to attract crackers who actually know what they are doing..."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://seclists.org/bugtraq/1999/Jan/0400.html |title=How the MS Critical Update Notification works... |last=Moore |first=H D |authorlink=H D Moore |date=January 29, 1999 |accessdate=2008-07-29 }}</ref> The Critical Update Notification tool continued to be promoted by Microsoft through 1999 and the first half of 2000. Initial releases of [[Windows 2000]] shipped with the tool, but Windows 95 and [[Windows NT 4.0]] were not supported. ===Automatic Updates=== [[File:Win Update ME.png|thumb|left|Windows Update v4 in [[Windows Me]].]] [[File:Winautoupdates.PNG|thumb|right|Automatic Updates 'Restart Required' in [[Windows XP]].]] With the release of [[Windows Me]] in 2000, Microsoft introduced '''Automatic Updates''' as a replacement for the Critical Update Notification tool. Unlike its predecessor, Automatic Updates includes the ability to download and install updates without using a [[web browser]]. Instead of the five minute schedule used by its predecessor, the Automatic Updates client checks the Windows Update servers once a day. The user is given the option to download available updates then prompt the user to install them, or to notify the user prior to downloading any available updates. After Windows Me is installed, the user is prompted via a [[balloon help|notification balloon]] to configure the Automatic Updates client. The Windows Update web site itself was significantly updated to match the visual style of Windows XP. Windows XP and Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 include [[Background Intelligent Transfer Service]], a protocol for transferring files in the background without user interaction. As a system component, it is capable of monitoring the user's Internet usage, and throttling its own bandwidth usage in order to prioritize user-initiated activities. The Automatic Updates client for these operating systems was updated to use this system service. ===Microsoft Update=== [[File:Microsoft Update in Windows XP.PNG|thumb|right|Microsoft Update in [[Windows XP]].]] At the February 2005 [[RSA Conference]], Microsoft announced the first beta of '''Microsoft Update''', an optional replacement for Windows Update that provides security patches, service packs and other updates for both Windows and other Microsoft software.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.helpwithwindows.com/microsoft-update.html |title=Microsoft Update Site Launched |date=June 10, 2005 |accessdate=2008-07-30 |publisher=helpwithwindows.com }}</ref> The initial release in June 2005 provided support for [[Microsoft Office|Microsoft Office 2003]], [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Exchange 2003]], and [[Microsoft SQL Server|SQL Server 2000]], running on Windows 2000, XP, and Server 2003. Over time, the list has expanded to include other Microsoft products, such as [[Windows Live Essentials|Windows Live]], [[Windows Defender]], [[Microsoft Visual Studio|Visual Studio]], runtimes and redistributables, [[Zune|Zune Software]], [[Windows Virtual PC|Virtual PC]] and [[Microsoft Virtual Server|Virtual Server]], [[CAPICOM]], [[Microsoft Lync]], and other server products. It also offers [[Microsoft Silverlight|Silverlight]] and [[Windows Media Player]] as optional downloads if applicable to the operating system. ===Office Update=== '''Microsoft Office Update''' was a free online service that allowed users to detect and install updates for certain Microsoft Office products. This update service supported Office 2000, Office XP, Office 2003, and Office 2007. On 1 August 2009, Microsoft decommissioned the service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/FX010402221033.aspx |title=Microsoft Decommissioning the Office Update Service - FAQ |publisher=Office.microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}</ref> Users are now required to use Microsoft Update. However, as Microsoft Update does not work with Office 2000, Office 2000 users no longer have any method of automatically detecting and installing updates. This is not a limitation for existing installations of Office 2000, because the product is no longer supported and so no new updates are being produced. However, it is a serious limitation for anyone re-installing Office 2000. ===Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and Windows 7=== [[File:Windows Update Restart Vista.png|thumb|left|Revised ''Restart'' [[dialog box]] in Windows Vista]] In Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and Windows 7, the web site is no longer used to provide a user interface for selecting and downloading updates. In its place, the Automatic Updates [[Control Panel (Windows)|control panel]] has been expanded to provide similar functionality. Support for Microsoft Update is also built into the operating system, but is turned off by default. The revised Windows Update can also be set to automatically download and install both ''Important'' and ''Recommended'' updates. In prior versions of Windows, such updates were only available through the Windows Update web site. In versions of Windows prior to Vista, updates requiring a reboot would pop up a dialog box every number of specified minutes requesting that users reboot their machines.<ref name="atwood">{{cite web |url=http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000294.html |title=XP Automatic Update Nagging |last=Atwood |first=Jeff |publisher=Coding Horror: .NET And Human Factors |date=May 13, 2005 |accessdate=2006-09-22 }}</ref> This dialog box was changed to allow the user to select a longer period of time (up to 4 hours) before being prompted again. The revised dialog box also displays under other applications, instead of on top of them. In Windows 7 and Vista<ref>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windowsupdate/faq.mspx</ref> once automatic updates have finished the computer will be shut down after a countdown, sometimes causing the countdown to finish and the system to reboot while the user is in the middle of using the computer (or away from the computer and not wanting it to reboot for various reasons), possibly losing data, gameplay advancement, etc. Windows Update makes use of [[Transactional NTFS]], a [[file system]] feature introduced with Windows Vista, when performing updates to Windows system files. This feature helps Windows recover cleanly in the event of an unexpected shut-down during an update, as the transactioning system will ensure that changes are committed to the file system in an [[atomicity (database systems)|atomic]] fashion.<ref name="filecab">{{cite web |title=NTFS Beta Chat Transcript |url=https://blogs.technet.com/filecab/articles/457811.aspx |date=July 12, 2006 |accessdate=22 September 2006 |work=The Filing Cabinet |publisher=TechNet Blogs }}</ref> ==Statistics== At the beginning of 2005, Windows Update was being accessed by about 150 million people,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/speeches/2005/02-15RSA05.aspx |title=RSA Conference 2005: "Security: Raising the Bar" (speech transcript) |date=February 15, 2005 |accessdate=2008-07-30
