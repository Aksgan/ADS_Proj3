Since this theorem was advanced in 1970, it has attracted a wide body of commentary from philosophers such as [[James M. Buchanan]] and [[Robert Nozick]]. The most contentious aspect is, on one hand, to contradict the [[libertarian]] notion that the market mechanism is sufficient to produce a Pareto-optimal society—and on the other hand, argue that degrees of choice and freedom, rather than [[welfare economics]], should be the defining trait of that market mechanism. As a result it attracts commentary from both the left and the right of the political spectrum. ==The theorem== The formal statement of the theorem is as follows. Suppose there is a set of social outcomes <math>X</math> with at least two alternatives and there is a group of at least two individuals each with preferences <math>\succsim_i</math> over <math>X</math>. A benign social planner has to choose a single outcome from the set using the information about the individuals' preferences. The planner uses a social choice function. For every possible set of preferences, a social choice function selects a choice <math>x \in X</math>. There are two desirable properties we might ask of the social choice function: 1) A social choice function respects the "Paretian principle" (also called Pareto optimality) if it never selects an outcome when there is an alternative that everybody strictly prefers. So if there are two choices, <math>(x,y)</math> such that <math>y\succ x</math> for all individuals, then the social choice function does not select <math>x</math>. 2) A social choice function respects "Minimal liberalism" if there are two individuals whose preferences can veto some social outcomes. That is, there is one individual called <math>i</math> and one pair of alternatives <math>a,b</math> such that if <math>i</math> strictly prefers <math>a</math> to <math>b</math> then the social choice function cannot chose <math>b</math> and vice-versa. Similarly there must be another individual called <math>j</math> whose preferences can veto a choice over a (possibly different) pair of alternatives <math>c,d</math>. If <math>c\succ d</math> then the social choice function cannot select <math>d</math>. Sen's impossibility theorem establishes that it's impossible for the social planner to satisfy condition 1 and condition 2. In other words, for every social choice function there is at least one set of preferences that force the planner to violate condition (1) or condition (2). ==Sen's example== The following simple example involving two agents and three alternatives was put forward by Sen.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Amartya|first=Sen|title=The Impossibility of a Paretian Liberal|journal=Journal of Political Economy|year=1970|volume=78|pages=152–157|id={{JSTOR|1829633}}}}</ref> <blockquote> There is a copy of a certain book, say ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover|Lady Chatterly's Lover]]'', which is viewed differently by individuals 1 and 2. The three alternatives are: that individual 1 reads it (<math>x</math>), that individual 2 reads it (<math>y</math>), that no one reads it (<math>z</math>). Person 1, who is a prude, prefers most that no one reads it, but given the choice between either of the two reading it, he would prefer that he read it himself rather than exposing the gullible Mr. 2 to the influences of Lawrence. (Prudes, I am told, tend to prefer to be censors than being censored.) In decreasing order of preference, his ranking is <math>z,x,y</math>. Person 2, however, prefers that either of them should read it rather than neither. Furthermore he takes delight in the thought that prudish Mr. 1 may have to read Lawrence, and his first preference is that person 1 should read it, next best that he himself should read it, and worst that neither should. His ranking is, therefore, <math>x,y,z</math>. </blockquote> Suppose that we give each individual the right to decide whether they want or don't want to read the book. Then it's impossible to find a social choice function without violating "Minimal liberalism" or the "Paretian principle". "Minimal liberalism" requires that Mr. 1 not be forced to read the book, so <math>x</math> cannot be chosen. It also requires that Mr. 2 not be forbidden from reading the book, so <math>z</math> cannot be chosen. But alternative <math>y</math> cannot be chosen either because of the Paretian principle. Both Mr. 1 and Mr. 2 agree that that they prefer Mr. 1 to read the book (<math>x</math>) than Mr. 2 (<math>y</math>). Since we have ruled out any possible solutions, we must conclude that it's impossible to find a social choice function. ==Another example== Suppose [[Alice and Bob]] have to decide whether to go to the cinema to see a '[[chick flick]]', and that each has the liberty to decide whether to go themselves. If the personal preferences are based on Alice first wanting to be with Bob, then thinking it is a good film, and on Bob first wanting Alice to see it but then not wanting to go himself, then the personal preference orders might be: *Alice wants: ''both to go > neither to go > Alice to go > Bob to go'' *Bob wants: ''Alice to go > both to go > neither to go > Bob to go'' There are two [[Pareto efficient]] solutions: either Alice goes alone or they both go. Clearly Bob will not go on his own: he would not set off alone, but if he did then Alice would follow, and Alice's personal liberty means the joint preference must have ''both to go > Bob to go''. However, since Alice also has personal liberty if Bob does not go, the joint preference
