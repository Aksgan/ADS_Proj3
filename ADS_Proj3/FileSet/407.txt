and forward, a little too precise, a little too rapid. He bends forward a little too eagerly; his voice, his eyes express an interest a little too solicitous for the order of the customer. Finally there he returns, trying to imitate in his walk the inflexible stiffness of some kind of automaton while carrying his tray with the recklessness of a tight-rope-walker by putting it in a perpetually unstable, perpetually broken equilibrium which he perpetually re-establishes by a light movement of the arm and hand. All his behavior seems to us a game. He applies himself to changing his movements as if they were mechanisms, the one regulating the other; his gestures and even his voice seems to be mechanisms; he gives himself the quickness and pitiless rapidity of things. He is playing, he is amusing himself. But what is he playing? We need not watch long before we can explain it: he is playing at ''being '' a waiter in a cafe. There is nothing there to surprise us." Sartre consistently mentions that in order to get out of bad faith, one must realize that his or her existence and his formal projection of a self are distinctly separate and within the means of human control. This separation is a form of ''nothingness''. Nothingness, in terms of bad faith, is characterized by Sartre as the internal negation which separates pure existence and identity, and thus we are subject to playing our lives out in a similar manner. An example is ''something that is what it is'' (existence) and ''something that is what it is not'' (a waiter defined by his occupation). Yet, Sartre takes a stance against characterizing bad faith in terms of "mere social positions"; I am never any one of my attitudes, any one of my actions. The good speaker is the one who ''plays'' at speaking because he cannot ''be speaking''. This literally means that, like the cafe waiter, the speaker is not his condition or social categorization, but is a speaker consumed by bad faith. Thus, we must realize what we are (beings who exist) and what we are not (a social, historical, preoccupation) in order to step out of bad faith. Yet, existents (human beings) must maintain a balance between existence, their roles and nothingness to become authentic beings.'' Additionally, an important tenet of bad faith is that we must enact a bit of good faith in order to take advantage of our role to reach an authentic existence. The authentic domain of bad faith, is realizing that the role we are playing is the lie. The goal of authenticity can be traced back to [[Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky's]] [[Notes from Underground]]. Dostoevsky has been called "The Grandfather of existentialism." To live and project into the future as a project of a self, while keeping out of bad faith and living by the will of the self is living life authentically. This is perhaps one of the main goals of Sartre's opus. One of the most important implications of bad faith is the abolition of traditional [[ethics]] and morality. Being a "moral person" requires one to deny authentic impulses (everything that makes us human), and allow the will of another person to change one's actions. Being a moral person is one of the most severe forms of bad faith. Essentially Sartre characterizes this as "the faith of bad faith" which is and should not be, in Sartre's opinion, at the heart of one's existence. Sartre has a very low opinion of conventional morality, condemning it as a tool of the bourgeoisie to control the masses. Examples include a "Keep Off The Grass" sign, which derives its being from a bourgeois need but hinders the need of the masses for play and relaxation. Bad faith also results when individuals begin to view their life as made up of distinct past events, like the "perfect moments" or "adventures" from ''Nausea.'' By viewing one's ego as it once was rather than as it currently is, one ends up negating the current self and replacing it with a past self that no longer exists (as illustrated by Anny in ''Nausea''). ==Part 3, Chapter 1: The look== The mere possible presence of another person causes one to look at him/herself as an object, and see his/her world as it appears to the other. This is not done from a specific location outside oneself, it is non-positional. This is a recognition of the [[subjectivity]] in others. This transformation is most clear when one sees a [[mannequin]] that one confuses for a real person for a moment. *:While they are believing it is a person, their world is transformed, and everything exists as an object that partially escapes them. During this time the world comes on to you differently, and you can no longer have a total subjectivity. The world is now his world, a foreign world that no longer comes from you, but from him. The other person is a "threat to the order and arrangement of your whole worldâ€¦Your world is suddenly haunted by the Other's values, over which you have no control."<ref name="earthlink">{{cite web| url=http://home.earthlink.net/~mazz747/id12.html| title=An analysis of "The look"| first= Paul Vincent| last= Spade| accessdate=2006-07-02 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060615060533/http://home.earthlink.net/~mazz747/id12.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-06-15}}</ref> *:When they realise it is a mannequin, and is not subjective, the world seems to transfer back, and they are again in the center of a universe. :This is back to the '''pre-reflective''' [[mode of being]], it is "the eye of the camera that is always present but is never seen".<ref name="earthlink" /> The person is occupied, and too busy for self-reflection.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://cbae.nmsu.edu/~dboje/teaching/503/sartre_links.htm| title=Jean-Paul Sartre - Being and Nothingness | accessdate=2006-07-02}}</ref> This process is continual, unavoidable and ineluctable.
