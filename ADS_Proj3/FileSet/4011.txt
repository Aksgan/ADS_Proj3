The [[vector]]s of a two-dimensional graphic, each encoding a direction from the previous pixel along with a flag indicating whether the new pixel should be illuminated or not, were encoded up to three in a byte. These were stored in a table via the Monitor or the <code>[[PEEK and POKE|POKE]]</code> command. From there, the graphic could be referenced by number (a table could contain up to 255 shapes), and built-in Applesoft routines permitted scaling, rotating, and drawing or erasing the shape. An [[XOR]] mode was also available to allow the shape to be visible on any color background; this had the advantage, also, of allowing the shape to be erased by redrawing it. Apple did not provide any utilities for creating shape tables; they had to be created by hand, usually by plotting on graph paper, then calculating the hexadecimal values and entering them into the computer. [[Beagle Bros]] created a shape table editing program, which eliminated the "number crunching", called ''[[Apple Mechanic]]'', and a related program, ''[[Font Mechanic]]''. Applesoft's high-resolution graphics routines were not optimized for speed, so shape tables were not typically used for performance-critical software such as games, which were typically written in assembly language and used pre-shifted bitmap shapes. Shape tables were used primarily for static shapes and sometimes for fancy text; Beagle Bros offered a number of fonts in ''Font Mechanic'' as Applesoft shape tables. == See also == * [[Sprite (computer science)|Sprite]] == External links == * [http://www.atariarchives.org/cgp/Ch03_Sec05.php Atariarchives.org example], detailed instructions on assembling shape tables by hand [[Category:Computer graphics]] [[Category:Apple II software]]</text> </page> <page> <id>34151</id> <title>ShareOffice</title> <text>{{citations missing|date= September 2008}} '''ShareOffice''' is an [[online office suite]] built on top of the open standards known as OpenSAM (short for "open simple [[Ajax (programming)|AJAX]] [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|mashup]]").
