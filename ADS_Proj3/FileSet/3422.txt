non-trivial theories. ==Paraconsistent logics are propositionally weaker than classical logic== Paraconsistent logics are [[propositional calculus|propositionally]] ''weaker'' than [[classical logic]]; that is, they deem ''fewer'' propositional inferences valid. The point is that a paraconsistent logic can never be a propositional extension of classical logic, that is, propositionally validate everything that classical logic does. In that sense, then, paraconsistent logic is more conservative or cautious than classical logic. It is due to such conservativeness that paraconsistent languages can be more ''expressive'' than their classical counterparts including the hierarchy of [[metalanguage]]s due to [[Tarski]] et al. According to Feferman [1984]: ''“…natural language abounds with directly or indirectly self-referential yet apparently harmless expressions—all of which are excluded from the Tarskian framework.”'' This expressive limitation can be overcome in paraconsistent logic. == Motivation == The primary motivation for paraconsistent logic is the conviction that it ought to be possible to reason with inconsistent [[information]] in a controlled and discriminating way. The principle of explosion precludes this, and so must be abandoned. In non-paraconsistent logics, there is only one inconsistent theory: the trivial theory that has every sentence as a theorem. Paraconsistent logic makes it possible to distinguish between inconsistent theories and to reason with them. Sometimes it is possible to revise a theory to make it consistent. In other cases (e.g., large [[software]] systems) it is currently impossible to attain consistency. Some philosophers take a more radical approach, holding that some contradictions are ''true'', and thus a theory’s being inconsistent is not always an indication that it is incorrect. This view, known as [[dialetheism]], is motivated by several considerations, most notably an inclination to take certain [[paradox]]es such as the [[liar paradox|Liar]] and [[Russell’s paradox]] at face value. Not all advocates of paraconsistent logic are dialetheists. On the other hand, being a dialetheist rationally commits one to some form of paraconsistent logic, on pain of otherwise having to accept everything as true (i.e. [[trivialism]]). == Tradeoff == Paraconsistency does not come for free: it involves a tradeoff. In particular, abandoning the principle of explosion requires one to abandon at least one of the following four very intuitive principles:<ref>See the article on the [[principle of explosion]] for more on this.</ref> {| border=1 align=center cellpadding=4 |[[Disjunction introduction]] |<math>A \vdash A \lor B</math> |- |[[Disjunctive syllogism]] |<math>A \lor B, \neg A \vdash B</math> |- |[[Transitive relation|Transitivity]] or “[[Cut rule|cut]]” |<math> \Gamma \vdash A; A \vdash B \Rightarrow \Gamma \vdash B</math> |} Though each of these principles has been challenged, the most popular approach among logicians is to reject disjunctive syllogism. If one is a [[dialetheist]], it makes perfect sense that disjunctive syllogism should fail. The idea behind this syllogism is that, if ''¬ A'', then ''A'' is excluded, so the only way ''A ∨ B'' could be true would be if ''B'' were true. However, if ''A'' and ''¬ A'' can both be true at the same time, then this reasoning fails. Another approach is to reject disjunction introduction but keep disjunctive syllogism, transitivity. The disjunction (A ∨ B) is defined as ¬ (¬A ∧ ¬B). In this approach all of the rules of [[natural deduction]] hold, except for proof by contradiction and disjunction introduction; moreover, <math>A \vdash B</math> does not mean necessarily that <math>\vdash A \Rightarrow B</math>, which is also a difference from natural deduction.<ref name="Hewitt 2008b">Hewitt (2008b)</ref> Also, the following usual Boolean properties hold: [[excluded middle]] and (for conjunction and disjunction) [[associativity]], [[commutativity]], [[distributivity]], [[De Morgan’s laws]], and [[idempotence]]. Furthermore, by defining the implication (A → B) as ¬ (A ∧ ¬B), there is a [[Deduction theorem#Paraconsistent_deduction_theorem|Two-Way Deduction Theorem]] allowing implications to be easily proved. [[Carl Hewitt]] favours this approach, claiming that having the usual Boolean properties, Natural Deduction, and Deduction Theorem are huge advantages in [[software engineering]]<ref name="Hewitt 2008a">Hewitt (2008a)</ref><ref name="Hewitt 2008b" />. Yet another approach is to do both simultaneously. In many systems of [[relevant logic]], as well as [[linear logic]], there are two separate disjunctive connectives. One allows disjunction introduction, and one allows disjunctive syllogism. Of course, this has the disadvantages entailed by separate disjunctive connectives including confusion between them and complexity in relating them. The three principles below, when taken together, also entail explosion, so at least one must be abandoned: {| border=1 align=center cellpadding=4 |[[Reductio ad absurdum]] |<math>A \to (B \wedge \neg B) \vdash \neg A</math> |- |[[Rule of weakening]] |<math>A \vdash B \to A</math> |- |[[Double negation elimination]] |<math>\neg \neg A \vdash A</math> |} Both reductio ad absurdum and the rule of weakening have been challenged in this respect, but without much success. Double negation elimination is challenged, but for unrelated reasons. By removing it alone, while upholding the other two one may still be able to prove all negative propositions from a contradiction. == A simple paraconsistent logic == Perhaps the most well-known system of paraconsistent logic is the simple system known as LP (“[[Logic of Paradox]]”), first proposed by the [[Argentina|Argentinian]] logician [[F. G. Asenjo]] in 1966 and later popularized by [[Graham Priest|Priest]] and others.<ref>Priest (2002), p. 306.</ref> One way of presenting the semantics for LP is to replace the usual [[function (mathematics)|functional]] valuation with a [[relation (mathematics)|relational]] one.<ref>LP is also commonly presented as a [[many-valued logic]] with three truth values (''true'', ''false'', and ''both'').</ref> The binary relation <math>V\,</math> relates a [[wff|formula]] to a [[truth value]]: <math>V(A,1)\,</math> means that <math>A\,</math> is true, and <math>V(A,0)\,</math> means that <math>A\,</math> is false. A formula must be assigned ''at least'' one truth value, but there is no requirement that it be assigned ''at most'' one truth value. The semantic clauses for [[negation]] and [[disjunction]] are given as follows: * <math>V( \neg A,1) \Leftrightarrow V(A,0)</math> * <math>V( \neg A,0) \Leftrightarrow V(A,1)</math> * <math>V(A \lor B,1) \Leftrightarrow V(A,1) \ or \ V(B,1)</math> * <math>V(A \lor B,0) \Leftrightarrow V(A,0) \ and \ V(B,0)</math> (The other [[logical connective]]s are defined in terms of negation and disjunction as usual.) Or to put the same point less symbolically: * ''not A'' is true [[if and only if]] ''A'' is false * ''not A'' is false if and only
