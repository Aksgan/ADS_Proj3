optimization techniques can be used to find them. ==Applications== ===Economics=== Constrained optimization plays a central role in [[economics]]. For example, the choice problem for a [[consumer theory|consumer]] is represented as one of maximizing a [[utility function]] subject to a [[budget constraint]]. The Lagrange multiplier has an economic interpretation as the [[shadow price]] associated with the constraint, in this example the [[marginal utility]] of [[income]]. ===Control theory=== In [[optimal control]] theory, the Lagrange multipliers are interpreted as [[costate]] variables, and Lagrange multipliers are reformulated as the minimization of the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]], in [[Pontryagin's minimum principle]]. ==The strong Lagrangian principle: Lagrange duality== {{anchor|Lagrange duality}} <!-- linked from redirect [[Lagrange duality]] --> Given a [[convex optimization]] problem in standard form :<math>\begin{align} \text{minimize } &f_0(x) \\ \text{subject to } &f_i(x) \leq 0,\ i \in \left \{1,\dots,m \right \} \\ &h_i(x) = 0,\ i \in \left \{1,\dots,p \right \} \end{align}</math> with the domain <math>\mathcal{D} \subset \mathbb{R}^n</math> having non-empty interior, the '''Lagrangian function''' <math>\Lambda: \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^m \times \mathbb{R}^p \to \mathbb{R} </math> is defined as : <math>\Lambda(x,\lambda,\nu) = f_0(x) + \sum_{i=1}^m \lambda_i f_i(x) + \sum_{i=1}^p \nu_i h_i(x).</math> The vectors <math>\lambda</math> and <math>\nu</math> are called the ''dual variables'' or ''Lagrange multiplier vectors'' associated with the problem. The '''Lagrange dual function''' <math>g:\mathbb{R}^m \times \mathbb{R}^p \to \mathbb{R} </math> is defined as : <math>g(\lambda,\nu) = \inf_{x\in\mathcal{D}} \Lambda(x,\lambda,\nu) = \inf_{x\in\mathcal{D}} \left ( f_0(x) + \sum_{i=1}^m \lambda_i f_i(x) + \sum_{i=1}^p \nu_i h_i(x) \right ).</math> The dual function ''g'' is concave, even when the initial problem is not convex. The dual function yields lower bounds on the optimal value <math>p^*</math> of the initial problem; for any <math>\lambda \geq 0 </math> and any <math>\nu</math> we have <math>g(\lambda,\nu) \leq p^* </math>. If a [[constraint qualification]] such as [[Slater's condition]] holds and the original problem is convex, then we have strong duality, i.e. <math>d^* = \max_{\lambda \ge 0, \nu} g(\lambda,\nu) = \inf f_0 = p^*</math>. ==See also== {{wikibooks|Calculus optimization methods|Lagrange multipliers}} * [[Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions]]: generalization of the method of Lagrange multipliers. * [[Lagrange multipliers on Banach spaces]]: another generalization of the method of Lagrange multipliers. == References == <references/> ==External links== Exposition *[http://www.slimy.com/~steuard/teaching/tutorials/Lagrange.html Conceptual introduction] (plus a brief discussion of Lagrange multipliers in the [[calculus of variations]] as used in physics) For additional text and interactive applets *[http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/ling848_fa2004/lagrange.html Simple explanation with an example of governments using taxes as Lagrange multipliers] *[http://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/18/18.02/f07/tools/LagrangeMultipliersTwoVariables.html Applet] *[http://www.math.gatech.edu/~carlen/2507/notes/lagMultipliers.html Tutorial and applet] *[http://midnighttutor.com/Lagrange_multiplier.html Video Lecture of Lagrange Multipliers] *[http://www.athenasc.com/NLP_Slides.pdf Slides accompanying Bertsekas's nonlinear optimization text], with details on Lagrange multipliers (lectures 11 and 12) *http://eom.springer.de/L/l057190.htm [[Category:Multivariable calculus]] [[Category:Mathematical optimization]] [[Category:Mathematical and quantitative methods (economics)]] [[ca:Multiplicadors de Lagrange]] [[de:Lagrange-Multiplikator]] [[es:Multiplicadores de Lagrange]] [[fr:Multiplicateur de Lagrange]] [[is:Lagrange-margfaldarar]] [[it:Metodo dei moltiplicatori di Lagrange]] [[he:כופלי לגראנז']] [[nl:Lagrange-multiplicator]] [[ja:ラグランジュの未定乗数法]] [[pl:Mnożniki Lagrange'a]] [[pt:Multiplicadores de Lagrange]] [[ro:Multiplicatorul Lagrange]] [[ru:Метод множителей Лагранжа]] [[fi:Lagrangen kertoimet]] [[sv:Lagrangemultiplikator]] [[uk:Метод невизначених множників]] [[zh:拉格朗日乘数]]</text> </page> <page> <id>21075</id> <title>Lagrangian</title> <text>{{About|Lagrange mechanics}} The '''Lagrangian''', ''L'', of a [[dynamical system]] is a function that summarizes the dynamics of the system. It is named after [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]]. The concept of a Lagrangian was originally introduced in a reformulation of [[classical mechanics]] by Irish mathematician [[William Rowan Hamilton]] known as [[Lagrangian mechanics]]. In classical mechanics, the Lagrangian is defined as the [[kinetic energy]], <math>T</math>, of the system minus its [[potential energy]], <math>V</math>.<ref name="Torby1984">{{cite book |last=Torby |first=Bruce |title=Advanced Dynamics for Engineers |series=HRW Series in Mechanical Engineering |year=1984 |publisher=CBS College Publishing |location=United States of America |isbn=0-03-063366-4 |chapter=Energy Methods}}</ref>{{rp|270}} In symbols, :<math>L = T - V.\quad</math> Under conditions that are given in [[Lagrangian mechanics]], if the Lagrangian of a system is known, then the [[equation of motion|equations of motion]] of the system may be obtained by a direct substitution of the expression for the Lagrangian into the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]], a particular family of [[partial differential equation]]s. == The Lagrange formulation == === Importance === The Lagrange formulation of mechanics is important not just for its broad applications, but also for its role in advancing deep understanding of [[physics]]. Although Lagrange only sought to describe [[classical mechanics]], the ''[[action principle]]'' that is used to derive the Lagrange equation is now recognized to be applicable to [[quantum mechanics]]. Physical [[action (physics)|action]] and quantum-mechanical [[phase (waves)|phase]] are related via [[Planck's constant]], and the [[principle of stationary action]] can be understood in terms of [[constructive interference]] of [[wave function]]s. The same principle, and the Lagrange formalism, are tied closely to [[Noether's theorem]], which relates physical [[conserved quantity|conserved quantities]] to continuous [[symmetry|symmetries]] of a physical system. Lagrangian mechanics and [[Noether's theorem]] together yield a natural formalism for [[first quantization]] by including [[commutators]] between certain terms of the Lagrangian equations of motion for a physical system. === Advantages over other methods === *The formulation is not tied to any one coordinate system—rather, any convenient variables <math>\varphi_i(s)</math> may be used to describe the system; these variables are called "[[generalized coordinates]]" and may be any independent variable of the system (for example, strength of the [[magnetic field]] at a particular location; [[angle]] of a pulley; position of a particle in space; or degree of excitation of a particular [[eigenmode]] in a complex system). This makes it easy to incorporate constraints into a theory by defining coordinates which only describe states of the system which satisfy the constraints. *If the Lagrangian is invariant under a symmetry, then the resulting equations of motion are also invariant under that symmetry. This is very helpful in showing that theories are consistent with either special relativity or general relativity. *Equations derived from a Lagrangian will almost automatically be unambiguous and consistent, unlike equations brought together from multiple formulations.{{Clarify|date=July 2010}} ==="Cyclic coordinates" and conservation laws=== <!-- [[Cyclic coordinate]] and [[Cyclic coordinates]] redirect here. Correct them accordingly if you modify the title of this section. --> An important property of the Lagrangian is that conservation laws can easily be read off from it. For example, if the Lagrangian <math>\mathcal L</math> depends on the ''time-derivative'' <math>\dot q_i</math> of a generalized coordinate, but ''not'' on <math>q_i</math> itself, then the ''generalized momentum'', :<math>p_i:=\frac{\partial\mathcal L}{\partial\dot q_i}</math>, is a conserved quantity. This is a special case of [[Noether's theorem]]. Such coordinates are
