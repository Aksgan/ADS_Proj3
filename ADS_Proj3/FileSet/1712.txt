Information in its [[Data Processor|Data Processing]] Division, and [[Systems engineering|Systems Engineering]] Manager and Systems Engineer in IBM World Trade Corporation. He also worked for Philco Corporation in its Computer Division, and for [[System Development Corporation]], working on two U.S. government large system contracts: SACCS (Strategic Air Command and Control System), and DCA (Defense Communication Agency Control System). == IT industry information businesses == In the years leading up to the formation of Gartner Group, Mr. Gartner was a partner at [[Oppenheimer & Co.]] He was voted the top individual technology analyst on Wall Street between the years 1972 and 1977 inclusive, in the annual poll of major banks, funds and other institutional investing firms, published by ''[[Institutional investor|Institutional Investor]]'' Magazine. <ref>[http://www.iimagazine.com/ II Magazine Americas<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.businessweek.com/archives/1995/b345357.arc.htm BW Online | December 4, 1995 | GIDEON GARTNER'S NEW TRUMPET<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> === Gartner Group === He founded Gartner Group (now called Gartner, Inc.) in 1979, and served as its CEO and Chairman through April 1991. IT "Advisory" firms are distinct from consultancies, in that they provide "continuous" advice to clients - defined in renewable (but open-ended) contracts which typically include a mix of "deliverables" including (but not limited to) content; client interaction with analysts and/or experts; and events. In 1979 the primary "advisory" firms in Information Technology (IT) were [[IDC]] (International Data Corporation, part of [[IDG]]), [[Dataquest]] (now part of Gartner), and [[Yankee Group]]. Gartner's innovations, which were aimed at creating an advisory model which would address the evolving and complex needs of IT professionals and firms, included: <ref>http://timeinc.net/b2/subscribers/articles/0,17863,513634-1,00.html </ref> #Selling to multiple constituencies #Financing #Nationwide sales organization #Sales measurement and compensation model #Peer-level advisors #Broad focus #Research process and organizational culture === Selling to multiple constituencies === At the time, other advisory firms usually sold to only computer hardware, software and services vendors. Exceptions at that time included Dataquest (selling a service for investors), and Input Corp. (selling a service for users). Gartner sold to vendors, plus users (generally large enterprises and other organizations, such as government agencies), plus investors and consulting firms. Investors were among the first targets, as Gartner had just resigned as partner of Oppenheimer & Co., but at Oppenheimer he had also begun servicing a group of Chief Information Officers (CIOs) of large corporations, which became the base for Gartner's enterprise activities. As Gartner Group's coverage of IBM was deep (IBM was the primary industry vendor at the time), other vendors desired to be tied into Gartner’s research network. Thus, the market Gartner addressed was unusually broad, and each constituency provided insights and information which benefitted others, arguably creating market advantage. === Financing === Gartner's [[venture capital]] financing was unique among advisory firms at the time. Gartner Group was initially financed by [[Bessemer Venture Partners]] and E.M. [[Warburg Pincus]], <ref>http://www.warburgpincus.com/portfolio/profiles/gartner.html </ref> with Bank Paribas joining a year later. This led to the firm being the first in its field to raise public capital in a 1986 offering, supporting its growth. === Nationwide sales organization === Raising capital from venture firms allowed Gartner to build a nationwide sales organization, the first of its kind in the industry. === Sales measurement and compensation model === Gartner instituted a sales measurement and compensation scheme, based upon how IBM had measured its rental sales, but novel when applied to consulting/advisory firms: since Gartner Group sold annual renewable contracts and recorded "Contract Value" , it based progress reporting and compensation (commission for sales personnel and bonus for analysts and managers), on the growth of appropriate Contract Value (CV) during a period of time; this was called Net Contract Value Increase (NCVI). Uniquely, compared with all prior consulting and advisory models, all variable compensation was based upon growth and not on revenue from renewals, an important factor in developing a strong growth culture. === Peer-level advisors === Having come from [[Wall Street]], Gartner adopted the idea of employing senior industry people, who were in fact "peers" of their prospective clients. This was a departure from the current industry practice at the time, where analysts were relatively young and relatively inexperienced albeit bright. === Broad focus === Instead of focusing primarily on market research, Gartner emphasized a basket of "values" including : [[G2]] (competitive intelligence and analysis), quantitative methods for clients to analyze residual values and obsolescence metrics of IT hardware, saving money within the IT organization, and IT education within clients’ staffs. === Research process and organizational culture === Gartner developed a disciplined "research process", which was documented in a Research Notebook, used in regular training programs at the firm. Process highlights called for analysts to "scan" all sources of input, be trained in recognizing "patterns", develop "new ideas" from these patterns, and "document" the results in brief one-page "research notes". General industry practice at the time was to publish relatively long reports. Gartner research "gimmicks" were introduced, such as the "stalking horse", a research collaborative tool whereby analysts were compelled to graphically present and defend their logic at research meetings. Thus, the "horse" became the company mascot. Intensive research meetings for all researchers were conducted at least weekly, and provided additional training and other benefits. Other innovations were introduced, in areas such as research-hiring interview methods, conferences including the breakthrough Symposium, inquiry systems to connect clients with internal analysts. All the above contributed to an unusually strong and acknowledged [[organizational culture]]. <ref>[http://www.mirainternational.com/books/corporation/CHAP02.htm The Vital Corporation - Chapter 2<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> === Growth === Gartner Group was ranked among the fastest growing private firms in the U.S. (by ''[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc. Magazine]]'') until it [[Initial public offering|went public]] in 1986, whereupon it was listed for several years among the best small companies in America (by ''[[BusinessWeek|Business Week]]'' , e.g. #9 overall, and #1 in profitability, in 1987). Gartner was sold to [[Saatchi & Saatchi]] in 1988,and Mr. Gartner signed a contract to remain as CEO until April 1991. In 1990, Mr.Gartner led a successful [[leveraged buyout]] of the firm financed by [[Information Partners]], a [[private equity fund]]
