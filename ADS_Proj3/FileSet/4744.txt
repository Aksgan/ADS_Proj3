San Francisco, California, October 5.</ref> They argued that the activities of users generating content (in the form of ideas, text, videos, or pictures) could be "harnessed" to create value. O'Reilly and Battelle contrasted Web 2.0 with what they called "Web 1.0". They associated Web 1.0 with the business models of [[Netscape]] and the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]. For example, {{bquote|Netscape framed "the web as platform" in terms of the old software paradigm: their flagship product was the web browser, a desktop application, and their strategy was to use their dominance in the browser market to establish a market for high-priced server products. Control over standards for displaying content and applications in the browser would, in theory, give Netscape the kind of market power enjoyed by Microsoft in the PC market. Much like the "horseless carriage" framed the automobile as an extension of the familiar, Netscape promoted a "webtop" to replace the desktop, and planned to populate that webtop with information updates and applets pushed to the webtop by information providers who would purchase Netscape servers.<ref>O’Reilly, T., 2005.</ref>}} In short, Netscape focused on creating software, updating it on occasion, and distributing it to the end users. O'Reilly contrasted this with [[Google]], a company which did not at the time focus on producing software, such as a browser, but instead focused on providing a service based on data such as the links Web page authors make between sites. Google exploits this user-generated content to offer Web search based on reputation through its "page rank" [[algorithm]]. Unlike software, which undergoes scheduled releases, such services are constantly updated, a process called "the perpetual beta". A similar difference can be seen between the Encyclopædia Britannica Online and [[Wikipedia]]: while the Britannica relies upon experts to create articles and releases them periodically in publications, Wikipedia relies on trust in anonymous users to constantly and quickly build content. Wikipedia is not based on expertise but rather an adaptation of the [[open source]] software adage [[Linus' Law|"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"]], and it produces and updates articles constantly. O'Reilly's Web 2.0 conferences have been held every year since 2004, attracting entrepreneurs, large companies, and technology reporters. In terms of the lay public, the term Web 2.0 was largely championed by bloggers and by technology journalists, culminating in the [[You (Time Person of the Year)|2006 ''TIME magazine'' Person of The Year]] (''You'').<ref>Grossman, Lev. 2006.

In the cover story, Lev Grossman explains: {{bquote|It's a story about community and collaboration on a scale never seen before. It's about the cosmic compendium of knowledge Wikipedia and the million-channel people's network [[YouTube]] and the online metropolis [[MySpace]]. It's about the many wresting power from the few and helping one another for nothing and how that will not only change the world, but also change the way the world changes.It's a story about community and collaboration on a scale never seen before.}} Since that time, Web 2.0 has found a place in the lexicon; in 2009 [[Global Language Monitor]] declared it to be the one-millionth [[English language|English]] word.<ref>"'Millionth English Word' declared".
