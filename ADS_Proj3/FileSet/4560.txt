With the aim of taking Turing's idea for a thinking machine, picturised in Hollywood movies such as Blade Runner, to a wider audience including children, Turing100 is set up to organise a special Turing test event, celebrating the 100th anniversary of Turing's birth in June 2012, at the place where the mathematician broke codes during the Second World War: Bletchley Park. The Turing100 team comprises [[Kevin Warwick]] (Chair), Huma Shah (coordinator), Ian Bland, Chris Chapman, Marc Allen; supporters include Rory Dunlop, Loebner winners [[Robby Garner]], and Fred Roberts. == Versions of the Turing test ==<!-- This title is linked to by the article Computing Machinery and Intelligence --> [[Image:The Imitation Game.png|thumb|The Imitation Game, as described by Alan Turing in "Computing Machinery and Intelligence." Player C, through a series of written questions, attempts to determine which of the other two players is a man, and which of the two is the woman. Player A, the man, tries to trick player C into making the wrong decision, while player B tries to help player C. Figure adapted from Saygin, 2000.<ref name="Saygin 2000"/>]] There are at least three primary versions of the Turing test, two of which are offered in "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" and one that Saul Traiger describes as the "Standard Interpretation."<ref name=Traiger2000>{{harvnb|Traiger|2000}}</ref> While there is some debate regarding whether the "Standard Interpretation" is that described by Turing or, instead, based on a misreading of his paper, these three versions are not regarded as equivalent,<ref name=Traiger2000 /> and their strengths and weaknesses are distinct.<ref>Saygin, A.P. (2008). Comments on “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” by Alan Turing. In R.Epstein, G. Roberts, G. Poland, (eds.) Parsing the Turing Test. Springer: Dordrecht, Netherlands</ref> ===The Imitation Game=== Turing's original game, as we have seen, described a simple party game involving three players. Player A is a man, player B is a woman and player C (who plays the role of the interrogator) is of either sex. In the Imitation Game, player C is unable to see either player A or player B, and can only communicate with them through written notes. By asking questions of player A and player B, player C tries to determine which of the two is the man and which is the woman. Player A's role is to trick the interrogator into making the wrong decision, while player B attempts to assist the interrogator in making the right one.<ref name="Saygin 2000"/> Sterret refers to this as the "Original Imitation Game Test,"<ref name=Moor2003 /> Turing proposes that the role of player A be filled by a computer. Thus, the computer's task is to pretend to be a woman and attempt to trick the interrogator into making an incorrect evaluation. The success of the computer is determined by comparing the outcome of the game when player A is a computer against the outcome when player A is a man. If, as Turing puts it, "the interrogator decide[s] wrongly as often when the game is played [with the computer] as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman",<ref name=T434/> it may be argued that the computer is intelligent.{{sfn|Shah|Warwick|2010}} and in contrast to Sterrett's opinion, posit that Turing did not expect the design of the machine to imitate a woman, when compared against a human. [[Image:Turing Test Version 1.png|thumb|The Original Imitation Game Test, in which the player A is replaced with a computer. The computer is now charged with the role of the woman, while player B continues to attempt to assist the interrogator. Figure adapted from Saygin, 2000.<ref name="Saygin 2000"/>]] The second version appears later in Turing's 1950 paper. As with the Original Imitation Game Test, the role of player A is performed by a computer, the difference being that the role of player B is now to be performed by a man rather than a woman. <blockquote>"Let us fix our attention on one particular digital computer ''C.'' Is it true that by modifying this computer to have an adequate storage, suitably increasing its speed of action, and providing it with an appropriate programme, ''C'' can be made to play satisfactorily the part of A in the imitation game, the part of B being taken by a man?"<ref name=T434/></blockquote> In this version, both player A (the computer) and player B are trying to trick the interrogator into making an incorrect decision. ===The standard interpretation=== Common understanding has it that the purpose of the Turing Test is not specifically to determine whether a computer is able to fool an interrogator into believing that it is a human, but rather whether a computer could ''imitate'' a human.<ref name="Saygin 2000"/> While there is some dispute whether this interpretation was intended by Turing — Sterrett believes that it was<ref name="Moor2003">{{Harvnb|Moor|2003}}</ref> and thus conflates the second version with this one, while others, such as Traiger, do not<ref name="Traiger2000" /> — this has nevertheless led to what can be viewed as the "standard interpretation." In this version, player A is a computer and player B a person of either gender. The role of the interrogator is not to determine which is male and which is female, but which is a computer and which is a human.<ref>{{harvnb|Traiger|2000|p=99}}</ref> ===Imitation Game vs. Standard Turing Test=== There has arisen some controversy over which of the alternative formulations of the test Turing intended.<ref name=Moor2003 /> Sterrett argues that two distinct tests can be extracted from his 1950 paper and that, ''pace'' Turing's remark, they are not equivalent. The test that employs the party game and compares frequencies of success is referred to as the "Original Imitation Game Test," whereas the test consisting of a human judge conversing with a human and a machine is referred to as the "Standard Turing Test," noting that Sterrett equates this with the "standard interpretation" rather than the second version of the imitation game. Sterrett agrees that the Standard Turing Test (STT) has the problems
