It is a fork of [[Trolltech]]'s [[Qtopia]] environment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.linuxdevices.com/links/LK3806469853.html |title=LinuxDevices.com: Project OPIE -- Qt-based apps and tools for handhelds |accessdate=2007-10-21 |date=2002-05-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070504212706/http://www.linuxdevices.com/links/LK3806469853.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-05-04}}</ref>. Opie features a personal information (PIM) framework as well as several other productivity applications. It has also extended multimedia capabilities, document model, networking and communication tools as well as multi-language support for more than a dozen languages. Based on common industry standards like XML, Obex, IrDa et al., Opie is capable of interacting with devices ranging from cell phones to server backends. Opie is highly optimized for mobile devices and tries to support the user with shortcuts and ease of use. Opie has undergone a long spell of slow development and eroding user and developer base, and only recently has seen a new surge of interest culminating with release 1.2.3 <ref>{{cite web |url=http://lwn.net/Articles/243675/ |title=lwn.net: Opie 1.2.3 Release Announcement |accessdate=2007-10-21 |date=2007-07-27}}</ref>. Opie images and applications can be built for most devices supported by [[OpenEmbedded]]. == Hardware support == Most common hardware devices are : *[[Compaq]] / [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] [[IPAQ]] series 31xx, 36xx, 37xx, 38xx, 39xx, 54xx, 55xx, 22xx, 41xx, 43xx, 47xx *[[Siemens]] [[SIMpad]] : CL4, SL4, SLC, T-Sinus *[[Sharp Zaurus]] : SL 5x00, SL 6000, C7x0, C8x0, C1000, C3x00 * GMate YopY * M&N Ramses * [[Archos]] Pocket Media Assistant The minimum requirements to run Opie are: *[[CPU]]: [[Intel 80386]], [[ARM architecture|ARM]], or better *Touch screen 320 x 240 [[pixel]]s *10 MB Flash memory == Distributions using Opie == Several Linux distributions for handheld devices include Opie, including: * [[Ångström distribution|Ångström]] * [[Familiar Linux]] * [[OpenZaurus]] * [[Jlime]] == See also == {{Portal|Free software}} * [[Familiar Linux]] * [[GPE Palmtop Environment]] * [[OpenEmbedded]] * [[OpenSync]] * [[Palm OS]] * [[Windows Mobile]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://opie.sourceforge.net Opie project site] {{DEFAULTSORT:Opie User Interface}} [[Category:Embedded Linux]] [[de:Open Palmtop Integrated Environment]] [[es:Opie]] [[ja:OPIE]] [[ru:OPIE]]</text> </page> <page> <id>26934</id> <title>OR gate</title> <text>{{About|OR in the sense of an electronic logic gate (e.g. CMOS 4071)|OR in the purely logical sense|Logical disjunction}} {{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}} {| class="wikitable" align=right |- bgcolor="#ddeeff" align="center" |colspan=2|'''INPUT'''<br>A B || '''OUTPUT'''<br> A + B |- bgcolor="#ddffdd" align="center" |0 || 0 || 0 |- bgcolor="#ddffdd" align="center" |0 || 1 || 1 |- bgcolor="#ddffdd" align="center" |1 || 0 || 1 |- bgcolor="#ddffdd" align="center" |1 || 1 || 1 |} The '''OR gate''' is a digital [[logic gate]] that implements [[logical disjunction]] - it behaves according to the [[truth table]] to the right. A HIGH output (1) results if one or both the inputs to the gate are HIGH (1). If neither input is HIGH, a LOW output (0) results. In another sense, the function of OR effectively finds the ''maximum'' between two binary digits, just as the complementary AND function finds the ''minimum''. ==Symbols== There are three symbols for OR gates: the American (ANSI or 'military') symbol and the IEC ('European' or 'rectangular') symbol, as well as the deprecated [[DIN]] symbol.

The standard 4000 series [[CMOS]] IC is the 4071, which includes four independent two-input OR gates. The traditional TTL version is the 7432. There are many offshoots of the original 7432 OR gate. All have the same pinout but different internal architecture, allowing them to operate in different voltage ranges and/or at higher speeds. In addition to the standard 2-Input OR Gate, 3- and 4-Input OR Gates are also available. In the CMOS series, these are: * 4075: Triple 3-Input OR Gate * 4072: Dual 4-Input OR Gate TTL variations include: * 74LS32: Quad 2-input OR gate (Low power [[Schottky barrier|Schottky]] version) * 74HC32: Quad 2-input OR gate (High Speed CMOS version) - has lower current consumption/wider Voltage range * 74LVC32: Low voltage CMOS version of the same. ==Hardware description language== module(a,b,c); input a,b; output c; or (c,a,b); end module; ==Implementations== {| |- | [[Image:NMOS OR gate.png|thumb]] || [[Image:CMOS OR.svg|thumb|CMOS OR Gate]] |} ===Alternatives=== [[Image:OR Using NAND.svg|frame|OR Gate Constructed Using Only NAND Gates]] If no specific OR gates are available, one can be made from NAND gates in the configuration shown below. Any logic gate can be made from a [[NAND logic|combination of NAND gates]] ==Wired-OR== With [[Logic level|active low]] [[open-collector]] logic outputs, as used for control signals in many circuits, an OR function can be produced by wiring together several outputs. This arrangement is called a ''wired OR''. This implementation of an OR function typically is also found in integrated circuits of N or P-type only transistor processes. ==See also== *[[AND gate]] *[[NOT gate]] *[[NAND gate]] *[[NOR gate]] *[[XOR gate]] *[[Boolean algebra (logic)]] *[[Logic gates]] {{Commons category|OR gates}} {{Logical connectives}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Or Gate}} [[Category:Logic gates]] [[ar:بوابة أو]] [[ca:Porta OR]] [[de:Oder-Gatter]] [[et:VÕI]] [[eu:EDO ate logikoa]] [[fr:Fonction OU]] [[hr:Logički sklop ILI (OR)]] [[la:Porta AUT]] [[nl:OR-poort]] [[ja:ORゲート]] [[ro:Poartă OR]] [[simple:OR gate]] [[sk:Hradlo OR]] [[sr:ИЛИ врата]] [[fi:OR]] [[tr:VEYA kapısı]] [[zh:或门]]</text> </page> <page> <id>26940</id> <title>OS/8</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=June 2007}} {{Infobox OS |name = OS/8 |logo = |screenshot = |caption = |developer = [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] |source_model = [[Closed source]] |kernel_type = |supported_platforms = [[PDP-8]] |ui = [[Command line interface]] |family = [[:Category:DEC Operating Systems|DEC OS family]] |latest_release_version = |latest_release_date = |marketing_target = |prog_language = [[BASIC]], [[Fortran]], [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]] |updatemodel = |package_manager = |working_state = Discontinued |license = [[Proprietary software|Proprietary]] |website = }} '''OS/8''' was
