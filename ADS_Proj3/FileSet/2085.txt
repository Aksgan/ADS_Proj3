might have. The extent of any crowding out depends on the shape of the LM curve. A shift in the IS curve along a relatively flat LM curve can increase output substantially with little change in the interest rate. On the other hand, an upward shift in the IS curve along a vertical LM curve will lead to higher interest rates, but no change in output (this case represents the [[Treasury View]]). Rightward shifts of the IS curve also result from [[exogeny|exogenous]] increases in investment spending (i.e., for reasons other than interest rates or income), in consumer spending, and in export spending by people outside the economy being modelled, as well as by exogenous decreases in spending on imports. Thus these too raise both equilibrium income and the equilibrium interest rate. Of course, changes in these variables in the opposite direction shift the IS curve in the opposite direction. The '''IS'''/'''LM''' model also allows for the role of [[monetary policy]]. If the money supply is increased, that shifts the '''LM''' curve downward, lowering interest rates and raising equilibrium national income. Further, exogenous decreases in liquidity preference, perhaps due to improved transactions technologies, lead to downward shifts of the LM curve and thus increases in income and decreases in interest rates. Changes in these variables in the opposite direction shift the LM curve in the opposite direction. ==Incorporation into larger models== By itself, the IS-LM model is used to study the short run when [[price level|prices]] are fixed or sticky and no [[inflation]] is taken into consideration. But in practice the main role of the model is as a sub-model of larger models (especially the [[Aggregate Demand-Aggregate Supply model]]) which allow for a flexible [[price level]]. In the aggregate demand-aggregate supply model, each point on the aggregate demand curve is an outcome of the IS-LM model for aggregate demand Y based on a particular price level. Starting from one point on the aggregate demand curve, at a particular price level and a quantity of aggregate demand implied by the IS-LM model for that price level, if one considers a higher potential price level, in the IS-LM model the real money supply M/P will be lower and hence the LM curve will be shifted higher, leading to lower aggregate demand; hence at the higher price level the level of aggregate demand is lower, so the aggregate demand curve is negatively sloped. == See also == * [[AD-AS model]] * [[AD-IA Model]] * [[Mundell-Fleming model]] * [[Policy-mix]] * [[Money demand]] == References == {{Citation style|date=September 2009}} {{reflist}} ==External links== {{commonscat|IS-LM model diagrams}} * Elmer G.

It comprises three parts: *[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=50678 Part 1: Framework ] *[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=34387 Part 2: Mechanisms producing independent tokens] *[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=34388 Part 3: Mechanisms producing linked tokens] == Part 1: Framework == In this first part of ISO/IEC 18014, several things are explained and developed: * The identification of the objectives of a time authority. * The description of a general model on which time stamping services are based. * The definition of time stamping services. * The definition of the basic protocols of time stamping. * The specifications of the protocols between the involved entities. '''Key words''': audit, non-repudiation, security, time-stamp == Part 2: Mechanisms producing independent tokens == A time-stamping service provides evidence that a data item existed before a certain point in time. Time-stamp services produce time-stamp tokens, which are data structures containing a verifiable cryptographic binding between a data item's representation and a time-value. This part of ISO/IEC 18014 defines time-stamping mechanisms that produce independent tokens, which can be verified one by one. == Part 3: Mechanisms producing linked tokens == This part of ISO/IEC 18014: * Describes a general model for time-stamping services producing linked tokens. * Describes the basic components used to construct a time-stamping service of this type. * Defines the data structures used to interact with a time-stamping service of this type. * Describes specific instances of such time-stamping services. ISO/IEC 18014-3:2004 describes time-stamping services producing linked tokens, that is, tokens that are cryptographically bound to other tokens produced by these time-stamping services. It describes a general model for time-stamping services of this type and the basic components used to construct a time-stamping service of this type, it defines the data structures and protocols used to interact with a time-stamping service of this type, and it describes specific instances of such time-stamping services. == References == * [http://www.iso.org/iso/search.htm?qt=18014&type=simple&published=on ISO catalog] {{crypto navbox}} {{ISO standards}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Iso/Iec 18014}} [[Category:ISO standards|#18014]] [[Category:Cryptography standards]] {{crypto-stub}} [[yo:ISO/IEC 18014]]</text> </page> <page> <id>17706</id> <title>ISO 10303</title> <text>{{More footnotes|date=January 2010}} '''ISO 10303''' is an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard for the [[computer]]-interpretable [[representation]] and [[Trade|exchange]] of [[Product Manufacturing Information|product manufacturing information]].
