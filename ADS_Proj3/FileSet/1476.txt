18 months' time a system that would not be significantly better -if indeed any better- than the FP6000."<ref>Campbell-Kelly, pg. 222</ref> ICT chose to move forward with the FP-6000 with minor modifications, and used it as the basis for their [[ICT 1900]] line through the 1960s.<ref>Vardalas</ref> Existing contracts for the Orion 2 were filled, and sales ended. ==Description== Although the Orion and Orion 2 differed significantly in their internals, their programming interface and external peripherals were almost identical. The basic Orion machine included 4,096 [[48-bit]] words of slow, 12µs, [[core memory]], which could be expanded to 16,384 words.<ref name=sys/> Each word could be organized as eight 6-bit characters, a single 48-bit binary number, or a single floating-point number with 40-bits of "fraction" and an 8-bit exponent. The system included built-in capabilities for working with [[Pound sterling]] before decimalization.<ref>''System'', pg. 8</ref> The core memory was backed by one or two [[magnetic drum]]s with 16k words each.<ref name="System, pg. 18">''System'', pg. 18</ref> Various offline input/output included [[magnetic disk]]s, [[tape drive]]s, [[punched card]]s, [[punched tape]] and printers. Most of the Orion's [[instruction set]] used a three-address form, with sixty-four 48-bit accumulators. Each program had its own private accumulator set which were the first 64 registers of its address space, which was a reserved contiguous subset of the physical store, defined by the contents of a "datum" relocation register. Operand addresses were relative to the datum, and could be modified by one of the accumulators for indexing arrays and similar tasks. A basic three-address instruction took a minimum of 64 µs, a two-address one 48 µs, and any index modifications on the addresses added 16 µs per modified address. Multiplication took from 156 to 172 µs, and division anywhere from 564 to 1,112 µs, although the average time was 574 µs.<ref name="System, pg. 18"/> The Orion 2, having a core store with a much shorter cycle time, was considerably faster. A key feature of the Orion system was its built-in support for [[time-sharing]]. This was supported by a series of [[input/output]] (I/O) interrupts, or what they referred to as "lockouts". The system automatically switched programs during the time spent waiting for the end of an I/O operation. The Orion also supported [[protected memory]] in the form of pre-arranged "reservations". Starting and stopping programs, as well as selecting new ones to run when one completed, was the duty of the "Organisation Program."<ref>''System'', pg. 16</ref> The Orion was one of the earliest machines to directly support time-sharing in hardware in spite of intense industry interest; other time-sharing systems of the same era include [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO]] in early 1961, [[Compatible Time-Sharing System|CTSS]] later that year, and the [[English Electric KDF9]] and FP-6000 of 1964. The Orion is also notable for the use of its own high-level business language, [[Ferranti NEBULA|NEBULA]]. Nebula was created because of Ferranti's perception that the [[COBOL]] standard of 1960 was not sufficiently powerful for their machines, notably as COBOL was developed in the context of decimal, character-oriented [[batch processing]], while Orion was a binary word-oriented multiprogramming system. NEBULA adapted many of COBOL's basic concepts, adding new ones of their own.<ref>A.

Designed to be used in smaller offices without a dedicated programming staff, the Sirius used decimal arithmetic instead of binary, supported [[Autocode]] to ease programming, was designed to fit behind a standard office desk, and ran on U.K. standard 230 V mains electricity with no need for cooling. It was also fairly slow, with instruction speeds around 4,000 operations per second, and a [[main memory]] based on [[delay line memory|delay lines]], but as Ferranti pointed out, its [[price/performance ratio]] was difficult to beat. ==History== ====Magnetic amplifiers==== During the 1950s there was widespread interest in the use of [[magnetic amplifier]]s as a [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] switching device.<ref>[http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/accession/X238.83 "Univac Solid State 80/90 Magnetic Amplifier and Experimental Board"]</ref> The amplifiers used the saturation points and [[hysteresis]] curves of a [[magnetic core]] to sum a number of inputs and settle to a single output state. The various logical functions were achieved by linearly adding the input signals on control lines and generating an output signal if the sum exceeded a fixed threshold, defined by the saturation property of the magnetic core. This process came to be known as "Ballot Box Logic" due to the way the inputs "voted" on the output. One difference between magnetic logic and conventional tube or transistor systems is that it is the current that defines the logic levels, not voltage.<ref name=s>Scarrott</ref> Since the magnetic cores were open in the middle, any number of control lines could be threaded through
