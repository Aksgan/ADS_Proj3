minimal impact on other mission capabilities: this is the suggestion contained in<ref name=SP80030/> == Risk communication == {{main|Risk_management#Risk_communication}} Risk communication is a horizontal process that interacts bidirectionally with all other processes of risk management. Its purpose is to establish a common understanding of all aspect of risk among all the organization's stakeholder. Establishing a common understanding is important, since it influences decisions to be taken. == Risk monitoring and review == Risk management is an ongoing, never ending process. Within this process implemented security measures are regularly monitored and reviewed to ensure that they work as planned and that changes in the environment rendered them ineffective. Business requirements, vulnerabilities and threats can change over the time. Regular audits should be scheduled and should be conducted by an independent party, i.e. somebody not under the control of whom is responsible for the implementations or daily management of [[ISMS]]. == IT evaluation and assessment == Security controls should be validated. Technical controls are possible complex systems that are to tested and verified. The hardest part to validate is people knowledge of procedural controls and the effectiveness of the real application in daily business of the security procedures.<ref name=SP80030/> [[Vulnerability assessment]], both internal and external, and [[Penetration test]] are instruments for verifying the status of security controls. [[Information technology security audit]] is a an organizational and procedural control with the aim of evaluating security. The IT systems of most organization are evolving quite rapidly. Risk management should cope with this changes through change authorization after risk re evaluation of the affected systems and processes and periodically review the risks and mitigation actions.<ref name=Vacca/> Monitoring system events according to a security monitoring strategy, an incident response plan and security validation and metrics are fundamental activities to assure that an optimal level of security is obtained.<br /> It is important to monitor the new vulnerabilities, apply procedural and technical security controls like regularly [[Patch (computing)|updating software]], and evaluate other kinds of controls to deal with [[zero-day attack]]s. The attitude of involved people to [[benchmark]] against [[best practice]] and follow the seminars of [[professional association]]s in the sector are factors to assure the state of art of an organization IT risk management practice. == Integrating risk management into system development life cycle == Effective risk management must be totally integrated into the [[Systems Development Life Cycle|SDLC]]. An IT systemâ€™s SDLC has five phases: initiation, development or acquisition, implementation, operation or maintenance, and disposal. The risk management methodology is the same regardless of the SDLC phase for which the assessment is being conducted. Risk management is an iterative process that can be performed during each major phase of the SDLC.<ref Name=SP80030/> {|class="wikitable" |+ align="center" |'''Table 2-1 Integration of Risk Management into the SDLC'''<ref Name=SP80030/> |- !

Decisions regarding risks identified must be made prior to system operation |- | style=white-space:nowrap|Phase 4: Operation or Maintenance||The system performs its functions. Typically the system is being modified on an ongoing basis through the addition of hardware and software and by changes to organizational processes, policies, and procedures||Risk management activities are performed for periodic system reauthorization (or reaccreditation) or whenever major changes are made to an IT system in its operational, production environment (e.g., new system interfaces) |- | Phase 5: Disposal||This phase may involve the disposition of information, hardware, and software. Activities may include moving, archiving, discarding, or destroying information and sanitizing the hardware and software||Risk management activities are performed for system components that will be disposed of or replaced to ensure that the hardware and software are properly disposed of, that residual data is appropriately handled, and that system migration is conducted in a secure and systematic manner |- | |} [[NIST]] SP 800-64<ref name=NIST80064>[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-64-Rev2/SP800-64-Revision2.pdf 800-64 NIST Security Considerations in the Information System Development Life Cycle]</ref> is devoted to this topic. Early integration of security in the SDLC enables agencies to maximize return on investment in their security programs, through:<ref name=NIST80064/> * Early identification and mitigation of security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, resulting in lower cost of security control implementation and vulnerability mitigation; * Awareness of potential engineering challenges caused by mandatory security controls; * Identification of shared [[Security service (telecommunication)|security services]] and reuse of security strategies and tools to reduce development cost and schedule while improving security posture through proven methods and techniques; and * Facilitation of informed executive decision making through comprehensive risk management in a timely manner. This guide<ref name=NIST80064/> focuses on the information security components of the SDLC. First, descriptions of the key security roles and responsibilities that are needed in most information system developments are provided. Second, sufficient information about the SDLC is provided to allow a person who is unfamiliar with the SDLC process to understand the relationship between information security and the SDLC. The document integrates the security steps into the linear, sequential (a.k.a. waterfall) SDLC. The five-step SDLC cited in the document is an example of one method of development and is not intended to mandate this methodology. Lastly, SP 800-64 provides insight into IT projects and initiatives that are not as clearly defined as SDLC-based developments, such as service-oriented architectures, cross-organization projects, and IT facility developments. Security can be incorporated into information systems acquisition, development and maintenance by implementing effective
