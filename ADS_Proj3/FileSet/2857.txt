in normal breast tissue. Cancerous tumors require an ever-increasing supply of nutrients and therefore increase circulation to their cells by holding open existing blood vessels, opening dormant vessels, and creating new ones (neoangiogenesis). This process frequently results in an increase in regional surface temperatures of the breast. Digital infrared imaging uses extremely sensitive medical infrared cameras and sophisticated computers to detect, analyze, and produce high-resolution diagnostic images of these temperature variations. Because of DII's sensitivity, these temperature variations may be among the earliest signs of breast cancer and/or a pre-cancerous state of the breast<ref>http://www.breastthermography.com/breast_thermography_mf.htm</ref>. === Tomography === {{Main|Computed tomography}} [[Tomography]] is the method of imaging a single plane, or slice, of an object resulting in a [[tomogram]]. There are several forms of [[tomography]]: * Linear tomography: This is the most basic form of tomography. The X-ray tube moved from point "A" to point "B" above the patient, while the cassette holder (or "bucky") moves simultaneously under the patient from point "B" to point "A." The [[Lever|fulcrum]], or pivot point, is set to the area of interest. In this manner, the points above and below the [[focal plane]] are blurred out, just as the background is blurred when panning a camera during exposure. No longer carried out and replaced by [[computed tomography]]. * Poly tomography: This was a complex form of tomography. With this technique, a number of geometrical movements were programmed, such as hypocycloidic, circular, figure 8, and elliptical. Philips Medical Systems [http://www.medical.philips.com/main/index.asp] produced one such device called the 'Polytome.' This unit was still in use into the 1990s, as its resulting images for small or difficult physiology, such as the inner ear, was still difficult to image with CTs at that time. As the resolution of CTs got better, this procedure was taken over by the CT. * Zonography: This is a variant of linear tomography, where a limited arc of movement is used. It is still used in some centres for visualising the kidney during an intravenous urogram (IVU). *Orthopantomography (OPT or OPG): The only common tomographic examination in use. This makes use of a complex movement to allow the radiographic examination of the mandible, as if it were a flat bone. It is often referred to as a "Panorex", but this is incorrect, as it is a trademark of a specific company. *Computed Tomography (CT), or Computed Axial Tomography (CAT: A CT scan, also known as a [[CAT scan]]), is a helical tomography (latest generation), which traditionally produces a 2D image of the structures in a thin section of the body. It uses [[X-ray]]s. It has a greater [[ionizing radiation]] dose burden than projection radiography; repeated scans must be limited to avoid health effects. CT is based on the same principles as X-Ray projections but in this case, the patient is enclosed in a surrounding ring of detectors assigned with 500-1000 scintillation detectors<ref name="Dhawan P 2003"/> . This being the fourth-generation X-Ray CT scanner geometry. Previously in older generation scanners, the X-Ray beam was paired by a translating source and detector. ===Ultrasound=== {{Main|Medical ultrasonography}} [[Image:UltrasoundBPH.jpg|thumb|right|Ultrasound representation of [[Urinary bladder]] (black butterfly-like shape) and hyperplastic [[prostate]]]] [[Medical ultrasonography]] uses high frequency [[broadband]] sound waves in the [[megahertz]] range that are reflected by tissue to varying degrees to produce (up to 3D) images. This is commonly associated with imaging the [[fetus]] in pregnant women. Uses of ultrasound are much broader, however. Other important uses include imaging the abdominal organs, heart, breast, muscles, tendons, arteries and veins. While it may provide less anatomical detail than techniques such as CT or MRI, it has several advantages which make it ideal in numerous situations, in particular that it studies the function of moving structures in real-time, emits no [[ionizing radiation]], and contains [[speckle]] that can be used in [[elastography]]. Ultrasound is also used as a popular research tool for capturing raw data, that can be made available through an [[Ultrasound research interface]], for the purpose of tissue characterization and implementation of new image processing techniques. The concepts of ultrasound differ from other medical imaging modalities in the fact that it is operated by the transmission and receipt of sound waves. The high frequency sound waves are sent into the tissue and depending on the composition of the different tissues; the signal will be attenuated and returned at separate intervals. A path of reflected sound waves in a multilayered structure can be defined by an input acoustic impedance( Ultrasound sound wave) and the Reflection and transmission coefficients of the relative structures<ref name="Dhawan P 2003"/> . It is very safe to use and does not appear to cause any adverse effects, although information on this is not well documented. It is also relatively inexpensive and quick to perform. Ultrasound scanners can be taken to critically ill patients in intensive care units, avoiding the danger caused while moving the patient to the radiology department. The real time moving image obtained can be used to guide drainage and biopsy procedures. Doppler capabilities on modern scanners allow the blood flow in arteries and veins to be assessed. == Medical imaging topics == ===Maximizing imaging procedure use=== The amount of data obtained in a single MR or CT scan is very extensive. Some of the data that radiologists discard could save patients time and money, while reducing their exposure to radiation and risk of complications from invasive procedures.<ref>Freiherr G.

To produce 3D images, many scans are made, then combined by computers to produce a 3D model, which can then be manipulated by the physician. 3D ultrasounds are produced using a somewhat similar technique.
