It is a group owned by the [[Raymond Noorda|Noorda]] family, also founders of Novell. Until February 2005, Canopy held SCO shares, and the management of SCO held shares of Canopy. The two parties became embroiled in a bitter dispute when the Noorda family sought to oust board member [[Ralph Yarro III]] on claims of [[misappropriation]]. With internal problems not made public (which included the suicides of Canopy's director of [[information systems]], [[Robert Penrose]],<ref>[http://blog.mecworks.com/articles/2004/12/26/rob-penrose/] Rob Penrose</ref> and [[Val Kriedel]], the daughter of [[Ray Noorda]]<ref>[http://www.nndb.com/people/536/000108212/] Noorda bio</ref>),<ref>[http://www.heraldextra.com/content/view/125977/ Daily Herald - Canopy founder's daughter found dead<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,600111043,00.html] Canopy at Heart of Feud</ref><ref>[http://www.smallworks.com/archives/00000250.htm] Sex, Drugs, and Unix</ref> the Canopy Group agreed to buy back all the shares that SCO had in Canopy in exchange for their SCO shares and cash.

After a small number of high profile sales (including one that was denied by the claimed purchaser), SCO claimed to offer corporate users of Linux a license at $699 (USD) per processor running Linux. However, many individuals have found it impossible to buy such a license from SCO. SCO says that participants of the SCOsource initiative are not liable for any claims that SCO makes against Linux users. ===The Michael Davidson E-Mail=== On July 14, 2005, an email<ref>http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/IBM-459-22.pdf</ref> was unsealed that had been sent from Michael Davidson to Reg Broughton (both Caldera employees) in [[2002]], before many of the lawsuits. In it, Davidson reported how the company had hired an outside consultant because {{cquote|of SCO's executive management refusing to believe that it was possible for Linux and much of the GNU software to have come into {{sic|existance}} without *someone* *somewhere* having copied pieces of proprietary UNIX source code to which SCO owned the copyright. The hope was that we would find a "smoking gun" {{sic|somwhere}} in code that was being used by Red Hat and/or the other Linux companies that would give us some leverage. (There was, at one stage, the idea that we would sell licences to corporate customers who were using Linux as a kind of "insurance policy" in case it turned out that they were using code which infringed on our copyright).}} The consultant was to review the Linux code and compare it to Unix source code, to find possible copyright infringement. Davidson himself said that he had not expected to find anything significant based on his own knowledge of the code and had voiced his opinion that it was "a waste of time". After 4 to 6 months of consultant's work, Davidson says, ''"we had found absolutely *nothing*. i.e. no evidence of any copyright infringement whatsoever."'' ==See also== {{Portal|Free software}} *[[Timeline of SCO-Linux controversies]] *[[:Category:SCO-Linux litigation]] *[[Copyfraud]] ==References== {{Reflist|2}} ==External links== *[http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:mwSxZWFQPfEJ:www.groklaw.net/articlebasic.php%3Fstory%3D20061009152706664+Lawrence+R.+Goldfarb,+microsoft&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=2&gl=us Groklaw link to Lawrence Goldfarb's declaration to the court] *[http://www.thescogroup.com The SCO Group] - Official website *[http://www.fsf.org/licensing/sco/ Free Software Foundation position regarding SCO's attacks] 6 essays, by [[Eben Moglen]], [[Richard Stallman]], and [[Bradley Kuhn]] *[http://www.groklaw.net Groklaw] - An online community dedicated to following the progress of the various lawsuits and investigating the claims SCO makes *[http://sco.tuxrocks.com Tuxrocks] - An archive of court documents related to the various lawsuits *{{dmoz|Computers/Software/Operating_Systems/Unix/SCO/Boycott,_Lawsuits/|SCO Boycott and Lawsuits}} *[http://www.linux.org/news/sco/timeline.html SCO Controversy Timeline] *[http://www.osdl.net/newsroom/articles/2006_articles_position_papers.html/osdl-second-statement.html SCO:Without Fear and Without Research] *[http://www.legadoassociates.com/linuxlawsuit.htm Linux's lucky lawsuit] - Why the SCO lawsuit is a good thing in the long run *[http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20050714144923365 The Michael Davidson Email] *[http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-5811081.html Novell hits back at SCO in Unix dispute] *[http://www.zdnet.com/news/fact-and-fiction-in-the-microsoft-sco-relationship/139743 Fact and fiction in the Microsoft-SCO relationship] {{linux}} {{FOSS}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Sco-Linux Controversies}} [[Category:Computer law]] [[Category:SCO-Linux litigation]] [[de:SCO gegen Linux]] [[es:Disputa sobre la autoría de Linux]] [[fr:SCO contre Linux]] [[sv:SCOs rättstvister]]</text> </page> <page> <id>32723</id> <title>SCR-784</title> <text>The '''SCR-784''' was a fire control [[radar]] set used by the [[U.S. Army]] designed to be an amphibious version of the [[SCR-584]], and mounted on a searchlight trailer called a K-84.
