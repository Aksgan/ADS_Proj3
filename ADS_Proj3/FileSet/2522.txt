must have ''neither to go > Alice to go''. But Bob has personal liberty too, so the joint preference must have ''Alice to go > both to go'' and ''neither to go > Bob to go''. Combining these gives *Joint preference: ''neither to go > Alice to go > both to go > Bob to go'' and in particular ''neither to go > both to go''. So the result of these individual preferences and personal liberty is that neither go to see the film. But this is Pareto inefficient given that Alice and Bob each think ''both to go > neither to go''. {| class="wikitable" border="1" ! colspan="2" rowspan="2" | ! colspan="3" | Bob |- ! Goes ! !

The numbers represent ranks in Alice and Bob's personal preferences, relevant for Pareto efficiency (thus, either 4,3 or 2,4 is better than 1,1 and 4,3 is better than 3,2 – making 4,3 and 2,4 the two solutions). The arrows represent transitions suggested by the individual preferences over which each has liberty, clearly leading to the solution for ''neither to go''. == Liberalism and externalities == The example shows that liberalism and Pareto-efficiency cannot always be attained at the same time. Hence, if liberalism exists in just a rather constrained way,<ref>{{cite book|last=Sen|first=Amartya|title=Collective Choice and Social Welfare|origyear=1970|year=1984}} :ch. 6.4 "Critique of Liberal Values" :ch. 6.5, "Critique of the Pareto Principle" :ch. 6*, "The Liberal Paradox"</ref> then Pareto-inefficiency could arise. Note that this is not always the case. For instance if one individual makes use of her liberal right to decide between two alternatives, chooses one of them and society would also prefer this alternative, no problem arises. Nevertheless, the general case will be that there are some externalities. For instance, one individual is free to go to work by car or by bicycle. If the individual takes the car and drives to work, whereas society wants him to go to work by bicycle there will be an externality. However, no one can force the other to prefer cycling. So, one implication of Sen's paradox is that these externalities will exist wherever liberalism exists. ==Ways out of the paradox== There are several ways to resolve the paradox. *First, the way Sen preferred, the individuals may decide simply to "respect" each other's choice by constraining their own choice. Assume that individual A orders three alternatives (x, y, z) according to x P y P z and individual B orders the same alternative according to z P x P y: according to the above reasoning, it will be impossible to achieve a Pareto-efficient outcome. But, if A refuses to decide over z and B refuses to decide over x, then for A follows x P y (x is chosen), and for B z P y (z is chosen). Hence A chooses x and respects that B chooses z; B chooses z and respects that A chooses x. So, the Pareto-efficient solution can be reached, if A and B constrain themselves and accept the freedom of the other player. *A second way out of the paradox {{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} draws from game theory by assuming that individuals A and B pursue self-interested actions, when they decide over alternatives or pairs of alternatives. Hence, the collective outcome will be Pareto-inferior as the prisoner's dilemma predicts. The way out (except Tit-For-Tat) will be to sign a contract, so trading away one's right to act selfishly and get the other's right to act selfishly in return. *A third possibility {{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} starts with assuming that again A and B have different preferences towards four states of the world, w, x, y, and z. A's preferences are given by w P x P y P z; B's preferences are given by y P z P w P x. Now, liberalism implies that each individual is a dictator in a least one social area. Hence, A and B should be allowed to decide at least over one pair of alternatives. For A, the "best" pair will be (w,z), because w is most preferred and z is least preferred. Hence A can decide that w is chosen and at the same time make sure that z is not chosen. For B, the same applies and implies, that B would most preferably decide between y and x. Furthermore assume that A is not free to decide (w,z), but has to choose between y and x. Then A will choose x. Conversely, B is just allowed to choose between w and z and eventually will rest with z. The collective outcome will be (x,z), which is Pareto-inferior. Hence again A and B can make each other better off by employing a contract and trading away their right to decide over (x,y) and (w,z). The contract makes sure that A decides between w and z and chooses w. B decides between (x,y) and chooses y. The collective outcome will be (w,y), the Pareto-optimal result. Taken all together all three ways do not resolve the paradox as such. But, they answer the question: What can society do, if the paradox applies and no corresponding social decision function can handle the trade off between Pareto-optimality and liberalism? One sees that mutual acceptance and self-constraints or even contracts to trade away actions or rights are needed. ==References== {{Reflist}} [[Category:Paradoxes]] [[Category:Social choice theory]] [[Category:Economics theorems]] [[Category:Articles with Alice and Bob explanations]] [[de:Paradox des Liberalismus]]</text> </page> <page> <id>21584</id> <title>Libquantum</title> <text>{{lowercase|libquantum}} '''libquantum''' is a [[C (programming language)|C]] [[library (computer science)|library]] [[Quantum virtual machine]] for the simulation of a [[quantum computer]].
