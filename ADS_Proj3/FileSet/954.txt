topological requirement that a universal cover be [[simply connected]] translates in graph-theoretic terms to a requirement that it be acyclic and connected; that is, a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]]. The universal covering graph is unique (up to isomorphism). If ''G'' is a tree, then ''G'' itself is the universal covering graph of ''G''. For any other finite connected graph ''G'', the universal covering graph of ''G'' is a countably infinite (but locally finite) tree. The universal covering graph ''T'' of a connected graph ''G'' can be constructed as follows. Choose an arbitrary vertex ''r'' of ''G'' as a starting point. Each vertex of ''T'' is a non-backtracking walk that begins from ''r'', that is, a sequence ''w'' = (''r'', ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>n</sub>) of vertices of ''G'' such that * ''v''<sub>''i''</sub> and ''v''<sub>''i''+1</sub> are adjacent in ''G'' for all ''i'', i.e., ''w'' is a walk * ''v''<sub>''i''-1</sub> ≠ ''v''<sub>''i''+1</sub> for all ''i'', i.e., w is non-backtracking. Then, two vertices of ''T'' are adjacent if one is a simple extension of another: the vertex (''r'', ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''</sub>) is adjacent to the vertex (''r'', ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''-1</sub>). Up to isomorphism, the same tree ''T'' is constructed regardless of the choice of the starting point ''r''. The covering map ''f'' maps the vertex (''r'') in ''T'' to the vertex ''r'' in ''G'', and a vertex (''r'', ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''</sub>) in ''T'' to the vertex ''v''<sub>''n''</sub> in ''G''. ===Examples of universal covers=== The following figure illustrates the universal covering graph ''T'' of a graph ''H''; the colours indicate the covering map. :[[File:Covering-graph-5.svg]] For any ''k'', all ''k''-[[regular graph]]s have the same universal cover: the infinite ''k''-regular tree. ==Voltage graphs== A common way to form covering graphs uses [[voltage graph]]s, in which the darts of the given graph ''G'' (that is, pairs of directed edges corresponding to the undirected edges of ''G'') are labeled with inverse pairs of elements from some [[group (mathematics)|group]]. The derived graph of the voltage graph has as its vertices the pairs (''v'',''x'') where ''v'' is a vertex of ''G'' and ''x'' is a group element; a dart from ''v'' to ''w'' labeled with the group element ''y'' in ''G'' corresponds to an edge from (''v'',''x'') to (''w'',''xy'') in the derived graph. The universal cover can be seen in this way as a derived graph of a voltage graph in which the edges of a [[spanning tree]] of the graph are labeled by the identity element of the group, and each remaining pair of darts is labeled by a distinct generating element of a [[free group]]. The bipartite double can be seen in this way as a derived graph of a voltage graph in which each dart is labeled by the nonzero element of the group of order two. ==Notes== {{reflist|2}} ==References== * [[Chris Godsil]] and [[Gordon Royle]]: ''Algebraic Graph Theory'', Springer, 2004.

It was founded by Nicole Yee in 2001, as a hobby website dedicated to Asian women. Subsequently, the concept of sharing product and service information and opinions gathered a steady community, turning it into a venture business. ''CozyCot'' users interact in the forum and by reviewing beauty products (the review system produced reviews for over 35,000 products), also in the live events organized by the staff. The importance of its review database is increased by an [[iPhone]] scanner software developed by ''CozyCot'', which allows users to pull up product reviews from the website by capturing the barcodes with cameras in their iPhones. In April 2010, ''CozyCot'' launched the newspaper with the same name. == History == ''CozyCot'' started in November 2001 as an Internet portal based in [[Singapore]], where members could post reviews and share shopping and fashion tips and opinions.<ref name="The Straits Times">{{cite web | title = Net winners | author= Tham Yuen-C and Phebe Bay | publisher = [[The Straits Times]] | date = May 26, 2010 | url = http://www.straitstimes.com/DigitalLife/Work/Story/STIStory_531313.html | accessdate = May 27, 2010}}</ref> As the online community grew, the founder Nicole Yee began organizing live events for members, in order to get together.
