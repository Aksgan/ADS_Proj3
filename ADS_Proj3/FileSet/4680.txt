However, the user is able to include an "expiration date," after which the information is no longer usable by anyone who may have a copy of it, even the creator.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/security/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=218600444 | title = 'Privacy Tool Makes Internet Postings Vanish '|accessdate=2009-07-24|publisher=InformationWeek}}</ref> ==Theory== Vanish acts by automating the encryption of information entered by the user with an [[encryption key]] that is unknown to the user. Along with the actual information the user enters, he or she also enters [[metadata]] concerning how long the information should remain available. The system then encrypts the information, but does not store either the encryption key or the, instead breaking up the decryption key into smaller components that are disseminated across [[distributed hash tables|distributed hash tables, or DHTs]] via the internet. The DHTs refresh information within their nodes on a set schedule unless told to persist the information. The time-delay entered by the user in the metadata controls how long the DHTs should allow the information to persist, but once that time period is over, the DHTs will reuse those nodes, making the information about the decryption stored irretrievable. As long as the decryption key may be reassembled from the DHTs, the information is retrievable. However, the time initially entered by the user has lapsed, the information is not recoverable, as the user was never informed of the decryption key.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vanish.cs.washington.edu/pubs/usenixsec09-geambasu.pdf|title=' Vanish: Increasing Data Privacy with Self-Destructing Data|accessdate=2010-12-07 |publisher=http://vanish.cs.washington.edu}}</ref> ==Implementation== Vanish currently exists as a [[Firefox]] plug-in which allows a user to enter text into either a standard [[Gmail]] email or [[Facebook]] message, and choose to send the message via Vanish. The message is then encrypted and sent via the normal networking pathways through the [[Internet|cloud]] to the recipient. The recipient must have the same Firefox plug-in to decrypt the message. The plugin accesses [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] DHTs, which have 8-hour lifespans. This means the user may select an expiration date for the message in increments of 8 hours. After the expiration of the user-defined time span, the information in the DHT is overwritten, thereby eliminating the key. While both the user and recipient may have copies of the original encrypted message, the key used to turn it back into plain text is now gone. Although this particular instance of the data has become inaccessible, it's important to note that the information can always be saved by other means before expiration (copied, or even via screen shots) and published again. ==See also== {{Portal|Computer security}} * [[Cryptography]] * [[Internet privacy]] * [[Proactive Cyber Defence]] ==References== <references/> {{DEFAULTSORT:Vanish (Computer Science)}} [[Category:Computer security]] [[Category:Secure communication]] [[Category:Crime prevention]]</text> </page> <page> <id>39223</id> <title>Variable (programming)</title> <text>{{Refimprove|date=November 2009}} In [[computer programming]], a '''variable''' is a symbolic name given to some known or unknown quantity or information, for the purpose of allowing the name to be used independently of the information it represents. A variable name in computer [[source code]] is usually associated with a [[Memory address|data storage location]] and thus also its contents, and these may change during the course of program execution. Variables in programming may not directly correspond to the concept of [[Variable (mathematics)|variables in mathematics]]. The value of a computing variable is not necessarily part of an [[equation]] or [[formula]] as in mathematics. In computing, a variable may be employed in a repetitive process: assigned a value in one place, then used elsewhere, then reassigned a new value and used again in the same way. (See [[Iteration#Computing|iteration]].) Variables in computer programming are frequently given long names to make them relatively descriptive of their use, whereas variables in mathematics often have terse, one- or two-character names for brevity in transcription and manipulation. A computer variable can represent any kind of [[Data (computing)|data]] that can be stored in the computer system, from simple true/false conditions to numbers, names, pictures, sounds, segments of audio/video or arrays of information describing multi-dimensional [[object|entities]] (e.g., within [[computer models]]), or even to further computer code or behaviour such as [[subroutine]]s and [[First-class function|functions]]. Variables in business computing may represent numerical quantities such as monetary amounts, counters, totals and subtotals; alphanumeric [[Field (computer science)|fields]] containing names and descriptions of persons,
