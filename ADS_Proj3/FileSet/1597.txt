finally agreed on in 1987. [[Tektronix]] did make a few workstations based on Futurebus. That was just in time for the [[US Navy]] who had been looking for a new high-speed system for the Next Generation Computer Resources (NGCR) project for passing [[sonar]] data around in their newly designed [[Seawolf class submarine]]s, and they said they would standardize on Futurebus if only a ''few'' more changes would be made. Seeing a potential massive government buy, the additions effort started immediately on '''Futurebus+'''. This also had the unexpected side effect of killing any effort to produce Futurebus system while everyone waited for the new version to come out, "real soon now". Real soon turned out to be another four years, and when the resulting '''Futurebus+''' was released, no one was interested any longer. All of the Futurebus+ proponents had their idea of what Futurebus+ should be. This degenerated into "profiles", different versions of Futurebus+ targeted towards a particular market. Boards that were compliant with one Futurebus+ profile were not guaranteed to work with boards built to a different profile. The Futurebus+ standards development politics got so complicated that the IEEE 896 committee split from the IEEE Microcomputer Standards Committee and formed the IEEE Bus Architecture Standards Committee (BASC). In the end very little use of Futurebus was attempted. The decade-long performance gap they gave the system had evaporated in the decade-long standards process, and conventional local bus systems like [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] were close in performance terms. Meanwhile the VME ecosystem had evolved to such a degree that it continues to be used today, another decade on. The Futurebus technology is currently used as an internal backplane technology for systems such as routers. However the Futurebus effort did act as a catalyst for change in other ways. After the 1987 version shipped and the Futurebus+ effort started, a number of the original designers realized the effort was doomed. One member did a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation and showed that by the time Futurebus+ shipped, it would already be too slow for the [[supercomputer]] market. A group then organized to create a system aimed directly at this need, which eventually led to [[Scalable Coherent Interconnect]]. Meanwhile another member decided to simple re-create the entire concept on a much simpler basis, which resulted in [[QuickRing]]. Due to the simplicity of these standards, both standards were completed before Futurebus+. Futurebus was the source of some of the original work on [[Cache Coherency]], Live Insertion of boards, and Trapezoidal Transceivers. Trapezoidal Transceivers have a controlled risetime and make backplane and bus design much simpler. The original Trapezoidal Transceivers were made by [[National Semiconductor]]. Newer Futurebus+ transceivers that meet the [[IEEE]] Std 1194.1-1991 Backplane Transceiver Logic (BTL) standard are still made by [[Texas Instruments]]. Futurebus+ was used as the I/O bus in the [[DEC 4000 AXP]] and [[DEC 7000/10000 AXP|DEC 10000 AXP]] systems. Futurebus+ [[FDDI]] boards are still supported in the [[OpenVMS]] operating system. Many of the technical features (asynchronous data bus, distributed bus arbitration, large board size) are shared with IEEE standard [[FASTBUS]]. FASTBUS was used as a data acquisition system in many high-energy physics in the 1980s and 1990s. == Description == Futurebus is described in just a few [[IEEE]] standards; * 896.1-1987 IEEE Standard Backplane Bus Specifications for Multiprocessor Architectures: Futurebus * 1101-1987 IEEE Standard for Mechanical Core Specifications for Microcomputers Using IEC 603-2 Connectors Futurebus systems were implemented with 9Ux280 Eurocard mechanics using 96-pin [[DIN]] connectors resulting in a backplane that supported both 16 and 32 bit bus widths.

Profile A was sponsored by the [[VMEbus]] community. Profile B was sponsored by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] and implemented in [[VAX]] and [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] systems as an I/O bus. Profile F was sponsored by John Theus while he worked at [[Tektronix]] and was intended for high end workstations. Futurebus+ supports bus widths from 32 to 256 bits. It is possible to build a board that supports all of these bus widths and will interoperate with boards that only support a subset. Split bus transactions are supported so that slow response to a read or write will not tie up the backplane bus. Cache Coherence, implemented using the [[MESI]] protocols, was very complicated but significantly improved performance. Futurebus+ was one of the first open standards to support Live Insertion which allowed boards to be replaced while the system was running. Futurebus+ boards are 12SUx12SU Hard Metric size defined in the IEEE 1301 standards. One of the most elegant features of the Futurebus design is its distributed bus arbitration mechanism. See US patent number 5060139 for more information. In the end this was replaced by a central arbiter. == See also== * [[InfiniBand]] * [[QuickRing]] * [[Scalable
