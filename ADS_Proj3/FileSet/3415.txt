days. ''Pannekoeke'' are served with cinnamon-flavored sugar (and sometimes lemon juice); the sugar may be left to dissolve onto the pancake; if eaten immediately the pancake is crispy. It is a staple at [[Dutch Reformed Church]] fetes.<ref>[http://www.landbou.com/LandbouWeekblad/Kos_en_resepte/0,,1294-1317_1737818,00.html Boer op ons werf] Landbou.com</ref> American-style "silver dollar" pancakes are eaten in South Africa, as "plaatkoekies" or "flapjacks". In South Africa there is a variation of the pancake called a crumpet. It is made from self-raising flour, eggs, milk and a pinch of salt. The smooth batter is fried in butter resulting in a slightly raised flat cake. Crumpets are always served hot, usually for breakfast, with butter and golden syrup. In [[Kenya]] pancakes are eaten for breakfast as an alternative to bread. They are served plain with the sugar already added to the batter to sweeten them. Kenyan pancakes are similar to English pancakes and French crepes. ==Pancake restaurant chains== [[File:Local IHOP.jpg|thumb|right|An IHOP restaurant in [[Poughkeepsie]], New York]] In the US, Mexico and Canada, a franchised restaurant chain named [[IHOP|International House of Pancakes]] (IHOP) has restaurants serving pancakes at all hours of the day. [[The Original Pancake House]] is another chain of pancake restaurants across the US, and [[Walker Brothers]] is a series of pancake houses in the [[Chicago area]] that developed as a franchised spin-off of ''The Original Pancake House''. The popularity of pancakes in [[Australia]] has spawned the [[Pancake Parlour]] and ''Pancakes on the Rocks'' franchised restaurants. In [[British Columbia]] and [[Alberta]], the restaurant chain ''De Dutch'' serves Dutch- and Flemish-style pannenkoeken. ==Pancake Day== {{Main|Shrove Tuesday}} In Canada,<ref>{{cite web | title = The Presbyterian Church in Canada | work = The Presbyterian Church in Canada | url = http://www.presbyterian.ca/webfm_send/1974 |format=PDF}}</ref> the United Kingdom,<ref>{{cite web | title = Pancake Day (Shrove Tuesday), in the UK | work = British Embassy, Washington DC | url = http://www.britainusa.com/sections/articles_show_nt1.asp?d=0&i=60062&L1=0&L2=0&a=41276| accessdate = 17 November 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070223204148/http://www.britainusa.com/sections/articles_show_nt1.asp?d=0&i=60062&L1=0&L2=0&a=41276 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 23 February 2007}}</ref> Ireland,<ref>{{cite web | title = Shrove Tuesday - Pancake Day! | work = Irish Culture and Customs | url = http://www.irishcultureandcustoms.com/ACalend/ShroveTues.html | accessdate = 17 November 2006 }}</ref> New Zealand, and Australia,<ref>{{cite web | title = Easter in Australia | work = The Australian Government Culture and Recreation Portal | url = http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/easter/ | accessdate = 17 November 2006 }}</ref> pancakes are traditionally eaten on [[Shrove Tuesday]], which is also known as "Pancake Day" and, particularly in [[Ireland]], as "Pancake Tuesday". (Shrove Tuesday is better known in the United States, France and other countries as [[Mardi Gras]] or [[Fat Tuesday]].) Historically, pancakes were made on Shrove Tuesday so that the last of the fatty and rich foods could be used up before [[Lent]]. Charity and school events are organized on Pancake Day: in a "pancake race" each participant carries a pancake in a frying pan. All runners must toss their pancakes as they run and catch them in the frying pan. This event is said to have originated in [[Olney, Buckinghamshire|Olney, England]] in 1444 when a housewife was still busy frying pancakes to eat before the Lenten fast when she heard the bells of [[St Peter]] and [[Saint Paul (apostle)|St Paul]]'s Church calling her to the [[Confession|Shriving]] Service. Eager to get to church, she ran out of her house still holding the frying pan complete with pancake, and still wearing her [[apron]] and headscarf.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Pancake Day is widely celebrated in Australia. Every Shrove Tuesday since 1950 the towns of Olney<ref name="Olney race">[http://olney100.ning.com/video/pancake-race-2007-1 Olney Pancake Race 2007 Video]</ref> and [[Liberal, Kansas|Liberal]], [[Kansas]] have competed in the International Pancake Race. Only local women may compete; they race, and their times are compared to determine the international winner. In Olney the main women's race is augmented by races for local schoolchildren and for men. The ''Rehab UK Parliamentary Pancake Race'' takes place every Shrove Tuesday, with teams from the British lower house (the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]), the upper house (the [[House of Lords]]), and the [[Fourth Estate]], contending for the title of Parliamentary Pancake Race Champions. The fun relay race is to raise awareness of the work of the national [[Acquired brain injury|brain injury]] charity, Rehab UK, and the needs of people with acquired brain injury.
