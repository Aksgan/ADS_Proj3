measurable set ''A'' is called the '''sojourn time'''. An immediate consequence of the ergodic theorem is that, in an ergodic system, the relative measure of ''A'' is equal to the [[mean sojourn time]]: :<math> \frac{\mu(A)}{\mu(X)} = \frac 1{\mu(X)}\int \chi_A\, d\mu = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\; \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \chi_A\left(T^k x\right) </math> for all ''x'' except for a set of [[Lebesgue measure|measure]] zero, where <math>\chi_A</math> is the [[indicator function]] of ''A''. Let the '''occurrence times''' of a measurable set ''A'' be defined as the set ''k''<sub>1</sub>, ''k''<sub>2</sub>, ''k''<sub>3</sub>, ..., of times ''k'' such that ''T''<sup>''k''</sup>(''x'') is in ''A'', sorted in increasing order. The differences between consecutive occurrence times ''R''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''k''<sub>''i''</sub> &minus; ''k''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub> are called the '''recurrence times''' of ''A''. Another consequence of the ergodic theorem is that the average recurrence time of ''A'' is inversely proportional to the measure of ''A'', assuming that the initial point ''x'' is in ''A'', so that ''k''<sub>0</sub> = 0. :<math> \frac{R_1 + \cdots + R_n}{n} \rightarrow \frac{\mu(X)}{\mu(A)} \quad\mbox{(almost surely)}</math> (See [[almost surely]].) That is, the smaller ''A'' is, the longer it takes to return to it. ==Ergodic flows on manifolds== The ergodicity of the [[geodesic flow]] on [[Compact space|compact]] [[Riemann surface]]s of variable negative [[Gaussian curvature|curvature]] and on compact [[hyperbolic manifold|manifolds of constant negative curvature]] of any dimension was proved by [[Eberhard Hopf]] in 1939, although special cases had been studied earlier: see for example, [[Hadamard's billiards]] (1898) and [[Artin billiard]] (1924). The relation between geodesic flows on Riemann surfaces and one-parameter subgroups on [[SL2(R)|SL(2,'''R''')]] was described in 1952 by [[S. V. Fomin]] and [[I. M. Gelfand]]. The article on [[Anosov flow]]s provides an example of ergodic flows on SL(2,'''R''') and on Riemann surfaces of negative curvature. Much of the development described there generalizes to hyperbolic manifolds, since they can be viewed as quotients of the [[hyperbolic space]] by the [[group action|action]] of a [[lattice (discrete subgroup)|lattice]] in the semisimple Lie group [[SO(n,1)]]. Ergodicity of the geodesic flow on [[Riemannian symmetric space]]s was demonstrated by [[F. I. Mautner]] in 1957. In 1967 [[D. V. Anosov]] and [[Ya. G. Sinai]] proved ergodicity of the geodesic flow on compact manifolds of variable negative [[sectional curvature]]. A simple criterion for the ergodicity of a homogeneous flow on a [[homogeneous space]] of a [[semisimple Lie group]] was given by [[Calvin C. Moore]] in 1966. Many of the theorems and results from this area of study are typical of [[rigidity theory]]{{dn}}. In the 1930s [[G. A. Hedlund]] proved that the horocycle flow on a compact hyperbolic surface is minimal and ergodic. Unique ergodicity of the flow was established by [[Hillel Furstenberg]] in 1972. [[Ratner's theorems]] provide a major generalization of ergodicity for unipotent flows on the homogeneous spaces of the form ''Γ''\''G'', where ''G'' is a [[Lie group]] and ''Γ'' is a lattice in ''G''. In the last 20 years, there have been many works trying to find a measure-classification theorem similar to Ratner's theorems but for diagonalizable actions, motivated by conjectures of Furstenberg and Marguils. An important partial result (solving those conjectures with an extra assumption of positive entropy) was proved by [[Elon Lindenstrauss]], and he was awarded the [[Fields medal]] in 2010 for this result. ==See also== *[[Chaos theory]] *[[Ergodic hypothesis]] *[[Ergodic process]] *[[Maximal ergodic theorem]] *[[Statistical mechanics]] ==References== {{reflist}} ==Historical references== * {{Citation|first=George David|last=Birkhoff|authorlink=George David Birkhoff|title=Proof of the ergodic theorem|year=1931|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|volume=17|pages=656–660|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/17/12/656|doi=10.1073/pnas.17.12.656|pmid=16577406|issue=12|pmc=1076138}}. * {{Citation|first=George David|last=Birkhoff|authorlink=George David Birkhoff|title=What is the ergodic theorem?|journal=American Mathematical Monthly|volume=49|year=1942|pages=222–226|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2303229|doi=10.2307/2303229|issue=4|publisher=The American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 49, No. 4}}. * {{Citation|first=John|last=von Neumann|authorlink=John von Neumann|title=Proof of the Quasi-ergodic Hypothesis|year=1932|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|volume=18|pages=70–82|doi=10.1073/pnas.18.1.70|pmid=16577432|issue=1|pmc=1076162}}. * {{Citation|first=John|last=von Neumann|authorlink=John von Neumann|title=Physical Applications of the Ergodic Hypothesis|year=1932|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|volume=18|pages=263–266|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/86260|doi=10.1073/pnas.18.3.263|pmid=16587674|issue=3|pmc=1076204}}. * {{Citation|authorlink=Eberhard_Hopf|first=Eberhard|last=Hopf|title=Statistik der geodätischen Linien in Mannigfaltigkeiten negativer Krümmung|year=1939|journal=Leipzig Ber.
