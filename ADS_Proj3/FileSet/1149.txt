These features include a graphical user interface and personal use applications. Some Linux distributions have targeted the desktop role specifically, while others include all the software available for the platform. In that case, the user will be given the choice to select either a "desktop" or "server" type when the operating system is installed. == History == {{See also|History of free software#Desktop}} Historically, [[UNIX]] and other [[Unix-like]] operating systems have been utilized on [[Server (computing)|servers]], [[Mainframe computer|mainframes]], and [[workstation]]s in corporate or scientific environments. Beginning in the late 90s, a few [[Linux distribution]] companies, such as [[Mandriva|MandrakeSoft]], began to advertise their systems for low-end desktop computers. == Desktop environments == {{See also|Linux adoption#On desktop computers|l1=Desktop adoption of Linux}} [[Image:KDE 4.png|thumb|[[KDE]] desktop environment]] Linux offers many desktop alternatives. The most popular desktop environments are [[GNOME]], [[KDE]], [[Xfce]] and [[LXDE]]. These are rather large collections of desktop programs, rather than bare bone [[X window manager|window managers]] such as [[FVWM]], [[IceWM]] amongst numerous others. These environments present a [[GUI]] using a [[desktop metaphor]]. All of these environments allow the user to set many personal preferences and to perform common system management tasks. The [[Compiz]] window manager expands upon the concept of having multiple desktops by rendering each of the user's two dimensional desktops on the surface of a three dimensional cube. Regardless of the source, all Linux desktop applications use the [[X Window System]] and thus benefit from features like networking (remote display) and quick mouse-only [[cut, copy, and paste]]. Mouse selected text is automatically copied, and it can then be pasted using a middle click, without the need to resort to use of the keyboard.<ref name="About">{{cite web|url = http://linux.about.com/library/bl/open/newbie/blnewbie4.3.10.htm|title = Linux Newbie Administrator FAQ: X-Windows[sic]|accessdate = 2008-05-13|last = About, Inc|authorlink = |year = 2008}}</ref> Desktop Linux environments have been improving in appearance and overall integration over time. This has led to wider adoption of the platform over time.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Deploying KDE to 52 Million Students in Brazil|url=http://aseigo.blogspot.com/2008/04/deploying-kde-to-52-million-young.html|publisher=''Aaron Seigo''|accessdate=2008-05-02}}</ref> == Applications == [[Image:Synaptic screenshot.png|thumb|[[Synaptic (software)|Synaptic]]]] Most Linux distributions provide a [[package management system|program]] (e.g. [[Synaptic (software)|Synaptic]]) for browsing a list of thousands of [[free software]] applications that have already been tested and configured for a specific distribution.

This refers to an expected breakthrough in [[Linux adoption]] by business corporations and personal users. The reasons for these forecast gains include the installation of a Linux distribution on the desktops of workers for organizations or companies who may not be immediately or otherwise involved in the computing industry, or the acceleration of development for specific applications which find their greatest use on desktop Linux distributions. It can also refer to a breakthrough in the number of pre-installed Linux distributions on [[personal computer]]s being sold by PC manufacturers such as [[Dell]] and [[Hewlett-Packard]].<ref name="MaximumPC">{{cite web |url = http://www.maximumpc.com/article/2008_year_of_the_linux_desktop |title = 2008: Year of the Linux Desktop |accessdate = 2008-05-23 |last = Strohmeyer |first = Robert |authorlink = |year = 2007 |month = June}}</ref><ref name="AYSiu">{{cite web |url = http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntucat/the-linux-desktop-myth/ |title = The Linux Desktop Myth |accessdate = 2008-08-31|last = Siu|first = A.Y. |authorlink = |year = 2006|month = July}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=NVHVS3SP4QWBIQSNDLRSKH0CJUNN2JVN?articleID=201807072&pgno=1&queryText=&isPrev=|title=7 Reasons Why Linux Won't Succeed On The Desktop |last=Wolfe |first=Alexander |date=2007-09-19 |publisher=Information Week |accessdate=2009-03-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9911/19/comdex.linux.idg/index.html |work=CNN |title=Comdex: Linux, Linux everywhere |date=1999-11-18 |accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref><ref>http://www.pcworld.com/article/13908/linux_linux_everywhere.html</ref> == Performance == The performance of Linux on the desktop has been a controversial topic, with at least one key Linux kernel developer, [[Con Kolivas]], accusing the Linux community of favouring performance on servers. He quit Linux development because he was frustrated with this lack of focus on the desktop, and then gave a 'tell all' interview on the topic.<ref>{{cite web|title=Linux: why I quit|url=http://apcmag.com/node/6735/|accessdate=2008-01-18|date=2007-07-24|work=APC Magazine|publisher=ACP Magazines}}</ref> Other sources, such as mainstream press [[The Economist]] disagree with this assessment that there has not been enough focus on desktop Linux, saying in December 2007: <blockquote>...Linux has swiftly become popular in small businesses and the home...Thatâ€™s largely the doing of Gutsy Gibbon, the code-name for the [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] 7.10 from [[Canonical Ltd.|Canonical]].
