The most common set of criteria for trusted operating system design is the [[Common Criteria]] combined with the Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) for Labeled Security Protection Profile([[LSPP]]) and [[Mandatory Access Control]](MAC). The Common Criteria is the result of a multi-year effort by the governments of the U.S., Canada, United Kingdom, France, Germany, and the Netherlands to develop a harmonized security criteria for IT products. Examples of certified trusted operating systems are: * [[HP-UX|HP-UX 10.26]] * PitBull for AIX 5L * [[Trusted Solaris]] * Trusted UNICOS 8.0 (Rated B1) * [[XTS-400]] Examples of operating systems that might be certifiable are: * [[FreeBSD]] * [[SELinux]] (see [http://www.nsa.gov/selinux/info/faq.cfm#I12 FAQ]) * [[Linux]] Companies that have created trusted operating systems include: * [[Addamax]] (BSD, SVR3, SVR4, HP/UX) * Argus Systems Group (Solaris, AIX) * [[AT&T]] (System V) * Bull (AIX) * Data General (DG/UX) * [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (Ultrix) * Gemini Computers (GEMSOS) * Harris Corporation (SVR3, SVR4) * [[Hewlett-Packard]](HP/UX) * [[Honeywell]] (Multics) * [[IBM]] (OS/390, AIX) * [[SCO Group|SCO]] (SCO Unix) * Secure Computing Corporation (LOCK, Mach, BSD) * SecureWare (Apple A/UX, HP/UX, SCO) * Sequent (Dynix/ptx) * [[Silicon Graphics]] (IRIX) * [[Sun Microsystems]] (SunOS, Solaris) * [[Trusted Information Systems]] (Xenix, Mach) * [[BAE Systems]] (XTS Unix) == See also == * [[Comparison of operating systems]] * [[Security-evaluated operating system]] * [[Security focused operating system]] ==References== {{reflist}} == External links == * [http://www.nsa.gov/research/selinux/faqs.shtml NSA FAQ on SELinux] * [http://www.argus-systems.com/ Argus Systems] [[Category:Operating system security]] [[fr:Trusted operating system]]</text> </page> <page> <id>38343</id> <title>Truth</title> <text>{{pp-move-indef}} {{Other uses}} [[File:Time Saving Truth from Falsehood and Envy.jpg|right|thumb|225px|''Time Saving Truth from Falsehood and Envy'', [[François Lemoyne]], 1737]] '''Truth''' can have a variety of meanings, such as the state of being in accord with a particular fact or reality, or being in accord with the body of [[Reality|real]] things, real events or actualities.<ref name = Merriam-Webster-def>Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary, [http://m-w.com/dictionary/truth truth], 2005</ref> It can also mean having fidelity to an original or to a standard or ideal. In a common archaic usage it also meant constancy or sincerity in action or character.<ref name = Merriam-Webster-def/> The [[principle of bivalence|direct opposite]] of truth is "[[false|falsehood]]", which can correspondingly take logical, factual or ethical meanings. However, language and words are essentially "[[tool|tools]]" by which humans convey [[information]] to one another. As such, "truth" must have a beneficial use in order to be retained within language. Since truths are used in planning and prediction (such as scientific truths being used in engineering), the more reliable and trustworthy an idea is, the more useful and potent it becomes for planning and prediction. Those ideas which can be used anywhere and anytime with maximum reliability are generally considered the most powerful and potent truths. Defining this potency and applicability can be looked upon as "criteria", and the method used to recognize a "truth" is termed a [[criteria of truth]]. Since there is no single accepted criteria, they can all be considered "[[theory|theories]]". Various theories and views of truth continue to be debated among scholars and philosophers. There are differing claims on such questions as what constitutes truth; what things are [[truthbearer]]s capable of being true or false; how to define and identify truth; the roles that revealed and acquired [[knowledge]] play; and whether truth is [[Subjectivity|subjective]], [[knowledge relativity|relative]], [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]], or [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]]. This article introduces the various perspectives and claims, both today and throughout history. ==Nomenclature, orthography and etymology== {{See|Veritas|Aletheia}} The English word ''[[:wikt:truth|truth]]'' is from [[Old English]] ''tríewþ, tréowþ, trýwþ'', [[Middle English]] ''trewþe'', cognate to [[Old High German]] ''triuwida'', [[Old Norse]] ''tryggð''. Like ''[[troth]]'', it is a ''[[:wikt:-th|-th]]'' nominalisation of the adjective ''true'' (Old English ''tréowe''). The English word ''[[:wikt:true|true]]'' is from Old English ([[West Saxon]]) ''(ge)tríewe, [[:wikt:treowe|tréowe]]'', cognate to [[Old Saxon]] ''(gi)trûui'', [[Old High German]] ''(ga)triuwu'' ([[Modern German]] ''treu'' "faithful"), [[Old Norse]] ''tryggr'', [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''triggws'',<ref>see [[Holtzmann's law]] for the ''-ww-'' : ''-gg-'' alternation.</ref> all from a [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*trewwj-'' "having [[good faith]]". Old Norse ''{{lang|is|trú}}'', "faith, word of honour; religious faith, belief"<ref>''[http://www.northvegr.org/zoega/h442.php A Concise Dictionary of Old Icelandic]'', Geir T. Zoëga (1910), Northvegr.org</ref> (archaic English ''[[:wikt:troth|troth]]'' "loyalty, honesty, good faith", compare ''{{lang|is|[[Ásatrú]]}}''). Thus, 'truth' involves both the quality of "faithfulness, fidelity, loyalty, sincerity, veracity",<ref>[[OED]] on ''true'' has "Steadfast in adherence to a commander or friend, to a principle or cause, to one's promises, faith, etc.; firm in allegiance; faithful,
