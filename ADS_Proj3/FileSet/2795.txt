link or [[transatlantic cable]] to the [[Tymnet]] International Gateway. Tymnet was a "gateway" service that a user called into that routed him to any one of a number of computer systems that also used the service. Tymnet was one of a number of services available that provided local telephone numbers, where directly accessing the computer would have been a [[long distance call]]. Users normally used [[packet switching]] services like Tymnet for their lower costs. Once he accessed Tymnet, Hess branched out to the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|Jet Propulsion Laboratories]] in [[Pasadena, California]] and to the Tymnet Switching System. It was through this switching system that he accessed the LBL computers. Hess was able to attack 400 [[U.S. military]] computers by using LBL to “[[Piggybacking (security)|piggyback]]” to [[ARPANET]] and [[MILNET]]. ARPANET was a civilian [[wide area network]] created by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] which would later become what is now known as the [[Internet]]. MILNET was its military counterpart. ===Targets=== The facilities that Hess hacked into included: * [[SRI International]] - [[Menlo Park, California]] * [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[United States Army Soldier Systems Center|Darcom]] - [[Mannheim, Germany|Seckenheim]], [[West Germany]] * [[Fort Buckner]], [[Camp Foster]] - [[Okinawa, Japan]] * U.S. Army [[24th Infantry Division (United States)|24th Infantry]] - [[Fort Stewart, Georgia]] * [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City|Coastal Systems Computer]] - [[Panama City, Florida]] * [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] - [[Ramstein Air Base]], [[West Germany]] * [[MIT]] MX Computer, [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] * OPTIMIS Database - [[The Pentagon]] * [[Air Force Systems Command|United States Air Force Systems Command]] - [[El Segundo, California]] * [[Anniston Army Depot]] - [[Anniston, Alabama]] ===Tracking Hess and his capture=== Stoll, with the help of local authorities, traced the call to Tymnet switch in [[Oakland, California]]. Because the call came from Oakland rather than [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], it was obvious that the hacker was not working locally. Tymnet officials helped LBL trace the various calls even though the hacker attempted to conceal their origin. Enlisting the aid of [[AT&T]] and the FBI, Stoll eventually determined that the calls were being “piggybacked” across the United States though they originated from [[Hanover]], Germany. Stoll trapped Hess by creating records of a bogus military project conducted on LBL computers (according to ''[[The Cuckoo's Egg]]'', he and his partner conceived this plan while showering, giving it the unofficial name of 'Operation Showerhead'). While the bogus information was convincing, the primary goal was simply to keep the hacker connected long enough to trace his connection, with the remote hope that the hacker might send a written request for further information listed as available in hard copy format. This simple technique worked. A request was received from a Pittsburgh address requesting the additional written information. At this time, this type of hacking was new and it was a considerable challenge to get the cooperation of the FBI and the West German government. Eventually, the German authorities were able to break in and arrest Hess. Hess went to trial in 1990 and Stoll testified against him. Hess was found guilty of [[espionage]] and was sentenced to a one to three year prison sentence. He was eventually released on probation. ==Literature & Films== After Hess's capture, Stoll wrote about his efforts to track and locate Hess in a technical paper, ''[[Stalking the Wily Hacker]]'',<ref>{{cite journal | date=May 1988 | volume=31 | issue=5 | periodical=[[Communications of the ACM]] | publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] | author=Clifford Stoll | title= [http://pdf.textfiles.com/academics/wilyhacker.pdf Stalking the Wily Hacker] }}</ref> and a book for the general public, ''[[The Cuckoo's Egg (book)|The Cuckoo's Egg]]''.<ref> {{cite book | author=Clifford Stoll | publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] | title=The Cuckoo's Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage | year=1989 | isbn=0-385-24946-2 }}</ref> ''The Cuckoo's Egg'' was adapted into a 1990 ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]'' episode, "The KGB, The Computer, and Me". In 1996 Ian Probert wrote a short book ''The Internet Incident'', which was also published under the title ''The Internet Spy''. The book was based on Hess’s life with a fictitious unnamed child as the story’s narrator. During 2007, ''March The Second'', an independent short film directed by Kyle van Tonder, was produced. The film was based on the book ''The Internet Incident'' with Shannon Mayne (playing the part of the hacker) and Christoff Pienaar (playing the part of the child narrator, Timothy). ==See also== *[[Tymnet]] *[[ARPANET]] *[[Chaos Computer Club]] *[[The Cuckoo's Egg (book)]] ==References== *[http://www.shk-dplc.com/cfo/articles/hack.htm Apprehending the Computer Hacker...] *The Internet Incident (ISBN 0-7534-0027-8) *[http://www.vtkproductions.com/movies_marchthesecond.htm VTK Productions March The Second Movie Page] <references/> ==External links== *[http://www.lbl.gov Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory] *[http://www.jpl.nasa.gov Jet Propulsion Laboratories] *[http://www.vtkproductions.com VTK Productions Home Page] {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME = Hess, Markus | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH = | PLACE OF BIRTH = | DATE OF DEATH = | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Hess, Markus}} [[Category:German computer criminals]] [[Category:Convicted Soviet spies]] [[Category:People associated with computer security]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:German spies for the Soviet Union]] [[de:Markus Hess]]</text> </page> <page> <id>23555</id> <title>Mars Exploration Rover</title> <text>[[Image:NASA Mars Rover.jpg||thumb|300px|Artist's conception of rover on Mars]] [[Image:Spirit rover tracks.jpg|thumb|300px|Part of a panorama taken by the Spirit rover in 2004]] [[NASA]]'s '''Mars Exploration Rover Mission''' ('''MER''') is an ongoing [[robotic space mission]] involving two rovers, '''''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity''''', exploring the planet [[Mars]]. It began in 2003 with the sending of the two [[rover (space exploration)|rover]]s — MER-A ''[[Spirit rover|Spirit]]'' and MER-B ''[[Opportunity rover|Opportunity]]'' — to explore the Martian surface and [[geology]]. The mission's scientific objective was to search for and characterize a wide range of [[rock (geology)|rocks]] and [[soil]]s that hold clues to past water activity on Mars. The mission is part of NASA's Mars Exploration Program, which includes three previous successful landers: the two [[Viking program]] landers in 1976 and [[Mars Pathfinder]] probe in 1997.<ref name="Mission overview">{{Cite web|url=http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/overview | title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission Overview | publisher=NASA}}</ref> The total cost of building, launching, landing and operating the rovers on the surface for the initial 90-[[Martian day#Sols|Martian-day (sol)]] primary mission
