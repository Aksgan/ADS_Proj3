Born in [[McComb, Mississippi]] and raised in [[Kentwood, Louisiana]], Spears began performing as a child, landing acting roles in stage productions and television shows. She signed with [[Jive Records]] in 1997 and released her debut album ''[[...Baby One More Time]]'' in 1999. During her first decade within the music industry, she became a prominent figure in mainstream popular music and popular culture, followed by a much-publicized personal life. Her first two albums established her as a pop icon and broke sales records, while title tracks "[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]" and "[[Oops!... I Did It Again (song)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]" became international number-one hits. Spears was credited with influencing the revival of [[teen pop]] during the late 1990s. In 2001, she released her third studio album ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'' and expanded her brand, playing the starring role in the film ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]''. She assumed creative control of her fourth studio album, ''[[In the Zone]]'' released in 2003, which yielded chart-topping singles "[[Me Against the Music]]", "[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]" and "[[Everytime]]". After the release of two compilation albums, Spears experienced personal struggles and her career went under hiatus. Her fifth studio album, ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'', was released in 2007 and despite receiving little promotion, it spawned hits "[[Gimme More]]" and "[[Piece of Me]]". In 2008, her erratic behaviour and hospitalizations caused her to be placed in a [[conservatorship]]. The same year, her sixth studio album ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' was released, with the global chart-topping lead single "[[Womanizer (song)|Womanizer]]". After embarking on [[The Circus Starring Britney Spears]], she released greatest hits ''[[The Singles Collection (Britney Spears album)|The Singles Collection]]'', which featured U.S. and Canadian number-one single "[[3 (song)|3]]".
