Some possible vibrational modes of resonators]]It is usually possible for a mechanical part to [[vibration|vibrate]] in a number of different [[vibration mode|modes]], however the design will be based on a particular vibrational mode and the designer will take steps to try to restrict the resonance to this mode. As well as the straightforward [[longitudinal stress|longitudinal]] mode some others which are used include [[flexural strength|flexural]] mode, [[torsional vibration|torsional mode]], radial mode and [[vibrations of a circular drum|drumhead mode]].<ref name=RockwellHow>Rockwell-Collins, [http://www.rockwellcollins.com/about/additionalproducts/collinsfilters/mechanical_filters/index.html "How mechanical filters work"] <!-- retrieved 11 November 2009. --></ref><ref>Taylor & Huang, pp.392–393.</ref> Modes are numbered according to the number of half-wavelengths in the vibration. Some modes exhibit vibrations in more than one direction (such as drumhead mode which has two) and consequently the mode number consists of more than one number. When the vibration is in one of the higher modes, there will be multiple nodes on the resonator where there is no motion. For some types of resonator, this can provide a convenient place to make a mechanical attachment for structural support. Wires attached at nodes will have no effect on the vibration of the resonator or the overall filter response. In figure 5, some possible anchor points are shown as wires attached at the nodes. The modes shown are (5a) the second longitudinal mode fixed at one end, (5b) the first torsional mode, (5c) the second torsional mode, (5d) the second flexural mode, (5e) first radial expansion mode and (5f) first radially symmetric drumhead mode.<ref name=Taylor380>Taylor & Huang, p.380.</ref> ==Circuit designs== [[File:Mechanical filter with disk flexual resonators.svg|thumb|300px|alt=A chain of four disc resonators coupled together with metal rods at the edges at the edges of the discs.

A filter using disc drumhead resonators]] There are a great many combinations of resonators and transducers that can be used to construct a mechanical filter. A selection of some of these is shown in the diagrams. Figure 6 shows a filter using disc flexural resonators and magnetostrictive transducers. The transducer drives the centre of the first resonator, causing it to vibrate. The edges of the disc move in [[antiphase]] to the centre when the driving signal is at, or close to, resonance, and the signal is transmitted through the connecting rods to the next resonator. When the driving signal is not close to resonance, there is little movement at the edges, and the filter rejects (does not pass) the signal.<ref name=Naval450>Bureau of Naval Personnel, p.450.</ref> Figure 7 shows a similar idea involving longitudinal resonators connected together in a [[Signal chain (signal processing chain)|chain]] by connecting rods. In this diagram, the filter is driven by piezoelectric transducers. It could equally well have used magnetostrictive transducers.<ref name=Rosen302/> Figure 8 shows a filter using torsional resonators. In this diagram, the input has a torsional piezoelectric transducer and the output has a magnetostrictive transducer. This would be quite unusual in a real design, as both input and output usually have the same type of transducer. The magnetostrictive transducer is only shown here to demonstrate how longitudinal vibrations may be converted to torsional vibrations and vice versa.<ref name=Rosen302/><ref name=RockwellHow/><ref>Taylor & Huang, p.379.</ref> Figure 9 shows a filter using drumhead mode resonators. The edges of the discs are fixed to the casing of the filter (not shown in the diagram) so the vibration of the disc is in the same modes as the membrane of a drum. Collins calls this type of filter a disc wire filter.<ref name=RockwellHow/> The various types of resonator are all particularly suited to different frequency bands. Overall, mechanical filters with lumped elements of all kinds can cover frequencies from about 5 to 700 kHz although mechanical filters down as low as a few [[kilohertz]]
