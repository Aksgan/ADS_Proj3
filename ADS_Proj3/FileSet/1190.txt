Process''' is a process in [[photography]]. This category of Digital [[Photography]] starts where digital drawing/painting leaves off and can combine all the previous groups. It also includes digital imagery that takes advantage of [[3D Computer Aided Design|3D]] modeling software, [[fractal mathematics]], "machine art," Algorithmic art, Automatic filters, plus Alternative photo process, silk screen digital etc. Many are purely mechanical, utilizing the computer to almost any software as in paint by numbers. Almost anyone can do this and become an artist. {{Unreferenced|date=May 2007}} [[Category:Digital photography]]</text> </page> <page> <id>10369</id> <title>Digital Library of Mathematical Functions</title> <text>The '''Digital Library of Mathematical Functions''' ('''DLMF''') is an online project at the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] to develop a major resource of mathematical reference data for [[special functions]] and their applications. It is intended as an update of [[Abramowitz and Stegun|Abramowitz's and Stegun's Handbook of Mathematical Functions]] (A&S). It was published online on May 7 2010, though some chapters appeared earlier. In contrast to A&S, whose initial print run was done by the [[U.S. Government Printing Office]] and was in the [[public domain]], NIST asserts that it holds copyright to the DLMF under [[Title 17 USC 105]] of the U.S. Code.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dlmf.nist.gov/about/notices|title=DLMF: Notices|publisher=NIST|accessdate=2010-12-28}}</ref> ==References== *B.

The first phase is a choice of ''algorithm parameters'' which may be shared between different users of the system: * Choose an approved [[cryptographic hash function]] ''H''. In the original DSS, ''H'' was always SHA-1, but the stronger SHA-2 hash functions are approved for use in the current DSS. The hash output may be truncated to the size of a key pair. * Decide on a key length ''L'' and ''N''. This is the primary measure of the [[cryptographic strength]] of the key. The original DSS constrained ''L'' to be a multiple of 64 between 512 and 1024 (inclusive). NIST 800-57<ref>[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-57/SP800-57-Part1.pdf NIST 800-57]</ref> recommends lengths of 2048 (or 3072) for keys with security lifetimes extending beyond 2010 (or 2030), using correspondingly longer ''N''.<ref name=FIPS186-3/> specifies ''L'' and ''N'' length pairs of (1024,160), (2048,224), (2048,256), and (3072,256). * Choose an ''N''-bit prime ''q''. ''N'' must be less than or equal to the hash output length. * Choose an ''L''-bit prime modulus ''p'' such that ''p''–1 is a multiple of ''q''. * Choose ''g'', a number whose multiplicative order modulo ''p'' is ''q''. This may be done by setting ''g'' = ''h''<sup>(''p''–1)/''q''</sup> mod ''p'' for some arbitrary ''h'' (1 < h < p-1), and trying again
