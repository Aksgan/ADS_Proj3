[[Business-to-business]] and [[financial services]] on the Internet affect [[supply chain]]s across entire industries. The origins of the Internet reach back to research of the 1960s, commissioned by the United States government in collaboration with private commercial interests to build robust, fault-tolerant, and distributed computer networks. The funding of a new U.S. [[network backbone|backbone]] by the [[National Science Foundation]] in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial backbones, led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies, and the merger of many networks. The [[commercialization]] of what was by the 1990s an international network resulted in its popularization and incorporation into virtually every aspect of modern human life. As of 2009, an estimated quarter of Earth's population used the services of the Internet. The Internet has no centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage; each constituent network sets its own standards. Only the overreaching definitions of the two principal [[name space]]s in the Internet, the [[IP address|Internet Protocol address]] space and the [[Domain Name System]], are directed by a maintainer organization, the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN). The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols ([[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]]) is an activity of the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise. ==Terminology== {{See also|Internet capitalization conventions}} ''Internet'' is a short form of the technical term [[internetwork]],<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |title=Internet, n. |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00304286 |accessdate=2010-10-26 |edition=Draft |date=March 2009 |quote=Shortened < INTERNETWORK n., perhaps influenced by similar words in -net}}</ref> the result of interconnecting computer networks with special gateways or routers. The Internet is also often referred to as ''the Net''. The term ''the Internet'', when referring to the entire global system of IP networks, has been treated as a [[proper noun]] and written with an initial [[capital letter]]. In the media and popular culture a trend has also developed to regard it as a generic term or common noun and thus write it as "the internet", without capitalization. Some guides specify that the word should be capitalized as a noun but not capitalized as an adjective. [[File:Handbuch Webdesign-InternetDatenaustausch.jpg|thumb|right|Depiction of the Internet as a ''cloud'' in network diagrams]] The terms ''Internet'' and ''World Wide Web'' are often used in everyday speech without much distinction. However, the Internet and the [[World Wide Web]] are not one and the same. The Internet is a global data communications system. It is a hardware and software [[infrastructure]] that provides connectivity between computers. In contrast, the Web is one of the services communicated via the Internet. It is a collection of interconnected documents and other [[Resource (Web)|resources]], linked by [[hyperlink]]s and [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/links.html#h-12.1|title= Links |accessdate=2008-08-13 |work=HTML 4.01 Specification |publisher=World Wide Web Consortium |date=HTML 4.01 Specification | quote = [T]he link (or hyperlink, or Web link) [is] the basic hypertext construct.

The organization united some of America's most brilliant people, who developed the United States' first successful satellite in 18 months. Several years later ARPA began to focus on computer networking and communications technology.<ref name="NetValley">[http://www.netvalley.com/intval.html "Roads and Crossroads of Internet History"] by Gregory Gromov</ref> }} ARPA created the [[Information Processing Technology Office]] (IPTO) to further the research of the [[Semi Automatic Ground Environment]] (SAGE) program, which had networked country-wide [[radar]] systems together for the first time. The IPTO's purpose was to find ways to address the US military's concern about survivability of their communications networks, and as a first step interconnect their computers at the [[Pentagon]], [[Cheyenne Mountain]], and [[Strategic Air Command|Strategic Air Command headquarters (SAC)]]. [[J. C. R. Licklider]], a promoter of universal networking, was selected to head the IPTO. Licklider moved from the Psycho-Acoustic Laboratory at [[Harvard University]] to [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in [[1950 in science|1950]], after becoming interested in [[information technology]]. At MIT, he served on a committee that established [[Lincoln Laboratory]] and worked on the SAGE project. In [[1957 in science|1957]] he became a Vice President at [[BBN Technologies|BBN]], where he bought the first production [[PDP-1]] computer and conducted the first public demonstration of [[time-sharing]].
