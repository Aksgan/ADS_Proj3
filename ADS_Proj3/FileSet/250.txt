end of 1992; the last II-series Apple in production, the IIe, was discontinued on October 15, 1993. ==Design== The Apple II was designed to look more like a [[Small appliance|home appliance]] than a piece of electronic equipment.<ref>Helmer, Carl, "An Apple to Byte," Byte, March 1978, p. 18-46.</ref> The lid popped off the beige plastic case without the use of tools, allowing access to the computer's internals, including the [[motherboard]] with eight [[expansion slot]]s, and an array of random access memory (RAM) sockets that could hold up to 48 [[kilobyte]]s worth of memory chips. The Apple II had color and high-resolution [[Apple II graphics|graphics modes]], sound capabilities and one of two built-in [[BASIC]] programming languages (initially [[Integer BASIC]], later [[Applesoft BASIC]]). The Apple II was targeted for the masses rather than just hobbyists and engineers; it also influenced most of the microcomputers that followed it. Unlike preceding home microcomputers, it was sold as a finished consumer appliance rather than as a kit (unassembled or preassembled). ''VanLOVEs Apple Handbook'' and ''The Apple Educators Guide'' by Gerald VanDiver and Rolland Love reviewed more than 1,500 software programs that the Apple II series could use. The Apple dealer network used this book to emphasize the growing software developer base in education and personal use. <!-- What does this mean?? : "The books became part of the Apple program and became the first book on database." What Apple program? What about a database? --> The Apple II series had a keyboard built into the motherboard shell, with the exception of the [[Apple IIGS|Apple II<small>GS</small>]] which featured an external keyboard. An upgrade kit was sold later to house the motherboard of an Apple II<small>GS</small> in an [[Apple IIe]] case. ==Models== {{See also|Timeline of computing}} Early II-series models were usually designated "Apple ]["; later models "Apple //", plus a letter suffix. ===Apple II=== [[File:Micromodem II in Apple II.jpg|thumb|250px|An Apple II computer with an external [[modem]]]] The first Apple II computers went on sale on June 5, 1977<ref>{{cite web|title=June 5, 1977: From a Little Apple a Mighty Industry Grows|url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/06/dayintech_0605|date=June 5, 2007|accessdate=2009-06-02}}</ref> with a [[MOS Technology]] [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] microprocessor running at 1 [[Hertz|MHz]], 4 KB of [[Random-access memory|RAM]], an [[compact audio cassette#Data recording|audio cassette]] interface for loading programs and storing data, and the [[Integer BASIC]] programming language built into the [[read-only memory|ROMs]]. The video controller displayed 24 lines by 40 columns of monochrome, upper-case-only (the original character set matches ASCII characters 0x20 to 0x5F) text on the screen, with [[National Television System Committee|NTSC]] [[composite video]] output suitable for display on a TV monitor, or on a regular TV set by way of a separate [[RF modulator]].

An external 5Â¼-inch [[floppy disk]] drive, the [[Disk II]], attached via a controller card that plugged into one of the computer's expansion slots (usually slot 6), was used for data storage and retrieval to replace cassettes. The Disk II interface, created by [[Steve Wozniak]], was regarded as an engineering masterpiece for its economy of electronic components.<ref>{{cite web| title=Apple II History Chapter 5, The Disk II|url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah05.html| author=Steven Weyhrich|date=December 28, 2001|accessdate=2006-11-16}}</ref><ref>Freiberger, Paul, and Michael Swaine. "Fire In The Valley, Part Two (Book Excerpt)", A+ Magazine, January 1985: 45.</ref> While other controllers had dozens of chips for synchronizing data I/O with disk rotation, seeking the head to the appropriate track, and encoding the data into magnetic pulses, Wozniak's controller card had few chips; instead, the [[Apple DOS]] used software to perform these functions. The [[Group Code Recording]] used by the controller was simpler and easier to implement in software than the more common [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]]. In the end, the low chip count of the controller helped make Apple's Disk II the first affordable floppy drive for personal computers. As a side effect, Wozniak's scheme made it easy for [[proprietary software]] developers to [[copy protection|copy-protect]] the media on which their software shipped by changing the low-level sector format or stepping the drive's head between the tracks; inevitably, other companies eventually sold software to foil this protection. Another Wozniak optimization allowed him to omit Shugart's Track-0 sensor. When the Operating System wants to go to track 0, the controller simply moves 40 times toward the next-lower-numbered track, relying on the mechanical stop to prevent it going any further down than track 0. This process, called "recalibration", made a loud buzzing (rapid mechanical chattering) sound that often frightened Apple novices. The approach taken in the Disk II controller was typical of Wozniak's design sensibility. The Apple II used several engineering shortcuts to save hardware and reduce costs. For example, taking advantage of the way that 6502 instructions only access memory every other clock cycle, the video generation circuitry's memory access on the otherwise unused cycles avoided memory contention issues and also eliminated the need for a separate refresh circuit for the DRAM chips. Rather than use a complex analog-to-digital circuit to read the outputs of the game controller, Wozniak used a simple timer circuit whose period was proportional to the resistance of the game controller, and used a software loop to measure the timer. The text and graphics screens had a complex arrangement (the scanlines were not stored in sequential areas of memory) which was reputedly due to Wozniak's realization that doing it that way would save a chip; it was less expensive to have software calculate or look up the address of the required scanline than to include the extra
