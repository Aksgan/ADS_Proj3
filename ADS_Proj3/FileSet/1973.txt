upon the data values and trends, in conjunction with the available business logic. ==OLAP Storage== Holos Server provided an array of different, but compatible, storage mechanisms for its multi-cube architecture: memory, disk, SQL. It was therefore the first product to provide "hybrid OLAP" ([[HOLAP]]). It provided a very versatile mechanism for joining cubes, irrespective of their storage technology, dimensionality, or meta-data, and this was eventually given a [[US patent]] (called COA -- Compound OLAP Architecture {{US patent|6289352}}{{US patent|6490593}}). One novel aspect of this was a 'stack' feature that allowed read/write cubes to be stacked over read-only cubes. Read operations to the overall virtual cube then visited both 'racks' (top first, and then the bottom), whereas write operations only affected the top. The resulting valve-like mechanism found many applications in data sharing, what-if forecasting, and aggregation of slow SQL-based data. Since the overhead of the joining was small, it was not uncommon to have stacks 7 levels deep, and joining terabytes of real OLAP data. Around about V8.5, Holos Server implemented a hierarchical lock manager, allowing nesting of fine and coarse-grain OLAP locks, and full transaction control. ==Business Rules== The business logic supported full cross-dimensional calculations, automatic ordering of rules using static data-flow analysis, and the identification and solution of simultaneous equations. The rules treated all dimensions in an orthogonal fashion. The aggregation process did not distinguish between simple summation or average calculations, and more complex non-commutative calculations. Both could be applied to any dimension member. The process allowed aggregation levels (i.e. those calculation levels starting with base data (level 0) and proceeding up to the overall grand total) to be individually pre-stored or left to be calculated on demand. ==Holos Client== The Holos Client was both a design and delivery vehicle, and this made it quite large. Around about 2000, the Holos Language was made object-oriented (HL++) with a view to allowing the replacement of the Holos Client with a custom Java or VB product. However, the company were never sold on this, and so the project was abandoned. One of the biggest failures was not to provide a thin-client interface to the Holos Server, and this must have contributed to the product's demise. Although an [[HTML]] toolkit was sold, it was clumsy and restricted. By the time a real thin-client mechanism was developed, it was far too late and it never got to market. ==Deployment== Before its demise, the Holos Server product ran under Windows NT (Intel and Alpha), VMS (VAX and Alpha), plus about 10 flavours of UNIX, and accessed over half-a-dozen different SQL databases. It was also ported to several different locales, including Japanese. ==Company== {{main|Crystal Decisions}} Holistic Systems was purchased by the hardware company [[Seagate Technology]] in 1996. Along with other companies such as [[Crystal Services]], it was used to create a new subsidiary company called [[Seagate Software]]. Only Holistic and Crystal remained, and Holistic was renamed to [[Crystal Decisions]]. Holistic and Crystal had very different sales models. The average sale for the Holos Product in the United States was in excess of $250,000 and was sold primarily to Fortune 500 companies by a direct sales force. The Crystal sales model was based upon a "shrink wrapped" product Crystal Reports sold primarliy through resellers. As Crystal was acquired prior to Holistic the senior management in the sales and marketing arnea were mostly drawn from that organisation. They felt that all the product range should be through third parties and over a period of time dismatled the direct sales force culmination in a significant drop in sales for the Holos Product. Subsequantly after some in-fighting and argument over product strategy, the main Holos development team finally started to leave around 2000, and Crystal Decisions was finally taken over by [[Business Objects (company)|Business Objects]] in 2004. Following the takeover, support for Holos was outsourced to [[Raspberry Software]], which was set up by former employees of Crystal Decisions.

It is automation of the home, housework or household activity. Home automation may include centralized control of lighting, [[HVAC]] (heating, ventilation and air conditioning), appliances, and other systems, to provide improved convenience, comfort, energy efficiency and security. [[Home automation for the elderly and disabled]] can provide increased quality of life for persons who might otherwise require caregivers or institutional care. A home automation system integrates electrical devices in a house with each other. The techniques employed in home automation include those in building automation as well as the control of domestic activities, such as [[home cinema|home entertainment systems]], [[houseplant]] and yard watering, pet feeding, changing the ambiance "scenes" for different events (such as dinners or parties), and the use of [[domestic robot]]s. Devices may be connected through a [[computer network]] to allow control by a [[personal computer]], and may allow remote access from the [[internet]]. Typically, a new home is outfitted for home automation during construction, due to the accessibility of the walls, outlets, and storage rooms, and the ability to make design changes specifically to accommodate certain technologies. Wireless systems are commonly installed when outfitting a pre-existing house, as they reduce wiring changes. These communicate through [[Power line communication|the existing power wiring]], [[radio]], or [[infrared]] signals with a central controller. Network sockets may be installed in every room like [[AC power]] receptacles. Although automated ''[[Home of the future|homes of the future]]'' have been staple exhibits for World's Fairs and popular backgrounds in science fiction, complexity, competition between vendors, multiple incompatible standards <ref>http://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles%2F1995%2Fmar95%2Fpcn0323%2Fpcn0323.asp retrieved 2010 09 02</ref> and the resulting expense have limited the penetration of home automation to homes of the wealthy or ambitious hobbyists. [[File:Patch Panel.JPG|thumb|A typical domestic patch panel.]] ==Overview and benefits == In modern construction in industrialized nations, homes have been wired for electrical power, telephones, TV outlets (cable or antenna), and a doorbell. Many household tasks were automated by the development of special appliances. For instance, automatic [[washing machine]]s were
