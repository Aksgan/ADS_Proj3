expanded crew sizes, increasingly ambitious, complex props, and set pieces intended to convey theatrical "narratives". These shows represented the apex of the group's activities, both in terms of fully realized spectacle and audience exposure. The 2006 film "Coachella" features footage culled from Robochrist performances from several different years as well as a brief interview with Ristow. In early 2006 Ristow again relocated, this time leaving Los Angeles for [[Taos, New Mexico]], effectively killing Robochrist Industries, at least in terms of its Los Angeles incarnation. Future incarnations or use of the name are unknown at this time. ==External links== *[http://www.christianristow.com Home Page] [[Category:Robot machine art]]</text> </page> <page> <id>32259</id> <title>Robocrane</title> <text>[[File:Robocrane Project.jpg|thumb|240px|Robocrane Project.]] The '''Robocrane''' is a kind of manipulator resembling a [[Stewart platform]] but using an [[Octahedron|octahedral]] assembly of cables instead of struts. Like the Stewart platform, the Robocrane has six [[degrees of freedom (engineering)|degrees of freedom]] (x, y, z, pitch, roll, & yaw). It was developed by [[James S. Albus]] of the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST), using the [[Real-Time Control System]] which is a [[hierarchical control system]]. Given its unusual ability to "fly" tools around a work site, it has many possible applications, including stone carving, ship building, bridge construction, inspection, pipe or beam fitting and welding. Dr. Albus invented and developed a new generation of robot cranes based on six cables and six winches configured as a Stewart platform. The NIST RoboCraneTM has the capacity to lift and precisely manipulate heavy loads over large volumes with fine control in all six degrees of freedom. Laboratory RoboCranes have demonstrated the ability to manipulate tools such as saws, grinders, and welding torches, and to lift and precisely position heavy objects such as steel beams and cast iron pipe. In 1992, the RoboCrane was selected by Construction Equipment magazine as one of the 100 most significant new products of the year for construction and related industries. It was also selected by [[Popular Science]] magazine for the "Best of What's New" award as one of the 100 top products, technologies, and scientific achievements of 1992.<ref name="Bio08">[http://www.isd.mel.nist.gov/personnel/albus/vitae.htm CURRICULUM VITAE FOR JAMES S. ALBUS] Accessed Aug 2, 2009.</ref> A version of the RoboCrane has been commercially developed for the Air Force to enable rapid paint stripping, inspection, and repainting of very large military aircraft such as the C-5 Galaxy. RoboCrane is expected to save the Air Force $8 million annually at each of its maintenance facilities. This project was recognized in 2008 by a National Laboratories Award for technology transfer. Potential future applications of the RoboCrane include ship building, construction of high rise buildings, highways, bridges, tunnels, and port facilities; cargo handling, ship-to-ship cargo transfer on the high seas, radioactive and toxic waste clean-up; and underwater applications such as salvage, drilling, cable maintenance, and undersea waste site management.<ref name="Bio08"/> == References == {{NIST-PD}} {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.isd.mel.nist.gov/projects/robocrane/ Intelligent Systems Division - Research Areas - Projects RoboCrane and TETRA] *[http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/context/1529294/0 Citations: The NIST ROBOCRANE - Albus, Bostelman, Dagalakis] * [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~Xavier/robocrane.html RoboCrane] a page from [[Carnegie Mellon University]] *[http://www.mel.nist.gov/gallery/robo/robo1.htm MEL Gallery Movies RoboCrane] [[Category:Industrial robots]]</text> </page> <page> <id>32260</id> <title>Robocup Rescue Simulation</title> <text>'''Robocup Rescue Simulation''' is an education and research project intended to promote the development of [[robot]]ic agents for [[search and rescue]].<ref name=RoboRescue>{{cite web |title=RoboCup Rescue Home |url=http://www.robocuprescue.org/ |publisher=RoboCupRescue.org and RoboCupRescue.com |accessdate=2009-06-26}}</ref> The project was initiated in reaction to the [[Great Hanshin earthquake]], which hit [[Hyōgo Prefecture]], Japan, on 17 January 1995, killing more than six thousand people, most of them in the city of [[Kobe]].<ref>{{cite web |date=17 January 2006 |url=http://www.city.kobe.lg.jp/safety/fire/hanshinawaji/higai.html |title=神戸市:被害の状況 |work=阪神・淡路大震災　|publisher= Kobe City |accessdate=2009-06-26}}</ref> According to event organizers, "The intention of the RoboCup Rescue project is to promote research and development in this socially significant domain at various levels involving multi-agent team work coordination, physical robotic agents for search and rescue, information infrastructures, personal digital assistants, a standard simulator and decision support systems, evaluation benchmarks for rescue strategies and robotic systems that [can] all [be] integrated into comprehensive systems in future."<ref name=RoboRescue/> The RoboCup Rescue Simulation Project challenges teams of researchers to design virtual robots to solve various challenges, or to build real, autonomous robots, which are evaluated in specially designed rescue simulations.<ref name=RoboRescue/> The project is one of several competitions operated by [[RoboCup]], which is best known for the Robot Soccer World Cup.<ref name=RoboSoccer>{{cite web |title=RoboCup Rescue |url=http://www.robocup2009.org/21-0-robocup-rescue.html |date=2009 |work=RoboCup 2009 |publisher=RoboCup |accessdate=2009-06-26}}</ref> ==References== {{reflist}} == External links == *[http://www.robocuprescue.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page RoboCup-Rescue Official Wiki (since 2007)] *[http://www.rescuesystem.org/robocuprescue/ RoboCup-Rescue Official Web Page (until 2006)] [[Category:Robotics competitions]] [[Category:Emergency management]] [[ja:ロボカップ#ロボカップレスキュー・シミュレーションリーグ]]</text> </page> <page> <id>32266</id> <title>Robomaxx</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=November 2007}} '''Robomaxx''' is a [[robot]]ic [[vacuum cleaner]]. However, in stark contrast to most other robotic vacuum cleaners, no vacuum cleaner mechanism is present, nor are there any circuits to decide on which path the robot takes. Instead a kind of swiffer cloth is attached to the bottom of the robot and this pushes the dirt along. The robot changes direction because the central wheel has a differential and thus drives into the direction with the least resistance. {{robo-stub}} {{product-stub}} [[Category:Home appliance brands]] [[Category:Domestic robots]] [[Category:Vacuum cleaners]]</text> </page> <page> <id>32268</id> <title>Robonexus</title> <text>'''Robonexus''' is the largest [[robotics]] event in the [[United States|U.S.]].

It has a multi-function remote control that uses infrared technology to talk to it. Unlike the original [[RoboSapien]], the Roboraptor is capable of autonomous movement, using 3 realistic gaits. == Sensors == Roboraptor comes with several [[sensors]] that allow
