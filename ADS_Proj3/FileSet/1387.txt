would give tutorial talks on the first day. Then the technical sessions (and poster sessions in parallel) would follow. == Conferences == * [http://www.ics.forth.gr/eccv2010/intro.php ECCV 2010, Crete] ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] [[Category:Computer science conferences]] [[Category:Computer vision research infrastructure]]</text> </page> <page> <id>12587</id> <title>European Coordinating Committee for Artificial Intelligence</title> <text>{{Wikify|date=December 2010}} The '''European Coordinating Committee for Artificial Intelligence''' ('''ECCAI''') is the representative body for the European [[Artificial Intelligence]] community. Its aim is to promote study, research, and applications of AI in Europe. It was established in 1982. ==Activities== Every even-numbered year, ECCAI, jointly with one of the member associations of ECCAI, holds the [[European Conference on Artificial Intelligence]] (ECAI). The conference has become the leading conference for this field in Europe. The list of ECAI proceedings is available [http://www.eccai.org/ecai.shtml here]. ==Fellowship== {{Empty section|date=August 2009}} ==Member Societies== There is a [http://www.eccai.org/member/index.shtml collection of member societies] which are national AI societies in European countries. ==External links== *[http://www.eccai.org/ The ECCAI Web Site] {{DEFAULTSORT:European Coordinating Committee For Artificial Intelligence}} [[Category:Artificial intelligence associations]] [[Category:Learned societies]] [[Category:Supraorganizations]] {{compu-AI-stub}} {{org-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>12597</id> <title>European Land-Robot Trial</title> <text>{{unref|date=March 2010}} [[Image:EuropeanRobotics.jpg|thumb|Logo of European Robotics]] The '''European Land-Robot Trial (ELROB)''' is a European event which demonstrates the abilities of modern robots. The ELROB is not a competition, like the US [[DARPA Grand Challenge]], but a pure demonstration of what European [[robotics]] is able to achieve today. The scenarios are designed to simulate real world missions, be it military or civilian ones. There are no artificial constraints set to this scenarios to ease the task for the robots like e.g. very visible road markings. This forces the participating teams and systems to fulfil high requirements set by the real world scenarios. The first ''ELROB'' in 2006 was organized by the [[Bundeswehr|German Federal Armed Forces]] and took place on the infantry [[Proving ground|training area]] near [[Hammelburg]], 15-18 May 2006. The goal of the first trial was to boost the development of [[unmanned ground vehicle]]s that could be used in military missions on short notice. The ELROB is an annual event and alternates between a military and a civilian focus each year. European Robotics and the NATO Research Task Group "Military Applications for Multi-Robot Systems" came up with the idea for ELROB in the year 2004. European Robotics aims to bridge the gap between defence and security (D&S) users, industry and research in the field of ground robotics. The ELROB is a good opportunity to follow these goals. Because ELROB is meant to be a European trial, only teams from Europe are allowed. But both teams of commercial and academic backgrounds are allowed. == Civilian ELROB == The civilian ELROB (short C-ELROB) takes place every two years alternating with the military version. It was initiated to allow teams, which are not interested in military missions or cooperation, to attend ELROB, too. Sadly, until today, there is no team that takes part only on the C-ELROB. On the other hand, of course, the defence companies are not that interested in the civilian ELROB. Therefore, the number of teams on C-ELROB is a bit lower than on M-ELROB and organisation is a bit less strict. Most teams do not see C-ELROB as competition or as demonstration, but as possibility to prove their own systems in a challenging field test and new surroundings. It is a great opportunity to learn new things about their robot systems and find new approaches. ELROB is explicitly designed to shape the direction of R&D for the short and medium term and aims to fertilize the co-operation between research and SMEs. === Scenarios === In general the scenarios should be mastered with maximum autonomy, although teleoperation is allowed. The location for the scenario is kept secret until short before the start of the trials and therefore the teams have no chance to generate a detailed map of the area (for example with laser range finders) ahead of their run. The location is described to the participants by GPS coordinates and aerial imagery. ==== Reconnaissance and Surveillance ==== The task in the "Reconnaissance and Surveillance" setting is to reach a given area and explore it. During the exploration special points of interest (normally marked) need to be detected and localized. The position of this points and a photograph should be given to the judges as results of the run. If possible, the robot should return to its starting position, when it finished exploring. ==== Autonomous Navigation ==== The aim of the "Autonomous Navigation" scenario is to follow a given route mostly autonomous. The route will be some kilometers in length. During the traversal of the route points of interest (usually marked) need to be found and localised. Again the position and a photograph of the points of interest need to be given to the judges as results of the run. ==== Camp Security ==== The "Camp Security" scenario requires the robots to guard a predefined area for the time of the scenario run. During the run (marked) intruders will be entering the area and need to be detected, tracked and pursued. An image of the intruder and its location while it was captured need to be given to the judges as result. Capturing means "drive near the intruder and stop", then the captured intruder will leave the area. ==== Transport Mule ==== The "Transport Mule" scenario simulates a shuttle service. The robot should install a shuttle service between two given points as autonomously as possible and shuttle between those points as often as possible during the time of its scenario run. === Past civilian ELROBs === ==== 2007 ==== [[Image:elrob2007.jpg|thumb|300px|ELROB 2007 Logo]] C-ELROB 2007 took place in Monte Ceneri, Swiss (Canton [[Ticino]]), 13-16 August. The area of the trials was part of the truck test track of the Swiss army which meant very difficult ground for the vehicles. With this ELROB the scenario "Autonomous Navigation" was integrated into ELROB for the first time. It was created on public demand to allow bigger vehicles to better show their abilities. Therefore the
