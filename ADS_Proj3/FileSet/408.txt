feel about themselves by how they look at them. This is a state of emotional alienation whereby a person avoids experiencing their subjectivity by identifying themselves with "the look" of the other. The consequence is conflict. In order to keep the person's own being the person must control the other, but must control the freedom of the other "as freedom". These relationships are a profound manifestation of "bad faith" as the for-itself is replaced with the other's freedom. The purpose of either participant is not to exist but to maintain the other participant's looking at them. This system is often mistakenly called love, but is in fact nothing more than emotional alienation and a denial of freedom through conflict with the other. Sartre believes that it is often created as a means of making the unbearable anguish of a person's relationship to their "[[Facticity]]" (all of the concrete details against the background of which human freedom exists and is limited, such as birthplace and time) bearable. At its extreme, the alienation can become so intense that due to the guilt of being so radically enslaved by "the look" and therefore radically missing their own freedoms, the participants can experience masochistic and sadistic attitudes. This happens when the participants cause pain to each other, in attempting to prove their control over the other's look, which they cannot escape because they believe themselves to be so enslaved to the look that experiencing their own subjectivity would be equally unbearable. ===Sex=== {{Expert-subject|philosophy|date=July 2007}} "The look", Sartre explains, is the basis for [[sexual desire]]; Sartre declares that there isn't a biological motivation for [[sex]]. Instead, "double reciprocal incarnation," is a form of mutual awareness which Sartre takes to be at the heart of the sexual experience. This involves the mutual recognition of subjectivity of some sort, as Sartre describes: "I make myself flesh in order to impel the Other to realize for herself and for me her own flesh. My caress causes my flesh to be born for me insofar as it is for the Other flesh causing her to be born as flesh."[http://www.comm287.com/handouts/16.pleasure.pdf] Even in sex (perhaps especially in sex), men and women are haunted by a state in which consciousness and bodily being would be in perfect harmony, with desire satisfied. Such a state, however, can never be. We try to bring the beloved's consciousness to the surface of her/his body by use of magical acts performed, gestures (kisses, desires). But at the moment of [[orgasm]] the illusion is ended and we return to ourselves, just as it is ended when the skier comes to the foot of the mountain or when the commodity that once we desired loses its glow upon our purchase of it. There will be, for Sartre, no such moment of completion because "man is a useless passion" to be the ''ens causa sui,'' the God of the [[ontological proof]]. ===Nothingness=== {{Confusing|date=December 2006}} Sartre contends that human existence is a conundrum whereby each of us exists, for as long as we live, within an overall condition of nothingness (''no thing-ness'')—that ultimately allows for free consciousness. But simultaneously, within our (physical world) ''being'', we are constrained to make continuous, conscious choices. It is this dichotomy that causes anguish, because choice (subjectivity) represents a limit on freedom within an otherwise unbridled range of thoughts. Subsequently, humans seek to flee our anguish through action-oriented constructs such as escapes, visualizations or visions (dreams) designed to lead us toward some meaningful end, such as necessity, destiny, determinism (God), etc. Thus, in living our lives, we often become unconscious ''actors''—Bourgeois, Feminist, Worker, Party Member, Frenchman, Canadian or American—each doing as we must to fulfill our chosen characters' destinies. But again, Sartre contends, our conscious choices, leading to often unconscious actions, run counter to our intellectual freedom. Yet we are bound to the conditioned, physical world—in which some form of action is always required. This leads to ''failed dreams of completion'', as Sartre described them, because inevitably we are unable to bridge the void between the purity and spontaneity of thought and all-too constraining action; between the ''being'' and the ''nothingness'' that inherently coincide in our ''self''. Yet Sartre's recipe for ''fulfillment'' is to escape all quests by ''completing'' them, by rigorously forcing order onto nothingness, using terms such as the "spirit (or consciousness of mind) of seriousness" and describing the failure to do so in terms such as "[[Sartre and bad faith|bad faith]]" and "[[false consciousness]]". Though Sartre's conclusion seems to be that being pales before nothingness, since consciousness is probably based more on spontaneity than on stable seriousness, he contends that any person of a serious nature is ''obligated'' to continuous struggle between: a) the conscious desire for peaceful self-fulfillment through physical actions and social roles—as if living within a portrait that one actively paints of oneself (see the gallery of Bouville's notables in [[Nausea (book)|Nausea]]), and b) the more pure and raging spontaneity of ''no thing'' consciousness, of being instantaneously free to overturn one's roles, pull up stakes, and strike out new paths. ===Phenomenological ontology=== In Sartre's opinion, [[consciousness]] does not make sense by itself: It arises by the awareness of objects. So ''consciousness of'' is the proper way to qualify consciousness. One is always aware ''of an object''. The latter being ''something'' or ''someone'', it accounts to the same. This non-positional quality of consciousness is what makes it an [[ontology]]. And the fact that third parties are the [[tangible]] foundation for the intangible self is what truly makes it a [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] ontology. This section can be re-stated in terms of essence and existence. The waiter "exists" and when he realizes his "bad faith" he is his essence. In other words, existence comes before essence. ==Special terminology used by Sartre== Explanation of terms based on postscript to the English edition of Being and Nothingness by translator Hazel Barnes<ref>{{cite book|last=Sartre|first=Jean-Paul|coauthors=translated by Hazel E.
