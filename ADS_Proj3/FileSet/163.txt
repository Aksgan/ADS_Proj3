called [[AmBX]] Creator which for the first time allows [[AmBX]] users to create their own effects and tag them to events on the PC e.g. multicoloured light shows when you get emails.<ref>http://www.ambx.com/site/consumer/games/applications/creator</ref> '''Research and Development''' [[AmBX]] is being trialled and developed for a variety of diverse applications including wireless alerts for the hard of hearing, possible treatments for seasonally affected depression, jet lag and other media, educational and healthcare applications. Currently the amBIENT XC controls a single DMX universe, recent trialls (2011 and ongoing) have increased this to three, with further improvements likely. In the medium term the technology could output (reflect/mimic) video in enhanced definition. ==Equipment and product== [[AmBX]] technology is now available for the professional and the consumer markets in three formats, PC peripherals, discontinued [[Philips]] Kits and [[Mad Catz]] Cyborg PC Gaming Lights (January 2011 launch at [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]]), [[AmBX]] amBIENT XC professional controller box and as a freely downloadable SDK from the [[AmBX]] website. '''Professional''' amBIENT XC is [[AmBX]]'s professional lighting control unit (from 2010) that is used for architectural, stage, commercial and events applications and also for high end AV installations. '''Consumer''' [[Mad Catz]] have incorporated the technology into their latest pro gaming Cyborg brand via [[AmBX]] enabled PC gaming lights (available 2011) and an [[AmBX]] enabled gaming PC keyboard (available 2011). [[AmBX]] technology allows multiple hardware installations, i.e. more than one set of lights, the software automatically knows its hardware extensions and controls accordingly, more light sets, more/better immersive effects. '''Legacy''' [[Philips]] produced the first commercially available [[AmBX]] enabled consumer equipment in 2007. Available in basic or advanced forms which included [[LED]] and speaker units, LED wall washers and fan and rumble devices. {| class="wikitable" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" |- !

These kits come with speakers integrated into each satellite light. Although each [[wallwasher]] (rear lights) supports a maximum of two satellite lights, two fans, and one rumble pad, several kits may be used on a single PC to create a larger setup. Wallwashers may be used independently of all other devices, but are required for all AmBX applications via [[Philips]] kits. ==History== * '''2001''' First of multiple IP patents lodged for AmBX technology via [[Philips]] research projects. * '''2005''' AmBX technology officially announced via [[Philips]]. * '''2006''' First AmBX enabled games released. * '''2007''' AmBX enabled peripherals become available. * '''2008''' AmBX partners with Ubisoft. * '''2008''' AmBX UK LTD business and technology spins out of Philips. * '''2009''' AmBX UK LTD partners with Sony and receives a tools & middleware license. * '''2009''' AmBX UK LTD releases free SDK via download. * '''2010''' AmBX UK LTD launches professional amBIENT XC controller with DMX512 interface. * '''2010''' AmBX UK LTD partners with Mad Catz to produce PC gaming lights. ==References== <ref>http://www.gamezone.com/ads/interstitial/?oldurl=http://www.gamezone.com/news/item/introversion_announces_ambx_version_of_defcon/</ref> <ref>http://www.atomicmpc.com.au/Feature/89408,ambx---lights-rumble-wind.aspx</ref> <ref>http://www.ambx.com/tapestry/NewsArticle.external?sp=l82&sp=l44&sp=c0</ref> <ref>http://www.madcatz.com/pressreleases/Mad_Catz_Announces_amBX_HDK.pdf</ref> {{Reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.ambx.com amBX UK Ltd. official website] *[http://www.ambx.com/wiki/Main_Page amBX.com Wiki] {{Category:Lighting}} {{Category:Light-emitting_diodes}} [[de:AmBX]]</text> </page> <page> <id>1624</id> <title>Amar Gupta</title> <text>{{Context|date=October 2009}} [[Image:Amar Gupta Picture.png|thumb|right|A 2007 photo of Dr. Amar Gupta]] '''Amar Gupta''' is an [[Financial endowment|endowed professor]] of entrepreneurship, management and organizations, computer science, and Latin American studies at the University of Arizona. ==Background== '''Amar Gupta''' (born 1953) was born in [[Nadiad]], [[India]]. Gupta was admitted to the prestigious [[Indian Institutes of Technology]], [[Kanpur]] to study [[electrical engineering]], graduating in 1974. Gupta started his career working making 8 dollars a week working for IBM, and then served in various technical advisory roles for the Government of [[India]].He received the Rotary Fellowship for International Understanding. This allowed Gupta to pursuit his graduate studies with the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]]. This was the start of a 25 year relationship (1979–2004), where he was first person to have attained the rank of Senior Research Scientist at MIT Sloan. In this position, he launched the United States’ first course on international outsourcing <ref>[http://money.cnn.com/2004/03/11/news/companies/mit_outsourcing/index.htm "New MBA course: Outsourcing "], http://money.cnn.com/ article cites course ''URL retrieved on March 4, 2007.''</ref> with the help of Professor [[Lester Thurow]], eminent economist and former Dean of the MIT Sloan School of Management. Gupta has provided his expertise to several [[UN]] organizations including [[WHO]], [[UNDP]], and [[UNIDO]] for various works in [[Latin America]] and the [[World Bank]] as an advisor on a Distance education endeavor in [[Mozambique]]. Amar Gupta's current appointment is at the [[Eller College of Management]] at the [[University of Arizona]] as the Professor of [[Entrepreneurship]] and MIS; and Senior Director for Research and Business Development. Amar Gupta has developed patented technology and has made innovations in several areas including databases, imaging, healthcare, education, and outsourcing. ==Contributions and Innovations== Amar Gupta has contributed to the following areas through mentoring of students, personal research, scientific discoveries resulting in patents<ref>[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&d=PALL&RefSrch=yes&Query=PN%2F5633954 "United States Patent"],''URL retrieved on March 4, 2007.''</ref> , and contributing ideas that have influenced research in these disciplines. ===Imaging=== Gupta served as chief scientist and vice president for the development of [[VCN ExecuVision]], the first presentation graphics program. This program changed the manner that presentations were given, first in the academic community before making its way to the business community. The company, Visual Communications Network also pioneered the development of [[clip art]] for the IBM personal computer. At [[MIT]], Gupta led a team of researchers to develop technology to automatically read handwritten information on checks and proposed a nationwide check clearance system, allowing the electronic clearance of printed, typed, and handwritten checks.<ref>[http://mitsloan.mit.edu/newsroom/2002-gupta.php "Gupta eyes paperless check clearance "], [[MIT Sloan School of Management|MIT Sloan]] Newsroom ''URL retrieved on March 4, 2007.''</ref> This innovation is manifested in the [[Check 21]] in the U.S. and in similar approaches in
