often mixed with others, adjusting the weights differently for the [[skin]] elasticity and other factors depending on the desired expressions. ==Usage== Several commercial companies are developing products that have been used, but are rather expensive. It is expected that this will become a major input device for computer games once the software is available in an affordable format, but the hardware and software do not yet exist, despite the research for the last 15 years producing results that are almost usable. ==See also== *[[Computer facial animation]] *[[Facial recognition system]] *[[Facial Action Coding System]] *''[[Milo and Kate]]'' ==External links== *[http://www.ri.cmu.edu/labs/lab_51.html Carnegie Mellon University] *[http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cache/papers/cs/24653/http:zSzzSzwww.kbs.twi.tudelft.nlzSzPeoplezSzStaffzSzM.PanticzSzPAMIfinal.pdf/pantic00automatic.pdf/ Delft University of Technology ] *[http://www.intel.com/technology/computing/opencv/overview.htm Intel] *[ftp://ftp.dcs.shef.ac.uk/home/jedge/papers/03usereusemocap.pdf Sheffield and Otago] [[Category:Facial expressions]] [[Category:Computer animation]]</text> </page> <page> <id>13220</id> <title>Factorial experiment</title> <text>In [[statistics]], a full '''factorial experiment''' is an experiment whose design consists of two or more factors, each with discrete possible values or "levels", and whose [[experimental unit]]s take on all possible combinations of these levels across all such factors. A full '''factorial design''' may also be called a '''fully crossed design'''. Such an experiment allows studying the effect of each factor on the [[response variable]], as well as the effects of [[interaction (statistics)|interaction]]s between factors on the response variable. For the vast majority of factorial experiments, each factor has only two levels. For example, with two factors each taking two levels, a factorial experiment would have four treatment combinations in total, and is usually called a ''2×2 factorial design''. If the number of combinations in a full factorial design is too high to be logistically feasible, a [[fractional factorial design]] may be done, in which some of the possible combinations (usually at least half) are omitted. ==History== Factorial designs were used in the 19th century by [[John Bennet Lawes]] and [[Joseph Henry Gilbert]] of the [[Rothamsted Experimental Station]].<ref>{{cite journal | last =[[Frank Yates]] and [[Kenneth Mather]] | title =Ronald Aylmer Fisher | journal =[[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society of London]] | volume =9 | pages =91–120 | date =1963 | url =http://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/coll/special//fisher/fisherbiog.pdf}}</ref> [[Ronald Fisher]] argued in 1926 that "complex" designs (such as factorial designs) were more efficient than studying one factor at a time.<ref>{{cite journal | last =[[Ronald Fisher]] | title =The Arrangement of Field Experiments | journal =[[Journal of the Ministry of Agriculture of Great Britain]] | volume =33 | pages =503–513 | date =1926 | url =http://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/coll/special//fisher/48.pdf}}</ref> Fisher wrote, "No aphorism is more frequently repeated in connection with field trials, than that we must ask Nature few questions, or, ideally, one question, at a time. The writer is convinced that this view is wholly mistaken. Nature, he suggests, will best respond to a logical and carefully thought out questionnaire". A factorial design allows the effect of several factors and even interactions between them to be determined with the same number of trials as are necessary to determine any one of the effects by itself with the same degree of accuracy. [[Frank Yates]] made significant contributions, particularly in the analysis of designs, by the [[Yates analysis]]. The term "factorial" may not have been used in print before 1935, when Fisher used it in his book ''[[The Design of Experiments]]''. [http://jeff560.tripod.com/f.html] ==Example== The simplest factorial experiment contains two levels for each of two factors. Suppose an engineer wishes to study the total power used by each of two different motors, A and B, running at each of two different speeds, 2000 or 3000 RPM. The factorial experiment would consist of four experimental units: motor A at 2000 RPM, motor B at 2000 RPM, motor A at 3000 RPM, and motor B at 3000 RPM. Each combination of a single level selected from every factor is present once. This experiment is an example of a 2<sup>2</sup> (or 2x2) factorial experiment, so named because it considers two levels (the base) for each of two factors (the power or superscript), or #levels<sup>#factors</sup>, producing 2<sup>2</sup>=4 factorial points. [[File:Factorial Design.svg|thumb|left|]] Designs can involve many independent variables. As a further example, the effects of three input variables can be evaluated in eight experimental conditions shown as the corners of a cube. This can be conducted with or without replication, depending on its intended purpose and available resources. It will provide the effects of the three independent variables on the dependent variable and possible interactions. == Notation == {| class="wikitable" border="1" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 1em; text-align:center; width:9em;" |+ 2×2 factorial experiment |- ! !!

The strings have as many symbols as factors, and their values dictate the level of each factor: conventionally, <math>-</math> for the first (or low) level, and <math>+</math> for the second (or high) level. The points in this experiment can thus be represented as <math>--</math>, <math>+-</math>, <math>-+</math>, and <math>++</math>. The factorial points can also be abbreviated by (1), a, b, and ab, where the presence of a letter indicates that the specified factor is at its high (or second) level and the absence of a letter indicates that the specified factor is at its low (or first) level (for example, "a" indicates that factor A is on its high setting, while all other factors are at their low (or first) setting). (1) is used to indicate that all factors are at their lowest (or first) values. ==Implementation== For more than two factors, a 2<sup>k</sup> factorial experiment can be usually recursively designed from a 2<sup>k-1</sup> factorial experiment by replicating the 2<sup>k-1</sup> experiment, assigning the first replicate to the first (or low) level of the new factor, and the second replicate to the second (or high) level. This framework can be generalized to, ''e.g.'', designing three replicates for three level factors, ''etc''. A factorial experiment allows for estimation of [[experimental error]] in two ways.
