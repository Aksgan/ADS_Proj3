The park is managed by the [[Department of Conservation and Recreation (Massachusetts)|Department of Conservation and Recreation]] and provides scenic views and a number of recreational opportunities, including fishing and hiking &ndash; but swimming or climbing near the falls is prohibited. Bash Bish State Park consists of numerous [[Canyon|gorges]] and an [[Eastern Hemlock]] ravine forest. The slopes around the waterfall are covered by forests of trees such as [[maple]], [[oak]], and [[beech]]. Wildlife includes the [[timber rattlesnake]], the [[peregrine falcon]], [[bobcat]]s, [[American black bear|black bear]]s, and [[porcupine]]s. The park is open from dawn to dusk. The falls are reached via a moderately strenuous uphill trail. No facilities are provided. Carry in – carry out all belongings. The park is one of a cluster of nature preserves in the extreme southwestern corner of Massachusetts noted for their scenery. It is adjacent to the [[Mount Everett State Reservation]] and the {{convert|4000|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Mount Washington State Forest]], as well as New York's {{convert|5000|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Taconic State Park]].<ref>[http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/western/bash.htm Bash Bish Falls State Park]</ref> ==Notes== {{reflist}} == External links == * [http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/western/bash.htm Official park site] * [http://www.berkshireweb.com/sports/parks/bash.html Another site on the park] * {{gnis|607293}} {{Protected Areas of Massachusetts}} [[Category:Taconic Mountains]] [[Category:Massachusetts state parks]] [[Category:Massachusetts natural resources]] [[Category:Parks in Berkshire County, Massachusetts]]</text> </page> <page> <id>3414</id> <title>Bashir Rameyev</title> <text>{{Infobox scientist |name=Bashir Rameyev |image=Bashir_Rameev.jpg |image_width= |caption= |birth_date={{Birth date|1918|5|1|df=yes}} |birth_place=[[Baymak]], [[Ufa Governorate]], [[Russian SFSR]] |death_date={{Death date and age|1994|5|16|1918|5|1|df=yes}} |death_place=[[Moscow]], [[Russia]] |residence=[[Russian SFSR]], [[Soviet Union]] |nationality=[[Tatar]] |field=[[Computer scientist]] |work_institutions=[[USSR Academy of Sciences]]<br />Special Design Bureau-245 (Russian: СКБ-245)<br />[[National Research Nuclear University "MEPhI"]]<br />Scientific Research Institute of Control Computers<br />USSR State Committee on Science and Technology |known_for=First USSR patent in electronic computing<br />[[Strela computer]]<br />[[Ural]] computer series |prizes=[[Stalin Prize]] }} '''Bashir Iskandarovich Rameyev''' ({{lang-ru|Баши́р Исканда́рович Раме́ев}}; May 1, 1918 – May 16, 1994) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] inventor and scientist, one of the founders of Soviet computing, author of 23 [[patent]]s,<ref>Л.Н. Ефремов. (1985). ''Справка об изобретательной деятельности Рамеева Башира Искандаровича.'' Архив Московского Политехнического Музея. Стр.1.</ref> including the first officially registered in the USSR patent in the field of electronic computers—a patent for the Automatic Electronic Digital Machine (1948).<ref>Авторское свидетельство # 10475 от 4 декабря 1948 г., Архив Политехнического Музея, Москва.</ref> Rameyev's inventions paved the way for the development of a new field in Soviet science—electronic computing—and for the formation of a new branch of industry that supported it. The central ideas incorporated in Rameyev's invention of the electronic computer included: storing programs in [[computer memory]], using [[binary code]], utilizing external devices, and deploying [[electronic circuits]] and [[semiconductor]] [[diode]]s. The first publication about similar technology outside of the USSR appeared in 1949-1950.<ref>Л.Н. Ефремов. (1985). ''Справка об изобретательной деятельности Рамеева Башира Искандаровича.''

Киев: Фирма Кит, ПТОО А.С.К., стр.240-242. </ref> Rameyev also suggested that intermediate computation data be automatically printed on [[punched tape]] and sent into the computer's arithmetic device for subsequent processing, meaning that the processing of commands would be performed in the computer’s arithmetic device; this is usually referred to as the [[Von Neumann architecture]].<ref>Georg Trogemann; Alexander Nitussov, Wolfgang Ernst, eds. (2001) ''Computing in Russia: The History of Computer Devices and Information Technology Revealed.'' Braunschweig and Wiesbaden: Vieweg & Sohn Verlagsgesellsschaft mbH,. p. 149.</ref> Of particular note is Rameyev's invention of diode-matrix control circuits, which were used to build his first brainchild, the first serially manufactured Soviet mainframe "[[Strela]]" (1954).<ref>Л.Н. Ефремов. (1985). ''Справка об изобретательной деятельности Рамеева Башира Искандаровича. Архив Московского Политехнического Музея.'' Стр.3.</ref> In the 1950s, the diode-matrix control circuits were not widespread due to their significant dimensions and high power consumption. However, with subsequent development of [[microelectronics]] and the emergence of large-scale [[integrated circuit]]s, which made possible to deploy tens or hundreds of thousands of [[diode]]s and [[transistors]] in a single piece of [[silicon]], the concept of control circuits became viable and commonly used. "[[Strela]]" computers carried out calculations in [[nuclear physics]], rocketry and space research.<ref>Л.Н. Ефремов. (1985). Ibid, стр.2.</ref>Notably, one of “[[Strela]]s" was used to calculate “[[Sputnik]]” orbit trajectory. For the development of "[[Strela]]" Rameyev and his team were awarded the [[Stalin Prize]] of 1st degree, which was the highest Soviet award at that time.<ref>Georg Trogemann; Alexander Nitussov, Wolfgang Ernst, eds. (2001) ''Computing in Russia: The History of Computer Devices and Information Technology Revealed.'' Braunschweig and Wiesbaden: Vieweg & Sohn Verlagsgesellsschaft mbH,. p. 150.</ref> Between 1956 and 1969, Rameyev designed and oversaw the manufacturing of 14 different computers including: the multi-purpose "[[Ural]]" computer series and the specialized machines “Weather” (“Погода”) , "Crystal" (“Кристалл”), "Granite" (“Гранит”), and “Coordinate” (“Координата”).<ref>Л.Н. Ефремов. (1985). ''Справка об изобретательной деятельности Рамеева Башира Искандаровича. Архив Московского Политехнического Музея.'' Стр.2.</ref> Rameyev's "famous computer family '[[Ural]]' existed more than 15 years and had good chances to be one of the corner stones of future Russian computer engineering".<ref>Georg Trogemann; Alexander Nitussov, Wolfgang Ernst, eds.

His father was targeted by the Soviets and perished in [[labor camp]]s during [[Stalinist purges]]. <ref>Борис Николаевич Малиновский. (1995). ''История Вычислительной Техники в Лицах.'' Киев: Фирма Кит, ПТОО А.С.К., стр. 237.</ref> This branded Rameyev, who was by then a sophomore at the [[Moscow Power Engineering Institute]], as a son of “the [[enemy of the people]]”. As a result, he faced coarse, overt and systematic discrimination, which began with university expulsion and job rejections and lasted until the breakout of [[WWII]]. <ref>Малиновский. (1995). Ibid, стр. 238.</ref>Despite his impeccable record of service in the [[Soviet Army]] during WWII, Rameyev encountered the same unfounded discrimination when he returned from the front. As the last resort, he wrote a letter to [[Stalin]] asking for help. Instead of helpful
