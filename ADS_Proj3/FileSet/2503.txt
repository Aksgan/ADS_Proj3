pragmatic intent. The tools are just different ways to work around certain types of problems but they do not solve them for you or always highlight the underlying cause of many types of problems. The tools employed at Toyota are often used to expose particular problems that are then dealt with, as each tool's limitations or blindspots are perhaps better understood. So, for example, [[Value Stream Mapping]] focuses upon material and information flow problems (a title built into the Toyota title for this activity) but is not strong on Metrics, Man or Method. Internally they well know the limits of the tool and understood that it was never intended as the best way to see and analyze every waste or every problem related to quality, downtime, personnel development, cross training related issues, capacity bottlenecks, or anything to do with profits, safety, metrics or morale, etc. No one tool can do all of that. For surfacing these issues other tools are much more widely and effectively used. # '''Management technique rather than change agents''' has been a principle in Toyota from the early 1950s when they started emphasizing the development of the production manager's and supervisors' skills set in guiding natural work teams and did not rely upon staff-level change agents to drive improvements. This can manifest itself as a "Push" implementation of Lean rather than "Pull" by the team itself. This area of skills development is not that of the change agent specialist, but that of the natural operations work team leader. Although less prestigious than the TPS specialists, development of work team supervisors in Toyota is considered an equally, if not more important, topic merely because there are tens of thousands of these individuals. Specifically, it is these manufacturing leaders that are the main focus of training efforts in Toyota since they lead the daily work areas, and they directly and dramatically affect quality, cost, productivity, safety, and morale of the team environment. In many companies implementing Lean the reverse set of priorities is true. Emphasis is put on developing the specialist, while the supervisor skill level is expected to somehow develop over time on its own. ==Lean services== {{Main|Lean services}} Lean, as a concept or brand, has captured the imagination of many in different spheres of activity. Examples of these from many sectors are listed below. Lean principles have been successfully applied to call center services to improve live agent call handling. By combining Agent-assisted Voice solutions and Lean's waste reduction practices, a company reduced handle time, reduced between agent variability, reduced accent barriers, and attained near perfect process adherence. <ref name="isixsigma">{{cite web | author=Adsit, Dennis | title=Cutting Edge Methods Target Real Call Center Waste | url=http://www.isixsigma.com/library/content/c070611a.asp | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080414194658/http://www.isixsigma.com/library/content/c070611a.asp | archivedate=2008-04-14 | work=isixsigma.com | accessdate=19 April 2008 }}</ref> Lean principles have also found application in software application development and maintenance and other areas of [[information technology]] (IT).<ref>Hanna, Julia. &ldquo;[http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/5741.html Bringing &lsquo;Lean&rsquo; Principles to Service Industries]&rdquo;.

A study conducted on behalf of the Scottish Executive, by Warwick University, in 2005/06 found that Lean methods were applicable to the public sector, but that most results had been achieved using a much more restricted range of techniques than Lean provides.<ref name="scotland.gov">{{cite web | author=Radnor, Dr Zoe | coauthors= Paul Walley, Andrew Stephens, Giovanni Bucci | title=Evaluation Of The Lean Approach To Business Management And Its Use In The Public Sector | url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/06/13162106/0 | work=scotland.gov.uk | accessdate=19 April 2008 }}</ref> The challenge in moving Lean to services is the lack of widely available reference implementations to allow people to see how directly applying lean manufacturing tools and practices can work and the impact it does have. This makes it more difficult to build the level of belief seen as necessary for strong implementation. However, some research does relate widely recognized examples of success in retail and even airlines to the underlying principles of lean.<ref name="ruffa" /> Despite this, it remains the case that the direct manufacturing examples of 'techniques' or 'tools' need to be better 'translated' into a service context to support the more prominent approaches of implementation, which has not yet received the level of work or publicity that would give starting points for implementors. The upshot of this is that each implementation often 'feels its way' along as must the early industrial engineers of Toyota. This places huge importance upon sponsorship to encourage and protect these experimental developments. == Lean goals and strategy== The espoused goals of Lean manufacturing systems differ between various authors.
