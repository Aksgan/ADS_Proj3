It was designed at [[Bell Labs]] by [[Rob Pike]] in the late 1980s. Newsqueak's syntax and semantics are influenced by the [[C (programming language)|C language]], but its approach to concurrency was inspired by [[C. A. R. Hoare]]'s [[communicating sequential processes]] (CSP). However, in Newsqueak, [[channel (programming)|channels]] are [[first-class object]]s, with dynamic process creation and dynamic channel creation. Newsqueak was developed from an earlier, smaller, language, called Squeak (not to be confused with the [[Smalltalk]] implementation [[Squeak]]). It was developed by [[Luca Cardelli]] and [[Rob Pike]] as a language for implementing [[graphical user interface]]s. The ideas present in Newsqueak were further developed in the programming languages [[Alef (programming language)|Alef]], [[Limbo (programming language)|Limbo]], and [[Go (programming language)|Go]]. == See also == * [[Inferno (operating system)]] * [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs]] ==References== *[http://swtch.com/~rsc/thread/ Bell Labs and CSP Threads] *[http://swtch.com/~rsc/thread/newsqueak.pdf Newsqueak: A Language for Communicating with Mice] [[Category:C programming language family]] [[Category:Concurrent programming languages]] {{Compu-lang-stub}}</text> </page> <page>
