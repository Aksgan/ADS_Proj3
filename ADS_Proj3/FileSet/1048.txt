Lauderdale]]. It was built on an apple computer, the program was stored in [[EPROM]], the list could be backed up to mini [[compact cassette|cassette]]s. VTA Technologies later became da Vinci Systems, Inc in 1984. The Wiz was the first color correction system to have a customized external control panel and was also the first color corrector with internal primary and secondary processing. Prior to that, the primaries in the [[telecine]] were used. The Wiz had 10 vector [[patent]]ed secondary color correction. The first two systems were bought by Editel, [[Chicago]], which at the time used the color corrector on [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[Fernseh]]'s FDL60 telecine. *'''da Vinci Classic''' [[analog transmission|analog]] system was manufactured from 1985 to 1990 and had customized external control panel with internal primary, secondary processing and an internal [[NTSC]] encoder. It ran on a [[Motorola]] [[68000]] Multi Bus 1 system [[computer]]. The program and color correction list were stored on a 20MB MFM [[hard disk]], with backup to a 5.25" [[floppy disk]]. Its features include: • Analog RGB(Y) path<br /> • Primary and 16 vector secondaries.<br /> • Onboard 68000 CPU<br /> • Small MFM hard drive<br /> • Two control panels (power supplied from mainframe by resistive cable)<br /> • Heavy linear PSU.<br /> • Flat pack chassis with PCB access from above<br /> Options include:<br /> • Hard edged simple XY window<br /> • Onboard NTSC decoder<br /> • NR control, prestore processing for MK3 Digi 4 (and some 3) telecines<br /> • RGB(Y) and NTSC/PAL outputs. 525 or 625 or both<br /> • B & W menu monitor<br /> Used with FDL60/90 and MK3 telecines (Not URSA) and tape-to-tape. Early models had knob only color correction controls. Later had joyballs. Many in use but becoming difficult on support and parts. *'''da Vinci Renaissance''' was the analog system that followed the Classic analog system and was manufactured from 1990 to 1993. It was similar to the above system, but ran on [[Motorola]] 68020 Multi Bus 1 system with a 3.5" floppy. Its features included: • Improved channel and secondaries (later versions). <br /> • Onboard 68000 CPU (early) or 68020 CPU (later). <br /> • MFM Hard Drive.<br /> • The early/budget 68000 models had two control panels and 16 vector secondaries same as the Classic. The later 68020 versions usually feature “Kilovectors” advanced secondary correction and have three control panels. <br /> Options included:<br /> • Hard edged simple XY Window<br /> • NR control<br /> • Prestore processing for MK3 Digi 4 (and some 3) telecines<br /> • RGB(Y) and NTSC/PAL outputs. <br /> • Heavy linear PSU.<br /> 12V panels were on early versions, 5V panels with separate PSU on later versions (not interchangeable with 12v panels). 525 or 625 or both. B & W menu monitor. Used with FDL60, FDL90, MK3 types, URSA telecines and Tape to Tape. Some versions used an extra interface module (the EMC unit) to function with the URSA serial control busses. Normally used with a separate TLC editor (1 or 2) and an additional interface is required for this on URSA installations. Many in use but becoming difficult on support and parts. *''''da Vinci Renaissance 888'''' was similar to the above system, but had 888 [[digital]] [[video]] processing, in place of the analog video processing. This system was manufactured from 1993–1995. The all-digital system's features included: • Can operate with [[4:2:2]], 4:4:4 or [[4:2:2#8:4:4 Y.27CbCr|8:4:4]] input in [[NTSC]] or [[Pal]].<br /> • 16 bit 8:8:8 (internally) 27 MHz sampling SD signal path<br /> • Onboard 68020 CPU<br /> • B&W menu monitor - 525 or 625 or both. Character based display. No mouse.<br /> • MFM HD but IDE upgrade option sometimes fitted Additional options for the digital 888 included:<br /> • “Power Windows” (One only) a very powerful feature which enables area isolation with soft edges and various shapes. <br /> • YSFX which is independently adjustable luminance and chrominance ratios which can be wound from full pos thru zero to neg. <br /> • Custom Curves and a Key Input channel. <br /> • Used with FDL60, FDL90. <br /> • Quadra (reqs 4:4:4 option)<br /> • MK3 types<br /> • URSA telecines. Early versions had a double backplane chassis (4:2:2 only) and used an extra interface module, the EMC, to function with URSA control busses. 888s are normally used with a separate TLC1 or 2 editor and an additional interface is required for this on URSA installations. *da Vinci also made the '''da Vinci Light'''. This was not marketed, so not many were sold. It is a da Vinci DUI 888 without the digital 888 cards. The telecine interface card controlled the telecine's internal color corrector. This came in two configurations; the first was the DUI with an [[SGI Indy]] [[workstation]]. The second DUI system used an [[SGI O2]] workstation. These systems supported da Vinci's new control panels. *The da Vinci '''2K Color Corrector''', manufactured starting in 2000, is a completely revised color correction system that supports supports [[HDTV]], [[SDTV]], 2k and, with a Splice upgrade, 4k formats. The current system is the '''2k Plus''' an improved 2k Color Corrector. The 2k Plus is used on high-end DataCines and telecines, Like [[Thomson SA|Thomson]]-[[Grass Valley (company)|Grass Valley]]'s Spirit Datacine and [[Cintel]]'s C-Reality
