testing the mastery of [[orthography]] and [[grammar]]. Since many features of [[French grammar]] are distinguished in writing but not in speech, this can be a challenging task. Certain ''dictées'' became famous for their difficulty or their interest, like those of [[Prosper Mérimée]] and [[Bernard Pivot]]. In several countries of the world (including [[Switzerland]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], and [[Canada]]), the dictations are the subject of structured championships, similar to English [[spelling bee]]s. ==Badasseugi== In [[South Korea]], '''badasseugi''' ([[Hangul]]: 받아쓰기) is a school exercise for children in the lower grades of [[Primary education|elementary school]]s. The [[Korean language]] is written using [[Hangul]], which is basically a [[Phoneme|phonemic]] alphabet; however, Hangul writing is also [[morphophonemic]], so [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] knowledge (in addition to familiarity with Hangul) is necessary for correct dictation. Also, [[Phonology|phonological]] rules such as [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]], [[palatalization]], and deletion can cause pronunciation to be different from what the written form may suggest. Badasseugi may take form of a word, a phrase, or a sentence, and is similar to spelling tests. == See also == *[[Spelling bee]] == External links == * [http://www.parisbypod.com/category/weekly-french-program/dictation/ Dictation exercises in French] * [http://softlab.webeve.net/dictation.htm Dictation tool in Japanese] [[Category:Writing]] [[fr:Dictée]] [[he:הכתבה]] [[nl:Dictee]] [[pl:Dyktando]] [[sr:Диктирање]] [[uk:Диктант]] [[zh:听写]]</text> </page> <page> <id>10238</id> <title>Didactic organisation</title> <text>'''Didactic organisation''' is the ability of [[neuron]]s within a network to impart their pattern of [[synapse|synaptic connectivity]] and/or [[response properties]] to other neurons. The term didactic is used because this kind of influence is unidirectional; each individual instance of didactic organisation between two connected neurons does not involve a bidirectional transfer of connectivity or response property information between them. ==Experimental and theoretical evidence== Evidence for didactic organisation ''[[in vivo]]'' was first discovered through research into synaptic reorganisation in primary visual cortex that compared the results of neuronal recording experiments and computational models <ref name=Young>Young ''et al.'', 2007</ref>. However, the tendency of [[spike-timing-dependent plasticity]] to separate neurons into ‘teachers’ and ‘students’ had previously been predicted in theory based on computational modelling results alone <ref name=Song>Song and Abbott, 2001</ref>. ==Spike-timing-dependent plasticity== Didactic organisation is primarily a consequence of spike-timing-dependent plasticity, because when the neurons within an interconnected network undergo [[action potentials]] (or ‘spikes’) at approximately the same time (within the order of tens of milliseconds) the [[Efferent nerve|efferent synaptic connections]] of neurons that spike early will have their efficacy increased ([[long-term potentiation]]), while neurons that spike late will have the efficacy of their efferent synaptic connections decreased ([[long-term depression]]).<ref name=Young/><ref name=Song/> ==Causal activity== While spike-timing-dependent plasticity is an essential ingredient for didactic organisation, other features of neuronal activity appear to be required for didactic organisation to occur ''in vivo''. One of these features is that activity propagated through a network needs to have a 'causal' character <ref name=Young/>. For example, chain of reciprocally connected neurons with this ‘causal activity’ characteristic would be capable of propagating a wave of spikes along its length, rather than the wave disintegrating into a cascade of spikes ‘bouncing’ back and forth between neurons in the chain. ==Activity propagation== A third important feature for didactic organisation in vivo concerns the spatial scale of spike propagation within a network. While it is expected that didactic organisation will always be present among neurons that exhibit spike timing-dependent plasticity and causal activity (see above), the spatial scale over which didactic organisation can occur between neurons within a network should be limited by the spatial scale of spike propagation. Evidence suggests that the scale of spike propagation can be actively controlled by adjusting the balance of [[excitatory postsynaptic potential|excitation]] and [[inhibitory postsynaptic potential|inhibition]] within a network (a balance that can be modulated by [[Synaptic plasticity|synaptic scaling]], for example), thus providing a means by which a network can actively control when and to what extent didactic organisation can occur <ref name=Young/>. For this reason, and the very specific connectivity patterns that can be achieved via didactic organisation, it has been speculated that didactic organisation may play an important role in brain development. ==See also== * [[Synaptic plasticity]] * [[Spike-timing-dependent plasticity]] ==Notes== {{reflist|1}} ==References== * Young, J.
