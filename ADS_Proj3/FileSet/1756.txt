80–98</ref> These are among the first things a player learns after understanding the rules. Recognizing the possibility that stones can be captured using these techniques is an important step forward. <div class="thumb tright"> <div class="thumbinner" style="width:184px; font-size: 100%;"> {{Goban 9x9|= | ul| u| u| u| u| u| u| u| u|= | l| | w| | | | | | |= | l| w| b| w| | | | | |= | l| w| b1| b3| w4| | | | |= | l| | w2| b5| b7| w8| | | |= | l| | | w6| b9| | | | |= | l| | | | 10| | | | |= | l| | | | | | | | |= | l| | | | | | | | |20}} <div class="thumbcaption" style="font-size: 88%;"> A ladder. Black cannot escape unless the ladder connects to friendly stones further down the board. </div> </div> </div> The most basic technique is the ''ladder''.<ref name=Ladder>Kim 1994 pp. 88–90</ref> To capture stones in a ladder, a player uses a constant series of capture threats—called ''atari''—to force the opponent into a zigzag pattern as shown in the diagram to the right. Unless the pattern runs into friendly stones along the way, the stones in the ladder cannot avoid capture. Experienced players will recognize the futility of continuing the pattern and will play elsewhere. The presence of a ladder on the board does give a player the option to play a stone in the path of the ladder, thereby threatening to rescue their stones, forcing a response. Such a move is called a ''ladder breaker'' and may be a powerful strategic move. In the diagram, Black has the option of playing a ladder breaker. <div class="thumb tleft"> <div class="thumbinner" style="width:184px; font-size: 100%;"> {{Goban 9x9|= | ul| u| u| u| u| u| u| u| u|= | l| | b| | | | | | |= | b| | b| w| w| | | | |= | l| b| w| b| w| | | | |= | l| | w| b| | | | | |= | l| | w| b| | | | | |= | l| | w| | w1| | | | |= | l| | | | | | | | |= | l| | | | | | | | |20}} <div class="thumbcaption" style="font-size: 88%;"> A net. The chain of three black stones cannot escape in any direction. </div> </div> </div> Another technique to capture stones is the so-called ''net'',<ref name=Net>Kim 1994 pp. 91–92</ref> also known by its Japanese name, ''geta''. This refers to a move that loosely surrounds some stones, preventing their escape in all directions. An example is given in the diagram to the left. It is generally better to capture stones in a net than in a ladder, because a net does not depend on the condition that there are no opposing stones in the way, nor does it allow the opponent to play a strategic ladder breaker. <div class="thumb tright"> <div class="thumbinner" style="width:184px; font-size: 100%;"> {{Goban 9x9|= | ul| u| u| u| u| u| u| u| u|= | l| | | b| b| | | | |= | l| | b| | | | | | |= | l| | b| w| w| | | | |= | l| | w| b| c| w| | | |= | l| | w| b| w1| b| b| | |= | l| | | w| b| | | | |= | l| | | w| b| | | | |= | l| | | | b| | | | |20}} <div class="thumbcaption" style="font-size: 88%;"> A snapback. Although Black can capture the white stone by playing at the circled point, White can then ''snap back'' by playing at '''1''' again. </div> </div> </div> A third technique to capture stones is the ''snapback''.<ref name=SnapBack>Kim 1994 pp. 93–94</ref> In a snapback, one player allows a single stone to be captured, then immediately plays on the point formerly occupied by that stone; by so doing, the player captures a larger group of their opponent's stones, in effect ''snapping back'' at those stones. An example can be seen on the right. As with the ladder, an experienced player will not play out such a sequence, recognizing the futility of capturing only to be captured back immediately. ===Reading ahead=== One of the most important skills required for strong tactical play is the ability to read ahead. Reading ahead includes considering available moves to play, the possible responses to each move, and the subsequent possibilities after each of those responses. Some of the strongest players of the game can read up to 40 moves ahead even in complicated positions.<ref name=TreasureChest>{{citation | chapter = Memories of Kitani | title = The Treasure Chest Enigma | last = Nakayama | first = Noriyuki | publisher = Slate & Shell | year = 1984 | isbn = 1-932001-27-1 | pages =16–19}}</ref> As explained in the scoring rules, some stone formations can never be captured and are said to be alive, while other stones may be in the position where they cannot avoid being captured and are said to be dead. Much of the practice material available to students of the game comes in the form of life and death problems, also known as ''[[tsumego]]''.<ref name=Tsumego>{{Citation | url = http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/columns/0001/305.htm | last = van Zeijst | first = Rob | publisher = [[Yomiuri Shimbun]] | title = Whenever a player asks a top professional… | accessdate = 2008-06-09}}</ref> In such problems, players are challenged to find the vital move sequence that will kill a group of the opponent or save a group of their own. Tsumego are considered an excellent way to train a player's ability at reading ahead,<ref name=Tsumego/> and are available for all skill levels, some posing a challenge even to top players. ===Ko fighting=== In situations when the [[Ko rule]] applies, a ko fight may occur.<ref name="Ko"/> If the player who is prohibited from capture is of the opinion that the
