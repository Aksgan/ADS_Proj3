the explosion of amateur robotic telescopes was the availability of relatively inexpensive CCD cameras, which appeared on the commercial market in the early 1990s. These cameras not only allowed amateur astronomers to make pleasing images of the night sky, but also encouraged more sophisticated amateurs to pursue research projects in cooperation with professional astronomers. The main motive behind the development of amateur robotic telescopes has been the tedium of making research-oriented astronomical observations, such as taking endlessly repetitive images of a variable star. In 1998, [[Bob Denny]] conceived of a software interface standard for astronomical equipment, based on [[Microsoft]]'s [[Component Object Model]], which he called the [[Astronomy Common Object Model]] (ASCOM). He also wrote and published the first examples of this standard, in the form of commercial telescope control and image analysis programs, and several freeware components. He also convinced [[Doug George]] to incorporate ASCOM capability into a commercial camera control software program. Through this technology, a master control system that integrated these applications could easily be written in [[perl]], [[VBScript]], or [[JavaScript]]. A sample script of that nature was provided by Denny. Following coverage of ASCOM in ''[[Sky & Telescope]]'' magazine several months later, ASCOM [[architect]]s such as Bob Denny, Doug George, [[Tim Long]], and others later influenced ASCOM into becoming a set of codified interface standards for [[freeware]] [[device driver]]s for telescopes, CCD cameras, telescope focusers, and astronomical observatory domes. As a result amateur robotic telescopes have become increasingly more sophisticated and reliable, while software costs have plunged. ASCOM has also been adopted for some professional robotic telescopes. Meanwhile, ASCOM users designed ever more capable master control systems. Papers presented at the [[Minor Planet Amateur-Professional Workshop]]s (MPAPW) in 1999, 2000, and 2001 and the [[International Amateur-Professional Photoelectric Photometry]] Conferences of 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003 documented increasingly sophisticated master control systems. Some of the capabilities of these systems included automatic selection of observing targets, the ability to interrupt observing or rearrange observing schedules for targets of opportunity, automatic selection of guide stars, and sophisticated error detection and correction algorithms. Remote telescope system development started in 1999, with first test runs on real telescope hardware in early 2000. RTS2 was primary intended for [[Gamma ray burst]] follow-up observations, so ability to interrupt observation was core part of its design. During development, it became an integrated observatory management suite. Other additions included use of the [[Postgresql]] database for storing targets and observation logs, ability to perform image processing including astrometry and performance of the real-time telescope corrections and a web-based user interface. RTS2 was from the beginning designed as a completely [[open source]] system, without any proprietary components. In order to support growing list of mounts, sensors, CCDs and roof systems, it uses own, text based communication protocol. The RTS2 system is described in papers appearing in 2004 and 2006. The [[Instrument Neutral Distributed Interface]] (INDI) was started in 2003. In comparison to the [[Microsoft Windows]] centric ASCOM standard, INDI is a platform independent protocol developed by Elwood C. Downey of ClearSky Institute to support control, automation, data acquisition, and exchange among hardware devices and software frontends. ==Significance== By 2004, robotic observations accounted for an overwhelming percentage of the published scientific information on asteroid [[orbit]]s and discoveries, variable star studies, [[supernova]] [[light curve]]s and discoveries, comet orbits and [[gravitational lens|gravitational microlensing]] observations. All early phase [[Gamma ray burst]] observations were carried by robotic telescopes. ==See also== * [[List of telescope types]] * [[Remote Telescope Markup Language]] ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.astro.physik.uni-goettingen.de/~hessman/MONET/links.html List] of professional robotic telescopes (with map and statistics). *[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.51.9564&rep=rep1&type=pdf Robotic telescopes: An interactive exhibit on the world-wide web] provides an overview of telescope operation through the internet [[Category:Telescope types]] [[Category:Robotic telescopes]] [[it:Telescopio robotico]] [[ja:リモートテレスコープ]]</text> </page> <page> <id>32321</id> <title>Robotic vacuum cleaner</title> <text>[[File:Electrolux trilobite.jpg|300px|thumb|The [[Electrolux Trilobite]] was the first mass produced robotic vacuum cleaner.]] A '''robotic vacuum cleaner''', often called a '''robovac''', is an [[autonomous robot]]ic [[vacuum cleaner]] that has intelligent programming and a limited vacuum cleaning system.

RCSA first started with partnerships with [[Motoman]] and Private Career Colleges in [[Canada]]. The partnerships grew to have included [[ABB Group|ABB]], [[Motoman]] and [[Panasonic]]. In 2006 RCSA was invited to join the [[American Welding Society|American Welding Society (AWS)]] D16 committee to provide robotics and testing expertise in the development of America’s first robotic welding exam (CRAW). RCSA accepted this challenge and worked alongside [[Lincoln Electric|Lincoln Electric Automation]], [[ABB Group|ABB]] and Wolf Robotics to develop the details and procedures of the CRAW which was launched in June 2008. In 2009 the RCSA redesigned the [[American Welding Society|AWS]] CRAW course to fit the needs of a global market. This International Robotic Welding Certification (Certified Robotic Welder - CRW) was developed and launched early 2010. The RCSA gained recognition in 2009 by the [[Government of Canada]] and the [[Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities (Ontario)|Ministry of Training Colleges and Universities (MTCU)]] as the robotics subject matter experts in [[North America]]. == History == * Organization founded in 1996 * Certified Industrial Robotics Programmer (CIRP) course was established in 1999 * Industrial Partnerships with [[Motoman]]
