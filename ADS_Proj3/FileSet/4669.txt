= S^{max} \sqrt{1 - \frac{1- \sqrt{1 - \Delta ^2}}{2}}</math> which depends on the ''nonorthogonality integral'' Δ: :<math>\Delta = \frac{1}{1+m+n} \left [ 1+m \cos \alpha + \frac{n}{2}(3 \cos ^2 \alpha -1) \right ]</math> The energy contribution is added twice, once per each of the bonding orbitals involved in the angle (which may have different hybridizations and different values for ''k''). For non-hypervalent p-block atoms, the hybridization value ''n'' is zero (no d-orbital contribution), and ''m'' is obtained as %p(1-%p), where %p is the p character of the orbital obtained from :<math>%p_i = \frac{n_p wt_i}{\sum_{j} wt_j}</math> where the sum over ''j'' includes all ligands, lone pairs, and radicals on the atom, ''n<sub>p</sub>'' is the "gross hybridization" (for example, for an "sp<sup>2</sup>" atom, ''n<sub>p</sub>'' = 2). The weight ''wt<sub>i</sub>'' depends on the two elements involved in the bond (or just one for lone pair or radicals), and represents the preference for p character of different elements. The values of the weights are empirical, but can be rationalized in terms of Bent's rule. ===Hypervalent molecules=== For hypervalent molecules, the energy is represented as a combination of VALBOND configurations, which are akin to resonance structures that place [[three-center four-electron bond]]s (3c4e) in different ways. For example, ClF<sub>3</sub> is represented as having one "normal" two-center bond and one 3c4e bond. There are three different configurations for ClF<sub>3</sub>, each one using a different Cl-F bond as the two-center bond. For more complicated systems the number of combinations increases rapidly; SF<sub>6</sub> has 45 configurations. :<math>E_{tot} = \sum_j c_j E_j</math> where the sum is over all configurations ''j'', and the coefficient ''c<sub>j</sub>'' is defined by the function :<math>c_j = \frac{\displaystyle \prod_{i=1}^{hype} \cos^2 \alpha_i}{\displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^{config} \prod_{i=1}^{hype} \cos^2 \alpha_i}</math> where "hype" refers to the 3c4e bonds. This function ensures that the configurations where the 3c4e bonds are linear are favored. The energy terms are modified by multiplying them by a bond order factor, BOF, which is the product of the formal bond orders of the two bonds involved in the angle (for 3c4e bonds, the bond order is 0.5). For 3c4e bonds, the energy is calculated as :<math>E(\alpha) = BOF \times k_{\alpha} [1-\Delta(\alpha + \pi)^2]</math> where Δ is again the non-orthogonality function, but here the angle α is offset by 180 degrees (π radians). Finally, to ensure that the axial vs equatorial preference of different ligands in hypervalent compounds is reproduced, an "offset energy" term is subtracted. It has the form :<math>E_{offset} = \sum_{i=1}^{config} c_i \sum_{j=1}^{hype} \frac{EN_{ija} + EN_{ijb}}{2}</math> where the EN terms depend on the [[electronegativity]] difference between the ligand and the central atom as follows: :<math>EN_{ija} = 30 \times (en_{lig} - en_{c.a.}) \times ss</math> where ''ss'' is 1 if the electronegativity difference is positive and 2 if it is negative. For p-block hypervalent molecules, d orbitals are not used, so ''n'' = 0. The p contribution ''m'' is estimated from [[ab initio quantum chemistry methods]] and a natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis. ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Force fields]]</text> </page> <page> <id>39092</id> <title>VAXBI Bus</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}} {{Infobox Computer Hardware Bus | name = VAXBI bus | fullname = VAX Bus Interconnect bus | image = | caption = | invent-date = ~1986 | invent-name = [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] | super-name = | super-date = | width = 32 | numdev = | speed = | style = | hotplug = | external = }} [[Image:DEC-VAX-T1019-ECC-memory.jpg|thumb|200px|VAX [[Error-correcting code|ECC]] memory card with VAXBI interface highlighted.]] The '''VAXBI bus''' (VAX Bus Interconnect bus) was a [[computer]] bus designed and sold by the [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) of [[Maynard, Massachusetts]]. [[Image:DEC-VAX-T1010-adapter.jpg|thumb|200px|VAX BI to [[Unibus]] adapter.]] The bus was an advanced, configuration-free synchronous bus used on DEC's later [[VAX]] computers. Like the [[Unibus]] and [[Q-Bus]] before it, it used [[memory-mapped I/O]] but had 32-bit address and data paths. The VAXBI was a multiplexed bus with fully-distributed arbitration and geographic addressing. All of the logic required to implement a VAXBI interface was contained within a single custom integrated circuit (the "BIIC") and the physical layout and [[printed wiring board]] layup for compliant cards was tightly specified, right down to the location of the dual amber status [[LED]]s that were required. The portion of the card that was reserved for the bus interface was referred to as "the VAXBI corner". VAXBI licensees <!-- were there ever any? --> were given the appropriate engineering drawings to allow them to exactly replicate a compliant card. VAXBI cards mounted into backplanes using a [[Zero insertion force|ZIF]] connector; depending on the backplane design, cards could be loaded from the top or the front side of the backplane. No cable connections were permitted on the cards; all connections were made via three uncommitted rows of backplane connectors. Similarly, no configuration jumpers were permitted on the cards; all setup was done by jumpers inserted on the backplane connectors or via software configuration. Originally conceived by its engineers to be an [[Open standards|open]] bus, it was forced to be a tightly-licensed bus by Digital's marketing and management, and was not nearly as successful as had originally been hoped-for. It was used in the [[VAX 6000]], [[VAX 8000]] (82xx, 83xx, 85xx, 87xx, 88xx models) and the [[VAX 9000]] systems. A [[PDP-11]] implementation (the PDP-11/27) was also envisioned but never advanced beyond the concept stage. {{DEFAULTSORT:Vaxbi Bus}} [[Category:Computer buses]] [[Category:DEC hardware]] [[Category:Minicomputers]] {{mini-compu-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>39104</id> <title>VDPAU</title> <text>{{Infobox software | name = VDPAU | logo = <!-- [[File: ]] --> | screenshot = <!-- [[File: ]] --> | caption = | collapsible = | author = [[NVIDIA]] | developer = | released = <!-- {{start date|YYYY|MM|DD}} --> | discontinued = | latest release version = 0.4<ref>http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg-announce/2010-January/001245.html</ref> | latest release date = {{start date and age|2010|01|28}} | latest preview version = | latest preview date = <!-- {{start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD}} --> | frequently updated = | programming language = | operating system = [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] | platform = | size = | language = | status = | genre = [[Library (computing)|Library]] | license = | website = http://http.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/vdpau/doxygen/html/ }} '''VDPAU''' ('''Video Decode and Presentation
