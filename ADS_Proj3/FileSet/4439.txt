Greece have possessed more than the most rudimentary science. The bulk of scientific knowledge is a product of Europe in the last four centuries. No other place and time has supported the very special communities from which scientific productivity comes.|Kuhn|1962, pp. 167-168}} Bala argues that it is precisely Kuhn’s postmodern epistemological paradigm that obstructs recognition of non-Western influences on modern science. Bala argues that this leads Kuhn to treat different cultural scientific traditions as separate intellectual universes isolated from each other. Instead, Bala argues, we would have a different multicultural picture of science by including the contributions from Arabic, Chinese, [[ancient Egypt]]ian and [[History of Indian science and technology|Indian traditions]] of [[Eastern philosophy|philosophy]], mathematics, astronomy and physics that went into shaping the birth of modern science. == See also == * [[American philosophy]] * [[Epistemological rupture]] * [[Exemplar]] * [[Groupthink]] * [[Night Thoughts of a Classical Physicist]] by [[Russell McCormmach]] - a novel by a historian of science which reinforces's Kuhn's position == Notes == {{reflist|colwidth=35em}} ==References== *[http://www.des.emory.edu/mfp/kuhnobit.html "Thomas Kuhn, 73; Devised Science Paradigm"] , obituary by Lawrence Van Gelder, ''New York Times'', 19 June 1996 == External links == * [http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=ddmkz59v_657rh75 Rhetorical Analysis of chapter 3 by Josh Thomas] * [http://www.emory.edu/EDUCATION/mfp/kuhnsyn.html Summary of book by Frank Pajares] * [http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/kuhn.htm Text of chapter 9 and a postscript] at Marxists.org {{DEFAULTSORT:Structure}} [[Category:1962 books]] [[Category:Philosophy of science literature]] [[Category:History of science books]] [[Category:Books about revolutions]] [[Category:Cognitive science literature]] [[Category:Books by Thomas Kuhn]] [[Category:Science studies]] [[Category:Scientific revolution]] [[Category:Books published by the University of Chicago Press]] [[bg:Структурата на научните революции]] [[ca:L'estructura de les revolucions científiques]] [[de:The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]] [[es:La estructura de las revoluciones científicas]] [[fr:La Structure des révolutions scientifiques]] [[it:La struttura delle rivoluzioni scientifiche]] [[he:המבנה של מהפכות מדעיות]] [[ms:The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]] [[ja:科学革命の構造]] [[pt:Estrutura das Revoluções Científicas]] [[ru:Структура научных революций]] [[tr:Bilimsel Devrimlerin Yapısı]] [[zh:科学革命的结构]]</text> </page> <page> <id>37515</id> <title>The Velvet Underground (book)</title> <text>'''''The Velvet Underground''''' is a paperback by journalist Michael Leigh that reports on sexual [[paraphilia]] in the USA, published in September, 1963. Cover text: ''Here is an incredible book. It will shock and amaze you. But as a documentary on the sexual corruption of our age, it is a '''must''' for every thinking adult.'' Leigh investigates aberrant sexual practices between consenting adults, that is, everything other than simple intercourse conducted in privacy by a heterosexual couple, e.g., husband and wife swapping, group sex, sex orgy parties, homosexual activities, sado-masochism. The author reports on the various ways in which such practices are solicited (newspaper advertisements, clubs, etcetera), and by following these leads, manages to get into touch with many of its participants, usually through written correspondence. The book liberally treats us with quotations from this material. This is complemented with quotes from various magazines. The author's general aim is to establish that a shift in attitude toward sexuality is taking place in society that not only allows a large cross-section of the American population to partake in such non-standard sexual practices, but also allows them to believe that what they are doing is perfectly healthy and normal. A central passage in the book is a quote/paraphrase from a 1961 article in the French ''[[Esprit (magazine)|Esprit]]'' magazine, which calls this liberal attitude toward sex the [[sexual revolution]], and attributes it to the general availability of [[contraceptive]]s. The book is ambiguous in tone, posing as an objective investigative report on a social phenomenon, but at the same time, full of condemning language on the practices and attitudes observed. ''The Velvet Underground'' was republished in 1967 in the United Kingdom under the title '''''Bizarre Sex Underground'''''. In 1968, the author brought out a sequel, ''The Velvet Underground Revisited''. The New York band [[The Velvet Underground]], founded in 1965, was named after the book. [[Lou Reed]] and [[Sterling Morrison]]'s friend, filmmaker [[Tony Conrad]], found a copy lying in the street. Morrison has reported the group liked the name, considering it evocative of "underground cinema," and fitting, due to Reed's already having written "[[Venus in Furs (song)|Venus in Furs]]", inspired by [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]]'s [[Venus in Furs|book of the same name]], dealing with sadomasochism. == References == * Michael Leigh.

E. van Vogt]]. It was originally published as a three-part serial in [[Astounding Stories]]. It incorporates concepts from the [[General Semantics]] of [[Alfred Korzybski]] and refers to [[non-Aristotelian logic]]. ==Plot summary== Gilbert Gosseyn, a man living in an apparent utopia where those with superior understanding and mental control rule the rest of humanity, wants to be tested by the giant Machine that determines such superiority. However, he finds that his memories are false. In his search for his real identity, he discovers that he has extra bodies that are activated when he dies (so that, in a sense, he cannot be killed), that a galactic society of humans exists outside the Solar system, a large interstellar empire wishes to conquer both the Earth and Venus (inhabited by masters of [[non-Aristotelian logic]]), and he has extra brain matter
