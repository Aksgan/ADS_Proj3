and was expanded, reflecting the arrival in the mainstream of the 'citizen journalist'. After the [[2005 Hertfordshire Oil Storage Terminal fire|Buncefield disaster]] the BBC received over 5,000 photos from viewers. The BBC does not normally pay for content generated by its viewers. In [[2006]] [[CNN]] launched [[CNN iReport]], a project designed to bring user generated news content to CNN. Its rival [[Fox News Channel]] launched its project to bring in user-generated news, similarly titled "uReport". This was typical of major television news organisations in 2005-2006, who realised, particularly in the wake of the 7th July bombings, that [[citizen journalism]] could now become a significant part of broadcast news. [[Sky News]], for example, regularly solicits for photographs and video from its viewers. User generated content was featured in ''Time'' magazine's 2006 [[Person of the Year]], in which the person of the year was "you", meaning all of the people who contribute to user generated media such as YouTube and Wikipedia. ==Motivation and incentives== While the benefit derived from user generated content for the content host is clear, the benefit to the contributor is less direct. There are various theories behind the motivation for contributing user generated content, ranging from altruistic, to social, to materialistic. Due to the high value of user generated content, many sites use incentives to encourage their generation. These incentives can be generally categorized into implicit incentives and explicit incentives.<ref name="TouunaGroup">Toluna:{{cite web |url=http://www.toluna-group.com/files/en/Whitepapers/Web%20Incentives%20Whitepaper.pdf|title=Mixing Financial, Social and Fun Incentives for Social Voting|accessdate=Mar 3 2010}}</ref> # '''Implicit incentives:''' These incentives are not based on anything tangible. The most common form of implicit incentives is social incentives. These incentives allow the user to feel good as an active member of the community. These can include relationship between users, such as [[Facebook]]’s friends, or [[Twitter]]’s followers. Another common social incentive are status, badges or levels within the site, something a user earns when they reach a certain level of participation which may or may not come with additional privileges. [[Yahoo! Answers]] is an example of this type of social incentive. Social incentives cost the host site very little and can catalyze vital growth; however, their very nature requires a sizable existing community before it can function. # '''Explicit incentives:''' These incentives refer to tangible rewards. Examples include financial payment, entry into a contest, a voucher, a coupon, or frequent traveler miles. Direct explicit incentives are easily understandable by most and have immediate value regardless of the community size; sites such as the Canadian shopping platform [[Wishabi]] and [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] both use this type of financial incentive in slightly different ways to encourage user participation. The drawback to explicit incentives is that they may cause the user to be subject to the overjustification effect, eventually believing the only reason for the participating is for the explicit incentive. This reduces the influence of the other form of social or altruistic motivation, making it increasingly costly for the content host to retain long-term contributors.<ref name="wisdump">wisdump:{{cite web |url=http://www.wisdump.com/web/the-overjustification-effect-and-user-generated-content/|title=The Overjustification Effect and User Generated Content|accessdate=Mar 3 2010}}</ref> ==Different types of user generated content== * [[Discussion board]]s * [[Blogs]] * [[Wiki]]s * [[Social networking site]]s * [[Advertising]] * [[Fanfiction]] * News Sites * Trip planners * Memories * Mobile Photos & Videos * Customer [[review site]]s * Experience or photo sharing sites * Any other website that offers the opportunity for the user to share their knowledge and familiarity with a product or experience * Audio * Video games * Maps and location systems ==Notable websites based on user generated content== {| | *[[Associated Content]] *[[Atom.com]] *[[Articlesbook.com]] *[[BatchBuzz.com]] (India) *[[BoardGameGeek]] *[[Brickfish]] *[[CafePress]] *[[CreateDebate]] *[[Dailymotion]] *[[DeviantArt]] *[[Demotix]] *[[Digg]] *[[eBay]] *[[Eventful]] *[[Fark]] | *[[Epinions]] *[[Fmycampus]] *[[Facebook]] *[[Filemobile]] *[[Fireviews]] *[[Flickr]] *[[Flipter]] *[[Forelinksters]] *[[Friends Reunited]] *[[GasBuddy.com]] *[[GenJuice]] *[[GiantBomb]] *[[Goodreads]] *[http://www.havenvideo.com Havenvideo.com] *[[Helium.com]] *[[HubPages]] *[[InfoBarrel]] *[[iStockphoto]] | *[[Justin.tv]] *[[Jaycut|JayCut]] *[[Mahalo]] *[[MaYoMo]] *[[Metacafe]] *[[Mouthshut.com]] *[[MySpace]] *[[Nairaland.com]] *[[NeedInstructions.com]] *[[Newgrounds]] *[[Orkut]] *[[OpenStreetMap]] *[[Picasa]] *[[Photobucket]] *[[PhoneZoo]] | *[[Reddit]] *[[Revver]] *[[RINF]] *[[Scribd]] *[[Second Life]] *[[Shutterstock]] *[[Shvoong]] *[[Skyrock]] *[http://www.stockfuel.com StockFuel] *[[Squidoo]] *[[TripAdvisor]] *[[The Politicus]] | *[[TypePad]] *[[Twitter]] *[[Unseen (Unseen.tv)|Unseen.tv]] *[[Urban Dictionary]] *[[Veoh]] *[[Vimeo]] *[[Widgetbox]] *[[Wigix]] *[[Wikia]] *[[WikiMapia]] *[[Wikinvest]] | *[[Wikipedia]] *[[Wix.com]] *[[WordPress]] *[[Yelp, Inc.|Yelp]] *[[YouTube]] *[[YoYoGames]] *[[Zazzle]] *[[44eu.com]] *[[Zooppa]] |} ==New business models== The media companies of today are starting to realize that the users themselves can create plenty of material that is interesting to a broader audience and adjust their business models accordingly. Many young companies in the media industry, such as YouTube and Facebook, have foreseen the increasing demand of UGC, whereas the established, traditional media companies have taken longer to exploit these kinds of opportunities. Realizing the demand for UGC is more about creating a “playing field” for the visitors rather than creating material for them to consume. A parallel development can be seen in the video game industry, where games such as World of Warcraft, The Sims and Second Life give the player a large amount of freedom so that essential parts of the games are actually built by the players themselves. ==Player generated content== '''Player generated content''' is the concept of [[video game]] content being created by the players of the game, as opposed to being created by a game's publisher or author. Player generated content is common in tabletop [[role playing games]] where a game master creates a narrative or adventure for the other players to encounter. Interfaces for player generated content has been attempted in various [[PC games]] such as ''[[Neverwinter Nights]]'' and ''[[Counterstrike]]'' with some success, though the editors to create usable levels are often difficult for the average user. [[LittleBigPlanet]] provided one of the biggest breakthroughs by delivering level design tools as a focal feature of the game that were fast and approachable. With content shared amongst the community in a centralized resource, a large amount of creations were designed and shared by players seamlessly within the game itself. A streamlined communication system further encouraged content creation by making distribution and playing with friends easy. So integrated was the experience that players could use custom shared objects in their own levels or even design levels collaboratively with up to
