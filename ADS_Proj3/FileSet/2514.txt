heuristic estimate is very reliable in practice. ==An example== The following example is from {{harvtxt|Trappe|Washington|2006}}, with some details added. This book contains a nice introduction into the cryptographic uses of elliptic curves. We want to factor ''n''=455839. Let's choose the elliptic curve ''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> + 5''x'' - 5, with the point ''P''=(1,1) on it, and let's try to compute (10!)''P''. First we compute 2''P''. The slope of the tangent line at ''P'' is ''s''=(3''x''<sup>2</sup>+5)/(2''y'')=4, and then the coordinates of 2''P''=(''x′'',''y′'') are ''x′''=''s''<sup>2</sup>-2''x''=14 and ''y′''=''s''(''x''-''x′'')-''y''=4(1-14)-1=-53, all numbers understood (mod ''n''). Just to check that this 2''P'' is indeed on the curve: (-53)<sup>2</sup>=2809=14<sup>3</sup>+5·14-5. Then we compute 3(2P). The slope of the tangent line at 2''P'' is ''s''=(3·14<sup>2</sup>+5)/(2(-53))=-593/106 (mod ''n''). Using the [[Euclidean algorithm]]: 455839=4300·106+39, then 106=2·39+28, then 39=28+11, then 28=2·11+6, then 11=6+5, then 6=5+1. Hence gcd(455839,106)=1, and working backwards (a version of the [[extended Euclidean algorithm]]): 1=6-5=2·6-11=2·28-5·11=7·28-5·39=7·106-19·39=81707·106-19·455839. Hence 106<sup>-1</sup>=81707 (mod 455839), and -593/106=133317 (mod 455839). Given this ''s'', we can compute the coordinates of 2(2''P''), just as we did above: 4''P''=(259851,116255). Just to check that this is indeed a point on the curve: ''y''<sup>2</sup>=54514=''x''<sup>3</sup>+5''x''-5 (mod 455839). After this, we can compute <math>3(2 P)=4 P \boxplus 2 P</math>. We can similarly compute 4!''P'', and so on, but 8!''P'' requires inverting 599 (mod 455839). The Euclidean algorithm gives that 455839 is divisible by 599, and we have found a factorization 455839=599·761. The reason that this worked is that the curve (mod 599) has 640=2<sup>7</sup>·5 points, while (mod 761) it has 777=3·7·37 points. Moreover, 640 and 777 are the smallest positive integers ''k'' such that <math>kP=\infty</math> on the curve (mod 599) and (mod 761), respectively. Since 8! is a multiple of 640 but not a multiple of 777, we have <math>8!P=\infty</math> on the curve (mod 599), but not on the curve (mod 761), hence the repeated addition broke down here, yielding the factorization. ==See also== *[[UBASIC]] for practical program (ECMX). ==References== {{reflist}} * Brent, Richard P.
