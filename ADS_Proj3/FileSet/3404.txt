Packet Assembly, Packet Editing, Packet Play and Packet Decoding.<ref name=zereneh /><ref name=poor /> ==Packet Assembly== Packet Assembly is the creation of the packets to be sent. Some popular programs used for packet assembly are [[Hping]], [[Nemesis (software)|Nemesis]], [http://ostinato.googlecode.com/ Ostinato], [[Scapy]] and [[Yersinia (computing)|Yersinia]].<ref name=sectools>{{cite web | url = http://sectools.org/packet-crafters.html | title= Top 4 Packet Crafting Tools | publisher = SecTools.org | accessdate = 2010-08-01}}</ref><ref name=poor /><ref name=zereneh />Packets may be of any [[Communications protocol|protocol]] and are designed to test specific rules or situations. For example, a [[TCP packet]] may be created with a set of erroneous flags to ensure that the target machine sends a RESET command or that the firewall blocks any response.<ref name=zereneh /><ref name=poor /> ==Packet Editing== Packet Editing is the modification of created or captured packets. This involves modifying packets in manners which are difficult or impossible to do in the Packet Assembly stage, such as modifying the payload of a packet.<ref name=poor /> Programs such as [[Netdude]] allow a user to modify recorded packets' fields, checksums and payloads quite easily.<ref name=zereneh /> These modified packets can be saved in packet streams which may be stored in [[pcap]] files to be replayed later. ==Packet Play== Packet Play or Packet Replay is the act of sending a pre-generated or captured series of packets. Packets may come from Packet Assembly and Editing or from caputed network attacks. This allows for testing of a given usage or attack scenario for the targeted network. [[Tcpreplay]] is the most common program for this task since it is capable of taking a stored packet stream in the [[pcap]] format and sending those packets at the original rate or a user-defined rate. Some packet analyzers are also capable of packet replay. ==Packet Decoding== Packet Decoding is the [[Packet capture|capture]] and analysis of the network traffic generated during Packet Play. In order to determine the targeted network's response to the scenario created by Packet Play, the response must be captured by a [[packet analyzer]] and decoded according to the appropriate specifications. Depending on the packets sent, a desired response may be no packets were returned or that a connection was successfully established, among others. ==References== <references /> == See also == *[[Comparison of packet analyzers]] *[[Packetsquare]] ==External links== *Packet Crafting for Firewall & IDS Audits (Part 1 of 2) by Don Parker [http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1787] *Wikiformat article detailing [http://www.wikistc.org/wiki/Packet_crafting Packet crafting] [[Category:Network analyzers]] {{compu-network-stub}} [[ru:Конструктор пакетов]]</text> </page> <page> <id>28266</id> <title>Packet delay variation</title> <text>In [[computer networking]], '''packet delay variation''' ('''PDV''') is the difference in end-to-end delay between selected packets in a [[Flow (computer networking)|flow]] with any lost packets being ignored (RFC 3393).<ref>{{Cite paper | author=Demichelis, C.; Chimento, P. | title=IP Packet Delay Variation Metric for IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) | publisher=The Internet Society | date=November, 2002 | version= | url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3393.txt}}</ref> The effect is sometimes, incorrectly, referred to as [[jitter]]. The means of packet selection for measurement is not specified in RFC 3393, but could, for example, be the packets which had the largest variation in delay in a selected time period. The delay is specified from the start of the packet being transmitted at the source to the end of the packet being received at the destination. A component of the delay which does not vary from packet to packet can be ignored, hence if the packet sizes are the same and packets always take the same time to be processed at the destination then the packet arrival time at the destination could be used instead of the time the end of the packet is received. The term PDV is defined in ITU-T Recommendation Y.1540, [http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-Y.1540-200711-I/en Internet protocol data communication service - IP packet transfer and availability performance parameters], section 6.2. In [[computer networking]], although not in [[electronics]], usage of the term [[jitter]] may cause confusion. From RFC 3393 (section 1.1): <blockquote> The variation in packet delay is sometimes called "jitter". This term, however, causes confusion because it is used in different ways by different groups of people. ... In this document we will avoid the term "jitter" whenever possible and stick to delay variation which is more precise. </blockquote> ''Instantaneous packet delay variation'' is the difference between successive packets--here RFC 3393 does specify the selection criteria--and this is usually what is loosely termed "jitter", although jitter is also sometimes the term used for the [[variance]] of the packet delay. As an example, say packets are transmitted every 20 ms. If the 2nd packet is received 30 ms after the 1st packet, IPDV = −10 ms. This is referred to as ''dispersion''. If the 2nd packet is received 10 ms after the 1st packet, IPDV = +10 ms. This is referred to as ''clumping''. In [[multimedia]] streams, PDV can be removed by the choice of a properly sized play-out buffer at the receiver, which only causes a possibly humanly detectable delay before the start of media playback. For interactive real-time applications, however, e.g., [[VoIP]], PDV can be a serious issue and hence VoIP transmissions need [[Quality of Service]]-enabled networks to provide a high-quality channel. ==See also== *[[Jitter]] ==References== {{reflist}} {{compu-network-stub}} [[Category:Network architecture]]</text> </page> <page> <id>28267</id> <title>Packet drop attack</title> <text>In [[computer networking]], a '''packet drop attack''' or '''blackhole attack''' is a type of [[denial-of-service attack]] accomplished by dropping [[packet (information technology)|packet]]s. The attack can be accomplished either selectively (e.g. by dropping packets for a particular network destination, a packet every ''n'' packets or every ''t'' seconds, or a randomly selected portion of the packets, which is called "Gray hole attack") or in bulk (by dropping all packets). ==See also== *[[Black hole (networking)]] ==References== *Raffo, Daniele [http://perso.crans.org/~raffo/papers/phdthesis/thesisch3.html#x10-390003.1.2 Security Schemes for the OLSR Protocol for Ad Hoc Networks], Chapter 3, 3.1.2 Incorrect traffic relaying. {{compu-network-stub}} [[Category:Packets (information technology)]] [[Category:Routing]] [[Category:Denial-of-service attacks]] [[he:שמיטת חבילות מידע]] [[zh:黑洞攻擊]]</text> </page> <page> <id>28276</id> <title>Pad abort test</title> <text>A '''pad abort test''' is a test of a [[launch escape system]] to determine how well the system could get the crew of a [[spacecraft]] to safety in an emergency on the [[launch pad]].
