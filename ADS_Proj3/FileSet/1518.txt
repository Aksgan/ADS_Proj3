Thompson and Chase concluded that the limitations of star and number based movie rating systems failed to produce accurate "Best Movie of All Time" lists. Flickchart was designed to remedy the issue by forcing users to decide between two random movies repeatedly until an accurate list is created, rather than rating each movie individually.<ref name="aintitcool">{{Cite web | last = Smith | first = Jeremy | publisher = [[Ain't It Cool News]] | title = Mr. Beaks Comes Clean About His Flickchart Addiction!
