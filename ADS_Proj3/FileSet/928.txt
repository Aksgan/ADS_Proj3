It utilizes a [[wikt:proprietary|proprietary]] [[40-bit encryption|40-bit]] [[stream cipher]] algorithm. The system was introduced around 1996 and has subsequently been compromised. The CSS [[Key (cryptography)|key]] sets are licensed by the [[DVD Copy Control Association]] to manufacturers who incorporate them into products such as DVD movie releases, [[DVD drive|drives]], and players. Most [[DVD player]]s are equipped with a '''CSS [[Decrypt]]ion module'''. '''CSS key''' is a collective term for authentication key, disc keys, player keys, title keys, secured disk key set, and/or encrypted title keys. The keys are stored on the lead-in area of the disk, which is generally only read by compliant drives. Keys can be passed from a DVD drive to a descrambler over a PC bus using a secure [[handshaking|handshake]] protocol.<ref name=ieee-copyproc>[http://www.dvd-copy.com/reference/IEEE-doc-copyproc.pdf IEEE - Copy Protection for DVD Video p.2]</ref> The purpose of CSS is twofold. First, it prevents byte-for-byte copies of an [[MPEG]] (digital video) stream from being playable since such copies will not include the keys that are hidden on the lead-in area of the restricted DVD disk. Second, it provides a reason for manufacturers to make compliant devices, since CSS scrambled disks will not play on noncompliant devices. Anyone wishing to build compliant devices must obtain a license, which contains the requirement that the rest of the DRM system be implemented.<ref name=ieee-copyproc /> In October 1999, [[Jon Lech Johansen]] and two people who remained anonymous [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineered]] the algorithm and [[DeCSS]] was released. The CSS algorithm was soon revealed to be easily susceptible to a [[brute force attack]], apart from being an example of the [[trusted client]] problem. The algorithm's weakness is primarily due to [[Export of cryptography in the United States|United States government crypto-export regulations]], which, at the time, forbade the export of cryptosystems employing keys in excess of 40 bits - a key length that had already been proven to be wholly inadequate in the face of increasing computer processing power by the time DVD was released (see [[Data Encryption Standard]] (DES)). In addition, structural flaws in the algorithm reduced the effective key length to only around 16 bits, which could be brute-forced by a 450 MHz processor in less than a minute.<ref>{{cite paper |date=1999-11-08 |author=[[Frank A. Stevenson]] |title=Cryptanalysis of Contents Scrambling System |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20000302000206/www.dvd-copy.com/news/cryptanalysis_of_contents_scrambling_system.htm }} Archive.org</ref> As a 450 MHz processor was the stated minimum necessary to decompress a DVD-compliant MPEG-2 videostream in realtime, it effectively meant that any computer that could decode a DVD entirely in software could also crack one. The CSS algorithm has been superseded by the [[Cryptomeria cipher]] in newer DRM schemes such as [[Content Protection for Recordable Media]] (CPRM), or by [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES) in the [[Advanced Access Content System]] (AACS) DRM scheme used by [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]]. ==Specification== ;Authentication: a process for a [[DVD drive]] and CSS Decryption module to recognize (or authenticate) each other. It is necessary before reading data from DVDs. An Authentication [[Key (cryptography)|key]] is used for this process. ;Title keys: used for scrambling and descrambling actual data on [[DVD]]s called '''titles'''. A title could be a complete motion picture, a trailer or similar self-contained unit. ;Disc keys: used for decrypting '''title keys''' on DVDs. ;Player keys: used for decrypting '''disc keys''' on DVDs. Each DVD player manufacturer is allocated one of approximately 400 player keys to incorporate in its players. While most '''CSS decrypting software''' is used to play DVD films, other non-playing software (such as [[DVD Decrypter]], [[AnyDVD]], [[DVD43]], [[Smartripper]], and [[DVD Shrink]]) allows a region-specific DVD to be copied as an all-region DVD. Such software is also able to remove [[Macrovision]], Content Scrambling System (CSS), [[regional lockout|region codes]], and [[User operation prohibition|disabled user operations]] (UOP). ==See also== * [[Disc wobble]] * [[DVD Copy Control Association]] * [[Advanced Access Content System]] * [[AnyDVD]], [[DVD43]], [[DeCSS]], [[DVD Decrypter]], [[Smartripper]], and [[libdvdcss]] * [[Content Protection for Recordable Media|Content Protection for Prerecorded Media]] (CPPM) * [[Fair use]] * [[ARccOS|ARccOS: an additional form of DVD copy protection]] * [[libdvdcss]], a free software library for accessing CSS-encypted DVDs, thus enabling playback of such discs on opensource players. ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.dvdcca.org/css/ Content Scramble System (CSS)] (official website) *[http://www.tinyted.net/eddie/css.html The Content Scrambling System] *[http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~crypto/Projects/MarkBarry/index.htm Cryptography in Home Entertainment: A look at content scrambling in DVDs] [[Category:History of cryptography]] [[Category:Digital rights management]] [[Category:Optical disc copy protection]] [[Category:Broken stream ciphers]] [[Category:DVD]] [[ca:Content Scrambling System]] [[de:Content Scramble System]] [[es:Content Scrambling System]] [[fr:Content Scrambling System]] [[it:Content Scrambling System]] [[nl:Content Scramble System]] [[ja:Content Scramble System]] [[no:Content Scramble System]] [[pl:Content Scramble System]] [[pt:Content Scramble System]] [[ru:Content Scramble System]] [[simple:Content Scramble System]] [[fi:CSS (suojaus)]] [[sv:Content Scrambling System]]</text> </page> <page> <id>7940</id> <title>Content management</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=July 2007}} '''Content management''', or '''CM''', is the set of processes and technologies that support the collection, managing, and publishing of information in any form or medium. In recent times this information is typically referred to as [[Content (media and publishing)|content]] or, to be precise, digital content. Digital content may take the form of text, such as documents, multimedia files, such as audio or video files, or any other file type which follows a content lifecycle which requires management. ==The process of content management== Content management practices and goals vary with mission. News organizations, e-commerce websites, and educational institutions all use content management, but in different ways. This leads to differences in terminology and in the names and number of steps in the process. For example, an instance of digital content is created by one or more authors. Over time that content may be edited. One or more individuals may provide some editorial oversight thereby approving the content for publication. Publishing
