in a startup company called [[Entity Systems]] in [[Finland]] - were they were developing [[Common Lisp]] and [[Prolog]] development environments for the early generation of [[Personal computer|PC]]'s circa. 1986-88. Later, Orri Erling worked with [[VIA International]], the developer of [[VIA/DRE]] in designing a [[Lisp (programming language)|LISP]] based [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] [[data access]] layer atop the company's [[Database management system|DBMS]] product. The core development team of VIA, following the company's demise in 1992, went on to found [[Solid Technologies]] under the direction of [[Artturi Tarjanne]]. [[Heikki Tuuri]] worked at [[Solid Technologies|Solid]] for a while before starting his own [[database]] development project which became [[InnoDB]] (recently acquired by [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] in 2005). Orri Erling started his own DBMS development work in 1994, which was to become [[Kubl]]. Development of Kubl was initially financed by [[Infosto Group]], publisher of Finland's largest [[free ads paper]], as part of their in-house software development project for their [[Consumer-to-consumer|on-line services]]. The on-line version of ''[[Keltainen PÃ¶rssi]]'' was at one time said to be Finland's most popular web site with 500,000 registered users. The Kubl database was prominently displayed in a ''"Powered by Kubl"'' logo on the search results. A free trial version of Kubl was made available for download on November 7, 1996.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.linux.announce/browse_thread/thread/1f16aee3485e6ec4/584d1a35614d67e1#584d1a35614d67e1 |title=Kubl RDBMS Free Trial Downloading Now |date=7 November 1996 |accessdate=2010-02-03 }}</ref> Kubl was marketed as a high performance lightweight database for [[embedded software|embedded]] use; the development aim was to achieve top scores in [[Transactions Per Second]] tests.<ref>[http://sal.linet.gr.jp/H/1/KUBL.html]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://groups.google.com/group/comp.databases/browse_thread/thread/2460a5cf7b13e6b7/31b04e5457c76e66#31b04e5457c76e66 |title= DBMS Benchmark code?
