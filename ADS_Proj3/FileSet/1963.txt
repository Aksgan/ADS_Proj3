craftsman's livelihood. Drawings only survive from the later period. Parchment was too expensive to be commonly used and paper did not appear until the end of the period. Models were used for designing structures and could be built in large scales. Details were mostly designed al full size on tracing floors, some of which survive. ====Labour==== In general medieval buildings were built by paid workers. Unskilled work was done by labourers paid by the day. Skilled craftsmen served apprenticeships or learned their trade from their parents. It is not clear how many women were invomembers of the guild holding a monopoly on a particular trade in a defined area (usually within the town walls). Towns were in general very small by modern standards and dominated by the dwellings of a small number of rich nobles or merchants and cathedrals and churches. ====Techniques==== Romanesque buildings of the period 600-1100 AD were entirely roofed in timber or had stone barrel vaults covered by timber roofs. The Gothic style of architecture with its [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]], [[flying buttresses]] and pointed [[Lancet arch|gothic arch]]es developed in the twelfth century and in the centuries that followed ever more incredible feats of constructional daring were achieved in stone. The resulting thin stone vaults and towering buildings were constructed entirely using rules derived by trial and error. Failure were frequent, particularly in difficult areas such as crossing towers. The resulting buildings remain astounding tributes to their builders. The [[pile driver]] was invented around 1500. ====Outstanding technical Achievements==== While the scale of fortifications and castle building in the Middle Ages was impressive, no buildings in this period can match the daring of the gothic cathedrals with their thin masonry vaults, and walls of glass. Outstanding examples are: [[Beauvais Cathedral]], [[Chartres Cathedral]], [[King's College Chapel]] and [[Notre Dame, Paris]]. ===Construction in the Renaissance=== {{See|Renaissance Architecture}} [[Image:Cupola di santa maria del fiore dal campanile di giotto, 02.JPG|thumb|right|'''The Dome of [[Santa Maria del Fiore]] ''', designed by [[Filippo Brunelleschi]].]] The [[Renaissance]] in Italy, the invention of [[moveable type]] and the [[Reformation]] changed the character of building. The rediscovery of Vitruvius had a strong influence. During the Middle Ages buildings were designed by the people that built them. The master mason and master carpenters learnt their trades by word of mouth and relied on experience, models and rules of thumb to determine the sizes of building elements. Vitruvius however describes in detail the education of the perfect architect who he said must be skilled in all the arts and sciences.[[Filippo Brunelleschi]] was one of the first of the new style of architects. He started life as a goldsmith and educated himself in Roman architecture by studying ruins. He went on to engineer the dome of [[Santa Maria del Fiore]] in Florence. ====Materials==== The major breakthroughs in this period were to do with the technology of conversion. Water mills in most of Western Europe were used to saw timber and convert trees into planks. Bricks were used in ever increasing quantities. In Italy the brickmakers were organised into guilds although the kilns were mostly in rural areas because of the risk of fire and easy availability of firewood and brickearth. Brickmakers typically paid by the brick which gave them an incentive to make them too small. As a result legislation was laid down regulating the minimum sizes and each town kept measures against which bricks had to be compared. An increasing amount of ironwork was used in roof carpentry for straps and tension members. The iron was fixed using forelock bolts. The screw-threaded bolt (and nut) could be made and are found in clockmaking in this period, but they were labour intensive and thus not used on large structures. Roofing was typically terracotta roof tiles. In Italy they followed Roman precedents. In Northern Europe plain tiles were used. Stone remained the material of choice where available for prestige buildings. ====Design==== The rebirth of the idea of an architect in the renaissance radically changed the nature of building design. Indeed Medieval buildings were conceived in totally different terms. The Renaissance reintroduced the classical style of architecture. Leon Battista Alberti's treatise on architecture raised the subject to a new level, defining architecture as something worthy of study by the aristocracy. Previously it was viewed merely as a technical art, suited only to the artisan. The resulting change in status of architecture and more importantly the architect is key to understanding the changes in the process of design. The Renaissance architect was often an artist (a painter or sculptor) who had little knowledge of building technology but a keen grasp of the rules of classical design. The architect thus had to provide detailed drawings for the craftsmen setting out the disposition of the various parts. This was what we call the process of design, from the Italian word for drawing. Occasionally the architect would get involved in particularly difficult technical problems but the technical side of architecture was mainly left up to the craftsmen. This change in the way buildings were designed had a fundamental difference on the way problems were approached. Where the Medieval craftsmen tended to approach a problem with a technical solution in mind, the Renaissance architect started with an idea of the what the end product need to look like and then searched around for a way of making it work. This led to extraordinary leaps forward in engineering. ====Labour==== [[Image:Brunelleshi-and-Duomo-of-Florence.gif|thumb|right|'''The structure of the dome of Florence cathedral ''', showing the double skin structure.]] Labour in the Renaissance was much he same as that in the Middle Ages: buildings were built by paid workers. Unskilled work was done by labourers paid by the day. Skilled craftsmen served apprenticeships or learned their trade from their parents. Craftsmen were organized in [[guild]]s which provided a limited form of building regulation in return for members of the guild holding a monopoly on a particular trade in a defined area (usually within the town walls). Towns were in general very small by modern standards and dominated by
