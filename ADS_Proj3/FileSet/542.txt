Bugs in 1995's ''[[Carrotblanca]]'', a well-received 8-minute ''Looney Tunes'' cartoon originally shown in cinemas alongside ''[[The Amazing Panda Adventure]]'' (US) and ''[[The Pebble and the Penguin]]'' (non-US); it has since been released on video packaged with older ''Looney Tunes'' cartoons and was even included in the special edition [[DVD]] release of ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', of which it is both a [[parody]] and an [[homage]]. Burson next voiced Bugs in the 1996 short ''[[From Hare to Eternity]]''; the film is notable for being dedicated to the memory of the then-just deceased [[Friz Freleng]], and for being the final ''Looney Tunes'' cartoon that [[Chuck Jones]] directed. Greg Burson also provided Bugs' voice in ''[[The Bugs and Daffy Show]]'', which ran on [[Cartoon Network]] from 1996 to 2003. He died in 2008. ;[[Billy West]] :Billy West has been in television since the late 1980s. His first role was for the 1988 revived version of [[Bob Clampett]]'s ''[[Beany and Cecil]]''. West's breakthrough role then came almost immediately, as the voice of Stimpy and later Ren in [[John Kricfalusi]]'s ''[[Ren & Stimpy]]''. West has since been the voice talent for close to 120 different characters, including some of the most iconic animated figures in television history. Perhaps West's most notable film work came in the 1996 movie ''[[Space Jam]]''. Starring alongside [[Michael Jordan]], West provided the voice of both Bugs Bunny and [[Elmer Fudd]]. West would go on to reprise the roles of Bugs in subsequent ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' productions, including his cameos on ''[[Histeria!]]'', the [[Kids' WB!]] promotional spots, and the 2006 [[Christmas]]-themed special ''[[Bah, Humduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas]]'' and the DVD compilations "Reality Check" and "Stranger Than Fiction", along with several ''Looney Tunes''-centric CDs, cartoons, and video games. Billy West is, along with fellow [[voice artist]] [[Joe Alaskey]], credited as one of the current successors of Mel Blanc in impersonating the voice of Bugs Bunny. ;[[Joe Alaskey]] :Joe Alaskey, like [[Jeff Bergman]], is well-known for his ability to successfully impersonate many ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' characters. In fact, Alaskey voiced [[Yosemite Sam]] in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', as original voice actor Mel Blanc had found it too hard on his vocal cords. (This makes Sam one of the few voices created by Blanc to be voiced by someone else during his lifetime.) Joe Alaskey's first performance as Bugs Bunny came in the 2003 feature film ''Looney Tunes: Back in Action'', although he had tested performing the role in a few earlier projects, such as ''[[Tweety's High-Flying Adventure]]''. While still best known for providing the voice of [[Daffy Duck]], Alaskey has also gone on to do Bugs' voice in several subsequent productions, including ''[[Daffy Duck for President]]'' (which was released on ''The [[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 2]]'' and dedicated to then-just deceased Chuck Jones) and several recent video games and Looney Tunes cartoons, including ''[[Hare and Loathing in Las Vegas]]''. Joe Alaskey is, along with fellow voice actor Billy West, credited as one of the current successors of Mel Blanc in impersonating the voice of Bugs Bunny. ;[[Samuel Vincent]] :Samuel Vincent served as the voice of Bugs in the [[Cartoon Network]] TV series ''[[Baby Looney Tunes]]''. ;[[Noel Blanc]] :Noel Blanc, Mel Blanc's son, voiced Bugs for the ''Tiny Toons'' special ''[[It's a Wonderful Tiny Toon Christmas Special]]''. The elder Blanc claimed in his later years that Noel substituted for Mel in various cartoon studios, including doing Bugs at Warner Bros., while he was recovering from a near-fatal car wreck. Noel can also be seen doing Bugs' voice with his father in the documentary on the making of the film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. ==Cameos== Bugs Bunny has had cameo appearances in several cartoons, including two ''[[Private SNAFU]]'' shorts. *''[[Patient Porky]]'' (1940) *''[[Crazy Cruise]]'' (1942) *''[[Porky Pig's Feat]]'' (1943, Bugs's only appearance in a black-and-white Looney Tunes short) *''[[Jasper Goes Hunting]]'' (1944, for [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]])<ref name="Jasper">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/36556-Jasper_Goes_Hunting.html |title='&#39;Jasper Goes Hunting'&#39; information |publisher=Bcdb.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-20}}</ref> *''[[Odor-able Kitty]]'' (1945) *''[[The Goofy Gophers]]'' (1947, with a sped-up voice) *''[[The Lion's Busy]]'' (1950) *''[[Duck Amuck]]'' (1953) *''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]]'' (2008, voiced by Joe Alaskey, as one of the forms of [[Martian Manhunter|The Martian Manhunter]]) ==Current popularity== In 2002, ''[[TV Guide]]'' compiled a list of the 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time as part of the magazine's 50th anniversary.

The editor also explained why Bugs pulled top billing: "His stock...has never gone down...Bugs is the best example...of the smart-aleck American comic. He not only is a great cartoon character, he's a great comedian. He was written well. He was drawn beautifully. He has thrilled and made many generations laugh. He is tops."<ref>{{Cite news|work=CNN.com|title=CNN LIVE TODAY: 'TV Guide' Tipping Hat to Cartoon Characters|accessdate=April 11, 2007|date=July 31, 2002|publisher=CNN|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0207/31/lt.20.html}}</ref> Additionally, in ''[[Animal Planet]]'''s ''50 Greatest Movie Animals'' (2004), Bugs was named #3, behind [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Toto (dog)|Toto]]. Bugs Bunny's enduring effect on comedic actors also cannot be overestimated. During an interview for ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', [[comedian]] [[Dave Chappelle]] cited Bugs Bunny as one of his earliest influences, praising [[voice actor]] [[Mel Blanc]]. According to [[Time Warner]], Bugs Bunny became the current official [[mascot]] for [[Six Flags]] [[theme park]]s beginning with their 45th anniversary. ==Awards== ===Academy Awards=== *''[[Knighty Knight Bugs]]'' (1958) ===Academy Award nominations=== *''[[A Wild Hare]]'' (1940) *''[[Hiawatha's Rabbit Hunt]]'' (1941) ==See also== {{Portal|Biography}} *[[The Golden Age of American animation]] *[[List of Bugs Bunny cartoons]] *''[[Looney Tunes]]'' *[[List of Looney Tunes feature-length films]] ==References== {{Reflist|2}} ==Bibliography== *{{Cite book|last=Adamson|first=Joe|title=Bugs Bunny: 50 Years and Only One Grey Hare|location=New York |publisher=Henry Holt|year=1990|isbn=0-8050-1855-7}} *{{Cite book|last=Beck|first=Jerry|first2=Will|last2=Friedwald|title=Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies|location=New York|publisher=Henry Holt|year=1989|isbn=0-8050-0894-2|authorlink=Jerry Beck}} *{{Cite book|last=Blanc|first=Mel|first2=Philip|last2=Bashe|title=That's Not All, Folks!|location=Clayton South, VIC, Australia|publisher=Warner Books|year=1989|isbn=0-446-39089-5|authorlink=Mel Blanc}} *{{Cite book|last=Jones|first=Chuck|title=Chuck Amuck: The Life and Times of an Animated Cartoonist|location=New York|publisher=Farrar Straus & Giroux|isbn=0-374-12348-9|authorlink=Chuck Jones|year=1989}} *{{Cite book|last=Maltin|first=Leonard|title=Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated
