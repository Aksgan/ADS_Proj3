Google [[AdSense]] was added to the website. In July 2005, the site was updated to Version 2.0. The new version featured a friends list, the ability to "digg" a story without being redirected to a success page, and a new interface designed by web design company silverorange.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.silverorange.com/a/portfolio/digg |title=Digg |publisher=silverorange |date= |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref> The site developers have stated that in future versions a more minimalist design will likely be employed. On Monday June 26, 2006 version 3 of Digg was released with specific categories for Technology, Science, World & Business, Videos, Entertainment and Gaming as well as a View All section where all categories are merged. Digg has grown large enough that submissions sometimes create a sudden increase of traffic to the "dugg" website. This is referred to by some Digg users as the "[[Digg effect]]" and by some others as the site being "dugg to death." However, in many cases stories are linked simultaneously on several popular bookmarking sites. In such cases, the impact of the "digg effect" is difficult to isolate and assess. On August 27, 2007, Digg altered its main interface, mostly in the profile area. The domain "digg.com" attracted at least 236 million visitors annually by 2008 according to a [[Compete.com]] survey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://siteanalytics.compete.com/digg.com?metric=uv |title=Compete.com |publisher=Siteanalytics.compete.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref> Digg CEO Jay Adelson explained at the 2010 "Bigg Digg Shindigg," which is part of the South by Southwest Interactive Conference, that Digg is getting a major overhaul and redesign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2010/03/13/new-digg/ |title=New Version of Digg |publisher=Mashable |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref> In an interview with Wired magazine, Adelson explained that "Every single thing has changed" and that "the entire website has been rewritten."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/03/digg-redesign-social-web/ |title=Wired Interview |publisher=Wired |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref> Adelson explains that the new Digg will essentially eliminate the duplication problem. It will also help prevent so called 'power users' from dominating the site with their submissions. The new Digg will also offer users a personalized homepage, based on their diggs, that is tailored to their specific interests. The commenting system will be updated to "help fight bad behavior like trolling or group-burying." The entire look of the site will also change. Adelson summed up the new Digg by saying, “We’ve got a new backend, a new infrastructure layer, a new services layer, new machines — everything." John Quinn wrote in a Digg blog post that the company was going to stop using [[MySQL]] and begin using [[Apache Cassandra|Cassandra]], a distributed database system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://about.digg.com/blog/saying-yes-nosql-going-steady-cassandra/ |title=Cassandra Switch |publisher=Digg |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref> On April 5, 2010, Kevin Rose announced that he would be assuming the position of CEO as Jay Adelson had stepped down.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://about.digg.com/blog/update-jay |title=Update from Jay &#124; Digg About |publisher=About.digg.com |date=2010-04-04 |accessdate=2010-09-01}}</ref> Although, some time later he has disclosed that he is actively seeking a replacement CEO as the role takes up too much of his time that he would rather spend doing other things, such as angel investing. On August 25, 2010, Digg released v4. The site experienced a number of bugs and glitches that has resulted in a backlash from Digg users in the form of verbal opposition and, initially, heavy posting of articles from [[Reddit]] - a competitor of Digg's. Digg's business development director Matt Van Horn left Digg after the official update of version 4.<ref>{{cite news | first = Caroline | last = McCarthy | title = Digg's Matt Van Horn leaving for start-up Path | date = 2010-08-26 | url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-20014852-36.html | work = CNET News | accessdate = 2010-09-02}}</ref> On September 1, 2010, Matt Williams took over as CEO, ending Rose's troubled tenure as interim chief executive. ===Potential sale=== Several reports have come forward claiming Digg has been trying to sell itself to a larger company since early 2006.<ref>{{cite web |last=Arrington |first=Michael |url=http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/07/just-sell-digg-already-jay/ |title=Just Sell Digg Already, Jay |publisher=Techcrunch.com |date=2007-11-07 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref> While Adelson claims that Digg will meet with any potential buyers, he denies that they will actively begin talks for a sale. The most recent sale talks were with Google in July 2008 for approximately $200 million. On July 25, during the [[due diligence]] part of the potential sale, Google informed Digg that they were not interested in the purchase.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/26/AR2008072601421.html |title=Google Walks Away From Digg Deal |publisher=washingtonpost.com |accessdate=2009-02-27 | first=Michael | last=Arrington | date=2008-07-26}}</ref> As a result of [[Google]]'s decision, Digg entered into a third round of funding, receiving $28.7 million from [[investors]] such as [[Highland Capital Partners]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.
