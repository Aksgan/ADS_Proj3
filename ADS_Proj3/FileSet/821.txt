To help distinguish between all of these software packages, here is a short description of each one. ;[[Arusha Project]] (ARK) :Manage package and configuration specification of hosts via a custom XML description language. Can be used as a front end for [[Cfengine]] or [http://pikt.org/ PIKT]. Provides some collaboration features between administration 'teams'. The last commit dates from [http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=ark-commits April 2007]. ;[[Bcfg2]] :Software to manage the configuration of a large number of computers using a central configuration model and the [[client–server model|client–server paradigm]]. The system enables reconciliation between clients' state and the central configuration specification. Detailed reports provide a way to identify unmanaged configuration on hosts. Generators enable code or template based generation of configuration files from a central data repository. ;[[Cfengine]] :Lightweight agent system. Manages configuration of a large number of computers using the client–server paradigm or stand-alone. Any client state which is different from the policy description is reverted to the desired state. Configuration state is specified via a declarative language. Cfengine's paradigm is convergent [http://www.usenix.org/event/lisa98/full_papers/burgess/burgess.pdf "computer immunology"] ;[[Chef (software)|Chef]] :Chef is a configuration management tool written in Ruby, and uses a pure Ruby DSL for writing configuration "recipes". Chef can be used as a client–server tool, or used in "solo" mode. ;[http://www.cs.umb.edu/~rouilj/DACS/ DACS] :It is similar to other CCM (computer configuration management) tools such as bcfg2, lcfg, puppet and the well known cfengine. However, it has some unique features that makes it more than just a program which pushes files to other hosts. It integrates: a host database; a version control system; an optional file generation system; a file distribution and remote command execution mechanism. ;[http://etch.sourceforge.net/ Etch] :Etch uses a client-server or client-only model. Configuration is defined in XML, Ruby, and embedded Ruby (ERB) templates. A copy of the original file is provided to the user's configuration scripts, allowing easy idempotent edits to stock files. In client-server mode clients can submit requests to the server for special configuration, allowing clients to have limited control of their configuration while still ensuring centralized management. ;[http://www.fusioninventory.org/ FusionInventory] with [http://www.glpi-project.org GLPI] :FusionInventory is a solution for hardware & software inventory with agent or agentless using SNMP (like for computer inventory or switch inventory), Wake On Lan (WOL), Software deployment using OCS Inventory NG protocol and peer to peer download, Network connected devices (using Netbios, nmap and SNMP). It can be used with GLPI directly and other Asset solution (with lib server php intergation). ;[[ISconf]] :Tool to execute commands and replicate files on all nodes. The nodes do not need to be up; the commands will be executed when they boot. The system has no central server so commands can be launched from any node and they will replicate to all nodes. It implements many of the ideas in "[http://www.infrastructures.org/papers/turing/turing.html Why Order Matters: Turing Equivalence in Automated Systems Administration]". ;[[LCFG]] :LCFG manages the configuration with a central description language in XML, specifying resources, aspects and profiles. Configuration is deployed using the client–server paradigm. Appropriate scripts on clients (called "components") transcribe the resources into configuration files and restart services as needed. ;[http://www.ocsinventory-ng.org/index.php?page=French OCS Inventory NG] with [http://www.glpi-project.org GLPI] :OCS Inventory NG, when integrated with GLPI,
