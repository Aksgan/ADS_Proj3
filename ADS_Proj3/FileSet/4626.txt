be considered conclusive as they were not testing for the bounce with electronic stop finding devices. Nobody seems to be told about rods or offiziers or [[banburismus]] unless they are really going to do something about it. The American approach was, however, successful. The first two experimental bombes went into operation in May 1943, running in Dayton so they could be observed by their engineers. Designs for production models were completed in April, 1943, with initial operation starting in early June. All told, the laboratory constructed 121 bombes which were then employed for code-breaking in the US Navy's signals intelligence and cryptanalysis group [[OP-20-G]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].<ref name=Wilcox>{{Citation|last=Wilcox| first=Jennifer E|date=2001|title=About the Enigma|publisher=National Security Agency|url= http://www.nsa.gov/publications/publi00021.pdf|accessdate=13 October 2008}} </ref> Construction was accomplished in three shifts per day by some 600 [[WAVES]] (Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service), 100 Navy officers and enlisted men, and a large civilian workforce. Approximately 3,000 workers operated the bombes to produce "[[Ultra]]" decryptions of German Enigma traffic. According to a contemporary US Navy report (dated April 1944), the bombes were used on naval jobs until all daily keys had been run; then the machines were used for non-naval tasks. During the previous six months, about 45% of the bombe time had been devoted to non-naval problems carried out at the request of the British. British production and reliability problems with their own high-speed bombes had then recently led to construction of 50 additional Navy units for Army and Air Force keys. ==Building== The building in Dayton, called [[Building 26 (Dayton)]] was an Art Deco design of Dayton firm [[Schenck & Williams]]. It was owned by the University of Dayton in 2007, and they wanted to tear it down for a development. Residents protested. ==References== {{reflist}} ==Bibliography== * [http://www.daytoncodebreakers.org/docs/bombe_history.htm History of the Bombe Project (US Navy memo, April 1944)] * John A. N.

The card is used to control access to military bases, exclusive stores (such as [[AAFES]] and [[Base exchange|NEX]] outlets and [[Defense Commissary Agency|commissaries]]), Morale Welfare and Recreation (MWR) facilities, and high-security areas. It also serves as proof of eligibilty for medical care delivered either directly within the [[Military_Health_System|military health system]] or outside via [[TRICARE]]. The modern identification card is called a [[Common Access Card]] (CAC) because it is also a [[smart card]] that is used with specialized card readers for automatic building access control systems, communications encryption, and computer access. ==Types== The primary types of U.S. military ID cards being issued today are the CAC for active duty and Reserve members, the Department of Defense (DD) Form 2 for retirees, and DD Form 1173 for dependents. Until the CAC was phased in starting in late 2003, the DD Form 2 in branch-specific variants served as active duty members' ID. Prior to the October 1993 revision, the DD Form 2 form number was appended with one of five variant codes denoting branch of service (A, AF, N, MC, or CG), and the typewriter-filled blank form variants were overprinted with branch names and logos. Current DD Forms 2 and 1173 are identical for all branches; the [[Defense_Enrollment_and_Eligibility_Reporting_System|DEERS]] ID workstation prints branch-unique names and logos onto the blank form along with the holder's personal information at the time of issue. Current DD Forms 2 and 1173 variants differ only in the color in which the blank form is printed, indicating the holder's status. DD Forms 2 and 1173 are easily confused as they are similar in appearance and purpose, however they are two distinct forms. === Color Coding === The DD Form 2 and 1173 ID cards are color-coded to denote the status of the holder. Possible colors are: * '''Tan''' - Dependent of active duty member or retiree. * '''Red''' - Retired Reservist not yet age 60 (Gray Area) and Dependent of Reserve Components. * '''Blue''' - Retiree (or other honorably discharged Veteran with benefits). ==See also== * [[Identity documents in the United States]] [[Category:United States Department of Defense|Uniformed Services Privilege and Identification Card]] [[Category:Personal identification]]</text> </page> <page> <id>38883</id> <title>Units (software)</title> <text>'''Units''' is a [[cross-platform]] [[computer program]] for [[conversion of units]] of quantities.
