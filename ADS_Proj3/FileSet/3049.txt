basic kinds of self-plagiarism, when the similar (or identical) articles appear one by one (republishing) and simultaneously (multiple submission). ===Republishing of very similar works=== As a research-paper is an implicit claim of furthering knowledge, the researcher must state what exactly is the claim of novelty. This would let the editor rate the article in view of their policy. For example, all/most would reject a paper if already published in another journal, although may tolerate (as IEEE does) a re-edited [and expanded] conference paper. However, the line is blurred when [[safety]] issues are involved. For example, if an author publishes a study which shows that a particular product or design is faulty, then it is important that the information is spread as widely as possible. Such re-publication is justified in the [[public interest]]. ===Multiple submission to journals=== Multiple submission is not plagiarism, but it is considered as serious academic misbehavior. Even when a publication fee is paid, it nonetheless wastes the most important resource in academic publishing: the time and work of the referees and the editors, and contributes to the problem it is intended to solve, the slow speed of editorial review. And there is the unfortunate possibility that more than one journal will accept it. As there is no time for feedback from readers, the same errors appear in various journals. ===Defense of multiple submission=== Duplicate submission can be defended. The slowness of academic editing is so great that if an author waits until the decision of the first publisher is known, the submission to the second journal may take place a whole year later. (Some Scientific journals, for example, [[JOSAB]], may keep a paper during more than one month to analyzing possible candidates for the reviewing). Yet that is a waste of resource, in the case of those journals which do not get the paper to publish. A researcher, after obtaining and verifying his extraordinary result, wants to publish it in [[Physical Review Letters]] but is afraid that the paper will be rejected, and his competitors will obtain and publish the result earlier. So, the researcher submits the same result to several national [[scientific journal]](s) of low [[impact factor]] over the world: 'Proceedings of [[Springfield University]]', ' [[Revista Científica de Guacatelamala]]', '[[Le Courier Scientific de la Republic Democratic Cannibas]]', 'Научный Бюллетень Myxосранского Технологического Института', 'Journal der Angewandten Chemieinstituts von Kuyzad', [[保險海套大学の仕訳]] (6 examples of low-impact factor journals, which actually do not exist), and so on. That is, if 15 journals nod that paper, while only one of them may publish, that is a waste—for 14 of them. Most (all?) journals and popular magazines already tell the potential author not to do that. Alternatively, for an application to the graduate school, the university does not ban that. If that model (request a fee) is/were popular also in the publication field, the "waste of resource" would relate to only the money from out of the pocket of the applicant. <!-- If the final publication does pay (or, the author does want that for other motivation), the author may take that risk to pay for the review of a few. This would facilitate more opportunities to get tested, soon !--> ===Journal republishing=== It occasionally happens that author(s) publishes the same article twice, whether in the same or different journals. <!--. The same scientific content may appear in several journal with slitght variations.[[example needed!]] <!-- Usually, it occurs when the ability of authors to publish their papers exceed their ability to get new, interesting and correct results !-->. <!--For example, the new [[laser material]], !--> == Exposure of multiple publications == With the advancement of the internet, there are now several tools available to aid in the detection of [[plagiarism]] and multiple publications within biomedical literature. One tool developed in 2006 by researchers in Dr. [[Harold Garner]]'s laboratory at [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas]] is [http://spore.swmed.edu/dejavu/ Déjà Vu], an open-access database containing several thousand instances of duplicate publication. ==References== <references /> [[Category:Academic literature]] {{publish-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>25380</id> <title>Multiplicative group</title> <text>{{Basic notions in group theory}} In [[mathematics]] and [[group theory]] the term '''multiplicative group''' refers to one of the following concepts, depending on the context *any group <math> \scriptstyle\mathfrak{{G}} \,\!</math> whose [[binary operation]] is written in '''multiplicative notation''' (instead of being written in [[additive notation]] as usual for [[abelian group]]s), *the '''underlying group under multiplication''' of the [[invertible]] elements of a [[field (mathematics)|field]]<ref>See Hazewinkel et. al. (2004), p. 2.</ref>, [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], or other structure having multiplication as one of its operations. In the case of a field ''F'', the group is {''F'' - {0}, •}, where 0 refers to the [[zero element]] of the ''F'' and the [[binary operation]] • is the field [[multiplication]], *the [[algebraic torus]] <math> \scriptstyle\mathbf{GL}_1 </math>. ==Group scheme of roots of unity== The '''group scheme of <math>n</math>-th [[roots of unity]]''' is by definition the kernel of the <math>n</math>-power map on the multiplicative group <math> \scriptstyle\mathbf{GL}_1 </math>, considered as a [[group scheme]]. That is, for any integer <math>n>1</math> we can consider the morphism on the multiplicative group that takes <math>n</math>-th powers, and take an appropriate [[fiber product]] in the sense of [[scheme theory]] of it, with the morphism <math>e</math> that serves as the identity. The resulting group scheme is written ''<math>\mu_n</math>''. It gives rise to a [[reduced scheme]], when we take it over a field <math> \scriptstyle\mathbb{K} </math>, [[if and only if]] the [[characteristic (field)|characteristic]] of <math> \scriptstyle\mathbb{K} </math> does not divide <math>n</math>. This makes it a source of some key examples of non-reduced schemes (schemes with [[nilpotent element]]s in their [[structure sheaf|structure sheaves]]); for example ''<math>\mu_p</math>'' over a [[finite field]] with <math>p</math> elements for any [[prime number]] <math>p</math>. This phenomenon is not easily expressed in the classical language of algebraic geometry. It turns out to be of major importance, for example, in expressing the [[duality theory of abelian varieties]] in characteristic <math>p</math> (theory of [[Pierre Cartier (mathematician)|Pierre Cartier]]). The Galois cohomology of this group scheme is a way of expressing [[Kummer theory]]. == Notes == <references/>
