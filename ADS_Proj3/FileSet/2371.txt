on the physical side of science approaches almost to unanimity, that the stream of knowledge is heading towards a non-mechanical reality; the universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine. Mind no longer appears as an accidental intruder into the realm of matter; we are beginning to suspect that we ought rather to hail it as the creator and governor of the realm of matter.<ref>Jeans, Sir James (1938).

Reprint of the Second Edition of 1931.</ref></blockquote> ===Linking to REALITY=== To formally implement the linkage in question as a feature of the JG Upgrade Model, it was necessary to add notational symbolism able to describe the nature of the coding which transpires at the MIND-REALITY interface. To this end, symbols were introduced to signify the mental processes which are used to create instruction and to apply it, as well as the act of describing such processes. To this end, corresponding operators were added to the JG inventory for: * prescription (formula creation) * inscription (formula implementation) * description (discussion) Other symbolism was incorporated to signify authorship ( '''''Kx''''' ), as well as the language being employed ('''''Lx''''' ) vis-a-vis the ''language continuum'' (the global blend of ideolects, dialects, and languages), as well as the data types operative as media to be structured in the physical domain ('''''Mx''''').<ref>Lytle, Eldon G. (2009) ''LANGUAGE in Capital Letters'' (eBook edition), Chapt. 17. Rose Valley NV: Linguistic Technologies, Inc. [http://www.language-icl.com]</ref> ===Versatility of the Notation=== These notational addenda, when systematically organized and augmented with other pertinent formal devices, enable the linguist to write expressions for such diverse activities as mental modeling, conversation, putting one’s words into action, and use of the empirical method for discovery. Inasmuch as the system of classical junction rules can be derived directly from the new, more comprehensive symbolism, it is clear that the enhancements in question are a natural extension of the original model. ===JG 'Signatures' as Scientific Classifiers=== Whorf made one prediction which struck most as presumptuous in the extreme at the time. To quote:  <blockquote>People generally do not yet know that the forces studied by linguistics are powerful and important, that its principles control every sort of agreement and understanding among human beings, and that sooner or later, it will have to sit as judge while the other sciences bring their results to its court to inquire into what they mean.<ref>Carroll (1998), pg. 232.</ref> </blockquote> The credibility of this foresight - which effectively promotes linguistics to the status of SUPER-SCIENCE - gathers strength in the context of JG Upgrade Notation by virtue of its use of scripting ''signatures'' (cf. music) which systematically specify (1) '''''Kx''''' (authorship), (2) '''''Lx''''' (language used), and (3) '''''Mx''''' (representational media used). Given that these labels apply to all natural and synthetic languages (including mathematics), plus the proposition that mature notation mirrors the domain studied by its clientele, there is no apparent reason why linguistic signatures could not be employed to plot coordinates on a map of science at large. This, perhaps, is what Whorf had in mind when he predicted that "sooner or later, it [linguistics] will have to sit as judge while the other sciences bring their results [notation] to its court to inquire into what they mean," that is, where they fit into the overall panorama of epistemological enquiry. ===Recent Literature=== For an expansive discussion of The JG Upgrade Model, see Lytle’s most recent writings.'<ref>Lytle (2009), ''LANGUAGE''</ref> ==References== <!--- See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically --> <references/> <!--- Categories ---> <!--- Links to the same article in other languages - if the articles exist already --> <!--- see [[Help:Interlanguage links]] --> [[Category:Grammar]] [[Category:Syntax]] [[Category:Semantics]] [[Category:Phonology]] [[Category:Linguistics]] [[Category:Formal languages]]</text> </page> <page> <id>20285</id> <title>Junkbot</title> <text>{{Infobox VG | title = Junkbot | collapsible = | state = | show image = | image = [[Image:JunkbotTitle.png|300px]] | caption = The ''Junkbot'' title screen. | aspect ratio = | resolution = | designer = Frank Lantz<br>Eric Zimmerman<br>Nick Fortugno | developer = [[Gamelab]] | publisher = [[Lego Group]] | distributor = | license = | series = ''Junkbot'' series | engine = ''Junkbot'' engine | version = | genre = [[Puzzle video game|Puzzle]] | modes = Single-player | ratings = None | platforms = Lego.com | media = | requirements = [[Adobe Shockwave]] | input = }} '''''Junkbot''''' is a [[puzzle video game]] created by [[Gamelab]] for the [[Lego Group]], and hosted on Lego.com. It is about a robot called Junkbot (or JunkBot, Junk bot, or Junk Bot) who eats trash. The gameplay involves moving [[Lego brick]]s to get the main character, Junkbot to his goal of eating all the trash in each level. The game also has a sequel, called [[Junkbot#Junkbot: Undercover|''Junkbot: Undercover'']]. ==Plot== Junkbot is a robot who loves to eat trash (along with the cans that contain them). One day, Junkbot gets a job as a janitor of a factory- just so he can get more of his beloved meal. The factory, though, has many secrets... ==Characters== ===Main characters=== *'''Junkbot'''- The namesake protagonist. A robot who loves to eat trash (along with the cans that contain them), so he gets a job as the janitor of a factory, so he can get more of his beloved meal. *'''Bossbot'''- The head of the factory Junkbot receives employment at. Bossbot is an Eyebot with a tie. He's only seen in a picture attached to a letter Junkbot receives that welcomes him to the factory (written by Bossbot himself, of course). In the [[Junkbot#Sequel|sequel]], Bossbot's picture is seen in another letter he wrote to Junkbot, this time denying the existence of "PROJECT X". ===Enemies=== These are characters Junkbot must avoid physical contact with, or else he will lose the level. *'''Gearbot'''- These robots can only move horizontally on a flat surface. They will move back when they hit a wall. *'''Climbot'''- These robots can move in any direction and can climb over short structures. However, they can't float
