or even hundreds of smaller [[Server (computing)|servers]]. While mainframes pioneered this capability, virtualization is now available on most families of computer systems, though not always to the same degree or level of sophistication. Mainframes can add or [[hot swap]] system capacity non disruptively and granularly, to a level of sophistication usually not found on most servers. Modern mainframes, notably the IBM [[zSeries]], [[System z9]] and [[System z10]] servers, offer two levels of [[Platform virtualization|virtualization]]: logical partitions ([[LPAR]]s, via the [[PR/SM]] facility) and virtual machines (via the [[z/VM]] operating system). Some IBM mainframe customers run no more than two machines {{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}: one in their primary data center, and one in their [[disaster recovery|backup data center]]—fully active, partially active, or on standby—in case there is a catastrophe affecting the first building. Test, development, training, and production workload for applications and databases can run on a single machine, except for extremely large demands where the capacity of one machine might be limiting. Such a two-mainframe installation can support continuous business service, avoiding both planned and unplanned outages. In practice most customers use multiple mainframes linked by [[Parallel Sysplex]] and shared [[Direct access storage device|DASD]]. Mainframes are designed to handle very high volume input and output (I/O) and emphasize throughput computing. Since the mid-1960s, mainframe designs have included several subsidiary computers (called [[System/360#Channels|''channels'']] or [[CDC 6600#Peripheral Processors .28PPs.29|''peripheral processors'']]) which manage the I/O devices, leaving the CPU free to deal only with high-speed memory. It is common in mainframe shops to deal with massive [[database]]s and files. Giga-record or tera-record files are not unusual.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wintercorp.com/PressReleases/ttp2005_pressrelease_091405.htm |title=Largest Commercial Database in Winter Corp.

Mainframe [[return on investment]] (ROI), like any other computing platform, is dependent on its ability to scale, support mixed workloads, reduce labor costs, deliver uninterrupted service for critical business applications, and several other risk-adjusted cost factors. Some argue{{Who|date=December 2010}} that the modern mainframe is not cost-effective. [[Hewlett-Packard]] and [[Dell, Inc.|Dell]] unsurprisingly take that view at least at times, and so do some independent analysts. [[Sun Microsystems]] also takes that view, but beginning in 2007 promoted a partnership with IBM which largely focused on IBM support for Solaris on its System x and BladeCenter products (and therefore unrelated to mainframes), but also included positive comments for the company's [[OpenSolaris]] operating system being ported to IBM mainframes as part of increasing the Solaris community. Some analysts (such as [[Gartner]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}) claim that the modern mainframe often has unique value and superior cost-effectiveness, especially for large scale enterprise computing. In fact, Hewlett-Packard also continues to manufacture its own mainframe (arguably), the [[NonStop]] system originally created by [[Tandem Computers|Tandem]]. Logical partitioning is now found in many [[UNIX]]-based servers, and many vendors are promoting virtualization technologies, in many ways validating the mainframe's design accomplishments while blurring the differences between the different approaches to enterprise computing. Mainframes also have execution integrity characteristics for [[fault tolerant]] computing. For example, z900, z990, System z9, and System z10 servers effectively execute result-oriented instructions twice, compare results, arbitrate between any differences (through instruction retry and failure isolation), then shift workloads "in flight" to functioning processors, including spares, without any impact to operating systems, applications, or users. This hardware-level feature, also found in HP's [[NonStop]] systems, is known as lock-stepping, because both processors take their "steps" (''i.e.'' instructions) together. Not all applications absolutely need the assured integrity that these systems provide, but many do, such as financial transaction processing. ==Market== [[IBM mainframe]]s dominate the mainframe market at well over 90% [[market share]].<ref> {{cite web |url=http://openmainframe.org/news/ibm-tightens-stranglehold-over-mainframe-market-gets-hit-wit.html |title=IBM Tightens Stranglehold Over Mainframe Market; Gets Hit with Antitrust Complaint in Europe |date=2008-07-02 |publisher=CCIA |accessdate=2008-07-09}}</ref> [[Unisys]] manufactures [[Burroughs large systems|ClearPath]] mainframes, based on earlier [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry]] and [[Burroughs Corporation|Burroughs]] product lines. In 2002, [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] co-developed the [[zSeries]] z800 with IBM to share expenses, but subsequently the two companies have not collaborated on new Hitachi models. [[Hewlett-Packard]] sells its unique [[NonStop]] systems, which it acquired with [[Tandem Computers]] and which some analysts classify as mainframes. [[Groupe Bull]]'s DPS, [[Fujitsu]] (formerly Siemens) [[BS2000]], and Fujitsu-[[ICL VME]] mainframes are still available in Europe. Fujitsu, Hitachi, and [[NEC]] (the "JCMs") still maintain nominal mainframe hardware businesses in their home Japanese market, although they have been slow to introduce new hardware models in recent years. The amount of vendor investment in mainframe development varies with marketshare. Unisys, HP, Groupe Bull, Fujitsu, Hitachi, and NEC now rely primarily on commodity [[Intel]] [[CPU]]s rather than custom processors in order to reduce their development expenses, and they have also cut back their mainframe software development. (However, Unisys still maintains its own unique CMOS processor design development for certain high-end ClearPath models but contracts chip manufacturing to IBM.) In stark contrast, IBM continues to pursue a different business strategy of mainframe investment and growth. IBM has its own large research and development organization designing new, homegrown CPUs, including mainframe processors such as 2008's 4.4 GHz quad-core z10 mainframe microprocessor. IBM is rapidly expanding its software business, including its mainframe software portfolio, to seek additional revenue and profits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enterprisenetworksandservers.com/monthly/art.php?3306|title=IBM Opens Latin America's First Mainframe Software Center|publisher=Enterprise Networks and Servers|month=August | year=2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/22556.wss|title=IBM Helps Clients Modernize Applications on the Mainframe|publisher=IBM|date=November 7, 2007}}</ref> ==History== {{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}} Several manufacturers produced mainframe computers from the late 1950s through the 1970s. The group of manufacturers was first known as "[[BUNCH|IBM and the Seven Dwarfs]]": [[IBM]], [[Burroughs Corporation|Burroughs]], [[UNIVAC]], [[NCR Corporation|NCR]], [[Control Data Corporation|Control Data]], [[Honeywell Corporation|Honeywell]], [[General Electric]] and [[RCA]]. Later, shrinking, it was referred to as IBM and the [[BUNCH]]. IBM's dominance grew out of their [[IBM 700/7000 series|700/7000 series]] and, later, the development of the [[System/360|360]] series mainframes. The latter architecture has continued to evolve into their current zSeries mainframes which, along with the then Burroughs and now
