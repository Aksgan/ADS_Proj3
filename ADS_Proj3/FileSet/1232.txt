In general, a single value can't be assigned to a fraction where the denominator is 0 so the value remains undefined (see below for other applications). ===Fallacies based on division by zero=== It is possible to disguise a special case of division by zero in an [[algebra]]ic argument,<ref name="Kaplan"/> leading to [[invalid proof|spurious proofs]] that 1 = 2 such as the following: With the following assumptions: :<math>\begin{align} 0\times 1 &= 0 \\ 0\times 2 &= 0. \end{align}</math> The following must be true: :<math>0\times 1 = 0\times 2.\,</math> Dividing by zero gives: :<math>\textstyle \frac{0}{0}\times 1 = \frac{0}{0}\times 2.</math> Simplified, yields: :<math>1 = 2.\,</math> The [[fallacy]] is the implicit assumption that dividing by 0 is a legitimate operation. ==In calculus== ===Extended real line=== At first glance it seems possible to define ''a''/0 by considering the [[limit of a function|limit]] of ''a''/''b'' as ''b'' approaches 0. For any positive ''a'', the limit from the right is :<math>\lim_{b \to 0^+} {a \over b} = +\infty</math> however, the limit from the left is :<math>\lim_{b \to 0^-} {a \over b} = -\infty</math> and so the <math>\lim_{b \to 0} {a \over b}</math> is undefined (the limit is also undefined for negative ''a''). Furthermore, there is no obvious definition of 0/0 that can be derived from considering the limit of a ratio. The limit :<math> \lim_{(a,b) \to (0,0)} {a \over b} </math> does not exist. Limits of the form :<math> \lim_{x \to 0} {f(x) \over g(x)} </math> in which both ''ƒ''(''x'') and ''g''(''x'') approach 0 as ''x'' approaches 0, may equal any real or infinite value, or may not exist at all, depending on the particular functions ''ƒ'' and ''g'' (see [[l'Hôpital's rule]] for discussion and examples of limits of ratios). These and other similar facts show that the expression 0/0 cannot be [[well-defined]] as a limit. ====Formal operations==== A [[formal calculation]] is one carried out using rules of arithmetic, without consideration of whether the result of the calculation is well-defined. Thus, it is sometimes useful to think of ''a''/0, where ''a'' ≠ 0, as being <math>\infty</math>. This infinity can be either positive, negative, or unsigned, depending on context. For example, formally: :<math>\lim\limits_{x \to 0} {\frac{1}{x} =\frac{\lim\limits_{x \to 0} {1}}{\lim\limits_{x \to 0} {x}}} = \frac{1}{0} = \infty.</math> As with any formal calculation, invalid results may be obtained. A logically rigorous as opposed to formal computation would say only that :<math>\lim\limits_{x \to 0^+} \frac{1}{x} = \frac{1}{0^+} = +\infty\text{ and }\lim\limits_{x \to 0^-} \frac{1}{x} = \frac{1}{0^-} = -\infty.</math> (Since the [[one-sided limit]]s are different, the two-sided limit does not exist in the standard framework of the real numbers. Also, the fraction 1/0 is left [[Defined and undefined|undefined]] in the [[extended real line]], therefore it and : <math> \frac{\lim\limits_{x \to 0} 1 }{\lim\limits_{x \to 0} x}</math> are meaningless [[Expression (mathematics)|expressions]].) ===Real projective line=== The set <math>\mathbb{R}\cup\{\infty\}</math> is the [[real projective line]], which is a [[one-point compactification]] of the real line. Here <math>\infty</math> means an ''unsigned infinity'', an infinite quantity that is neither positive nor negative. This quantity satisfies <math>-\infty = \infty</math>, which is necessary in this context. In this structure, <math>\scriptstyle a/0 = \infty</math> can be defined for nonzero ''a'', and <math>\scriptstyle a/\infty = 0</math>. It is the natural way to view the range of the tangent and cotangent functions of [[trigonometry]]: tan(''x'') approaches the single point at infinity as ''x'' approaches either <math>\scriptstyle+\pi/2</math> or <math>\scriptstyle-\pi/2 </math> from either direction. This definition leads to many interesting results. However, the resulting algebraic structure is not a [[Field (mathematics)|field]], and should not be expected to behave like one. For example, <math>\infty + \infty</math> is undefined in the projective line. ===Riemann sphere=== The set <math>\mathbb{C}\cup\{\infty\}</math> is the [[Riemann sphere]], which is of major importance in [[complex analysis]]. Here too <math>\infty</math> is an [[unsigned infinity]] – or, as it is often called in this context, the [[point at infinity]]. This set is analogous to the real projective line, except that it is based on the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[complex number]]s. In the Riemann sphere, <math>1/0=\infty</math>, but 0/0 is undefined, as is <math>0\times\infty</math>. ===Extended non-negative real number line=== The negative real numbers can be discarded, and infinity introduced, leading to the set [0, ∞], where division by zero can be naturally defined as ''a''/0 = ∞ for positive ''a''. While this makes division defined in more cases than usual, subtraction is instead left undefined in many cases, because there are no negative numbers. ==In higher mathematics== Although division by zero cannot be sensibly defined with real numbers and integers, it is possible to consistently define it, or similar operations, in other mathematical structures. ===Non-standard analysis=== In the [[hyperreal number]]s and the [[surreal number]]s, division by zero is still impossible, but division by non-zero [[infinitesimal]]s is possible. ===Distribution theory=== In [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution theory]] one can extend the function <math>\textstyle\frac{1}{x}</math> to a distribution on the whole space of real numbers (in effect by using [[Cauchy principal value]]s). It does not, however, make sense to ask for a 'value' of this distribution at ''x'' = 0; a sophisticated answer refers to the [[singular support]] of the distribution. ===Linear algebra=== In [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] algebra (or [[linear algebra]] in general), one can define a pseudo-division, by setting ''a''/''b'' = ''ab''<sup>+</sup>, in which ''b''<sup>+</sup> represents the pseudoinverse of ''b''. It can be proven that if ''b''<sup>−1</sup> exists, then ''b''<sup>+</sup> = ''b''<sup>−1</sup>. If ''b'' equals 0, then 0<sup>+</sup> = 0; see [[Generalized inverse]]. ===Abstract algebra=== Any number system that forms a [[commutative ring]] — for instance, the integers, the real numbers, and the complex numbers — can be extended to a [[wheel theory|wheel]] in which division by zero is always possible; however, in such a case, "division" has a slightly different meaning. The concepts applied to standard arithmetic are similar to those in more general algebraic structures, such as [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[field (mathematics)|fields]]. In a field, every nonzero element is invertible under multiplication; as above, division poses problems only when attempting to divide by zero. This is likewise true in a [[skew field]] (which for this reason is called a [[division ring]]).
