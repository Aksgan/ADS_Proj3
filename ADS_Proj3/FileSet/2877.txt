Mesa is an [[ALGOL]]-like language with strong support for [[modularity (programming)|modular programming]]. Every library module has at least two [[source code|source]] files: a ''definitions'' file specifying the library's [[interface (computer science)|interface]] plus one or more ''program'' files specifying the [[implementation]] of the procedures in the interface.<ref>Mesa Language Manual, chapter 7. (The Manual uses the term ''module'' to mean a source file.)</ref> To use a library, a program or higher-level library must "import" the definitions. The Mesa compiler [[Type system#Type checking|type-checks]] all uses of imported entities; this combination of separate compilation with type-checking was unusual at the time. Mesa introduced several other innovations in language design and implementation, notably in the handling of [[exception (programming)|software exception]]s, [[thread (computer programming)|thread]] [[synchronization (computer science)|synchronization]], incremental [[compiler|compilation]], and more. Mesa was developed on the [[Xerox Alto]], one of the first [[personal computer]]s with a [[graphical user interface]], however most of the Alto's system software was written in [[BCPL]]. Mesa was the system programming language of the later [[Xerox Star]] workstations, and for the [[GlobalView]] desktop environment. Xerox PARC developed Cedar, which was based on Mesa, with a number of additions including garbage collection, better string support, called Ropes, and a native compiler for Sun SPARC workstations. Mesa had a major influence on the design of other important languages, such as [[Modula-2]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], and was an important vehicle for the development and dissemination of the fundamentals of [[GUI]]s, networked environments, and the other advances [[Xerox]] contributed to the field of [[computer science]]. ==History== Mesa was originally designed<!--Dates??? Names???--> in the Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL), a branch of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, for the [[Xerox Alto|Alto]], an experimental micro-coded workstation. Initially its spread was confined to PARC and a few universities to which Xerox had donated some Altos. Mesa was later adopted as the system's programming language for Xerox's commercial workstations such as the [[Xerox Star|Xerox 8010 (Xerox Star, Dandelion)]] and [[Xerox Daybreak|Xerox 6085 (Daybreak)]], in particular for the [[Pilot (operating system)|Pilot operating system]]. A secondary development environment, called the [[Xerox Development Environment]] (XDE) allowed developers to debug both the operating system Pilot as well as ViewPoint GUI applications using a world swap mechanism. This allowed the entire "state" of the world to be swapped out, and allowed low level system crashes which paralyzed the whole system to be debugged. The Pilot/Mesa world in later releases moved away from the world swap view when the micro-coded machines were phased out in favor of SPARC workstations and Intel PC's running a Mesa PrincOps emulator for the basic hardware instruction set. Mesa was taught via the Mesa Programming Course that took people through the wide range of technology Xerox had available at the time and ended with the programmer writing a "[[hack (technology slang)|hack]]", a workable program designed to be useful. An actual example of such a hack is the BWSMagnifier, which was written in 1988 and allowed people to magnify sections of the workstation screen as defined by a resizable window and a changeable magnification factor. Trained Mesa programmers from Xerox were well versed in the fundamental of GUIs, networking, exceptions, and multi-threaded programming, almost a decade before they became standard tools of the trade. Within Xerox, Mesa was eventually superseded by the [[Cedar (programming language)|Cedar]] programming language. Many Mesa programmers and developers left Xerox in 1985; some of them went to [[DEC Systems Research Center]] where they used their experience with Mesa in the design of [[Modula-2+]], and later of [[Modula-3]]. ==Main features== ===Semantics=== Mesa was a [[strongly typed programming language]] with type-checking across module boundaries, but with enough flexibility in its type system that heap allocators could be written in Mesa.<ref name="geschke">{{cite journal | author = Charles Geschke | authorlink = Charles Geschke | coauthors = [[James H.

They also simplified source-level [[debugger|debugging]], including remote debugging via the [[Ethernet]]. Mesa had rich exception-handling facilities, with four types of exceptions. It has support for thread synchronization via monitors. Mesa was the first language to implement monitor BROADCAST, a concept introduced by the Pilot operating system <ref name="monit">{{cite journal | url = http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=358824 | title = Experience with Processes and Monitors in Mesa | author = Butler W.

For instance, [[block (programming)|compound command]]s are indicated by BEGIN/END keywords, rather than [[brace (punctuation)|brace]]s. In Mesa, all keywords are written in uppercase.<ref name="manual"/> Due to a peculiarity of the Alto's [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]], Mesa's original character set did not include the [[underscore]],
