the software was called ''R1'' and was renamed ''[[XCON]]'' when placed in service. Fundamentally, ''XCON'' was a rule-based ''configuration [[database]]'' written as an expert system using [[forward chaining]] rules. As one of the first expert systems to be pressed into commercial service it created high expectations, which did not materialize, as DEC lost commercial pre-eminence. <ref>Virginia E. Barker and Dennis E. O'Connor. Expert systems for configuration at Digital: XCON and beyond. Communications of the ACM, 32(3):298--318, March 1989.</ref> ==Help Desk software== [[Help desk]]s frequently use help desk [[software]] that captures [[symptom]]s of a [[Computer bug|bug]] and relates them to fixes, in a ''fix database''. One of the problems with this approach is that the understanding of the problem is embodied in a non-human way, so that solutions are not unified. ==Strategies for finding fixes== #The ''bubble-up'' strategy simply records pairs of symptoms and fixes. The most frequent set of pairs is then presented as a tentative solution, which is then attempted. If the fix works, that fact is further recorded, along with the configuration of the presenting system, into a ''solutions database''. #Oddly enough, shutting down and [[booting]] up again manages to 'fix,' or at least 'mask,' a [[computer bug|bug]] in many computer-based systems; thus ''reboot'' is the remedy for distressingly many symptoms in a 'fix database.' The reason a reboot often works is that it causes the [[RAM]] to be flushed. However, typically the same set of actions are likely to create the same result demonstrating a need to refine the "startup" applications (which launch into memory) or install the latest fix/patch of the offending application. #Currently, most expertise in finding fixes lies in human domain experts, who simply sit at a replica of the computer-based system, and who then 'talk through' the problem with the client to duplicate the problem, and then relate the fix. ==References== <references/> [[Category:Help desk]] [[Category:Product lifecycle management]] [[Category:Computer systems]]</text> </page> <page> <id>7484</id> <title>Computer Aided Verification</title> <text>'''Computer Aided Verification''' ('''CAV''') is an annual [[academic conference]] on the theory and practice of computer aided formal analysis of software and hardware systems. The conference consists of peer-reviewed research papers and system descriptions. The proceedings are published by [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] in the [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science|LNCS]] series. Extended versions of selected papers are regularly published as special issues of international computer science journals. The first CAV was held in 1989 in [[Grenoble]], [[France]]; so was the 20th anniversary CAV in 2009. CAV traditionally attracts attention from the computer industry.{{Fact|date=May 2008}} == History of the conference == * [http://www-cav2009.imag.fr/ 21st CAV 2009], Grenoble, France * [http://www.princeton.edu/cav2008/ 20th CAV 2008], Princeton, NJ, USA * [http://www.cav2007.org/ 19th CAV 2007], Berlin, Germany * 18th CAV 2006, Seattle, WA, USA * [http://www.cav2005.inf.ed.ac.uk/ 17th CAV 2005], Edinburgh, Scotland, UK :Special Issue: Logical Methods in Computer Science, [http://www.lmcs-online.org/ojs/specialIssues.php?id=4 Selected Papers of the Conference ''Computer Aided Verification 2005''] * [http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/CAV/ 16th CAV 2004], Boston, MA, USA * 15th CAV 2003, Boulder, CO, USA * 14th CAV 2002, Copenhagen, Denmark * 13th CAV 2001, Paris, France * 12th CAV 2000, Chicago, IL, USA * 11th CAV 1999, Trento, Italy * 10th CAV 1998, Vancouver, Canada * 9th CAV 1997, Haifa, Israel :Special Issue: Formal Methods in System Design 18(2), 2001 * 8th CAV 1996, New Brunswick, NJ, USA * 7th CAV 1995, Liege, Belgium * 6th CAV 1994, Palo Alto, CA, USA * 5th CAV 1993, Elounda, Greece * 4th CAV 1992, Montreal, Canada * 3rd CAV 1991, Aalborg, Denmark * 2nd CAV 1990, New Brunswick, NJ, USA * 1st CAV 1989, Grenoble, France == See also == * The [[list of computer science conferences]] contains other academic conferences in computer science. == External links == *[http://www.cav-conference.org/ CAV home page] *[http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/conf/cav/index.html DBLP bibliography for CAV] [[Category:Theoretical computer science conferences]] [[Category:Logic conferences]] {{comp-sci-stub}} {{compu-conference-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>7485</id> <title>Computer Arts Society</title> <text>The '''Computer Arts Society''' ('''CAS''') was founded in [[1968]], in order to encourage the creative use of computers in the arts.<ref>''Page'', No. 1, April 1969, p2.</ref> <ref>Herzogenrath, W. & Nierhoff-Wielk, B., eds.

They knew [[Jasia Reichardt]], the curator of [[Cybernetic Serendipity]] (1968) and had participated in or advised on aspects of the exhibition. Sutcliffe was involved with the exhibition through his collaboration with composer [[Peter Zinovieff]] and [[Electronic Music Studios (London) Ltd|Electronic Music Studios (EMS)]]. Mallen was working with the English Cybernetician [[Gordon Pask]] at Systems Research and assisted on the production of the interactive robotic work Colloquy of Mobiles shown at the exhibition. Although not mentioned in the catalogue credits, Reichardt knew and respected Lansdown, who from 1963, had used computing techniques in architectural design and planning.<ref>[[Jasia Reichardt]], ''When New Media was New'', Seminar at [[Tate Gallery]], September 30, 2003.</ref> The original idea for a society dedicated to the computer arts (which was to become the Computer Arts Society) was instigated by Sutcliffe, at the IFIP ([[International Federation for Information Processing]]) Congress in August 1968 in Edinburgh. Sutcliffe and Zinovieff had won second prize with ZASP, their piece of computer-composed music. Members of the Congress suggested to Sutcliffe that he might like to convene a meeting of people working in a similar field whilst they were all together at the Congress, as most had not had a chance to meet like-minded persons outside their own team before. Sutcliffe collated the names of interested individuals and the group formed out of this, with the first meetings in London held in a room belonging to [[University College
