separated from another part with contrary interests or with confidential information from an adverse party. In the [[United Kingdom]], a law firm may represent competing parties in a suit, but only if there is no communication between partners.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In the United States, at least in Ohio,{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} it is illegal for members of the same law firm to represent both sides of a legal conflict regardless of whether the individuals communicate about the case. To do so is considered a conflict of interest and can result in disciplinary action against the attorney or the firm that employs him or her. Even Legal Aid{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} cannot represent both sides of a conflict. ==Computer science==<!-- This section is linked from [[Clean room design]] --> In [[computer science]], there are two common areas of usage: [[reverse engineering]] and [[computer security]]. ===Reverse engineering=== Chinese wall refers to a [[reverse engineering]] method involving two separate groups. One group reverse-engineers the original code and writes thorough documentation, while the other group writes new code based only on the new documentation. This method insulates the new code from the old code, so that it will not be considered a derived work. See also [[clean room design]]. ===Computer security=== {{Main|Brewer and Nash model}} The '''Chinese Wall Model''' (also '''Brewer and Nash Model''') is a [[computer security model|security model]] where read/write access to files is governed by membership of data in conflict-of-interest classes and datasets. This is the basic model used to provide both [[data privacy|privacy]] and [[data integrity|integrity]] for data. ==See also== *[[Glass-Steagall Act]] *[[Brewer and Nash model]] *[[Great Firewall of China]] *[[Great Wall of China]], which predates these terms and usage. ==References== {{reflist}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Chinese Wall}} [[Category:Financial terminology]] [[Category:Informal legal terms]] [[Category:Journalism standards]] [[Category:Data security]] [[de:Chinese Wall (Finanzwelt)]] [[it:Modello Brewer e Nash]] [[pl:Mur Chi≈Ñski (informatyka)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>6117</id> <title>Chinook (draughts player)</title> <text>{{Other uses|Chinook (disambiguation)}} '''Chinook''' is a computer program that plays [[English draughts]] (also known as checkers), developed around 1989 at the [[University of Alberta]], led by [[Jonathan Schaeffer]]. Other developers are [[Rob Lake]], [[Paul Lu]], [[Martin Bryant (programmer)|Martin Bryant]], and [[Norman Treloar]]. In July 2007, Chinook's developers announced that the program has been improved to the point where it cannot lose a game.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/19/science/19cnd-checkers.html?hp Computer Checkers Program Is Invincible - New York Times<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> ==Man vs. Machine World Champion== Chinook is the first [[computer program]] to win the world champion title in a competition against humans. In 1990 it won the right to play in the human World Championship by being second to [[Marion Tinsley]] in the US Nationals. At first the [[American Checker Federation|American Checkers Federation]] and [[English Draughts Association]] were against the participation of a computer in a human championship. When Tinsley resigned his title in protest, the ACF and EDA created the new title [[Man vs. Machine World Championship]], and competition proceeded. Tinsley won with four wins to Chinook's two, with 33 draws. In a rematch, Chinook was declared the Man-Machine World Champion in checkers in 1994 in a match against Marion Tinsley after six drawn games, and Tinsley's withdrawal due to pancreatic cancer. While Chinook became the world champion, it had never defeated the best checkers player of all time, Tinsley, who was significantly superior to even his closest peer.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060829085713/http://www.math.wisc.edu/~propp/chinook.html 1994 Chinook-Tinsley checkers match]</ref> In 1995, Chinook defended its man-machine title against [[Don Lafferty]] in a 32 game match. The final score was 1-0 with 31 draws for Chinook over Lafferty. <ref>[http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~chinook/matches/1995/Petal/ Details] of the 1995 Man vs. Machine World Championship</ref> After the match, Jonathan Schaeffer decided not to let Chinook compete any more, but instead try to [[solve game|solve]] checkers. It was rated at 2814.{{Clarifyme|date=February 2009}} ==Algorithm== Chinook's program [[algorithm]] includes an opening book, a library of opening moves from games played by grandmasters; a deep search algorithm; a good move evaluation function; and an end-game database for all positions with eight pieces or fewer. The linear handcrafted evaluation function considers several features of the game board, including piece count, kings count, trapped kings, turn, runaway checkers (unimpeded path to be kinged) and other minor factors. All of Chinook's knowledge was programmed by its creators, rather than learned with [[artificial intelligence]]. ==Timeline== Jonathan Schaeffer wrote a book about Chinook called ''One Jump Ahead: Challenging Human Supremacy in Checkers'', in 1997.<ref>Schaeffer, Jonathan. ''One Jump Ahead:: Challenging Human Supremacy in Checkers'', 1997, Springer, ISBN 978-0387949307.</ref> An updated version of the book was published November 2008.

On March 10, 2007, Jonathan Schaeffer announced (at the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[SIGCSE]] 2007 conference) that a final solution to checkers was expected within 3-5 months. On July 19, 2007, the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' published Schaeffer's team's article "Checkers Is Solved", presenting their proof that the best a player playing against Chinook can achieve is a draw.<ref>[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1144079v1 Checkers Is Solved - Schaeffer et al., 10.1126/science.1144079 - Science<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> ==References== <references/> ==External links== *[http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~chinook/ Chinook Homepage] *[http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~chinook/publications/ Technical information on Chinook] [[Category:Computer draughts players]] [[Category:Game artificial intelligence]] [[de:Chinook (Programm)]] [[pl:Chinook (program komputerowy)]] [[pt:Chinook (programa de computador)]] [[zh-yue:Chinook]]</text> </page> <page> <id>6120</id> <title>ChipWits</title> <text>{{Infobox VG |title= ChipWits |image= [[Image:ChipwitFU.png|ChipwitFU.png]] |caption= ChipWits logo from 1984 manual. |developer= Doug Sharp<br /> Mike Johnston |publisher= [[Sherwin Steffin|BrainPower]] |distributor= |designer= |series= |engine= |version= |released= 1984 |genre= Robot Simulation |modes= Single Player |ratings= |platforms= [[Apple Macintosh]], [[Apple II]], [[Commodore 64]] |media= |requirements= |input= }} {{Portal box|Video games|Robotics}} '''ChipWits''' is a 1984 game for the [[Apple Macintosh]], programmed by Doug
