Qapacity is headquartered in [[Barcelona]], Spain. They are funded by Grupo Intercom<ref>[http://www.grupointercom.com/ingles/home.cfm Grupo Intercom web site]</ref>. == Features == Qapacity is a promotion tool dedicated to small businesses and freelancers and it includes: a website builder, a service directory based on a [[reputation system]] and a social network for service providers and potential clients. <ref>[http://qapacity.com/about/ Qapacity Website]</ref> Qapacity also integrates [[social media]] services and sites such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]]. === Website Builder === Qapacity is a free website builder dedicated to small businesses and freelancers who want to promote their services online. It allows users to create, upload and embed [[web content]] (such as text, images, video, [[RSS]] feeds etc.) by using a simple [[WYSIWYG]] (What You See Is What You Get) interface. Users can furthermore personalize their website by choosing one of the ten available themes, adding a customized header, starting a [[blog]] and/or uploading a [[career portfolio]]. Users choose their sub-domain (e.g.: http://mybusinesswebsite.qapacity.com) and their site is hosted for free. === Service directory === Every service added in Qapacity is listed in a searchable directory and as of January 15, 2009 it list services from Argentina, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea (South Korea), Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, The Netherlands, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Venezuela. The two countries with the biggest number of representatives are Spain and The United States, followed by Colombia, India, Mexico, Peru, Argentina. <ref>[http://qapacity.com/pages/faq/#q0-5 Qapacity Frequently Asked Questions Page]</ref> === Reputation System === Qapacity is build on a simple reputation system: service providers can ask for recommendations from their clients and publish them along any comments their clients might have on their website. Recommendations increase the rating of the Qapacity users and make them more visible in the Service Directory. === Social Network === Qapacity allows users to "add as contacts" those service providers whom they are interested in/ want to bookmark/ are their friends. ==References== {{reflist}} == External links == * [http://qapacity.com/ Qapacity web site] * [http://mashable.com/2009/02/09/qapacity/ Qapacity: A More Social Home for Your Small Business (Mashable)] * [http://webworkerdaily.com/2009/02/11/qapacity-find-and-provide-services-through-networking/ Qapacity: Find and Provide Services Through Networking (Web Worker Daily)] [[Category:Web 2.0]] [[Category:Community websites]] [[Category:Internet properties established in 2008]] [[Category:Professional networks]] [[Category:Social network services]] [[Category:Social information processing]] [[Category:Global internet community]] [[Category:Social media]] [[es:Qapacity]]</text> </page> <page> <id>30703</id> <title>QuRiNet</title> <text>{{Cleanup|date=October 2009}} The '''Quail Ridge Wireless Mesh Network''' project is an effort to provide a wireless communications infrastructure to the wildlife reserve. The network will benefit on-site ecological research and provide a wireless mesh network testbed for development and analysis. This is a joint project with the [[University of California Natural Reserve System]] and the Networks Lab at the Department of Computer Science, UC Davis. [[File:qr view.jpg]] The goal is to create a large scale wireless mesh network backbone deployed within the reserve. Various sensor networks would gather temperature, visual, and acoustic data at certain locations. This information would then be passed back to the field station for storage or for further relay over Ethernet. The backbone nodes will also serve as access points enabling wireless access at their locations. The Quail Ridge Reserve will also act as a test bed for research in wireless mesh networks. Some of our research goals include: * Layer 2 Routing: We would like to forward traffic at the MAC layer in order to avoid excess processing time and addressing required by current routing protocols. We are interested in finding ways to intelligently select paths for packets at the MAC layer. * Monitoring and Maintenance Tools: With access to the Quail Ridge Test Bed, we would like to design and develop wireless mesh network monitoring and maintenance tools that would be useful to future mesh network administrators and researchers. * Time Based Access Mechanisms [[Time division multiple access]]: Current 802.11 mesh networks must utilize CSMA/CA in order to access the channel. With a large number of users, it may be more efficient to organize access
