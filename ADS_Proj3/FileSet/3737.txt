explicitly endorse such invasive control. Parfit's argument for this position relies on our intuitions regarding [[thought experiment]]s such as [[teleportation]], the fission and fusion of persons, gradual replacement of the matter in one's brain, gradual alteration of one's psychology, and so on. Parfit's conclusion is similar to [[David Hume]]'s view, and also to the view of the self in [[Buddhism]], though it does not restrict itself to a mere reformulation of them. For besides being ''reductive'', Parfit's view is also ''deflationary'': in the end, "what matters" is not personal identity, but rather mental continuity and connectedness. ==Future generations== Part 4 deals with questions of our responsibility towards future generations. It raises questions about whether it can be wrong to create a life, whether environmental destruction violates the rights of future people, and so on. One question Parfit raises is this: given that the course of history drastically affects what people are actually born (since it affects which potential parents actually meet and have children; and also, a difference in the time of conception will alter the genetic makeup of the child), do future persons have a right to complain about our actions, since they likely wouldn't exist if things had been different? Another problem Parfit looks at is the ''[[mere addition paradox]]'', which supposedly shows that it is better to have a lot of people who are slightly happy, than a few people who are very happy. Parfit calls this view "repugnant", but says he has not yet found a solution. == External links == *[http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/oso/public/content/philosophy/019824908X/toc.html ''Reasons and Persons''] at Oxford Scholarship Online.

She is affiliated with the [[Georgia Institute of Technology Center for Robotics and Intelligent Machines|RIM@GT]] and the [[GVU Center]]. Grinter's research lies generally in the fields of [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI) and [[computer-supported cooperative work]] (CSCW). She has chaired and published papers in top-tier academic conferences in these fields. Her research and expert opinion on technology have also been reported in major news media sources. ==Biography== ===Early life and education=== Grinter was born in [[Norwich]], [[England]], [[UK]] and attended the [[City of Norwich School]] and [[Hethersett High School]].<ref name="BekiAcademic">{{ cite web | url=http://www.grinter.org/Beki.html | last=Grinter | first=Beki | title=Beki: Academic | accessdate=2008-03-28 }}</ref> She pursued undergraduate studies at the [[University of Leeds]], graduating in 1991 with a [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]] (Hons) in [[Computer Science]]. Following this, Grinter received a [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council|EPSRC]] fellowship to study at the [[University of California, Irvine]], where she earned a [[Master of Science|M.S.]] (1994) and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] (1996), both in Information and Computer Science.<ref name="BekiAcademic" /> As a graduate student, Grinter was influenced by [[David Parnas]], whose work in software engineering spoke to Grinter's burgeoning interest in the relationship between humans and software.<ref>{{ cite book | title=HCI Remixed: Essays on Works That Have Influenced the HCI Community | last=Grinter | first=Rebecca E. | chapter=The Work to Make Software Work | year=2008 | publisher=MIT Press | location=Cambridge, MA, USA | pages=97–101 | editor=Thomas Erickson and David W.
