Early versions were developed for large [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] computers. Up until version 5, there was a [[Unix]] binary available, and this continues to be used by many universities and research institutions. The current version, version 12, is available for the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] environment. GenStat was originally developed at the then [[Rothamsted Experimental Station]] (now Rothamsted Research) by a team led by [[John Nelder]], and is programmed in [[Fortran]]. ''GenStat Discovery Edition'' is a free version of the statistical software GenStat. GenStat Discovery Edition 3 is available to non-commercial users throughout Africa and a range of developing countries outside Africa. Examples of users who qualify are students and lecturers of universities and staff of government research organisations or NGOs. When you register for a license you will be asked for information about the status of the organisation which will be using the software to determine whether it qualifies for the free version. It is developed by VSN International which is owned by The [[Numerical Algorithms Group]] and Rothamsted Research. ==Further reading== {{cite doi|10.1002/wics.32}} ==External links== *[http://www.vsni.co.uk/products/genstat/ GenStat homepage by VSN Intl.] {{Statistical software}} [[Category:Fortran software]] [[Category:Statistical software]] [[Category:Windows-only software]] {{Windows-software-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>14901</id> <title>Gene H.

(1953), M.A. (1954) and Ph.D. (1959) all in the field of Mathematics.<ref>Chen Greif, Gene H. Golub Biography, Online at Oxford University Press [http://www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-920681-3.pdf ], accessed 24 November 2007</ref> His M.A. degree was more specifically in Mathematical Statistics. His PhD dissertation was entitled "The Use of Chebyshev Matrix Polynomials in the Iterative Solution of Linear Equations Compared to the Method of Successive Overrelaxation" and his thesis adviser was [[Abraham Taub]]. He had been at Stanford since 1962 and became a professor there in 1970. He had advised almost thirty doctoral students, many of whom have themselves achieved distinction. Gene Golub was an important figure in numerical analysis and pivotal to creating the NA-Net and the NA-Digest, as well as the [[International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics]].<ref>{{citation|title=Obituary: Gene H.

Van Loan]]. He was a major contributor to algorithms for matrix decompositions. In particular he published an algorithm together with [[William Kahan]] in 1970 that made the computation of the [[singular value decomposition]] (SVD) feasible and that is still used today. A survey of his work was published in 2007 by [[Oxford University Press]] as "Milestones in Matrix Computation".<ref>{{Citation | last1 =Chan | first1 = Raymond | last2 = Greif | first2 = Chen | last3 = O'Leary | first3 = Dianne | title = Milestones in Matrix Computation: The selected works of Gene H.

Bolzano Gold Medal for Merits in the Field of Mathematical Sciences and was one of the rare few elected to three national academies: the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] (1993), the [[United States National Academy of Engineering|National Academy of Engineering]] (1990), and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (1994).
