They may at times also [[advocate]] or [[lobbying|lobby]] on a particular issue or on a range of issues but are generally distinct from [[Advocacy groups]] and pressure groups which are normally set up for the specific political aim; the distinction is not firm however and some organizations can adapt and change their focus over time. ==Mathematics SIGs== The [[Mathematical Association of America]] includes several SIGs (known collectively as SIGMAAs) on mathematical areas.<ref> {{cite web |url=http://www.maa.org/SIGMAA/ |title=SIGMAA: Special Interest Groups of the MAA |accessdate=2009-01-19 |work= |publisher=Mathematical Association of America |date=2008-08-22 }}</ref> ==Non-technical SIGs== Organizations which are not technical may also have Special Interest Groups which are normally focused on a mutual interest<ref name="The Community Discovered Special Interest Groups">[http://communitydisc.westside66.org/HTML/sigs/ The Community Discovered Special Interest Groups], groups for specific interests within an educational organization.</ref> or shared characteristic of a subset of members of the organization.<ref name="FGC Summer Gathering AYF Program">[http://fgcquaker.org/gathering/overview/kids-teens-young-adults/adult-young-friends Friends General Conference Summer Gathering Adult Young Friends Program], a young adult-focused SIG in a [[Quaker]] organization.</ref> An important example for this are [[trade unions]].

The SIG also strives to educate the public to support careers for people with disabilities. ==Description== The SIG membership (from both academia and industry) focuses on the application of technologies to serve the needs of persons with vision, motor, hearing, and speech impairments; cognitive limitations, including learning disabilities; and issues of aging. Topics on advanced technologies, assistive technologies, and design form the core of the research topics. ==Annual Conferences/Workshops== ASSETS: '''International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility'''. ==Name of Newsletter== Accessibility and Computing ==References== *[http://www.acm.org/sigaccess/ SIGACCESS Website] [[Category:Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Groups]]</text> </page> <page> <id>35278</id> <title>Specification (regression)</title> <text>In [[regression analysis]] and related fields such as [[econometrics]], '''specification''' is the process of converting a theory into a regression model. This process consists of selecting an appropriate [[function (mathematics)|functional form]] for the model and choosing which variables to include. Model specification is one of the first steps in regression analysis. If an estimated model is misspecified, it will be biased and inconsistent.<ref>Lee, Cheng Few; Lee, John C.; Lee, Alice C.''Statistics for Business and Financial Economics.''

There are several different causes of specification error: *incorrect functional form *a variable omitted from the model may have a relationship with both the dependent variable and one or more of the independent variables ([[omitted-variable bias]]);<ref>[http://cemood.people.wm.edu/603.html Untitled<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> *an irrelevant variable may be included in the model *the dependent variable may be part of a [[simultaneous equation]] (simultaneity bias) *[[measurement errors]] may affect the independent variables. ==Detection== The [[Ramsey RESET test]] can help test for specification error. ==References== <references /> *{{cite journal|last = Thursby|first = Jerry G.|coauthors = Schmidt, Peter|title = Some Properties of Tests for Specification Error in a Linear Regression Model|journal = Journal of the American Statistical Association|volume = 72|issue = 359| pages = 635–641|url = http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0162-1459%28197709%2972%3A359%3C635%3ASPOTFS%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Z&size=LARGE|month = September|year = 1977|doi = 10.2307/2286231|publisher = Journal of the American Statistical Association, Vol. 72, No. 359}} *{{cite journal|last = Sapra|first = Sunil|title = A regression error specification test (RESET) for generalized linear models|journal = Economics Bulletin|volume = 3|issue = 1|year = 2005|pages = 1–6|url = http://economicsbulletin.vanderbilt.edu/2005/volume3/EB-04C50033A.pdf|format=PDF}} [[Category:Regression analysis]] [[Category:Econometrics]]</text> </page> <page> <id>35289</id> <title>Spectral flux</title> <text>{{refimprove|date=September 2010}} :''This article is about the [[Digital signal processing]] term. For the term used in [[astronomy]], which refers to a different measure, see [[Spectral flux density]].'' '''Spectral flux''' is a measure of how quickly the [[power spectrum]] of a [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] is changing, calculated by comparing the power spectrum for one frame against the power spectrum from the previous frame. More precisely, it is usually calculated as the 2-norm (also known as the [[Euclidean distance]]) between the two [[Audio normalization|normalised]] spectra. Calculated this way, the spectral flux is not dependent upon overall power (since the spectra are normalised), nor on phase considerations (since only the magnitudes are compared). The spectral flux can be used to determine the timbre of an audio signal, or in [[Onset (audio)|onset]] detection, among other things. ==Variations== Some implementations use the 1-norm rather than the 2-norm (i.e. the sum rather than the Euclidean distance). Some implementations do not normalise the spectra. For onset detection, increases in energy are important (not decreases), so some algorithms only include values calculated from bins in which the energy is increasing. ==References== * Dixon, S.
