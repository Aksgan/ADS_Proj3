"Scripts" are distinct from the core code of the application, as they are usually written in a different language and are often created or at least modified by the [[End-user (computer science)|end-user]].<ref>IEEE Computer, 2008, ''In praise of scripting,'' [[Ronald Loui]] author</ref> Scripts are often [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreted]] from source code or [[bytecode]], whereas application software is typically first [[compiler|compiled]] to a native machine code or to an [[intermediate code]].<ref>{{cite web | last=Brown | first=Vicki | title="Scripting Languages" | url=http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.15/15.09/ScriptingLanguages/index.html | accessdate=2009-07-22}} </ref> The name "script" is derived from the written script of the [[performing arts]], in which dialogue is set down to be spoken by human actors.{{fact|date=July 2010}} Early script languages were often called ''[[batch language]]s'' or ''job control languages''. Such early scripting languages were created to shorten the traditional edit-[[compiler|compile]]-[[Linker (computing)|link]]-run process. == History == Early [[mainframe computer]]s (in the 1950s) were non-interactive instead using [[batch processing]]. IBM's [[Job Control Language]] (JCL) is the archetype of language used to control batch processing. The first interactive [[shell (computing)|shell]]s were developed in the 1960s to enable remote operation of the first [[time-sharing]] systems, and these used shell scripts, which controlled running computer programs within a computer program, the shell. Historically, there was a clear distinction between "real" high speed programs written in languages such as [[C (programming language)|C]], and simple, slow scripts written in languages such as [[Bourne Shell]] or [[Awk]]. But as technology improved, the performance differences shrank and interpreted languages like [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[Perl]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] emerged and gained in popularity to the point where they are considered general-purpose programming languages and not just languages that "drive" an interpreter. Languages such as [[Tcl]] and [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] were specifically designed as general purpose scripting languages that could be embedded in any application or used on their own. Other languages such as [[Visual Basic for Applications]] (VBA) provided strong integration with the automation facilities of an underlying system. Embedding of such general purpose scripting languages instead of developing a new language for each application also had obvious benefits, relieving the application developer of the need to code a language translator from scratch and allowing the user to apply skills learned elsewhere. The [[Common Gateway Interface]] allowed scripting languages to control [[web server]]s, and thus communicate over the web. Scripting languages that made use of CGI early in the evolution of the Web include [[Perl]], [[Active Server Pages|ASP]], and [[PHP]]. Some software incorporates several different scripting languages. Modern [[web browser]]s typically provide a language for writing extensions to the browser itself, and several standard embedded languages for controlling the browser, including [[JavaScript]] (a dialect of [[ECMAScript]]) and [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]]. == Types of scripting languages == === Job control languages and shells === {{main|Shell script}} A major class of scripting languages has grown out of the automation of job control, which relates to starting and controlling the behavior of system programs. (In this sense, one might think of shells as being descendants
