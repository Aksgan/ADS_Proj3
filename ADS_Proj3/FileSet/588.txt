'''Group Calendar''' – a [[calendar]] showing dates of groups in addition to individual calendars. * '''[[Multiple calendars]]''' – this feature allows users to create separate calendars (i.e. work calendar, children school calendar). * '''[[Multi viewing]]''' – this feature allow users to select how their calendar is displayed: one day, one week, one month, or one year. * '''[[Printing]]''' – User may print selected schedule. Usually, this feature allows users to select how she wants to have the printout to look (i.e. include comments, subject only, etc.). * '''[[Web-based interface]]''' – allow users to access their calendars from any computer or mobile device (including cell phone) without having to solely rely on their work or personal computer. ==Examples== {{multicol}} * [[AcePlanner]] * [[Chandler (PIM)]] * [[Citadel/UX]] * [[Contactizer]] on [[Mac OS X]] * [[Google Calendar]] * [[iCal]] {{multicol-break}} * [[ICal_server|iCalServer]] * [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Microsoft Exchange]] * [[Microsoft Outlook]] * [[Mozilla Sunbird]] * [[Netscape Communicator]] {{multicol-break}} * [[Novell GroupWise]] * [[Now Up-to-Date & Contact]] * [[PeopleCube]] * [[Sun Java Calendar Server]] * [[Ubidesk]] * [[Windows Live Mail]] {{multicol-break}} * [[Teamwork (software)]] * [[Yahoo!

The documents, which include manuscripts, slide photographs, newspaper clippings, works of art, journals, film, sound recordings, and other ephemera, are housed in the [[special collections]] department of the [[UCSB Libraries]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], where they are made accessible to researchers upon request. An effort is currently underway to make certain documents available online through the [[Online Archive of California]]. ==History== CEMA was founded in 1988 by Joseph A. Boissé and Salvador Güereña, both UCSB librarians. The library already had a substantial collection of primary and secondary-sources in the ''Colección Tloque Nahuaque'', a library of [[Chicano studies]] materials, and the need for special resources to preserve and catalogue primary resources became apparent. The primary resources, which at that time consisted primarily of silkscreen posters from the Chicano art movement, were transferred from the ethnic and gender studies library to the department of special collections. Güereña began the acquisition of other collections immediately, and today CEMA is the repository for over 100 collections from each of the four main ethnic groups in California: [[Latino]]s, [[Asian American]]s, [[African American]], and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], although Mexican American collections still outnumber collections from the other groups. ==Projects== In 2001, CEMA was selected by the Online Archive of California, an internet resource, to supply digital images of Chicano art from its extensive photographic collections as part of California's contribution to the [[United States Congress|Congressionally]]-mandated [[American Memory]] project to preserve and increase the accessibility of documents from [[American history]]. Since that time, CEMA has provided over 7,000 digital images for the project. ==Collections== CEMA's collections include the archives of artistic, political, and professional organizations, as well as the papers of individual artists, musicians, activists, and writers, many of whom were active in the [[Chicano Movement|Chicano]], [[anti-war]], and [[civil rights]] movements. Notable collections include: *[[Oscar Zeta Acosta]] *Asian American Theater Company *[[Black Panther Party]] ([[San Francisco Bay Area]]) *[[Ana Castillo]] *[[Católicos por la Raza]] *[[Iris Chang]] *[[Centro Cultural de la Raza]] *[[Frank Chin]] *[[Comisión Femenil Mexicana Nacional]] *[[Ricardo Cruz]] *[[Galería de la Raza]] *Adelina García *[[Lalo Guerrero]] *Kearney Street Workshop *[[Yolanda Lopez]] *[[MEChA]] *[[Miguel Méndez]] *[[José Montoya]] *[[Royal Chicano Air Force]] *[[Self Help Graphics & Art]] *[[Teatro Campesino]] *[[REFORMA]] *[[Rini Templeton]] *[[Don Tosti]] *[[Maria Helena Viramontes]] *Nellie Wong ==References== *[http://www.library.ucsb.edu/speccoll/collections/cema/index.html Official site] *[http://www.oac.cdlib.org/ Online Archive of California] {{coord missing|Santa Barbara County, California}} [[Category:California culture]] [[Category:Mexican-American culture]] [[Category:History of California]] [[Category:Archives in the United States]] [[Category:Mexican-American history]] [[Category:University of California, Santa Barbara]] [[Category:Geographic region-oriented digital libraries]]</text> </page> <page> <id>5379</id> <title>Cambridge Computer Lab Ring</title> <text>The '''Cambridge Computer Lab Ring''' is a not-for-profit independent members' association that campaigns on behalf of Cambridge computer scientists to build the Cambridge community in computing. It was launched in October 2002 to provide graduates of the [[Cambridge University Computer Laboratory]] with a lifetime benefit from their Cambridge degrees. The association was cited by [[Richard Lambert]] in the [[Lambert Review]] of Business-University Collaboration (3.8, p32) as an example of how "universities, departments and faculties should develop their alumni networks in order to build closer relationships with their graduates working in the business community." == External links == *[http://www.camring.ucam.org/ Cambridge Computer Lab Ring] *[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/ Cambridge University Computer Laboratory] *[http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/media/9/0/lambert_review_final_450.pdf Lambert Review of Business-University Collaboration] December 2003 [[Category:Clubs and societies of the University of Cambridge|Computer]] [[Category:University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory]] {{UCambridge-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>5380</id> <title>Cambridge Diploma in Computer Science</title> <text>Originally known as the "Diploma in Numerical Analysis and Automatic Computing", the '''Diploma in Computer Science''' was a [[conversion course]] in [[Computer Science]] offered by the [[University of Cambridge]], [[England]]. Although a "Diploma" for historic reasons, it would be considered a "conversion Masters course" at other institutions. The Diploma was the world's first full-year taught course in computer science, starting in 1953. It attracted students with degrees in mathematics, science and engineering. At its peak, there were 50 students on the course. UK government ([[EPSRC]]) funding was withdrawn in 2001 and student numbers dropped dramatically. In 2007, the University took the decision to withdraw the Diploma at the end of the 2007-08 academical year, after 55 years of service. The spirit of the Diploma lives on in the [[Computer Science Tripos]], a three-year undergraduate programme which developed out of the original one-year
