In April 2001, the lawsuit was dropped. Lawyers said they feared proceeding with the suit would slow down payments from a special German Holocaust fund created to compensate forced laborers and others who had suffered due to the Nazi persecution. IBM's German division paid $3 million into the fund, although the corporation made clear that it was not admitting liability with its contribution.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/07/08/ramasastry.holocaust.ibm/index.html|title=A Swiss court allows Gypsies' Holocaust lawsuit to proceed, Case questions role of corporate giant IBM in World War II|work=Law Center, Find Law|last=Ramasastry|first=Anita|date=July 8, 2004}}</ref> In 2004, the human rights organization [[GIRCA|Gypsy International Recognition and Compensation Action]] (GIRCA) filed suit against IBM in [[Switzerland]].
