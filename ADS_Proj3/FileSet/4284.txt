The SWDP is targeted at [[software developer]]s interested in writing web applications that use [[Web 2.0]] technologies such as [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]], [[Representational State Transfer|REST]], [[Atom (standard)|Atom]], and [[JavaScript]]. ==Software Included in the SWDP== The SWDP consists of the following software: * [[Scripting language|Scripting language support]] ** [[Project Phobos]], a project that allows you to write web applications in [[JavaScript]] or other scripting languages * [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax technologies]] ** [[Jmaki|Project jMaki]], a framework for creating Ajax-enabled web applications in Java, PHP, or Phobos ** Project Dynamic Faces, a framework for creating Ajax-enabled [[JavaServer Faces]] applications * [[Representational State Transfer|REST]] ** RESTful web services, an [[Application programming interface|API]] for creating REST [[web service]]s in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] ** [[Web Application Description Language|WADL]] * ROME, a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[Application programming interface|API]] for parsing and generating [[RSS]] and [[Atom (standard)|Atom]] [[web feed]]s * Atom Server (The ROME Propono subproject), a [[prototype]] [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[Application programming interface|API]] and framework for creating a [[web feed]] server for [[Atom (standard)|Atom]] feeds ==Release history== Release 1 of the SWDP was made public on March 12, 2007. ==External links== * [http://developers.sun.com/web/swdp/index.jsp Sun Web Developer Pack home page] * Documentation ** [http://developers.sun.com/web/swdp/docs/tutorial/doc/toc.html Online SWDP Tutorial] ** [http://developers.sun.com/web/swdp/docs/tutorial/download.html SWDP Tutorial bundle download] ** [http://developers.sun.com/web/swdp/docs/GettingStarted.html Getting Started with the SWDP] * java.net project pages ** [https://ajax.dev.java.net Project jMaki] ** [https://jsf-extensions.dev.java.net Project Dynamic Faces] ** [https://phobos.dev.java.net Project Phobos] ** [https://wadl.dev.java.net WADL] ** [https://rome.dev.java.net ROME API] [[Category:Scripting languages]] [[Category:Web 2.0]] [[Category:Web services]] [[Category:World Wide Web]] [[Category:Java programming language]] [[Category:Sun Microsystems]] [[Category:Sun Microsystems software]] [[Category:Web application frameworks]] [[Category:Java enterprise platform]] [[Category:Java platform]] [[Category:Software architecture]]</text> </page> <page> <id>36146</id> <title>SunnComm</title> <text>'''SunnComm International Inc.''' was the company that developed and owned the [[MediaMax]] technology software package, which was sold as a form of [[copy protection]] for [[compact discs]]. MediaMax Technology [http://www.mediamaxtechnology.com/] is the exclusive sales and marketing arm for SunnComm's MediaMax suite of products, and is "on track"[http://biz.yahoo.com/iw/051004/096995.html] to merge with SunnComm. Both companies received attention in 2005 due to its involvement in the [[2005 Sony BMG CD copy protection scandal|Sony BMG CD copy protection scandal]]. It is believed that both companies went under soon after when the development team was replaced and reorganized by Scott S. Stoegbauer which included Ron Phillips, Neal Meyer and Jim DiZoglio. The new company operated under the name [http://www.amergencegroup.com/ TranzByte] attempting to focus on non-controversial products such as DVCD which proved to be disastrous. == External links == * [http://www.sunncomm.com/ Official Site] * The Register, ''Is SunnComm a sham or the next, big DRM success?''

An improvement over [[VisiCalc]], SuperCalc was notable for being one of the first spreadsheet programs capable of iteratively solving [[circular reference]]s (cells that depend on each other's results). It would be over 10 years after the introduction of SuperCalc before this feature was implemented in [[Microsoft Excel]], although in [[Lotus 1-2-3]], manual programming of iterative logic could also be used to solve this issue. According to the SuperCalc product manager, iterative calculations were added when Sorcim changed from BCD to Binary math. Since the precision of the two math packages was different, some IF statements resolved differently, and iterative calculations helped solve this problem{{Or|date=August 2010}}. Versions of SuperCalc were later released for the [[Apple II family]], for [[IBM PC compatibles|PCs]] running [[MS-DOS|DOS]], and, after Sorcim was bought by [[Computer Associates]] (CA) in the mid-1980s, for [[Microsoft Windows|MS Windows]] (under the name '''CA-SuperCalc'''). {{DEFAULTSORT:Supercalc}} [[Category:Spreadsheet software]] [[Category:Microcomputer software]] [[Category:CP/M software]] [[Category:DOS software]] [[Category:Windows software]] [[Category:1980 software]] {{Business-software-stub}} [[cs:SuperCalc]] [[de:SuperCalc]] [[et:SuperCalc]] [[es:SuperCalc]] [[nl:SuperCalc]] [[ja:SuperCalc]] [[pl:SuperCalc]] [[pt:SuperCalc]]</text> </page> <page> <id>36156</id> <title>SuperCollider</title> <text>: ''This article is about the programming language.
