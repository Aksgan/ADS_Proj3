The German and the Hungarian editions of Wikipedia are exceptions to this rule: the German Wikipedia has been testing a system of maintaining "stable versions" of articles,<ref>{{cite mailing list|first=P. |last=Birken |url=http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikide-l/2008-December/021594.html |title=Bericht Gesichtete Versionen |mailinglist=Wikide-l |date=2008-12-14 |language=German |publisher=Wikimedia Foundation |accessdate=2009-02-15}}</ref> to allow a reader to see versions of articles that have passed certain reviews. In June 2010, it was announced that the English Wikipedia would remove strict editing restrictions from "controversial" or vandalism-prone articles (such as [[George W. Bush]], [[David Cameron]] or [[homework]]) by using reviews.<ref>{{cite web| title = Wikimedia blog » Blog Archive » A quick update on Flagged Revisions| accessdate = 2009-08-30| url = http://blog.wikimedia.org/2009/08/26/a-quick-update-on-flagged-revisions/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = Wikipedia:Flagged protection and patrolled revisions – Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia| accessdate = 2009-08-25| url = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Flagged_protection_and_patrolled_revisions#cite_ref-7}}</ref> In place of an editing prohibition for new or unregistered users, there would be a "new system, called 'pending changes'" which, [[Jimmy Wales]] told the [[BBC]], would enable the English Wikipedia "to open up articles for general editing that have been protected or semi-protected for years." The "pending changes" system was introduced on June 15, shortly after 11pm GMT. Edits to specified articles are now "subject to review from an established Wikipedia editor before publication." Wales opted against the German Wikipedia model of requiring editor review before edits to ''any'' article, describing it as "neither necessary nor desirable." He added that the administrators of the German Wikipedia were "going to be closely watching the English system, and I'm sure they'll at least consider switching if the results are good."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/10312095.stm "Wikipedia introduces edit mechanism for divisive pages"], Jonathan Frewin, BBC, June 15, 2010</ref> [[File:History comparison example.png|thumb|left|alt=Web page showing side-by-side comparison of an article highlighting changed paragraphs.|[[Editor]]s keep track of changes to articles by checking the difference between two revisions of a page, displayed here in red.]] Contributors, registered or not, can take advantage of features available in the software that powers Wikipedia.

The most developed state of articles is called "featured article" status: articles labeled as such are the ones that will be featured in the main page of Wikipedia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2365/2182 |title=First Monday |publisher=First Monday |date= |accessdate=2010-07-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.research.ibm.com/visual/papers/hidden_order_wikipedia.pdf|author=Fernanda B.

The discussion pages attached to a project are often used to coordinate changes that take place across articles. Wikipedia also maintains a style guide called the [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] or MoS for short, which stipulates, for example, that, in the first sentence of any given article, the title of the article and any alternative titles should appear in bold. === Rules and laws governing content === For legal reasons, content in Wikipedia is subject to the laws (in particular [[copyright|copyright law]]) of [[Florida]], where Wikipedia servers are hosted. Beyond that, the Wikipedian editorial principles are embodied in the "{{srlink|WP:Five pillars|five pillars}}", and numerous {{srlink|Wikipedia:List of policies and guidelines|policies and guidelines}} are intended to shape the content appropriately. Even these rules are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia editors as a community write and revise those policies and guidelines<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/index.php/id;1866322157;fp;2;fpid;2 |title=Who's behind Wikipedia?|publisher=PC World |date=2008-02-06 |accessdate=2008-02-07}}</ref> and enforce them by deleting, annotating with tags, or modifying article materials failing to meet them. The rules on the non English editions of the Wikipedia branched off a translation of the rules on the English Wikipedia and have since diverged to some extent. While they still show broad-brush similarities, they differ in many details. According to the rules on the English Wikipedia, each entry in Wikipedia to be worthy of inclusion must be about a topic that is [[wikt:encyclopedic|encyclopedic]] and is not a [[dictionary]] entry or dictionary-like.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:ISNOT |title=Wikipedia:ISNOT |accessdate=2010-04-01 |quote=Wikipedia is not a dictionary, usage, or jargon guide.}}</ref> A topic should also meet Wikipedia's standards of "[[Notability in Wikipedia|notability]]",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability |title=Wikipedia:Notability |accessdate=2008-02-13 |quote=A topic is presumed to be notable if it
