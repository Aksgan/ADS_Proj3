a standard for unlicensed fixed wireless. These Mac Layers typically used a 15–20 MHz channel using Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum and BPSK, CCK and QPSK for modulation. These devices all describe the customer premises wireless system as the Subscriber Unit "SU", and the operator transmitter delivering the last mile local loop services as the "Access Point" (AP). 802.11 uses the terms AP and STA (Station). ;2002–2005: Wi-Fi local loop Originally designed for short range [[mobile Web|mobile internet]] and [[local area network]] access, [[IEEE 802.11]] has emerged as the [[de facto standard]] for unlicensed Wireless Local Loop. More 802.11 equipment is deployed for long range data service than any other technology. These systems have provided varying results, as the operators were often small and poorly trained in radio communications, additionally 802.11 was not intended to be used at long ranges and suffered from a number of problems, such as the [[hidden node problem]]. Many companies such as [[KarlNet]] began modifying the 802.11 MAC to attempt to deliver higher performance at long ranges. ''(see [[Long-range Wi-Fi]])'' ;2005–present: Maturation of the Wireless ISP market In nearly every metropolitan area worldwide, operators and hobbyists deployed more and more unlicensed broadband point to multipoint systems. Providers that had rave reviews when they started faced the prospect of seeing their networks degrade in performance, as more and more devices were deployed using the license free U-NII (5.3/5.4 GHz) and ISM (2.4 and 5.8 GHz) bands and competitors sprung up around them. ;The growing interference problem Interference caused the majority of unlicensed wireless services to have much higher error rates and interruptions than equivalent wired or licensed wireless networks, such as the copper telephone network, and the coaxial cable network. This caused growth to slow, customers to cancel, and many operators to rethink their business model. There were several responses to these problems. ;2003: Voluntary frequency coordination (USA) NextWeb, Etheric Networks, GateSpeed and a handful of other companies founded the first voluntary spectrum coordination body – working entirely independently of government regulators. This organization was founded in March 2003 as [http://www.wbanc.com/ BANC], "Bay Area Network Coordination". By maintaining frequencies used in an interoperator database, disruptions between coordinating parties were minimized, as well as the cost of identifying new or changing transmission sources, by using the frequency database to determine what bands were in use. Because the parties in BANC comprised the majority of operators in the Bay Area, they used peer pressure to imply that operators who did not play nice would be collectively punished by the group, through interfering with the non cooperative, while striving not to interfere with the cooperative. BANC was then deployed in Los Angeles. Companies such as Deutsche Telekom joined. It looked like the idea had promise. ;2005: Operators flee unlicensed for licensed The better capitalized operators began reducing their focus on unlicensed and instead focused on licensed systems, as the constant fluctuations in signal quality caused them to have very high maintenance costs. NextWeb, acquired by Covad for a very small premium over the capital invested in it, is one operator who focused on licensed service, as did [[WiLine Networks]]. This led to fewer of the more responsible and significant operators actually using the BANC system. Without its founders active involvement, the system languished. ;2005 to present: Adaptive network technology Operators began to apply the principles of self healing networks. Etheric Networks followed this path. [[Etheric Networks]] focused on improving performance by developing dynamic interference and fault detection and reconfiguration. As well as optimizing quality based routing software, such as MANET and using multiple paths to deliver service to customers. This approach is generally called "[[Mesh Networking]]" which relies on [[Ad-Hoc Networking]] Protocols, however Mesh and ad-hoc networking protocols have yet to deliver high speed low latency business class end to end reliable local loop service, as the paths can sometimes traverse exponentially more radio links than a traditional star (AP->SU) topology. Adaptive network management actively monitors the local loop quality and behaviour, using automation to reconfigure the network and its traffic flows, to avoid interference and other failures. == Mobile Technologies == These are available in [[Code division multiple access|Code Division Multiple Access]](CDMA), [[Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications]] – DECT (TDMA/DCA) ( See ETSI 6 EN 300 765-1 V1.3.1 (2001-04) -"Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT); Radio in the Local Loop (RLL) Access Profile (RAP); Part 1: Basic telephony services"), [[GSM|Global System for Mobile Communications]](GSM), IS136 [[Time division multiple access|Time Division Multiple Access]](TDMA) as well as analog access technologies such as [[Advanced Mobile Phone System]](AMPS), for which there will be independent standards defining every aspect of modulation, protocols, error handling, etc. == Deployment == The Wireless Local Loop market is currently an extremely high growth market, offering Internet Service Providers immediate access to customer markets without having to either lay cable through a metropolitan area [[Mail transfer agent|MTA]], or work through the [[Incumbent local exchange carrier|ILECs]], reselling the telephone, cable or satellite networks, owned by companies that prefer to largely sell direct. This trend revived the prospects for local and regional ISPs, as those willing to deploy fixed wireless networks were not at the mercy of the large telecommunication monopolies. They were at the mercy of unregulated re-use of unlicensed frequencies upon which they communicate. Due to the enormous quantity of 802.11 "Wi-Fi" equipment and software, coupled with the fact that spectrum licenses are not required in the [[ISM band|ISM]] and [[U-NII]] bands, the industry has moved well ahead of the regulators and the standards bodies. Sprint and ClearWire were preparing to roll out massive WiMAX networks in the United States, but those talks may be stalled pending new investment.<ref>[http://www.thestreet.com/s/sprint-clearwire-near-new-wimax-deal/newsanalysis/technology-stories/10403584.html?dlbk Sprint, Clearwire Near WiMax Deal - TheStreet.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> == Wireless Local Loop (WLL) Standards == * [[Mobile phone|Mobile]]: ** [[Code division multiple access|CDMA]] (USA). ** [[Time division multiple access|TDMA]] (USA). ** [[GSM]] (ITU – Worldwide). ** [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]] 3rd Generation (World). ** [[Personal Handy-phone System]] (PHS in Japan, PAS/Xiaolingtong in China) * Fixed or local area network:
