Many [[personal computer]]s in the later 1980s and early 1990s displayed at most 256 different colors, freely selected by [[software]] (either by the user or by a program) from their wider hardware's color palette. Usual selections of colors in limited subsets (generally 16 or 256) of the full palette includes some RGB level arrangements commomly used with the 8 bpp palettes as ''master palettes'' or ''universal palettes'' (i.e., palettes for multipurpose uses). These are some representative software palettes, but any selection can be made in such types of systems. ===System specifics=== :These are selections of colors officially employed as system palettes in some popular [[operating system]]s for [[personal computer]]s that features 8-bit displays. :{| style="border-style: none" border="0" cellpadding="5" |- || [[Image:Windows 16colors palette sample image.png]] || [[List of software palettes#Microsoft Windows default 16-color palette|Microsoft Windows default 16-color palette]]<br/>16 colors |- || [[Image:Windows 20colors palette sample image.png]] || [[List of software palettes#Microsoft Windows default 20-color palette|Microsoft Windows default 20-color palette]]<br/>20 colors |- || [[Image:RiscOS 16colors palette sample image.png]] || [[List of software palettes#RISC OS default palette|RISC OS default 16-color palette]]<br/>16 colors |- |} ===RGB arrangements=== :These are selections of colors based on evenly ordered RGB levels, mainly used as ''master palettes'' to display any kind of image within the limitations of the 8-bit pixel depth. :{| style="border-style: none" border="0" cellpadding="5" |- || [[Image:RGB 6levels palette sample image.png]] || [[List of software palettes#6 level RGB|6 level RGB]]<br/>6<sup>3</sup> = 216 colors |- || [[Image:RGB 6-7-6-levels palette sample image.png]] || [[List of software palettes#6-7-6 levels RGB|6-7-6 levels RGB]]<br/>6×7×6 = 252 colors |- || [[Image:RGB 6-8-5levels palette sample image.png]] || [[List of software palettes#6-8-5 levels RGB|6-8-5 levels RGB]]<br/>6×8×5 = 240 colors |- || [[Image:RGB 8-8-4-levels palette sample image.png]] || [[List of software palettes#8-8-4 levels RGB|8-8-4 levels RGB]]<br/>8×8×4 = 256 colors |- |} ===Other common uses of software palettes=== :{| style="border-style: none" border="0" cellpadding="5" |- || [[Image:Grayscale 8bits palette sample image.png]] || [[List of software palettes#Grayscale palettes|Grayscale palettes]]<br/>up to 256 levels of gray |- || [[Image:Color gradient map (blue) palette sample image.png]] || [[List of software palettes#Color gradient palettes|Color gradient palettes]]<br/>up to 256 levels of any arbitrary hue |- || [[Image:Adaptative 8bits palette sample image.png]] || [[List of software palettes#Adaptive palettes|Adaptive palettes]]<br/>up to 256 picked colors |- || [[Image:False colors palette sample image.png]] || [[List of software palettes#False color palettes|False color palettes]]<br/>up to 256 continuous-tone colors |- |} ==List of computer hardware palettes== {{Main|List of 8-bit computer hardware palettes|List of 16-bit computer hardware palettes}} In early [[personal computer]]s and [[Computer terminal|terminals]] that offered color displays, some color palettes were chosen algorithmically to provide the most diverse set of colors for a given palette size, and others were chosen to assure the availability of certain colors. In many early home computers, especially when the palette choices were determined at the hardware level by [[resistor]] combinations, the palette was determined by the manufacturer. Many of early models output [[composite video]] [[YPbPr]] colors. When seen on TV devices, the perception of the colors may not correspond with the value levels for the YPbPr values employed (most noticeable with NTSC TV color system). For current RGB display systems for [[Personal computer|PC]]'s ([[Super VGA]], etc.), see the [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#16-bit RGB|16-bit RGB]] and [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#24-bit RGB|24-bit RGB]] for [[HighColor]] (''thousands'') and [[TrueColor]] (''millions of colors'') modes. For [[video game console]]s, see the [[List of palettes#List of videogame consoles palettes|List of videogame consoles]] section. For every model, their main different graphical color modes are listed based exclusively in the way they handle colors on screen, not all their different screen modes. The list is ordered roughly historically by video hardware, not grouped by branch. They are listed according to the original model of every system, which implies that enhanced versions, clones and compatibles also support the original palette. ===Terminals and 8-bit machines=== :{| style="border-style: none" border="0" cellpadding="5" |- || [[Image:Screen color test Teletext.png]] || [[List of 8-bit computer hardware palettes#Teletext|Teletext]] (1976)<br/>Graphic block characters, 8-color |- || [[Image:Screen color test AppleII HighRes.png]] || [[List of 8-bit computer hardware palettes#Apple_II_series|Apple II]] (1977)<br/>Low 16- and high resolution 4-color graphic modes <!-- Atari line comented out until further research will be complete.
