It differentiates from other [[social networking]] sites by the fact that it is an exclusively mobile based [[community]] and accessible only through the [[mobile phone]]. ==History== In July 2007, '''Global Network Solutions Europe Ltd (GNS Europe),''' the European business base for Japanese [[Sogo shosha]] [[Itochu]] in conjunction with '''Excite Japan Co''', one of the largest [[web portal]]s in Japan launched mobikade in the UK.<ref>[http://www.mobilemarketingmagazine.co.uk/2007/07/uk-launch-for-m.html Mobile Marketing Magazine: UK Launch for Mobikade<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> ==Business model== mobikade is an off-portal site which means there is no collaboration between mobikade and any [[mobile network operator]]. Site access is free, operator’s [[data transfer]] charges excluded. mobikade is funded by [[Mobile advertising|mobile advertisement]], and acts as an A2P (Application to Person) mobile network.<ref>[http://inbabble.com/2007/09/19/interview-atul-sasane-head-of-new-business-about-mobikade-social-networking-free-games-and-free-sms/ Interview: Atul Sasane, Head of New Business about Mobikade social networking, free games and free SMS « inbabble.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Every user registering agrees to receive up to four weekly [[SMS]] messages tailored to individual interests. Additionally, mobile [[web banners]] are shown throughout the site. ==Features== mobikade started off mainly as provider of free [[mobile games]], but focused more and more on social networking. The main feature is “What’s up now”, a [[micro-blogging]] application that allows all users to interact with one another. Additionally, they can also communicate through a mailbox feature and special interest groups. Moreover, mobikade also offers a photo album for users to send their pictures captured with [[camera phones]], as well as a free SMS service and about 30 free mobile games. Although most of the games are downloadable mini games, mobikade is one of the first UK providers of [[flash games]]. To encourage activity on the social networking features, users are rewarded with mobikade points for their actions. These points may be used for sending free SMS or for downloading games but also to apply for the monthly prizes, which mainly consist of small popular [[gadgets]] or [[vouchers]]. Every month applying users are drawn based on a random lottery system. ==Technology== The site is available on all [[XHTML]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] compliant handsets in the UK. Users have to be on one of the UK operator's [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]] connectivity to access mobikade. This ensures that all users are using their mobile handsets to access mobikade. This access control is implemented by restricting access to UK operator [[IP addresses]] only. ==Collaborations== In September 2007, mobikade tied up with '''BAM Student Marketing''' to embed its free SMS service in all major [[Students' union|student union]] websites.<ref>[http://www.pocketpicks.co.uk/latest/index.php/2007/09/19/mobikade-bringing-free-texts-to-student-union-websites/ Free SMS’s for students from Mobikade | Pocket Picks :: The coolest things for the coolest phones<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> ==See also== *[[Mobile Web]] *[[Mobile advertising]] *[[Mobile Marketing]] *[[List of social networking websites]] ==References== {{Reflist}} Other: *[http://tagedge.com/2007/07/26/mobikade-launches-in-uk/] ==External links== *[http://www.gnseurope.com Global Network Solution Europe Ltd.] {{Use dmy dates|date=September 2010}} [[Category:Social networks]]</text> </page> <page> <id>24781</id> <title>Mobile 3D Graphics API</title> <text>:''M3G redirects here, for the morphine metabolite see [[Morphine-3-glucuronide]]'' [[File:Asphalt 3 gameplay.png|thumb|right|Screenshot of ''[[Asphalt 3: Street Rules]]'', showing the capabilities of the Mobile 3D Graphics API.]] The '''Mobile 3D Graphics API''', commonly referred to as '''M3G''', is a specification defining an [[Application programming interface|API]] for writing [[Java (programming language)|Java]] programs that produce [[3D computer graphics]].
