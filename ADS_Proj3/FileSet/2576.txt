[[Category:Webcomic characters]] [[Category:Computer humor]] [[Category:Fictional characters in comics]]</text> </page> <page> <id>22026</id> <title>List of algebraic structures</title> <text>In [[universal algebra]], a branch of pure [[mathematics]], an [[algebraic structure]] is a [[variety (universal algebra)|variety]] or [[quasivariety]]. [[Abstract algebra]] is primarily the study of algebraic structures and their properties. Some [[axiom]]atic [[formal system]]s that are neither varieties nor quasivarieties, called ''nonvarieties'' below, are included among the algebraic structures by tradition. Other web lists of algebraic structures, organized more or less alphabetically, include [http://math.chapman.edu/cgi-bin/structures/ Jipsen] and [http://planetmath.org/browse/objects/ PlanetMath.] These lists mention many structures not included below, and may present more information about some structures than is presented here. ==Generalities== An algebraic structure consists of one or two [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] closed under some [[Operation (mathematics)|operations]], [[function (mathematics)|functions]], and [[relation (mathematics)|relations]], satisfying a number of [[axiom]]s, including none. This definition of an algebraic structure should not be taken as restrictive. Anything that satisfies the axioms defining a structure is an instance of that structure, regardless of how many other axioms that instance happens to satisfy. For example, all [[group (mathematics)|groups]] are also [[semigroup]]s and [[magma (algebra)|magmas]]. Structures are listed below in approximate order of increasing complexity as follows: *Structures that are [[variety (universal algebra)|varieties]] precede those that are not; *'''Simple''' structures built on one underlying set ''S'' precede '''composite''' structures built on two; * If ''A'' and ''B'' are the two underlying sets making up a composite structure, that structure may include [[function (mathematics)|functions]] of the form ''A''x''A''→''B'' or ''A''x''B''→''A''. *Structures are then ordered by the number and [[arity|arities]] of the operations they contain. The [[heap (mathematics)|heap]], a group-like structure, is the only structure mentioned in this entry requiring an operation whose [[arity]] exceeds 2. If structure ''B'' is under structure ''A'' and more indented, then ''A'' is [[interpretability|interpretable]] in ''B'', meaning that all [[theorem]]s of ''A'' are theorems of ''B''. The [[inverse relation|converse]] is usually not the case. A structure is [[trivial (mathematics)|trivial]] if the [[cardinality]] of ''S'' is less than 2, and is otherwise nontrivial. ==Varieties== [[identity (mathematics)|Identities]] are equations formulated using only the operations the structure allows, and variables that are tacitly [[universal quantifier|universally quantified]] over a set that is part of the definition of the structure. Hence identities contain no sentential [[connective]]s, [[quantification|existentially quantified variables]], or [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]] of any kind other than equality and the operations the structure allows. If the axioms defining an algebraic structure
