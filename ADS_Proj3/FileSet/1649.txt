'This is an empty testing class.' ... pass ... >>> bar = Foo() >>> bar <__main__.Foo object at 0x54f30> >>> del bar </source> In this session, an object is created, its location in the memory is displayed, and the only reference to the object is then destroyed—there is no way to ever use the object again from this point on, as there are no references to it. This becomes apparent when we try to access the original reference: <source lang="python"> >>> bar Traceback (most recent call last): File "<stdin>", line 1, in ? NameError: name 'bar' is not defined </source> As it is impossible to refer to the object, it has become useless: the object is garbage. Since Python uses garbage collection, it automatically deallocates the memory that was used for the object so that it may be used again: <source lang="python"> >>> class Bar(object): ... 'This is another testing class.' ... pass ... >>> baz = Bar() >>> baz <__main__.Bar object at 0x54f30> </source> Note that the <tt>Bar</tt> instance now resides at the memory location <tt>0x54f30</tt>; at the same place as where our previous object, the <tt>Foo</tt> instance, was located. Since the <tt>Foo</tt> instance was destroyed, freeing up the memory used to contain it, the interpreter creates the <tt>Bar</tt> object at the same memory location as before, making good use of the available resources. ==External links== * [[Benjamin C.

Gonnet''' is a [[Uruguay]]an [[computer scientist]] and entrepreneur. He is best known for his contributions to the [[Maple computer algebra system]] and the creation of an electronic version of the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]. == Education and professional life == Gonnet received his doctorate in computer science from the [[University of Waterloo]] in 1977. His thesis was entitled ''Interpolation and Interpolation Hash Searching''. His advisor was [[J. Alan George]]. In 1980 Gonnet co-founded the Symbolic Computation Group at the University of Waterloo. The work of SCG on a general-purpose [[computer algebra system]] later formed the core of the [[Maple (software)|Maple]] system. In 1988, Gonnet co-founded (with [[Keith Geddes]]) the private company [[Waterloo Maple]] Inc., to sell Maple commercially. In the mid 90's the company ran into trouble and a disagreement between his colleagues caused him to withdraw from managerial involvement. In 1984 Gonnet co-founded the New Oxford English Dictionary project at UW, which sought to create a searchable electronic version of the OED. This project later culminated in another successful commercial venture, the [[Open Text Corporation]]. Gonnet is presently a professor at [[ETH Zurich]] in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]]. == External links == * [http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/gonnet/ Personal page at ETH Zurich] * [http://history.siam.org/oralhistories/gonnet.htm Interview with Gaston Gonnet], SIAM History of Numerical Analysis and Computing, March 16, 2005 {{DEFAULTSORT:Gonnet, Gaston}} {{Uruguay-scientist-stub}} {{compu-scientist-stub}} [[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:Scientific computing researchers]] [[Category:Swiss computer scientists]] [[Category:University of Waterloo alumni]] [[Category:Uruguayan computer scientists]] [[Category:Uruguayan expatriates in Canada]] [[Category:Uruguayan expatriates in Switzerland]] [[Category:Uruguayan people of French descent]] [[Category:Place of birth missing (living people)]] [[pt:Gastón Gonnet]]</text> </page> <page> <id>14813</id> <title>Gastrobot</title> <text>'''Gastrobot''', meaning literally 'robot with stomach', was a term coined in 1998 by the University of South Florida Institute's director, Dr. Stuart Wilkinson. A gastrobot is "An intelligent machine (robot) that derives all its [[energy]] requirements from the digestion of real food". The Gastrobot's energy intake may come in the form of [[carbohydrates]], [[lipids]] etc., or may be a simpler source, such as [[alcohol]]. The energy source commonly used for this [[robot]] is a mixture of carbohydrates and protein. These molecules are obtained from food through a [[microbial fuel cell]] (MFC) which then converts the food into gases and other [[potential energy]]. The gases and liquids are used to help fuel things such as a [[hydrogen fuel cell]] which help create more energy, along with other gases that help power the [[mechanics]] of the gastrobot. The future of these robots supposedly is for certain types of so called 'start and forget' missions on an ecological plateau which would be Earth at the current period in time. Their optic sensors may have [[artificial intelligence]] [[software]] that allows them to determine what is edible for consumption and energy conversion. Possible future commercial uses would be a self powered lawnmower that would obtain energy for itself from the [[cellulose]] in the grass cuttings. ==See also== * [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] - a fictional robot from the year 3000 that 'lives' on common alcohol. ==External links== * [http://www.thegastrobots.co.uk] * [http://www.gastrobots.com/ Gastrobots.com] * [http://www.howstuffworks.com/news-item107.htm Chewchew the Gastrobot] * [http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/2000/D/200003032.html Article from New Scientist Magazine about Chew Chew] * [http://www.ias.uwe.ac.uk/energy-autonomy.htm Fly fed EcoBot] * [http://www.ias.uwe.ac.uk/Robots/slugbot.htm A robot that eats slugs] * [http://www.eng.usf.edu/~wilkinso/gastrobotics/gastrobots.PDF An Article on Gastrobots] | .PDF (258 KB) {{robo-stub}} [[Category:Ecological robots]]</text> </page> <page> <id>14819</id> <title>Gateway (computer program)</title> <text>{{distinguish|Gateway (telecommunications)|Router}} {{Unreferenced|date=March 2007}} A '''gateway''' is a link between two [[computer program]]s or systems such as [[Internet Forums]].
