as the problem presented by the task of creating rules able to combine words into well-formed (i.e., ''grammatical'') sentences. The rules used by these grammars were referred to as [[phrase-structure rule]]s (P-rules). It was soon apparent, however, that a generative component composed solely of P-rules could not generate a wide variety of commonly occurring sentence types. In response to this dilemma, we find Harris proposing an explanation: <blockquote> ''Some of the cruces in descriptive linguistics have been due to the search for a constituent analysis in sentence types where this does not exist'' '''because the sentences are transformationally derived from each other''' [boldface added]<ref>Harris, Zellig S. (1981). "Co-occurrence and transformation." In ''Papers in Syntax.'' Dordrecht: Reidel, 1 edition. ''Synthese language library,'' vol.14, Henry Hiz, ed.</ref></blockquote> Chomsky’s model of syntax - [[transformational grammar]] -picked up on this line of reasoning and added a supplementary set of transformations (T-rules). T-rules effected combinations and permutations of words in step-wise fashion to fill in structural gaps where P-rules alone could not generate the sentences which Harris had pointed out as problems. The structural forms generated by P-rules alone were said to constitute ‘[[deep structure]].’ ‘Surface structure’ was then derived transformationally by T-rules from the ‘kernel’ structures first generated by the operation of P-rules. In this way, Chomsky proposed to generate an infinite number of sentences using finite means (the closed sets of P-rules and T-rules). Syntax-based models of this vintage set [[semantics]] and [[phonology]] apart as linguistic processes to be approached separately. ==Action and Reaction== Given that [[meaning]] had long been considered to be at the heart of what [[linguistics]] is all about, not a few linguists viewed the exclusion of semantics from Chomsky’s model as a flaw. There followed a variety of proposals for altering Chomksy’s original design to include semantic phenomena in one way or another. Alterations receiving a hearing and press were, in the main, revisions proposed by students, associates, and supporters of Chomsky. Those denied a hearing as well as press soon countered by forming LACUS [http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~lacus/] (''The Linguistic Association of Canada and the United States'') under the leadership of Adam Makkai. LACUS organized annual forums and published its proceedings as a counter-balance to transformationalism and its exclusionary control of the most prestigious publishing outlet for linguists in the United States, namely,''The Linguistic Society of America'' and its journal, ''Language.'' ==Advent of Junction Grammar== Enter from the sidelines under these circumstances ''junction grammar'' (JG),<ref>Baird, Rey L. (1972) “Essentials of  Junction Grammar.”  ''LINGUISTICS SYMPOSIUM: AUTOMATIC LANGUAGE PROCESSING'', 30–31 March 1972. Provo, Utah : BYU Language Research Center. [http://www.junction-grammar.com/html/essentials.htm]</ref> a model of natural language created by Eldon Lytle in the late ‘60s and early ‘70s. Junction grammar did not propose an amendment to Chomsky’s model of syntax, but purported to eliminate the need for transformations altogether through theoretical innovation and a novel design for generative grammars. Innovations fundamental to the new approach rejected common-place reliance on existing mathematics and [[formal language]] theory as tools for linguistic modeling and description ''in deference to the intuition of more fundamental structuring in the body and in natural language itself'' which appeared to provide a ''universal base for linguistic description'' - not only for natural language but also for the synthetic notation systems employed at the time for linguistic description. Implementation of the novelties in question entailed: * Recasting the generative component in a semantic mold. This entailed dispensing with all 'operationally-deprived' (and hence ''meaningless''<ref>Junction theory held that a simple concatenation of operands in linguistic formulations was as 'meaningless' as any string of mathematical operands devoid of operators.</ref>) concatenations of P-rules and replacing them with ''junction rules'' (J-rules). J-rules operationalized for the first time a set of structural relations having universal syntacto-semantic significance and were based on the proposition that natural language ''has its own math''. Indeed, the position of JG was that lucubrations advanced by Chomsky and others as to whether this or that rung of a given formal language hierarchy was in principle capable of generating the sentences of natural language were ultimately circular, natural language being the womb which had mothered them all. Lytle held, in effect, that natural language is the ''meta-language'' upon which all forms of synthetic notation (including mathematics) supervene.<ref>Lytle, Eldon G. (1974) “A Summary Comparison of Junction Grammar and Transformational Grammar.” First published in ''LINGUISTICS SYMPOSIUM: AUTOMATED LANGUAGE PROCESSING'', 9 April 1974.

Provo, Utah : BYU Translation Sciences Institute [http://www.junction-grammar.com/html/a_summary_comparison_of_jg_and.htm]</ref> * Complementing the base with biologically-oriented ‘tracts’ (sometimes referred to in early JG literature as ''levels of representation'') specializing in the distinct data types required to support lexicalization, articulation, orthography, etc. Junction theory explicitly prohibited the intermingling of distinct data types in a single representation, noting, for example, that one could not reasonably expect the vocal tract to have use for 'semantic' data nor would the 'tract' executing movements in the writing hand have any use for data driving the musculature of the vocal tract. * Implementing Saussure’s concept of ''signified-signifier'' linkages<ref>De Saussure, Ferdinand. ''Course in General Linguistics.'' (1966) New York:McGraw-Hill Book Company, 2 edition.</ref> by constructing coding grammars to transpose the structuring of one tract to the data type of another, as for example the transposition of J-rule structuring into the lexical strings required for writing or articulation. The essence of the departure from Chomsky's model in this case was that ''coding'' between biologically grounded tracts supplanted ''interpretation'' of deep structure in the abstract. In sum, the junction grammar model of language (1) moved the base into a sub-verbal semantic domain, (2) added universally relevant linguistic operators to generation rules - thus, for example, solving the quandary of how to handle 'conjunction' - (3) incorporated auxiliary 'tracts' together with specialized data types for voice, audition, etc., and (4) added coding grammars to physically interface between tracts.
