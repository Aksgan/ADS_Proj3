connection to a [[VT100]]-compatible terminal. In this way the SRM console is similar to the [[Open Firmware]] used in [[SPARC]] and [[Apple Computer|Apple]] [[PowerMac]] computers, for example. Upon system initialization, an Alpha AXP computer set to boot from the SRM console displays a short report of the software version of the firmware, and presents a prompt consisting of a series of brackets: Digital Personal WorkStation 433u Console V7.2-1 Mar 6 2000 14:47:02 >>> Several commands are available by typing them at the prompt, and a list of possible commands is available by entering the command <code>help</code> or <code>man</code> at the prompt. Various system variables for establishing automatic boot settings, parameter strings to be passed to an operating system and the like may also be set from the SRM prompt. The SRM firmware contains drivers for booting from boot media including SCSI hard disks and CD-ROM drives attached to a supported SCSI adapter, various IDE ATA and ATAPI devices, and network booting via [[BOOTP]] or [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]] is possible with supported network adapters. When an appropriate disk boot device is available, the SRM console locates and loads the target primary bootstrap image using information written in the target disk boot block; in logical block zero. The boot block contains the disk location and block size of the target primary bootstrap image file, and SRM will load that into memory and will then transfer control to it. ==References== {{Empty section|date=July 2010}} == External links == * [http://web.archive.org/web/20050408134334/http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-7-Manual/alpha-install-guide/s1-alpha-srm.html Red Hat Documentation: The SRM Firmware Console] * [http://h18002.www1.hp.com/alphaserver/download/srm_reference.pdf SRM Console Reference] * [http://h18002.www1.hp.com/alphaserver/technology/literature/srmcons.pdf Alpha SRM Console for Alpha Microprocessor Motherboards User’s Guide] * [http://www.alphalinux.org/faq/x31.html What is SRM?] * [http://www.faqs.org/docs/Linux-HOWTO/SRM-HOWTO.html SRM Firmware Howto] [[Category:Digital Equipment Corporation|SRM]] [[Category:Firmware]] [[Category:OpenVMS]] [[de:System Reference Manual]] [[ru:Микропрограмма SRM]]</text> </page> <page> <id>36495</id> <title>System Service Dispatch Table</title> <text>The '''System Service Dispatch Table''' ('''SSDT''') is an internal [[dispatch table]] within [[Microsoft Windows]].

It was developed by John Brooke <ref>{{cite book| author = Brooke, J. | year = 1996| chapter= SUS: a "quick and dirty" usability scale | editors =P. W. Jordan, B. Thomas, B. A. Weerdmeester, & A. L. McClelland | title=Usability Evaluation in Industry | publisher = London: Taylor and Francis| url = http://www.usabilitynet.org/trump/documents/Suschapt.doc }}</ref> at [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1986 as a tool to be used in [[usability engineering]] of [[electronic office]] systems. The usability of a system, as defined by the ISO standard [[ISO 9241]] Part 11, can be measured only by taking into account the context of use of the system — i.e., who is using the system, what they are using it for, and the environment in which they are using it. Furthermore, measurements of usability have several different aspects: * effectiveness (can users successfully achieve their objectives) * efficiency (how much effort and resource is expended in achieving those objectives) * satisfaction (was the experience satisfactory) Measures of effectiveness and efficiency are also context specific. Effectiveness in using a system for controlling a continuous industrial process would generally be measured in very different terms to, say, effectiveness in using a text editor. Thus, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to answer the question “is system A more usable than system B”, because the measures of effectiveness and efficiency may be very different. However, it can be argued that given a sufficiently high-level definition of ''subjective'' assessments of usability, comparisons can be made between systems. SUS has generally been seen as providing this type of high-level subjective view of usability and is thus often used in carrying out comparisons of usability between systems. Because it yields a single score on a scale of 0–100, it can be used to compare even systems that are outwardly dissimilar. This one-dimensional aspect of the SUS is both a benefit and a drawback, because the questionnaire is necessarily quite general. Recently, Lewis and Sauro <ref>{{cite book| author = Lewis, J.R. & Sauro, J. | year = 2009 | title = The factor structure of the system usability scale | publisher = international conference (HCII 2009), San Diego CA, USA}}</ref> suggested a two-factor orthogonal structure, which practitioners may use to score the SUS on independent Usability and Learnability dimensions. At the same time, Borsci, Federici and Lauriola <ref>{{cite journal |author = Borsci, S., Federici,S., & Lauriola, M. | year = 2009 | title = On the dimensionality of the System Usability Scale: a test of alternative measurement models | journal = Cognitive processing | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 193–197 | doi = 10.1007/s10339-009-0268-9}} </ref> by an independent analysis confirm the two factors structure of SUS, also showing that those factors (Usability and Learnability) are correlated. The SUS has been widely used in the evaluation of a range of systems. Bangor, Kortum and Miller <ref>{{cite journal | author = Bangor, Aaron, Kortum, Philip T. and Miller, James T. | year= 2008 | title= An Empirical Evaluation of the System Usability Scale | journal = International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction | volume = 24 | issue = 6 | pages = 574 — 594}}</ref> have used the scale extensively over a ten year period and have produced normative data that allow SUS ratings to be positioned relative to other systems. They propose an extension to SUS to provide an adjective rating that correlates with a given score. ==References== {{reflist}} == Further reading == * Tullis, T.S., and Stetson, J.N. A Comparison of
