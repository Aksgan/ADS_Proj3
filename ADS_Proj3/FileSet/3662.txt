Quantum computers only run [[Probabilistic algorithm|probabilistic]] algorithms, so BQP on quantum computers is the counterpart of [[BPP]] ("bounded error, probabilistic, polynomial time") on classical computers. It is defined as the set of problems solvable with a polynomial-time algorithm, whose probability of error is bounded away from one half.<ref>Nielsen, p. 41</ref> A quantum computer is said to "solve" a problem if, for every instance, its answer will be right with high probability. If that solution runs in polynomial time, then that problem is in BQP. BQP is contained in the complexity class ''[[Sharp-P|#P]]'' (or more precisely in the associated class of decision problems ''P<sup>#P</sup>''),<ref name=BernVazi>{{cite journal|last1=Bernstein|first1=Ethan|last2=Vazirani|first2=Umesh|doi=10.1137/S0097539796300921|title=Quantum Complexity Theory|year=1997|pages=1411|volume=26|journal=SIAM Journal on Computing|url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/bv.ps}}</ref> which is a subclass of [[PSPACE]]. BQP is suspected to be disjoint from [[NP-complete]] and a strict superset of [[P (complexity)|P]], but that is not known. Both [[integer factorization]] and [[discrete logarithm problem|discrete log]] are in BQP. Both of these problems are NP problems suspected to be outside BPP, and hence outside P. Both are suspected to not be NP-complete. There is a common misconception that quantum computers can solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time. That is not known to be true, and is generally suspected to be false.<ref name=BernVazi/> Possibilities of the quantum computer to accelerate classical algorithms has rigid limits - lower bounds of quantum computations complexity. The overwhelming part of classical calculations can't be accelerated on the quantum computer.<ref name=Ozhigov1>{{cite journal|last1=Ozhigov|first1=Yuri|title=Quantum Computers Speed Up Classical with Probability Zero |year=1999|pages=1707–1714 |volume=10|journal=Chaos Solitons Fractals|url=http://xxx.lanl.gov/PS_cache/quant-ph/pdf/9803/9803064v1.pdf}}</ref> The similar fact takes place for particular computational tasks, like search problem, for which Grover alrgithm is optimal.<ref name=Ozhigov2>{{cite journal|last1=Ozhigov|first1=Yuri|title=Lower Bounds of Quantum Search for Extreme Point |year=1999|pages=2165–2172 |volume=A455|journal=Proc.Roy.Soc.Lond.|url=http://xxx.lanl.gov/PS_cache/quant-ph/pdf/9806/9806001v3.pdf}}</ref> Although quantum computers may be faster than classical computers, those described above can't solve any problems that classical computers can't solve, given enough time and memory (however, those amounts might be practically infeasible). A [[Turing machine]] can simulate <!-- add mention about [[Quantum Virtual Machines]] which can simulate quantum computer on classical one -->these quantum computers, so such a quantum computer could never solve an [[undecidable problem]] like the [[halting problem]]. The existence of "standard" quantum computers does not disprove the [[Church–Turing thesis]].<ref>Nielsen, p. 126</ref> It has been speculated that theories of [[quantum gravity]], such as [[M-theory]] or [[loop quantum gravity]], may allow even faster computers to be built. Currently, it's an open problem to even ''define'' computation in such theories due to the ''problem of time'', i.e. there's no obvious way to describe what it means for an observer to submit input to a computer and later receive output.<ref>[[Scott Aaronson]], ''[http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0502072 NP-complete Problems and Physical Reality]'', ACM [[SIGACT]] News, Vol. 36, No. 1. (March 2005), pp. 30-52, section 7 "Quantum Gravity": "[...] to anyone who wants a test or benchmark for a favorite quantum gravity theory,[author's footnote: That is, one without all the bother of making numerical predictions and comparing them to observation] let me humbly propose the following: ''can you define Quantum Gravity Polynomial-Time?'' [...] until we can say what it means for a ‘user’ to specify an ‘input’ and ‘later’ receive an ‘output’—''there is no such thing as computation, not even theoretically.''"
