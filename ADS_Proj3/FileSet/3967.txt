accomplishments ("paint a picture") are seen as durative, while semelfactives and achievements (e.g. "recognize") are punctual. Like achievements and accomplishments, semelfactives are viewed as [[telic]], i.e. having a fixed end point. ==References== {{reflist}} Semelfactives, as a lexical aspect, is proposed by Carlotta S. Smith in 1991. According to Smith, semelfactives are instantaneous atelic events, e.g. [knock], [cough]. Atelic refers to those processes which are seen not having a natural completion.

A sememe is a proposed unit of transmitted or intended meaning; it is atomic or indivisible. A sememe can be the meaning expressed by a morpheme, such as the English pluralizing morpheme ''-s'', which carries the sememic feature [+ plural]. Alternately, a single sememe (for example [go] or [move]) can be conceived as the abstract representation of such verbs as ''skate, roll, jump, slide, turn,'' or ''boogie''. It can be thought of as the semantic counterpart to any of the following: a [[meme]] in a culture, a [[gene]] in a genetic make-up, or an [[atom]] (or, more specifically, an [[elementary particle]]) in a substance. A [[Seme (semantics)|seme]] is the smallest unit of meaning recognized in semantics, referring to a single characteristic of a sememe. There are five types of sememes: two [[denotation]]al and three [[connotation]]al, with connotational occurring only in phrase units (they do not reflect the [[Denotation (semiotics)|denotation]]):<ref>[http://www.krsu.edu.kg/vestnik/2003/v2/a04.html Pragmatic and syntagmatic aspects of phraseology, Krassnoff (in russian)]</ref> # Denotational 1: Primary denotation, for example "head" (body); # Denotational 2: Secondary denotation by resemblance with other denotation: "head" (ship); # Connotational 1: High position, as the role or function of "head" in the operation of the human body; # Connotational 2: Emotive, e.g., meaning in "honey"; # Connotational 3: Evaluative, e.g., meaning in "sneak" – move silently and secretly for a bad purpose <!--- A '''Sememe''' is a proposed unit of transmitted or intended meaning; it is atomic or indivisible.

Examples of semiconductor memory include [[non-volatile memory]] such as [[Read-only memory]] (ROM), [[magnetoresistive random access memory]] (MRAM), and [[flash memory]]. It also includes [[volatile memory]] such as [[static random access memory]] (SRAM), which relies on several [[transistors]] forming a digital [[flip-flop]] to store one bit, and [[dynamic random access memory]] (DRAM), which uses one [[capacitor]] and one transistor to store each [[bit]]s. [[Shift register]]s, [[processor register]]s, [[data buffer]]s and other small digital registers that have no [[address decoder|memory address decoding mechanism]] are not considered as memory. Data is accessed by means of a binary [[memory address]] to the memory. If the memory address consists of ''M'' bits, the address area consists of two raised by ''M'' addresses per chip. Semiconductor memory are manufactured with a certain [[word length]] (number of 1-bit cells sharing the same memory address) that power of two, typically ''M''=1, 2, 4 or 8 bit per chip. Consequently, the amount of data stored in each chip is <math>MN^2</math> bits. Possible figures are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512 [[bit]], [[kbit]], [[Mbit]], [[Gbit]] and [[Tbit]], here defined by [[binary prefix]]es. By combining several integrated circuits, memory can be arranged for a larger word length and/or address space than what is offered by each chip, often but not necessarily a [[power of two]]. {{DEFAULTSORT:Semiconductor Memory}} [[Category:Digital electronics]] [[Category:Computer memory]] [[Category:Integrated circuits]] {{Compu-storage-stub}} [[ko:반도체 메모리]] [[ja:半導体メモリ]] [[pl:Pamięć półprzewodnikowa]] [[sk:Polovodičová pamäť]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33869</id> <title>Semidefinite embedding</title> <text>{{Cleanup-jargon|date=June 2007}} '''Semidefinite embedding''' (SDE) or '''maximum variance unfolding (MVU)''' is an [[algorithm]] in [[computer science]], that uses [[semidefinite programming]] to perform [[non-linear dimensionality reduction]] of high-dimensional [[coordinate vector|vector]]ial input data.
