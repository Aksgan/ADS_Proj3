The subsystem included, called [[Interix]], was acquired by Microsoft in 1999 from US-based Softway Systems as part of an asset acquisition.<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/1999/sept99/softwaypr.mspx Microsoft Acquires Softway Systems to Strengthen Future Customer Interoperability Solutions, Sep 17, 1999, Press Release, Microsoft Corporation</ref>. These are available free from Microsoft as a download (in the case of SFU) or as part of the Windows OS distribution (in the case of SUA). Like the [[Microsoft POSIX subsystem]] in Windows NT that it replaces, [[Interix]] is not an emulation of a Unix [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]], but rather an implementation of a [[user-mode]] subsystem running directly on top of the [[Architecture of Windows NT|Windows NT kernel]]. Windows Services for Unix and Subsystem for Unix-based Applications provide header files and libraries that make it easier to recompile or port Unix applications for use on Windows; they do not make Unix binaries compatible with Windows binaries. It is best thought of as a distinct [[Unix-like]] platform. ==Overview== The current version of SFU contains: * Over 350 [[Unix]] utilities such as [[vi]], [[Korn shell|ksh]], [[C shell|csh]], [[ls]], [[Cat (Unix)|cat]], [[awk]], [[grep]], [[Kill (Unix)|kill]], etc. * [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] 3.3 compiler, includes and libraries (through an MS libc) * A cc-like wrapper {{Clarify|cc?|date=September 2010}} for [[Microsoft Visual Studio]] command-line C/C++ compiler * [[GNU Debugger|GDB]] debugger * [[Perl]] * [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]] server and client * A pcnfsd {{Clarify|date=September 2010}} daemon * [[X Window system|X11]] tools and libraries * Tools for making NFS mount-points appear as Windows shares, and vice-versa (''gateway'' services) * An [[Network Information Service|NIS]] server capability linked with Active Directory (AD) * Some Windows/Unix authentication information-synchronization tools ABC SFU does not contain the following (but binaries are available for separate installation<ref name = "Interop">[http://www.suacommunity.com/tool_warehouse.htm Tool Warehouse for Interix, SFU & Subsystem for Unix-based Applications (SUA)], Interop Community</ref>): * [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]], [[OpenSSH]], [[sudo]], [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]], [[ClamAV]], [[bzip2]], [[gmake]], [[CURL|curl]], [[emacs]], [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]], [[XView]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Tcl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]] Although SFU includes [[X Window System]] client libraries and applications, it does not contain a native X server. Any of the numerous third-party Windows X servers can be used. Fully-featured free alternatives include [[Cygwin/X]], [[Xming]], [http://www.tam.cornell.edu/Computer.old/remoteaccess/weirdmind/ WeirdMind] and [[WeirdX]]. ==Releases== === SFU 1.0 === Microsoft produced at least one beta release of the initial version of SFU before its final release in February 1999. This release, in [[English language|English]] only, was supported on the [[Windows NT 4.0]] SP3+ for [[x86 architecture|x86]] and [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] platforms. This is the only known release to support Alpha. It included a demonstration version of the [[MKS Toolkit]] along with the following components: * [[TELNET|Telnet]] server * Telnet client * UNIX Utilities (from [[MKS Inc.|MKS]]) * Client for [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]] * Server for NFS * Server for NFS Authentication * Windows NT to UNIX password-synchronization * Help files and documentation ===SFU 2.0=== This second installment of SFU was released April 2000 and was also for English; however, a [[Japanese-language]] release appeared just two months later in June 2000. Both ran on Windows NT 4.0 SP4+ and [[Windows 2000]] on x86 platforms with [[Internet Explorer]] 4.01+. SFU 2.0 supported the following UNIX versions: [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] 2.6+, [[HP-UX]] 10.2+, [[IBM AIX (operating system)|AIX]] 4.2+, [[Tru64 UNIX]] 5.0+, and [[Red Hat Linux]] 5.1+. It included the following components: * Server for [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]] (NFSServer) * Client for NFS (NFSClient) * Gateway for NFS (NFSGateway) * Server for PCNFS (Pcnfsd) * User Name Mapping (Mapsvc) * Server for NFS Authentication (NFSServerAuth) * Server for [[Network Information Service|NIS]] (NIS) * [[TELNET|Telnet]] Client (TelnetClient) * Telnet server (TelnetServer) * Password synchronization (PasswdSync) * [[ActiveState]] ActivePerl (Perl) * UNIX utilities (UnixUtilities) * [[Cron]] service (CronSvc) * [[Remote Shell|Rsh]] service (RshSvc) ===SFU 3.0=== This version, released in May 2002, was the first release to include the [[Interix]] subsystem. Previously Microsoft had released Interix 2.2 (actually version 2.2.5) as a separate product around the same time frame as SFU 2.0. This SFU release included Interix release 3.0 (commonly called the "version" as reported by '''uname -r''') with an internal Microsoft version of 7.0 that relates to internal build sequences. This Interix release contained significant technical extensions from the Interix 2.2 release such as a rooted file system and setuid functionality that were entirely based on the Softway Systems' [[Interix]] development codenamed "Firebrand". This was also released in English and followed by a later release in Japanese in October 2002, adding [[Internationalization and localization|internationalization]] support. Both supported Windows NT 4.0 SP6a+, Windows 2000, and [[Windows XP]] Professional on x86 platforms with Internet Explorer 5.0+. The MKS Toolkit was no longer included. It included the following components: * Base Utilities for Interix (BaseUtils; including [[X Window System|X11R5]] utilities) * UNIX Perl for Interix (UNIXPerl) * Interix SDK (InterixSDK; including headers and libraries for development and a wrapper for [[Microsoft Visual Studio|Visual Studio]]
