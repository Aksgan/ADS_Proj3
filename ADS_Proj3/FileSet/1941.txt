and that the transition to Intel processor systems would last until the end of 2007. Rumors of cross-platform compatibility had been spurred by the fact that Mac OS X is based on [[OPENSTEP]], an operating system that was available for many platforms. In fact, Apple's own [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]], the [[open source]] underpinnings of Mac OS X, was also available for Intel's x86 architecture.<ref>{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= June 6, 2005 |url=http://news.com.com/Apple+shakes+hands+with+Intel/2009-1006_3-5733319.html |title= Apple shakes hands with Intel|work= |pages= |publisher= [[News.com]]|accessdate=2006-05-04 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= June 6, 2005|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=1112 |title= Apple confirms switch to Intel|format= |work= |pages= |publisher= [[AppleInsider]] |accessdate=2006-05-04 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Markoff |first= John|authorlink= John Markoff|coauthors= Steve Lohr |date=June 6, 2005 |url= http://nytimes.com/2005/06/06/technology/06apple.html |title= Apple Plans to Switch From I.B.M. to Intel Chips|work= |pages= |publisher= [[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2006-05-04 }}</ref> On January 10, 2006, the first Intel-based machines, the [[iMac]] and [[MacBook Pro]], were introduced.<ref>{{cite press release |title = Apple Unveils New iMac with Intel Core Duo Processor |publisher = [[Apple Inc.]] |date = 2006-01-10 |url = http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/jan/10imac.html |accessdate = 2006-09-06 }}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |title = Apple Introduces MacBook Pro |publisher = [[Apple Inc.]] |date = 2006-01-10 |url = http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/jan/10macbookpro.html |accessdate = 2006-09-06}}</ref> They were based on the [[Intel Core|Intel Core Duo]] platform. This introduction came with the news that Apple will complete the transition to Intel processors on all hardware by the end of 2006, a year ahead of the originally quoted schedule. In January 2007, Apple Computer, Inc. shortened its name to simply Apple Inc. In his Keynote address, Jobs explained that with their current product mix consisting of the iPod and Apple TV as well as their Macintosh brand, Apple really wasn't just a computer company anymore. At the same address, Jobs revealed a product that would revolutionize an industry in which Apple had never previously competed: the Apple iPhone. The iPhone combined Apple's first widescreen iPod with the world's first mobile device boasting visual voicemail, and an internet communicator capable of running a fully functional version of Apple's web browser Safari on the [[iPhone OS]]. ===Apple and "i" Web services=== In 2000, Apple introduced its iTools service, a collection of free web-based tools that included an email account, internet greeting cards called iCards, a service called [[iReview]] that gave internet users a place to read and write reviews of Web sites, and a tool called [[KidSafe]] which promised to prevent children from browsing inappropriate portions of the [[world wide web|web]]. The latter two services were eventually canceled because of lack of success, while iCards and email became integrated into Apple's [[.Mac]] subscription based service introduced in 2002 and discontinued in mid-2008 to make way for the release of the new MobileMe service, coinciding with the iPhone 3G release. MobileMe, which carries the same US$99.00 annual subscription price as its .Mac predecessor, features the addition of "push" services to instantly and automatically send emails, contacts and calendar updates directly to user's iPhone devices. Some controversy surrounded the release of MobileMe services to users resulting in expected downtime and a significantly longer release window. As a result of this, Apple extended the subscriptions existing MobileMe subscribers by an additional 30 days free-of-charge.<ref>[http://www.macrumors.com/2008/07/16/apple-sends-apology-letter-30-day-extension-to-mobileme-customers Apple Sends Apology Letter, 30-Day Extension to MobileMe Customers]</ref> ===iPod and iTunes Store=== {{Main|iPod|iTunes Store}} [[Image:IPod 2G.jpg|right|thumb|A 2nd generation iPod]] [[Image:IPod mini.png|right|thumb|iPod mini with the user interface set to German]] On October 23, 2001, Apple introduced the iPod, a portable digital music player. Its signature features included an [[LCD]], easy to use interface, and a large capacity drive (initially 5 GB) which was enough to hold approximately 1,000 songs. It was quite large when compared to the 20-30 songs of [[Flash memory|Flash]]-based players of the time. Apple has since revised its iPod line several times, introducing a slimmer, more compact design, Windows compatibility (previous iPods only interacted with Macintosh computers), [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] compatibility, storage sizes of up to 160 GB, and easier connectivity with car or home stereo systems. On October 26, 2004, Apple released a color version of their award winning iPod which can not only play music but also show photos. In early 2005, Apple unveiled a smaller iPod : the [[iPod Shuffle]], which is about the size of a pack of gum. Speaking to software developers on June 6, 2005, Steve Jobs said the company's share of the entire portable music device market stood at 76%.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Apple has revolutionized the computer and music industry by signing the five major record companies to join its new music download service, the successful iTunes Music Store, now known as [[iTunes Store]]. Unlike other fee-based music services, the iTunes Store charges a flat US$0.99 per song (or US$9.99 per album). Users have more flexibility than on previous on-line music services. For example, they can burn CDs including the purchased songs (although a particular playlist containing purchased music may only be burned seven times), share and play the songs on up to five computers, and, of course, download songs onto an iPod. The iTunes Music Store commercial model is one-time purchase, which contrasts with other commercial subscription music services where users are required to pay a regular fee to be able to access musical content (but are able to access a larger volume of music during the subscription). The iTunes Music Store was launched in 2003 with 2 million downloads in only 16 days; all of which were purchased only on Macintosh computers. Apple has since released a version of [[iTunes]] for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], allowing Windows users the ability to access the store as well. Initially, the music store was only available in the [[United States]] due to licensing restrictions, but there were plans to release the store to many other countries in the future. In January 2004 Apple released a more compact version of their iPod player, the 4 GB [[iPod Mini]]. Although the Mini held fewer songs than the other iPod models at that time, its smaller size and multiple colours made it popular with consumers on debut with many stores
