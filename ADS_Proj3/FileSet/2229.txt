to generate local as well as international support for the terrorists. In some cases, the terrorists choose to distribute information displaying their acts of violence or relating actions although this is not common. Again, these can be through written articles describing the violence, but are more often videos and pictures. Examples of these would be the pre-mission pictures published on the [[Tamil Tigers]] website of the Air Tiger squadron that a few days earlier had carried out its successful inaugural air attack on Sri Lankan governmental forces. A rather more extreme example was the distribution of the beheading of the journalist [[Daniel Pearl]] by the terrorist organisation ‘The National Movement for the Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty’. ===Data Mining=== The Internet is a vast resource of information which anyone can tap into and terrorists are well aware of this. According to Secretary of Defence [[Donald Rumsfeld]], speaking on January 15, 2003, an al Qaeda training manual recovered in Afghanistan tells its readers that: <blockquote> “Using public sources openly and without resorting to illegal means, it is possible to gather at least 80 percent of all information required about the enemy.”<ref>Weimann 2004: 7</ref> </blockquote> The Internet allows access to highly detailed maps, schematics and various other sources of data that would allow terrorists gather information for potential targets. More importantly, once this data has been collated, it is compiled into volumes or “How to” manuals that are distributed between terrorist organisations <ref>http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/manualpart1_1.pdf</ref> - see section entitled Networking. ===Fund Raising=== Terrorist groups have made full use of the Internet’s ability to create funds; whether legitimately or otherwise. The main methods that the terrorists achieve this is by: Goods selling: merchandise that is directly related to the terrorist organisation, for example, CDs, DVDs and books from the LTTE.<ref name="www.eelamstore.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.eelamstore.com/ |title=www.eelamstore.com |publisher=www.eelamstore.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-13}}</ref> Website and email based appeals: sending emails to sympathizers who registered interest on a group’s website, posting messages on newsgroups/forums and their own websites that give directions as to how and where donations can be made. Deception: using seemingly legitimate charities or businesses that unknown to the donator, directs the funds to terrorist organisations.<ref name="Gruen 2003: 298">Gruen 2003: 298</ref> Criminal activity: Illegitimate means of gaining funds that terrorist groups are known to use include credit card fraud, online brokering and gambling.<ref name="www.eelamstore.com"/><ref name="Gruen 2003: 298"/> ===Recruitment=== This section is inherently tied-in with Propaganda. Terrorist organisations are able to monitor users who browse their websites, capture their profile and information about them and if deemed possibly useful to their cause, are contacted. This grooming process starts from when the user begins to absorb the propaganda on the website, for example the often discussed “charismatic” style of delivery that [[Osama Bin Laden]] employs on his video messages.<ref name="technologyreview1">{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/14150/page1/ |title=Terror's Server |publisher=Technology Review |date= |accessdate=2009-12-13}}</ref> Perhaps motivated by this video, the user seeks answers to questions and goes to internet chat-rooms and discussion boards. Possible recruits are spotted by lurking recruiters who through gradual encouragement of discussion of religious issues to gradually including more political discussions. This grooming leads the recruits to become more and more entangled in terrorist related discussions and are led through a maze of private chat-room’s until personal indoctrination occurs which is often through the use of the secure software [[Paltalk]].<ref name="technologyreview1"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/03/02/60minutes/main2531546.shtml |title=Terrorists Take Recruitment Efforts Online - 60 Minutes |publisher=CBS News |date=2007-03-04 |accessdate=2009-12-13}}</ref> ===Communication & Networking=== Terrorist groups have changed recently from having a clearly defined hierarchy in the organisations with designated leaders, to having multiple, semi-independent cells with no clear distinct leader in order to allow them to remain hidden. The Internet facilitates communication between cells which allows exchange of information and manuals. The Internet also assists with internal communication within a cell particularly in relation to the planning of attacks. To avoid being detected and targeted by security forces, Messages are often sent by conspirators through emails which are often sent using public email systems such as Hotmail and Yahoo and may also be sent from public libraries and internet cafes. Chat rooms may also be used for this purpose. In addition, steganography may be used to hide information embedded within graphic files on websites. Graphic files may also used to send very subtle messages, such as reversing the orientation of a gun graphic may indicate that the next stage of a plan is to proceed. Other methods of concealing instructions and messages may be through the use of coded language, such as that used by [[Mohamed Atta]]'s final email to the other terrorists who carried out the attacks of 9/11 is reported to have read: <blockquote> The semester begins in three more weeks. We’ve obtained 19 confirmations for studies in the faculty of law, the faculty of urban planning, the faculty of fine arts, and the faculty of engineering. <ref name="Weimann 2004: 12"/></blockquote> This is believed to be in reference to the four targets that the planes were planned to strike; ’architecture’ being the World Trade Center, ‘arts’: the Pentagon, ‘law’: the Capitol and ‘politics’: the White House. An even more secure method of communication is that which involves using one-time anonymous public email accounts; two terrorists who wish to communicate to open 30 anonymous email accounts whose usernames and passwords are known by each side. To communicate, one terrorist creates a web-based email and instead of sending it, saves it as a draft online. The “recipient” then logs onto this account, reads this message and deletes. The next day, a new account is used; this increases the difficulty of traceability of the users.<ref>http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/en/itac/itacdocs/2006-2.asp</ref> === The audiences of the terrorist websites=== The first group of people that will frequent these websites are current supporters and future supporters. The websites typically include information relative to their activities, their allies, and their competitors. In addition, many websites offer items for sale. The second group of people that will enter these websites will be members of the outside community. In hopes of appealing to people all over the world, many terrorist organizations offer their websites in
