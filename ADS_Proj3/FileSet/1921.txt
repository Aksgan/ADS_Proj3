be written against Hibernate's data objects. ''Criteria Queries'' are provided as an [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] alternative to HQL. ==Integration== Hibernate can be used both in [[Stand-alone|standalone]] [[Java (programming language)|Java]] applications and in [[Java EE]] applications using [[Java Servlet|servlets]] or [[EJB]] session beans. It can also be included as a feature in other programming languages. For example, [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] integrated Hibernate into version 9 of [[ColdFusion]] (which runs on J2EE app servers) with an abstraction layer of new functions and syntax added into [[CFML]]. ==Entities and components== In Hibernate [[jargon]], an ''entity'' is a stand-alone object in Hibernate's [[Persistence (computer science)|persistent]] mechanism which can be manipulated independently of other objects. In contrast, a ''component'' is subordinate to other entities and can be manipulated only with respect to other entities. For example, an Album object may represent an entity but the Tracks object associated with the Album objects would represent a ''component'' of the Album entity if it is assumed that Tracks can only be saved or retrieved from the database through the Album object. == History == Hibernate was started in 2001 by Gavin King as an alternative to using EJB2-style entity beans. Its mission back then was to simply offer better persistence capabilities than offered by EJB2 by simplifying the complexities and allowing for missing features. Early in 2003, the Hibernate development team began Hibernate2 releases which offered many significant improvements over the first release and would go on to catapult Hibernate as the "de facto" standard for persistence in Java. [[JBoss (company)|JBoss, Inc.]] (now part of [[Red Hat]]) later hired the lead Hibernate developers and worked with them in supporting Hibernate. {{As of | 2010}} the current version of Hibernate is Version 3.x. This version introduced new features like a new Interceptor/Callback architecture, user defined filters, and JDK 5.0 [[Java annotation|Annotations]] (Java's [[metadata]] feature). {{As of | 2010}} Hibernate 3 (version 3.5.0 and up) is a certified implementation of the [[Java Persistence API#JPA_2.0|Java Persistence API 2.0]] specification via a wrapper for the Core module which provides conformity with the [http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=317 JSR 317] standard.<ref>and POJO.[http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/Hibernate350FinalRelease Hibernate 3.5.0-Final release]</ref> == Application programming interface == The Hibernate API is provided in the [[Java package]] [http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/core/api/index.html?overview-summary.html org.hibernate]. === [http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/core/api/index.html?org/hibernate/SessionFactory.html org.hibernate.SessionFactory] interface === References immutable and threadsafe object creating new Hibernate sessions. Hibernate-based applications are usually designed to make use only of a single instance of the class implementing this interface (often exposed using a [[singleton pattern|singleton design pattern]]). === [http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/core/api/index.html?org/hibernate/Session.html org.hibernate.Session] interface === Represents a Hibernate session i.e. the main point of the manipulation performed on the database entities. The latter activities include (among the other things) managing the persistence state (transient, persisted, detached) of the objects, fetching the persisted ones from the database and the management of the transaction demarcation. A session is intended to last as long as the logical transaction on the database. Due to the latter feature Session implementations are not expected to be threadsafe nor to be used by multiple clients. == See also == {{Portal box|Free Software|Java}} * [[JBoss (disambiguation)]], other JBoss software * [[pureQuery]] * [[EJB]] 3.0 * [[NHibernate]] * [[Serialization]] * [[MyBatis]] * [[iBATIS]] * [[Service Data Object]] * [[QuickDB ORM]] * [[List of object-relational mapping software]] ==References== <references/> ==Bibliography== {{Refbegin}} *{{citation | first1 = Jeff | last1 = Linwood | first2 = Dave | last2 = Minter | date = May 28, 2010 | title = Beginning Hibernate | edition = Second | publisher = [[Apress]] | pages = 400 | isbn = 1430228504 | url = http://www.apress.com/book/view/9781430228509 }} *{{citation | first1 = Emmanuel | last1 = Bernard | first2 = John | last2 = Griffin | date = December 30, 2008 | title = Hibernate Search in Action | edition = First | publisher = [[Manning Publications]] | pages = 488 | isbn = 1933988649 | url = http://www.manning.com/bernard/ }} *{{citation | first1 = James | last1 = Elliott | first2 = Tim | last2 = O'Brien | date = April 22, 2008 | title = Harnessing Hibernate | edition = First | publisher = [[O'Reilly Media]] | pages = 380 | isbn = 0596517726 | url = http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596517724/ }} *{{citation | first1 = Gavin | last1 = King | first2 = Bauer | last2 = Christian | date = November 24, 2006 | title = Java Persistence with Hibernate | edition = Second | publisher = [[Manning Publications]] | pages = 880 | isbn = 1932394885 | url = http://www.manning.com/bauer2/ }} *{{citation | first1 = Jeff | last1 = Linwood | first2 = Dave | last2 = Minter | date = August 25, 2006 | title = Beginning Hibernate: From Novice to Professional | edition = Third | publisher = [[Apress]] | pages = 360 | isbn = 1590596935 | url = http://www.apress.com/book/view/9781590596937 }} *{{citation | first1 = Dave | last1 = Minter | first2 = Jeff | last2 = Linwood | date = June 27, 2005 | title = Pro Hibernate 3 | edition = First | publisher = [[Apress]] | pages = 242 | isbn = 1590595114 | url = http://www.apress.com/book/view/1590595114 }} *{{citation | first = Will | last = Iverson | date = December 2, 2004 | title = Hibernate: A J2EE Developer's Guide | edition = First | publisher = [[Addison Wesley]] | pages = 384 | isbn = 0321268199 | url = http://www.manning.com/bauer/ }} *{{citation | first1 = Eric | last1 = Pugh | first2 = Joseph D. | last2 = Gradecki | date = October 8, 2004 | title = Professional Hibernate (Programmer to Programmer) | edition = First | publisher = [[Wrox]] | pages = 456 | isbn = 0764576771 | url = http://p2p.wrox.com/book-professional-hibernate-148/ }} *{{citation | first1 = Gavin | last1 = King | first2 = Bauer | last2 = Christian | date = August 1, 2004 | title = Hibernate In Action | edition = Second | publisher = [[Manning Publications]] | pages = 400 | isbn = 193239415X | url = http://www.manning.com/bauer/ }} *{{citation | first = Elliott | last = James |
