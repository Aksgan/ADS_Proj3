Various spoofs still exist today, although they have developed considerably. {{DEFAULTSORT:Craft Access System}} [[Category:Telephony]] {{Technology-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>8347</id> <title>Cranfield Experiments</title> <text>{{Context|date=October 2009}} The Cranfield experiments were experiments conducted by [[Cyril W.

The C90 was a development of the [[Cray Y-MP]] architecture. Compared to the Y-MP, the C90 processor had a dual vector pipeline and a faster 4.1 ns clock cycle (244 MHz), which together gave three times the performance of the Y-MP processor. The maximum number of processors in a system was also doubled from eight to 16. The C90 series used the same Model E IOS (Input/Output Subsystem) and [[UNICOS]] [[operating system]] as the earlier Y-MP Model E. The C90 series included the '''C94''', '''C98''' and '''C916''' models (configurations with a maximum of four, eight, and 16 processor respectively) and the '''C92A''' and '''C94A''' (air-cooled models). Maximum [[static RAM|SRAM]] memory was between 1 and 8 GB, depending on model. The '''D92''', '''D92A''', '''D94''' and '''D98''' (also known as the '''C92D''', '''C92AD''', '''C94D''' and '''C98D''' respectively) variants were equipped with slower, but higher-density [[DRAM]] memory, allowing increased maximum memory sizes of up to 16 GB, depending on the model. The successor system was the [[Cray T90]]. ==External links== *[http://www.spikynorman.dsl.pipex.com/CrayWWWStuff/Cfaqp5.html#c90 Cray Research and Cray computers FAQ Part 5] {{Cray computers}} [[Category:Supercomputers]] [[Category:1991 introductions]] [[es:Cray C90]] [[it:Cray C90]]</text> </page> <page> <id>8372</id> <title>Cray Operating System</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}} {{ infobox OS | logo = | screenshot = | caption = | developer = [[Cray Research]] | family = | source_model = | working_state = Historic | latest_release_version = 1.17.2 | latest_release_date = July, 1990 | kernel_type = | license = [[Proprietary software|Proprietary]] | website = }} The '''Cray Operating System''' ('''COS''') was [[Cray Research]]'s proprietary [[operating system]] for its [[Cray-1]] (1976) and [[Cray X-MP]] [[supercomputer]]s, and those platforms' main OS until replaced by [[UNICOS]] in the late 1980s. COS was delivered with [[Cray Assembler Language]] (CAL), [[Cray FORTRAN]] (CFT), and [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]. == Design == As COS was written by ex-[[Control Data]] employees, its command language and internal organization bore strong resemblance to the [[CDC SCOPE (software)|SCOPE]] operating system on the [[CDC 7600]] and before that EXEC*8 from CDC's earlier ERA/Univac pedigree. User jobs were submitted to COS via front-end computers via a high-speed channel interface, and so-called ''station software''. Front end stations were typically large [[IBM]] or [[Control Data]] mainframes. However the [[DEC VAX]] was also a very popular front-end. Interactive use of COS was possible through the stations. But most users simply submitted batch jobs. Disk-resident datasets used by a user program were 'local' to the individual job. Once a job completed, its local datasets would be released and space reclaimed. In order to retain the data between jobs, datasets had to be explicitly made 'permanent'. [[Magnetic tape]] datasets were also supported on Cray systems which were equipped with an I/O Subsystem. COS also provided job scheduling and checkpoint/restart facilities to manage large workloads, even across system downtimes (both scheduled and unscheduled.) Internally, COS was divided into a very small message-passing EXEC, and a number of System Task Processors (STP tasks). Each STP task was similar in nature to the peripheral processor programs in earlier [[Control Data]] operating systems. === List of STP tasks === {{incomplete list}} {| class="wikitable" border="1" |- !

While the source for version 1.13 was released as [[public domain]], there are no known saved copies, and thus COS is considered to be lost to time.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} ==See also== {{Portal|Free software}} * [[Cray Time Sharing System]] * [[Timeline of operating systems]] {{Operating-system-stub}} [[de:Cray Operating System]] [[it:Cray Operating System]] [[ru:Cray Operating System]] [[Category:Operating systems]]</text> </page> <page> <id>8388</id> <title>Cray XT5</title> <text>{{Infobox One-of-a-kind computers |Image= [[File:JaguarXT5.jpg|frameless]] |Caption= ''Jaguar'', a Cray XT5 supercomputer at [[National Center for Computational Sciences]] at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratories]] |Website= |Dates= November 6, 2007 |Location= |Sponsors= |Operators= |Architecture= |Memory= |Storage= |Speed= |Power= |Space= |Cost= |ChartName=TOP500 |ChartPosition= |ChartDate= |Purpose= |Legacy= |Emulators= |Sources=[http://www.top500.org/system/10186 top500.org] |Website= }} [[File:Oak Ridge - Kraken (Cray XT5).JPG|thumb|''Kraken'', a Cray XT5 supercomputer at [[National Institute for Computational Sciences]] at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratories]]]] The '''[[Cray]] XT5''' is an updated version of the [[Cray XT4]] [[supercomputer]], launched on November 6, 2007.
