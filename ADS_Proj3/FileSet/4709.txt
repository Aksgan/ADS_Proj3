Visual cryptography was pioneered by [[Moni Naor]] and [[Adi Shamir]] in 1994. They demonstrated a visual [[secret sharing]] scheme, where an image was broken up into ''n'' shares so that only someone with all ''n'' shares could decrypt the image, while any ''n-1'' shares revealed no information about the original image. Each share was printed on a separate transparency, and decryption was performed by overlaying the shares. When all ''n'' shares were overlaid, the original image would appear. Using a similar idea, transparencies can be used to implement a [[one-time pad]] encryption, where one transparency is a shared random pad, and another transparency acts as the ciphertext. == Example == [[Image:Visual crypto animation demo.gif|frame|right|A demonstration of visual cryptography]] In this example, the [[Wikipedia]] logo has been split into two shares. Each white pixel in the original logo is split into two of the ''same'' small blocks that have full black and white pixels. When these two blocks are overlaid, they align exactly, and so the result is a light-colored block (with half black and half white pixels). Each black pixel in the original logo is split into two ''complementary'' small blocks. When these two blocks are overlaid, the result is a completely black block. If each pixel in the original image is split randomly into two shares as described above, the shares are correlated together (so that, when combined, they reveal the original image). Still, when each individual share is considered alone (i.e., when the other share is unknown), it is a totally random collection of blocks. Given only one share, a second share can be crafted to reveal any possible image; therefore, individual shares reveal no information about the original image. ==References== * Moni Naor and Adi Shamir, Visual Cryptography, EUROCRYPT 1994, pp1&ndash;12 [http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~naor/PUZZLES/visual_sol.html]. * [http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/visualcrypto.htm Visual Cryptography on Cipher Machines & Cryptology] * [http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/~dstinson/visual.html Doug Stinson's visual cryptography page] * [http://www2-fs.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/studdipl/christ/indexEN.php AJAX-Application to interactively create and encode images] {{Hidden messages}} [[Category:Cryptography]] {{crypto-stub}} [[de:Visuelle Kryptographie]] [[it:Crittografia visuale]] [[he:קריפטוגרפיה ויזואלית]] [[zh:可视密码]]</text> </page> <page> <id>39584</id> <title>Visual odometry</title> <text>[[Image:Optical flow example v2.png|thumb|right|The [[optical flow]] vector of a moving object in a video sequence.]] In [[robotics]] and [[computer vision]], '''visual odometry''' is the process of determining the position and orientation of a robot by analyzing the associated camera images. It has been used in a wide variety of robotic applications, such as on the [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s.<ref name=Maimone2007>{{cite journal | author = Maimone, M. | coauthors = Cheng, Y.; Matthies, L. | year = 2007 | title = Two years of Visual Odometry on the Mars Exploration Rovers | journal = Journal of Field Robotics | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 169–186 | url = http://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/publications/Mark_Maimone/rob-06-0081.R4.pdf | accessdate = 2008-07-10 | doi = 10.1002/rob.20184 }}</ref> ==Overview== In [[navigation]], [[odometry]] is the use of data from the movement of actuators to estimate change in position over time through devices such as [[rotary encoder]]s to measure wheel rotations. While useful for many wheeled or tracked vehicles, traditional odometry techniques cannot be applied to robots with non-standard locomotion methods, such as legged robots. In addition, odometry universally suffers from precision problems, since wheels tend to slip and slide on the floor creating a non-uniform distance traveled as compared to the wheel rotations. The error is compounded when the vehicle operates on non-smooth surfaces. Odometry reading become increasingly unreliable over time as these errors accumulate and compound over time. Visual odometry is the process of determining equivalent odometry information using sequential camera images to estimate the distance traveled. Visual odometry allows for enhanced navigational accuracy in robots or vehicles using any type of locomotion on any surface. ==Algorithm== Most existing approaches to visual odometry are based on the following stages. #
