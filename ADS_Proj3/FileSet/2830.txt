texturing, the cards were very limited in visual enhancement capability. Millennium received slightly more game support, but primarily only in bundled titles such as [[NASCAR Racing]] that only received slight performance improvements with little quality gain. The answer to these limitations, and Matrox's first attempt at targeting the consumer gaming PC market, would be the '''Matrox Mystique'''. Based heavily on the Millennium but with various additions and some cost-cutting measures, Mystique would offer gamers more of what they wanted for new 3D game titles. ==Overview== [[Image:MatroxMystique2MBcard.jpg|thumb|Matrox Mystique]] The Mystique was a [[64-bit]] 2D [[graphical user interface|GUI]] and video accelerator (MGA1064SG) with 3D acceleration support. Mystique has "[[Matrox Simple Interface]]" (MSI) rendering [[API]]. It was one of many early products by add-in graphics board vendors that attempted to achieve good combined 2D & 3D performance for consumer-level personal computers. The board used a 64-bit [[Dynamic random access memory|SGRAM]] memory interface (Synchronous Graphics RAM) instead of the more expensive [[Dynamic random access memory|WRAM]] (Window RAM) aboard the Matrox Millennium. SGRAM offered performance approaching WRAM, but it was cheaper. Mystique came in configurations ranging from 2 [[Mebibyte|MiB]] SGRAM up to 8 MiB. Mystique also had various ports on the card for memory expansion and additional hardware peripherals. The 8 MiB configuration used the memory expansion module. Add-on cards from Matrox included the ''Rainbow Runner Video'', a board offering [[MPEG-1]] and [[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]] video playback with video inputs and outputs. The other add-on was called ''Rainbow Runner TV'', an [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]]-based [[TV tuner card]] for watching TV on PC.<ref name=HagedoornGuru3D>Hagedoorn, Hilbert. [http://www.guru3d.com/review/mystique.html Review - Matrox Mystique 4Mb], the Guru 3D, accessed September 9, 2006.</ref> Mystique's 2D performance was very close to that of the much more expensive Millennium card, especially at [[XGA]] 1024x768 resolution and lower, where the SGRAM bandwidth was not a performance hindrance. The Mystique used an internal 170 MHz [[RAMDAC]], reduced from the external 220 MHz RAMDAC onboard Millennium, making it the first Matrox video processor using an internal RAMDAC. The frequency reduction affected the maximum [[refresh rate]] the card could run at high resolutions, crippling the Mystique for users of displays running [[UXGA]] 1600x1200, for example.<ref>Edstrom, Bo.

Instead, the Mystique uses [[nearest-neighbor interpolation]], causing heavy pixelization in textures, and [[stippling|stippled textures]] for transparency. Without mipmapping support, textures in the distance appear to "swim", waving around and appearing "noisy", because the texture detail wasn't being properly managed and this caused texture [[aliasing]]. The company's reasoning for not including the higher-quality features was that performance was more important than visual quality. At the time, [[semiconductor fabrication]] processes and 3D hardware architecture design expertise was limited. Including bilinear filtering would have incurred a significant cost in the chip's transistor budget for more computational resources and potentially reduce graphics core clock speed and performance due to a larger chip design. There was also the manufacturing cost consideration that comes with a larger processor size. Matrox's words were not without weight because the Mystique did handily outperform the other 2D/3D boards at the time, such as S3 ViRGE and early [[ATI Rage]] products, although its visual quality was lower than those accelerators.<ref>Lupinsky, K.

It performed well for an early 2D/3D combo card, but it had questionable 3D visual quality. Its 2D support rivaled the best cards available for performance and quality, however. It was not uncommon to pair up the Mystique or another Matrox card with a [[3Dfx Voodoo]] Graphics 3D-only board because the Voodoo cards were the fastest and most well-supported 3D accelerators at the time. Detractors, however, referred to the card as the "Matrox Mystake". Driver support for the Mystique was robust at launch.<ref name=HagedoornGuru3D /> The card directly supported all of Microsoft's operating systems including MS-DOS, [[Windows 3.1x]], [[Windows 95]], and [[Windows NT]]. Mystique also supported IBM's [[OS/2]] operating system. The retail version of Mystique included 3 3D game titles, including: [[MechWarrior 2: 31st Century Combat|MechWarrior 2]] Mystique edition, [[Destruction Derby 2]], and [[Scorched Planet]].<ref name=HagedoornGuru3D /> ==Mystique 220== [[Image:MatroxMystique220-4MB-card.jpg|thumb|Mystique 220]] Matrox released a newer version of the Mystique in 1997. The name gives the only significant change, that being the RAMDAC running at 220 MHz . This made the Mystique equivalent to the original Millennium for high-resolution 2D resolution support. The chip on the board was called MGA1164SG instead of MGA1064SG (original Mystique) as well. Otherwise, the card was identical in feature-set to the original Mystique and offered almost identical performance.<ref name=HagedoornGuru3D /><ref>[http://groups.google.com/group/comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware.chips/browse_thread/thread/211f13224bdda744 Mystique 170 versus 220], Google Groups, November 6, 1997.</ref> A special business-oriented version of Mystique 220, called '''Mystique 220 Business''', was launched as well.
