It was mentioned again by [[Gabe Newell]] in 2006 as a piece of technology he would like to add to his company's engine in order for them to support far larger scenes than are possible with strictly [[polygon (computer graphics)|polygonal]] objects.<ref name="1up-valveweek">{{cite web|url=http://valve.1up.com/|work=[[1UP.com]]|title=Valve Week| accessdate = 2006-07-14}}</ref> == Origins == [[File:Zeno Clash - Fight.jpg|thumb|Screenshot from ''[[Zeno Clash]]'', a third-party Source game.]] Source distantly originates from the [[GoldSrc]] engine, itself a heavily modified version of the [[QuakeWorld]] iteration of [[John D. Carmack]]'s [[Quake engine]], as is explained by Valve employee Erik Johnson on the [[Valve Developer Community]]:<ref name="goldsrc-src-quote">{{cite web|url=http://developer.valvesoftware.com/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Erik_Johnson&oldid=10088#GoldSource|title=Talk:Erik Johnson|work=Valve Developer Community|author=Erik Johnson|date=2005-09-01|accessdate=2007-08-15}}</ref> <blockquote>When we were getting very close to releasing ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' (less than a week or so), we found there were already some projects that we needed to start working on, but we couldn't risk checking in code to the shipping version of the game. At that point we [[fork (software development)|forked]] off the code in [[Microsoft Visual SourceSafe|VSS]] to be both <code>$/Goldsrc</code> and <code>/$Src</code>. Over the next few years, we used these terms internally as "Goldsource" and "Source". At least initially, the Goldsrc branch of code referred to the codebase that was currently released, and Src referred to the next set of more risky technology that we were working on. When it came down to show ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' for the first time at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]], it was part of our internal communication to refer to the "Source" engine vs. the "Goldsource" engine, and the name stuck.</blockquote> Source was developed part-by-part from this fork onwards, slowly replacing GoldSrc in Valve's internal projects<ref>{{cite book | author=Hodgson, David | year=2004 | title=Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar|publisher=[[Prima Games]] | isbn=0-7615-4364-3}}</ref> and explaining in part the reasons behind its unusually modular nature. Valve's development of Source since has been a mixture of licensed [[middleware]] ([[Havok (software)|Havok Physics]], albeit heavily modified, and [[MP3]] playback<!--we'll go on who you need to pay for secondary licenses, though I can't think of anything else anyway-->) and in-house-developed code. John Carmack commented on his [[blog]] in 2004 that "there are still bits of early ''Quake'' code in ''Half-Life 2''".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armadilloaerospace.com/n.x/johnc/recent%20updates/archive?news_id=290|date=2004-12-31|work=John Carmack's Blog|title=Welcome, Q3 source, Graphics}}</ref> == Criticism == === Toolset === {{OR-section|date=January 2010}} The [[Source SDK]] tools are criticised for being outdated and difficult to use.<ref name="dirigible-toolsblog">{{cite web|url=http://www.dirigible-games.com/diary/?p=15|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071227044928/http://www.dirigible-games.com/diary/?p=15|archivedate=2007-12-27|author=Neale Roberts|title=Stuck Valve|work=Dirigible Development Diary|date=November 15, 2006|accessdate=December 20, 2007}}</ref><ref name="jed_hlcoders09">{{cite web|url=http://www.mail-archive.com/hlcoders@list.valvesoftware.com/msg28135.html|author=Neil Jedrzejewski|publisher=hlcoders (official Valve mailing list)|title=Re: whats happening with this engine|date=July 23, 2009|accessdate=July 29, 2009}}</ref> A large number of the tools, including those for texture and model compilation, require varying levels of text-editor scripting from the user before they are executed at the command line with sometimes quite lengthy console commands.<ref name="vdc_vtex">{{cite web|url=http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Vtex_CLI_use|title=Vtex CLI use|work=Valve Developer Community|date=August 28, 2007|accessdate=July 21, 2008}}</ref> This obtuseness was cited by the [[University of London]] when they moved their exploration of professional architectural visualisation in computer games to [[Bethesda Softworks]]' [[Gamebryo]]-based Oblivion engine after a brief period with Source.<ref name="digitalurban-engineswitch">{{cite web|url=http://digitalurban.blogspot.com/2006/09/half-life-0-oblivion-1-half-life-update.html|title=Half Life 0 Oblivion 1 - Half Life Update|work=Digital Urban|date=September 28, 2006|accessdate=December 20, 2007}}</ref> Third-party tools provide [[Graphical User Interface|GUI]]s,<ref name="vdc-3rdpartytools">{{cite web|url=http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Category:Third_Party_Tools|title=Category:Third Party Tools|work=Valve Developer Community|accessdate=October 20, 2007}}</ref> but are not supported by Valve.

VDC replaced Valve's static Source SDK documentation with a full [[MediaWiki]]-powered community site; within a matter of days Valve reported that "the number of useful articles nearly doubled". These new articles covered the previously undocumented ''[[Counter-Strike: Source]]'' bot (added by the bot's author, Mike Booth), Valve's [[Non-Player Character|NPC]] AI, advice for mod teams on setting up [[source control]], and more. == Papers == Valve staff occasionally produce papers for various events and publications, including [[SIGGRAPH]], [[Game Developer (magazine)|Game Developer Magazine]] and [[Game Developers Conference]], explaining various aspects of Source's development.

Such a language is specially designed to facilitate the work of computer [[programmer]]s, who specify the actions to be performed by a computer mostly by writing source code, which can then be automatically translated to binary [[machine code]] that the computer can directly read and execute. An [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] translates to machine code and executes it [[on the fly]], while a [[compiler]] only translates to machine code that it stores as [[executable]] files; these can then be executed as a separate step. Most [[computer application]]s are distributed in a form that includes executable files, but not their source code,
