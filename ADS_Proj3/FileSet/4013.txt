shareware developers, providing a much larger audience than before. Many shareware developers are individual computer programmers who develop their own product. Online shareware author communities, like the [[newsgroup]] alt.comp.shareware.authors, are often used by software seekers to post their novel software ideas for potential implementation. ==Distribution== In the early 1990s, shareware distribution was a popular method of publishing games for smaller developers, including then-fledgling companies such as Apogee Software (now [[3D Realms]]), Epic Megagames (now [[Epic Games]]), and [[id Software]]. It gave consumers the chance to play the game before investing money in it, and gave them exposure that some products would be unable to get in the retail space. With the [[Kroz]] series, Apogee introduced the "episodic" shareware model that became the most popular incentive for "registering" (or buying) the game. While the shareware game would be a truly complete game, there would be additional "episodes" of the game that were not shareware, and could only be legally obtained by paying for the shareware episode. In some cases these episodes were neatly integrated and would feel like a longer version of the game, and in other cases the later episode(s) would be stand-alone games. Racks of games on single 5 1/4 inch and later 3.5 inch [[floppy disk]]s were common in retail stores. However, [[bulletin board systems]] (BBS) and computer expositions such as [[Software Creations BBS]] were the primary distributors of all early low-cost software. Free software from a BBS was the motive force for consumers to purchase a computer equipped with a modem, so as to acquire software at no cost. At PC expositions, extant today, shareware was essentially free; the cost only covered the disk and minimal packaging. In the mid-1990s, the shareware market declined and within a few years had virtually disappeared as a means for distributing computer games. The reasons for this are various, but could be closely linked with the decline of garage coders. Shareware was often a great means for games that were unable to get traditional marketing and retail exposure to get noticed. However, as technology improved, independent games were less able to be competitive in a commercial market, and larger developers found it unnecessary to release extensive shareware episodes, instead offering more limited [[game demo|demos]] in their stead. The important distinguishing feature between a shareware game and a game demo is that the shareware game is, at least in theory, a complete game. Where modern demos are often a single level or less, shareware games usually had many hours of play with a beginning, middle, and end. Shareware episodes most commonly offered 1/3 or 1/2 of the entire registered version, and many even offered the entire product as shareware with no additional content for registered users. ==Criticism== In the 1980s and early-to-mid 1990s shareware was considered to be a concept for independent software writers to receive a degree of remuneration for their labor. However, after that the shareware model began to degrade as the term was used by commercial [[Startup company|startups]] offering (sometimes substandard) commercial software and labeling non-functional or limited demo versions (known as [[crippleware]]) as shareware. As a result, the term shareware has shown reduced usage in recent years, replaced by either demo for trial software or [[freeware]] for full editions. However, shareware software is not always so limited in function, as demonstrated with programs such as [[The Bat!]], [[GetRight]], [[WinZip]], and [[WinRAR]], as well as various games. Some shareware groups have liberal standards, allowing 'nag screens' that remind the user to buy the software, demonstration or "demo" versions and trialware. Some have refused to accept any software with limited functionality, including demos, trial use, or crippled software.<ref>[http://www.sustworks.com/site/news_exposing_myth.html "Exposing the Myth of "Shareware". www.sustworks.com]</ref> Most groups, such as the Association of Shareware Professionals, the Software Industry Professionals group and PC Shareware clearly state their position that any software marketed as 'try before you buy' is shareware. Another issue is the high percentage of projects that are either unsuccessful or just abandoned. Sites like [[Tucows]], [[download.com]], and [[Handango]] list hundreds of thousands of shareware projects, many of which are abandoned. One sampling found 76% of listed projects were abandoned or no longer being updated. Active projects commonly see less than 0.5% of downloaders convert to paying customers,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oisv.com/articles/marketing/3_tips_to_improve_conversion_rates/ |title="Tips to Improve conversion". www.oisv.com |archiveurl=http://google.com/search?q=cache:mR5vh15PhiYJ:www.oisv.com/articles/marketing/3_tips_to_improve_conversion_rates/+%22Tips+to+Improve+conversion%22.+www.oisv.com+site:oisv.com&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us |archivedate=2009-06-24}}</ref> and as many as half of the users may be using pirated versions of the software.<ref>[http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/02/02/1347247 Slashdot: "Do You Pay for Your Shareware?"]</ref> With the advent of the internet, many traditional shareware programs (such as photo editing tools or word processors) are now available directly through a web browser, therefore bypassing the entire process of having to download and install the application. In addition to offering the convenience of not having to install any software, most online applications are offered at no cost to the user, through means of online advertisements. ==Derivatives== Other types of software distribution, taking the suffix "-ware" have followed shareware's lead. They usually do not require the user to make a specific payment to the author. Rather, they sometimes require the user to send the author a postcard ([[postcardware]]), donate to a specific charity ([[careware]]), say a prayer for the author (prayerware), or do some other action. ==Industry standards and technologies== There are several widely accepted standards and technologies that are used in the development and promotion of shareware. *[[FILE ID.DIZ]] is a descriptive text file often included in downloadable shareware distribution packages. *[[Portable Application Description|PAD (Portable Application Description)]] is used to standardize shareware application descriptions. PAD file is an XML document that describes a shareware or freeware product according to the PAD specification.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070727172341/http://www.asp-shareware.org/pad/specs.asp PAD specification]</ref> *[[DynamicPAD]] extends the Portable Application Description (PAD) standard by allowing shareware vendors to provide customized PAD XML files to each download site or any other PAD-enabled resource. DynamicPAD is a set of server-side PHP scripts distributed under a GPL license and a freeware DynamicPAD builder for 32-bit Windows. *[[Code signing]] is a technology that is used by Shareware developers to digitally sign their products.
