of the Front Page, making it easy for new users to the site to find quality content. Originally the icons were created by moderators, as were the long Flash descriptions (the same process used for the collections pages), but this proved to be an extremely time-consuming, tedious task. Currently users are given the ability to attach their own icons with their submissions, and write their own brief descriptions. On January 12, 2004 the home page archive was launched, keeping a month-by-month list of Flash content that was deemed to be worthy of display on the Newgrounds homepage. This includes either those who performed well in the daily awards, or simply those the admin deemed worthy. On June 27, 2006, the '''Icon Helpers''' system was launched for Newgrounds volunteers to make and submit icons for newer flash content that was lacking an icon, making the integration to automated collections pages much more effective. On a few occasions, while maintenance has been performed on the site, the home page has been replaced by an "under construction" page showing the Newgrounds tank picture being welded by a programming crew. The image is accompanied by a message describing the work done, such as that displayed during the major update that occurred in July 2007, July 2009, 21 October 2009 and June 2010 and November/December 2010: "IN UR TANK, UPGRADING UR SERVERZ :3". == Flash Portal == The Flash portal is utilized by Newgrounds members to submit Flash content. Registered users can submit new Flash games or animations and can vote between 0 and 5 on existing submissions. They can leave textual reviews as well, to which the author can reply. If the submission has been uploaded recently, the user can choose to "Blam" the submission (a vote from 0 - 1) or "Protect" the submission (a vote from 2 - 5). Submissions will be deleted if they fall below the following scores after each amount of votes:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newgrounds.com/lit/faq/|title=Newgrounds FAQ|publisher=Newgrounds|accessdate=2009-04-03}}</ref> * 100 votes: 1.0 * 150 votes: 1.25 * 200 votes: 1.6 Voting on submissions regularly and depositing experience (10 points earned for voting on 5 submissions in a day) increases the voting power a user carries. For example, a level 35 user's vote is worth 7.65 votes. This power is further increased by successfully voting on submissions during the judgment period. Protecting a submission that passes judgment earns protection points, whilst blamming a submission that gets blammed earns blam points. Uploaded files must conform to certain requirements: * The file must have the extension [[.swf]]. * The file may not exceed the given capacity of 10 MB ([[Megabytes]]) except by prior agreement with the Administrators - a size that used to be far smaller but has been increasing in line with increasing bandwidth and tolerance for download times. * Basic quality guidelines are in place - disallowing 'pictures in a slide show format with no interactivity', 'movies or games made from public .FLA files', 'photographs that are illegal' and so on. If these are not met, the submission will be 'whistled' by users. Finally, when the submission is uploaded it receives its own page on Newgrounds and undergoes 'judgment'. To aid the production of Flash to be submitted, Newgrounds has a variety of [http://www.newgrounds.com/downloads/preloaders/ preloaders] (loading screens that appear at the beginning of a flash game or video) that can be downloaded and integrated into their Flashes. On May 27, 2009,<ref name="widelayout1">{{cite web|url=http://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic/1064304|title=Wide Layout|last=Fulp|first=Tom|date=2009-05-26|accessdate=2009-05-28}}</ref> the Flash Portal underwent a large redesign, switching to a wide layout. Users that disliked the new layout have been given the option to change it via their account preferences. === Rating systems === Authors self-rate submissions for each of these categories: [[Nudity]], [[Violence]], [[Sound recording and reproduction|Audio]], Text and [[explicit material|Adult themes]] (None, Mild, Excessive and sometimes Explicit depending if it is text or not). The ratings are: * E (Everyone) = This Flash is suitable for viewers of all ages. * T (Teens) = This Flash is suitable for viewers the age of 13 or above. * M (Mature) = This Flash is suitable for viewers the age of 17 or above. * A (Adult) = This Flash is suitable for adults only (viewers age of 18 or above). The ratings are only intended as a guide; there is no system in place to prevent people from viewing submissions of any specific rating. The system enables the submitter to record a credit for all the audio used in the submission and links directly to any audio taken from the Newgrounds Audio Portal. === Awards === When a Flash movie or game is submitted to the Flash Portal, it has the chance to win any of the following awards. * Daily awards: ** '''Daily Feature/2nd/3rd/4th/5th''': The five submissions submitted during a day that have the highest rating at the day's end are given awards and showcased on the front page. * Weekly awards: ** '''Weekly Feature/2nd/3rd/4th/5th''': The five submissions submitted during a week (Wednesday to Tuesday) that have the highest rating at the week's end are given awards and showcased on the front page. ** '''Review Crew Pick:''' This award is given to the submission with the best score in reviews, but requires a large number of reviews to qualify. ** '''Underdog of the Week:''' This award is given to the submission with the biggest discrepancy between the review score and the popular vote. The flash submission must also have at least 30 reviews in order to win. This usually reflects a movie considered poor by most but with a cult following. ** '''Turd of the Week:''' This award is given to the submission with the lowest score that managed to pass judgment that week. If the file has been switched for another file by its creator once it has passed, it can no longer win this award. This stops a user from switching files in order to promote something else, by winning an award to go onto Front Page. * Monthly awards: ** '''King of The Portal:''' This
