with a removable rubber piece through which the shooter looks. The sight is designed so that the aim will be correct at a distance of {{convert|3|m|ft|0}}. The sensor is a small box, 2½" by 2½" by 1", with a standard [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] controller cord attached. On the front is an oval-shaped black area, receding back from the two sides to a red sensor about the size of a [[dime (United States coin)|dime]]. All of the Super Scope games made by Nintendo have a soft-reset to the game's main title. This is accomplished by pausing the game, then, while holding CURSOR, the FIRE button must be pressed twice. ==Detecting a target hit== The Super Scope makes use of the scanning process used in [[cathode ray tube]] monitors, as CRTs were the only affordable TV monitors until the late 1990s. In short, the screen is drawn by a scanning [[electron]] beam that travels horizontally across each line of the screen from top to bottom. A fast [[photodiode]] will see any particular area of the screen illuminated only briefly as that point is scanned, while the [[Eye|human eye]] will see a consistent image due to [[persistence of vision]]. The Super Scope takes advantage of this in a fairly simple manner: it simply outputs a '0' signal when it sees the television [[raster scan]] and a '1' signal when it does not. Inside the console this signal is delivered to the PPU, which notes which screen [[pixel]] it is outputting at the moment the signal transitions from 1 to 0. At the end of the frame, the game software can retrieve this stored position to determine where on the screen the gun was aimed. All licensed Super Scope games include a calibration mode to account for both electrical delays and maladjustment of the [[Sight (device)|gunsight]].<ref name="snesdev">{{cite book |author=Nintendo |authorlink=Nintendo |title=Super Nintendo Entertainment System Development Manual |year=1995}}</ref> The Super Scope ignores red light, as do many guns of this type, because red [[phosphor]]s have a much slower rate of decay than green or blue phosphors.<ref name="snesdev"/> Since the Super Scope depends on the short persistence and scan pattern of CRT pixels, it will not function with modern displays (such as [[Plasma display|plasma screens]] or [[Liquid crystal display|LCDs]]) that continuously light each pixel. ==Games compatible with the Super Scope== * ''[[Battle Clash]]'' * ''[[Bazooka Blitzkrieg]]'' * ''[[The Hunt for Red October (video game)|The Hunt for Red October]]'' (it is used for bonus games) * ''[[Lamborghini American Challenge]]'' (it accesses a different game mode from the normal one) * ''[[Metal Combat: Falcon's Revenge]]'' * ''[[Operation Thunderbolt (video game)|Operation Thunderbolt]]'' * ''[[Super Scope 6]]'' (bundled with the hardware) * ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day (arcade game)|T2: The Arcade Game]]'' * ''[[Tin Star (video game)|Tin Star]]'' * ''[[X-Zone]]'' * ''[[Yoshi's Safari]]'' ==Appearances in games and other media== *An enemy named Sniper Bill in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'' on the [[Game Boy Advance]] is armed with a Super Scope. *A modified Super Scope appears in the Hollywood film ''[[Super Mario Bros. (film)|Super Mario Bros.]]'' as a weapon called the "Devo Gun". ===In the ''Super Smash Bros.'' series=== In ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl|Brawl]]'', the Super Scope is an item that can be picked up and used in combat, appearing as a blaster-type weapon. Here, it can be used as a rapid-fire weapon, or charged to release a devastating super shot that can knock opponents off-screen. It is also a collectible trophy in both games. == Reception == {{Refimprove|date=July 2010}} {{Weasel|date=July 2010}} The Super Scope had generally negative reviews, and the hardware and games that require this hardware to play had very poor sales.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The Super Scope received many complaints from many gamers indicating that the hardware was heavy and unbalanced making it difficult to use (as compared to the simple lightweight [[NES Zapper]]), high physical risks of severe headaches, eye strain, and arm pain, and the hardware had a very poor battery life.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} It was considered one of Nintendo's Worst Products behind the [[Virtual Boy]] that failed miserably at the market and similarly contributed to severe physical injuries for many gamers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} After Nintendo found out that the Super Scope had very poor sales at the market, they quickly discontinued the hardware in 1995.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} ==See also== *[[BatterUP]] – The baseball bat controller for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System *[[Menacer]] – The lightgun accessory for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive * [[NES Zapper]] - The lightgun accessory for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] ==References== <references/> {{Nintendo hardware|SNES}} [[Category:Nintendo hardware]] [[Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] [[Category:Light guns]] [[de:Zubehör zum Super Nintendo Entertainment System#Super Scope]] [[es:Super Scope]] [[fr:Super Scope]] [[ja:スーパースコープ]] [[pt:Super Scope]] [[fi:Super Scope]] [[sv:Super Scope]]</text> </page> <page> <id>36176</id> <title>Super race</title> <text>A '''super race''' is a future race of improved [[human]]s that it is proposed be created from present day [[human being]]s by deploying various means such as [[eugenics]], [[genetic engineering]], [[yoga]], or [[nanotechnology]] and [[Brain-computer interface|brain-computer interfacing]] to accelerate the process of [[human evolution]]. ==Aryan super race== {{main|Master race}} The most well known super race concept is the [[Nazi]] idea that proposed to create an ''Aryan Super Race'' by applying [[eugenic]]s to what the Nazis referred to as the [[Nordic race|Nordic]] [[Aryan race|Aryan]] master race.<ref>[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler, Adolf]].

This new super race would be genetically engineered to have super brains, super senses, and more delicate hands to be able to travel in [[starship]]s, which would be sent out to colonize the entire [[Milky Way
