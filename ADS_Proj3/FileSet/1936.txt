Although the machine was fairly simple, it was nevertheless a masterpiece of design, using far fewer parts than anything in its class, and quickly earning Wozniak a reputation as a master designer. Joined by another friend, [[Ronald Wayne]], the three started to build the machines. Using a variety of methods, including borrowing space from friends and family, selling various prized items (like [[calculator]]s and a [[Volkswagen|VW]] [[VW Type 2|bus]]) and scrounging, Jobs managed to secure the parts needed while Wozniak and Wayne assembled them. But the owner of the Byte Shop was expecting complete computers, not just printed circuit boards. The boards still being a product for the customers Terrell still paid them.<ref name="iCon-p36">{{cite book | title=iCon Steve Jobs: The Greatest Second Act in the History of Business| last=Young| first=Jeffrey| coauthors=William L.

Many of the design features of the I were due to the limited amount of money they had to construct the prototype, but with the income from the sales he was able to start construction of a greatly improved machine, the [[Apple II]]; it was presented to the public at the first [[West Coast Computer Faire]] on April 16 and April 17, 1977. On the first day of exhibition, Jobs introduced Apple II to a [[Japan]]ese chemist named Toshio Mizushima who became the first authorized Apple dealer in [[Japan]]. The main difference internally was a completely redesigned TV interface, which held the display in memory. Now not only useful for simple text display, the Apple II included graphics, and, eventually, color. Jobs meanwhile pressed for a much improved case and keyboard, with the idea that the machine should be complete and ready to run out of the box. This was almost the case for the Apple I machines sold to The Byte Shop, but one still needed to plug various parts together and type in the code to run BASIC. Building such a machine was going to be fiscally burdensome. Jobs started looking for cash, but Wayne was somewhat gun shy due to a failed venture four years earlier, and eventually dropped out of the company. [[Bank]]s were reluctant to lend Jobs money; the idea of a computer for ordinary people seemed absurd at the time. Jobs eventually met [[Mike Markkula|"Mike" Markkula]] who co-signed a bank loan for US$250,000, and the three formed Apple Computer on April 1, 1976. Why Apple? At the time, the company to beat was [[Atari]], and Apple Computer came before Atari alphabetically and thus also in the phone book. Another reason was that Jobs had happy memories of working on an Oregon apple farm one summer.<ref>{{cite book |title=Apple Confidential | last=Linzmayer | first=Owen}}</ref> With both cash and a new case design in hand thanks to designer [[Jerry Manock]], the Apple II was released in 1977 and became the computer generally credited with creating the [[home computer]] market{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}. Millions were sold well into the 1980s. A number of different models of the [[Apple II series]] were built, including the [[Apple IIe]] and [[Apple IIGS|Apple II<small>GS</small>]], which could still be found in many schools as late as 2005.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} ===The Apple III=== {{Main|Apple III}} [[Image:Apple3.jpg|right|thumb|Apple III]] By the early 1980s, Apple Computer faced increasing competition. While the Apple II was already established as a successful business-ready platform because of Visicalc, Apple was not content. The Apple III (Apple 3) was designed to take on the IBM PC in the business environment. The Apple III was a relatively conservative design for computers of the era. However, Steve Jobs did not want the computer to have a fan; rather, he wanted the heat generated by the electronics to be dissipated through the [[chassis]] of the machine, forgoing the cooling fan. Unfortunately, the physical design of the case was not sufficient to cool the components inside it. By removing the fan from the design, the Apple III was prone to overheating. This caused the [[integrated circuit]] chips to disconnect from the motherboard. Customers who contacted Apple customer service were told to "drop the computer on the desk", which would cause the ICs to fall back in to place. Thousands of Apple III computers were recalled and, although a new model was introduced in 1983 to rectify the problems, the damage was already done. ===The Apple IPO=== On December 12, 1980, Apple launched the [[Initial Public Offering]] of its stock to the investing public. When Apple went public, it generated more capital than any IPO since [[Ford Motor Company]] in 1956{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} and instantly created more millionaires (about 300) than any company in history. Several venture capitalists cashed out, reaping billions in long-term capital gains. In January 1981, Apple held its first shareholders meeting as a public company in the [[Flint Center]], a large auditorium at nearby [[De Anza College]], which is often used for symphony concerts. (Previous meetings were held quietly in smaller rooms, because there had only been a few shareholders.) The business of the meeting had been planned (or choreographed) so that the voting could be staged in 15 minutes or less. In most cases, voting proxies are collected by mail and counted days or months before a meeting. In this case, after the IPO, many shares were in new hands. <!--The results of the vote were surprising: a young programmer, [[Randy Wigginton]], received enough votes to be added to Apple's Board of Directors, through the use of [[cumulative voting]] by a few major shareholders.--> [[Steve Jobs]] started his prepared speech, but after being interrupted by voting several times, he dropped his prepared speech and delivered a long, emotionally charged talk about betrayal, lack of respect, and related topics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} ===Xerox PARC and the Lisa=== {{Main|Apple Lisa}} [[Image:Apple Lisa.jpg|right|thumb|Lisa]] While Apple Computerâ€™s business division was focused on the Apple III, a separate group was
