in the telephone system. Local area network architecture, which included broadcast-capable multiaccess media, was developed independently of the ISO work in [[IEEE 802|IEEE Project 802]]. IEEE work assumed sublayering and management functions not required for WAN use. In modern practice, only error detection, not flow control using sliding window, is present in data link protocols such as [[Point-to-Point Protocol]] (PPP), and, on local area networks, the IEEE 802.2 [[Logical Link Control|LLC]] layer is not used for most protocols on the Ethernet, and on other local area networks, its flow control and acknowledgment mechanisms are rarely used. Sliding window flow control and acknowledgment is used at the Transport Layer by protocols such as [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]], but is still used in niches where [[X.25]] offers performance advantages. The [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] standard, which provides high-speed local area networking over existing wires (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables), includes a complete [[Data Link Layer]] which provides both error correction and flow control by means of a [[selective repeat]] [[Sliding Window Protocol]]. Both WAN and LAN service arrange bits, from the Physical Layer, into logical sequences called frames. Not all Physical Layer bits necessarily go into frames, as some of these bits are purely intended for Physical Layer functions. For example, every fifth bit of the [[FDDI]] bit stream is not used by the Layer. ====WAN Protocol architecture==== [[Connection-oriented]] WAN data link protocols, in addition to framing, detect and may correct errors. They are also capable of controlling the rate of transmission. A WAN Data Link Layer might implement a [[sliding window]] flow control and acknowledgment mechanism to provide reliable delivery of frames; that is the case for [[Synchronous Data Link Control|SDLC]] and [[HDLC]], and derivatives of HDLC such as [[LAPB]] and [[Link Access Procedures, D channel|LAPD]]. ====IEEE 802 LAN architecture==== Practical, [[connectionless]] LANs began with the pre-IEEE [[Ethernet]] specification, which is the ancestor of [[IEEE 802.3]]. This layer manages the interaction of devices with a shared medium, which is the function of a [[Media Access Control]] (MAC) sublayer. Above this MAC sublayer is the media-independent [[IEEE 802.2]] [[Logical Link Control]] (LLC) sublayer, which deals with addressing and multiplexing on multiaccess media. While IEEE 802.3 is the dominant wired LAN protocol and [[IEEE 802.11]] the wireless LAN protocol, obsolescent MAC layers include [[Token Ring]] and [[FDDI]]. The MAC sublayer detects but does not correct errors. ===Layer 3: Network Layer=== The [[Network Layer]] provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable length [[data]] sequences from a source host on one network to a destination host on a different network, while maintaining the [[quality of service]] requested by the Transport Layer (in contrast to the data link layer which connects hosts within the same network). The Network Layer performs network [[routing]] functions, and might also perform fragmentation and reassembly, and report delivery errors. [[Router]]s operate at this layer—sending data throughout the extended network and making the Internet possible. This is a logical addressing scheme – values are chosen by the network engineer. The addressing scheme is not hierarchical. Careful analysis of the Network Layer indicated that the Network Layer could have at least three sublayers: # Subnetwork Access - that considers protocols that deal with the interface to networks, such as X.25; # Subnetwork Dependent Convergence - when it is necessary to bring the level of a transit network up to the level of networks on either side; # Subnetwork Independent Convergence - which handles transfer across multiple networks. The best example of this latter case is CLNP, or IPv7 ISO 8473. It manages the [[Connectionless protocol|connectionless]] transfer of data one hop at a time, from end system to [[ingress router]], router to router, and from [[egress router]] to destination end system. It is not responsible for reliable delivery to a next hop, but only for the detection of erroneous packets so they may be discarded. In this scheme, IPv4 and IPv6 would have to be classed with X.25 as subnet access protocols because they carry interface addresses rather than node addresses. A number of layer management protocols, a function defined in the Management Annex, ISO 7498/4, belong to the Network Layer. These include routing protocols, multicast group management, Network Layer information and error, and Network Layer address assignment. It is the function of the payload that makes these belong to the Network Layer, not the protocol that carries them. ===Layer 4: Transport Layer=== The [[Transport Layer]] provides transparent transfer of data between end users, providing reliable data transfer services to the upper layers. The Transport Layer controls the reliability of a given link through flow control, segmentation/desegmentation, and error control. Some protocols are state and connection oriented. This means that the Transport Layer can keep track of the segments and retransmit those that fail. The Transport layer also provides the acknowledgement of the successful data transmission and sends the next data if no errors occurred. Although not developed under the OSI Reference Model and not strictly conforming to the OSI definition of the Transport Layer, typical examples of Layer 4 are the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) and [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP). Of the actual OSI protocols, there are five classes of connection-mode transport protocols ranging from class 0 (which is also known as TP0 and provides the least features) to class 4 (TP4, designed for less reliable networks, similar to the Internet). Class 0 contains no error recovery, and was designed for use on network layers that provide error-free connections. Class 4 is closest to TCP, although TCP contains functions, such as the graceful close, which OSI assigns to the Session Layer. Also, all OSI TP connection-mode protocol classes provide expedited data and preservation of record boundaries, both of which TCP is incapable. Detailed characteristics of TP0-4 classes are shown in the following table:<ref>{{cite web | title = ITU-T Recommendation X.224 (11/1995) ISO/IEC 8073 | url = http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.224-199511-I/en/ }}</ref> {| class="wikitable" |- !
