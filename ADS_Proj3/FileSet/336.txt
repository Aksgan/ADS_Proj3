George Simjian]] has been credited with developing and building the first cash dispenser machine.<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/simjian.html Inventor of the Week: Luther George Simjian] [[MIT]]</ref> There is strong evidence to suggest that Simjian worked on this device before 1959 while his 132nd patent (US3079603) was first filed on 30 June 1960 (and granted 26 February 1963). The rollout of this machine, called Bankograph, was delayed a couple of years. This was due in part to Simjian's Reflectone Electronics Inc. being acquired by Universal Match Corporation.<ref>'Universal Match Maps Acquisition’, The New York Times, 22 March 1961</ref> An experimental Bankograph was installed in [[New York City]] in 1961 by the [[Citibank|City Bank of New York]], but removed after 6 months due to the lack of customer acceptance. The Bankograph was an automated envelope deposit machine (accepting coins, cash and cheques) and it did not have cash dispensing features.<ref>‘Machine Accepts Cash Deposits’, The New York Times, 12 April 1961</ref> The Bankograph, however, embodied the preoccupation by US banks in finding alternative means to capture core deposits, while the concern of European and Asian banks was cash distribution. A first cash dispensing device was used in Tokyo in 1966.<ref>'Fast Machine with a Buck', Pacific Stars and Stripes, p. 7, 14 July 1966</ref><ref>‘Instant Cash via Credit Cards’, ABA Banking Journal, p. 99, January 1967</ref> Although little is known of this first device, it seems to have been activated with a credit card rather than accessing current account balances. This technology had no immediate consequence in the international market. [[File:atmplaque.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Plaque commemorating installation of world's first bank cash machine]] In simultaneous and independent efforts, engineers in Sweden and Britain developed their own cash machines during the early 1960s. The first of these that was put into use was by [[Barclays Bank]] in [[Enfield Town]] in [[North London]], [[United Kingdom]],<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2007/06/26/cash_machine_feature.shtml | title = Enfield's cash gift to the world | publisher = [[BBC London]] | date = 27 June 2007 }}</ref> on 27 June 1967. This machine was the first in the UK and was used by English comedy actor [[Reg Varney]], at the time so as to ensure maximum publicity for the machines that were to become mainstream in the UK. This instance of the [[invention]] has been credited to [[John Shepherd-Barron]],<ref>{{Cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6230194.stm | title = The man who invented the cash machine | publisher = BBC News | date=25 June 2007 | accessdate=26 April 2010 | first=Brian | last=Milligan}}</ref> while disregarding other engineers at [[De La Rue|De La Rue Instruments]], since 2008 [http://www.talaris.com Talaris], who contributed to the design and development of that machine. Nevertheless, Shepherd-Barron was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in the 2005 [[New Year's Honours List]].<ref>{{Cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4135269.stm | title = ATM inventor honoured | publisher = BBC News | date=31 December 2004 | accessdate=26 April 2010}}</ref> His design used special checks that were matched with a personal identification number, as plastic bank cards had not yet been invented.<ref name="latimes1">{{Cite news | title = ATM inventor John Shepherd-Barron dies at age of 84 on 20th May 2010 | publisher = The LA Times, May 19, 2010 | url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/afterword/2010/05/atm-inventor-john-shepherdbarron-dies-at-84.html | date=19 May 2010}}</ref> The Barclays-De La Rue machine (called De La Rue Automatic Cash System or DACS) beat the [[List of banks in Sweden|Swedish saving banks’]] and a company called Metior's (a device called Bankomat) by nine days and [[National Westminster Bank|Westminster Bank’s]]-[[Smiths Group|Smith Industries]]-[[Chubb Locks|Chubb]] system (called Chubb MD2) by a month. The collaboration of a small start-up called Speytec and [[Midland Bank]] developed a third machine which was marketed after 1969 in Europe and the USA by the [[Burroughs Corporation]]. The patent for this device (GB1329964) was filed on September 1969 (and granted in 1973) by John David Edwards, Leonard Perkins, John Henry Donald, Peter Lee Chappell, Sean Benjamin Newcombe & Malcom David Roe. Both the DACS and MD2 accepted only a single-use token or voucher which was retained by the machine while the Speytec worked with a card with a magnetic stripe at the back. Hence all this these worked on various principles including [[radiation|Carbon-14]] and low-coercivity [[magnetism]] in order to make fraud more difficult. The idea of a PIN stored on the card was developed by a British engineer working in the MD2 named [[James Goodfellow]] in 1965 (patent GB1197183 filed on 2 May 1966 with Anthony Davies). The essence of this system was that is it enabled the verification of the customer with the debited account without human intervention. This patent is also the earliest instance of a complete “currency dispenser system” in the patent record. This patent was filled on 5 March 1968 in the USA (US 3543904) and granted on 1 December 1970. It had a profound influence on the industry as a whole. Not only did future entrants into the cash dispenser market such as [[NCR Corporation]] and [[IBM]] licence Goodfellow’s PIN system, but a number of later patents references this patent as “Prior Art Device”.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4668724 | title = Evidence from the patent record on the development of cash dispensing technology | by B.

On September 2, 1969, [[Chemical Bank]] installed the first ATM in the U.S. at its branch in [[Rockville Centre, New York]]. The first ATMs were designed to dispense a fixed amount of cash when a user inserted a specially coded card.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=XZMrIchANY4C&pg=PA266 1969: the year everything changed].
