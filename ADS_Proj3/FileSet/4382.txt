Shannon''' (August 16, 1952 â€“ May 26, 2005) was an information technology consultant, journalist and author. For over 30 years, he was involved in implementing [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]], [[VAX]], and [[DEC Alpha|Alpha computers]] with their respective [[operating systems]] [[RSX-11|RSX]], VAX/VMS; and [[OpenVMS]] & [[Windows NT]]. He was a respected journalist and analyst, paying particular attention to HP/Compaq and the [[high-performance computing]] space, writing a series of newsletters. He has been credited with assigning [[Intel Corporation]] the nickname "[[Chipzilla]]".<ref name="chipzilla">{{cite web | url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/1999/03/15/chipzilla_becomes_gorgonzilla/ | title=Chipzilla becomes Gorgonzilla | publisher=The Register | date=1999-03-15 | accessdate=2007-02-22}}</ref> Terry Shannon participated and spoke at meetings of [[DECUS]] (the Digital Equipment Corporation Users Society), the international users group of [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]], currently known as [[Encompass]]. He also spoke as an authority at other IT and HPC conferences, and was quoted by other authors as an authority on the subject. ==Early life== Terry C. Shannon was born in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[New York]], [[USA]].<ref name="bio">[http://www.shannonknowshpc.com/pages.php?page=About About Terry Shannon]</ref> At the age of 17 he dropped out of high school and enlisted in the [[US Army]] in 1969.<ref name="Graham">[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/36/Tcsboston.pdf Graham, Lamar B. (1992) The Nerd Who Came In from the Cold, Boston Magazine, February 1992, 52-55, 90-91.]</ref> He served as a [[spook]] in [[Vietnam]] at a Radio Reconnaissance Field Station (i.e., the 330th RRFS) with the 509th Radio Research Group of the [[Army Security Agency]] (ASA), a branch of the [[National Security Agency]] (see NSA and/or [[SIGINT]] for explanation).<ref name="spooks">[http://www.oldspooksandspies.org/OSS_Memorial/oss_memorial.htm Old Spooks and Spies]</ref>. During his two years (1970-1972) of [[Vietnam War]] service,<ref name="Graham"/> Shannon was a [[computer communications]] and [[traffic analysis]] specialist. Using his training in cryptology and signal-intelligence, his job was to triangulate North Vietnamese radio signals, request an [[airstrike]], and then return to the original frequency and listen for the enemy channel to "go off the air."<ref name="Graham"/> He was separated from the Army with an [[honorable discharge]] in 1972. After earning his [[GED]], Shannon received his Bachelors degree from [[SUNY Empire State College]]. He was awarded the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]], about thirty years after separation, for his service in the [[Vietnam War]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}} ==Writing career== In May 1983, Shannon became self-employed as a writer. He published his first brief article in the May 1983 issue of ''DEC Professional''. About two years later, in September 1985, Shannon began working as a contributor for ''Digital Review''. During his tenure with ''Digital Review'', Shannon began using the pseudonym "Charlie Matco".<ref name="bio"/> While Shannon also frequently wrote under the pseudonyms "Digital Dog" and "the notorious Belgian hacker Cedric Zool,"<ref name="Cedric Zool">[http://www.vmsone.com/~opcom/defcon9.htm Defcon meets Cedric Zool]</ref> Charlie Matco was by far his best known ''nom de plume''.<ref name="Graham"/><ref name="Matco1">[http://www.techiegroups.com/archive/index.php/t-57293.html Charlie Matco as an alias]</ref><ref name="Matco2">[http://www.spyderbyte.com/ Alias Charlie Matco]</ref> Under the "Charlie Matco" byline, Terry Shannon combined a humorous writing style with erudite and timely prognostications about IT industry trends, product releases, and major business transactions, often well in advance of the public release of such information, in the "Rumor Roundup" feature at the end of each issue of ''Digital Review'' magazine. This information was obtained as a result of Shannon's well-polished skills at schmoozing his vast network of friends and colleagues in the IT industry, and of astutely combining information they provided.<ref name="Graham"/> Shannon's use of the "Charlie Matco" nom de plume is said to have originated when, after drinking with friends in Massachusetts, Shannon walked out of a bar and saw a [[Matco Tools]] truck at a service station across the street.{{fact|date=March 2007}} [[Image:matcomugs.jpg|thumb|Charlie Matco coffee mugs]] "Charlie Matco" was usually depicted as a cartoonish, "private eye" sort of figure, after the fashion of [[Nick Danger (fictional character)|Nick Danger]], but without any facial features (i.e., just a fedora, a trenchcoat, and a cigarette in one hand).<ref name="Graham"/> That logo, which appeared next to the "Charlie Matco" byline on every "Rumor Roundup" article, was also depicted on the coffee mug, which Shannon would send to anyone who (intentionally or otherwise) provided useful information. According to Jeffrey Steinberg, former Technical Editor of ''Digital Review'', the signature on the mug was in the handwriting of Deborah McDonald, the publication's managing edtior at the time. In fact, a "Charlie
