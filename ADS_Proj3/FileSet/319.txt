and is progressively lowered until a bidder indicates that he is prepared to buy at the current price. He or she wins the auction and pays the price at which they bid. Most auction theory revolves around these four "standard" auction types. However, other auction types have also received some academic study, such as: * [[All-pay auction]]s in which bidders place their bid in a sealed envelope and simultaneously hand them to the auctioneer. The envelopes are opened and the individual with the highest bid wins, paying a price equal to the exact amount that he or she bid. All losing bidders are also required to make a payment to the auctioneer equal to their own bid in an all-pay auction. This auction format is non-standard, but can be used to understand things such as election campaigns (in which bids can be interpreted as campaign spending) or queuing for a scarce commodity (in which your bid is the amount of time for which you are prepared to queue). * [[Amsterdam auction|Amsterdam auctions (Amsterdam auctions)]] in which the auction consists of two phases. An open ascending phase, followed by an open descending phase. The descending phase starts with a multitude of the winning price of the ascending phase to deter all bidders. The winner of the ascending phase always gets a percentage revenue of the winning price in that phase. If the winner in the descending phase is the same person, he or she will get a reduction of the highest bid by the percentage of the winning price in the ascending phase. * [[Unique bid auction]]s * Many [[homogenous item auction]]s, e.g., [[spectrum auction]]s * [[Simultaneous multiple-round auction]]s * [[Position auction]]s *[[Generalized second-price auction]] *[[Menu auction]] *[[Ascending package auction]] ==Game-theoretic models== A game-theoretic auction model is a [[Game theory#Representation of games|mathematical game]] represented by a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of players, a set of actions ([[Strategy|strategies]]) available to each player, and a payoff [[vector (geometric)|vector]] corresponding to each [[combination]] of strategies. Generally, the players are the buyer(s) and the seller(s). The action set of each player is a set of bid [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] or [[reservation price]]s. Each bid function maps the player's [[Value (economics)|value]] (in the case of a buyer) or [[cost]] (in the case of a seller) to a bid [[price]]. The payoff of each player under a combination of strategies is the [[Expected utility hypothesis|expected utility]] (or [[Expected value|expected]] profit) of that player under that combination of strategies. Game-theoretic models of auctions and strategic bidding generally fall into either of the following two categories. In a [[private values auction model|private value model]], each participant (bidder) assumes that each of the [[Competition|competing]] bidders obtains a [[random]] ''private value'' from a [[probability distribution]]. In a [[Common value auction|common value]] model, each participant assumes that any other participant obtains a random signal from a probability distribution common to all bidders. Usually, but not always, a private values model assumes that the values are [[Statistical independence|independent]] across bidders, whereas a common value model usually assumes that the values are independent up to the common [[parameter]]s of the probability distribution. [[Image:EnumaElish102.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Ex-post equilibrium in a simple auction market.]]When it is necessary to make explicit assumptions about bidders' value [[Probability distribution|distributions]], most of the published research assumes [[Symmetric game|symmetric]] bidders. This means that the probability distribution from which the bidders obtain their values (or signals) is identical across bidders. In a private values model which assumes independence, symmetry implies that the bidders' values are [[I.i.d.|independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.)]]. An important example (which does not assume independence) is [[Paul Milgrom|Milgrom]] and [[Robert J. Weber|Weber]]'s "general symmetric model" (1982).<ref>Milgrom, P., and R.
