California, San Diego; University of California, Santa Barbara; University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign; University of Minnesota; University of Nevada, Reno; and the University of Texas, Austin. The equipment sites (labs) and a central data repository are connected to the global earthquake engineering community via the NEEShub, which is powered by the HUBzero software developed at [[Purdue University]] specifically to help the scientific community share resources and collaborate. The cyberinfrastructure, connected via Internet2, provides interactive simulation tools, a simulation tool development area, a curated central data repository, animated presentations, user support, telepresence, mechanism for uploading and sharing resources and statistics about users, and usage patterns. This cyberinfrastructure allows researchers to: securely store, organize and share data within a standardized framework in a central location; remotely observe and participate in experiments through the use of synchronized real-time data and video; collaborate with colleagues to facilitate the planning, performance, analysis, and publication of research experiments; and conduct computational and hybrid simulations that may combine the results of multiple distributed experiments and link physical experiments with computer simulations to enable the investigation of overall system performance. These resources jointly provide the means for collaboration and discovery to improve the seismic design and performance of civil and mechanical infrastructure systems. == What is Cyberinfrastructure? == [[Cyberinfrastructure]] is an [[infrastructure]] based on [[computer networks]] and application-specific software, tools, and data repositories that support research in a particular discipline. The term "cyberinfrastructure" was coined by the National Science Foundation to answer the question: how can NSF, as the nation's premier agency funding basic research, remove existing barriers to the rapid evolution of high performance computing, making it truly usable by all the nation's scientists and [[engineers]]? ==External links== *[http://nees.org/about/cyberinfrastructure/ NEEScomm IT Official Website] *[http://www.youtube.com/neesit NEEScomm IT YouTube Channel] Earthquake Engineering Community *[http://nees.org/ NEES Official Website] *[http://nsf.gov/ National Science Foundation] [[Category:E-Science]] [[Category:Cyberinfrastructure]] [[Category:Earthquake engineering]] [[ru:Сеть инженерно-сейсмического моделирования]] [[simple:NEES]]</text> </page> <page> <id>25599</id> <title>NESL</title> <text>'''NESL''' is a parallel [[programming language]] developed at [[Carnegie Mellon]] by the SCandAL project and released in 1993. It integrates various ideas from [[parallel algorithm]]s, and [[functional (programming)|functional programming]] and [[array programming]] languages. The most important new ideas behind NESL are *'''Nested data parallelism''': this feature offers the benefits of data parallelism, concise code that is easy to understand and debug, while being well suited for irregular algorithms, such as algorithms on trees, graphs or sparse matrices. *'''A language based performance model''': this gives a formal way to calculate the work and depth of a program. These measures can be related to running time on parallel machines. The main design guideline for NESL was to make parallel programming easy and portable. Algorithms are typically significantly more concise in NESL than in most other parallel programming languages, and the code closely resembles high-level pseudocode. ==External links== *[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~scandal/nesl.html NESL homepage] {{compu-lang-stub}} [[Category:Array programming languages]] [[Category:Functional languages]] [[Category:Concurrent programming languages]] [[Category:Common Lisp software]]</text> </page> <page> <id>25601</id> <title>NESSUS Probabilistic Analysis Software</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=February 2009}} :''For other uses of the word "Nessus", please refer to [[Nessus]].'' '''NESSUS''' is a general-purpose, [[probabilistic analysis]] program that simulates variations and uncertainties in loads, geometry, material behavior and other user-defined inputs to compute probability of failure and probabilistic sensitivity measures of engineered systems. Because NESSUS uses highly efficient and accurate probabilistic analysis methods, probabilistic solutions can be obtained even for extremely large and complex models. The system performance can be hierarchically decomposed into multiple smaller models and/or analytical equations. Once the probabilistic response is quantified, the results can be used to support risk-informed decisions regarding reliability for safety critical and one-of-a-kind systems, and to maintain a level of quality while reducing manufacturing costs for larger quantity products. NESSUS is interfaced to all major commercial [[finite element]] programs and includes capabilities for analyzing computationally intensive real-world problems. It has been successfully applied to a diverse range of problems in aerospace, gas turbine engines, biomechanics, pipelines, defense, weaponry and infrastructure. == Project History == NESSUS was originally developed by a team led by [[Southwest Research Institute]] (SwRI) as part of a 10-year [[NASA]] project to develop a probabilistic design tool for the [[space shuttle]] main engine. In 1999, SwRI was contracted by [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] (LANL) to adapt NESSUS for application to extremely large and complex weapon reliability problems in support of its [[Stockpile stewardship|Stockpile Stewardship]] program. In 2002, SwRI was contracted by the NASA [[Glenn Research Center]] to further enhance NESSUS for application to large-scale, aero-propulsion system problems. The end result of these two large programs was a completely redesigned software tool — NESSUS Version 8.2 — that includes a graphical user interface, three-dimensional probability contouring and results visualization, capabilities for performing advanced design of experiments and sensitivity analysis, a probabilistic input database, and interfaces to many new third-party codes such as [[ABAQUS]], [[ANSYS]], [[LS-DYNA]], MSC.NASTRAN and ParaDyn. == Applications == NESSUS can compute the probabilistic response or [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] of virtually any engineered system where mathematical models can be developed to describe the performance of the system. NESSUS has been applied to a diverse range of problems including [[Aerospace engineering|aerospace structures]], [[Automotive engineering|automotive structures]], [[biomechanics]], [[Gas Turbine|gas turbine engines]], [[geomechanics]], [[Nuclear_fuel_cycle#Back_end|nuclear waste packaging]], [[Offshore construction|offshore structures]], [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] and [[rotordynamics]]. Recent specific applications of NESSUS include: * Aircraft Control Lever Fatigue * Automotive Crankshaft High-Cycle Fatigue * Cervical Spine Impact Injury * Tunnel Vulnerability Assessment * Orthopaedic Implant Cement Loosening * Stochastic Crashworthiness in Head-on Impact * Nuclear Weapon System Verification and Validation * Pipeline Reliability Assessment * Space Shuttle Main Engine Flow Line == External links == * [http://www.lanl.gov/news/index.php/fuseaction/home.story/story_id/6852 Laboratory captures four R&D Awards] * [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6V54-4FH0W38-1&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=eceae7af17833711bd88ce173b854367 Probabilistic engineering analysis using the NESSUS software (Structural Safety, Vol. 28, Issues 1-2, Jan-Apr 2006)] * [http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/Spinoff2005/ct_8.html Structural Analysis Made 'NESSUSary' (NASA Spinoff 2005)] * [http://www.swri.org/3pubs/ttoday/Summer05/Numbers.htm "Running the Numbers", from Technology Today, Summer 2005] * [http://www.nessus.com NESSUS home page] [[Category:Statistical software]]</text> </page> <page> <id>25612</id> <title>NForce</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}} {{lowercase|title=nForce}} {| align=right class="wikitable" !colspan=2 align=right|[[Nvidia]] nForce |- |colspan=2|[[Image:Nforce.png|160px|Nvidia nForce logo]] |- |- !Successor |[[nForce2]] |} The '''nForce''' is a [[motherboard]] [[chipset]] created by [[Nvidia]] for [[AMD]] [[Athlon]] and [[Duron]] [[microprocessor]]s.
