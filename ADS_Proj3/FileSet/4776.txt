active topic of research. Two well-known wiki conferences are *The International Symposium on Wikis ([[WikiSym]]), a [[academic conference|conference]] dedicated to wiki [[research]] and practice in general. *[[Wikimania]], a conference dedicated to research and practice of [[Wikimedia Foundation]] projects like Wikipedia. ==Rules== Wikis typically have a set of rules governing user behavior. Wikipedia, for instance, has an intricate set of policies and guidelines summed up in its five pillars: Wikipedia is an encyclopedia; Wikipedia has a neutral point of view; Wikipedia is free content; Wikipedians should interact in a respectful and civil manner; and Wikipedia does not have firm rules. Many wikis have adopted a set of commandments. For instance, [[Conservapedia]] commands, among other things, that its editors use "[[Before Christ|B.C.]]" rather than "[[B.C.E.]]" when referring to years prior to the common era and refrain from "unproductive activity."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conservapedia.com/Conservapedia:Commandments |title=Conservapedia.com |publisher=Conservapedia.com |date=2010-05-15 |accessdate=2010-07-24}}</ref> One teacher instituted a commandment for the class wiki, "[[The Golden Rule|Wiki unto others as you would have them wiki unto you]]."<ref name=Augar/> ==Legal environment== Joint authorship of articles, in which different users participate in correcting, editing, and compiling the finished product, can also cause editors to become [[tenants in common]] of the copyright, making it impossible to republish without the permission of all co-owners, some of whose identities may be unknown due to pseudonymous or anonymous editing.<ref name=Legal/> However, where persons contribute to a collective work such as an encyclopedia, there is no joint ownership if the contributions are separate and distinguishable.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Redwood Music Ltd v. B Feldman & Co Ltd|year=1979|reporter=RPC|opinion=385}}</ref> Despite most wikis' tracking of individual contributions, the action of contributing to a wiki page is still arguably one of jointly correcting, editing, or compiling which would give rise to joint ownership. Some copyright issues can be alleviated through the use of an [[open content]] license. Version 2 of the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] includes a specific provision for wiki relicensing; [[Creative Commons]] licenses are also popular. When no license is specified, an implied license to read and add content to a wiki may be deemed to exist on the grounds of [[business necessity]] and the inherent nature of a wiki, although the legal basis for such an implied license may not exist in all circumstances. Wikis and their users can be held liable for certain activities that occur on the wiki. If a wiki owner displays indifference and forgoes controls (such as banning copyright infringers) that he could have exercised to stop copyright infringement, he may be deemed to have authorized infringement, especially if the wiki is primarily used to infringe copyrights or obtains direct financial benefit, such as advertising revenue, from infringing activities.<ref name=Legal/> In the United States, wikis may benefit from Section 230 of the [[Communications Decency Act]], which protects sites that engage in "[[Good Samaritan]]" policing of harmful material, with no requirement on the quality or quantity of such self-policing.<ref>{{citation|title=Self-Regulation: How Wikipedia Leverages User-Generated Quality Control Under Section 230|author=Kathleen M. Walsh & Sarah Oh|date=23 February 2010|url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=sarah_oh}}</ref> However, it has also been argued that a wiki's enforcement of certain rules, such as anti-bias, verifiability, reliable sourcing, and no-original-research policies, could pose legal risks.<ref>{{citation|author=Myers, Ken|title=Wikimmunity: Fitting the Communications Decency Act to Wikipedia|publisher=The Berkman Center for Internet and Society|year=2008}}</ref> When [[defamation]] occurs on a wiki, theoretically all users of the wiki can be held liable, because any of them had the ability to remove or amend the defamatory material from the "publication." It remains to be seen whether wikis will be regarded as more akin to an [[internet service provider]], which is generally not held liable due to its lack of control over publications' contents, than a publisher.<ref name=Legal/> It has been recommended that [[trademark]] owners monitor what information is presented about their trademarks on wikis, since courts may use such content as evidence pertaining to public perceptions. Jarvis notes, "Once misinformation is identified, the trade mark owner can simply edit the entry."<ref>{{citation|publisher=Managing Intellectual Property|issue=179|author=Jarvis, Joshua|title=Police your marks in a wiki world|date=May 2008}}</ref> ==See also== * [[Comparison of wiki software]] * [[Content management system]] * [[Mass collaboration]] * [[Universal Edit Button]] * [[Wikis and education]] ==References== {{Reflist|colwidth=30em}} *{{citation|title=Wiki: Web Collaboration|last=Ebersbach|first= Anja|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|year=2008|isbn=3540351507}} ==Further reading== {{refbegin}} * {{Citation|title=The Wiki Way: Quick Collaboration on the Web|author=Leuf, Bo|publisher=[[Addison–Wesley]]|date=2001-04-13|isbn=020171499X}} * {{Citation|title=Wikipatterns|author=Mader, Stewart|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|date=2007-12-10|isbn=0470223626}} * {{Citation|title=Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything|author=Tapscott, Don|publisher=Portfolio Hardcover|date=2008-04-17|isbn=1591841933}} {{refend}} ==External links== {{Spoken Wikipedia|En-Wiki2.ogg|2007-03-14}} {{wikiversity-inline}} {{commons-inline|wiki}} *[http://wikiindex.org WikiIndex.org] a wiki directory of wikis. *[http://www.artima.com/intv/wiki.html Exploring with Wiki] An interview with [[Ward Cunningham]], by Bill Verners. *[http://www.wikimatrix.org/ WikiMatrix] website for comparing wiki software and hosts {{Wiki topics|state=expanded}} {{Computer-mediated communication}} <!-- INFOBOX: OFF --> <!-- PLURALITY: OFF --> [[Category:Wikis| ]] [[Category:Hawaiian words and phrases]] [[Category:Human–computer interaction]] [[Category:Hypertext]] [[Category:Self-organization]] [[Category:Social information processing]] [[af:Wiki]] [[als:Wiki]] [[ar:ويكي]] [[an:Wiki]] [[az:Viki]] [[bm:Wiki]] [[bn:উইকি]] [[zh-min-nan:Wiki]] [[be:Вікі]] [[be-x-old:Вікі]] [[bar:Wiki]] [[bs:Wiki]] [[br:Wiki]] [[bg:Уики]] [[ca:Wiki]] [[cv:Вики]] [[ceb:Wiki]] [[cs:Wiki]] [[co:Wiki]] [[cy:Wici]] [[da:Wiki]] [[de:Wiki]] [[et:Viki]] [[el:Wiki]] [[es:Wiki]] [[eo:Vikio]] [[eu:Wiki]] [[fa:ویکی‌ویکی]] [[fo:WikiWiki]] [[fr:Wiki]] [[fur:Wiki]] [[ga:Vicí]] [[gl:Wiki]] [[xal:Бики]] [[ko:위키]] [[hy:Վիքի]] [[hi:विकि]] [[hr:Wiki]] [[ig:Wiki]] [[id:Wiki]] [[ia:Wiki]] [[iu:ᐅᐃᑭ/uiki]] [[it:Wiki]] [[he:ויקי]] [[ka:ვიკი]] [[sw:Wiki]] [[la:Vici]] [[lv:Wiki]] [[lb:Wiki]] [[lt:Wiki]] [[li:Wiki]] [[hu:Wiki]] [[mk:Вики]] [[mg:Wiki]] [[ml:വിക്കി]] [[mt:Wiki]] [[arz:ويكى]] [[ms:Wiki]] [[mn:Вики]] [[nah:Wiki]] [[nl:Wiki]] [[nds-nl:Wiki]] [[ne:विकि]] [[ja:ウィキ]] [[no:Wiki]] [[nn:Wiki]] [[nrm:Ouitchi]] [[oc:Wiki]] [[nds:Wiki]] [[pl:Wiki]] [[pnt:Wiki]] [[pt:Wiki]] [[ksh:Wikki]] [[ro:Wiki]] [[qu:Wiki]] [[ru:Вики]] [[sc:Wiki]] [[sq:Wiki]] [[scn:Wiki]] [[si:විකි]] [[simple:Wiki]] [[sk:Wiki]] [[sl:Wiki]] [[so:WikiWiki]] [[sr:Вики]] [[sh:Wiki]] [[su:Wiki]] [[fi:Wiki]] [[sv:Wiki]] [[tl:Wiki]] [[ta:விக்கி]] [[tt:Wiki]] [[te:వికీ]] [[th:วิกิ]] [[tg:Вики]] [[tr:Wiki]] [[uk:Вікі]] [[vi:Wiki]] [[fiu-vro:Viki]] [[zh-classical:共筆]] [[yi:וויקי]] [[yo:Wiki]] [[zh-yue:Wiki]] [[diq:Wiki]] [[bat-smg:Wiki]] [[zh:Wiki]]</text> </page> <page> <id>40120</id> <title>WikiMapia</title> <text>{{Infobox Website | name = WikiMapia | screenshot = [[Image:Wikimapia.png|220px]] | caption = WikiMapia as seen in [[Firefox]] with fullscreen mode | url = [http://www.wikimapia.org/ www.wikimapia.org] | slogan = Let's describe the whole World! | commercial = Yes | type = [[Collaborative mapping]] | language = 101 languages, including English | registration = Optional | author = [[Alexandre Koriakine]] and [[Evgeniy Saveliev]] | launch date = May 24, 2006 | alexa = 1,082 ({{As of|2010|12|alt=December 2010}})<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main/wikimapia.org | title=wikimapia.org - Site Information from Alexa | accessdate=2010-12-08}}</ref> | current status = Active | revenue = From [[AdSense]] | content license = [[Creative_Commons_licenses|Creative Commons(by-nc-sa)]]. <ref>http://wikimapia.org/terms_reference.html</ref> }} '''WikiMapia''' is a privately owned, online [[map]] and
