All of these systems should communicate with each other (or "interface") when they receive new information but not all do so. HL7 specifies a number of flexible standards, guidelines, and methodologies by which various healthcare systems can communicate with each other. Such guidelines or data standards are a set of rules that allow information to be shared and processed in a uniform and consistent manner. These data standards are meant to allow healthcare organizations to easily share clinical information. Theoretically, this ability to exchange information should help to minimize the tendency for medical care to be geographically isolated and highly variable.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} HL7 develops conceptual standards (e.g., HL7 [[Reference Information Model|RIM]]), document standards (e.g., HL7 [[Clinical Document Architecture|CDA]]), application standards (e.g., HL7 [[CCOW]]), and messaging standards (e.g., HL7 v2.x and v3.0). Messaging standards are particularly important because they define how information is packaged and communicated from one party to another. Such standards set the language, structure and data types required for seamless integration from one system to another.<ref>http://www.chcf.org/documents/CCDPProjectOverview.pdf</ref> HL7 encompasses the complete life cycle of a standards specification including the development, adoption, market recognition, utilization, and adherence. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Business use of the HL7 standards requires a paid organizational membership in HL7 Inc. HL7 Members can access standards for free and non members can buy the standards from HL7 or ANSI. ===HL7 version 2.x=== The HL7 version 2 standard has the aim to support hospital workflows. It was originally created in 1989.<ref>http://www.hl7.org/about/FAQs/index.cfm?ref=nav HL7 FAQ</ref> '''V2.x Messaging''' HL7 version 2 defines a series of electronic messages to support administrative, logistical, financial as well as clinical processes. Since 1987 the standard has been updated regularly, resulting in versions 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.3.1, 2.4, 2.5, 2.5.1 and 2.6. The v2.x standards are backward compatible (i.e. a message based on version 2.3 will be understood by an application that supports version 2.6). HL7 v2.x mostly uses a textual, non-XML encoding syntax based on delimiters. HL7 v2.x has allowed for the [[interoperability]] between electronic Patient Administration Systems (PAS), Electronic Practice Management (EPM) systems, Laboratory Information Systems (LIS), Dietary, Pharmacy and Billing systems as well as [[Electronic Medical Record]] (EMR) or [[Electronic Health Record]] (EHR) systems. Currently, HL7â€™s v2.x messaging standard is supported by every major medical information systems vendor in the United States.<ref>[http://aspe.hhs.gov/sp/nhii/standards.html Standards Organizations]</ref> ===HL7 version 3=== The HL7 version 3 standard has the aim to support all healthcare workflows. Development of version 3 started around 1995, resulting in an initial standard publication in 2005. The v3 standard, as opposed to version 2, is based on a formal methodology (the HDF) and object oriented principles. '''RIM - [[ISO]]/HL7 21731''' The [http://www.hl7.org/library/data-model/RIM/modelpage_mem.htm Reference Information Model] (RIM) is the cornerstone of the HL7 Version 3 development process and an essential part of the HL7 V3 development methodology. RIM expresses the data content needed in a specific clinical or administrative context and provides an explicit representation of the [[semantic]] and [[lexical]] connections that exist between the information carried in the fields of HL7 messages. The RIM is essential to increase precision and reduce implementation costs. [http://www.hl7.org/library/data-model/met/modelpage.html Models] are available. '''HL7 Development Framework - [[ISO]]/HL7 27931''' The HL7 Version 3 Development Framework (HDF) is a continuously evolving process that seeks to develop specifications that facilitate interoperability between healthcare systems. The HL7 RIM, vocabulary specifications, and model-driven process of analysis and design combine to make HL7 Version 3 one methodology for development of consensus-based standards for healthcare information system [[interoperability]]. The HDF is the most current edition of the HL7 V3 development methodology. The HDF not only documents messaging, but also the processes, tools, actors, rules, and artifacts relevant to development of all HL7 standard specifications. Eventually, the HDF will encompass all of the HL7 standard specifications, including any new standards resulting from analysis of electronic health record architectures and requirements. HL7 specifications draw upon codes and vocabularies from a variety of sources. The V3 vocabulary work ensures that the systems implementing HL7 specifications have an unambiguous understanding of the code sources and code value domains they are using. '''V3 Messaging''' The HL7 version 3 messaging standard defines a series of electronic messages (called ''interactions'') to support all healthcare workflows. HL7 v3 messages are based on an XML encoding syntax. '''V3 Clinical Document Architecture - [[ISO]] 10781''' The HL7 version 3 [[Clinical Document Architecture]] (CDA) is an XML-based markup standard intended to specify the encoding, structure and semantics of clinical documents for exchange. *See [[Clinical Document Architecture]] for details. ==Methods applied by HL7== ===Services Aware Interoperability Framework=== The HL7 Services-Aware Enterprise Architecture Framework (SAIF) provides consistency between all HL7 artifacts, and enables a standardized approach to Enterprise Architecture (EA) development and implementation, and a way to measure the consistency. SAIF is a way of thinking about producing specifications that explicitly describe the governance, conformance, compliance, and behavioral semantics that are needed to achieve computable semantic working interoperability. The intended information transmission technology might use a messaging, document exchange, or services approach. SAIF is the framework that is required to rationalize interoperability of other standards. SAIF is an architecture for achieving interoperability, but it is not a whole-solution design for enterprise architecture management. === Arden syntax === The [[Arden syntax]] is a language for encoding medical knowledge. HL7 adopted and oversees the standard beginning with Arden syntax 2.0. These [[Medical logic module|Medical Logic Modules]] ([[Medical logic module|MLM]]s) are used in the clinical setting as they can contain sufficient knowledge to make single medical decisions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} They can produce alerts, diagnoses, and interpretations along with quality assurance function and administrative support. An [[Medical logic module|MLM]] must run on a computer that meets the minimum
