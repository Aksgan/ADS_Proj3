Users of zembly interacted with one another via zembly's social networking features to engage in co-development of applications for these platforms. In addition to the development environment, the zembly platform, provided the ability to consume Web APIs ([[RESTful|RESTful web services]]) in zembly applications as well as externally using the open source zembly client library (with language bindings for [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[JavaFx]]). This functionality provided a consistent programming model across various API providers. Zembly combined features from traditional [[Integrated Development Environment|IDE]]s (such as a rich scripting editor) with wiki- and social-networking-based technologies to attempt to innovate on the application development paradigm for smaller-sized applications. Applications created at zembly were automatically and transparently deployed, hosted, and scaled on its underlying [[cloud computing]] infrastructure. == Architecture == Zembly was run as a product within [[Sun Microsystems]]'s cloud computing organization, with the hosting of the website and developer applications provided by [[Network.com]]'s compute cloud. It was built on a stack consisting largely of Sun technologies, including [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] 10, [[Java (programming language)|Java]], the [[GlassFish]] application server, and [[MySQL]]. The software stack ran on a horizontally scaled cluster of [[Sun Fire]] T2000 ("Niagara") and [[X4500]] ("Thumper") servers. In addition, zembly used [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] and [[memcached]]. Zembly had also incorporated (and contributed to) [[Mozilla Bespin]]. == Closure == In November 2009 zembly announced that the site would be closed on 2009-11-30 and that "once the site is shutdown, all your applications and services on zembly will be unavailable".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zembly.com/static/suspend/index.html|title=Zembly Shutdown Notice|accessdate=2009-11-10}}</ref> Some Zembly developers have expressed frustration about Zembly abandoning them without even open-sourcing their code.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hasin.wordpress.com/2009/11/10/zembly-is-deadpooled-2-5-yrs-of-effort-went-in-vain/|title=zembly is deadpooled â€“ 2.5 yrs of effort went in vain :(|accessdate=2010-03-18}}</ref> == References == {{reflist|2}} ==Further reading== *Anderson, Gail; Anderson, Paul; Fast, Todd; Webster, Chris (December 29, 2008).

''Zendoku'' is a variation of [[Sudoku]], offering a slightly more combative experience than simply lining up numbers. Players must now insert symbols, rather than the standard numbers. Players choose characters and choose to attack or defend against a challenger, which takes place via mini-games started upon filling in a group of numbers. The game is set against [[anime]]-influenced backdrops and has a "light-hearted [[martial arts]]" theme. The game also offers single-player puzzles. ==Reception== The UK Nintendo Magazine, [[ONM]] praised the DS version of the game for its colourful graphics, but criticized it for the confusing system of using symbols instead of numbers. As well as the minigames feeling tacked on and more of an annoyance, and finished by saying, "One for multiplayer only". On the other hand, [[NGamer]] praised the multiplayer game highly, saying, "The thrill of using logical reasoning to kick someone's arse is a phenomenal experience." ==External links== * [http://www.zendokugame.com/ Zendoku home page] * [http://www.zoonami.com/briefing/2006-10-19-zendoku.php "Eidos Announces Zendoku" at Zoonami] * [http://www.eidosinteractive.com/games/info.html?gmid=174 Zendoku page at Eidos Interactive] * [http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/ds/zendoku Zendoku at Metacritic] * [http://garethrees.org/2007/06/10/zendoku-generation/ Programming Behind Zendoku Puzzle Generation] ==References== {{reflist}} {{puzzle-videogame-stub}} [[Category:2007 video games]] [[Category:Puzzle video games]] [[Category:Nintendo DS games]] [[Category:PlayStation Portable games]] [[Category:Sudoku]] [[it:Zendoku]] [[pt:Zendoku]]</text> </page> <page> <id>41026</id> <title>Zeno (programming language)</title> <text>'''Zeno''' (after [[pre-Socratic]] [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Zeno of Elea]]) is an [[imperative (programming)|imperative]] [[procedural (programming)|procedural]] [[programming language]] designed to be easy to learn and user friendly. Zeno is generic in the sense that it contains most of the essential elements used in other languages to develop real applications. The Zeno Interpreter was designed for use in [[Windows 95]] and later [[Microsoft]] operating systems. The interpreter comes with built-in debugging tools, a source code text editor, and an on-line language reference. Zeno was created by Stephen R. Schmitt and is maintained by Abecedarical Systems. ==Example: [[Sieve of Eratosthenes]]== const N : int := 5000 var a : array[N] of boolean program var i, j : int init_a % initialize array for i := 2...floor ( N/2 ) do for j := 2...floor ( N/i ) do a[i*j] := false % mark as not prime end for end for j := 0 for i := 2...N do % output results if a[i] then % is prime put i : 6 ... incr j if (j mod 5) = 0 then % start new line put "" end if end if end for end program % initialize the array procedure init_a var i : int for i := 1...N do a[i] := true end for end procedure Sample output 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89 97 101 103 107 109 113 ==External links== *[http://home.att.net/~srschmitt/zeno.html Home page] {{compu-lang-stub}} [[Category:Procedural programming languages]] [[Category:Educational programming languages]]</text> </page> <page> <id>41029</id> <title>Zentyal</title> <text>{{otheruses|Ebox (disambiguation)}} {{lowercase|eBox}} {{Infobox OS | name = Zentyal (formerly eBox Platform) | family = [[Unix-like]] | logo = [[File:Zentyal_logo.jpg|200px]] | screenshot = [[Image:Zentyal.dashboard.png|290px]] | caption =
