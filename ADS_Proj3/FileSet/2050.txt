A baby learns many cognitive skills by interacting with its environment and other humans using its limbs and senses, and consequently its internal model of the world is largely determined by the form of the human body. The robot was designed to test this hypothesis by allowing cognitive learning scenarios to be acted out by an accurate reproduction of the perceptual system and articulation of a small child so that it could interact with the world in the same way that such a child does.<ref name="iCub paper"/> == Specifications == [[Image:ICub sciencefestival 1.jpg|thumb|left|An iCub at a live demo making facial expressions]] The dimensions of the iCub are similar to that of a 3.5 year old child. The robot is controlled by an on-board [[PC104]] controller which communicates with actuators and sensors using [[Controller area network|CANBus]]. It utilises tendon driven joints for the hand and shoulder, with the fingers flexed by [[teflon]]-coated cable tendons running inside teflon-coated tubes, and pulling against spring returns. Joint angles are measured using custom-designed [[Hall effect|Hall-effect]] sensors and the robot can be equipped with torque sensors. The finger tips can be equipped with tactile touch sensors, and a distributed capacitive sensor skin is being developed. The software library is largely written in C++ and uses [[YARP]] for external communication via Gigabit Ethernet with off-board software implementing higher level functionality, the development of which has been taken over by the RobotCub Consortium.<ref name="iCub paper">{{cite conference | url =http://www.robotcub.org/misc/papers/08_Metta_Sandini_Vernon_etal.pdf | title =The iCub humanoid robot: an open platform for research in embodied cognition | first =Giorgio | last =Metta | author = | coauthors =Sandini Giulio; Vernon David; Natale Lorenzo; Nori Francesco | year =2008 | conference =PerMIS’08 |accessdate=2010-07-39 }}</ref> The robot was not designed for autonomous operation, and is consequently not equipped with onboard batteries or processors required for this &mdash;instead an umbilical cable provides power and a network connection.<ref name="iCub paper"/> In its final version, the robot has 53 actuated [[Degrees of freedom (engineering)|degrees of freedom]] organized as follows: * 7 in each arm * 9 in each hand (3 for the thumb, 2 for the index, 2 for the middle finger, 1 for the coupled ring and little finger, 1 for the adduction/abduction) * 6 in the head (3 for the neck and 3 for the cameras) * 3 in the torso/waist * 6 in each leg The head has stereo cameras in a swivel mounting where eyes would be located on a human and microphones on the side. It also has lines of red LEDs representing mouth and eyes mounted behind the face panel for making facial expressions. Since the first robots were constructed the design has undergone several revisions and improvements, for example smaller and more dexterous hands,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.engadget.com/2010/03/12/icub-gets-upgraded-with-tinier-hands-better-legs/ | title =iCub gets upgraded with tinier hands, better legs | work = Engadget | author = Laura June | date = 12 March 2010 | accessdate=2010-07-30}}</ref> and lighter, more robust legs with greater joint angles and which permit walking rather than just crawling.<ref>{{cite conference|title=The Mechanical Design of the New Lower Body for the Child Humanoid robot 'iCub'|conference=IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation Conference, (ICRA 2009)|last=Tsagarakis | first=N.G. | coauthors=Vanderborght Bram; Laffranchi Matteo; Caldwell D.G|accessdate=2010-07-30|url=http://www.robotcub.org/misc/review5/papers/09_Tsagarakis_etal.pdf}}</ref> == iCubs in the world == There are about twenty iCubs in various laboratories mainly in Europe but also one in the USA. These were built by the RobotCub partners or other projects and form a small but lively community of scientists that use the iCub to study embodied cognition in artificial systems. Most of the financial support comes from the European Commission's Unit E5 or the [[Italian Institute of Technology]] (IIT). The robots are constructed by the IIT and cost €200,000-250,000 each depending upon the version.<ref name="store">{{cite web | url = http://www.icub.org/bazaar.php | work= iCub website | title = http://www.icub.org/bazaar.php | accessdate=2010-07-30}}</ref> == References == {{Reflist}} == External links == * {{cite journal | title = Almost Human | journal = Nature | url =http://www.robotcub.org/index.php/robotcub/content/download/1323/4602/file/nature_icub.pdf | date = 27 August 2009 | accessdate=2010-07-30}} - Nature article about the iCub. * [http://www.youtube.com/profile?gl=US&user=robotcub YouTube Channel] - the YouTube channel about the iCub. * [http://kn.theiet.org/communities/robotics/resources/icub/icub-presentations.cfm iCub presentations] - from the Humanoid robotics symposium 2010. * [http://eris.liralab.it/wiki/The_iCub_IROS_%2710_workshop IROS'10] - Videos and workshop on iCub research. {{DEFAULTSORT:Icub}} [[Category:Humanoid robots]] [[Category:Open source hardware]] [[de:ICub]] [[fr:ICub]] [[it:ICub]] [[pt:ICub]] [[ru:ICub]]</text> </page> <page> <id>17438</id> <title>IDEDOS</title> <text>'''IDEDOS''' is a [[Read-only memory|ROM]]-based disk operating system written in [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]]/[[65816]] assembly language for the [[Commodore 64]], [[Commodore 128|128]] and [[SuperCPU]]. Its main purpose is to control [[Parallel ATA|ATA(PI)]] devices connected to an [[IDE64]] cartridge and present them like normal Commodore drives. Additionally it supports networked drives (PCLink) and has a built-in [[machine code monitor]] and [[file manager]]. ==Architecture== The C64 [[KERNAL]] uses a vector table at page 3 to allow redirection of common kernal file handling and basic functions. This feature is used by IDEDOS to hook into the C64 kernal. The operating system itself is divided into four pages of 16 KiB which are mapped in when required. The mapping is temporarily switched off while interrupts are running for increased compatibility, however this causes a ≈40 μs latency. Additional RAM memory for buffers
