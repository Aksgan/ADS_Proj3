occupied by the fluid is divided into discrete cells (the mesh). The mesh may be uniform or non uniform. ** The physical modeling is defined – for example, the equations of motions + [[enthalpy]] + radiation + species conservation ** Boundary conditions are defined. This involves specifying the fluid behaviour and properties at the boundaries of the problem. For transient problems, the initial conditions are also defined. * The [[computer simulation|simulation]] is started and the equations are solved iteratively as a steady-state or transient. * Finally a postprocessor is used for the analysis and visualization of the resulting solution. ===Discretization methods=== The stability of the chosen discretization is generally established numerically rather than analytically as with simple linear problems. Special care must also be taken to ensure that the discretization handles discontinuous solutions gracefully. The [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] and [[Navier–Stokes equations]] both admit shocks, and contact surfaces. Some of the discretization methods being used are: ==== Finite Volume Method ==== {{Main|Finite volume method}} The finite volume method (FVM) is a common approach used in CFD codes.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The governing equations are solved over discrete control volumes. Finite volume methods recast the governing partial differential equations (typically the Navier-Stokes equations) in a conservative form, and then discretize the new equation. This guarantees the conservation of fluxes through a particular control volume. Though the overall solution will be conservative in nature, there is no guarantee that it is the actual solution.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The finite volume equation yields governing equations in the form, :<math>\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\iiint Q\, dV + \iint F\, d\mathbf{A} = 0,</math> where <math>Q</math> is the vector of conserved variables, <math>F</math> is the vector of fluxes (see [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] or [[Navier–Stokes equations]]), <math>V</math> is the volume of the control volume element, and <math>\mathbf{A}</math> is the surface area of the control volume element. ==== Finite Element Method ==== {{Main|Finite element method}} The finite element method (FEM) is used in structural analysis of solids, but is also applicable to fluids. However, the FEM formulation requires special care to ensure a conservative solution. The FEM formulation has been adapted for use with fluid dynamics governing equations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Although FEM must be carefully formulated to be conservative, it is much more stable than the finite volume approach<ref>{{cite journal | title=k-version of finite element method in gas dynamics: higher-order global differentiability numerical solutions | last1=Surana | first1=K.A. | last2=Allu | first2=S. | last3=Tenpas | first3=P.W. | last4=Reddy | first4=J.N. | journal=International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering | volume=69 | issue=6 | pages=1109–1157 | year=2007 | doi=10.1002/nme.1801 | month=February}}</ref> However, FEM can require more memory than FVM.<ref>{{cite book | author=Huebner, K.

It is currently only used in few specialized codes.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Modern finite difference codes make use of an embedded boundary for handling complex geometries, making these codes highly efficient and accurate.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Other ways to handle geometries include use of overlapping grids, where the solution is interpolated across each grid. :<math> \frac{\partial Q}{\partial t}+ \frac{\partial F}{\partial x}+ \frac{\partial G}{\partial y}+ \frac{\partial H}{\partial z}=0 </math> where <math>Q</math> is the vector of conserved variables, and <math>F</math>, <math>G</math>, and <math>H</math> are the fluxes in the <math>x</math>, <math>y</math>, and <math>z</math> directions respectively. ==== Boundary Element Method ==== {{Main|Boundary element method}} In the boundary element method, the boundary occupied by the fluid is divided into a surface mesh. ==== High Resolution Discretization Schemes ==== {{Main|High-resolution scheme}} High-resolution schemes are used where shocks or discontinuities are present. Capturing sharp changes in the solution requires the use of second or higher-order numerical schemes that do not introduce spurious oscillations. This usually necessitates the application of [[flux limiters]] to ensure that the solution is [[total variation diminishing]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} ===Turbulence models=== {{Expand section| * Models should be listed in some order (increasing cost, increasing accuracy, alphabetically...) * Add the [[One-dimensional turbulence]] model (and its predecessor [[Linear eddy model]]) |date=November 2010}} In studying turbulent flows, the objective is to obtain a theory or a model that can yield quantities of interest, such as velocities. For turbulent flow, the range of length scales and complexity of phenomena make most approaches impossible. The primary approach in this case is to create numerical models to calculate the properties of interest. A selection of some commonly-used computational models for turbulent flows are presented in this section. The chief difficulty in modeling turbulent flows comes from the wide range of length and time scales associated with turbulent flow. As a result, turbulence models can be classified based on the range of these length and time scales that are modeled and the range of length and time scales that are resolved. The more turbulent scales that are resolved, the finer the resolution of the simulation, and therefore the higher the computational cost. If a majority or all of the turbulent scales are modeled, the computational cost is very low, but the tradeoff comes in the form of decreased accuracy. In addition to the wide range of length and time scales and the associated computational cost, the governing equations of fluid dynamics contain a [[Nonlinear system|non-linear]] convection term and a non-linear and non-local pressure gradient term. These nonlinear equations must be solved numerically with the appropriate boundary and initial conditions. ====Direct numerical simulation==== {{main|Direct numerical simulation}} [[Direct numerical simulation]] (DNS) resolves the entire range of turbulent length scales. This marginalizes the effect of models, but is extremely expensive. The computational cost is proportional to <math>Re^{3}</math>.<ref name="Pope_2000">{{cite book|title=Turbulent
