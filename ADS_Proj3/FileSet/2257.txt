abstractly in an arbitrary [[category (mathematics)|category]] by means of a [[universal property]]. Let (''X''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub>) be an inverse system of objects and [[morphism]]s in a category ''C'' (same definition as above). The '''inverse limit''' of this system is an object ''X'' in ''C'' together with morphisms &pi;<sub>''i''</sub>: ''X'' &rarr; ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> (called ''projections'') satisfying &pi;<sub>''i''</sub> = ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub> <small>o</small> &pi;<sub>''j''</sub> for all ''i'' &le; ''j''. The pair (''X'', &pi;<sub>''i''</sub>) must be universal in the sense that for any other such pair (''Y'', &psi;<sub>''i''</sub>) there exists a unique morphism ''u'': ''Y'' &rarr; ''X'' making all the "obvious" identities true; i.e., the diagram <div style="text-align: center;">[[Image:InverseLimit-01.png]]</div> must [[commutative diagram|commute]] for all ''i'' &le; ''j''. The inverse limit is often denoted :<math>X = \varprojlim X_i</math> with the inverse system (''X''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub>) being understood. Unlike for algebraic objects, the inverse limit might not exist in an arbitrary category. If it does, however, it is unique in a strong sense: given any other inverse limit ''X''&prime; there exists a ''unique'' [[isomorphism]] ''X''&prime; &rarr; ''X'' commuting with the projection maps. We note that an inverse system in a category ''C'' admits an alternative description in terms of [[functor]]s. Any partially ordered set ''I'' can be considered as a [[small category]] where the morphisms consist of arrows ''i'' &rarr; ''j'' [[if and only if]] ''i'' &le; ''j''. An inverse system is then just a [[contravariant functor]] ''I'' &rarr; ''C''. And the inverse limit functor <math>\varprojlim:C^{I^{op}}\rightarrow C</math> is a [[covariant functor]]. == Examples == * The ring of [[p-adic number|''p''-adic integers]] is the inverse limit of the rings '''Z'''/''p''<sup>''n''</sup>'''Z''' (see [[modular arithmetic]]) with the index set being the [[natural number]]s with the usual order, and the morphisms being "take remainder". The natural topology on the ''p''-adic integers is the same as the one described here. * The ring <math>\textstyle R[[t]]</math> of [[formal power series]] over a commutative ring ''R'' can be thought of as the inverse limit of the rings <math>\textstyle R[t]/t^nR[t]</math>, indexed by the natural numbers as usually ordered, with the morphisms from <math>\textstyle R[t]/t^{n+j}R[t]</math> to <math>\textstyle R[t]/t^nR[t]</math> given by the natural projection. * [[Pro-finite group]]s are defined as inverse limits of (discrete) finite groups. * Let the index set ''I'' of an inverse system (''X''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub>) have a [[greatest element]] ''m''. Then the natural projection &pi;<sub>''m''</sub>: ''X'' &rarr; ''X''<sub>''m''</sub> is an isomorphism. * Inverse limits in the [[category of topological spaces]] are given by placing the [[initial topology]] on the underlying set-theoretic inverse limit. This is known as the '''limit topology'''. ** The set of infinite [[String (computer science)|strings]] is the inverse limit of the set of finite strings, and is thus endowed with the limit topology. As the original spaces are [[discrete topology|discrete]], the limit space is [[totally disconnected]]. This is one way of realizing the [[p-adic|''p''-adic numbers]] and the [[Cantor set]] (as infinite strings). * Let (''I'', =) be the trivial order (not directed). The inverse limit of any corresponding inverse system is just the [[product (category theory)|product]]. * Let ''I'' consist of three elements ''i'', ''j'', and ''k'' with ''i'' &le; ''j'' and ''i'' &le; ''k'' (not directed). The inverse limit of any corresponding inverse system is the [[pullback (category theory)|pullback]]. ==Derived functors of the inverse limit== For an [[abelian category]] ''C'', the inverse limit functor :<math>\varprojlim:C^I\rightarrow C</math> is [[Exact functor|left exact]]. If ''I'' is ordered (not simply partially ordered) and [[countable]], and ''C'' is the category '''Ab''' of abelian groups, the Mittag-Leffler condition is a condition on the transition morphisms ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub> that ensures the exactness of <math>\varprojlim</math>. Specifically, [[Samuel Eilenberg|Eilenberg]] constructed a functor :<math>\varprojlim{}^1:\operatorname{Ab}^I\rightarrow\operatorname{Ab}</math> (pronounced "lim one") such that if (''A''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub>), (''B''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''g''<sub>''ij''</sub>), and (''C''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''h''<sub>''ij''</sub>) are three projective systems of abelian groups, and :<math>0\rightarrow A_i\rightarrow B_i\rightarrow C_i\rightarrow0</math> is a [[short exact sequence]] of inverse systems, then :<math>0\rightarrow\varprojlim A_i\rightarrow\varprojlim B_i\rightarrow\varprojlim C_i\rightarrow\varprojlim{}^1A_i</math> is an exact sequence in '''Ab'''. An inverse system of abelian groups (''A''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub>) is said to satisfy the Mittag-Leffler condition if for every ''k'' there exists ''j'' ≥ ''k'' such that for all ''i'' ≥ ''j'' :<math> f_{kj}(A_j)=f_{ki}(A_i).</math> For example, a system in which the morphisms ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub> are surjective satisfies the Mittag-Leffler condition. If (''A''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub>) satisfies the Mittag-Leffler condition, then :<math>\varprojlim{}^1A_i=0.</math> An example where this is non-zero is obtained by taking ''I'' to be the non-negative [[integer]]s, letting ''A''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''p''<sup>''i''</sup>'''Z''', ''B''<sub>''i''</sub> = '''Z''', and ''C''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''B''<sub>''i''</sub> / ''A''<sub>''i''</sub> = '''Z'''/''p''<sup>''i''</sup>'''Z'''. Then :<math>\varprojlim{}^1A_i=\mathbf{Z}_p/\mathbf{Z}</math> where '''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub> denotes the [[p-adic integers]]. More generally, if ''C'' is an arbitrary abelian category that has [[Injective object#Enough injectives|enough injectives]], then so does ''C''<sup>''I''</sup>, and the right [[derived functors]] of the inverse limit functor can thus be defined. The ''n''th right derived functor is denoted :<math>R^n\varprojlim:C^I\rightarrow C.</math> In the case where ''C'' satisfies [[Grothendieck]]'s axiom [[Abelian category#Grothendieck's axioms|(AB4*)]], [[Jan-Erik Roos]] generalized the functor lim<sup>1</sup> on '''Ab'''<sup>''I''</sup> to series of functors lim<sup>n</sup> such that :<math>\varprojlim{}^n\cong R^n\varprojlim.</math> It was thought for almost 40 years that Roos had proved (in ''Sur les foncteurs dérivés de lim. Applications. '') that lim<sup>1</sup> ''A''<sub>''i''</sub> = 0 for (''A''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub>) an inverse system with surjective transition morphisms and ''I'' the set of non-negative integers (such inverse systems are often called "[[Mittag-Leffler]] sequences"). However, in 2002, [[Amnon Neeman]] and [[Pierre Deligne]] constructed an example of such a system in a category satisfying (AB4) (in addition to (AB4*)) with lim<sup>1</sup> ''A''<sub>''i''</sub> ≠ 0. Roos has since shown (in "Derived functors of inverse limits revisited") that his result is correct if ''C'' has a set of generators (in addition to satisfying (AB3) and (AB4*)). [[Barry Mitchell (mathematician)|Barry Mitchell]] has shown (in "The cohomological dimension of a directed set") that if ''I'' has [[cardinality]] <math>\aleph_d</math> (the ''d''th [[Aleph number|infinite cardinal]]), then ''R''<sup>''n''</sup>lim is zero for all ''n'' ≥ ''d'' + 2. This applies to the ''I''-indexed diagrams in the category of ''R''-modules, with ''R'' a commutative ring; it is not necessarily true in an arbitrary abelian category (see Roos' "Derived functors of inverse limits revisited" for examples of abelian categories in which lim^n, on diagrams indexed by a countable set, is nonzero for n>1). == Related
