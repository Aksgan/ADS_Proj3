These laws are difficult or impossible to enforce in anonymous P2P networks. ===Anonymous online money=== With [[anonymous money]], it becomes possible to arrange anonymous markets where one can buy and sell just about anything anonymously. Anonymous money could be used to avoid [[tax]] collection. However, any transfer of physical goods between two parties could compromise anonymity.<ref name="cymru">Rob Thomas, Jerry Martin (2006).

Retrieved 2008-01-20.</ref> Some{{Who|date=April 2010}} argue that conventional [[cash]] provides a similar kind of anonymity, and that existing laws are adequate to combat crimes like [[tax evasion]] that might result from the use of anonymous cash, whether online or offline{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. ==Functioning of anonymous P2P== ===Anonymity and pseudonymity=== Some of the networks commonly referred to as "anonymous P2P" are truly anonymous, in the sense that network nodes carry no identifiers. Others are actually [[pseudonymity|pseudonymous]]: instead of being identified by their [[Internet Protocol|IP addresses]], nodes are identified by pseudonyms such as cryptographic keys. For example, each node in the [[MUTE]] network has an overlay address that is derived from its [[public-key cryptography|public key]]. This overlay address functions as a pseudonym for the node, allowing messages to be addressed to it. In [[Freenet]], on the other hand, messages are routed using keys that identify specific pieces of data rather than specific nodes; the nodes themselves are anonymous. The term ''anonymous'' is used to describe both kinds of network because it is difficult—if not impossible—to determine whether a node that sends a message originated the message or is simply forwarding it on behalf of another node. Every node in an anonymous P2P network acts as a universal sender and universal receiver to maintain anonymity. If a node was only a receiver and did not send, then neighbouring nodes would know that the information it was requesting was for itself only, removing any [[plausible deniability]] that it was the recipient (and consumer) of the information. Thus, in order to remain anonymous, nodes must ferry information for others on the network. ===Spam and DoS attacks in anonymous networks=== Originally, anonymous networks were operated by small and friendly communities of developers. As interest in anonymous P2P increased and the user base grew, malicious users inevitably appeared and tried different attacks. This is similar to the Internet, where widespread use has been followed by waves of [[spam (electronic)|spam]] and distributed [[denial-of-service attack]]s. Such attacks may require different solutions in anonymous networks. For example, blacklisting of originator network addresses does not work because anonymous networks conceal this information. These networks are more vulnerable to DoS attacks as well due to the smaller bandwidth, as has been shown in examples on the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] network. However, a conspiracy to attack an anonymous network could be considered criminal computer hacking{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. Participants in the network interested in ensuring the continuous availability of it could collaborate to identify the source of abusive traffic, and further investigate or prosecute it. This could be done without compromising the anonymity of data in the network. ==Opennet and darknet network types== {{Main|Friend-to-friend}} Like conventional P2P networks, anonymous P2P networks can implement either opennet or [[Darknet (file sharing)|darknet]] (often named [[friend to friend]]) network type. This describes how a node on the network selects peer nodes: * In opennet network, peer nodes are discovered automatically. There is no configuration required but little control available over which nodes become peers. * In a darknet network, users manually establish connections with nodes run by people they know. Darknet typically needs more effort to set up but a node only has trusted nodes as peers. Some networks like [[Freenet]] support both network types simultaneously (a node can have some manually-added darknet peer nodes and some automatically-selected opennet peers) . In a friend-to-friend (or F2F) network, users only make direct connections with people they know. Many F2F networks support indirect anonymous or pseudonymous communication between users who do not know or trust one another. For example, a node in a friend-to-friend overlay can automatically forward a file (or a request for a file) anonymously between two "friends", without telling either of them the other's name or IP address. These "friends" can in turn forward the same file (or request) to their own "friends", and so on. Users in a friend-to-friend network cannot find out who else is participating beyond their own circle of friends, so F2F networks can grow in size without compromising their users' anonymity. Some [[friend-to-friend]] networks allow the user to control what kind of files can be exchanged with "friends" within the node, in order to stop them from exchanging files that user disapproves of. Advantages and disadvantages of opennet compared to darknet are disputed, see [[Friend to Friend]] article for summary. ==List of anonymous P2P networks and clients== <!-- please keep this list in alphabetical order --> <!-- please do not add any applications which do not allow file transfer without anybody knowing your IP, having a proxy which takes the blame is NOT anonymous, private nets are NOT anonymous --> ===Public P2P clients=== * [http://www.bunzilla.us/ Bunzilla] - file sharing * [http://calypso.sourceforge.net/ Calypso] - (formerly Kommute) successor to Mute * [[Freenet]] - a censorship-resistant [[distributed file system]] for anonymous publishing (open source, written in Java) * [[GNUnet]] - P2P framework, includes anonymous file sharing as its primary application ([[GNU]] project, written in C) * [[I2P]] - a decentralized (overlay) network for strong anonymity and end-to-end encryption, with many applications (p2p, browsing, distributed anonymous e-mail, instant messaging, irc, ...) running on top of it (free/open source, platform-independent) * [[I2phex]] - a Gnutella client which communicates anonymously through [[I2P]] * [[I2P#eDonkey_iMule|iMule]] - an emule port running under I2P network (includes built-in I2P router) * [[Netsukuku]] - a peer-to-peer routing system aiming to build a free and independent internet * [[Nodezilla]] - an anonymizing, closed source network layer upon which applications can be built (written in C++ and Java)
