"She’s never been a strong vocalist..." writes Raible, "Could she handle these songs with stripped down arrangements and no vocal effects?

No. The focus is still image over substance."<ref>{{cite web|author=Allan Raible |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/allan_raible/2009/01/review-britney.html |title=Review: Britney Spears’ “Circus” - On the Record |publisher=Blogs.abcnews.com |date=2009-01-16 |accessdate=2010-08-14}}</ref> Her image and persona are also often contrasted to Christina Aguilera. David Browne of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' observed "Christina Aguilera may flash skin and belly button, but in her music and manner, she's too eager not to offend — she's a good girl pretending to be bad. Spears, however, comes across as a bad girl acting good ... Spears' artificial-sweetener voice is much less interesting than the settings, yet that blandness is actually a relief compared with Aguilera's numbing vocal gymnastics.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,64697,00.html | title= Review | publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | accessdate=July 17, 2009}}</ref> In contrast, Allmusic comments: "Like her peer Christina Aguilera, Britney equates maturity with transparent sexuality and the pounding sounds of nightclubs ...

Author Gary Giddins wrote in his book ''Natural selection: Gary Giddins on comedy, film, music, and books'' (2006) that "among many other performers accused of moving their lips while a machine does the labor are Britney Spears, [[Luciano Pavarotti]], Shania Twain, [[Beyoncé Knowles|Beyoncé]], and Madonna."<ref name="Giddins">{{Cite book|last=Giddins|first=Gary|title=Natural selection: Gary Giddins on comedy, film, music, and books|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=288|year=2006|isbn=9780195179514|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Rashod D. Ollison of ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' observes: "Many pop stars ... feel they have no choice but to seek vocal enhancement. Since the advent of MTV and other video music channels, pop audiences have been fed elaborate videos thick with jaw-dropping effects, awesome choreography, fabulous clothes, marvelous bodies. And the same level of perfection is expected to extend beyond the video set to the concert stage. So if Britney Spears, Janet Jackson or Madonna sounds shrill and flat without a backing track, fans won't pay up to $300 for a concert ticket."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Ollison|first=Rashod|title=The pressure to be perfect singing live ; Audiences expect CD-quality sound; Observation|newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|page=1.C|date=October 26, 2004|issn=19308965|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Giddins adds, "it was reported Britney Spears fans prefer her to lip-sync—despite her denials of doing so (contradicted by her own director)—because they expect flawless digitalization when they pay serious money for a concert."<ref name="Giddins"/> In Australia, NSW Fair Trading Minister Virginia Judge has advised disclaimers be printed on any ticket for concerts which contain any prerecorded vocals. She commented: "There could have been some instances where people actually go and purchase a ticket thinking that they're going to have a live performance ... for some people that means that everything is live, it's fresh, it happens instantaneously, it's not something that's been pre-recorded.
