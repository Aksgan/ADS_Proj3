coordinates industry input to produce and maintain guides for HL7 messages that can stand alone or be embedded within [[ANSI X12]] transactions. '''Hurricane Katrina''' The HL7 group joined forces with the Electronic Health Record Vendors Association ([http://www.himssehra.org/ EHRVA]) to assist patients in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]]. Members of both organizations were actively working on activities with local, state wide and national agencies (including the [http://www.dhhs.gov DHHS] and the [http://www.cdc.gov/ CDC]) to provide solutions for those in the affected area. ==See also== * [[Clinical Document Architecture|Clinical Document Architecture (CDA)]] * [[Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium|CDISC]] * [[DICOM]] * [[Electronic medical record]] * [[eHealth]] * [[EHRcom]] * [[European Institute for Health Records]] ([[European Union]]) * [[Health Informatics]] * [[Health Informatics Service Architecture]] (HISA) * [[Healthcare Services Specification Project]] (HSSP) * [[ISO TC 215]] * [[IHE]] * [[LOINC]] * [[openehr|openEHR Foundation]] * [[HL7 Services Aware Interoperability Framework|HL7 SAIF]] * [[SNOMED]], [[SNOMED CT]] * [[Public Health Information Network]] * [[Gello Expression Language]] ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== * [http://webstore.ansi.org/FindStandards.aspx?Action=displaydept&DeptID=3104&Acro=HL7&DpName=HL7:%20Health%20Level%20Seven/ HL7 Standards] * [http://www.HL7.org/ HL7.org site] * [http://www.HL7.com.au/FAQ.htm Introduction to HL7] * [http://blog.interfaceware.com/hl7/how-does-hl7-work/ How does HL7 work?

This implies that an element with the greatest key is always in the root node, and so such a heap is sometimes called a ''max-heap''. (Alternatively, if the comparison is reversed, the smallest element is always in the root node, which results in a ''min-heap''.) The several variants of heaps are the prototypical most efficient implementations of the [[abstract data type]] [[priority queue]]s. Priority queues are useful in many applications. In particular, heaps are crucial in several efficient [[graph theory|graph]] [[algorithm]]s. Heaps are usually implemented in an array, and do not require pointers between elements. The operations commonly performed with a heap are: * ''find-max'' or ''find-min'': find the maximum item of a max-heap or a minimum item of a min-heap, respectively * ''delete-max'' or ''delete-min'': removing the root node of a max- or min-heap, respectively * ''increase-key'' or ''decrease-key'': updating a key within a max- or min-heap, respectively * ''insert'': adding a new key to the heap * ''merge'': joining two heaps to form a valid new heap containing all the elements of both. Heaps are used in the sorting algorithm [[heapsort]]. ==Variants== * [[2-3 heap]] * [[Beap]] * [[Binary heap]] * [[Binomial heap]] * [[Brodal queue]] * [[D-ary heap]] * [[Fibonacci heap]] * [[Leftist tree|Leftist heap]] * [[Pairing heap]] * [[Skew heap]] * [[Soft heap]] * [[Ternary heap]] * [[Treap]] ==Comparison of theoretic bounds for variants== The following [[Computational complexity theory|time complexities]]<ref> Thomas H.
