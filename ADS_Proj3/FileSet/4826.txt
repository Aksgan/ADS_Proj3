OneCare also attempts a very minimal interface to lessen user confusion and resource use.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} It adds an icon to the [[Taskbar|notification area]] that tells the user at a glance the status of the system's health by using three alert colors: green (good), yellow (fair), and red (at risk).<ref>{{cite web| title = Windows Live OneCare — Getting Started| publisher = Microsoft Corporation| url = http://onecare.live.com/standard/en-us/members/getstarted.htm|accessdate ={{date|2007-09-29}}}}</ref> ===Compatibility=== Version 1.5 of OneCare is only compatible with the 32 bit versions of Windows XP and Windows Vista.<ref>{{cite web|last=Galli |first=Peter |url=http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/security/next_release_of_onecare_still_wontsupport_vista_x64.html |title=Security - Next Release of OneCare Won't Support Vista x64 |publisher=Microsoft Watch |date=2007-01-23 |accessdate=2010-11-09}}</ref> Version 2 of OneCare supports 64 bit compatibility to Vista. In version 2.5, Microsoft released Windows Live OneCare for Server which supports Windows Server 2008 Standard 64-bit and Windows Small Business Server 2008 Standard and Premium editions. No edition of OneCare operates in safe mode. Windows Live OneCare will not support [[Windows 7]] as its development has been discontinued and replaced by [[Microsoft Security Essentials]]. ===Activation=== Windows Live OneCare requires users to activate the product if they wish to continue using it after the free trial period (90 days). This can only be achieved by having a valid [[Windows Live ID]] so that an association can be made between the account and the subscription to OneCare which has been purchased. When the product is activated, the grey message bar at the top of the program disappears, and the subscription is fully activated for 1 year from the date of activation. Users can check the status of their subscription on the ''Billing'' page at http://billing.microsoft.com/ Windows Live OneCare does not require the operating system to be checked with [[Windows Genuine Advantage]] before, during or after installation. The program can simply be installed from a [[method stub|stub]] downloaded from the http://onecare.live.com/ website or as CD media.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000KN7DDE |title=Microsoft Windows Live OneCare 1.5 (3 User Licence) (PC) |accessdate={{date|2007-07-12}} |date={{date|2007-01-30}} |publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon]] }}</ref> ===Protection=== Windows Live OneCare Protection Plus is the security component in the OneCare suite. It consists of three parts: *A two-way firewall blocking both incoming and outgoing traffic, as opposed to that of [[Windows XP]] pre-service pack 2 that blocks only incoming traffic. A two-way firewall protects against trojan or other viral infections running on the local computer. *An anti-virus tool that uses regularly updated anti-virus definition files. *An anti-spyware tool that uses the [[Windows Defender]] engine as a core. In version 1.0, this required the separate installation of Windows Defender and was not integrated into the OneCare interface (although it could be managed and launched from OneCare). Version 1.5 integrated the Windows Defender engine into OneCare and no longer requires separate installation. From Windows Live OneCare 1.5 onwards also monitors Internet Explorer 7 and 8 security settings and ensures that the automatic website checking feature of the Phishing Filter is enabled. ===Performance=== [[Image:winloc tuneup.png|right|250px]] Windows Live OneCare Performance Plus is the component that performs monthly PC tune-up related tasks, such as: *Disk cleanup and defragmentation. *A full virus scan using the anti-virus component in the suite. *User notification if files are in need of backing up. *Check for Windows updates by using the [[Microsoft Update]] service. ===Backup=== Windows Live OneCare Backup and Restore is the component that aids in backing up important files. Files can be backed up to various recordable media, such as external hard disks, CDs, and DVDs. When restoring files, the entirety or a subset of them can also be restored to a networked computer, as long as it's running OneCare as well. The Backup and Restore component supports [[backup software]] features such as incremental backups and scheduling. ==Criticism== [[Image:Anti-Virus Comarative No. 19 (August 2008) - False Positives.png|thumb|Windows Live OneCare tied for the fewest [[false positive]]s]] Windows Live OneCare has been criticized from both users and competing security software companies. Microsoft's acquisition of GeCAD RAV, a core technology of OneCare, and their subsequent discontinuation of that product, deprived the GNU/Linux platform (and others) of one of its leading virus scanning tools for e-mail servers, bringing Microsoft's ultimate intentions into question.<ref name="RAV discontinued" /> On {{date|January 26, 2006}}, Windows Live OneCare was criticized by Foundstone (a division of the competing [[McAfee]] antivirus) for the integrated firewall having default [[white list]]s which allow [[Java platform|Java]] applications and [[digital signature|digitally signed]] software to bypass user warnings, since neither of those applications carry assurances that they will not have security flaws or be written with a malicious intent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://weblog.infoworld.com/securityadviser/archives/2006/01/microsofts_onec.html |title=Microsoft's OneCare Has Holes |last=Grimes |first=Roger |work=Security Adviser |date={{date|2006-01-29}} |accessdate={{date|2006-12-16}}}}</ref> Microsoft has since responded to the criticism, justifying their decision in that Java applications are ''"widely used by third party applications, and is a popular and trusted program among our users"'', and that ''"it is highly unusual for malware to be signed."''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://windowsonecare.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!C29701F38A601141!598.entry?_c11_blogpart_blogpart=blogview&_c=blogpart |title=Firewall and Windows OneCare – a multi-layered defense |work=Windows Live OneCare Team Blog |date={{date|2006-01-31}} |accessdate={{date|2006-12-16}}}}</ref> Windows Live OneCare has also been criticized
