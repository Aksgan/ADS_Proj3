The refund is issued by the computer manufacturer, or occasionally the retailer, for the copy of Microsoft Windows alone, rather than the whole computer. Microsoft's dominance in desktop computing operating systems and a frequent lack of understanding on the manufacturer's or retailer's part often makes this refund difficult (but not impossible) to obtain. ==The "Windows tax"== A common complaint<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bestpricecomputers.ltd.uk/products/nowindows.htm |title=Buying without Windows-Don't want Windows? |publisher=Best Price Computers Ltd |date=February 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/121046/computing_without_windows.html |title=Computing Without Windows |author=Desmond, Michael |publisher=PC World Communications, Inc. |date=May 31, 2005}}</ref> comes from those who want to purchase a computer without a copy of Windows pre-installed and without paying extra for the license either so that another operating system can be used or because a license was already acquired elsewhere, such as through the [[MSDN Academic Alliance]] program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.racketware.info/msdnaa/call-on-students|title=Call on students | date=September 27, 2009}}</ref> Because [[Free software|free]] operating systems are an increasingly viable alternative to Windows, Microsoft attempts to convince [[original equipment manufacturer]]s to supply all of their computers with Windows pre-installed by presenting their dominance in computer sales<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lists.essential.org/info-policy-notes/msg00005.html |title=why PC manufacturers don't sell non MS products? |date=February 1999}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2001/10/23/13219/110 |title=Microsoft's Dirty OEM-Secret | date=October 23, 2001}}</ref> and engaging in private agreements,<ref name="fof">{{Cite web| url=http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/f3800/msjudgex.htm |title=U.S. v.

While many computer manufacturers have begun to offer specific product ranges with [[Linux]] pre-installed (these include [[HP]], [[Lenovo]], [[Dell]], [[Acer Inc.|Acer]], [[Micro-Star International|MSI]], [[Intel]], [[List of Linux devices#Personal computers|and others]]), they typically strongly lack in this selection.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://shop.lenovo.com/ISS_Static/WW/AG/merchandising/US/popups/hmd/popup_helpme_os_reload.html |title=Lenovo: Help Me Decide.

Dell sells Linux pre-installed on home systems on a limited number of models and configurations, and they have in the past warned prospective buyers that "The main thing to note is that when you choose open source you don't get a Windows operating system".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dell.com/ubuntu/ |title=Dell Home & Home Office {{!}} Ubuntu}}</ref> Formally, computers with free operating systems can be obtained,<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://marc.merlins.org/linux/refundday/dear-valued-customer.html |title=Microsoft official "valued customer" statement}}</ref> but practically most large computer vendors continue to [[Product bundling|bundle]] Microsoft Windows with the majority of the personal computers in their ranges. The Findings of Fact in the [[United States v. Microsoft|United States Microsoft antitrust case of 1998]] established that "One of the ways Microsoft combats piracy is by advising OEMs that they will be charged a higher price for Windows unless they drastically limit the number of PCs that they sell without an operating system pre-installed.

Even to the most advanced of users, however, this is difficult if the computer to be built is a [[laptop]]. Personally assembled "[[White box (computer hardware)|white box]]" machines can be sold casually through small vendors or between friends or on the Internet. Some smaller OEMs and larger retail chains such as [[System76]] have taken specializing in Linux-based systems to their advantage from major suppliers' paucity of non-Windows offerings. Some Linux distributors also run 'partnership' programs to endorse suppliers of machines with their system preinstalled.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://webapps.ubuntu.com/partners/system/ |title=Find Ubuntu partners around the world |work=Ubuntu Partners |publisher=Canonical Ltd}}</ref> ==License refund policy== According to Microsoft's [[Software license agreement|End User License Agreement]], the end user can return Windows for a refund by refusing the terms of the license:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://download.microsoft.com/Documents/UseTerms/Windows%20Vista_Home%20Premium_English_b6fbe7e6-f312-4692-8aee-f5b3d60987b4.pdf |title=Microsoft software license terms for Windows Vista Home Basic, Home Premium and Ultimate versions}}</ref> {{quote|'''By using the software, you accept these terms.
