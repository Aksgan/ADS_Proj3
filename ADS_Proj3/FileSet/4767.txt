The story generated widespread condemnation of the site, along with a flood of complaints to WestHost, the site’s unwitting hosting provider. Unknown to the public and media, WestHost had operated for over a year under a secret [[court order]] to provide all antiimperialista.org logs and files to [[DHS|The Department of Homeland Security]], along with an active tracking system that reported a site visitor’s [[IP address|Internet protocol address]] to DHS. After enduring days of denouncements that WestHost supported terrorist organizations, DHS finally allowed WestHost to shut down the site as it failed to obtain cooperation with foreign authorities to further the investigation. Nevertheless, Italian police later raided the home of a Campo Antiimperialista member and seized a computer and files used to create and maintain the site<ref>[http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/050727/27natsec.htm National Security Watch: Eurolefties fund Iraq insurgency–Part II]</ref>. == References == <references /> == External links == *[http://www.westhost.com WestHost official site] *[http://www.westhost.com/contactus.html Contact information] *[http://forums.westhost.com WestHost Community Forums] *[http://www.westhost.com/blog WestHost Blog] *[http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main/westhost.com Alexa ranking for westhost.com] [[Category:Companies based in Utah]] [[Category:Companies established in 1998]] [[Category:Internet companies of the United States]] [[Category:Web hosting]] [[Category:Web services]] [[Category:Web design companies]] [[Category:Blog hosting services]] [[Category:Design companies of the United States]]</text> </page> <page> <id>40041</id> <title>West American Digest System</title> <text>The '''West American Digest System''' is a system of identifying points of law from reported cases and organizing them by topic and key number. The system was developed by [[Thomson West|West Publishing]] to organize the entire body of [[Law of the United States|American law]]. This extensive [[taxonomy]] makes the process of doing [[case law]] [[legal research]] less time consuming as it directs the researcher to cases that are similar to the legal issue under consideration. ==History== [[File:American law digests.jpg|thumb|Early digests]] The problem of finding cases on a particular topic was a large problem for the rapidly growing American legal system of the 19th century. John B. West, the founder of West Publishing, described this problem in his article ''[http://www.hyperlaw.com//90-99-docs/1909-multiplicity_of_reports_jbwest.html A multiplicity of reports]''. To solve the problem, he developed a system with two major parts. First, his company published cases in many American jurisdictions in bound volumes called [[Law reports | reporters]] (the West [[National Reporter System]] now covers all state and federal courts). Second, he put together a classification system in which he divided the law into major categories which he called topics (such as "Contracts"). He then created hundreds of subcategories. To save space in printing, these were given a number called a key number. He then applied this "topic and key number" system to the cases he published. The key number is identified in the books with a key number and a key symbol graphic. ==How the Digest System works== Each case published in a West reporter is evaluated by an [[editing|editor]] who identifies the points of law cited or explained in the case. The editor places the summaries of the points of law covered in the case at the beginning of the case. These summaries are usually a sentence long, and are called '''headnotes'''. Each headnote is then assigned a topic and key number. The headnotes are arranged according to their topic and key number in multi-volume sets of books called Digests. A digest serves as a subject index to the case law published in West reporters. Headnotes are merely editorial guides to the points of law discussed or used in the cases, and the headnotes themselves are not legal authority. West publishes ''West's Analysis of American Law'', which is a complete guide to the topic and key number system, and it is revised periodically. ==Print Digest== In print, a digest works like an encyclopedia, in that the topics are listed in alphabetical order and printed on the [[bookbinding#Spine_conventions|spines]]. The "Descriptive Word Index" provides guidance as to the proper topics and key numbers. The digest system includes digests for the individual states (except for Delaware, Nevada and Utah). The U.S. Supreme Court, Bankruptcy Courts, Federal Claims Court, and military courts each have an individual digest, as well as their decisions being included in the '''''Federal Practice Digest''''' with the notes of decisions from the federal [[United States district court|District Courts]] and [[United States Court of Appeals|Courts of Appeals]]. Digests are also published for West's [[National Reporter System]]. Specialty subject digests exist, such as the Education Law Digest, and the Social Security Digest. For nationwide research, about once a month, West publishes a '''''General Digest''''' volume, which incorporates classified digest notes from all [[law report|reporters]] of the West National Reporter System. These are then cumulated into a '''''Decennial Digest'''''. Decennial implies that this occurs every ten years, but in the past several decades, there have been Decennial Digest Parts I and II (the 11th Series now has Part III[http://west.thomson.com/productdetail/147058/40591956/productdetail.aspx]), so the cumulation is now more frequent. However, the various Decennial Digests are not cumulated. Thus, completing such a search over several decades requires consulting the Decennial Digests, and then updating that work with the most recent series of the General Digest. Some of the state and topical digests are revised to include the first cases in the jurisdiction, while the spines of the books of some of the other digests indicate that they are from "1933 to date," for instance, indicating that one must consult a prior series for references to earlier cases. The state, federal, regional, and topical digests are updated by interim pamphlets, pocket parts, replacement volumes, or a new series. ==The Digest on Westlaw== Researchers can also search the digest electronically using [[Westlaw]]: * with the "Key Number Search Tool," which uses a word search to identify up to five key numbers, * with the "Key Numbers and Digest" feature (browse by subject using an expandable [[Tree structure|tree]] - no search terms required), * by a key number search using the "Terms and Connectors" method (with a known topic and key number - in the form of 134k261; topic 134 is Divorce and the key number is 261 for "Enforcement, In general"), * by using the
