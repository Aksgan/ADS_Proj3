In those implementations, the markup of a newly edited, marked-up version of the page is generated and submitted to the server [[transparency (computing)|transparently]], shielding the user from this technical detail. However, WYSIWYG controls do not always provide all of the features available in wikitext, and some users prefer not to use a WYSIWYG editor, and as a result many of these sites offer some means to edit the wikitext directly. Most wikis keep a record of changes made to wiki pages; often every version of the page is stored. This means that authors can revert to an older version of the page, should it be necessary because a mistake has been made or the page has been vandalized. Many implementations (for example [[MediaWiki]]) allow users to supply an "edit summary" when they edit a page. This is a short piece of text (usually one line) summarizing the changes. It is not inserted into the article, but is stored along with that revision of the page, allowing users to explain what has been done and why; this is similar to a log message when committing changes to a [[revision control|revision-control]] system. ===Navigation=== Within the text of most pages there are usually a large number of [[hypertext]] links to other pages. This form of non-linear navigation is more "native" to wiki than structured/formalized navigation schemes. That said, users can also create any number of index or table-of-contents pages, with hierarchical categorization or whatever form of organization they like. These may be challenging to maintain by hand, as multiple authors create and delete pages in an ad hoc manner. Wikis generally provide one or more ways to categorize or tag pages to support the maintenance of such index pages. Most wikis have a [[backlink]] feature, which displays all pages that link to a given page. It is typical in a wiki to create links to pages that do not yet exist, as a way to invite others to share what they know about a subject new to the wiki. ===Linking and creating pages=== Links are created using a specific syntax, the so-called "link pattern" (also see [[CURIE]]). Originally, most wikis used [[CamelCase]] to name pages and create links. These are produced by capitalizing words in a phrase and removing the spaces between them (the word "CamelCase" is itself an example). While CamelCase makes linking very easy, it also leads to links which are written in a form that deviates from the standard spelling. CamelCase-based wikis are instantly recognizable because they have many links with names such as "TableOfContents" and "BeginnerQuestions." It is possible for a wiki to render the visible anchor for such links "pretty" by reinserting spaces, and possibly also reverting to lower case. However, this reprocessing of the link to improve the readability of the anchor is limited by the loss of capitalization information caused by CamelCase reversal. For example, "RichardWagner" should be rendered as "Richard Wagner," whereas "PopularMusic" should be rendered as "popular music". There is no easy way to determine which [[capital letter]]s should remain capitalized. As a result, many wikis now have "free linking" using brackets, and some disable CamelCase by default. ==Wiki implementation== Wiki software is a type of [[collaborative software]] that runs a wiki system, allowing web pages to be created and edited using a common web browser. It is usually implemented as an [[application server]] that runs on one or more [[web server]]s. The content is stored in a [[file system]], and changes to the content are stored in a [[relational database management system]]. A commonly implemented softare package is [[MediaWiki]], which runs this encyclopedia. See the [[List of wiki software]] for further information. Alternatively, [[personal wiki]]s run as a standalone application on a single computer. [[WikidPad]] is an example. Wikis can also be created on a "[[wiki farm]]", where the server side software is implemented by the wiki farm owner. [[PBwiki]], [[Socialtext]], [[Wetpaint]], and [[Wikia]] are popular examples of such services. Some wiki farms can also make private, password-protected wikis. Note that free wiki farms generally contain advertising on every page. For more information, see [[Comparison of wiki farms]]. ==Trust and security== ===Controlling changes=== [[Image:History comparison example.png|thumb|History comparison reports highlight the changes between two revisions of a page.]] Wikis are generally designed with the philosophy of making it easy to correct mistakes, rather than making it difficult to make them. Thus, while wikis are very open, they provide a means to verify the validity of recent additions to the body of pages. The most prominent, on almost every wiki, is the "Recent Changes" pageâ€”a specific list numbering recent edits, or a list of edits
