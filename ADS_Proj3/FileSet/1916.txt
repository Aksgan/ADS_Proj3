capacitor|variable capacitance]] between the antenna and the thereminist as that person moves her or his hand near the pitch control antenna. The difference between the two oscillator frequencies produces a tone in the audio range. The [[Ring modulator]] is a type of heterodyne incorporated into some [[synthesizers]] or used as a stand-alone audio effect. === Optical heterodyning === [[Optical heterodyne detection]] is a current active area of research is extension of the heterodyning technique to higher frequencies, particularly to [[light]] frequencies, which are above radio frequencies in the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. This technique could greatly improve [[optical modulator]]s, increasing the density of information carried by [[optical fiber]]s. It is also being applied in the creation of more accurate [[atomic clock]]s based on directly measuring the frequency of a laser beam.<ref>http://tsapps.nist.gov/ts_sbir/abstracts/08abst1.htm see NIST subtopic 9.07.9-4.R for a description of research on one system to do this.</ref> Since optical frequencies are far beyond any feasible electronic circuit all photon detectors are inherently energy detectors not oscillating electric field detectors. However since energy detection is inherently "square-law" detection, it intrinsically mixes any optical frequencies present on the detector. Thus sensitive detection of specific optical frequencies is possible by [[optical heterodyne detection]] when two different (close-by) wavelengths of light illuminate the detector so that the oscillating electrical output corresponds to their difference frequency. This allows extremely narrow band detection (much narrower band than any possible color filter can achieve) as well as precision measurements of phase and frequency of a signal light relative to a reference light source, as in [[Laser Doppler Vibrometry]]. This phase sensitive detection has been applied for Doppler measurements of wind speed, and imaging through dense media. The high sensitivity against background light is especially useful for [[LIDAR]]. ==See also== *[[Optical heterodyne detection]] *[[Beat (acoustics)]] *[[Edwin Howard Armstrong]] *[[Electroencephalography]] *[[Frequency changer]] *[[Frequency mixer]] *[[Ring modulation]] *[[Heterodyne detection]] *[[Homodyne]] *[[Superheterodyne receiver]] ==References== ===Notations=== *Glinsky, Albert.

Heterogeneous database systems (HDBS) are computational models and software implementations that provide heterogeneous database integration [1,2] ==Problems of Heterogeneous Database Integration== This article does not contain details of [[Distributed database management system]]s (sometimes known as [[Federated database system]]s). ===Technical Heterogeneity=== Different [[file format]]s, access [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]]s, query languages etc. Often called syntactic heterogeneity from the point of view of data. ===Data Model Heterogeneity=== Different ways of representing and storing the same data. Table decompositions may vary, column names (data labels) may be different (but have the same semantics), data [[code|encoding]] schemes may vary (i.e. should a measurement scale be explicitly included in a field or should it be implied elsewhere). Also referred as schematic heterogeneity. ===Semantic Heterogeneity=== Data across constituent databases may be related but different. Perhaps a database system must be able to integrate genomic and proteomic data. They are related - a gene may have several protein products - but the data is different (nucleotide sequences and amino acid sequences, or hydrophilic/phobic amino acid sequence and positive/negatively charge amino acids). There may be many ways of looking at semantically similar, but distinct datasets. The system may also be required to present 'new' knowledge to the user. Relationships may be inferred between data according to rules specified in domain ontologies. ==See also== *[[Ontology (computer science)|Ontology]] *[[Knowledge base|Knowledge Base]] *[[Expert System]] ==References== 1.

Heuristic methods are used to speed up the process of finding a good enough solution, where an exhaustive search is impractical. Examples of this method include using a "[[rule of thumb]]", an educated guess, an intuitive judgment, or [[common sense]]. In more precise terms, heuristics are strategies using readily accessible, though loosely applicable, information to control [[problem solving]] in human beings and machines.<ref>Pearl, Judea (1983). ''Heuristics: Intelligent Search Strategies for Computer Problem Solving''. New York, Addison-Wesley, p. vii.</ref> ==Example== The most fundamental heuristic is [[trial and error]], which can be used in everything from matching bolts to bicycles to finding the values of variables in algebra problems. Here are a few other commonly used heuristics, from Polya's 1945 book, ''[[How to Solve It]]'':<ref>Polya, George (1945) ''How To Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method'', Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. ISBN 0-691-02356-5 ISBN 0-691-08097-6</ref> *If you are having difficulty understanding a problem, try drawing a picture. *If you can't find a solution, try assuming that you have a solution and seeing what you can derive from that ("working backward"). *If the problem is abstract, try examining a concrete example. *Try solving a more general problem first (the "[[inventor's paradox]]": the more ambitious plan may have more chances of success). ==Psychology==<!-- This section is linked from [[List of psychology topics]] --> In [[psychology]], heuristics are simple, efficient rules, [[hard-coded]] by evolutionary processes or learned, which have been proposed to explain how people make decisions, come to judgments, and solve problems, typically when facing complex problems or incomplete information. These rules work well under most circumstances, but in certain cases lead to systematic errors or [[cognitive bias]]es. Although much of the work of discovering heuristics in human decision-makers was done by [[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]],<ref>Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky and Paul Slovic, eds.
