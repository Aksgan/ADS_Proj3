Often the pattern repeats, which is indicated by a superscript in the notation. For example, the [[Nauru graph]],<ref name="DE1"/> shown on the right, has LCF notation [5, &minus;9, 7, &minus;7, 9, &minus;5]<sup>4</sup>. Graphs may have different LCF notations, depending on precisely how the vertices are arranged. The numbers between the square brackets are interpreted [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] ''N'', where ''N'' is the number of vertices. Entries equal (modulo ''N'') to 0, 1, and ''N''&minus;1 are not permitted,<ref>Klavdija Kutnar and Dragan Marušič, [http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0606585v1 "Hamiltonicity of vertex-transitive graphs of order 4''p'',"] ''European Journal of Combinatorics'', Volume 29, Issue 2 (February 2008), pp. 423-438, section 2.</ref> since they do not correspond to valid third edges. LCF notation is useful in publishing concise descriptions of Hamiltonian cubic graphs, such as the examples below. In addition, some software packages for manipulating graphs include utilities for creating a graph from its LCF notation.<ref>e.g. [http://www.maplesoft.com/support/help/AddOns/view.aspx?path=GraphTheory/SpecialGraphs/LCFGraph Maple], [http://networkx.lanl.gov/reference/generated/networkx.LCF_graph.html NetworkX], [http://igraph.sourceforge.net/doc/R/graph.lcf.html R], and [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mhansen/sage-epydoc/sage.graphs.graph_generators.GraphGenerators-class.html sage].</ref> ==Examples== {| class="wikitable" |- |'''Name''' || '''Vertices''' || '''LCF notation''' |- |[[Tetrahedron|Tetrahedral]] graph || 4 || [2]<sup>4</sup> |- |[[Water, gas, and electricity|Utility graph]] || 6 || [3]<sup>6</sup> |- |[[Hypercube graph|Cubical graph]] || 8 || [3,-3]<sup>4</sup> |- |[[Wagner graph]] || 8 || [4]<sup>8</sup> |- |[[Bidiakis cube]] || 12 || [6,4,-4]<sup>4</sup> or [6,-3,3,6,3,-3]<sup>2</sup> |- |[[Franklin graph]] || 12 || [5,-5]<sup>6</sup> or [-5,-3,3,5]<sup>3</sup> |- |[[Frucht graph]] || 12 || [-5,-2,-4,2,5,-2,2,5,-2,-5,4,2] |- |Truncated [[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] graph || 12 || [2,6,-2]<sup>4</sup> |- |[[Heawood graph]] || 14 || [5,-5]<sup>7</sup> |- |[[Mobius-Kantor graph]] || 16 || [5,-5]<sup>8</sup> |- |[[Pappus graph]] || 18 || [5,7,-7,7,-7,-5]<sup>3</sup> |- |[[Desargues graph]] || 20 || [5,-5,9,-9]<sup>5</sup> |- |[[Dodecahedron|Dodecahedral]] graph || 20 || [10,7,4,-4,-7,10,-4,7,-7,4]<sup>2</sup> |- |[[McGee graph]] || 24 || [12,7,-7]<sup>8</sup> |- |Truncated [[cube|cubical]] graph || 24 || [2,9,-2,2,-9,-2]<sup>4</sup> |- |Truncated [[octahedron|octahedral]] graph || 24 || [3,-7,7,-3]<sup>6</sup> |- |[[Nauru graph]] || 24 || [5,-9,7,-7,9,-5]<sup>4</sup> |- |[[F26A graph]] || 26 || [-7, 7]<sup>13</sup> |- |[[Tutte–Coxeter graph]] || 30 || [-13,-9,7,-7,9,13]<sup>5</sup> |- |[[Dyck graph]] || 32 || [5,-5,13,-13]<sup>8</sup> |- |[[Gray graph]] || 54 || [-25,7,-7,13,-13,25]<sup>9</sup> |- |Truncated [[dodecahedron|dodecahedral]] graph || 60 || [30, -2, 2, 21, -2, 2, 12, -2, 2, -12, -2, 2, -21, -2, 2, 30, -2, 2, -12, -2, 2, 21, -2, 2, -21, -2, 2, 12, -2, 2]<sup>2</sup> |- |[[Harries graph]] || 70 || [-29,-19,-13,13,21,-27,27,33,-13,13,19,-21,-33,29]<sup>5</sup> |- |[[Harries–Wong graph]] || 70 || [9, 25, 31, -17, 17, 33, 9, -29, -15, -9, 9, 25, -25, 29, 17, -9, 9, -27, 35, -9, 9, -17, 21, 27, -29, -9, -25, 13, 19, -9, -33, -17, 19, -31, 27, 11, -25, 29, -33, 13, -13, 21, -29, -21, 25, 9, -11, -19, 29, 9, -27, -19, -13, -35, -9, 9, 17, 25, -9, 9, 27, -27, -21, 15, -9, 29, -29, 33, -9, -25] |- |[[Balaban 10-cage]] || 70 || [-9, -25, -19, 29, 13, 35, -13, -29, 19, 25, 9, -29, 29, 17, 33, 21, 9,-13, -31, -9, 25, 17, 9, -31, 27, -9, 17, -19, -29, 27, -17, -9, -29, 33, -25,25, -21, 17, -17, 29, 35, -29, 17, -17, 21, -25, 25, -33, 29, 9, 17, -27, 29, 19, -17, 9, -27, 31, -9, -17, -25, 9, 31, 13, -9, -21, -33, -17, -29, 29] |- |[[Foster graph]] || 90 || [17,-9,37,-37,9,-17]<sup>15</sup> |- |[[Biggs-Smith graph]] || 102 || [16, 24, -38, 17, 34, 48, -19, 41, -35, 47, -20, 34, -36, 21, 14, 48, -16, -36, -43, 28, -17, 21, 29, -43, 46, -24, 28, -38, -14, -50, -45, 21, 8, 27, -21, 20, -37, 39, -34, -44, -8, 38, -21, 25, 15, -34, 18, -28, -41, 36, 8, -29, -21, -48, -28, -20, -47, 14, -8, -15, -27, 38, 24, -48, -18, 25, 38, 31, -25, 24, -46, -14, 28, 11, 21, 35, -39, 43, 36, -38, 14, 50, 43, 36, -11, -36, -24, 45, 8, 19, -25, 38, 20, -24, -14, -21, -8, 44, -31, -38, -28, 37] |- |[[Balaban 11-cage]] || 112 || [44, 26, -47, -15, 35, -39, 11, -27, 38, -37, 43, 14, 28, 51, -29, -16, 41, -11, -26, 15, 22, -51, -35, 36, 52, -14, -33, -26, -46, 52, 26, 16, 43, 33, -15, 17, -53, 23, -42, -35, -28, 30, -22, 45, -44, 16, -38, -16, 50, -55, 20, 28, -17, -43, 47, 34, -26, -41, 11, -36, -23, -16, 41, 17, -51, 26, -33, 47, 17, -11, -20, -30, 21, 29, 36, -43, -52, 10, 39, -28, -17, -52, 51, 26, 37, -17, 10, -10, -45, -34, 17, -26, 27, -21, 46, 53, -10, 29, -50, 35, 15, -47, -29, -41, 26, 33, 55, -17, 42, -26, -36, 16] |- |[[Ljubljana graph]] || 112 || [47, -23, -31, 39, 25, -21, -31, -41, 25, 15, 29, -41, -19, 15, -49, 33, 39, -35, -21, 17, -33, 49, 41, 31, -15, -29, 41, 31, -15, -25, 21, 31, -51, -25, 23, 9, -17, 51, 35, -29, 21, -51, -39, 33, -9, -51, 51, -47, -33, 19, 51, -21, 29, 21, -31, -39]<sup>2</sup> |- |[[Tutte 12-cage]] || 126 || [17, 27, -13, -59, -35, 35, -11, 13, -53, 53, -27, 21, 57, 11, -21, -57, 59, -17]<sup>7</sup> |} == Extended LCF notation == A more complex extended version of LCF notation was provided by Coxeter, Frucht, and Powers in later work.<ref>{{cite book |first1=H.
