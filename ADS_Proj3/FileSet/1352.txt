These activities are required to develop and deliver [[Product (business)|product]]s and/or [[Service (economics)|services]] to a customer. An enterprise includes a number of functions and operations such as purchasing, manufacturing, marketing, finance, engineering, and research and development. The enterprise of interest are those corporate functions and operations necessary to manufacture current and potential future variants of a product.<ref name="Ostie96">James K. Ostie (1996).

For this purpose they include abstractions suitable for [[strategic planning]], [[Business process reengineering|organisational (re-) design]] and [[software engineering]]. The views should complement each other and thereby foster a better understanding of [[complex system]]s by systematic abstractions. The views should be generic in the sense that they can be applied to any enterprise. At the same time they should offer abstractions that help with designing [[information systems]] which are well integrated with a company's long term strategy and its organisation. Hence, [[enterprise model]]s can be regarded as the conceptual infrastructure that support a high level of integration."<ref name="FU09"/> == History == Enterprise modelling has its roots in [[systems modelling]] and especially information systems modelling. One of the earliest pioneering works in modelling information systems has been done by Young and Kent (1958),<ref>Young, J. W., and Kent, H. K. (1958).

They wanted to create "a notation that should enable the [[Systems analyst|analyst]] to organize the problem around any piece of [[hardware]]". Their work was a first efforts to create an abstract specification and invariant basis for designing different alternative implementations using different hardware components. A next step in IS modelling was taken by [[CODASYL]], an IT industry consortium formed in 1959, who essentially aimed at the same thing as Young and Kent: the development of "a proper structure for machine independent problem definition language, at the system level of data processing". This lead to the development of a specific IS [[information algebra]].<ref name="JAB07"/> The first methods dealing with enterprise modelling emerged in the 1970s. They were the [[Entity-relationship model|entity-relationship approach]] of [[Peter Chen]] (1976) and [[SADT]] of [[Douglas T. Ross]] (1977), the one concentrate on the [[information view]] and the other on the [[function view]] of business entities.<ref name="Vern97"/> These first methods have been followed end 1970s by numerous methods for [[software engineering]], such as [[SSADM]], [[Structured Design]], [[Structured Analysis]] and others.
