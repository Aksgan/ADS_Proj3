While the earlier Itanium-based Altix systems ran a [[single-system image]] (SSI) [[Linux kernel]] on 1024 processors or more using a standard [[SuSE Linux Enterprise Server]] (SLES) distribution, the Altix ICE's clustering capabilities uses standard SLES or [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] distributions and scales to over 51,200 cores on [[NASA]]'s [[Pleiades (supercomputer)|Pleiades]] [[supercomputer]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The '''Altix ICE 8200LX''' blade enclosure featured two 4x DDR IB switch blade and one high performing plane, while the '''Altix ICE 8200EX''' featured four 4x DDR IB switch blades, and two high performing planes. Both configurations supported either [[hypercube]] or [[fat tree]] topology, and 16 compute blades within an IRU. The IP-83 and IP-85 compute blades supported Intel Xeon 5200 or 5400 Series processors, and the IP-95 compute blade supported Intel Xeon 5500 Series processors. {{As of|2010|11|alt=As of fall 2010}}, the current product is the ICE 8400, based on either Intel Xeon 5500 or 5600 processors or the AMD Opteron 6100 series processors. ==Altix UV== The Altix UV supercomputer architecture was announced in November 2009. Codenamed ''Ultraviolet'' during development, the Altix UV combines a development of the NUMAlink interconnect used in the Altix 4000 (NUMAlink 5) with quad-, six- or eight-core "[[Nehalem (microarchitecture)|Nehalem-EX]]" Intel Xeon 7500 processors. Altix UV systems run either SuSE Linux Enterprise Server or Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and scale from 32 to 2,048 cores with support for up to 16 Terabytes (TB) of shared memory in a single system image.<ref name="altix-uv-pr">{{cite web|url=http://www.sgi.com/company_info/newsroom/press_releases/2009/november/altix_uv.html|title=SGI Unveils Altix UV, the World's Fastest Supercomputer|date=2009-11-16|work=www.sgi.com|publisher=[[Silicon Graphics International]]|accessdate=2009-11-18}}</ref> ==Notes== {{Reflist}} ==References== * Silicon Graphics, Inc.

This allows lighting designers, end users and content providers (of videogames, films, music, programs and websites) to create and enjoy immersive experiences by the triggering of specially developed [[AmBX]] enabled devices. The [[AmBX]] technology is now owned by a british company based in Redhill, [[amBX UK LTD]]. [[AmBX]] enabled devices deliver many effects; lighting, airflow, rumble and others. [[AmBX]] is a controlling technology that enables devices (via generic input, scripted scenes or embeded code) to synchronise with any game, sound and video content in real time. As well as LED lights, rumble kit and fans, other types of devices which have been prototyped include heat and water atomisers. The events triggering effects can be layered and a 'rest' effect can also be generated when content is inactive. The technology works seamlessly with all legacy source content (incuding video and PC games). Content that has specially scripted [[AmBX]] code embeded can trigger a reaction to on screen video and audio output with any immersive/ambient device effects the designers require. [[AmBX]] has a proprietary professional hardware product (amBIENT XC) but allows other hardware manufacturers with a [[licensing agreement]] to create [[AmBX]] enabled hardware capable of delivering the [[AmBX]] experience. [[AmBX]] technology (via the amBIENT XC) also 'talks' to lighting industry standard control interfaces and light sources via the [[DMX512]] control language. [[AmBX]] technology is available for the home user, PCs and professional and commercial lighting (stage, shops, bars, restaurants, clubs, AV installations and offices). Game consoles, mobile phone apps, film and other entertainment media are also expected to follow.<ref>http://www.ambx.com/wiki/Main_Page</ref> == How it works == '''Technology''' [[AmBX]] code acts as a conversion middleware (sitting between source and output device) that takes generic or specificaly scripted (via [[AmBX]] SDK) input signals from video, audio, PC or media content, then outputs it to suitable harware such as LED lights, rumble boxes or similar devices via cable or wirless, subject to hardware. '''Embedded code''' For the full experience and to trigger specific events/effects, developers embed code (via free SDK dowload) into their applications to tell the devices what to do. Current developers and publishers using [[AmBX]] include [[Ubisoft]], [[THQ]], [[Codemasters]], [[Gamecock]], [[Gearbox Software]], [[Introversion Software]]<ref>http://www.gamezone.com/news/item/introversion_announces_ambx_version_of_defcon/</ref> and [[Spark Unlimited|Spark]]. [[AmBX]] licenses the technology to content providers for free. [[AmBX]] technology works with generic content of any age. The latest [[AmBX]]-enabled games include ''[[Far Cry 2]]'', ''[[Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway]]'', ''[[Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X.]]'', ''[[Multiwinia]]'', ''[[Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising]]'', and ''[[Legendary (video game)|Legendary]]''. '''Legacy and non-enabled games''' The [[AmBX]] FXGen is a piece of software that forms part of the standard software install that analyses on-screen events and triggers the AmBX peripherals to generate effects. For games [[AmBX]] isn't embedded in, such as ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', ''[[Call of Duty]]'', ''[[Crysis]]'', ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'', the AmBX software team provide constant updates (currently FOC), allowing these games to work in a hybrid fashion, creating effects that sit somewhere between generic and fully [[AmBX]] scripted ones, meaning there is a large amount of [[AmBX]] enhanced gameplay available (including popular online games). '''Films and Music''' When using the current Philips AmBX enabled PC Gaming peripherals (or Mad Catz gaming lights) to watch films and music [[AmBX]] generates immersive lighting effects when viewing popular media players. These include [[iTunes]], [[Quick Time]], [[VLC media player]], [[Media Player Classic]], and [[Winamp]]. Different presets are available: Moderate, Colour, Relaxed and Dynamic.
