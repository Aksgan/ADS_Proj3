A simple example is the relationship between the number of carbons in [[alkanes]] and their [[boiling point]]s. There is a clear trend in the increase of boiling point with an increase in the number carbons and this serves as a means for predicting the boiling points of [[higher alkanes]]. A still very interesting application is the [[Hammett equation]], [[Taft equation]] and [[Acid dissociation constant|pKa prediction]] methods.<ref name="CMC2_2007">{{cite book | author = Fraczkiewicz R | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Comprehensive medicinal chemistry II | edition = | language = | publisher = Elsevier | location = Amsterdam | year = 2007 | origyear = | pages = | chapter = In Silico Prediction of Ionization | quote = | isbn = 0-08-044518-7 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> === Biological === The biological activity of molecules is usually measured in [[assay]]s to establish the level of inhibition of particular [[signal transduction]] or [[metabolic pathway]]s. Chemicals can also be biologically active by being [[toxicity|toxic]]. [[Drug discovery]] often involves the use of QSAR to identify chemical structures that could have good inhibitory effects on specific [[biological target|targets]] and have low [[toxicity]] (non-specific activity). Of special interest is the prediction of [[partition coefficient]] log ''P'', which is an important measure used in identifying "[[druglikeness]]" according to [[Lipinski's Rule of Five]]. While many quantitative structure activity relationship analyses involve the interactions of a family of molecules with an [[enzyme]] or [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] binding site, QSAR can also be used to study the interactions between the [[structural domain]]s of proteins.
