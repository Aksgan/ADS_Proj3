according to Friendly (2008) "primarily concerned with the visualization of [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensional]] phenomena (architectural, meteorological, medical, [[Biological Data Visualization|biological]], etc.), where the emphasis is on realistic renderings of volumes, surfaces, illumination sources, and so forth, perhaps with a dynamic (time) component".<ref name = "MF08">[[Michael Friendly]] (2008).

Increasingly it is created by means of [[3D computer graphics]], though [[2D computer graphics]] are still widely used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster real-time rendering needs. Sometimes the target of the animation is the computer itself, but sometimes the target is another [[Recording medium|medium]], such as [[film]]. It is also referred to as CGI ([[Computer-generated imagery]] or computer-generated imaging), especially when used in films. === Computer simulation=== [[Computer simulation]] is a computer program, or network of computers, that attempts to [[simulation|simulate]] an abstract [[model (abstract)|model]] of a particular system. Computer simulations have become a useful part of [[mathematical model]]ling of many natural systems in physics, and computational physics, chemistry and biology; human systems in economics, psychology, and social science; and in the process of engineering and new technology, to gain insight into the operation of those systems, or to observe their behavior.<ref> Steven Strogatz (2007). "The End of Insight". In: ''What is your dangerous idea?'' John Brockman (ed). HarperCollins.</ref> The simultaneous visualization and simulation of a system is called [[visulation]]. Computer simulations vary from computer programs that run a few minutes, to network-based groups of computers running for hours, to ongoing simulations that run for months. The scale of events being simulated by computer simulations has far exceeded anything possible (or perhaps even imaginable) using the traditional paper-and-pencil [[mathematical modeling]]: over 10 years ago, a desert-battle simulation, of one force invading another, involved the modeling of 66,239 tanks, trucks and other vehicles on simulated terrain around [[Kuwait]], using multiple supercomputers in the [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] High Performance Computer Modernization Program.<ref name="JPLsim">[http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/releases/97/military.html "Researchers stage largest military simulation ever"]. (news), [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], [[Caltech]], December 1997.</ref> === Information visualization === [[Information visualization]] is the study of "the [[Visual system|visual]] [[Representation (arts)|representation]] of large-scale collections of non-numerical information, such as files and lines of code in [[software system]]s, [[library]] and bibliographic [[database]]s, networks of relations on the [[internet]], and so forth".<ref name="MF08"/> Information visualization focused on the creation of approaches for conveying abstract information in intuitive ways. Visual representations and interaction techniques take advantage of the human eye’s broad bandwidth pathway into the mind to allow users to see, explore, and understand large amounts of information at once.<ref>James J. Thomas and Kristin A. Cook (Ed.) (2005). [http://nvac.pnl.gov/agenda.stm ''Illuminating the Path: The R&D Agenda for Visual Analytics''].

Rosenblum]] (ed.) (1994). ''Scientific Visualization: Advances and challenges''. Academic Press.</ref> === Surface rendering === [[Rendering (computer graphics)|Rendering]] is the process of generating an image from a [[3D model|model]], by means of computer programs. The model is a description of three dimensional objects in a strictly defined language or data structure. It would contain geometry, viewpoint, [[texture mapping|texture]], [[lighting]], and [[shading]] information. The image is a [[digital image]] or [[raster graphics]] [[image]]. The term may be by analogy with an "artist's rendering" of a scene. 'Rendering' is also used to describe the process of calculating effects in a video editing file to produce final video output. Important rendering techniques are: ;[[Scanline rendering]] and rasterisation : A high-level representation of an image necessarily contains elements in a different domain from pixels. These elements are referred to as primitives. In a schematic drawing, for instance, line segments and curves might be primitives. In a graphical user interface, windows and buttons might be the primitives. In 3D rendering, triangles and polygons in space might be primitives. ;Ray casting : [[Ray casting]] is primarily used for realtime simulations, such as those used in 3D computer games and cartoon animations, where detail is not important, or where it is more efficient to manually fake the details in order to obtain better performance in the computational stage. This is usually the case when a large number of frames need to be animated. The resulting surfaces have a characteristic 'flat' appearance when no additional tricks are used, as if objects in the scene were all painted with matte finish. ;Radiosity :[[Radiosity]],
