Only a few non-Japanese companies managed to survive in this market, including Adept Technology, Stäubli-Unimation, the Swedish-Swiss company [[Asea Brown Boveri|ABB]] (ASEA Brown-Boveri), the Austrian manufacturer igm Robotersysteme AG and the German company [[KUKA]] Robotics. This includes the one used by the robot based automative production plants,known as [[Industrial robots|assembly line robots]]. ==Characteristics== The Japanese movie [[Robocon]] (2003) is a fictional account of an inter-school [[robot competition]]. Robots' characteristics may vary with their specific applications. There are robots that are supposed to provide help to the [[elderly]], robots that catwalk in fashion shows or robots that look like [[pets]] and make the children's best friends. The main characteristic is their ability to move. Humanoid Japanese robots, those which resemble people the most are capable of walking and talking. They have however limited functions and they mainly do what they are programmed to. Moreover, a recently created robot called CB2 or Child-robot with Biomimetic Body may follow moving objects with its [[eyes]]. CB2 can dangle its [[leg]]s, raise its shoulders and fall with rhythmic breathing.<ref name="Psysorg">{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news158151870.html|title=Japan child robot mimicks infant learning |accessdate=2010-04-05}}</ref> CB2 may recognize the human touch which is possible thanks to the 197 film-like pressure [[sensors]] that are placed under its rubbery [[skin]]. Asada, the team of engineers and brain specialists together with psychologists and many other specialists in the related domain created a CB2 that may record emotional expressions, memorize them and then match them with physical sensations. The characteristics of robots are however progressive, their abilities being enlarged as the technology has progressed. The same CB2 acts more and more as human and it was capable of teaching itself how to walk with the aid of human help. The robot learned how to move around the room by using its 51 "muscles" which are driven by [[air pressure]]. The humanoid Japanese robots characteristics include abilities such as [[blinking]], [[smiling]] or expressing emotions akin to anger and surprise. One of the newest Japanese robots, [[HRP-4C]] is a female-robot programmed to catwalk. It walks and talks and with the help of 30 [[Electric motor|motors]] it may move its legs and arms however loudly and awkwardly. The facial expressions that are capable of are driven by 8 facial motors to make it smile or blink and change the facial expression as a response to anger or surprise.<ref name="Cnet">{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/japans-latest-supermodel-a-robot/|title=Japan's latest supermodel--a robot |accessdate=2010-04-05}}</ref> Robots that are intended to play with [[children]] usually look like animals and depending on what animal they are, they make different sounds, move, walk and play. Robot-dogs for example may bark, move their tails and somehow run or play with a child. There are also the mountable robots that can carry their passengers almost anywhere they need to go. Some of the Japanese robots move through [[rolling]].<ref name="Robmat">{{cite web|url=http://www.robotmatrix.org/humanoidrobot.htm|title=What is Humanoid Robot? |accessdate=2010-04-05}}</ref> ===Mobility and movement=== One of the characteristics and advances of Japanese robotics over many other countries is the movement and mobility of the robots used. == Commercial Applications == Conceivable commercial applications of robots include any type of activity that a robot could do in the domestic or industrial field. Japanese scientists have foreseen many applications for their robots. They could be used in the hospitals, they may provide help for the elderly, they may be play-friends for children and they could replace [[humans]] in various activities. Researchers across Japan have unveiled increasingly sophisticated robots with different functions, including a talking office [[receptionist]], a [[security guard]] and
