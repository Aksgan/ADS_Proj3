because of its stateful feature, which checks incoming traffic against its state table first instead of jumping to the firewall's rule set. In this case if the state table is matched, then it doesn't need deep packet inspection. ==Application-level filters== {{Main|Application firewall}} However, packet filtering alone is not regarded as providing enough protection. In order to effectively block [[peer-to-peer]]-related network traffic, what is needed is a firewall that does ''application filtering'', which can be regarded as an extension to stateful packet inspection. Stateful packet inspection can determine what type of protocol is being sent over each port, but application-level filters look at what a protocol is being used for. For example, an application-level filter might be able to tell the difference between HTTP traffic used to access a Web page and HTTP traffic used for file sharing, whereas a firewall that is only performing packet filtering would treat all HTTP traffic equally. [[Application layer firewall]]s differ from stateful packet-filtering and circuit-level gateways in several ways. Application-layer firewalls support multiple application [[Proxy server|proxies]] on a single firewall. The proxies sit between the client and server, passing data between the two endpoints. Suspicious data is dropped and the client and server never communicate directly with each other. Because application-level proxies are application-aware, the proxies can more easily handle complex protocols like [[H.323]], which is used for videoconferencing and [[VoIP]] (Voice over IP). Application proxies can be transparent to the client and server, as no configuration is required on the client or the server; or can be non-transparent, letting the client and server address the proxy server directly. Transparency versus non-transparency is a matter of implementation and address hiding, rather than about security. ==Pitfalls== ===Incompatibilities=== [[Microsoft]]'s latest operating systems, [[Windows 7]] and [[Windows Vista]], use [[TCP window scale option|TCP window scaling]] for non-[[HTTP]] (web) connections. So do Linux kernels from versions 2.6.8 on. This behavior is incompatible with some [[Firewall (networking)|firewalls]] that use SPI (Stateful Packet Inspection) as found in firewalls like the [[Check Point]] NG R55, [[Cisco PIX]] earlier than v6.3.1, [[NetApp]] Cache Appliances, [[SonicWall]], [[D-Link]] DI-724U, [[Netgear]] WGR614, and [[Linksys]] WRT54GS.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Network connectivity may fail when you try to use Windows Vista behind a firewall device|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/934430/en-us}}</ref> This may be related to [[Criticism of Microsoft#Security|previous failures]] to work properly. Pre-released ([[Beta version|beta]]) versions of [[Windows Vista|Vista]] allegedly had more problems, including failed [[http]] (web) connections through SPI [[Firewall (networking)|firewalls]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=A painful Vista networking bug|url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/Bott/?p=10}}</ref> ===Vulnerabilities=== There is a risk that vulnerabilities in individual protocol decoders could allow an attacker to gain control over the firewall. This concern highlights the need to keep firewall software updated.<ref name="tomato">[http://lwn.net/Articles/369367/ Review of Tomato firewall] "...both L7-Filter and IPP2P are explicitly unmaintained. Given the steady stream of security updates for protocol dissectors in WireShark, your editor has a hard time believing that these other classifiers can be completely free of security issues."</ref> Stateful firewalls also raise the possibility that individual hosts can be tricked into soliciting outside connections. This possibility can only be completely eliminated by auditing the host software. Some firewalls can be defeated in this way by simply viewing a web page (either with JavaScript enabled, or after clicking on a button).<ref name="kamkar">[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/01/06/web_based_firewall_attack/ Hacker pierces hardware firewalls with web page]</ref> ==See also== *[[Check Point VPN-1]] *[[CHX-I]] *[[Cisco ASA]] *[[Cisco PIX]] *[[Cyberoam]] *[[Endian Firewall]] *[[FireWall-1]] *[[IPCop]] *[[IPFilter]] *[[ipfirewall|ipfw]] *[[Kerio WinRoute Firewall]] *[[Monowall]] *[[Netfilter]] *[[Network layer firewall]] *[[PF (firewall)|Packet Filter (PF)]] *[[pfSense]] *[[Proxy server]] *[[Untangle]] *[[Vyatta]] Open Network OS ==References== {{Reflist}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Stateful Firewall}} [[Category:Computer network security]] [[cs:Stavov√Ω firewall]] [[de:Stateful Packet Inspection]] [[pms:SPI]] [[pl:Stateful Packet Inspection]]</text> </page> <page> <id>35625</id> <title>Statgraphics</title> <text>{{Notability|date=September 2008}} {{Infobox_Software | name = Statgraphics| logo = | released = 1980 | screenshot = | caption = | developer = StatPoint Technologies | latest_release_version = 16 | latest_release_date = October, 2009 | operating_system = [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] | genre = [[List of statistical packages|Statistics Package]] | license = [[Proprietary software|Proprietary]] | website = [http://statgraphics.com/ Statgraphics] | }} '''Statgraphics''' is a [[List of statistical packages|statistics package]] that performs and explains basic and advanced [[statistical]] functions.

In September of 2008 the [http://www.statgraphicsonline.com Statgraphics On Line] version was released. STATGRAPHICS Online is a statistical package that runs within a web browser. Users can enter data directly into the data editor or import data from text files, Excel files, or other formats. The calculations are performed remotely on a web server and the results returned to the user's browser as HTML with embedded graphics images. ==See also== *[[List of statistical packages]] *[[Comparison of statistical packages]] *[[List of information graphics software]] ==External links== * [http://www.statgraphics.com/ Statgraphics Homepage] * [http://statgraphics.com/statgraphics_centurion.htm Statgraphics ''Centurion XVI''] * [http://statgraphics.com/statgraphics_online.htm Statgraphics Online] ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Statistical software]] [[Category:Windows software]] [[fr:Statgraphics]] [[id:Statgraphics]]</text> </page> <page> <id>35637</id> <title>Static mesh</title> <text>'''Static meshes''' are [[polygon meshes]] which constitute a major part of map architecture in [[Unreal Engine technology|Unreal Engine]] 2 and 3.
