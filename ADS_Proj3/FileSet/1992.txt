verify the correctness of their programs, while the markers had to read every line of the program and try to understand the underlying algorithm. In 1997, the competition was split into the heat and final event. The heat event consists of a written paper. Outstanding students in the heat event proceed to enter the 2-hour final event, which consists of programming tasks similar to those in IOI. The heat event was essential due to the limited number of computers provided for the final event. However, this change in the competition format did not eliminate the need for marking based on hand-written programs. In 1998, the heat event was replaced by a pre-competition assessment. All participants were asked to work on the pre-competition assessment task and submit a floppy diskette containing the [[source code]] and [[executable]] of their programs. The list of finalist were determined solely by the programs submitted. However, it raised concerns about the fairness of the competition, since there is no way to ensure that the submitted program was really written by the participant. At that time, the only programming language allowed was [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]]. In 1999, the heat event was reinstalled. This time, the heat event consisted of a single paper of [[Multiple choice]] problems to improve the efficiency in marking papers. This was important as the number of participants had increased to several hundred students. In 2000, the duration of the final event increased to 3 hours. In 2003, [[Cloze|Fill-in-the-blank]] problems were added to the heat event, aiming to add a new dimension to the question paper. In 2004, [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++ ]] were added to the list of allowed programming languages. As of 2009, the competition consists of a heat event with Multiple Choice and Fill-in-the-blanks problems, while the final event consists of 5 programming tasks to be solved in 3 hours. The programming languages allowed are [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]], [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]]. Different sets of problem are used for junior and senior group respectively. ===Awards=== About half of the finalists are awarded prizes. Prizes are awarded in Gold, Silver and Bronze, in the ratio of approximately 1:2:3. Only the performance in the final event is considered. Students in junior group and senior group are ranked separately. Prize winners are invited to join the HKOI Training Team for intensive training. A Team Formation Test is usually held at around June or July to select delegates for [[International Olympiad in Informatics|IOI]] and [[NOI]]. ==Important people== * Poon Wing-chi, Irwin. He is the first [[International Olympiad in Informatics|IOI]] gold medallist from Hong Kong. * Wan Yung-chun, Justin. He has represented Hong Kong to the most external competitions in a single year. * [[Tse Chi-yung]]. He has represented Hong Kong to the most external competitions. He is also the person from Hong Kong with the most [[International Olympiad in Informatics|IOI]] medals. He was employed by [[Google]] in 2006 [http://www.cs.hku.hk/news/2006/0911_googlerecruit.jsp]. * Liu Chi-man, alias '''cx'''. He is the second [[International Olympiad in Informatics|IOI]] gold medallist from Hong Kong. * Lam Chi Kit. He is the third [[International Olympiad in Informatics|IOI]] gold medalist from Hong Kong.

It is currently the 22nd-most visited college sports website, 13th-most visited team-specific website, and the 8th-most visited independent college sports website.<ref>[http://www.alexa.com/browse?&CategoryID=30288 Alexa: Sites in College and University]</ref> The site has over 43,000 registered users as of December 19, 2006. Hornfans was created as a partnership between Bob Wheeler and Katy Agnor, with an initial investment of $1000. At the time Wheeler was a relatively well-known contributor to sports websites such as CBSSportsline.com, and crafted a bi-weekly Longhorn newsletter under the pseudonym "LonghornBob", and was to provide content for the site. Agnor was an accomplished web designer and was to program the site. <ref name="statesman">{{cite news|title="Founders of UT fan Web site lock horns"|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AASB&p_theme=aasb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0E9C2573C346AF3E&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|work=[[Austin American Statesman]]|date=1999-12-20|accessdate = 2008-01-18}}</ref>
