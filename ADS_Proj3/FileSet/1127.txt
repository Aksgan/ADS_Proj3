[[Grandmaster Ratte']] was the [[sysop|SysOp]] of DRU, and the BBS was the "base system" for his group [[Cult of the Dead Cow]], a computer hacker organization. It ran from [[1985]] to [[1999]], though the name changed twice in its early existence. The original name of the BBS was "'''The Amazing Captain Neato (TACN) BBS'''." The name was then changed to "'''The Marauding C*A*M*E*L'''," before Ratte' changed the name for the final time to DRU. The BBS ran [[GBBS]] software and was hosted on an [[Apple IIgs]] for its entire original lifetime. ==Login== After connecting, the user was required to enter a certain word to be able to login to the BBS. Entries that would allow the user to enter the main DRU system included "THRASH" "GRUNGE" "CARCINOGEN" and "PIGFUCK". The BBS required a new user password in order to gain access. The password was "VOID". The DRU login screen displayed the following warning: "''[[Warning]]: This BBS may contain explicit descriptions of, or advocate one or more of the following: [[adultery]], [[murder]], morbid [[violence]], bad [[grammar]], [[deviant]] sexual conduct in violent contexts, or the [[ingestion|consumption]] of [[alcohol]] and [[illegal drugs]]. But then again, it may not. Who knows?''"

It was called "'''The Polka AE'''." This name is a parody of the "Metal AE," which was a popular AE at the time. Entering the word "KILL" at the GBBS entry prompt launched "The Polka AE" (rather than DRU); "KILL" was also the entry for "the Metal AE." * [[1993]] - A fake-version of the BBS was added. It was called "'''Demon Roach Underground Elite'''." At the main BBS entry prompt, one entered "SMASH." This version of the BBS did not require a new user password. An interesting feature was that the user list showed the passwords for all users, including the sysop. Thus, any user could log in as any other user. Messages were often posted and e-mails were often sent under other users' names. * [[1999]] - DRU ends its run as a public BBS * [[2002]] - DRU is reborn as an exclusive, invitation-only system == External links == * [http://www.tranquileye.com/hackerculture/ Simulation of DRU login screen] * [http://www.cultdeadcow.com/ CULT OF THE DEAD COW homepage] * [http://bbslist.textfiles.com/806/ 806 BBS List] {{Cult of the Dead Cow}} [[Category:Bulletin board systems]] [[Category:Cult of the Dead Cow]] [[Category:Wikipedia articles with ASCII art]]</text> </page> <page> <id>9935</id> <title>Denavit-Hartenberg Parameters</title> <text>[[File:Sample_Denavit-Hartenberg_Diagram.png |375px|right]] ==Definition== A commonly used convention for selecting [[frames of reference]] in [[robotics]] applications is the [[Robotics conventions#Denavit-Hartenberg link frame convention (DH)|Denavit and Hartenberg (D-H) convention]] which was introduced by [[Jaques Denavit]] and [[Richard S. Hartenberg]]. In this convention, each homogeneous transformation is represented as a product of four basic [[Transformation (geometry)|transformations]]. The common normal between two lines was the main geometric concept that allowed Denavit and Hartenberg to find a [[Robotics conventions#Minimal line representation|minimal representation]]. The reference frames are laid out as follows: # the <math>z</math>-axis is in the direction of the joint axis # the <math>x</math>-axis is parallel to the [[Common normal (robotics)|common normal]]: <math>x_n = z_n \times z_{n-1}</math><br>If there is no unique common normal (parallel <math>z</math> axes), then <math>d</math> (below) is a free parameter. The direction of <math>x_n</math> is from <math>z_{n - 1}</math> to <math>z_n</math>, as shown in the video below. # the <math>y</math>-axis follows from the <math>x</math>- and <math>z</math>-axis by choosing it to be a [[Cartesian coordinate system#In three dimensions|right-handed coordinate system]]. The transformation is then described by the following four parameters known as '''D-H Parameters''':<ref>Spong, M., M. Vidyasagar, ”Robot Dynamics and Control”,
