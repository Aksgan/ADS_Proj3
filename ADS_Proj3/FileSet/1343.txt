in civil/criminal investigations, network investigations, data compliance and [[electronic discovery]]). The software is available to [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]] and corporations and is generally considered the [[de facto]] standard for criminal digital forensics evidence collection.<ref name="advancesdf" /> EnCase includes tools for data acquisition, file recovery, indexing/search and file parsing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guidancesoftware.com/computer-forensics-digital-investigation-law-enforcement.htm|title=Encase Law Enforcement|publisher=Guidance Software|accessdate=16 June 2010}}</ref>. Special training is usually required to operate the software. Data recovered by EnCase has been used successfully in various court systems around the world such as in the case of the [[Dennis_Rader#Arrest|BTK Killer]].<ref name="US Court Usage"/><ref name="UK Court Usage"/> ==Use== EnCase contains tools for several areas of the [[digital forensic process]]; acquisition, analysis and reporting. The software also includes a scripting facility called EnScript with various API's for interacting with evidence. ===Acquisition=== EnCase contains functionality to [[Digital forensic process#Acquisition|create forensic images]] of suspect media. Images are stored in proprietary ''EnCase Evidence File Format''; the compressible file format is prefixed with case data information and consists of a [[bit]]-by-bit (e.g. exact copies of the original) copy of the media inter-spaced with hashes (usually [[MD5]] or [[SHA-1]]) for every 64K of data. The file format also appends an MD5 hash of the entire drive as a footer.<ref name="advancesdf" /> ===Analysis=== After imaging, EnCase can be used to examine the files stored in the image using common tools such as a [[document viewer]] and [[hex editor]]. It can also examine parts of the [[filesystem]] not normally exposed to the user, such as deleted file entries, on-disk checksums and log/journaling data. It can also search for and attempt to recover deleted files. ===Reporting=== Evidential material can be "bookmarked" within the program and produced as a report in various formats. ==Accreditation== In 2001, [[Jessica M. Bair]], a former [[U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command]] [[Special Agent]] and computer forensics examiner, created the ''EnCase Certified Examiner'' (EnCE) program with John Colbert, to certify professionals in the use of Guidance Software's EnCase computer forensics software. By 2009, over 2,100 professionals were certified in EnCase. In 2006, Bair was the technical editor for the [[Sybex]] published ''Official EnCE Study Guide''<ref>{{cite book|last=Steve|first=Bunting|title=EnCase Computer Forensics: The Official EnCE: EnCase Certified Examiner Study Guide|year=2006|publisher=Sybex|isbn=0782144357|pages=576|url=http://www.amazon.com/EnCase-Computer-Forensics-Official-EnCase-Certified/dp/0782144357}}</ref>. In 2009, Bair created the ''EnCase Certified eDiscovery Practitioner'' (EnCEP) program to certify professionals in the use of Guidance Software's ''EnCase eDiscovery'' software, as well as their proficiency in [[eDiscovery]] planning, [[project management]] and [[best practices]] spanning [[legal hold]] to [[load file]] creation. ==Countermeasures== Because EnCase is well known and popular with law enforcement, considerable research has been conducted into defeating it (as well as [[anti-computer forensics]] in general). The [[Metasploit Project]] produces an anti-forensics toolkit, which includes tools to prevent EnCase from finding data or from operating at all. Manual defences are possible too, for example by modifying the file system.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20061021193155/http://www.safehack.com/Textware/forensic/Anti_Forensic_Break_Encase.pdf Breaking EnCase with FILE0 and Winhex]</ref> Furthermore, because law enforcement procedures involving EnCase have to be documented and available for public scrutiny in many judicial systems, those wishing to defend themselves against its use have a considerable pool of information to study. Copies of EnCase have been widely leaked on [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing]] networks, allowing full analysis of the software. Proof-of-concept code exists that can cause EnCase to crash, or even use buffer overflow exploits to run arbitrary code on the investigator's computer. It is known that EnCase is vulnerable to [[zip bomb]]s, for example ''42.zip''.<ref>[http://www.unforgettable.dk/ A website to download the 42.zip decompression bomb from]</ref> ==References== {{reflist|refs= <ref name="advancesdf" >{{cite book|title=Advances in digital forensics II|year=2006|publisher=Springer|isbn=0387368906|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jr2PPjwXJQwC|editor=Martin S.

ELS is available online and as a 32-volume print edition. The online edition was launched in April 2001, with the print edition published in January 2002. At the end of 2004, ELS was acquired by Wiley-Blackwell from the [[Nature Publishing Group]]. Articles are written by experts in the field and cover subjects from areas as diverse as ecology and cell biology. As of July 2010, there are more than 4,600 article topics published in ELS online. Full access to ELS requires a [[subscription]]. ==See also== *[[List of online encyclopedias]] ==External links== *[http://www.els.net ELS website] [[Category:Biological literature]] [[Category:Encyclopedias on science and mathematics]] [[Category:Online encyclopedias]] [[Category:Internet properties established in 2001]] [[Category:Biology websites]] [[de:Encyclopedia of Life Sciences]]</text> </page> <page> <id>12122</id> <title>End extension</title> <text>In [[model theory]] and [[set theory]], which are disciplines within mathematics, a model <math>\mathfrak{B}=\langle B, F\rangle </math> of some axiom system of [[set theory]] <math> T\, </math> in the language of set theory is an '''end extension''' of <math>\mathfrak{A}=\langle A, E\rangle </math>, in symbols <math>\mathfrak{A}\subseteq_\text{end}\mathfrak{B}</math>, if * <math>\mathfrak{A}</math> is a [[substructure]] of <math>\mathfrak{B}</math>, and * <math> b\in A</math> whenever <math>a\in A</math> and <math>bFa\,</math> hold, i.e., no new elements are added by <math>\mathfrak{B}</math> to the elements of <math>\mathfrak{A}</math>.
