[[38 Degrees]], who are working with the [[Open Rights Group]] to mobilise opposition to the bill, state that over 22,000 people have emailed their MPs through their web site. 38 Degrees have also raised over £20,000 in donations to fund newspaper ads against the bill.<ref>http://blog.38degrees.org.uk</ref> More than 35,000 people signed a Number 10 petition,<ref>http://www.dontdisconnect.us</ref> started by Andrew Heaney at ISP [[TalkTalk]], objecting to being disconnected without fair trial.
