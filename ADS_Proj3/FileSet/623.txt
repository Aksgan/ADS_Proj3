appear that a ceiling had occurred in the measurements due to an apparent clustering around some minimum amount of time (such as the 250 ms needed by many people to press a key). However, this clustering could actually represent a natural physiological limit of response time, rather than an artifact of the stopwatch sensitivity (which of course would be a ceiling effect). Further statistical study, and scientific judgment, can resolve whether or not the observations are due to a ceiling or are the truth of the matter. === Validity of instrument constraints === ==== IQ testing {{anchor | IQ testing}}<!-- This section is linked from [[Intelligence quotient]] and [[Intellectual giftedness]] and other articles--> ==== Some authors{{Who|date=January 2011}} on gifted education write about ceiling effects in IQ testing having negative consequences on individuals. Those authors sometimes claim such ceilings produce systematic underestimation of the IQs of [[Intellectual giftedness | intellectually gifted]] people. In this case, it is necessary to distinguish carefully two different ways the term "ceiling" is used in writings about IQ testing. <!-- Sortable wikitable appears in IQ testing section of Ceiling effect article, to display on right of section --> <div class="right floating table" style="margin-left: 1em; float: right; font-size: small;"> {| class="wikitable sortable" style="font-size:small" summary="Sortable table showing actual I.Q. scores of twelve students on three different I.Q. tests, with students identified by pseudonyms in cited data source." |+ The same person can receive different IQ scores each time the person is tested, exchanging rank order with other test-takers, so rulers are a poor analogy to IQ scales.

An IQ test with a wide range of progressively more difficult questions will have a higher ceiling than one with a narrow range and few difficult items. Ceiling effects result in an inability, first, to distinguish among the gifted (whether moderately gifted, profoundly gifted, etc), and second, results in the erroneous classification of some gifted people as above average, but not gifted. Suppose that an IQ test has three subtests: vocabulary, arithmetic, and picture analogies. The scores on each of the subtests are normalized (see [[standard score]]) and then added together to produce a composite IQ score. Now suppose that Joe obtains the maximum score of 20 on the arithmetic test, but gets 10 out of 20 on the vocabulary and analogies tests. Is it fair to say that Joe's total score of 20+10+10, or 40, represents his total ability? The answer is no, because Joe achieved the maximum possible score of 20 on the arithmetic test. Had the arithmetic test included additional, more difficult items, Joe might have gotten 30 points on that subtest, producing a "true" score of 30+10+10 or 50. Compare Joe's performance with that of Jim, who scored 15+15+15 = 45, without running into any subtest ceilings. In the original formulation of the test, Jim did better than Joe (45 versus 40), whereas it is Joe who actually should have gotten the higher "total" intelligence score than Jim (score of 50 for Joe versus 45 for Jim) using a reformulated test that includes more difficult arithmetic items. Writings on gifted education bring up two reasons for supposing that some IQ scores are underestimates of a test-taker's intelligence: # they tend to perform all subtests better than less talented people; # they tend to do much better on some subtests than others, raising the inter-subtest variability and chance that a ceiling will be encountered. === Statistical analysis === Ceiling effects on measurement compromise scientific truth and understanding through a number of related statistical aberrations. First, ceilings impair the ability of investigators to determine the central tendency of the data. When a ceiling effect relates to data gathered on a dependent variable, failure to recognize that ceiling effect may "lead to the mistaken conclusion that the independent variable has no effect."<ref name="Cramer2005p21" /> For mathematical reasons beyond the scope of this article (see [[analysis of variance]]), this reduced variance reduces the sensitivity of scientific experiments designed to determine if the average of one group is significantly different from the average of another group (for example, a treatment given to one group may produce an effect, but the effect may escape detection because the mean of the treated group won't look different enough from the mean of the untreated group). Thus "ceiling effects are a complex of matters and their avoidance a matter of careful evaluation of a range of issues."<ref name="Cramer2005p21" /> == See also == *[[Floor effect]] == Notes == {{reflist|2|refs= <ref name="Baker2004p40">{{Harvnb |Baker|2004|page=40}}</ref> <ref name="Shastri2005p125">{{Harvnb |Shastri|1958|loc=entry "equipotent"}}</ref> <ref name="Cramer2005p21">{{Harvnb |Cramer|2005|page=21}}</ref> <ref name="Vogt2005p40">{{Harvnb |Vogt|2005|page=40}}</ref> <ref name="Po1998p20">{{Harvnb |Po|1998|page=20}}</ref> <ref name="Kaufman2009pp151-153">{{Harvnb |Kaufman|2009|pages=151–153}}</ref> }} == Bibliography == * {{cite book |title=Illustrated Medical Dictionary |last=Baker |first=Hans |year=2004 |publisher=Lotus Press |ref=harv}} * {{cite book |title=The SAGE Dictionary of Statistics: A Practical Resource for Students in the Social Sciences |last1=Cramer |first1=Duncan |last2=Howitt |first2=Dennis Laurence |year=2005 |edition=Third |publisher=SAGE |page=21 (entry "ceiling effect") |isbn=978-0761941385 |laysummary=http://www.sagepub.com/booksProdDesc.nav?prodId=Book225578 |laydate=1 August 2010 |ref=harv}} * {{cite book |title=IQ Testing 101 |last=Kaufman |first=Alan S. |authorlink=Alan S.
