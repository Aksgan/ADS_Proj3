works deal with a number of subjects, including suicide, the family, social structures, and social institutions, a large part of his work deals with the sociology of knowledge. In 1902, he published, with Marcel Mauss, "De quelques formes primitives de classification", an essay that examines how the various ways in which a society is organized structurally impacts the formation of a society's categories and logical grouping systems. One of the most important elements of Durkheim's theory knowledge is his concept of [[représentation collectives]] ([[collective representations]]). 'Représentations collectives' are the symbols and images that come to represent the ideas, beliefs, and values elaborated by a collectivity and are not reducible to individual constituents. They can include words, slogans, ideas, or any number of material items that can serve as a symbol, such as a cross, a rock, a temple, a feather etc. As Durkheim elaborates, 'représentations collectives' are created through the intense interaction of religious rituals. They are products of collective activity and as such these 'représentations' have the particular, and somewhat contradictory, aspect that they exist externally to the individual (since they are created and controlled not by the individual but by society as a whole), and yet simultaneously within each individual of the society (by virtue of that individual's participation within society). Through 'représentations collectives' the group exerts pressure on the individual to conform to society's norms of morality and thought. As such, collective representations help to order and make sense of the world, but they also express, symbolize and interpret social relationships. Durkheim's definitive statement concerning the sociology of knowledge comes in his magnum opus [[The Elementary Forms of Religious Life]]. This book has as its goal not only the elucidation of the social origins and function of religion, but also the social origins and impact of society on language and logical thought. ===Karl Mannheim=== {{main|Karl Mannheim}} The German political philosophers [[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883) and [[Friedrich Engels]] (1820–1895) argued in ''Die Deutsche Ideologie'' (1846, ''German Ideology'') and elsewhere that people's [[ideology|ideologies]], including their social and political beliefs and opinions, are rooted in their [[social class|class]] interests, and more broadly in the social and economic circumstances in which they live: "It is men, who in developing their material inter-course, change, along with this their real existence, their thinking and the products of their thinking. Life is not determined by consciousness, but consciousness by life" (''Marx-Engels Gesamtausgabe'' 1/5). Under the influence of this doctrine, and of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]], the Hungarian-born German sociologist [[Karl Mannheim]] (1893–1947) gave impetus to the growth of the sociology of knowledge with his ''Ideologie und Utopie'' (1929, translated and extended in 1936 as ''Ideology and Utopia''), although the term had been introduced five years earlier by the co-founder of the movement, the German philosopher, phenomenologist and social theorist [[Max Scheler]] (1874–1928), in ''Versuche zu einer Soziologie des Wissens'' (1924, ''Attempts at a Sociology of Knowledge''). Mannheim feared that this interpretation could be seen to claim that all knowledge and beliefs are the products of socio-political forces since this form of [[relativism]] is self-defeating (if it is true, then it too is merely a product of socio-political forces and has no claim to truth and no persuasive force). Mannheim believed that [[relativism]] was a strange mixture of modern and ancient beliefs in that it contained within itself a belief in an absolute truth which was true for all times and places (the ancient view most often associated with [[Plato]]) and condemned other truth claims because they could not achieve this level of objectivity (an idea gleaned from [[Marx]]). Mannheim sought to escape this problem with the idea of '[[relationism]]'. This is the idea that certain things are true only in certain times and places (a view influenced by [[pragmatism]]) however, this does not make them less true. Mannheim felt that a stratum of free-floating intellectuals (who he claimed were only loosely anchored to the class structure of society) could most perfectly realize this form of truth by creating a "dynamic synthesis" of the ideologies of other groups. ===Phenomenological Sociology=== [[Phenomenological Sociology]] is the study of the formal structures of concrete social existence as made available in and through the analytical description of acts of intentional consciousness. The "object" of such an analysis is the meaningful lived world of everyday life: the "Lebenswelt", or Life-world (Husserl:1989). The task, like that of every other phenomenological investigation, is to describe the formal structures of this object of investigation in subjective terms, as an object-constituted-in-and-for-consciousness (Gurwitsch:1964). That which makes such a description different from the "naive" subjective descriptions of the man in the street, or those of the traditional, positivist social scientist, is the utilization of phenomenological methods. The leading proponent of Phenomenological Sociology was [[Alfred Schutz]] [1899-1959]. Schutz sought to provide a critical philosophical foundation for [[Max Weber]]'s interpretive sociology through the use of phenomenological methods derived from the transcendental phenomenological investigations of [[Edmund Husserl]] [1859-1938]. Husserl's work was directed at establishing the formal structures of intentional [[consciousness]]. Schutz's work was directed at establishing the formal structures of the Life-world (Schutz:1980). Husserl's work was conducted as a transcendental phenomenology of consciousness. Schutz's work was conducted as a mundane phenomenology of the Life-world (Natanson:1974). The difference in their research projects lies at the level of analysis, the objects taken as topics of study, and the type of phenomenological reduction that is employed for the purposes of analysis. Ultimately, the two projects should be seen as complementary, with the structures of the latter dependent on the structures of the former. That is, valid phenomenological descriptions of the formal structures of the Life-world should be wholly consistent with the descriptions of the formal structures of intentional consciousness. It is from the latter that the former derives its validity and [[truth value]] (Sokolowski:2000). The phenomenological tie-in with the sociology of knowledge stems from two key historical sources for [[Mannheim]]'s analysis: [1] Mannheim was dependent on insights derived from Husserl's phenomenological investigations, especially the theory of meaning as found in Husserl's Logical Investigations of 1900/1901
