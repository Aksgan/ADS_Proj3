can be accomplished by using a combination of differential GPS (DGPS) correction data, transmitting GPS signal phase information and ambiguity resolution techniques via statistical testsâ€”possibly with processing in real-time ([[Real Time Kinematic|real-time kinematic positioning]], RTK). == Timekeeping {{anchor|GPS time|GPS time and date}} == While most clocks are synchronized to [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), the [[atomic clock]]s on the satellites are set to ''GPS time''. The difference is that GPS time is not corrected to match the rotation of the Earth, so it does not contain [[leap second]]s or other corrections which are periodically added to UTC. GPS time was set to match [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) in 1980, but has since diverged. The lack of corrections means that GPS time remains at a constant offset with [[International Atomic Time]] (TAI) (TAI - GPS = 19 seconds). Periodic corrections are performed on the on-board clocks to correct relativistic effects and keep them synchronized with ground clocks. The GPS navigation message includes the difference between GPS time and UTC, which as of 2009 is 15 seconds due to the leap second added to UTC December 31, 2008. Receivers subtract this offset from GPS time to calculate UTC and specific timezone values. New GPS units may not show the correct UTC time until after receiving the UTC offset message. The GPS-UTC offset field can accommodate 255 leap seconds (eight bits) which, given the current rate of change of the Earth's rotation (with one leap second introduced approximately every 18 months), should be sufficient to last until approximately the year 2300. As opposed to the year, month, and day format of the [[Gregorian calendar]], the GPS date is expressed as a week number and a seconds-into-week number. The week number is transmitted as a ten-[[bit]] field in the C/A and P(Y) navigation messages, and so it becomes zero again every 1,024 weeks (19.6 years). GPS week zero started at 00:00:00 UTC (00:00:19 TAI) on January 6, 1980, and the week number became zero again for the first time at 23:59:47 UTC on August 21, 1999 (00:00:19 TAI on August 22, 1999). To determine the current Gregorian date, a GPS receiver must be provided with the approximate date (to within 3,584 days) to correctly translate the GPS date signal. To address this concern the modernized GPS navigation message uses a 13-bit field, which only repeats every 8,192 weeks (157 years), thus lasting until the year 2137 (157 years after GPS week zero). == Carrier phase tracking (surveying) == Utilizing the navigation message to measure pseudorange has been discussed. Another method that is used in GPS surveying applications is carrier phase tracking. The period of the carrier frequency times the speed of light gives the wave length, which is about 0.19 meters for the L1 carrier. With a 1% of wave length accuracy in detecting the leading edge, this component of pseudorange error might be as low as 2 millimeters. This compares to 3 meters for the C/A code and 0.3 meters for the P code. However, this 2 millimeter accuracy requires measuring the total phase, that is the total number of wave lengths plus the fractional wavelength. This requires specially equipped receivers. This method has many applications in the field of surveying. We now describe a method which could potentially be used to estimate the position of receiver 2 given the position of receiver 1 using triple differencing followed by numerical root finding, and a mathematical technique called [[least squares]]. A detailed discussion of the errors is omitted in order to avoid detracting from the description of the methodology. In this description differences are taken in the order of differencing between satellites, differencing between receivers, and differencing between epochs. This should not be construed to mean that this is the only order which can be used. Indeed other orders of taking differences are equally valid. The satellite carrier total phase can be measured with ambiguity as to the number of cycles. Let <math>\ \phi(r_i, s_j, t_k) </math> denote the phase of the carrier of satellite j measured by receiver i at time <math>\ \ t_k </math>. This notation has been chosen so as to make it clear what the subscripts i, j, and k mean. In view of the fact that the receiver, satellite, and time come in alphabetical order as arguments of <math>\ \phi </math> and to strike a balance between readability and conciseness, let <math>\ \phi_{i,j,k} = \phi(r_i, s_j, t_k) </math> so as to have a concise abbreviation. Also we define three functions, :<math>\ \Delta^r, \Delta^s, \Delta^t </math> which perform differences between receivers, satellites, and time points respectively. Each of these functions has a linear combination of variables with three subscripts as its argument. These three functions are defined below. If <math>\ \alpha_{i,j,k} </math> is a function of the three integer arguments, i, j, and k then it is a valid argument for the functions, :<math>\ \Delta^r, \Delta^s, \Delta^t </math> , with the values defined as :<math>\ \Delta^r(\alpha_{i,j,k}) = \alpha_{i+1,j,k} - \alpha_{i,j,k} </math> , :<math>\ \Delta^s(\alpha_{i,j,k}) = \alpha_{i,j+1,k} - \alpha_{i,j,k} </math> , and :<math>\ \Delta^t(\alpha_{i,j,k}) = \alpha_{i,j,k+1} - \alpha_{i,j,k} </math> . Also if <math>\ \alpha_{i,j,k}\ and\ \beta_{l,m,n} </math> are valid arguments for the three functions and a and b are constants then <math>\ ( a\ \alpha_{i,j,k} + b\ \beta_{l,m,n} ) </math> is a valid argument with values defined as :<math>\ \Delta^r(a\ \alpha_{i,j,k} + b\ \beta_{l,m,n}) = a \ \Delta^r(\alpha_{i,j,k}) + b \ \Delta^r(\beta_{l,m,n})</math> , :<math>\ \Delta^s(a\ \alpha_{i,j,k} + b\ \beta_{l,m,n} )= a \ \Delta^s(\alpha_{i,j,k}) + b \ \Delta^s(\beta_{l,m,n})</math> , and :<math>\ \Delta^t(a\ \alpha_{i,j,k} + b\ \beta_{l,m,n} )= a \ \Delta^t(\alpha_{i,j,k}) + b \ \Delta^t(\beta_{l,m,n})</math> . Receiver clock errors can be approximately eliminated by differencing the phases measured from satellite 1 with that from satellite 2 at the same epoch.<ref>[http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/633.htm Between-satellite differencing]</ref> This difference is designated as <math>\ \Delta^s(\phi_{1,1,1}) = \phi_{1,2,1} - \phi_{1,1,1}</math> Double differencing can be performed by taking the differences of the between satellite difference observed by receiver 1 with that observed by receiver 2.<ref>[http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/635.htm Double differencing]</ref> The satellite clock errors will
