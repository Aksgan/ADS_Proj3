The DexDrive products were made by now-defunct [[InterAct]] for use with [[PlayStation]] and [[Nintendo 64]] memory cards. It was shipped to retail stores in January 1997. == Design == Mainly, the purpose of the device was to provide a more economical solution for game data storage. The DexDrive was sold at retail for roughly the same price as two Sony- or Nintendo-branded memory cards&mdash;$50 MSRP in the U.S. The official cards had a capacity of only 128 KB, far less than even a [[floppy disk]]. Cost and capacity were much more favorable on a PC due to the efficiency of [[hard disk drive]]s. For the cost of two memory cards, DexDrive owners had the opportunity to store effectively limitless amounts of game data by transferring files as needed between the memory cards and the PC. Additionally, as PC files, game data could be shared over the internet or be used with console [[emulator]]s. [[Image:Dexplorer screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|DexPlorer 1.0]] The product shipped with a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] driver application, called DexPlorer, on two 3.5" floppy disks. Updated software, which addressed many of the problematic issues in the pack-in software, was available for several years on the InterAct corporate website. Unofficial software has also been written by various authors. In some cases, competitors supported the DexDrive in order to claim [[de facto]] compatibility. In other cases, DexDrive users wrote their own software to address the shortcomings of DexPlorer or to make images of their Playstation 2 Memorycards{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. {{-}} == See also == * [[MaxDrive]] == External links == * [http://www.legendcup.com/gamesaves.php Download DexPlorer software] from a fansite * [http://www.neillcorlett.com/dexter/ Download user-created Dexter software] * [http://moberg-dybdal.dk/psxge/ Download PSX Game Save Editor an all-in-one tool for Game Saves] [[Category:Nintendo 64 peripherals]] [[Category:PlayStation 1 peripherals]] [[Category:Video game hardware]]</text> </page> <page> <id>10164</id> <title>Diabetes Hands Foundation</title> <text>{{notability|companies|date=September 2010}} {{COI|date=September 2010}} {{Infobox non-profit | Non-profit_name = Diabetes Hands Foundation | Non-profit_logo = [[File:Dhf-logo-with-icon.jpg|250px]] | founded_date = March 2008 | founder = Manny Hernandez | location = [[Berkeley, CA]], [[United States|U.S.]] | origins = | key_people = Manny Hernandez (President, Chairman of the Board), Andreina Davila (Creative Director, Secretary) | area_served = | focus = "Connect people touched by diabetes and raise diabetes awareness." | method = | revenue = | endowment = | num_employees = 3 | last = | title = Fact Sheet | url = | accessdate = | homepage = [http://www.diabeteshandsfoundation.org/ www.diabeteshandsfoundation.org] }} The '''Diabetes Hands Foundation''' ("DHF"), founded in 2008, is an American [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organization]] that connects people touched by [[diabetes]] and raises diabetes awareness.
