AppleScript also has a native graphical programming front-end called Automator, released with [[Mac OS X]] 10.4, codenamed Tiger, in April 2005. One of HyperCard's strengths was its handling of [[multimedia]], and many multimedia systems like [[Macromedia Authorware]] and [[Macromedia Director]] are based on concepts originating in HyperCard {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}. [[AppWare]], originally known as '''Serius Developer''', is sometimes seen to be similar to HyperCard, as they were both [[rapid application development]] system. AppWare was sold in the early 90s and worked on both Windows and Mac systems. The first HyperCard virus was discovered in Belgium and Holland in April 1991.<ref>[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-10614183/latest-mac-viral-infection.html]</ref> Because HyperCard executed scripts in stacks immediately on opening it was also one of the first applications susceptible to [[Macro virus (computing)|macro viruses]].

The [[Myst]] computer game franchise, initially released as a HyperCard stack and included bundled with some Macs (for example the [[Performa]] 5300), still lives on, making HyperCard a facilitating technology for starting one of the best-selling computer games of all time. {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} According to [[Ward Cunningham]], the inventor of [[Wiki]]s, the wiki concept can be traced back to a HyperCard stack he wrote in the late 1980s, making HyperCard one of the grandparents of the Wiki idea.<ref>[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiHistory Wiki History]</ref><ref>[[n:Interview: Wikinewsie Kim Bruning discusses Wikimania|Interview: Wikinewsie Kim Bruning discusses Wikimania]]</ref><ref>[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7739076742312910146 An Evening with Wiki Inventor Ward Cunningham in Conversation with John Gag]</ref> Sometime in 1991 Badfish used it once. ==See also== * [[Apple Media Tool]] * [[Automator (software)|Automator]]: an easy-to-use script-authoring environment * [[HyperNext]]: a freeware cross-platform development system for both Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X & Mac OS 9. * [[Morphic (software)|Morphic]]: a visual UI building system * [[mTropolis]]: multimedia authoring using a drag-and-drop programming system * [[NoteCards]]: from Xerox [[PARC]], a similar system that pre-dates HyperCard * [[Revolution (programming language)|Revolution]]: Rapid application development environment that can be deployed on many popular platforms * [[Stagecast Creator]]: one of a number of similar "if you see this, do this" programming systems * [[SuperCard]] * [[ViolaWWW]]: early web browser initially based upon HyperCard ==References== {{Reflist|colwidth=50em}} ==Bibliography== {{Anchors|Books}} {{Refbegin}} * [[Danny Goodman]], ''The Complete HyperCard Handbook'' (Bantam Books, 1987), ISBN 0-9665514-2-7 {{Refend}} ==External links== * [http://www.archive.org/details/CC501_hypercard Computer Chronicles] 1987 interview with Bill Atkinson and Dan Winkler demonstrating HyperCard (from Archive.org) * [http://pan.uqam.ca/pan/pmwiki.php/HyperCard/HomePage/ HyperCard Pantechnicon] * [http://web.archive.org/web/20070430034246/http://members.aol.com/hcheaven/links/links.html A list of HyperCard links (Internet Archive)] * [http://folkstream.com/muse/teachhc/ Teach Yourself HyperCard] * [http://download.info.apple.com/Apple_Support_Area/Manuals/software/0340617AHYPERCARDI.PDF Hypercard Manual (pdf)] * [http://scripteur.com/cormoran/as/osa/appl/HyperCard/dico/objets/application.html HyperCard and AppleScript]: in [[French language|French]] <!-- does anyone have a better reference on this topic? --> * [http://groups.google.com/group/comp.sys.mac.HyperCard comp.sys.mac.HyperCard] The original Usenet group now enshrined as a Google Group that is still somewhat active. * [http://www.creysoft.com/xtalk Open Source xTalk Interpreter Archive]: An attempt to organize open source HyperCard/HyperTalk clones {{Apple software}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Hypercard}} [[Category:1987 software]] [[Category:Domain-specific programming languages]] [[Category:Hypertext]] [[Category:Hypercard products]] [[Category:Mac OS-only software made by Apple Inc.]] [[ca:HyperCard]] [[de:HyperCard]] [[es:HyperCard]] [[fr:HyperCard]] [[ko:하이퍼카드]] [[it:HyperCard]] [[nl:HyperCard]] [[ja:HyperCard]] [[no:HyperCard]] [[pt:HyperCard]] [[fi:HyperCard]] [[sv:HyperCard]] [[zh:HyperCard]]</text> </page> <page> <id>17175</id> <title>Hyperbolic geometry</title> <text>[[Image:Hyperbolic.svg|frame|right|Lines through a given point ''P'' and asymptotic to line ''R''.]] <!-- FAIR USE of Hyperbolic_parallels.gif: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Hyperbolic_parallels.gif for rationale --> <!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Hyperbolic_parallels.gif|frame|right|hyperbolic lines that violate the [[parallel postulate]]]] --> [[Image:Hyperbolic triangle.svg|thumb|250px|right|A triangle immersed in a saddle-shape plane (a [[hyperbolic paraboloid]]), as well as two diverging ultraparallel lines.]] In [[mathematics]], '''hyperbolic geometry''' (also called '''[[Nikolai Lobachevsky|Lobachevskian]] geometry''' or '''[[János Bolyai|Bolyai]]-Lobachevskian geometry''') is a [[non-Euclidean geometry]], meaning that the [[parallel postulate]] of [[Euclidean geometry]] is replaced. The parallel postulate in Euclidean geometry is equivalent to the statement that, in two dimensional space, for any given line ''l'' and point ''P'' not on ''l'', there is exactly one line through ''P'' that does not intersect ''l''; i.e., that is parallel to ''l''. In hyperbolic geometry there are at least two distinct lines through ''P'' which do not intersect ''l'', so the parallel postulate is false. [[#Models of the hyperbolic plane|Models]] have been constructed within Euclidean geometry that obey the axioms of hyperbolic geometry, thus proving that the parallel postulate is independent of the other postulates of Euclid. Because there is no precise hyperbolic analogue to Euclidean parallel lines, the hyperbolic use of ''parallel'' and related terms varies among writers. In this article, the two limiting lines are called ''asymptotic'' and lines sharing a common perpendicular are called ''ultraparallel''; the simple word ''parallel'' may apply to both. A characteristic property of hyperbolic geometry is that the angles of a [[hyperbolic triangle#Hyperbolic geometry|triangle]] add to ''less'' than a [[straight angle]] (half circle). In the limit as the vertices go to infinity, there are even [[ideal triangle|ideal hyperbolic triangles]] in which all three angles are 0°. ==Non-intersecting lines== An interesting property of hyperbolic geometry follows from the occurrence of more than one parallel line through a point ''P'': there are two classes of non-intersecting lines. Let ''B'' be the point on ''l'' such that the line ''PB'' is perpendicular to ''l''. Consider the line ''x'' through ''P'' such that ''x'' does not intersect ''l'', and the angle θ between ''PB'' and ''x'' counterclockwise from ''PB'' is as small as possible; i.e., any smaller angle will force the line to intersect ''l''. This is called an '''asymptotic line''' in hyperbolic geometry. Symmetrically, the line ''y'' that forms the same angle θ between ''PB'' and itself but clockwise from ''PB'' will also be asymptotic. ''x'' and ''y'' are the only two lines asymptotic to ''l'' through ''P''. All other lines through ''P'' not intersecting ''l'', with angles greater than θ with ''PB'', are called '''ultraparallel''' (or '''disjointly parallel''') to ''l''. Notice that since there are
