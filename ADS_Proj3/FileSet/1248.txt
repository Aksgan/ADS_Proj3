Dos Navigator] }} '''Dos Navigator''' is a [[free software|free]] [[orthodox file manager]] for [[DOS]] and Windows. == Influence of Dos Navigator == Dos Navigator is an influential early implementation of [[Orthodox File Manager]] (OFM). By implementing three additional types of [[Virtual file system]] (VFS): Xtree, Briefcase and List-based, DN opened a new generation of OFMs. Also unlimited number of panels and a lot of new important features make it one of the most powerful (and complex) OFMs.<ref name="DNOFM">{{cite web |url=http://www.softpanorama.org/OFM/Paradigm/Ch03/dos_navigator.shtml |title=DN line -- a breakthrough in VFS |publisher=Softpanorama University |authorlink=Dr Nikolai Bezroukov}}</ref> == History == The initial version of DN I (v 0.90) was released in 1991, and written by Stefan Tanurkov, Andrew Zabolotny and Sergey Melnik (all from [[Chişinău]], [[Moldova]]). After that, DN was rewritten using [[Turbo Vision]] by Stefan Tanurkov and Dmitry Dotsenko (Dmitry developed DN at [[Moscow State University]]). These versions are sometimes referred as DN II. In 1993, Slava Filimonov invited Stefan to join [[RitLabs]] (formerly RIT S.R.L) in order to continue producing and publishing DN with joint efforts. Slava also contributed programming new components, design and made countless optimizations and improvements. He wrote a new software key protection system which remained unbreakable for almost four years after its introduction.<ref>[http://www.woodmann.com/fravia/fp_dosna.htm DN as a nice example of DOS cracking]</ref> DN II was actively developed until the beginning of 1995 (until version 1.35 which should be considered as a [http://www.softpanorama.org/OFM/Paradigm/Ch03/dos_navigator.shtml milestone in the OFM implementations]). Several other programmers participated in the development after version 1.35. Starting from version 1.37, Slava Filimonov and Ilya Bagdasarov were in charge of bug-fixing. Slava and Ilya Bagdasarov solely maintained, developed and released versions 1.37 through 1.39. After they left, DN was maintained again by Stefan and newly acquired developer - Maxim Masiutin. In 1998, the development mostly took a bug-fixing direction as RITlabs' new product [[The Bat!]] became a more promising software product with much better commercial potential. The latest shareware version was 1.50. Then, in late 1999, [[RitLabs]] decided to make version 1.51 of the Dos Navigator completely free with freely available source code.

In most [[object-oriented]] systems, the concrete function that is called from a function call in the code depends on the dynamic type of a single object and therefore they are known as single dispatch calls, or simply [[virtual function]] calls. ==Examples== Double dispatch is useful in situations where the choice of computation depends on the runtime types of its arguments. For example, a programmer could use double dispatch in the following situations: * ''Adaptive collision algorithms'' usually require that collisions between different objects are handled in different ways. A typical example is in a game environment where
