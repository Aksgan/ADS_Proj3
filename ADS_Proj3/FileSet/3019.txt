in a way which is unlikely to scare younger children. Drug use is not allowed. * '''13+''' Unsuitable for children under age 13. Children under 13 must be accompanied by an adult at all times. Stronger fantasy violence may be present, but if there is any blood it will be kept to a minimum. Explicit language is allowed but it cannot be used throughout. Mild sexual content is allowed, as is very mild sexual nudity but only if it is brief and implied. Strong horror moments are acceptable if it is deemed to be appropriate for young teenagers. Infrequent use of milder drugs is allowed. * '''16+''' Unsuitable for children under age 16. Children under 16 will not be allowed to buy media with this rating regardless of whether they are accompanied by an adult. Realistic violence is allowed to a certain extent, and moderate detail of injury is also acceptable. There is no restrictions on language at the "16+" category. Moderate sexual content and mild sexual nudity is acceptable. Horror mixed with violence is acceptable in most cases. Drug use is permitted so long as it is not explicit. * '''18+''' Most certainly unsuitable for children, and there for off-limits from children and media with this category must be placed in a separate room. Pretty much anything that is not appropriate for children is accepted so long as it is within the law. This rating is very rarely used. ==Chile== The Council of Cinematographic Classification (''Consejo de Calificación Cinematográfica'') uses the following system: *'''TE''' ''(Todo Espectador)'' - For all audiences. *'''Mayores de 14 años''' - Inappropriate for children younger than 14. *'''Mayores de 18 años''' - Suitable for people aged 18 and older.

The classifications are: * '''T''': for general audiences. The T means "Todos", meaning "all." * '''7''': for movies suitable for children aged 7 and above. * '''12''': for movies suitable for children aged 12 and above. * '''15''': for movies suitable for children aged 15 and above. * '''18''': for movies suitable for people aged 18 and above. * '''X''': for [[pornography]]. *'''Banned''': for movies "containing elements inciting to crime or making a concrete endorsement of it." * '''E''': Exempt. ==Czech Republic== * '''U''' - Suitable for all audiences * '''12''' - Suitable for children 12 and over * '''15''' - Suitable for children 15 and over * '''18''' - Suitable for viewers 18 and over * '''E''' - Exempt from classification ==Denmark== Prior to 1997, the released in Denmark were rated by the National Board of Film Censorship and the possible classifications were: *'''A''': Approval of the film for general admittance. *'''7''': Approval of the film for admittance of children from the age of 7. (Introduced in 1980) *'''12''': Approval of the film for admittance of children from the age of 12. (Introduced in 1960) *'''16''': Approval of the film for admittance of children from the age of 16. The laws were then relaxed and the ratings were made less strict. The [http://www.medieraadet.dk/html/gb/gb.htm Media Council for Children and Young People] currently rates films.

(Square in a yellow background) *'''15''': Approval of the film for admittance of children from the age of 15. (Circle in a red background) Children who have turned 7 are allowed admission to all films if accompanied by an adult (a person turned 18). Consequently it is the responsibility of the parents to ensure that their children do not watch violent and hard-core pornographic films. Films accessible to the public do not have to be classified by the Media Council but consequently must be labeled as 15 - approval of the film for admittance of children from the age of 15 – no matter the content of the film. ==Egypt== The Egyptian government has only three movie classifications: *'''General Audience''' - Everyone is admitted. *'''Adults Only''' - Restricted to audiences aged 18 and above. *'''Exempt from Classification''' Usually excessive violence, nudity, and sexuality is cut from motion pictures in order to release with a General audience certificate. ==Estonia== * '''PERE''' - Suitable even for the youngest children * '''L''' - For all audiences with no age limit * '''MS-6''' - Under 6 not recommended * '''MS-12''' - Under 12 not recommended * '''K-12''' - Under 12 not allowed.
