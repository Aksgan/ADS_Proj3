three other players simultaneously. ==Criticism== {{Unreferenced section|date=February 2009}} The term "user-generated content" has received some criticism. The criticism to date has addressed issues of fairness, quality, privacy, the sustainable availability of creative work and effort among legal issues namely related to intellectual property rights such as copyrights etc. Some commentators assert that the term "user" implies an illusory or unproductive distinction between different kinds of "publishers", with the term "users" exclusively used to characterize publishers who operate on a much smaller scale than traditional mass-media outlets or who operate for free.<ref name="CritiqueUGC">{{cite news | title=Guardian Unlimited website: The trouble with user generated content | url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/organgrinder/2007/01/the_trouble_with_user_generate.html | accessdate=2007-02-10 | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Jemima | last=Kiss | date=2007-01-03}}</ref> Such classification is said to perpetuate an unfair distinction that some argue is diminishing because of the prevalence and affordability of the means of production and publication. A better response{{Says who|date=October 2010}} might be to offer optional expressions that better capture the spirit and nature of such work, such as EGC, Entrepreneurial Generated Content (see external reference below). Another concern is often raised relating to the privacy of personal information. Naive and beginning users may fail to make the distinction between public and private/personal information, sharing data that could make them vulnerable to harm ranging from financial to physical. Further, the social networking sites sometimes reveal personal information by default, either requiring the users to turn off viewing or sometimes not providing a way to hide or cancel information deemed personal by many. Public criticism has helped to correct the worst of such situations.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Sometimes creative works made by individuals are lost because there are limited or no ways to precisely preserve creations when a UGC Web site service closes down. One example of such loss is the closing of the Disney [[massively multiplayer online game]] "[[VMK]]". VMK, like most games, has items that are traded from user to user. Many of these items are rare within the game. Users are able to use these items to create their own rooms, avatars and pin lanyard. This site shut down at 10 PM CDT on May 21, 2008. There are ways to preserve the essence, if not the entirety of such work through the users copying text and media to applications on their personal computers or recording live action or animated scenes using screen capture software, and then uploading elsewhere. Long before the Web, creative works were simply lost or went out of publication and disappeared from history unless individuals found ways to keep them in personal collections. ==Legal problems related to UGC== '''Liability Of Websites That Allow UGC''': Websites are generally immune under U.S. law from liability if user generated content is defamatory, deceptive or otherwise harmful. The website is immune even if it knows that the third-party content is harmful and refuses to take it down. An exception to this general rule may exist if a website promises to take down the content and then fails to do so.<ref>Computerworld. (2010): Is 'go away' the best response to complaints about user-generated content?, http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9179594/Is_go_away_the_best_response_to_complaints_about_user_generated_content_?taxonomyId=14</ref> '''Copyright Dilemma''': Imagine a video of you having fun with your friends in the popular rhythms of [[Michael Jackson]] or [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], for instance. A good example of possible copyright infringement occurs when people post such material into online services like [[YouTube.com]] for everyone to see. Therefore, UGC can consist of partly or completely copyright protected material and it can be distributed online without a permission from the original right holder. '''Internet Service Providers Liability''': In the context of third party copyright violations, it is important to consider the liability issues between the content provider and the Internet service provider ([[ISP]]). In the legal literacy scholars<ref>Dinusha Mendis. (2003): “The Historical Development of Exceptions to Copyright and Its Application to Copyright Law in the Twenty-first Century”, vol 7.5 Electronic Journal on Comparative Law, http://www.ejcl.org/ejcl/75/art75-8.html</ref> have established two distinct models of liability as regards to ISP. These can be divided into "publishing information doctrine" and "storing information doctrine". According to the former view, ISP controls or at least has the ability to control the content published by using their services. In other words, ISP acts as a host and has the editorial control to take down and monitor content posted online. In order to establish secondary liability it is pivotal to evaluate the level of control practiced by the ISP. The latter view, on the other hand, applies to situations in where ISP acts as a mere host provider lacking any editorial role to the content posted online. Even though ISP might have awareness of the content run by using their services, it has no possibility to monitor or modify information. In general, there are some differences in legislation between the US approach on ISP liability and the EU approach. In the US, the ISP liability is regulated under the [[DMCA]] which deals only with copyright issues. Section 512 stipulates so-called [[Safe Harbor Provisions]] under which ISP can in certain detailed conditions escape liability. For example, ISP's are required to adopt a special take down policy,<ref>17 U.S.C. § 512(i)(1)(A)</ref> which allows individuals to respond to alleged copyright violations. The EU approach is horizontal<ref>Waelde, Charlotte and Edwards, Lilian. (2005): “Online Intermediaries and Copyright Liability” WIPO Workshop Keynote Paper, Geneva, April 2005. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1159640</ref> by nature which means that civil and criminal liability issues are addressed under the [[Directive 2000/31/EC]] of the E-Commerce. Sections 4 deals with liability of the ISP while conducting "mere conduit" services, caching and web hosting services.<ref>See art. 12-13 of the Directive 2000/31/EC</ref> '''Content Providers Liability''': The question of direct liability of the content provider might arise when [[uploading and downloading]] material in the Internet. Prior to UGC, direct liability issues have been tackled in so-called [[file sharing]] cases.<ref>Mazziotti, Giuseppe. (2008): “EU Digital Copyright Law and the End-User”,</ref> This technology, much like in UGC, allows unauthorized reproduction and dissemination of information and the fundamental question of liability is determined according to copyright exceptions.
