set of points closest to a single point in ''S'', an ''n''th-order Voronoi cell is defined as the set of points having a particular set of ''n'' points in ''S'' as its ''n'' nearest neighbors. Higher-order Voronoi diagrams also subdivide space. Higher-order Voronoi diagrams can be generated recursively. To generate the ''n''<sup>th</sup>-order Voronoi diagram from set ''S'', start with the (''n'' &minus; 1)<sup>th</sup>-order diagram and replace each cell generated by ''X'' = {''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''&minus;1</sub>} with a Voronoi diagram generated on the set ''S'' &minus; ''X''. == Generalizations == Voronoi cells can be defined for metrics other than Euclidean (such as the [[Mahalanobis distance|Mahalanobis]] or [[Manhattan distance|Manhattan]]) distances. However in these cases the Voronoi tessellation is not guaranteed to exist (or to be a "true" tessellation), since the equidistant locus for two points may fail to be subspace of codimension 1, even in the 2-dimensional case. Voronoi cells can also be defined by measuring distances to objects that are not points. The Voronoi diagram with these cells is also called the [[medial axis]]. Even when the objects are line segments, the Voronoi cells are not bounded by straight lines. The medial axis is used in image segmentation, [[optical character recognition]] and other computational applications. In materials science, polycrystalline microstructures in metallic alloys are commonly represented using Voronoi tessellations. A simplified version of the Voronoi diagram of line segments is the [[straight skeleton]]. A [[weighted Voronoi diagram]] is the one in which the function of a pair of points to define a Voronoi cell is a distance function modified by multiplicative or additive weights assigned to generator points. [[Image:ApproximateVoronoiDiagram.png|right|thumb|Approximate Voronoi diagram of a set of points. Notice the blended colors in the fuzzy boundary of the Voronoi cells.]] The Voronoi diagram of ''n'' points in ''d''-dimensional space requires <math>O(n^{\lceil d/2 \rceil})</math> storage space. Therefore, Voronoi diagrams are often not feasible for ''d'' > 2. An alternative is to use [[approximate Voronoi diagram]]s, where the Voronoi cells have a fuzzy boundary, which can be approximated.<ref>S. Arya, T. Malamatos, and [[David Mount|D. M. Mount]], [http://www.cs.ust.hk/faculty/arya/pub/stoc02.pdf Space-Efficient Approximate Voronoi Diagrams], Proc. 34th ACM Symp. on Theory of Computing (STOC 2002), pp. 721&ndash;730.</ref> ==Applications== One of the early applications of Voronoi diagrams was by [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] to study the [[epidemiology]] of the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak]] in Soho, England. He showed the correlation between areas on the map of London using a particular water pump, and the areas with most deaths due to the outbreak. A [[point location]] data structure can be built on top of the Voronoi diagram in order to answer [[nearest neighbor]] queries, where one wants to find the object that is closest to a given query point. Nearest neighbor queries have numerous applications. For example, when one wants to find the nearest hospital, or the most similar object in a [[database]]. A large application is [[vector quantization]], commonly used in [[data compression]]. With a given Voronoi diagram, one can also find the [[Largest empty sphere|largest empty circle]] amongst a set of points, and in an enclosing polygon; e.g. to build a new supermarket as far as possible from all the existing ones, lying in a certain city. The Voronoi diagram is useful in polymer physics. It can be used to represent free volume of the polymer. It is also used in derivations of the capacity of a [[wireless network]]. In climatology, Voronoi diagrams are used to calculate the rainfall of an area, based on a series of point measurements. In this usage, they are generally referred to as Thiessen polygons. Voronoi diagrams are used to study the growth patterns of forests and forest canopies, and may also be helpful in developing predictive models for forest fires. Voronoi diagrams are also used in computer graphics to procedurally generate some kinds of organic looking textures. In autonomous [[robot navigation]], Voronoi diagrams are used to find clear routes. If the points are obstacles, then the edges of the graph will be the routes furthest from obstacles (and theoretically any collisions). In [[computational chemistry]], Voronoi cells defined by the positions of the nuclei in a molecule are used to compute [[partial charge|atomic charge]]s. This is done using the [[Voronoi deformation density]] method. Voronoi Polygons have been used in [[mining]] to estimate the reserves of valuable materials, minerals or other resources. Exploratory drillholes are used as the set of points in the Voronoi polygons. == See also == ;Algorithms * [[Bowyer–Watson algorithm]] -- an algorithm for generating a Voronoi diagram in any number of dimensions. * [[Fortune's algorithm]] -- an [[Big O notation|O]](''n'' log(''n'')) algorithm for generating a Voronoi diagram from a set of points in a plane. * [[Lloyd's algorithm]] ;Related subjects * [[Centroidal Voronoi tessellation]] * [[Computational geometry]] * [[Delaunay triangulation]] * [[Mathematical diagram]] * [[Nearest neighbor search]] * [[Nearest-neighbor interpolation]] * [[Voronoi Pole|Pole]] ==Notes== <references/> ==References== * [[Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]] (1850).
