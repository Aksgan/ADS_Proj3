higher orbit to minimise the risk that the satellite will be a collision hazard to other satellites in the geostationary arc (graveyard burn). Unplanned stewardship cessation will occur if telecommand access to the satellite's systems is cut off due to a failure, for instance in the telecommand receivers. Reasons for stewardship cessation include: *Illegal or inappropriate disposal by the last user *Unreasonable budgetary constraints from government or other body *Cultural change by stewards leading to [[negligence]] *[[Climate change]] putting the system beyond reach (under sea or ice) *[[Global war]] *Other [[Disaster|catastrophe]] leading to very few humans (e.g. [[epidemic]]) *Societal breakdown *For remotely operated systems, loss of [[communication]] with the remote segment of the system. {{Unreferenced|date=May 2007}} [[Category:Conservation]] [[Category:Systems engineering]] {{engineering-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>35799</id> <title>Stieltjes matrix</title> <text>In [[mathematics]], particularly [[matrix theory]], a '''Stieltjes matrix''' is a [[real numbers|real]] [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]] [[positive definite]] [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] with [[nonpositive]] [[off-diagonal]] entries. A Stieltjes matrix is necessarily an [[M-matrix]]. Every ''n×n'' Stieltjes matrix is invertible to a nonsingular symmetric matrix with [[nonnegative]] entries, though the converse of this statement is not true in general for ''n'' > 2. From the above definition, a Stieltjes matrix is a symmetric invertible [[Z-matrix_(mathematics)|Z-matrix]] whose eigenvalues have positive real parts. As it is a Z-matrix, its off-diagonal entries are less than or equal to zero. == See also == * [[Hurwitz matrix]] * [[Metzler matrix]] ==References== * {{cite book | title=Iterative Solution of Large Linear Systems | author=David M.

Stiquito is unique not only because it is so inexpensive but also because its applications are almost limitless. [[Image:Stiquito_Robot_Original.JPG‎|thumb|right|300px|A ''Stiquito''.]] Stiquito's "muscles" are made of [[nitinol]], a [[shape memory alloy]] that expands and contracts, roughly emulating the operation of a muscle. The application of heat causes a crystalline structure change in the wire. Nitinol contracts when heated and returns to its original size and shape when cooled. Stiquito was developed by Jonathan W. Mills of [[Indiana University]] as an inexpensive vehicle for his research. He soon found its applications extended to educational uses. It has been used to introduce students to the concepts of [[analogue electronics]], [[digital electronics]], computer control, and [[robotics]]. It has also been used for advanced topics such as [[subsumption architecture]]s, [[artificial intelligence]], and advanced [[computer architecture]]. ==Further reading== These books contain instructions for building the Stiquito robot, instructions for designing and building control circuits, and examples of student projects that use Stiquito. Most importantly, the books contain all the supplies needed to build the robot. *{{cite book|author=James M. Conrad and Jonathan W. Mills|title=Stiquito(tm): Advanced Experiments with a Simple and Inexpensive Robot|publisher=IEEE Computer Society Press|location=Los Alamitos, CA|year=1997|isbn=0-8186-7408-3}} This first book contains chapters written by the co-author, their students, and other roboticists. These chapters describe the Stiquito Robots, their applications, and examples of Stiquito's robot cousins. Of note is a chapter by well known robot inventor [[Mark Tilden]]. The kit included inside the book is the original Stiquito robot. *{{cite book|author=James M. Conrad and Jonathan W. Mills|title=Stiquito(tm) for Beginners: An Introduction to Robotics|publisher=IEEE Computer Society Press|location=Los Alamitos, CA|year=1999|isbn=0-8186-7514-4}} This second book has more of an educational bend. It includes experiments with electricity, electronics, and nitinol. It also has several examples of computer/microcontroller control of the Stiquito Robot. The kit included inside the book is the original Stiquito robot. *{{cite book|author=James M. Conrad|title=Stiquito(tm) Controlled!

The kit included inside the book is the [[TI MSP430]]-based controller board and the Stiquito robot, “Stiquito Controlled”. The first book was compiled from material written between 1991 and 1996. The chapter has more of a "research" feel since it shows the base robot and slight variations and applications of it. The second book was compiled from materials written specifically for education. It includes instructions of control using supplemental kits. The third book is also educationally-based. It is a slight departure from the first two books because the third book (and the included kit) are centered around a microcontroller board and its leg actuation electronics. ==External links== *[http://www.stiquito.com Stiquito home page] [[Category:Hobbyist robots]] [[Category:Educational robots]]</text> </page> <page> <id>35815</id> <title>Stochastic hill climbing</title> <text>{{Unreferenced stub|auto=yes|date=December 2009}} '''Stochastic hill climbing''' is a variant of the basic [[hill climbing]] method. While basic hill climbing always chooses the steepest uphill move, stochastic hill climbing chooses at random from among the uphill moves. The probability of selection may vary with the steepness of the uphill move. ==See also== * [[Stochastic gradient descent]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Stochastic Hill Climbing}} [[Category:Optimization algorithms]] {{Compu-AI-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>35829</id> <title>Stone duality</title> <text>In [[mathematics]], there is an ample supply of [[duality of categories|categorical dualities]] between certain [[category theory|categories]] of [[topological space]]s and categories of [[partially ordered set]]s. Today, these dualities are usually collected under the label '''Stone duality''', since they form a natural generalization of [[Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras]]. These concepts are named in honor of [[Marshall Stone]]. Stone-type dualities also provide the foundation for [[pointless topology]] and are exploited in [[theoretical computer science]] for the study of [[formal semantics]]. This article gives pointers to special cases of Stone duality and explains a very general instance thereof in detail. ==Overview of Stone-type dualities== Probably the most general duality which is classically referred to as "Stone duality" is the duality between the category '''Sob''' of [[sober space]]s with [[continuous function]]s and the category '''SFrm''' of spatial [[complete Heyting algebra|frames]] with appropriate frame homomorphisms. The [[dual (category theory)|dual category]] of '''SFrm''' is the category of [[complete Heyting algebra|locales]] denoted by '''SLoc'''.
