in two complex conditionals, if they are similar. Thus, <math>\forall{x}(P{x} \to Q{x})</math>, or "All ''P''<nowiki></nowiki>s are ''Q''<nowiki></nowiki>s," is contraposed to <math>\forall{x}(\neg Q{x} \to \neg P{x})</math>, or "All non-''Q''<nowiki></nowiki>s are non-''P''<nowiki></nowiki>s." ==Simple proof by contradiction== Suppose that it is given that :<math>(A \to B)\and \neg B</math> It is given that, if A is true, then B is true, and it is also given that B is not true. We can then show that A must not be true by contradiction. For, if A were true, then B would have to also be true (given). However, it is given that B is not true, so we have a contradiction. Therefore, A is not true (assuming that we are dealing with concrete statements that are either true or not true): :<math>(A \to B) \to (\neg B \to \neg A)</math> We can apply the same process the other way round: :<math>(\neg B \to \neg A)\and A</math> We also know that B is either true or not true. If B is not true, then A is also not true. However, it is given that A is true; so, the assumption that B is not true leads to contradiction and must be false. Therefore, B must be true: :<math>(\neg B \to \neg A) \to (A \to B)</math> Combining the two proved statements makes them logically equivalent: :<math>(A \to B) \iff (\neg B \to \neg A)</math> ==More rigorous proof of the equivalence of contrapositives== Logical equivalence between two propositions means that they are true together or false together. To prove that contrapositives are [[logically equivalent]], we need to understand when material implication is true or false. :<math>(P \to Q)</math> This is only false when ''P'' is true and ''Q'' is false. Therefore, we can reduce this proposition to the statement "False when ''P'' and not-''Q''" (i.e. "True when it is not the case that ''P'' and not-''Q''"): :<math>\neg(P \and \neg Q)</math> The elements of a [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]] can be reversed with no effect: :<math>\neg(\neg Q \and P)</math> We define <math>R</math> as equal to "<math>\neg Q</math>", and <math>S</math> as equal to <math>\neg P</math> (from this, <math>\neg S</math> is equal to <math>\neg\neg P</math>, which is equal to just <math>P</math>): :<math>\neg(R \and \neg S)</math> This reads "It is not the case that (''R'' is true and ''S'' is false)", which is the definition of a material conditional. We can then make this substitution: :<math>(R \to S)</math> When we swap our definitions of ''R'' and ''S'', we arrive at the following: :<math>(\neg Q \to \neg P)</math> ==Comparisons== {| class="wikitable" ! name !! form !! description |- | implication || if ''P'' then ''Q'' || first statement implies truth of second |- | inverse || if not ''P'' then not ''Q'' || negation of both statements |- | converse || if ''Q'' then ''P'' || reversal of both statements |- | contrapositive || if not ''Q'' then not ''P'' || reversal and negation of both statements |- | contradiction || if ''P'' then not ''Q'' || negation of second statement |} ===Examples=== Take the statement "''All red objects have color.''" This can be equivalently expressed as "''If an object is red, then it has color.''" * The '''[[contrapositive]]''' is "''If an object does not have color, then it is not red''". This follows logically from our initial statement and, like it, it is evidently true. * The '''[[Inverse (logic)|inverse]]''' is "''If an object is not red, then it does not have color.''" Again, an object which is blue is not red, and still has color. Therefore in this case the inverse is false. * The '''[[Conversion (logic)|converse]]''' is "''If an object has color, then it is red.''" Objects can have other colors, of course, so, the converse of our statement is false. * The '''[[contradiction]]''' is "''There exists a red object that does not have the properties of color''". ''If'' the contradiction were true, then both the converse and the inverse would be correct in exactly that case where the shade of red is not a color. However, in our world this statement is entirely untrue (and therefore false). In other words, the contrapositive is logically equivalent to a given [[conditional]] statement, though not sufficient for a [[biconditional]]. Similarly, take the statement "''All [[quadrilaterals]] have four sides,''" or equivalently expressed "''If a shape is a quadrilateral, then it has four sides.''" * The '''[[contrapositive]]''' is "''If a shape does not have four sides, then it is not a quadrilateral.''" This follows logically, and as a rule, contrapositives share the [[truth value]] of their conditional. * The '''[[Inverse (logic)|inverse]]''' is "''If a shape is not a quadrilateral, then it does not have four sides.''" In this case, unlike the last example, the inverse of the argument is true. * The '''[[Conversion (logic)|converse]]''' is "''If a shape has four sides, then it is a quadrilateral.''" Again, in this case, unlike the last example, the converse of the argument is true. * The '''[[contradiction]]''' is "''There is at least one quadrilateral that does not have four sides.''" Since the statement and the converse are both true, it is called a [[biconditional]], and can be expressed as "'''A shape is a quadrilateral ''if, and only if,'' it has four sides.'''" That is, having four sides is both necessary to be a quadrilateral, and alone sufficient to deem it a quadrilateral. ===Truth=== * If a statement is true, then its contrapositive is always true (and vice versa). * If a statement is false, its contrapositive is always false (and vice versa). * If a statement's inverse is true, its converse is always true (and vice versa). * If a statement's inverse is false, its converse is always false (and vice versa). * If a statement's contradiction is false, then the statement is true (and vice versa). * If a statement (or its contrapositive) and the inverse (or the converse) are both true or both false, it is known as a [[logical biconditional]]. ==Application== Because the '''contrapositive''' of a statement always has the same truth value (truth or
