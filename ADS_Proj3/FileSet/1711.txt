Willard Gibbs]] in 1878, is the injunction to choose a [[statistical ensemble]] (probability distribution) for the unknown [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microscopic state]] of a [[thermodynamic system]] by minimising the average log probability :<math> H = \sum_i p_i \ln p_i \, </math> subject to the probability distribution satisfying a set of constraints (usually expectation values) corresponding to the known [[macroscopic]] quantities. Physicists call the result of applying the Gibbs algorithm the [[Gibbs distribution]] for the given constraints, most notably Gibbs's [[grand canonical ensemble]] for open systems when the average energy and the average number of particles are given. (See also ''[[Partition function (mathematics)|partition function]]''). In the light of [[Claude E. Shannon|Claude Shannon]]'s [[information theory]], in 1957 [[E.T. Jaynes]] re-interpreted the Gibbs algorithm as a much more general, more widely applicable inference technique, leading to the [[principle of maximum entropy]], and the [[Maximum entropy thermodynamics|MaxEnt view of thermodynamics]]. This general result of the Gibbs algorithm is then a [[maximum entropy probability distribution]]. Statisticians identify such distributions as belonging to [[exponential family|exponential families]]. ==Not to be confused with== The [[Gibbs sampler]], an update algorithm used in [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] iterations, a special case of the [[Metropolis-Hastings algorithm]]. {{DEFAULTSORT:Gibbs Algorithm}} [[Category:Statistical mechanics]] [[Category:Particle statistics]] [[Category:Entropy and information]]</text> </page> <page> <id>15266</id> <title>Gibiane</title> <text>'''Gibiane''' is a [[Programming language|computer programming language]] which was invented at [[Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique]] (CEA). ==External links== * [http://www.lip6.fr/reports/lip6.1997.019.html French description] [[Category:Programming languages]] {{compu-lang-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>15270</id> <title>Gideon Gartner</title> <text>'''Gideon I. Gartner''' (born 1935) is an [[entrepreneur]] and [[philanthropist]], best known as the founder of [[Gartner]], an [[information technology]] (IT) research and advisory company. He has been described as the [[patriarch]] of the IT [[industry analyst]] business, <ref>[http://www.informationweek.com/657/57iuan5.htm The Patriarch: Gideon Gartner, Giga Information Group<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> due to widespread adoption of the innovations he incorporated into Gartner as a second-generation information business. He has continued to champion [[information industry]] innovations, first through two other companies he founded—GiGa Information Group (now part of [[Forrester Research]]) and [[SoundView Technologies]] (now part of [[UBS AG]])—and today, as an advisor to young technology companies. == Early life == Gartner was born in [[Palestine]] and grew up in [[New York City]]. He attended the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), obtaining a BSME in 1956 and a [[Master's degree]] from the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] in 1960. == Early career == Gartner began his career in the computer business. At [[IBM]], he was Manager of Market
