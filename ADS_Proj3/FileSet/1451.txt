and iOpener, a Windows variant. Apple Computer introduced iTunes 6.0 in October 2005, which included changes intended to stop programs like JHymn from decrypting FairPlay encrypted files. Furthermore, once iTunes 6 has been used to purchase songs or authorize a computer with a particular iTMS account, that account will be blocked from making purchases or activations on earlier iTunes versions, thus JHymn can no longer be used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hymn-project.org/jhymndoc/ |title=JHymn Info and Help |publisher=Hymn-project.org |author=DRM |date= |accessdate=2008-09-13}}</ref> Apple Computer introduced iTunes 7.0 in September 2006, which once again included changes intended to stop programs similar to JHymn. ===Harmony: RealPlayer Music on the iPod=== In July 2004, [[RealNetworks]] introduced their Harmony technology. The Harmony technology is built into [[RealPlayer]] and allows users of the [[RealPlayer Music Store]] to play their songs on the [[iPod]]. Before the introduction of Harmony this was not possible, because the RealPlayer Music Store uses a different DRM scheme, called [[Helix DRM]], that was incompatible with that used by Apple. While using RealPlayer to transfer a Helix DRM-restricted song onto the iPod, Harmony transparently converts it to a FairPlay-compatible protected file. Real argued that Harmony was a boon to consumers that "frees" them "from the limitation of being locked into a specific portable device when they buy digital music."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realnetworks.com/company/press/releases/2004/harmony.html |title=RealNetworks Introduces Harmony, Enabling Consumers to Buy Digital Music that Plays on All Popular Devices |publisher=Realnetworks.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-13}}</ref> Apple responded: :We are stunned that RealNetworks has adopted the tactics and ethics of a [[software cracking|hacker]] to break into the iPod, and we are investigating the implications of their actions under the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] and other laws. We strongly caution Real and their customers that when we update our iPod software from time to time it is highly likely that Real's Harmony technology will cease to work with current and future iPods. RealNetworks launched an [[internet petition]] titled "Hey Apple! Don't break my iPod", encouraging iPod users to sign up to support Real's action. The petition backfired badly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hardware.silicon.com/storage/0,39024649,39123271,00.htm |title=Real v Apple music war: iPod freedom petition backfires - Hardware - Breaking Business and Technology News at silicon.com |publisher=Hardware.silicon.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-13}}</ref> The overwhelming majority of posters reacted negatively. The main points of criticism against Harmony were: * Many posters accused RealNetworks of [[astroturfing]] with the petition they had created. * RealNetworks was criticised for hypocrisy in keeping its own intellectual property and products closed, while asking Apple to open up the iPod. * The move was also denounced as an attempt to force Apple into a partnership that would only benefit RealNetworks. Apple did disable Harmony around the time of the [[iPod photo]] launch, and to older versions shortly after in firmware updates. The change makes it so that all music (past and present) purchased through the [[RealPlayer Music Store]] will not work on Apple's [[iPod]]. In response, Real said they would get it working again. In August 2005, an [[SEC filings|SEC filing]] by RealNetworks disclosed that continued use of the Harmony technology put themselves at considerable risk because of the possibility of a [[lawsuit]] from Apple, which would be expensive to defend against, even if the court agreed that the technology is legal. Additionally, the possibility that "Apple will continue to modify its technology to 'break' the interoperability that Harmony provides to consumers" would mean that "Harmony may no longer work with Apple's products, which could harm our business and reputation, or we may be forced to incur additional development costs to refine Harmony to make it interoperate again."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=1228 |title=AppleInsider &#124; Real admits risk of Apple lawsuit |publisher=Appleinsider.com |author=AppleInsider Staff |date= |accessdate=2008-09-13}}</ref> Harmony never resurfaced as an option by RealNetworks. ===Requiem=== Requiem was originally released by "Brahms" as version 1.0 in February 2008, and version 1.8.17 was released in early 2010. Requiem allows a person to decrypt both music and movies that they are authorized to play in iTunes by reverse-engineering Apple's FairPlay algorithm. Requiem does not remove identification tags from songs. However, there are other methods to remove them.<ref>{{ cite web|url=http://www.ghacks.net/2009/02/25/how-to-anonymize-itunes-songs/ |title=Removing private data from iTunes songs |accessdate=2009-02-10 }}</ref> Requiem works by decrypting the iTunes configuration files that are in "/Users/Shared/SC Info". In Mac OS X, the key to decrypt these config files is an obfuscated version of the [[MAC address]] of one's computer. In Windows, an amalgamation of hard drive volume information and registry keys are used instead of the MAC address. The initialization variable for this decryption is a [[hard coding|hard coded]] constant. The program then decrypts the keys in the config files as well as the private atoms in the audio/video files and creates unencrypted versions.<ref>Requiem 1.7.3 README file</ref> An updated [[iTunes version history|iTunes 7.6.2]] disabled Requiem, however, versions 1.4 and 1.5 again circumvented the protection. Apple again disabled Requiem with [[iTunes version history|iTunes 8]], but the author released version 1.8.2 which circumvents iTunes 8 DRM on Mac OS and Microsoft Windows systems. Apple responded by releasing iTunes 8.0.2, which again disabled Requiem. Apple has taken steps to remove references to Requiem from the JHymn forums. A [http://hymn-project.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=17241#17241 post on the JHymn forums] explains Apple's [[cease and desist]] order against the forum regarding posting information on circumvention technologies like Requiem. Since the C&D order, the author of Requiem initially made it available with source code on the anonymous [[Freenet]] network, but then moved it to a [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] [[Tor (anonymity network)#Hidden services|hidden service]]. From there it has been copied onto popular [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] public trackers, such as [[The Pirate Bay]]. On March 16, 2009, the day that iTunes 8.1 was released {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}, Requiem was updated several times, ending up with version 1.8.8. Requiem 1.8.8 decrypts files with iTunes 8.1.0.51, but, as before, Apple responded by releasing iTunes 8.1.0.52, which appears to again disable Requiem. As of May 5, 2009, Requiem 1.8.10 decrypts files with iTunes 8.1.1. On January 5, 2010, Requiem 1.8.16 was released for iTunes 9.0.2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tag3ulp55xczs3pn.tor2web.com/ |title=Requiem |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2009-10-12}}</ref> On January 21, 2010, Requiem 1.8.17 was released for iTunes 9.0.2 as a bug-fix to process
