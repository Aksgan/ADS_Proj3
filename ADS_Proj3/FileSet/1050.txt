video editing|edit]] controller for [[telecine]]s and [[VTR]]s. It gives accurate 2/3 editing. TLC 1 was originally made in [[Moorpark]], [[California]], later TLC was acquired by da Vinci and the TLC 2 was released. The da Vinci DUI 888 had an option to have a TLC built into it. If the TLC is not built in an external A/B switch box is needed to switch control between the TLC and other Color Controllers. Some versions had a separate CPU and Telecine interface rack. == See also == {{colbegin}} *[[digital intermediate]] *[[Display resolution]] *[[Film-out]] *[[Film recorder]] *[[post production]] *[[Direct to Disk Recording]] *[[TV]] *[[Hard disk recorder]] *[[3D LUT]] *[[Film restoration]] *[[Color correction]] {{colend}} == External links == * [http://www.davsys.com/ - da Vinci Systems web site] * [http://tig.colorist.org/wiki3/index.php/Da_Vinci_September_8,_2009 - Grant Petty announces purchase of Da Vinci Systems Ltd] * [http://www.finalcolor.com/history4colorists.htm A Brief History for Colorists, Updated Dec 21, 2009] [[Category:Film companies]] [[Category:Television companies]] [[Category:Video hardware]]</text> </page> <page> <id>9127</id> <title>Daemon (computer software)</title> <text>In [[Unix]] and other [[computer multitasking]] [[operating system]]s, a '''daemon''' ({{pron-en|ˈdeɪmən}} or {{IPA-en|ˈdiːmən|}})<ref name="jargon">{{Cite web|url=http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/D/daemon.html |title=daemon |author=Eric S.

Typically daemons have names that end with the letter "d": for example, <tt>[[syslogd]]</tt>, the daemon that handles the system log, or <tt>[[Secure Shell|sshd]]</tt>, which handles incoming [[Secure Shell|SSH]] connections. In a Unix environment, the [[parent process]] of a daemon is often (but not always) the [[init]] process ([[Process identifier|PID]]=1). Processes usually become daemons by [[Fork (operating system)|forking]] a child process and then having their parent process immediately exit, thus causing init to adopt the child process. This is a somewhat simplified view of the process as other operations are generally performed, such as dissociating the daemon process from any controlling [[tty (Unix)|tty]]. Convenience routines such as daemon(3) exist in some UNIX systems for that purpose. Systems often start (or "launch") daemons at [[booting|boot]] time: they often serve the function of responding to network requests, hardware activity, or other programs by performing some task. Daemons can also configure hardware (like [[udev]]d on some [[GNU/Linux]] systems), run scheduled tasks (like [[cron]]), and perform a variety of other tasks. ==Terminology== The term was coined by the programmers of [[Project MAC|MIT's Project MAC]]. They took the name from [[Maxwell's demon]], an imaginary being from a famous thought experiment that constantly works in the background, sorting molecules.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.takeourword.com/TOW146/page4.html|author=[[Fernando J.

[[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] and some of its derivatives have adopted a daemon as its [[BSD Daemon|mascot]], although this mascot is actually a [[cute]] variation of the [[demon]]s which appear in [[Christian]] artwork. [[Image:Bsd daemon.jpg|thumb|right|The BSD daemon, also called Beastie, as drawn by [[John Lasseter]].

However, more commonly, a daemon may be any background process, whether a child of <tt>init</tt> or not. The common method for a process to become a daemon involves: * Dissociating from the controlling [[tty (Unix)|tty]] * Becoming a session leader * Becoming a [[process group]] leader * Staying in the [[background (computer software)|background]] by [[fork (operating system)|forking]] and [[exit (operating system)|exiting]] (once or twice). This is required sometimes for the process to become a session leader. It also allows the parent process to continue its normal execution. This [[idiom]] is sometimes summarized with the phrase "fork off and die" * Setting the [[root directory]] ("/") as the current [[working directory]] so that the process will not keep any directory in use that may be on a mounted file system (allowing it to be unmounted). * Changing the [[umask]] to 0 to allow open(), creat(), et al. calls to provide their own permission masks and not to depend on the umask of the caller * Closing all inherited open files at the time of execution that are left open by the parent process, including file descriptors 0, 1 and 2 (stdin, stdout, stderr). Required files will be opened later. * Using a [[log file|logfile]], the [[system console|console]], or [[/dev/null]] as [[standard streams|stdin, stdout, and stderr]] {{Cleanup-laundry|date=September 2010}} === List of service daemons for Unix and Unix-like systems=== * [[Berkeley Automounter|amd]] - Auto Mount Daemon * [[anacron]] - Executed delayed cron tasks at boot time * [[apmd]] - Advanced Power Management Daemon * [[arpwatch]] - watches for Ethernet IP address pairings that are resolved using the ARP protocol * [[atd]] - Runs jobs queued using the at tool * [[bincimapd]] - An [[imap]] server daemon * [[biod]] - Cooperates with a remote [[nfsd]] to handle client [[Distributed file system|Network file system]] requests * [[bootparmd]] - A Internet Bootstrap Protocol server daemon * [[chttpd]] - An [[http]] server daemon * [[configd]] - A daemon that maintains dynamic configuration information about the computer and its environment (mainly the network) * [[crond]] - The task scheduler daemon * [[cupsd]] - [[CUPS]] printer daemon * [[devfsd]] - * [[dhcpd]] - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol and Internet Bootstrap Protocol Server * [[drakfont]] - A font server daemon used in Mandrake Linux * [[dpid]] - A plugin handler for the dillo
