tools are free to download and can be used for commercial or non-commercial use (Except for the OPEN-R SDK, which is specifically for non-commercial use). Since the first release of OPEN-R, several AIBO programming tools have been developed by university labs, including URBI <ref>[http://www.urbiforge.com/ URBI]</ref>, Tekkotsu <ref>[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tekkotsu/ Tekkotsu]</ref>, Pyro<ref>[http://pyrorobotics.org/ Pyro]</ref> and AiBO+<ref>[http://aiboplus.sourceforge.net AiBO+ home page]</ref>. The Open-R and gcc based toolchain has been updated by the community to use gcc 4.1.2, binutils 2.17 and newlib 2.15. The packaged version of the old and updated Aibo toolchain is available for Ubuntu in a PPA<ref>[http://launchpad.net/~csaba-kertesz/+archive/aiboplus Ubuntu PPA with Aibo toolchain]</ref>. AIBO's complete vision system uses the [[Scale-invariant feature transform|SIFT]] algorithm, to recognise its charging station. The newest versions are equipped with a [[Wi-Fi]] connection, allowing them to send the pictures they take via email which led to the [[Roblog]]. AIBO's sounds were programmed by Japanese DJ/avant-garde composer [[Nobukazu Takemura]], fusing mechanic and organic concepts.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} The bodies of the "3x" series (Latte and Macaron, the round-headed AIBOs released in 2001) were designed by visual artist [[Katsura Moshino]]. ==RoboCup== The AIBO has seen use as an inexpensive platform for [[artificial intelligence]] research, because it integrates a computer, vision system, and articulators in a package vastly cheaper than conventional research robots. The [[RoboCup]] autonomous [[soccer]] [[:Category:Robotics competitions|competition]] had a "RoboCup Four-Legged Robot Soccer League" in which numerous institutions from around the world would participate. Competitors would [[Computer program|program]] a team of AIBO robots to play games of autonomous robot soccer against other competing teams. The Four-Legged League ran from 1999 to 2008, although in the final year, many big-name universities did not compete as they had moved to the new NAO platform. The University of New South Wales <ref>[http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~robocup/2010site/]</ref> was the most successful team in the League, making the final six times and winning three times. ==International AIBO Convention== The International AIBO Convention takes place every year at Sony Robotics Tower in the Shinjuku prefecture. The first convention took place in 1999, on May 15. It was then set to May 2 to May 4. The 2009 convention, being in its tenth year, set attendance records. The convention usually features AIBO advertisements, free posters, free accessories, freeware/open-source downloads, an acoustic performance from best friends Mark Linn-Baker and Larry Sweeney, and "AIBO Shows". ==Breed lineage== After model name: body color choices; release date; units sold. ===First generation models=== [[File:AIBO ERS111 210.jpg|thumb|250px|AIBO models ERS-210 (left) and ERS-111 (right)]] *ERS-110: silver; began sales 1 June 1999 for delivery in August; limited production of 3,000 for Japan and 2,000 for the USA *ERS-111: grey and black; November 1999; 60,000 (estimated) ===Second generation models=== *ERS-210: black, silver, gold, red, blue, green, white (3 hues), champagne, etc.; 2001 *ERS-210A: several colors; 2002 *ERS-220: silver; 2002 (also available as a conversion kit for the ERS-210) *ERS-311 "Latte": cream; 2001 *ERS-311b "Latte": cream; 2002 *ERS-312 "Macaron": black; 2001 *ERS-31L "Pug": brown; 2002 *ERS-210A: cyber blue; 2003 Estimated sales for all second generation models: 60,000 ===Third Generation models=== *ERS-7: white; November 2003 *ERS-7M2: white and black; November 2004 *ERS-7M3: white, black, and champagne brown (called honey brown in Japan); October 2005 Estimated sales for all third generation models: 40,000 to 50,000 ==See also== {{Portal|Robotics}} *[[Domestic robot]] *[[i-Cybie]], another robotic dog. *[[Furby]], a robot toy made by Tiger Electronics. *[[Sony CISC]], which gives telephone technical support for AIBO. *[[QRIO]], a humanoid robot also developed by [[Sony]] *[[ASIMO]], a humanoid robot created by Honda. *[[Pleo]], robotic dinosaur. *[[Nao (robot)|Nao]], a humanoid robot replacing AIBO in Robocup competitions. *[[Genibo]], a robotic dog from Dasarobot. *[http://www.robocup.cl/uchilsim/ UCHILSIM], a physics based simulator of AIBO robots competing in RoboCup. ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.electronicpets.org/sony-aibo-ers7~p14.html Official Listing at ElectronicPets.org] *[http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press_Archive/199806/98-052/ Sony Develops OPEN-R Architecture for Entertainment Robots] *[http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press_Archive/199905/99-046/ Sony Launches Four-Legged Entertainment Robot] *[http://www.aiboworld.com/ Aiboworld forums, blogs, etc] *[http://www.aibo-life.org/ AIBO-Life: forums, faq, help] *[http://www.robotonline.net/en/list/robots/p=1&m=Sony&t=Animal-like&o=title&od=asc List of AIBO Dogs] [[Category:Robot Hall of Fame]] [[Category:Virtual pets]] [[Category:Robotics at Sony]] [[Category:Entertainment robots]] [[Category:Biomorphic robots]] [[Category:1999 introductions]] [[Category:Artistic and performing robots]] [[Category:1990s fads and trends]] [[de:Aibo]] [[es:Aibo]] [[eo:Aibo]] [[fr:Aibo]] [[hr:AIBO]] [[id:Aibo]] [[it:Aibo]] [[lb:AIBO]] [[lt:AIBO]] [[nl:AIBO]] [[ja:AIBO]] [[pl:AIBO]] [[pt:Aibo]] [[ru:AIBO]] [[sk:Aibo]] [[fi:AIBO]] [[sv:AIBO]] [[tr:AIBO]] [[zh:AIBO]]</text> </page> <page> <id>369</id> <title>AI Shogi 3</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=September 2008}} {{Infobox VG| title = AI Shogi 3 | image = [[File:AI Shogi 3 Cover.jpg]] | developer = [[I4 (company)|I4]] | publisher = [[I4 (company)|I4]] | engine = | released = {{vgrelease|JP=December 18, 1998}} | genre = [[Board game]] | modes = [[Single-player]], [[multiplayer]] | ratings = {{vgratings|ESRB=Everyone}} | platforms = [[Nintendo 64]] | media = | requirements = }} {{nihongo|'''''AI Shogi 3'''''|AI将棋3}} is a Japanese virtual board game for the [[Nintendo 64]], it was released only in Japan in [[1998]].

Providing with [[Object-oriented programming|OOP]]-style coding engine and [[AJAX]] requests handling functionality to create [[web2.0]] components. Due to OOP paradigm AJAX.OOP library can be easily extended with additional functionality or used as core for other projects. ==The JavaScript OOP Library== AJAX.OOP is a fast and scalable JavaScript Library for creating JavaScript/AJAX components in an object oriented way. Main feature - strong [[Object-oriented programming|OOP]] paradigm implementation.AJAX.OOP engine allows the programmer to: * Create classes with object-like defining syntax * Inherit classes (both AJAX.OOP-style defined and created with native JavaScript code) * Aggregate classes (including aggregation of self and parent class with special operators this.$_self and this.$_super) * Define constructors as they are (name = 'constructor') * Override parent class properties and methods (but call parent if you need by using special access operator this.$super) * Access/call any parent properties and/or methods from any method of child class (just use this.$super accessor whenever you need to access parent properties and methods) * Use strict defined objects
