the side of the socket is moved, pushing all the sprung contacts apart so that the IC can be inserted with very little force (generally the weight of the IC itself is sufficient with no external downward force required). The lever is then moved back, allowing the contacts to close and grip the pins of the IC. ZIF sockets are much more expensive than standard IC sockets and also tend to take up a larger board area due to the space taken up by the mechanism. Therefore they are only used when there is a good reason to do so. Large ZIF sockets are only commonly found mounted on [[Personal computer|PC]] [[motherboard]]s (from about the mid 1990s forward). These [[CPU socket]]s are designed to support a particular range of [[CPU]]s, allowing computer retailers and consumers to assemble motherboard/CPU combinations based on individual budget and requirements. The rest of the electronics industry has largely abandoned sockets and moved to surface mount components soldered directly to the board. Smaller ZIF sockets are commonly used in chip-testing and [[programming]] equipment, e.g. programming and testing on EEPROMs, Microcontrollers, etc. ==Universal test sockets== [[File:Picstart plus.jpg|thumb|right|Programming device for a [[PIC microcontroller]], with a dual in-line ZIF socket]] Standard [[Dual in-line package|DIP packages]] come in two widths (measured between pin centers), 0.3 in (7.62 mm) (skinny dip) for smaller devices (8-28 pin) and 0.6 in (15.24 mm) for larger devices (24-40 pin). To allow design of programmers and similar devices that supported a range of devices some in skinny dip and some in full width dip universal test sockets are produced. These have wide slots into which the pins drop allowing both 0.3 in and 0.6 in devices to be inserted. ==Ball grid array sockets== ZIF sockets can be used for [[ball grid array]] chips, particularly during development. These sockets tend to be unreliable, failing to grab all the balls. Another type of BGA socket, also free of insertion force but not a "ZIF socket" in the traditional sense, does a better job by using spring pins to push up underneath the balls. ==ZIF wire-to-board connectors== ZIF wire-to-board connectors are used for attaching wires to [[printed circuit board]]s inside [[electronics|electronic]] equipment. The wires, often formed into a [[ribbon cable]], are pre-stripped and the bare ends placed inside the connector. The two sliding parts of the connector are then pushed together, causing it to grip the wires. The most important advantage of this system is that it does not require a mating half to be fitted to the wire ends, therefore saving space and cost inside miniaturised equipment. See [[flexible flat cable]]. ==Hard disk drives== ZIF tape connections are used for connecting IDE and SATA disk drives (mostly 1.8'' factor). ZIF-style connectors for IDE hard drives were used primarily in the design of Ultra-Portable notebooks, and has since been phased out, as SATA has a relatively small-form-factor connector by default. ZIF tape connections are also heavily used in the design of the [[Apple Inc.]] [[iPod]] range of portable media players. ==See also== * [[Dual in-line package]] [[Category:CPU sockets]] [[ar:قوة إدخال معدومة]] [[ca:ZIF]] [[de:Zero Insertion Force]] [[es:Zero Insertion Force]] [[fr:Force d'insertion nulle]] [[ko:ZIF]] [[hu:Zero Insertion Force]] [[pl:ZIF]] [[pt:ZIF]] [[ru:ZIF]] [[sk:Zero Insertion Force]] [[fi:Nollavoimakanta]] [[sv:Zero Insertion Force]]</text> </page> <page> <id>41064</id> <title>Zero wait state</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=August 2009}} '''Zero wait state''' is a feature of a [[ Central processing unit | processor ]] or [[ computer ]] architecture in which the processor does not have to wait to perform [[ Memory (computers) | memory ]] access.
