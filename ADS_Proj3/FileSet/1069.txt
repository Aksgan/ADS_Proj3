<text>'''Analysis of data''' is a process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling '''[[data]]''' with the goal of highlighting useful [[information]], suggesting conclusions, and supporting decision making. Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names, in different business, science, and social science domains. [[Data mining]] is a particular data analysis technique that focuses on modeling and knowledge discovery for predictive rather than purely descriptive purposes. [[Business intelligence]] covers data analysis that relies heavily on aggregation, focusing on business information. In [[statistics|statistical applications]], some people divide data analysis into [[descriptive statistics]], [[exploratory data analysis]], and [[confirmatory data analysis]]. EDA focuses on discovering new features in the data and CDA on confirming or falsifying existing hypotheses. [[Predictive analytics]] focuses on application of statistical or structural models for predictive forecasting or classification, while [[text analytics]] applies statistical, linguistic, and structural techniques to extract and classify information from textual sources, a species of [[unstructured data]]. All are varieties of data analysis. [[Data integration]] is a precursor to data analysis, and data analysis is closely linked to [[data visualization]] and data dissemination. The term ''data analysis'' is sometimes used as a synonym for [[data modeling]]. ==Nuclear and particle physics== In [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[particle physics]] the data usually originate from the [[particle detector|experimental apparatus]] via a [[data acquisition]] system. It is then processed, in a step usually called ''data reduction'', to apply calibrations and to extract physically significant information. Data reduction is most often, especially in large particle physics experiments, an automatic, batch-mode operation carried out by software written ad-hoc. The resulting data ''n-tuples'' are then scrutinized by the physicists, using specialized software tools like [[ROOT]] or [[Physics Analysis Workstation|PAW]], comparing the results of the experiment with theory. The theoretical models are often difficult to compare directly with the results of the experiments, so they are used instead as input for [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo simulation]] software like [[Geant4]], predict the response of the detector to a given theoretical event, producing '''simulated events''' which are then compared to experimental data. See also: [[Computational physics]]. ==Qualitative data analysis== [[Qualitative research]] uses [[qualitative data analysis]] (QDA) to analyze text, interview transcripts, photographs, art, field notes of (ethnographic) observations, et cetera. ==The process of data analysis== Data analysis is a [[Process theory|process]], within which several phases can be distinguished:<ref>Adèr, 2008, p. 334-335.</ref> * Data cleaning * Initial data analysis (assessment of data quality) * Main data analysis (answer the original research question) * Final data analysis (necessary additional analyses and report) ==Data cleaning== Data cleaning is an important procedure during which the data are inspected, and erroneous data are—if necessary, preferable, and possible—corrected. Data cleaning can be done during the stage of data entry. If this is done, it is important that no subjective decisions are made. The guiding principle provided by Adèr (ref) is: during subsequent manipulations of the data, information should always be cumulatively retrievable. In other words, it should always be possible to undo any data set alterations. Therefore, it is important not to throw information away at any stage in the data cleaning phase. All information should be saved (i.e., when altering variables, both the original values and the new values should be kept, either in a duplicate dataset or under a different variable name), and all alterations to the data set should carefully and clearly documented, for instance in a syntax or a log.<ref>Adèr, 2008, p. 336-337.</ref> ==Initial data analysis== The most important distinction between the initial data analysis phase and the main analysis phase, is that during initial data analysis one refrains from any analysis that are aimed at answering the original research question. The initial data analysis phase is guided by the following four questions:<ref>Adèr, 2008, p. 337.</ref> ===Quality of data=== The quality of the data should be checked as early as possible. Data quality can be assessed in several ways, using different types of analyses: frequency counts, descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median), normality (skewness, kurtosis, frequency histograms, normal probability plots), associations (correlations, scatter plots).<br /> Other initial data quality checks are: *Checks on data cleaning: have decisions influenced the distribution of the variables? The distribution of the variables before data cleaning is compared to the distribution of the variables after data cleaning to see whether data cleaning has had unwanted effects on the data. *Analysis of [[Missing data|missing]] observations: are there many missing values, and are the values [[MAR|missing at random]]? The missing observations in the data are analyzed to see whether more than 25% of the values are missing, whether they are missing at random (MAR), and whether some form of [[imputation (statistics)]] is needed. *Analysis of [[Outlier|extreme observations]]: outlying observations in the data are analyzed to see if they seem to disturb the distribution. *Comparison and correction of differences in coding schemes: variables are compared with coding schemes of variables external to the data set, and possibly corrected if coding schemes are not comparable. The choice of analyses to assess the data quality during the initial data analysis phase depends on the analyses that will be conducted in the main analysis phase.<ref>Adèr, 2008, p. 338-341.</ref> by philip kotler ===Quality of measurements=== The quality of the [[measuring instrument|measurement instruments]] should only be checked during the initial data analysis phase when this is not the focus or research question of the study. One should check whether structure of measurement instruments corresponds to structure reported in the literature.<br /> There are two ways to assess measurement quality: *Confirmatory factor analysis *Analysis of homogeneity ([[internal consistency]]), which gives an indication of the [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] of a measurement instrument. During this analysis, one inspects the variances of the items and the scales, the [[Cronbach's alpha|Cronbach's &alpha;]] of the scales, and the change in the Cronbach's alpha when an item would be deleted from a scale.<ref>Adèr, 2008, p. 341-3342.</ref> ===Initial transformations=== After assessing the quality of the data and of the measurements, one might decide to impute missing data, or to perform initial transformations of one or
