=== Mob mentality === Unlike the present Digg algorithm, which works on user diversity, in 2006 it was much more dependent on flocking behavior among users to determine the promotion of content. During this period an anonymous user posted a blog accusing an O'Reilly writer of stealing Digg's CSS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://steveisbad.blogspot.com/2006/01/steve-mallett-from-oreilly-has-stolen.html |title=Steve Mallett from O'Reilly has stolen digg's code |author=Anonymous |date=JANUARY 09, 2006 |work= |publisher=STEVE'S THEFT |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref> The Digg mob flocked to the story and it was promoted with nearly 3000 votes. Digg founders Kevin Rose, Jay Adelson and Daniel Burka expressed dissatisfaction on finding Digg's code on Mallett's sites.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://digg.com/security/O_Reilly_writer_Steve_Mallett_has_stolen_digg_s_code |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060113141457/http://digg.com/security/O_Reilly_writer_Steve_Mallett_has_stolen_digg_s_code |archivedate=2006-01-13 |title=Archive.org mirror of the deleted Digg story |author=Digg |date=JANUARY 09, 2006 |work= |publisher=Digg |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref> Mallett responded and clarified that the theft of code was committed by the contributors to the open source Digg clone, Pligg, which he was using.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://steve.tawkr.com/2006/01/10/my-response/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060412182316/http://steve.tawkr.com/2006/01/10/my-response/ |archivedate=2006-04-12 |title=Archive.org mirror of the deleted blog post |author=Steve Mallett |date=January 10th, 2006 |work= |publisher=Archive |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref> Kevin acknowledged the misunderstanding and notified Pligg developers of the issue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://diggtheblog.blogspot.com/2006/01/steve-mallett-digg-code.html |title=Steve Mallett & Digg Code |author=Kevin Rose |date=January 2006 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref> Adelson contacted Mallett thanking him for clearing the issue and expressed support for his claims.
