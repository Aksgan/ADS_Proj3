and also have the ability to run inline shell scripts. ===Bundles=== TextMate language grammars, snippets, macros, commands, and templates can be grouped into “bundles” of functionality. Any snippet, macro, or command can be executed by pressing a keyboard shortcut, by typing a particular word and then pressing the “tab” key (so-called “tab triggers”), or by selecting the command from a menu. Tab triggers are particularly useful; the combination of tab triggers and snippets greatly eases coding in verbose languages, or languages with commonly-typed patterns. Snippets, macros, and commands can be limited to a particular scope, so that for instance the “close html tag” command does not work in a python script, freeing up that keyboard shortcut to be used for something else. This allows individual languages, and even individual scopes, to override built-in commands such as “Reformat Paragraph” with more specialized versions. Even common key such as the return key and spacebar can be overridden to make coding seamless. 36 bundles ship with TextMate, but a Subversion repository contains 121 bundles, for everything from [[Markdown]] to [[blog]]ging to [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] assembly language.<ref>For information on getting more bundles, see the [http://macromates.com/textmate/manual/bundles#getting_more_bundles relevant section in the TextMate manual].</ref> ===Project Management=== Several documents or folders can be opened at once in a TextMate project window, which provides a drawer along its side listing file and folder names, and a series of [[tab (GUI)|tab]]s across the top. Search and replace can be undertaken across an entire project, and commands can interact with the selected files or folders in the drawer. Bundles for [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]], Subversion<!-- this is linked in the previous paragraph. please don't link it again! -->, [[darcs]], and other [[revision control]] systems allow TextMate to manage versioned code. ===Other features=== TextMate has several other notable features: * [[folding editor|Folding code sections]] can be used to hide areas of a document not currently being edited, for a more compact view of code structure or to avoid distraction. The sections to be folded can be selected by hand, or the structure of the document itself can be used to determine foldings. * Regular-expression–based search and replace speeds complicated text manipulations. TextMate uses the [[Oniguruma]] regular expression library developed by K. Kosako.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2009-04-28 |url=http://manual.macromates.com/en/regular_expressions |title=20 Regular Expressions |publisher=TextMate }}</ref> * A function pop-up provides a list of sections or functions in the current document. * [[Clipboard (software)|Clipboard]] history allows users to cut many sections of text at once, and then paste them. * A column editing mode trivializes adding the same text to several rows of text, and is very useful for manipulating tabular data. * A WebKit-based HTML view window shows live updates as an HTML document is edited. ===Limitations=== TextMate does have a few limitations: * There is no support for variable-width or wide fonts, meaning that languages such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and others are not really supported, as their characters are wider than Latin characters. * There is no support for right-to-left languages such as Hebrew and Arabic. * TextMate has no built-in support for (S)FTP. <!-- this should probably link to that 'future directions' post already referenced earlier --> There are some workarounds mentioned at the TextMate Wiki.<ref>[http://wiki.macromates.com/Main/FAQ#projects How to edit files from my FTP Server as a TextMate project]. ''TextMate Wiki - FAQ: Projects''</ref> * Because TextMate is not tightly coupled to a scripting language, as [[Emacs]] is to [[Emacs Lisp|elisp]], it is impossible for users to have complete control over the behavior of some built-in commands such as those which indent sections of text or those which move columns around; however, many useful actions can be accomplished with TextMate’s macros and commands. Allan Odgaard explained his thoughts on the subject in an email to the TextMate mailing list.<ref>Allan Odgaard. “[http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/textmate/2007-February/017457.html Re: Changing cursor position from command]”. ''TextMate mailing list''. 14 February 2007.</ref> * No built-in HTML validator — because TextMate uses the [[W3C Markup Validation Service|W3C validator]] for HTML validation, users must be online to validate HTML. * Despite its substantial support for macros and snippets, TextMate has no built-in support for code-hinting or guided code-completion, so text editors that support these features may prove to be a better choice when learning the syntax of a new language. * TextMate is explicitly text only, and does not guarantee that arbitrary binary data in a file will be preserved through a load/save cycle, regardless of whether that data is edited. * TextMate's editing window is inaccessible with Max OS X [[VoiceOver]] and MonoMouse. ==Community== TextMate has a large and active community of users, dozens of whom contribute to the open-source bundle<ref>[http://manual.macromates.com/en/bundles Manual.macromates.com]</ref> subversion repository. The TextMate [[wiki]] has many hints and tips, feature suggestions, and links to external resources. The mailing list has medium traffic, but with a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio. A ticket system exists for filing bug reports and feature requests, and an [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] channel ([irc://irc.freenode.net/#textmate #textmate]) is usually active. TextMate users write code in many dozens of programming languages, and bundles have been written to support these. Most bundles are supported by primary users - for instance the [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] and [[Ruby on Rails]] bundles are supported by core developers for these languages libraries such as [[David Heinemeier Hansson]], Rails’ creator. ==Awards== TextMate 1.5 won the [[Apple Design Awards|Apple Design Award]] for best developer tool in [[2006]]. ==Notes== <!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:TextMate-original-icon.png|thumb|right|Original TextMate icon.]] --> <!-- To add a reference simply enclose the text you want to appear here inside a<ref></ref> pair in the correct place in the body of the article.--> {{reflist|2}} ==Further reading== * {{cite book | last = Gray | first = James Edward II | title = Textmate: Power Editing for the Mac | publisher = Pragmatic Bookshelf | year = 2007 | month = January | isbn = 097873923X | url = http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/textmate/ }} ==See also== * [[E Text Editor]] - a clone of TextMate for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Linux]]. ==External links== * {{official|http://www.macromates.com/}} * [http://textmate.org/ TextMate Community] [[Category:Mac OS X-only software]] [[Category:Mac OS X
