the most recent edition also allows for management and monitoring of other platforms such as Microsoft .NET, Microsoft SQL Server, NetApp Filers, BEA weblogic and others. Partners and IT organizations can build extensions to Oracle Enterprise Manager, and make them available to other Enterprise Manager users via [http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/oem/extensions/index.html Oracle Enterprise Manager 10g Grid Control Extensions Exchange]. The architecture of the OEM for Grid Control has three distinct components: # the collection agent (Oracle Management Agent or OMA) # the aggregation agent ([[Oracle Management Server]] or OMS) # the repository agent (Oracle Management Repository or OMR) The OMA runs on the target host and collects information on the hardware, operating system, and applications that run on the target. The OMS runs on one or two servers and collects the data generated by the OMAs. The OMS pulls the information from the OMAs and aggregates the collections into the [[Software repository|repository]]. The OMS also acts as the user-interface — by generating web-pages for [[database administrator]]s to view the status of systems and services. The OMR comprises an instance of the Oracle database that stores the data collected by the OMS. Installers can make the OMR highly available or [[Fault-tolerant system|fault-tolerant]] by running it on an [[Oracle RAC]] instance across multiple nodes. Plug-ins on each of the OMAs can customise or manipulate the data presented by the OEM by extending the data that the OMAs collect. Administrators can customize the analysis of the data with "management packs" to look at specific collections of data to display a system's performance. The {{as of|2006|alt=current}} release of OEM allows for the design and configuration of custom Plug-ins to monitor any application desired. OMAs collect the data using the custom-built plug-in and transmit the results in XML format back to the OMS, which then stores and analyzes the data as desired.Oracle Enterprise Manager continues to expand its monitoring scope by offering management plug-ins for non-Oracle components, that are both Oracle-developed and developed in partnership by third-party vendors. For example, Plug-ins for [[Veritas Storage Foundation]] (VxVM, VxFS) and [[Veritas Cluster Server]] (VCS), were announced and released on November 12, 2007, at Oracle OpenWorld. == Functionality == Oracle Enterprise Manager performs much of its activity through [[intelligent agents]] which Oracle Corporation refers to as '''Oracle Management Agents'''. These run as autonomous proxy processes on a managed node, and perform execution and monitoring tasks for Oracle Enterprise Manager, communicating using the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP or HTTPS). Oracle Release 10g has 14 additional packs (plug-ins) which require separate licensing. By default, upon installation, the OMA enables several packs(Change Management, Performance & Tuning, Diagnostics and Configuration Management) without any regard to what a customer has licensed. Users need to de-select unlicensed packs after installing the agent on a target database. == Implementation == OEM uses by default the <code>SYSMAN</code> schema in an Oracle database as a super-administrator account/repository. Utility programs such as <code>emctl</code> or <code>emdctl</code> carry out actual functions.<ref>[http://www.rootshell.be/~yong321/computer/oraclebin.html Oracle Executables<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. OEM also provides a command-line alternative, EMCLI (EM command line interface) with verbs to provide the same functionality as the UI-based EM. == External links == * [http://www.oracle.com/enterprise_manager/index.html Official Homepage] * [http://blogs.oracle.com/oem Oracle Enterprise Manager Blog] * [http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/oem/index.html Product Information] * [http://www.oracle.com/technology/documentation/oem.html Documentation] * [http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/oem/index.html Downloads] * [http://www.insight-oem.com Oracle Enterprise Manager, Oracle Enterprise Linux and Oracle VM Community & Knowledge Portal] == Footnotes == {{Reflist}}[http://yong321.freeshell.org/computer/oraclebin.html Oracle Executables] [[Category:Database administration tools]] [[Category:Oracle software]] [[de:Oracle Enterprise Manager]]</text> </page> <page> <id>27734</id> <title>Oral-formulaic composition</title> <text>The theory of '''oral-formulaic composition''' originated in the scholarly study of [[epic poetry]], being developed in the second quarter of the twentieth century. It seeks to explain two related issues: # the mechanism whereby some oral poets are able to improvise poetry; and # why orally improvised poetry has the characteristics it does. The key idea of the theory is poets have a store of formulas (a formula being 'an expression which is regularly used, under the same metrical conditions, to express a particular essential idea')<ref>Milman Parry, ''L’epithèt traditionnelle dans Homère'' (Paris, 1928), p. 16; cf. Albert B. Lord, ''The singer of tales'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1960), p. 4</ref> and that by linking these in conventionalised ways, they can rapidly compose verse. In the hands of [[Milman Parry]] and [[Albert Lord]], this approach transformed the study of ancient and medieval poetry, and [[oral poetry]] generally. The main exponent and developer of their approaches today is [[John Miles Foley]]. ==Homeric verse as a source of examples== In Homeric verse, a phrase like ''eos rhododaktylos'' ("rosy fingered dawn") or ''oinops pontos'' ("winedark sea") occupies a certain metrical pattern that fits, in modular fashion, into the six-colon Greek [[hexameter]], and aids the ''aoidos'' or bard in extempore composition. Moreover, phrases of this type would be subject to internal substitutions and adaptations, permitting flexibility in response to narrative and grammatical needs: ''podas okus axilleus'' ("swift footed Achilles") is metrically equivalent to ''koruthaiolos ektor'' ("glancing-helmed Hektor"). Formulae could also be combined into ''[[type-scene]]s'', longer, conventionalised depictions of generic actions in epic, such as the steps taken to arm oneself or to prepare a ship for sea. ==The work of Parry and successors== Oral-formulaic theory was originally developed, principally by Milman Parry in the 1920s, to explain how the [[Homeric epics]] could have been passed down through many generations purely through word of mouth, and why formulas appeared in it in the way that they did. His work was influential (see [[Homeric_scholarship#Oral_Theory]] and [[Homeric Question]]). The ''locus classicus'' for oral-formulaic poetry, however, was established by the work of Parry and his student Albert Lord on the Serbian oral epic poetry of what was at the time part of [[Yugoslavia]], where oral-formulaic composition could be observed and recorded ethnographically. Formulaic variation is apparent, for example, in the lines :''a besjedi od Orasca Tale'' ("But spoke of Orashatz Tale") :''a besjedi Mujagin Halile'' ("But spoke Mujo's Halil"). Lord, and more prominently [[Francis Peabody Magoun]], also applied the theory to [[Old_English_poetry#Old English poetry|Old English poetry]] (principally ''[[Beowulf]]''), where formulaic variation such as the following
