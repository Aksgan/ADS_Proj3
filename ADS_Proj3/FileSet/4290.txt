down in the meat world as immortal colonists on the surfaces of the Matrioshka brains thus constructed (regularly making backup copies of the contents of their brains so they can be reconstructed if they are killed in an accident), while others will upload themselves into the virtual reality based on these Matrioshka brains, keeping their bodies in [[Cryonics|cryonic storage]]. Eventually, the entire Galaxy, then the [[Local group]], then the [[Virgo Supercluster]], then the [[Pisces-Cetus Supercluster Complex]] and ultimately the entire [[Universe]] will be turned into a gigantic megacomputer.<ref name=Kurzweil/> {{see also|Ray Kurzweil predictions}} ==See also== * [[Human enhancement]] * [[Hysterical strength]] * [[Metahuman]] * [[Mutant (fictional)]] * [[Parahuman]] * [[Posthuman]] * ''[[The Real Superhumans]]'' * [[Superhero]] * [[Superhuman]] * [[Superhuman strength]] * [[Superintelligence]] * [[Supersoldier]] * [[Supervillain]] * [[Übermensch]] ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Human evolution]] [[Category:Science fiction themes]]</text> </page> <page> <id>36177</id> <title>Super robot chogokin</title> <text>{{nihongo|'''Super Robot Chogokin'''|スーパーロボット超合金|Sūpā Robotto Chōgōkin}}, is Bandai's new line-up diverse from the popular Soul of Chogokin franchise. Despite under the Soul of Chogokin family, the major difference is the size, only scaling around 140mm (14 cm). Aside from the size, the other main selling point for the line-up is the flexible articulation of the robots, and added weapons set(s) (sold separately) to revoke some of the effects, memorable moves, and attacks seen in each of the robots respective series. The line-up is going to be mainly focused on Super Robot series as well as [[Super Sentai]] series as well. Just like the Soul of Chogokin the robots are in die-cast and plastic. Extra accessories such as bases and laboratory (such as Mazinger Z's lab) are also in the works. Super Robot Chogokin is also targeted to a mature demographic, but the prices are a lot cheaper compared to the Soul of Chogokin line-up. ==Line-Up== {| border="1" cellpadding="2" class="wikitable sortable" !|Number !|Figure !|Series !|Release Date |- |01 || Mazinger Z || [[Mazinger Z]] || 2010.08.06 |- |02 || Great Mazinger || [[Great Mazinger]] || 2010.08.19 |- |03 || PTX-003 Alteisen || [[Super Robot Wars Original Generation]] || 2010.10.21 |- |04 || Brave Reideen || [[Brave Reideen]] || 2010.12.18 |- |05 || God Reideen || [[Reideen the Superior]] || 2010.12.18 |- |06 || Shinkenoh || [[Samurai Sentai Shinkenger]] || 2011.02.XX |- |07 || Gear Fighter Dendoh || [[Gear Fighter Dendoh]] || 2011.03.XX |- |08 || Knight Fighter Orge || [[Gear Fighter Dendoh]] || 2011.03.XX |- |09 || PTX-007-03c Weiß Ritter || [[Super Robot Wars Original Generation]] || 2011.05.XX |- |10 || Choujuuoh Kiba || [[Gear Fighter Dendoh]] || 20XX.XX |- |11 || Cybaster || [[Super Robot Wars Original Generation]] || 20XX.XX |- |12 || DGG-XAM1 Dygenguar || [[Super Robot Wars Original Generation]] || 20XX.XX |- |13 || DGG-XAM2 Außenseiter || [[Super Robot Wars Original Generation]] || 20XX.XX |- |14 || Battle Fever Robo || [[Battle Fever J]] || 20XX.XX |- |15 || Sun Vulcan Robo || [[Taiyou Sentai Sun Vulcan]] || 20XX.XX |- |16 || GaoGaiGar || [[The King of Braves GaoGaiGar]] || 20XX.XX |- |17 || HyoRyu || [[The King of Braves GaoGaiGar]] || 20XX.XX |- |18 || EnRyu || [[The King of Braves GaoGaiGar]] || 20XX.XX |- |19 || Volfogg || [[The King of Braves GaoGaiGar]] || 20XX.XX |- |20 || Big Volfogg || [[The King of Braves GaoGaiGar]] || 20XX.XX |- |21 || Real Personal Trooper Type 1 R-1 || [[Super Robot Wars Original Generation]] || 20XX.XX |- |22 || Real Personal Trooper Type 2 R-2 || [[Super Robot Wars Original Generation]] || 20XX.XX |- |23 || Real Personal Trooper Type 3 R-3 || [[Super Robot Wars Original Generation]] || 20XX.XX |} ===Accessories=== Weapons and accessories to revoke some of the moves and attacks seen in the series {| border="1" cellpadding="2" class="wikitable sortable" !|Figure !|Description !|Release Date |- |Mazinger Z Weapon Set || Includes Jet Scrander, Rocket Punch Effects, Enhance Rocket Punch, etc.) || 2010.08.06 |- |Mazinger Z Weapon Set 2 || || 2011.XX.XX |} ===Tamashii Japanese Web Store Exclusive=== {| border="1" cellpadding="2" class="wikitable sortable" !|Figure !|Description !|Release Date |- | Mazinkaiser SKL (Starter Pack) || Includes DVD of the OVA episode 1 of the series || 2010.12 |} ==See also== * [[Soul of Chogokin]] * [[Super Imaginative Chogokin]] * [[Chogokin]] * [[Godaikin]] ==External links== *[http://tamashii.jp/item/itemlist.php?pref=1300 Official Super Robot Chogokin website] (Japanese) [[Category:Action figures]] [[Category:Bandai brands]] [[Category:Mecha]] [[Category:Japanese Die-Cast]] [[Category:Toy robots]]</text> </page> <page> <id>36183</id> <title>Supercomputer Education Research Centre</title> <text>{{Notability|date=February 2010}} '''Supercomputer Education Research Centre'''<br /> The Computer Centre, established in 1970 as a central computing facility, became Supercomputer Education and Research Centre (SERC) in 1990 to provide state-of-the-art computing facility to the faculty and students of the Institute. The Centre is conceived of as a functionally distributed supercomputing environment, housing leading-edge computing systems, with sophisticated software packages, and connected by a powerful high-speed fibre-optic network. The computing facilities are connected to the campus LAN, WLAN and also to the Internet. The Centre was created to commemorate the Platinum Jubilee of the Institute, in the year 1984.<br /> Ever since its inception, SERC has stimulated a rapid growth of computer-based research, development, and training at the Institute. The powerful campus wide network has created an enhanced awareness for network computing and information processing. The Centre has been acting as a referral agency for several governmental and non-governmental organizations in their pursuit for setting up computing centres to suit their user needs<br /> '''Research:''' SERC is engaged in research programs in areas relating to supercomputer development and application. The active research areas are Bioinformatics, Computational Electromagnetics and Acoustics, Computer Aided VLSI Design, Computer Architecture, Compiler Optimizations, Database Systems, Graphics and Visualization, Grid Computing, Information and Network Security, Multimedia Systems, High Performance Computing, Numerical Algorithms, Operations Research, and System on Chip and Embedded Processor Architectures. The Centre is also involved in several sponsored research projects in collaboration with many government and private agencies. The clientele include different departments of the Government of India (Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Human Resources Development, Department of Electronics, Defense Research and Development Organization, Department of Biotechnology), Public and Private sector undertakings (Aeronautical
