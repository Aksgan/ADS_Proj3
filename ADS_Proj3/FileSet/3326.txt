Besides points about making open access mandatory, to which the NIH complied in 2008, it argues to extend self-archiving to the full spectrum of major US-funded research. In addition, the FRPAA would no longer stipulate that the self-archiving must be [http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/11000/ central]; the deposit can now be in the author's own institutional repository (IR). The new U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]]'s Public Access Policy took effect in April 2008 and states that "all articles arising from NIH funds must be submitted to PubMed Central upon acceptance for publication".<ref>[http://publicaccess.nih.gov/ Public Access Homepage]</ref> It stipulates self-archiving in [[PubMed Central]] rather than in the author's own [[institutional repository]], which some consider a strength and others a weakness. The [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research]] (CIHR) Policy on Access to Research Outputs<ref>http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/32005.html</ref> provides a number of options to researchers, including publication in open access journals, or making their manuscripts available in an online repository such as [[PubMed Central Canada]]. In April 2006, the [[European Commission]]<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/old-address-ec.htm Study on the Economic and Technical Evolution of the Scientific Publication Markets in Europe]</ref> recommended: «EC Recommendation A1 : "Research funding agencies... should [e]stablish a European policy mandating published articles arising from EC-funded research to be available after a given time period in open access archives...».

This is intended to permit individual users to use an eprint request "[http://www.eprints.org/news/features/request_button.php email eprint]" button found on some archives to send a semi-automatic email message to the author requesting an individual eprint during the embargo period: This is not open access, but in the view of at least some advocates it provides for some needs during any embargo, and might help hasten the demise of embargoes altogether, while facilitating the adoption of self-archiving mandates by funders and universities. A growing number of universities are providing institutional repositories in which their researchers can deposit their published articles. Eighty-six individual universities and eighteen faculties and departments have already adapted self-archiving mandates (including Harvard, MIT, Stanford, U. College London, U. Edinburgh) and ten further individual multi-university mandates (in Europe and Brazil) have been proposed.

One of the arguments for public access to the scholarly literature is that most of the research is paid for by taxpayers through [[government grant]]s, who therefore have a right to access the results of what they have funded. This is one of the primary reasons for the creation of advocacy groups such as The Alliance for Taxpayer Access in the US.<ref>[http://www.taxpayeraccess.org/ ATA | The Alliance for Taxpayer Access]</ref> Examples of people who might wish to read scholarly literature include individuals with medical conditions (or family members of such individuals) and serious hobbyists or 'amateur' scholars who may be interested in specialized scientific literature (e.g. [[Amateur astronomy|amateur astronomers]]). Additionally, professionals in many fields may be interested in continuing education in the research literature of their field, and many businesses and academic institutions cannot afford to purchase articles from or subscriptions to much of the research literature that is published under a toll access model. Even those who do not read scholarly articles benefit indirectly from open access<ref>[http://eprints.rclis.org/4940/1/OAbasics.pdf Open Access: Basics and Benefits]</ref>. For example, patients benefit when their doctor and other [[health care]] professionals have access to the latest research. As argued by open access advocates, open access speeds research progress, productivity, and knowledge translation <ref>Eysenbach, Gunther. [http://www.jmir.org/2006/2/e8/ The Open Access Advantage]. J Med Internet Res 2006;8(2):e8.</ref>. Every researcher in the world can read an article, not just those whose library can afford to subscribe to the particular journal in which it appears. Faster discoveries benefit everyone. High school and [[junior college]] students can gain the information literacy skills critical for the knowledge age. Critics of the various open access initiatives{{Who|date=December 2009}} point out that there is little evidence that a significant amount of scientific literature is currently unavailable to those who would benefit from it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} While no library has subscriptions to every journal that might be of benefit, virtually all published research can be acquired via [[interlibrary loan]].{{Citation needed|date=December
