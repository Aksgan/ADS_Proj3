Scholars are paid by research funders and/or their universities to do research; the published article is the report of the work they have done, rather than an item for commercial gain. The more the article is used, cited, applied and built upon, the better for research as well as for the researcher's career.<ref name="uk">[http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/28-guid.html Maximising the Return on the UK's Public Investment in Research - Open Access Archivangelism]</ref><ref>http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/v11p354y1988.pdf</ref> Similarly, the more ''quickly'' it is accessible, the better<ref name="uk"/>; open access can reduce publication delays, an obstacle which led many research fields to traditions of widespread preprint access.<ref>[http://arxiv.org/pdf/0906.5418v1 Gentil-Beccot, Anne; Salvatore Mele, Travis Brooks (2009) Citing and Reading Behaviours in High-Energy Physics: How a Community Stopped Worrying about Journals and Learned to Love Repositories]</ref> Some professional organizations have encouraged use of OA: In 2001, the [[International Mathematical Union]] communicated to its members that "Open access to the mathematical literature is an important goal" and encouraging them to "[make] available electronically as much of our own work as feasible" to "[enlarge] the reservoir of freely available primary mathematical material, particularly helping scientists working without adequate library access."<ref name="imu">{{cite web | url = http://cr.yp.to/bib/imu-call.html | title = Call to All Mathematicians | author = Committee on Electronic Information and Communication (CEIC) of the [[International Mathematical Union]] | date = 15 May 2001 }}</ref> Authors who wish to make their work openly accessible have two options. One option is to publish in an OA journal ("Gold OA"). An open access journal may or may not charge a processing fee; open access publishing does not necessarily mean that the author has to pay. Traditionally, many [[academic journal]]s levied page charges, long before open access became a possibility. When OA journals do charge processing fees, it is the author's employer or research funder who typically pays the fee, not the individual author, and many journals will waive the fee in cases of financial hardship, or for authors in less-developed countries. The other option is author [[self-archiving]] ("Green OA"). To find out if a publisher or journal has given a green light to author self-archiving, the author can check the Publisher Copyright Policies and Self-Archiving list<ref>[http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo.php SHERPA/RoMEO - Publisher copyright policies & self-archiving]</ref> on the [[SHERPA (organisation)|SHERPA]] RoMEO web site. To find out by journal, the author can check the EPrints Romeo site,<ref>[http://romeo.eprints.org/ Journal Policies - Self-Archiving Policy By Journal]</ref> which is derived from the SHERPA/RoMEO dataset. There is a self-archiving FAQ.<ref>[http://www.eprints.org/self-faq Self-Archiving FAQ]</ref> Extensive details and links can also be found in the Open Access Archivangelism blog<ref>[http://openaccess.eprints.org/ Open Access Archivangelism]</ref> and the Eprints Open Access site.<ref>[http://www.eprints.org/openaccess/ Open Access]</ref> While open access is currently focused on scholarly [[scientific literature|research articles]], any content creator who wishes to can share work openly, and decide how to make their content available. [[Creative Commons]] provides a number of licenses with which authors may easily indicate which uses are allowed. <!--opinion While universities, libraries, and funding agencies all have their own reasons to advocate open access, authors are instrumental in making it happen (see [[Peter Suber]]'s ''The Primacy of Authors in Achieving Open Access''<ref>[http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/accessdebate/24.html]</ref>). Authors decide whether to submit their work to open access journals, whether to deposit it in open access repositories, and whether to transfer copyright. --> ==Users== For the most part, the direct users of research articles are other researchers. Open access helps researchers as readers by opening up access to articles that their libraries do not subscribe to. One of the great beneficiaries of open access may be users in [[developing countries]],where currently some [[universities]] find it difficult to pay for subscriptions required to access the most recent journals.<ref>[http://0-vnweb.hwwilsonweb.com.library.simmons.edu/hww/jumpstart.jhtml?recid=0bc05f7a67b1790e0df0e5347ba8f6b217a5d78d6c41bbca1ac2a6710867c32481c865e2d86e1932&fmt=H Sivaraj, S., et. al., Resource Sharing among Engineering College Libraries in Tamil Nadu in a Networking System.

An OA article can be read by anyone – a [[professional]] in the field, a [[researcher]] in another field, a [[journalist]], a [[politician]] or [[civil servant]], or an interested [[hobbyist]]. Indeed, a 2008 study revealed that [[mental health professional]]s are roughly twice as likely to read a relevant article if it is freely available.<ref>[http://decisionsciences.columbia.edu/papers/hardisty-haaga-2008-preprint.pdf Diffusion of Treatment Research: Does Open Access Matter?]</ref> The [[Directory of Open Access Journals]] lists a number of [[peer-review]]ed open access journals for browsing and searching. [[Open J-Gate]] <ref>[http://www.openjgate.com World's biggest Open Access English Language Journals Portal - OPEN J-Gate]</ref> is another index of articles published in [[English language]] OA journals, peer reviewed and otherwise, which launched in 2006. Open access articles can also often be found with a [[web search]], using any general [[search engine]] or those specialized for the scholarly/scientific literature, such as [[OAIster]] and [[Google Scholar]]. Results may include [[preprints]] that have not yet been peer reviewed, or [[gray literature]] that will remain unreviewed. ==Research funders and universities== [[Research funding]] agencies and universities want to ensure that the research they fund and support in various ways has the greatest possible research impact. Research funders are beginning to expect open access to the research they support. Forty-two of them (including all seven UK Research Councils<ref>[http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/research/outputs/ Access to Research Outputs]</ref>) have already adopted Green OA [[self-archiving]] mandates, and four more (including two in the US) have proposed to adopt mandates.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.eprints.org/openaccess/policysignup/ Roarmap]</ref> Canada's Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council,<ref>[http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/ SSHRC/CRSH - Social Sciences and
