are complex. For large fonts or fonts with non-standard glyphs, the special encodings ''Identity-H'' (for horizontal writing) and ''Identity-V'' (for vertical) are used. With such fonts it is necessary to provide a ''ToUnicode'' table if semantic information about the characters is to be preserved. ==== Transparency ==== The original imaging model of PDF was, like PostScript's, ''opaque'': each object drawn on the page completely replaced anything previously marked in the same location. In PDF 1.4 the imaging model was extended to allow transparency. When transparency is used, new objects interact with previously marked objects to produce blending effects. The addition of transparency to PDF was done by means of new extensions that were designed to be ignored in products written to the PDF 1.3 and earlier specifications. As a result, files that use a small amount of transparency might view acceptably in older viewers, but files making extensive use of transparency could view completely wrongly in an older viewer without warning. The transparency extensions are based on the key concepts of ''transparency groups'', ''blending modes'', ''shape'', and ''alpha''. The model is closely aligned with the features of [[Adobe Illustrator]] version 9. The blend modes were based on those used by [[Adobe Photoshop]] at the time. When the PDF 1.4 specification was published the formulas for calculating blend modes were kept secret by Adobe. They have since been published.<ref>[http://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdfs/blend_modes.pdf PDF Blend Modes Addendum]</ref> The concept of a transparency group in PDF specification is independent of existing notions of "group" or "layer" in applications such as Adobe Illustrator. Those groupings reflect logical relationships among objects that are meaningful when editing those objects, but they are not part of the imaging model. === Interactive elements === {{Expand section|date=May 2008}} PDF files may contain interactive elements such as annotations and form fields. '''Interactive Forms''' is a mechanism to add forms to the PDF file format. PDF currently supports two different methods for integrating data and PDF forms. Both formats today coexist in PDF specification:<ref name="acroforms-appligent">{{citation |url=http://www.appligent.com/files/faq-whatisthedifferencebetweenacroformaxfa/Acroforms%2BWhitePaper.pdf |title=A Quick Introduction to Acrobat Forms Technology |date=2006-05-14 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref><ref name="iso32000">{{citation |url=http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf |title=Document Management – Portable Document Format – Part 1: PDF 1.7, First Edition |author=Adobe Systems Incorporated |date=2008-07-01 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://gnupdf.org/Forms_Data_Format |title=Gnu PDF - PDF Knowledge - Forms Data Format |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://livedocs.adobe.com/coldfusion/8/htmldocs/help.html?content=formsPDF_02.html |title=About PDF forms |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://forums.adobe.com/thread/301733 |title=Convert XFA Form to AcroForm? |year=2008 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref> * '''AcroForms''' (also known as '''Acrobat forms'''), introduced in the PDF 1.2 format specification and included in all later PDF specifications. * '''[[XML Forms Architecture|Adobe XML Forms Architecture]] (XFA)''' forms, introduced in the PDF 1.5 format specification.

Alongside the standard PDF action types, interactive forms (AcroForms) support submitting, resetting, and importing data. The "submit" action transmits the names and values of selected interactive form fields to a specified uniform resource locator (URL). Interactive form field names and values may be submitted in any of the following formats, (depending on the settings of the action’s ExportFormat, SubmitPDF, and XFDF flags):<ref name="iso32000" /> * HTML Form format (HTML 4.01 Specification since PDF 1.5; HTML 2.0 since 1.2) * Forms Data Format (FDF) * XML Forms Data Format (XFDF) (external XML Forms Data Format Specification, Version 2.0; supported since PDF 1.5; it replaced the "XML" form submission format defined in PDF 1.4.) * PDF (the entire document can be submitted rather than individual fields and values). (defined in PDF 1.4) AcroForms can keep form field values in external stand-alone files containing key:value pairs. The external files may use Forms Data Format (FDF) and XML Forms Data Format (XFDF) files.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/325/325874.html |title=Using Acrobat forms and form data on the web |author=Adobe Systems Incorporated |date=2007-10-15 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref><ref name="xfdf">{{citation |url=http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/xml/xfdf_2.0.pdf |format=PDF |title=XML Forms Data Format Specification, version 2 |date=2007-09 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref><ref name="fdf-exchange">{{citation |url=http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/fdf_data_exchange.pdf |format=PDF |title=FDF Data Exchange Specification |date=2007-02-08 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref> The usage rights (UR) signatures define rights for import form data files in FDF, XFDF and text ([[comma-separated values|CSV]]/[[delimiter-separated values|TSV]]) formats, and export form data files in FDF and XFDF formats.<ref name="iso32000" /> =====Forms Data Format (FDF)===== {{Infobox file format | name = Forms Data Format (FDF) | icon = | logo = | screenshot = | caption = | extension = .fdf | mime = application/vnd.fdf<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/ |title=IANA Application Media Types - vnd.fdf |accessdate=2010-02-22}}</ref> | type code = 'FDF ' | uniform type = | magic = | owner = [[Adobe Systems]] | released = {{Start date|1996}}<!-- {{Start date|YYYY|mm|dd|df=yes}} --> (PDF 1.2) | latest release version = | latest release date = <!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|mm|dd|df=yes}} --> | genre = | container for = | contained by = | extended from = PDF | extended to = XFDF | standard = ISO/IEC 32000-1:2008 | free = | url = }} The Forms Data Format (FDF) is based on PDF, it uses the same syntax and has essentially the same file structure, but is much simpler than PDF, since the body of an FDF document consists of only one required object. Forms Data Format is defined in the PDF format specification (since PDF 1.2). The Forms Data Format can be used when submitting form data to a server, receiving the response, and incorporating into the interactive form. It can also be used to export form data to stand-alone files that can be imported back into the corresponding PDF interactive form. Beginning in PDF 1.3, FDF can be used to define a container for annotations that are separate from the PDF document to which they apply. FDF is typically used to encapsulate information such as X.509 certificates, requests for certificates, directory settings, timestamp server settings, and embedded PDF files for network transmission.<ref name="fdf-exchange" />
