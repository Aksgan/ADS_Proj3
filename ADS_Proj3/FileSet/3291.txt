which want people to shop more online for them, should consume extensive amounts of time and money to define, design, develop, test, implement, and maintain the website.<ref name="louisfalk" /> Also if a company wants their website to be popular among online shoppers it should leave the user with a positive impression about the organization, so consumers can get an impression that the company cares about them.<ref name="louisfalk" /> The organization that wants to be accepted in online shopping needs to remember, that it is easier to lose a customer then to gain one.<ref name="louisfalk" /> Lots of researchers state that even when a site was "top-rated", it would go nowhere if the organization failed to live up to common etiquette, such as returning e-mails in a timely fashion, notifying customers of problems, being honest, and being good stewards of the customers' data.<ref name="louisfalk" /> Organizations that want to keep their customers or gain new ones should try to get rid of all mistakes and be more appealing to be more desirable for online shoppers. And this is why many designers of webshops consider research outcomes concerning consumer expectations. Research conducted by Elliot and Fowell (2000) revealed satisfactory and unsatisfactory customer experiences.<ref>Steve Elliot and Sue Fowell, "Expectations versus reality: a snapshot of consumer experiences with Internet retailing", International Journal of Information Management 20 (2000): 323–336</ref> ===User interface=== It is important to take the country and customers into account. For example, in Japan privacy is very important and emotional involvement is more important on a pension's site than on a shopping site.<ref name="stephenking" /> Next to that, there is a difference in experience: experienced users focus more on the variables that directly influence the task, while novice users are focusing more on understanding the information.<ref>Ram L. Kumar et al., "User interface features influencing overall ease of use and personalization", Information & Management 41 (2004): 289–302</ref> There are several techniques for the inspection of the [[usability]]. The ones used in the research of Chen & Macredie (2005) are Heuristic evaluation, cognitive walk through and the user testing. Every technique has its own (dis-)advantages and it is therefore important to check per situation which technique is appropriate.<ref name="sherry">Sherry Y. Chen en Robert D. Macredie, "The assessment of usability of electronic shopping: A heuristic evaluation", International Journal of Information Management 25 (2005), 516–532</ref> When the customers went to the online shop, a couple of factors determine whether they will return to the site. The most important factors are the ease of use and the presence of user-friendly features.<ref name="sherry" /> ===The System Itself=== The Shopping Cart system works like the name suggests. Firstly, the customer must choose the product desired from the source. Once this step is done, an option to ''add the product to the cart'' will be given, this step will assure that the item you desire will be bought. Once the customer has finished browsing for other potential purchases and has decided that the product he chose previously is the one that he wants to buy, the user must then follow the steps provided by the website in order to fulfill the transaction (normally requires an active account and/or registration method). Lastly, the order will then be sent to the desired address at a predicted date, which may alter depending on the speed of the process. ==Market share== E-commerce B2C product sales totaled $146.4 billion in the United States in 2006, representing about 6% of retail product sales in the country. The $18.3 billion worth of clothes sold online represented about 10% of the domestic market.<ref name="cnnmoney">{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/05/14/news/economy/online_retailing/|title=Total online sales expected to grow 19% to $174.5B in 2007|accessdate=2008-12-24 | work=CNN | date=2007-05-14}}</ref> For developing countries and low-income households in developed countries, adoption of e-commerce in place of or in addition to conventional methods is limited by a lack of affordable Internet access. ==Advantages== ===Convenience=== Online stores are usually available 24 hours a day, and many consumers have Internet access both at work and at home. Other establishments such as internet cafes and schools provide access as well. A visit to a conventional retail store requires travel and must take place during business hours. In the event of a problem with the item – it is not what the consumer ordered, or it is not what they expected – consumers are concerned with the ease with which they can return an item for the correct one or for a refund. Consumers may need to contact the retailer, visit the post office and pay return shipping, and then wait for a replacement or refund. Some online companies have more generous return policies to compensate for the traditional advantage of physical stores. For example, the online shoe retailer [[Zappos.com]] includes labels for free return shipping, and does not charge a restocking fee, even for returns which are not the result of merchant error. (Note: In the United Kingdom, online shops are prohibited from charging a restocking fee if the consumer cancels their order in accordance with the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Act 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/business_leaflets/general/oft698.pdf|title=A guide for businesses on distance selling|accessdate=2008-12-24}}</ref>) ===Information and reviews=== Online stores must describe products for sale with text, photos, and multimedia files, whereas in a physical retail store, the actual product and the manufacturer's packaging will be available for direct inspection (which might involve a test drive, fitting, or other experimentation). Some online stores provide or link to supplemental product information, such as instructions, safety procedures, demonstrations, or manufacturer specifications. Some provide background information, advice, or how-to guides designed to help consumers decide which product to buy. Some stores even allow customers to comment or rate their items. There are also dedicated [[review site]]s that host user reviews for different products. In a conventional retail store, clerks are generally available to answer questions. Some online stores have real-time chat features, but most rely on e-mail or phone calls to handle customer questions. ===Price and selection=== One advantage of shopping online is being able to quickly seek out deals for items or
