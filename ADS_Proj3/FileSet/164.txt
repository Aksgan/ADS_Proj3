Singapore, and Brazil. Gupta and his colleagues also developed the first microcomputer-based image database management system. ===Education=== Amar Gupta, created the first course on outsourcing of professional services, with [[Lester Thurow]], and taught it at [[MIT]] in 2004.<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/outsourcing/ "Course description"], [[MIT]] ''URL retrieved on March 6, 2007.''</ref> The aim of the course neither to praise the benefits nor discuss the horror stories of outsourcing. The course discussed both the reasons outsourcing in more common in the business place and bring in CEO’s and economic leaders to discuss their experiences with this movement<ref>[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/475952.cms "India the big topic in B-schools abroad"], [[The Economic Times]] ''URL retrieved on March 4, 2007.''</ref> This pioneer course has been replicated at several other leading universities in the U.S. and abroad. Gupta launched the first academic program that leads to two graduate degrees and a certificate in entrepreneurship. This involves a management degree from the [[University of Arizona]]’s [[Eller College of Management]], and a second graduate degree in optics science, engineering, agriculture, or medicine. ===Outsourcing=== The concept of the [24-Hour Knowledge Factory] was developed by Amar Gupta. This concept allows for multiple professionals in different geographical locations to work together to perform a single task or project. Research is being conducted to utilize this model in a variety of industries. In 2007, Gupta was awarded an IBM faculty award for this vision. In early 1980, Amar Gupta proposed to Citibank to do software development work in India. This idea turned into Citibank overseas Software Limited, the pioneer example of a large multinational bank doing such work in India. ==References== {{Reflist|2}} ==External links== *[http://entrepreneurship.eller.arizona.edu/faculty/agupta.aspx Link To Dr. Amar Gupta's page at the University of Arizona] *[http://mitsloan.mit.edu/newsroom/2004-guptathurow.php Link To press release by MIT Sloan School of Management] *[http://web.mit.edu/profit/20030217LokVani.pdf Link To press release for handwriting recognition softawre used for check processing ] *[http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT5633954&id=4zwbAAAAEBAJ&dq=amar+gupta Link to patent information on character recognition] *[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&d=PALL&RefSrch=yes&Query=PN%2F5633954 Patent Office:System and method for character recognition with normalization] {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME = Gupta, Amar | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH = | PLACE OF BIRTH = | DATE OF DEATH = | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Gupta, Amar}} [[Category:Computer systems researchers]] [[Category:Indian computer scientists]] [[Category:Indian immigrants to the United States]] [[Category:MIT Sloan School of Management alumni]] [[Category:University of Arizona faculty]] [[Category:People from Gujarat]] [[Category:Outsourcing]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur alumni]]</text> </page> <page> <id>1628</id> <title>Amazon Associates Web Service</title> <text>'''Amazon Associates Web Service''' ('''A2S'''), formerly '''Amazon E-Commerce Service''' ('''ECS''') is a [[web service]] and [[application programming interface]] (API) accessible via either the [[SOAP]] or [[Representational State Transfer|REST]] [[Protocol (computing)|protocols]]. It is part of the [[Amazon Web Services]] (AWS). The A2S API allows clients to search or browse [[Amazon.com]]'s product catalog; to retrieve detailed product information, reviews, and images; and to interface with customer shopping carts. Amazon.com developed A2S toward three classifications of users: * '''[[Amazon Affiliates|Associates]]''': third-party site owners wishing to build more effective sponsored [[Affiliate marketing|affiliate]] links to Amazon products, thus increasing their referral fees * '''Vendors''': sellers on the [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] platform looking to manage inventory and receive batch product data feeds * '''Developers''': third-party developers building [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]-driven functionality into their applications ==References== *Paul Bausch (2003).

Each round consists of two parts: a written section and a programming section. Written topics tested include "what does this program do?", [[digital electronics]], [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], [[computer numbering formats|computer numbering systems]], [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive function]]s, [[data structures]] (primarily dealing with [[binary search tree]]s, [[stack (data structure)|stacks]], and [[Queue (data structure)|queues]]), [[Lisp programming language|lisp programming]], [[regular expressions]] and [[Finite state machine|Finite State Automata]], bit string flicking, [[graph theory]], [[assembly language|assembly programming]] and [[prefix notation|prefix]]/[[postfix notation|postfix]]/[[infix notation|infix]] notation. ==Divisions== There are four divisions in ACSL: Classroom, Junior, Intermediate, and Senior. Junior is recommended for middle school students (no students above the ninth grade may compete in it). Intermediate and Senior divisions are for secondary school students, Intermediate being easier and Senior being more difficult. At the "All-Star" (final) competition, the Junior teams consist of 5 members each while the Senior and Intermediate teams can consist of 3 or 5 members. Each team competes against other same-sized teams in its division. ==Preliminary Competition== The preliminary competition, in which individual students compete to get their school team qualified for the All-Star competition, consists of four rounds. These rounds consist of a programming and a written part. In the programming part, students have 72 hours to complete a program in any [[computer language]] to perform a given task. In the written part, students have a total of 30 minutes to answer 5 questions based on given topics. Students then receive a score of up to 10 points (5 for written and 5 for programming). For the Classroom division, students receive 45 minutes to solve 10 written problems. ==All-Star Competition== The All-Star Competition is held at a different location every year. Teams are given 3 hours to earn up to 60 (40 for Junior Division) points by successfully completing various programs. Individuals are then given 1 hour (45 minutes for Junior Division) to take a 12 (8 for Junior Division) question multiple choice test based on the subjects of the written questions in the preliminary rounds. The scores of the programming and the team's individual scores are added together to determine the winners. Prizes are given to teams with the highest scores and individuals based on their performance on the multiple choice test. ==External links== *[http://www.acsl.org ACSL web site including past winners] *[http://www.scribd.com/doc/15606670/American-Computer-Science-League-ACSL-Rules-and-Handbook Handbook and Category Descriptions] [[Category:Computer science competitions]] [[ro:American Computer Science League]]</text> </page> <page>
