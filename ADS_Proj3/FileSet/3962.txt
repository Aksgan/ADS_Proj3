performance of approximately half the speed of optimised C on some benchmarks.<ref>http://research.sun.com/jtech/pubs/97-pep.ps</ref> This was achieved by [[just-in-time compilation]] techniques which were pioneered and improved in Self research to make a high level language perform this well. ===Garbage collection=== The [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collector]] for Self uses [[Garbage collection (computer science)#Generational GC|generational garbage collection]] which segregates objects by age. By using the memory management system to record page writes a write-barrier can be maintained. This technique gives excellent performance, although after running for some time a full garbage collection can occur, taking considerable time. ===Optimizations=== The run time system selectively flattens call structures. This gives modest speedups in itself, but allows extensive caching of type information and multiple versions of code for different caller types. This removes the need to do many method lookups and permits conditional branch statements and hard-coded calls to be inserted- often giving C-like performance with no loss of generality at the language level, but on a fully garbage collected system.<ref>http://www.sunlabs.com/research/self/papers/chambers-thesis/thesis.ps.Z</ref> ==See also== * [[Cecil (programming language)]] * [[Smalltalk]] programming language * [[Io (programming language)]] * [[NewtonScript]] programming language * [[JavaScript]] programming language * [[Lisaac]] programming language * [[Lua (programming language)]] ==References== {{reflist}} ==Further reading== * [http://selflanguage.org/documentation/published/index.html Published papers on Self] *{{cite doi|10.1.1.30.1652}} ==External links== * [http://selflanguage.org/ Self Home Page] * [http://research.sun.com/self/ Former Self Home Page at Sun Microsystems] * [http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~urs/oocsb/self/papers/papers.html Alternate source of papers on Self from UCSB (mirror for the Sun papers page)] * [http://www.cetus-links.org/oo_self.html Self resources at Cetus Links] * [http://www.merlintec.com/lsi/ Merlin Project] * [http://gliebe.de/self/index.html Self ported to Linux (without many optimizations)] * [http://selfguru.sourceforge.net/ Automated Refactoring application on sourceforge.net, written for and in Self] * [http://www.self-support.com/ Gordon's Page on Self] * [http://community.schemewiki.org/?prometheus Prometheus object system on the Community Scheme Wiki] * [http://www.smalltalk.org.br/movies/ Video demonstrating self] * [http://www.ag-nbi.de/research/dself/ dSelf: distributed extension to the delegation and language SELF] [[Category:Dynamically typed programming languages]] [[Category:Object-oriented programming languages]] [[Category:Prototype-based programming languages]] [[de:Self (Programmiersprache)]] [[es:Self]] [[fa:سلف (زبان برنامه‌نویسی)]] [[fr:Self (langage)]] [[ja:Self]] [[nl:Self (programmeertaal)]] [[pt:Self (linguagem de programação)]] [[ru:Self]] [[zh:Self]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33769</id> <title>Self service software</title> <text>'''Self service software''' is a subset within the [[knowledge management]] software category and which contains a range of software that specializes in the way information, process rules and logic are collected, framed within an organized taxonomy, and accessed through decision support interviews. Self-service software allows people to secure answers to their inquiries and/or needs through an automated interview fashion instead of traditional search approaches. == Self-service software functionality == Self-service software allows authors (typically subject-matter experts) to readily automate the deployment of, the timeliness of, and compliance around a variety of processes with which they are involved in communicating without having to physically address the questions, needs, and solicitations of end-users who are inquiring about the particular process being automated. Self-service software primarily addresses [[closed-loop]] inquiries whereby the author emulates a variety of known (finite) questions and related (known) responses on hand or required steps that must be addressed to derive and deliver a final answer or directive. Often the author using such software codifies such known processes and steps then generates (publishes) end-user facing applications which can encompass a variety of code bases and platforms. Self-service software is sometimes referred to decision support software and even expert systems. It is typically categorized as a subtopic within the [[knowledge management software]] category. Self service software allows individuals and companies alike to tailor and address customer support, technical support and employee support inquiries and needs in an on-demand fashion where the person with a question (need) can interface with the author's generated application via a computer, a handheld device, a kiosk, register, or other machine type to secure their answers as if they were directly interacting (talking to) the author. ==References== * Bontis, N., Dragonetti, N., Jacobsen, K. and G.
