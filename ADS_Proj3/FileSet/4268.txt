surfaces on initial meshes with arbitrary topology. * [[√3 subdivision scheme]] - This scheme has been developed by Kobbelt (2000) and offers several interesting features: it handles arbitrary triangular meshes, it is [[Parametric continuity|C<sup>2</sup>]] continuous everywhere except at extraordinary vertices where it is [[Parametric continuity|C<sup>1</sup>]] continuous and it offers a natural adaptive refinement when required. It exhibits at least two specificities: it is a ''Dual'' scheme for triangle meshes and it has a slower refinement rate than primal ones. ===Interpolating schemes=== After subdivision, the control points of the original mesh and the new generated control points are interpolated on the limit surface. The earliest work was the [[butterfly scheme]] by Dyn, Levin and Gregory (1990), who extended the four-point interpolatory subdivision scheme for curves to a subdivision scheme for surface. Zorin, Schröder and Swelden (1996) noticed that the butterfly scheme cannot generate smooth surfaces for irregular triangle meshes and thus modified this scheme. Kobbelt (1996) further generalized the four-point interpolatory subdivision scheme for curves to the tensor product subdivision scheme for surfaces. * [[Butterfly subdivision surfaces|Butterfly]], Triangles - named after the scheme's shape * [[Midedge]], Quads * [[Kobbelt]], Quads - a variational subdivision method that tries to overcome uniform subdivision drawbacks ==Editing a subdivision surface== Subdivision surfaces can be naturally edited at different levels of subdivision. Starting with basic shapes you can use binary operators to create the correct topology. Then edit the coarse mesh to create the basic shape, then edit the offsets for the next subdivision step, then repeat this at finer and finer levels. You can always see how your edit effect the limit surface via GPU evaluation of the surface. A surface designer may also start with a scanned in object or one created from a NURBS surface. The same basic optimization algorithms are used to create a coarse base mesh with the correct topology and then add details at each level so that the object may be edited at different levels. These types of surfaces may be difficult to work with because the base mesh does not have control points in the locations that a human designer would place them. With a scanned object this surface is easier to work with than a raw triangle mesh, but a NURBS object probably had well laid out control points which behave less intuitively after the conversion than before. ==Key developments== * 1978: Subdivision surfaces were discovered simultaneously by [[Edwin Catmull]] and [[Jim Clark]] (see [[Catmull–Clark subdivision surface]]). In the same year, Daniel Doo and Malcom Sabin published a paper building on this work (see [[Doo-Sabin subdivision surfaces]].) * 1995: [[Ulrich Reif]] solved subdivision surface behaviour near extraordinary vertices <ref name=Reif>Ulrich Reif. 1995.

When spoken, sometimes the acronym "SME" is spelled out ("S-M-E") and other times voiced as a word ("smee").{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The term ''domain expert'' is frequently used in [[expert systems]] software development, and there the term always refers to the domain other than the software domain. A domain expert is a person with special knowledge or skills in a particular area of endeavor. An [[accountant]] is an expert in the domain of [[accountancy]], for example. The development of [[accounting software]] requires knowledge in two different domains, namely accounting and software. Some of the development workers may be experts in one domain and not the other. ==Function== In general, the term is used when developing materials (a book, an examination, a manual, etc.) about a topic, and expertise on the topic is needed by the personnel developing the material. For example, [[Test (student assessment)|tests]] are often created by a team of [[psychometrics|psychometricians]] and a team of subject matter experts. The psychometricians understand how to engineer a test while the subject matter experts understand the actual content of the exam. Books, manuals, and technical documentation are developed by [[Technical writer]]s and [[instructional designer]]s in conjunctions with SMEs. Technical communicators interview SMEs to extract information and convert it into a form suitable for the audience. SMEs are often required to sign off on the documents or training developed, checking it for accuracy. SMEs are also necessary for the development of training materials.<ref>[http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/hrd/sme.html Subject matter experts and training]</ref> ===Software=== In [[software engineering]] environments, the term is used to describe professionals with expertise in the field of application but without technical project knowledge. The term "SME" also has a broader definition in engineering and [[high tech]] as one who has the greatest expertise in a technical
