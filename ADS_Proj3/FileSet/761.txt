This is the reason that all the practical implementations of content-based image retrieval must complete computation of all images from the database, and is the main disadvantage of these implementations. Another approach to representative color image content is two-dimensional color histogram. A two-dimensional color histogram considers the relation between the pixel pair colors (not only the lighting component).<ref>Effectiveness estimation of image retrieval by 2D color histogram; Bashkov, E.A.; Kostyukova, N.S.; Jornal of Automation and Information Sciences, 2006 (6) Page(s): 84-89</ref> A two-dimensional color histogram is a two-dimensional array. The size of each dimension is the number of colors that were used in the phase of color quantization. These arrays are treated as matrices, each element of which stores a normalized count of pixel pairs, with each color corresponding to the index of an element in each pixel neighborhood. For comparison of two-dimensional color histograms it is suggested calculating their correlation, because constructed as described above, is a random vector (in other words, a multi-dimensional random value). While creating a set of final images, the images should be arranged in decreasing order of the correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient may also be used for color histogram comparison. Retrieval results with correlation coefficient are better than with other metrics.<ref>Content-Based Image Retrieval Using Color Histogram Correlation; Bashkov, E.A.; Shozda, N.S.; Graphicon proceedings, 2002 Page(s): 458-461 [http://www.graphicon.ru/2002/pdf/Bashkov_Zhozda_Re.pdf]</ref> ==Intensity histogram of continuous data== The idea of an intensity histogram can be generalized to continuous data, say audio signals represented by real functions or images represented by functions with two-dimensional [[Function domain|domain]].

For visually acceptable results, it is necessary (and almost sufficient) to provide three [[sample (signal)|sample]]s (''color channels'') for each pixel, which are interpreted as coordinates in some color space. The [[RGB]] color space is commonly used in computer displays, but other spaces such as [[YCbCr]], [[HSV color space|HSV]], and are often used in other contexts. ==Color image representation== A color image is usually stored in memory as a [[raster graphics|raster map]], a two-dimensional array of small integer triplets; or (rarely) as three separate raster maps, one for each channel. |[[File:RGBLayers.svg|right|thumb|250px| Separate R, G, and B image layers]] Eight bits per sample (24 bits per pixel) seem to be adequate for most uses, but faint [[banding artifact]]s may still be visible in some smoothly varying images, especially those which have been subject to [[digital image processing|processing]]. Particularly demanding applications may use 10 bits per sample or more. On the other hand, some widely used [[image file format]]s and [[graphics card]]s may use only 8 bits ''per pixel'', i.e. only 256 different colors, or 2&ndash;3 bits per channel. Converting continuous-tone images like photographs to such formats requires [[dithering]] and yields rather grainy and fuzzy results. Graphics cards that support 16 bits per pixel provide 65536 distinct colors, or 5&ndash;6 bits per channel. This resolution seems to be satisfactory for non-professional uses, even without dithering. {{DEFAULTSORT:Color Image}} [[Category:Computer graphics]] [[Category:Display technology]] [[Category:Image processing]]</text> </page> <page> <id>6897</id> <title>Color mixing</title> <text>[[Image:Prisme.jpg|thumb|right|White light split by a [[prism (optics)|prism]]. The additive primary colors are clearly visible.]] There are two types of '''color mixing''': ''Additive'' and ''Subtractive''. In both cases there are three [[primary colors]], three [[secondary colors]] (colors made from 2 of the three primary colors in equal amounts), and one tertiary color made from all three primary colors. [[Image:Additive color mixing simulated.png|thumb|left|A simulated example of additive color mixing]] ==Additive Mixing== Additive mixing of colors generally involves mixing colors of light. In additive mixing of colors there are three primary colors: [[red]], [[green]], and [[blue]]. In the absence of color or, when no colors are showing, the result is black. If all three primary colors are showing, the result is white. When red and green combine, the result is yellow. When red and blue combine, the result is magenta. Additive mixing is used in television and computer [[Visual display unit|monitor]]s to produce a wide range of colors using only three primary colors. [[Image:SubtractiveColorMixing.png|thumb|right|A simulated example of subtractive color mixing]] ==Subtractive Mixing== Subtractive mixing is done by selectively removing certain colors, for instance with [[filter (optics)|optical filters]]. The three primary colors in subtractive mixing are [[yellow]], [[magenta]], and [[cyan]]. In subtractive mixing of color, the absence of color is white and the presence of all three primary colors is black. In subtractive mixing of colors, the secondary colors are the same as the primary colors from
