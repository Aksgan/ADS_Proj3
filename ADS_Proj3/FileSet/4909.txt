is a program that has the ability to emulate a [[mouse (computing)|mouse]] and/or [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] using a controller or [[joystick]]. This is primarily used for playing games with poor or no controller support, but Xpadder can be used in a web browser, media player, or almost any other application. Xpadder supports the use of up to 16 controllers simultaneously and if a controller supports it, Xpadder can assign a button to make the controller [[Haptic technology|rumble/vibrate]]. == Features == *Keyboard and mouse emulation. *Profile management. *Support for any controller recognized by [[Microsoft Windows]] *Support rumble on capable controllers. *Sets for using keys as a switch and emulating more keys than a controller physically has. == Limitations == Xpadder does not work on some online multiplayer games which make use of Anti-Hacking software. Games using [[GameGuard]], such as [[MapleStory]], sometimes block Xpadder. Servers running [[PunkBuster]], however, do not have this problem, allowing Xpadder to be used with PunkBuster-enabled games. == Development Status == *Versions of the program after 5.3 are available as payware and are officially supported on the website, while 5.3 and all previous versions are freeware. ==External links== *{{official|http://xpadder.com/}} *[http://cid-fc27c1bc742b93af.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/Xpadder/Xpadder%20for%20Newbies-%20The%20Manual Xpadder for Newbies- The Manual] Unofficial Manual - very useful for those uncertain about how to correctly set up xpadder.

It is used to discover patterns of evolutionary conservation in [[sequence alignment|sequence alignments]]. The program can be used to estimate parameters for such models from "training" alignment data, or to apply the parameterized model so as to annotate new alignments. The program allows specification of a variety of [[Models of DNA evolution|models of DNA sequence evolution]] which may be arbitrarily organized using [[Formal grammar|formal grammars]]. As an example of how '''XRATE''' is used, consider a protein-coding [[gene]] consisting of [[exons]] interspersed with [[introns]]. The exons contain triplets of nucleotides ([[codons]]) that are translated by [[ribosomes]] according to the [[genetic code]], and consequently are under [[selection pressure]] (since any mutation may affect the translated [[amino acid sequence]]). In contrast, the introns are under fewer selective constraints and tend to evolve faster. These varying pressures show up clearly in [[multiple sequence alignment|multiple alignments]]. The sequential layout of introns and exons can be described using [[Formal grammar|grammar theory]] (from linguistics) and each of their distinct evolutionary signatures modeled as a [[continuous-time Markov process]]. '''XRATE''' allows the user to specify such models in a configuration file and estimate their parameters (evolutionary rates, length distributions of exons and introns, etc.) directly from alignment data, using the [[Expectation-maximization algorithm]]. '''XRATE''' can be downloaded as part of the [http://biowiki.org/DART DART software package]. It accepts input files in [[Stockholm format]]. == References == * Holmes I, Rubin GM.
