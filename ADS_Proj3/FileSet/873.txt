Ethernet uses physical wiring to connect devices. Frequently deployed devices include [[Ethernet hub|hubs]], [[network switch]]es, [[network bridge]]s and/or [[router]]s. [[Wireless LAN]] technology is designed to connect devices without wiring. These devices use [[radio wave]]s or [[Infrared|infrared signals]] as a transmission medium. [[Ethernet over coax#ITU-T_G.hn ITU-T G.hn|Ethernet over coax]] technology uses existing home wiring (coaxial cable, phone lines and power lines) to create a high-speed (up to 1 Gigabit/s) local area network. == Wired technologies == [[Twisted pair]] - This is the most widely used medium for telecommunication. Twisted-pair wires are ordinary telephone wires which consist of two insulated copper wires twisted into pairs and are used for both voice and data transmission. The use of two wires twisted together helps to reduce crosstalk and electromagnetic induction. The transmission speed range from 2 million [[bits per second]] to 100 million bits per second. [[Coaxial cable]] – These cables are widely used for cable television systems, office buildings, and other worksites for local area networks. The cables consist of copper or aluminum wire wrapped with insulating layer typically of a flexible material with a high dielectric constant, all of which are surrounded by a conductive layer. The layers of insulation help minimize interference and distortion. Transmission speed range from 200 million to more than 500 million bits per second. [[Fiber optics]] – These cables consist of one or more thin filaments of glass fiber wrapped in a protective layer. It transmits light which can travel over long distance and higher bandwidths. Fiber-optic cables are not affected by electromagnetic radiation. Transmission speed could go up to as high as trillions of [[bits per second]]. The speed of [[fiber optic]]s is hundreds of times faster than coaxial cables and thousands of times faster than twisted-pair wire.<ref>{{cite book |title= Networking: a beginner's guide |last= Hallberg |first= Bruce A.|year= 2005 |publisher= McGraw-Hill Professional |isbn= 0072262125 |page= |pages=49–52 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=RzeAWg6XZaQC&printsec=frontcover |accessdate=}}</ref> == Wireless technologies == Terrestrial microwave – Terrestrial microwaves use Earth-based transmitter and receiver. The equipment look similar to satellite dishes. Terrestrial microwaves use low-gigahertz range, which limits all communications to line-of-sight. Path between relay stations spaced approx. 30 miles apart. Microwave antennas are usually placed on top of buildings, towers, hills, and mountain peaks. [[Communications satellite]]s – The satellites use microwave radio as their telecommunications medium which are not deflected by the Earth's atmosphere. The satellites are stationed in space, typically 22,000 miles above the equator. These Earth-orbiting systems are capable of receiving and relaying voice, data, and TV signals. [[Personal Communications Service|Cellular and PCS Systems]] – Use several radio communications technologies. The systems are divided to different geographic area. Each area has low-power transmitter or radio relay antenna device to relay calls from one area to the next area. [[Wireless LAN]]s – Wireless local area network use a high-frequency radio technology similar to digital cellular and a low-frequency radio technology. Wireless LANS use spread spectrum technology to enable communication between multiple devices in a limited area. Example of open-standard wireless radio-wave technology is [[IEEE 802.11b]]. [[Bluetooth]] – A short range wireless technology. Operate at approx. 1Mbps with range from 10 to 100 meters. Bluetooth is an open wireless protocol for data exchange over short distances. The wireless Web – The wireless web refers to the use of the World Wide Web through equipments like [[cellular phone]]s, [[pager]]s, [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]], and other portable communication devices. The wireless web service offers anytime/anywhere connection. == Scale == Networks are often classified as [[Local Area Network|LAN]], [[Wide Area Network|WAN]], [[Metropolitan Area Network|MAN]], [[Personal Area Network|PAN]], [[Virtual Private Network|VPN]], [[Campus Area Network|CAN]], [[Storage Area Network|SAN]], etc. depending on their scale, scope and purpose. Usage, trust levels and access rights often differ between these types of network - for example, LANs tend to be designed for internal use by an organization's internal systems and employees in individual physical locations (such as a building), while WANs may connect physically separate parts of an organization to each other and may include connections to third parties. == Functional relationship (network architecture) == Computer networks may be classified according to the functional relationships which exist among the elements of the network, e.g., Active Networking, Client-server and Peer-to-peer (workgroup) architecture. == Network topology == [[Image:NetworkTopologies.png|thumb|right|350px|Network Topologies examples]] Computer networks may be classified according to the [[network topology]] upon which the network is based, such as bus network, star network, ring network, mesh network, star-bus network, tree or hierarchical topology network. Network topology signifies the way in which devices in the network see their logical relations to one another. The use of the term "logical" here is significant. That is, network topology is independent of the "physical" layout of the network. Even if networked computers are physically placed in a linear arrangement, if they are connected via a hub, the network has a Star topology, rather than a bus topology. In this regard the visual and operational
