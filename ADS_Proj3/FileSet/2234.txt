structure before chronological order) can be available. {{anchor|OP}}A thread is defined by a title, an additional description that may summarize the intended discussion, and an opening or original post (common abbreviation 'OP', which can also mean ''original poster'') which opens whatever dialogue or makes whatever announcement the poster wished. A thread can contain any number of posts, including multiple posts from the same members, even if they are one after the other. A thread is contained in a forum, and may have an associated date which is taken as the date of the last post (options to order threads by other criteria are generally available). When a member posts in a thread it will jump to the top since it is the latest updated thread. Similarly, other threads will jump in front of it when they receive posts. When a member posts in a thread for no reason but to have it go to the top, it is referred to as a ''bump'' or ''bumping''. Threads which are important but rarely receive posts are ''sticky''ed (or, in some software, 'pinned'). A ''sticky thread'' will always appear in front of normal threads, often in its own section. A thread's popularity is measured on forums in reply (total posts minus one – the opening post) counts. Some forums also track page views. Threads meeting a set number of posts or a set number of views may receive a designation such as "hot thread" and be displayed with a different icon compared to others threads. This icon may stand out more to emphasize the thread. {|align=left |[[Image:PhpBB3 topic.png|thumb|left|280px|Thread (viewing as moderator)]] |[[Image:PhpBB forum.png|thumb|left|280px|Forum (viewing as moderator)]] |[[Image:TreeExample480px.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Forum (Fully Threaded display format)]] |} <br style="clear: both;"/> ==Discussion== {{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}} Forums prefer a premise of open and free discussion and often adopt [[de facto standard]]s. Most common topics on forums include questions, comparisons, polls of opinion as well as debates. It is not uncommon for nonsense or unsocial behavior to sprout as people lose temper, especially if the topic is controversial. Poor understanding of differences in values of the participants is a common problem on forums. Because replies to a topic are often worded aimed at someone's point of view, discussion will usually go slightly off into several directions as people question each others' validity, sources and so on. Circular discussion and ambiguity in replies can extend for several tens of posts of a thread eventually ending when [[Ad nauseam|everyone gives up]] or attention spans waver and a more interesting subject takes over. It is not uncommon for debate to end in [[ad hominem]] attacks. ===Flame wars=== {{Main|Flaming (Internet)}} When a thread—or in some cases an entire forum—becomes unstable the result is usually uncontrolled spam in the form of one-line complaints, [[image macro]]s or abuse of the report system. When the discussion becomes heated and sides do nothing more than complain and not accept each other's differences in point of view, the discussion degenerates into what is called a ''flame war''. To ''flame'' someone means to go off-topic and attack the person rather than their opinion. Likely candidates for flame wars are usually religion and socio-political topics, or topics that discuss pre-existing rivalries outside the forum (e.g.: rivalry between games, console systems, car manufacturers, nationalities, etc.) When a topic that has degenerated into a flame war is considered akin to that of the forum (be it a section or the entire board), spam and flames have a chance of spreading outside the topic and causing trouble, usually in the form of vandalism. Some forums (commonly game forums) have suffered from forum-wide flame wars almost immediately after their conception, because of a pre-existing ''[[flame war element]]'' in the [[online community]]. Many forums have created devoted areas strictly for discussion of potential flame war topics that are moderated like normal. === Liabilities of forum owners and moderators === Several [[lawsuits]] have been brought against forums and moderators claiming [[libel]] and damage. A recent case is the [[scubaboard lawsuit]] where a business in the Maldives filed a suit against scubaboard for libel and defamation in January 2010. For the most part, though, forum owners and moderators in the United States are protected by [[Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act]], which states that "[n]o provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider." ==Common features== By default to be an Internet forum, the web application needs an ability to submit threads and replies. Forum software may sometimes allow categories or subforums. The chronological older-to-newer view is generally associated with forums (the newer to older being associated more akin to [[blogs]]). ===Tripcodes and capcodes=== {{Main|Tripcode}} In a tripcode system, a secret password is added to the user's name following a separator character (often a [[number sign]]). This password, or tripcode, is [[Hash function|hash]]ed into a special key, or trip, distinguishable from the name by HTML styles. Tripcodes cannot be faked but on some types of forum software they are insecure and can be guessed. On other types, they can be brute forced with software designed to search for tripcodes such as Tripcode Explorer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tripcode Explorer - Hurr Network|accessdate=2010-08-22|url=http://www.hurrchan.net/wiki/Tripcodes|publisher=Hurrchan/Courtney Wade}}</ref> Moderators and administrators will frequently assign themselves capcodes, or tripcodes where the guessable trip is replaced with a special notice (such as "# Administrator"), or cap. ===Private message=== {{Main|Personal message}} A ''private message'', or PM for short, is a message sent in private from a member to one or more other members. The ability to send so-called [[carbon copy|carbon copies]] is sometimes available. When sending a ''carbon copy'' (cc), the users to whom the message is sent directly will not be aware of the recipients of the carbon copy or even if one was sent in the first place.<ref group="example">Presuming someone is sending a [[#Private message|private message]] and has the ability to send [[carbon copy|carbon copies]]: If someone fills the ''recipient'' field with "John" and "Tom", and the ''carbon copy'' field with "Gordon".
