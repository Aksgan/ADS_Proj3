what I began to feel was his determination to hoodwink me that I found it necessary to place on my desk a notice saying: REMEMBER, IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING, HE WAS A GREAT MAN."<ref>Ziegler, Philip ''Mountbatten'' New York, 1985. pp 17</ref></blockquote> While serving as First Sea Lord, his primary concerns dealt with devising plans on how the Royal Navy would keep shipping lanes open if Britain was hit with a nuclear attack. Today, this seems of minor importance but at the time few people comprehended the potential limitless destruction nuclear weapons possess and the ongoing dangers posed by the fallout. Military commanders did not understand the physics involved in a nuclear explosion. This becomes evident when Mountbatten had to be reassured that the fission reactions from the Bikini Atoll tests would not spread through the oceans and blow up the planet.<ref>Zuckerman, 363.</ref> As Mountbatten became more familiar with this new form of weaponry, he increasingly grew opposed to their use in combat yet at the same time he realised the potential nuclear energy had, especially with regards to submarines. Mountbatten clearly expresses his feelings towards the use of nuclear weapons in combat in his article "A Military Commander Surveys The Nuclear Arms Race," which was published shortly after his death in ''International Security'' in the winter of 1979–80.<ref>Mountbatten, Louis, "A Military Commander Surveys The Nuclear Arms Race," ''International Security,'' Vol. 4 No. 3 Winter 1979-1980, MIT Press. pp. 3-5</ref> After leaving the Admiralty, Lord Mountbatten took the position of Chief of the Defence Staff. He served in this post for six years during which he was able to consolidate the three service departments of the military branch into a single Ministry of Defence. Mountbatten was [[Governor]] of the [[Isle of Wight]] from 1969 until 1974 and then appointed the first [[Lord Lieutenant]] of the [[Isle of Wight]] in 1974. He kept the position until his death. From 1967 until 1978, Mountbatten became president of the [[United World Colleges]] Organisation, then represented by a single college: that of [[Atlantic College]] in South Wales. Mountbatten supported the United World Colleges and encouraged heads of state, politicians and personalities throughout the world to share his interest. Under Mountbatten's presidency and personal involvement, the United World College of South East Asia was established in [[Singapore]] in 1971, followed by the United World College of the Pacific (now known as the Lester B Pearson United World College of the Pacific) in [[Victoria, Canada]] in 1974. In 1978, Lord Mountbatten of Burma passed the Presidency to his great-nephew, HRH The Prince of Wales.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.uwc.org/about_history.html | title = History | publisher = UWC}}</ref> ===Alleged plots against Harold Wilson=== [[Peter Wright]], in his book [[Spycatcher]], claimed that in 1967 Mountbatten attended a private meeting with press baron and [[MI5]] agent [[Cecil Harmsworth King|Cecil King]], and the Government's chief scientific adviser, [[Solly Zuckerman]]. King and Peter Wright were members of a group of thirty MI5 officers who wanted to stage a coup against the then crisis-stricken Labour Government of [[Harold Wilson]], and King allegedly used the meeting to urge Mountbatten to become the leader of a Government of national salvation. Solly Zuckerman pointed out that it was treason, and the idea came to nothing because of Mountbatten's reluctance to act.<ref>{{Cite web| title = House of Commons, Hansard: 10 January 1996 Column 287. |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199596/cmhansrd/vo950110/debtext/60110-43.htm}}</ref> In 2006 the BBC documentary ''The Plot Against Harold Wilson'' alleged that there had been another plot involving Mountbatten to oust Wilson during his second term in office (1974–76). The period was characterised by high inflation, increasing unemployment and widespread industrial unrest. The alleged plot centred around [[right-wing]] former military figures who were supposedly building private armies to counter the perceived threat from [[trade union]]s and the [[Soviet Union]]. They believed that the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], which is partly funded by [[affiliated trade union]]s, was unable and unwilling to counter these developments and that Wilson was either a Soviet agent or at the very least a [[Communist]] sympathiser, claims Wilson strongly denied. The documentary alleged that a coup plot was planned to overthrow Wilson and replace him with Mountbatten using the private armies and sympathisers in the military and MI5. The documentary stated that Mountbatten and other members of the British Royal Family supported the plot and were involved in its planning.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4789060.stm | work=BBC News | title=Wilson 'plot': The secret tapes | date=9 March 2006 | accessdate=11 May 2010}}</ref> Wilson had long believed that there had been an MI5 sponsored plan to overthrow him. This suspicion was heightened in 1974 when the Army occupied Heathrow Airport on the grounds that it was training for a possible IRA attack there. [[Marcia Falkender, Baroness Falkender|Marcia Falkender]], a senior aide and intimate friend of Wilson, asserted that the Prime Minister hadn't been informed of the exercise and that it was ordered as a practice-run for a military takeover. Wilson was also convinced that a small group of right-wing MI5 officers were conducting a smear campaign against him. Such allegations had previously been attributed to Wilson's paranoia, not least because in 1988, Peter Wright admitted that the allegations in his book were "unreliable" and greatly exaggerated.<ref>{{Cite news| title = Spies like us, The Guardian: 11 September 2001 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2001/sep/11/freedomofinformation.media | location=London | date=11 September 2001 | accessdate=11 May 2010 | first=Stella | last=Rimington}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| title = Top 50 Political Scandals, The Spectator |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/3756033/part_5/top-50-political-scandals-part-one.thtml}}</ref> However the BBC documentary interviewed several new witnesses who gave new credibility to the allegations. Crucially, the first official history of MI5, ''[[The Defence of the Realm]]'' published in 2009, tacitly confirmed that there was a plot against Wilson and that MI5 did have a file on him. Yet it also made clear that the plot was in no way official and that any activity centred around a small group of discontented officers. This much had already been confirmed by former [[cabinet secretary]] [[John Hunt, Baron Hunt of Tanworth|Lord Hunt]], who concluded in a secret inquiry conducted in 1996 that, "There is
