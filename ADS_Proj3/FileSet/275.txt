construction and use of a building, ArchiMate offers a common language for describing the construction and operation of [[business processes]], organizational structures, [[information flow]]s, IT systems, and technical infrastructure. This insight helps the different [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] to design, assess, and communicate the consequences of decisions and changes within and between these business domains. An [[architecture framework]] is used to structure the concepts and relationships of the ArchiMate language. It divides the [[enterprise architecture]] in to a business, application and technology layer. In each layer, three aspects are considered: active elements that exhibit [[behavior]] (e.g. Process and Function), an internal [[structure]] and elements that define use or communicate [[information]]. One of the objectives of the ArchiMate language is to define the relationships between concepts in different architecture domains. The concepts of this language therefore hold the middle between the detailed concepts, that are used for modeling individual domains, for example, the [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] for modeling [[software]] products.<ref>Zoran Stojanović et al. (2007). ''Service-oriented Software System Engineering''. p.145-146.</ref>, and [[BPMN]] which is used for business process modeling. == History == ArchiMate is partly based on the [[IEEE 1471]] standard. It was developed in the Netherlands by a project team from the [[Telematica Instituut]] in cooperation with several [[Netherlands|Dutch]] partners from government, industry and academia. Among the partners were Ordina, [[Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen]], the Leiden Institute for Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) and the [[Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica]] (CWI). Later, tests were performed in organizations such as [[ABN AMRO]], the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration and the [[Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP|ABP]].<ref>Telematica Instituut (2006) [https://doc.telin.nl/dscgi/ds.py/Get/File-64437 Annual Report 2005]. p.7. Accessed 18 jan 2009.</ref> The development process lasted from July 2002 to December 2004, and took about 35 man years and approximately 4 million euros. The development was funded by the Dutch government (Dutch Tax and Customs Administration), and business partners, including [[ABN AMRO]] and the ABP Pension Fund.<ref name="Snair007"> [http://earchpal.wordpress.com/2008/08/03/archimate-its-time-has-come/ ArchiMate : Its Time Has Come?] Enterprise Architecture Demystified.

This layer "offers products and services to external customers, which are realized in the organization by business processes performed by business actors and roles". * The ''Application layer'' about [[software application]]s that "support the components in the business with application services". * The ''Technology layer'' deals "with the [[hardware]] and [[communication]] infrastructure to support the Application Layer. This layer offers infrastructural services needed to run applications, realized by computer and communication hardware and system software". Each layer "aims to provide a natural way to look at [[service-oriented model]]s. Each layer is self contained despite being a component of the integrated model, and caters to one or more architecture domains".<ref name="Archi"/><ref name="Snair007"/> == References == {{reflist}} == Further reading == * The Open Group (2009), [http://www.opengroup.org/bookstore/catalog/c091.htm ''ArchiMate 1.0 Specification''].

A computer-generated building is created along with landscaping and sometimes moving people and vehicles. Unlike an architectural rendering, which is a single image from a single point of view, an architectural animation is a series of hundreds or even thousands of still images. When these images are assembled and played back they produce a movie effect much like a real movie camera except all images are artificially created by computer. It is possible to add a computer-created environment around the building to enhance reality and to better convey its relationship to the surrounding area; this can all be done before the project is built giving designers and stakeholders a realistic view of the completed project. Architectural renderings are often used along with architectural animation. ==Who uses it== Commercial demand for computer-generated rendering is on the rise, but three-dimensional scale models are still popular. Typically members of the AIA (American Institute of Architects) and NAHB (National Association of Home Builders) prefer to use 3D animations and single renderings for their customers before starting on a construction project. These professionals often find their clients are unable to grasp the complexity and spacial qualities of large projects without the help of computer generated visual aids. The animations and renderings are usually supplied by small animation studios. == Future == Architectural animation is not considered to be the ambition of most small computer rendering firms because of the man hours and computer rendering time that is required to create so many single still images. Not all studios have the software to assemble and incorporate them into a moving sequence. Some smaller companies specialize in high quality single frame computer renderings. Architectural animations require a larger team of artists and animators than single renderings and a much longer time frame is required to complete an animation project. However, many architectural firms are now using architectural animation because it attracts investors and customers who may not know much about building designs. Architectural animation is considered to have a bright future ahead of it
