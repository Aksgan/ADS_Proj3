can easily extract global structure from representations in a strictly lower dimension, i.e. we infer a 3D environment from a 2D image from each eye. The inference of global structure also occurs when converting discrete data into continuous images. E.g. dot-matrix printers and televisions communicate images via arrays of discrete points. The main method used by topological data analysis is: # Replace a set of data points with a family of [[simplicial complex]]es, indexed by a proximity parameter. # Analyse these topological complexes via [[algebraic topology]] — specifically, via the new theory of '''persistent homology'''. # Encode the persistent homology of a data set in the form of a parameterized version of a [[Betti number]] which will be called a '''barcode'''. ==Point cloud data== Data is often represented as points in a [[Euclidean space|Euclidean ''n''-dimensional space]] E<sub>''n''</sub>. The global ''shape'' of the data may provide information about the phenomena that the data represent. One type of data set for which global features are certainly present is the so-called '''point cloud data''' coming from physical objects in 3D. E.g. a laser can scan an object at a set of discrete points and the cloud of such points can be used in a computer representation of the object. '''Point cloud data''' refers to any collection of points in E<sub>''n''</sub> or a (perhaps noisy) sample of points on a lower-dimensional subset. For point clouds in low-dimensional spaces there are numerous approaches for inferring features based on planar projections in the fields of [[computer graphics]] and [[statistics]]. Topological data analysis is needed when the spaces are high-dimensional or too twisted to allow planar projections. To convert a point cloud in a [[metric space]] into a global object, use the point cloud as the vertices of a [[Graph (mathematics)|graph]] whose edges are determined by proximity, then turn the graph into a [[simplicial complex]] and use algebraic topology to study it. ==Persistent homology== {{Empty section|date=July 2010}} *[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.88.7105&rep=rep1&type=pdf Persistent Homology—a Survey], <ref>[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.88.7105&rep=rep1&type=pdf Persistent Homology—a Survey], Herbert Edelsbrunner and John Harer, in Surveys on discrete and computational geometry: twenty years later : AMS-IMS-SIAM Joint Summer Research Conference, June 18-22, 2006, Snowbird, Utah, Editors Jacob E.

The term generally refers to touching the display of the device with a finger or [[hand]]. Touchscreens can also sense other passive objects, such as a [[Stylus (computing)|stylus]]. The touchscreen has two main attributes. First, it enables one to interact directly with what is displayed, rather than indirectly with a cursor controlled by a [[mouse (computing)|mouse]] or [[touchpad]]. Secondly, it lets one do so without requiring any intermediate device that would need to be held in the hand. Such displays can be attached to computers, or to networks as terminals. They also play a prominent role in the design of digital appliances such as the [[personal digital assistant]] (PDA), [[satellite navigation]] devices, [[mobile phones]], and video games. == History == [[file:CERN-Stumpe Capacitance Touchscreen.jpg|thumb|The prototype<ref>{{cite |publisher=CERN Courrier |date=31 March 2010 |title=The first capacitative touch screens at CERN |url=http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/42092 |accessdate=2010-05-25 }}</ref> x-y mutual capacitance touchscreen (left) developed at [[CERN]]<ref>{{cite |publisher=CERN |author=Bent STUMPE |date=16 March 1977 |title=A new principle for x-y touch system |url=http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/1266588/files/StumpeMar77.pdf |accessdate=2010-05-25 }}</ref><ref>{{cite |publisher=CERN |author=Bent STUMPE |date=6 February 1978 |title=Experiments to find a manufacturing process for an x-y touch screen |url=http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/1266589/files/StumpeFeb78.pdf |accessdate=2010-05-25 }}</ref> in 1977 by Bent Stumpe, a Danish electronics engineer,
