offers financial institutions abundant opportunities to engage with customers. Networks such as [[Twitter]], [[Yelp]] and [[Facebook]] are now becoming common elements of multichannel and customer loyalty strategies,{{Buzz}} and banks are beginning to use these sites proactively to spread their messages. In a recent article for [[Bank Technology News]], Shane Kite describes how Citigroup's Global Transaction Services unit monitors [[social media]] outlets to address customer issues and improve products. Furthermore, the FI uses [[Twitter]] to release "breaking news" and upcoming events, and [[YouTube]] to disseminate videos that feature executives speaking about market news.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.pntmarketingservices.com/newsfeed/article/Banks_use_Web_2_0_to_increase_customer_retention-800226524.html | title=Banks use Web 2.0 to increase customer retention | year=2010 | journal=PNT Marketing Services}}</ref> : Small businesses have become more competitive by using Web 2.0 marketing strategies to compete with larger companies. As new businesses grow and develop, new technology is used to decrease the gap between businesses and customers. [[Social networks]] have become more intuitive and user friendly to provide information that is easily reached by the end user. For example, Companies use [[Twitter]] to offer customers coupons and discounts for products and services.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2010/10/25/prwebprweb4693214.DTL | title= Small Businesses Need Innovation - New Company May Have Their Solution | year=2010 | journal=San Franciso Chronicle }}</ref> According to Google Timeline, the term Web 2.0 was discussed and indexed most frequently in 2005, 2007 and 2008. Its average use is continuously declining by 2-4% per quarter since April 2008. ==Web-based applications and desktops== [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] has prompted the development of websites that mimic desktop applications, such as [[word processor|word processing]], the [[spreadsheet]], and [[presentation program|slide-show presentation]]. In 2006 [[Google|Google, Inc.]] acquired one of the best-known sites of this broad class, [[Google Docs & Spreadsheets|Writely]].<ref> {{cite web |url=http://www.news.com/2100-1032_3-6048136.html |title=Google buys Web word-processing technology |publisher=www.news.com |accessdate=2007-12-12 |last= |first= }} </ref> [[WYSIWYG]] [[wiki]] and [[blog]]ging sites replicate many features of PC authoring applications. Several browser-based "[[operating system]]s" have emerged, including [[EyeOS]]<ref> {{cite web |url=http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/11/27/eyeos-open-source-webos-for-the-masses/ |title=Can eyeOS Succeed Where Desktop.com Failed? |publisher=www.techcrunch.com |accessdate=2007-12-12 |last= |first= }} </ref> and [[YouOS]].<ref> {{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2006/03/hey_youos.html |title=Tech Beat Hey YouOS! &ndash; BusinessWeek |publisher=www.businessweek.com |accessdate=2007-12-12 |last= |first= }} </ref> Although coined as such, many of these services function less like a traditional operating system and more as an application platform. They mimic the user experience of desktop operating-systems, offering features and applications similar to a PC environment, and are able to run within any modern browser. However, these operating systems do not directly control the hardware on the client's computer. Numerous web-based application services appeared during the [[dot-com bubble]] of 1997–2001 and then vanished, having failed to gain a critical mass of customers. In 2005, [[WebEx]] acquired one of the better-known of these, [[Intranets.com]], for $45 million.<ref> {{cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,122068-page,1/article.html |title=PC World — WebEx Snaps Up Intranets.com |publisher=www.pcworld.com |accessdate=2007-12-12 |last= |first= }} </ref> ===Internet applications=== [[Rich Internet application|Rich Internet Applications (RIAs)]] are web 2.0 applications that have many of the characteristics of desktop applications and are typically delivered via a browser. ==Distribution of Media== ===XML and RSS=== Many regard syndication of site content as a Web 2.0 feature. Syndication uses standardized protocols to permit end-users to make use of a site's data in another context (such as another website, a browser plugin, or a separate desktop application). Protocols which permit syndication include [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] (really simple syndication, also known as web syndication), [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] (as in RSS 1.1), and [[Atom (standard)|Atom]], all of them [[XML]]-based formats. Observers have started to refer to these technologies as [[web feed]]s. Specialized protocols such as [[FOAF (software)|FOAF]] and [[XHTML Friends Network|XFN]] (both for social networking) extend the functionality of sites or permit end-users to interact without centralized websites. ===Web APIs=== Web 2.0 often uses machine-based interactions such as [[Representational State Transfer|REST]] and [[SOAP]]. Servers often expose proprietary [[API]]s (Application Programming Interfaces), but standard APIs (for example, for posting to a blog or notifying a blog update) have also come into use. Most communications through APIs involve XML or [[JSON]] payloads. REST APIs, through their use of self-descriptive messages and [[HATEOAS|hypermedia as the engine of application state]], should be self describing once an entry [[URI]] is known. [[Web Services Description Language]] (WSDL) is the standard way of publishing a SOAP API and there are [[List of web service specifications|a range of web service specifications]]. [[EMML]], or Enterprise Mashup Markup Language by the [[Open Mashup Alliance]], is an XML markup language for creating enterprise mashups. ==Criticism== Critics of the term claim that "Web 2.0" does not represent a new version of the [[World Wide Web]] at all, but merely continues to use so-called "Web 1.0" technologies and concepts. First, techniques such as [[AJAX (programming)|AJAX]] do not replace underlying protocols like [[HTTP]], but add an additional layer of abstraction on top of them. Second, many of the ideas of Web 2.0 had already been featured in implementations on networked systems well before the term "Web 2.0" emerged. [[Amazon.com]], for instance, has allowed users to write reviews and consumer guides since its launch in 1995, in a form of self-publishing. Amazon also opened its API to outside developers in 2002.<ref>{{ cite web |title=Amazon Web Services API |work=O'Reilly Network |url=http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/1707?wlg=yes |author=[[Tim O'Reilly]] |date=2002-06-18 |accessdate=2006-05-27 }}</ref> Previous developments also came from research in [[Computer Supported Collaborative Learning|computer-supported collaborative learning]] and [[CSCW|computer-supported cooperative work]] and from established products like [[Lotus Notes]] and [[Lotus Domino]], all phenomena which precede Web 2.0. But perhaps the most common criticism is that the term is unclear or simply a [[buzzword]]. For example, in a podcast interview,<ref name="developerWorks Interviews: Tim Berners-Lee"> {{cite web |url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/podcast/dwi/cm-int082206txt.html |title=DeveloperWorks Interviews: Tim Berners-Lee |date=2006-07-28 |accessdate=2007-02-07 }}</ref> [[Tim Berners-Lee]] described the term "Web 2.0" as a "piece of jargon": <blockquote>"Nobody really knows what it means...If Web 2.0 for you is blogs and wikis, then that is people to people. But that was what the Web was supposed to be all along."<ref name="developerWorks Interviews: Tim Berners-Lee" /></blockquote> Other critics labeled Web 2.0 "a second bubble" (referring to the [[Dot-com bubble]] of circa 1995–2001), suggesting that too many Web 2.0 companies attempt to develop
