as objectively existing subjectivity. Intersubjectivity is also a part in the constitution of one's lifeworld, especially as "homeworld." ===Lifeworld=== {{Main|lifeworld}} The [[lifeworld]] (German: ''Lebenswelt'') is the "world" each one of us ''lives'' in. One could call it the "background" or "horizon" of all experience, and it is that on which each object stands out as itself (as different) and with the meaning it can only hold for us. The lifeworld is both personal and [[intersubjectivity|intersubjective]] (it is then called a "homeworld"), and, as such, it does not enclose each one of us in a [[solipsism|solus ipse]]. ==Husserl's ''Logische Untersuchungen'' (1900/1901)== In the first edition of the ''Logical Investigations'', still under the influence of Brentano, Husserl describes his position as "descriptive psychology." Husserl analyzes the intentional structures of mental acts and how they are directed at both real and ideal objects. The first volume of the ''Logical Investigations'', the ''Prolegomena to Pure Logic'', begins with a devastating critique of [[psychologism]], i.e., the attempt to subsume the ''a priori'' validity of the laws of logic under psychology. Husserl establishes a separate field for research in logic, philosophy, and phenomenology, independently from the empirical sciences.<ref>On the ''Logical Investigations'', see {{Citation |editor-last= Zahavi |editor-first= Dan |editor2-last=Stjernfelt |editor2-first= Frederik |title= One Hundred Years of Phenomenology (Husserl's Logical Investigations Revisited) |place= Dordrecht / Boston / London |publisher= Kluwer |year=2002 }}; and {{Citation |editor-last= Mohanty |editor-first= Jitendra Nath |title= Readings on Edmund Husserl’s Logical Investigations |place= Den Haag |publisher= Nijhoff |year=1977 }} </ref> ==Transcendental phenomenology after the ''Ideen'' (1913)== Some years after the publication of the ''Logical Investigations'', Husserl made some key elaborations which led him to the distinction between the act of consciousness (''noesis'') and the phenomena at which it is directed (the ''noemata''). * "noetic" refers to the intentional act of consciousness (believing, willing, etc.) * "noematic" refers to the object or content (noema) which appears in the noetic acts (the believed, wanted, hated, and loved ...). What we observe is not the object as it is in itself, but how and inasmuch it is given in the intentional acts. Knowledge of [[essence]]s would only be possible by "bracketing" all assumptions about the existence of an external world and the inessential (subjective) aspects of how the object is concretely given to us. This procedure Husserl called ''epoché''. Husserl in a later period concentrated more on the ideal, essential structures of consciousness. As he wanted to exclude any hypothesis on the existence of external objects, he introduced the method of phenomenological reduction to eliminate them. What was left over was the pure transcendental ego, as opposed to the concrete empirical ego. Now (transcendental) phenomenology is the study of the essential structures that are left in pure consciousness: this amounts in practice to the study of the noemata and the relations among them. The philosopher [[Theodor Adorno]] criticised Husserl's concept of phenomenological epistemology in his metacritique ''Against Epistemology'', which is anti-[[foundationalism|foundationalist]] in its stance. Transcendental phenomenologists include [[Oskar Becker]], [[Aron Gurwitsch]], and [[Alfred Schutz]]. ==Realist phenomenology== {{Main|Realist phenomenology}} After Husserl's publication of the ''Ideen'' in 1913, many phenomenologists took a critical stance towards his new theories. Especially the members of the [[Munich phenomenology|Munich group]] distanced themselves from his new transcendental phenomenology and preferred the earlier realist phenomenology of the first edition of the ''Logical Investigations''. Realist phenomenologists include [[Adolf Reinach]], [[Alexander Pfänder]], Johannes Daubert, [[Max Scheler]], [[Roman Ingarden]], [[Nicolai Hartmann]], [[Dietrich von Hildebrand]]. ==Existential phenomenology== {{Main|Existential phenomenology}} Existential phenomenology differs from transcendental phenomenology by its rejection of the [[transcendental|transcendental ego]]. Merleau-Ponty objects to the ego's transcendence of the world, which for Husserl leaves the world spread out and completely transparent before the conscious. Heidegger thinks of a conscious being as always already in the world. Transcendence is maintained in existential phenomenology to the extent that the method of phenomenology must take a presuppositionless starting point - transcending claims about the world arising from, for example, natural or scientific attitudes or theories of the [[ontology|ontological]] nature of the world. While [[Husserl]] thought of philosophy as a scientific discipline that had to be founded on a phenomenology understood as [[epistemology]], [[Heidegger]] held a radically different view. Heidegger himself states their differences this way: :''For Husserl, the phenomenological reduction is the method of leading phenomenological vision from the natural attitude of the human being whose life is involved in the world of things and persons back to the [[transcendental]] life of consciousness and its noetic-noematic experiences, in which objects are constituted as correlates of consciousness. For us, phenomenological reduction means leading phenomenological vision back from the apprehension of a being, whatever may be the character of that apprehension, to the understanding of the Being of this being (projecting upon the way it is unconcealed).''<ref name="heideproblems">{{citation |first=Martin |last=Heidegger |author-link = Martin Heidegger |title=The Basic Problems of Phenomenology |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=1975 |chapter= Introduction |chapter-url= http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/heidegge.htm }}</ref> According to Heidegger, philosophy was not at all a scientific discipline, but more fundamental than science itself. According to him science is only one way of knowing the world with no special access to truth. Furthermore, the scientific mindset itself is built on a much more "primordial" foundation of practical, everyday knowledge. Husserl was skeptical of this approach, which he regarded as quasi-mystical, and it contributed to the divergence in their thinking. Instead of taking phenomenology as ''prima philosophia'' or a foundational discipline, Heidegger took it as a metaphysical ontology: "''being is the proper and sole theme of philosophy''... this means that philosophy is not a science of beings but of being.".<ref name="heideproblems"/> Yet to confuse phenomenology and ontology is an obvious error. Phenomena are not the foundation or Ground of Being. Neither are they appearances, for as Heidegger argues in ''[[Being and Time]]'', an appearance is "that which shows itself in something else," while a phenomenon is "that which shows itself in itself." While for Husserl, in the epochè, being appeared only as a correlate of consciousness, for Heidegger being is the starting point. While for Husserl we would have to abstract from all
