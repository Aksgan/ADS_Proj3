starting with an early video digitizer called the [[Cromemco Cyclops|Cyclops]] and then moving on to the prototype Dazzler.<ref name=memory/><ref name=ten/> The Dazzler was first introduced at the [[Homebrew Computer Club]].<ref name=ten/> Like many early microcomputer projects of the era, the Dazzler was originally announced as a self-built kit in ''Popular Electronics''.<ref>Walker</ref> In order to "kick start" construction, they offered kits including a [[circuit board]] and the required parts, which the user would then assemble on their own. This led to sales of completely assembled Dazzler systems, which became the only way to purchase the product some time after. Sales were so fruitful that Melen and Garland formed Cromemco to sell the Dazzler and their other Altair add-ons, selecting a name based on Crothers Memorial Hall, their residence while attending Stanford. When [[Federico Faggin]]'s new company introduced the [[Z80]], Cromemco branched out into their own line of Z80-based S-100 compatible computers almost immediately. Over time these became the company's primary products. Combinations of their [[rackmount]] machines and the Dazzler formed the basis of [[ColorGraphics Weather Systems]] (CWS) product line into the late 1980s, and when CWS was purchased by [[Dynatech]] in 1987, Dynatech also purchased Cromemco to supply them.<ref name=cws/> Over time, Cromemco sold a number of games and basic graphics programs on [[paper tape]] and diskette, including ''[[Spacewar!]]'' in October 1976.<ref>Cromemco Inc., [http://vt100.net/mirror/harte/Cromemco/Cromemco%20Spacewar%20for%20Dazzler%20Manual.pdf "Spacewar"], 1976</ref> ==Description== The Dazzler used over 70 MOS and TTL IC's, which required two cards to hold all the chips,<ref>Manual, pg. 3</ref> "Board 1" held the analog circuits, while "Board 2" held the bus interface and digital logic. The two cards were connected together with a 16-conductor ribbon cable. Although the analog card did not talk on the bus, it would normally be plugged into the bus for power connections and physical support within the chassis. The manual also described a way to "piggyback" the two cards with a separate power cable to save a slot. Output from the analog card was [[Composite video|composite color]], and an [[RF modulator]] was available for direct connection to a color TV. The Dazzler lacked its own [[frame buffer]], accessing the host machine's [[main memory]] using a custom [[DMA]] controller that provided 1 Mbit/s throughput.<ref>Manual, pg. 4</ref> The card read data from the computer at speeds that demanded the use of [[SRAM]] memory, as opposed to lower cost [[DRAM]]s. Control signals and setup was sent and received using the S-100 bus's input/output "ports", normally mapped to 0E and 0F. 0E contained an 8-bit address pointing to the base of the frame buffer in main memory, while 0F was a bit-mapped control register with various setup information. The Dazzler supported four graphics modes in total, selected by setting or clearing bits in the control register (0F) that controlled two orthogonal selections. The first selected the size of the frame buffer, either 512 bytes or 2 kB. The other selected normal or "X4" mode, the former using 4-bit nybbles packed 2 to a byte in the frame buffer to produce a 8-color image, or the later which was a higher resolution monochrome mode using 1-bits per pixel, 8 to a byte. Selecting the mode indirectly selected the resolution. In normal mode with a 512 byte buffer there would be 512 bytes Ã— 2 pixels per byte = 1,024 pixels, arranged as a 32 by 32 pixel image. A 2 kB buffer produced a 64 by 64 pixel image, while the highest resolution used a 2 kB buffer in X4 mode to produce a 128 by 128 pixel image.<ref>Manual, pg. 6</ref> In normal mode the color was selected from a fixed 8-color palette with an additional bit selecting intensity, while in X4 mode the foreground color was selected by setting three bits in the control register to turn on red, green or blue (or combinations) while a separate bit controlled the intensity. ==See also== * [[MicroAngelo]], a higher-resolution system for S-100 computers * [[Matrox]], Matrox's first graphics product was a video card for S-100 machines, the ALT-256 ==References== ===Notes=== {{reflist}} ===Bibliography=== * Cromemco Inc., [http://maben.homeip.net/static/S100/cromemco/cards/Cromemco%20Dazzler%20Manual%201979.pdf "Dazzler Instruction Manual"], November 1978 * Terry Walker, Roger Melen, Harry Garland, Ed Hall, [http://www.altair32.com/pdf/TV%20Dazzler%20Popular%20Electronics%20Article.pdf "Build the TV DAZZLER"], ''Popular Electronics'', February 1976, pg. 31-40 ==External links== * [http://www.atariarchives.org/bcc3/showpage.php?page=90 Saga of a System] - David Ahl's story of how he got his Altair 8800/Dazzler system built, includes some sample images * [http://www.computercloset.org/CromemcoDazzler.htm Cromemco Dazzler], image of the original design and its instruction manual [[Category:1976 introductions]] [[Category:History of computing hardware]] [[Category:Video cards]] [[Category:S-100 graphics cards]]</text> </page> <page> <id>8516</id> <title>Croquet Project</title> <text>{{ infobox software | released = [[2007]] | operating_system = [[Unix-like]], [[Windows]], [[Mac OS X]] | author = [[Alan Kay]], [[Julian Lombardi]], [[Mark P.

Implemented in [[Squeak]] [[Smalltalk]], Croquet supports communication, [[collaboration]], resource sharing, and synchronous computation among multiple users. Applications created with the Croquet Software Developer's Kit (SDK) can be used to support highly scalable collaborative data visualization, virtual learning and problem solving environments, 3D [[wiki]]s, online gaming environments ([[MMORPG]]s), and privately maintained/interconnected multiuser virtual environments. Since release of the Croquet SDK in 2007, the SDK has not been under active development. All continued development of the technology has taken place under the very active [[Open Cobalt]] effort. ==Technical functionality== [[Image:Interactive 3D map of same world.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Real time, interactive, 3D map of this very same world.'''

Applications created using the Croquet SDK are automatically collaborative since application objects in Croquet share a common protocol that
