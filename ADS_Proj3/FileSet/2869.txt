<title>Memex</title> <text>{{for|the Software Company|Memex Technology Limited}} The '''memex''' (a [[portmanteau]] of "memory" and "index",<ref name="Buckland"/> like [[Rolodex]] an earlier index portmanteau common at the time) is the name given by [[Vannevar Bush]] to the theoretical proto-[[hypertext]] computer system he proposed in his 1945 ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' article ''[[As We May Think]]''. The memex is a device in which an individual compresses and stores all of their books, records, and communications which is then mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. A document can be given a simple numerical code that allows the user to access it after dialing the number combination. Documents are also able to be edited in [[Real-time operating system|real-time]]. This process makes annotation fast and simple. The memex is an enlarged intimate supplement to one's memory.<ref name="ReferenceA">Manovich, Lev. "As We May Think". The New Media Reader. The MIT Press.</ref> The memex has influenced the development of subsequential [[hypertext]] and intellect augmenting computer systems. A memex consists of a desk, where on top are slanting translucent screens on which material can be projected for convenient reading. Within the desk were mechanisms that stored information through microphotography. Most of the memex contents are purchased on microfilm ready for insertion. On the top of the memex is a transparent platen. When a longhand note, photograph, memoranda, and other things are in place, the depression of a lever causes it to be photographed onto the next blank space in a section of the memex film, dry photography being employed.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> == Details == === A proto-hypertext system === In Bush's 1945 paper, he describes a memex as an electromechanical device that an individual could use to read a large self-contained research library, and add or follow associative trails of links and notes created by that individual, or recorded by other researchers. The technology used would have been a combination of electromechanical controls and [[microfilm]] cameras and readers, all integrated into a large desk. Most of the microfilm library would have been contained within the desk, but the user could add or remove microfilm reels at will. The memex is "'a sort of mechanized private file and library'.-Bush. It uses methods such as microfilm storage, dry photography, and analog computing to give postwar scholars access to a huge, indexed repository of knowledge-any section of which can be called up with a few keystrokes." <ref name="Wardrip-Fruin 2003 p. 35">Wardrip-Fruin, Noah and Nick Montfort, ed (2003). The New Media Reader. p. 35. The MIT Press. ISBN 0-262-23227-8.</ref> The vision of the memex predates, and is credited as the inspiration for, the first practical [[hypertext]] systems of the 1960s. Bush describes the memex and other visions of ''[[As We May Think]]'' as projections of technology known in the 1930s and 1940s - in the spirit of [[Jules Verne]] or [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s 1945 proposal to orbit [[geosynchronous satellite]]s for global telecommunication. The memex proposed by Bush would create ''trails'' of links connecting sequences of microfilm frames, rather than links in the modern sense where a [[hyperlink]] connects a single word, phrase or picture within a document and a local or remote destination. ===Associative trails=== An associative trail as conceived by Bush would be a way to create a new ''linear'' sequence of microfilm frames across any arbitrary sequence of microfilm frames by creating a chained sequence of links in the way just described, along with personal comments and ''side trails''. At the time Bush saw the current ways of indexing information as limiting and instead proposed a way to store information that was analogous to the mental association of the human brain: storing information with the capability of easy access at a later time using certain cues. (in this case, a series of numbers as a code to retrieve data)<ref>The World Wide Web: the Beginning and Now http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mattkaz/history/memex3.html</ref> The closest analogy with the modern Web browser would be to create a list of bookmarks to articles relevant to a topic, and then to have some mechanism for automatically scrolling through the articles (for example, use [[Google]] to search for a keyword, obtain a list of matches, and then use "open in new tab" in your browser and visit each tab sequentially). Modern hypertext systems with word and phrase-level linking offer more sophistication in connecting relevant information, but until the rise of [[wiki]] and other [[social software]] models, modern hypertext systems have rarely imitated Bush in providing individuals with the ability to create personal trails and share them with colleagues - or publish them widely. ===Other features=== The memex would have features other than linking. The user could record new information on microfilm, by taking photos from paper or from a touch-sensitive translucent screen. A user could "... insert a comment of his own, either linking it into the main trail or joining it by a side trail to a particular item. ... Thus he builds a trail of his interest through the maze of materials available to him."<ref name=AWMT>[http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/194507/bush "As We May Think"] - The original article from the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' archives</ref> A user could also create a copy of an interesting trail (containing references and personal annotations) and "... pass it to his friend for insertion in his own memex, there to be linked into the more general trail."<ref name=AWMT/> As observers like Tim Oren have pointed out, the memex could be considered to be a microfilm-based precursor to the [[personal computer]]. The September 10, 1945, [[Life magazine]] article showed the first illustrations of what the [http://sloan.stanford.edu/MouseSite/Secondary.html memex desk] could look like, as well as illustrations of a head-mounted [[camera]], which a scientist could wear while doing experiments, and a [[typewriter]] capable of [[voice recognition]] and of reading text by [[speech synthesis]]. Considered together, these memex machines were probably the earliest practical description of what we would call today the [[Office of the future]]. "Given a memex, a scholar could create her own knowledge tools as connections within reams of information, share these tools, and use complexes of tools
