to the possibility of humans upgrading their capabilities with [[bionics]] and/or [[genetic engineering]] and, as [[cyborg]]s, becoming the dominant species in themselves. {{see|Three Laws of Robotics}} ===Technological singularity=== {{Main|Technological singularity}} Some groups, called [[Singularitarians]], who advocate what might be defined as a peaceful (non-violent, non-invasive, non-coercive) cybernetic revolt known as a 'technological singularity', argue that it is in humanity's best interests to bring about such an event, as long as it can be ensured that the event would be beneficial. They postulate that a society run by intelligent machines (or [[cyborgs]]) could potentially be vastly more efficient than a society run by normal human beings. A society led by friendly, [[altruism|altruistic]] sentiences of this type would therefore be to humanity's great benefit. To this end, there has been much recent work in what has become known as [[Friendly AI|Friendliness Theory]], which holds that, as advocate and AI researcher [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] states, "... you ought to be able to reach into 'mind-design-space' (i.e. the hypothetical realm which contains all possible intelligent minds) and pull out a mind (design an intelligent machine) such that afterwards, you're glad you made it real."<ref>{{cite video |title=The Human Importance of the Intelligence Explosion |date=2006 |url=http://www.singinst.org/media/thehumanimportanceoftheintelligenceexplosion |publisher=[[Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence]] |accessdate=2008-12-13}}</ref> ==In fiction== {{main|List of apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction#Cybernetic revolt (apocalyptic wars between humans and technology)|l1=List of post-apocalyptic cybernetic revolt fiction}} ==See also== *[[Technological singularity]] *[[Humans United Against Robots]] Self-replicating machines: *[[Clanking replicator]] *[[Grey goo]] *[[Self-replication]] *[[Self-modifying code]] *[[Computer viruses]] "Smart" machines: *[[Biological computer]] *[[Quantum computer]] *[[Robot]] *[[Artificial intelligence]] ==Notes== <references/> ==External links== *[http://www.singinst.org/ The Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence] (official institute website) *[http://www.ArmedRobots.com/ ArmedRobots.com] (tracks developments in robotics which may culminate in Cybernetic Revolt) {{DEFAULTSORT:Cybernetic Revolt}} [[Category:Science fiction themes]] [[Category:Artificial intelligence in fiction]] [[Category:Apocalyptic fiction]] [[es:Rebelión de las máquinas]]</text> </page> <page> <id>8817</id> <title>Cyborgs in fiction</title> <text>[[Cyborg]]s are a prominent staple in the [[science fiction]] genre. This article summarizes notable instances of '''cyborgs in fiction'''. ==Examples in history== In 1966, [[Kit Pedler]], a medical scientist, created the [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] for the TV program ''[[Doctor Who]]'', based on his concerns about science changing and threatening humanity. The Cybermen had replaced much of their bodies with mechanical prostheses and were now supposedly emotionless creatures driven only by logic. [[Isaac Asimov]]'s short story "[[The Bicentennial Man]]" explored cybernetic concepts. The central character is NDR, a robot who begins to modify himself with [[organic compound|organic]] components. His explorations lead to breakthroughs in human [[medicine]] ''via'' artificial [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s and prosthetics. By the end of the story, there is little physical difference between the body of the hero, now called Andrew, and humans equipped with advanced prosthetics, save for the presence of Andrew's artificial positronic brain. Asimov also explored the idea of the cyborg in relation to robots in his short story "[[Segregationist (short story)|Segregationist]]", collected in ''[[The Complete Robot]]''. The 1972 [[science fiction]] novel [[Cyborg (novel)|''Cyborg'']], by [[Martin Caidin]], told the story of a man whose damaged body parts are replaced by mechanical devices ("bionics"). This novel was adapted into a [[Television program|TV series]], ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'', in 1973, and a spin-off, ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'' in 1976. Caidin also addressed bionics in his 1968 novel, ''[[The God Machine (1968 novel)|The God Machine]]''. In 1974, [[Marvel Comics]] writer [[Rich Buckler]] introduced the cyborg [[Deathlok|Deathlok the Demolisher]], and a [[dystopian]] [[post-apocalyptic]] future, in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #25. Buckler's character dealt with rebellion and loyalty, with allusion to [[Frankenstein]]'s monster, in a twelve-issue run. Deathlok was later resurrected in ''[[Captain America]]'', followed by two others in 1990 and 1999. The 1982 film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' featured creatures called [[replicants]], bio-engineered or bio-robotic beings. The Nexus series—genetically designed by the [[Blade Runner#Tyrell Corporation|Tyrell Corporation]]—are virtually identical to an adult human, but have superior strength, agility, and variable intelligence depending on the model. Because of their physical similarity to humans a replicant must be detected by its lack of emotional responses and empathy to questions posed in a [[Voight-Kampff machine|Voight-Kampff]] test. A derogatory term for a replicant is "skin-job," a term heard again extensively in ''[[Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)|Battlestar Galactica]]''. In the opening crawl of the film, they are first said to be the next generation in robotics. The crawl also states genetics play some role in the creation of replicants. The original novel makes mention of the biological components of the androids, but also alludes to the mechanical aspects commonly found in other material relating to robots. The 1987 science fiction [[action film]] ''[[RoboCop]]'' features a cyborg protagonist. After being killed by a criminal gang, police officer Alex Murphy is transformed by a private company into a cyborg cop. The transformation is used to explore the theme of [[resurrection]] and [[Psychological identity|identity]]. There are cyborg ''[[kaiju]]'' in the [[Godzilla]] films such as [[Gigan]] and [[Mechagodzilla]]. Although frequently referred to onscreen as a cyborg, [[The Terminator]] might be more properly an [[android (robot)|android]]. While it has skin and blood (cellular organic systems), these serve mainly as a disguise and are not [[symbiotic]] with the machine components, a trait of true cyborgs. The endoskeletons beneath are fully functional robots and have been seen operating independently, especially during the future segments of the Terminator movies. The [[T-1000]] (which is said to be made completely of a liquid metal) of ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' is definitely an android. The Terminator [[Cameron (Terminator)|Cameron Phillips]] seen in the TV series ''[[Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles]]'' is of a previously unseen model, and is once again referred to on screen (including once by another Terminator) as a cyborg. [[Terminator Salvation]] introduces Marcus Wright, a death-row convict who donated his body to Cyberdyne Systems, who was later revived as a one of a kind Terminator with his original brain and heart placed into an endoskeleton which was then covered by a copy of his original organic tissue. Cyborgs have also been present in [[real-time strategy]] video games. The "[[Command & Conquer]]" video game series had cyborgs as a part of its plot - specifically Cyborgs created by the "[[Brotherhood of Nod]]" via [[Tiberium Infusion]]
