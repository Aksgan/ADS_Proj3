Capacitive sensing as a human interface device ([[Human interface device|HID]]) technology, for example to replace the [[mouse (computer)|computer mouse]], is becoming increasingly popular.<ref> {{Cite book | title = Capacitive Sensors | author = Larry K.

More and more design engineers are selecting capacitive sensors for their versatility, reliability and robustness, unique human-device interface and cost reduction over mechanical switches. Capacitive touch sensors have become a predominant feature in a large number of mobile devices and [[Digital audio player|MP3 players]]. Capacitive sensors detect anything which is conductive or having dielectric properties. While capacitive sensing applications can replace mechanical buttons with capacitive alternatives, other technologies such as [[multi-touch]] and gesture-based [[touchscreens]] are also premised on capacitive sensing.<ref> {{Cite web | last = Wilson | first = Tracy | title = HowStuffWorks "Multi-touch Systems" | url = http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/iphone2.htm | accessdate = August 9, 2009 }} </ref> ==Sensor Design== Capacitive sensors can be constructed from many different media, such as copper, [[Indium tin oxide]] (ITO) and printed ink. Copper capacitive sensors can be implemented on standard [[FR4]] PCBs as well as on flexible material. ITO allows the capacitive sensor to be up to 90% transparent (for single layer solutions). The size and spacing of the capacitive sensor are both very important to the sensor's performance. In addition to the size of the sensor, and its spacing relative to the [[ground plane]], the type of ground plane used is very important. Since the [[parasitic capacitance]] of the sensor is related to the [[Electric field|E-Field]]'s path to ground, it is important to choose a ground plane that limits the concentration of E-Field lines without a conductive object present. Designing a capacitance sensing system requires first picking the type of sensing material (FR4, Flex, ITO, etc.). One also needs to understand the environment the device will operate in, such as the full [[operating temperature]] range, what radio frequencies are present and how the user will interact with the interface. There are two types of capacitive sensing system: mutual capacitance,<ref>US Pat No 5,305,017 5,861,875</ref> where the object (finger, conductive stylus) alters the mutual coupling between row and column electrodes, which are scanned sequentially;<ref>e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4,736,191</ref> and self- or absolute capacitance where the object (such as a finger) loads the sensor or increases the parasitic capacitance to ground. In both cases, the difference of a preceding absolute position from the present absolute position yields the relative motion of the object or finger during that time. ==Circuit Design== Capacitance is typically measured indirectly, by using it to control the frequency of an oscillator, or to vary the level of coupling (or attenuation) of an AC signal. The design of a simple capacitance meter is often based on a [[relaxation oscillator]]. The capacitance to be sensed forms a portion of the oscillator's [[RC circuit]] or [[LC circuit]]. Basically the technique works by charging the unknown capacitance with a known current. (The equation of state for a capacitor is i = C dv/dt. This means that the capacitance equals the current divided by the rate of change of voltage across the capacitor.) The capacitance can be calculated by measuring the charging time required to reach the threshold voltage (of the relaxation oscillator), or equivalently, by measuring the oscillator's frequency. Both of these are proportional to the RC (or LC) [[time constant]] of the oscillator circuit. The primary source of error in capacitance measurements is stray capacitance, which if not guarded against, may fluctuate between 10 pF to 10 nF. The stray capacitance can be held relatively constant by shielding the (high impedance) capacitance signal and then connecting the shield to (a low impedance) ground reference. Also, to minimize the unwanted effects of stray capacitance, it is good practice to locate the sensing electronics as close to the sensor as possible. More accurate instruments may use a capacitance bridge configuration, similar to a [[wheatstone bridge]].<ref>http://newton.ex.ac.uk/teaching/CDHW/Sensors/#Capacitance Basic impedance measurement techniques</ref> ==Comparison with other touch screen technologies== Since capacitive screens only respond to materials which are conductive (human finger used most commonly), they can be cleaned with cloths without accidental command input. Capacitive touchscreens are more responsive than [[resistive touchscreen]]s.<ref name="ErnestDoku"> {{Cite web | last = Doku | first = Ernest | title = Resistive Vs. Capacitive Touchscreens, What's The Difference? | url = http://mobilenews.omio.com/mobile-phone-guides/resistive-vs-capacitive-touchascreens-whats-the-difference/ | accessdate = March 31, 2010 }} </ref> A standard stylus cannot be used for capacitive sensing unless it is tipped with some form of conductive material, such as anti-static conductive foam. However, [[Capacitive stylus|capacitive styli]]—different from standard [[Stylus (computing)|styli]]—can be used as well as finger input on capacitive screens. Capacitive touchscreens are more expensive to manufacture and offer a significantly lesser degree of accuracy than [[resistive touchscreen]]s.<ref name="ErnestDoku"/> They cannot be used with gloves, and can fail to sense correctly with even a small amount of water on the screen. Power supplies with high electronic [[Noise (electronics)|noise]] can reduce accuracy. ==See also== *[[Touchscreen]] *[[Resistive touchscreen]] *[[Capacitive displacement sensor]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://electronicdesign.com/Articles/Index.cfm?AD=1&ArticleID=19873 Build A Touch-Sensor Solution For Wet Environments] * [http://www.slideshare.net/daniel_smith/capsense-programmable-capacitive-touch-sensing-design-in-minutes-presentation Capacitive Touch Sensing Design] * [http://www.lionprecision.com/tech-library/technotes/cap-0020-sensor-theory.html Capacitive sensor theory] - How Capacitive Sensors Work and How to Use Them Effectively {{DEFAULTSORT:Capacitive Sensing}} [[Category:Pointing devices]] [[es:Sensor capacitivo]] [[ko:정전식 감응]]</text> </page> <page> <id>5453</id> <title>Capacitively coupled plasma</title> <text>A '''capacitively coupled plasma (CCP)''' is one of the most common types of
