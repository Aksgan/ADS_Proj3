The '''.ai''' [[filename extension]] is used by [[Adobe Illustrator]]. Early versions of the AI file format are true [[Encapsulated PostScript|EPS]] files with a restricted, compact syntax, with additional semantics represented by Illustrator-specific [[Document Structuring Conventions|DSC comments]] that conform to DSC's Open Structuring Conventions. These files are identical to their corresponding Illustrator EPS counterparts, but with the EPS procsets ([[library (computing)|procedure sets]]) omitted from the file and instead externally referenced using %%Include [[directive]]s. {{Expert-subject||paragraph (below)|talk=What is the PGF that AI is supposed to be based on?}} Recent versions of the AI file format, including the PDF-based formats and recent EPS formats, are based on a native format called [[Progressive Graphics File|PGF]] that is unrelated to both EPS and PDF. PDF compatibility is achieved not by extending the PDF format, but by embedding a complete copy of the native [[Progressive Graphics File|PGF]] data within the PDF file. The same kind of “dual path” approach is also used when recent versions of Illustrator are saving EPS-compatible files. ==Programs that support AI files== Aside from Adobe Illustrator, the following applications can edit .ai files: *[[CorelDRAW]] (another proprietary program) can natively edit this file format with some limitations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://corel.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/762365/related/1 |title=CorelDRAW - Supported file formats : Adobe Illustrator (AI) |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref><ref name="x3formats">{{cite web |url=http://corel.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/759188/~/coreldraw%E2%AE-graphics-suite-x3-supported-file-formats |title=CorelDRAW® Graphics Suite X3 Supported File Formats |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref> *[[Corel Paint Shop Pro]] (another proprietary program) can natively edit this file format. *[[Ghostscript]] (another GPL-licensed program) can convert AI postscript files into various formats, and also allows programs that use Ghostscript such as [[GIMP]] to import AI files. *[[Inkscape]] (a free, GPL-licensed program) can import the old Postscript-based Adobe Illustrator format (up to AI ver.8) and AI files based on PDF (AI 9.0 and above).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Current_PDF_Support#Current_Adobe_Illustrator_support |title=Inkscape - Current Adobe Illustrator support |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/FAQ#What_formats_can_Inkscape_import.2Fexport.3F |title=Inkscape - What formats can Inkscape import/export? |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref> *[[Skencil]] (another GPL-licensed program) also claims to have some AI support. *[[sK1 (program)|sK1]] (a free, GPL-licensed vector graphics editor) supports PostScript-based AI files up to AI ver. 9.<ref name="uniconvertor">{{cite web |url=http://sk1project.org/modules.php?name=Products&product=uniconvertor |title=sK1 - UniConvertor - universal vector graphics translator |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref> *[[UniConvertor]] (a free, GPL-licensed vector graphics translator) supports PostScript-based AI files up to AI ver. 9.<ref name="uniconvertor" /> *[[Xara Xtreme]] has support for the format that is described as "working".

After it was acquired by [[Adobe Systems]] in 1994, when the two companies merged, a [[Microsoft Windows]] version was released. Adobe discontinued production from September 1997. A key feature of Persuasion, which distinguished it from [[Microsoft PowerPoint]] at the time, was the use of an outline to represent the text content of the slides, which was immediately reflected on the slides (and vice versa). PowerPoint eventually copied this feature. == Versions history== * Aldus Persuasion 1.0. Made for Macintosh only. Created by [[Peter Polash]]. * Aldus Persuasion 2.0. Made Macintosh and IBM was available in 1991. * Aldus Persuasion 2.x * Adobe Persuasion 3.0. Had both Mac and Windows versions, and was released in 1995. It was bundled with the Persuasion Player. * Adobe Persuasion 4.0. Was released in 1996. The Mac and Windows versions shipped together, with a simultaneous end-user license for each platform. It was bundled with [[Adobe Acrobat Distiller]] 3.0,
