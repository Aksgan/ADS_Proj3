security practices in the following areas.<ref>[https://wiki.internet2.edu/confluence/display/itsg2/Information+Systems+Acquisition%2C+Development%2C+and+Maintenance+%28ISO+12%29 EDUCAUSE Dashboard ISO 12]</ref> * Security requirements for information systems * Correct processing in applications * Cryptographic controls * Security of system files * Security in development and support processes * Technical [[vulnerability management]] Information systems security begins with incorporating security into the requirements process for any new application or system enhancement. Security should be designed into the system from the beginning. Security requirements are presented to the vendor during the requirements phase of a product purchase. Formal testing should be done to determine whether the product meets the required security specifications prior to purchasing the product. Correct processing in applications is essential in order to prevent errors and to mitigate loss, unauthorized modification or misuse of information. Effective coding techniques include validating input and output data, protecting message integrity using encryption, checking for processing errors, and creating activity logs. Applied properly, cryptographic controls provide effective mechanisms for protecting the confidentiality, authenticity and integrity of information. An institution should develop policies on the use of encryption, including proper key management. Disk Encryption is one way to protect data at rest. Data in transit can be protected from alteration and unauthorized viewing using SSL certificates issued through a Certificate Authority that has implemented a Public Key Infrastructure. System files used by applications must be protected in order to ensure the integrity and stability of the application. Using source code repositories with version control, extensive testing, production back-off plans, and appropriate access to program code are some effective measures that can be used to protect an application's files. Security in development and support processes is an essential part of a comprehensive quality assurance and production control process, and would usually involve training and continuous oversight by the most experienced staff. Applications need to be monitored and patched for technical vulnerabilities. Procedures for applying patches should include evaluating the patches to determine their appropriateness, and whether or not they can be successfully removed in case of a negative [[impact (security)|impact]]. == Critique of risk management as a methodology == Risk management as a scientific methodology has been criticized as being shallow.<ref name=Vacca1/> Major programs that implies risk management applied to IT systems of large organizations as [[FISMA#Critique|FISMA]] has been criticized. The risk management methodology is based on scientific foundations of statistical decision making: indeed, by avoiding the complexity that accompanies the formal probabilistic model of risks and uncertainty, risk management looks more like a process that attempts to guess rather than formally predict the future on the basis of statistical evidence. It is highly subjective in assessing the value of assets, the likelihood of threats occurrence and the significance of the impact. Having considered this criticisms the risk management is a very important instrument in designing, implementing and operating secure information systems because it systematically classifies and drives the process of deciding how to treat risks. Its usage is foreseen by legislative rules in many countries. A better way to deal with the subject it is not emerged.<ref name=Vacca1/> == Risk managements methods == It is quite hard to list most of the methods that at least partially support the IT risk management process. Efforts in this direction were done by: * [[NIST]] Description of Automated Risk Management Packages That NIST/NCSC Risk Management Research Laboratory Has Examined, updated 1991 * [[ENISA]]<ref>[http://www.enisa.europa.eu/act/rm/cr/risk-management-inventory/rm-ra-methods ENISA, Inventory of Risk Management / Risk Assessment Methods]</ref> in 2006; a list of methods and tools is available on line with a comparison engine.<ref>[http://rm-inv.enisa.europa.eu/rm_ra_methods.html Inventory of Risk Management / Risk Assessment Methods]</ref> Among them the most widely used are:<ref name=Vacca1/> ** [[CRAMM]] Developed by British government is compliant to [[ISO/IEC 17799]], [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] (GLBA) and [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA) ** [[EBIOS]] developed by the French government it is compliant with major security standards: [[ISO/IEC 27001]], [[ISO/IEC 13335]], [[ISO/IEC 15408]], [[ISO/IEC 17799]] and [[ISO/IEC 21287]] ** [[Standard of Good Practice]] developed by [[Information Security Forum]] (ISF) ** [[Mehari]] developed by [https://www.clusif.asso.fr/ Clusif Club de la Sécurité de l'Information Français] ** Octave developed by Carnegie Mellon University, SEI ([[Software Engineering Institute]]) The Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability EvaluationSM (OCTAVE®) approach defines a risk-based strategic assessment and planning technique for security. ** [[IT Baseline Protection Catalogs|IT-Grundschutz]] (IT Baseline Protection Manual) developed by Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) (Germany); IT-Grundschutz provides a method for an organization to establish an Information Security Management System (ISMS). It comprises both generic IT security recommendations for establishing an applicable IT security process and detailed technical recommendations to achieve the necessary IT security level for a specific domain Enisa report<ref name=ENISAFULL/> classified the different methods regarding completeness, free availability, tool support; the result is that: * EBIOS, ISF methods, IT-Grundschutz cover deeply all the aspects (Risk Identification, Risk analysis, Risk evaluation, Risk assessment, Risk treatment, Risk acceptance, Risk communication), * EBIOS and IT-Grundschutz are the only ones freely available and * only EBIOS has an open source tool to support it. The [[Factor Analysis of Information Risk]] (FAIR) main document, "An Introduction to Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR)", Risk Management Insight LLC, November 2006;<ref name=FAIR>,[http://www.riskmanagementinsight.com/media/docs/FAIR_introduction.pdf "An Introduction to Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR)", Risk Management Insight LLC, November 2006];</ref> outline that most of the methods above lack of rigorous definition of risk and its factors. FAIR is not another methodology to deal with risk management, but it complements existing methodologies.<ref name=OGC081>Technical Standard Risk Taxonomy ISBN 1-931624-77-1 Document Number: C081 Published by The Open Group, January 2009.</ref> FAIR has had a good acceptance, mainly by [[The Open Group]] and [[ISACA]]. ISACA developed a methodology, called [[Risk IT]], to address various kind of IT related risks, chiefly security related risks. It is integrated with [[COBIT]], a general framework to manage IT. Risk IT has a broader concept of [[IT risk]] than other methodologies, it encompasses not just only the negative [[impact (security)|impact]] of operations and service delivery which can bring destruction or reduction of the value of the organization, but also the benefit\value enabling risk associated to missing opportunities
