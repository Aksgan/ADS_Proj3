A '''password''' is a secret [[word]] or string of [[character (computing)|characters]] that is used for [[authentication]], to prove identity or gain access to a resource (example: an [[access code]] is a type of password). The password should be kept [[secrecy|secret]] from those not allowed access. The use of passwords is known to be ancient. Sentries would challenge those wishing to enter an area or approaching it to supply a password or ''watchword.'' Sentries would only allow a person or group to pass if they knew the password. In modern times, [[user (computing)|user name]]s and passwords are commonly used by people during a [[logging (computer security)|log in]] process that [[access control|controls access]] to protected computer [[operating system]]s, [[mobile phone]]s, [[cable TV]] decoders, [[Automated Teller Machine|automated teller machines]] (ATMs), etc. A typical [[computer user]] may require passwords for many purposes: logging in to computer accounts, retrieving [[e-mail]] from servers, accessing programs, databases, networks, web sites, and even reading the morning newspaper online. Despite the name, there is no need for passwords to be actual words; indeed passwords which are not actual words may be harder to guess, a desirable property. Some passwords are formed from multiple words and may more accurately be called a [[passphrase]]. The term '''passcode''' is sometimes used when the secret information is purely numeric, such as the [[personal identification number]] (PIN) commonly used for ATM access. Passwords are generally short enough to be easily [[memory|memorized]] and typed. For the purposes of more compellingly authenticating the identity of one computing device to another, passwords have significant disadvantages (they may be stolen, spoofed, forgotten, etc.) over authentications systems relying on [[cryptographic protocol]]s, which are more difficult to circumvent. ==Easy to remember, hard to guess== The easier a password is for the owner to remember generally means it will be easier for an [[hacker (computer security)|attacker]] to guess.<ref>{{Cite news|title=If Your Password Is 123456, Just Make It HackMe |work=The New York Times |first=Ashlee |last=Vance |date=January 20, 2010 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/21/technology/21password.html }}</ref> Passwords which are difficult to remember will reduce the security of a system because (a) users might need to write down or electronically store the password, (b) users will need frequent password resets and (c) users are more likely to re-use the same password. Similarly, the more stringent requirements for password strength, e.g. "have a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters and digits" or "change it monthly", the greater the degree to which users will subvert the system.<ref>http://all.net/journal/netsec/1997-09.html Fred Cohen and Associates</ref> In ''The Memorability and Security of Passwords'',<ref>[http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/jeff.yan/jyan_ieee_pwd.pdf The Memorability and Security of Passwords]</ref> Jeff Yan et al. examine the effect of advice given to users about a good choice of password. They found that passwords based on thinking of a phrase and taking the first letter of each word are just as memorable as naively selected passwords, and just as hard to crack as randomly generated passwords. Combining two ''unrelated'' words is another good method. Having a personally designed "[[algorithm]]" for generating obscure passwords is another good method. However, asking users to remember a password consisting of a “mix of uppercase and lowercase characters” is similar to asking them to remember a sequence of bits: hard to remember, and only a little bit harder to crack (e.g. only 128 times harder to crack for 7-letter passwords, less if the user simply capitalises one of the letters). Asking users to use "both letters and digits" will often lead to easy-to-guess substitutions such as 'E' --> '3' and 'I' --> '1', substitutions which are well known to attackers. Similarly typing the password one keyboard row higher is a common trick known to attackers. ==Factors in the security of a password system== The security of a password-protected system depends on several factors. The overall system must, of course, be designed for sound security, with protection against [[computer virus]]es, [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s and the like. Physical security issues are also a concern, from deterring [[shoulder surfing (computer security)|shoulder surfing]] to more sophisticated physical threats such as video cameras and keyboard sniffers. And, of course, passwords should be chosen so that they are hard for an attacker to guess and hard for an attacker to discover using any (and all) of the available automatic attack schemes. See [[password strength]], [[computer security]], and [[computer insecurity]]. Nowadays it is a common practice for computer systems to hide passwords as they are typed. The purpose of this measure is to avoid bystanders reading the password. However, some argue that such practice may lead to mistakes and stress, encouraging users to choose weak passwords. As an alternative, users should have the option to show or hide passwords as they type them.<ref>[http://www.lyquix.com/blog/92-do-we-need-to-hide-passwords Lyquix Blog: Do We Need to Hide Passwords?]</ref> Effective access control provisions may force extreme measures on criminals seeking to acquire a password or biometric token.<ref>[[news.bbc.co.uk]]: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4396831.stm Malaysia car thieves steal finger]</ref> Less extreme measures include [[extortion]], [[rubber hose cryptanalysis]], and [[side channel attack]]. Here are some specific password management issues that must be considered in thinking about, choosing, and handling, a password. ===Rate at which an attacker can try guessed passwords=== The rate at which an attacker can submit guessed passwords to the system is a key factor in determining system security. Some systems impose a time-out of several seconds after a small number (e.g., three) of failed password entry attempts. In the absence of other vulnerabilities, such systems can be effectively secure with relatively simple passwords, if they have been well chosen and are not easily guessed.<ref>[http://www.modernlifeisrubbish.co.uk/top-10-most-common-passwords.asp Top ten passwords used in the United Kingdom]</ref> Many systems store or transmit a [[cryptographic hash]] of the password in a manner that makes the hash value accessible to an attacker. When this is done, and it is very common, an attacker can work off-line, rapidly testing candidate passwords against the true password's hash value. Passwords that are used to generate cryptographic keys (e.g., for [[disk encryption]] or [[Wi-Fi]] security) can also be subjected to high rate guessing. Lists of common passwords are widely available and can make password attacks very
