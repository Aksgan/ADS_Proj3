Banking customers also have come to expect high reliability in their ATMs,<ref>[http://www.managementjournals.com/journals/marketing/article27-p5.htm Barking Up the Wrong Tree – Factors Influencing Customer Satisfaction in Retail Banking in the UK - Page 5] [[International Management Journals]]</ref> which provides incentives to ATM providers to minimize machine and network failures. Financial consequences of incorrect machine operation also provide high degrees of incentive to minimize malfunctions.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,875749,00.html "ATM gives out free cash and lands family in court"] [[Guardian Unlimited]]</ref> ATMs and the supporting electronic financial networks are generally very reliable, with industry benchmarks typically producing 98.25% customer availability for ATMs<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.ncr.com/en/self-service/services_v_1.pdf "Uptime in Real Time"]}} [[NCR Corportation|NCR]] publication</ref> and up to 99.999% availability for host systems. If ATMs do go out of service, customers could be left without the ability to make transactions until the beginning of their bank's next time of opening hours. This said, not all errors are to the detriment of customers; there have been cases of machines giving out money without debiting the account, or giving out higher value notes as a result of incorrect [[denomination (currency)|denomination]] of [[banknote]] being loaded in the money cassettes. Errors that can occur may be [[Machine|mechanical]] (such as card transport mechanisms; keypads; [[hard disk failure]]s); [[software]] (such as [[operating system]]; [[device driver]]; [[application software|application]]); [[information transfer|communications]]; or purely down to operator error. [[Image:ATM OS2 Crash.jpg|thumb|right|An ATM running [[OS/2]] that has crashed]] To aid in reliability, some ATMs print each transaction to a roll paper journal that is stored inside the ATM, which allows both the users of the ATMs and the related financial institutions to settle things based on the records in the journal in case there is a dispute. In some cases, transactions are posted to an electronic journal to remove the cost of supplying journal paper to the ATM and for more convenient searching of data. Improper money checking can cause the possibility of a customer receiving [[counterfeit]] banknotes from an ATM. While bank personnel are generally trained better at spotting and removing counterfeit cash,<ref>[http://www.ottawabusinessjournal.com/286598582617402.php BoC program gives merchants upper hand on counterfeiters] [[Ottawa Business Journal]]</ref><ref>[http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/banknotes/education/index.htm The Bank of Canada offers a range of free materials that explain the security features in genuine bills.] [[Bank of Canada]]</ref> the resulting ATM money supplies used by banks provide no absolute guarantee for proper banknotes, as the [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|Federal Criminal Police Office of Germany]] has confirmed that there are regularly incidents of false banknotes having been dispensed through bank ATMs.<ref>[http://www.stern.de/wirtschaft/geldanlage/:Falschgeld-Bl%FCten-Geldautomat/523625.html Blüten aus dem Geldautomat?] [[Stern (magazine)|Stern]].de report of 2004-05-05 (in German)</ref> Some ATMs may be stocked and wholly owned by outside companies, which can further complicate this problem. [[Bill validator|Bill validation]] technology can be used by ATM providers to help ensure the authenticity of the cash before it is stocked in an ATM; ATMs that have cash recycling capabilities include this capability.<ref>[http://www.wincor-nixdorf.com/internet/com/Products/CashSystems/CashRecycling/ProCash3100/index.html Welcome to Wincor Nixdorf] [[Wincor Nixdorf]] website describing [[Cash Recycling]]</ref> ==Fraud== As with any device containing objects of value, ATMs and the systems they depend on to function are the targets of fraud. Fraud against ATMs and people's attempts to use them takes several forms. The first known instance of a fake ATM was installed at a shopping mall in [[Manchester, Connecticut]] in 1993. By modifying the inner workings of a [[Fujitsu]] model [[Fujitsu 7020|7020]] ATM, a criminal gang known as The Bucklands Boys were able to steal information from cards inserted into the machine by customers.<ref>[http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/1.05/atm_pr.html The Bucklands Boys and Other Tales of the ATM]</ref> In some cases, bank fraud could occur at ATMs whereby the bank accidentally stocks the ATM with bills in the wrong denomination, therefore giving the customer more money than should be dispensed.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/3667279.stm Double money in cash point error] [[BBC]]</ref> The result of receiving too much money may be influenced on the card holder agreement in place between the customer and the bank.<ref>[http://www.rbcroyalbank.com/cards/documentation/ch_agreements/ch_agree_client.html Client Agreement – Client Card and Personal Identification Number] [[Royal Bank of Canada]] Client Card Cardholder Agreement</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4552288.stm "Mad rush to faulty ATM in France"] [[BBC]] report about a cash machine not being stocked correctly</ref> In a variation of this, [[WAVY-TV]] reported an incident in Virginia Beach of September 2006 where a hacker who had probably obtained a factory-default admin password for a gas station's white label ATM caused the unit to assume it was loaded with $5 USD bills instead of $20s, enabling himself&mdash;and many subsequent customers&mdash;to walk away with four times the money they said they wanted to withdraw.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/video/player/player.html?url=/video/tech/2006/09/14/owens.va.atm.scam.wavy "ATM turns $5s into $20s"] [[CNN]]/[[WAVY]] report, 9/14/06, about a hacked ATM at a gas station</ref><ref>Ibid, mirrored on [[YouTube]]</ref> This type of scam was featured on the TV series [[The Real Hustle]].
