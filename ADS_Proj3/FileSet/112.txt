Adobe's 2003 "[[Adobe Creative Suite|Creative Suite]]" rebranding led to Adobe Photoshop 8's renaming to Adobe Photoshop CS. Thus, Adobe Photoshop CS5 is the [[Adobe Photoshop release history|12th major release]] of Adobe Photoshop. The CS rebranding also resulted in Adobe offering numerous software packages containing multiple Adobe programs for a reduced price. Adobe Photoshop is released in two editions: '''Adobe Photoshop''', and '''Adobe Photoshop Extended''', with the Extended having extra features available. Adobe Photoshop Extended is included in all of Adobe's Creative Suite offerings except Design Standard, which includes the Adobe Photoshop edition. Alongside Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Photoshop Extended, Adobe also publishes [[Adobe Photoshop Elements]] and [[Adobe Photoshop Lightroom]], collectively called "The Adobe Photoshop Family" by Adobe. In 2008, Adobe released [[Adobe Photoshop Express]], a free [[Web application|web-based]] image editing tool to edit photos directly on blogs and social networking sites. == Development == <!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AdobePS-107-System6.png|thumb|308px|right|Photoshop 1.0.7 running in [[System 6]].]] --> {{further|[[Adobe Photoshop release history]]}} === Early history === In 1987, [[Thomas Knoll]], a PhD student at the [[University of Michigan]], began writing a program on his [[Macintosh Plus]] to display [[grayscale]] images on a monochrome display. This program, called Display, caught the attention of his brother [[John Knoll]], an [[Industrial Light & Magic]] employee, who recommended Thomas turn it into a fully-fledged image editing program. Thomas took a six month break from his studies in 1988 to collaborate with his brother on the program, which had been renamed ImagePro.<ref name="history">{{cite web |url=http://www.photoshopnews.com/feature-stories/photoshop-profile-thomas-john-knoll-10/ |title=Thomas & John Knoll |accessdate=2007-06-15 |author=Schewe, Jeff |year=2000 |work=PhotoshopNews }}</ref> Later that year, Thomas renamed his program Photoshop and worked out a short-term deal with scanner manufacturer Barneyscan to distribute copies of the program with a slide scanner; a "total of about 200 copies of Photoshop were shipped" this way.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.storyphoto.com/multimedia/multimedia_photoshop.html |title=From Darkroom to Desktop&mdash;How Photoshop Came to Light |accessdate=2007-06-15 |author=Story, Derrick |date=2000-02-18 |work=Story Photography }}</ref> During this time, John traveled to [[Silicon Valley]] and gave a demonstration of the program to engineers at [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and Russell Brown, art director at [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]]. Both showings were successful, and Adobe decided to purchase the license to distribute in September 1988.<ref name="history"/> While John worked on [[Plugin|plug-in]]s in California, Thomas remained in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] writing program code. ''Photoshop'' 1.0 was released in 1990 for Macintosh exclusively<!--, and could fit on a single 1.44 MB [[floppy disk]]-->.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://siliconuser.com/?q=node/10 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011051727/http://siliconuser.com/?q=node/10 |archivedate=2007-10-11 |title=How Adobe's Photoshop Was Born |accessdate=2007-06-15 |author=Hormby, John |date=2007-06-05 |work=Story Photography }}</ref> == Features == {{See|Comparison of raster graphics editors#Features}} Photoshop has ties with other Adobe software for media editing, animation, and authoring. The '''.PSD''' (Photoshop Document), Photoshop's native format, stores an image with support for most imaging options available in Photoshop. These include layers with [[image mask|masks]], [[color spaces]], [[ICC profile]]s, transparency, text, [[alpha channels]] and [[spot color]]s, [[clipping path]]s, and [[duotone]] settings. This is in contrast to many other file formats (e.g. .EPS or .GIF) that restrict content to provide streamlined, predictable functionality. Photoshop's popularity means that the .PSD format is widely used, and it is supported to some extent by most competing software. The .PSD file format can be exported to and from [[Adobe Illustrator]], [[Adobe Premiere Pro]], and [[Adobe After Effects|After Effects]], to make professional standard DVDs and provide non-linear editing and special effects services, such as backgrounds, textures, and so on, for television, film, and the Web. Photoshop is a [[raster graphic|pixel-based]] image editor, unlike programs such as [[Macromedia FreeHand]] (now defunct), [[Adobe Illustrator]], [[Inkscape]] or [[CorelDraw]], which are [[vector graphics|vector-based]] image editors. Photoshop uses color models [[RGB color model|RGB]], [[Lab color model|lab]], [[CMYK color model|CMYK]], [[grayscale]], binary [[bitmap]], and [[duotone]]. Photoshop has the ability to read and write [[raster graphics|raster]] and [[vector graphics|vector]] image formats such as [[Encapsulated PostScript|.EPS]], [[Portable Network Graphics|.PNG]], [[GIF|.GIF]], [[JPEG|.JPEG]], and [[Adobe Fireworks]]. === CS3 === [[Image:Photoshop CS3 Smart Layers.png|frame|right|Smart Layers display the filter without altering the original image (here on Mac OS X)]] New productivity features include a streamlined interface, improved Camera RAW support, better control over print options, enhanced [[PDF]] support, and better management with [[Adobe Bridge]]. Editing tools new to CS3 are the Clone Source palette and nondestructive Smart Filters, and other features such as the brightness and contrast adjustment and Vanishing Point module were enhanced. The Black and White adjustment option improves control over manual grayscale conversions with a dialog box similar to that of Channel Mixer. Compositing is assisted with Photoshop's new Quick Selection and Refine Edge tools and improved [[image stitching]] technology.<ref name="features">{{cite web |url=http://wwwimages.adobe.com/www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/photoshop/pdfs/photoshop_overview.pdf |title=Adobe Photoshop CS3 Product overview |accessdate=2007-06-17 |year=2007 |work=Adobe official site |format=PDF }}</ref> CS3 Extended contains all features of CS3 plus tools for editing and importing some [[List of file formats#3D graphics|3D graphics file formats]], enhancing video, and comprehensive image analysis tools, utilizing [[MATLAB]] integration and [[Digital Imaging
