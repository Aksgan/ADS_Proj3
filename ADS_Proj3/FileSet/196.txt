Eyetech Group Ltd stopped the sales of the MicroA1 due to the naturally ensuing lack of bridge chips. In January 2010, a new company, A-Eon, announced a new AmigaOne model, the [[AmigaOne X1000]]. ==AmigaOne clones and compatibles== The [[Sam440]] mainboard (complete with PPC CPU) is an embedded motherboard launched by [[Acube Systems]] in September 2007. [[AmigaOS 4]] was released for the Sam440 in October 2008. In January 2009, [[AmigaOS 4]] was released for the [[Pegasos]] 2 (G3 and G4) computer platform. ==See also== *[[Amiga models and variants]] *[[Pegasos]] *[[AmigaOS 4]] ==External links== *[http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/amiga.ars Ars Technica review of AmigaOne]. ==References== *[http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/press/july9th2002.html Eyetech and Mai Logic] - Mai Logic Incorporated And Eyetech Group Limited Partner to Capture New Amiga Territory *[http://www.micromart.co.uk/default.aspx?contentid=bb84c763-47ce-49c8-80ee-1d2573990320&keywords=amigaone Micro Mart]{{dead link|date=November 2010}} - Weekly computer magazine published in the UK *[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/03/27/amiga_returns_with_amigaone_ppc/ The Register] - Amiga returns with AmigaOne PPC hardware *[http://web.archive.org/web/20011121044901/http://www.eyetech.co.uk/addbar.php?Address=/NEWS/AMIGA001.HTM Eyetech] - Archived page containing AmigaOne update and information on the AmigaOne partnership between Eyetech, Hyperion Entertainment and [[Amiga Inc]]. *[http://web.archive.org/web/20030428162422/http://www.micromart.co.uk/content/features/default.asp?Category=Article&Type=&ID=398 Micromart]{{dead link|date=November 2010}} - An archived article detailing the release of the AmigaOne G3-SE and commenting on the AmigaOne-1200 that never materialised. *[http://web.archive.org/web/20020329122512/http://www.amiga.com/corporate/032502-mcewen.shtml Amiga Inc] - Amiga status announcement *[http://www.potduck.com/amigaone/ AmigaOne Debian Linux] *[http://amigaworld.net/modules/features/index.php?op=r&cat_id=8&rev_id=67&sort_by AmigaOne model comparison table] {{AmigaOS 4}} {{Amiga hardware}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Amigaone}} [[Category:Amiga]] [[Category:PowerPC mainboards]] [[Category:AmigaOS]] [[de:AmigaOne]] [[es:AmigaOne]] [[it:AmigaOne]] [[ja:AmigaOne]] [[pl:AmigaOne]] [[ru:AmigaOne]] [[sv:AmigaOne]]</text> </page> <page> <id>1728</id> <title>Amiga Internet and communications software</title> <text>{{Cleanup|date=March 2008}} This article is a split of main article [[Amiga software]] and refers to any communication and internet software that run on [[Amiga]] line of computers.

Minitel started the phenomenon of chatting, exchange mail, providing on-line services such as railways or TV broadcast timetables, travel and hotel booking, etcetera. Minitel used little terminals rented from telephone companies or computers with modems that accept Minitel transmission protocol speed. The speed was asynchronous at 1200/75 baud (1200 baud receiving, 75 baud transmitting). There were made Amiga Minitel communication programs in France, Germany and Italy. In Italy it was released [[Amiga Videotel]]. ===Teletext, Televideo, Viewdata=== Teletext is an information retrieval service system based on transmitting data with normal TV broadcast signals and showing it separately, without interfering with normal TV programs. About this kind of service, on Amiga there are TV cards viewers that view Teletext pages and save them as standard image files. Standalone programs for Teletext included the [[Amiga Teletext]] program, and the datatype [http://www.unsatisfactorysoftware.co.uk/download.php?file=vtx_dt Videotex Datatype]. ===FAX, Answering Machine and Voice Mail=== [[AFax]], [[Amiga-FAX]], [[GPFax]], [[FaxQuik]], [[STFax]], [[TrapFax]], [[AVM]], [[MultiAnswer]], [[Zyxel Voice Mail]] ==ISDN== [[ISDN]] digital telephone and circuit-switched telephone network system were supported via the expansion cards ISDN Master and ISDN Master II, their drivers and related software. ==Networking and Ethernet protocols== Depending from the hardware cards and their drivers and software, Amiga supported [[SANA-II]] protocols, [[envoy (title)|Envoy]] protocols from IAM, [[AS225]], [[AS225r2]] TCP-IP from Commodore, [[DECnet]], [[Novell Netware]] through [[Amiga Client for Novell Netware]], [[Quicknet]] fast proprietary peer to peer procol, [[Appletalk]] through emulators. Other network protocols available were [[AmigaUUCP]], [[DNET]], [[Link-It]] and [[Enlan-DFS]]. Amiga currently supports also [[Samba (software)|Samba]], and [[SMBFS]]. ==World Wide Web== [[Image:tcps.svg]] Almost all these programs are recent and available mainly for new Amiga platforms. *'''Amiga TCP/IP:''' [[AmiTCP]], EasyNet, [[Genesis (software)|Genesis]], [[Miami (software)|Miami]] and Miami Deluxe, [[Roadshow (software)|Roadshow]] for [[AmigaOS]], [[MosNet]] and [[NetStack]] for MorphOS (both based on [[AmiTCP]]). *'''Browsers:''' *Old browsers or "text only" based ones: **Amiga [[AMosaic|Mosaic]], Amiga [[Alynx|Lynx]], [[Emacs/W3]] WWW client in GNU [[Emacs]]. *Modern browsers up to HTML 3.2 without CSS: **[[IBrowse]], [[Voyager (web browser)|Voyager]], [[AWeb]], and also [[Amaya (web browser)|Amaya]] through the [[X11]] Amiga compatibility graphic engine library [[Cygnix]]. *Actual Browsers with HTML 4.0 and CSS: **[http://www.sand-labs.org/owb/ OWB] [[Origyn Web Browser]] is the de-facto modern Browser for all Amiga systems. OWB for [[AmigaOS 4]] and Classic Amigas (OS 3.9) was developed by Italian [[Andrea Palmaté]] and then updated by German programmer [[Joerg Strohmayer]]. AmigaOS Classic version is 1.1 and based upon original codename version "Blastoise" (this software also integrates itself with IBrowse). Current AmigaOS 4.X version is 3.22 based upon original version codenamed "Pukapuka". Origyn Web Browser for AROS is 0.9.9. Actual MorphOS version is 1.7 (also based on "Pukapuka") and it the first version to support [[HTML5]] media tags ''<video>'' and ''<audio>'' through [[FFMpeg]].<ref name=mosport>{{Cite web| title = Origyn Web Browser for MorphOS | url = http://fabportnawak.free.fr/owb/ | publisher=Fabian Coeurjoly | accessdate January
