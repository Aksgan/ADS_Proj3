Applications supporting ToolTalk can construct "high-level" messages and hand them off to the system's ToolTalk server, which determines the proper recipients and (after applying permission checks) forwards the message to them. Although originally available only on [[SunOS]] and [[Solaris Operating System|Solaris]], ToolTalk was chosen as the application framework for the [[Common Desktop Environment]] and thus became part of a number of [[Unix]] distributions as well as [[OpenVMS]]. While ToolTalk had "object oriented" and "procedural" messages and a complex "pattern" structure which allowed dispatch of messages to processes based on object names, message names, and parameter types, actual desktop protocols never took full advantage of its power.<ref>Julienne, Astrid M. and Holtz, Brian ''ToolTalk and Open Protocols: Inter-Application Communication'' (1994)</ref> Simpler pattern-matching systems like [[Apple Computer]]'s [[AppleScript]] system did just as well. The [[D-Bus]] standard has superseded ToolTalk in [[Unix]]-like desktop environments. ==References== {{Reflist}} [[Category:Inter-process communication]] [[Category:Sun Microsystems software]] [[no:ToolTalk]] [[ru:ToolTalk]]</text> </page> <page> <id>37903</id> <title>Toolchain</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}} In [[software]], a '''toolchain''' is the set of [[programming tool]]s that are used to create a product (typically another computer program or system of programs). The tools may be used in a chain, so that the output of each tool becomes the input for the next, but the term is used widely to refer to any set of linked development tools. A simple software development toolchain consists of a [[text editor]] for editing [[source code]], a [[compiler]] and [[Linker (computing)|linker]] to transform the source code into an [[executable program]], [[software library|libraries]] to provide interfaces to the [[operating system]], and a [[debugger]]. A complex product such as a [[video game]] needs tools for preparing [[sound effect]]s, music, [[Texture (computer graphics)|texture]]s, [[3D model|3-dimensional model]]s, and [[animation]]s, and further tools for combining these resources into the finished product. ==See also== * [[GNU toolchain]] * [[Linux From Scratch]] [[Category:Computer programming tools]] [[de:Toolchain]] [[es:Cadena de herramientas]] [[fa:زنجیره ابزار]] [[fr:Toolchain]] [[hy:Toolchain]] [[ko:툴체인]] [[it:Toolchain]] [[ja:ツールチェーン]] [[sk:Toolchain]] [[zh:工具鏈]]</text> </page> <page> <id>37904</id> <title>Toolkits for User Innovation</title> <text>{{multiple issues|advert =December 2007|primarysources =April 2008}} '''Toolkits for user innovation''' (the process) is an innovation process in which the user itself does part of the innovation within a set environment. The process was formalized by [[Eric von Hippel]] in the article '''PERSPECTIVE: User toolkits for innovation''' and it is based on his belief in innovation made by [[lead user]]s. The process is based on the idea that manufacturers possess the knowledge of the solution possibilities, while the users possess the knowledge about needs. This information is [[sticky information|sticky]] and can therefore not be transferred easily between the user and the manufacturer. The process can be used in a variety of settings, and has been shown to be applicable in systems ranging from production of electronic circuitry to Apache security software. == Content of a toolkit == The process as described by von Hippel has five criteria: # Learning by trial-and-error # An appropriate solution space. # A user friendly toolkit # Commonly used modules # Result easily created by Devolper === Learning by trial-and-error === It is important that the user is able to go through complete trial-and-error cycles when designing the product. This allows the users to see the consequences of the design choices they make, and thereby decide more precisely what they really want. Trial-and-error has been shown by research to be the way that most problem solving is done. === An appropriate solution space === A solution space is defined by the flexibility in which the producer can produce the desired result. Any production process has a set of limiting factors, and these factors define the solution space. If the solution space is small(less number of limiting factors ), the chance of user innovations are big. === A user friendly toolkit === The process must be available to the users so that they can use the skills and languages they already know. This frees the users from learning the different design-specific skills and languages associated with manufacturing. === Commonly used modules === Custom designs are seldom made up of unique parts, but instead share a set of standard modules. Therefore a library of standard modules should be available to the user. This allows the user to focus on the unique parts that are truly important. === Results easily created === The result from the process must be easily converted into the language needed for the production system, and be without error. If the result of the process must be manually translated much of the effect of the toolkit may be lost. ==See also== * [[Configuration System]] * [[Creativity techniques]] * Lead user * [[Open Innovation]] * [[Product management]] * [[product differentiation]] * [[User innovation]] * [[Crowdcasting]] ==External links== * [http://web.mit.edu/evhippel/www/ Eric Von Hippel's homepage] Books and articles in the creative commons licence available.

Harj Toor ==Purpose== In Unix, it is traditional to keep the root [[File system|filesystem]] as small as reasonably possible, moving larger, fancier programs and rapidly-changing data to other, optional parts of the system. This increases the likelihood that the system can be brought to a semi-usable state in the case of a partial system failure. It also means that the superuser account, necessary for repairing a broken system, should not depend on any programs outside of this small core. So the 'root'
