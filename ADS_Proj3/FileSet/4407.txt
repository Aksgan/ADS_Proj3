individuals not of one's own ethnic, racial, or other group&mdash;are common human behaviors. The intersection of the two&mdash;which we term "parochial altruism"&mdash;is puzzling from an evolutionary perspective because altruistic or parochial behavior reduces one's payoffs by comparison to what one would gain from eschewing these behaviors. But parochial altruism could have evolved if parochialism promoted intergroup hostilities and the combination of altruism and parochialism contributed to success in these conflicts.... [Neither] would have been viable singly, but by promoting group conflict they could have evolved jointly. {{Harv|Choi|Bowles|2007}} </blockquote> They do not claim that humans have actually evolved in this way, but that computer simulations show how war could be promoted by the interaction of these behaviors. == Conclusion == When Richard Dawkins set out to "examine the biology of selfishness and altruism" in [[The Selfish Gene]], he reinterpreted the basis of evolution, and therefore of altruism. He was "not advocating a morality based on evolution",<ref> {{Harvnb|Dawkins|1989|p=2}}. </ref> and even felt that "we must teach our children altruism, for we cannot expect it to be part of their biological nature."<ref> {{Harvnb|Dawkins|1989|p=139}}. </ref> But John Maynard Smith<ref> {{Harvs|nb|last=Maynard Smith|year1=1976|year2=1978|year3=1982|}} </ref> was showing that behavior could be subject to evolution, Robert Trivers had shown that reciprocal altruism is strongly favored by natural selection to lead to complex systems of altruistic behavior (supporting Kropotkin's argument that cooperation is as much a factor of evolution as competition<ref> {{Harvnb|Kropotkin|1902}}. Why Kropotkin did not prevail is interesting &ndash; see Stephen Jay Gould's article "Kroptokin was no crackpot" {{Harv|Gould|1997}} &ndash; but beyond the scope of this article. </ref>), and Axelrod's dramatic results showed that in a very simple game the conditions for survival (be "nice", be provocable, promote the mutual interest) seem to be the essence of morality. While this does not yet amount to a [[science of morality]], the game theoretic approach has clarified the conditions required for the evolution and persistence of cooperation, and shown how Darwinian natural selection can lead to complex behavior, including notions of morality, fairness, and justice. It is shown that the nature of self-interest is more profound than previously considered, and that behavior that seems altruistic may, in a broader view, be individually beneficial.
