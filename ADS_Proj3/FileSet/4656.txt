for humans. These envelopes underlie the experience of self-consciousness, [[anxiety]] and pain.<ref>''Up from Dragons'', pp. 110-115</ref> === Social neuroscience === ====Limbic symbolons==== Symbolons were [[Ancient_Greece|ancient Greek]] tokens or insignia by which people who were bonded could spot each other (the word comes from the [[ancient Greek|Greek]] “symballein” which means “to throw together”). The problem of social [[primates]] is to create [[Human_bonding|bonds]] that are flexible yet also allow prolonged separation. Limbic symbolons are symbols that enable emotional attachments established in other apes by smell, grooming and to some degree sight, to cope with physical separation by an internal (mental name) or external (wedding ring) stand-in that is always cognitively present. Limbic symbols are usually publicly defined (another advantage) and acquired in [[rituals]].<ref>''Up from Dragons'', pp. 203-206</ref> “Early hominid environments were dangerous and food resources patchy and irregular, which placed a premium on individuals able to exploit kin relations and extend social links beyond the immediate present. Such pressures promoted symbolism, originally to stand for kin recognition and social relationships, enabling these to be maintained over time and space even when the relevant individuals were absent. These developments in turn lead to more complex social networks and the cognitive abilities to exploit these.”<ref name=" Bilsborough">Bilsborough, A. (2003) [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=176232&sectioncode=31 Why we changed our minds: Up from dragons Book review], [[Times Higher Education Supplement|THES]], 25 April. </ref> ====Nonimmediate sociability==== Two kinds of sociability exist: immediate and nonimmediate. The former depends upon sensory interaction with others such as [[body odor|smell]], [[Haptics_-_Nonverbal|touch]], sound or vision. Nonimmediate depends upon carrying the experience of the group within the head. Such sociability is already present in apes and is due to processes called mindmakers.<ref>''Up from Dragons'', pp. 106-108</ref> But due to the modification of these mindmakers with symbolons, sociability in groups has become highly developed in humans. The combination of symbols and mindmakers created social mindware.<ref>''Up from Dragons'', pp. 106-108</ref> ====Mindmakers==== These are “processes that weave this sense we all have of being a ‘me. .. give existence its animated feel, the feeling of being alive. They are clues to understanding such things as our freedom and the links between the prefrontal cortex’s inner cues and our hidden sociability’”.<ref>''Up from Dragons'', pp109</ref> Mindmakers evolved to enable animals to remain part of a social group when separated. Mindmaker processes are identified in the anterior cingulate cortex (protective attentive envelopes), hippocampus (continuity), orbitofrontal cortex (social right and wrong). Mindmakers are present in other animals but only in humans have they become extensively elaborated. They also provide the neural substrate for cultural symbolism and so the human ability to sustain socially defined groups and personal bonds.<ref>''Up from Dragons'', pp. 109, 123, 157, 160-161, 180</ref> ====Mindware==== Mindware is the symbolic counterpart of mindmakers. The concept differs from that of [[memes]] in the way that the descriptive notion of a “[[bridge]]” differs from that of specified engineering types of bridges ([[suspension bridge|suspension]], [[cantilever bridge|cantilever]], [[arch bridge|arch]] and so on). In the latter, what transmits is understood in terms of the specific engineering processes that support that transmission rather than the general idea of transmission.<ref>Skoyles, JR (2008) Natural selection does not explain cultural rates of change. [[PNAS|Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A]]. 105(22):E27 {{PMID|18511553}}</ref> The use of a wedding ring is a [[meme]] when viewed from the perspective of transmitted culture, but it is mindware when viewed from the neurological changes it makes to the attachment processes in the brain that sustain the emotional bond of marriage.<ref>''Up from Dragons'', pp. 202-206</ref> The acquisition of social mindware is closely linked with rituals.<ref>''Up from Dragons'', p. 205</ref> In mindware “the human ape found a brain programming language to bond across time and place—symbolic culture. This was to change forever what it meant to be a brain. Now the human mind could live in thousands of varieties of life. …with their mindware humans set themselves apart from other animals and the rest of nature”.<ref>''Up from Dragons'', p. 206</ref> ====Social embodiment==== The subjective sense of embodiment in our extended physical [[body]] relates to its capacity to act through it and so interact with the autonomous physical world. The human brain also acts within the autonomous world of [[Interpersonal_relationship|social relationships]]. This social embodiment gives rise to a sense of social “me” .<ref>''Up from Dragons'', pp. 170-172</ref> Consciousness is the embodied attention of the brain to its causality in such social relationships and the physical world.<ref>''Up from Dragons'', pp. 175-178</ref> ====Superfission-fusion ape==== The sociability of social apes is [[Fission-fusion_society|fission-fusion]]. In this members of a group regularly separate into small subgroups (fission) but at the same time still belong to the same group (fusion). Human are unique in the robust ability of their bonds to survive prolonged physical separation. This is due to symbols. Another factor is that these bonds can be publicly defined and so create symbolic culture. This makes humans a superfission-fusion ape.<ref> Rodseth L, Wrangham RW, Harrigan, AM, Smuts BB. (1991) The Human Community as a Primate Society. [[Current Anthropology]], 32, 221-254</ref><ref>''Up from Dragons'', pp. 98, 183-190</ref> === Humanities === ====Brain Age==== The [[Era]] that will follow the present one will be the Brain Age. In this [[neuroscience]] will replace the ancient myths that at present shape how people understand themselves. Further, braintech (see below) will arise that enables humans to reshape the competences of their brain. This Era will continue the reshaping of our species that has happened since its origins 120,000 years ago. Braintech represents the last frontier faced by the human species.<ref>''Up from Dragons'', pp. 269-279</ref> ====Brain Rights==== Humans are social primates who use superficial differences (such as [[Human_skin_color|skin pigmentation]]) or symbols based upon ancient myth to identify their [[Social identity|group membership]]. Brains offer a firmer foundation for our identity since they underlie the core of who we are in our shared “vulnerability, richness, history, and giftedness”.<ref>''Up from Dragons'', p. 279</ref> Understanding this is our true nature. It follows that “Each of our brains should be guaranteed the right to grow unhandicapped and supplied with the best possible nurture and support”,<ref>''Up from Dragons'', p. 281</ref>
