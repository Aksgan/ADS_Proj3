of the uncertainty principle. Wavelet transforms are broadly divided into three classes: continuous, discrete and multiresolution-based. ===Continuous wavelet transforms (continuous shift and scale parameters) === In [[continuous wavelet transform]]s, a given signal of finite energy is projected on a continuous family of frequency bands (or similar subspaces of the [[Lp space|L<sup>p</sup>]] [[function space]] <math>L^2(\R)</math>). For instance the signal may be represented on every frequency band of the form <math>[f,2f]</math> for all positive frequencies ''f>0''. Then, the original signal can be reconstructed by a suitable integration over all the resulting frequency components. The frequency bands or subspaces (sub-bands) are scaled versions of a subspace at scale ''1''. This subspace in turn is in most situations generated by the shifts of one generating function <math>\psi \in L^2(\R)</math>, the ''mother wavelet''. For the example of the scale one frequency band <math>[1,2]</math> this function is :<math>\psi(t)=2\,\operatorname{sinc}(2t)-\,\operatorname{sinc}(t)=\frac{\sin(2\pi t)-\sin(\pi t)}{\pi t}</math> with the (normalized) [[sinc function]]. Other example mother wavelets are: {| | [[Image:Wavelet - Meyer.png|thumb|150px|Meyer]] | [[Image:Wavelet - Morlet.png|thumb|150px|[[Morlet wavelet|Morlet]] ]] | [[Image:Wavelet - Mex Hat.png|thumb|150px|[[Mexican Hat wavelet|Mexican Hat]] ]] |} The subspace of scale ''a'' or frequency band <math>[1/a,\,2/a]</math> is generated by the functions (sometimes called ''child wavelets'') :<math>\psi_{a,b} (t) = \frac1{\sqrt a }\psi \left( \frac{t - b}{a} \right)</math>, where ''a'' is positive and defines the scale and ''b'' is any real number and defines the shift. The pair ''(a,b)'' defines a point in the right halfplane <math>\R_+\times \R</math>. The projection of a function ''x'' onto the subspace of scale ''a'' then has the form :<math>x_a(t)=\int_\R WT_\psi\{x\}(a,b)\cdot\psi_{a,b}(t)\,db</math> with ''wavelet coefficients'' :<math>WT_\psi\{x\}(a,b)=\langle x,\psi_{a,b}\rangle=\int_\R x(t)\overline{\psi_{a,b}(t)}\,dt</math>. See a list of some [[Continuous wavelets]]. For the analysis of the signal ''x'', one can assemble the wavelet coefficients into a [[scaleogram]] of the signal. ===Discrete wavelet transforms (discrete shift and scale parameters)=== It is computationally impossible to analyze a signal using all wavelet coefficients, so one may wonder if it is sufficient to pick a discrete subset of the upper halfplane to be able to reconstruct a signal from the corresponding wavelet coefficients. One such system is the [[affine]] system for some real parameters ''a>1'', ''b>0''. The corresponding discrete subset of the halfplane consists of all the points <math>(a^m, n\,a^m b)</math> with integers <math>m,n\in\Z</math>. The corresponding ''baby wavelets'' are now given as :<math> \psi_{m,n}(t)=a^{-m/2}\psi(a^{-m}t-nb)</math>. A sufficient condition for the reconstruction of any signal ''x'' of finite energy by the formula :<math> x(t)=\sum_{m\in\Z}\sum_{n\in\Z}\langle x,\,\psi_{m,n}\rangle\cdot\psi_{m,n}(t)</math> is that the functions <math>\{\psi_{m,n}:m,n\in\Z\}</math> form a [[frame of a vector space#Tight frames|tight frame]] of <math>L^2(\R)</math>. ===Multiresolution discrete wavelet transforms=== <!-- MRA:: probably Multi resolution analysis based transforms... but I'm not sure content matches section header... weirdness. --> [[Image:Daubechies4-functions.png|thumb|right|D4 wavelet]] In any discretised wavelet transform, there are only a finite number of wavelet coefficients for each bounded rectangular region in the upper halfplane. Still, each coefficient requires the evaluation of an integral. To avoid this numerical complexity, one needs one auxiliary function, the ''father wavelet'' <math>\phi\in L^2(\R)</math>. Further, one has to restrict ''a'' to be an integer. A typical choice is ''a=2'' and ''b=1''. The most famous pair of father and mother wavelets is the [[Daubechies wavelets|Daubechies]] 4 tap wavelet. From the mother and father wavelets one constructs the subspaces :<math>V_m=\operatorname{span}(\phi_{m,n}:n\in\Z)</math>, where <math>\phi_{m,n}(t)=2^{-m/2}\phi(2^{-m}t-n)</math> and :<math>W_m=\operatorname{span}(\psi_{m,n}:n\in\Z)</math>, where <math>\psi_{m,n}(t)=2^{-m/2}\psi(2^{-m}t-n)</math>. From these one requires that the sequence :<math>\{0\}\subset\dots\subset V_1\subset V_0\subset V_{-1}\subset\dots\subset L^2(\R)</math> forms a [[multiresolution analysis]] of <math>L^2(\R)</math> and that the subspaces <math>\dots,W_1,W_0,W_{-1},\dots\dots</math> are the orthogonal "differences" of the above sequence, that is, <math>W_m</math> is the orthogonal complement of <math>V_m</math> inside the subspace <math>V_{m-1}</math>. In analogy to the [[sampling theorem]] one may conclude that the space <math>V_m</math> with sampling distance <math>2^m</math> more or less covers the frequency baseband from ''0'' to <math>2^{-m-1}</math>. As orthogonal complement, <math>W_m</math> roughly covers the band <math>[2^{-m-1},2^{-m}]</math>. From those inclusions and orthogonality relations follows the existence of sequences <math>h=\{h_n\}_{n\in\Z}</math> and <math>g=\{g_n\}_{n\in\Z}</math> that satisfy the identities :<math>h_n=\langle\phi_{0,0},\,\phi_{-1,n}\rangle</math> and <math>\phi(t)=\sqrt2 \sum_{n\in\Z} h_n\phi(2t-n)</math> and :<math>g_n=\langle\psi_{0,0},\,\phi_{-1,n}\rangle</math> and <math>\psi(t)=\sqrt2 \sum_{n\in\Z} g_n\phi(2t-n)</math>. The second identity of the first pair is a [[Refinable function|refinement equation]] for the father wavelet <math>\phi</math>. Both pairs of identities form the basis for the algorithm of the [[fast wavelet transform]]. == Mother wavelet == For practical applications, and for efficiency reasons, one prefers continuously differentiable functions with compact support as mother (prototype) wavelet (functions). However, to satisfy analytical requirements (in the continuous WT) and in general for theoretical reasons, one chooses the wavelet functions from a subspace of the [[Lp space|space]] <math>L^1(\R)\cap L^2(\R).</math> This is the space of [[Lebesgue integration|measurable functions]] that are absolutely and square [[integrable function|integrable]]: :<math>\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi (t)|\, dt <\infty</math> and <math>\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi (t)|^2 \, dt <\infty.</math> Being in this space ensures that one can formulate the conditions of zero mean and square norm one: :<math>\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \psi (t)\, dt = 0</math> is the condition for zero mean, and :<math>\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi (t)|^2\, dt = 1</math> is the condition for square norm one. For <math>\psi</math> to be a wavelet for the [[continuous wavelet transform]] (see there for exact statement), the mother wavelet must satisfy an admissibility criterion (loosely speaking, a kind of half-differentiability) in order to get a stably invertible transform. For the [[discrete wavelet transform]], one needs at least the condition that the [[wavelet series]] is a representation of the identity in the [[Lp space|space]] <math>L^2(\R)</math>. Most constructions of discrete WT make use of the [[multiresolution analysis]], which defines the wavelet by a scaling function. This scaling function itself is solution to a functional equation. In most situations it is useful to restrict <math>\psi</math> to be a continuous function with a higher number ''M'' of vanishing moments, i.e. for all integer ''m<M'' :<math>\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} t^m\,\psi (t)\, dt = 0.</math> The mother wavelet is scaled (or dilated) by a factor of <math>a</math> and translated (or shifted) by a factor of <math>b</math> to give (under Morlet's original formulation): :<math>\psi _{a,b} (t) = {1 \over {\sqrt a }}\psi \left( {{{t - b} \over a}} \right).</math> For the continuous WT, the pair ''(a,b)'' varies over the full half-plane <math>\R_+\times\R</math>; for the discrete WT this pair varies over a discrete subset of it, which is also called ''affine group''.
