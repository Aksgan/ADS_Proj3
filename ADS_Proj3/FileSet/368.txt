the [[sum (Unix)|GNU sum]] command line utility. ==Newer checksum algorithms== The manual page of the GNU sum utility program (that implements the BSD checksum algorithm) states: ''sum is provided for compatibility; the cksum program is preferable in new applications''. ==Computation of the BSD checksum== Here is the relevant part of the [[GNU]] sum source code ([[GPL]] licensed): <pre> FILE *fp; /* The file handle for input data* / int ch; /* Each character read. */ int checksum = 0; /* The checksum mod 2^16. */ while ((ch = getc (fp)) != EOF) { ... checksum = (checksum >> 1) + ((checksum & 1) << 15); checksum += ch; checksum &= 0xffff; /* Keep it within bounds. */ } </pre> ==Description of the algorithm== This algorithm computes a 16-bit checksum by adding up all 16-bit words of the input data stream. In order to avoid many of the weaknesses of simply adding the data, the accumulator is rotated to the right by one bit at each step. ==Sources== * [http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/sum-invocation.html official GNU sum manual page] * [http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/ coreutils download page] --- find and unpack the newest version of the coreutils package, read src/sum.c [[Category:Checksum algorithms]]</text> </page> <page> <id>3190</id> <title>BTSharp</title> <text>{{orphan|date=February 2010}} {{unreferenced|date=November 2008}} {{Infobox Software | name = BTSharp (.NET Library) | logo = | screenshot = | caption = | developer = David Smith | released = ? | frequently_updated = yes<!-- Release version update?

The website is owned and operated by Lesson Nine, GmbH, a young company based in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. The free-access website allows users to join and learn any of five languages: [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[German language|German]], and there are currently localized versions available in all of these languages except Italian. Originally created in response to a perceived lack of user-friendly language-learning software<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/04/flex-startup-babbel InfoQ: Flex Startup Helps Learning New Languages<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, and modeled after a video game console<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://freelanguage.org/learn/babbel-virtual-flashcard-language-share-site-english-french-german-italian-spanish-tools-and-video-game-like-interface Babbel.com Virtual FlashCard Language Share Site w/English, French, German, Italian, Spanish Tools and Video Game-Like Interface | Free Language<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, Babbel incorporates images and spoken voices for an "intuitive" learning experience. What differentiates Babbel from other online language learning applications is its collaborative approach to populating the vocabulary lists<ref name=autogenerated2 />. The core content of the website is generated by an in-house staff, but this is augmented by user-contributed content and feedback. Babbel users upload photos that are used in lessons and rate photos contributed by other users to make sure the images correspond to the meanings attributed to them. The name for the company, "Babbel", is derived from the [[German Swabian]] dialect verb "babbeln," which means to speak casually and vividly. It is also associated with the English verb "to babble", which like the German verb, comes from the name of the biblical city of Babylon, the Tower of Babel and the legend of the confusion of languages. ==The Website== The application lets users participate in learning packages through virtual flashcard software that includes user-contributed images. The flash card stacks are organized into "packages" (groups of cards) that treat a common theme, such as youth hostels, winter sports, restaurants and eating out, fruits and vegetables, clothing, standard greetings, giving and receiving compliments, etc. With input and contributions from the users, these packages get consistently more comprehensive as more people contribute<ref name=autogenerated2 />. Another feature of the website is the so-called "refresher tool" that keeps track of users' progress and tells them when they are due for review. Babbel.com takes after popular social-networking sites like [[Facebook]] and [[Facebook|MySpace]], and has users create profiles so as to communicate with others on the website, via private message or on the public "Board". Lesson Nine created this element to facilitate users partnering up for language exchanges, known by the German word "tandem," (exchange). The viewing of profile data and communicating with people on Babbel is limited to Babbel users<ref>[http://www.downloadsquad.com/2008/03/24/learn-a-new-language-at-babbel-por-favor/ Learn a new language at Babbel, por favor - Download Squad<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.<ref>[http://www.riapedia.com/tags/languages languages | RIA pedia - Rich Internet Applications - Its all about the user experience!<!--
