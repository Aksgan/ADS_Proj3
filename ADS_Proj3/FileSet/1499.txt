comfortable relying on their instincts, this reliance does not always translate into superior predictive ability. For example, in the popular Analysis, Comparison, Evaluation, and Verification (ACE-V) paradigm for fingerprint identification, the verification stage, in which a second examiner confirms the assessment of the original examiner, may increase the consistency of the assessments. But while the verification stage has implications for the reliability of latent print comparisons, it does not assure their validity."|Sandy L Zabell|2005.<ref name= zabell />{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}}} The few tests that have been made of the validity of forensic fingerprinting have not been supportive of the method. {{quote|"Despite the absence of objective standards, scientific validation, and adequate statistical studies, a natural question to ask is how well fingerprint examiners actually perform. Proficiency tests do not validate a procedure per se, but they can provide some insight into error rates. In 1995, the Collaborative Testing Service (CTS) administered a proficiency test that, for the first time, was “designed, assembled, and reviewed” by the International Association for Identification (IAI).The results were disappointing. Four suspect cards with prints of all ten fingers were provided together with seven latents. Of 156 people taking the test, only 68 (44%) correctly classified all seven latents. Overall, the tests contained a total of 48 incorrect identifications. David Grieve, the editor of the Journal of Forensic Identification, describes the reaction of the forensic community to the results of the CTS test as ranging from “shock to disbelief,” and added:<blockquote> 'Errors of this magnitude within a discipline singularly admired and respected for its touted absolute certainty as an identification process have produced chilling and mind- numbing realities. Thirty-four participants, an incredible 22% of those involved, substituted presumed but false certainty for truth. By any measure, this represents a profile of practice that is unacceptable and thus demands positive action by the entire community.'{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}</blockquote> What is striking about these comments is that they do not come from a critic of the fingerprint community, but from the editor of one of its premier publications."|Sandy L Zabell|2005.<ref name= zabell />{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}}} Investigations have been conducted into whether experts can objectively focus on feature information in fingerprints without being misled by extraneous information, such as context.<ref name="fsijournal.org">Dror, I.E., Charlton, D. and Péron, A.E.

Fingerprint identification emerged as an important system within police agencies in the late 19th century, when it replaced anthropometric measurements as a more reliable method for identifying persons having a prior record, often under a false name, in a criminal record repository.<ref name= ashbaugh1 /> The science of fingerprint identification has been able to assert its standing amongst forensic sciences for many reasons. ====Track record==== Fingerprinting has served all governments worldwide during the past 100 years or so to provide accurate identification of criminals.
