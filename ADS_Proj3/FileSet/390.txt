''S'' is a set, the term barycentric set is used instead of barycentric sequence. For example, the set {0,1,2,3,4} <math>\subseteq Z_8</math> is 5-barycentric with barycenter 2, however the set {0,2,3,4,5} <math>\subseteq Z_8</math> is not 5-barycentric. The barycentric-sum problem consist in finding the smallest integer ''t'' such that any sequence of length ''t'' contains a ''k''-barycentric sequence for some given ''k''.The study of the existence of such t related with k and the study of barycentric constants are part of the barycentric-sum problems. It has been introduced by Ordaz,<ref>C. Delorme, S. González, O. Ordaz and M.T. Varela. Barycentric sequences and barycentric Ramsey numbers stars, Discrete Math. 277(2004)45–56.</ref><ref>C.

Notice that a ''k''-barycentric sequence in <math>Z_n</math>, with k a multiple of n, is a sequence with zero-sum. The [[zero-sum problem]] on sequences started in 1961 with the Erdős, Ginzburg and Ziv theorem: every sequence of length <math>2n-1</math> in an [[abelian group]] of order ''n'', contains an ''n''-subsequence with zero-sum.<ref>Y.

A sequence :<math>B = [\beta_1,\beta_2,...,\beta_k]</math> of ''k ''distinct elements of <math>\Omega</math> is a '''base''' for G if the only element of <math>G</math> which fixes every <math>\beta_i \in B</math> pointwise is the identity element of <math>G</math>. We define the concept of a [[strong generating set]] relative to a base. Bases and strong generating sets are concepts of importance in [[computational group theory]]. A base and a strong generating set (together often called a BSGS) for a group can be obtained using the [[Schreier–Sims algorithm]]. It is often beneficial to deal with bases and strong generating sets as these may be easier to work with than the entire group. A group may have a small base compared to the set it acts on. In the "worst case", the [[symmetric group]]s and [[alternating group]]s have large bases (the symmetric group ''S''<sub>''n''</sub> has base size ''n'' &minus; 1), and there are often specialized algorithms that deal with these cases. {{algebra-stub}} [[Category:Permutation groups]] [[Category:Computational group theory]] [[eo:Bazo (grupa teorio)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>3397</id> <title>Base One Foundation Component Library</title> <text>{{Infobox Software | name = Base One Foundation Component Library (BFC) | logo = | screenshot = | caption = | collapsible = | author = | developer = [[Base One International| Base One International Corp.]] | released = | latest_release_version = 7.43 | latest_release_date = {{Release date|2011|01|15}} | latest preview version = | latest preview date = | frequently updated = | programming language = [[Visual C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] | operating_system = [[Microsoft Windows]] | platform = [[Microsoft Visual Studio]], [[.NET Framework|.NET]] | language = | status = | genre = [[Web application framework]] | license = [[Base One]] [[EULA]] | website = http://www.boic.com/ }} The '''Base One Foundation Component Library''' ('''BFC''') is a [[rapid application development]] toolkit for building secure, [[Fault-tolerant system|fault-tolerant]], [[database]] applications on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[ASP.NET]].
