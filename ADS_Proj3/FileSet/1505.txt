= false and 1 = true. The [[characteristic function]] of the relation ''L'', written ''ƒ''<sub>''L''</sub> or χ(''L''), is the [[Boolean-valued function]] ''ƒ''<sub>''L''</sub> : ''X''<sub>1</sub> &times; … &times; ''X''<sub>''k''</sub> → '''B''', defined in such a way that ''ƒ''<sub>''L''</sub>(<math>\mathbf{x}</math>) = 1 just in case the ''k''-tuple <math>\mathbf{x}</math> is in the relation ''L''. In [[probability]] and [[statistics]], where characteristic function has another meaning, [[indicator function]] refers to what is here called a characteristic function. It is conventional in applied mathematics, [[computer science]], and statistics to refer to a Boolean-valued function like ''ƒ''<sub>''L''</sub> as a ''k''-place [[predicate (mathematics)|predicate]]. From the more abstract viewpoint of [[formal logic]] and [[model theory]], the relation ''L'' constitutes a ''logical model'' or a ''relational structure'' that serves as one of many possible [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]]s of some ''k''-place predicate symbol. Because relations arise in many scientific disciplines as well as in many branches of [[mathematics]] and [[logic]], there is considerable variation in terminology. This article treats a relation as the [[set theory|set-theoretic]] [[extension (semantics)|extension]] of a relational concept or term. A variant usage reserves the term "relation" to the corresponding logical entity, either the [[comprehension (logic)|logical comprehension]], which is the totality of [[intension]]s or abstract properties that all of the elements of the relation in extension have in common, or else the symbols that are taken to denote these elements and intensions. Further, some writers of the latter persuasion introduce terms with more concrete connotations, like "relational structure", for the set-theoretic extension of a given relational concept. ==Ubiquity in mathematics== Many mathematical relations fall into two broad classes, [[equivalence relation]]s and [[Order theory|order relations]]. Equivalence relations are also [[Symmetric relation|symmetric]], while order relations are [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]] or [[asymmetric relation|asymmetric]]. The [[algebraic structure]] of equivalence relations builds on [[transformation group]]s; that of order relations builds on [[lattice theory]]. For more on relations and mathematics, from a philosophical standpoint, see [[John Lucas (philosopher)|Lucas (1999: chpt. 9)]]. == Analogy with functions == Relations generalize [[function (mathematics)|functions]]; just as there is [[composition of functions]], there is [[composition of relations]]. Every relation has a [[inverse relation|transpose relation]], which is related to the [[inverse function]]. ==Examples== This section discusses, by way of example, the [[arithmetic]]al [[binary relation]] of [[divisibility]] and the [[geometry|geometric]] [[triadic relation]] of [[coplanarity]]. ===Divisibility=== A more typical example of a 2-place relation in mathematics is the relation of [[divisor|divisibility]] between two positive integers ''n'' and ''m'' that is expressed in statements like "''n'' divides ''m''" or "''n'' goes into ''m''." This is a relation that comes up so often that a special symbol "|" is reserved to express it, allowing one to write "''n''|''m''" for "''n'' divides ''m''." To express the binary relation of divisibility in terms of sets, we have the set ''P'' of positive integers, ''P'' = {1, 2, 3, …}, and we have the binary relation ''D'' on ''P'' such that the ordered pair (''n'', ''m'') is in the relation ''D'' just in case ''n''|''m''. In other turns of phrase that are frequently used, one says that the number ''n'' is related by ''D'' to the number ''m'' just in case ''n'' is a factor of ''m'', that is, just in case ''n'' divides ''m'' with no remainder. The relation ''D'', regarded as a set of ordered pairs, consists of all pairs of numbers (''n'', ''m'') such that ''n'' divides ''m''. For example, 2 is a factor of 4, and 6 is a factor of 72, which can be written either as 2|4 and 6|72 or as ''D''(2, 4) and ''D''(6, 72). ==Suggested reading== The logician [[Augustus De Morgan]], in work published around 1860, was the first to articulate the notion of relation in anything like its present sense. He also stated the first formal results in the theory of relations (on De Morgan and relations, see Merrill 1990). [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] restated and extended De Morgan's results. [[Bertrand Russell]] (1938; 1st ed. 1903) was historically important, in that it brought together in one place many 19th century results on relations, especially [[order theory|orders]], by Peirce, [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Georg Cantor]], [[Richard Dedekind]], and others. Russell and [[A. N. Whitehead]] made free use of these results in their epochal ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''. For a systematic treatise on the theory of relations see R.
