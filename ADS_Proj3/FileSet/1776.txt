and students quickly discovered that long-forgotten and out-of-print texts could reach new audiences and spark new scholarship. We have often talked about libraries without walls, but now we are even closer to realizing that vision, thanks to this partnership." ::: — [[Karin Wittenborg]], University Librarian, University of Virginia.<ref name="GBLP1"/> ====University of Wisconsin–Madison==== The [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] (and the [[University of Wisconsin Digital Collection]]) is an institutional participant in this project.<ref>[http://www.library.wisc.edu/digitization/ Wisconsin + Google]</ref> :"The combined library collections of the University of Wisconsin–Madison Libraries and the Wisconsin Historical Society Library comprise one of the largest collections of documents and historical materials in the United States. Through this landmark partnership with Google, Wisconsin is taking a leading role in preserving public domain works for future generations and making the Library's resources widely available for education and research. This effort truly exemplifies the vision of The Wisconsin Idea—the notion that the boundaries of the university are limitless. The Wisconsin libraries have been following in this tradition. The Google digitization efforts will enable the libraries to expand access to public domain materials that have heretofore only been accessible in the libraries. Much of this material is rare and one-of-a-kind, providing a rich, open source of information for educational, research and general public use." ::: — [[Edward Van Gemert]], Interim Director, UW–Madison Libraries.<ref name="GBLP1"/> ==See also== *[[Google Books]] (formerly Google Book Search) ==Notes== {{reflist|2}} ==References== {{reflist}} * Lester, June and Wallace C.

In 2005, a Chinese-language interface was developed for the google.com website. In Jan 2006, Google launched its China-based google.cn search page with results subject to censorship by the Chinese government.

It is a 10-floor building located in Tsinghua Science Park, near the south gate of [[Tsinghua University]].
