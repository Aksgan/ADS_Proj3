(actually [[Euler's formula]]) has the following property. If ''L'' is the period of the function then: :<math>L = 2\pi/k </math> == Generalizations == === Antiperiodic functions === One common generalization of periodic functions is that of '''antiperiodic functions'''. This is a function ''f'' such that ''f''(''x'' + ''P'') = &minus;''f''(''x'') for all ''x''. (Thus, a ''P''-antiperiodic function is a 2''P''-periodic function.) === Bloch-periodic functions === A further generalization appears in the context of [[Bloch wave]]s and [[Floquet theory]], which govern the solution of various periodic differential equations. In this context, the solution (in one dimension) is typically a function of the form: :<math>f(x+P) = e^{ikP} f(x) \,\!</math> where ''k'' is a real or complex number (the ''Bloch wavevector'' or ''Floquet exponent''). Functions of this form are sometimes called '''Bloch-periodic''' in this context. A periodic function is the special case ''k'' = 0, and an antiperiodic function is the special case ''k'' = π/''P''. === Quotient spaces as domain === In [[signal processing]] you encounter the problem, that [[Fourier series]] represent periodic functions and that Fourier series satisfy [[convolution theorem]]s (i.e. [[convolution]] of Fourier series corresponds to multiplication of represented periodic function and vice versa), but periodic functions cannot be convolved with the usual definition, since the involved integrals diverge. A possible way out is to define a periodic function on a bounded but periodic domain. To this end you can use the notion of a [[Quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient space]]: :<math>{\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}} = \{x+\mathbb{Z} : x\in\mathbb{R}\} = \{\{y : y\in\mathbb{R}\land y-x\in\mathbb{Z}\} : x\in\mathbb{R}\}</math>. That is, each element in <math>{\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}}</math> is an [[equivalence class]] of [[real number]]s that share the same [[fractional part]]. Thus a function like <math>f : {\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}}\to\mathbb{R}</math> is a representation of a 1-periodic function. ==References== {{Reflist}} ==See also== * [[Periodic sequence]] * [[Almost periodic function]] * [[Amplitude]] * [[Definite pitch]] * [[Doubly periodic function]] * [[Frequency]] * [[Oscillation]] * [[Quasiperiodic function]] * [[Wavelength]] * [[Periodic summation]] ==External links== *[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PeriodicFunction.html Periodic functions at MathWorld] [[Category:Calculus]] [[Category:Elementary mathematics]] [[Category:Fourier analysis]] [[Category:Functions and mappings]] [[Category:Types of functions]] [[ar:دالة دورية]] [[ca:Ona periòdica]] [[cs:Periodická funkce]] [[da:Svingningstid]] [[de:Periodizität (Mathematik)]] [[el:Περιοδική συνάρτηση]] [[es:Onda periódica]] [[eo:Perioda funkcio]] [[fa:تابع متناوب]] [[fr:Fonction périodique]] [[ko:주기함수]] [[it:Funzione periodica]] [[he:פונקציה מחזורית]] [[lv:Periodiska funkcija]] [[ms:Gerakan berkala]] [[nl:Periodieke functie]] [[ja:周期関数]] [[no:Periodisk funksjon]] [[pl:Funkcja okresowa]] [[pt:Função periódica]] [[ru:Периодическая функция]] [[simple:Periodic function]] [[sk:Periodická funkcia]] [[sl:Periodična funkcija]] [[su:Fungsi périodik]] [[fi:Jaksollinen funktio]] [[sv:Periodisk funktion]] [[th:ฟังก์ชันเป็นคาบ]] [[tr:Periyodik Fonksiyon]] [[uk:Періодична функція]] [[ur:معیادی دالہ]] [[zh:周期函数]]</text> </page> <page> <id>28853</id> <title>Perl Shell</title> <text>{{lowercase|title=psh}} {{redirect|PSH}} {{ Infobox Software | name = Perl Shell | latest_release_version = 1.8.1 | latest_release_date = {{release date|2007|07|20}} | operating_system = Various | use = [[UNIX shell]] | license = [[GNU General Public License]] and [[Artistic License]] | website = http://www.focusresearch.com/gregor/sw/psh/ }} The '''Perl Shell''' (psh) is a [[command line interface|command line]] environment that can be used as the user's primary post-login [[Shell (computing)|shell]] on [[Unix-like]] operating systems.

The permanent, as well as the determinant, is a polynomial in the entries of the matrix. Both permanent and determinant are special cases of a more general function of a matrix called the [[immanant]]. == Definition == The permanent of an ''n''-by-''n'' matrix ''A'' = (''a''<sub>''i,j''</sub>) is defined as : <math> \operatorname{perm}(A)=\sum_{\sigma\in S_n}\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,\sigma(i)}.</math> The sum here extends over all elements σ of the [[symmetric group]] ''S''<sub>''n''</sub>, i.e. over all [[permutation]]s of the numbers 1, 2, ..., ''n''. For example (2×2 matrix), :<math>\operatorname{perm}\begin{pmatrix}a&b \\ c&d\end{pmatrix}=ad+bc.</math> The definition of the permanent of ''A'' differs from that of the [[determinant]] of ''A'' in that the [[signature (permutation)|signatures]] of the permutations are not taken into account. If one views the permanent as a map that takes ''n'' vectors as arguments, then it is a [[multilinear map]] and it is symmetric (meaning that any order of the vectors results in the same permanent). A formula similar to [[Expansion by minors|Laplace's]] for the development of a determinant along a row or column is also valid for the permanent; all signs have to be ignored for the permanent. == Properties and applications == Unlike the determinant, the permanent has no easy geometrical interpretation; it is mainly used in [[combinatorics]] and in treating boson [[Green's functions]] in [[quantum field theory]]. However, it has two [[graph-theoretic]] interpretations: as the sum of weights of [[cycle cover]]s of a [[directed graph]], and as the sum of weights of perfect matchings in a [[bipartite graph]]. ===Cycle covers=== Any square matrix <math>A = (a_{ij})</math> can be viewed as the [[adjacency matrix]] of a directed graph, with <math>a_{ij}</math> representing the weight of the edge from vertex ''i'' to vertex ''j''. A [[Vertex cycle cover|cycle cover]] of a weighted directed graph is a collection of vertex-disjoint [[directed cycle]]s in the graph that covers all nodes in the graph. Thus, each vertex ''i'' in the graph has a unique "successor" <math>\sigma(i)</math> in the cycle cover, and <math>\sigma</math> is a [[permutation]] on <math>\{1,2,\dots,n\}</math> where ''n'' is the number of vertices in the graph. Conversely, any permutation <math>\sigma</math> on <math>\{1,2,\dots,n\}</math> corresponds to a cycle
