Observers have said that facts of the case simply do not support the conclusions of the report nor is the report an official report of the committee.<ref name="making_martyr">[http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2006/12/creating_a_martyr_the_sternber.php Creating a Martyr: The Sternberg Saga Continues], Ed Brayton, Dispatches from the Culture Wars, December 19, 2006.</ref> They say that the Discovery Institute is using the report to portray Sternberg specifically, and design proponents in general, as victims of persecution. They also say the Souder report is a repackaging of the Office of Special Council's previous findings from August 2005 and contains nothing new, consisting of "the OSC findings restated and used as a form of evidence in and of themselves" and attacks the Smithsonian for "not accepting the OSC's findings at face value."<ref>[http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/12/the_office_of_s.html#more The Office of Sternberg Coddling] Steve Reuland, [[The Panda's Thumb (blog)|The Panda's Thumb]], December 20, 2006</ref> They cite as evidence of a biased motive behind the report the longstanding connections of the report's instigators, Congressmen Souder and Santorum, to the Discovery Institute, whose Program Director is Stephen C. Meyer, author of the paper Sternberg published. In 2000 Souder co-hosted a congressional briefing on behalf of the Discovery Institute intended to drum up political support for intelligent design and read a defense of intelligent design prepared by the Discovery Institute into the congressional record.<ref name="lame_ducks"/> Santorum worked with the Discovery Institute's program director [[Phillip E. Johnson]] in 2000 and 2001 drafting the pro-intelligent design Santorum Amendment and in March 2006 wrote the foreword for the book, ''Darwin's Nemesis: Phillip Johnson And the Intelligent Design Movement'' a collection of essays largely by Discovery Institute fellows honoring Johnson as "father" of the intelligent design movement. Contained in the appendix to the Souder report is a letter from the director of the Smithsonian where it is revealed that Sternberg demanded that they give him a $300,000 grant to make up for his allegedly lost research time; he was turned down.<ref name="souder_appendix"/> Sternberg's appointment as a Smithsonian Institution research associate was from January 2004 through January 2007. Research associates are not employees of the Museum and appointments are typically awarded for up to three years. As one of the [[Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns]], the Institute conducted extensive lobbying and public relations efforts on Sternberg's behalf, including arranging for articles by Institute Fellows to be published in the mainstream press.<ref>[http://www.evolutionnews.org/2005/02/title_4.html Setting the Record Straight on Sternberg], Evolution News and Views, [[Discovery Institute]], February 6, 2005.</ref><ref>[http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=2399 Sternberg, Smithsonian, Meyer, And The Paper That Started It All], [[Discovery Institute]], October 19, 2005.</ref><ref>[http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/12/the_house_government_reform_su.html Smithsonian Scientist Was Demoted for Views Critical of Darwinian Evolution], Evolution News and Views, [[Discovery Institute]], December 15, 2006.</ref><ref>[http://www.evolutionnews.org/2005/08/breaking_news_on_sternberg_discriminatio.html Breaking News on Sternberg Discrimination], Evolution News and Views, [[Discovery Institute]], August 16, 2005.</ref> A film released in April 2008 featuring [[Ben Stein]], ''[[Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed]]'', discusses the Sternberg controversy, but, according to ''[[Scientific American]]'', misrepresents several key facts.<ref name=sciam/> ==Notes and references== {{reflist|2}} == External links == *[http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=2177&program=CSC&callingPage=discoMainPage ''The origin of biological information and the higher taxonomic categories''], Meyer's paper that started the controversy *[http://www.rsternberg.net/ Sternberg's home page] presenting his allegations concerning the controversy *[http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/02/sternberg_vs_sm.html#c14871 Comments from Sternberg's Smithsonian supervisor, Jonathan Coddington] in response to the ''Wall Street Journal'' editorial, from Panda's Thumb {{DEFAULTSORT:Sternberg Peer Review Controversy}} [[Category:Intelligent design controversies]] [[Category:Discovery Institute campaigns]] [[Category:Smithsonian Institution]] [[Category:Peer review]]</text> </page> <page> <id>35757</id> <title>Steve Gibson (computer programmer)</title> <text>{{for|other people named Steve Gibson|Steve Gibson (disambiguation)}} {{Infobox Person | name = Steve Gibson | image = SteveG.jpg | caption = Steve in between shots on [[Leo Laporte]]'s [[Call For Help]] in [[Toronto]] April, 2007. | birth_name = | birth_date = {{Birth date and age|1955|03|26}} | birth_place = [[Dayton, Ohio]], [[United States]] | death_date = | death_place = | death_cause = | resting_place = | resting_place_coordinates = | residence = [[Laguna Hills, California]] <br /> [[USA]] | nationality = [[United States|American]] | other_names = | known_for = [[Security Now!]] [[podcast]] on [[TWiT.tv (network)]] | education = [[University of California, Berkeley]] | employer = | occupation = [[Software Engineer]] and <br />Security Analyst | title = [[Computer Programmer]] | salary = | networth = | height = | weight = | term = | predecessor = | successor = | party = | boards = | religion = | spouse = | partner = | children = | parents = | relatives = | signature = | website = [http://www.grc.com/ GRC.com] | footnotes = }} '''Steve Gibson''' (born March 26, 1955, [[Dayton, Ohio]]) is a computer enthusiast, [[software engineer]] and security researcher who studied [[Electrical Engineering and Computer Science]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].
