filtering]]. ==="Pop-ups"=== *Certain types of downloaded content, such as images, free music, and others, can cause pop ups, especially pornographic sites' pop ups. Also, the pop ups will sometimes look like ordinary web pages, and the name of the site will show up in a search bar. Many websites use pop-ups to display information without disrupting the page currently open. For example, if you were to fill in a [[webform|form]] on a web page and needed extra guidance, a pop-up would give you extra information without causing loss of any information already entered into the form. Most pop-up blockers will allow this kind of pop-up. However, some will reload the page, causing loss of any information that had been entered. *Some web based installers, such as that used by [[McAfee]], use a pop-up to install software. *On many internet browsers, holding down the [[ctrl]] key while clicking a link will allow it to bypass the popup filter. *Clicking (even accidentally) on one pop-up may lead to other pop-up ads opening. ===Circumventing pop-up blocker=== A combination of a banner ad and a popup window is the "[[hover ad]]", which uses [[DHTML]] to appear in front of the browser screen. With the use of JavaScript, an advertisement can be superimposed over a webpage in a transparent layer. This advertisement can appear as almost anything the author of the advertisement wants. For example, an advertisement can contain an [[Adobe Flash]] animation linking to the advertiser's site. An advertisement can also look like a regular [[window (computing)|window]]. Because the advertisement is a part of the web page, it cannot be blocked with a pop-up blocker, but it can be blocked with third-party ad blockers such as [[Adblock Plus|Adblock]] or by using custom [[Cascading Style Sheets|style sheets]]. DHTML ads can be very [[Central processing unit|CPU]] intensive, sometimes bogging down older computers to the point of unusability. ==Pop-under ads== Pop-under ads are similar to pop-up ads, but the ad window appears hidden behind the main browser window rather than superimposed in front of it. As pop-up ads became widespread, many users learned to immediately close the popup ads that appeared over a site without looking at them. Pop-under ads do not immediately impede a user's ability to view the site content, and thus usually remain unnoticed until the main browser window is closed, leaving the user's attention free for the advertisement. Although the pop-under ad is ubiquitous with annoying methodologies it still is used by major publishers such as [[CNN|CNN.com]] and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. ==Pop-under ad technology== A pop-under ad involves two very simple JavaScript technologies introduced in 1997 with the Netscape 2.0B3 browser. This methodology has been used widely across the web. Modern web publishers and advertisers utilize this methodology to create a window in front of the users screen, load an advertisement, and then send it behind the screen. <source lang="javascript"> // create a new window in front of the current site window.open( URL, windowName[, windowFeatures] ); // push the loaded advertisment back behind the browser window.focus(); </source> ==Pop-up dismissal== Users of websites and web applications continuously experience unwanted pop up ads through the course of their normal interaction with a web browser. Ordinarily users respond by dismissing the pop-up through the "close" or "cancel" feature of the window hosting the pop-up. Because this is a typical response, some authors of pop-up advertising depend on this, and create on-screen buttons or controls that look similar to a "close" or "cancel" option. When the user chooses one of these "simulated cancel" options, however, the button performs an unexpected or unauthorized action (such as opening a ''new'' pop-up, or running unauthorized commands on the user's system).<ref name="Smart Computing Article - Pop-ups">[http://www.smartcomputing.com/Editorial/article.asp?article=articles/WebOnly/TechSupport/441w10/41w01.asp&guid= Smart Computing Article - Pop-ups<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Because the technologies for web development and design allow an author to draw any kind of "simulated" cancel option imaginable, some users refuse to click on or interact with any item inside a pop-up window whatsoever.<ref name="Smart Computing Article - Pop-ups"/> ==Patent Controversy== ExitExchange.com filed for a patent in [[2000]] on a subset of pop-under advertising called an exit pop. Exit pops were first introduced by the ExitExchange corporation in 1999; when a visitor leaves a website, they receive another site or ad. After years of controversy and numerous articles on the pop-under patent, the patent was awarded by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) in April and June of [[2008]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The respective patent numbers are 7,386,555 and 7,353,229. Patent 7,386,555 is related to the method of opening an exit pop from a [[toolbar]] or software application on a computing device, whereas Patent 7,353,229 covers the method used to open an exit pop from an embedded script found within a media file (e.g. JavaScript code found in a web page). ==See also== *[[Ad filtering]] *[[Ad serving]] *[[Adware]] and [[Spyware]] *[[Malware]] *[[Direct marketing|Junkmail]] *[[Interstitial webpage]] *[[1-800_Contacts,_Inc._v._WhenU.com,_Inc. | Lawsuit between]] [[1-800 Contacts]] and [[WhenU_SaveNow]] over pop-up ad placement *[[Messaging spam]] *[[List of pop-up blocking software]] *[[In-session phishing]] ==Notes== *Adams, Cecil.
