It corrects image distortion by transforming the image into a standard coordinate system. *It is used in [[computer stereo vision]] to simplify the problem of finding matching points between images. *It is used in [[geographic information system]]s to merge images taken from multiple perspectives into a common map coordinate system. == Computer stereo vision == [[Image:Image rectification.png|the search space before (1) and after (2) rectification|thumb|300px|right]] [[Stereo vision]] uses triangulation based on [[epipolar geometry]] to determine distance to an object. Between two cameras there is a problem of finding a corresponding point viewed by one camera in the image of the other camera (known as the [[correspondence problem]]). In most camera configurations, finding correspondences requires a search in two-dimensions. However, if the two cameras are aligned to be [[coplanar]], the search is simplified to one dimension - a horizontal line parallel to the [[baseline]] between the cameras. Furthermore, if the location of a point in the left image is known, it can be searched for in the right image by searching left of this location along the line, and vice versa (see [[binocular disparity]]). Image rectification is an equivalent (and more often used<ref name="ORAM2001" />) alternative to perfect camera alignment. Image rectification is usually performed regardless of camera precision due to * impracticality or impossibility of perfectly aligning cameras * perfectly aligned cameras may become misaligned over time === Transformation === If the images to be rectified are taken from camera pairs without geometric [[Distortion (optics)|distortion]], this calculation can easily be made with a [[linear transformation]]. X & Y rotation puts the images on the same plane, scaling makes the image frames be the same size and Z rotation & skew adjustments make the image pixel rows directly line up{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. The rigid alignment of the cameras needs to be known (by calibration) and the calibration coefficients are used by the transform<ref name="FUSIELLO2000" />. In performing the transform, if the cameras themselves are calibrated for internal parameters, an [[essential matrix]] provides the relationship between the cameras. The more general case (without camera calibration) is represented by the [[fundamental matrix (computer vision)|fundamental matrix]]. If the fundamental matrix is not known, it is necessary to find preliminary point correspondences between stereo images to facilitate its extraction<ref name="FUSIELLO2000" />. Stereo images can also be taken with a single camera in motion. In this case the relationship of the images can have significant forward-motion components, and a linear transformation may produce severely warped images or very large images. Non-linear transformation techniques can be used to manage this difficulty<ref name="POLLEFEYS1999" /><ref name="ORAM2001" /><ref name="LIM2004" />. === Algorithms === For examples, see <ref name="LIM2004" /> and <ref name="FUSIELLO2000_2" /><ref name="POLLEFEYS1999" />. == Geographic information system == Image rectification in [[Geographic information system#Raster-to-vector translation|GIS]] converts images to a standard map coordinate system. This is done by matching ground control points (GCP) in the mapping system to points in the image. These GCPs calculate necessary image transforms<ref name="FOGEL2008" />. Primary difficulties in the process occur *when the accuracy of the map points are not well known *when the images lack clearly identifiable points to correspond to the maps. The maps that are used with rectified images are non-topographical. However, the images to be used may contain distortion from terrain. Image orthorectification additionally removes these effects<ref name="FOGEL2008" />. Image rectification is a standard feature available with commercial GIS software packages. ==See also== *[[Binocular disparity]] *[[Correspondence problem]] *[[Epipolar geometry]]
