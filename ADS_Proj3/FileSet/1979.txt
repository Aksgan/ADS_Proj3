If the edges of a graph are thought of as lines drawn from one vertex to another (as they are usually depicted in illustrations), then two graphs are homeomorphic to each other in the graph-theoretic sense precisely if they are [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] in the sense in which the term is used in [[topology]]. ==Subdivisions== In general, a '''subdivision''' of a graph ''G'' is a graph resulting from the subdivision of edges in ''G''. The subdivision of some edge ''e'' with endpoints {''u'',''v''} yields a graph containing one new vertex ''w'', and with an edge set replacing ''e'' by two new edges, {''u'',''w''} and {''w'',''v''}. For example, the edge ''e'', with endpoints {''u'',''v''}: {| class="wikitable" |[[Image:Graph subdivision step1.svg|150px]] |} can be subdivided into two edges, ''e''<sub>1</sub> and ''e''<sub>2</sub>, connecting to a new vertex ''w'': {| class="wikitable" |[[Image:Graph subdivision step2.svg|150px]] |} The reverse operation, '''smoothing out''' or '''smoothing''' a vertex ''w'' with regards to the pair of edges (''e'',''f'') incident on ''w'', removes both edges containing ''w'' and replaces (''e'',''f'') with a new edge that connects the other endpoints of the pair. Here it is emphasized that only 2-valent vertices can be smoothed. For example, the simple [[Connectivity (graph theory)|connected]] graph with two edges, ''e''<sub>1</sub> {''u'',''w''} and ''e''<sub>2</sub> {''w'',''v''}: {| class="wikitable" |[[Image:Graph subdivision step2.svg|150px]] |} has a vertex (namely ''w'') that can be smoothed away, resulting in:: {| class="wikitable" |[[Image:Graph subdivision step1.svg|150px]] |} Determining whether for graphs ''G'' and ''H'', ''H'' is homeomorphic to a subgraph of ''G'', is an [[NP-complete]] problem. ===Barycentric Subdivisions=== The [[barycentric subdivision]] subdivides each edge of the graph. This is a special subdivision, as it always results in a [[bipartite graph]]. This procedure can be repeated, so that the ''n''<sup>th</sup> barycentric subdivision is the barycentric subdivision of the ''n-1''<sup>th</sup> barycentric subdivision of the graph. The second such subdivision is always a [[simple graph]]. ==Embedding on a surface== It is evident that subdividing a graph preserves planarity. [[Kuratowski's theorem]] states that : a [[finite graph]] is [[planar graph|planar]] [[if and only if]] it contains no [[subgraph]] '''homeomorphic''' to ''K''<sub>5</sub> ([[complete graph]] on five [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]]) or ''K''<sub>3,3</sub> ([[complete bipartite graph]] on six vertices, three of which connect to each of the other three). In fact, a graph homeomorphic to ''K''<sub>5</sub> or ''K''<sub>3,3</sub> is called a [[Kuratowski's theorem|Kuratowski subgraph]]. A generalization, flowing from the [[Robertson–Seymour theorem]], asserts that for each integer ''g'', there is a finite '''obstruction set''' of graphs <math>L(g) = \{G_{i}^{(g)}\}</math> such that a graph ''H'' is embeddable on a surface of [[Genus (mathematics)|genus]] ''g'' if and only if ''H'' contains no homeomorphic copy of any of the <math>G_{i}^{(g)}</math>. For example, <math>L(0) = \{K_{5}, K_{3,3}\}</math> contains the Kuratowski subgraphs. ==Example== In the following example, graph G and graph H are homeomorphic. G [[Image:Graph homeomorphism example 1.svg|150px|graph H]] H [[Image:Graph homeomorphism example 2.svg|150px|graph G]] If G' is the graph created by subdivision of the outer edges of G and H' is the graph created by subdivision of the inner edge of H, then G' and H' have a similar graph drawing:
