In 2005, Blumenthal authored “Implementing Enterprise Architecture at the United States Secret Service,”[1] a case study in User-Centric Enterprise Architecture, a methodology he founded. In 2008, he expanded on the approach in “An Introduction to User-centric Enterprise Architecture” [2]. “User-Centric EA” treats enterprise architecture as a business tool for executive decision-making. In 2009, Blumenthal created the CIO Support Services Framework and described this framework in a two-part article, “How to Strengthen the Office of the CIO.” [3] The approach integrates six major components required by CIOs to manage the IT function. He lectures at [http://www.heinz.cmu.edu/index.aspx Carnegie Mellon University CIO Institute] and the [http://www.ndu.edu/irmc/ National Defense University Information Resources Management College]. Blumenthal was interviewed about the role of the CTO by [http://www.federalnewsradio.com/?nid=19&sid=1597862 Federal News Radio] in 2009. ==Selected Bibliography == * [http://totalcio.blogspot.com Andy Blumenthal's Blog, The Total CIO] * [http://www.information-management.com/infodirect/2008_70/10001224-1.html "An Introduction to User-Centric Enterprise Architecture"] * [http://www.govtech.com/gt/707997 "How To Strengthen the Office of the CIO" -

[[Naughty Dog]]'s games (most famously, [[Crash Bandicoot]]) are known for their combination of exceptional technology, great graphics, and polished gameplay.<ref>http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.05/deathmatch.html?pg=2</ref> The sophistication of [[Naughty Dog]] technology is often credited to Gavin's background in [[LISP]] at the [[MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]].<ref>http://www.franz.com/success/customer_apps/animation_graphics/naughtydog.lhtml</ref> ==Education== Gavin studied for his Ph.D. at M.I.T. where he did research for the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] on the Mars Rover Vision Project, under his advisor [[Rod Brooks]]. While still a student, Gavin learned the computer programming language [[LISP]]. Influences from M.I.T. and his own work lead him to develop a number of custom programming languages that improved the quality of graphics, controls, sounds and artificial intelligence in [[Naughty Dog]] video games. He also has a B.S. from [[Haverford College]] in Neuro Biological Science.<ref>http://www.gamasutra.com/features/19991112/GavinWhite_03.htm</ref> ==Career== Together, Gavin and Rubin sold their first video game called Math Jam in 1985. A few games later they sold Keef the Thief [http://www.mobygames.com/game/keef-the-thief-a-boy-and-his-lockpick] in 1989 to [[Electronic Arts]]. In
