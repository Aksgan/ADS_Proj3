With MMTel, users have the capability to add and drop media during a session. You can start with chat, add voice (for instance Mobile [[VoIP]]), add another caller, add video, share media and transfer files, and drop any of these without losing or having to end the session. The MMTel standard is a joint project between the [[3GPP]] and [[ETSI]]/[[TISPAN]] standardization bodies. The MMTel standard is today the only global standard that defines an evolved telephony service that enables real-time multimedia communication with the characteristics of a telephony service over both fixed broadband, fixed narrowband and mobile access types. MMTel also provides a standardized [[Network-to-Network Interface]] (NNI). This allow operators to interconnect their networks which in turn enables users belonging to different operators to communicate with each other, using the full set of media capabilities and supplementary services defined within the MMTel service definition. One of the main differences with the MMTel standard is that, in contrast of legacy circuit switched telephony services, IP transport is used over the mobile access. This means that the mobile access technologies that are in main focus for MMTel are access types such as [[High Speed Packet Access]] (HSPA), [[3GPP Long Term Evolution]] (LTE) and [[EDGE Evolution]] that all are developed with efficient IP transport in mind. MMTel allows a single SIP session to control virtually all MMTel supplementary services and MMTel media. All available media components can easily be accessed or activated within the session. Employing a single session for all media parts means that no additional sessions need to be set up to activate video, to add new users, or to start transferring a file. Even though it is possible to manage single-session user scenarios with several sessions – for instance, using a [[circuit-switched]] voice service that is complemented with a [[packet-switched]] video session, a messaging service or both – there are some concrete benefits to MMTel’s single-session approach. A single SIP session in an all-IP environment benefits conferencing; in particular, lip synchronization, which is quite complex when the voice part is carried over a circuit-switched service and the video part is carried over a packet-switched service. In fixed-mobile convergence scenarios, the single-session approach enables all media parts of the multimedia communication solution to interoperate. ==References== * [http://www.mmtelforum.com MMTel Forum] MMTel Forum is created to support this standard and involve MMTel ecosystem member companies * [http://www.ericsson.com/res/thecompany/docs/whitepapers/MMTel-multimedia-services.pdf] MMTel – a standard for multimedia services over IMS, Ericsson White Paper, July 2008 * [http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/22173.htm 3GPP Stage 1 (requirements)] * [http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/24173.htm Stage 3 (protocol)] * [http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/26114.htm Media handling and interactions] * [http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/32275.htm Charging] * [http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/34229-1.htm UE conformance test specifications] (protocol conformance) * [http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/34229-2.htm UE conformance test specifications] (Implementation Conformance Statement) * [http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/34229-3.htm UE conformance test specifications] (TTCN Test Suite) [[Category:IMS services]] [[Category:Multimedia]] [[Category:Network architecture]] [[Category:VoIP terminology & concepts]] [[Category:Mobile telecommunications standards]] [[Category:Technical terminology|*Technical terminology]] [[Category:Telecommunications infrastructure]]</text> </page> <page> <id>25341</id> <title>Multinomial theorem</title> <text>In [[mathematics]], the '''multinomial theorem''' says how to write a [[power (mathematics)|power]] of a sum in terms of powers of the terms in that sum. It is the generalization of the [[binomial theorem]] to polynomials. ==Theorem== For any positive integer ''m'' and any nonnegative integer ''n'', the multinomial formula tells us how a polynomial expands when raised to an arbitrary power: :<math>(x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_m)^n = \sum_{k_1+k_2+\cdots+k_m=n} {n \choose k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_m} \prod_{1\le t\le m}x_{t}^{k_{t}}\,.</math> The summation is taken over all sequences of nonnegative integer indices ''k''<sub>1</sub> through ''k''<sub>m</sub> such the sum of all ''k''<sub>i</sub> is ''n''. That is, for each term in the expansion, the exponents must add up to ''n''. Also, as with the [[binomial theorem]], quantities of the form ''x''<sup>0</sup> that appear are taken to equal 1 (even when ''x'' equals zero). Alternatively, this can be written concisely using [[multiindices]] as :<math>(x_1+\cdots+x_m)^n = \sum_{|\alpha|=n}{n \choose \alpha}x^\alpha</math> where α = (α<sub>1</sub>,α<sub>2</sub>,…,α<sub>m</sub>) and x<sup>α</sup> = ''x''<sub>1</sub><sup>α<sub>1</sub></sup>''x''<sub>2</sub><sup>α<sub>2</sub></sup>⋯''x''<sub>''m''</sub><sup>α<sub>''m''</sub></sup>. ====Number of multinomial coefficients==== The number of terms in multinomial sum, #<sub>''n'',''m''</sub>, is equal to the number of monomials of degree ''n'' on the variables ''x''<sub>1</sub>, …, ''x''<sub>''m''</sub>: :<math> \#_{n,m} = {n+m-1 \choose m-1} = {n+m-1 \choose n}\,. </math> ===Multinomial coefficients=== The numbers :<math> {n \choose k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_m} = \frac{n!}{k_1!\, k_2! \cdots k_m!}</math> (which can also be written as:) :<math> = {k_1\choose k_1}{k_1+k_2\choose k_2}\cdots{k_1+k_2+\cdots+k_m\choose k_m} = \prod_{i=1}^m {\sum_{j=1}^i k_j \choose k_i}</math> are the '''multinomial coefficients'''. Just like "n choose k" are the coefficients when you raise a ''binomial'' to the ''n''<sup>th</sup> power (e.g. the coefficients are 1,3,3,1 for (''a'' + ''b'')<sup>3</sup>, where ''n'' = 3), the multinomial coefficients appear when
