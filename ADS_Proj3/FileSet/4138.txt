They are seen on Earth because of a fortuitous combination of circumstances. Even on Earth, eclipses of the type familiar to people today are a temporary (on a geological time scale) phenomenon. Many millions of years in the past, the Moon was too close to the Earth to precisely occlude the Sun as it does during eclipses today; and many millions of years in the future, it will be too far away to do so. Due to [[tidal acceleration]], the orbit of the Moon around the Earth becomes approximately 3.8 cm more distant each year. It is estimated that in 600 million years, the distance from the Earth to the Moon will have increased by 23,500 km, meaning that it will no longer be able to completely cover the Sun's disk. This will be true even when the Moon is at [[perigee]], and the Earth at [[aphelion]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/images/peri_apo/ |title=Moon near Perigee, Earth near Aphelion |publisher=Fourmilab.ch |date= |accessdate=2010-03-07}}</ref> A complicating factor is that the Sun will increase in size over this timescale. This makes it even more unlikely that the Moon will be able to cause a total eclipse. Therefore, the last total solar eclipse on Earth will occur in slightly less than 600 million years. ==Historical eclipses== [[Image:Antoine Caron Astronomers Studying an Eclipse.jpg|thumb|''Astronomers Studying an Eclipse'' painted by [[Antoine Caron]] in 1571]] Historical eclipses are a very valuable resource for historians, in that they allow a few historical events to be dated precisely, from which other dates and a society's calendar may be deduced. [[Aryabhata]] (476–550) concluded the [[Heliocentric theory]] in solar eclipse. A solar eclipse of June 15, 763 BC mentioned in an [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] text is important for the [[Chronology of the Ancient Orient]]. Also known as the [[eclipse of Bur Sagale]], it is the earliest solar eclipse mentioned in historical sources that has been identified successfully. Perhaps the earliest still-unproven claim is that of archaeologist Bruce Masse asserting on the basis of several ancient [[flood (mythology)|flood myths]], which mention a total solar eclipse, he links an eclipse that occurred May 10, 2807 BC with a possible [[impact event|meteor impact]] in the [[Indian Ocean]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Blakeslee |first=Sandra |title=Ancient Crash, Epic Wave |publisher=New York Times |date=2006-11-14 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/14/science/14WAVE.html |accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref> There have been other claims to date earlier eclipses, notably [[Mursili's eclipse|that]] of [[Mursili II]] (likely 1312 BC), in [[Babylonia]], and also in China, during the Fifth Year (2084 BC) of the regime of Emperor [[Zhong Kang of Xia]] dynasty, but these are highly disputed and rely on much supposition.<ref>{{Cite web|author=F.

Soldiers on both sides put down their weapons and declared peace as a result of the eclipse. Exactly which eclipse was involved has remained uncertain, although the issue has been studied by hundreds of ancient and modern authorities. One likely candidate took place on May 28, 585 BC, probably near the [[Halys River|Halys]] river in the middle of modern [[Turkey]].<ref>{{Cite web|author=D.

In the Indian epic the [[Mahabharata]] the incident is related of the thirteenth day when Arjun vows to slay Jayadrath before nightfall, to avenge the death of Abhimanyu at Jayadratha's hands. What may only be described as a solar eclipse brought Jayadrath out to celebrate his surviving the day, only to have the sun reappear and Arjun killed Jayadrath. In the epic astronomers have calculated all possible eclipse pairs matching the above time difference and being visible from [[Kurukshetra]], the battlefield of the [[Mahabharata]] war. 3129 BC and 2559 BC appear to be the best candidate for the Mahabharata war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tri-murti.com/ancientindia/datingMahabharat.html |title=History of India — Dating of Mahabharata : Facets of India : Ancient and Modern : History of India and World |publisher=Tri-murti.com |date=1959-03-27 |accessdate=2010-03-07}}</ref> Attempts have been made to establish the exact date of [[Good Friday]] by means of solar eclipses, but this research has not yielded conclusive results.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=C.
