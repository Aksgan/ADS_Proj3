AuthIP is supported in [[Windows Vista]] and later on the client and [[Windows Server 2008]] and later on the server. AuthIP adds a second authentication to the standard IKE authentication which, according to Microsoft, increases security and deployability of [[IPsec]] [[VPN]]s. AuthIP adds support for user-based authentication by using Kerberos v5 or SSL certificates. AuthIP is not compatible with [[IKEv2]], an [[IETF]] standard with similar characteristics; however [[Windows 7]] and [[Windows Server 2008 R2]] also support IKEv2. == See also == * [[Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol|SSTP]] == External links == * [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb878097.aspx AuthIP in Windows Vista] - The Cable Guy column at the Microsoft website * [http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/issues/2007/10/CableGuy/default.aspx The Authenticated Internet Protocol] - The Cable Guy column at the Microsoft website [[Category:Cryptographic protocols]] [[Category:Windows Server]]</text> </page> <page> <id>2794</id> <title>Authentication Open Service Interface Definition</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}} {{Orphan|date=December 2009}} <!-- Commented out: [[Image:Oki-logo.png|right]] --> The '''Authentication''' [[Open Service Interface Definition]] ('''OSID''') is an [[O.K.I.]] [[specification]] which supports invoking an [[authentication]] process. '''OSIDs''' are programmatic interfaces which comprise a [[Service Oriented Architecture]] for designing and building [[software reusability|reusable]] and [[interoperable]] [[software]]. The implementation of this service is responsible for gathering whatever information is appropriate to perform authentication. This service also supports testing if a user is authenticated, returning the [[Agent OSID|Agent]] identity that corresponds to the authenticated user. The '''OSIDs''' can interact with information and resources over which some form of access control is required. Authentication, [[Agent OSID|Agent]], and [[Authorization OSID|Authorization]] work together where '''Authentication''' ensures interactions are at the request of an identified user and Authorization reports what the identified user can do. ==See also== *[[Open Service Interface Definitions]] *[[Open Knowledge Initiative]] ==Known Authentication OSID Providers== * [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos Authentication System]] * [[Password]] * [[X.509]] [[Category:Software architecture]]</text> </page> <page> <id>2798</id> <title>Author Domain Signing Practices</title> <text>In [[computing]], '''Author Domain Signing Practices''' ('''ADSP''') is an optional extension to the [[DKIM]] E-mail authentication scheme, <!-- formerly [[DomainKeys]] --> whereby a domain can publish the signing practices it adopts when relaying mail on behalf of associated authors. ADSP was adopted as a standards track RFC 5617 in August 2009. == Concepts == ===Author address=== The ''author address'' is the one defined in the <tt>From</tt> header field defined in RFC 5322. In the unusual cases where more than one address is defined in that field, RFC 5322 provides for a <tt>Sender</tt> field to be used instead. The domains in 5322-''From'' addresses are not necessarily the same as in the more elaborated ''Purported Responsible Address'' covered by [[Sender ID]] specified in RFC 4407. The domain in a 5322-''From'' address is also not necessarily the same as in the ''[[envelope sender]]'' address defined in RFC 5321, also known as [[SMTP]] MAIL FROM, envelope-''From'', 5321-''From'', or <tt>Return-Path</tt>, optionally protected by [[Sender Policy Framework|SPF]] specified in RFC 4408. ===Author Domain Signature=== An ''Author Domain Signature'', is a valid DKIM signature in which the domain name of the DKIM signing entity, i.e., the '''d''' tag in the ''DKIM-Signature'' header field, is the same as the domain name in the '''author address'''. This binding recognizes a higher value for author domain signatures than other valid signatures that may happen to be found in a message. In facts, it proves that the entity that controls the DNS zone for the author —an hence also the destination of replies to the message's author— has '''relayed''' the author's message. Most likely, the author has submitted the message through the proper [[message submission agent]]. Such message qualification can be verified independently of any published domain signing practice. ===Author Domain Signing Practices=== The '''practices''' consists in a [[Domain Name System|DNS]] record published by the author domain. For an author address <tt>john.doe@example.com</tt>, it may be set as _adsp._domainkey.example.com IN TXT "dkim=unknown" Three possible signing practices are provided for: * '''unknown''', which is the same as not defining any record, says the domain might sign some, most, or all email, * '''all''' says all mail from the domain is signed with an Author Domain Signature, * '''discardable''' says all mail from the domain is signed with an Author Domain Signature; furthermore, if such signature is missing or invalid, the receiving server is expected to drop the message<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mipassoc.org/pipermail/ietf-dkim/2008q1/009557.html |title=discardable means discardable |author=[[John Levine]] |date=Sat Feb 23 17:44:49 PST 2008 |work=IETF DKIM Discussion List |publisher=mipassoc |accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref>. ==Caveat== The ADSP specification explicitly discourages publishing a record different from "unknown" for domains who have independent users and a usage policy that does not explicitly restrict them to sending mail only from designated mail servers, since mail sent independently of the organization will not be signed.<ref>[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5617#appendix-B.5 rfc5617#appendix-B.5]</ref>. However explicitly that caveat is worded, it is not straightforward to understand
