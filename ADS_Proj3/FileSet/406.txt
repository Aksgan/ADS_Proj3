It was for the sake of this freedom that he asserted the impotence of physical [[causality]] over human beings, that he analysed the place of nothingness within consciousness and showed how it intervened between the forces that act upon us and our actions.''<ref name=levy>{{cite book| pages=111| first=Neil| last=Levy| title=Sartre| publisher=One World Publications| year=2002}}</ref>}} ==Analysis== While a prisoner of war in 1940/1941 Sartre read [[Martin Heidegger]]'s ''[[Being and Time]]'', an [[ontology|ontological]] investigation through the lens and method of [[Edmund Husserl|Husserlian]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] (Husserl was Heidegger's teacher). Reading ''Being and Time'' initiated Sartre's own enquiry leading to the publication in 1943 of ''Being and Nothingness'' whose subtitle is 'A Phenomenological Essay on Ontology'. Sartre's essay is clearly influenced by Heidegger though Sartre was profoundly skeptical of any measure by which humanity could achieve a kind of personal state of fulfillment comparable to the hypothetical Heideggerian re-encounter with Being. In his much gloomier account in ''Being and Nothingness'', man is a creature haunted by a vision of "completion," what Sartre calls the [[List of Latin phrases: E|''ens causa sui'']], and which religions identify as God. Born into the material reality of one's body, in an all-too-material universe, one finds oneself inserted into being (with a lower case "b"). Consciousness is in a state of cohabitation with its material body, but has no objective reality; it is nothing ("no thing"). Consciousness has the ability to conceptualize possibilities, and to make them appear, or to annihilate them. ==Introduction== In the introduction, Sartre sketches his own theory of consciousness, being and phenomena through criticism of both earlier phenomenologists (most notably [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]) as well as [[idealism|idealists]], [[rationalism|rationalists]] and [[empiricism|empiricists]]. According to him one of the major achievements of modern philosophy has been to free us of the kinds of dualism that set the existent up as having a "hidden" nature as with [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s [[noumenon]]; Phenomenology has removed "the illusion of worlds behind the scene."<ref>Being and Nothingness, p. 2.</ref> Based on an examination of the nature of phenomena, he describes the nature of two aspects of being, being-in-itself and being-for-itself. While being-in-itself is something that can only be approximated, a sort of being that can only be imagined as itself if it is imagined without a witnessing consciousness, being-for-itself is the being of consciousness. ==Part 1, Chapter 1: The origin of negation== When we go about the world, we have expectations which are often not fulfilled. For example, Pierre is not at the café where we thought we would meet him, so there is a ''negation'', a void, a nothingness, in the place of Pierre. When looking for Pierre his lack of being there becomes a negation; everything he sees as he searches the people and objects about him are "not Pierre."<ref>''L'Être et le néant'', p. 45; Barnes, p. 9</ref> So Sartre claims "It is evident that non-being always appears within the limits of a human expectation." <ref>''L'Être et le néant'', p. 41; Barnes, p. 7</ref> ==Part 1, Chapter 2: Bad faith== [[Bad faith (existentialism)|Bad faith]] or "Self-Deception", as translations vary, can be understood as the guise of existing as a character, individual or person who defines himself through the social categorization of his formal identity. This essentially means that in being a waiter, grocer, etc. one must believe that his or her social role is equivalent to his or her human existence. Living a life defined by one's occupation, social, racial or economic class, is the very faith of "bad faith", the condition in which people cannot transcend their situations in order to realize what they must be (human) and what they are not (a grocer, etc.). It is also essential for an existent to understand that negation allows the self to enter what Sartre calls the "great human stream". The great human stream arises from a singular realization that nothingness is a state of mind in which we can become anything, in reference to our situation, that we desire. The possibility of playing is afforded by time and situation. It isn't difficult to see how Sartre's ideas are linked to post-modernist/structural claims offered by [[Michel Foucault]]. However, the theories differ vastly with regard to human identity. In any light, the difference in existence and identity projection remains at the heart of human subjects who are swept up by their own condition, their "bad faith." One of the most widely discussed examples of projection (via [[Freud]]'s conception of the human mind) that Sartre uses is the café waiter who performs the duties, traditions, functions and expectations of a cafe waiter. :"[W]hat ''are we'' then if we have the constant obligation to make ourselves what ''we are'' if our mode of being is having the obligation to be what we are? Let us consider this waiter in the cafe. His movement is quick
