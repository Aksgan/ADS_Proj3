An associate system observes the same data about the state of the world as the human operator, combining the information together to reach more abstract and aggregate conclusions about the state of the world. An associate system also observes the actions undertaken by a human operator, combining those actions with the state of the world to determine the operator’s current objectives and activities.<ref>Geddes, N.D., (1997) Associate Systems: A framework for human-machine cooperation, in Smith, M.

An associate system acts as a teammate to a human operator; it can act without explicitly being ordered while remaining within the bounds of its authority, without taking final control away from the human operator.<ref>Smith, P.J., Geddes, N.D. and Beatty, R.

It was a [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) submission by [[Adobe Systems]], [[IBM]], [[Netscape]], and [[Sun Microsystems]], that was not adopted as a [[W3C recommendation|recommendation]]. PGML and [[Vector Markup Language]], another XML-based vector graphics language W3C submission supported by [[Autodesk]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Macromedia]], [[Microsoft]], and [[Visio Corporation]], were later joined and improved upon to create [[Scalable Vector Graphics]] (SVG). ==Applications== The [[ArgoUML]] [[Computer-aided_software_engineering|CASE]] tool is able to export [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] diagrams in PGML. ==See also== *[[List of vector graphics markup languages]] ==External links== *[http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-PGML-19980410 W3C 1998 Note] {{Graphics file formats}} {{W3C standards}} [[Category:Graphics file formats]] [[Category:Markup languages]] [[Category:Vector graphics markup languages]] [[Category:XML-based standards]] [[de:Precision Graphics Markup Language]] [[fr:Precision Graphics Markup Language]] [[it:Precision Graphics Markup Language]] [[ru:PGML]]</text> </page> <page> <id>29818</id> <title>Predicate (grammar)</title> <text>{{grammar series}} In [[traditional grammar]], a '''predicate''' is one of the two main parts of a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], the other being the [[subject (grammar)|subject]]. The predicate is said to ''modify'' the subject. For the simple sentence "John is yellow" ''John'' acts as the subject, and ''is yellow'' acts as the predicate. The predicate is much like a [[verb phrase]]. In many current theories of [[semantics|linguistic semantics]] (notably [[truth-conditional semantics]]), a predicate is an expression that can be ''true of'' something. Thus, the expressions "is yellow" or "is like broccoli" are true of those things that are yellow or like broccoli, respectively. This notion is closely related to the notion of a predicate in [[formal logic]], which includes more expressions than the former one, such as [[noun]]s and some kinds of [[adjective]]s. ==Predicate in traditional English grammar== A predicate is one of the two main parts of a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] (the other being the [[subject (grammar)|subject]], which the predicate [[Grammatical modifier|modifies]]).<ref>{{cite book |title=The Merriam Webster Dictionary |year=2004 |publisher=Merriam-Webster |location=Springfield, Massachusetts |page=566}}</ref> The predicate must contain a [[verb]], and the verb requires, permits, or precludes other sentence elements to complete the predicate. These elements are: [[Object (grammar)|objects]] (direct, indirect, prepositional), [[Predicative (adjectival or nominal)|predicatives]], [[adverb]]s: '''''She''' <u>dances</u>.'' (verb-only predicate) ''Ben <u>reads '''the book'''''.</u> (direct object) ''Ben's mother, Felicity, <u>gave '''me''' a present''.</u> (indirect object without a [[preposition]]) ''She <u>listened '''to the radio'''''.</u> (prepositional object) ''They <u>elected him '''president'''''.</u> (predicative / object [[Complement (grammar)|complement]]) ''She <u>met him '''in the park'''''.</u> ([[adverb]]ial) ''She <u>is '''in the park'''''.</u> (obligatory adverbial / adverbial complement) The predicate provides information about the subject, such as what the subject is doing or what the subject is like. The relation between a subject and its predicate is sometimes called a [[Nexus Grammar|nexus]]. A '''predicate nominal''' is a [[noun phrase]] that functions as the main predicate of a sentence, such as "''George III is the king of England''", ''the king of England'' being the predicate nominal. The subject and predicate nominal must be connected by a [[linking verb]], also called a [[copula (linguistics)|copula]]. A '''predicate adjective''' is an [[adjective]] that functions as a predicate, such as "Jessica is attractive", ''attractive'' being the predicate adjective. The subject and predicate adjective must be connected by a [[linking verb]], also called [[copula (linguistics)|copula]]. ==Classes of predicate== ===Carlson classes=== After the work of Greg N. Carlson, predicates have been divided into the following sub-classes, which roughly pertain to how a predicate relates to its subject: ==== Stage-level predicates==== A '''stage-level predicate''' ("s-l predicate" for short) is true of a ''temporal stage'' of its subject. For example, if John is "hungry", that typically lasts a certain amount of time, and not his entire lifespan. S-l predicates can
