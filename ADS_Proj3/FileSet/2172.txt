development and implementation of the national economy of the state and defence information technology systems for different purposes, computing systems and their software, including: <br /> - Theory and technology of building intelligent systems "Situation Centre" for the management of higher government authorities, national security, environmental security; <br /> - Theory, methods and tools for building systems information-analytical support of the lawmaking and enforcement activities; <br /> - Methods of software and hardware cryptographic security systems; <br /> - Methods and means of technical protection of information in information systems, information technology for protecting information from unauthorized access; <br /> - Theory, mathematical models and methods of automated systems for monitoring and decision support of environmental problems i effective nature; <br /> - Methods, algorithms and software for various data processing systems; <br /> - Theory, mathematical models and methods of building automation systems for technological processes; <br /> - Theory, research methods and ensure the reliability of automation systems and management information systems and other technical systems. ==Modern design == - Theoretical bases and technology of automated intelligent decision support systems for management of state departments, large industrial, pertaining to national economy associations, corporations and others on the basis of situational simulation (of a "Situation Centre"); <br /> - On the basis of theoretical results was created and introduced for the first time in Ukraine the Situation Centre of Ministry of Defence of Ukraine; <br /> - One of the models of SC MO "Forecasting the effects of emergencies on chemically hazardous objects" ("cloud") was used for conducting the Geochemistry Institute of NASU and the Ministry of Ukraine of the State Ecological Expertise environmental zone accident Ozhydiv-red in the Lviv region; <br /> - Designed and commissioned mock Situation room to practice decision support systems in distributed environments that provide adequate and improve management decisions in extreme and critical at different levels of government; <br /> - A few generations of automated systems for information support of the Legislative deputies of different levels (COUNCIL-1 "," BOARD-2, "BOARD-3, etc..) Which are implemented in more than 10 legislative bodies of Ukraine and abroad, including in the Parliament of Ukraine, Parliament of Crimea and the parliaments of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan; <br /> - Created and set in operation a system of information service Kiev city council "Tip 3 - KIEV, which has a high level of intellectualization, made on the basis of modern computers, peripheral equipment, systems, stands, displays, communications domestic production. For the parameters and system functionality is unique in the world; <br /> - The plan for Euro 2012 has developed and protected specification and technical design of emergency assistance to the population by a single telephone number 112 <br /> - The concept of an open recurrent neural network and its learning method that solves the problem of radical acceleration training. On the basis of such a neural network developed a new model of nuclear dynamical associative memory, suitable for real-time. Its efficiency is confirmed experimentally by the examples of adaptive recognition of dynamic patterns. The results were used in 2 projects of NATO programs and INTAS; <br /> - Created the world's first automated system for designing multi-module neural networks and its neural basis multi-module recognition of moving objects in video images; <br /> - A series of domestic neurocomputers general purpose and created the prototype of the basic model neurocomputers "NeuroLand", responsible, and on some parameters than the best world analogues; <br /> - The technology application multimodule neural networks for pattern recognition of ultrasonic location systems in vehicles and passenger safety in the creation of chemical images of intelligent sensors for fast detection of air pollution and others.; <br /> - An intelligent neural system that includes three subsystems: multi-module neuro-system general purpose subsystem recurrent neural network real-time "Neuro-Conveyor" subsystem and prediction of temporal sequences "TrendCaster"; <br /> - Designed modular architecture research model neural intellectual to automatically connect to the system and register new modules; <br /> - Academic Institute for the mathematical models of distribution of radionuclides in the water, on soil and air. Established on the basis of system modelling and forecasting the consequences of technological disasters has played an important role in preparing the decisions of government commissions to eliminate the consequences of accidents at Chernobyl and Dikanki treatment plants Kharkiv sewerage network; <br /> - Based on the developed mathematical models created a number of automated decision support systems (DSS) on environmental protection and effective nature, work performed to improve and upgrade of various systems; <br /> - Architectures of protection systems and communications on the basis of the family of crypto to protect mobile phone network GSM-standard; <br /> - Methods of construction and architecture of information security systems for local area networks and the family of standard hardware and software components that are built similar systems. Mobile communication systems adopted by the relevant Security Service Commission and recommended for use in public administration; <br /> - Developed pilot batch of mobile phones that can work both in normal and in Safe Mode, and design documentation for their mass production; <br /> - The method of exchange of crypto in IP networks and software crypto module switching, which allows an IP network voice conference in Safe Mode with a large number of participants in the negotiations; <br /> - Theoretical foundations, methods and technologies of model-oriented management of production systems and using them in conjunction with the Institute of Electric them. Prof. E.Paton NAS of Ukraine at the request of Boing corp. (USA) developed and implemented a unique installation of electron-beam welding of new generation KL115, KL118, KL117 with technical characteristics and functionalities, which have no analogues in the world; <br /> - Created and implemented in research and teaching in several universities in Ukraine, the family computer algebra systems with input languages of high-level "ANALYST-93, 2000 ANALYST, ANALYST, 2007; <br /> - Developed and tested in different countries (including Germany, England, Ireland, USA, Canada and Japan) is a new
