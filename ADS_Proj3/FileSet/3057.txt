He is currently the Presidential Professor of Physics and Medicine at the [[University of Southern California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uscnews.usc.edu/university/nobel_prize_winner_appointed_presidential_professor_at_usc.html|title=Nobel Prize Winner Appointed Presidential Professor at USC}}</ref> He formulated the [[quark model]] of hadronic resonances, and identified the SU(3) [[flavor symmetry]] of the light quarks, extending [[isospin]] to include [[strangeness]], which he also discovered. He discovered the V-A theory of chiral neutrinos in collaboration with [[Richard Feynman]]. He created [[current algebra]] in the 1960s as a way of extracting predictions from quark models when the fundamental theory was still murky, which led to model-independent [[Sum rule in quantum mechanics|sum rule]]s confirmed by experiment. Gell-Mann, along with Maurice Levy, discovered the sigma model of pions, which describes low energy pion interactions. Modifying the integer-charged quark model of Han and Nambu, Fritzsch and Gell-Mann were the first to write down the modern accepted theory of [[quantum chromodynamics]] although they did not anticipate [[asymptotic freedom]]. Gell-Mann is responsible for the [[seesaw mechanism|see-saw theory of neutrino masses]], that produces masses at the inverse-GUT scale in any theory with a right-handed neutrino, like the SO(10) model. He is also known to have played a large role in keeping [[string theory]] alive through the 1970s, supporting that line of research at a time when it was unpopular. ==Biography== Born in lower Manhattan into a family of [[Jewish]] immigrants, his father was a [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romanian Jew]] from [[Czernowitz]], [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]],<ref>{{cite web|author=M.

Propelled by an intense boyhood curiosity and love for nature, he entered [[Yale University|Yale]] as a member of [[Jonathan Edwards College]] at fifteen after graduating [[valedictorian]] from the [[Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School]]. Gell-Mann's work in the 1950s involved recently discovered [[cosmic ray]] particles that came to be called [[kaon]]s and [[hyperon]]s. Classifying these particles led him to propose a new [[quantum number]] called [[strangeness]]. Another of Gell-Mann's ideas is the [[Gell-Mann–Nishijima formula]], which was, initially, a formula based on empirical results, but was later explained by the quark model. Gell-Mann and [[Abraham Pais]] were involved in explaining many puzzling aspects of the physics of these particles. In 1961, this led him (and [[Kazuhiko Nishijima]]) to introduce a classification of elementary particles called [[hadron]]s (also independently proposed by [[Yuval Ne'eman]] six months earlier, although Gell-Mann alone got the Nobel Prize). This scheme is now explained by the [[quark model]]. Gell-Mann's own name for the classification scheme was the ''[[Eightfold Way (physics)|Eightfold Way]]'', because of the ''octets'' of particles in the classification. The term is a reference to the [[Noble Eightfold Path|eightfold way]] of [[Buddhism]]. Gell-Mann, and, independently, [[George Zweig]], went on, in 1964, to postulate the existence of [[quark]]s, the particles from which the [[hadron]]s are composed. The name was coined by Gell-Mann and is a reference to the novel ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', by [[James Joyce]] ("Three quarks for Muster Mark!" book 2, episode 4). Zweig had referred to the particles as "aces",<ref>{{cite book|author=G. Zweig|origyear=1964|chapter=An SU(3) model for strong interaction symmetry and its breaking II|url=http://cdsweb.cern.ch/search.py?recid=570209&ln=en|editors=D. Lichtenberg and S. Rosen|year=1980|title=Developments in the Quark Theory of Hadrons|volume=1|pages=22–101|publisher=[[Hadronic Press]]|isbn=}}</ref> but Gell-Mann's name caught on. Quarks were soon accepted as the underlying elementary objects in the study of the structure of hadrons. In 1972 he introduced with [[Harald Fritzsch]] the quantum number '[[color charge|color]]' and later, in a joint paper with [[Heinrich Leutwyler]], the full theory of [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD) was released as the gauge theory of strong interactions (cf. references). The [[quark model]] is part of QCD, and has been robust enough to survive the discovery of other [[flavour (particle physics)|flavour]]s of quarks. Gell-Mann and [[Richard Feynman]], working together, and a rival group of [[George Sudarshan]] and [[Robert Marshak]], were the first to discover the vector structure of the [[weak interaction]] in physics. This work followed the discovery of [[parity violation]] by [[Chien-Shiung Wu]], as suggested by [[Chen Ning Yang]] and [[Tsung-Dao Lee]]. In the 1990s his interest turned to the emerging study of [[complexity]], where he was closely associated with the [[Santa Fe Institute]]. He wrote a popular science book about these matters, ''[[The Quark and the Jaguar|The Quark and the Jaguar: Adventures in
