RDL is an [[XML]] application primarily used with Microsoft [[SQL Server Reporting Services]]. RDL is usually written using [[Visual Studio]], although there are also third-party tools; it may also be created or edited by hand in a text editor. [[SQL Server Reporting Services]] or other 3rd party reporting frameworks use RDL to define charts, graphs, calculations, text, images (through links) and other report objects and render them in a variety of formats. There are three high-level sections in a typical RDL file: * Page style - The objects to display including fields, images, graphs, tables. * Field definitions - The extended attributes of fields which are populated with formulas, dynamic data, or Database derived data. * Parameters and Database connections - Parameters that may be furnished by the user or passed in from another application; and database connections and queries for pulling data into the report. == External links == * [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd297486.aspx Report Definition Language Specification] [[Category:XML-based standards]] [[Category:Microsoft database software]] [[de:Report Definition Language]] [[ru:Report Definition Language]]</text> </page> <page> <id>31854</id> <title>Representation (systemics)</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=September 2009}} {{Expert-subject|Science|date=February 2009}} '''Representation''', from the most general and abstract [[systemics|systemic]] perspective, relates to a [[role]] or [[Function (engineering)|function]] or a property of an [[abstraction|abstract]] or real [[object]], relation or [[change]]s. For example, * an [[ambassador]] or a sport team may represent its nation. * graphical figures or written symbolic text may represent some abstract ideas or physical objects. In the case of humans or human-made objects, a representation can be: * formal or informal, i.e. "legal" or really realized with a consensus of interested community. * on the behalf of (or approved by) represented subject or without his/her/their permission. ==See also== *[[simulation]] *[[imitation]] *[[Social responsibility|responsibility]] *[[delegation]] *[[metaphor]] ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Metaphors]] {{sci-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>31857</id> <title>Representational theory of mind</title> <text>The '''representational theory of mind''' is the prevailing [[Philosophical theory|theory]] attempting to [[explanation|explain]] the nature of [[idea]]s, [[concept]]s and other mental content in [[contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] [[philosophy of mind]], [[cognitive science]] and [[experimental psychology]]. According to the representational theory of mind, [[thinking]] occurs within an internal system of representation. The [[propositional attitude]]s of the mind are [[Type-token distinction|token]] [[mental representation]]s (i.e., mental particulars with [[semantics|semantic]] properties). For example, when someone arrives at the belief that his or her floor needs sweeping, the representational theory of mind states that he or she forms a mental representation, one that represents the floor and its state of cleanliness. What makes this representation a [[belief]] is its [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functional]] role; it plays a function in mental processes in the way that is characteristic of beliefs. Desires and other types of attitudes have their own distinctive functional roles.<ref>''The Ontology of Concepts—Abstract Objects or Mental Representations?'', Eric Margolis and Stephen Laurence</ref> In contrast to theories of naive or [[direct realism]], the representational theory of mind postulates the actual existence of [[mental representation]]s which act as intermediaries between the [[observation|observing]] subject and the [[object (philosophy)|objects]], processes or other entities observed in the external world. These intermediaries stand for or represent to the mind the objects of that world. The original or "classical" representational theory probably can be traced back to [[Thomas Hobbes]] and was a dominant theme in classical [[empiricism]] in general. According to this version of the theory, the mental representations were images (often called "ideas") of the objects of states of affairs represented. For modern adherents, such as [[Jerry Fodor]], [[Steven Pinker]] and many others, the representational system consists rather of an internal [[language of thought]]. The contents of thoughts are represented in symbolic structures (the formulas of Mentalese) which, analogously to natural languages but on a much more abstract level, possess a [[syntax]] and [[semantics]] very much like those of natural languages. == References == {{reflist}} == External links == * [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-representation/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Mental Representation] {{philo-stub}} {{philosophy of mind}} [[Category:Theories of mind]] [[Category:Contemporary philosophy]]</text> </page> <page> <id>31871</id> <title>Requirements management</title> <text>{{Refimprove|date=December 2006}} '''Requirements management''' is the process of documenting, [[Requirements analysis|analyzing]], [[Requirements traceability|tracing]], [[Requirement prioritization|prioritizing]] and agreeing on requirements and then controlling change and communicating to relevant stakeholders. It is a continuous process throughout a project. A requirement is a capability to which a project outcome (product or service) should conform. == Overview == The purpose of requirements management is to assure the organization documents, verifies and meets the needs and expectations of its customers and internal or external stakeholders<ref name="Stellman05">{{cite book | last=Stellman | first=Andrew | last2=Greene | first2=Jennifer | title=Applied Software Project Management | url=http://www.stellman-greene.com/aspm/ | publisher=O'Reilly Media | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-596-00948-9 }}</ref>. Requirements management begins with the analysis and elicitation of the objectives and constraints of the organization. Requirements management further includes supporting planning for requirements, integrating requirements and the organization for working with them (attributes for requirements), as well as relationships with other information delivering against requirements, and changes for these. The traceability thus established is used in managing requirements to report back fulfillment of company and stakeholder interests, in terms of compliance, completeness, coverage and consistency. Traceabilities also support change management as part of requirements management in understanding the impacts of changes through requirements or other related elements (e.g., functional impacts through relations to functional architecture), and facilitating introducing these changes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ogc.gov.uk/delivery_lifecycle_requirements_management.asp |title=Requirements management |publisher=UK Office of Government Commerce |accessdate=2009-11-10 }}</ref> Requirements management involves communication between the project team members and stakeholders, and adjustment to requirements changes throughout the course of the project<ref name="PMBOK08">{{cite book | title=A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge | edition=4th | url=http://www.pmi.org/ | publisher=Project Management Institute | year=2008 | isbn=978-1-933-89051-7 }}</ref>.
