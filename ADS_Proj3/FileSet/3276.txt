The declared goal<ref name="OmniFocus Overview">OmniFocus Overview, http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/</ref> of the program is to be able to capture thoughts and ideas into [[to do list]]s. The program uses concepts and techniques described in the book [[Getting Things Done]] (commonly abbreviated as GTD) by [[David Allen (author)|David Allen]]. == History == OmniFocus has its roots in the Kinkless kGTD add/scripts for the Omnigroups OmniOutliner product.<ref name='Oreilly Radar 2006-10-21'> {{cite web|url=http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/10/the-story-of-kgtd-and-omnifocu.html |title=The Story of KGTD and OmniFocus |accessdate=2009-01-13 |last=Forrest |first=Brady |date=2006-10-21 |publisher=OReilly Publishing }}</ref> Kinkless (kGTD) was developed by Ethan J. A. Schoonover to enable those following the GTD methodology. The Omni group subsequently brought Ethan along with [[Merlin Mann]] to form a project team to create the OmniFocus application.<ref name='Omni Group interview: part 1'> {{cite web|url=http://en.onsoftware.com/omnigroup-interview-part-1/ |title=The Story of KGTD and OmniFocus |accessdate=2009-01-13 |last=Roger |first=Cyril |date=2007-05-08 |publisher=onsoftware }}</ref> == iPod Touch/iPhone/iPad version == OmniFocus is available on several Apple products, including the iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad. The iPod Touch/iPhone version is necessarily not as feature complete as the desktop version. Synchronization between the two versions is reported to be both reliable and predictable. It is possible to successfully use the iPod Touch/iPhone version as a standalone GTD tool, with no need to purchase the desktop version. Ken Case, chairman and CEO of OmniGroup has been quoted as saying that the "iPhone version of OmniFocus was not to be merely a companion to the desktop version".<ref name='Ars Omnifocus preview'> {{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2008/06/15/ars-at-wwdc-preview-of-omnifocus-for-the-iphone |title=Ars at WWDC: Preview of OmniFocus for the iPhone |accessdate=2009-01-13 |last=Ecker |first=Clint |date=2008-06-15 |publisher=Ars Technica }}</ref> The Omni Group released a new version of OmniFocus for the Apple [[iPad]] on July 30th, 2010.<ref name='OmniFocus announcement'> {{cite web|url=http://www.omnigroup.com/blog/entry/omnifocus_for_ipad_now_available_on_the_app_store_hallelujah/ |title=OmniFocus for iPad now available on the App Store (hallelujah!) |accessdate=2010-08-29 |last=Sharps |first=Linda |date=2010-07-30 |publisher=The Omni Group }}</ref> ==See also== * [[Getting Things Done]] * [[Things (application)]] * [[Taskwarrior]] ==References== <div class='references-small'> <references/> </div> ==External links== * [http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/ OmniFocus]—The official page for OmniFocus on the Omni Group web site.

It was published in the philosophy journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' in 1905; then reprinted, in both a special 2005 anniversary issue of the same journal and in Russell's ''Logic and Knowledge'', 1956. In it, Russell introduces definite and indefinite descriptions, formulates [[descriptivist_theory_of_names|descriptivism]] with regard to proper names, and characterizes proper names as "disguised" or "abbreviated" [[definite descriptions]]. In the 1920s, [[Frank P. Ramsey]] referred to the essay as "that paradigm of philosophy."<ref>{{citation |title=The foundations of mathematics and other logical essays |author=Frank Plumpton Ramsey, Richard Bevan Braithwaite |editor=Richard Bevan Braithwaite |publisher=Routledge |year=2001 |isbn=9780415225465 |page=263 | accessdate = 2010-08-28 | url = http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1st-3kYOEPQC&pg=PA263&dq=%22that+paradigm+of+philosophy%22+ramsey&hl=en&ei=82R4TOCcMsySswa88rCyDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false }}</ref><ref>{{Citaton |title=Talking philosophy: a wordbook |author=A.

Zalta (ed.), URL=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2005/entries/descriptions/ </ref> ==The "denoting phrase"== ===Russell's concept of a denoting phrase=== For Russell, a denoting phrase is a singular noun phrase, preceded by a [[quantifier]], whose [[predicate]] term is satisfied by some particular. Such phrases do not contribute objects as the constituents of the singular propositions in which they occur. Denotation, in other words, is a semantically inert property, in this view. Whereas [[Frege]] held that there were two distinct parts (or aspects) of the meaning of every term, phrase or sentence (its [[Sense_and_Reference|''Sinn'' and ''Bedeutung'']]), Russell explicitly rejects the notion of sense (''Sinn'') and replaces it with the idea of a propositional function (i.e., a function from objects to abstract propositions that are the contents of sentences). This is so because, for Russell, propositions must have concrete, really existing entities as their constituents. Russell provides several clear examples of the sort of thing that he had in mind: "a man, any man, every man, the present King of France... the centre of mass of the Solar System, ...." So, for Russell, a denoting phrase can be either a definite description (i.e., a singular noun phrase with the determinative article "the" at the beginning), which "does not denote anything" (meaning designate any specific object) or a definite description that does denote a specific object or, finally, an indefinite description that denotes "ambiguously". Russell, as will be shown later, believes that definite descriptions are not [[referring expression]]s but rather, to borrow a term later coined by [[Keith Donnellan]], they have "attributive" uses only. They are to be interpreted as strictly logical quantificational formulas that are "general" in nature. At least this has been the general interpretation of Russell among philosophical logicans for nearly a century. ===Reference to something that does not exist=== However, it is interesting to note that at the very beginning of the article, Russell distinguishes between cases where "a phrase may be denoting and yet not denote anything (e.g. 'the present King of France')" and cases where they may denote
