The [http://www.gio.gov.tw/ GIO] in [[Taiwan]] divides licensed films into one of the following four categories pursuant to its issued [[s:Regulations Governing the Classification of Motion Pictures of the Republic of China|Regulations Governing the Classification of Motion Pictures of the Republic of China]] ([[s:zh:電影片分級處理辦法|電影片分級處理辦法]] in traditional Chinese): *'''General audiences category''' (普遍級(普)) - General audiences may all view.

''Related and official link:'' [http://www.gio.gov.tw/info/law/movie/3.htm Classifications of movies] (in traditional Chinese) ==Thailand== {{See also|Cinema of Thailand}} Before the introduction of the rating system, films are subject to the 1930 Film Act, under which films must be viewed by the Board of Censors, which can then impose cuts on the films prior to release. The board is composed of members of the Royal Thai Police and the Ministry of Culture, with advisory roles from the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] religion, educators and the medical community. Most cuts are made for sexual content, while acts of violence are typically left untouched. A motion picture rating system was proposed in the Film and Video Act of 2007, and was passed on December 20, 2007 by the [[Council for National Security|Thai military]]-appointed [[National Assembly of Thailand|National Legislative Assembly]]. Under the law, the ratings, in effect since August 2009, are: * '''P''' - Promotional, film is educational and viewing is encouraged for all Thai people. * '''G''' - Suitable for general audiences. * '''13+''' - Films not suitable for viewers under 13 years old. * '''15+''' - Films not suitable for viewers under 15 years old. * '''18+''' - Films not suitable for viewers under 18 years old. * '''20+''' - Films not suitable for viewers under 20 years old. * '''Banned''' - Films that are not allowed to screen publicly in the Kingdom. The draft law had been met with resistance from the film industry and independent filmmakers under the Free Thai Cinema Movement. Activists had hoped for a less-restrictive approach than the 1930 Film Act, but under the Film and Video Act, films are still be subject to censorship, or can be banned from release altogether if the film is deemed to "undermine or disrupt social order and moral decency, or might impact national security or the pride of the nation". As of 2007, a supplementary law or ministerial regulation to implement the rating system was yet to be drafted, and the 1930 Film Act remained in place.<ref>Rithdee, Kong. December 20, 2007.
