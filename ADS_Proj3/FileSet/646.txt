by 1 point|| Chaos 2's first judge's decision. Stinger and Chaos 2 were even on damage, style and aggression, but Chaos 2 won on control. |- |Grand Final|| Pussycat|| Won by judges' decision|| Impressed the judges by throwing Pussycat several feet in the air, but slowed down a little and lost some of its power in its weapon somewhat after having a piece of polycarbonate sliced off the back of it. They came back though, nearly flipping Pussycat out of the arena, and pushing them into Shunt, who, oddly, missed with the axe. |} Chaos 2 won the UK championship for the second consecutive time. ;Northern Annihilator {| class="wikitable" ! Round !! Opponent !! Result !! Notes |- | Round 1 || Spikasaurus vs. Stinger vs. Killerhurtz vs. Dominator 2 vs. Suicidal Tendencies || Eliminated by knockout|| Ganged up on by other robots. They very nearly knocked out Killerhurtz. The axes of Dominator 2 and Killerhurtz came crashing down on the bodyshell and flipper of Chaos 2, and the heavy swinging mace of Stinger caused the top of the flipper to completely cave in. Chaos 2 were immobilised from then on. |} === Robot Wars Extreme - Series 1 === {| class="wikitable" ! Round !! Opponent !! Result !!

However, after this loss, it received a massive overhaul to bring it back to working order. It no longer fights, but it still appears as a display robot at some Charity Events. {{s-start}} {{s-bef|before=[[Panic Attack (Robot)|Panic Attack]]}} {{s-ttl|title=UK [[Robot Wars (TV series)|Robot Wars]] |years= Reigning Champion (Series 3, 4)}} {{s-aft|after=[[Razer (Robot)|Razer]]}} {{s-end}} == External links == *[http://www.gt-electronics.freeserve.co.uk/c2/ Chaos 2's Home Page] {{Robot Wars}} [[Category:Robot Wars competitors]]</text> </page> <page> <id>5890</id> <title>Chaotic hysteresis</title> <text>A nonlinear [[dynamical system]] exhibits '''chaotic hysteresis''' if it simultaneously exhibits chaotic dynamics ([[chaos theory]]) and [[hysteresis]]. As the latter involves the persistence of a state, such as magnetization, after the causal or exogenous force or factor is removed, it involves multiple equilibria for given sets of control conditions. Such systems generally exhibit sudden jumps from one equilibrium state to another (sometimes amenable to analysis using [[catastrophe theory]]). If chaotic dynamics appear either prior to or just after such jumps, or are persistent throughout each of the various equilibrium states, then the system is said to exhibit chaotic hysteresis. Chaotic dynamics are irregular and bounded and subject to sensitive dependence on initial conditions. ==Background and applications== The term was introduced initially by [[Ralph Abraham]] and [[Christopher Shaw]] (1987), but was modeled conceptually earlier and has been applied to a wide variety of systems in many disciplines. The first model of such a phenomenon was due to Otto RÃ¶ssler in 1983, which he viewed as applying to major brain dynamics, and arising from three dimensional chaotic systems. In 1986 it was applied to electric oscillators by Newcomb and El-Leithy, perhaps the most widely used application since (see also Pecora and Carroll, 1990). The first to use the term for a specific application was [[J. Barkley Rosser, Jr.]] in 1991, who suggested that it could be applied to explaining the process of systemic economic transition, with Poirot (2001) following up on this in regard to the Russian financial crisis of 1998. Empirical analysis of the phenomenon in the Russian economic transition was done by Rosser, Rosser, Guastello, and Bond (2001). While he did
