to the correct [[file server]] and share. A DFS root can only exist on a Windows 2000 version that is part of the server family, and only one DFS root can exist on that server. There can be two ways of implementing a DFS namespace on Windows 2000: either through a standalone DFS root or a domain-based DFS root. Standalone DFS allows for only DFS roots on the local computer, and thus does not use Active Directory. Domain-based DFS roots exist within Active Directory and can have their information distributed to other [[domain controller]]s within the domain — this provides [[Fault-tolerant system|fault tolerance]] to DFS. DFS roots that exist on a domain must be hosted on a domain controller or on a domain member server. The file and root information is replicated via the Microsoft [[File Replication Service]] (FRS).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/812487|title=Microsoft KB article 812487: Overview of DFS in Windows 2000}}</ref> ==== Active Directory ==== {{main|Active Directory}} A new way of organizing [[Windows Server domain|Windows network domains]], or groups of resources, called Active Directory, is introduced with Windows 2000 to replace Windows NT's earlier domain model. Active Directory's hierarchical nature allowed administrators a built-in way to manage user and computer policies and user accounts, and to automatically deploy programs and updates with a greater degree of scalability and centralization than provided in previous Windows versions. It is one of the main reasons many corporations migrated to Windows 2000.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} User information stored in Active Directory also provided a convenient phone book-like function to end users. Active Directory domains can vary from small installations with a few hundred objects, to large installations with millions. Active Directory can organise and link groups of domains into a contiguous [[domain name]] space to form ''trees''. Groups of trees outside of the same namespace can be linked together to form ''forests''. Active Directory services could only be installed on a Windows 2000 Server, Advanced Server, or Datacenter Server computer, and cannot be installed on a Windows 2000 Professional computer. However, Windows 2000 Professional is the first client operating system able to exploit Active Directory's new features. As part of an organization's migration, Windows NT clients continued to function until all clients were upgraded to Windows 2000 Professional, at which point the Active Directory domain could be switched to [[native mode]] and maximum functionality achieved. Active Directory requires a DNS server that supports [[SRV resource record]]s, or that an organization's existing DNS infrastructure be upgraded to support this. There must be one or more [[domain controller]]s to hold the Active Directory database and provide Active Directory [[directory services]]. ==== Volume fault tolerance ==== Along with support for simple, spanned and striped volumes, the server family of Windows 2000 also supports fault-tolerant volume types. The types supported are ''mirrored volumes'' and ''RAID-5 volumes'': *'''Mirrored volumes:''' the volume contains several disks, and when data is written to one it is also written to the other disks. This means that if one disk fails, the data can be totally recovered from the other disk. Mirrored volumes are also known as [[Redundant array of independent disks#RAID 1|RAID-1]]. *'''RAID-5 volumes:''' a [[Standard RAID levels#RAID 5|RAID-5]] volume consists of multiple disks, and it uses [[Block (data storage)|block]]-level striping with parity data distributed across all member disks. Should a disk fail in the array, the parity blocks from the surviving disks are combined mathematically with the data blocks from the surviving disks to reconstruct the data on the failed drive "on-the-fly". == Deployment == Windows 2000 can be [[software deployment|deployed]] to a site via various methods. It can be installed onto servers via traditional media (such as CD) or via distribution folders that reside on a shared folder. Installations can be attended or unattended. During a manual installation, the administrator must specify configuration options. Unattended installations are scripted via an [[answer file]], or a predefined script in the form of an [[initialization file|INI file]] that has all the options filled in. An answer file can be created manually or using the graphical ''Setup manager''. The Winnt.exe or Winnt32.exe program then uses that answer file to automate the installation. Unattended installations can be performed via a bootable CD, using Microsoft [[Systems Management Server]] (SMS) , via the [[Sysprep|System Preparation Tool (Sysprep)]], via the Winnt32.exe program using the /syspart switch or via [[Remote Installation Services]] (RIS). The ability to [[Slipstream (computing)|slipstream]] a [[service pack]] into the original operating system setup files is also introduced in Windows 2000.<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000pro/deploy/depopt/easydep.mspx#EKFAC Make deployment easier in Windows 2000]</ref> The Sysprep method is started on a standardized reference computer — though the hardware need not be similar — and it copies the required installation files from the reference computer to the target computers. The hard drive does not need to be in the target computer and may be swapped out to it at any time, with the hardware configured later. The Winnt.exe program must also be passed a /unattend switch that points to a valid answer file and a /s file that points to one or more valid installation sources. Sysprep allows the duplication of a [[disk image]] on an existing Windows 2000 Server installation to multiple servers. This means that all applications and system configuration settings will be copied across to the new installations, and thus, the reference and target computers must have the same [[Hardware Abstraction Layer|HALs]], [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface|ACPI]] support, and mass storage devices — though Windows 2000 automatically detects "[[plug and play]]" devices. The primary reason for using Sysprep is to quickly deploy Windows 2000 to a site that has multiple computers with standard hardware. (If a system had different HALs, mass storage devices or ACPI support, then multiple images would need to be maintained.) Systems Management Server can be used to upgrade multiple computers to Windows 2000. These must be running Windows NT 3.51, Windows NT 4.0, Windows 98 or Windows 95 OSR2.x along with the SMS client agent that can receive software installation operations. Using SMS allows installations over a wide area and provides
