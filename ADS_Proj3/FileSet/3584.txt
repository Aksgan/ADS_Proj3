Values near or below zero indicate processes operating off target (<MATH>\hat{\mu}</MATH> far from T) or with high variation. Fixing values for minimum "acceptable" process capability targets is a matter of personal opinion, and what consensus exists varies by industry, facility, and the process under consideration. For example, in the automotive industry, the AIAG sets forth guidelines in the [[Production Part Approval Process]], 4th edition for recommended C<SUB>pk</SUB> minimum values for critical-to-quality process characteristics. However, these criteria are debatable and several processes may not be evaluated for capability just because they have not properly been assessed. Since the process capability is a function of the specification, the Process Capability Index is only as good as the specification . For instance, if the specification came from an engineering guideline without considering the function and criticality of the part, a discussion around process capability is useless, and would have more benefits if focused on what are the real risks of having a part borderline out of specification. The loss function of [[Taguchi methods|Taguchi]] better illustrates this concept.

Process fallout quantifies how many defects a process produces and is measured by [[Defects per million opportunities|DPMO]] or [[Parts-per notation|PPM]]. Process yield is, of course, the complement of process fallout and is approximately equal to the area under the [[probability density function]] <MATH>\Phi(\sigma) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\sigma}^\sigma e^{-t^2/2} \, dt</MATH> if the process output is approximately [[normally distributed]]. In the short term ("short sigma"), the relationships are: {| class="wikitable" |- ! C<SUB>pk ! Sigma level (σ) ! Area under the [[probability density function]] <MATH>\Phi(\sigma)</MATH> ! Process yield ! Process fallout (in terms of DPMO/PPM) |- | 0.33 || 1 || 0.6826894921 || 68.27% || 317311 |- | 0.67 || 2 || 0.9544997361 || 95.45% || 45500 |- | 1.00 || 3 || 0.9973002039 || 99.73% || 2700 |- | 1.33 || 4 || 0.9999366575 || 99.99% || 63 |- | 1.67 || 5 || 0.9999994267 || 99.9999% || 1 |- | 2.00 || 6 || 0.9999999980 || 99.9999998% || 0.002 |} In the long term, processes can shift or drift significantly (most [[control chart]]s are only sensitive to changes of 1.5σ or greater in process output), so process capability indices are not applicable as they require [[statistical control]]. ==Example== Consider a quality characteristic with target of 100.00 [[Micrometre|μm]] and upper and lower specification limits of 106.00 μm and 94.00 μm respectively. If, after carefully monitoring the process for a while, it appears that the process is in control and producing output predictably (as depicted in the [[run chart]] below), we can meaningfully estimate its mean and standard deviation.
