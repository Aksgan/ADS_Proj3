Advances in these areas are giving scientists new methods for unravelling the complex biochemical processes occurring inside cells, with the larger goal of understanding and treating human diseases. At the same time, the [[semiconductor industry]] has been steadily perfecting the science of micro-miniaturization. The merging of these two fields in recent years has enabled biotechnologists to begin packing their traditionally bulky sensing tools into smaller and smaller spaces, onto so-called biochips. These chips are essentially miniaturized laboratories that can perform hundreds or thousands of simultaneous biochemical reactions. Biochips enable researchers to quickly screen large numbers of biological analytes for a variety of purposes, from disease diagnosis to detection of bioterrorism agents. ==History== The development of biochips has a long history, starting with early work on the underlying [[sensor]] technology. One of the first portable, chemistry-based sensors was the [[glass electrode|glass pH electrode]], invented in 1922 by Hughes (Hughes, 1922). Measurement of [[pH]] was accomplished by detecting the potential difference developed across a thin glass membrane selective to the permeation of hydrogen ions; this selectivity was achieved by exchanges between H<sup>+</sup> and SiO sites in the glass. The basic concept of using exchange sites to create permselective membranes was used to develop other [[Ion selective electrode|ion sensors]] in subsequent years. For example, a K<sup>+</sup> sensor was produced by incorporating [[valinomycin]] into a thin membrane (Schultz, 1996). Over thirty years elapsed before the first true [[biosensor]] (''i.e.'' a sensor utilizing biological molecules) emerged. In 1956, Leland Clark published a paper on an [[Clark electrode|oxygen sensing electrode]] (Clark, 1956_41). This device became the basis for a [[glucose]] sensor developed in 1962 by Clark and colleague Lyons which utilized [[glucose oxidase]] molecules embedded in a [[dialysis]] membrane (Clark, 1962). The [[enzyme]] functioned in the presence of glucose to decrease the amount of oxygen available to the oxygen electrode, thereby relating oxygen levels to glucose concentration. This and similar biosensors became known as enzyme electrodes, and are still in use today. In 1953, [[Watson and Crick]] announced their discovery of the now familiar [[double helix]] structure of [[DNA]] molecules and set the stage for [[genetics]] research that continues to the present day (Nelson, 2000). The development of [[sequencing]] techniques in 1977 by [[Walter Gilbert|Gilbert]] (Maxam, 1977) and [[Frederick Sanger|Sanger]] (Sanger, 1977) (working separately) enabled researchers to directly read the genetic codes that provide instructions for [[protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]]. This research showed how [[hybridisation (molecular biology)|hybridization]] of complementary single [[oligonucleotide]] strands could be used as a basis for DNA sensing. Two additional developments enabled the technology used in modern DNA-based biosensors. First, in 1983 [[Kary Mullis]] invented the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) technique (Nelson, 2000), a method for amplifying DNA concentrations. This discovery made possible the detection of extremely small quantities of DNA in samples. Second, in 1986 Hood and co-workers devised a method to label DNA molecules with [[fluorescent tag]]s instead of radiolabels (Smith, 1986), thus enabling hybridization experiments to be observed optically. The rapid technological advances of the [[biochemistry]] and [[semiconductor]] fields in the 1980s led to the large scale development of biochips in the 1990s. At this time, it became clear that biochips were largely a "platform" technology which consisted of several separate, yet integrated components. Figure 1 shows the make up of a typical biochip platform. The actual sensing component (or "chip") is just one piece of a complete analysis system. [[Transducer|Transduction]] must be done to translate the actual sensing event (DNA binding, [[redox|oxidation/reduction]], ''etc.'') into a format understandable by a computer ([[voltage]], light intensity, mass, ''etc.''), which then enables additional analysis and processing to produce a final, [[human-readable]] output. The multiple technologies needed to make a successful biochip &mdash; from sensing chemistry, to [[microarray]]ing, to signal processing &mdash; require a true multidisciplinary approach, making the barrier to entry steep. One of the first commercial biochips was introduced by [[Affymetrix]]. Their "GeneChip" products contain thousands of individual DNA sensors for use in sensing defects, or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in genes such as [[p53]] (a tumor suppressor) and [[BRCA1]] and [[BRCA2]] (related to breast cancer) (Cheng, 2001). The chips are produced using [[microlithography]] techniques traditionally used to fabricate [[integrated circuits]] (see below). [[image:Biochip platform.jpg|frame|thumb right|300 px|Figure 1. Biochips are a platform that require, in addition to microarray technology, transduction and signal processing technologies to output the results of sensing experiments.]] Today, a large variety of biochip technologies are either in development or being commercialized. Numerous advancements continue to be made in sensing research that enable new platforms to be developed for new applications. Cancer diagnosis through DNA typing is just one market opportunity. A variety of industries currently desire the ability to simultaneously screen for a wide range of chemical and biological agents, with purposes ranging from testing public water systems for disease agents to screening
