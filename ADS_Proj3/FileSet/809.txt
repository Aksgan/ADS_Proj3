It should also be noted that Boot Camp is a tool for natively booting Windows XP on Intel Macintosh and is not a virtualization product. This comparison is of limited value today, as both products have had 2 major upgrades since then. [[Image:Fusion chart01.png]] [[Image:Fusion chart02.png]] This comparison was tested on an eight-core, 2.66 GHz MacPro running [[Mac OS X v10.4|Mac OS X 10.4.10]], Parallels Desktop 3.0 for Mac (build 4560) and VMware Fusion 1.0 (build 51348). Fusion and Parallels were both set to 1,024 MB of system memory and a 32 GB hard disk. Fusion was set to 128 MB of graphics memory, and Parallels Desktop for Mac was set to 64 MB of graphics memory (the maximum for each at that time)<ref name=cnet_benchmarks/>. ==2008 Benchmark tests== In Volume 24, Issue 02 of [[MacTech]], the editors published the results of one-step and task tests between VMware Fusion 1.0, Parallels Desktop 3.0 and Boot Camp and used a PC running Windows XP as a baseline comparison in a native PC environment.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ticktin |first=Neil |title=Virtualization Benchmarking How do Boot Camp, Parallels Desktop, and VMware Fusion stack up? |accessdate=February 2008 |url=http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.24/24.02/VirtualizationBenchmark/ |publisher=MacTech}}</ref> *One-step Test: After clicking the mouse or pressing a key, this test requires no further human action. * Task Test: This tests the interaction between Mac OS X and the virtual environment and requires multiple tests throughout the process. MacTech found that the faster the physical host computer, the more similarly Parallels Desktop and VMware Fusion performed. MacTech did not test multiple processor performance. The following graphs displays the results in seconds. Shorter bars indicate faster performance. [[Image:Mactech---cross-platform.png‎]] [[Image:mactech---network---file-io.png]] Each test was run on a [[MacBook]] (2 GB RAM; 1.83 GHz Core Duo processor), a [[MacBook Pro]] (4GB RAM; 2.16 GHz Core 2 Duo processor) and a [[Mac Pro]] (4GB RAM; Quad Core configuration with two 2.66 GHz Dual-Core Intel Xeon processors). MacTech tested Parallels Desktop 3.0 for Mac Build 5160 and VMware Fusion 1.0 Build 51348. All tests were done on clean host systems with new installations of Mac OS X 10.4.10 and Office installations and included all of the most up-to-date patches. No third party software was installed other than Mac OS X, VMware Fusion, Parallels Desktop, [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Vista]], [[Adobe Acrobat|Adobe Reader]] and [[Microsoft Office]]. ==2009 Benchmark tests== In March, 2009, Volume 25, Issue 04, [[MacTech]] <ref>{{cite web |last=Ticktin |first=Neil |title= Head-to-Head: Parallels Desktop for Mac vs. VMware Fusion |accessdate=March 2009 |url=http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.25/25.04/VMBenchmarks/|publisher=MacTech}}</ref> published the results of a new series of [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] tests that compared the performance between VMware Fusion 2.0.1 and Parallels Desktop 4.0 for Mac (build 3540), both running [[Mac OS X]] 10.5.5. In most of MacTech’s tests, Parallels Desktop performed 14-20% faster than Fusion; however, Fusion ran 10% faster than Parallels Desktop when running Windows XP 32-bit on 2 virtual processors.<ref>http://www.mactech.com:16080/articles/mactech/Vol.25/25.04/VMBenchmarks/index-001.html</ref> {| class="wikitable" style="font-size: smaller; text-align: center; width: 50%; table-layout: fixed;" !
