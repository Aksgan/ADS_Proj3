The [[App Store]] application, available in all versions of iOS from 2.0 onwards, allows users to browse and download applications from a single online repository (hosted by Apple) with the iTunes Store. To develop such software, a [[software development kit]] (SDK) was officially announced on March 6, 2008, at an Apple Town Hall meeting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2008/03/06/live-from-apples-iphone-press-conference/ |title=Live from Apple's iPhone SDK press conference |publisher=Engadget |date= |accessdate=2010-03-03}}</ref> The [[iPhone SDK]] allows developers to make applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch after paying a fee to join the development team. The developer can then set the price for the applications they develop and will receive 70% of money earned. The developer can also opt to release the application for free and will not pay any additional costs. Shortly after the iPhone (then also the iPod touch) was released, [[hacker (computer security)|hackers]] were able to "[[Jailbreaking for iOS|jailbreak]]" the device through a [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]] exploit. The application installed by this exploit enabled the user to download a selection of unofficial third-party programs. Jailbreaking the iPod Touch was the only way to get third-party programs when running 1.1.x OSes. These third-party programs could use additional functionality not supported by Apple (such as enabling multitasking, applying themes to the home screen or enable battery percentage indicator. All officially released versions of iOS through 3.1.2, and 4.0, as well as 4.2.1 with some bugs, can be jailbroken,<ref name=jailbreak1>{{cite web |url=http://winpwn.com/index.php/Main_Page |title=WinPwn official site |accessdate=2008-07-26 |date=2008-07-25}}</ref><ref name=jailbreak2>{{cite web |url=http://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/126908912/redsn0w-in-june |title=Dev-Team Blog, Red Snow |accessdate=2009-06-30 |date=2009-06-30}}</ref> but version 3.1 could not at the time it was released.<ref name="everything">{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/09/iphone31/ |title=Everything You Wanted to Know About iPhone OS 3.1 But Were Afraid to Ask |publisher=Wired.com |date=2009-09-11 |accessdate=2010-03-03}}</ref> Servicing an iPod Touch after jailbreaking or other modifications made by unofficial means is not covered by Apple's warranty (however, the jailbreaking process is easily undone by performing a restore through iTunes).<ref>[http://images.apple.com/legal/warranty/docs/ipodisight.pdf iPod and iSight Warranty (PDF)], [[Apple Inc.]], page 1.
