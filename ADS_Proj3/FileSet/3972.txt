SPF allows administrators to specify which [[host (network)|hosts]] are allowed to send e-mail from a given domain by creating a specific [[List of DNS record types|SPF record]] in the public [[Domain Name System]] (DNS). [[Mail exchanger]]s then use the DNS to check that mail from a given domain is being sent by a host sanctioned by that domain's administrators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.openspf.org/Introduction|title=Sender Policy Framework: Introduction}}</ref> ==Principles of operation== {{Further|[[Sender Rewriting Scheme]] (SRS)}} Normal [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]] allows any computer to send an e-mail claiming to be from anyone. Thus, it is easy for [[e-mail spam|spammers]] to send [[email|e-mail]] from forged [[email address|addresses]]. This makes it difficult to trace back to where the spam truly comes from, and easy for spammers to hide their true identity in order to avoid responsibility. Many believe that the ability for anyone to forge ''sender addresses'' (also known as Return-Paths) is a security flaw in modern SMTP, caused by an undesirable side-effect of the deprecation of ''[[source routing|source routes]]''. SPF allows the owner of an Internet domain to use a special format of [[Domain Name System|DNS]] records ("SPF", type 99) to specify which machines are authorized to send e-mail for that domain. For example, the owner of the example.com domain can designate which machines are authorized to send e-mail with the sender e-mail address ending in "@example.com". Receivers checking SPF can reject messages from unauthorized machines ''before receiving the body of the message''. Thus, principles of operations are quite similar to those of [[DNSBL]] (DNS-based blackhole list), except that SPF leverages the authority delegation scheme of the real Domain Name System. Early implementations used [[TXT record]]s for quick deployment before the new type was available in many server programs. Use of TXT records for SPF as a transitional mechanism, although still common in 2010, is deprecated. The sender address is transmitted at the beginning of the SMTP dialog. If the [[server (computing)|server]] rejects the sender, the unauthorized [[Client (computing)|client]] should receive a rejection message, and if that client was a relaying [[Message transfer agent|MTA]], a [[bounce message]] to the original sending address may be generated. If the server accepts the sender, and subsequently also accepts the recipient(s) and the body of the message, it should insert a Return-Path header in the message's body in order to save the sender address. While the address in the Return-Path often matches other originator addresses in the mail header like "From:" or "Sender:" this is not necessarily the case, and SPF does not prevent forgeries of these other addresses. Spammers can send e-mail with an SPF PASS result if they have an account in a domain with a sender policy, or abuse a compromised system in this domain. However, doing so makes the spammer easier to trace and prosecute. The main benefit of SPF is to people whose e-mail addresses are forged in the Return-Paths. They receive a large mass of unsolicited error messages and other auto-replies, making it difficult to use e-mail normally. If such people use SPF to specify their legitimate sending IPs with a FAIL result for all other IPs, receivers checking SPF can reject forgeries, thus reducing or eliminating the amount of [[Backscatter (e-mail)|backscatter]]. SPF has potential advantages beyond helping identify unwanted e-mail. In particular, if a sender provides SPF information, then receivers can use SPF PASS results in combination with a white list to identify known reliable senders. Scenarios like compromised systems and shared sending mailers limit this use. ===Reasons to implement=== If a domain publishes an SPF record, spammers and phishers are less likely to forge e-mails pretending to be from that domain, since the forged e-mails are more likely to be caught in spam filters which check the SPF record. Therefore, an SPF protected domain is less attractive to spammers and phishers. Since an SPF protected domain is less attractive as a spoofed address, it is less likely to be blacklisted by spam filters and so ultimately the legitimate e-mail from the domain is more likely to get through.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emailmanual.co.uk/index.php/2009/05/why-should-i-implement-a-spf-record-on-my-domain/ |title=Why should I implement a SPF record on my domain? |publisher=Email Manual |year=2009 |month=May |accessdate=2010-01-01}}</ref> ===FAIL and forwarding=== SPF does not allow [[Email forwarding#Server-based forwarding|plain message forwarding]]. When a domain publishes an SPF FAIL policy, then legitimate messages sent to receivers forwarding their mail to third parties can be rejected and bounced if any of the following occur: # The forwarder does not rewrite the [[Return-Path]], unlike mailing lists. # The next hop does not white list the forwarder. # This hop checks SPF. This is a necessary and obvious feature of SPF – checks ''behind'' the "border" [[Mail transfer agent|MTA]] ([[MX record|MX]]) of the receiver cannot work
