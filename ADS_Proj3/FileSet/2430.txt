There is no actual organization that goes by the name ''Knights of the Lambda Calculus''; it mostly only exists as a [[hacker culture]] in-joke. The concept most likely originated at [[MIT]]. For example, in the [[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs]] [http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/ video lectures], one of the lecturers presents the audience with the button, saying they are now members of this special group.

It was initially designed as an information management tool for [[knowledge worker]]s and is often used for collaborative research projects, [[market intelligence]], information brokerage, etc. The vendor's company, [http://www.whatever-company.com Whatever S.A.], is based in [[Louvain-la-Neuve|Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park]] (Belgium), has offices in Paris (France) and partners in Italy, Spain, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom.
