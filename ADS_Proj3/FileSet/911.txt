about the [[nuisance parameter]]s in ''φ''. Note that the treatment of the [[nuisance parameter]]s above is often omitted from discussions comparing confidence and credible intervals but it is markedly different between the two cases. In some simple standard cases, the intervals produced as confidence and credible intervals from the same data set can be identical. They are very different if informative [[prior information]] is included in the [[Bayesian analysis]]; and may be very different for some parts of the space of possible data even if the Bayesian prior is relatively [[uninformative prior|uninformative]]. ===Desirable properties=== When applying standard statistical procedures, there will often be standard ways of constructing confidence intervals. These will have been devised so as to meet certain desirable properties, which will hold given that the assumptions on which the procedure rely are true. These desirable properties may be described as: validity, optimality and invariance. Of these "validity" is most important, followed closely by "optimality". "Invariance" may be considered as a property of the method of derivation of a confidence interval rather than of the rule for constructing the interval. In non-standard applications, the same desirable properties would be sought. * ''Validity.'' This means that the nominal coverage probability (confidence level) of the confidence interval should hold, either exactly or to a good approximation. * ''Optimality.'' This means that the rule for constructing the confidence interval should make as much use of the information in the data-set as possible. Recall that one could throw away half of a dataset and still be able to derive a valid confidence interval. One way of assessing optimality is by the length of the interval, so that a rule for constructing a confidence interval is judged better than another if it leads to intervals whose lengths are typically shorter. * ''Invariance.'' In many applications the quantity being estimated might not be tightly defined as such. For example, a survey might result in an estimate of the median income in a population, but it might equally be considered as providing an estimate of the logarithm of the median income, given that this is a common scale for presenting graphical results. It would be desirable that the method used for constructing a confidence interval for the median income would give equivalent results when applied to constructing a confidence interval for the logarithm of the median income: specifically the values at the ends of the latter interval would be the logarithms of the values at the ends of former interval. ===Methods of derivation=== For non-standard applications, there are several routes that might be taken to derive a rule for the construction of confidence intervals. Established rules for standard procedures might be justified or explained via several of these routes. Typically a rule for constructing confidence intervals is closely tied to a particular way of finding a [[point estimation|point estimate]] of the quantity being considered. ;Statistics: This is closely related to the [[method of moments (statistics)|method of moments]] for estimation. A simple example arises where the quantity to be estimated is the mean, in which case a natural estimate is the sample mean. The usual arguments indicate that the sample variance can be used to estimate the variance of the sample mean. A naive confidence interval for the true mean can be constructed centered on the sample mean with a width which is a multiple of the square root of the sample variance. ;Likelihood theory: Where estimates are constructed using the [[maximum likelihood principle]], the theory for this provides two ways of constructing confidence intervals or confidence regions for the estimates. ;Estimating equations: The estimation approach here can be considered as both a generalization of the method of moments and a generalization of the maximum likelihood approach. There are corresponding generalizations of the results of maximum likelihood theory that allow confidence intervals to be constructed based on estimates derived from [[estimating equations]]. ;Via [[significance testing]]: If significance tests are available for general values of a parameter, then confidence intervals/regions can be constructed by including in the 100p% confidence region all those points for which the significance test of the null hypothesis that the true value is the given value is not rejected at a significance level of (1-p).<ref name=CH7/> ;[[Bootstrapping (statistics)|Bootstrapping]]: In situations where the distributional assumptions for that above methods are uncertain or violated, resampling methods allow construction of confidence intervals or prediction intervals. The observed data distribution and the internal correlations are used as the surrogate for the correlations in the wider population. ==Examples== ===Practical example=== [[Image:Margarinefilling.png|right]]A machine fills cups with margarine, and is supposed to be adjusted so that the content of the cups is 250 g of margarine. As the machine cannot fill every cup with exactly 250 g, the content added to individual cups shows some variation, and is considered a random variable X. This variation is assumed to be [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] around the desired average of 250 g, with a [[standard deviation]] of 2.5 g. To determine if the machine is adequately calibrated, a sample of ''n'' = 25 cups of margarine is chosen at random and the cups are weighed. The resulting measured masses of margarine are ''X''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''X''<sub>25</sub>, a random sample from ''X''. To get an impression of the expectation μ, it is sufficient to give an estimate. The appropriate [[estimator]] is the sample mean: :<math>\hat \mu=\bar X = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i.</math> The sample shows actual weights ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>25</sub>, with mean: :<math>\bar x=\frac {1}{25} \sum_{i=1}^{25} x_i = 250.2\,\text{grams}.</math> If we take another sample of 25 cups, we could easily expect to find mass values like 250.4 or 251.1 grams. A sample mean value of 280 grams however would be extremely rare if the mean content of the cups is in fact close to 250 grams. There is a whole interval around the observed value 250.2 grams of the sample mean within which, if the whole population mean actually takes a value in this range, the observed data would not be considered particularly unusual. Such an interval is
