The CCTs of the canonical illuminants, D<sub>50</sub>, D<sub>55</sub>, D<sub>65</sub>, and D<sub>75</sub>, differ slightly from what their names suggest. For example, D50 has a CCT of 5003 K ("horizon" light), while [[D65]] has a CCT of 6504 K (noon light). As explained in a previous section, this is because the value of the constants in Planck's law have been slightly changed since the definition of these canonical illuminants, whose SPDs are based on the original values in Planck's law. ===Illuminant E=== Illuminant E is an equal-energy radiator; it has a constant SPD inside the [[visible spectrum]]. It is useful as a theoretical reference; an illuminant that gives equal weight to all wavelengths, presenting an even color. It also has equal [[CIE XYZ]] tristimulus values, thus its chromaticity coordinates are (x,y)=(1/3,1/3). This is by design; the XYZ color matching functions are normalized such that their integrals over the visible spectrum are the same.<ref name=schanda/> [[Image:Planckian-locus.png|thumb|right|Illuminant E is beneath the Planckian locus, and roughly isothermal with D<sub>55</sub>.]] Illuminant E is not a black body, so it does not have a color temperature, but it can be approximated by a D series illuminant with a CCT of 5455 K. (Of the canonical illuminants, D<sub>55</sub> is the closest.) Manufacturers sometimes compare light sources against Illuminant E to calculate the [[colorfulness#Excitation purity|excitation purity]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Philips|title=Optical Testing for SuperFlux, SnapLED and LUXEON Emitters|url=http://www.philipslumileds.com/pdfs/AB08.pdf|quote=CIE has defined the color coordinates of several different white Illuminants, but within Lumileds, CIE Illuminant E is used for all color calculations}}</ref> ===Illuminant series F=== The '''F''' series of illuminants represent various types of [[Fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lighting]]. F1–F6 "standard" fluorescent lamps consist of two semi-broadband emissions of [[antimony]] and [[manganese]] activations in calcium halophosphate [[phosphor]].<ref>For commercial examples of calcium halophosphate fluorescents, see for example {{patent|US|5447660|Method for making a calcium halophosphate phosphor}} or {{patent|US|6666993|Single component calcium halophosphate phosphor}}</ref> F4 is of particular interest since it was used for calibrating the CIE [[Color Rendering Index]] (the CRI formula was chosen such that F4 would have a CRI of 51). F7–F9 are "broadband" ([[full-spectrum light]]) fluorescent lamps with multiple phosphors, and higher CRIs. Finally, F10–F12 are narrow triband illuminants consisting of three "narrowband" emissions (caused by ternary compositions of rare-earth phosphors) in the R,G,B regions of the visible spectrum. The phosphor weights can be tuned to achieve the desired CCT. The spectra of these illuminants are published in Publication 15:2004.<ref name=cie2004>{{cite book|author=CIE Technical Report|year=2004|title=Colorimetry|edition=3rd|series=Publication 15:2004|publisher=CIE Central Bureau, Vienna|isbn=3 901 906 33 9|url=http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/15-2004.html}}</ref><ref>[http://www.cis.rit.edu/mcsl/online/CIE/Fluorescents.htm Spectral power distribution of Illuminants Series F] ([http://www.cis.rit.edu/mcsl/online/CIE/Fluorescents.xls Excel]), in 5 nm increments from 380 to 780 nm.</ref> <gallery widths=200px heights=175px> Image:CIE illuminants F 1 to 6.svg|'''FL 1–6''': Standard Image:CIE illuminants F 7-9.svg|'''FL 7–9''': Broadband Image:CIE illuminants F 10-12.svg|'''FL 10–12''': Narrowband </gallery> ==White point== {{main|White point}} The spectrum of a standard illuminant, like any other profile of light, can be converted into [[tristimulus value]]s. The set of three tristimulus coordinates of an illuminant is called a ''white point''. If the profile is [[Normalizing constant|normalised]], then the white point can equivalently be expressed as a pair of [[chromaticity coordinate]]s. If an image is recorded in tristimulus coordinates (or in values which can be converted to and from them), then the white point of the illuminant used gives the maximum value of the tristimulus coordinates that will be recorded at any point in the image, in the absence of [[fluorescence]]. It is called the white point of the image. The process of calculating the white point discards a great deal of information about the profile of the illuminant, and so although it is true that for every illuminant the exact white point can be calculated, it is not the case that knowing the white point of an image alone tells you a great deal about the illuminant that was used to record it.
