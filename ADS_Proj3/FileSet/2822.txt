Liddell and Scott, ''s.voce''μαθηματικός</ref> Its adjective is {{lang|el|μαθηματικός}} (''mathēmatikós''), ''related to learning'', or ''studious'', which likewise further came to mean ''mathematical''. In particular, {{polytonic|μαθηματικὴ τέχνη}} (''mathēmatikḗ tékhnē''), {{lang-la|ars mathematica}}, meant ''the mathematical art''. The apparent plural form in English, like the French plural form {{lang|fr|''les mathématiques''}} (and the less commonly used singular derivative {{lang|fr|''la mathématique''}}), goes back to the Latin neuter plural {{lang|la|''mathematica''}} ([[Cicero]]), based on the Greek plural {{lang|el|τα μαθηματικά (''ta mathēmatiká'')}}, used by [[Aristotle]], and meaning roughly "all things mathematical"; although it is plausible that English borrowed only the adjective ''mathematic(al)'' and formed the noun ''mathematics'' anew, after the pattern of [[physics]] and [[metaphysics]], which were inherited from the Greek.<ref>''[[The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology]]'', ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', ''sub'' "mathematics", "mathematic", "mathematics"</ref> In English, the noun ''mathematics'' takes singular verb forms.

Wilder, ''Evolution of Mathematical Concepts; an Elementary Study'', ''passim''</ref> [[Elementary arithmetic]] ([[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]]) naturally followed.

More complex mathematics did not appear until around 3000 BC, when the [[Babylonian]]s and Egyptians began using arithmetic, algebra and geometry for [[taxation]] and other financial calculations, for building and construction, and for [[astronomy]].<ref>Kline 1990, Chapter 1.</ref> The systematic study of mathematics in its own right began with the [[Ancient Greeks]] between 600 and 300 BC.<ref>"''[http://books.google.com/books?id=drnY3Vjix3kC&pg=PA1&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false A History of Greek Mathematics: From Thales to Euclid]''".

Mathematical discoveries continue to be made today. According to Mikhail B. Sevryuk, in the January 2006 issue of the ''[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]]'', "The number of papers and books included in the [[Mathematical Reviews]] database since 1940 (the first year of operation of MR) is now more than 1.9 million, and more than 75 thousand items are added to the database each year.

At first these were found in [[commerce]], [[land measurement]], [[architecture]] and later [[astronomy]]; nowadays, all sciences suggest problems studied by mathematicians, and many problems arise within mathematics itself. For example, the [[physicist]] [[Richard Feynman]] invented the [[path integral formulation]] of [[quantum mechanics]] using a combination of mathematical reasoning and physical insight, and today's [[string theory]], a still-developing scientific theory which attempts to unify the four [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental forces of nature]], continues to inspire new mathematics.<ref>{{cite book | title = The Feynman Integral and Feynman's Operational Calculus | author = Johnson, Gerald W.; Lapidus, Michel L. | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 2002 | isbn = 0821824139}}</ref> Some mathematics is only relevant in the area that inspired it, and is applied to solve further problems in that area. But often mathematics inspired by one area proves useful in many areas, and joins the general stock of mathematical concepts. A distinction is often made between [[pure mathematics]] and [[applied mathematics]]. However pure mathematics topics often turn out to have applications, e.g. [[number theory]] in [[cryptography]]. This remarkable fact that even the "purest" mathematics often turns out to have practical applications is what [[Eugene Wigner]] has called "[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences|the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics]]".<ref>Eugene Wigner, 1960, "[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences,]" ''[[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]]'' '''13'''(1): 1–14.</ref> As in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization: there are now hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the latest [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] runs to 46 pages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classification2010.pdf |title=Mathematics Subject Classification 2010 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}</ref> Several areas of applied mathematics have merged with related traditions outside of mathematics and become disciplines in their own right, including [[statistics]], [[operations research]], and [[computer science]]. For those who are mathematically inclined, there is often a definite aesthetic aspect to much of mathematics. Many mathematicians talk about the ''elegance'' of mathematics, its intrinsic [[aesthetics]] and inner [[beauty]]. [[Simplicity]] and generality are valued. There is beauty in a simple and elegant [[proof (mathematics)|proof]], such as [[Euclid]]'s proof that there are infinitely many [[prime number]]s, and in an elegant [[numerical method]] that speeds calculation, such as the [[fast Fourier transform]]. [[G. H. Hardy]] in ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]'' expressed the belief that these aesthetic considerations are, in themselves, sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics. He identified criteria such as significance, unexpectedness, inevitability, and economy as factors
