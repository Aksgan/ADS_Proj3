In November 2009, in another joint venture with Andrew Martin<ref>[http://www.martinsecurity.net/2009/11/17/introducing-malfi-another-report-from-hostexploit/ "Introducing MalFI – Another Report From HostExploit"]</ref> and Scott Logan, Jart Armin and HostExploit released a report called "MALfi, A Cybercrime International Report - A Silent Threat".<ref>[http://hostexploit.com/downloads/view.download/4/15.html "MALfi, A Cybercrime International Report"] - HostExploit Report</ref> The report describes how hackers and cybercriminals use blended attacks - a combination of [[Remote File Inclusion|RFI (remote file inclusion)]], [[Local File Inclusion|LFI (local file inclusion)]], [[XSA|XSA (cross-server attack)]], and [[Remote code execution|RCE (remote code execution)]] - to compromise websites and servers.

The best performing hosts are noted using the same criteria. In August 2010, Armin and the HostExploit team released a report<ref>[http://hostexploit.com/downloads/view.download/4/26.html "Demand Media/eNom Report – Cybercrime USA"] - HostExploit Report</ref> providing an analysis of [[Demand Media|Demand Media's]] persistent position as "No 1 Bad Host" in HostExploit’s Top 50 Bad Hosts list. ==Other considerations== Armin has spoken to audiences at [[Cambridge University]] and [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]], among others.

ROVs are unoccupied, highly maneuverable and operated by a person aboard a surface vessel. They are linked to the ship by a tether, a group of cables that carry electrical signals back and forth between the operator and the vehicle. Built and operated by the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]], ''Jason'' is equipped with sonar imaging as well as video, still, and electronic cameras and appropriate lighting gear. It carries precision navigation equipment and sensors for depth, vehicle attitude
