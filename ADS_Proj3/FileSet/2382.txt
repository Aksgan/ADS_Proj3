are systematically subjected to the most rigorous attempts at falsification possible. This process, error elimination (<math>EE</math>), performs a similar function for science that [[natural selection]] performs for [[biological evolution]]. Theories that better survive the process of refutation are not more true, but rather, more "fit"&mdash;in other words, more applicable to the problem situation at hand (<math>PS_1</math>). Consequently, just as a species' biological fitness does not ensure continued survival, neither does rigorous testing protect a scientific theory from refutation in the future. Yet, as it appears that the engine of biological evolution has produced, over time, adaptive traits equipped to deal with more and more complex problems of survival, likewise, the evolution of theories through the scientific method may, in Popper's view, reflect a certain type of progress: toward more and more ''interesting problems'' (<math>PS_2</math>). For Popper, it is in the interplay between the tentative theories (conjectures) and error elimination (refutation) that scientific knowledge advances toward greater and greater problems; in a process very much akin to the interplay between genetic variation and natural selection. Where does "truth" fit into all this? As early as 1934 Popper wrote of the search for truth as "''one of the strongest motives for scientific discovery.''" Still, he describes in ''Objective Knowledge'' (1972) early concerns about the much-criticized notion of [[Correspondence theory of truth|truth as correspondence]]. Then came the [[semantic theory of truth]] formulated by the logician [[Alfred Tarski]] and published in 1933. Popper writes of learning in 1935 of the consequences of Tarski's theory, to his intense joy. The theory met critical objections to [[truth]] as correspondence and thereby rehabilitated it. The theory also seemed, in Popper's eyes, to support [[metaphysical realism]] and the ''regulative'' idea of a search for truth. According to this theory, the conditions for the truth of a sentence as well as the sentences themselves are part of a [[metalanguage]]. So, for example, the sentence "Snow is white" is true if and only if snow is white. Although many philosophers have interpreted, and continue to interpret, Tarski's theory as a [[Deflationary theory of truth|deflationary theory]], Popper refers to it as a theory in which "is true" is replaced with "[[correspondence theory|corresponds to the facts]]". He bases this interpretation on the fact that examples such as the one described above refer to two things: assertions and ''the facts'' to which they refer. He identifies Tarski's formulation of the truth conditions of sentences as the introduction of a "metalinguistic predicate" and distinguishes the following cases: # "John called" is true. # "It is true that John called." The first case belongs to the metalanguage whereas the second is more likely to belong to the object language. Hence, "it is true that" possesses the logical status of a redundancy. "Is true", on the other hand, is a predicate necessary for making general observations such as "John was telling the truth about Phillip." Upon this basis, along with that of the logical content of assertions (where logical content is inversely proportional to probability), Popper went on to develop his important notion of [[verisimilitude]] or "truthlikeness". The intuitive idea behind verisimilitude is that the assertions or hypotheses of scientific theories can be objectively measured with respect to the amount of truth and falsity that they imply. And, in this way, one theory can be evaluated as more or less true than another on a quantitative basis which, Popper emphasizes forcefully, has nothing to do with "subjective probabilities" or other merely "epistemic" considerations. The simplest mathematical formulation that Popper gives of this concept can be found in the tenth chapter of ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]''. Here he defines it as: : <math>Vs(a)=CT_v(a)-CT_f(a) \,</math> where <math>Vs(a)</math> is the verisimilitude of ''a'', <math>CT_v(a)</math> is a measure of the content of truth of ''a'', and <math>CT_f(a)</math> is a measure of the content of the falsity of ''a''. Knowledge, for Popper, was ''objective'', both in the sense that it is objectively true (or truthlike), and also in the sense that knowledge has an ontological status (i.e., knowledge as object) independent of the knowing subject (''Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach'', 1972). He proposed three worlds (see [[Popperian cosmology]]): World One, being the physical world, or physical states; World Two, being the world of mind, or mental states, ideas, and perceptions; and World Three, being the body of human knowledge expressed in its manifold forms, or the products of the second world made manifest in the materials of the first world (i.e.&ndash;books, papers, paintings, symphonies, and all the products of the human mind). World Three, he argued, was the product of individual human beings in exactly the same sense that an animal path is the product of individual animals, and that, as such, has an existence and evolution independent of any individual knowing subjects. The influence of World Three, in his view, on the individual human mind (World Two) is at least as strong as the influence of World One. In other words, the knowledge held by a given individual mind owes at least as much to the total accumulated wealth of human knowledge, made manifest, as to the world of direct experience. As such, the growth of human knowledge could be said to be a function of the independent evolution of World Three. Many contemporary philosophers have not embraced Popper's Three World conjecture, due mostly, it seems, to its resemblance to [[Cartesian dualism]]. === Political philosophy === {{Liberalism sidebar}} In ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' and ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'', Popper developed a critique of [[historicism]] and a defence of the 'Open Society'. Popper considered historicism to be the theory that history develops inexorably and necessarily according to knowable general laws towards a determinate end. He argued that this view is the principal theoretical presupposition underpinning most forms of [[authoritarianism]] and [[totalitarianism]]. He argued that historicism is founded upon mistaken assumptions regarding the nature of scientific law and prediction. Since the growth of human knowledge is a causal factor in the evolution of human history, and since "no society can predict,
