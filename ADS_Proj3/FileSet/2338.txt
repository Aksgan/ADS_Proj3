[[Werner Heisenberg]] and the [[wave mechanics|wave mechanical formulation]] due to [[Erwin Schrödinger]], but there was not yet a single, unified satisfactory theoretical formulation. After having completed the axiomatization of set theory, von Neumann began to confront the axiomatization of quantum mechanics. He immediately realized, in 1926, that a quantum system could be considered as a point in a so-called [[Hilbert space]], analogous to the 6N dimension (N is the number of particles, 3 general coordinate and 3 canonical momentum for each) phase space of classical mechanics but with infinitely many dimensions (corresponding to the infinitely many possible states of the system) instead: the traditional physical quantities (e.g., position and momentum) could therefore be represented as particular [[linear operators]] operating in these spaces. The ''physics'' of quantum mechanics was thereby reduced to the ''mathematics'' of the linear Hermitian operators on Hilbert spaces. For example, the famous [[uncertainty principle]] of Heisenberg, according to which the determination of the position of a particle prevents the determination of its momentum and vice versa, is translated into the ''non-commutativity'' of the two corresponding operators. This new mathematical formulation included as special cases the formulations of both Heisenberg and Schrödinger, and culminated in the 1932 classic ''[[The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics]].'' However, physicists generally ended up preferring another approach to that of von Neumann (which was considered elegant and satisfactory by mathematicians). This approach was formulated in 1930 by [[Paul Dirac]]. Von Neumann's abstract treatment permitted him also to confront the foundational issue of determinism vs. non-determinism and in the book he demonstrated a theorem according to which quantum mechanics could not possibly be derived by statistical approximation from a deterministic theory of the type used in classical mechanics. This demonstration contained a conceptual error{{Clarification needed|date=October 2010}}, but it helped to inaugurate a line of research which, through the work of [[John Stuart Bell]] in 1964 on [[Bell's Theorem]] and the experiments of [[Alain Aspect]] in 1982, demonstrated that quantum physics requires a ''notion of reality'' substantially different from that of classical physics. ==Economics and game theory== Von Neumann's first significant contribution to economics was the [[minimax theorem]] of 1928. This theorem establishes that in certain [[zero-sum|zero sum games]] with [[perfect information]] (i.e., in which players know at each time all moves that have taken place so far), there exists a strategy for each player which allows both players to minimize their maximum losses (hence the name minimax). When examining every possible strategy, a player must consider all the possible responses of the player's adversary and the maximum loss. The player then plays out the strategy which will result in the minimization of this maximum loss. Such a strategy, which minimizes the maximum loss, is called optimal for both players just in case their minimaxes are equal (in absolute value) and contrary (in sign). If the common value is zero, the game becomes pointless. Von Neumann eventually improved and extended the minimax theorem to include games involving imperfect information and games with more than two players. This work culminated in the 1944 classic ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'' (written with [[Oskar Morgenstern]]). The public interest in this work was such that [[The New York Times]] ran a front page story, something which only [[Einstein]] had previously elicited. Von Neumann's second important contribution in this area was the solution, in 1937, of a problem first described by [[Léon Walras]] in 1874, the existence of situations of equilibrium in mathematical models of market development based on supply and demand. He first recognized that such a model should be expressed through [[disequations]] and not equations, and then he found a solution to Walras' problem by applying a [[fixed-point theorem]] derived from the work of [[L. E. J. Brouwer]]. The lasting importance of the work on general equilibria and the methodology of fixed point theorems is underscored by the awarding of Nobel prizes in 1972 to [[Kenneth Arrow]], in 1983 to [[Gérard Debreu]], and in 1994 to [[John Forbes Nash, Jr.|John Nash]] who had improved von Neumann's theory in his Princeton Ph.D thesis. Von Neumann was also the inventor of the method of proof, used in game theory, known as [[backward induction]] (which he first published in 1944 in the book co-authored with Morgenstern, ''Theory of Games and Economic Behaviour'').<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Projects/MacQuarrie/Chapters/Ch4.html | title=Mathematics and Chess | author=John MacQuarrie | publisher=School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews, Scotland | accessdate=2007-10-18 | quote=Others claim he used a method of proof, known as 'backwards induction' that was not employed until 1953, by von Neumann and Morgenstern. Ken Binmore (1992) writes, Zermelo used this method way back in 1912 to analyze Chess. It requires starting from the end of the game and then working backwards to its beginning.
