Dr. Eggman is a rotund, mad scientist with an [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] of 300 who plans to conquer the world in order to build his Eggman Empire and is the evil [[archenemy]] of [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]. His character designer is [[Naoto Ōshima]], and while he has gone through several large appearance changes throughout the series, his design retains several basic characteristics, such as his egg-shaped body and his large mustache. Beside his scientific skilled mind, he is very immature and often tends to throw a temper tantrum mostly whenever his plans fail. He has appeared in almost every ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' game since his first appeareance and has appeared in all other Sonic media, including comics, TV series, and a feature film. ==Concept and inspiration== [[Image:Oldrobotnik.jpg|120px|left|thumb|Doctor Eggman's original design.]] In April 1990, Sega commissioned its [[Sonic Team|AM8]] [[research and development|R&D]] department to create a character who would replace [[Alex Kidd]] as the company's [[mascot]], as well as compete against Nintendo's flagship character, [[Mario]]. A [[caricature]] of [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was among the proposed designs, and combined with the idea of an egg-shaped character, it eventually became the basis of the visual design for Dr. Robotnik/Eggman.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite journal |url=http://info.sonicretro.org/Yuji_Naka_interview_by_Sega_Visions |title=Sega Visions Interview with Yuji Naka |year=1992 |month=August/September |journal= [[Sega Visions]] |accessdate=2008-08-30}}</ref> In creating the "bad guy" for the ''Sonic'' series, the development team wanted a character who was "the opposite of Sonic;" a character who represented "machinery" and "development" to play on the then-growing debate between developers and environmentalists.<ref name="Naka interview 96">{{cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/19970605172353/www.sega.com/features/allsonic/creator/naka04.html |title=Sonic's Creator - Yuji Naka|accessdate=2008-08-28 }}</ref> The character was also designed to be easy for children to draw.<ref name="Naka interview 96"/> The English instruction manual for his 1991 debut game ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' described the character's full name as "Doctor Ivo Robotnik"<ref name="Sonic 1 16bit story"/> while the original Japanese version's instruction manual for the same game called him "Doctor Eggman".<ref name="Sonic 1 16bit story JPN">Sega (1991).
