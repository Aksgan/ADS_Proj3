of them in half (according to volume) with a single (''n'' &minus; 1)-dimensional [[hyperplane]]. Here the "objects" should be [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] of [[finite set|finite]] [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] (or, in fact, just of finite [[outer measure]]) for the notion of "dividing the volume in half" to make sense. ==Naming== The ham sandwich theorem takes its name from the case when ''n'' = 3 and the three objects of any shape are a chunk of [[ham (meat)|ham]] and two chunks of [[bread]] &mdash; notionally, a [[sandwich]] &mdash; which can then each be bisected with a single cut (i.e., a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]]). In two dimensions, the theorem is known as the '''pancake theorem''' of having to cut two infinitesimally thin [[pancake]]s on a plate each in half with a single cut (i.e., a straight [[line (mathematics)|line]]). The ham sandwich theorem is also sometimes referred to as the "ham and cheese sandwich theorem", again referring to the special case when ''n'' = 3 and the three objects are # a chunk of [[ham (meat)|ham]], # a slice of [[cheese]], and # two slices of [[bread]] (treated as a single [[disconnected set|disconnected]] object). The theorem then states that it is possible to slice the ham and cheese sandwich in half such that each half contains the same amount of bread, cheese, and ham. It is possible to treat the two slices of bread as a single object, because the theorem only requires that the portion on each side of the plane vary continuously as the plane moves through 3-space. The ham sandwich theorem has no relationship to the "[[squeeze theorem]]" (sometimes called the "sandwich theorem"). ==History== According to Beyer and Zardecki (2004), the earliest known paper about the ham sandwich theorem, specifically the ''d'' = 3 case of bisecting three solids with a plane, is by Steinhaus and others (1938). Beyer and Zardecki's paper includes a translation of the 1938 paper. It attributes the posing of the problem to [[Hugo Steinhaus]], and credits [[Stefan Banach]] as the first to solve the problem, by a reduction to the [[Borsuk–Ulam theorem]]. The paper poses the problem in two ways: first, formally, as "Is it always possible to bisect three solids, arbitrarily located, with the aid of an appropriate plane?" and second, informally, as "Can we place a piece of ham under a meat cutter so that meat, bone, and fat are cut in halves?" Later, the paper offers a proof of the theorem. A more modern reference is Stone and Tukey (1942), which is the basis of the name "Stone–Tukey theorem". This paper proves the ''n''-dimensional version of the theorem in a more general setting involving measures. The paper attributes the ''n'' = 3 case to [[Stanisław Marcin Ulam]], based on information from a referee; but Beyer & Zardecki (2004) claim that this is incorrect, given Steinhaus's paper, although "Ulam did make a fundamental contribution in proposing" the [[Borsuk–Ulam theorem]]. ==Reduction to the Borsuk–Ulam theorem== The ham sandwich theorem can be proved as follows using the [[Borsuk–Ulam theorem]]. This proof follows the one described by Steinhaus and others (1938), attributed there to [[Stefan Banach]], for the ''n'' = 3 case. Let ''A''<sub>1</sub>, ''A''<sub>2</sub>, …, ''A''<sub>''n''</sub> denote the ''n'' objects that we wish to simultaneously bisect. Let ''S'' be the [[unit sphere|unit]] [[n-sphere|(''n'' &minus; 1)-sphere]] embedded in ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] <math>\mathbb{R}^n</math>, centered at the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]]. For each point ''p'' on the surface of the sphere ''S'', we can define a [[Continuum (mathematics)|continuum]] of oriented affine [[hyperplane]]s (not necessarily centred at 0) perpendicular to the ([[Surface normal|normal]]) [[vector (geometric)|vector]] from the origin to ''p'', with the "positive side" of each hyperplane defined as the side pointed to by that vector. By the [[intermediate value theorem]], every family of such hyperplanes contains at least one hyperplane that bisects the bounded object ''A''<sub>''n''</sub>: at one extreme translation, no volume of ''A''<sub>''n''</sub> is on the positive side, and at the other extreme translation, all of ''A''<sub>''n''</sub>'s volume is on the positive side, so in between there must be a translation that has half of ''A''<sub>''n''</sub>'s volume on the positive side. If there is more than one such hyperplane in the family, we can pick one canonically by choosing the midpoint of the interval of translations for which ''A''<sub>''n''</sub> is bisected. Thus we obtain, for each point ''p'' on the sphere ''S'', a hyperplane π(''p'') that is perpendicular to the vector from the origin to ''p'' and that bisects ''A''<sub>''n''</sub>. Now we define a function ''ƒ'' from the (''n'' &minus; 1)-sphere ''S'' to (''n'' &minus; 1)-dimensional Euclidean space <math>\mathbb{R}^{n-1}</math> as follows: :''&fnof;''(''p'') = (vol of ''A''<sub>1</sub> on the positive side of &pi;(''p''), vol of ''A''<sub>2</sub> on the positive side of &pi;(''p''), ..., vol of ''A''<sub>''n''&minus;1</sub> on the positive side of &pi;(''p'')). This function ''ƒ'' is [[continuous function|continuous]]. By the [[Borsuk–Ulam theorem]], there are [[antipodal points]] ''p'' and ''q'' on the sphere ''S'' such that ''ƒ''(''p'') = ''ƒ''(''q''). Antipodal points ''p'' and ''q'' correspond to hyperplanes π(''p'') and π(''q'') that are equal except that they have opposite positive sides. Thus, ''ƒ''(''p'') = ''ƒ''(''q'') means that the volume of ''A''<sub>''i''</sub> is the same on the positive and negative side of π(''p'') (or π(''q'')), for ''i'' = 1, 2, ..., ''n'' &minus; 1. Thus, π(''p'') (or π(''q'')) is the desired ham sandwich cut that simultaneously bisects the volumes of ''A''<sub>1</sub>, ''A''<sub>2</sub>, …, ''A''<sub>''n''</sub>. ==Measure theoretic versions== In [[measure theory]], Stone and Tukey (1942) proved two more general forms of the ham sandwich theorem. Both versions concern the bisection of ''n'' [[subset]]s ''X''<sub>1</sub>, ''X''<sub>2</sub>, …, ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> of a common set ''X'', where ''X'' has a [[Carathéodory]] [[outer measure]] and each ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> has [[finite]] outer measure. Their first general formulation is as follows: for any suitably restricted real [[function (mathematics)|function]] <math>f : S^n \times X \to \mathbb{R}</math>, there is a point ''p'' of the ''n''-[[sphere]] <math>S^n</math> such that the surface <math>f(s,x) = 0</math>, dividing ''X'' into <math>f(s,x) < 0</math> and <math>f(s,x) > 0</math>, simultaneously bisects the outer measure of ''X''<sub>1</sub>, ''X''<sub>2</sub>, …, ''X''<sub>''n''</sub>. The proof is again a
