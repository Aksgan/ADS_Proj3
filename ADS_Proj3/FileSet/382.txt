to its [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth in hertz]], which is sometimes called ''frequency bandwidth'', ''spectral bandwidth'', ''[[radio frequency|RF]] bandwidth'', ''signal bandwidth'' or ''analog bandwidth''. ==Network bandwidth consumption== In computer networking, ''bandwidth'' in bit/s may also refer to consumed bandwidth, corresponding to achieved [[throughput]] or [[goodput]], i.e., the average rate of successful data transfer through a communication path. This sense applies to expressions such as [[bandwidth shaping]], [[bandwidth management]], [[bandwidth throttling]], [[bandwidth cap]], [[bandwidth allocation]] (for example [[bandwidth allocation protocol]] and [[dynamic bandwidth allocation]]), etc. A bit stream's bandwidth is proportional to the average consumed signal bandwidth in Hertz (the average spectral bandwidth of the analog signal representing the bit stream) during a studied time interval. ==Multimedia bandwidth== Digital bandwidth may also refer to: [[bit rate#Multimedia bit rate|multimedia bit rate]] or [[average bitrate]] after multimedia [[data compression]] ([[source coding]]), defined as the total amount of data divided by the playback time. == Bandwidth in web hosting == In [[Web hosting service|website hosting]], the term "bandwidth" is often incorrectly used to describe the amount of data transferred to or from the website or server within a prescribed period of time, for example ''bandwidth consumption accumulated over a month'' measured in gigabytes per month. The more accurate phrase used for this meaning of a maximum amount of data transfer each month or given period is ''monthly data transfer''.. == Internet connection bandwidths == This table shows the maximum bandwidth (the physical layer [[net bitrate]]) of common Internet access technologies.

Its significant advancement in recent years has led to the technology being adopted commercially in several areas including [[Psychoacoustics|psychacoustic]] bass enhancement of small [[loudspeaker]]s and the high frequency enhancement of coded speech and audio. Bandwidth extension has been used in both speech and audio compression applications. The algorithms used in [[G.729.1]] and Spectral Band Replication (SBR) are two of many examples of bandwidth extension algorithms currently in use. In these methods, the low band of the spectrum is encoded using an existing codec, whereas the high band is coarsely parameterized using fewer parameters. Many of these bandwidth extension algorithms make use of the correlation between the low band and the high band in order to predict the wider band signal from extracted lower-band features. Others encode the high band using very few bits. This is often sufficient since the ear is less sensitive to distortions in the high band compared to the low band. == Bass Enhancement of Small Loudspeakers == Most often small loudspeakers are physically incapable of reproducing low frequency material. Using a psycho-acoustical phenomenon like the [[missing fundamental]], perception of low frequencies can be greatly increased. By generating harmonics of lower frequencies and removing the lower frequencies themselves the suggestion is created that these frequencies are still remaining in the signal. This process is usually applied through external equipment or embedded in the speaker system using a digital signal processor. High frequency response can also be enhanced through generation of harmonics. Instead of mapping frequencies inside the reproducible region of the speaker, the speaker itself is used to generate frequencies outside the normal reproducible region. By boosting high frequencies and overdriving the speaker or amplifier slightly, higher harmonics can be generated. == Bandwidth Extension of Speech in telephone systems == Telephone speech signals are usually very degraded in quality. Part of this degradation is due to the limited bandwidth used in the telephone systems. In most systems frequencies lower than 250 Hz are cut and bandwidth only extends to frequencies of 4 or 8 kHz. Using filtering and waveshaping low and high frequency response can be extended. By low pass filtering the lowest octave and half-wave rectifying a waveform is created with a fundamental half of the original frequency. Due to the discontinuity in the waveform low pass filtering is needed to filter all harmonics. Using such a [[subharmonic synthesizer]] the essential frequency band between 125 - 250 Hz is recreated, adding weight to the signal. We can Isolate the top octave using high pass filters and generating harmonics extends high frequency bandwidth. The generation of harmonics can be done through a simple full wave rectification, which is computationally cheap and not amplitude-dependent. As an alternative [[single-sideband modulation]] can be used, giving precise control over the number and amplitude of the harmonics. In theory envelope estimation can be used to extract the original high frequency envelope and regenerating high frequencies using a noise source. The sparse information available in the small bandwidth will probably be too limited to extract a proper envelope. == Bandwidth
