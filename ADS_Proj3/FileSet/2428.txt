accepts his ironic etymology from a fictional "Fink and Wiggles" for [[Funk & Wagnalls]] lexicographer. <blockquote>A phone call to Phineas Burling can be revealing. Phineas Burling is the Chief calligrapher with the Fink and Wiggles Publishing Company, Inc. Fink and Wiggles are, of course, the well known publishers of the NEW MULTILINGUAL DICTIONARY. According to Burling, the word "kludge" first appeared in the English language in the early fifteen-hundreds. It was imported into the geographic region of the lowlands between King's Lynn (then Bishop's Lynn) and the Isle of Ely by Dutch settlers arriving there to reclaim tidelands of the Wash as rutabaga fields. … <br> The word "kludge" is, according to Burling, derived from the same root as the German "klug" (Dutch ''kloog'', Swedish ''Klag'', Danish ''Klog'', Gothic ''Klaugen'', Lettish ''Kladnis'' and Sanskrit ''Veklaunn''), originally meaning "smart" or "witty". In the typical machinations of language in evolutionary growth, the word "Kludge" eventually came to mean "not so smart" or "pretty ridiculous". Today the leading definition given by the NEW MULTILINGUAL is, "An ill-assorted collection of poorly-matching parts, forming a distressing whole." <br> It is in this latter sense that "Kludge" is used by computer hardware men. Today "kludge" forms one of the most beloved words in design terminology, and it stands ready for handy application to the work of anyone who gins up 110-volt circuitry to plug into the 220 VAC source. The building of a Kludge, however, is not work for amateurs. There is a certain, indefinable, masochistic finesse that must go into true Kludge building. The professional can spot it instantly. The amateur may readily presume that "that's the way computers are".<ref>{{cite book |title=How to Design a Kludge |author=Jackson W. Granholm |publisher=Datamation |year=February 1962 |pages=30–31 |url= http://neil.franklin.ch/Jokes_and_Fun/Kludge.html}}</ref></blockquote> This ''OED2'' entry also includes the verbal '''kludge''' "to improvise with a kludge or kludges" and '''kludgemanship''' "skill in designing or applying kludges". The [[Jargon File]] (a.k.a. ''The New Hacker's Dictionary''), which is a [[glossary]] of [[internet slang]] maintained by [[Eric S. Raymond]], differentiates ''kludge'' from ''kluge'' and cites usage examples predating 1962. <blockquote>'''kludge''' <br> 1. /kluhj/ n. Incorrect (though regrettably common) spelling of ''kluge'' (US). These two words have been confused in American usage since the early 1960s, and widely confounded in Great Britain since the end of World War II.<br> 2. [TMRC] A ''crock'' that works. (A long-ago ''Datamation'' article by Jackson Granholme [sic] similarly said: "An ill-assorted collection of poorly matching parts, forming a distressing whole.") <br> 3. v. To use a kludge to get around a problem. "I've kludged around it for now, but I'll fix it up properly later."<ref name="jargon">{{cite web |title=The Jargon File |author=Eric S. Raymond |url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/K/kludge.html |accessdate=2010-11-02}}</ref> </blockquote> This Jargon File entry notes ''kludge'' apparently derives via British military slang from [[Scots language|Scots]] ''kludge'' or ''kludgie'' meaning "a common toilet", and became confused with U.S. ''kluge'' during or after World War II. <blockquote>'''kluge''': /klooj/ [from the German 'klug', clever; poss. related to Polish & Russian 'klucz' (a key, a hint, a main point)] <br> 1. n. A [[Rube Goldberg]] (or [[Heath Robinson]]) device, whether in hardware or software. <br> 2. n. A clever programming trick intended to solve a particular nasty case in an expedient, if not clear, manner. Often used to repair bugs. Often involves ad-hockery and verges on being a crock. <br> 3. n. Something that works for the wrong reason. <br> 4. vt. To insert a kluge into a program. "I've kluged this routine to get around that weird bug, but there's probably a better way." <br> 5. [WPI] n. A feature that is implemented in a rude manner.<ref name="jargon"/> </blockquote> This entry notes ''kluge'', which is now often spelled ''kludge'', "was the original spelling, reported around computers as far back as the mid-1950s and, at that time, used exclusively of hardware kluges". The Jargon File gives possible etymologies from [[navy|naval]] slang (cf. [[jury rig]]) or printing equipment. First, ''kluge'' "was common Navy slang in the WWII era for any piece of electronics that worked well on shore but consistently failed at sea". A 1947 article in the ''New York Folklore Quarterly'' recorded the classic [[shaggy dog story]] "'Murgatroyd the Kluge Maker' then current in the Armed Forces, in which a 'kluge' was a complex and puzzling artifact with a trivial function."<ref>{{cite book |title=Folklore from G. I. Joe, New York Folklore Quarterly |volume=III, No. 4 |pages=285–297 |author=Agnes Nolan Underwood |date=Winter 1947 |publisher=New York Folklore Society}}</ref> When Murgatroyd enlists into the Navy, he gives "kluge maker" as his occupation. Because none of the officers knows what a kluge is, Murgatroyd ascends through the ranks, eventually becoming "kluge maker, first class". When an admiral demands that Murgatroyd build him a kluge, he constructs a strange object with springs in all directions. He then drops it over the side of the ship into the ocean, where it goes "kkluuge". Second, the "Kluge paper feeder" was an automatic paper feeder for [[printing press]]es, which was first manufactured by [[Brandtjen and Kluge]] in 1919. It supposedly had a [[Rube Goldberg machine]] reputation, and was "temperamental, subject to frequent breakdowns, and devilishly difficult to repair — but oh, so clever!" The Jargon File further includes '''kluge around''' "to avoid a bug or difficult condition by inserting a kluge", '''kluge up''' "to lash together a quick hack to perform a task". After Granholm's 1962 "How to Design a Kludge" article popularized the ''kluge'' variant ''kludge'', both were interchangeably used and confused. The Jargon File concludes: <blockquote>The result of this history is a tangle. Many younger U.S. hackers pronounce the word as /klooj/ but spell it, incorrectly for its meaning and pronunciation, as 'kludge'. … British hackers mostly learned /kluhj/ orally, use it in a restricted negative sense and are at least consistent. European hackers have mostly learned the word from written American sources and tend to pronounce it /kluhj/ but use the wider American meaning! Some observers consider this mess appropriate in view of the word's meaning. </blockquote> Other suggested [[folk etymologies]] or [[backronyms]] for ''kludge'' or
