Voiculescu, K. Dykema, A. Nica, "Free Random Variables", CIRM Monograph Series, AMS, Providence, RI, 1992</ref>. The definition of free independence is parallel to the classical definition of [[independence (probability)|independence]], except that the role of Cartesian products of [[measure space]]s (corresponding to [[tensor product]]s of their function algebras) is played by the notion of a [[free product]] of (non-commutative) probability spaces. In the context of Voiculescu's free probability theory, many classical-probability theorems or phenomena have free probability analogs: the same theorem or phenomenon holds (perhaps with slight modifications) if the classical notion of independence is replaced by free independence. Examples of this include: the free central limit theorem; notions of [[free convolution]]; existence of [[free stochastic calculus]] and so on. Let <math>(A,\phi)</math> be a non-commutative probability space, i.e. a unital algebra <math>A</math> over <math>\mathbb{C}</math> equipped with a unital linear functional <math>\phi:A\to\mathbb{C}</math>. As an example, one could take, for a probability measure <math>\mu</math>, : <math>A = L^\infty(\mathbb{R},\mu),\phi(f) = \int f(t)\,d\mu(t).</math> Another example may be <math>A=M_N</math>, the algebra of <math>N\times N</math> matrices with the functional given by the normalized trace <math>\phi=\frac{1}{N}Tr</math>. Even more generally, <math>A</math> could be a [[von Neumann algebra]] and <math>\phi</math> a state on <math>A</math>. A final example is the [[group algebra]] <math>A=\mathbb{C}\Gamma</math> of a (discrete) [[group]] <math>\Gamma</math> with the functional <math>\phi</math> given by the group trace <math>\phi (g) = \delta_{g=e},g\in \Gamma</math>. Let <math>\{A_i : i\in I\}</math> be a family of unital subalgebras of <math>A</math>. '''Definition'''. The family <math>\{A_i : i\in I\}</math> is called ''freely independent'' if <math>\phi(x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n) =0 </math> whenever <math>\phi(x_j)=0</math>, <math>x_j \in A_{i(j)}</math> and <math>i(1)\neq i(2), i(2)\neq i(3),\dots</math>. If <math>X_i\in A</math>, <math>i\in I</math> is a family of elements of <math>A</math> (these can be thought of as random variables in <math>A</math>), they are called ''freely independent'' if the algebras <math>A_i</math> generated by <math>1</math> and <math>X_i</math> are freely independent. == Examples of free independence == * Let <math>\Gamma</math> be the [[free product]] of groups <math>\Gamma_i,i\in I</math>, let <math>A=\mathbb{C}\Gamma</math> be the group algebra, <math>\phi(g)=\delta_{g=e}</math> be the group trace, and set <math>A_i=\mathbb{C}\Gamma_i\subset A</math>. Then <math>A_i:i\in I</math> are freely independent. * Let <math>U_i(N),i=1,2</math> be <math>N\times N</math> unitary [[random matrices]], taken independently at random from the <math>N\times N</math> [[unitary group]] (with respect to the [[Haar measure]]). Then <math>U_1(N),U_2(N)</math> become asymptotically freely independent as <math>N\to\infty</math>. (Asymptotic freeness means that the definition of freeness holds in the limit as <math>N\to\infty</math>). * More generally, independent [[random matrices]] tend to be asymptotically freely independent, under certain conditions. == References == {{Reflist}} [[Category:Functional analysis]] [[Category:Free probability theory]]</text> </page> <page> <id>14227</id> <title>Free software movement</title> <text>The '''free software movement''' is a [[social]] and political movement<ref>[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2008-03/msg00635.html Richard Stallman on the nature of the Free software movement] in 2008 on emacs-devel mailing list.</ref> with the goal of ensuring software users' four basic freedoms: the freedom to run it, to study and change it, and to redistribute copies with or without changes. The [[alternative terms for free software|alternative terms]] "software libre", "open source", and "FOSS" are associated with the free software movement. Although drawing on traditions and philosophies among members of the 1970s [[hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker culture]], [[Richard Stallman]] founded and launched the movement in 1983 by founding the [[GNU Project]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Announcement of the GNU project |url=http://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.html }}</ref> The '''free software philosophy''' at the core of the movement drew on the essence and incidental elements of what was called ''hacker culture'' by many computer users in the 1970s, among other sources. Stallman founded the [[Free Software Foundation]] in 1985 to support the movement. == Philosophy == The philosophy of the movement is to give freedom to computer users by replacing [[proprietary software]] under restrictive licensing terms with [[free software]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Use Free Software |publisher=gnu.org |url=http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/use-free-software.html }}</ref> with the ultimate goal of liberating everyone "in cyberspace"<ref>{{cite web |title=Stallman interviewed by Sean Daly |url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060625001523547 |publisher=Groklaw |date=2006-06-23 }}</ref> – that is, every computer user. Stallman notes that this action will promote rather than hinder the progression of technology, since "it means that much wasteful duplication of system programming effort will be avoided. This effort can go instead into advancing the state of the art".<ref name="Wardrip-Fruin, Noah 2003">Wardrip-Fruin, Noah, and Nick Montfort, eds. ''The New Media Reader''. Cambridge: MIT Press, 2003.</ref> Members of the free software movement believe that all users of software should have the freedoms listed in the [[free software definition]]. Many hold that it is [[morality|immoral]] to prohibit or prevent people from exercising these freedoms and that these freedoms are required to create a decent society where software users can help each other, and to have control over their computers.<ref>{{cite web |title=Why free software? |url=http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-free.html |publisher=gnu.org }}</ref> Some adherents to the free software movement do not believe that [[proprietary software]] is strictly immoral.<ref>{{cite web |title=Copyleft: Pragmatic Idealism |publisher=gnu.org |url=http://www.fsf.org/licensing/essays/pragmatic.html }}</ref> They argue freedom is valuable (both socially and pragmatically) as a property of software in its own right, separate from technical quality in a narrow sense. The Free Software Foundation also believes all software needs free [[documentation]] (in particular because conscientious programmers should be able to update manuals to reflect modification that they made to the software), but deems the freedom to modify less important for other types of written works.<ref>{{cite web |title=Free Software and Free Manuals |url=http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-doc.html |publisher=gnu.org }}</ref> Within the free software movement, the [[Floss manuals]] foundation specializes on the goal of providing such documentation. Members of the free software movement advocate that works which serve a practical purpose should also be free.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} == Actions == === Writing and spreading free software === The core work of the free software movement focused on software development. The free software movement also rejects proprietary software, refusing to install software that does not give them the freedoms of free software.
