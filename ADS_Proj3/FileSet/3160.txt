Applications == Present applications are neuron research. Future applications (still in the experimental phase) are [[retinal implant]]s or [[brain implant]]s. ==See also== * [[Brain-computer interfacing]] * [[Neuroprosthetics]] * [[Cultured neuronal networks]] ==External links== [[Category:Brain-computer interfacing]] [[Category:Integrated circuits]] [[lt:Neurolustas]] [[nl:Neurochip]]</text> </page> <page> <id>26268</id> <title>Neuroeconomics</title> <text>'''Neuroeconomics''' is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to explain human [[decision making]], the ability to process multiple alternatives and to choose an optimal course of action. It studies how economic behavior can shape our understanding of the brain, and how neuroscientific discoveries can constrain and guide models of economics.<ref name="neuroeconomics.duke.edu">Center for Neuroeconomics Study at Duke University http://neuroeconomics.duke.edu/research/research2.html</ref> It combines research methods from [[neuroscience]], [[Experimental economics|experimental]] and [[behavioral economics]], and [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]] and [[Social psychology (psychology)|social]] psychology. As research into decision-making behavior becomes increasingly computational, it has also incorporated new approaches from [[theoretical biology]], [[computer science]], and [[mathematics]]. Neuroeconomics studies decision making by using a combination of tools from these fields to avoid the shortcoming that arise from a single perspective approach. In [[mainstream economics]], expected utility (EU), and the concept of [[rational agents]] are still being used. Many economic behaviors are not fully explained by these models such as [[heuristics]] and [[Framing (social sciences)|framing]].<ref name="annualreviews.org">Loewenstein,G., Rick,S., & Cohen, J.

Neuroeconomics adds another layer by using neuroscienific methods in understanding the interplay between economic behavior and neural mechanisms. By using tools from various fields, neuroeconomics offers a more integrative way of understanding decision making.<ref>Center for Neuroeconomics Study at Duke University http://neuroeconomics.duke.edu/research/research2.html</ref> == History == {{Empty section|date=November 2010}} == Major research areas in neuroeconomics == === Decision making under risk and uncertainty === Most of our decisions are made under some conditions of [[risk]]. Decision sciences such as psychology and economics usually define risk as the uncertainty about several possible outcomes when the probability of each is known.<ref>Mohr, M.,Biele, G.,& Hauke, R. (2010). Neural Processing of Risk. e Journal of Neuroscience, May 12, 2010, 30(19):6613-6619. Retrieved from: http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/abstract/30/19/6613</ref> [[Utility maximization]], first proposed by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738, is used to explain decision making under risk. The theory assumes that humans are [[Rational choice theory|rational]] and will assess options based on the expected utility they will gain from each.<ref name="annualreviews.org"/> Research and experience uncovered a wide range of expected utility anomalies and common patterns of behavior that are inconsistent with the principle of utility maximization. For example, the human tendency to be risk-averse or risk-seeking. Also, the tendency to overweight small probabilities and underweight large ones. [[Kahneman]] and [[Tversky]] proposed the [[prospect theory]] to encompass these observations and offers an alternative model.<ref name="annualreviews.org"/> Risk preference is a central concept in decision sciences, and a useful way for exploring decision making under risk and uncertainty. Neurons participating in the decision process are sensitive to subjective risk preferences, even when available options have the same objective value. Studying this can help in dissociating the subjective value that people assign to uncertain risky events from the objective value. The neural mechanisms underlying the concept of risk preference are not fully examined.<ref name="neuroeconomics.duke.edu"/> This issue is the main goal of this line of research in neuroeconomics which uses [[neuroimaging]] technique to identify regions of the brain implicated in decision making under risk and uncertainty. The [[insular cortex]] has been shown to activate in decisions involving high risk and uncertainty.<ref>Paulus, M., Rogalsky,C., Simmons, A., Feinstein, J., & Stein, M. (21 April 2003). Increased activation in the right insula during risk-taking decision making is related to harm avoidance and neuroticism.

Retrieved from http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0012296</ref> have also been shown to activate when engaging in decisions that involve risk. === Intertemporal choice === In addition to risk preference, another central concept in economics is [[intertemporal choice]]s which are decisions that involve costs and benefits that are distributed over time. Intertemporal choice research studies the expected utility that humans assign to events occurring at different times. The dominant model in economics which explains it is [[discounted utility]] (DU). DU assumes that humans have consistent time preference and will assign value to events regardless of when they occur. Similar to EU in explaining risky decision making, DU is inadequate in explaining intertemporal choice.<ref name="annualreviews.org"/> For example, DU assumes that people will value a bar of candy today more than 2 bars tomorrow, and they will also value 1 bar received 100 days from now more than 2 bars received after 101 days. There is strong evidence against this last part in both humans and animals, and [[hyperbolic discounting]] has been proposed as an alternative model. Under this model, valuations fall very rapidly for small delay periods, but then fall slowly for longer delay periods. This better explains why most people who would choose 1 candy bar now over 2 candy bars tomorrow, would, in fact, choose 2 candy bars received after 101 days rather than the 1 candy bar received after 100 days which EU assumes.<ref name="annualreviews.org"/> Neuroeconomic research on intertemporal choice focuses on whether this behavior can be better explained by the interaction of multiple systems. The central debate is on the role of the [[limbic system]] in intertemporal choice. The limbic system refers to the medial and orbital regions of frontal cortex, the amygdala, the insular cortex, and their subcortical counterparts, and is thought to be critical to emotional processing. Evidence has been found to support the response of these structures to both immediate and delayed rewards .<ref name="annualreviews.org"/> The extent to which intertemporal choice is
