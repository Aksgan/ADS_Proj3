night. ==FidoNet deployments== Although [[wiktionary:monolith|monolithic]] software that encompassed all required functions in one package is available (e.g. D'Bridge), most FidoNet deployments were designed in a modular fashion. A typical deployment would involve several applications that would communicate through shared files and directories, and switch between each other through carefully designed [[shell script|scripts]] or [[batch file]]s. Arguably the most important piece of software on a DOS-based Fido system was the '''[[FOSSIL| FOSSIL driver]]''', which was a small device driver which provided a standard way for the Fido software to talk to the modem.{{sfn|Schuyler|1992|loc=Section 10.0}} This driver needed to be loaded before any Fido software would work. An efficient FOSSIL driver meant faster, more reliable connections. '''Mailer software''' was responsible for transferring files and messages between systems, as well as passing control to other applications, such as the BBS software, at appropriate times. The mailer would initially answer the phone and, if necessary, deal with incoming mail via FidoNet transfer protocols. If the mailer answered the phone and a human caller was detected rather than other mailer software, the mailer would exit, and pass control to the BBS software, which would then initialise for interaction with the user. When outgoing mail was waiting on the local system, the mailer software would attempt to send it from time to time by dialing and connecting to other systems who would accept and route the mail further. Due to the costs of toll calls which often varied between peak and off-peak times, mailer software would usually allow its operator to configure the optimal times in which to attempt to send mail to other systems. '''BBS software''' was used to interact with human callers to the system. BBS software would allow dial-in users to use the system's message bases and write mail to others, locally or on other BBSes. Mail directed to other BBSes would later be routed and sent by the mailer, usually after the user had finished using the system. Many BBSes also allowed users to exchange files, play games, and interact with other users in a variety of ways (i.e.: node to node chat). A '''scanner/tosser''' application, such as [[FastEcho]], [[FMail]], TosScan and [[Squish (FidoNet)|Squish]], would normally be invoked when a BBS user had entered a new FidoNet message that needed to be sent, or when a mailer had received new mail to be imported into the local messages bases. This application would be responsible for handling the packaging of incoming and outgoing mail, moving it between the local system's message bases and the mailer's inbound and outbound directories. The scanner/tosser application would generally be responsible for basic routing information, determining which systems to forward mail to. In later times, '''message readers''' or '''editors''' that were independent of BBS software were also developed. Often the System Operator of a particular BBS would use a devoted message reader, rather than the BBS software itself, to read and write FidoNet and related messages. One of the most popular editors in 2008 was [[GoldED+]]. In some cases FidoNet nodes, or more often FidoNet points, had no public bulletin board attached, and existed only for the transfer of mail for the benefit of the node's operator. Most nodes in 2009 had no BBS access, but only points, if anything. The original ''Fido BBS'' software, and some other FidoNet-supporting software from the 1980s, is no longer functional on modern systems. This is for several reasons, including problems related to the [[Y2K bug]]. In some cases, the original authors have left the [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] or [[shareware]] community, and the software, much of which was [[closed source]], has been rendered [[abandonware]]. Several DOS based legacy FidoNet Mailers such as FrontDoor, Intermail, MainDoor and D'Bridge from the early 1990s can still be run today under Windows without a modem, by using the freeware [[NetFoss]] Telnet [[FOSSIL]] driver, and by using a Virtual Modem such as NetSerial. This allows the mailer to "Dial" an IP address or hostname via Telnet, rather than dialing a real [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] phone number. There are similar solutions for Linux such as MODEMU (modem emulator) which has limited success when combined with [[DOSEMU]] (DOS emulator). Mail Tossers such as FastEcho and FMail are still used today under both Windows and Linux/DOSEMU. [[File:Qcc-0.57.1xe master queue.png|thumb|File queue in qcc, the ncurses UI for qico. The addresses are made-up.]] There are several modern Windows based FidoNet Mailers available today with source code, including Argus, Radius, and Taurus<!-- (they seem to be neither [[free software]] nor [[open source software]], since, IIRC, commercial use is prohibited according to a license in the Argus source code at SF.net)-->. MainDoor is another Windows based Fidonet mailer, which also can be run using either a modem or directly over TCP/IP. Two popular [[free and open source software]] FidoNet mailers for [[Unix-like]] systems are the [[binkd]] (cross-platform, IP-only, uses the [[binkp]] protocol) and qico (supports modem communication as well as the IP protocol of ifcico and binkp). On the '''hardware''' side, Fido systems were usually well-equipped machines, for their day, with quick CPUs, high-speed modems and [[16550]] UARTs, which were at the time an upgrade. As a Fidonet system was usually a BBS, it needed to quickly process any new mail events before returning to its 'waiting for call' state. In addition, the BBS itself usually necessitated lots of storage space. Finally, a FidoNet system usually had at least one dedicated phoneline. Consequently, operating a Fidonet system often required significant financial investment, a cost usually met by the owner of the system. == FidoNet availability == While the use of FidoNet has dropped dramatically compared with its use up to the mid-1990s, it is still popular in [[Russia]] and former republics of the USSR. Some BBSes, including those that are now available for users with [[Internet]] connections via [[telnet]], also retain their FidoNet netmail and echomail feeds. Some of FidoNet's echomail conferences are available via gateways with the Usenet news hierarchy using software like UFGate. There are also mail gates for exchanging messages
