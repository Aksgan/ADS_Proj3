will tolerate). Curiously, rationality and deliberate choice are not necessary, nor trust nor even consciousness,<ref>{{Harvnb|Axelrod|1984|pp=18, 174}}.</ref> as long as there is a pattern that benefits both players (e.g., increases fitness), and some probability of future interaction. Often the initial mutual cooperation is not even intentional, but having "discovered" a beneficial pattern both parties respond to it by continuing the conditions that maintain it. This implies two requirements for the players, aside from whatever strategy they may adopt. First, they must be able to recognize other players, to avoid exploitation by cheaters. Second, they must be able to track their previous history with any given player, in order to be responsive to that player's strategy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Axelrod|1984|p=174}}.</ref> Even when the discount parameter ω is high enough to permit reciprocal cooperation there is still a question of whether and how cooperation might start. One of Axelrod's findings is that when the existing population never offers cooperation nor reciprocates it &ndash; the case of ALL D &ndash; then no nice strategy can get established by isolated individuals; cooperation is strictly a sucker bet. (The "futility of isolated revolt".<ref>{{Harvnb|Axelrod|1984|p=150}}.</ref>) But another finding of great significance is that clusters of nice strategies can get established. Even a small group of individuals with nice strategies with infrequent interactions can yet do so well on those interactions to make up for the low level of exploitation from non-nice strategies<ref>{{Harvnb|Axelrod|1984|pp=63–68, 99}}.</ref> <!-- Although not without interest, the description of the "Live and Let Live" is but a single example of cooperation, and not especially pertinent to the development of the topic. --> == Subsequent work == In 1984 Axelrod estimated that there were "hundreds of articles on the Prisoner's Dilemma cited in ''Psychological Abstracts''".<ref> {{Harvnb|Axelrod|1984|pp=28}}. </ref> Since then he has estimated that citations to ''The Evolution of Cooperation'' alone "are now growing at the rate of over 300 per year".<ref> {{Harvnb|Axelrod|1984|pp=3}}. </ref> To fully review this literature is infeasible. What follows are therefore only a few selected highlights. Axelrod has a subsequent book, ''[[The Complexity of Cooperation]]'',<ref> {{Harvnb|Axelrod|1997}}. </ref> which he considers a sequel to ''The Evolution of Cooperation''. Other work on the evolution of cooperation has expanded to cover prosocial behavior generally,<ref> {{Harvnb|Boyd|2006}}; {{Harvnb|Bowles|2006}}. </ref> and in religion,<ref> {{Harvnb|Norenzayan|Shariff|2008}}. </ref> the promotion of conformity,<ref> {{Harvnb|Bowles|2003}}. </ref> other mechanisms for generating cooperation,<ref name="Nowak 2006">{{Harvnb|Nowak|2006}}. </ref> the IPD under different conditions and assumptions,<ref> {{Harvnb|Axelrod|Dion|1988}}. </ref> and the use of other games such as the [[Public goods game|Public Goods]] and [[Ultimatum]] games to explore deep-seated notions of fairness and fair play.<ref> {{Harvnb|Nowak|Page|Sigmund|2000}}; {{Harvnb|Sigmund|Fehr|Nowak|2002}}. </ref> It has also been used to challenge the rational and self-regarding "[[economic man]]" model of economics,<ref> {{Harvnb|Camerer|Feher|2006}}. </ref> and as a basis for replacing Darwinian [[sexual selection]] theory with a theory of social selection.<ref> {{Harvnb|Roughgarden|Oishi|Akcay|2006}}. </ref> Nice strategies are better able to invade if they have social structures or other means of increasing their interactions. Axelrod discusses this in chapter 8; in a later paper he and Rick Riolo and Michael Cohen<ref> {{Harvnb|Axelrod|Riolo|Cohen|2001}}. </ref> use computer simulations to show cooperation rising among agents who have negligible chance of future encounters but can recognize similarity of an arbitrary characteristic (such as a [[green beard]]). When an IPD tournament introduces noise (errors or misunderstandings) TFT strategies can get trapped into a long string of retaliatory defections, thereby depressing their score. TFT also tolerates "ALL C" (always cooperate) strategies, which then give an opening to exploiters.<ref> {{Harvtxt|Axelrod|1984|pp=136&ndash;138}} has some interesting comments on the need to suppress universal cooperators. See also a similar theme in Piers Anthony's novel ''[[Macroscope (novel by Piers Anthony)|Macroscope]]''. </ref> In 1992 Martin Nowak and Karl Sigmund demonstrated a strategy called Pavlov (or "win&ndash;stay, lose&ndash;shift") that does better in these circumstances.<ref> {{Harvnb|Nowak|Sigmund|1992}}; see also {{Harvnb|Milinski|1993}}. </ref> Pavlov looks at its own prior move as well as the other player's move. If the payoff was R or P (see "Prisoner's Dilemma", above) it cooperates; if S or T it defects. In a 2006 paper Nowak listed five mechanisms by which natural selection can lead to cooperation.<ref name="Nowak 2006"/> In addition to kin selection and direct reciprocity, he shows that: * Indirect reciprocity is based on knowing the other player's reputation, which is the player's history with other players. Cooperation depends on a reliable history being projected from past partners to future partners. * Network reciprocity relies on geographical or social factors to increase the interactions with nearer neighbors; it is essentially a virtual group. * Group selection<ref>Here group selection is not a form of evolution, which is problematical (see {{Harvtxt|Dawkins|1989}}, ch. 7), but a mechanism for evolving cooperation.</ref> assumes that groups with cooperators (even altruists) will be more successful as a whole, and this will tend to benefit all members. The payoffs in the Prisoner's Dilemma game are fixed, but in real life defectors are often punished by cooperators. Where punishment is costly there is a second-order dilemma amongst cooperators between those who pay the cost of enforcement and those who do not.<ref> {{Harvnb|Hauert|et.al.|2007}}. </ref> Other work has shown that while individuals given a choice between joining a group that punishes free-riders and one that does not initially prefer the sanction-free group, yet after several rounds they will join the sanctioning group, seeing that sanctions secure a better payoff.<ref> {{Harvnb|Gurek|Irienbush|Rockenback|2006}}. </ref> And there is the very intriguing paper "The Coevolution of Parochial Altruism and War" by Jung-Kyoo Choi and Samuel Bowles.
