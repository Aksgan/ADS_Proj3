<text>[[Image:US-NLM-NCBI-Logo.svg|140px|thumb|National Center for Biotechnology Information logo]] The '''National Center for Biotechnology Information''' ('''NCBI''') is part of the [[United States National Library of Medicine]] (NLM), a branch of the [[National Institutes of Health]]. The NCBI is located in [[Bethesda, Maryland]]({{Coord|38.994994|-77.099339|display=inline,title|region:US_type:landmark}}) and was founded in 1988 through legislation sponsored by Senator [[Claude Pepper]]. The NCBI houses [[genome]] [[sequencing]] data in [[GenBank]] and an index of biomedical research articles in [[PubMed Central]] and [[PubMed]], as well as other information relevant to [[biotechnology]]. All these databases are available online through the [[Entrez]] search engine. NCBI is directed by [[David Lipman]], one of the original authors of the [[BLAST]] sequence alignment program and a widely respected figure in [[Bioinformatics]]. He also leads an intramural research program, including groups led by [[Stephen Altschul]] (another [[BLAST]] co-author), David Landsman, and [[Eugene Koonin]] (a prolific author on [[comparative genomics]]). ==GenBank== {{Main|GenBank}} The NCBI has had responsibility for making available the GenBank [[DNA]] [[Biological databases|sequence database]] since 1992.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=handbook.section.3 The NCBI Handbook, History]</ref> GenBank coordinates with individual laboratories and other sequence databases such as those of the [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] (EMBL) and the [[DNA Data Bank of Japan]] (DDBJ).<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=handbook.section.4 The NCBI Handbook, International Collaborations]</ref> Since 1992, NCBI has grown to provide other databases in addition to GenBank. NCBI provides [[Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man]], the Molecular Modeling Database (3D protein structures), [[dbSNP]] a database of [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s, the Unique Human Gene Sequence Collection, a Gene Map of the [[human genome]], a Taxonomy Browser, and coordinates with the National Cancer Institute to provide the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project. The NCBI assigns a unique identifier (Taxonomy ID number) to each species of organism. The NCBI has software tools that are available by [[World Wide Web|WWW]] browsing or by FTP. For example, [[BLAST]] is a sequence similarity searching program. BLAST can do sequence comparisons against the GenBank DNA database in less than 15 seconds. ==NCBI Bookshelf== The '''NCBI Bookshelf''' is a collection of freely available, downloadable, on-line versions of selected biomedical books. As of March 2006, the Bookshelf had [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=Books 55 titles] covering aspects of [[molecular biology]], [[biochemistry]], [[cell biology]], [[genetics]], [[microbiology]], a couple of disease states from a molecular and cellular point of view, research methods, and [[virology]]. Some of the books are online versions of previously published books, while others, such as [[Coffee Break (book)]], are written and edited by NCBI staff. The Bookshelf is a complement to the [[Pubmed|Entrez PubMed]] repository of [[Peer review|peer-reviewed publication]] abstracts in that Bookshelf contents provide established perspectives on evolving areas of study and a context in which many disparate individual pieces of reported research can be organized. ==See also== * [[European Bioinformatics Institute]] (EBI) * [[DNA Data Bank of Japan]] (DDBJ) ==References== <references/> ==External links== * [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ NCBI Home page] * [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/ National Library of Medicine] * [http://www.nih.gov/ National Institutes of Health] [[Category:Discipline-oriented digital libraries]] [[Category:Medical research institutes]] [[be:Нацыянальны цэнтр біятэхналагічнай інфармацыі ЗША]] [[be-x-old:Нацыянальны цэнтар біятэхналягічнай інфармацыі ЗША]] [[ca:National Center for Biotechnology Information]] [[cs:National Center for Biotechnology Information]] [[de:National Center for Biotechnology Information]] [[es:Centro Nacional para la Información Biotecnológica]] [[eo:National Center for Biotechnology Information]] [[fa:مرکز ملی اطلاعات زیست‌فناوری]] [[fr:National Center for Biotechnology Information]] [[hy:ԱՄՆ-ի կենսատեխնոլոգիական ինֆորմացիայի ազգային կենտրոն]] [[it:National Center for Biotechnology Information]] [[he:NCBI]] [[nl:National Center for Biotechnology Information]] [[ja:国立生物工学情報センター]] [[ko:미국 국립생물공학정보센터]] [[pl:National Center for Biotechnology Information]] [[ru:Национальный центр биотехнологической информации]] [[sr:Nacionalni centar za biotehnološke informacije]] [[sv:National Center for Biotechnology Information]] [[tr:National Center for Biotechnology Information]] [[uk:Національний центр біотехнологічної інформації]] [[zh:美国国家生物技术信息中心]]</text> </page> <page> <id>25823</id> <title>National Core for Neuroethics</title> <text>{{Advert|date=October 2009}} {{COI|date=October 2009}} {| class="infobox" style="width: 23em; font-size: 95%;" |+ style="font-size: larger;" | |- ! colspan="2" bgcolor="#b0c4de" | '''National Core for Neuroethics''' |- style="vertical-align: top;" |- | Name | ''National Core for Neuroethics'' |- | Logo | [[Image:National Core For Neuroethics Logo.svg|130px]] |- | Region | Vancouver |- | Province | British Columbia |- | Country | Canada |- | Coordinates | {{Coord|49|15|40|N|123|07|28|W|scale:5000_type:landmark_region:CA-BC|display=inline,title|name=Vancouver Hospital and Health Sciences Centre}} |- | Type | Research |- | Speciality | Neuroethics |- | Affiliation | [[UBC Faculty of Medicine]] |- | Established | 2007 |- | Website | http://www.neuroethicscanada.ca |- |} The '''National Core for Neuroethics''' at the [[University of British Columbia]] was established in August 2007, with generous support from the [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research]], Institute of Mental Health and Addiction, [[Canada Foundation for Innovation]], the British Columbia Knowledge Development Fund, the [[Canada Research Chair]]s program, the UBC Brain Research Centre and the UBC Institute of Mental Health<ref name="neuroethics.ubc.ca">http://www.neuroethics.ubc.ca/index.html</ref>. Led by Dr. [[Judy Illes]], the Core has asserted itself on both the national and international stage as a forerunner in the field of [[neuroethics]], with particular focus on ethics in [[neurodegenerative disease]] and [[regenerative medicine]], international and cross cultural challenges in brain research, [[neuroimaging]] and [[ethics]], the neuroethics of [[enhancement]], and [[personalized medicine]]<ref>http://www.neuroethics.ubc.ca/research.html</ref>. The Core's major research projects are focused on high impact, high visibility areas including the use of drugs and devices for neuroenhancement, ethics in neurodegenerative disease and regenerative medicine research, international and cross-cultural challenges in brain research, neuroimaging in the private sector, and the ethics of personalized medicine, among others. Members of the Core also lead initiatives aside from their research projects. Considerable attention has been given to the Core by both the scholarly and non-academic media, with the Core featured in the ''[[New York Times]]''<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/world/asia/15brainscan.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all "India’s novel use of brain scans in courts is debated].
