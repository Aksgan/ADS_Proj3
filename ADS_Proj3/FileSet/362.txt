The system is a collaborative effort of many health groups but is published and trademarked by the [[American College of Radiology]] (ACR). The system is designed to standardize reporting. The document focuses on patient reports used by medical professionals, not "lay reports" that are provided to patients. ==Published Documents== The BI-RADS is published by ACR in the form of the BI-RADS Atlas. As of 2007 the Atlas is divided into 3 publications: * Mammography, Fourth Edition * [[Ultrasound]], First Edition * [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], First Edition ==Assessment Categories== While BI-RADS is a quality control system, in day-to-day usage the term "BI-RADS" refers to the mammography assessment categories. These are standardized numerical codes typically assigned by a [[radiologist]] after interpreting a mammogram. This allows for concise and unambiguous understanding of patient records between multiple doctors and medical facilities. The assessment categories were developed for mammography and later adapted for the MRI and Ultrasound Atlases. The summary of each category, given below, is identical for all 3 modalities. Category 6 was added in the 4th edition of the Mammography Atlas.

BIOSCI/Bionet provides public, [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] biology news and discussion for areas such as molecular biology methods and reagents, bioinformatics software and computational biology, toxicology, and several organism communities including yeast, C.elegans and annelida (worms), the plant arabidopsis, fruitfly, maize (corn), and others.<ref name="gilbert2004">{{cite journal | author=Gilbert, D.G. | title=Software Review: Bioinformatics software resources | journal=Briefings in Bioinformatics | year=2004 | volume=5 | issue=3 | pages= 300–304 | url=http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/5/3/300.pdf | doi=10.1093/bib/5.3.300 | pmid=15383216}}</ref> BIOSCI/Bionet was started as part of the [[GenBank]] public biosequence database project by Intelligenetics at [[Stanford University]] in the mid 1980s, in collaboration with Martin Bishop and [[Michael Ashburner]] in the [[University of Cambridge]] <ref name="benton1990">{{cite journal | author=Benton, D. | title=Recent changes in the GenBank On-line Service | journal=Nucleic Acids Research | year=1990 | volume=18 | issue=6 | pages= 1517–1520 | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.gov/pagerender.fcgi?artid=330520 | doi=10.1093/nar/18.6.1517 | pmid=2326192 | pmc=330520}}</ref>.

In 2005, with the closing of RFCGR, BIOSCI/Bionet moved to [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] Biology Department's IUBio Archive. As one of the earliest [[bioinformatics]] community projects on the Internet, [[GenBank]] acquired the bio.net domain and the Usenet hierarchy of Bionet for promoting open access communications among bioscientists, in conjunction with public biology data distribution. [[Michael Ashburner]], co-founder of BIOSCI with Dave Kristofferson of [[GenBank]] (Intelligenetics), writes of its origins <blockquote> ... in the early 1980s, Martin Bishop and I ran an email news service for a sequence analysis service that we ran on the Cambridge IBM3084Q mainframe. I was also a user of MOLGEN at Stanford, and there Dave Kristofferson ran an internal bulletin board using ANU News. We combined forces to start the Bulletin boards. </blockquote> The [[Usenet]] hierarchy of '''Bionet.*''' includes bionet.announce (general biology announcements), and research communities of bionet.microbiology, bionet.molbio.methds-reagnts, bionet.neuroscience, bionet.genome.arabidopsis, bionet.plants.education, bionet.drosophila, bionet.biology.computational plus 50 other active areas of discussion. == References == {{reflist}} == External links == *[http://www.bio.net/ BIOSCI/Bionet] *[http://iubio.bio.indiana.edu/ IUBio Archive] *[http://www.bio.net/bionet/mm/bioforum/1991-July/003257.html Dave Kristofferson on BIOSCI] *[http://www.bio.net/bionet/mm/bioforum/1991-July/001798.html NIH support of GenBank/BIOSCI] {{DEFAULTSORT:Biosci}} [[Category:Biology]] [[Category:Bioinformatics]] [[Category:Virtual communities]]</text> </page> <page> <id>3129</id> <title>BIRCH (data clustering)</title> <text>{{multiple issues|notability =March 2009|context =March 2009|wikify =May 2010}} '''BIRCH''' (balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies) is an unsupervised [[data mining]] algorithm used to perform [[Data clustering|hierarchical clustering]] over particularly large data-sets. An advantage of Birch is its ability to incrementally and dynamically cluster incoming, multi-dimensional metric [[data point]]s in an attempt to produce the best quality clustering for a given set of resources (memory and [[time constraint]]s). In most cases, Birch only requires a single scan of the database. In addition, Birch is recognized<ref>{{Literatur | Autor = Tian Zhang, Raghu Ramakrishnan, Miron Livny | Titel = An Efficient Data Clustering Method for Very Large Databases }}</ref> as the, "first clustering algorithm proposed in the database area to handle 'noise' (data points that are not part of the underlying pattern) effectively". ==Problem with previous methods== Previous clustering algorithms performed less effectively over very large databases and did not adequately consider the case wherein a data-set was too large to fit in [[Primary storage|main memory]]. As a result, there was a lot of overhead maintaining high clustering quality while minimizing the cost of addition IO (input/output) operations. Furthermore, most of Birch's predecessors inspect all data points
