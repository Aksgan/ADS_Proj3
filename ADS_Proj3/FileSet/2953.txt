with similar projects already successfully carried out in Germany, Italy, France, and Denmark. The brief work strongly recommends Scot historian and poet [[John Pinkerton]] to head the project; an editor, Gibbon writes, "replete with a variety of knowledge," and "well qualified for this study, by a spirit of Criticism, acute discerning and suspicious."<ref>Craddock, ''EEEG'', 534-545, at pp. 545, 538-40, 542, 544-45, 600. see also Norton, ''Biblio'', 179-81. At this juncture, Pinkerton's reputation had been decidedly mixed: part serious antiquarian enjoying the patronage of [[Horace Walpole]], part near buffoon whose work could evoke "hilarity" and "ridicule." Gibbon eventually chose to prefer the former, believing that "the volatile and fiery particles of his nature have been discharged [leaving] a pure and solid substance endowed with many active and useful energies." Craddock, ''EEEG'', p. 542; Trevor-Roper, "Gibbon's Last Project," pp. 407, 414.</ref> For his part, Gibbon was prepared to contribute a general introduction and author-specific prefaces. The first edition was "pirated" and reprinted twice in 1796, in Ireland and Switzerland:<ref>Norton, ''Biblio'', p. 197; 203-204.</ref> * '''3 vols. octavo''' (Dublin: P. Wogan, L.

Mr. Gibbon to *** on the Government of Berne." also appears with English translation in '''FIRST edition''', Vol. 1, pp. 388–413]. a fictional letter from a Swedish diarist to a Swiss friend comparing the governments of Bern and early Rome. Employing language undeniably influenced by Montesquieu, Gibbon observes that Bern in adopting an oligarchic form similar to the Venetian, has omitted any incorporation of the separation of powers, in doing so has ignored the "principles of liberty," and therefore stands on the brink of despotism. Pocock identifies the ''Lettre'' as Gibbon's "first essay on empire in the context of European history." By this time, Gibbon has clearly adopted erudition as "the dominant interest of his young and his mature life."<ref>Pocock, ''EEG'', pp. 89-91, 93. Additional background from Brian Norman, chapter 2 in "The Influence of Switzerland on the Life and Writings of Edward Gibbon," ''Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth Century'' [SVEC] v.2002:03, (Oxford: Voltaire Foundation, 2002), 21-32. Norman claims "certainty" of his dating of the work based on a close analysis of Gibbon's scriptional accentuation (pp. 30-31).</ref> Sheffield's preface intones, "The excellence of this curious paper will apologize for its great length."
