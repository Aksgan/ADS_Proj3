In a recent interview for ''The Economist'', Brin jokingly said "We're both kind of obnoxious." They seemed to disagree on most subjects. But after spending time together, they "became intellectual soul-mates and close friends". Brin's focus was on developing data mining systems while Page's was in extending "the concept of inferring the importance of a research paper from its [[citations]] in other papers."<ref name=Economist/> Together, the pair authored what is widely considered their seminal contribution, a paper entitled "The Anatomy of a Large-Scale [[Hypertext]]ual Web Search Engine."<ref>"[http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/papers/google.pdf The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine]"</ref> Combining their ideas, they "crammed their dormitory room with cheap computers" and tested their new search engine designs on the web. Their project grew quickly enough "to cause problems for Stanford's computing infrastructure." But they realized they had succeeded in creating a superior engine for searching the web and suspended their PhD studies to work more on their system.<ref name=Economist/> As Mark Malseed wrote, "Soliciting funds from faculty members, family and friends, Sergey and Larry scraped together enough to buy some [[Server (computing)|server]]s and rent that famous garage in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]]. ... [soon after], [[Sun Microsystems]] co-founder [[Andy Bechtolsheim]] wrote a $100,000 check to “Google, Inc.” The only problem was, “Google, Inc.” did not yet exist—the company hadn’t yet been incorporated. For two weeks, as they handled the paperwork, the young men had nowhere to deposit the money."<ref name=Moment/> ''The Economist'' magazine describes Brin's approach to life, like Page's, as based on a vision summed up by Google's motto, "of making all the world's information 'universally accessible and useful.'" Others have compared their vision to that of [[Johannes Gutenberg]], the inventor of modern printing: :"In 1440, Johannes Gutenberg introduced Europe to the mechanical printing press, printing Bibles for mass consumption. The technology allowed for books and manuscripts – originally replicated by hand – to be printed at a much faster rate, thus spreading knowledge and helping to usher in the [[European Renaissance]]. . . Google has done a similar job."<ref>[http://www.librarystuff.net/2009/10/01/google-the-gutenberg/ ''Information Technology], Oct. 1, 2009</ref> The comparison was likewise noted by the authors of ''The Google Story'': "Not since Gutenberg . . . has any new invention empowered individuals, and transformed access to information, as profoundly as Google."<ref name=Vise/>{{rp|1}} Not long after the two "cooked up their new engine for web searches, they began thinking about information that is today beyond the web", such as digitizing books, and expanding health information.<ref name=Economist/> ==Personal life== In May 2007, Brin married [[Anne Wojcicki]] in [[The Bahamas]]. Wojcicki is a [[biotech]] analyst and a 1996 graduate of [[Yale University]] with a [[B.S.]] in [[biology]].<ref name="Washington Post">{{cite news | first = Amy | last = Argetsinger | coauthors = Roberts, Roxanne | title = The Reliable Source | work = [[The Washington Post]] | date = May 13, 2007 | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/12/AR2007051201168.html | accessdate = 2007-10-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Anne Wojcicki Marries the Richest Bachelor | publisher = Cosmetic Makovers | url = http://cosmetic-makeovers.com/2007/05/18/anne-wojcicki-marries-the-richest-bachelor | accessdate = 2007-10-20}}</ref> She has an active interest in [[health information]], and together she and Brin are developing new ways to improve access to it. As part of their efforts, they have brainstormed with leading researchers about the [[human genome project]]. "Brin instinctively regards [[genetics]] as a [[database]] and computing problem. So does his wife, who co-founded the firm, [[23andMe]]", which lets people analyze and compare their own genetic makeup (consisting of 23 pairs of [[chromosomes]]).<ref name=Economist/> In a recent announcement at Google’s Zeitgeist conference, he said he hoped that some day everyone would learn their genetic code in order to help doctors, patients, and researchers analyze the data and try to repair bugs.<ref name=Economist/> Brin's mother, Eugenia, has been diagnosed with [[Parkinson's Disease]]. In 2008, he decided to make a donation to the [[University of Maryland School of Medicine]], where his mother is being treated.<ref>{{cite news | title = Google Co-Founder Has Genetic Code Linked to Parkinson's | url= http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/19/technology/19google.html?_r=1&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&oref=slogin | accessdate = 2008-09-18 | work=The New York Times | first=Miguel | last=Helft | date=September 19, 2008}}</ref> Brin used the services of 23AndMe and discovered that although Parkinson's is generally not [[hereditary]], both he and his mother possess a [[mutation]] of the [[LRRK2]] gene that puts the likelihood of his developing Parkinson's in later years between 20 and 80%.<ref name=Economist>"Enlightenment Man", ''[[The Economist]]'', Dec. 6, 2008 [http://www.economist.com/science/tq/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12673407]</ref> When asked whether ignorance was not bliss in such matters, he stated that his knowledge means that he can now take measures to ward off the disease. An editorial in ''The Economist'' magazine states that "Mr Brin regards his mutation of LRRK2 as a bug in his personal code, and thus as no different from the bugs in computer code that Google’s engineers fix every day. By helping himself, he can therefore help others as well. He considers himself lucky. ... But Mr. Brin was making a much bigger point. Isn’t knowledge always good, and certainly always better than ignorance?"<ref name=Economist/> ==Censorship of Google in China== {{details|Censorship in the People's Republic of China}} Remembering his youth and his family's reasons for leaving the Soviet Union, he "agonized over Google’s decision to appease the communist government of [[China]] by allowing it to censor search engine results", but decided that the Chinese would still be better off than without having Google available.<ref name=Economist/> He explained his reasoning to ''Fortune'' magazine: :"We felt that by participating there, and making our services more available, even if not to the 100 percent that we ideally would like, that it will be better for Chinese web users, because ultimately they would get
