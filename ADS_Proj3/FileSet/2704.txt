"As the members of the class began to move their chairs out of the room he might look imploringly at a friend and say in a low tone, ‘Could you go to a flick?’ On the way to the cinema Wittgenstein would buy a bun or cold pork pie and munch it while he watched the film."<ref>Malcolm, Norman. ''Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir''. Oxford University Press, 1958, p. 26.</ref> By this time, Wittgenstein's view on the [[foundations of mathematics]] had changed considerably. Earlier he had thought that logic could provide a solid foundation, and he had even considered updating Russell and Whitehead's ''Principia Mathematica''. Now he denied that there were any mathematical facts to be discovered and he denied that mathematical statements were true in any real sense. He gave a series of lectures on mathematics, discussing this and other topics, documented in a book, with lectures by Wittgenstein and discussions between him and several students, including the young [[Alan Turing]].<ref>Diamond, Cora (ed.).

University Of Chicago Press, 1989.</ref> ===World War II and working in Guy's Hospital=== Monk writes that Wittgenstein found it intolerable that a war was going on and he was teaching philosophy. In September 1941 he asked [[John Ryle (professor)|John Ryle]], the brother of the philosopher [[Gilbert Ryle]], if he could get a manual job at Guy's Hospital in London. John Ryle was professor of medicine at Cambridge and had been involved in helping Guy's prepare for [[the Blitz]]. Wittgenstein told Ryle he would die slowly if left at Cambridge, and he would rather die quickly. He started working at Guy's shortly afterwards as a dispensary porter, meaning that he delivered drugs from the pharmacy to the wards&mdash;where he apparently advised the patients not to take them.<ref name=Monk431/> The hospital staff were not told that he was one of the world's most famous philosophers, though some of the medical staff did recognize him—at least one had attended Moral Sciences Club meetings—but they were discreet. "Good God, don't tell anybody who I am!" Wittgenstein begged one of them. Some of them nevertheless called him Professor Wittgenstein, and he was allowed to dine with the doctors. He was lonely. He wrote on 1 April 1942: "I no longer feel any hope for the future of my life. It is as though I had before me nothing more than a long stretch of living death. I cannot imagine any future for me other than a ghastly one. Friendless and joyless."<ref name=Monk431>Monk, p. 431ff.</ref> He had developed a friendship with Keith Kirk, a working-class teenage friend of [[Francis Skinner]], the mathematics undergraduate he had had a relationship with until Skinner's death in 1941 from polio. Skinner had given up academia, thanks at least in part to Wittgenstein's influence, and had been working as a mechanic in 1939, with Kirk as his apprentice. Kirk and Wittgenstein struck up a friendship, with Wittgenstein giving him lessons in physics to help him pass a City and Guilds exam, but Wittgenstein seems to have fallen in love with him. During his period of loneliness at Guy's he wrote in his diary: "For ten days I've heard nothing more from K, even though I pressed him a week ago for news. I think that he has perhaps broken with me. A ''tragic'' thought." Kirk had in fact got married, and they never saw one another again.<ref>Monk, pp. 442&ndash;443.</ref> ==1947&ndash;1951: Final years== {|class="toccolours" style="float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#white; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;" cellspacing="5" |style="text-align: left;"| "Death is not an event in life: we do not live to experience death.

Seeking solitude he moved to Rosro, a holiday cottage in Connemara owned by Maurice O'Connor-Drury. Drury told his servant, Tommy Mulkerrins, that Wittgenstein had had a nervous breakdown and needed looking after.<ref name=archivefinalyears/> He also accepted an invitation from [[Norman Malcolm]], a former student, to stay with him at Ithaca, New York. He made the trip in April 1949, but told Malcolm he was unwell: "I haven't done any work since the beginning of March & I haven't had the strength of even trying to do any." A doctor in Dublin had diagnosed anaemia and prescribed iron and liver pills, but he fell ill again in America, and told Malcolm he was afraid of dying there. "I don't want to die in America. I am a European. I want to die there. What a fool I was to come!"<ref name=Waugh273>Waugh, pp. 273ff.</ref> [[File:Ludwig Wittgenstein, Storey's Way, Cambridge.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A plaque at "Storey's End," 76 [[Storey's Way]], Cambridge, where Wittgenstein died.]] He returned to London, where he was diagnosed with an inoperable cancer of the prostate, spread to his bone marrow. He was prescribed oestrogen, which gave him diarrhea, hot flashes, impotence, and swelling of the breasts. He spent the next two months in Vienna, where his sister Hermine died on 11 February 1950; he went to see her every day, but she was hardly able to speak or recognize him. "Great loss for me and all of us," he wrote. "Greater than I would have thought." He moved around a lot after Hermine's death: to Cambridge in April 1950, where he stayed with [[Georg Henrik von Wright|G. H. von Wright]]; to London to stay with [[Rush Rhees]];
