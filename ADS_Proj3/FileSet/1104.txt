([[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]: '''''Íslensk erfðagreining''''') {{nasdaq|DCGN}} is a biopharmaceutical company based in [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]]. The company was founded in 1996 to identify human genes associated with common diseases using population studies, and apply the knowledge gained to guide the development of candidate drugs. So far the company has isolated genes believed to be involved in cardiovascular disease, [[cancer]] and [[schizophrenia]], among other diseases (the company's research concerning the latter is said to represent the first time a gene has been identified by two independent studies to be associated with schizophrenia<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stefansson H, Sarginson J, Kong A, ''et al.'' |title=Association of neuregulin 1 with schizophrenia confirmed in a Scottish population |journal=Am.

This service was launched in November 2007 and thereby became the first web-based service to offer a comprehensive genome scan and an online analysis of an individual's [[DNA]]. More than one million [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s are included in the scan [http://www.snpedia.com/index.php?title=DeCODEme][http://www.illumina.com/media.ilmn?Title=human1m-duo%20beadchip%20content&Img=prodservhuman1MDuoContentLr.gif&Cap=&PageName=human1M-duo%20beadchip&PageURL=261]. deCODEme claims that the DNA profile it provides can supply its customers with a basis from which they are able calculate the relative risk of developing these diseases and thereby enable them to make better informed decisions about [[prevention (medical)]] and treatment. The deCODEme service currently includes information on the genetic susceptibility to close to 45 common diseases such as [[myocardial infarction]], [[atrial fibrillation]], several types of cancers and [[type-2 diabetes]] as well as providing insights into distant [[Genealogy|ancestry]] and geographical origins. ==SEC filing== deCODE's 2006 [http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1022974/000110465907019321/a07-5795_110k.htm 10-K SEC filing] reveals that their net losses to date are in excess of 530 million dollars, and that they have never turned a profit<ref>{{cite web | title = deCODE genetics, SEC Edgar 10-K, 12-31-2006| url = http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1022974/000110465907019321/a07-5795_110k.htm| accessdate = 2007-11-18 }}</ref>: <blockquote> ''If we continue to incur operating losses longer than anticipated, or in amounts greater than anticipated, we may be unable to continue our operations.''

Our research and development expenditures and selling, general and administrative costs have exceeded our revenue to date, and we expect to spend significant additional amounts to fund research and development in order to enhance our core technologies and undertake product development (including drug development and related clinical trials). We do not expect to receive royalties or other revenues from commercial sales of products developed using our technology in the near term. It may be several years before product revenues materialize, if they do at all. As a result, we expect to incur net losses for several years.
