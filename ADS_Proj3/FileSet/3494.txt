Because most humans continue to think in terms of the kind of events we perceive in the human scale of daily life, it became necessary to provide a new '''philosophical interpretation of classical physics'''. Classical mechanics worked extremely well within its domain of observation but made inaccurate predictions at very small scale - atomic scale systems - and when objects moved very fast or were very massive. Viewed through the lens of quantum mechanics or relativity, we can now see that classical physics, imported from the world of our everyday experience, includes notions for which there is no actual evidence. For example, one commonly held idea is that there exists one absolute time shared by all observers. Another is the idea that electrons are discrete entities like miniature planets that circle the nucleus in definite orbits.{{ref|Messiah_45_50}}. The [[correspondence principle]] says that classical accounts are approximations to quantum mechanics that are for all practical purposes equivalent to quantum mechanics when dealing with macro-scale events. Various problems occur if classical mechanics is used to describe quantum systems, such as the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]] in [[black body radiation]], the [[Gibbs paradox]], and the lack of a zero point for [[entropy]]. Since classical physics corresponds more closely to ordinary language than modern physics does, this subject is also a part of the philosophical interpretation of [[Philosophy of language|ordinary language]], which has other aspects, as well. == The measurement process == In classical mechanics it is assumed that given properties - speed or mass of a particle; temperature of a gas, etc. - can in principle be measured to any degree
