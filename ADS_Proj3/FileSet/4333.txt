Multimedia TADS, introduced in 1998, allows games to display graphics, animation and play sounds, if the platform supports it. In 2006, TADS received a major overhaul with the release of TADS 3, which is a complete rewrite of the TADS engine, only retaining the platform-dependent code to ease [[porting]]. TADS 3 uses a language with a syntax that resembles [[C++]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. TADS 3 has many new features, such as efficient dynamic objects (with [[garbage collection (computer science)|automatic garbage collection]]), structured [[Exception handling|exceptions]], native [[UTF-8]] strings, and many useful function classes. The TADS 3 [[compiler]] and [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] have been ported to the [[Unix]], [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] and [[DOS]] [[platform (computing)|platforms]]. Several TADS 3 games have been released. ==TADS games== Games written in TADS are compiled to a platform-independent format that can be played on any computer for which a suitable [[virtual machine]] (VM) exists. Such virtual machines exist for several platforms, and in this respect, TADS closely follows the example of the original [[Infocom]] [[Z-machine]], as well as modern languages such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]. Whereas the TADS 1 and 2 VMs had to [[parse]] the commands entered by the player, before sending the results on to the game, TADS 3 employs a more general-purpose virtual machine, where the command-parsing is done by the game code itself, akin to Inform. The rationale for this is that it is easier to customize the parser.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} ===Notable games developed in TADS 2=== * ''[[Uncle Zebulon's Will]]'', by [[Magnus Olsson (programmer)|Magnus Olsson]] (1995).
