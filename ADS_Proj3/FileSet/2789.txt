and Technical Director. He retired from the US Army in 2002. Sachs was appointed by President [[George W. Bush]] in 2002 to serve in the White House Office of Cyberspace Security where he was a staff member of the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] and the [[President's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board]]. While a member of the [[White House]] staff, he coordinated efforts to protect and secure the nation's telecommunication and Internet infrastructures, leveraging expertise from [[United States]] government agencies, the domestic private sector, and the international community. He also contributed to the [[National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace]], and later served in the [[National Cyber Security Division]] of the US [[Department of Homeland Security]]. He is credited for proposing the creation of the [[US-CERT]] in 2003.<ref>Biography of Marcus H. Sachs, http://www.sachs.us/marc</ref> In 2005, Sachs began directing the Washington operations of the Cyber Security Research and Development Center of SRI International.<ref>Marcus Sachs Joins SRI International as Deputy Director in Computer Science Laboratory, http://www.sri.com/news/releases/04-18-2005.html</ref> Supported by [[SRI International]]'s Computer Science Laboratory under a contract with the U.S. [[Department of Homeland Security]], the Center was the primary vehicle through which the Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[HSARPA]]) Cyber Security R&D programs were executed. Sachs is also a cyberspace security researcher, writer, and instructor for the [[SANS Institute]] and the Director of the SANS [[Internet Storm Center]]. He is a registered [[Professional Engineer]] in the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] and holds an [[amateur radio]] advanced class license. == References == {{reflist}} {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME = Sachs, Marcus | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH = October 4, 1959 | PLACE OF BIRTH = [[Lahore, Pakistan]] | DATE OF DEATH = | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Sachs, Marcus}} [[Category:Florida State University alumni]] [[Category:United States Department of Homeland Security]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:Georgia Institute of Technology alumni]] [[Category:People associated with computer security]] [[Category:1959 births]] [[Category:United States Army Command and General Staff College alumni]]</text> </page> <page> <id>23456</id> <title>Margin (machine learning)</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=February 2009}} The '''margin''' of a single data point is defined to be the distance from the data point to a decision boundary. Note that there are many distances and decision boundaries that may be appropriate for certain datasets and goals. A [[margin classifier]] is a classifier that explicitly utilizes the margin of each example while learning a [[classifier]]. There are theoretical justifications (based on the [[VC dimension]]) as to why maximizing the margin (under some suitable constraints) may be beneficial for machine learning and statistical inferences algorithms.
