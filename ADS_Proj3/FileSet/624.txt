Example of an early high-quality imported ceiling fan.]] The first ceiling fans appeared in the early 1860s and 1870s, in the [[United States]]. At that time, they were not powered by any form of [[electric motor]]. Instead, a stream of running [[water]] was used, in conjunction with a [[turbine]], to drive a system of belts which would turn the blades of two-blade fan units. These systems could accommodate several fan units, and so became popular in stores, [[restaurant]]s, and offices. Some of these systems still survive today, and can be seen in parts of the [[southern United States]] where they originally proved useful. The electrically-powered ceiling fan was invented in 1882 by [[Philip Diehl (inventor)|Philip Diehl]] (pronounced the same as "deal"). Diehl had engineered the electric motor used in the first Singer [[sewing machine]]s, and in 1882 adapted that motor for use in a ceiling-mounted fan. "The Diehl Electric Fan", as it was known, operated like a common modern-day ceiling fan; each fan had its own self-contained motor unit, eliminating the need for costly and bulky belt systems.<ref name="fanbook">{{cite book |last=Scharff |first=Robert |coauthors=Casablanca Fan Co. |title=The Fan Book |origyear=1983 |publisher=Reston Publishing Co, Inc. |location=Reston, VA 22090 |isbn=0-8359-1855-6 |pages=128}}</ref> Diehl was almost immediately up against fierce competition due to the commercial success of the ceiling fan. However, he continued to make improvements to his invention. One such improvement, the "Diehl Electrolier", was a light kit adapted onto the ceiling fan to compensate for any light fixture(s) displaced by the installation of the ceiling fan, and/or to add extra overhead lighting to the room. By [[World War I]], most ceiling fans were being manufactured with four blades instead of the original two. Besides making fans quieter, this change allowed them to circulate more air, thereby making more efficient use of their motors. By the 1920s, ceiling fans had become commonplace in the United States, and had started to take hold internationally; however, during the [[Great Depression]], ceiling fans faded out of vogue in the U.S.<ref name="fanbook"/> By the end of [[World War II]], ceiling fans had become almost non-existent, and remained that way into the 1950s. Those which remained were considered items of nostalgia. However, the ceiling fan was still very popular in other countries, notably those with warm climates which could not afford high-energy-consuming devices, namely [[air conditioning]]. In the 1960s, some [[East Asia]]n manufacturers started exporting their ceiling fans to the [[United States]]. They caught on slowly at first, but found great success during the energy crisis of the late 1970s, since ceiling fans consume far less energy than air conditioning units. Due to this renewed commercial success, many American manufacturers started to produce (or significantly increase production of) ceiling fans, resulting in a revival of interest in the product. The well-known Casablanca Fan Company was founded in 1974. Other popular American manufacturers at the time included the Hunter Fan Co. (which was then a division of Robbins & Myers, Inc), FASCO (F. A. Smith Co.), [[Emerson Electric]], and Lasko; the latter two were often relabeled and sold by [[Sears-Roebuck]]. During the rest of the 1970s, and through to the late 1980s, ceiling fans remained popular in the American market. Many small American manufacturers, most of them rather short-lived, started making ceiling fans. Throughout the 1980s, the balance of sales between American-made ceiling fans and those imported from [[Asia]]n manufacturers changed dramatically. The high cost of American parts and labor became prohibitive for many consumers (for example, a ''basic'' American-made ceiling fan could cost anywhere from $100 to $250, whereas the cost of the ''fanciest'' imported fans rarely exceeded $85). Due to the ever-reducing cost of amenities such as [[air conditioning]], ceiling fan sales once again started to decline, beginning in the early- to mid-1990s. With the reduction in sales came a reduction in research and development, as well as features. Once-standard features (such as solid wood blades, built-in [[Potentiometer|variable-speed dials]], high-quality stator/rotor ("stack") motors, and die-cast steel construction) have been largely replaced by cheap, standardized parts. Since 2000 there have been important inroads made by companies offering higher price ceiling fans with more decorative value. In 2001, Washington Post writer Patricia Dane Rogers<ref name="Washington Post">{{cite article |last=Dane Roger |first=Patricia |title=Eye on Design, Washington Post June 14, 2001|origyear=June 14, 2001 |pages=H5}}</ref> wrote, “Like so many other mundane household objects, these old standbys are going high-style and high-tech.” Newer companies such as Minka, Fanimation, The Modern Fan Co., The Period Arts Fan Co. and Monte Carlo brought well-built fans with distinctive design to the market. ==Uses== Unlike air conditioners, fans only move air—they do not directly change its temperature. Therefore ceiling fans that have a mechanism for reversing the direction in which the blades rotate (most commonly an electrical switch on the side of the unit) can help in both heating and cooling. In summer, the fan's direction of rotation should be set so that air is blown downward (Usually counter-clockwise. The blades should lead with the up turned side as they spin). The breeze created by a ceiling fan speeds the evaporation of perspiration on human skin, which makes the body's natural cooling mechanism much more efficient. Since the fan works directly on the body, rather than by changing the temperature of the air, during the summer it is a waste of electricity to leave a ceiling fan on when no one is in a room. In winter, ceiling fans should be set to turn the opposite direction (usually
