to the operating system. This windowing format has been criticised and where some attention to the user interface is being debated.<ref> {{cite web |url = http://blogs.gnome.org/bolsh/2006/09/18/the-gimp-usability/ |title = The GIMP usability |accessdate = 2007-07-29 |author=Dave Neary |date=18 September 2006 | work = Safe as Milk blog}} </ref> Because GIMP uses multiple windows a given user must place each window in a functional location. Other user concerns for windowing include a situation where the toolbox and layer windows end up hidden behind unrelated application windows. This occurs less often in recent versions, where GIMP tells desktop environments how to handle its windows. In order to construct its interface GIMP uses the [[GTK+|GIMP tool kit]] (GTK+). GTK+ was designed to replace [[Motif (widget toolkit)|Motif]], a [[proprietary software|proprietary]] toolkit upon which GIMP depended. Originally GTK+ was a part of the GIMP source tree, but has since been made into a standalone library. While originally being designed to run on [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s, GIMP and GTK+ have been ported to Microsoft Windows, [[Mac OS X]], and other operating systems. ====GIMP usability team==== GIMP contributors signed up to join the [[OpenUsability]] project.<ref> {{cite web |author=Ellen Reitmayr |title=2007 Success Stories |url=http://www.openusability.org/index.php/2008/01/2007-success-stories/ |date=1 January 2008 |publisher=openusability.org |accessdate=5 July 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}} </ref> Since then a dedicated usability team has been established to guide the future of the GIMP interface.

The use of single window mode will be optional. ==Media attention== As a popular application, GIMP is regularly reviewed. The reviews often examine the fitness of GIMP for use in professional environments; as such GIMP is often cited as a replacement for [[Adobe Photoshop]].<ref name="ars-2.6"> {{cite web |title=GIMP 2.6 released, one step closer to taking on Photoshop |url=http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2008/10/gimp-2-6-released-one-step-closer-to-taking-on-photoshop.ars |date=1 October 2008 |publisher=Ars Technica |author=Ryan Paul |accessdate=2 July 2009}} </ref><ref> {{cite web |url= http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/1998/03/10975 |title=A Thrifty Photoshop Built for the Web |publisher=wired.com |date=1998-03-17|accessdate=2009-07-31}} </ref> Even though comparisons to Photoshop are of regular occurrence, the maintainers of GIMP state that GIMP does not aim to replicate Photoshop.<ref> {{cite web |title=GIMP Developers Conference 2006 |url=http://developer.gimp.org/gimpcon/2006/index.html#vision |year=2006 |publisher=the GIMP project |accessdate=2 July 2009}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}} </ref> GIMP 2.6 has been reviewed twice by [[Ars Technica]]. In the first review, Ryan Paul noted that GIMP provides "Photoshop-like capabilities and offers a broad feature set that has made it popular with amateur artists and open source fans. Although GIMP is generally not regarded as a sufficient replacement for high-end commercial tools, it is beginning to gain some acceptance in the pro market."<ref name="ars-2.6" /> While previously it had been recognized that GIMP had extensive capabilities, few reviewers have cited GIMP as a tool used in professional environments.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Dave Girard also reviewed GIMP 2.6, specifically with the aim of testing GIMP's fitness for professional tasks. He noted at the beginning that GIMP was a high-end tool, but the review conclusion noted that although many of GIMP's tools were of high quality, he felt that it lacked in some areas such as [[non-destructive editing]], tools such as a saturation brush and that GIMP did not integrate well to Mac OS X; Dave Girard recognized however that OS X is not the native platform of GIMP.<ref> {{cite web |author=Dave Girard |title=Suite freedom: a review of GIMP 2.6.4 |url=http://arstechnica.com/media/news/2009/01/gimp-2-6-review.ars |date=13 January 2009 |publisher=ars technica |accessdate=5 July 2009}} </ref><ref> {{cite web |author=Dave Girard |title=Suite freedom: a review of GIMP 2.6.4 (page 11) |url=http://arstechnica.com/media/news/2009/01/gimp-2-6-review.ars/11 |date=13 January 2009 |publisher=ars technica |accessdate=5 July 2009}} </ref> ==Features== {{See|Comparison of raster graphics editors}} [[File:Gimp brushes.png|thumb |Brushes dialogue in [[GNOME]]]] Tools used to manipulate images can be accessed via the toolbox, through menus and dialogue windows. They include filters and brushes, as well as transformation, selection, layer and masking tools. * ''Color'': GIMP has several ways of selecting colors including palettes, color choosers and using an eyedropper tool to select a color on the canvas. The built in color choosers include [[RGB color model|RGB]]/[[HSV color space|HSV]] selector or scales, water-color selector, [[CMYK color model|CMYK]] (cyan, magenta, yellow, key (black)) selector and a color-wheel selector. Colors can also be selected using hexadecimal color codes as used in HTML color selection. GIMP has native support for indexed color and [[RGB]] color spaces, other color spaces are supported using decomposition where each channel of the new color space becomes a black and white image. CMYK, [[Lab color space|LAB]] and [[HSL and HSV|HSV]] ([[hue]], [[colorfulness|saturation]], [[Value (colorimetry)|value]]) are supported this way.<ref>{{cite web |author=Yoshinori Yamakawa|title=Separate+ |url=http://cue.yellowmagic.info/softwares/separate.html |date=6 January 2007 |publisher=cue.yellowmagic.info |accessdate=2 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=The GIMP documentation team |title=Decompose |url=http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/plug-in-decompose-registered.html|work=GIMP user manual |publisher=docs.gimp.org |accessdate=2 July 2009}}</ref> Color blending can be achieved using the blend tool, by applying a [[Image gradient|gradient]] to the surface of an image and using GIMP's color modes. Gradients are also integrated into tools such as the brush tool, when the user paints this way the output color slowly changes. There are a number of default gradients included with GIMP, a user can also create custom gradients with tools provided. * ''Selections and paths'': in GIMP there are several tools that can be used to create [[selection (user interface)|selection]]s including a rectangular and circular selection tool, free select tool, and fuzzy select tool (also known as magic wand). More advanced selection tools include the select by color tool for selecting contiguous regions of color and the scissors select tool which creates selections semi-automatically between areas of highly contrasting colors.
