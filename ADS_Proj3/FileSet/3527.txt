detect the changes in position.<ref>"mouse." [[Free On-line Dictionary of Computing|FOLDOC]]. 19 September 2006. <http://foldoc.org/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?mouse></ref> ===== Mini-mouse ===== A [[Mini-mouse]] is a small egg-sized mouse for use with [[laptop computer]]s; usually small enough for use on a free area of the laptop body itself, it is typically [[Mouse (computing)#Optical mice|optical]], includes a [[retractable cord]] and uses a [[USB]] port to save battery life. ==== Trackball ==== {{Main|Trackball}} A [[trackball]] is a pointing device consisting of a ball housed in a socket containing sensors to detect rotation of the ball about two axes, similar to an upside-down mouse: as the user rolls the ball with a thumb, fingers, or palm the mouse cursor on the screen will also move. Tracker balls are commonly used on CAD workstations for ease of use, where there may be no desk space on which to use a mouse. Some are able to clip onto the side of the keyboard and have buttons with the same functionality as mouse buttons.<ref>"tracker ball." FOLDOC. 19 September 2006. <http://foldoc.org/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?tracker+ball></ref> There are also wireless trackballs which offer a wider range of ergonomic positions to the user. ==== Joystick ==== * Isotonic joysticks are handle sticks where the user can freely change the position of the stick, with more or less constant force. ** [[Joystick]] ** [[Analog stick]] * Isometric joysticks – where the user controls the stick by varying the amount of force they push with, and the position of the stick remains more or less constant. ==== Pointing stick ==== A [[pointing stick]] is a pressure sensitive small nub used like a joystick. It's usually found on laptops embedded between the 'G', 'H', and 'B' keys. It operates by sensing the force applied by the user. The corresponding "mouse" buttons are commonly placed just below the [[Space bar|spacebar]]. It is also found on mice and some desktop keyboards. ==== Roller Mouse ==== A [[Roller Mouse]] is a pointing device which unique feature is the use of sensors of different operating principle for vertical and horizontal movement of the pointer. === Based on touching a surface === ==== Touchpad ==== A [[touchpad]] or '''trackpad''' is a flat surface that can detect finger contact. It's a stationary pointing device, commonly used on [[Laptop|laptop computers]]. At least one physical button normally comes with the touchpad, but the user can also generate a mouse click by tapping on the pad. Advanced features include pressure sensitivity and special gestures such as scrolling by moving one's finger along an edge. It uses a two-layer grid of [[electrode]]s to measure finger movement: one layer has vertical electrode strips that handle vertical movement, and the other layer has horizontal electrode strips to handle horizontal movements.<ref>"touchpad." FOLDOC. 19 September 2006. <http://foldoc.org/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?trackpad></ref> ==== Graphics tablet ==== [[File:Wacom Graphire4 tablet.jpg|thumb|A [[graphics tablet]] with a pen]] A '''[[graphics tablet]]''' or '''digitizing tablet''' is a special tablet similar to a touchpad, but controlled with a pen or stylus that is held and used like a normal pen or pencil. The thumb usually controls the clicking via a two-way<!-- two-way? --> button on the top of the pen, or by tapping on the tablet's surface. A cursor (also called a puck) is similar to a mouse, except that it has a window with cross hairs for pinpoint placement, and it can have as many as 16 buttons. A pen (also called a stylus) looks like a simple ballpoint pen but uses an electronic head instead of ink. The tablet contains electronics that enable it to detect movement of the cursor or pen and translate the movements into digital signals that it sends to the computer."<ref>"digitizing tablet." Webopedia.com. 19 September 2006. <http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/digitizing_tablet.html></ref> This is different from a mouse because each point on the tablet represents a point on the screen. ==== Touchscreen ==== A '''[[touchscreen]]''' is a device embedded into the screen of the TV monitor, or system [[LCD]] monitor screens of [[laptop]] computers. Users interact with the device by physically pressing items shown on the screen, either with their fingers or some helping tool. Several technologies can be used to detect touch. Resistive and capacitive touchscreens have conductive materials embedded in the glass and detect the position of the touch by measuring changes in electric current. [[Infrared]] controllers project a grid of infrared beams inserted into the frame surrounding the monitor screen itself, and detect where an object intercepts the beams. Modern touchscreens could be used in conjunction with [[stylus]] pointing devices, while those powered by infrared do not require physical touch, but just recognize the movement of hand and fingers in some minimum range distance from the real screen. Touchscreens are becoming popular with the introduction of [[palmtop]] computers like those sold by the [[Palm, Inc.]] hardware manufacturer, some high range classes of laptop computers, mobile [[smartphones]] like [[High Tech Computer Corporation|HTC]] or the [[Apple Inc.]] [[iPhone]], and the availability of standard touchscreen device drivers into the [[Symbian]], [[Palm OS]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Vista]] operating systems. == Other devices == * A '''[[Light pen|lightpen]]''' is a device similar to a touch screen, but uses a special light sensitive pen instead of the finger, which allows for more accurate screen input. As the tip of the light pen makes contact with the screen, it sends a signal back to the computer containing the [[coordinate]]s of the [[pixel]]s at that point. It can be used to draw on the computer screen or make menu selections, and does not require a special touch screen because it can work with any [[Cathode ray tube|CRT-based monitor]]. * [[light gun]] *Palm mouse – held in the palm and operated with only two buttons; the movements across the screen correspond to a feather touch, and pressure increases the speed of movement. *[[Footmouse]] – sometimes called a mole - a mouse variant for those who do not wish to or cannot use the hands or the head; instead, it provides footclicks. *Similar to a mouse is a puck, which, rather than tracking the speed of the device,
