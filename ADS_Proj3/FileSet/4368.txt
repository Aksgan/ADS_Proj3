travelling in and controlling their environment. Recent technological developments, including the [[printing press]], the [[telephone]], and the [[Internet]], have lessened physical barriers to [[communication]] and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. However, not all technology has been used for peaceful purposes; the development of [[weapon]]s of ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history, from [[club (weapon)|clubs]] to [[nuclear weapon]]s. Technology has affected [[society]] and its surroundings in a number of ways. In many societies, technology has helped develop more advanced [[economy|economies]] (including today's [[economic globalization|global economy]]) and has allowed the rise of a [[leisure]] [[Social class|class]]. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as [[pollution]], and deplete natural resources, to the detriment of the [[Earth]] and its [[natural environment|environment]]. Various implementations of technology influence the [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of [[Efficient energy use|efficiency]] in terms of human productivity, a term originally applied only to machines, and the challenge of traditional norms. Philosophical debates have arisen over the present and future use of technology in society, with disagreements over whether technology improves the [[human condition]] or worsens it. [[Neo-Luddism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], and similar movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, opining that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as [[transhumanism]] and [[techno-progressivism]] view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition. Indeed, until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but recent scientific studies indicate that other [[primates]] and certain [[dolphin]] communities have developed simple tools and learned to pass their knowledge to other generations. ==Definition and usage== [[File:Handtiegelpresse von 1811.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The invention of the [[printing press]] made it possible for scientists and [[politician]]s to communicate their ideas with ease, leading to the [[Age of Enlightenment]]; an example of technology as a cultural force.]] The use of the term ''technology'' has changed significantly over the last 200 years. Before the 20th century, the term was uncommon in English, and usually referred to the description or study of the useful arts.<ref name="Crabb">For ex., George Crabb, [http://www.archive.org/stream/universaltechno01crabgoog#page/n525 ''Universal Technological Dictionary, or Familiar Explanation of the Terms Used in All Arts and Sciences, Containing Definitions Drawn From the Original Writers''], (London: Baldwin, Cradock and Joy, 1823), s.v. "technology."</ref> The term was often connected to technical education, as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (chartered in 1861).<ref name="Stratton">Julius Adams Stratton and Loretta H.

ISBN 0262195240.</ref> "Technology" rose to prominence in the 20th century in connection with the [[second industrial revolution]]. The meanings of technology changed in the early 20th century when American social scientists, beginning with [[Thorstein Veblen]], translated ideas from the German concept of [[:de:Technik|Technik]] into "technology." In German and other European languages, a distinction exists between ''Technik'' and ''Technologie'' that is absent in English, as both terms are usually translated as "technology." By the 1930s, "technology" referred not to the study of the industrial arts, but to the industrial arts themselves.<ref name="Schatzberg">Eric Schatzberg, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/technology_and_culture/v047/47.3schatzberg.html "''Technik'' Comes to America: Changing Meanings of ''Technology'' Before 1930,"] ''Technology and Culture'' 47 (July 2006): 486-512.</ref> In 1937, the American sociologist Read Bain wrote that "technology includes all tools, machines, utensils, weapons, instruments, housing, clothing, communicating and transporting devices and the skills by which we produce and use them."<ref name="Bain">Read Bain, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2084365 "Technology and State Government,"] American Sociological Review 2 (December 1937): 860.</ref> Bain's definition remains common among scholars today, especially social scientists. But equally prominent is the definition of technology as applied science, especially among scientists and engineers, although most social scientists who study technology reject this definition.<ref name="MacKenzie">Donald A. MacKenzie and Judy Wajcman, "Introductory Essay" in ''The Social Shaping of Technology'', 2nd ed. (Buckingham, England : Open University Press, 1999) ISBN 0-335-19913-5.</ref> More recently, scholars have borrowed from European philosophers of "technique" to extend the meaning of technology to various forms of instrumental reason, as in Foucault's work on [[technologies of the self]] ("techniques de soi"). Dictionaries and scholars have offered a variety of definitions. The [[Merriam-Webster]] dictionary offers a definition of the term: "the practical application of knowledge especially in a particular area" and "a capability given by the practical application of knowledge".<ref name="mwdict" /> [[Ursula Franklin]], in her 1989 "Real World of Technology" lecture, gave another definition of the concept; it is "practice, the way we do things around here".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.anansi.ca/titles.cfm?series_id=4&pub_id=58 | title=Real World of Technology | accessdate=2007-02-13 | author=Franklin, Ursula | publisher=[[House of Anansi Press]]}}</ref> The term is often used to imply a specific field of technology, or to refer to [[high technology]] or just [[consumer electronics]], rather than technology as a whole.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/default.stm | title=Technology news | accessdate=2006-02-17 | publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> [[Bernard Stiegler]], in ''[[Technics and Time, 1]]'', defines technology in two ways: as "the pursuit of life by means other than life", and as "organized inorganic matter."<ref>{{cite book | last=Stiegler |first=Bernard | title=[[Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus]] | year=1998 |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] | isbn=0-8047-3041-3 | pages=17, 82}} Stiegler has more recently stated that [[biotechnology]] can no longer be defined as "organized inorganic matter," given that it is, rather, "the reorganization of the organic." {{cite book | last=Stiegler |first=Bernard | title=L'avenir du passé: Modernité de l'archéologie | year=2008 |publisher=La Découverte | isbn=2-7071-5495-4 | page=23}}</ref> Technology can be most broadly defined as the entities, both material and immaterial, created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value. In this usage, technology refers to tools and machines that may be used to solve real-world problems. It is a far-reaching term that may include simple tools, such as a [[Crowbar (tool)|crowbar]] or wooden [[spoon]], or more complex machines, such as a [[space station]] or [[particle accelerator]]. Tools and machines need not be material; virtual technology, such as [[computer software]] and [[business method]]s, fall under this definition of technology.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind02/c6/c6s5.htm
