[[Linnaean taxonomy]] with links to [[Wikipedia]] articles on individual species by April 2005.<ref name=AS /> ==History== [[:species:User:Benedikt|Benedikt Mandl]] co-ordinated the efforts of several people who are interested in getting involved with the project and contacted potential supporters in early summer 2004. Databases were evaluated and the administrators contacted, some of them have agreed on providing their data for Wikispecies. Benedikt Mandl defined two major tasks: # Figure out how the contents of the data base would need to be presented — by asking experts, potential non-professional users and comparing that with existing data bases. # Figure out how to do the software, which hardware is required and how to cover the costs — by asking experts, looking for fellow volunteers and potential sponsors. Advantages and disadvantages were widely discussed by the wikimedia-I mailing list. The board of directors of the wikimedia foundation voted by 4 to 0 in favor of the establishment of a Wikispecies. The project was launched in August 2004 and is hosted at http://species.wikimedia.org. It was officially merged to a sister project of [[Wikimedia Foundation]] on September 14, 2004. On October 10, 2006, the project exceeded 75,000 articles. On May 20, 2007, the project exceeded 100,000 articles with a total of 5,495 registered users. On September 8, 2008, the project exceeded 150,000 articles with a total of 9,224 registered users. ==Policies== Wikispecies has disabled local upload and asks users to use images from [[commons:Main Page|Wikimedia Commons]].
