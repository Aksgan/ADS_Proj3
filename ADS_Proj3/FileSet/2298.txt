Developed by [[Sun Microsystems]], it is a textual representation of [[Formal grammar|grammars]] for use in [[speech recognition]] for technologies like [[XHTML+Voice]]. JSGF adopts the style and conventions of the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]] in addition to use of traditional grammar notations. The [[SRGS|Speech Recognition Grammar Specification]] was derived from this specification. ==Example1== The following JSGF grammar will recognize the words coffee, tea, and milk. #JSGF V1.0; grammar drinks; public <drinks> = coffee | tea | milk ==See also== * [[SRGS]] * [[XHTML+Voice]] == External links == * [http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/speech/forDevelopers/JSGF/index.html JSGF Grammar Format Specification] * [http://www.w3.org/TR/jsgf/ JSpeech Grammar Format (W3C Note)] [[Category:Speech recognition]] {{compu-prog-stub}} [[simple:JSGF]]</text> </page> <page> <id>19580</id> <title>JScript</title> <text>{{Multiple issues |citationstyle = July 2008 |refimprove = July 2008 }} {{Infobox programming language | name = JScript | logo = | file_ext = .js, .jse, .wsf, .wsc (.htm, .html, .asp) | paradigm = | year = 1996 | designer = | developer = [[Microsoft]] | latest_release_version = 5.8 | latest_release_date = March 2009 | typing = [[dynamic typing|dynamic]], [[weak typing|weak]], [[duck typing|duck]] | implementations = Windows Script, [[JScript .NET]] | dialects = | influenced by = [[JavaScript]] | influenced = | operating system = [[Microsoft Windows]] | license = | website = [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hbxc2t98(VS.85).aspx JScript] }} '''JScript''' is a scripting language based on the [[ECMAScript]] standard that is used in [[Microsoft]]'s [[Internet Explorer]]. JScript is implemented as a [[Windows Script]] engine. This means that it can be "plugged in" to any application that supports Windows Script, such as [[Internet Explorer]], [[Active Server Pages]], and [[Windows Script Host]]. It also means that any application supporting Windows Script can use multiple languages â€” JScript, [[VBScript]], [[Perl]], and others. JScript was first supported in the [[Internet_Explorer#Internet_Explorer_3|Internet Explorer 3.0]] browser released in August 1996. Its most recent version is JScript 5.8, included in Internet Explorer 8. Another dialect of JScript (as of 2004 - 2006) was [[JScript .NET]], which was based on the yet-unfinished edition 4 of the ECMAScript standard, and can be compiled for the [[Microsoft .NET]] platform. JScript.NET, which added several new features to ECMAScript ed. 3, such as optional static type annotations, appears no longer to be actively developed. ==Comparison to JavaScript== As explained by JavaScript guru [[Douglas Crockford]] in his talk entitled ''The JavaScript Programming Language'' on [[YUI Theater]], "[Microsoft] did not want to deal with Sun about the trademark issue, and so they called their implementation JScript. A lot of people think that JScript and JavaScript are different but similar languages. That's not the case. They are just different names for the same language, and the reason the names are different was to get around trademark issues." ===Differences from JavaScript=== Unlike JavaScript, JScript supports [[Conditional comment#Conditional Comment in JScript|conditional compilation.]] This allows a programmer to selectively execute code within [[Comparison of programming languages (syntax)#Block comments|block comments.]] ==Versions== ===JScript=== The original JScript is an [[Active Scripting]] engine. Like other Active Scripting languages, it is built on the [[OLE Automation|COM/OLE Automation]] platform and provides scripting capabilities to host applications. This is the version used when hosting JScript inside a Web page displayed by [[Internet Explorer]], in an [[HTA (programming language)|HTML application]], in [[Active Server Pages|classic ASP]], in [[Windows Script Host]] scripts and several other [[OLE Automation|Automation]] environments. JScript is sometimes referred to as "classic JScript" or "Active Scripting JScript" to differentiate it from newer .NET-based versions. Some versions of JScript are available for multiple versions of Internet Explorer and Windows. For example, JScript 5.7 was introduced with [[Internet Explorer 7|Internet Explorer 7.0]] and is also installed for [[Internet Explorer 6|Internet Explorer 6.0]] with [[Windows XP]] [[Windows XP#Service_Pack_3|Service Pack 3]], while JScript 5.8 was introduced with [[Internet Explorer 8|Internet Explorer 8.0]] and is also installed with Internet Explorer 6.0 on [[Windows Mobile#Windows_Mobile_6.5|Windows Mobile 6.5]]. {| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;" !
