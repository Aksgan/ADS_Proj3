Midway through the design of the Ford Taurus, prices had centered to around $1.50 a gallon. The design team decided they could build a larger, more comfortable, and more powerful car if the gas prices stayed low, so they redesigned the car. The Taurus launch set nationwide sales records when the new car came out, primarily because it was so roomy and comfortable to drive. In most cases, however, departing from the original requirements to that degree does not work. So the requirements document becomes a critical tool that helps the team make decisions about design changes. ===Construction and test=== In the construction and testing stage, the main activity of requirements management is to make sure that work and cost stay within schedule and budget, and that the emerging tool does in fact meet requirements. A main tool used in this stage is prototype construction and iterative testing. For a software application, the user interface can be created on paper and tested with potential users while the framework of the software is being built. Results of these tests are recorded in a user interface design guide and handed off to the design team when they are ready to develop the interface. This saves their time and makes their jobs much easier. ===Release=== Requirements management does not end with product release. From that point on, the data coming in about the application’s acceptability is gathered and fed into the Investigation phase of the next generation or release. Thus the process begins again. ==Tools== There exist both desktop and Web-based tools for requirements management. A Web-based requirements tool can be installed at the customer′s datacenter or can be offered as an on-demand requirements management platform which in some cases is completely free.<ref> {{cite web |url=http://www.incose.org/ProductsPubs/products/rmsurvey.aspx |title=Requirements Management Tools Survey |publisher=International Council on Systems Engineering |accessdate=2009-11-10 }}</ref> === Modeling Languages === The [[system engineering]] modeling language [[SysML]] incorporates a [[requirements diagram]] allowing the developer to graphically organize, manage, and trace requirements. === On-demand requirements management platforms === An on-demand requirements management platform is a fully hosted requirements management solution, where the only system requirements would normally be Internet access and a standard Web browser. The service would normally include all special hardware and software. Other services may include technology and processes designed to secure your data against physical loss and unauthorized use, 24×7 data availability, and assurance that the service will scale as you add users, applications, and additional activities. Some on-demand requirements management platforms charge a fee while others are free to use. ==See also== * [[Requirement]] * [[Requirements analysis]] * [[Requirements engineering]] * [[Requirements traceability]] * Process area (CMMI): ** [[Process area (CMMI)#Requirements Development (RD)|Requirements Development (RD)]] ** [[Process area (CMMI)#Requirements Management (REQM)|Requirements Management (REQM)]] * [[Product requirements document]] ==References== {{Reflist}} == Further reading == * {{Cite journal | author = [[CMMI]] Product Team | title = CMMI for Development, Version 1.2 | version = Technical Report CMU/SEI-2006-TR-008 | publisher = [[Software Engineering Institute]] | date = August 2006 | url = http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/abstracts/reports/06tr008.cfm | format = [[PDF]] | accessdate = 2008-01-22 }} * Colin Hood, Simon Wiedemann, Stefan Fichtinger, Urte Pautz ''Requirements Management: Interface Between Requirements Development and All Other Engineering Processes'' Springer, Berlin 2007, ISBN 354047689X ==External links== * [http://www.cognition.us/news/industry_report_142845a.html Critical Issues in Requirements Management - Panel Discussion with Executives from IBM/Rational, Cognition Corporation, PTC, Chrysler, and Siemens.] * [http://www.cognition.us/Presentations/RequirementsManagementSite.html Web 2.0 Requirements Management - What does it look like and why is it relevant?] * [http://software.forbes.com/requirements-management-software Forbes Requirements Management Software Directory] * [http://www.paper-review.com/tools/rms/read.php INCOSE Requirements Tools Survey] * [http://www.jiludwig.com/Requirements_Management_Tools.html Jiludwig Requirements Management Tools Directory] * [http://jonathanbabcock.com/2008/09/04/requirements-management-tool-resources/ Requirements Management Tool Resources] * [http://isb.wa.gov/policies/portfolio/tr25/tr25_l2a.html Washington State Information Services Board (ISB)policy: CMM Key Practices for Level 2 - Requirements Management] * [http://www.ogc.gov.uk/delivery_lifecycle_requirements_management.asp U.K. Office of Government Commerce (OGC) - Requirements management] * [http://www.nainil.com/blog/requirement-writing-for-product-management/ Requirement Writing 101 for Product Management] {{DEFAULTSORT:Requirements Management}} [[Category:Product lifecycle management]] [[Category:Systems engineering]] [[Category:Software requirements]] [[Category:SysML]] [[de:Anforderungsmanagement]] [[fr:Gestion des exigences]] [[ja:要求管理]] [[pl:Zarządzanie wymaganiami]] [[ru:Управление требованиями]] [[tr:Gereksinim yönetimi]] [[zh:需求管理]]</text> </page> <page> <id>31873</id> <title>Resampling</title> <text>{{wiktionary|resampling}} '''Resampling''' may refer to: * [[Resampling (audio)]], several related audio processes * [[Resampling (statistics)]], resampling methods in statistics * [[Resampling (bitmap)]], scaling of bitmap images * [[Sample rate conversion]] ==See also== * [[Downsampling]] * [[Upsampling]] * [[Oversampling]] * [[Sampling (information theory)]] * [[Signal (information theory)]] * [[Data conversion]] * [[Interpolation]] * [[Multivariate interpolation]] * [[Subsampling]] [[Category:Signal processing]] [[Category:Digital signal processing]] {{Link GA|ru}} [[cs:Převzorkování]] [[de:Resampling]] [[it:Ricampionamento]] [[ja:リサンプリング]] [[pl:Resampling]] [[ru:Передискретизация]]</text> </page> <page> <id>31874</id> <title>Resampling (audio)</title> <text>{{Otheruses|Resampling}} {{Unreferenced|date=May 2009}} '''Resampling''' is synonymous with several processes commonly used in manipulating audio, through which a segment of [[sample (signal)|sampled]] audio (often erroneously termed a sample) is manipulated before being stored back to a (possibly different) sampled format. ==Sample rate conversion== This operation in [[digital signal processing]] involves converting a sampled signal from one [[sampling frequency]] to another without changing the period of the sample as would occur if the sampled audio was played at the new rate directly. For instance, the output waveform of a [[digital audio workstation]] that was processed at 96 [[kHz]] must be resampled to 44.1 kHz to be placed on a [[Compact Disc]]. See [[sample rate conversion]]. ==Sample depth conversion== This operation in digital signal processing involves converting each sample of a sampled signal from one representation of amplitude to another. For instance, the output waveform of a digital audio workstation that was processed using 24 bits to represent amplitude would be resampled to 16 bits to be placed on a Compact Disc. See [[quantization (sound processing)]]. ==Mixing== The term "resampling" is often applied to short recordings completed before final [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixdown]] that are reused or substituted in the work, synonymous with bouncing as applied to [[multitrack recording]]. Such resampling was commonplace to work with the limitations of contemporary [[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]] or other [[Digital audio workstation|digital audio manipulation systems]], where memory or processor use could be reduced by combining several samples that would always sound simultaneously through recording their combination to make a new sample [[Category:Digital signal processing]] [[Category:Audio engineering]]</text> </page> <page> <id>31878</id> <title>Rescue
