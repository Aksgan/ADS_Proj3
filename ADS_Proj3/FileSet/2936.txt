of the simulator’s hardware, measurable in [[floating-point operations per second]] ([[FLOPS]]) and [[instructions per second]] (IPS). With the so-called ’’Basic Assembler Tool for MikroSim’’ MikroBAT, simple programs can be developed in [[Assembly language|assembler programming language]]. Here, all supported [[mnemonic]]s of the assembler programming language are determined by the user’s self created machine’s instruction set on micro instruction level. The add-on tool is able to translate the assembly language program into [[machine code]] and data and transferring the binary code into the external RAM for subsequent simulations. Together with MikroBAT the microcode simulator MikroSim supports the didactical introduction of teaching aspects in technical computer science from a switch-controlled calculating machine to a assembler programmable application. == See also == * [[Computer architecture simulator]] * [[Cycle Accurate Simulator]] * [[Educational programming language]] * [[Full system simulator]] * [[Instruction set simulator]] * [[Instrumentation (computer programming)]] * [[von Neumann architecture]] == Literature == * H.P.Gumm, M.Sommer: ''Einführung in die Informatik'', 8.

For instance, Mil-S-901D<ref>[http://www.chassis-plans.com/PDF/MIL-S-901D.pdf MIL-Std-901D]</ref> would indicate that the computer passed shock and vibration requirements of specific tests for Navy installation. Some of these tests are specific to application usage, such as barge explosion testing, which simulates a torpedo hit and subsequent high peak shock to a ship on which the computer is installed. 901D is divided into Grade A for "Items which are essential to the safety and continued combat capability of the ship" and Grade B for "items whose operation is not essential to the safety and combat capability of the ship but which could become a hazard to personnel, to Grade A items, of the ship as a whole as a result of exposure to shock". In this way, a computer may have a rating of MIL-Std-901D Grade A, which would tell a buyer which shock tests the computer survived, what level of shock resistance the unit has, and that this piece of equipment will continue to normally operate in the event of a specific shock level. Other MIL Standards and MIL Specs (Specifications) include testing for resistance to EMI/RFI bursts, environmental contaminants such as dust and gas, or temperature extremes. More on MIL Standards and Specifications at [[Defense Standard]]. [[Image:barge test preparation.jpg|thumb|Barge Explosion Test Preparation]] [[Image:barge explosion test.jpg|thumb|Actual Barge Explosion Test]] The "gold standard" of testing for compliance with 901D is the Barge Test. A Barge Test is performed four times, each time placing 60 lbs HBX-1 explosive 24 feet under water, starting at 40 feet away, then at 30, 25 and finally 20 feet. In addition, the tests are performed in a fore-and-aft orientation to simulate an explosion at the bow or stern of the ship and athwartship to simulate an explosion by the side of the ship. A [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5792069545817995838 video of a barge test] can be viewed. Typically a military computer is much more robust than an industrial computer enclosure. There will be more structure inside to support the components, the plug-in cards will be individually supported and secured to assure they do not pop out of their sockets, the processor and [[heat sink]] will be secured, memory will be glued into their sockets, and so forth. This is to assure nothing moves during the shock events. == Field risks == The progress of small-scale computer technology in military applications was initially slow due to concerns about security and the ability to survive rugged environments and enemy weaponry. PC-based technology in the 20th century was not robust enough to withstand combat conditions and severe environments. Hazards in the field include water and corrosives, sand and wind, extreme temperatures, high shock and vibration, power interruptions, susceptibility to EMI/RFI radiation, etc. Also, operator interface was complex, and most [[operating system]]s were not fast in operation, or easy to learn and use in pressure situations. In the last decade, improvements in design and operator interface have resulted in new mandates for the use of small computer technology in the military. Some of the improvements have migrated over from home and business computing. Others have migrated over from industrial computing, where designs for environments such as [[Electrical equipment in hazardous areas|Zone 1 hazardous areas]] in oil & gas exploration have been modified for army and navy environments. *Sealed enclosures using materials such as cast aluminum with magnesium have improved environmental resistance to contaminants and hazards, including EMI-burst weaponry. *Low-heat [[Central processing unit|CPU]] designs have made sealed enclosures possible even for environments like the desert or naval bridge wing display under the open sun. *Advances like [[flash memory]] have eliminated moving parts and reduced mechanical failures. *Simpler, effective
