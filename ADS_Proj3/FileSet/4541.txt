set of manageability enhancements under the brand name vPro. [[AMD]]'s platform is called Secure Execution Mode.<ref>[http://conference.digitalidworld.com/2004/attendees/slides/1027_1700_E1.pdf AMD Platform for Trustworthy Computing<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 2002-2003, Microsoft announced an initiative called [[Next-Generation Secure Computing Base]] (formerly Palladium). This was basically a vision of how a TPM 1.2 chip, CPU, chipset and software could provide an environment and a software ecosystem in which trusted applications (launched from within "regular" Windows) could be developed. Intel's TXT and AMD's SEM can be seen as realizations of the hardware side of the NGSCB vision. Owing to significant difficulties in creating a working implementation that third-party developers were interested in using and in unavailability of the enhancements to CPU and chipset, NGSCB was not included with Microsoft [[Windows Vista]]. Instead, Vista ships with a few technologies that can make use of a subset of the functions of the TPM chip (but not of Intel's TXT or AMD's SEM), such as [[BitLocker Drive Encryption]], and a new version of the [[Cryptographic Application Programming Interface|Microsoft Cryptography API]].<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/windowsvista/library/c61f2a12-8ae6-4957-b031-97b4d762cf31.mspx Windows Vista Technical Library Roadmap<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> ==Criticism== {{more2|Trusted Computing#Criticism}} The group has faced widescale opposition from the [[free software]] community on the grounds that the technology they are developing has a negative impact on the users' privacy and can create customer [[vendor lock-in|lock-in]], especially if it is used to create [[Digital rights management|DRM]] applications. It has received criticism from the [[GNU|GNU/Linux]] and [[FreeBSD]] communities, as well as the software development community in general. Significant backlash amongst the Trusted Computing Group was present during [[Richard Stallman]]'s speech at the [[Hackers on Planet Earth]] conference in July 2006, in New York. Richard Stallman and the [[Free Software Foundation]] have also criticized the group publicly in other speeches. The criticism calls Trusted Computing "Treacherous Computing" instead and warns that vendors can lock out software that is not officially signed by specific vendors, rendering it unusable.<ref>[http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/can-you-trust.html "Can you trust your computer?"] by [[Richard Stallman]], from the [[GNU Project]] website</ref> Privacy concerns with the TCG revolve around the fact that each TPM has a unique keypair, called the "endorsement key", that identifies the platform. In initial versions of the TPM (version 1.1), the TCG addressed privacy concerns by suggesting the use of a "Privacy [[Certificate authority|CA]]" that could certify [[pseudonymity|pseudonymous]] machine credentials. By having separate credentials for interacting with different parties, actions could not be linked, and so some level of privacy is provided. However, this requires trust in the Privacy CA, who could still link pseudonyms to the common, identifying machine credential. Since this left unresolved privacy concerns, version 1.2 of the TPM specification introduced "[[Direct anonymous attestation]]": a protocol based on the idea of a [[zero-knowledge proof]] which allows a TPM user to receive a certification in such a way that the Privacy CA would not be able to link requests to a single user or platform, while still being able to identify rogue TPMs. Privacy concerns for TPM were heightened when [[Christopher Tarnovsky]] presented methods to access and compromise the Infineon TPM non-volatile memory capacity which contains user data at [[Black Hat]] 2010.<ref>[https://media.blackhat.com/bh-dc-10/video/Tarnovsky_Chris/BlackHat-DC-2010-Tarnovsky-DeconstructProcessor-video.m4v] by Christopher Tarnovsky from Flylogic.net</ref> ==ISO standardization == Efforts to have the TCG specifications standardized by ISO was active for a first part in October 2007. Member states of the ISO/DIS JTC1 were expected to send their opinion to ISO by July 24, 2008. On May 18, 2009, TCG managed to achieve standardization for their TPM specifications: * ISO/IEC 11889-1:2009 Information technology—Trusted Platform Module—Part 1: Overview * ISO/IEC 11889-2:2009 Information technology—Trusted Platform Module—Part 2: Design principles * ISO/IEC 11889-3:2009 Information technology—Trusted Platform Module—Part 3: Structures * ISO/IEC 11889-4:2009 Information technology—Trusted Platform Module—Part 4: Commands ==Members== As of May 2008<ref>[https://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/about/members/ TCG Current Members] from the TCG website</ref>, about 130 enterprises are promoters of, contributors to, or adopters of TCG specifications. Membership fees vary by level. Promoters pay annual membership fees of $55,000, contributors pay $16,500, and depending upon company size, adopters pay annual membership fees of either $1,000 or $8,250.<ref>[https://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/join/levels/ Trusted Computing Group: Levels of Membership<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> {{col-begin}} {{col-3}} ===Promoters=== # [[AMD]] # [[Fujitsu]] # [[Hewlett-Packard]] # [[IBM]] # [[Infineon]] # [[Intel Corporation]] # [[Lenovo|Lenovo Holdings Limited]] # [[Microsoft]] # [[Sun Microsystems|Sun Microsystems, Inc.]] # [[Seagate Technology|Seagate]] # [http://www.wave.com Wave Systems Corp] {{col-3}} ===Contributors=== # [[American Megatrends|American Megatrends, Inc.]] # [http://www.amossys.fr AMOSSYS] # [[Aruba Networks]] # [[Atmel]] # [http://www.authentec.com/ AuthenTec, Inc.] # [[Broadcom Corporation]] # [[Certicom Corp.]] # [[Citrix Systems|Citrix Systems, Inc]] # Decru # [[Dell, Inc.]] # [[DataPlay|DPHI, Inc.]] # [[Emulex Corporation]] # [[Enterasys Networks]] # [[Sony Ericsson|Ericsson Mobile Platforms AB]] # [[ETRI]] # [[Extreme Networks]] # [[Freescale Semiconductor]] # [[Fujitsu Siemens Computers]] # [[Gemalto|Gemalto NV]] # [[General Dynamics C4 Systems]] # [[Giesecke & Devrient]] # [[Green Hills Software|Green Hills Software, Inc.]] # [[HID Global]] # [[Hitachi, Ltd.]] # [[Huawei|Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.]] # Identity Engines # [[Infoblox]] # [[Insyde Software|Insyde Software Corp.]] # [[InterDigital Communications, LLC]] # ITE Tech Inc. # [[Juniper Networks, Inc.]] # [http://www.lancope.com Lancope, Inc.] # [[Lexar|Lexar Media, Inc.]] # [[Lexmark International]] # [[LSI Logic]] # [[Lumeta]] # [http://www.marvell.com Marvell Semiconductor, Inc.] # [[McAfee|McAfee, Inc.]] # [http://www.mobilearmor.com Mobile Armor, Inc.] # [[NEC]] # [[Nokia]] # [[Nokia#Nokia Siemens Networks|Nokia Siemens Networks GmbH & Co.
