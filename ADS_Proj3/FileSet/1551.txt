a function appeared whose [[Graph of a function|graph]] would today be considered fractal, when [[Karl Weierstrass]] gave an [[Weierstrass function|example]] of a function with the non-[[intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] property of being everywhere [[continuous function|continuous]] but [[nowhere differentiable]]. In 1904, [[Helge von Koch]], dissatisfied with Weierstrass's abstract and analytic definition, gave a more geometric definition of a similar function, which is now called the [[Koch curve]]. (The image at right is three Koch curves put together to form what is commonly called the [[Koch snowflake]].) [[Wacław Sierpiński]] constructed his [[Sierpinski triangle|triangle]] in 1915 and, one year later, his [[Sierpinski carpet|carpet]]. Originally these geometric fractals were described as curves, rather than the 2D shapes that they are known as in their modern constructions. The idea of self-similar curves was taken further by [[Paul Pierre Lévy]], who, in his 1938 paper ''Plane or Space Curves and Surfaces Consisting of Parts Similar to the Whole'' described a new fractal curve, the [[Lévy C curve]]. [[Georg Cantor]] also gave examples of [[subset]]s of the real line with unusual properties—these [[Cantor set]]s are also now recognized as fractals. Iterated functions in the [[complex plane]] were investigated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by [[Henri Poincaré]], [[Felix Klein]], [[Pierre Fatou]] and [[Gaston Julia]]. Without the aid of modern computer graphics, however, they lacked the means to visualize the beauty of many of the objects that they had discovered. In the 1960s, [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] started investigating self-similarity in papers such as ''[[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension]]'', which built on earlier work by [[Lewis Fry Richardson]]. Finally, in 1975 Mandelbrot coined the word "fractal" to denote an object whose [[Hausdorff dimension|Hausdorff–Besicovitch dimension]] is greater than its [[topological dimension]]. He illustrated this mathematical definition with striking computer-constructed visualizations. These images captured the popular imagination; many of them were based on recursion, leading to the popular meaning of the term "fractal". ==Examples== [[Image:Julia set (indigo).png|thumb|A [[Julia set]], a fractal related to the Mandelbrot set]] A class of examples is given by the [[Cantor set]]s, [[Sierpinski triangle]] and [[Sierpinski carpet|carpet]], [[Menger sponge]], [[dragon curve]], [[space-filling curve]], and [[Koch snowflake|Koch curve]]. Additional examples of fractals include the [[Lyapunov fractal]] and the limit sets of [[Kleinian group]]s. Fractals can be [[deterministic]] (all the above) or [[stochastic]] (that is, non-deterministic). For example, the trajectories of the [[Brownian motion]] in the plane have a Hausdorff dimension of 2. [[Chaos theory|Chaotic dynamical systems]] are sometimes associated with fractals. Objects in the [[phase space]] of a [[dynamical system]] can be fractals (see [[attractor]]). Objects in the [[parameter space]] for a family of systems may be fractal as well. An interesting example is the [[Mandelbrot set]]. This set contains whole discs, so it has a Hausdorff dimension equal to its topological dimension of 2—but what is truly surprising is that the [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] of the Mandelbrot set also has a Hausdorff dimension of 2 (while the topological dimension of 1), a result proved by [[Mitsuhiro Shishikura]] in 1991. A closely related fractal is the [[Julia set]]. ==Generating fractals== <table style="float:right;width:130px;padding-left:20px"> <tr><td>[[Image:Mandelbrot-similar-x1.jpg|The whole Mandelbrot set]] <tr><td>[[Image:Mandelbrot-similar-x6.jpg|Mandelbrot zoomed 6x]] <tr><td>[[Image:Mandelbrot-similar-x100.jpg|Mandelbrot Zoomed 100x]] <tr><td>[[Image:Mandelbrot-similar-x2000.jpg|Mandelbrot Zoomed 2000x]] <small>Even 2000 times magnification of the Mandelbrot set uncovers fine detail resembling the full set.</small></table> Four common techniques for generating fractals are: * '''Escape-time fractals''' – (also known as "orbits" fractals) These are defined by a [[formula]] or [[recurrence relation]] at each point in a space (such as the [[complex plane]]). Examples of this type are the [[Mandelbrot set]], [[Julia set]], the [[Burning Ship fractal]], the [[Nova fractal]] and the [[Lyapunov fractal]]. The 2d vector fields that are generated by one or two iterations of escape-time formulae also give rise to a fractal form when points (or pixel data) are passed through this field repeatedly. * '''[[Iterated function system]]s''' – These have a fixed geometric replacement rule. [[Cantor set]], [[Sierpinski carpet]], [[Sierpinski gasket]], [[Peano curve]], [[Koch snowflake]], [[dragon curve|Harter-Highway dragon curve]], [[T-Square (fractal)|T-Square]], [[Menger sponge]], are some examples of such fractals. * '''Random fractals''' – Generated by stochastic rather than deterministic processes, for example, trajectories of the [[Brownian motion]], [[Lévy flight]], [[fractal landscapes]] and the [[Brownian tree]]. The latter yields so-called mass- or dendritic fractals, for example, [[diffusion-limited aggregation]] or [[reaction-limited aggregation]] clusters. * '''Strange attractors''' – Generated by iteration of a map or the solution of a system of initial-value differential equations that exhibit chaos. ==Classification== Fractals can also be classified according to their self-similarity. There are three types of self-similarity found in fractals: * '''Exact self-similarity''' – This is the strongest type of self-similarity; the fractal appears identical at different scales. Fractals defined by [[iterated function]] systems often display exact self-similarity. For example, the [[Sierpinski triangle]] and [[Koch snowflake]] exhibit exact self-similarity. * '''Quasi-self-similarity''' – This is a looser form of self-similarity; the fractal appears approximately (but not exactly) identical at different scales. Quasi-self-similar fractals contain small copies of the entire fractal in distorted and degenerate forms. Fractals defined by [[recurrence relation]]s are usually quasi-self-similar but not exactly self-similar. The [[Mandelbrot set]] is quasi-self-similar, as the satellites are approximations of the entire set, but not exact copies. * '''Statistical self-similarity''' – This is the weakest type of self-similarity; the fractal has numerical or statistical measures which are preserved across scales. Most reasonable definitions of "fractal" trivially imply some form of statistical self-similarity. ([[Fractal dimension]] itself is a numerical measure which is preserved across scales.) Random fractals are examples of fractals which are statistically self-similar, but neither exactly nor quasi-self-similar. The coastline of Britain is another example; one cannot expect to find microscopic Britains (even distorted ones) by looking at a small section of the coast with a magnifying glass. Possessing self-similarity is not the sole criterion for an object to be termed a fractal. Examples of self-similar objects that are not fractals include the logarithmic spiral and straight lines, which do contain copies of themselves at increasingly small scales. These do not qualify, since they have the same [[Hausdorff dimension]] as [[topological dimension]]. ==In nature== Approximate
