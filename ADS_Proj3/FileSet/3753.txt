formally termed [[triple modular redundancy]] (TMR). An error in one component may then be out-voted by the other two. In a triply redundant system, the system has three sub components, all three of which must fail before the system fails. Since each one rarely fails, and the sub components are expected to fail independently, the probability of all three failing is calculated to be extremely small. Redundancy may also be known by the terms "'''majority voting systems'''"{{ref|votinglogic1}} or "'''voting logic'''".{{ref|votinglogic2}} [[File:Bridge-suspension.svg|thumb|A Suspension Bridge's numerous cables are a form of redundancy.]] == Forms of redundancy == There are four major forms of redundancy, these are: * Hardware redundancy, such as [[Dual modular redundant|DMR]] and [[Triple modular redundancy|TMR]] * Information redundancy, such as [[Error detection and correction]] methods * Time redundancy, including transient fault detection methods such as '''Alternate Logic''' * Software redundancy such as [[N-version programming]] == Calculating the probability of system failure == Each duplicate component added to the system decreases the probability of system failure according to the formula: :<math>{p}= \prod_{i=1}^{n} p_{i} </math> where: * <math>n</math> - number of components * <math> p_{i} </math> - probability of component i failing * <math>p</math> - the probability of all components failing (system failure) This formula assumes independence of failure events. That means that the probability of a component B failing given that a component A has already failed is the same as that of B failing when A has not failed. There are situations where this is unreasonable, such as using two power supplies connected to the same socket, whereby if one socket failed, the other would too. It also assumes that at only one component is needed to keep the system running. If <math>m</math> components are needed for the system to survive, out of <math>n</math>, the probability of failure is{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} <math>{P}= 1 - ((1 - p)^{(n-m)} C^m_n ) </math> , Assuming all components have equal probability, <math>p</math>, of failure This model is probably unrealistic in that it assumes that components are not replaced in time when they fail. == See also == {{col-begin}} <p></p> | width="50%" align="{{{align|left}}}" valign="{{{valign|top}}}" style="border:0"| * [[Common mode failure]] * [[Data redundancy]] * [[Double switching]] * [[Fault tolerant design]] * [[Radiation hardening]] * [[Factor of safety]] <p></p> | width="50%" align="{{{align|left}}}" valign="{{{valign|top}}}" style="border:0"| * [[Reliability engineering]] * [[Reliability theory of aging and longevity]] * [[Safety engineering]] * [[Self-healing ring]] *[[MTBF]] {{col-end}} == References == # {{note|spaceshuttle}} [http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/201/ibmrd2001E.pdf Redundancy Management Technique for Space Shuttle Computers] (PDF), IBM Research # {{note|Votinglogic1}}[http://www.elecdesign.com/Articles/ArticleID/6886/6886.html Majority voting systems] # {{note|Votinglogic2}}[http://www.aero.org/publications/crosslink/summer2003/06.html Designing Integrated Circuits to Withstand Space Radiation] # {{note|powerline}}[http://www.yamar.com/The-Vehicle-Power-Line-as-a-Redundant-Channel-fo-CAN-Communication.pdf Using powerline as a redundant communication channel] ==External links== * [http://www.eu-sparc.net Secure Propulsion using Advanced Redundant Control] [[Category:Engineering concepts]] [[Category:Reliability engineering]] [[Category:Safety]] [[Category:Fault tolerance]] [[Category:Fault-tolerant computer systems]] [[ca:Sistemes redundants]] [[de:Redundanz (Technik)]] [[es:Sistema redundante]] [[it:Ridondanza (ingegneria)]] [[ja:冗長化]] [[pl:Redundancja#Inżynieria]] [[pt:Redundância (informática)]] [[ru:Резервирование]]</text> </page> <page> <id>31608</id> <title>Refense Technologies</title> <text>{{Infobox_Company <!-- infobox source: http://www.refense.com/wikipedia-info.txt --> | company_name = Refense Technologies, Inc. | logo = [[Image:Refense-Logo.png]] | company_type = [[Private company|Private]] | foundation = 2003 | location = [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], [[United States|USA]] | industry = [[Network Security]] | products = Refense VMS Enterprise<br />Refense OnDemand<br />Refense Mobile | homepage = [http://www.refense.com www.refense.com] }} '''Refense Technologies''' is a [[Network Security|network security]] company located in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], [[North Carolina]].<ref name='encoreii'>http://encoreii.commandinformation.com/refense.htm</ref> The privately owned company, founded in 2003, provides vulnerability and security [[risk management]] solutions for [[Mission Critical|mission critical]] network infrastructure,<ref>http://www.newsobserver.com/724/story/1357152.html</ref> and develops solutions to address security concerns with network devices.<ref>http://carolinanewswire.com/news/News.cgi?database=topstories.db&command=viewone&id=3707&op=t</ref> Refense Technologies focuses on vulnerability management solutions for network devices that enable enterprises to pinpoint vulnerabilities and provide actionable intelligence to mitigate the discovered deficiencies.
