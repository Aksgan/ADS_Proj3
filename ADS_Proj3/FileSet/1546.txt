a proposal to change the school's status to that of a [[foundation school]]. The governors argue that the increased autonomy from the LEA that foundation status provides would be beneficial to the school,<ref>{{cite paper|url=http://www.fortismere.haringey.sch.uk/docs/Gov%20Docs/FSC.pdf|title=Fortismere School – Foundation Status Informal Consultation|author=Fortismere School Governing Body|format=PDF}}</ref> which critics argue that the proposal is an attack on the school's comprehensive nature and would lead to a reduction in provision for pupils with [[special educational needs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keepfortismerecomprehensive.co.uk/|author=Keep Fortismere Comprehensive campaign|title=Keep Fortismere Comprehensive|accessdate=2007-04-26}}</ref> ===Foundation status=== On September 1, 2007, Fortismere became a Foundation school, as well as taking on a new joint specialist status in Maths/Computing with Music and a secondary specialism in Modern Languages. In December 2009, it was announced that the Head, Aydin Önaç, would be leaving in July 2010, at the end of the current academic year, after 5 years at the school. He will be joining St Olave's and St Saviour's Grammar School in Orpington, Greater London as their new Head. Mr Önaç is a prize-winning pianist. ==Notable alumni== [[Joel Defries]], current co-presenter of BBC's ''[[Blue Peter]]'' children's TV programme ===Tollington School=== * [[Kenneth Alfred Biggs]] [[George Cross|GC]] * [[Felix Aprahamian]], classical music concert organiser * [[Michael Casson]] OBE, potter * [[Air Vice-Marshal]] [[Grahame Dawson]] CBE CB, Chief Engineering Officer from 1938-40 of [[RAF Fighter Command]], and in charge of engine repairs during the [[Battle of Britain]] * Sir Hugh Ellis-Rees CB, UK Permanent Representative to the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|Organisation for European Economic Co-operation]] (OEEC - became the OECD in 1961) * Tom Lyon CBE, became Chairman of the [[Clam Brummer]] Group adhesives company, and formed the [[Confederation of British Industry]] (CBI) in 1965 from the [[Federation of British Industries]], the National Association of British Manufacturers, and the British Employers Confederation * [[W.

Characteristics determining the FEC of a higher-layer packet depend on the configuration of the router, but typically this is at least the destination IP address. [[Quality of service]] class is also often used. Thus, a '''Forward Equivalence Class''' tends to correspond to a [[label switched path]] (LSP). The reverse is not true, however: an LSP may be (and usually is) used for multiple FECs. * [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk436/tk428/technologies_q_and_a_item09186a00800949e5.shtml#qa4 MPLS FAQ For Beginners: What is a Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC)?] [[Category:MPLS networking]] [[de:Forwarding Equivalence Class]] [[it:Forwarding Equivalent Class]]</text> </page> <page> <id>14031</id> <title>Foton-M</title> <text>{{see also | Foton}} '''Foton-M''' is series of [[robotic spacecraft]] used by [[Russia]] and the [[European Space Agency]] for research conducted in the [[microgravity]] environment of Earth [[orbit]].
