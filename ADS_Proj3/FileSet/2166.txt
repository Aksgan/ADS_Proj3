It operates publicly under the name '''Actuarial Profession'''.<ref name="Actuarial Profession">[http://www.actuaries.org.uk Actuarial Profession].</ref> ==History== The Institute and Faculty of Actuaries came into being on 1 August 2010 as a result of the merger of the [[Institute of Actuaries]] and the [[Faculty of Actuaries]] in Scotland after voting members of both bodies voted to merge their respective organisations in a ballot held on 25 May 2010.<ref name="Full results of the merger ballot between the Faculty of Actuaries and the Institute of Actuaries">[http://www.actuaries.org.uk/news/press-releases/articles/full-results-merger-ballot-between-faculty-actuaries-and-institute-act-0 Actuarial Profession press release].</ref> ==Structure and governance== The [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] in Council granted an amendment effective 1 August 2010 to the Charter of the Institute of Actuaries in terms that converted it to the Charter for the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. The [[asset]]s, [[Liability|liabilities]] and membership rights of the Faculty of Actuaries in Scotland were transferred on this same day to the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries and the Charter of the Faculty of Actuaries in [[Scotland]] was surrendered. Essential elements of the merger arrangements, such as the Scottish constituency and its representation on the Council of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, are incorporated into the new governance documents. Authority for the governance, control and strategic direction of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries sits with the Council which will in turn delegate to various boards, committees and staff.<ref name="Structure">[http://www.actuaries.org.uk/about-us/pages/structure-0 Actuarial Profession].</ref> ==President== The [[President of the United States|President]] of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries is Ronnie Bowie, a senior partner with Hymans Robertson and a Fellow of the Faculty of Actuaries since 1980. ==Research and member support== Actuaries work in a number of different practice areas: enterprise risk management, finance and investment, general insurance, health and care, life insurance and pensions. Each of these areas is supported by an executive committee which oversees the development of knowledge and research within its own area, provides members with CPD opportunities and takes forward a programme of practice-specific research. The committees also foster a sense of community among actuaries practising in their particular field of expertise.<ref name="Practice areas">[http://www.actuaries.org.uk/practice-areas/pages/practice-areas Acuarial Profession].</ref> *[[Enterprise risk management]] - helping companies understand and manage risk in line with their business objectives *[[Finance and investment]] - for actuaries working in banking, corporate finance and investment *[[General insurance]] - rating products, advising on reserves and capital requirements, and similar general insurance activity *[[Health Care|Health and care]] - a growing area in both the private and public sectors as health provision models evolve to meet changing needs *[[Life insurance]] - a traditional area for actuaries, with the roles evolving as life insurance itself evolves *[[Pension]]s - actuaries play a key role in advising companies on all manner of pension schemes and structures. ==Education and regulation== The Institute and Faculty of Actuaries sets examinations, continuing professional development, professional codes and disciplinary standards. The [[Financial Reporting Council]] (FRC) assumed responsibility for oversight of the actuarial profession and the independent setting of actuarial technical standards with effect from May 2006.<ref name="Regulation">[http://www.actuaries.org.uk/regulation/pages/regulation Actuarial Profession].</ref> Fully qualified actuaries are Fellows and may bear the designations FIA or FFA while Associates bear the designations AIA or FIA.
