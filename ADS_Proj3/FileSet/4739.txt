It is based on [[wavelet]] theory and has become a standard for the exchange and storage of fingerprint images. WSQ was developed by the [[FBI]], the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST). This compression method is preferred over standard compression algorithms like [[JPEG]] because at the same compression ratios WSQ doesn't present the "blocking artifacts" and loss of fine-scale features that are not acceptable for identification in financial environments and criminal justice. ==External links== * [http://fingerprint.nist.gov/wsq/ WSQ Fingerprint Image Compression Encoder/Decoder Certification Guidelines] * http://www.c3.lanl.gov/~brislawn/index.html * http://www.wavelet.org/ [[Category:Graphics file formats]] [[Category:Lossy compression algorithms]] [[Category:Fingerprints]]</text> </page> <page> <id>39866</id> <title>Wavelet modulation</title> <text>{{Unreferenced stub|auto=yes|date=December 2009}} {{Cleanup|date=June 2007}} {{Modulation techniques}} '''Wavelet modulation''', also known as '''fractal modulation''', is a [[modulation]] technique that makes use of [[Wavelet|wavelet transformations]] to represent the data being transmitted. One of the objectives of this type of modulation is to send data at multiple rates over a [[channel (communications)|channel]] that is unknown. If the channel is not clear for one specific [[bit rate]], meaning that the signal will not be received, the signal can be sent at a different bit rate where the [[signal to noise ratio]] is higher.

In the DWT, each level is calculated by passing only the previous approximation coefficients (cA<sub>j</sub>) through low and high pass filters. However in the WPD, both the detail (cH<sub>j</sub>, cV<sub>j</sub>, cD<sub>j</sub>) and approximation coefficients are decomposed. [[Image:Wavelets - WPD.png|frame|none|Wavelet Packet decomposition over 3 levels]] For n levels of decomposition the WPD produces 2<sup>n</sup> different sets of coefficients (or nodes) as opposed to (3n + 1) sets for the DWT. However, due to the [[downsampling]] process the overall number of coefficients is still the same and there is no redundancy. From the point of view of compression, the standard wavelet transform may not produce the best result, since it is limited to wavelet bases that increase by a power of two towards the low frequencies. It could be that another combination of bases produce a more desirable representation for a particular signal. The best basis algorithm by Coifman and Wickerhauser<ref name=coifman1992>Coifman RR & Wickerhauser MV, 1992.

The implementation part of wavelet packets can be found in MATLAB wavelet toolbox in this [http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/toolbox/wavelet/index.html?/access/helpdesk/help/toolbox/wavelet/ch05_use.html link].
