of this hypergraph will be safe. Such a policy need not be two-phase and these policies can be classified according to the connectivity of the above mentioned hypergraph, 2PL policies being only one particular instance of these.<ref>Mihalis Yannakakis, A Theory of Safe Locking Policies in Database Systems, Journal of the ACM (JACM), v.29 n.3, p.718-740, July 1982.</ref> Yannakakis went on to show that for the natural class of safe locking policies (L-policies), freedom from deadlocks is determined solely on the order in which entities are accessed by transactions, and from this derived simple conditions that would guarantee freedom from deadlocks for an L-policy.<ref>Mihalis Yannakakis, Freedom from deadlocks of safe locking policies, SIAM J. on Computing 11 (1982), 391-408.</ref> He has also contributed to the area of computer aided verification and testing, where he laid the rigorous algorithmic and complexity-theoretic foundations of the field. Some of his contributions include the designing of memory efficient algorithms for the verification of temporal properties of finite-state programs,<ref>C. Courcoubetis , M. Vardi , P. Wolper , M. Yannakakis, Memory-efficient algorithms for the verification of temporal properties, Formal Methods in System Design, v.1 n.2-3, p.275-288, Oct. 1992.</ref> determining the complexity of testing whether programs satisfy their specifications expressed in [[linear-time]] [[temporal logic]],<ref>Costas Courcoubetis , Mihalis Yannakakis, The complexity of probabilistic verification, Journal of the ACM (JACM), v.42 n.4, p.857-907, July 1995.</ref> and verifying that a model with timing constraints satisfies a given temporal property.<ref>R. Alur , A. Itai , R. P. Kurshan , M. Yannakakis, Timing verification by successive approximation, Information and Computation, v.118 n.1, p.142-157, April 1995.</ref> Along with Alex Groce and Doron Peled, he introduced Adaptive Model Checking, showing that when inconsistencies are present between a system and the corresponding model, the results of the verification can be used to improve the model.<ref>Groce, A., Peled, D., and Yannakakis, M. 2002. Adaptive Model Checking. In Proceedings of the 8th international Conference on Tools and Algorithms For the Construction and Analysis of Systems (April 08 - 12, 2002). J. Katoen and P. Stevens, Eds. Lecture Notes In Computer Science, vol. 2280. Springer-Verlag, London, 357-370.</ref> He has also contributed to research on [[Message Sequence Chart]]s(MSC), where it was shown that weak [[realizability]] is undecidable for bounded MSC-graphs and that safe-realizability is in [[EXPSPACE]], along with other interesting results related to the verification of MSC-graphs.<ref>Rajeev Alur , Kousha Etessami , Mihalis Yannakakis, Realizability and verification of MSC graphs, Theoretical Computer Science, v.331 n.1, p.97-114, 15 February 2005.</ref> ==Awards== Yannakakis was awarded the seventh [[Knuth prize]] for the significance, impact and astonishing breadth of his contributions to theoretical computer science.<ref name="Knuth" /> He has also been awarded the Bell Labs Distinguished Member of Technical Staff Award and the Bell Labs President’s Gold Award, in 1985 and in 2000 respectively.
