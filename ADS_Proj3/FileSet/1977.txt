Contrary to popular stereotypes, only a small proportion, about 6% in Toronto, of the homeless population suffers from schizophrenia.<ref name="Frankish, C. 2005"/> Much more common are [[Affective spectrum|affective disorders]], self-reported by 20-40% of Toronto's homeless.<ref name="Frankish, C. 2005"/> According to Toronto's Street Health Report in 2007, one in ten homeless people reports attempted suicide in the past year.<ref>The Street Health Report 2007: Highlights and Action Plan. Toronto. [www.streethealth.ca]</ref> Homelessness is actually a chronic problem for only a small minority of people, the vast majority of individuals are "one-time only" shelter users or experience episodic homelessness. However, the distinctly different subgroup of individuals who are "chronically homeless" consume about half of shelter beds and available resources at any given time.<ref name="chumirethicsfoundation.ca"/> Many of "the homeless" who make use of homeless shelters are also employed.<ref>Housing Works: A Special Report 2007. Giving voice to the crisis [www.endhomelessnessottawa.ca]</ref> Individuals and families are simply priced out of private housing markets. In 2000, about 22% or 2.5 million Canadian households fell below the minimum amount required to afford a basic home, gauged at $25, 920. Five years later, this number rose to 26% or 3.2 million households.<ref>Shapcott, M. (2008).

Another common misunderstanding surrounds the homeless who prefer not to use the shelter system. In addition to rules and regulations, shelter users must accept crowded shelter conditions, which carry a high likelihood of TB exposure in inadequately ventilated room, along with risks of bedbugs, scabies, and lice infestations.<ref name="Frankish, C. 2005"/> ==History== While in Canada there has always been a certain portion of the population that was very poor, it is not until recently, after the 1980s, that "homeless" has come to mean the "unhoused" versus those simply living in poor quality housing.<ref name="cprn.org"/> Previously, the "homeless" was a general term applied mostly to transient men with no family ties, such as the migrant workers who travelled by [[freight hopping]] during the Great Depression.<ref name="cprn.org"/> Homelessness remained a minor concern as extremely cheap accommodation was available in '[[skid row]]' rooming houses or flophouses located in the poorest parts of most major cities. Even the most destitute could find some form of housing, even if its quality was abysmal. At the end of the Second World War in 1946, the federal government created the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) to make mortgages and home ownership more accessible to people and organizations.<ref name="chumirethicsfoundation.ca"/> The surplus generated by the CMHC was used in the 1980s to fund non-profit, Aboriginal, and rent supplement housing. However, following changes to Canada's National Housing Act housing act in 1996 to give the CMHC "more flexibility", it was able to directly fund social housing and its role in supporting new and existing affordable housing diminished.<ref name="United Nations 2009">United Nations (2009).

Despite Canada's economy this trend continued, and perhaps even accelerated in the 1990s. In [[Toronto]], for instance, admissions to homeless shelters increase by 75% between 1988 and 1998<ref>[http://www.toronto.ca/homelessness/index.htm 2000 Report Card on Homelessness, City of Toronto]</ref> After 1993 the national affordable housing program initiated in 1973 was cut and Canada's focus in addressing homelessness in the 1990s was to create more homeless shelters and emergency services<ref name="chumirethicsfoundation.ca"/> A decade later, in 2003, the federal government resumed spending on housing investment at $2.03 billion, a 25% decline from 1993 levels of $1.98 billion when adjusted for inflation.<ref>Laird, Gordon (2007).

People become homeless by many different paths how ever the most common reason are "inability to pay rent (53%) conflict or abuse (26%)alchol or drug use problems(8%)(http://www.endhomelessnessottawa.ca/homeless-to-home/homeless-to-home.cfm), other factors can include mental disorders, foster care exits, exiting from jail or hospitalization, immigration, rising housing costs and decreased rent controls, federal and provincial downloading of housing programs, and low social assistance rates.<ref name="cprn.org"/> While the causes are complex, the solutions to homelessness may be simple: "Homelessness may not be only a housing problem, but it is always a housing problem; housing is necessary, although sometimes not sufficient, to solve the problem of homelessness."<ref>Cushing N.
