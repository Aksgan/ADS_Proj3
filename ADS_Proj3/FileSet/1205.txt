Controversially, the original name for the DirectX project was the "Manhattan Project", a reference to the [[Manhattan Project|US nuclear weapons initiative]]. [[Alex St. John]], creator of the original Microsoft DirectX specification, claims that the connotation with the ultimate outcome of the Manhattan Project (the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|nuclear bombing of Japan]]) is intentional, and that DirectX and its sister project, the [[Xbox]] (which shares a similar logo), are meant to displace Japanese videogame makers from their dominance of the industry.<ref name="stjohn">{{cite web | url=http://www.shacknews.com/featuredarticle.x?id=283&page=2 | title=Alex St John Interview, page 2 | author=David Craddock | work=Shack News | month=March | year=2007 | accessdate=2008-06-03}}</ref> However, this meaning is publicly denied by Microsoft, which instead claims that it is merely artistic design.<ref name="stjohn"/> <center><gallery perrow="3"> Image:DirectX 1 logo.png|DirectX 1.0â€“6.1a Image:Directx9.png|DirectX 7.0-11.0 <!-- Deleted image removed: Image:DirectX 10 Microsoft Logo.jpg|DirectX 10.0 {{deletable image-caption|1={{subst:#time:l, j F Y| + 7 days}}}} --> </gallery></center> ==Components== The components of DirectX are *''' *[[DirectDraw]]: for drawing 2D Graphics ([[raster graphics]]). Now deprecated (in favor of [[Direct2D]]), though still in use by a number of games and as a video renderer in media applications. *[[Microsoft Direct3D|Direct3D]] (D3D): for drawing [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]]. *[[DXGI]]: for enumerating adapters and monitors and managing swap chains for Direct3D 10 and up. *[[Direct2D]] for 2D Graphics *[[DirectWrite]] for Fonts *[[DirectCompute]] for [[GPU]] Computing *[[DirectInput]]: for interfacing with input devices including [[computer keyboard|keyboards]], [[computer mouse|mice]], [[joystick]]s, or other [[game controller]]s. Deprecated after version 8 in favor of [[XInput]] for [[Xbox 360]] controllers or standard [[WM INPUT]] window message processing for keyboard and mouse input. *[[DirectPlay]]: for communication over a local-area or wide-area network. Deprecated after version 8. *[[DirectSound]]: for the playback and recording of waveform sounds. **[[DirectSound3D]] (DS3D): for the playback of [[3D audio effect|3D sounds]]. *[[DirectMusic]]: for playback of soundtracks authored in [[DirectMusic|DirectMusic Producer]]. *[[DirectX Media]]: comprising DirectAnimation for 2D/3D<ref>[http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~RB6K-IID/space.html 3D Animation of SPACE FIGHTER by DIRECT ANIMATION]</ref> web animation, [[DirectShow]] for multimedia playback and [[streaming media]], DirectX Transform for web interactivity, and Direct3D Retained Mode for higher level 3D graphics. DirectShow contains [[DirectX plugin]]s for [[audio signal processing]] and [[DXVA|DirectX Video Acceleration]] for accelerated video playback. *DirectX Diagnostics (DxDiag): a tool for diagnosing and generating reports on components related to DirectX, such as audio, video, and input drivers. *[[DirectX Media Objects]]: support for streaming objects such as encoders, decoders, and effects. *DirectSetup: for the installation of DirectX components, and the detection of the current DirectX version. DirectX functionality is provided in the form of [[Component Object Model|COM]]-style objects and interfaces. Additionally, while not DirectX components themselves, [[Managed code|managed]] objects have been built on top of some parts of DirectX, such as Managed Direct3D<ref>[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc164112.aspx Introducing the New Managed Direct3D Graphics API in the .NET Framework]</ref> and the XNA graphics library<ref>[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.xna.framework.graphics.aspx Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics namespace]</ref> on top of Direct3D 9. ===DirectX 10=== {{See also|Direct3D#Direct3D 10|Direct3D#Direct3D and Vista|List of games with DirectX 10 support|l1=Direct3D 10|l2=Direct3D and Vista}} [[File:DirectX10 logo.png|DirectX 10 Logo|thumb]] A major update to DirectX API, DirectX 10 ships with and is only available with [[Windows Vista]] and later; previous versions of Windows such as Windows XP are not able to officially run DirectX 10-exclusive applications. Rather, programs that are run on a Windows XP system with DirectX 10 simply resort to using the code from DirectX 9.0c, the latest version for Windows XP computers.<ref>[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb219721.aspx#Will_DirectX_10_be_available_for_Windows_XP DirectX Frequently Asked Questions]</ref> There are unofficial ports of DirectX 10 to XP.<ref>[http://www.techmixer.com/download-directx-10-for-windows-xp/ Download DirectX 10 for Windows XP] TechMixer</ref> [[Features new to Windows Vista#DirectX|Changes for DirectX 10]] were extensive. Many former parts of DirectX API were deprecated in the latest DirectX SDK and will be preserved for compatibility only: [[DirectInput]] was deprecated in favor of [[XInput]], [[DirectSound]] was deprecated in favor of the [[Cross-platform Audio Creation Tool]] system (XACT) and lost support for hardware accelerated audio, since [[Technical features new to Windows Vista#Audio|Vista audio stack]] renders sound in software on the CPU. The DirectPlay DPLAY.DLL was also removed and was replaced with dplayx.dll; games that rely on this DLL must duplicate it and rename it to dplay.dll. In order to achieve backwards compatibility, DirectX in Windows Vista contains several versions of Direct3D:<ref>{{cite web | url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee417756.aspx | title=Graphics APIs in Windows | author=Chuck Walbourn | month=August | year=2009 | work=MSDN | accessdate=2009-10-03}}</ref> *'''Direct3D 9''': emulates Direct3D 9 behavior as it was on Windows XP. Details and advantages of Vista's [[Windows Display Driver Model]] are hidden from the application if WDDM drivers are installed. This is the only API available if there are only XP graphic drivers (XDDM) installed, after an upgrade to Vista for example. *'''Direct3D 9Ex''' (known internally during Windows Vista development as 9.0L or 9.L): allows full access to the new capabilities of WDDM (if WDDM drivers are installed) while maintaining compatibility for existing Direct3D applications. The [[Windows Aero]] user interface relies on D3D 9Ex. *'''Direct3D 10''': Designed around the new driver model in Windows Vista and featuring a number of improvements to rendering capabilities and flexibility, including [[High Level Shader Language|Shader Model 4]]. '''Direct3D 10.1''' is an incremental update of Direct3D 10.0 which is shipped with, and requires, [[Windows Vista Service Pack 1]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,2177205,00.asp|title=Microsoft Unleashes First Service Pack for Vista|date=2007-08-29|accessdate=2007-08-29|publisher=PC Magazine}}</ref> This release mainly sets a few more image quality standards for graphics vendors, while giving developers more control over image quality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,2168429,00.asp?kc=ETRSS02129TX1K0000532|title=Microsoft Presents DirectX 10.1 Details at SIGGRAPH|date=2007-08-07|accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref> It also adds support for parallel cube mapping and requires that the video card supports Shader Model 4.1 or higher and 32-bit floating-point operations.
