past still continues. “Braintech” is arising and will enhance humans even more. It is suggested that humans knowing that their origins lie in their brains, rather than ancient [[myth]], will gain Brain Rights and enter a new Era -- that of the Brain. ==Concepts== The book introduces and argues for novel ideas in [[paleoanthropology|human evolution]], [[neuroscience]], [[social neuroscience]] and the [[humanities]]. === Human evolution === ====Gifted environments==== These are the [[learning]] environments humans create.<ref>''Up from Dragons'', pp. 77, 217-223</ref> Components of a gifted environment include “a rich variety of representations”,<ref>''Up from Dragons'', p. 217</ref> a “stimulating learning environment”,<ref>''Up from Dragons'', p. 219</ref> and “’empowering environments’—ones which foster specific paths of development, an opportunity sometimes limited to brief windows of developmental time”<ref name="Greenberg"> Greenberg N. (2003) [http://www.human-nature.com/nibbs/03/skoyles.pdf Up from dragons: Book Review]. Human Nature Review, 3, 142-148 </ref> It is proposed that such gifted environments are created by adult prefrontal cortex. The potential to create gifted environments predates humans and exists in chimpanzees. But they are limited because as adults chimpanzees lack time, cooperate only weakly and are under constant stress. It was the highly cooperative sociability of humans that allowed gifted environments to arise that could fully support cognitive development.<ref>''Up from Dragons'', p. 220</ref> ====Human change bootstrapping problem==== [[Bootstrapping]] concerns the paradox that the best way for something to occur is for it to already to be established. This problem has been identified in [[computer science|computer]] and [[cognitive science]] as an important obstacle: computers need to [[Booting#Boot_loader|load programs]] to start but this is best done when they have already loaded the program for doing this; [[Reading_education|reading]] is easier to acquire once a person can already read.<ref>Skoyles, JR. (1988) Training the brain using neural-network models. [[Nature_(journal)|Nature]] 333, 401. {{PMID|3374581}} </ref> [[Child_development#Cognitive.2FIntellectual_development|Cognitive development]] can be interpreted as the process by which cognitive systems sidestep and work around bootstrapping problems that would otherwise obstruct cognitive growth. The bootstrapping problem is proposed to explain why human cultural and technological developments often take so long to historically develop and then accelerate: the best circumstances for such innovations to flourish often arise only when they already exist.<ref>''Up from Dragons'', pp. 258-265</ref> ====Human ticket==== All [[animals|animal species]] except humans live in much the same biological manner in which they evolved. Humans in contrast have journeyed away from being simple hunter-gatherers to becoming citizens of hi-tech nation states. Biologically this is odd since modern people still basically have the same genes as their early hunter-gatherers ancestors. This raises the question of what had evolved, the ''ticket'', in those early humans that gave them to the potential to change later on so radically.<ref>''Up from Dragons'', pp. 23-24, 70</ref> ====NP + PC Formula==== :The evolution of human intelligence is expressed in a Neural Plasticity + Prefrontal Cortex formula that is progressively elaborated: ::NP + PC + ape mind = human mind<ref>''Up from Dragons'', p. 79</ref> ::NP + PC + fission-fusion ape social skills = human social symbols<ref>''Up from Dragons'', p. 203</ref> ::NP + PC + ape sensory and motor skills = human nonsocial symbols<ref>''Up from Dragons'', p. 203</ref> ::NP + PC + FF ape skills + symbols + 10<sup>9</sup> hours = contemporary mind<ref>''Up from Dragons'', p. 265</ref> ::NP + PC + mindware + braintech = future mind<ref>''Up from Dragons'', p. 279</ref> === Neuroscience === ====Cognitive stand-ins==== Symbols adapt already evolved functions to create novel ones by replacing their evolved inputs and outputs with nonevolved representations. [[reading (process)|Reading]] and [[writing]] are such new functions that rewire the functions of [[visual cortex|visual]], [[Broca's area|speech]] and other cortical areas by [[Letter_(alphabet)|letters]] and [[logograms|logogram]] stand-ins.<ref>''Up from Dragons'', pp. 191-206, 247-249</ref> ====Cortical catalyst==== [[Catalysis|Chemical catalysts]] work by creating [[chemical bonds]] by bringing existing substances into [[chemical reaction|reaction]] using intermediaries, and by temporal and spatial conjunction. The prefrontal cortex works similarly upon [[information processing]] happening elsewhere in the brain through creating [[working memory]] space. This space allows novel intermediary forms of association to be created and held together between different information processing systems in the brain. This process is essential to the formation of symbols and symbol based cognition.<ref>''Up from Dragons'', pp. 73-77, 200-203, 265</ref> ====Free cortex==== Due to brain [[Cranial_capacity|enlargement]] in humans, most of the human [[cerebral cortex]] lacks tightly evolved functions and so is open to acquire nonevolved skills. Even highly evolved cortical areas such as the [[primary visual cortex|primary visual]] and [[primary auditory cortex|auditory cortices]] can to a surprising degree take on new functions. [[Semantics]] can develop in the visual cortex of those born [[Blindness|blind]]<ref>Röder B, Stock O, Bien S, Neville H, Rösler F. (2002) Speech processing activates visual cortex in congenitally blind humans. Eur J Neurosci. 16:930-6.{{PMID|12372029}}</ref>, and [[Visual perception|vision]] can develop in the auditory cortex in experimental animals when [[retinal]] input is redirected into it.<ref>von Melchner L, Pallas SL, Sur M. (2000) Visual behaviour mediated by retinal projections directed to the auditory pathway. Nature. 404(6780):871-6.{{PMID|10786793}}</ref> The [[Cerebral_cortex#Association_areas|association areas of the cerebral cortex]] lack the input constraints of primary areas. As a result they are even more open to acquire novel cognitive capabilities.<ref>''Up from Dragons'', p. 77</ref> ====Memory headers==== [[John Morton (scientist)|John Morton]] has proposed that memories are organized by headed records.<ref> Morton J, Hammersley RH, Bekerian DA. (1985) Headed records: a model for memory and its failures. Cognition. 1985 Jun;20(1):1-23. {{PMID|4017518}}</ref> The function of the hippocampus is suggested to be providing such headers for memory. They also underlie the human capacity to experience in spite of superficial changes the continuity of self, other and place.<ref>''Up from Dragons'', pp. 143-153</ref> ====Pain as benevolent dictator==== [[Pain]] is argued to be a protective attentive envelope (see below) that temporary acts to protect injured or easily injured parts of the body from actions controlled by the brain.<ref>''Up from Dragons'', p. 115</ref> ====Protective attentive envelopes==== Aircraft have [[flight envelope protection]] systems that stop pilots acting in a manner that might harm the aircraft but which allow them to make quick but safe actions. The [[anterior cingulate cortex]] is argued to act as a “hidden observer” over what we do “attention-to-action” and it provides a similar function
