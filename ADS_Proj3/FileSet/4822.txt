that Shared Folder are duplicated and the effective storage capacity is halved. However, in situations where a user may not want data duplicated (e.g. TV shows that have been archived to a Windows Home Server from a system running [[Windows Media Center]]), Drive Extender provides the capability to not duplicate such files if the server is short on capacity or manually mark a complete content store as not for duplication. Additional information can be found on the ''[http://www.microsoft.com/DownLoads/details.aspx?familyid=40C6C9CC-B85F-45FE-8C5C-F103C894A5E2&displaylang=en Windows Home Server Technical Brief for Drive Extender]''. A known limitation of Drive Extender is that it in some cases changes date/timestamp of directories and files when data is moved around between disks. According to Microsoft this is currently expected behaviour. This causes unexpected behaviour when using clients that sort media based on date. Examples are [[Xbmc]], [[MediaPortal]], [[Squeezebox Server]]. The aforementioned programs will work fine with WHS; however, files may appear out of order due to this caveat. '''Drive Extender Cancellation''' On 11/23/2010, Microsoft announced that Drive Extender would be removed from [[Windows Home Server V2]].<ref>http://windowsteamblog.com/windows/b/windowshomeserver/archive/2010/11/23/windows-home-server-code-name-vail-update.aspx</ref> This announcement has led to public outcry in the announcement's comments section. Criticism of Drive Extender's removal is mainly related to it being seen as a core feature of Windows Home Server and a key reason for adoption. As a replacement for Drive Extender, Microsoft states that OEMs will use RAID on their Windows Home Server products. ===Computer Backup and Restore=== '''Windows Home Server Computer Backup''' automatically backs up all of the computers in a home to the server using an image-based system that ensures point-in-time-based restoration of either entire PCs or specific files and folders.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://blogs.technet.com/homeserver/archive/2007/02/08/home-computer-backup.aspx | title=Home Computer Backup | date=2007-02-08 | work=Windows Home Server Team Blog | accessdate=2007-04-28}}</ref> Complete computer restores are initiated through a restore [[boot disk|bootable CD]], file based restores are initiated through the WHS client software which allows the users to open a backup and "drag and drop" files from it. This technology uses [[Volume Shadow Copy Service|Volume Shadow Services (VSS)]] technology on the client computer to take an image based backup of a running computer. Because the backup operates on data at the [[Cluster (file system)|cluster]] level, [[Single-instance storage|single instancing]] can be performed to minimize the amount of data that travels over the network and that will ultimately be stored on the home server. This single instancing gives the server the ability to store only one instance of data, no matter if the data originated from another computer, another file, or even data within the same file. Computer backup images are not duplicated on the server, so if a server hard drive fails, backups could be lost. The "Server Backup" feature added in Power Pack 1 does not include duplication of backup images. === Remote File Access === [[Image:WindowsHomeServer (Web Interface, File UI).png|thumb|Web Interface showing the shared files UI]] The system also offers an [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] secured [[web browser]] based interface over the [[Internet]] to the shared file stores.<ref name="privacyStatement">{{cite web | url=http://connect.microsoft.com/WindowsHomeServer/content/content.aspx?ContentID=4318 | title=Microsoft Windows Home Server CTP Privacy Statement | date=January 2007 | work=Microsoft Connect | accessdate=2007-04-28}} </ref> The release version offers access to the web interface via a free [[Windows Live]]-provided [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]], which uses [[Dynamic DNS]].

The web interface also supports embedding the Remote Desktop [[ActiveX]] control, to provide remote access to home computers from within the web interface directly. Remote sessions can also connect to the Home Server console to configure the server over the internet.<ref name="tbrief"/> === Add-Ins === Windows Home Server allows for developers to publish community and commercial add-ins designed to enhance the Windows Home Server with added functionality. As of January 2010, nearly 100 of these add-ins have been developed for WHS, including applications for antivirus & security, backups, disk management, automation, media, network/power management, remote access, BitTorrent and more. The Windows Home Server SDK (Software Development Kit) provides developers with a set of APIs and tools to use when developing for and extending Windows Home Server. ==Compatibility== Windows Home Server features integration with [[Windows XP]] (SP2 or newer), [[Windows Vista]], and [[Windows 7]] (after the release of Power Pack 3) through a software installation, either from a client CD or via a network share.<ref name="whsconnector">{{cite web|url=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee378523%28WS.10%29.aspx|title=Installing Windows Home Server Connector Software Without the CD |date=2009-08-12|accessdate=2009-09-24}}</ref> Files stored on Windows Home Server are also available through a [[Server Message Block|Windows share]], opening compatibility to a wide variety of operating systems.
