Ford Modeling Agency, 800 Call-KC, [[Wilmar]]/[[InterLine Brands]] -- unsourced, unverifiable --> ==Derivative and related products== {{Cleanup|section|date=February 2009}} What most characterizes Pick is the design and features of the database and the associated retrieval language. The Pick database was licensed to roughly three dozen licensees between 1978 and 1984, some of which are included in this list. Application-compatible implementations evolved into derivatives and also inspired similar systems, of which a few examples are: ; Reality : The first implementation of the Pick database was on a Microdata platform and called [[Northgate Information Solutions|Reality]]. The first commercial release was in 1973. The Microdata implementations ran in [[firmware]], so each upgrade had to be accompanied by a new chip. Microdata itself was eventually bought by McDonnell-Douglas Information Systems. Pick and Microdata sued each other for the right to market the database, the final judgment being that they both had the right. In addition to the [[Northgate Information Solutions|Reality]] series of computers, Microdata sold the Sequel series which was a much larger class able to handle up to 200 simultaneous users. The modern version of this original Pick implementation is owned and distributed by [http://www.northgate-is.com/reality Northgate Information Solutions Reality]. ; Ultimate : The second implementation of the Pick database was developed in about 1978 by a [[New Jersey]] company called The Ultimate Corp, run by [[Ted Sabarese]]. Like the earlier Microdata port, this was a firmware implementation, with the Pick monitor in firmware and the OS in software, on a Honeywell Level 6 machine. Later versions of the Ultimate systems used separate processors installed in the cabinet. Processor boards were built from bit slice processors and microcoded with the Pick assembler instruction set. One version of this was installed in a Honeywell Level 6 machine and was known as a "7X" system as it was seven times faster than the firmware system. The Honeywell processor acted as in input/output processor to the 7X board. Two 7X boards installed in a chassis formed the "15X" machine. Another version used a DEC [[LSI-11]] for the IOP and a 7X board. Ultimate enjoyed moderate success during the 1980s, and even included an implementation running as a layer on top of DEC VAX systems, the 750, 780, 785 and later the [[MicroVAX]]. Ultimate also had versions of the Ultimate Operating System running on IBM 370 series systems (under VM and native) and also the 9370 series computers. Ultimate was renamed Allerion, Inc., before liquidation of its assets. Most assets were acquired by Bull, and consisted of mostly maintaining extant hardware. Bull had its own problems and in approximately 1994 the US maintenance operation was sold to Wang. ; Prime INFORMATION : Devcom, a Microdata reseller, wrote a Pick-style database system called INFORMATION in [[FORTRAN]] and assembler in 1979 to run on [[Prime Computer]] 50-series systems. It was then sold to [[Prime Computer]] and renamed Prime INFORMATION. It was subsequently sold to Vmark Software. INFO/BASIC, a variant of [[Dartmouth BASIC]], was used for database applications. ; PI/open : [[Prime Computer]] rewrote Prime INFORMATION in C for the [[Unix]]-based systems it was selling, calling it PI+. It was then ported to other Unix systems offered by other hardware vendors and renamed PI/open. ; ADDS : ([[Applied Digital Data Systems]]) This was the first implementation to be done in software only, so upgrades were accomplished by a tape load, rather than a new chip. The "Mentor" line was initially based on the Zilog Z-8000 chipset and this port set off a flurry of other "''software implementations''" across a wide array of processors with a large emphasis on the Motorola 68000. ; Fujitsu : Another software implementation, existing in the 1980s ; Pyramid : Another software implementation, existing in the 1980s ; General Automation "Zebra" : Another software implementation, existing in the 1980s ; Sequoia : Another software implementation, existing from 1987. Sequoia was most well-known for its fault-tolerant multi-processor model,<ref>[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=327010.327218]</ref><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=KaoKOvqhe2YC&lpg=PA217&dq=sequoia%20fault-tolerant&pg=PA217#v=onepage&q=sequoia%20fault-tolerant&f=false]</ref> which would automatically call tech support if a part was failing. The Enterprise Systems business unit (which was the unit that sold Pick), was sold to General Automation in 1996/1997.<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19052836.html]</ref> ; UniVerse : Another implementation of the system called [[Rocket U2|UniVerse]] was by VMark Software. This was the first one to incorporate the ability to emulate other implementations of the system, such as Microdata's [[Northgate Information Solutions|Reality]] Operating System, and Prime INFORMATION. Originally running on [[Unix]], it was later also made available for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. It now is owned by Rocket Software. (The systems developed by [[Prime Computer]] and VMark are now owned by [[Rocket Software]] and referred to as "U2".) ; UniData : Very similar to UniVerse. [[Rocket U2|UniData]] is a multivalued Pick-style database. It is also owned and distributed by Rocket Software. ; Revelation : In 1984, Cosmos released a Pick-style database called Revelation, later Advanced Revelation, for [[DOS]] on the [[IBM PC]]. Advanced Revelation is now owned by Revelation Technologies, which publishes a GUI-enabled version called [[OpenInsight]]. ; jBASE : [[jBASE]] was released in 1991 by a small company of the same name located in Hemel Hempstead. Written by former Microdata engineers, [[jBASE]] emulates all implementations of the system to some degree. [[jBASE]] is unique in that it compiles applications to native machine code form, rather than to an intermediate byte code. ; UniVision : [[UniVision OS|UniVision]] was a Pick-style database, designed as a replacement for the Mentor version but with extended features, released in 1992 by [http://www.edp.co.uk/solutions/sol_univision.html EDP] located in Sheffield. ; OpenQM : [[OpenQM]] is the only multi-value database product available both as a fully supported non-open source commercial product and in open source form under the General Public Licence ([http://gpl.openqm.com OpenQM Community Project]). It is available from [http://openqm.com/ OpenQM] and from [http://www.openqm.com02.net OpenQM in French]. ; Caché : In 2005 [[InterSystems]], the maker of [[Caché (software)|Caché]] database, announced support for a broad set of multi-value extensions in Caché. [http://www.intersystems.com/mv/index.html Caché for MultiValue]. ; Onware : ONware ends isolation of MultiValue applications. ONware equips these applications with the ability to use the common databases, such as
