Letters can be purchased over the phone, with a [[text message]] from a mobile phone, via [[PayPal]], credit card, traditional mail or with Gaia Cash through the Cash Shop, "La Victoire". Envelopes and letters can be later bought and sold through user trades or through Marketplace. ====Evolving Items==== Evolving Items, commonly abbreviated to '''EIs''', are items which change or '''evolve''' over time. Items begin with one set of item poses, but with each new evolution, a different set of poses become available instead. Additionally, with each subsequent evolution a re-release of the item becomes available at the Cash Shop as a "next generation" release. When the item has fully evolved all previous poses become available for the item. Times between evolutions are different for each EI, and can be anywhere between a few weeks to a few months. Recent additions of "Rapid Evolving Items" evolve twice a week. New evolution updates are noted in regular site announcements as "Evolving Item Reports" present by the NPC, Dr. Singh. EIs are available from the Cash Shop "La Victoire", and can be later sold through trading or in the Marketplace. EIs are removed from the Cash Shop sometime after their final evolution becomes available. ====Chance Items/Random Item Generators==== With Chance Items , commonly referred to as '''CIs''' (previously know as Random Item Generators, or '''RIGs'''), users play a chance mini-game and the item they are granted depends on their success with completing the game, when they decide to stop playing and collect an item, or their failure to complete the game. Games will vary depending on the RIG - some may require users to choose a "correct" response, while some are simply a choice between continuing the game or stopping and collecting an item. RIGs are available from the Cash Shop "La Victoire" and are eventually rotated out of the shop. ====Random Event Items==== Occasionally, random gift items can be found floating across web pages while browsing the site. Each random gift grants users a rare or uncommon clothing and accessory items that cannot be bought from any store. There are 6 different types of random items: *Brown Magical Giftbox: Contains uncommon items *Pink Magical Giftbox: Contains rare items *Blue Magical Giftbox: Contains items from both the Pink and Brown boxes, as well as a few items found only in the Blue Giftbox *Enchanted Wooden Trunk: Contains uncommon Gaia Housing items *Enchanted Golden Trunk: Contains rare Gaia Housing items *Fat Cat Alert: Contains various cat-related items, some which can be bought from normal NPC-run shops ==Other Site Features== ===Site-wide Events=== Gaia holds various special events throughout the year - some are yearly, regular holiday events, while some are and Gaia-specific events which may or may not be run yearly. In the past, these have included: April Fools, Halloween, Easter, Christmas, Valentine's Day, GaiaOnline's Site Anniversary, yearly Summer festivities, and the Gaian Prom. During the majority of events, users take part in site-wide mini-games and tasks, such as carol-singing during Christmas events by visiting NPC-owned stores to eventually collect commemorative Christmas items. The 2009 Halloween event saw the introduction of the Aquarium Overseer in his human form along with his nemesis, Sentinel. During the event, users were to ally themselves with either The Overseer or Sentinel, and perform certain tasks in order combat the opposing side. Events such as these can determine storyline outcomes. ===Guilds=== Users can form guilds, which are clubs specially devoted to certain topics. These include hangout guilds, role playing guilds and guilds for various discussion topics. In previous years, guilds were simply run using a thread in the Guilds forum, however Gaia later expanded on this, allowing users to create private forums for guilds. Joining a guild can depend on the guidelines set by a guild leader and their crew - some may require a payment to join, others are completely free, while some may be invitation-only. The guild leader and crew are also responsible for moderating threads within their guild. Guilds cost 20,000 gold to create, and additional sub-forums may be purchased. ===Gaia Houses=== Users are able to own their own Gaia House situated in Gaia Towns. Houses are available in 3 different styles: Round, Square, or Long. To purchase a house is free, however future changes to the style of the house costs 500 gold. Users are also able to relocate their home to a different Town postcode at a cost of 1000 gold. A range of decorative furniture items can be bought from the NPC-run store, "The Faktori", such as include floor and wall tiles, tables, chairs, lamps, among others. Rare housing items can be found in Enchanted Wooden Trunks and Enchanted Golden Trunks randomly found floating across site pages. ===Gaia Cars=== On June 18, 2007,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gaiaonline.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=28475605 |title = Gaia Online announcement of Gaia Rally release |date= 2007-06-18 |accessdate = 2007-08-25}}</ref> Gaia Online and [[Scion (automobile)|Scion]] announced a partnership that allowed users to create a virtual Scion with customizable wheels, decals, fog lights, tail lights, and spoilers.<ref name="autochannel">{{cite web|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2007/06/19/052375.html |title = Gaia Online and Scion Allow Teens to Pimp their Virtual Rides |date= 2007-06-19 |accessdate = 2007-08-25}}</ref><ref name="Control">[http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2007/07/marketers-grapple-with-giving-teens-more-control-online198.html "Marketers Grapple with Giving Teens More Control Online" - MediaShift]</ref> Other car choices available were the fictional Possum and Musculero.
