However, it is currently an [[interdisciplinary]] [[science]] that collaborates with other fields such as [[psychology]], [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[engineering]], [[computer science]], [[philosophy]], and [[medicine]]. The term neurobiology is usually used interchangeably with the term neuroscience, although the former refers specifically to the [[biology]] of the [[nervous system]], whereas the latter refers to the entire science of the nervous system. The scope of neuroscience has broadened to include different approaches used to study the [[molecular biology|molecular]], [[cellular neuroscience|cellular]], [[neural development|developmental]], [[neuroanatomy|structural]], [[neurophysiology|functional]], [[evolutionary neuroscience|evolutionary]], [[computational neuroscience|computational]], and [[neurological disorders|medical]] aspects of the nervous system. The techniques used by [[neuroscientist]]s have also expanded enormously, from molecular and cellular studies of individual [[neuron|nerve cells]] to [[brain mapping|imaging]] of sensory and motor tasks in the [[brain]]. Recent theoretical advances in neuroscience have also been aided by the study of [[neural network]]s. Given the increasing number of neuroscientists that study the nervous system, several prominent neuroscience organizations have been formed to provide a forum to all neuroscientists and educators. For example, the [[International Brain Research Organization]] was founded in 1960,<ref>{{cite web|year=2010|title=History of IBRO|work=International Brain Research Organization|url=http://www.ibro.info/Pub/Pub_Main_Display.asp?LC_Docs_ID=2343}}</ref> the [[European Brain and Behaviour Society]] in 1968,<ref>{{cite web|year=2009|title=About EBBS|work=European Brain and Behaviour Society|url=http://www.ebbs-science.org/cms/general/about-ebbs.html}}</ref> and the [[Society for Neuroscience]] in 1969.<ref>{{cite web|title=About SfN|work=Society for Neuroscience|url=http://www.sfn.org/index.aspx?pagename=about_sfn}}</ref> ==History== {{See also|History of neuroscience}} [[File:Gray739.png|right|thumb|250px|Illustration from ''[[Gray's Anatomy]]'' (1918) of a lateral view of the [[human brain]], featuring the [[hippocampus]] among other neuroanatomical features]] The study of the nervous system dates back to [[ancient Egypt]]. Evidence of [[trepanation]], the surgical practice of either drilling or scraping a hole into the skull with the aim of curing headaches or [[Mental illness|mental disorders]] or relieving cranial pressure, being performed on patients dates back to [[Neolithic]] times and has been found in various cultures throughout the world. Manuscripts dating back to 1700BC indicated that the [[Egyptians]] had some knowledge about symptoms of brain damage.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mohamed W|year=2008|title=The Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus: Neuroscience in Ancient Egypt|work=IBRO History of Neuroscience|url=http://www.ibro.info/Pub/Pub_Main_Display.asp?LC_Docs_ID=3199}}</ref> Early views on the function of the brain regarded it to be a "cranial stuffing" of sorts. In Egypt, from the late [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] onwards, the brain was regularly removed in preparation for [[Mummy|mummification]]. It was believed at the time that the [[heart]] was the seat of intelligence. According to [[Herodotus]], the first step of mummification is to "take a crooked piece of iron, and with it draw out the brain through the nostrils, thus getting rid of a portion, while the skull is cleared of the rest by rinsing with drugs."<ref>{{cite book|author=Herodotus|year=440BCE|title=The Histories: Book II (Euterpe)|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.mb.txt}}</ref> The view that the heart was the source of consciousness was not challenged until the time of [[Hippocrates]]. He believed that the brain was not only involved with sensation—since most specialized organs (e.g., eyes, ears, tongue) are located in the head near the brain—but was also the seat of intelligence. [[Plato]] too speculated that the brain was the seat of the rational part of the soul.<ref>{{cite book|author=Plato|year=360BCE|title=Timaeus|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/timaeus.1b.txt}}</ref> [[Aristotle]], however, believed that the heart was the center of intelligence and that the brain served to
