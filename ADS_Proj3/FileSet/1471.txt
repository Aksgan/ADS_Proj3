cat.]] A '''feral cat''' is a descendant of a domesticated [[cat]] that has returned to the wild. It is distinguished from a stray cat, which is a pet cat that has been lost or abandoned, while feral cats are born in the wild; however, the offspring of a stray cat can be considered feral if born in the wild.<ref name="Wild">{{cite web|url=http://www.banderasnews.com/0706/nb-saveacat.htm|title=Wild Things? An Introduction To Feral Cats|author=Holton, Louise|date=June 2007|publisher=Bandaras News|accessdate=21 November 2010}}</ref> In many parts of the world, feral cats are descendants of domestic cats that were left behind by travelers. Because cats are not native to all parts of the world, feral cats can cause harm to local environments by [[predation|preying]] on local species. This is especially true on [[island]]s where feral cats have sometimes had a substantial and deleterious effect on the local fauna. == Behavior of "feral" cats == === Feral versus stray === [[File:Feral cat.jpg|thumb|left|A feral cat showing typical aggressive behavior]] The term ''feral'' is sometimes used to refer to an animal that does not appear friendly when approached by humans, but the term can apply to any domesticated animal without human contact.<ref name="Wild"/> Hissing and growling are self-defense behaviors, which, over time, may change as the animal (whether "feral" or "stray") begins to trust humans that provide food, water, and care.<ref name="taming">{{cite web | url=http://www.feralcat.com/taming.html | title = Taming Feral Kittens | author = Feral Cat Coalition / Ray Savage |date=November 2009}}</ref><ref>http://cats.about.com/od/behaviortraining/qt/catbehavior101.htm</ref> Feral cats that are born and living outdoors, without any human contact or care, have been shown to be adoptable and can be tamed by humans.<ref name="taming"/><ref>http://www.petplace.com/cats/how-to-turn-a-stray-cat-into-a-pet/page1.aspx</ref> === Life span and survival === Because of the dependency on human influence, domestic animals (such as cats and dogs) cannot properly fend for themselves for any significant length of time.<ref name="feralcat.com">http://www.feralcat.com/</ref> Thus, the [[Life expectancy|average life span]] of a feral cat that survives beyond [[kitten]]hood is about two years for independent cats and five years for cats in a cat colony. In contrast, a cat that lives indoors under proper human care has a life expectancy of 15–22 years.<ref>http://www.petplace.com/cats/life-expectancy-in-cats/page1.aspx</ref> Almost all cats that are left to survive outdoors will succumb to starvation, thirst, disease, parasites or predation.<ref>http://www.havahart.com/advice/critter-library/feral-cat-control</ref> Another threat to the life of a feral cat is weather. Cats are sensitive to conditions of cold and heat.<ref name="vetinfo.com">{{cite web | url=http://www.vetinfo.com/heat-stroke-in-cats.html | title = Heat Stroke in Cats | author = VetInfo}}</ref> A cat’s normal body temperature is between 100.5 and 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit (38.2 and 39.2 Celsius). Cats do not sweat as humans do, and they regulate their body temperature through panting and licking their fur in hot weather.<ref name="vetinfo.com"/> Numerous cats living outdoors, whether feral or tame, die each year due to [[hyperthermia]] or [[hypothermia]]. ==History== During the [[Age of Discovery]], ships released rabbits onto islands to provide a future food source for other travelers. They eventually multiplied out of control and cats were introduced to keep their numbers, and that of mice and rats, down. The cats tended to favor local species as they were ecologically naive and easier to hunt. Their numbers too increased dramatically and soon they colonised many areas and were seen as pests too. Historical records date the arrival of feral cats in Australia at around 1824.<ref name="Abbot">Abbot, I. (2002) "Origin and spread of the cat, Felis catus, on mainland Australia, with a discussion of the magnitude of its early impact on native fauna" ''Wildlife Research'' '''29'''(1): 51-74 [http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/WR01011.htm abstract]</ref> Despite that, it has been suggested that feral cats have been present in [[Australia]] since before [[European ethnic groups|European]] settlement, and may have arrived with [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[shipwreck]]s in the 17th century, or even before that, arriving from present-day [[Indonesia]] with [[Macassan contact with Australia|Macassan]] fisherman and [[trepanging|trepang]]ers who frequented Australia's shores.<ref name=dc>Dickman, C.

In arid and semi-arid environments, they eat mostly [[introduced species|introduced]] [[European Rabbit|European rabbit]]s and [[House Mouse|house mice]]; in forests and urbanised areas, they eat mostly native [[marsupial]] prey (based on 22 studies summarised in Dickman 1996). In arid environments where rabbits do not occur, native rodents are taken. [[Birds]] and [[reptiles]] form a smaller part of the diet. Feral cats may be [[apex predator]]s in some local ecosystems. In others, they may be preyed on by [[Dog|feral dogs]], [[coyote]]s, [[wolf|wolves]], [[bear]]s, [[cougar]]s, [[bobcat]]s, [[lynx]], [[Fisher (animal)|fisher]]s, [[crocodilian]]s, [[snake]]s, and [[birds of prey]]. ==Effects on wildlife== [[File:Domestic cat eating bird on lawn-8.jpg|thumb|Feral cats can be effective hunters of small animals]] The impact of domestic cats on wildlife is a century old debate. In a 1916 report for the Massachusetts State Board of Agriculture titled ''The Domestic Cat: Bird Killer, Mouser and Destroyer of Wildlife'', noted [[ornithologist]] [[Edward Howe Forbush]] stated in the preface: <blockquote> Questions regarding the value or inutility of the domestic cat, and problems connected with limiting its more or less unwelcome outdoor activities, are causing much dissension. The discussion has reached an acute stage. Medical men, game protectors and bird lovers call on legislators to enact restrictive laws. Then ardent cat lovers rouse themselves for combat. In the excitement of partisanship many loose and ill-considered statements are made.<ref>Forbush, Edward Howe (1916).
