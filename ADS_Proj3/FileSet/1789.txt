of all possible worlds will contain all possibilities, with our finite experience of eternity giving no reason to dispute nature's perfection." Leibniz would on occasion give a speech for a specific principle, but more often took them for granted.<ref>For a precis of what Leibniz meant by these and other Principles, see Mercer (2001: 473–84). For a classic discussion of Sufficient Reason and Plenitude, see Lovejoy (1957).</ref> ===The monads=== Leibniz's best known contribution to [[metaphysics]] is his theory of [[Monad (Greek philosophy)|monads]], as exposited in ''[[Monadology|Monadologie]]''. Monads are to the metaphysical realm what [[atom]]s are to the physical/phenomenal.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} They can also be compared to the corpuscles of the Mechanical Philosophy of René Descartes and others. Monads are the ultimate elements of the [[universe]]. The monads are "substantial forms of being" with the following properties: they are eternal, indecomposable, individual, subject to their own laws, un-interacting, and each reflecting the entire universe in a [[pre-established harmony]] (a historically important example of [[panpsychism]]). Monads are centers of [[force]]; substance is force, while [[space]], [[matter]], and [[Motion (physics)|motion]] are merely phenomenal. The [[ontology|ontological]] essence of a monad is its irreducible simplicity. Unlike atoms, monads possess no material or spatial character. They also differ from atoms by their complete mutual independence, so that interactions among monads are only apparent. Instead, by virtue of the principle of pre-established harmony, each monad follows a preprogrammed set of "instructions" peculiar to itself, so that a monad "knows" what to do at each moment. (These "instructions" may be seen as analogs of the [[scientific law]]s governing [[subatomic particle]]s.) By virtue of these intrinsic instructions, each monad is like a little mirror of the universe. Monads need not be "small"; e.g., each human being constitutes a monad, in which case [[free will]] is problematic. [[God]], too, is a monad, and the [[existence of God]] can be inferred from the harmony prevailing among all other monads; God wills the pre-established harmony. Monads are purported to having gotten rid of the problematic: *Interaction between [[mind]] and matter arising in the system of [[Descartes]]; *Lack of [[Principle of individuation|individuation]] inherent to the system of [[Spinoza]], which represents individual creatures as merely accidental. ===Theodicy and optimism=== (Note that the word “optimism” here is used in the classic sense of optimal, not in the mood-related sense, as being positively hopeful) The ''[[Théodicée]]''<ref>Rutherford (1998) is a detailed scholarly study of Leibniz's [[theodicy]].</ref> tries to justify the apparent imperfections of the world by claiming that it is [[Best of all possible worlds|optimal among all possible worlds]]. It must be the best possible and most balanced world, because it was created by an all powerful and all knowing God, who would not choose to create an imperfect world if a better world could be known to him or possible to exist. In effect, apparent flaws that can be identified in this world must exist in every possible world, because otherwise God would have chosen to create the world that excluded those flaws. Leibniz asserted that the truths of theology (religion) and philosophy cannot contradict each other, since reason and faith are both "gifts of God" so that their conflict would imply God contending against himself. The ''Theodicy'' is Leibniz's attempt to reconcile his personal philosophical system with his interpretation of the tenets of Christianity.<ref>Magill, Frank (ed.). ''Masterpieces of World Philosophy.'' New York: Harper Collins (1990)</ref> This project was motivated in part by Leibniz's belief, shared by many conservative philosophers and theologians during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], in the rational and enlightened nature of the Christian religion, at least as this was defined in tendentious comparisons between Christian and non Western or "primitive" religious practices and beliefs. It was also shaped by Leibniz's belief in the perfectibility of human nature (if humanity relied on correct philosophy and religion as a guide), and by his belief that metaphysical necessity must have a rational or logical foundation, even if this metaphysical causality seemed inexplicable in terms of physical necessity (the natural laws identified by science). Because reason and faith must be entirely reconciled, any tenet of faith which could not be defended by reason must be rejected. Leibniz then approached one of the central criticisms of Christian theism:<ref>Magill, Frank (ed.). (1990)</ref> if God is all good, all wise and all powerful, how did evil come into the world? The answer (according to Leibniz) is that, while God is indeed unlimited in wisdom and power, his human creations, as creations, are limited both in their wisdom and in their will (power to act). This predisposes humans to false beliefs, wrong decisions and ineffective actions in the exercise of their free will. God does not arbitrarily inflict pain and suffering on humans; rather he permits both ''moral evil'' (sin) and ''physical evil'' (pain and suffering) as the necessary consequences of ''metaphysical evil'' (imperfection), as a means by which humans can identify and correct their erroneous decisions, and as a contrast to true good. Further, although human actions flow from prior causes that ultimately arise in God, and therefore are known as a metaphysical certainty to God, an individual's free will is exercised within natural laws, where choices are merely contingently necessary, to be decided in the event by a "wonderful spontaneity" that provides individuals an escape from rigorous predestination. The ''Theodicy'' was deemed illogical by the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]].<ref>Russell, Bertrand. A Critical Exposition of the Philosophy of Leibniz. London: George Allen & Unwin (1900).</ref> Russell points out that moral and physical evil must result from metaphysical evil (imperfection). But imperfection is merely finitude or limitation; if existence is good, as Leibniz maintains, then the mere existence of evil requires that evil also be good. In addition, Christian theology defines sin as not necessary but contingent, the result of free will. Russell maintains that Leibniz failed logically to show that metaphysical necessity (divine will) and human free will are not incompatible or contradictory. The mathematician [[Paul du Bois-Reymond]], in his "Leibnizian Thoughts in Modern Science", wrote that Leibniz thought of God as
