discovered to have a pair of hands (CP's) in his chest. During surgery to remove them, CP escapes, swipes a scapel and a goalie mask, regenerates his crud-body by consuming a Microsoft salesman, and hunts down Dust Puppy (who upon hearing the news attempts to flee to [[French Guiana]]). After an inconclusive fight CP detours into [[Starbucks|"Skybucks" Coffee]] and is kicked into a coffee grinder by DP - and is promptly drunk by Pitr ''again''. Still later CP is summoned by [[Bill Gates]] to assist in the Microsoft anti-trust trial; he latches onto Pitr's kidneys, regenerates again when the clumsy surgeon spills his coffee into Pitr, swipes yet another scapel and escapes. DP then explains to Greg (who apparently was away during the first two Crud Puppy appearances) that, in previous lives 2000 years ago, he and CP became adversaries when [[Darth Vader|"Lord Crud"]] was commander of the [[Death Star|Imperial Death Orb]], which was destroyed by DP and [[Tux]] by uploading [[Windows 95]]. CP, meanwhile, has stolen the body (sans head) of the previous Microsoft attorney and (as "Sid Crud") wins the case; he then resigns in favour of a position at [[AOL]] ("it's the new evil")... ===Cthulhu=== :''First Appearance: [http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20010329 March 29, 2001]'' [[Cthulhu]], the fabled tentacle-headed god, who likes to eat human heads.
