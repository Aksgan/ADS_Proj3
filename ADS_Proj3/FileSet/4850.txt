Although [[Seymour I. Rubinstein]] was the principal owner of the company, [[Rob Barnaby]] was the sole author of the early versions of the program; starting with WordStar 4.0, the program was built on new code written principally by Peter Mierau. WordStar was a text-based word processing program,<ref>Lisa Kleinholz, "[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1563/is_n10_v10/ai_12734985/ Making mail manageable and more: WordStar]". ''Home Office Computing'', Oct. 1992.</ref> meaning that it worked with files that were essentially text, with [[markup language]]-like formatting commands (such as the "dot commands"); this made the files relatively small. By contrast, most word processors today are code-based, and save their documents in much larger files.<ref>See, e.g., Allin Cottrell, "[http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/wp.html Word Processors: Stupid and Inefficient]"; accessed 2009.06.10.</ref> == History == <!--Very incomplete, but the best I could build out of the opinionated ramblings that were here--> WordStar was originally developed for [[CP/M]] in 1978.<ref name="wordstar.org">http://www.wordstar.org/wordstar/history/history.htm</ref> It was the most [[feature-rich]] and easy-to-use word processor available for this operating system, and became a de facto standard.<ref name="standard">[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/WordPerfect-Corporation-Company-History.html WordPerfect Corporation], By 1983, MicroPro International's WordStar was the leading word processing system.</ref><ref name="biggest">[http://www.dvorak.org/blog/whatever-happened-to-wordstar-2 John C.

Release 4, the final CP/M compatible version, was sold with 5¼" floppy disk as a default, and an 8" version as an option. [[File:WordStar 4 CPM.JPG|thumb|WordStar 4 for CP/M, released 1987]] The 3.0 version of WordStar for DOS was released in April 1982.<ref name="wordstar.org"/> The DOS version was very similar to the original, and although the IBM PC featured arrow keys and separate function keys, the traditional "WordStar diamond" and other Ctrl-key functions were retained, leading to rapid adoption by former CP/M users.{{citation needed|date=June 2009}} WordStar's ability to use a "non-document" mode to create text files without formatting made it popular among programmers for writing code. The first DOS version was a direct port of the CP/M version, and therefore only used 64k of RAM even though DOS supported up to [[640K#640 KB barrier|640k]]. Users quickly learned they could make this version of WordStar run dramatically faster by using the ability of DOS to create a "RAM disk" in memory, and copy the WordStar program files into it. WordStar would still access the "disk" repeatedly, but the far faster access of the RAM drive compared to a floppy disk yielded a substantial speed improvement. However, edited versions of a document were "Saved" only to this RAM disk, and had to be copied to physical magnetic media before rebooting. By the mid-1980s WordStar was the most popular DOS word processing software in the world.<ref>Will WordPerfect for Windows steal the crown? Computer Shopper, February 1, 1992, Daniel J. Rosenbaum [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-11726240.html Copy from HighBeam Research]</ref> But [[IBM]] dominated the "dedicated word processor" market with its "[[IBM DisplayWrite]]" application, which ran on machines dedicated to writing and editing documents. There were many [[dedicated word processor|dedicated word processing machines]] at the time, but IBM's main competition was [[Wang Laboratories]]. Such machines were expensive and were generally accessed through terminals connected to central mainframe or midrange computers. When IBM announced it was bringing to market a PC version called "DisplayWriter", MicroPro focused on creating a clone of it which they marketed as "WordStar 2000." Neither program was as successful as its developers had hoped, and the lack of attention MicroPro had paid to the original WordStar in the meantime, coupled with WordStar 2000's poor support for WordStar formats and keystrokes, had allowed competing products an opportunity to take over market share.{{citation needed|date=June 2009}} [[WordPerfect]], in particular, used the same key sequences as the popular Wang line of dedicated word processors, which made it popular with secretaries switching from those to PCs. MicroPro International restructured as WordStar International and rehired many of the WordStar programmers who had left the company during the WordStar 2000 diversion, and in October 1986 acquired the code for NewWord, a WordStar clone with extended capabilities, written principally by Peter Mierau at his company NewStar. WordStar used the NewWord codebase to produce upgraded versions, adding such long-desired features as an unerase and distinctive on-screen colorization for bold, italics, and other print effects. The first version built on the NewWord codebase was dubbed WordStar (or WordStar Professional 4.0) and it was released for DOS and CP/M operating systems. Later versions — 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, and 7.0 — were only released for DOS; the new releases rebuilt some of the lost market share. An internal struggle between the "old timer" developers of version 6.5 (aimed at Microsoft Word users), and the "young Turks" working on version 7.0 (aimed at WordPerfect
