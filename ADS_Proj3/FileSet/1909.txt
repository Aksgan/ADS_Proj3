Henry supposedly debated whether or not to give her a title and only on his deathbed did he admit to being her father. He gave her the title Comtesse de Montmorency. It is not known why he was so secretive about this one daughter. *By Filippa Duci: [[Diane de France|Diane, duchesse d'Angoulême]] (1538–1619). Some sources have stated that the child was the natural daughter of Henry's long-time mistress, [[Diane de Poitiers]].{{Whom?|date=April 2010}} This is probably not the case since it is on record that Henry had Filippa Duci watched closely throughout her pregnancy. She gave birth in a convent and it appears that she remained there for the rest of her life. At the age of fourteen, the younger Diane married Orazio Farnese, Duke of Castro, who died young in battle. Her second marriage was to François, duc de Montmorency. *By [[Lady Janet Stewart]] (1508–1563), herself an illegitimate daughter of [[James IV of Scotland]]: Henri de Valois (1551 – June 1586). He was legitimized and became governor of [[Provence]]. *By Nicole de Savigny: a son, Henri (1557–1621). He was given the title of comte de Saint-Rémy. One of his last descendants was Jeanne de Valois-Saint-Rémy, [[Comtesse de la Motte]], famous for her role in the [[Affair of the Diamond Necklace]]. ==Prophecy== {{Infobox French Royalty styles |name=King Henry II<br><small>Par la grâce de Dieu, Roi de France</small> |dipstyle=His [[Most Christian Majesty]] |offstyle=Your Most Christian Majesty |altstyle=Monsieur le Roi }} [[Nostradamus]], a French astrological writer known for his prophecies, is often said to have become famous when one of his [[quatrain]]s was construed as a prediction of the death of King Henry II: CI, Q 35 ''The young lion shall overcome the older one,''<br/> ''on the field of combat in single battle,''<br/> ''He shall pierce his eyes in a golden cage,''<br/> ''Two forces one, then he shall die a cruel death.'' But, in fact, the link was first proposed in print only in 1614,<ref>César Nostradamus, ''Histoire et Chronique de Provence'', Lyon, Simon Rigaud, 1614</ref> fifty-five years after the event and forty-eight after Nostradamus' death; thus it qualifies as a [[postdiction]], or ''vaticinium ex eventu''. The Italian astrologer [[Luca Gaurico]], a contemporary of Nostradamus, is also said to have predicted the king's death. ==Notes== {{Reflist}} ==References== {{commonscat-inline|Henry II of France}} * Arnold-Baker, Charles, ''The companion to British history'', Routledge, 1996. * Frumkin, M., ''The Origin of Patents'', Journal of the Patent Office Society, March 1945, Vol. XXVII, No. 3, 143. * Guy, John, ''My Heart is my Own'', London, Fourth Estate, 2004, ISBN 0–00–71930–8. * Nostradamus, César, ''Histoire et Chronique de Provence'', Lyon, Simon Rigaud, 1614 * Patrick, David, and Francis Hindes Groome, ''Chambers's biographical dictionary: the great of all times and nations'', J.B.
