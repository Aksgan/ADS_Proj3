the Archbishop of Armagh. The position remained so until the Reformation. There is archival evidence showing that public notaries, acting pursuant to papal and imperial authority, practised in England and in Ireland in the 13th century and it is reasonable to assume that notaries functioned here before that time. After the Reformation, persons appointed to the office of public notary either in Great Britain or Ireland received the faculty by royal authority and appointments under faculty from the Pope and the emperor ceased. In 1871, under the Matrimonial Causes and Marriage Law (Ireland) Amendment 1870, the jurisdiction previously exercised by the Archbishop of Armagh in the appointment of notaries was vested in and became exercisable by the Lord Chancellor of Ireland. In 1920, the power to appoint notaries public was transferred to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The position in Ireland changed once again in 1924 following the establishment of the Irish Free State. Under the Courts of Justice Act, 1924 the jurisdiction over notaries public was transferred to the Chief Justice of the Irish Free State. In 1961, under the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act of that year, and the power to appoint notaries public became exercisable by the Chief Justice. This remains the position in the Republic of Ireland, where notaries are appointed on Petition to the Supreme Court, after passing prescribed examinations. The governing body is the Faculty of Notaries Public in Ireland. In Northern Ireland, notaries public are appointed by the Lord Chief Justice. The vast majoirty of notaries in Ireland are also solicitors. A non-solicitor, who was successful in the examinations as set by the governing body, applied to the Chief Justice to be appointed a notary public. The Chief Justice heard the adjourned application on 3 March 2009 and reserved his judgement on that date. As at 6 April 2010 this judgement has not been delivered. ===New Zealand=== Unless excluded under dominion or colonial law, the [[Master of the Faculties]] formerly had authority to appoint notaries public in a [[dominion]] or colony. The admission of notaries in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] was governed specifically by the Public Notaries Act 1833 (UK). The provisions of the Public Notaries Act 1801-43 requiring a notary to be a [[solicitor]] did not apply overseas, nor need a notary have a practicing certificate as a solicitor, or from the [[Court of Faculties]]. The usual procedure followed is that the applicant lodges with the Court of Faculties a [[memorial]] counter-signed by local merchants, shipping companies, bankers and other persons of substance, which show the local need of a notary and the fitness of the applicant. They also lodge their certificate of admission as a solicitor. A fee accompanies the application. The applicant, with the support of two other notaries public, who vouch that the applicant is well skilled in the affairs of notarial concern, petitions the Master of the Faculties. The chief consideration for the approval of an application is whether there is sufficient need in the district, regarding the convenience of bankers, ship-owners and merchants. The local society of notaries must be satisfied that a need exists for an additional notary in the area served by the applicant. Priority is given, as a matter of practice, to an applicant within the same firm, as a replacement in the case of the death of a notary, or where a practicing notary is reducing his or her workload because of age or infirmity. The Master of the Faculties continues to appoint notaries overseas in the exercise of the general authorities granted by s 3 of the [[Ecclesiastical Licenses Act 1533]] (Eng). In these cases he is guided by local considerations of public convenience. ===Sri Lanka=== Until 1973 a separate group of lawyers existed to carry out litigation known as [[Proctor]]s. A proctor was not a practitioner in a [[court| court of law]]. These were also known as Notaries. However since 1973 the legal practitioners were classed solely as [[Attorney at law (Sri Lanka)|Attorneys at law]] combining the former [[advocate]]s and proctors. This new position of [[Lawyer|attorney at law]] brought with it automatic appointment as a notary public when the practitioner took oaths as an attorney at law, thus becoming legally qualified for litigation. ===United Kingdom=== ====England and Wales==== After the passage of the 1533 Act, which was a direct result of the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] in [[England]], all notary appointments were issued directly through the [[Court of Faculties]]. The Court of Faculties is attached to the office of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. In [[England]] and [[Wales]] there are several classes of notaries. English notaries who, like solicitors, barristers, legal executives and licensed conveyancers, are also '''commissioners for oaths''', also acquire the same powers as [[solicitor]]s and other law practitioners, with the exception of the right to represent others before the courts (unless also members of the bar or admitted as a solicitor) once they are licensed or commissioned notaries. In practice almost all English notaries, and all Scottish ones, are also solicitors, but typically do not perform such services.<ref>[http://www.thenotariessociety.org.uk/public_statement.asp The Notaries Society] (England & Wales)</ref> Commissioners of oaths are able to undertake the bulk of routine domestic attestation work within the UK, and many documents, including signatures for normal property transactions, do not need professional attestation of signature at all, a lay witness being sufficient. In practice the need for notaries in purely English legal matters is very small; for example they are not involved in normal property transactions. Since a great many [[solicitor]]s also perform the function of commissioners for oaths and can witness routine declarations etc. (all are qualified to do so, but not all offer the service), most work performed by notaries relates to international matters in some way, and documents needing to be used abroad, and many of the small number of English notaries have strong foreign language skills and often a foreign legal qualification. [http://www.thenotariessociety.org.uk/ The Notaries Society] gives the number of notaries in England and Wales as "about 1000," all but 70 of whom are solicitors. There
