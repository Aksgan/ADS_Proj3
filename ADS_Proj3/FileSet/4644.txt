There is no [[Technical standard|standard]] for defining the term, and some difference of opinion is possible as to the degree to which a given OS is "Unix-like". The term can include [[free and open source software|free and open source]] operating systems inspired by [[Bell Labs]]’ Unix or designed to emulate its features, commercial and proprietary work-alikes, and even versions based on the [[software license|licensed]] UNIX source code (which may be sufficiently "Unix-like" to pass certification and bear the "UNIX" trademark). Free and open source examples are sometimes known as '''Freenix'''.<ref>“FREENIX” has been used by the [[USENIX]] conferences to refer to Free and Open Source Software.[http://www.usenix.org/events/bytopic/freenix.html]</ref> == The term "Unix-like" and the UNIX trademark == [[The Open Group]] owns the [[UNIX]] [[trademark]] and administers the Single UNIX Specification, with the "UNIX" name being used as a [[certification mark]]. They do not approve of the construction "Unix-like", and consider it a misuse of their trademark. Their guidelines require "UNIX" to be presented in uppercase or otherwise distinguished from the surrounding text, strongly encourage using it as a branding adjective for a generic word such as "system", and discourage its use in hyphenated phrases.<ref>[http://www.opengroup.org/tm-guidelines.htm Trademark Guidelines], About The Open Group.</ref> Other parties frequently treat "Unix" as a [[genericized trademark]].

These patterns do not literally match many system names, but are still generally recognized to refer to any UNIX descendant or work-alike system, even those with completely dissimilar names such as [[Solaris Operating System|Solaris]], [[FreeBSD]] or [[Mac OS X]].

Most (but not all) commercial UNIX systems fall into this category. So do the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] systems, which are descendants of work done at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Some of these systems have no original AT&T code but can still trace their ancestry to AT&T designs. ;Trademark or Branded UNIX: These systems—largely commercial in nature—have been determined by the [[Open Group]] to meet the [[Single UNIX Specification]] and are allowed to carry the UNIX name. Most such systems are commercial derivatives of the [[System V]] code base in one form or another, though a few (such as IBM [[z/OS]]) earned the trademark through a [[POSIX]] [[compatibility layer]] and are not otherwise inherently Unix systems. Notably, Apple [[Mac OS X]] [[Mac OS X Leopard|10.5]] and later is [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] variant, and has been certified. Many [[ancient UNIX]] systems no longer meet this definition. ;Functional UNIX: Broadly, any Unix-like system that behaves in a manner roughly consistent with the UNIX specification; more specifically, this can refer to systems such as [[Linux]] or [[Minix]] that behave similarly to a UNIX system but have no genetic or trademark connection to the AT&T code base. Most free/open-source implementations of the UNIX design, whether genetic UNIX or not, fall into the restricted definition of this third category due to the expense of obtaining Open Group certification, which costs thousands of dollars, not being commercially necessary. ==Compatibility layers== Some non-Unix-like operating systems provide a Unix-like [[compatibility layer]], with variable degrees of Unix-like functionality. *IBM [[z/OS]]'s POSIX compatibility layer is sufficiently complete to be certified as trademark UNIX. *[[Cygwin]] provides a reasonably complete [[GNU]] environment, sufficient for most common [[open source]] software to be compiled and run, with some emulation of [[Linux]], on top of the [[Microsoft Windows]] [[Windows API|user API]]. *[[Interix]] provides Unix-like functionality as a [[Windows NT]] [[Architecture of Windows NT|subsystem]]. == Development of Unix-like
