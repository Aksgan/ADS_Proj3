It is geographically situated in the northwestern part of Beijing city, in a band between the northwestern [[3rd Ring Road (Beijing)|Third Ring Road]] and the northwestern [[4th Ring Road (Beijing)|Fourth Ring Road]]. Zhongguancun is very well known in China, and is often referred to as "China's Silicon Valley".{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} ==History== [[File:中关村广场西南景致.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The southwest landscape of Zhongguan plaza.]] {{Details|Haidian District|the early history of the area|C}} Zhongguancun has long existed since 1950's and only became a household name in the early 1980s. The first person who envisioned the future for Zhongguancun was [[Chen Chunxian]], a member of the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] (CAS), who came up with the idea for a [[Silicon Valley]] in China after he visited the U.S. as part of a government-sponsored trip. The location of the Chinese Academy of Sciences within Zhongguancun reinforced, and perhaps was in part responsible for the technological growth in this area. Throughout the 1980s and still today, Zhongguancun was known as "electronics avenue," because of its connections to information technology and the preponderance of stores along a central, crowded street. Zhongguancun was officially recognized by the central government of China in 1988. It was given the wordy name "Beijing High-Technology Industry Development Experimental Zone." The current designation Zhongguancun refers commonly to the original site. However, officially (as of 1999) Zhongguancun has become the "Zhongguancun Science & Technology Zone." It is a zone with seven parks, including Haidian Park, Fengtai Park, Changping Park, Electronics City (in Chaoyang), Yizhuang Park, Desheng Park, and Jianxiang Park. The original Zhongguancun is now known as the Haidian Park of the Zhongguancun Zone. The area and environs, however, remain the same. ==Notable areas== [[File:中关村科技园全景图.jpg|thumb|Panorama of tech hub.]] [[File:20030511021028 - 中关村.jpg|thumb|Inside the Hilon market building.]] [[Hailong Market]], [[Guigu Market]], [[Taipingyang Market]], [[Dinghao Market]] and [[Kemao Market]] are the five prominent IT and electronics markets. They are technology bazaars, famous for their "shops with a shop", where prices are easily but grudgingly bargained. Zhongguancun shops mainly deal in [[IBM PC compatible|PC]]-compatible hardware, peripherals and software. AppleCentre and Apple Experience Centre are also close by. ==Notable education and research centres== Due to the proximity and participation of China's two most prestigious universities, [[Peking University]] and [[Tsinghua University]], along with the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]], many analysts elsewhere are optimistic about Zhongguancun's future prospects. Notable high schools in Zhongguancun include [[High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China]]. ==Notable companies== The most famous companies that grew up in Zhongguancun are [[Stone Group]], [[Founder Group]], and [[Lenovo Group]]. They were all founded in 1984-85. Stone was the first successful technology company to be operated by individuals outside the government in China. Founder is a technology company that spun off [[Peking University]]. Lenovo Group
