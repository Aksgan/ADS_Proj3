more slowly than its nominal speed. Duplex mismatch may be inadvertently caused when an administrator configures an interface to a fixed mode (e.g. 100 Mbit/s full duplex) and fails to configure the remote interface, leaving it set to autonegotiate. Then, when the autonegotiation process fails, half duplex is assumed by the autonegotiating side of the link. The resulting [[duplex mismatch]] results in a dramatically slow network, in which many [[Collision (telecommunications)|collisions]], and especially [[late collision]]s occur on the interface set to half-duplex, and [[Frame check sequence|FCS]] errors are seen on the full-duplex side. <ref>[http://www.sun.com/blueprints/0704/817-7526.pdf Ethernet Autonegotiation Best Practices]</ref> [[Gigabit Ethernet]] standards require autonegotiation to be on in order to operate. ==Higher speeds== {| class="wikitable" |- !
