It is a sample-based version of the [[Fisher information]]. ==Definition== Suppose we observe [[Random_variable|random variables]] <math>X_1,\ldots,X_n</math>, independent and identically distributed with density ''f''(''X''; θ), where θ is a (possibly unknown) vector. Then the log-likelihood of the parameters <math>\theta</math> given the data <math>X_1,\ldots,X_n</math> is :<math>\ell(\theta | X_1,\ldots,X_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n \log f(X_i| \theta) </math>. We define the '''observed information matrix''' at <math>\theta^{*}</math> as :<math>\mathcal{J}(\theta^*) = - \left. \nabla \nabla^{\top} \ell(\theta) \right|_{\theta=\theta^*} </math> ::<math>= - \left. \left( \begin{array}{cccc} \tfrac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta_1^2} & \tfrac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta_1 \partial \theta_2} & \cdots & \tfrac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta_1 \partial \theta_n} \\ \tfrac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta_2 \partial \theta_1} & \tfrac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta_2^2} & \cdots & \tfrac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta_2 \partial \theta_n} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ \tfrac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta_n \partial \theta_1} & \tfrac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta_n \partial \theta_2} & \cdots & \tfrac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta_n^2} \\ \end{array} \right) \ell(\theta) \right|_{\theta = \theta^*} </math> In many instances, the observed information is evaluated at the [[Maximum likelihood|maximum-likelihood estimate]].<ref>Dodge, Y.

Instead, all events are taken to be caused directly by [[God]] himself. (A related theory, which has been called 'occasional causation', also denies a link of efficient causation between mundane events, but may differ as to the identity of the true cause that replaces them.<ref>Steven Nadler, 'The Occasionalism of Louis de la Forge', in Nadler (ed.), ''Causation in Early Modern Philosophy'' (University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1993), 57–73; Nadler, 'Descartes and Occasional Causation', ''British Journal for the History of Philosophy'', 2 (1994) 35–54.</ref>) The theory states that the illusion of efficient causation between mundane events arises out of God's habitual causing of one event after another. However, there is no necessary connection between the two: it is not that the first event ''causes'' God to cause the second event: rather, God first causes one and then causes the other. == Islamic theological schools == The doctrine first reached prominence in the [[Islamic theology|Islamic theological]] schools of [[Iraq]], especially in [[Basra]]. The ninth century theologian [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari]] argued that there is no secondary causation in the created order. The world is sustained and governed through direct intervention of a divine primary causation. As such the
