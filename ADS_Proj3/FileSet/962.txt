Sometimes authors who do not want credit for their work directly may choose to use a [[pen name]]. A [[ghostwriter]] gives all or some of the credit for his or her writing to someone else. ==In computing== In [[computer software]] [[software license|licenses]], attribution of credit is sometimes a condition of licensing. For example, original versions of the [[BSD license]] controversially required credit to be provided in the advertisement for software that used licensed code, but only if features or use of the licensed software was mentioned in the advertisement. [[Software documentation]] is sometimes licensed under similar terms. For example, the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] (GFDL) used by [[Wikipedia]] requires that acknowledgments to authors be preserved. ==See also== *[[Acknowledgment (creative arts)]] *[[Attribution]] *[[Closing credits]] *[[Opening credits]] *[[Plagiarism]] *[[Title sequence]] [[Category:Film and video terminology]] [[Category:Writing]] [[Category:Collaboration]] [[he:קרדיט (יצירה)]] [[ja:クレジットタイトル]]</text> </page> <page> <id>8430</id> <title>Crestron Electronics</title> <text>{{COI|date=March 2010}} {{Unreferenced|date=March 2010}} {{Infobox company| company_name = Crestron Electronics, Inc. | company_logo = [[Image:Crestron logo blue.png|250px]] | company_type = [[Private company|Private]] | company_slogan = | foundation = (1968) | location = [[Rockleigh, New Jersey|Rockleigh]], [[New Jersey]] | key_people = [[George Feldstein]], President| num_employees = 2,500+ | industry = Automation and control | products = [[Home automation]] | revenue = 400 (est) Million USD (2009) | address = 15 Volvo Drive, Rockleigh, New Jersey 07647 | telephone = +201-7673400 | homepage = [http://www.crestron.com/ www.crestron.com] }} '''Crestron Electronics''' is a company that manufacturers high-end systems for [[home automation]] and audio/video control.

Most transportation systems use software to manage the crew scheduling process. Crew scheduling becomes more and more complex as you add variables to the problem. These variables can be as simple as 1 location, 1 skill requirement, 1 shift of work and 1 set roster of people. In the Transportation industries, such as Rail or mainly Air Travel, these variables become very complex. In Air Travel for instance, there are numerous rules or "constraints" that are introduced. These mainly deal with legalities relating to work shifts and time, and a crew members qualifications for working on a particular aircraft. Add numerous locations to
