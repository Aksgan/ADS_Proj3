is on individual player's capture and care of horses, mini games, arena competitions and the dozens of horse breeds the game offers. The game is geared to include gamers of all ages so it has parental filters in place. The game currently has a player of base of around 10,000.<ref>Heath Hindman ''RPG Land'', November 9th, 2010, "[http://rpgland.com/news/horse-isle-2-out-of-the-gate-tops-10k/]", Retrieved 11/18/2010</ref> Player criticism of the game seems to center around lag issues and lack of challenge for experienced gamers. One of the biggest features of the game is that it is completely browser based but is a fully graphical online rpg. The artwork in Horse Isle has a 2D style with hand drawn images. The '''Horse Isle''' series uses educational elements involved in progressing through the games. These focus around reading comprehension, spelling, mathematics, science, and a lot of problem solving.<ref>''Super Smart Games'', December 30th, 2007, "[http://www.supersmartgames.com/Big_Kids/Life_Skills/Horse_Isle/]", Retrieved 11/19/2010</ref> == References == {{Reflist}} [[Horse Sim Game]] == External links == * [http://hi1.horseisle.com/ Official Horse Isle 1 Website] * [http://hi2.horseisle.com/www Official Horse Isle 2 Website] * [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-166941599.html?key=01-42160D517E19126F1A0E031A0F674B2E224E324D3417295C30420B61651B617F137019731B7B1D6B39/ "Couple's Business all Fun and Games"] <!--- Categories ---> {{DEFAULTSORT:Horse Isle (Video Game)}} [[Category:Articles created via the Article Wizard]] [[Category:Flash platform games]] [[Category:Puzzle video games]] [[Category:Children's websites]] [[Category:Browser-based multiplayer online games]] [[Category:Virtual pets]] [[Category:2007 video games]] [[Category:2010 video games]]</text> </page> <page> <id>16960</id> <title>Horsez</title> <text>{{Infobox VG |title = Horsez |image = [[Image:Horsez Coverart.png]] |caption = |developer = [[MTO (video game company)|MTO]] |publisher = [[Ubisoft]] |distributor = |designer = |license = |series = ''[[Petz]]'' |engine = |version = |released = '''Nintendo DS'''<br>{{vgrelease|PAL=October 26, 2006}}{{vgrelease|NA=November 28, 2006}}'''PlayStation 2'''<br>{{vgrelease|PAL=November 2, 2006}}{{vgrelease|NA=November 14, 2006}}'''Windows'''<br>{{vgrelease|PAL=November 2, 2006}}{{vgrelease|NA=November 16, 2006}}'''Game Boy Advance'''<br>{{vgrelease|NA=July 2, 2007}} |genre = Strategy |modes = |ratings = {{vgratings|ESRB=Everyone|OFLCA=General}} |platforms = [[Game Boy Advance]], [[Nintendo DS]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] |media = |requirements = |input = }} '''''Horsez''''' is a videogame released by [[Ubisoft]] on October 26, 2006 for the [[Nintendo DS]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Personal computer|PC]] and [[Game Boy Advance]]. This PC game is the sequel to ''[[Champion Dreams: First to Ride]]'' and is also part of the second series of [[Petz]]. In ''Horsez'', you play as Flora (this is the default name), a new member of the Sycamore Academy. Players can select a horse from one of 5 breeds and a range of colours. The player trains their horse in different disciplines, enters shows, cares for their horse, and after a few weeks gains a foal to raise. ''Horsez'' is also known as ''[[Pippa Funnell]] 3: The Golden Stirrup Challenge.'' ==Gameplay== As the player, you have to arrange your timetable so that you can pass each week. To pass, you must obtain a certain score out of 10 for each of the disciplines, and must train in that discipline at least twice a week. The disciplines are Horse Care, Cross Country, Dressage, Showjumping, and later Foal Care and Learning. You must also have a high social rating, which is obtained by spending time in the Student Centre talking to other academy riders, performing well in disciplines, taking and displaying photographs in the Student Centre, and purchasing items from the shops. Between training and caring for your horse, foal, and talking to the other riders, you may go shopping, change your attire in your bedroom, study in the library and go for a walk with your horse. In each country, there are a number of secrets to find. These are small figurines, and there are 10 in total. Throughout the game, the player is sometimes given control of the protagonist or the horse, and can move around freely. There are numerous cutscenes, events where your character has to find something (some of these can be very difficult) and riddles. Preceding many events is a journal entry with a voiceover. These events, combined with the contrasting disciplines, ensure the gameplay is variable. ==Starting== First, the player must choose a name for the character they will be playing and a mount. The player can choose from 5 breeds: [[Arabian]] Thoroughbred, English [[Thoroughbred]], [[Connemara pony|Connemara]], [[Appaloosa]] and [[Saddlebred]]. Each breed has a range of colours including a number of shades of brown, bay and grey. After the horse is selected and named (the horse's name is ignored for the rest of the game), play begins with a journal entry and a cutscene. The player is then given control of the horse. ==Characters== The main character is Flora and her horse. Other characters include the staff at the riding academy, fellow riders, and later the player's rival, Daniela. Daniela's director is Esteban, who had a previous relationship with Jade. '''Friends:''' <br /> Miguel: Male, short brown hair, glasses. Shy, loves poetry. Has a crush on the protagonist. <br /> Samuel: Male, dark skin, black hair. Loves loud rock music. <br /> Caroll: Female, red hair. Fairly quiet, can be a bit slow. <br /> Aurelie: Female, brown hair. Plays the violin. Likes fashion. In the Student Centre, the player can talk to these friends and learn their stories. ==Disciplines== '''Horse Care:''' Taking care of a horse. Horse Care includes hosing, grooming, picking his hooves and mucking his stall. It is best to do this at least 3 times a week. '''Cross Country:''' You canter your horse around the course, pressing the spacebar key to jump when you are in the right spot (there is a green circle that you must be in when you jump, otherwise your horse will baulk or throw you). '''Dressage:''' You press the left and right arrow keys in time to make your horse perform the correct gait. Other keys are also used to control your horse and halt and salute. You need to go to the library and read the books on all the gaits each week to ensure you know them all, otherwise your horse won't do them. '''Showjumping:''' A fairly difficult discipline to master. You canter inside the ring following the arrows and jumping at the jumps. '''Foal Care:''' Once you have your foal, you have to take care of it. During Foal Care, your foal will
