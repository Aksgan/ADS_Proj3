'''Ro'''utines",<ref>[http://www.allegro.cc/forums/thread/573313/574083#target Forum posting by Shawn Hargreaves]</ref> Allegro was originally created by [[Shawn Hargreaves]] for the [[Atari ST]] in the early 1990s. However, Shawn abandoned the Atari version as he realized the platform was dying, and reimplemented his work for the [[Borland]] C++ and [[DJGPP]] compilers in 1995. Support for Borland C++ was dropped in version 2.0, and DJGPP was the only supported compiler. As DJGPP was a [[DOS]] compiler, all games which used Allegro therefore used DOS. Around 1998, Allegro branched out into several versions. A port to [[Microsoft Windows]], WinAllegro, was created, and also during this time, a Unix port of Allegro, XwinAllegro, was created. These various ports were brought together during the Allegro 3.9 WIP versions, with Allegro 4.0 being the first stable version of Allegro to support multiple platforms. The current version of Allegro supports Unix ([[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], [[Irix]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]]), Windows ([[MSVC]], [[MinGW]], [[Cygwin]], [[Borland C++]]), [[Mac OS X]] and, up to the 4.2 version, [[BeOS]], [[QNX]], and DOS ([[DJGPP]], [[Watcom C Compiler|Watcom]]). An iPhone port is being developed too<ref>[https://alleg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/alleg/allegro/branches/4.9/src/iphone/ the iPhone directory in the svn repository]</ref>. Shawn Hargreaves is no longer involved with Allegro. For hardware accelerated 3D and 2D acceleration on Linux, Mac OS X and DOS, AllegroGL and OpenLayer are available. They are two add-on libraries that use [[OpenGL]] for accelerated graphics routines and use Allegro for all other gaming needs. Note that, combined with [[Glide API|Glide]] and [[Mesa 3D|MesaFX]] (using [[3dfx]] hardware), AllegroGL is one of the few available opensource solutions for hardware accelerated 3D under DOS.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mesa 3-D graphics library|author=Daniel Borca <!-- BOT GENERATED AUTHOR -->|url=http://www.geocities.com/dborca/opengl/mesa.html|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kmXKDZoH|archivedate=2009-10-25|deadurl=yes}}</ref> ==Graphic functions== * Vector drawing: ** pixels, lines, rectangles, circles, ellipses, arcs, Bezier splines ** shape fill, with or without pattern ** polygons: flat, Gouraud, textured (3D) and translucent * Sprites: ** masked, compressed and compiled sprites ** blitting, rotation, stretching, reduction, alpha blending, Gouraud shading ** native support for BMP, LBM, PCX and TGA files (others supported with library extensions) * Color palettes: ** color palette manipulation (reading, writing, conversion) ** conversion of color formats RGB <-> HSV * Text: ** support for different encodings and conversion, default is UTF-8 ** bitmap fonts (masking, colouring, alignment) * Misc: ** draw directly on the screen or on any-size memory bitmaps ** hardware scrolling and triple buffering (where available), mode-X split screen ** animation functions for FLI/FLC format<ref>[http://alleg.sourceforge.net/readme.html Allegro Introduction]</ref> ==Allegro 5== Current development is focused on the Allegro 5 branch, with the current version 5.0.0 (RC4). Allegro 5 is a complete redesign of the API and much of the internal operation of the library. An effort was made to make the API more consistent, and multi-thread safe. By default, the library will now be hardware accelerated using OpenGL or DirectX rendering backends where appropriate. Many of the addons that existed as separate projects for Allegro 4 will be rewritten to interface more seamlessly with Allegro proper and will be bundled with the default installation. ==Allegro X3== The unknown Allegro project called Allegro X3 which started in 2003 was to introduce two new platforms (Xbox, PS2) unfortunately the project was abandoned because of insufficient funds and other unknown matters in development. ==See also== *[[Simple DirectMedia Layer|SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)]] *[[DirectX]] *[[OpenGL]] *[[ClanLib]] *[[OpenML]] *[[PLIB]] *[[Microsoft XNA|XNA]] *[[List of game engines]] *[[SFML]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://alleg.sourceforge.net/ Allegro website] * [http://www.allegro.cc/ allegro.cc] * [http://wiki.allegro.cc/ Allegro Wiki] * [http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/ Shawn Hargreaves's Homepage] * [http://www.allegro.cc/depot/action/ Games Using Allegro] {{DEFAULTSORT:Allegro Library}} [[Category:AmigaOS 4 software]] [[Category:C libraries]] [[Category:Free game engines]] [[Category:Free software programmed in C]] [[Category:Graphics libraries]] [[Category:Video game development]] [[Category:Widget toolkits]] [[Category:Cross-platform software]] [[ar:ألجرو]] [[cs:Allegro (knihovna)]] [[de:Allegro-Bibliothek]] [[es:Allegro (biblioteca de programación)]] [[fr:Allegro (bibliothèque)]] [[it:Allegro (libreria software)]] [[pl:Allegro (informatyka)]] [[pt:Allegro (biblioteca)]] [[sk:Allegro (softvér)]] [[fi:Allegro (ohjelmointi)]] [[zh:Allegro]]</text> </page> <page> <id>1516</id> <title>Allele frequency net database</title> <text>{{infobox_biodatabase |title = Allele frequency net |logo =[[File:Database.png]] |description = online repository for immune gene frequencies in worldwide populations. |scope = |organism = [[Homo sapiens]] |center = [[University of Liverpool]] |laboratory = Institute of Infection and Global Health |author = |pmid = PMID 21062830 |released = 2010 |standard = |format = |url = http://www.allelefrequencies.net |download = |webservice = |sql = |sparql = |webapp = |standalone = |license = |versioning = |frequency = |curation = |bookmark = }}'''The allele frequency net database''' is a database containing the frequencies of immune genes and their corresponding alleles in different populations.<ref>{{cite journal | quotes = yes|last=Gonzalez-Galarza|first=Faviel F|authorlink=|coauthors=Christmas Stephen, Middleton Derek, Jones Andrew R|year=2011|month=Jan|title=Allele frequency net: a database and online repository for immune gene frequencies in worldwide populations|journal = Nucleic Acids Res.|volume=39|issue=Database issue|pages=D913-9|publisher= |location = England| issn = | pmid = 21062830|doi = 10.1093/nar/gkq1128| bibcode = | oclc =| id = | url = | language = eng| format = | accessdate = | laysummary = | laysource = | laydate = | quote = }}</ref> ==References== <references/> ==See also== * [[Allele frequency]] ==External links== * http://www.allelefrequencies.net {{Biodatabase-stub}} [[Category:Biological databases]] [[Category:Immunology]] [[Category:Genetics]] [[Category:Population genetics]]</text> </page> <page> <id>1556</id> <title>AlphaWorks</title> <text>{{lowercase|title=alphaWorks}} '''alphaWorks''' is [[IBM]]'s "emerging technology portal". It is a web community for [[early adopter]]s to preview and collaborate on prototype technology from IBM Research labs. alphaWorks was founded in August 1996, in IBM's Advanced Technology group (called "Internet Division" at the time). The alphaWorks program has launched early release technology implementations in nascent technology communities of software developers, in areas like [[Java (programming language)|Java]] technology, [[XML]] and [[web services]]. Since 1996, alphaWorks has succeeded in helping IBM connect with innovative developers to lead the development of promising new standards (for example, [[Enterprise_Media_Bean|Enterprise Media Beans]]), products and open source technology. alphaWorks is a key aspect of the [[developerWorks]] resource for developers. == External links == *[http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/?S_TACT=105AGY59&S_CMP=14&ca=dtl-14 alphaWorks web site] {{network-software-stub}} {{IBM}} <!-- I would be quite liberal in adding any technology that alphaWorks actively supports to this list, the article has not a great deal of other purpose --> [[Category:IBM]] [[Category:Cell BE architecture]] [[ru:AlphaWorks]]</text> </page> <page> <id>1576</id> <title>Alpine Club classification of the Eastern Alps</title> <text>[[File:Ostalpeneinteilung Vierteilung.PNG|thumb|upright=1.6|Map of the classification of the Eastern Alps.<br> Blue: Northern Limestone Alps, Yellow: Central Eastern
