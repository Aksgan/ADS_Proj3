irrigation cum groundwater model]] The initial and boundary conditions may vary from place to place. The boundary conditions may be kept either constant or be made variable in time. ===Parameters=== The parameters usually concern the [[geometry]] of and [[distance]]s in the domain to be modelled and those physical properties of the aquifer that are more or less constant with time but that may be variable in space. Important parameters are the [[Topographic map|topography]], thicknesses of soil layers and their horizontal/vertical [[hydraulic conductivity]] (permeability for water), [[Hydraulic conductivity#Transmissivity|aquifer transmissivity]] and [[Hydraulic conductivity#Resistance|resistance]], [[Porosity|aquifer porosity]] and [[Specific storage|storage coefficient]], as well as the [[capillarity]] of the unsaturated zone. For more details see the article on [[hydrogeology]]. Some parameters may be influenced by changes in the groundwater situation, like the thickness of a soil layer that may reduce when the water table drops and/the hydraulic pressure is reduced. This phenomenon is called [[subsidence]]. The thickness, in this case, is variable in time and not a parameter proper. ==Applicability== The applicability of a groundwater model to a real situation depends on the '''accuracy''' of the input data and the [[parameters]]. Determination of these requires considerable study, like collection of hydrological data ([[rainfall]], [[evapotranspiration]], [[irrigation]], [[drainage]]) and determination of the parameters mentioned before including [[pumping test]]s. As many parameters are quite variable in space, expert judgment is needed to arrive at representative values. The models can also be used for the '''if-then analysis''': if the value of a parameter is A, then what is the result, and if the value of the parameter is B instead, what is the influence? This analysis may be sufficient to obtain a rough impression of the groundwater behavior, but it can also serve to do a ''sensitivity analysis'' to answer the question: which factors have a great influence and which have less influence. With such information one may direct the efforts of investigation more to the influential factors. When sufficient data have been assembled, it is possible to determine some of missing information by '''calibration'''. This implies that one assumes a range of values for the unknown or doubtful value of a certain parameter and one runs the model repeatedly while comparing results with known corresponding data. For example if [[salinity]] figures of the groundwater are available and the value of [[hydraulic conductivity]] is uncertain, one assumes a range of conductivities and the selects that value of conductivity as "true" that yields salinity results close to the observed values, meaning that the groundwater flow as governed by the hydraulic conductivity is in agreemnent with the salinity conditions. This procedure is similar to the measurement of the flow in a river or canal by letting very saline water of a known salt concentration drip into the channel and measuring the resulting salt concentration downstream. ==Dimensions== {{wrapper}} |[[File:DrainSection2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Fig 4.

Two and three-dimensional models can take into account the [[anisotropy]] of the aquifer with respect to the [[hydraulic conductivity]], i.e. this property may vary in different directions. === One, two and three dimensional=== #One-dimensional models can be used for the vertical flow in a system of parallel horizontal layers. #[[Two-dimensional space|Two-dimensional]] models apply to a vertical plane while it is assumed that the groundwater conditions repeat themselves in other parallel vertical planes (Fig. 4).

To that end the flow region must be subdivided into smaller elements (or cells), in both horizontal and vertical sense. Within each cell the parameters are maintained constant, but they may vary between the cells (Fig. 5). Using [[Numerical analysis|numerical solutions]] of [[groundwater flow equation]]s, the flow of groundwater may be found as horizontal, vertical and, more often, as '''intermediate'''. ===Semi three-dimensional=== In semi 3-dimensional models the [[horizontal]] flow is described by 2-dimensional flow equations (i. e. in horizontal x and y direction). [[Vertical]] flows (in z-direction) are described (a) with a 1-dimensional flow equation, or (b) derived from a [[Water balance (agriculture)|water balance]] of horizontal flows converting the excess of horizontally incoming over the horizontally outgoing groundwater into vertical flow under the assumption that water is [[Incompressible flow|incompressible]]. There are two classes of semi 3-dimensional models: *''Continuous models'' or ''radial models'' consisting of 2 dimensional submodels in vertical [[Radius|radial]] planes intersecting each other in one single axis. The flow pattern is repeated in each vertical plane fanning out from the central axis. *''Discretized models'' or ''prismatic models'' consisting of submodels formed by vertical blocks or [[Prism (geometry)|prism]]s for the horizontal flow combined with one or more methods of [[Superposition principle|superposition]] of the vertical flow. '''Continuous radial model'''<br /> Een example of a non-discretized radial model is the description of groundwater flow moving radially towards a [[Water well|deep well]] in a network of wells from which water is abstracted.<ref>''Subsurface drainage by (tube)wells: well spacing equations for fully and partially penetrating wells in
