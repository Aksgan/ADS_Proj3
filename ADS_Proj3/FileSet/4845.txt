WISH makes use of three different priority classifiers which enables a user to choose what kind of traffic should be preferred.<ref>http://documentation.netgear.com/wnhde111/enu/202-10300-01/WNHDE111-08-3.html</ref> *'''[[HTTP]]''' With this option enabled video and audio streams that use HTTP (so basically all videos played in the browser) are preferred over other kinds of traffic. *'''Windows Media Center''' With this option enabled the access point will recognize specific video and audio streams used by Media center PC's and [[Windows Media Center Extenders]], for instance the [[Xbox 360]]. *'''Automatic''' Automatic mode makes the access point attempt to prioritize traffic that is recognized as a stream but not necessarily a HTTP or Windows Media Center stream. Also this de-prioritizes transfers such as file transfers. Since games and VoIP are left at normal priority so games and VoIP traffic have an advantage to. Also, WISH allows the user to configure the system based on the following things: *For specific applications by traffic type *For specific [[online games]] by port addresses *From a specific device by [[IP addresses]] This enables the user to set a certain computer to a lower priority. This could help if the PC is, for example, only used for downloading. Also, PCs that are used for downloading and [[streaming media]] can use this to prioritize the streaming media above downloading, therefor decreasing the time used to load the stream. ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Network_performance]]</text> </page> <page> <id>40405</id> <title>Wireless local loop</title> <text>'''Wireless local loop''' (WLL), is a term for the use of a wireless communications link as the "[[last mile]] / first mile" connection for delivering [[plain old telephone service]] (POTS) and/or [[broadband]] [[Internet]] to telecommunications customers. Various types of WLL systems and technologies exist. Other terms for this type of access include '''Broadband Wireless Access''' (BWA), '''Radio In The Loop''' (RITL), '''Fixed-Radio Access''' (FRA) and '''Fixed Wireless Access''' (FWA). == Definition of Fixed Wireless Service == '''Fixed Wireless Terminal (FWT)''' units differ from conventional mobile terminal units operating within [[cellular network]]s – such as [[GSM]] – in that a [[Landline|fixed]] wireless terminal or desk phone will be limited to an almost permanent location with almost no [[roaming]] abilities. WLL and FWT are generic terms for radio based telecommunications technologies and the respective devices which can be implemented using a number of different wireless and radio technologies. Wireless Local Loop service is segmented into a number of broad market and deployment groups. Services are split between Licensed – commonly used by Carriers and [[Telephone company|Telcos]] – and Unlicensed services more commonly deployed by home users and [[Wireless Internet service provider | Wireless ISPs]] (WISPs). == Licensed Point to Point Microwave service == Licensed Microwave service has been used since the 1960s to transmit very large amounts of data. The [[AT&T Communications|AT&T Long Lines]] coast to coast backbone in the USA was largely carried over a chain of microwave towers. These systems have been largely using 3700-4200 MHz and 5000-6200 MHz. The 5 GHz band was even known as the "common carrier" band. This service typically was prohibitively expensive to be used for Local Loop, and was used for backbone networks. In the 80s and 90s it flourished under the growth of cell towers. This growth spurred research in this area, and as the cost continues to decline, it is being used as an alternative to T-1, T-3, and fiber connectivity. == Licensed Point to Multi Point Microwave service == Multipoint microwave licenses are generally more expensive than point to point licenses. A single point to point system could be installed and licensed for 50,000 to 200,000 USD. A multipoint license would start in the millions of dollars. [[Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service]] (MMDS) and [[Local Multipoint Distribution Service]] (LMDS) were the first true multi point services for wireless local loop. While Europe and the rest of the world developed the 3500 MHz band for affordable broadband fixed wireless, the U.S. provided LMDS and MMDS, and most implementations in the United States were conducted at 2500 MHz. The largest was Sprint Broadband's deployment of Hybrid Networks equipment. Sprint was plagued with difficulties operating the network profitably, and service was often spotty, due to inadequate radio link quality. == Unlicensed Multi Point Wireless Service == Most of the growth in long range radio communications since 2002 has been in the license free bands (mostly 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz). Global Pacific Internet and Innetix started wireless service in California in 1995 using Breezecom (Alvarion) frequency hopping radio which later became the standard 802.11. Few years later NextWeb Networks of Fremont beginning deploying reliable license free service. For Nextweb they originally deployed 802.11b equipment and later switched to Axxcelera which uses propriety protocol. ;1995–2004: License-Free Equipment Most of the early vendors of license free fixed wireless equipment such as Adaptive Broadband ([[Axxcelera]]), [[Trango Broadband]], Motorola (Orthogon), Proxim Networks, RedLine and BreezeCom ([[Alvarion]]) used proprietary protocols and hardware, creating pressure on the industry to adopt
