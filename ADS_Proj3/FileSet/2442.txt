'''canonical''' with respect to a property ''P'' of Kripke frames, if * ''X'' is valid in every frame which satisfies ''P'', * for any normal modal logic ''L'' which contains ''X'', the underlying frame of the canonical model of ''L'' satisfies ''P''. A union of canonical sets of formulas is itself canonical. It follows from the preceding discussion that any logic axiomatized by a canonical set of formulas is Kripke complete, and [[compactness theorem|compact]]. The axioms T, 4, D, B, 5, H, G (and thus any combination of them) are canonical. GL and Grz are not canonical, because they are not compact. The axiom M by itself is not canonical (Goldblatt, 1991), but the combined logic '''S4.1''' (in fact, even '''K4.1''') is canonical. In general, it is [[decision problem|undecidable]] whether a given axiom is canonical. We know a nice sufficient condition: H. Sahlqvist identified a broad class of formulas (now called [[Sahlqvist formula]]s) such that * a Sahlqvist formula is canonical, * the class of frames corresponding to a Sahlqvist formula is [[first-order logic|first-order]] definable, * there is an algorithm which computes the corresponding frame condition to a given Sahlqvist formula. This is a powerful criterion: for example, all axioms listed above as canonical are (equivalent to) Sahlqvist formulas. ===Finite model property=== A logic has the '''[[finite model property]]''' (FMP) if it is complete with respect to a class of finite frames. An application of this notion is the [[decidability (logic)|decidability]] question: it follows from [[Post's theorem]] that a recursively axiomatized modal logic ''L'' which has FMP is decidable, provided it is decidable whether a given finite frame is a model of ''L''. In particular, every finitely axiomatizable logic with FMP is decidable. There are various methods for establishing FMP for a given logic. Refinements and extensions of the canonical model construction often work, using tools such as [[#Model constructions|filtration]] or [[#Model constructions|unravelling]]. As another possibility, completeness proofs based on [[cut-elimination|cut-free]] [[sequent calculus|sequent calculi]] usually produce finite models directly. Most of the modal systems used in practice (including all listed above) have FMP. In some cases, we can use FMP to prove Kripke completeness of a logic: every normal modal logic is complete with respect to a class of [[modal algebra]]s, and a ''finite'' modal algebra can be transformed into a Kripke frame. As an example, Robert Bull proved using this method that every normal extension of '''S4.3''' has FMP, and is Kripke complete. ===Multimodal logics=== {{See also|Multimodal logic}} Kripke semantics has a straightforward generalization to logics with more than one modality. A Kripke frame for a language with <math>\{\Box_i\mid\,i\in I\}</math> as the set of its necessity operators consists of a non-empty set ''W'' equipped with binary relations ''R<sub>i</sub>'' for each ''i'' ∈ ''I''. The definition of a satisfaction relation is modified as follows: : <math>w\Vdash\Box_i A</math> if and only if <math>\forall u\,(w\;R_i\;u\Rightarrow u\Vdash A).</math> A simplified semantics, discovered by Tim Carlson, is often used for polymodal [[provability logic]]s. A '''Carlson model''' is a structure <math>\langle W,R,\{D_i\}_{i\in I},\Vdash\rangle</math> with a single accessibility relation ''R'', and subsets ''D<sub>i</sub>'' ⊆ ''W'' for each modality. Satisfaction is defined as : <math>w\Vdash\Box_i A</math> if and only if <math>\forall u\in D_i\,(w\;R\;u\Rightarrow u\Vdash A).</math> Carlson models are easier to visualize and to work with than usual polymodal Kripke models; there are, however, Kripke complete polymodal logics which are Carlson incomplete. ==Semantics of intuitionistic logic== Kripke semantics for the [[intuitionistic logic]] follows the same principles as the semantics of modal logic, but it uses a different definition of satisfaction. An '''intuitionistic Kripke model''' is a triple <math>\langle W,\le,\Vdash\rangle</math>, where <math>\langle W,\le\rangle</math> is a [[partially ordered set|partially ordered]] Kripke frame, and <math>\Vdash</math> satisfies the following conditions: * if ''p'' is a propositional variable, <math>w\le u</math>, and <math>w\Vdash p</math>, then <math>u\Vdash p</math> (''persistency'' condition), * <math>w\Vdash A\land B</math> if and only if <math>w\Vdash A</math> and <math>w\Vdash B</math>, * <math>w\Vdash A\lor B</math> if and only if <math>w\Vdash A</math> or <math>w\Vdash B</math>, * <math>w\Vdash A\to B</math> if and only if for all <math>u\ge w</math>, <math>u\Vdash A</math> implies <math>u\Vdash B</math>, * not <math>w\Vdash\bot</math>. Intuitionistic logic is sound and complete with respect to its Kripke semantics, and it has FMP. ===Intuitionistic first-order logic=== Let ''L'' be a [[first-order logic|first-order]] language. A Kripke model of ''L'' is a triple <math>\langle W,\le,\{M_w\}_{w\in W}\rangle</math>, where <math>\langle W,\le\rangle</math> is an intuitionistic Kripke frame, ''M<sub>w</sub>'' is a (classical) ''L''-structure for each node ''w'' ∈ ''W'', and the following compatibility conditions hold whenever ''u'' ≤ ''v'': * the domain of ''M<sub>u</sub>'' is included in the domain of ''M<sub>v</sub>'', * realizations of function symbols in ''M<sub>u</sub>'' and ''M<sub>v</sub>'' agree on elements of ''M<sub>u</sub>'', * for each ''n''-ary predicate ''P'' and elements ''a''<sub>1</sub>,…,''a<sub>n</sub>'' ∈ ''M<sub>u</sub>'': if ''P''(''a''<sub>1</sub>,…,''a<sub>n</sub>'') holds in ''M<sub>u</sub>'', then it holds in ''M<sub>v</sub>''. Given an evaluation ''e'' of variables by elements of ''M<sub>w</sub>'', we define the satisfaction relation <math>w\Vdash A[e]</math>: * <math>w\Vdash P(t_1,\dots,t_n)[e]</math> if and only if <math>P(t_1[e],\dots,t_n[e])</math> holds in ''M<sub>w</sub>'', * <math>w\Vdash(A\land B)[e]</math> if and only if <math>w\Vdash A[e]</math> and <math>w\Vdash B[e]</math>, * <math>w\Vdash(A\lor B)[e]</math> if and only if <math>w\Vdash A[e]</math> or <math>w\Vdash B[e]</math>, * <math>w\Vdash(A\to B)[e]</math> if and only if for all <math>u\ge w</math>, <math>u\Vdash A[e]</math> implies <math>u\Vdash B[e]</math>, * not <math>w\Vdash\bot[e]</math>, * <math>w\Vdash(\exists x\,A)[e]</math> if and only if there exists an <math>a\in M_w</math> such that <math>w\Vdash A[e(x\to a)]</math>, * <math>w\Vdash(\forall x\,A)[e]</math> if and only if for every <math>u\ge w</math> and every <math>a\in M_u</math>, <math>u\Vdash A[e(x\to a)]</math>. Here ''e''(''x''→''a'') is the evaluation which gives ''x'' the value ''a'', and otherwise agrees with ''e''.

That is, the 'local' aspect of existence for sections of a sheaf was a kind of logic of the 'possible'. Though this development was the work of
