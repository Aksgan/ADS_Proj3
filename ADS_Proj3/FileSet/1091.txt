He is still quite vocal in the Amiga community. ==Beginnings== Dave was born David Bruce Haynie on May 23, 1961, in [[Summit, New Jersey]], [[United States]]. He moved to [[Colts Neck, New Jersey]], in 1966, where he lived out his childhood with his three younger sisters. A few early [[Heathkit]] projects, and, at the age of 12, a run-in with his dad's borrowed HP desktop calculator changed his life forever. From 12 years on, he taught himself programming, initially on [[Time-sharing|timeshare]] systems from his dad's account at [[Bell Laboratories]]. Later on, he wrote programs on his best friend [[Scott Scherer]]'s [[Commodore PET]] 2001, the first home computer he had seen up close.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} He left for college at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in 1979. Four years later, he graduated with a double BS in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} ==The Commodore years== He started work at [[Commodore International|Commodore]] in 1983 as an engineer under [[Bil Herd]]. His first project was to help complete the [[MOS Technology TED|TED]] systems comprising [[Commodore Plus/4|Plus/4]], [[Commodore 16|C16]] and more. After completing the [[Commodore 128]] Bil Herd left the company and Dave Haynie was promoted to chief engineer in the low-end group. After Commodore acquired [[Amiga]], Dave Haynie ended up primary engineer on the expandable [[Amiga 2000|A2000]] computer. Later, he joined [[Bob Welland]] on the [[A2620]] CPU module, and launched the follow-up [[A2630]] the year thereafter. These were delivered in the [[Amiga 2500|A2500/20]] (1989) and [[Amiga 2500|A2500/30]] (1989).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In 1989 he started designing the [[Zorro III]] expansion bus architecture, and in 1990, with [[Greg Berlin]], [[Hedley Davis]], [[Jeff Boyer]], and [[Scott Hood]], created the [[Amiga 3000]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} On completing the A3000 he was transferred to advanced projects, working with [[Bob Raible]] on the "AA" system (formerly "Pandora"), Commodore's first full 24-bit color computer technology, which led to the [[A3000plus|A3000+]] prototype, and ultimately to [[Amiga 4000|A4000]] and [[Amiga 1200|A1200]] computers, Commodore's last commercial efforts. He also worked on a system for the Advanced Amiga Architecture chipset, a highly aggressive 64-bit graphic chipset started in 1993. He defined a new system architecture for this, the [[Acutiator]] project.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Most of this work, as most of the practical work at Commodore, was terminated by the end of 1993 due to financial problems within Commodore. Dave Haynie left Commodore in June 1994, over a month after the bankruptcy, for [[Scala, Inc]]. He made a two-hour film of the last days of Commodore, from the West Chester Engineer's perspective, released in 1994, called ''The Deathbed Vigil and other tales of digital angst''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.frogpondmedia.com/dbv/video.html | title=The Deathbed Vigil | author=Frog Pond Media | date=16 June 2008 | accessdate=2010-10-24}}</ref> ==That first startup== Driven in part by the experiences of his friends at Amiga, he joined [[Scala, Inc]]. The goal here was to advance some desktop
