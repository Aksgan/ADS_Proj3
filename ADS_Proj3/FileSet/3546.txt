machine along with several hundred other visitors at the first computer show that was sponsored by the IEEE Westec in Los Angeles. Later that year the machine was also shown at the first Comdex show. The first mass-produced portable computer was the [[Osborne 1]], developed by [[Adam Osborne]], which owed much to the NoteTaker's design. Another early portable computer released in 1982 was the [[Kaypro]]. In January 1983, the first [[IBM PC compatible]] portable computer (and indeed the first 100% IBM PC compatible, or "clone," of any kind) was the [[Compaq Portable]]. The first full-color portable computer was the [[Commodore SX-64]] in January 1984. [[Apple, Inc.]] introduced a portable [[Apple IIc]] in April 1984, but would not release a [[Macintosh Portable]] until 1989, though the [[Compact Macintosh|original Macintosh]] was by its compact design, technically a portable. The term ''portable computer'' is now almost exclusively used to refer to portable computers that are larger than a [[laptop]], often use conventional parts such as an ATX motherboard and PS/2 style power supply and usually do not run on [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]]. Smaller portable computers are also known as '''[[mobile computing|mobile computers]]'''. They are referred to by their more specific terms: * The [[laptop]] (or notebook) with a [[flat panel display]] and [[computer keyboard|keyboard]], requiring a seated position and both hands. A relatively recently introduced modification has been the [[Tablet PC]], which essentially is a laptop operated with a stylus on a touch-sensitive screen. See also [[desktop replacement computer]], a large laptop designed to perform all of the functions of a [[desktop computer]]. * The [[sub-notebook]] which is something between a laptop and a [[personal digital assistant|PDA]]. They have a full keyboard (though often in reduced size), 11-13" screens and usually no internal optical drive. * The [[pocket computer]], which was mostly a phenomenon of the 1980s, and combined the features of an [[alphanumeric]] [[calculator]], a small [[home computer]] (usually programmable in [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]]), and a PDA. Manufacturers of these included [[RadioShack|Tandy/Radio Shack]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Casio]], and [[Sharp Corporation]]. * The [[personal digital assistant]] (PDA), usually held in one hand and operated with the other. * The [[wearable computer]] with [[handsfree]] [[User interface|interface]], and usually some voice capability ([[speech recognition]] and [[speech synthesis]]). Portable computers have been increasing in popularity over the past decade, as they do not restrict the user in terms of mobility as a [[desktop computer]] would. Wireless [[Internet]], extended [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] life and more comfortable [[ergonomics]] have been factors driving this increase in popularity. [[All-in-One PC]]s such as the [[iMac]] can also be considered portable computers and often have handles built-in to the case. ==See also== {{commonscat|Portable computers}} * [[Mobile computing]] * [[Mobile device]] * [[Laptops]] * [[Palmtop]]s * [[Personal digital assistant]] (PDA) * [[DYSEAC]] The Second Standards Electronic Automatic Computer. DYSEAC was a first-generation computer built by the National Bureau of Standards for the US Army Signal Corps. It was housed in a truck, making it one of the first portable computers (perhaps the first). It went into operation in April 1954. * [[Netbook]] == References == {{refs}} {{Computer sizes}} [[Category:Portable computers| ]] [[Category:Classes of computers]] [[de:Portable]] [[es:Computadora portable]] [[lt:Nešiojamasis kompiuteris]] [[ja:ポータブルコンピュータ]] [[pt:Computador portátil]] [[ro:Calculator portabil]] [[sk:Prenosný počítač]] [[zh:可移动计算机]]</text> </page> <page> <id>29678</id> <title>Positron emission tomography</title> <text>[[Image:ECAT-Exact-HR--PET-Scanner.jpg|thumb|250px|Image of a typical positron emission tomography (PET) facility]] [[File:16slicePETCT.jpg|thumb|250px|PET/CT-System with 16-slice CT; the ceiling mounted device is an injection pump for CT contrast agent]] '''Positron emission tomography''' ('''PET''') is a [[nuclear medicine]] [[medical imaging|imaging]] technique which produces a three-dimensional image or picture of functional processes in the body. The system detects pairs of [[gamma ray]]s emitted indirectly by a [[positron]]-emitting [[radionuclide]] (tracer), which is introduced into the body on a biologically active molecule. Images of tracer concentration in [[Three-dimensional space|3-dimensional]] or [[Fourth dimension|4-dimensional]] space (the 4th dimension being time) within the body are then reconstructed by computer analysis. In modern scanners, this reconstruction is often accomplished with the aid of a [[Computed tomography|CT X-ray scan]] performed on the patient during the same session, in the same machine. If the biologically active molecule chosen for PET is [[Fludeoxyglucose (18F)|FDG]], an analogue of [[glucose]], the concentrations of tracer imaged then give tissue metabolic activity, in terms of regional glucose uptake. Although use of this tracer results in the most common type of PET scan, other tracer molecules are used in PET to image the tissue concentration of many other types of molecules of interest. == History == The concept of emission and transmission tomography was introduced by [[David E. Kuhl]] and Roy Edwards in the late 1950s. Their work later led to the design and construction of several tomographic instruments at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. Tomographic imaging techniques were further developed by [[Michel Ter-Pogossian]], [[Michael E. Phelps]] and others at the [[Washington University School of Medicine]].<ref>{{cite journal | title=A positron-emission transaxial tomograph for nuclear imaging (PET) | last=Ter-Pogossian | first=M.M. | coauthors=M.E.
