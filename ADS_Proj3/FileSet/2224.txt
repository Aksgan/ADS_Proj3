This may be a result of the origin of the Internet, as well as English's role as a [[lingua franca]]. It may also be related to the poor capability of early computers, largely originating in the United States, to handle characters other than those in the English variant of the [[Latin alphabet]]. After English (28% of Web visitors) the most requested languages on the [[World Wide Web]] are Chinese (23%), Spanish (8%), Japanese (5%), Portuguese and German (4% each), Arabic, French and Russian (3% each), and Korean (2%).<ref>[http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats7.htm Internet World Stats], updated for 2009-12-31.

The Internet's technologies have developed enough in recent years, especially in the use of [[Unicode]], that good facilities are available for development and communication in the world's widely used languages. However, some glitches such as ''[[mojibake]]'' (incorrect display of some languages' characters) still remain. Common methods of [[Internet access]] in homes include [[dial-up Internet access|dial-up]], landline [[Broadband Internet access|broadband]] (over [[coaxial cable]], [[fiber optic]] or [[copper]] wires), [[Wi-Fi]], [[Satellite Internet|satellite]] and [[3G]]/[[4G]] technology [[mobile phone|cell phones]]. Public places to use the Internet include libraries and [[Internet cafe]]s, where computers with Internet connections are available. There are also [[Internet kiosk|Internet access points]] in many public places such as airport halls and coffee shops, in some cases just for brief use while standing. Various terms are used, such as "public Internet kiosk", "public access terminal", and "Web [[payphone]]". Many hotels now also have public terminals, though these are usually fee-based. These terminals are widely accessed for various usage like ticket booking, bank deposit, online payment etc. Wi-Fi provides wireless access to computer networks, and therefore can do so to the Internet itself. [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|Hotspots]] providing such access include [[Wi-Fi#Internet access|Wi-Fi cafes]], where would-be users need to bring their own wireless-enabled devices such as a laptop or [[Personal Digital Assistant|PDA]]. These services may be free to all, free to customers only, or fee-based. A hotspot need not be limited to a confined location. A whole campus or park, or even an entire city can be enabled. [[Grassroots]] efforts have led to [[wireless community network]]s. Commercial Wi-Fi services covering large city areas are in place in London, [[Vienna]], [[Toronto]], San Francisco, [[Philadelphia]], Chicago and [[Pittsburgh]]. The Internet can then be accessed from such places as a park bench.<ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000082&sid=aQ0ZfhMa4XGQ&refer=canada "Toronto Hydro to Install Wireless Network in Downtown Toronto"].

High-end mobile phones such as [[smartphone]]s generally come with Internet access through the phone network. Web browsers such as [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] are available on these advanced handsets, which can also run a wide variety of other Internet software. More mobile phones have Internet access than PCs, though this is not as widely used.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} An Internet access provider and protocol matrix differentiates the methods used to get online. ==Social impact== {{Main|Sociology of the Internet}} The Internet has enabled entirely new forms of social interaction, activities, and organizing, thanks to its basic features such as widespread usability and access. [[Social network service|Social networking]] websites such as Facebook, Twitter and MySpace have created new ways to socialize and interact. Users of these sites are able to add a wide variety of information to pages, to pursue common interests, and to connect with others. It is also possible to find existing acquaintances, to allow communication among existing groups of people. Sites like [[LinkedIn]] foster commercial and business connections. YouTube and [[Flickr]] specialize in users' videos and photographs. In the first decade of the 21st century the first generation is raised with widespread availability of Internet connectivity, bringing consequences and concerns in areas such as personal privacy and identity, and distribution of copyrighted materials. These "[[digital natives]]" face a variety of challenges that were not present for prior generations. The Internet has achieved new relevance as a political tool, leading to [[Internet censorship]] by some states. The presidential campaign of [[Howard Dean]] in 2004 in the United States was notable for its success in soliciting donation via the Internet. Many political groups use the Internet to achieve a new method of organizing in order to carry out their mission, having given rise to [[Internet activism]]. Some governments, such as those of [[Iran]], [[North Korea]], [[Myanmar]], the People's Republic of China, and [[Saudi Arabia]], restrict what people in their countries can access on the Internet, especially political and religious content.{{Citation
