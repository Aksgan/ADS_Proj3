year, as Turing's paper was received for publication in May 1936. (Also received for publication in 1936—in October, later than Turing's—was a short paper by Emil Post that discussed the reduction of an algorithm to a simple machine-like "method" very similar to Turing's computing machine model (see [[Post-Turing machine]] for details). * Turing's proof is made difficult by number of definitions required and its subtle nature. See [[Turing machine]] and [[Turing's proof]] for details. * Turing's first proof (of three) follows the schema of Richard's Paradox: Turing's computing machine is an algorithm represented by a string of seven letters in a "computing machine". Its "computation" is to test ''all'' computing machines (including itself) for "circles", and form a diagonal number from the computations of the non-circular or "successful" computing machines. It does this, starting in sequence from 1, by converting the numbers (base 8) into strings of seven letters to test. When it arrives at its own number, it creates ''its own'' letter-string. It decides it is the letter-string of a successful machine, but when it tries to do this machine's (''its own'') computation it locks in a circle and can't continue. Thus we have arrived at Richard's paradox. (If you are bewildered see Turing's proof for more). A number of similar undecidability proofs appeared soon before and after Turing's proof: # April 1935: Proof of [[Alonzo Church]] (''An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory''). His proof was to "...propose a definition of effective calculability ... and to show, by means of an example, that not every problem of this class is solvable" (Undecidable p. 90)) # 1946: [[Post correspondence problem]] (cf Hopcroft and Ullman p. 193ff, p. 407 for the reference) # April 1947: Proof of [[Emil Post]] (''Recursive Unsolvability of a Problem of Thue'') (Undecidable p. 293). This has since become known as "The Word problem of Thue" or "Thue's Word Problem" ([[Axel Thue]] proposed this problem in a paper of 1914 (cf References to Post's paper in Undecidable, p. 303). # [[Rice's theorem]]: a generalized formulation of Turing's second theorem (cf Hopcroft and Ullman p. 185ff)<ref>"...there can be no machine E which ... will determine whether M [an arbitrary machine] ever prints a given symbol (0 say)" (Undecidable p 134). Turing makes an odd assertion at the end of this proof that sounds remarkably like Rice's Theorem: :"...each of these "general process" problems can be expressed as a problem concerning a general process for determining whether a given integer n has a property G(n)... and this is equivalent to computing a number whose nth figure is 1 if G(n) is true and 0 if it is false" (Undecidable p 134). Unfortunately he doesn't clarify the point further, and the reader is left confused. </ref> # [[Greibach's theorem]]: undecidability in language theory (cf Hopcroft and Ullman p. 205ff and reference on p. 401 ibid: [[Sheila Greibach|Greibach]] [1963] "The undecidability of the ambiguity problem for minimal lineal grammars," ''Information and Control'' 6:2, 117-125, also reference on p. 402 ibid: Greibach [1968] "A note on undecidable properties of formal languages", Math Systems Theory 2:1, 1-6.) # [[Penrose tiling]] questions # Question of solutions for [[Diophantine equations]] and the resultant answer in the MRDP Theorem; see entry below. == The fundamental theorem of arithmetic == Gödel used these theorems in his proof (see below, more in Nagel and Newman p. 68). He figured out a way to express any mathematical formula or proof (in arithmetic) as a product of prime numbers raised to powers. And because he could factor any number into its unique primes, he was able to recover a formula or proof intact from its number by factoring it. A ''prime number'' is defined as a counting number that is divisible only by itself and 1. First theorem (cf Hardy and Wright, p. 2): : "Every positive integer (counting number), except 1, is a product of primes" OR Excepting 1, it is impossible to find a positive integer that is not a product of primes. Second theorem: ''[[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]]'' (cf Hardy and Wright p. 3): : Every integer (counting number) has a unique expression as a product of primes. OR: It is impossible to factor an integer into primes in more than one way. (This does not include "permutations" of the primes). Thus, if we pick a number e.g. 85, we see that it has prime factors 5 and 17, and this is unique (85 = 5&times;17 or 17&times;5), or 8 = 2&times;2&times;2 = 2<sup>3</sup>. Neither proof is particularly trivial. Hardy and Wright attribute an explicit statement of the Fundamental Theorem to Gauss. "It was, of course, familiar to earlier mathematicians" (Hardy and Wright, p. 10). == Is this string of 1's and 0's random? Chaitin's proof == For an exposition suitable for non-specialists see Beltrami p. 108ff. Also see Franzen Chapter 8 pp. 137–148, and Davis p. 263-266. Franzén's discussion is significantly more complicated than Beltrami's and delves into Ω -- [[Gregory Chaitin]]'s so-called "halting probability". Davis's older treatment approaches the question from a [[Turing machine]] viewpoint. Chaitin has written a number of books about his endeavors and the subsequent philosophic and mathematical fallout from them. : "A paraphrase of Chaitin's result is that there can be no formal proof that a sufficiently long string is random..." (Beltrami p. 109) Beltrami observes that "Chaitin's proof is related to a paradox posed by Oxford librarian G. Berry early in the twentieth century that asks for 'the smallest positive integer than cannot be defined by an English sentence with fewer than 1000 characters.' Evidently, the shortest definition of this number must have at least 1000 characters. However, the sentence within quotation marks, which is itself a definition of the alleged number is less than 1000 characters in length!"
