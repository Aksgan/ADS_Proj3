(A [[brute-force search]] would require 2<sup>80</sup> operations.) The authors write: "In particular, our analysis is built upon the original differential attack on SHA-0 [''sic''], the near collision attack on SHA-0, the multiblock collision techniques, as well as the message modification techniques used in the collision search attack on MD5. Breaking SHA-1 would not be possible without these powerful analytical techniques."<ref>[http://theory.csail.mit.edu/~yiqun/shanote.pdf MIT.edu], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]</ref> The authors have presented a collision for 58-round SHA-1, found with 2<sup>33</sup> hash operations. The paper with the full attack description was published in August 2005 at the CRYPTO conference. In an interview, Yin states that, "Roughly, we exploit the following two weaknesses: One is that the file preprocessing step is not complicated enough; another is that certain math operations in the first 20 rounds have unexpected security problems."<ref>[http://news.zdnet.com/2100-1009_22-5598536.html Fixing a hole in security | Tech News on ZDNet<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On 17 August 2005, an improvement on the SHA-1 attack was announced on behalf of Xiaoyun Wang, [[Andrew Yao]] and [[Frances Yao]] at the CRYPTO 2005 rump session, lowering the complexity required for finding a collision in SHA-1 to 2<sup>63</sup>.<ref>[http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/08/new_cryptanalyt.html Schneier on Security: New Cryptanalytic Results Against SHA-1<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On 18 December 2007 the details of this result were explained and verified by Martin Cochran.<ref>[http://eprint.iacr.org/2007/474 Notes on the Wang et al. $2^{63}$ SHA-1 Differential Path]</ref> Christophe De Cannière and Christian Rechberger further improved the attack on SHA-1 in "Finding SHA-1 Characteristics: General Results and Applications,"<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Christophe De Cannière, Christian Rechberger |date=2006-11-15 |title=Finding SHA-1 Characteristics: General Results and Applications |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/q42205u702p5604u/ }}</ref> receiving the Best Paper Award at [[ASIACRYPT]] 2006.

For informal verification, a package to generate a high number of test vectors is made available for download on the NIST site; the resulting verification however does not replace in any way the formal CMVP validation, which is required by law for certain applications. {{As of|2006|alt=As of October 2006}}, there are more than 500 validated implementations of SHA-1, with fewer than ten of them capable of handling messages with a length in bits not a multiple of eight (see [http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/shs/shaval.htm SHS Validation List]). ==Examples and pseudocode== ===Example hashes=== {{Main|Examples of SHA digests}} The following is an example of SHA-1 digests. [[ASCII]] encoding is assumed for all messages. SHA1("[[The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog]]") = 2fd4e1c6 7a2d28fc ed849ee1 bb76e739 1b93eb12 Even a small change in the message will, with overwhelming probability, result in a completely different hash due to the [[avalanche effect]]. For example, changing <code>dog</code> to <code>cog</code> produces a hash with different values for 81 of the 160 bits: SHA1("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy '''c'''og") = de9f2c7f d25e1b3a fad3e85a 0bd17d9b 100db4b3 ===SHA-1 pseudocode=== [[Pseudocode]] for the SHA-1 algorithm follows: <span style="color: green;">''Note 1: All variables are unsigned 32 bits and wrap modulo 2<sup>32</sup> when calculating''</span> <span style="color: green;">''Note 2: All constants in this pseudo code are in <u>big endian</u>.''</span> <span style="color: green;">''Within each word, the most significant byte is stored in the leftmost byte position''</span> <span style="color: green;">''Initialize variables:''</span> h0 = 0x67452301 h1 = 0xEFCDAB89 h2 = 0x98BADCFE h3 = 0x10325476 h4 = 0xC3D2E1F0 <span style="color: green;">''Pre-processing:''</span> append the bit '1' to the message append 0 ≤ k < 512 bits '0', so that the resulting message length (in ''bits'') is [[modular arithmetic|congruent]] to 448 ≡ −64 (mod 512) append length of message (before pre-processing), in ''bits'', as 64-bit [[Endianness|big-endian]] integer <span style="color: green;">''Process the message in successive 512-bit chunks:''</span> break message into 512-bit chunks '''for'''
