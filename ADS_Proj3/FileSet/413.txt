Much of his work is in [[computational geometry]], where he has found many of the best-known algorithms, such as [[linear-time]] [[Polygon triangulation|triangulation]] of a [[simple polygon]], as well as many useful complexity results, such as [[lower bound]] techniques based on [[discrepancy theory]]. He is also known for his invention of the [[soft heap]] data structure and the most [[asymptotically]] efficient known algorithm for finding [[minimum spanning tree]]s. Chazelle originally grew up in [[Paris, France]], where he received his bachelors degree and masters degree in [[applied mathematics]] at the [[Ecole des Mines de Paris]] in 1977. Then, at the age of 22, he came to [[Yale University]] in the United States, where he received his Ph.D. in computer science under the supervision of [[David P. Dobkin]]. He went on to claim important research positions at institutions such as [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon]], [[Brown University|Brown]], [[NEC Research Institute|NEC]], [[Xerox PARC]], and the Paris institutions [[Ecole Normale Supérieure]], [[Ecole Polytechnique]], and [[INRIA]]. As of 2004, he has 191 published articles, 93 of which are journal articles, and published two books. He has received 18 grants, 12 of which are from the [[National Science Foundation]]. He is a fellow of the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]], the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]], and [[NEC Research Institute|NEC]], as well as a member of the [[European Academy of Sciences]]. Chazelle has also written a few polemical essays, such as "Bush's Desolate Imperium" [http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chazelle/politics/bush-article.html] and "Anti-Americanism: A Clinical Study" [http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chazelle/politics/antiam.html], which draw from his life experience in both [[France]] and the [[United States]]. == References == *Bernard Chazelle, ''The Discrepancy Method: Randomness and Complexity'' (2001), ISBN 0-521-00357-1 *''Advances in Discrete and Computational Geometry'' (B.

A [[numerical stability|numerically stable]] way to evaluate polynomials in Bernstein form is [[de Casteljau's algorithm]]. Polynomials in Bernstein form were first used by Bernstein in a constructive proof for the [[Stone–Weierstrass theorem|Stone–Weierstrass approximation theorem]]. With the advent of computer graphics, Bernstein polynomials, restricted to the interval ''x'' ∈ [0, 1], became important in the form of [[Bézier curve]]s. ==Definition== The ''n'' + 1 '''Bernstein basis polynomials''' of degree ''n'' are defined as : <math>b_{\nu,n}(x) = {n \choose \nu} x^{\nu} \left( 1 - x \right)^{n - \nu}, \quad \nu = 0, \ldots, n.</math> where <math>{n \choose \nu}</math> is a [[binomial coefficient]]. The Bernstein basis polynomials of degree ''n'' form a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for the [[vector space]] &Pi;<sub>''n''</sub> of polynomials of degree ''n''. A linear combination of Bernstein basis polynomials :<math>B(x) = \sum_{\nu=0}^{n} \beta_{\nu} b_{\nu,n}(x)</math> is called a '''Bernstein polynomial''' or '''polynomial in Bernstein form''' of degree ''n''. The coefficients <math>\beta_\nu</math> are called '''Bernstein coefficients''' or '''Bézier coefficients'''. ==Example== The first few Bernstein basis polynomials are: : <math> \begin{align} b_{0,0}(x) & = 1, \\ b_{0,1}(x) & = 1 - x, & b_{1,1}(x) & = x \\ b_{0,2}(x) & = (1 - x)^2, & b_{1,2}(x) & = 2x(1 - x), & b_{2,2}(x) & = x^2 \\ b_{0,3}(x) & = (1 - x)^3, & b_{1,3}(x) & = 3x(1 - x)^2, & b_{2,3}(x) & = 3x^2(1 - x), & b_{3,3}(x) & = x^3 \\ b_{0,4}(x) & = (1 - x)^4, & b_{1,4}(x) & = 4x(1 - x)^3, & b_{2,4}(x) & = 6x^2(1 - x)^2, & b_{3,4}(x) & = 4x^3(1 - x), & b_{4,4}(x) & = x^4 \end{align} </math> ==Properties== The Bernstein basis polynomials have the following properties: * <math>b_{\nu, n}(x) = 0</math>, if <math>\nu < 0</math> or <math>\nu > n</math>. * <math>b_{\nu, n}(0) = \delta_{\nu, 0}</math> and <math>b_{\nu, n}(1) = \delta_{\nu, n}</math> where <math>\delta</math> is the [[Kronecker delta]] function. * <math>b_{\nu, n}(x)</math> has a root with multiplicity <math>\nu</math> at point <math>x = 0</math> (note: if <math>\nu = 0</math>, there is no root at 0). * <math>b_{\nu, n}(x)</math> has a root with multiplicity <math>\left( n - \nu \right)</math> at point <math>x = 1</math> (note: if <math>\nu = n</math>, there is no root at 1). * <math>b_{\nu, n}(x) \ge 0</math> for <math>x \in [0,\ 1]</math>. * <math>b_{\nu, n}\left( 1 - x \right) = b_{n - \nu, n}(x)</math>. * The [[derivative]] can be written as a combination of two polynomials of lower degree: *: <math>b'_{\nu, n}(x) = n \left( b_{\nu - 1, n - 1}(x) - b_{\nu, n - 1}(x) \right).</math> * If <math>n \ne 0</math>, then <math>b_{\nu, n}(x)</math> has a unique local maximum on the interval <math>[0,\ 1]</math> at <math>x = \frac{\nu}{n}</math>. This maximum takes the value: *: <math>\nu^\nu n^{-n} \left( n - \nu \right)^{n - \nu} {n \choose \nu}.</math> * The Bernstein basis polynomials of degree <math>n</math> form a [[partition of unity]]: *: <math>\sum_{\nu = 0}^n b_{\nu, n}(x) = \sum_{\nu = 0}^n {n \choose \nu} x^\nu \left( 1 - x \right)^{n - \nu} = \left(x + \left( 1 - x \right) \right)^n = 1.</math> * A Bernstein polynomial can always be written as a linear combination of polynomials of higher degree: *: <math>b_{\nu, n - 1}(x) = \frac{n - \nu}{n} b_{\nu, n}(x) + \frac{\nu + 1}{n} b_{\nu +
