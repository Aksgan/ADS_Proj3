Notice the "Manage Opt-In settings" link). Applications other than web-browsers cannot be opted out of the scheme using cookies as the opt-out targets only the [[HTTP]] protocol, when the scheme is actually implemented in the protocol-neutral DNS protocol. ==Response== In the UK, the Information Commissioner's Office have acknowledged that the practice of involuntary DNS hijacking contravenes PECR, and EC Directive 95/46 on Data Protection which require explicit consent for processing of communication traffic. However they have refused to intervene, claiming that it would not be "sensible" to enforce the law because "it would not cause significant (or indeed any) demonstrable detriment to individuals".{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} [[ICANN]], the international body responsible for administering toplevel domain names, has published a memorandum highlighting its concerns, and affirming:<ref name="ICANN"/> {{quote|"ICANN strongly discourages the use of DNS redirection, wildcards, synthesized responses and any other form of NXDOMAIN substitution in existing gTLDs, ccTLDs and any other level in the DNS tree for registry-class domain names."}} ==See also== * [[Domain hijacking]] * [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol]] * [[Point-to-Point Protocol]] * [[Pharming]] * [[Phishing]] ==References== {{Reflist}} {{Use dmy dates|date=January 2011}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Dns Hijacking}} [[Category:Domain name system]] [[Category:Internet fraud]] [[Category:Hacking (computer security)]] [[Category:Ethics of science and technology]] [[Category:Internet privacy]] [[Category:Internet standards]] [[de:DNS-Hijacking]] [[fr:Manipulation de l'espace des noms de domaine]]</text> </page> <page> <id>9055</id> <title>DOD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Program</title> <text>'''DOD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Program''', or '''DIACAP''', is the [[United States Department of Defense]] [[Information assurance|Information Assurance]] Certification and Accreditation Program.

DRDA describes the architecture for [[Distributed computing|distributed]] data. It defines the rules for accessing the distributed data, but it does not provide the actual [[Application programming interface|application programming interfaces]] (APIs) to perform the [[data access|access]]. It was first used in DB2 2.3. ==Components== * Application Requester (AR). The AR accepts [[SQL]] requests from an application and sends them to the appropriate application servers for processing. Using this function, application programs can access remote data. * Application Server (AS). The AS receives requests from application requesters and processes them. The AS acts upon the portions that can be processed and forwards the remainder to database servers for subsequent processing. The AR and the AS communicate through a [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] called the ''Application Support Protocol'' which handles [[Data conversion|data representation conversion]]. * Database Server (DS). The DS receives requests from AS or other DS servers. The DS supports distributed requests and will forward parts of the request to collaborating DS in order to fulfill the request. The AS and the DS among themselves communicate through a [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] called the ''Database Support Protocol''. ==Databases supporting DRDA== * [[Apache Derby|Apache Derby (Java RDBMS)]] * [[IBM DB2|DB2]] * [[IBM Informix Dynamic Server|Informix Dynamic Server]] v11.10 * [http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/gateways/tg4drda.html Oracle Transparent Gateway for IBM DRDA] ==External links== * [http://www.opengroup.org/dbiop/ The OpenGroup - DRDA Protocol description] * [http://www.craigsmullins.com/drda.htm Article on DRDA by Craig Mullins] * [http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg244249.html IBM Redbook: SG24-4249, Chapter 5.

DVD Player was introduced in [[Windows 98]]<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/archive/win98/reskit/part2/wrkc12.mspx?mfr=true Windows 98 Multimedia]</ref>. When the DVD Player is launched, it searches all local drives in alphabetical order, starting with the C drive, looking for a Video_TS folder. When this folder is located, the data file within it is loaded, and video streaming begins. If this folder exists on a drive that comes before the DVD drive, the player will try to play the data in the first folder it finds. In Windows 98/Me and Windows 2000, DVDPlay.exe only plays DVDs if a hardware-based decoder is present. In [[Windows Me]], DVDPlay supports software-based decoders.<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/272985 Description of DVD Player in Windows Millennium Edition]</ref>. With Windows XP, DVDPlay.exe was dropped as a separate application in favor of DVD functionality introduced into [[Windows Media Player]]. While the DVDPlay executable still resides in %Windir%system32, it simply executes [[Windows Media Player]], but the Windows 2000 version can run on Windows XP/Vista/7 (With bugs). ==References== <references/> {{Windows Components}} {{Media player (application software)}} [[Category:Discontinued Microsoft software]] [[Category:Discontinued Windows components]] [[Category:Microsoft software]] [[Category:Microsoft Windows multimedia technology]] [[Category:Windows media players]] {{windows-stub}} [[it:DVD Player (Windows)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>9119</id> <title>DYNAMO (programming language)</title> <text>'''DYNAMO''' ('''DYNAmic MOdels''') was a [[simulation language]] and accompanying graphical notation developed within the [[system dynamics]] analytical framework.
