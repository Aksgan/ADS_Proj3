outlook. Since 2000 this has materialised in architecture through concerns with the rapid rise of urbanism and [[globalization]], but also a pragmatic understanding that the city can no longer be a homogenous totality. Interests in fragmentation and architecture as transient objects further such thinking (e.g. the concern for employing high technology). And yet this can also be tied into general concerns such as [[ecology]], [[mass media]], and economism. In the past decade, there has been a resurgence of the old "organic design" theories, but in a much more scientific setting. Several currents and design methodologies are being developed simultaneously, and some of these reinforce whereas others contrast with each other. One of these trends is [[Biomimicry]], which is the explicit copying of forms and structures found in biological organisms for buildings. Architects design organic-looking buildings in the belief that by copying nature, [[Organic architecture]] reaches a more attractive form. Another trend is the exploration of computational techniques, which are strongly influenced by algorithms relevant to biological processes. Trying to utilize [[Computational creativity]] in architecture, [[Genetic algorithms]] developed in computer science are applied to evolve designs on a computer, and some of these are proposed and built as actual structures. There exists, however, a controversy as to whether all such evolved designs through [[Design computing]] are truly appropriate for buildings, or are merely attractive forms that may be too complex for habitation. The new discipline of [[Biophilia]] developed by [[E. O. Wilson]] suggests the advantages of forms inspired by biological structures, but in a more profound way than simple mimicry. Wilson's original idea is extended by Stephen R. Kellert in the [[Biophilia hypothesis]], and applied to architectural design in the book "Biophilic Design". Mathematical features of biological forms such as [[fractals]], [[Scale-invariance]], very sophisticated notions of [[symmetry]], [[Self-similarity]], and complex [[Hierarchy]] are proposed as essential tools for designing architectural forms. Trying to understand the complex interaction between humans and their environment gained from [[Human-computer interaction]], [[Mobile robotics]], and [[Artificial intelligence]] leads to ideas in [[Intelligence-Based Design]]. We are witnessing a growth of new ideas that are generating an entirely new type of architectural theory. It bears little resemblance to the dominant school of architectural theory based on linguistic analysis, philosophy, post-structuralism, or cultural theory. ==Some architectural theorists== {{Col-begin}} {{Col-1-of-3}} Historical *[[Vitruvius]] *[[Leon Battista Alberti]] *[[Andrea Palladio]] *[[Sebastiano Serlio]] *[[John Ruskin]] *[[Horatio Greenough]] *[[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]] *[[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]] *[[Gottfried Semper]] *[[Hans Auer]] *[[Paul Sédille]] *[[Constantin Lipsius]] *[[Richard Streiter]] *[[Hermann Muthesius]] {{Col-2-of-3}} Modern *[[Bruno Zevi]] *[[Leonardo Benevolo]] *[[Steen Eiler Rasmussen]] *[[Otto Wagner]] *[[Le Corbusier]] *[[Adolf Loos]] *[[Raymond Unwin]] *[[William Pereira]] *[[Ebenezer Howard]] *[[Christian Norberg-Schulz]] *[[Rudolf Arnheim]] *[[Lúcio Costa]] Postmodern *[[Charles Jencks]] *[[Aldo Rossi]] *[[Demetri Porphyrios]] *[[Peter Eisenman]] *[[Robert Venturi]] {{Col-3-of-3}} Contemporary *[[Kenneth Frampton]] *[[Christopher Alexander]] *[[Stan Allen]] *[[Marco Frascari]] *[[K.

Existing (or ''legacy'') software has been one of biggest obstacles for adoption of the modeling approach. With some irony, the acronym for Architecture-Driven Modernization, ADM looks like ''MDA in reverse'', where MDA is the acronym for OMG's Model-Driven Architecture, or using modeling to deliver new software. ADM is related to the concept of [[reverse engineering]]. [[Software modernization]] is ''architecture-driven'' when there is the need to capture and retool various architectural aspects of existing application environments. This does not preclude source-to-source migrations (where appropriate), but encourages user organizations to consider modernization from an analysis and design based perspective. In doing so, project teams will ensure that obsolete concepts or designs are not propagated into modern languages and platforms. The bottom-line results deliver modernized systems that conform more effectively to current business practices and strategic requirements.<ref>{{cite book|author=Object Management group | title=Second Architecture-Driven Modernization workshop| url= http://www.omg.org/news/releases/pr2005/08-30-05.htm|date=October 24, 2005}}</ref> == History of ADM == * In June 2003, The Object Management Group (OMG) formed a Task Force to modeling in the context of existing software systems. Initially, the group was called Legacy Transformation Task Force, but then the name was unanimously changed to Architecture-Driven Modernization Task Force (ADM). ADMTF is co-chaired by Djenana Campara, from KDM Analytics and William Ulrich, from Tactical Strategy Group.<ref>{{cite book| author=Object management Group| title=Why do we need standards for the modernization of existing systems| url= http://www.kdmanalytics.com/kdm/ADM_whitepaper.pdf|[[Object Management Group]]|date=July 15, 2003}}</ref> * In November 2003, the OMG's Architecture-Driven Modernization Task Force recommended, and the Platform Technical Committee issued,
