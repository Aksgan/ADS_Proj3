The PDF is commonly tracked by using Lagrangian particle methods; when combined with large eddy simulation, this leads to a [[Langevin equation]] for subfiler particle evolution. ====Vortex method==== The Vortex method is a grid-free technique for the simulation of turbulent flows. It uses vortices as the computational elements, mimicking the physical structures in turbulence. Vortex methods were developed as a grid-free methodology that would not be limited by the fundamental smoothing effects associated with grid-based methods. To be practical, however, vortex methods require means for rapidly computing velocities from the vortex elements – in other words they require the solution to a particular form of the [[N-body problem]] (in which the motion of N objects is tied to their mutual influences). A breakthrough came in the late 1980s with the development of the [[Fast Multipole Method]] (FMM), an algorithm by V. Rokhlin (Yale) and L. Greengard (Courant Institute) that has been heralded{{by whom|date=November 2010}} as one of the top ten advances in numerical science of the 20th century. This breakthrough paved the way to practical computation of the velocities from the vortex elements and is the basis of successful algorithms. Software based on the Vortex method offer a new means for solving tough fluid dynamics problems with minimal user intervention.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} All that is required is specification of problem geometry and setting of boundary and initial conditions. Among the significant advantages of this modern technology; * It is practically grid-free, thus eliminating numerous iterations associated with RANS and LES. * All problems are treated identically. No modeling or calibration inputs are required. * Time-series simulations, which are crucial for correct analysis of acoustics, are possible. * The small scale and large scale are accurately simulated at the same time. ====Vorticity Confinement method==== {{Main|Vorticity confinement}} The [[Vorticity confinement]] (VC) method is an Eulerian technique used in the simulation of turbulent wakes. It uses a solitary-wave like approach to produce stable solution with no numerical spreading. VC can capture the small scale features to over as few as 2 grid cells. Within these features, a nonlinear difference equation is solved as opposed to the [[finite difference equation]]. VC is similar to [[shock capturing methods]], where conservation laws are satisfied, so that the essential integral quantities are accurately computed. ===Two phase flow=== The modeling of [[two-phase flow]] is still under development. Different methods have been proposed {{by whom|date=November 2010}}. The [[Volume of fluid method]] has received a lot of attention lately,{{by whom|date=November 2010}} for problems that do not have dispersed particles,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} but the [[Level set method]] and [[front tracking]] are also valuable approaches {{Whom?|date=November 2010}}. Most of these methods are either good in maintaining a sharp interface or at conserving mass {{Whom?|date=November 2010}}. This is crucial since the evaluation of the density, viscosity and surface tension is based on the values averaged over the interface.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Lagrangian multiphase models, which are used for dispersed media, are based on solving the Lagrangian equation of motion for the dispersed phase.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} ===Solution algorithms=== Discretization in space produces a system of [[ordinary differential equations]] for unsteady problems and algebraic equations for steady problems. Implicit or semi-implicit methods are generally used to integrate the ordinary differential equations, producing a system of (usually) nonlinear algebraic equations. Applying a [[Newton's method#Nonlinear systems of equations|Newton]] or [[Fixed point iteration|Picard]] iteration produces a system of linear equations which is nonsymmetric in the presence of advection and indefinite in the presence of incompressibility. Such systems, particularly in 3D, are frequently too large for direct solvers, so iterative methods are used, either stationary methods such as [[Successive over-relaxation|successive overrelaxation]] or [[Krylov subspace]] methods. Krylov methods such as [[Generalized minimal residual method|GMRES]], typically used with [[Preconditioner|preconditioning]], operate by minimizing the residual over successive subspaces generated by the preconditioned operator. [[Multigrid method|Multigrid]] is especially popular {{editorializing?|date=November 2010}}, both as a solver and as a preconditioner, due to its asymptotically optimal performance on many problems. Traditional{{Whom?|date=November 2010}} solvers and preconditioners are effective at reducing high-frequency components of the residual, but low-frequency components typically require many iterations to reduce. By operating on multiple scales, multigrid reduces all components of the residual by similar factors, leading to a mesh-independent number of iterations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} For indefinite systems, preconditioners such as [[incomplete LU factorization]], [[Additive Schwarz method|additive Schwarz]], and [[Multigrid method|multigrid]] perform poorly or fail entirely, so the problem structure must be used for effective preconditioning.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Benzi, Golub, Liesen | title=Numerical solution of saddle-point problems | journal=Acta Numerica | year=2005 | doi=10.1017/S0962492904000212}}</ref> The traditional{{Whom?|date=November 2010}} methods commonly used in CFD are the [[SIMPLE algorithm|SIMPLE]] and Uzawa algorithms which exhibit mesh-dependent convergence rates, but recent advances based on block LU factorization combined with multigrid for the resulting definite systems have led to preconditioners that deliver mesh-independent convergence rates.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Elman et al. | title=A taxonomy and comparison of parallel block multi-level preconditioners for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations | journal=Journal of Computational Physics | volume=227 | issue=3 | month=January | year=2008 | doi=10.1016/j.jcp.2007.09.026}}</ref> == See also == * [[Blade element theory]] * [[Finite element analysis]] * [[Immersed boundary method]] * [[List of finite element software packages]] * [[Multidisciplinary design optimization]] * [[Turbulence modeling]] * [[Visualization (graphic)|Visualization]] * [[Wind tunnel]] ==Notes== {{reflist}} == References == *{{Citation | last = Anderson | first = John D. | title = Computational Fluid Dynamics: The Basics With Applications | publisher = McGraw-Hill Science | series = Science/Engineering/Math | year = 1995
