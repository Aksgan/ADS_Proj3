"Guest Passes" are allocated to a user when he or she purchases an applicable game. The user can then share the passes with others who have not purchased the game, allowing the new user to play the game for a limited time (which varies depending on the game). Once an activated guest pass expires, the recipient will be prompted to purchase the game in order to continue playing. The number of guest passes available to a game purchaser is determined on a game-by-game basis, and they expire one month after being granted if not used.<ref name="guestpasssupport">{{Cite web|url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?p_faqid=549|title=Gifts and Guest Passes|publisher=Valve Corporation|accessdate=October 27, 2008}}</ref> "Free Weekends" are multi-player promotions in which a game becomes free to play on Steam for a weekend. When the promotion ends, the game files remain on the participating users' computers, but they are barred from playing further until they purchase the game. Valve runs the subscription-based Valve Cyber Café Program,<ref name="cybercafehome">{{Cite web|url=https://cafe.steampowered.com/|title=Valve Cyber Café Program|publisher=Valve Corporation|accessdate=November 7, 2007}}</ref> which is the only legal way for a cyber café to offer Steam-based games. From December 6 to December 20, 2010, Steam had an ongoing "multi-game game" called "The Great Steam Treasure Hunt", where various objectives, both in Steam itself and in numerous games, where presented for a day, and the completion of ten or more gave the user a chance to win 100 free games at the end of it, as well as ongoing chances for users to win the top five games in their wish lists. ===Hardware promotions=== Steam keeps a record of the hardware in the computer it is running on for various purposes, one of which is enabling hardware manufacturers to run after-sale promotions directly to their customers. Both [[AMD]]'s ATi and [[nVidia]] use this feature: owners of ATi's [[Radeon]] video cards receive ''[[Half-Life 2: Lost Coast]]'' and ''[[Half-Life 2: Deathmatch]]'', as well as a discount on ''[[Half-Life 2]]'',<ref name="ati_offer1a">{{Cite web|url=http://steamgames.com/ati_offer1a/|title=ATi Steam Offer|publisher=Valve Corporation|date=May 30, 2007|accessdate=June 4, 2007}}</ref> while owners of nVidia's [[GeForce]] video cards receive ''Half-Life 2: Deathmatch'', ''Half-Life 2: Lost Coast'', ''Portal: First Slice'' and ''[[Peggle Extreme]]''.<ref name="nvidia_offer1a">{{Cite web|url=http://www.valvesoftware.com/news.php?id=1398|title=Portal: The First Slice for NVIDIA owners|publisher=Valve Corporation|accessdate=2008-01-11}}</ref> <!-- AMD no longer offers this service, need someone to check nVidia | Both companies now distribute Steam installers as part of their driver and software installations.<ref name="ati_offer1b">{{cite web|url=http://ati.amd.com/buy/promotions/lostcoast/index.html|title=ATi Steam Promotion|work=ATi Technologies homepage|accessdate=2007-06-05}}</ref><ref name="nvidia_offer1a" />--> ==History== ===Beginnings=== <div class="floatright"> <timeline> ImageSize = width:220 height:450 PlotArea = left:50 bottom:10 top:10 right:0 DateFormat = yyyy Period = from:2002 till:2011 TimeAxis = orientation:vertical order:reverse ScaleMajor = unit:year increment:1 start:2002 ScaleMinor = unit:year increment:1 start:2002 Colors = id:blue value:rgb(0,0,0) id:red value:rgb(0.9,0.05,0.05) Define $dx = 25 Define $up = shift:($dx,1) Define $dw = shift:($dx,-8) PlotData= bar:Games anchor:till color:red width:15 textcolor:blue align:left fontsize:S mark:(line,white) shift:($dx,-4) from:2002 till:2011 at:2002 shift:($dx,-20) text:"Revealed to public" at:2002 shift:($dx,-35) text:"Beta period begins" at:2003 shift:($dx,-40) text:"Official release" at:2004 shift:($dx,-40) text:"[[Half-Life 2]] release" at:2005 shift:($dx,-40) text:"First publisher partnership" at:2006 at:2007 shift:($dx,-35) text:"Steam Community launched" at:2008 shift:($dx,-15) text:"Steamworks released" at:2008 shift:($dx,-40) text:"Matchmaking released" at:2009 shift:($dx,-15) text:"Steam Cloud released" at:2010 shift:($dx,-15) text:"UI Update Released" at:2010 shift:($dx,-30) text:"[[Mac OS X]] Client released"
