It followed a 1991 series of [[Reith Lectures]] by Jones with the same title.<ref name=Reith>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/reith/historic_audio/reith_historic.shtml BBC website] Historic Reith Lectures</ref> The book introduces all different aspects of genetics and [[molecular biology]], and the new editions contain information about the frontiers of the field, such as the [[Human Genome Project]]. The first edition was published in 1993 and won the [[Rh√¥ne-Poulenc Prize]] (now known as the [[Royal Society Prizes for Science Books]])<ref>[http://royalsociety.org/bookspage.asp?id=6372 Prizes for Science Books previous winners and shortlists], The Royal Society website</ref>. The title of the book is partly the result of Jones' regular use of a [[metaphor]] of [[nucleotide]]s as [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]], [[codon]]s as [[word]]s and [[gene]]s as [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s, but also reflecting Jones' short explanation of [[language]]'s role in [[human]] evolution. A second revised and expanded edition (ISBN 0-006-55243-9) was published by [[Flamingo (imprint)|Flamingo]] on 18 September 2000. ==See also== [[Language gene]] ==References== <references/> {{DEFAULTSORT:Language of the Genes}} [[Category:1993 books]] [[Category:Science books]] [[category:Genetics books]] [[Category:Cognitive science literature]] [[tr:Genlerin Dili]]</text> </page> <page> <id>37368</id> <title>The Magic Words are Squeamish Ossifrage</title> <text>The text "'''The Magic Words are Squeamish Ossifrage'''" was the solution to a challenge [[ciphertext]] posed by the inventors of the [[RSA]] [[cipher]] in 1977. The problem appeared in [[Martin Gardner]]'s ''[[Mathematical Games]]'' column in ''[[Scientific American]]''. It was solved in 1993&ndash;1994 by a large joint computer project co-ordinated by [[Derek Atkins]], [[Michael Graff]], [[Arjen Lenstra]] and [[Paul Leyland]]. More than 600 volunteers contributed [[Central processing unit|CPU]] time from about 1,600 machines (two of which were [[fax]] machines) over six months. The coordination was done via the [[Internet]] and was one of the first such projects. Ossifrage is an older name for the [[lammergeier]], a scavenging vulture that is famous for dropping animal bones and live tortoises onto rocks to crack them open. It might perhaps be considered among the least squeamish of creatures. The 1993-1994 effort began the tradition of using the words "squeamish ossifrage" in [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalytic]] challenges. The difficulty of breaking the RSA cipher &mdash; recovering a [[plaintext]] message given a ciphertext and the public key &mdash; is connected to the difficulty of [[integer factorization|factoring]] large numbers. While it is not known if the two problems are mathematically equivalent, factoring is currently the only method of directly breaking RSA. The [[decryption]] of the 1977 ciphertext involved the factoring of a 129-digit number, [[RSA-129]], in order to recover the [[plaintext]]. [[Ron Rivest]] estimated in 1977 that factoring a 125-digit number would require 40 [[1000000000000000 (number)|quadrillion]] years, even with the highly conservative assumption that [[modular multiplication]] could be carried out in a [[nanosecond]]; he therefore then believed that RSA-129 could never be broken in practice. What he failed to take into account was the possibility of progress in factoring [[algorithm]]s, and a lot of progress was made in the following decades. Atkins et al. used the [[quadratic sieve]] algorithm invented by [[Carl Pomerance]] in 1981. While the asymptotically faster [[number field sieve]] had just been invented, it was not clear at the time that it would be better than the quadratic sieve for 129-digit numbers. The memory requirements of the newer algorithm were also a concern. There was a US$100 prize associated with the challenge, which the winners donated to the [[Free Software Foundation]]. ==In popular culture== In the anime ''[[Summer Wars]]'', the encrypted text whose decryption leads to the hacking of OZ begins with the words "The magic words are squeamish ossifrage." ==See also== * [[Brute force attack]] * [[Distributed.net]] * [[RSA numbers]] ==External links== * [http://web.mit.edu/warlord/www/rsa129.ps Technical paper on Derek Atkins' Web site] (postscript file) [[Category:History of cryptography|Magic Words are Squeamish Ossifrage]] [[es:The Magic Words are Squeamish Ossifrage]]</text> </page> <page> <id>37374</id> <title>The Map Library</title> <text>{{MapLibrary|Congo sat.png|Republic of Congo}} :''The Map Library should not be confused with the [[Map Library]] of [[The British Museum]].'' {{Unreferenced|date=November 2010}} '''''The Map Library''''' is a project of '''The Map Maker Trust''' [[Charitable organization|charity]], and supported by '''Map Maker Ltd.''', for the supplying of free [[GIS]] data. The project website also hosts free conversion software for [[raster graphics|raster]] and [[vector graphics|vector]] files. As of November 2008, the only data sets available were for the continents of [[Africa]] and [[Central America]]. == Statement of purpose == From the website... :''The idea behind the Map Library is that the lack of good, simple maps is a serious obstacle to development in all kinds of fields, from health care to urban management, from de-mining to environmental protection. The library's purpose is two fold: to make public domain mapping data more readily available for developing countries, and to provide free, easy to use software to facilitate map making by non-experts. The Map Library delivers data and software both on the internet and by post on CD for those with poor or no internet access.'' == Data format and conversion == The project data is managed in part by two pieces of software, each supporting different file formats and conversions. * '''''Raster Converter''''' handles [[ECW (file format)|ECW]] files: these can be converted to [[BMP file format|BMP]], [[TIFF]], and with external libraries, [[JPEG]], and [[JPEG 2000]]. * '''''Vector Converter'''''
