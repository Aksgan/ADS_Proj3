new technologies more easily. *'''New [[Unix]] features''' — New versions of [[cp (Unix)|cp]], [[mv]], and [[rsync]] which support files with [[resource fork]]s. Command-line support for features like the above-mentioned Spotlight are also included. *'''[[Xcode|Xcode 2.0]]''' — Xcode 2.0, Apple’s Cocoa development tool now includes visual modelling, an integrated [[Apple Reference Library]] and graphical remote [[debugging]]. ===New applications in Tiger=== *[[Automator (software)|Automator]] — Automator uses workflows to process repetitive tasks automatically *[[Grapher]] — Grapher is a new application capable of creating 2D and 3D graphs similar to that of [[NuCalc|Graphing Calculator]]. *[[Dictionary (software)|Dictionary]] — A dictionary and thesaurus program which uses the [[New Oxford American Dictionary]]. It has a fast GUI for displaying the Dictionary, and allows the user to search the dictionary with Spotlight, to print definitions, and to copy and paste text into documents. Dictionary also provides a Dictionary service in the Application menu, and Cocoa and [[WebKit]] provides a global keyboard shortcut (ctrl-⌘-D by default) for all applications that display text with them. Its use was furthered in the [[Mac OS X Leopard|next version of OS X]] by providing definitions from [[Wikipedia]]. The Dictionary application is a more feature-filled version of the Dictionary widget. *[[Quartz Composer]] — Quartz Composer is a development tool for processing and rendering graphical data. *[[Apple Developer Tools#Audio Unit Lab|AU Lab]] — AU Lab is a developer application for testing and mixing [[Audio Units]]. *[[Dashboard (software)|Dashboard]] — Dashboard is a [[widget engine|widget]] application. Tiger widgets include: a calculator, dictionary, a world clock, a calendar, and more ([[Dashboard (software)#Included widgets|full list]]). A user can also download and install more widgets, including one for the [http://wikipedia-widget.en.softonic.com/Wikipedia Wikipedia encyclopedia]. ==Improvements== *An upgraded [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] with optimized kernel resource locking and [[access control list]]s, and with support for [[64-bit]] [[user space|userland]] [[address space]]s on machines with 64-bit processors.<ref name=64bit>{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/macosx-10-4.ars/4|title=Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger|pages=4|author=John Siracusa|date=28 April 2005| work=ArsTechnica.com|accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref> *An updated libSystem with both 32-bit and 64-bit versions; combined with the aforementioned kernel change, this allows individual applications to address more than 4 GB of memory when run on 64-bit processors, although an application using Apple libraries or frameworks other than libSystem would need to have two processes, one running the 64-bit code and one running the code that requires other libraries and frameworks.<ref name=64bit/><ref>{{cite web|url= http://developer.apple.com/macosx/64bit.html|title=Developing 64-bit applications|author=Apple|date =6 March 2006|work=Apple Developer Connection|accessdate=2007-03-05}}</ref> *A new startup [[daemon (computer software)|daemon]] called [[launchd]] that allows for faster boots. *The printing dialog in Tiger now features a drop down menu for creating [[PDF]]s, sending PDFs to Mail, and other PDF related actions. However, the user interface has been criticized for creating a hybrid [[widget (computing)|widget]] that looks like a plain button but acts like a pop-up menu. This is one of only three places in the entire Mac OS X interface where such an element appears. *Dock menus now have menu items to open an application at login, or to remove the icon from the dock. *The Window menu in the Finder now features a "Cycle Through Windows" menu item. *The Get Info window for items in the Finder now includes a "More Info" section that includes Spotlight information tags such as Image Height & Width, when the file was last opened, and where the file originated. *Early development of resolution independence. Apple notes that this will be a user-level feature in a future version of Mac OS X.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://developer.apple.com/releasenotes/GraphicsImaging/RN-ResolutionIndependentUI/|title=Resolution Independent UI|publisher=Apple Developer Connection|accessdate=2006-07-10}}</ref> Among the changes, the maximum size of icons has been increased to 256x256. However, the Finder does not yet support this size. ===Technologies=== *A new graphics processing [[application programming interface|API]], [[Core Image]], leveraging the power of the available accelerated graphics cards. ::Core Image allows programmers to easily leverage programmable GPUs for fast image processing for special effects and image correction tools. Some of the included Image Units included are Blur, Color Blending, Generator Filters, Distortion Filters, Geometry Filters, Halftone features and much more. *A new data persistence API, [[Core Data]], that makes it easier for developers to handle structured data in their applications. ::The Mac OS X [[Core Data]] API helps developers create data structures for their applications. Core Data provides undo, redo and save functions for developers without them having to write any code. *A new video graphics API, [[Core Video]], which leverages Core Image to provide real-time video processing. ::Apple’s [[Apple Motion|Motion]] real-time video effects program takes advantage of [[Core Video]] in Tiger. Core Video lets developers easily integrate real-time video effects and processing into their applications. *[[Core Audio]] integrates a range of audio functionality directly into the operating system. ===Interface differences=== In every major new revision of Mac OS X, Apple alters the [[graphical user interface]] somewhat. In Tiger the menu bar displayed at the top of the screen now features a colored Spotlight button in the upper right corner; the menu itself has a smoother '[[glass]]y' texture to replace the faint pinstripes in Panther. Also of note, Tiger introduces a new window theme, often described as ‘Unified’. A variation on the standard, non-brushed metal theme used since the introduction of Mac OS X, this theme integrates the title bar and the toolbar of a window. A prominent example of an application that utilizes this theme is [[Mail (application)|Mail]]. ==Tiger trademark lawsuit== Shortly before the release of Mac OS X Tiger, the computer retailer [[TigerDirect.com|TigerDirect.com, Inc.]] filed a lawsuit against Apple, alleging that Apple infringed TigerDirect.com’s trademark with the Mac OS X ''Tiger'' operating system.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/05/04/28/apple_sued_over_tiger_injunction_sought.html| title=Apple sued over "Tiger," injunction sought|author=AppleInsider Staff|date=28 April 2005| publisher=AppleInsider|accessdate=2006-07-10}}</ref> The following is a quotation from TigerDirect.com’s court memorandum: :''Apple Computer’s use of its infringing family of Tiger marks to expand sales of products besides its operating system software is already evident — for example, Apple Computer is offering free iPods and laptops as part of its Tiger World Premiere giveaway. In short, notwithstanding its representation to the PTO that it would only use Tiger in connection with their unique computer operating system software, Apple Computer has in recent weeks used a family of Tiger marks
