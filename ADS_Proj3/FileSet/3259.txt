but these do not support [[dynamic dispatch]] * [[recursive type]]s * encapsulated state * [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)]] * [[Record (computer science)|records]] are basis for understanding objects if [[function literal]]s can be stored in fields (like in functional programming languages), but the actual calculi need be considerably more complex to incorporate essential features of OOP. Several extensions of [[System F-sub|System F<sub><:</sub>]] that deal with mutable objects have been studied;<ref name="AbadiCardelli"/> these allow both [[subtype polymorphism]] and [[parametric polymorphism]] (generics) Attempts to find a consensus definition or theory behind objects have not proven very successful (however, see Abadi & Cardelli, [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=547964&dl=ACM&coll=portal ''A Theory of Objects'']<ref name="AbadiCardelli">{{Cite book| first=Martin| last=Abadi |title=A Theory of Objects| url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=547964&dl=ACM&coll=portal| year=1996| accessdate=2010-04-21| isbn = 0387947752| publisher = Springer-Verlag New York, Inc.| authorlink=Martin Abadi| coauthors=Cardelli, Luca}}</ref> for formal definitions of many OOP concepts and constructs), and often diverge widely. For example, some definitions focus on mental activities, and some on mere program structuring. One of the simpler definitions is that OOP is the act of using "map" data structures or arrays that can contain functions and pointers to other maps, all with some syntactic and scoping sugar on top. Inheritance can be performed by cloning the maps (sometimes called "prototyping"). OBJECT:=>> Objects are the run time entities in an object-oriented system. They may represent a person, a place, a bank account, a table of data or any item that the program has to handle. ==OOP languages== {{Unreferenced section|date=August 2009}} {{See also|List of object-oriented programming languages}} [[Simula]] (1967) is generally accepted as the first language to have the primary features of an object-oriented language. It was created for making [[Computer simulation|simulation program]]s, in which what came to be called objects were the most important information representation. [[Smalltalk]] (1972 to 1980) is arguably the canonical example, and the one with which much of the theory of object-oriented programming was developed. Concerning the degree of object orientation, following distinction can be made: * Languages called "pure" OO languages, because everything in them is treated consistently as an object, from primitives such as characters and punctuation, all the way up to whole classes, prototypes, blocks, modules, etc. They were designed specifically to facilitate, even enforce, OO methods. Examples: [[Smalltalk | Smalltalk]], [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[JADE (programming language)|JADE]]. * Languages designed mainly for OO programming, but with some procedural elements. Examples: [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]],[[Scala(programming language)| Scala]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]]. * Languages that are historically [[Procedural programming|procedural languages]], but have been extended with some OO features. Examples: [[VB.NET]] (derived from VB), [[Fortran 2003]], [[Perl]], [[COBOL]] 2002, [[PHP]], [[ABAP]]. * Languages with most of the features of objects (classes, methods, inheritance, reusability), but in a distinctly original form. Examples: [[Oberon (programming language)|Oberon]] (Oberon-1 or Oberon-2). * Languages with [[abstract data type]] support, but not all features of object-orientation, sometimes called object-''based'' languages. Examples: [[Modula-2]] (with excellent encapsulation and information hiding), [[Pliant]], [[CLU (programming language)|CLU]]. ===OOP in dynamic languages=== In recent years, object-oriented programming has become especially popular in [[dynamic programming language]]s. [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] and [[Groovy (programming language)|Groovy]] are dynamic languages built on OOP principles, while [[Perl]] and [[PHP]] have been adding object oriented features since Perl 5 and PHP 4, and [[ColdFusion]] since version 6. The [[Document Object Model]] of [[HTML]], [[XHTML]], and [[XML]] documents on the Internet have bindings to the popular [[JavaScript]]/[[ECMAScript]] language. JavaScript is perhaps the best known [[prototype-based programming]] language, which employs cloning from prototypes rather than inheriting from a class. Another scripting language that takes this approach is [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]]. Earlier versions of [[ActionScript]] (a partial superset of the ECMA-262 R3, otherwise known as ECMAScript) also used a prototype-based object model. Later versions of ActionScript incorporate a combination of classification and prototype-based object models based largely on the currently incomplete ECMA-262 R4 specification, which has its roots in an early JavaScript 2 Proposal. Microsoft's JScript.NET also includes a mash-up of object models based on the same proposal, and is also a superset of the ECMA-262 R3 specification. ==Design patterns== Challenges of object-oriented design are addressed by several methodologies. Most common is known as the [[Design Patterns (book)|design patterns codified by Gamma ''et al.'']]. More broadly, the term "[[design pattern (computer science)|design patterns]]" can be used to refer to any general, repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. Some of these commonly occurring problems have implications and solutions particular to object-oriented development. ===Inheritance and behavioral subtyping=== {{See also|Object oriented design}}<!-- not "further" because that article is mostly blather and does not even mention this --> It is intuitive to assume that inheritance creates a [[program semantics|semantic]] "[[is a]]" relationship, and thus to infer that objects instantiated from subclasses can always be ''safely'' used instead of those instantiated from the superclass. This intuition is unfortunately false in most OOP languages, in particular in all those that allow [[mutable]] objects. [[Subtype polymorphism]] as enforced by the [[type checker]] in OOP languages (with mutable objects) cannot guarantee [[behavioral subtyping]] in any context. Behavioral subtyping is undecidable in general, so it cannot be implemented by a program (compiler). Class or object hierarchies need to be carefully designed considering possible incorrect uses that cannot be detected syntactically. This issue is known as the [[Liskov substitution principle]]. ===Gang of Four design patterns=== {{Main|Design pattern (computer science)}} ''[[Design Patterns (book)|Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software]]'' is an influential book published in 1995 by [[Erich Gamma]], [[Richard Helm]], [[Ralph Johnson]], and [[John Vlissides]], sometimes casually called the "Gang of Four". Along with exploring the capabilities and pitfalls of object-oriented programming, it describes 23 common programming problems and patterns for solving them. As of April 2007, the book was in its 36th printing. The book describes the following patterns: * ''[[Creational pattern]]s'' (5): [[Factory method pattern|Factory Method Pattern]], [[Abstract Factory Pattern]], [[Singleton pattern|Singleton Pattern]], [[Builder pattern|Builder Pattern]], [[Prototype pattern|Prototype Pattern]] * ''[[Structural pattern]]s'' (7): [[Adapter Pattern]], [[Bridge Pattern]], [[Composite Pattern]], [[Decorator Pattern]], [[Facade Pattern]], [[Flyweight Pattern]], [[Proxy pattern|Proxy Pattern]] * ''[[Behavioral pattern]]s'' (11): [[Chain-of-responsibility
