CDATA sections or the order of attributes, is not necessarily preserved in the output, since this information is not part of the [[XPath data model]]. To make sure CDATA markup is maintained in the output, the XSLT stylesheet that contains the identity transform template (''not'' the identity transform template itself) should make use of the '''xsl:output''' attribute called '''cdata-section-elements'''. For example: <source lang="xml"><xsl:output method="xml" encoding="utf-8" cdata-section-elements="element-name-1 element-name-2"/></source> ===Using XQuery=== [[XQuery]] can define recursive functions. The following example function copies the input directly to the output without modification. <source lang="xml"> declare function local:copy($element as element()) { element {node-name($element)} {$element/@*, for $child in $element/node() return if ($child instance of element()) then local:copy($child) else $child } }; </source> === Using XProc === <source lang="xml"> <p:pipeline name="pipeline" xmlns:p="http://www.w3.org/ns/xproc"> <p:identity/> </p:pipeline> </source> Here one important note about the [[XProc]] identity, is that it can take either one document like this example or a sequence of document as input. == More complex examples == Generally the identity transform is used as a base on which one can make local modifications. === Remove named element transform === ==== Using XSLT ==== The identity transformation can be modified to copy everything from an input tree to an output tree except a given node. For example the following will copy everything from the input to the output except the social security number: <source lang="xml"> <xsl:template match="@*|node()"> <xsl:copy> <xsl:apply-templates select="@*|node()"/> </xsl:copy> </xsl:template> <!-- remove all social security numbers --> <xsl:template match="PersonSSNID"/> </source> ====Using XQuery ==== <source lang="xml"> declare function local:copy-filter-elements($element as element(), $element-name as xs:string*) as element() { element {node-name($element) } { $element/@*, for $child in $element/node()[not(name(.)=$element-name)] return if ($child instance of element()) then local:copy-filter-elements($child,$element-name) else $child } }; </source> To call this one would add: <code>$filtered-output := local:copy-filter-elements($input, 'PersonSSNID')</code> ==== Using XProc ==== <source lang="xml"> <p:pipeline name="pipeline" xmlns:p="http://www.w3.org/ns/xproc"> <p:identity/> <p:delete match="PersonSSNID"/> </p:pipeline> </source> ==See also== * [[data mapping]] * [[XML pipeline]] ==References== * The original reference to the identity transformation in the W3C recommendation document [http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#copying] * The identity step is also a required component of an XML Pipeline using the W3C [[XProc]] Recommendation [http://www.w3.org/TR/xproc/#c.identity] (accessed Nov 20, 2010) * Use of the identity transform is covered in the book ''XSLT Cookbook'', O'Reilly Media, Inc., December 1, 2002, by Sal Mangano, ISBN 0-596-00372-2 * Priscilla Walmsley, ''XQuery'', O'Reilly Media, Inc., Chapter 8 Functions &ndash; Recursive Functions &ndash; page 109 [[Category:Computer programming]] [[Category:Transforms]]</text> </page> <page> <id>17881</id> <title>Identity verification service</title> <text>'''Identity verification services''' are online services used to establish a mapping from a person's [[online identity]] to their [[Real life (reality)|real life]] identity. These services are used by some [[social networking sites]], [[Internet forum]]s, [[dating site]]s and [[wiki]]s to stop [[sockpuppetry]], underage SignUps, [[spamming]] and illegal activities like harassment and scams. The identity confirmation process requires the individual who's identity is to be confirmed to provide personal data online, to the identity verification firm. The firm then checks public and private databases for a match and prompts the user to answer questions based on the records. An identity "score" is calculated, and the identity of the online user is either given the "verified" status, or not, based on the score.<ref name="JG">{{cite web|url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/nobody_knows_youre_a_dog.php|title=Nobody Knows You're A Dog 2.0|last=Gupta|first=Jitendra|date=January 29, 2007|publisher=ReadWriteWeb|accessdate=2009-07-10}}</ref><ref name="TW">{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/76558/VeriSign_unveils_new_online_identity_verification_services|title=VeriSign unveils new online identity-verification services|last=Weiss|first=Todd|date=December 10, 2002 |publisher=ComputerWorld|accessdate=2009-07-10}}</ref> ==References== {{Reflist}} {{Internet-stub}} [[Category:Internet privacy]] [[ms:Perkhidmatan pengesahan identiti]]</text> </page> <page> <id>17883</id> <title>Idiomag</title> <text>{{Infobox Website | name = Idiomag | favicon = | logo = | screenshot = | caption = | url = [http://idioplatform.com/ http://idioplatform.com] | commercial = Yes | type = Digital publishing, data, advertising | registration = Free | owner = [[Idio, Ltd.]] | language = [[English language|English]] | launch date = 2006 | current status = Active | revenue = }} '''Idiomag''' is a UK-based digital publishing company founded in 2006 by two [[Warwick Business School]] graduates, Andrew Davies and Ed Barrow.<ref name="guardian.co.uk">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2008/apr/07/elevatorpitchidiomagcreates|title=Elevator Pitch: Idiomag Creates a Home for Music Aggregation|date=2008-04-07|publisher=[[The Guardian]] | location=London | first=Jemima | last=Kiss | accessdate=2010-05-05}}</ref> The idio [[Computing platform|platform]] allows publishers and brands to personalise their content and distribute it across multiple platforms,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://platform.idiomag.com/|title=idio's personalised publishing platform|publisher=idiomag}}</ref> which is intended to improve audience engagement and revenue.
