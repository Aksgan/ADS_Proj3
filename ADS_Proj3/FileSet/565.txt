done by Version 1.3 ensures the consistency of these models. == High Maturity Clarifications == The CMMI Product Development Team has formed a High Maturity Team. This team’s members are focusing on improvements to high maturity practices [http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/abstracts/webinars/10feb2009.cfm] in all three CMMI models to ensure that they are representative of current best practices in the community. This team’s work focuses on the four high maturity process areas: Organizational Process Performance (OPP), Quantitative Project Management (QPM), Causal Analysis and Resolution (CAR), and Organizational Innovation and Deployment (OID). == Translations == CMMI models are now available in Japanese, Traditional Chinese, Spanish, German, and French [http://www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/tools/translations/]. The teams that created these translations have requested that we improve the models’ ease of translation. During the development of CMMI Version 1.3, a team with representation from these translation teams is working with the model development team to make model translation easier. == Expanded Coverage == A number of change requests have suggested further expansion of CMMI models in new directions. Although this release is not suitable for major expansions like the ones in two most recently released constellations, information may be added on customer satisfaction, software architecture, and Agile Methods [http://www.agilecmmi.com/]. == Multi-Constellation Coverage == Many students taking either of the one-day supplement courses that cover acquisition or service delivery have commented that many organizations span more than one area of interest. One theme for the V1.3 release is to enable sharing of best practices across the constellations. The SCAMPI Method Definition Document will be improved to facilitate appraisals that use process areas from multiple constellations. == Benefits == The benefits<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bcs.org/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.3051 | title=Use CMMI correctly and the business benefits | accessdate=November 11, 2009 }}</ref> you can expect from using CMMI include the following: • Your organization's activities are explicitly linked to your business objectives. • Your visibility into the organization's activities is increased to help you ensure that your product or service meets the customer's expectations. • You learn from new areas of best practice (e.g., measurement, risk) CMMI is being adopted worldwide, including North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, South America, Yemen, and Africa. This kind of response has substantiated the SEI's commitment to CMMI. == References == {{reflist}}<!-- <references/> may be used instead. --> [[Category:Maturity models]]</text> </page> <page> <id>5105</id> <title>CMU Pronouncing Dictionary</title> <text>{{Infobox Software | name = CMU Pronouncing Dictionary | developer = [[Carnegie Mellon University]] | latest release version = 0.7a | latest release date = {{release date and age|2008|02|18}} | status = Maintained | license = [[Public Domain]] | language = [[English language|English]] | website = [http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict Homepage] }} The '''CMU Pronouncing Dictionary''' (also known as ''cmudict'') is a [[public domain]] pronouncing [[dictionary]] created by [[Carnegie Mellon University]] (CMU). It is used as the American lexicon for the [[Festival Speech Synthesis System]] and also for the [[CMU Sphinx]] speech recognition system. The latest release is 0.7a, which contains 133,746 entries (from 123,442 baseforms). ==Database Format== The database is distributed as a text file of the format ''word <two spaces> pronunciation''. If there are multiple pronunciations available for a word, all subsequent entries are followed by an index in [[Bracket#Parentheses .28 .29|parentheses]]. The pronunciation is encoded using a modified form of the [[Arpabet]] system. The difference is stress marks on vowels with levels 0, 1, 2; not all entries have stress however. ==History== {| class="wikitable" |- ! Version !

These include a series of speech recognizers (Sphinx 2 - 4) and an [[Acoustic Model|acoustic model]] trainer (SphinxTrain). In 2000, the Sphinx group at Carnegie Mellon committed to open source several speech recognizer components, including Sphinx 2 and later Sphinx 3 (in 2001). The speech decoders come with acoustic models and sample applications. The available resources include in addition software for acoustic model training, [[Language model]] compilation and a public-domain pronunciation dictionary, [[CMU Pronouncing Dictionary|cmudict]]. '''Sphinx''' encompasses a number of software systems, described below. ==Sphinx== Sphinx is a continuous-speech, speaker-independent recognition system making use of hidden Markov acoustic models ([[Hidden Markov model|HMMs]]) and an n-gram statistical language model. It was developed by [[Kai-Fu Lee]]. Sphinx featured feasibility of continuous-speech, speaker-independent large-vocabulary recognition, the possibility of which was in dispute at the time (1986). Sphinx is of historical interest only; it has been superseded in performance by subsequent versions. An [http://www.ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/pub2/lee_k_f_1990_1/lee_k_f_1990_1.pdf archival article] describes the system in detail. ==Sphinx 2== A fast performance-oriented recognizer, originally developed by [[Xuedong Huang]] at Carnegie Mellon and released as [[Open source]] with a [[BSD]]-style license on [[SourceForge]] by [[Kevin Lenzo]] at LinuxWorld in 2000. Sphinx 2 focuses on real-time recognition suitable for spoken language applications. As such it incorporates functionality such as end-pointing, partial hypothesis generation, dynamic language model switching and so on. It is used in dialog systems and language learning systems. It can be used in computer based PBX systems such as [[Asterisk (PBX)|Asterisk]]. Sphinx 2 code has also been incorporated into a number of commercial products. It is no longer under active development (other than for routine maintenance). Current real-time decoder development is
