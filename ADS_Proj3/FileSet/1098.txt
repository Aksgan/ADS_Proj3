He received the [[Presidential Young Investigator Award]] from the [[National Science Foundation]] in 1984 and was awarded the 1997 [[SIGMOD Edgar F.

He holds a B.A. in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Oregon (Honors College, 1974) and a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science by [[Princeton University]] (1978). Maier established some of the earliest results on using the [[relational model]]. Together with his thesis advisor, [[Jeffrey Ullman]], and fellow Princeton students, including [[Alberto O. Mendelzon]] and [[Yeshoshua Sagiv]], he co-authored a number of influential papers that laid out the fundamental issues and approaches for relational databases. In a now-famous paper (Maier, Mendelzon and Sagiv, TODS 1979), he introduced the chase, a method for testing implication of data dependencies that is now of widespread use in the database theory literature.<ref>David Maier, [[Alberto O. Mendelzon]], [[Yehoshua Sagiv]]: Testing Implications of Data Dependencies. ACM Trans. Database Syst. 4(4): 455-469 (1979).</ref> This work has been highly influential: it is used, directly or indirectly, on an everyday basis by people who design databases, and it is used in commercial systems to reason about the consistency and correctness of a data design. New applications of the chase in meta-data management and data exchange are still being discovered. He is credited for coining the term [[Datalog]].<ref>Serge Abiteboul, Richard Hull, Victor Vianu: Foundations of databases. p305 [http://books.google.com/books?id=HN9QAAAAMAAJ&q=David+Maier&pgis=1#search_anchor].</ref> ==References== <references/> * David Maier's homepage: http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~maier/ * His database theory book, now available online: http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~maier/TheoryBook/TRD.html {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME = Maier, David | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH = | PLACE OF BIRTH = | DATE OF DEATH = | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Maier, David}} [[Category:American computer scientists]] [[Category:Database researchers]] [[Category:Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery]] [[Category:SIGMOD Edgar F.

Marr integrated results from [[psychology]], [[artificial intelligence]], and [[neurophysiology]] into new models of [[visual processing]]. His work was very influential in [[Computational neuroscience|Computational Neuroscience]] and led to a resurgence of interest in the discipline. Born in [[Woodford, London|Woodford]], [[Essex]], and educated at [[Rugby School]]; he was admitted at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] on 1 October 1963 (having been awarded the Lees Knowles Rugby Exhibition). He was awarded the Coutts Trotter Scholarship in 1966 and obtained his BA in [[mathematics]] the same year and got his Ph.D. in [[physiology]] under Professor [[Giles Brindley|G.S. Brindley]] in 1972. His interest turned from general brain theory to visual processing. His doctoral dissertation was submitted in 1969 and described his model of the function of the [[cerebellum]] based mainly on anatomical and physiological data garnered from a book by [[John Carew Eccles|J.C. Eccles]]. A similar model was later independently proposed by [[James S. Albus]]. Subsequently he worked at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], where he took on a faculty appointment in the Department of Psychology in 1977 and was subsequently made a tenured full professor in 1980. Marr proposed that understanding the [[brain]] requires an understanding of the problems it faces and the solutions it finds. He emphasized the need to avoid general theoretical debates and instead focus on understanding specific problems. Marr died of [[leukemia]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Marr's findings are collected in the book ''Vision: A computational investigation into the human representation and processing of visual information'' (ISBN 0-7167-1567-8), which was published after his death. He was married to Lucia M. Vaina of Boston University's Department of Biomedical Engineering and Neurology. The [[Marr Prize]], one of the most prestigious awards in [[computer vision]], is named in his honor. ==Levels of analysis== Marr treated vision as an information processing system. He put forth (in concert with [[Tomaso Poggio]]) the idea that one must understand information processing systems at three distinct, complementary levels of analysis. This idea is known in cognitive science as Marr's [[Tri-Level Hypothesis]]: <ref name="Dawson">Dawson, Michael. "Understanding Cognitive Science." Blackwell Publishing, 1998.</ref> * computational level: what does the system do (e.g.: what problems does it solve or overcome) and, equally importantly, why does it do these things * algorithmic/representational level: how does the system do what it does, specifically, what representations does it use and what processes does it employ to build and manipulate the representations * implementational level: how is the system physically realized (in the case of biological vision, what neural structures and neuronal activities implement the visual system) ==Stages of vision== Marr described vision as proceeding from a two-dimensional visual array (on the retina) to a three-dimensional description of the world as output. His stages of vision include *a '''''primal sketch''''' of the scene, based on feature extraction of fundamental components of the scene, including edges, regions, etc. Note the similarity in concept to a pencil sketch drawn quickly by an artist as an impression. *a '''''[[2.5D]] sketch''''' of the scene, where textures are acknowledged, etc. Note the similarity in concept to the stage in drawing where an artist highlights or shades areas of a scene, to provide depth. *a '''''3 D model''''', where the scene is visualized in a continuous, 3-dimensional map. [[Francis Crick]] noted that this insight although seminal, has been somewhat modified. 2.5D sketch is related to [[stereopsis]], [[optic flow]], and [[motion parallax]]. The 2.5D sketch represents that in reality we do not see all of our surroundings but construct the viewer-centered three dimensional view of our environment. 2.5D Sketch is a paraline drawing and often referred to by its generic term "axonometric" or "isometric" drawing and are often used by modern architects and designers.<ref name="Uddin">Uddin, Saleh.
