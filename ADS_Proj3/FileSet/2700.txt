His family saw him as ill, and acquiesced.<ref name=Bartley33/> ==1920&ndash;1928: Teaching, the ''Tractatus'', Haus Wittgenstein== ===Teacher training in Vienna, the Prater=== In September 1919 he enrolled in the ''Lehrerbildungsanstalt'' (teacher training college) in the ''Kundmanngasse'' in Vienna. His sister Hermine said that Wittgenstein working as an elementary teacher was like using a precision instrument to open crates, but the family decided not to interfere.<ref name=Monk169>Monk, p. 169ff.</ref> He moved out of the family home and into lodgings in ''Untere Viaduktgasse'' in Vienna's third district, and it was during this period that, according to [[William Warren Bartley]], a professor of philosophy at Stanford, Wittgenstein engaged in a series of casual homosexual encounters in an area of the city called the ''[[Prater]]'', within walking distance of his lodgings. It is a controversial claim, one that Bartley first made in 1973 in his biography ''Wittgenstein'', and denied at the time by Wittgenstein's executors and friends in England, who seemed to argue that, although Wittgenstein was not heterosexual, he had not actually engaged in gay sex.<ref>See for example Hacking, Ian. "The Uncommercial Traveller," ''The Times Higher Educational Supplement'', 8 April 1983, and Bartley's response in the same publication 29 April 1983, p. 35.</ref> Bartley writes that he obtained the information from Wittgenstein's friends, and it was this activity, he argues, that Wittgenstein was referring to when he wrote to the architect [[Paul Engelmann]] in May 1920: "Things have gone utterly miserably for me lately. Of course only because of my own baseness and rottenness. I have continually thought about taking my own life, and now too this thought still haunts me. 'I have sunk to the bottom'. May you never be in that position!"<ref>Bartley, pp. 40–44.</ref> The literary executors threatened legal action to suppress publication of Bartley's book, according to an afterword he included in a 1985 edition. Bartley writes that a whispering campaign began against him, with one British literary critic writing, "The general line here is that you are to be drummed out of the trade and that no academic invitation of any kind will be extended to you from the United Kingdom henceforth ..."<ref>Bartley, p. 160ff.</ref> ===Teaching posts in Austria=== In 1920 Wittgenstein was given his first job as a primary school teacher in [[Trattenbach]], a village of just a few hundred. His first letters describe it as beautiful, but in October 1921, he wrote to Russell: "I am still at Trattenbach, surrounded, as ever, by odiousness and baseness. I know that human beings on the average are not worth much anywhere, but here they are much more good-for-nothing and irresponsible than elsewhere."<ref>Klagge, James Carl. ''Wittgenstein: Biography and Philosophy''. Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 185.</ref> He was soon the object of gossip among the villagers, who found him eccentric at best. He didn't get on well with the other teachers; when he found his lodgings too noisy, he made a bed for himself in the school kitchen. He was an enthusiastic teacher, offering late-night extra tuition to several of the boys, something that did not endear him to the parents, though some of the boys came to adore him; his sister Hermine occasionally watched him teach and said the students "literally crawled over each other in their desire to be chosen for answers or demonstrations."<ref>[[Norman Malcolm|Malcolm, Norman]].

The first two hours of each day were devoted to mathematics, hours that Monk writes some of the pupils recalled years later with horror. They reported that he caned the boys and boxed their ears, and also that he pulled the girls' hair;<ref name=Bartley107>Bartley, p. 107.</ref> this was not unusual at the time for boys, but for the villagers he went too far in doing it to the girls too; girls were not expected to understand algebra, much less have their ears boxed over it. The physicality apart, Monk writes that he quickly became a village legend, shouting "''Krautsalat!''" when the headmaster played the piano, and "Nonsense!" when a priest was answering children's questions.<ref>Monk, pp. 196, 198.</ref> ===Publication of the ''Tractatus''=== {{see|Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus}} {|class="toccolours" style="float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#white; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;" cellspacing="5" |style="text-align: left;"| "The main point is the theory of what can be expressed (gesagt) by prop[osition]s&mdash;i.e. by language—(and, which comes to the same thing, what can be ''thought'') and what can not be expressed by pro[position]s, but only shown (gezeigt); which, I believe, is the cardinal problem of philosophy." |- |style="text-align: left;" |— Wittgenstein, letter to Russell, 19 August 1919.<ref>Russell, Nieli.

Russell had agreed to write an introduction to explain why it was important, because it was otherwise unlikely to have been published: it was difficult if not impossible to understand, and Wittgenstein was unknown in philosophy.<ref>For the introduction, see Russell, Bertrand.
