The firewall is based on technology developed by [[Sygate Technologies]], who were purchased by Symantec. Generic exploit blocking is a technique that proactively blocks [[malware]] from exploiting unpatched [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]].<ref>http://www.symantecbigdraw.com/DocumentsSEP/12645930_SEP_migration%20guide.pdf</ref> ;Proactive protection: Endpoint 11 uses Symantec's TruScan technologies to facilitate detection of unknown malware. It analyzes both "safe" and "negative" behaviors of unknown applications.<ref>http://smallbiztechnology.com/archive/2007/12/how-symantec-is-changing-to-be.html</ref> It also integrates Symantec's Deepsight [[honeypot (computing)|honeypot]] sensors to warn of emerging threats and provide threat advisories.<ref>http://www.federalnewsradio.com/pdfs/EndpointSecurity-White%20Paper.pdf</ref> Proactive Threat Protection feature is currently unsupported on server operating systems.<ref>http://service1.symantec.com/SUPPORT/ent-security.nsf/docid/2007091713544248</ref> ;Intrusion prevention: Endpoint 11 is able to create and enforce rules on client computers. For example, it can prevent clients from writing files to a [[USB flash drive]]. Intrusion prevention also work as IDS.

At present it is available for the [[Amstrad CPC]] series of computers, as well as for all [[MSX]] models starting from the [[MSX2]] standard and for most [[Amstrad PCW]] models. Contrary to early 8-bit operating systems it is based on a [[microkernel]], which provides pre-emptive and priority oriented multitasking and manages RAM with a size of up to 1024 kB. SymbOS contains a [[Microsoft Windows]] like [[Graphical user interface]], supports [[hard disk]]s with a capacity of up to 128 GB and can already be booted on an unexpanded [[Amstrad CPC]]-6128, a 128K-[[MSX]]2 and an [[Amstrad PCW]]. ==Background== Although only an 8-bit CPU, the Z80 is capable of running a [[Preemption (computing)|pre-emptive]] [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] [[operating system]]. Features such as memory protection, which the Z80 does not support, are not essential in such an OS. For example, [[AmigaOS]] does not feature [[memory protection]] either. The [[MP/M]] OS proved that multitasking on the Z80 CPU was possible, however it was not generally available for home computers. While the [[MOS Technology]] [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] cannot move the [[stack pointer]], the Z80 can freely relocate it to any position in memory, which is more or less a requirement for [[pre-emptive multitasking]]. The existence of an alternative register set accelerates context switching between tasks dramatically. The restriction of Z80 system to a 64 kB [[address space]] can be solved with [[bank switching]]. In this way computers like the [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[Amstrad PCW|PCW]], [[MSX]], [[Enterprise 128|Enterprise]] or [[SAM Coupé]] are able to access hundreds or thousands of kilobytes of memory. ==Kernel== SymbOS includes a microkernel, which is capable of performing task management, memory management and [[inter-process communication]]. ===Task management=== For task management, a combination of preemptive and cooperative multitasking was chosen, which makes different task priorities possible. Preemptive means that tasks are interrupted after a certain amount of time by the operating system, in order to share the CPU time with other tasks. Cooperatively means that a task stops using CPU time by itself. It does that, if it's finished with its current job or waiting for a certain event. Because of this combination it is possible to assign priorities. Tasks with low priority get CPU time only if all tasks with higher priorities are not then working. ===Memory and banking management=== Memory management divides the entire RAM into small 256 byte blocks, which can be assigned dynamically. Applications are always running in a secondary 64 kB RAM bank, where no memory space is occupied by the operating system or the video memory. That makes it possible to reserve up to 63 kB in one piece. Banking management ensures that the system is able to administer memory with a size of up to one megabyte, even though the Z80 CPU has only a [[16-bit]] address bus. It makes transparent access to memory and functions placed in other 64 kB banks possible. ===Inter-process communication=== Communication between different tasks and the operating system usually does not take place via "Calls", but is done via "Messages". This is necessary inside a multitasking environment to avoid organization problems with the stack, global variables and shared system resources. The SymbOS kernel supports synchronous as well as asynchronous IPC. ==Graphical user interface== [[Image:Symbos-msx2.gif|thumb|250px|Screenshot of the MSX version of SymbOS]] [[Image:SymbOS-PCW-1.gif|thumb|250px|SymbOS running on the Amstrad PCW in high-resolution mode]] The GUI of SymbOS works in a completely object-oriented manner. The look and feel mimics that of Microsoft Windows. It contains the well-known task bar with the clock and the "start" menu and can open up to 32 windows that can be moved, resized and scrolled. As the complete system is written in optimized assembly language, the GUI is fast compared to modern systems. Content of a window is defined with "controls" that are
