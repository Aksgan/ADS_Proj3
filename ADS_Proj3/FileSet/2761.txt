Goldman wrote a highly critical review of the book in ''[[Medscape|Medscape Today]],'' stating that it "looks as if it were commissioned by [[Scientology and psychiatry|Scientologists]]."<ref name=gold/> Goldman writes that Whitaker "is ready to throw the baby out with the bath water" because ''Mad in America'' fails to acknowledge any [[Schizophrenia#Neural|biological abnormalities in schizophrenia]] despite the considerable literature in this area, while at the same conceding that Whitaker's argument that the true [[causes of schizophrenia]] are not known is correct. Goldman also writes that the book promotes something akin to a [[conspiracy theory]] "because it strings together many decades of disparate flops into a unifying theme of ongoing catastrophe." Goldman concludes that the "overheated style" of the book "tends to undermine some of its more important points, such as the unhealthy symbiosis between the US pharmaceutical industry and much of the psychiatric research community and the ever-present miserliness of public mental healthcare systems."<ref name=gold/> Clinical psychologist Claudia Bukszpan Rutherford similarly acknowledges the book's insight into many of the problems of clinical psychiatry over the years has good points, but is hampered by the author's extreme position and lack of investigation into what improves the prognosis of schizophrenia in underdeveloped countries. She adds that his minimizing of the severity and impact of the illness itself takes away from criticism of treatment.<ref>{{cite journal| author= Rutherford, Claudia B. |year=2002|title=Review of Mad in America: Bad Science, Bad Medicine, and the Enduring Mistreatment of the Mentally Ill by Robert Whitaker|journal=Human Nature Review|volume=2|pages=95–98|accessdate=8 Noivember 2010|url=http://www.human-nature.com/nibbs/02/mia.html}}</ref> The book was also reviewed in ''[[JAMA]]'', where reviewer Daniel J.
