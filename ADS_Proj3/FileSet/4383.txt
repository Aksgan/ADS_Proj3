An advocate of the VMS operating system, he wrote the first version of the [[OpenVMS|VMS]] user guide, ''Introduction to VAX/VMS'' through Professional Press in May 1985 (ISBN 096147291X). This ran for five editions. According to those associated with its original publisher, Professional Press, the first edition of the book sold more than 100,000 copies.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} The latest (5th) edition was called ''Introduction to OpenVMS'' (ISBN 1878956612). It is required reading for some Computer Science college courses.<ref name="Required Reading">[http://web.archive.org/web/20051127212030/http://www.bemidjistate.edu/bsucatalog/CS/Courses.html BSU CS required reading][http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/breutzma/CS240/index.html Watrburg CS240 required reading]</ref> Shannon began to publish a newsletter in 1994, ''Shannon Knows DEC'', which eventually became ''Shannon Knows Compaq'', after the firm's acquisition, and then ''Shannon Knows HPC''. His insider knowledge constantly frustrated those he wrote about, and HP pursued a love/hate relationship, occasionally citing him in [http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2002pmc/pr2002022002.html?jumpid=reg_R1002_USEN press releases]. The newsletter ran until his death in 2005. ==Analysis and citations== As a well-known expert in the field, Shannon was also widely quoted in the independent trade press, such as in ''[[The Register]]''<ref name="chipzilla"/><ref> [http://www.theregister.co.uk/1999/03/17/shannon_declares_chipzilla_open_source/ Shannon declares Chipzilla Open Source word]</ref> as well as in ''[[Computerworld]]'',<ref name="One Year Later">{{cite web | url=http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;709804404;fp;;fpid;;pf;1 | title=Compaq, One Year Later | publisher=Computerworld | date=2000-03-04 | accessdate=2007-02-22}}</ref><ref name="Silicon roadmaps">{{cite web | url=http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;1038074087 | title=Processors: Silicon roadmaps to cheaper chips | publisher=Computerworld | date=2003-07-14 | accessdate=2007-02-22}}</ref> TechWeb<ref name="techweb">{{cite web | url=http://www.techweb.com/wire/story/TWB20040120S0004 | title=VMS's Stability Prompts Move To Itanium | publisher=TechWeb | date=2004-01-20 | accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref> ITNews,<ref name="ITNews">{{cite web | url=http://www.itnews.com.au/newsstory.aspx?CIaNID=14077 | title=HP could use Opteron in ProLiant servers | publisher=ITNews | date=2004-01-30 | accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref>, and [[Cnet]]<ref name="Cnet 1">{{cite web | url=http://news.com.com/HP-Compaq+merger+Worth+the+wait/2100-1001_3-956202.html | title=HP-Compaq merger — worth the wait? | publisher=Cnet | date=2002-09-02 | accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref><ref name="Cnet 2">{{cite web | url=http://news.com.com/Compaq+finds+new+clients+for+luxury+servers/2100-1001_3-935816.html | title=Compaq finds new clients for luxury servers | publisher=CNet | date=2001-05-10 | accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref> Shannon played an important role in the publishing industry competition between ''[[Ziff-Davis]]'' and ''[[International Data Group]]'', the two largest technology publishing firms of the 1980s. During his tenure at Ziff's ''Digital Review'' semi-monthly, Shannon reported on unannounced products from DEC and other companies; this provided important content for ''Digital Review'' in its competitive battle with ''Digital News,'' a competition that reflected the larger rivalry between the publications' parent companies.<ref> {{cite journal|title=The war among the Digitals: Bitter competition reflects growing rivalry between Ziff, McGovern empires|journal=Boston Globe|date=1985-05-17|first=|last=|coauthors=|volume=|issue=|pages=|id= |url=|format=|accessdate=}}</ref> Shannon's reporting on the minicomputer industry included extensive analysis of the inroads made by IBM's AS/400 line of minicomputers against Digital's VAX line. The competition among minicomputer vendors would prove to be a turning point in Shannon's career, as eventual mergers led to his DEC newsletter shifting its focus to Compaq (later, HP-Compaq).<ref> {{cite journal|title=Digital turns up the power in battle with IBM|journal=Boston Globe|date=1989-04-11|first=|last=|coauthors=|volume=|issue=|pages=|id= |url=|format=|accessdate=}}</ref> During the early 1990s, much of Shannon's focus was on DEC's development of the Alpha chip, a processor intended to replace its aging VAX CPU line. As DEC prepared the Alpha chip for release, Shannon was widely used as a source of advance information on the new processor.<ref> {{cite journal|title=Digital ready to unwrap Alpha: Ailing computer maker will introduce new line after a year of "fantasy talk." |journal=Boston Globe|date=1992-11-09|first=|last=|coauthors=|volume=|issue=|pages=|id= |url=|format=|accessdate=}}</ref> Shannon also reported extensively on Digital executives and their comings and goings within the company.

Although the TTF was meant to be notation-independent, the original presentation was made using the [[Z notation|Z formal notation]]. It is one of the few MBT frameworks approaching [[unit testing]]. ==Introduction== ''The TTF is a specific proposal of [[model-based testing]] (MBT). It considers models to be [[Z notation|Z specifications]]. Each operation within the specification is analyzed to derive or generate [[#Abstract test case|''abstract test cases'']]. This analysis consists of the following steps:'''''' # Define the [[#Input space|''input space'']] (IS) of each operation. # Derive the [[#Valid input space|''valid input space'']] (VIS) from the [[#Input space|IS]] of each operation. # Apply one or more [[#Testing tactic|''testing tactics'']]<ref name="testing strategy">Stocks and Carrington use the term ''testing strategies'' in {{Harv|Stocks|Carrington|1996}}.</ref>, starting from each [[#Valid input space|VIS]], to build a [[#Testing tree|''testing tree'']] for each operation. Testing trees are populated with nodes called [[#Test class|''test classes'']]. # [[#Pruning testing trees|''Prune'']] each of the resulting [[#Testing tree|testing trees]]. # Find one or more [[#Abstract test case|''abstract test cases'']] from each leaf in each [[#Testing tree|testing tree]]. One of the main advantages of the TTF is that all of these concepts are expressed in the same notation of the specification, i.e. the [[Z notation]]. Hence, the engineer has to know only one notation to perform the analysis down to the generation of [[#Abstract test case|abstract test cases]]. ==Important concepts== In this section the main concepts defined by the TTF are described. ===Input space=== Let <math>Op</math> be a Z operation. Let <math>x_{1} \dots x_{n}</math> be all the input and (non-primed) state
