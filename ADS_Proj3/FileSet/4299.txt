/> All ATC systems are equipped with CCTV systems enabling instantaneous response to traffic incidents and congestions. '''Instant fault detection and quick repair'''<br /> The ATC system is also equipped with the function of fault detection and logging the fault detected in order to facilitate repair and maintenance. Should there be a telecommunication breakdown, the ATC junction controller concerned will switch to standalone mode and continue to function. <br /> '''Traffic Adaptive Operation'''<br /> ATC systems provide advanced method of traffic signal control called Traffic Adaptive Control where the operational timing plans including cycle length, splits and offsets are continuously reviewed and modified in small increment, almost on a cycle-by-cycle basis, to match with the prevailing demand measured by the detectors connected to the on-street traffic controllers. ==See also== *[[PTIPS]], a bus prioritisation system assisted by SCATS Other Intelligent Transportation Systems include: *[[STREAMS Integrated Intelligent Transport System|STREAMS]] *[[Brisbane Linked Intersection Signal System|BLISS]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.roads.act.gov.au/trafficmanagement/trafficsignals Roads ACT] *[http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au Roads and Traffic Authority, NSW] *[http://www.scats.com.au SCATS Website] [[Category:Intelligent transportation systems]] {{Australia-road-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>36324</id> <title>Symantec</title> <text>{{Infobox Company | name = Symantec Corporation | logo = [[File:Symantec logo 2010.svg|250px|The Symantec logo]] | type = [[Public company|Public]] ({{NASDAQ|SYMC}}) | genre = | predecessor = | foundation = [[Sunnyvale, California]], [[United States|U.S.]] ({{Start date|1982|3|1}}) | founder = [[Gary Hendrix]]<br />Denis Coleman<br />[[Gordon Eubanks]] | location_city = 350 Ellis Street,<ref>[http://www.symantec.com/about/profile/contact.jsp Symantec - Contact Us].

The company is headquartered in [[Mountain View, California]], and is a [[Fortune 500]] company and a member of the [[S&P 500]] stock market index. ==History== Founded in 1982 by [[Gary Hendrix]] with a [[National Science Foundation]] grant, Symantec was originally focused on [[artificial intelligence]]-related projects, including a database program. Hendrix hired several [[Stanford University]] [[natural language processing]] researchers as the company's first employees, among them [[Barry Greenstein]] (professional poker player and developer of [[Q&A (software)|Q&A]]). In 1984 Symantec was acquired by another, even smaller computer software startup company, C&E Software, founded by Denis Coleman and [[Gordon Eubanks]] and headed by Eubanks. The merged company retained the name Symantec, and Eubanks became its [[chief executive officer]]. Its first product, [[Q&A (software)|Q&A]], was released in 1985. Q&A provided [[Database management system|database management]] and bundled a word processor. In August 1990, Symantec purchased [[Peter Norton Computing]], a developer of various applications for [[DOS]]. Symantec's consumer antivirus and data management utilities are still marketed under the Norton name. At one time Symantec was also known for its development tools, particularly the '''THINK Pascal''', [[THINK C]], '''Symantec C++''', and [[Visual Cafe]] packages that were popular on the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] and [[IBM PC compatible]] platforms; they exited this business in the late-1990s as competitors such as [[Metrowerks]], [[Microsoft]], and [[Borland]] gained significant market share. In 1985, [[Gordon Eubanks|Gordon E. Eubanks, Jr.]], then president and CEO of Symantec Corporation and Tom Byers and Ted Schlein, formed Turner Hall Publishing, a division of Symantec devoted to publishing third-party software<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:GaxdaUdMgCIJ:www.cwhonors.org/archives/histories/Eubanks.pdf+%22Turner+Hall+Publishing%22&hl=en&gl=ca&sig=AHIEtbQhf3lmxre17qqPIDDtN8oTAMA5Hw |title=Gordon Eubanks Oral History, COMPUTERWORLD HONORS PROGRAM, Daniel S.
