an [[acrylic resin|acrylic]] solid surface material. Both '''Avonite''' series are solid surfaces that have a textured [[granite]] or [[gemstone]] look manufactured by the company ''Avonite Surfaces'' and ''Aristech Acrylics LLC''. Avonite resembles stone, with the color being the same throughout the material. It is a popular material for use in baths and kitchens (as [[countertop]]s) since it can be worked and polished with woodworking tools. '''Avonite''' also manufacturers a 40% Post Industrial RECYCLED series of solid surfaces. == External links == * [http://www.avonitesurfaces.com Avonite's website.] [[Category:Construction]] [[cs:Avonite]]</text> </page> <page> <id>3021</id> <title>Axis-aligned object</title> <text>In [[geometry]], an '''axis-aligned object''' ('''axis-parallel''', '''axis-oriented''') is an object in ''n''-dimensional space whose shape is aligned with the [[coordinate axes]] of the space. Examples are [[axis-aligned rectangle]]s (or [[hyperrectangle]]s), the ones with edges parallel to the coordinate axes. [[Minimum bounding box]]es are often implicitly assumed to be axis-aligned. A more general case is [[rectilinear polygon]]s, the ones with all sides parallel to coordinate axes or rectilinear polyhedra. Many problems in [[computational geometry]] allow for algorithms with better [[computational complexity]] when restricted to (collections of) axis-oriented objects, such as axis-aligned rectangles or axis-aligned line segments. A different kind of example are axis-aligned ellipsoids, i.e., the [[ellipsoid]]s with principal axes parallel to the coordinate axes. ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Geometry]] [[Category:Geometric algorithms]]</text> </page> <page> <id>3031</id> <title>Azriel Rosenfeld</title> <text>{{Infobox_Scientist | name = Azriel Rosenfeld | image = <!--Azriel.jpg|300px deleted for no source--> | image_width = 300px | birth_date = {{birth date|1931|2|19|mf=y}} | death_date = {{death date and age|2004|2|22|1931|2|19|mf=y}} | residence = [[Image:Flag of the United States.svg|20px|]] [[United States|U.S.]] | nationality = [[Image:Flag of the United States.svg|20px|]] [[US]] | field = [[Computer Science|Computer Scientist]] | work_institution = [[University of Maryland, College Park]] | doctoral_advisor = [[Ellis Kolchin]] (mathematician, Columbia University) | doctoral_students = Narendra Ahuja</br>Ramalingam Chellappa</br>Larry Davis</br>Charles Dyer</br>Jan-Olof Eklundh | known_for = pioneering contributions to digital image analysis | prizes = [[King-Sun Fu Prize]] (1988)</br>Norbert Wiener Award of the IEEE (1995) }} Professor Dr. '''Azriel Rosenfeld''' (February 19, 1931 - February 22, 2004) was an American Research Professor, a Distinguished University Professor, and Director of the Center for Automation Research at the University of Maryland in [[College Park, Maryland]], where he also held affiliate professorships in the Departments of [[computer science|Computer Science]], [[electrical engineering|Electrical Engineering]], and [[Psychology]]. He held a Ph.D. in [[mathematics]] from [[Columbia University]] (1957), rabbinic ordination (1952) and a Doctor of [[Hebrew literature|Hebrew Literature]] degree (1955) from [[Yeshiva University]], and honorary Doctor of Technology degrees from [[Linkoping University]], Sweden (1980) and [[Oulu University]], Finland (1994), an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Yeshiva University (2000), and an honorary degree from the [[Technion]] (posthumously in 2004). He was a [[Fellow]] of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (1994). Professor Rosenfeld was widely regarded as a leading researcher in the world in the field of [[computer image analysis]]. Over a period of nearly 40 years he made many fundamental and pioneering contributions to nearly every area of that field. He wrote the first textbook in the field (1969); was founding editor of its first journal (1972); and was co-chairman of its first international conference (1987). He published over 30 books and over 600 book chapters and journal articles, and directed nearly 60 Ph.D. dissertations. Professor Rosenfeld’s research on digital image analysis (specifically on [[digital geometry]] and [[digital topology]], and on the accurate measurement of statistical features of [[digital images]]) in the 1960’s and 1970’s formed the foundation for a generation of industrial vision inspection systems that have found widespread applications from the automotive to the electronics industry. Professor Rosenfeld was a ''ba'al koreh'' ([[Torah reading|Torah Reader]]) at [http://www.yise.org Young Israel Shomrai Emunah of Greater Washington] for many years until he moved to [[Baltimore]] in 2001. In honor of the memory of Professor Rosenfeld, ICCV gives the biennial [[Azriel Rosenfeld Award]] to a living person in the recognition of an outstanding life-time contribution to the field of image understanding or computer vision. ==External links== * [http://www.cfar.umd.edu/~ar/ In memoriam (source for the text above)] * [http://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/html/id.phtml?id=37407 PhD students of Azriel Rosenfeld] {{Persondata |NAME=Rosenfeld, Azriel |ALTERNATIVE NAMES= |SHORT DESCRIPTION=Computer scientist |DATE OF BIRTH=February 19, 1931 |PLACE OF BIRTH=, , [[United States|U.S.]] |DATE OF DEATH=February 22, 2004 |PLACE OF DEATH=, [[United States|U.S.]] }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Rosenfeld, Azriel}} [[Category:Computer vision researchers]] [[Category:Digital geometry]] [[Category:Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery]] [[Category:1931 births]] [[Category:2004 deaths]]</text> </page> <page> <id>3049</id> <title>BAMC</title> <text>{{dablink|BAMC is also the name used for [[Brooke Army Medical Center]] in San Antonio, Texas, and the [[Blue Angels Motorcycle Club]] in Glasgow, Scotland.}} '''British Airways Maintenance Cardiff (BAMC)''', also known as '''British Airways Maintenance''' is [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/286107 located] near Cardiff International Airport, is a wholly owned subsidiary of [[British Airways]], and carries out heavy maintenance on British Airways longhaul aircraft (specifically, Boeing 747-400, Boeing 777-200, Boeing 767 and recently Boeing 777-300 Series) ==History== In June 1990, a proposal was made to build a £70m hangar for maintenance of the BA 747 fleet at Cardiff Airport to employ 1,200 people. It was formally opened in June 1993. From February 2008, BAMC also maintained [[Boeing 767-300]] series aircraft for BA whilst a further advance in capability has seen the introduction of [[777-300#777-300|Boeing 777-300]] aircraft from July 2010. Other BA operations in the area include [http://www.britishairways.com/travel/baengineeringavionic/public/en_gb British Airways Avionic Engineering] at [[Pontyclun]], [[Rhondda Cynon Taff]] and British Airways Interiors Engineering in [[Blackwood, Caerphilly]]. ==Structure== It has a three-bay [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/920423 hangar with two additional 'Nose In' facilities for interior modifications]. It is [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/210130 based] at Tredogan near [[Rhoose]] in the Vale of Glamorgan. BAMC employes in excess of 650 people, in three main departments: * Production * Planning & Materials * Engineering Services == Rugby == BAMC has its very own rugby union team, playing under the name of British Airways Club South Wales RFC, the team are two time winners of the World Airline Rugby Tournament (WART) in 2000, and 2003.
