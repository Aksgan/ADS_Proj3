These ever-changing constructions represent the new way of communicating for people who like to express their activities and share their common interests. On social blogs people inform each other about their activities by providing them with updates continually. These updates often include text (around 140 characters), pictures, audio or video. Through several ways messages can be transmitted to social blogs, including the web, instant messaging, text messaging and e-mail. People can create blogs on places like blogspot.com, and it's completely free. Social blogging serves as a useful weight loss tool, as its inherent form allows for continuous updates on calorie intake and exercise completed throughout the day. Acting as a virtual support system, Twitter and various blog communities have assisted many people in losing a great deal of weight.<ref>{{cite web | last = Kearl | first = Mary | authorlink = http://www.aolhealth.com/bio/mary-kearl| title = Using Twitter and Blogging As a Diet and Weight Loss Tool | publisher = AOL Health | date = April 2009 | url = http://www.aolhealth.com/diet/basics/twitter-diet | accessdate = August 2009}}</ref><references/> {{DEFAULTSORT:Social Blogging}} [[Category:Blogging]]</text> </page> <page> <id>34819</id> <title>Social media and suicide</title> <text>'''Social media and suicide''' have important relationships.

'''Social network analysis''' views [[social relationship]]s in terms of [[network theory]] consisting of ''nodes'' and ''ties'' (also called ''edges'', ''links'', or ''connections''). [[Node (computer science)|Nodes]] are the individual actors within the networks, and ties are the relationships between the actors. The resulting [[Graph (mathematics)|graph]]-based structures are often very [[Complex network|complex]]. There can be many kinds of ties between the nodes. Research in a number of academic fields has shown that social networks operate on many levels, from families up to the level of nations, and play a critical role in determining the way problems are solved, organizations are run, and the degree to which individuals succeed in achieving their goals. In its simplest form, a social network is a map of specified ties, such as friendship, between the nodes being studied. The nodes to which an individual is thus connected are the '''social contacts''' of that individual. The network can also be used to measure [[social capital]] â€“ the value that an individual gets from the social network. These concepts are often displayed in a social network diagram, where nodes are the points and ties are the lines. ==Social network analysis== [[Image:Sna large.png|right|300px|thumb|An example of a social network diagram. The node with the highest [[#Metrics (Measures) in social network analysis|betweenness centrality]] is marked in yellow.]] Social network analysis (related to ''[[network theory]]'') has emerged as a key technique in modern [[sociology]]. It has also gained a significant following in [[anthropology]], [[biology]], [[communication studies]], [[economics]], [[geography]], [[information science]], [[organizational studies]], [[social psychology]], and [[sociolinguistics]], and has become a popular topic of speculation and study. People have used the idea of '''"social network"''' loosely for over a century to connote complex sets of relationships between members of social systems at all scales, from interpersonal to international. In 1954, J. A. Barnes started using the term systematically to denote patterns of ties, encompassing
