His mother was Kann Margit (Margaret Kann). János, nicknamed "Jancsi" (Johnny), was a [[child prodigy]] who showed an aptitude for languages, memorization, and mathematics. By the age of six, he could exchange jokes in [[Classical Greek]], memorize telephone directories, and display prodigious [[mental calculation]] abilities.<ref>William Poundstone, ''Prisoner's dilemma'' (Oxford, 1993), introduction</ref> He entered the Hungarian-speaking Lutheran high school [[Fasori Gimnázium|Fasori Evangelikus Gimnázium]] in Budapest in 1911. Although he attended school at the grade level appropriate to his age, his father hired private tutors to give him advanced instruction in those areas in which he had displayed an aptitude. Recognized as a mathematical [[child prodigy|prodigy]], at the age of 15 he began to study under [[Gábor Szegő]]. On their first meeting, Szegő was so impressed with the boy's mathematical talent that he was brought to tears.<ref>Impagliazzo, p. 5</ref> In 1913, his father was rewarded with ennoblement for his service to the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian empire]]. (After becoming [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|semi-autonomous in 1867]], Hungary had found itself in need of a vibrant mercantile class.) The Neumann family thus acquiring the title ''margittai'', Neumann János became margittai Neumann János (John Neumann of Margitta), which he later changed to the German Johann von Neumann. He received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[mathematics]] (with minors in [[experimental physics]] and [[chemistry]]) from [[Eötvös Loránd University|Pázmány Péter University]] in Budapest at the age of 22.<ref name="NYT"/> He simultaneously earned his diploma in [[chemical engineering]] from the [[ETH Zurich]] in Switzerland<ref name="NYT"/> at the behest of his father, who wanted his son to invest his time in a more financially viable endeavour than mathematics. Between 1926 and 1930, he taught as a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], the youngest in its history. By age 25, he had published ten major papers, and by 30, nearly 36.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} His father, Max von Neumann died in 1929. In 1930, von Neumann, his mother, and his brothers emigrated to the United States. He [[anglicize]]d his first name to John, keeping the Austrian-aristocratic surname of von Neumann, whereas his brothers adopted surnames Vonneumann and Neumann (using the ''de Neumann'' form briefly when first in the U.S.). Von Neumann was invited to [[Princeton University]], [[Princeton, New Jersey|New Jersey]] in 1930, and, subsequently, was one of the first four people selected for the faculty of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] (two of the others being [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Kurt Gödel]]), where he remained a mathematics professor from its formation in 1933 until his death. In 1937, von Neumann became a [[Naturalized_citizen#United_States|naturalized citizen]] of the U.S. In 1938, von Neumann was awarded the [[Bôcher Memorial Prize]] for his work in analysis. Von Neumann married twice. He married Mariette Kövesi in 1930, just prior to emigrating to the United States. They had one daughter (von Neumann's only child), [[Marina von Neumann Whitman|Marina]], who is now a distinguished professor of international trade and public policy at the [[University of Michigan]]. The couple divorced in 1937. In 1938, von Neumann married Klara Dan, whom he had met during his last trips back to Budapest prior to the outbreak of [[World War II]]. The von Neumanns were very active socially within the Princeton academic community, and it is from this aspect of his life that many of the anecdotes which surround von
