and “a gifted environment sensitive to its uniqueness”.<ref>''Up from Dragons'', p. 282</ref> ====Braintech==== Humans from early on when using [[Stone_tool#Paleolithic_tools|stone tools]] have created technologies that have enhanced their abilities. This will continue with the still unexplored potential of the brain. One area is awareness of its hidden functioning as this is needed to better train it. The future of present [[functional imaging]] is proposed to be akin to that of [[History_of_computing_hardware#Post-1960:_third_generation_and_beyond|computers as in the 1960s]]. Like such past computers such technology will spiral down in price and convenience so that this braintech (like computers today) will become an essential part of everyday human life.<ref>''Up from Dragons'', pp. 270-279</ref> ==Criticisms== * Fails to link with earlier work upon “cognitive ergonomics”.<ref name="Greenberg"/><sup>p.143</sup> * The description of the prefrontal cortex “begs for more commentary on their likely causes, consequences, and context”.<ref name="Greenberg"/><sup>p.143</sup> * Fails to discuss helping behavior before “primate or even mammalian sociality emerged”.<ref name="Greenberg"/><sup>p.144</sup> * Should have explored cost/benefits of sociosexual selection.<ref name="Greenberg"/><sup>p.146</sup> * Lacks “an unambiguous definition of mindware … the resemblance to (if not identity with) ‘culture’ needs to be explored”.<ref name="Greenberg"/><sup>p.146</sup> * The field of [[psychoneuroendocrinology]] and the developmental forces such as [[sensitive periods]] and [[behavior genetics]] is neglected.<ref name="Greenberg"/><sup>p.147</sup> * Its account of consciousness which depends upon coherence does not explain “possession, dissociation, out-of-body experiences and addictions”.<ref name=" Winkelman"/><sup>p.279</sup> * “The authors seem to fall all too easily into a simplistic materialism”.<ref name=" Winkelman"/><sup>p.279</sup> * The notion of Brain Age is wrong: “It is not the brain age, but the mind age, the culture age, the dawning realization of our capacity to ''program'' our brain to do many different things.<ref name=" Winkelman"/><sup>p.279</sup> * Lacks anatomical and flowchart illustrations.<ref>Dickinson T.

Retrieved on 2010-07-09.]</ref>. Implementing a social computing aspect, the update database is maintained by the users. UpdateStar uses advertising to refinance the free service and shares ad revenue 50/50 with the software authors via their [[#Share - the ad sharing program|Share program]]. Software can be searched, downloaded and updated. In addition, UpdateStar is a freeware client that can be easily installed to inform users about available updates for their individual softwaare setup. It allows downloading, installing and uninstalling the programs from within the client, which acts as an enhancement for the Add/Remove Programs control panel applet (Programs and Features on [[Windows Vista]] and above). The software search engine at http://www.updatestar.com/ is actually built on top of UpdateStar’s user generated software and up-to-date program database. Via the ad revenue sharing program [[#Share - the ad sharing program|Share]], UpdateStar allows and motivates developers to use the UpdateStar website as a download mirror to participate from ad revenue created on their program’s webpages. == History == UpdateStar was founded by Michael Ganss, Frank Alperstaedt, and Olaf Kehrer in [[2007]], and is currently based in [[Berlin]]. The software search engine website itself, however, did not launch until July 2008. The company is funded by the founders. The current version of the site was released in July 2008. This included new software search capabilities with results based on user submitted information for more than 259,000 programs, a new professional services business section, and an UpdateStar freeware client section. UpdateStar freeware has grown in popularity with about 50,000 users in 2007 and about 550,000 users in July 2008{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}. UpdateStar 4, released in March 2009 introduced an enhanced recognition algorithm and a [[registry cleaner]], which removes remnants of uninstalled software. Updates appear almost on a daily basis for a software setup with 60 to 80 programs on a typical PC making it nearly impossible for a PC user to keep up. UpdateStar tries to make the user aware of these updates. It is available as [[freeware]] as well as the commercial Premium Edition with additional security advice for program, a cleaner for system maintenance and more. UpdateStar provides the user with information about software updates available for software on their computer. This includes major releases provided by UpdateStar Freeware Edition as well as minor version upgrades and patches included with the Premium Edition. Many updates are published because of security reasons and newly included features. Either way software updates should be considered important or even critical in case of updates made available by the publishers for security reasons{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}. UpdateStar Premium additionally offers security advice allowing for an identification of important software updates. UpdateStar Premium
