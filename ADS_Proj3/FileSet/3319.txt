interest with each other. This interface/protocol was named the "Santa Fe Convention". Several workshops were held in 2000 at the [http://www.jcdl.org/ ACM Digital Libraries conference] and elsewhere to share the ideas from the Santa Fe Convention. It was discovered at the workshops that the problems faced by the e-print community were also shared by libraries, museums, journal publishers, and others who needed to share distributed resources. To address these needs, the [http://www.cni.org/ Coalition for Networked Information] and the [http://www.diglib.org/ Digital Library Federation] provided funding to establish an [[Open Archives Initiative]] ([[OAI]]) secretariat managed by Herbert Van de Sompel and Carl Lagoze. The OAI held a meeting at [[Cornell University]] ([[Ithaca, New York]]) in September 2000 to improve the interface developed at the Santa Fe Convention. The specifications were refined over e-mail. OAI-PMH version 1.0 was introduced to the public in January 2001 at a workshop in [[Washington D.C.]], and another in February in [[Berlin, Germany]]. Subsequent modifications to the [[XML]] standard by the [[W3C]] required making minor modifications to OAI-PMH resulting in version 1.1. The current version, 2.0, was released in June 2002. It contained several technical changes and enhancements and is not backward compatible. ==OAI registries== The OAI Protocol has become widely adopted by many digital libraries, institutional repositories, and digital archives. Although registration is not mandatory, it is encouraged. There are several large registries of OAI-compliant repositories: #[http://www.openarchives.org/Register/BrowseSites The Open Archives list of registered OAI repositories] #[http://gita.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/Info.asp The OAI registry at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign] #[http://celestial.eprints.org/ The Celestial OAI registry] #[http://archives.eprints.org/ Eprint’s Institutional Archives Registry] #[http://www.openarchives.eu Openarchives.eu The European Guide to OAI-PMH compliant repositories in the world] #[http://en.scientificcommons.org ScientificCommons.org A worldwide service and registry] ==Uses== Commercial [[search engine]]s have started using OAI-PMH to acquire more resources. [[Google]] is using OAI-PMH to harvest information from the [http://www.nla.gov.au/digicoll/oai/ National Library of Australia Digital Object Repository]. In 2004, [[Yahoo!]] acquired content from [[OAIster]] ([[University of Michigan]]) that was obtained through metadata harvesting with OAI-PMH. Google did accept OAI-PMH as part of their [[Google Sitemaps|Sitemap Protocol]], though decided to stop doing so in 2008<ref>[http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2008/04/retiring-support-for-oai-pmh-in.html Google Webmaster blog]</ref>. [[Wikimedia]] uses an OAI-PMH repository to provide feeds of [[Wikipedia]] and related site updates for search engines and other bulk analysis/republishing endeavors.<ref>{{Cite document|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_update_feed_service|publisher=Wikimedia Meta-Wiki|unused_data=Wikimedia update feed service|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> The [[mod_oai]] project is using OAI-PMH to expose content to web crawlers that is accessible from [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache Web servers]]. ==Software== OAI-PMH is based on a [[client–server]] architecture, in which "harvesters" request information on updated records from "repositories". Requests for data can be based on a datestamp range, and can be restricted to named sets defined by the provider. Data providers are required to provide [[XML]] metadata in [[Dublin Core]] format, and may also provide it in other XML formats. A number of software systems support the OAI-PMH, including [[Fedora_(software)|Fedora]], [[Eprints|GNU EPrints]] from the [[University of Southampton]], [[Open Journal Systems]] from the [[Public Knowledge Project]], [[Desire2Learn]], [[DSpace]] from [[MIT]], [[HyperJournal]] from the [[University of Pisa]], Primo, DigiTool, Rosetta and MetaLib from [http://www.exlibrisgroup.com Ex Libris], [http://door.sourceforge.net/index.html DOOR] from the [http://www.elearninglab.org/ eLab] in Lugano, Switzerland, [http://www.panFMP.org/ panFMP] from the [[PANGAEA (data library)]], [[SimpleDL]] from Roaring Development, and [http://www.dlese.org/dds/services/joai_software.jsp jOAI]. ==Archives== A number of large archives support the protocol including [[arXiv]] and the [[CERN]] Document Server. ==Workshops== Since 2001 there has been a yearly workshop at [[CERN]] in [[Geneva]]'''.''' ==See also== * [[Data format management]] * [[Digital curation]] * [[Digital preservation]] * [[File format]] * [[Library of Congress Digital Library project]] * [[Dublin Core]], an ISO metadata standard * [[National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program]] * [[METS|Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard]] maintained by the Library of Congress * [[Preservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies (PREMIS)]] * [[LOCKSS]] * [[Web archiving]] == Notes == {{reflist}} ==References== * {{cite conference | author = Carl Lagoze and Herbert Van de Sompel | year = 2001 | title = [http://www.openarchives.org/documents/jcdl2001-oai.pdf The Open Archives Initiative: Building a Low-Barrier Interoperability Framework] | booktitle = Proceedings of the first ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL'01) | pages = 54–62}} * Lynch, Clifford A.
