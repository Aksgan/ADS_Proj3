followed as well, derived from the desktop 9200. ==Models== {{main|Comparison of ATI Graphics Processing Units}} == Drivers == ===UNIX-related operating systems=== [[ATI Technologies|ATI]] has released no driver support for [[BSD]] based operating systems, however they do provide drivers for the [[X Window System]] running on [[Linux]]. Despite this, newer ATI Catalyst driver for [[Linux]] [[X Window System]] does not offer support for any R200 or older architecture product. Users are referred to using older drivers for older kernels, or the open source "radeon" driver for newer kernels. The PowerPC-based [[Mac mini]] and [[iBook G4]], which run on [[Mac OS X]], were supplied with Radeon 9200 cards. Some segments of the Linux user community, which prefer to avoid the [[Intellectual property|IP]]-encumbered ATI drivers due to stability and long term maintainability reasons, or run Linux on hardware platform not supported by the official binary-only drivers still prefer the R200-based chips, as they are among the fastest modern video cards with stable [[open source software|open source]] 3D drivers. ===Windows drivers=== This series of Radeon graphics cards is supported by AMD under [[Microsoft Windows]] operating systems including [[Windows XP]] (except [[Windows XP Professional x64 Edition|x64]]), [[Windows 2000]], [[Windows Me]], and [[Windows 98]]. Other operating systems may have support in the form of a generic driver that lacks complete support for the hardware. Driver development for the R200 line ended with the Catalyst 6.11 drivers for Windows XP. ===Classic Mac OS=== The Radeon 9200 was the final ATI card to officially support [[Mac OS 9]]. ==See also== *[[ATI Technologies]] *[[Comparison of ATI Graphics Processing Units]] ==References== {{Reflist}} *[http://www.beyond3d.com/reviews/ati/radeon8500/ "ATi Radeon 8500 64 MB Review (Part 1)"] by Dave Baumann, Beyond3D.Com, March 29, 2002, retrieved January 14, 2006 *[http://www.beyond3d.com/reviews/ati/radeon8500p2/ "ATi Radeon 8500 64 MB Review (Part 2)"] by Dave Baumann, Beyond3D.Com, April 4, 2002, retrieved January 14, 2006 *[http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/video/display/radeon-9100.html "ATI RADEON 9100 Based Graphics Cards Review: Gigabyte and PowerColor Solutions"] by Tim Tscheblockov, X-Bit Labs, February 5, 2003, retrieved January 9, 2006 *[http://www.anandtech.com/showdoc.aspx?i=1517 "ATI's Radeon 8500 & 7500: A Preview"] by Anand Lal Shimpi, Anandtech, August 14, 2001, retrieved January 9, 2006 *[http://www.anandtech.com/showdoc.aspx?i=1544 "ATI's Radeon 8500: She's got potential"] by Anand Lal Shimpi, Anandtech, October 17, 2001, retrieved January 9, 2006 *[http://www.beyond3d.com/resources/chip/13 "ATI R200 Chip Details"] by Beyond3D, retrieved August 30, 2010 *[http://www.beyond3d.com/resources/chip/16 "ATI RV250 Chip Details"] by Beyond3D, retrieved August 30, 2010 *[http://www.beyond3d.com/resources/chip/17 "ATI RV280 Chip Details"] by Beyond3D, retrieved August 30, 2010 {{ATI}} [[Category:ATI Technologies products]] [[Category:Video cards]] [[ar:ريدون آر 200]] [[cs:Radeon R200]] [[de:ATI-Radeon-8000-Serie]] [[fr:Radeon R200]] [[ko:라데온 R200]] [[pt:Radeon R200]] [[fi:Radeon 8000 -sarja]] [[zh:Radeon R200]]</text> </page> <page> <id>31124</id> <title>Radial tree</title> <text>[[Image:Radial_tree_-_Graphic_Statistics_in_Management.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Example of a radial tree, from a 1924 organization chart that emphasizes a central authority.<ref>W. H. Smith., Graphic Statistics in Management (McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York, ed. First, 1924) http://www.visualcomplexity.com/vc/project.cfm?id=10</ref>]] A '''radial tree''', or "radial map", is a method of displaying a [[tree structure]] (e.g., a [[Tree (data structure)|tree data structure]]) in a way that expands outwards, radially. It is one of many ways to visually display a tree.<ref>[http://www.spicynodes.org/reference-background.html Various 2-D radial graph and network visualizations, from SpicyNodes documentation]</ref><ref>http://www.visualcomplexity.com/vc/project.cfm?id=26</ref>, with examples extending back to the early 20th century<ref>http://www.visualcomplexity.com/vc/project.cfm?id=289</ref>. In use, it is a type of [[Information graphics|information graphic]]. [[Image:Radial-vs-tri.gif|thumb|middle|300px|Radial vs. triangular tree layout]] == Comparison to other layouts == In a simple case, the first node is at the top, and the linked nodes are beneath. As each node typically has more than one child, the resulting shape is relatively triangular. In a radial layout, instead of each successive generation being displayed a row below, each generation is displayed in a new, outer orbit. Since the length of each orbit increases with the radius, there tends to be more room for the nodes. A radial tree will spread the larger number of nodes over a larger area as the levels increase. We use the terms level and depth interchangeably.<ref>Greg Book & Neeta Keshary. "Radial Tree Graph Drawing Algorithm for Representing Large Hierarchies." University of Connecticut December 2001</ref> Nevertheless, the number of nodes increases exponentially with the distance from the first node, whereas the circumference of each orbit increases linearly, so by the outer orbits, the nodes tend to be packed together. == Basic layout == [[Image:Radial-graph-schmatic.gif|thumb|200px|Schematic radial tree.]] The overall distance "d" is the distance between levels of the graph, and is chosen so the overall layout will fit on a screen. Layouts are generated by working outward from the center, root. The first level is a special case because all the nodes have the same parent. The nodes for level 1 can be distributed evenly, or weighted depending on the number of children they have. For subsequent levels, the children are positioned within sectors of the remaining space, so that child nodes of one parent do not overlap with others. There are a many extensions to this algorithm to create more visually balanced layouts, to allow a user to navigate from node to node (changing the center)<ref>Yee, K.-P, D. Fisher, R. Dhamija, & M.
