[[The Open Group]] had to make a decision about what to stick with, and unfortunately the final POSIX threads were different from their selection. POSIX Draft 4 threads were limited to begin with (the final standard fixed these). Microsoft adopted DCE/RPC wholesale in Windows NT as [[MSRPC]] and also in [[Distributed Component Object Model|DCOM]]. Most of the stability and reliability problems that programmers associate with DCOM services - especially [[memory leak]]s, exception handling problems and thread cancellation stability issues - can be traced back to the use of POSIX Draft 4 threads. DCE/RPC is sufficiently complex that the issue of updating it to solve and modernise the POSIX Draft 4 threading problem requires highly skilled and highly specific programming knowledge. Consequently, for all that it can accomplish, the reference implementation of DCE/RPC languishes due to a lack of information and resources. The key difference between POSIX Draft 4 threads and the final POSIX threads specification, aside from a number of functions being interruptible where others are not, is thread cancellation. DCE/RPC utilises thread cancellation to propagate signals across the "Remote" of RPC, such that for example a client application terminating a thread results in its corresponding thread on the server also being terminated in the same way. Unfortunately, the final POSIX specification does not include such sophisticated cancellation methodology, and, given the difficulties that the Unix vendors had in correctly implementing the POSIX threads specification, it is not surprising that it was removed. ==Recent developments== Linux, since the introduction of NPTL and the Linux 2.6 kernel, has proper support for thread cancellation. ==Current use== DCEThreads now only realistically exists as an emulation layer. {{DEFAULTSORT:Dcethreads}} [[Category:POSIX standards]] {{Compu-network-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>8949</id> <title>DDObjects</title> <text>{{Technical|date=October 2009}} '''DDObjects''' is a [[remoting framework]] for [[Borland Delphi]] and [[C++ Builder]]. A main goal while developing DDObjects has not been only to keep the [[code]] one has to implement in order to utilize DDObjects as simple as possible but also very close to Delphi's usual style of [[event-driven]] [[programming]]. DDObjects supports [[remote method calls]], [[server callbacks]], [[asynchronous calls]], [[asynchronous callbacks]], stateful and -less objects and other features. DDObjects doesn't mimic other implementations as [[DCOM]] or [[CORBA]], which are generalized to a least common denominator, but makes use of Delphi's rich type system including Objects, Exceptions, Records, Sets and Enumerations. DDObjects uses plain [[XML]] and [[HTTP]] as [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]], contains a [[broker component]], a [[sourcecode]] [[Code generation|generator]] as well as some new [[visual]] controls. DDObjects supports Delphi 5 to 7, 2005-2009 as well as C++ Builder 6, 2006 and 2009. == External links == *[http://www.ddobjects.de DDObjects - Remoting for Borland Delphi] {{DEFAULTSORT:Ddobjects}} [[Category:Inter-process communication]]</text> </page> <page> <id>8954</id> <title>DECAF</title> <text>{{Other uses|decaf}} '''Detect and Eliminate Computer Acquired Forensics''' ('''DECAF''') is a counter intelligence tool specifically created around obstructing the well known [[Microsoft]] product [[Computer Online Forensic Evidence Extractor|COFEE]] used by law enforcement around the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/12/decaf-cofee/|title=Hackers Brew Self-Destruct Code to Counter Police Forensics|last=Zetter|first=Kim|date=14 December 2009|publisher=Wired.com|accessdate=15 December 2009}}</ref> However, the tool does not prevent access by other more advanced computer forensics tools, and so computers protected with DECAF can still be examined by non-COFEE tools.
