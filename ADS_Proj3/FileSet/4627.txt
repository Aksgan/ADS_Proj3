of Unix since the early [[Bell Laboratories]] versions.{{fact|date=April 2007}} ''[http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/udunits/index.jsp UDUNITS]'' is a similar utility program, except that it has an additional programming [[Library (computing)|library]] interface and date conversion abilities. UDUNITS is considered the ''de facto'' program and library for variable unit conversion for [[netCDF]] files.<ref>As specified from several [[NetCDF]] conventions, e.g.: *'''COARDS''' - {{cite web |title=Conventions for the standardization of NetCDF files |date=1995-02-10 |url=http://ferret.wrc.noaa.gov/noaa_coop/coop_cdf_profile.html }} *'''CF''' - {{cite web |title=NetCDF Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions |url=http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/eaton/cf-metadata/CF-1.0.html |date=2003-10-28 }}</ref> The relatively newer [[GNU]] [[free software]] version of ''units'' (or '''GNU Units''') is written by [[Adrian Mariano]]. ==Usage== ''Units'' will output the result of the conversion in two lines. Usually the first line (multiplication) is the desired result. The second line is the same conversion expressed as a division. ''Units'' can also do math while converting, including several built in mathematical functions such as [[sine|sin]], [[cosine|cos]], [[arctangent|atan]], [[natural logarithm|log]], [[exponential function|exp]], etc. If you attempt to convert types of measurements that are incompatible ''units'' will print a conformability error message and display a reduced form of each measurement. ===Examples=== ====Interactive mode==== 2083 units, 71 prefixes, 32 nonlinear units You have: 10 furlongs You want: miles * 1.2500025 / 0.7999984 You have: 1 gallon + 3 pints You want: quarts * 5.5 / 0.18181818 You have: sqrt(miles^2) You want: Definition: 1609.344 m You have: ====On the [[command line]] (non-interactive)==== % units 'ten furlongs per fortnight' 'kilometers per hour' * 0.0059871548 / 167.02424 % units cup ounces conformability error 0.00023658824 m^3 0.028349523 kg ==References== <references/> ==External links== *[http://www.gnu.org/software/units/units.html GNU Units homepage] *[http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/units.htm Native port for Windows of GNU Units] *[http://www.linuxmanpages.com/man1/units.1.php GNU Units man page] *[http://www.unitsconvert.com On-line units converter based on Units] *[http://www.units-converter.com A simple on-line converter based on Units] [[Category:cross-platform software]] [[Category:Unix software]] [[Category:GNU Project software]] [[Category:free mathematics software]] [[es:Units]]</text> </page> <page> <id>38886</id> <title>Unity (game engine)</title> <text>{{otheruses2|Unity}} {{Primary sources|date=September 2010}} {{Infobox software |name = Unity |location = [[SanFrancisco]] |logo = [[Image:Unity-game-engine-logo.jpg]] |screenshot = |caption = |developer = [[Unity Technologies]] |latest_release_version = 3.1.0f3 |latest_release_date = November 10, 2010 |operating_system = [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Mac OS X]] (creation and deployment), [[Wii]], [[iPhone]]/[[iPad]] (deployment with special license), [[Xbox 360]] (deployment with additional Microsoft license), [[Android (operating system)|Android]] (deployment with special license), [[PS3]] (deployment with special license) |written in = [[C++ (runtime)]] |genre = [[Game engine]] |license = [[Proprietary software|Proprietary]] |website = [http://www.unity3d.com/ www.unity3d.com] }} '''Unity''' is an integrated [[authoring tool]] for creating 3D [[video game]]s or other interactive content such as [[architectural visualization]]s or real-time 3D animations. Unity is similar to [[Macromedia Director|Director]], [[Game Blender|Blender game engine]], [[Virtools]] or [[Torque Game Builder]] in the sense that an integrated graphical environment is the primary method of development. The editor runs on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]] and can produce games for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Apple Macintosh|Mac]], [[Wii]]<ref name="Wii">{{cite web | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=18840| title=Unity to Support Wii Console as Authorized Middleware Provider | publisher=Gamasutra}}</ref>, [[iPad]], or [[iPhone]]<ref name="iPhone">{{cite web | url=http://www.macworld.com/article/132771/2008/04/unity.html | title=Unity Game Engine Coming to iPhone| publisher=Macworld}}</ref> platforms. It can also produce [[browser game]]s that use the Unity web player [[plug-in (computing)|plugin]], supported on [[Apple Macintosh|Mac]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. The web player is also used for deployment as Mac widgets. Support for [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]] have recently been added. Unity won the [[Wall Street Journal]] 2010 Technology Innovation Award in the software category <ref>{{cite web | url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703904304575497473735761294.html | title=The WSJ Technology Innovation Award Winners, Category by Category | publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>.

A shader can include multiple variants and a declarative fallback specification, allowing Unity to detect the best variant for the current video card and if none are compatible, fall back to an alternative shader that may sacrifice features for broader compatibility. * Built-in Support for [[NVIDIA|Nvidia's]] (formerly [[Ageia|Ageia's]]) [[PhysX]] [[physics engine]] <ref>{{cite web | url=http://unity3d.com/unity/features/physics | title=Features: Advanced Physics| publisher=Unity Technologies}}</ref>, version 2.8.3 (as of Unity 3.0) with added support for real time cloth on arbitrary and skinned meshes, thick ray casts, and collision layers. * Game Scripting via Mono <ref>{{cite
