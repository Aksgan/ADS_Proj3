It also includes virus filtering and usage monitoring features. DansGuardian must be installed on a [[Unix]] or [[GNU/Linux]] computer, such as a server computer; its filtering extends to all computers in an organization, including [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Mac OS X|Macintosh]] computers. DansGuardian is used by schools, businesses, value-added [[Internet service provider]]s, and others.<ref>[http://dansguardian.org/?page=whousesit "Who Uses DansGuardian?"]</ref> == Features == === Virus filtering === DansGuardian can use [[ClamAV]] to scan for, and block, [[computer virus|viruses]], in the files that users download. === Usage monitoring === DansGuardian saves log files showing who has visited which webpage. These files can be reviewed manually or with the help of [[log analysis]] software. === Open source === DansGuardian is one of the few widely used content control systems that makes its [[source code]] available, thus avoiding some of the criticisms associated with content control system proxies being "[[Black box (systems)|black box]]" systems. == Technical details == DansGuardian is distributed under the [[GPLv2]] free software license, and written using the [[C++]] programming language. It primarily runs in [[GNU/Linux]] and other [[Unixes]]. It is entirely command line and web-based, and meant to be used in conjunction with a web proxy such as [[Squid cache|Squid]]. The [[Ubuntu Christian Edition]] GNU/Linux distribution includes a graphical user interface (GUI) tool for configuring DansGuardian, but the tool does not work as well as the configuration tools included with [[SmoothWall]] Guardian, and other web filters. Although there is a graphical user interface available for Ubuntu, called WebContentControl, which installs and configures DansGuardian, [[FireHol]] and [[TinyProxy]] easily.<ref>[https://launchpad.net/webcontentcontrol/ WebContentControl Website]</ref> == Legal details == In the [[United States]], DansGuardian satisfies the requirements of [[Children's Internet Protection Act]]. == Proprietary versions == Two proprietary versions of DansGuardian exist; SmoothGuardian is a module for [[SmoothWall]] Limited Firewalls, and SmoothWall Network Guardian is a stand-alone product.<ref>[http://www.smoothwall.net SmoothWall Limited]</ref> The SmoothWall implementation of DansGuardian represents a [[Becta]] certified web filtering system.<ref>[http://localauthorities.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=pf&catcode=ls_pict_08&rid=13219 Becta Accredited Suppliers]</ref> == Forks == There is now a fork of Dansguardian Project called MinD. Its name is a recursive acronym for MinD is not Dansguardian. The "Toy" version of MinD is a fork of Dansguardian Project version 2.10.1.1 with some improvements. == See also == {{Portal|Free software}} * [[Internet censorship]] * [[Content-control software]] ==References== <references /> ==External links== * [http://dansguardian.org/ DansGuardian Website] * [http://contentfilter.futuragts.com/wiki/ DansGuardian Wiki] * [http://www.squidguard.org/ squidGuard Website] * [http://urlblacklist.com/ URLBlacklist] * Matt Villano, "[http://www.thejournal.com/articles/22573 What Are We Protecting Them From?]," T.H.E.

The language is a structured form of [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] and is similar to [[AMOS BASIC programming language|AMOS]] on the [[Amiga]]. The purpose of the language is game creation using [[Microsoft]]'s [[DirectX]] from a [[BASIC programming language]]. ==DarkBASIC== Darkbasic is a programming language that specializes in the creation of games. It can create both 2D and 3D games using a lot less code than the equivalent program would take by using more powerful languages such as C++ due to the included libraries. It is often referred to as DarkBASIC Classic to avoid confusion with [[DarkBASIC Professional]]. It consists of an [[Integrated development environment|IDE]], [[Debugger]] and [[interpreter]], and an engine built on [[DirectX]] 7. The compiler emitted [[Bytecode]] that is appended to an [[Interpreter (computer software)|interpreter]] to create a stand alone executable. The current version is 1.21, released on 14 August 2008. Since the introduction of Darkbasic Professional, The Game Creators have stated that there will be no further updates to the language, although it will still be sold.
