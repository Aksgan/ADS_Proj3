As of December 2010, the Android Marketplace had over 200,000 applications,<ref name="200,000" /> with over 1 billion downloads.

This prevents compatibility among Java applications written for those platforms and those for the Android platform. Android only reuses the Java language syntax, but does not provide the full-class libraries and APIs bundled with Java SE or ME.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.javalobby.org/nl/archive/jlnews_20071113o.html | title=Google Android: Initial Impressions and Criticism | date=13 November 2007 | last=van Gurp|first=Jilles | work=Javalobby | quote=''Frankly, I don't understand why Google intends to ignore the vast amount of existing implementation out there.
