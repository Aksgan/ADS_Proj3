From its outset, emergent democracy has been seen arising most clearly among bloggers who, as a decentralized network of writers, can provide a fuller airing and development of ideas than can the relatively limited resources of traditional media.<ref>{{cite book | last = Gillmor | first = Dan | authorlink = Dan Gillmor | title = We the Media | publisher = O'Reilly | year = 2006 | isbn = 0596102275}}</ref> Supporters of the idea point to instances in which [[blogs|bloggers]] have brought about political change by posting about issues that mainstream media had not paid much attention to. The canonical example of emergent democracy was the December [[2002]] resignation of [[Trent Lott]] as [[Senate]] [[majority leader]] after bloggers publicized his praising of [[Strom Thurmond]]'s [[1948]] [[Racial segregation|segregation]]ist campaign for the [[President of the United States|presidency]].<ref>Gillmor, pp. 44–45</ref><ref>Shirky, pp. 61–66</ref> == History == Ito had been vocal about issues with Japanese democracy, and had spoken at Davos about how broken he felt Japanese democracy was. "Afterwards, Ms. Ogata, the former UN High Commissioner for Refugees told me that I should stop ranting as a Japanese and think more about global democracy and global issues," he posted. "These words stuck with me and last year I tried to think about blogs and emergent democracy outside of the Japanese context." <ref>{{cite web |url=http://joi.ito.com/weblog/2004/02/22/caring-about-th.html |title=Caring about the rest of the world |accessdate=February 22, 2004 |author=Joi Ito |authorlink=Joi Ito |date=2004-02-22 }}</ref> He organized a group effort to discuss and document the emergent democracy concept, using a term initially coined by [[Ross Mayfield]]. He announced meetings on his weblog, inviting his readers to attend a [[conference call]] that was augmented by [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] chat for posting realtime visual cues and backchannel conversation, and a [[wiki]] for gathering notes from the call. This "multimodal" approach was called a "happening" by Ross Mayfield.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/02/13/a_happening_on_emergent_democracy.html |title="happening" on "emergent democracy" |accessdate=March 5, 2007 |author=Joi Ito |authorlink=Joi Ito |date=2003-04-29 }}</ref> The conversation resulted in Ito's online article that generated discussions about the potential for weblogs and other [[social software]] tools to have an impact on participation in governance. The discussion and notes were captured in a paper that was placed on a wiki for collaborative editing and enhancement. [[Jon Lebkowsky]] edited the wiki version, and published it as a chapter in the 2005 book ''Extreme Democracy''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lebkowsky | first = Jon | authorlink = Jon Lebkowsky with Mitch Ratcliffe | title = Extreme Democracy | publisher = Lulu.com | year = 2005 | isbn = 1411631390}}</ref> A "[[teach-in]]" on that topic was held on February 9, 2004 as part of the [[O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://conferences.oreillynet.com/et2004/edemo.csp |title=Digital Democracy Teach-In |accessdate=February 9, 2004 |author=O'Reilly Publishing |authorlink=O'Reilly Publishing |date=2004-02-09 }}</ref> The emergent democracy paper was incubated within the O'Reilly Emerging Technologies framework along with Tim O'Reilly's [http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html "What is Web 2.0"]; the two can be considered as seminal works that influenced the emergence of today's social web. ==See also== *[[List of politics-related topics]] *[[Direct democracy]] *[[E-democracy]] *[[Open source governance]] *[[Panarchy]] *[[Second Superpower]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.extremedemocracy.com/ Extreme Democracy: A Collection of papers on Emergent Democracy and related concepts] *[http://extremedemocracy.com/chapters/Chapter%20One-Ito.pdf Emergent Democracy], pdf of [[Jon Lebkowsky]]'s edit of the paper that resulted from the Emergent Democracy discussions. *[http://www.wiki.demosphere.net Demosphere Project]—The wiki & global project to develop a community based democratic framework using [[open source]] and [[interactive]] software. *[http://conferences.oreillynet.com/et2004/edemo.csp O'Reilly Digital Democracy Teach-In] *[http://www.mindjack.com/feature/nodal.html Nodal Politics] {{DEFAULTSORT:Emergent Democracy}} [[Category:Blogs]] [[Category:Politics and technology]] [[Category:Democracy]] [[Category:Emergence|Democracy]] [[bg:Спонтанна демокрация]]</text> </page> <page> <id>12085</id> <title>EnABLE software</title> <text>{{notability|Products|date=May 2009}} '''''En''ABLE''' is a history matching and [[uncertainty]] software designed to be used in the [[Petroleum industry|oil and gas]] industry.

'''''En''ABLE''' is also used to quantify production estimates under reservoir [[uncertainty]]. As [[Petroleum|oil and gas]] resources are increasingly recovered from reservoirs whose behavior has considerable [[uncertainty]] the need to measure the [[uncertainty]] is increasing<ref>J.G.
