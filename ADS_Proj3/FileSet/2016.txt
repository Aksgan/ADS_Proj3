Saccheri's studies of the theory of parallel lines."}}</ref> In the 18th century, [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] introduced the [[hyperbolic functions]] and computed the area of a [[hyperbolic triangle]]. In the nineteenth century, hyperbolic geometry was extensively explored by [[János Bolyai]] and [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky]], after whom it sometimes is named. Lobachevsky published in 1830, while Bolyai independently discovered it and published in 1832. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] also studied hyperbolic geometry, describing in a 1824 letter to Taurinus that he had constructed it, but did not publish his work. In 1868, [[Eugenio Beltrami]] provided models of it, and used this to prove that hyperbolic geometry was consistent if Euclidean geometry was. The term "hyperbolic geometry" was introduced by [[Felix Klein]] in 1871.<ref>F. Klein, ''Über die sogenannte Nicht-Euklidische'', Geometrie, Math. Ann. 4, 573-625 (cf. Ges. Math. Abh. 1, 244-350).</ref> For more history, see article on [[non-Euclidean geometry]], and the references [[Coxeter]] and [[Milnor]]. == Models of the hyperbolic plane == [[Image:Hyperbolic tiling omnitruncated 3-7.png|thumb|250px|'''Poincaré disc model''' of great rhombitruncated {3,7} tiling]] [[Image:Poincare disc hyperbolic parallel lines.svg|thumb|250px|left|Lines through a given point and asymptotic to a given line, illustrated in the Poincaré disc model]] There are four [[Mathematical model|model]]s commonly used for hyperbolic geometry: the [[Klein model]], the [[Poincaré disc model]], the [[Poincaré half-plane model]], and the Lorentz model, or [[hyperboloid model]]. These models define a real [[hyperbolic space]] which satisfies the axioms of a hyperbolic geometry. Despite the naming, the two disc models and the half-plane model were introduced as models of hyperbolic space by Beltrami, not by Poincaré or Klein. # The '''[[Klein model]]''', also known as the '''projective disc model''' and '''[[Eugenio Beltrami|Beltrami]]-Klein model''', uses the interior of a circle for the hyperbolic [[plane (mathematics)|plane]], and [[chord (geometry)|chord]]s of the circle as lines. #* This model has the advantage of simplicity, but the disadvantage that [[angle]]s in the hyperbolic plane are distorted. #* The distance in this model is the [[cross-ratio]], which was introduced by [[Arthur Cayley]] in [[projective geometry]]. # The '''[[Poincaré disc model]]''', also known as the '''conformal disc model''', also employs the interior of a circle, but lines are represented by arcs of circles that are [[orthogonal]] to the boundary circle, plus diameters of the boundary circle. # The '''[[Poincaré half-plane model]]''' takes one-half of the Euclidean plane, as determined by a Euclidean line ''B'', to be the hyperbolic plane (''B'' itself is not included). #* Hyperbolic lines are then either half-circles orthogonal to ''B'' or rays perpendicular to ''B''. #* Both Poincaré models preserve hyperbolic angles, and are thereby [[conformal map|conformal]]. All isometries within these models are therefore [[Möbius transformation]]s. #* The half-plane model is identical (at the limit) to the Poincaré disc model at the edge of the disc # The '''Lorentz model''' or '''[[hyperboloid model]]''' employs a 2-dimensional [[hyperboloid]] of revolution (of two sheets, but using one) embedded in 3-dimensional [[Minkowski space]]. This model is generally credited to Poincaré, but Reynolds (see below) says that [[Wilhelm Killing]] and [[Karl Weierstrass]] used this model from 1872. #*This model has direct application to [[special relativity]], as Minkowski 3-space is a model for [[spacetime]], suppressing one spatial dimension. One can take the hyperboloid to represent the events that various moving observers, radiating outward in a spatial plane from a single point, will reach in a fixed [[proper time]]. The hyperbolic distance between two points on the hyperboloid can then be identified with the relative [[rapidity]] between the two corresponding observers. == Visualizing hyperbolic geometry == <!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Crochet model.jpg|thumb|250px|Crochet model of a hyperbolic plane]] --> [[Image:Escher Circle Limit III.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Circle Limit III'', 1959]] [[Image:Crochet hyperbolic kelp.jpg|250px|thumb|A collection of crocheted hyperbolic planes, in imitation of a coral reef, by the [[Institute For Figuring]]]] [[Image:Folded Coral Flynn Reef.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A coral with similar geometry on the [[Great Barrier Reef]]]] [[M. C. Escher]]'s famous prints ''Circle Limit III'' and [http://mcescher.com/Gallery/recogn-bmp/LW436.jpg ''Circle Limit IV''] illustrate the conformal disc model quite well. The white lines in ''III'' are not quite geodesics (they are [[hypercycle (geometry)|hypercycles]]), but are quite close to them. It is also possible to see quite plainly the negative [[curvature]] of the hyperbolic plane, through its effect on the sum of angles in triangles and squares. For example, in ''Circle Limit III'' every vertex belongs to three triangles and three squares. In the Euclidean plane, their angles would sum to 450°; i.e., a circle and a quarter. From this we see that the sum of angles of a triangle in the hyperbolic plane must be smaller than 180°. Another visible property is [[exponential growth]]. In ''Circle Limit III'', for example, one can see that the number of fishes within a distance of ''n'' from the center rises exponentially. The fishes have equal hyperbolic area, so the area of a ball of radius ''n'' must rise exponentially in ''n''. There are several ways to physically realize a hyperbolic plane (or approximation thereof). A particularly well-known paper model based on the [[pseudosphere]] is due to [[William Thurston]].
