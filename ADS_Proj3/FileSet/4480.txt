resembles an online diary. Entries are commonly displayed in reverse-chronological order. Originally hand-coded, there are now blogging tools (a kind of [[content management system]]) to facilitate searching and linking to other blogs. *[[CDDB]], a database for software applications to look up audio CD (compact disc) information over the Internet. * Hutchison Paging email gateway allows emails to be sent to message pagers in the UK. This same system worked with Orange mobile phones when they were launched in 1994, emails would arrive as texts. ==1992== *[[HTML]] was developed by a British engineer, Tim Berners-Lee while working in CERN. This was devised so that reports from CERN, including photographs, graphs and tables could be shared (served) across the web. ==1991== *[[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]]: A [[hypertext]] system which was soon largely replaced by the [[World Wide Web]]. ==1990== *[[ARPANET]] was retired and merged into the [[NSFNET]]. *[[IMDb]], the Internet Movie Database. ==1988== *[[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC): A form of real-time Internet text messaging (chat) or synchronous conferencing. It is mainly designed for group communication in discussion forums, called channels, but also allows one-to-one communication via private message. ==1986== * [[LISTSERV]] the first [[electronic mailing list]] software application, ==1983== *[[Internet]]: A global computer network which was created by interconnecting various existing networks with the [[TCP/IP]] protocol suite. ==1982== *First standardization of the [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]], a network transmission standard for the transport of [[email]]. ==1981== *[[Online banking]] starts being offered by [[Citibank]], [[Chase Manhattan]], [[Chemical Bank]] and [[Manufacturers Hanover]] in New York using the platform [[videotex]]. ==1979== *[[Usenet]]: A distributed threaded discussion and [[file sharing]] system; a collection of forums known as newsgroups, that was a precursor to today's web-based forums. One notable difference from a BBS or web forum is that there is no central system owner. Usenet is distributed among a large, constantly changing conglomeration of servers which store and forward messages to one another. ==1978== *[[MUD]]: First real-time, multi-player MUD adventure game was developed by Roy Trubshaw and Richard Bartle at Essex University, England. * In 1978 a team of programmers at the Post Office Research Station in Martlesham heath, Suffolk. Were recruited from within the Post Office Data Processing Executive to produced [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prestel PRESTEL] the first semi-graphical interface to the internet. Prior to this a service called 'Telecom Gold' - a bulletin board system like the AOL and Compuserve systems popular in the US was used. By 1982 the Prestel system was used throughout the UK for online purchase of books, shopping, holiday bookings etc. It used a 'page' system to navigate. Typing in the page number or clicking on the page number (only Apple's Lisa computer had windows and mouse in 1982) took you to that page, like HTML's hyperlinks do today. ==1973== *[[E-mail]]: First proposal for standardization of electronic mail message format in RFC 561. * ARPANET made its first international connection between University college in London and Royal Radar establishment in Norway. ==1971== *[[FTP]]: File Transfer Protocol *[[Project Gutenberg]], a volunteer effort to digitize and archive cultural works. ==1969== *[[Telnet]]: A system for logging in, over a network, to a computer situated in another location. * [[ARPANET]] connected Stanford research Institute in Santa Barbara to the University of Utah, the internet was born, although the first attempt actually crashed on the 'g' of the word 'Login' ==1960s== *[[Email]]: Electronic mail applications are developed on timesharing main frame computers for communication between system users. * The beginning of the internet can be traced back to 1962, when the RAND (America's military think tank) tackled the problem of how they could communicate in the aftermath of a nuclear attack, their thinking was prompted by the Cuban Missile Crisis. ==See also== *[[History of the Internet]] *[[List of Internet phenomena]] *[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prestel PRESTEL] [[Category:Internet]] [[Category:Computing timelines]]</text> </page> <page> <id>37806</id> <title>Timothy Cain</title> <text>{{About|the game producer|other people by the name of Tim Cain|Tim Cain (disambiguation) }} '''Timothy Cain''', often credited as '''Tim Cain''', was the [[game producer|producer]], [[lead programmer|lead]] [[game programmer|programmer]] and one of the main [[game designer|designers]] of the [[computer game]] ''[[Fallout (computer game)|Fallout]]''.
