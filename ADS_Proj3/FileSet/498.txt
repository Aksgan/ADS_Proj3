E-mail and to terminate employees for using company E-mail system for personal use. }} '''''Bourke v. Nissan Motor Corp., '''''No. B068705 (Cal. Ct. App., July 26, 1993), was a California court case in which the [[California Courts of Appeal|Second Appellate District Court of the California Courts of Appeal]] upheld the original decision of the trial court in favor of the defendant, [[Nissan Motors|Nissan Motor Corporation]], against the charges of the plaintiffs, who alleged wrongful termination, invasion of privacy, and violation of their constitutional right to privacy, under the California constitution, in connection with Nissan's retrieval, printing, and reading of [[E-mail]] messages authored by plaintiffs.<ref name="BourkeVNissan_Main_Case">''Bourke v.

In June 1990, a co-worker of plaintiffs, Lori Eaton, during a demonstration of the use of E-mail at a training session, randomly selected a message sent by Bourke to an employee of the dealership. Unfortunately, the E-mail contained non-business-related content of a highly personal, sexual nature. This incident was reported to management and many other messages containing personal content involving Bourke and her colleague Hall were later discovered. Following this, written warnings were issued to plaintiffs for violating the company policy prohibiting the use of the company computer system for personal purposes. During the annual performance review in October 1990, both plaintiffs had received rather low performance ratings (Bourke was rated “needs improvement,” and Hall was rated “unsatisfactory,” second lowest and lowest of six performance level, respectively). On December 28, 1990, plaintiffs filed grievances with Nissan's human resources department, complaining that the company had invaded their privacy by retrieving and reading their E-mail messages. A few days later, on January 2, 1991, Bourke was given a final warning notice requiring her to improve her performance, while Hall's employment was terminated. Based upon Nissan's actions in reviewing their E-mail messages as described above, plaintiffs sued Nissan for common law invasion of privacy, violation of their constitutional right to privacy, and violation of California's criminal wiretapping and eavesdropping statutes. They also brought a cause of action for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy (termination in retaliation for the filing of complaints objecting to Nissan's invasion of their privacy).<ref name="BourkeVNissan_Main_Case" /> ==Opinion of the Court== ===I. Common Law Invasion of Privacy and Violation of Constitutional Right to Privacy=== Regarding the application of common law vs. constitutional right, the court found that the constitutional right to privacy (stated in California Constitution, Article 1, section 1, "All people are by nature free and independent and have inalienable rights. Among these are enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining safety, happiness, and privacy") <ref>[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/.const/.article_1 California Constitution]</ref> is broader than, and encompasses, the [[Tort|common law tort]] of invasion of privacy (see ''Porten v. University of San Francisco'', 64 Cal. App. 3d 825, 829 (Cal. Ct. App. 1976)), thus analysis and discussion was restricted to the constitutional claim. The critical issues in judging of the violation of an individual's constitutional right to privacy depends first on a determination whether that individual had a personal objectively reasonable expectation of privacy which was infringed (see ''Alarcon v. Murphy'', 201 Cal.App.3d 1, 5 (Cal. Ct. App. 1988) and ''People ex rel. Franchise Tax Bd. v. Superior Court'', 164 Cal.App.3d 526 (Cal. Ct. App. 1985)).<ref name="EmailLimitWorkPlace">Mary E. Pivec and Susan Brinkerhoff, ''[http://www.abanet.org/irr/hr/winter99_pivec.html E-Mail in the Workplace: Limitations on Privacy]'' ABA Human Rights Magazine, Vol. 26, No. 1 (Winter 1999).</ref> The court found that the employees had no reasonable expectation of privacy, citing the following undisputed facts: (1) Plaintiffs each signed a Computer User Registration Form, which states that "[I]t is company policy that employees and contractors restrict their use of company-owned computer hardware and software to company business." (2) The two had been aware for months that E-mail messages were, from time to time, read by individuals other than the intended recipient. (3) In June 1990, a full six months before Bourke's termination, fellow employee, Lori Eaton, had contacted Bourke to complain about the personal, sexual nature of Bourke's E-mail message which Eaton had retrieved for demonstration purposes during a training session at an Infiniti dealership.<ref name="BourkeVNissan_Main_Case" /> Moreover, the fact that plaintiffs were given passwords to access the system and told to safeguard them did not move the court to find their privacy expectations reasonable (see ''Smyth v. Pillsbury Co.'', 914 F. Supp. 97 (E.D. Penn. 1996) [the employer's interest in preventing inappropriate communications over its E-Mail system outweighed any privacy interest by those employees who transmitted such communications]<ref name="EmailLimitWorkPlace" />). In the absence of a reasonable expectation of privacy, there can be no violation of the right to privacy (see ''Alarcon v. Murphy'', 201 Cal.App.3d 1, 5 (Cal. Ct. App. 1998)<ref name="OtherCasesSummary">Rania V.
