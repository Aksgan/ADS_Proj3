Therefore, handling a lever is a natural behavior that rats do as preparatory feeding activity, and in turn, lever pressing cannot logically be used as evidence for reward or reinforcement to occur. In the absence of evidence for reinforcement during operant conditioning, learning which occurs during operant experiments is actually only Pavlovian (classical) conditioning. The dichotomy between Pavlovian and operant conditioning is therefore an inappropriate separation. ==See also== {{Portal|Psychology}} {{multicol}} * [[Animal testing]] * [[Applied behavior analysis]], the application of operant behaviorism * [[Behaviorism]], the family of philosophies behind operant conditioning * [[Cognitivism (psychology)]], a competing theory that invokes internal mechanisms without reference to behavior * [[Educational psychology]] * [[Educational technology]] * [[Experimental analysis of behavior]] * [[Exposure therapy]] * [[Habituation]] {{multicol-break}} * [[Matching law]] * [[Negative (positive) contrast effect]] * [[Premack principle]] * [[Reinforcement learning]] * [[Reward system]] * [[Sensitization]] * [[Social conditioning]] * [[Spontaneous recovery]] {{multicol-end}} ==References== {{Reflist|2}} ==External links== * [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=PublicationURL&_issn=03766357&_pubType=J&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=f2cb4d6abf599fdb991a75e175d8189b&jchunk=50#50 Behavioural Processes] * [http://seab.envmed.rochester.edu/jaba/ Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis] * [http://seab.envmed.rochester.edu/jeab/ Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior] * [http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/proj/nru/nr.html Negative reinforcement] * [http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Operant_Conditioning Scholarpedia Operant conditioning] * [http://www.scienceofbehavior.com/lms/mod/glossary/view.php?id=408 scienceofbehavior.com] * [[Society for Quantitative Analysis of Behavior]][http://sqab.psychology.org/] * [http://foxylearning.com/vb An Introduction to Verbal Behavior Online Tutorial] * [http://foxylearning.com/rft An Introduction to Relational Frame Theory Online Tutorial] {{Learning}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Operant Conditioning}} [[Category:Dog training and behavior]] [[Category:Educational technology]] [[Category:Behaviorism]] [[Category:Learning]] [[bg:Оперантно кондициониране]] [[ca:Condicionament operant]] [[cs:Operantní podmiňování]] [[de:Instrumentelle und operante Konditionierung]] [[es:Condicionamiento operante]] [[fr:Conditionnement opérant]] [[ko:조작적 조건화]] [[is:Virk skilyrðing]] [[it:Condizionamento operante]] [[he:התניה אופרנטית]] [[nl:Operante conditionering]] [[ja:オペラント条件づけ]] [[no:Operant betinging]] [[pl:Warunkowanie instrumentalne]] [[pt:Condicionamento operante]] [[sr:Оперантно условљавање]] [[sv:Operant betingning]] [[zh:操作制約]]</text> </page> <page> <id>27602</id> <title>Operating model</title> <text>{{Multiple issues | cleanup=October 2010 | refimprove=October 2010 }} Operating Model is a term that is used in many contexts. An Operating Model is the abstract representation of how an organization operates across process, organization, technology domains in order to deliver value defined by the organization in scope. Any organization is a complex system consisting of several different interlinked logical components. An Operating Model breaks “this complex machinery” down into its logical components and deploys the appropriate analysis and design techniques for each component in order to deliver better value. An Operating Model can be used as a framework for formulating Operations Strategy – explicit choices about the best deployment of organization’s elements to achieve the business goals. It is usually informed by the Business Model. In some cases, an Operating Model can become the source of competitive advantage and can inform the Business Model. The Operating Model can be a vehicle product to describe how the organization does business today - the "as-is" Operating Model. This can be the foundation for an organization that wants to transform its business. New business drivers can be translated into requirements that can lead to a new "to-be" or "Target" Operating Model. The Target Operating Model represents the high level requirements that drive the future Business and IT Architecture design. ==Operating Model in Context== Several related terms are often used interchangeably to describe a business but are actually quite different as illustrated in Figure 1: * A [[Business Model]] describes the rationale of how an organization creates, delivers, and captures economic, social, or other forms of value. The process of Business Model design is part of business strategy. * An Operating Model describes the necessary level of business process integration and data standardization in the business and among trading partners and guides the underlying Business and Technical Architecture to effectively and efficiently realize its Business Model. The process of Operating Model design is also part of business strategy. * A [[Capability Management in Business|Capability Model]] describes the capabilities necessary to execute the Operating Model. The process of Capability Model design is part of Operations Planning. :::::'''Figure 1: Relationship between Operating Model and Capability Model''' [[File:CapabilityLandscapewithlabels.jpg]] ==Operating Model Defined== An Operating Model for a business is a '''strategic''' schematic which illustrates the '''relationships''' among the operating units and trading partners and provides a set of '''guidelines''' for both the business architecture and technology infrastructure that enable a company to grow its business either organically or through acquisitions. * '''Strategic''': an Operating Model is a strategic choice as to the extent of process standardization and data integration desired to achieve business results. * '''Relationships''': refers to the degree of cooperation across business units including customers, suppliers and trading partners, required for efficiency or leverage. * '''Guidelines''': clarify what is important for the organization today and the rationale for investments so that leaders are aligned. When the Operating Model is changed, the "to-be" model sheds light on the transformations required for future success and the decision process for investments among the units. ==History of Operating Model Development== ===Origins in Corporate Strategy=== Operating Model as defined here is similar to '''Corporate Strategy''': "the relationships among the businesses in the corporation's portfolio and the process by which investments will be determined among them."<ref>Richard Lynch, John Diezemann and James Dowling, The Capable Company: Building the capabilities that make strategy work (Wiley-Blackwell, 2003)</ref> There are three basic models: * '''Holding Company''': each business has wholly self-contained brands/businesses with dedicated core and support work. The businesses are tied together only by a common funding source and financial requirements (e.g., Tyco International) * '''Federated''' or '''Allied''': each business contains the core work required to create advantage autonomously. Issues of common interest are identified and worked among businesses. Support organizations develop uniform policies and practices across geographies, tailor them to meet the needs of each business and help achieve synergies across businesses where desired (e.g., access to customer, product files, needs to have own accounting
