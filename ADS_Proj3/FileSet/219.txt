They're too busy running to keep up with hardware requirements. Ts'o said that, although, "There's less than 64K of patch, there's been over 1,800 mail messages of discussion." Ts'o made it sound like the Android team is getting fed up with the process. "Android is a small team. They feel that they're spending a vast amount of time getting the code upstream (to the main Linux kernel)."'' |accessdate = 2011-01-02}}</ref> ==Claimed infringement of copyrights and patents== On 12 August 2010, [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], owner of Java since it acquired [[Sun Microsystems]] in April 2009, sued Google over claimed infringement of copyrights and patents.
