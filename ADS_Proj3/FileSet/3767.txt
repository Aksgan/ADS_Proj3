devices for regulating or controlling items or objects. Examples are a [[voltage regulator]] (which can be a [[transformer]] whose voltage ratio of transformation can be adjusted, or an [[electronic circuit]] that produces a defined voltage), a [[pressure regulator]], such as a [[diving regulator]], which maintains its output at a fixed pressure lower than its input, and a fuel regulator (which controls the supply of fuel). Regulators can be designed to control anything from gases or fluids, to light or electricity. Speed can be regulated by electronic, mechanical, or [[Electromechanics|electro-mechanical]] means. Such instances include; * Electronic regulators as used in modern railway sets where the voltage is raised or lowered to control the speed of the engine * Mechanical systems such as [[valves]] as used in fluid control systems. Purely mechanical pre-automotive systems included such designs as the [[Centrifugal governor|Watt centrifugal governor]] whereas modern systems may have electronic fluid speed sensing components directing [[solenoids]] to set the valve to the desired rate. * Complex electro-mechanical speed control systems used to maintain speeds in modern cars ([[cruise control]]) - often including hydraulic components, * An aircraft engine's [[constant speed unit]] changes the propellor pitch to maintain engine speed. ==See also== *[[Governor (device)]] *[[Process control]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Regulator (Automatic Control)}} [[Category:Control engineering]] [[ca:Regulador integrat]] [[es:Regulador]] [[fi:Säädin]] [[io:Regulatoro]] [[sv:Regulator (reglerteknik)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>31698</id> <title>Rei Toei</title> <text>'''Rei Toei''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Bridge trilogy]] of [[speculative fiction]] novels by [[William Gibson]]. Rei is introduced as the titular character in Gibson's 1995 novel ''[[Idoru]]'', as an [[artificial intelligence]], an [[embodied agent]] simulating a human female [[Japanese idol|idol singer]].<ref name=pop>{{cite book | last = Matrix | first = Sidney | title = Cyber Pop | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 0415976774 |page=105}}</ref> A [[personality construct]] which adapts and learns from her interaction with humans, she irresistibly attracts data analyst protagonist Colin Laney.<Ref name=pop/><ref>{{cite book | last = Rapatzikou | first = Tatiana | title = Gothic Motifs in the Fiction of William Gibson | publisher = Rodopi | location = Amsterdam | year = 2004 | isbn = 9042017619 |page=200}}</ref> ==Design== The [[Toei Company|Toei]] film and music company is a well known studio in Japan, with a well deserved international reputation. William Gibson imagined that by the time of his Bridge Trilogy, Japanese companies with a determined research direction would be producing products much like Rei Toei, given suitable funding through customer demand. Rei Toei is a [[database]] composite from the wireless broadband internet of Japan, and the world. She has been programmed to remind viewers of their favourite [[J-pop]] idols, which in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] are known as {{nihongo|''aidoru''|アイドル}} (sounding like the English ''Idol''). Her singing voice and performance styles are composites as well, giving her the ability to encompass the viewer's preference as well. In this way, her AI agent form is very similar to user accounts on a group-sharing [[Mainframe Computer]]. Implicit in her design is that she is not ''one'' Idoru, but ''many''. Individual viewers and fans will have a personalised Rei Toei album, video, and collection of images, as 'she' can be and is customised according to the tastes of viewers. Within the titular novel, it is implied that over-zealous fans have purposes that are threatening her and her parent company's reputations. The incipient scandal that might develop should Rei be successfully hacked and/or dbase-polluted are the reasons for the hiring of Colin Laney by Toei Ltd. ==Projection== By the time Rei Toei has become a commercial entity, commercial in-space animated full-colour holography is also a commercial reality. As noted above, a personalised Rei Toei exist for individual viewers with Net access. However, for public concerts, Rei will take on an appearance that is a group consensus based on the membership of her audience. ==The Expert's View== For most people, Rei Toei presents an aetherial effect on the sense based on her targeted AI, which modifies appearance based on Net profile of the user, which Rei can analyse on the fly and in real time, with multiple projections for multiple viewers, providing that the demands of viewer profile do not overload her system. Colin Laney is introduced as a quantitative data analyst. With experience in viewing databases and interpreting multiple interactions, he is conditioned through training and exposure to being able to analyze both data flow and potential errors in database queries, insertion of hacking routines, and other anomalies. His first interpretation of Rei is instructive, both in terms of himself and the Idoru's AI: "She shimmered, and Laney could detect just immediately below the threshold of consciousness a flow of data...." == Related topics == *[[Sharon Apple]] *[[Ananova]] *[[Hatsune Miku]] *[[Kyoko Date]] == Footnotes == {{refs}} == External links == *{{cite journal|url=http://www.depauw.edu/SFs/backissues/88/bolton%20intro.asp|journal=[[Science Fiction Studies]] |issue=88, part 3 |volume=29 |month=November |year=2002 |first=Christopher |last=Bolton |title=Editorial Introduction: The Borders of Japanese Science Fiction}} {{Gibsonian}} {{sf-char-stub}} {{Japan-culture-stub}} [[Category:Fictional artificial intelligences]] [[Category:William Gibson characters]] [[Category:Fictional anthropomorphic characters]] [[Category:Personifications]]</text> </page> <page> <id>31708</id> <title>Reinventing the wheel</title> <text>{{No footnotes|date=April 2009}} '''Reinventing the wheel''' is a phrase that means to duplicate a basic method that has already previously been created or optimized by others. The inspiration for this [[idiom]]atic [[metaphor]] lies in the fact that the [[wheel]] is the [[archetype]] of human ingenuity, both by virtue of the added power and flexibility it affords its users, and also in the ancient origins which allow it to underlie much, if not all, of modern [[technology]]. As it has already been invented, and is not considered to have any operational flaws, an attempt to reinvent it would be pointless and add no value to the object, and would be a waste of time, diverting the investigator's resources from possibly more worthy goals which his or her skills could advance more substantially. At the same time, however, "reinventing the wheel" is an important tool in the [[Education|instruction]] of complex ideas. Rather than providing students simply with a list of known facts and techniques and expecting them to incorporate these ideas perfectly and rapidly, the
