(IAS or IAUS) is a company with research and development in various industries, that has been involved in many ventures to design, produce, market, and sell high-technology products. It has been publicly traded since 1988, as a bulletin board stock (stock symbol IAUS.PK). The founder and major shareholder is [[Neldon Johnson]]. It is currently based in [[Salem, Utah| Salem]] in [[Utah]] where it was founded in 1987. == Products == ===Solar Power=== Since 2004, International Automated Systems has put most of its efforts into developing a [[solar power]]ed electricity generating system, based on solar heat collected by [[patent]]ed lenses and focused on a heat receiving system. This heat is then used to generate steam, which turns patented 'blade-less' [[turbine]]s, and generates [[electricity]]. [[Prototype]]s of this system have been demonstrated at several locations. A fully functional electricity generation system has been under construction since 2005 in [[Delta, Utah]]. ===Automated Retail=== Some of the products or potential products of International Automated Systems include an automated [[retail]] self-service [[checkout]] system and management software for retail establishments. A demonstration project for this was a grocery store called U-Check that was built and run in Salem, Utah. Portions of International Automated Systems' technology have been licensed to [[Optimal Robotics]] for an undisclosed amount of money. However, Optimal Robotics Corporation previously had designed and implemented their own self-check out system, which they reported to have developed completely independently of International Automated Systems. A press release by Optimal Robotics on January 24, 2004 states: "Optimal Robotics Corp. (NASDAQ: OPMR), today announced that it has entered into a settlement agreement with International Automated Systems, Inc. (IAS), which brings to a close the patent lawsuit between the parties. In accordance with the agreement, IAS will receive a sum that is not considered to be material to Optimal."<ref>http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-112640449.html</ref> ===Biometrics and Fingerprint Identification=== International Automated Systems developed a [[biometric]] device consisting of an automated [[fingerprint]] reader (AFIM = Automated Fingerprint Identification Machine) that was able to read a person's fingerprint, then use that information to create a specific, personalized code number, which could be stored in a small amount of digital space, such as on the [[magnetic strip]] of a credit card. People could then use other AFIM fingerprint scanners to identify themselves and purchase items or obtain access to controlled locations and devices in a secured way. ===Other Products=== The company currently is developing or has developed or partially developed products for airport [[security systems]]; automated restaurant systems; 'bladeless' turbines for electrical power generation; and solar technology systems for production of electricity and [[gasoline]]. ==External links== * [http://www.iaus.com Company Web Site] * [http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&sid=2893505 Story on NBC Affiliate KSL.com] Stock symbol IAUS.PK [[Category:Companies based in Utah]] [[Category:Technology companies of the United States]] [[Category:Renewable energy companies]] [[Category:Biometrics]] <references/></text> </page> <page> <id>18927</id> <title>International Automotive Task Force</title> <text>The '''International Automotive Task Force''' (IATF) is a group of automotive manufacturers which aims at providing improved quality products to automotive customers worldwide. ==Purposes of the IATF== * Develop a consensus regarding international fundamental quality system requirements, primarily for the participating companies’ direct suppliers of production materials, product or service parts or finishing services (e.g. heat treating, painting and plating). * Develop policies and procedures for the common IATF third party registration scheme to ensure consistency worldwide. * Provide appropriate training to support [[ISO/TS 16949]] requirements and the IATF registration scheme. * Establish formal liaisons with appropriate bodies to support IATF objectives. ==Members of the IATF== * [[DaimlerChrysler]], * [[Fiat]], * [[Ford Motor Company]], * [[General Motors]] (including [[Opel]] [[Vauxhall Motors]]), * [[PSA Peugeot Citroën]], * [[Renault]], * [[Volkswagen]]. ==See also== *[http://www.jama-english.jp/ Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, Inc.] ==References== [http://www.iaob.org/showPage.php Official website of the IATF] [[Category:Automotive industry]] [[Category:Production and manufacturing]] [[Category:Quality]] [[Category:Quality control]]</text> </page> <page> <id>18933</id> <title>International Biology Olympiad</title> <text>{{unreferenced|date=November 2006}} The '''International Biology Olympiad''' (IBO) is a [[International Science Olympiad|science olympiad]] for secondary school pupils. The first academic international Olympiads after the (originally Eastern European-based) [[International Mathematical Olympiad]] were launched under the auspices of the United Nations in the 1960s. The programs have gradually expanded to include more than 70 participating countries across five continents. The IBO is one of these olympiads. All participating countries send the four winners of their National Biology Olympiad to the IBO, accompanied by usually one team leader and two observers/jurors. ==Aims== The aims of the IBO are to promote a career in science for talented students and to stress the importance of biology in our current society. It also provides a great opportunity to compare educational methods and exchange experiences. This is useful information to improve biology education on a national level. Since the organization of every National Olympiad requires the cooperation of many institutions, such as [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]] of education, industry, teachers' associations, [[universities]] and schools, communication and cooperation between those institutions is promoted and intensified. Lastly, the IBO stimulates contact between students and teachers from many countries in a friendly environment. To demonstrate this, both students and teachers swear an oath of behaving ''according to the principles of fair play''. ==Procedure== The competition itself is composed of a theoretical and practical element. The theory exams cover a wide range of Biology: Cell Biology, Molecular Biology, Plant Anatomy and Physiology, Animal Anatomy and Physiology, Ethology, Genetics and Evolution, Ecology, and Biosystematics. The marks are scaled so that the theory and practical components each have a weighting of about fifty percent. All participants are ranked based on their individual scores. These are based on the results of a theoretical and a practical test, each making up approximately fifty percent of the final score. Gold
