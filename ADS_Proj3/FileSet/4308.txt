empiricism]]. In his undergraduate thesis, Chomsky attempted to construct a detailed grammar of Hebrew using Harris' methods. He tried to construct a system of rules for generating the phonetic forms of sentences, and to this end devised a system of recursive rules to describe the form and structure of sentences, organizing the devices in Harris' ''Methods'' differently for this purpose. In particular, Chomsky found that there were many different ways of presenting the grammar. He tried to develop an idea of 'simplicity' for grammars that could be used to sort out the "linguistically significant generalizations" from among the alternative possible sets of grammatical rules. Chomsky finished his Master's Thesis ''The Morphophonemics of Modern Hebrew'' in 1951. Chomsky continued his studies along these lines as a junior fellow at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], and became interested in developing a linguistic theory using a non-[[taxonomy|taxonomic]] approach and based on [[mathematical formalism]], a decisive break from the Bloomfieldian taxonomic structuralist tradition of linguistic analysis. During a productive year at Harvard, he wrote everything he had worked on so far in a gigantic oeuvre comprising close to 1000 typewritten pages, called ''The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory'' (''LSLT''). In 1955, with the help of Harris and [[Roman Jakobson]], Chomsky moved to [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]'s [[Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT|Research Laboratory of Electronics]] (RLE) as the in-house linguist in [[Victor Yngve]]'s mechanical translation project. The same year he submitted just the 9th chapter of ''LSLT'', titled ''Transformational Analysis'', as his doctoral dissertation and received his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania. But ''LSLT'' would not be published as a book until almost 20 years later in 1975. ==Publication== It was not ''LSLT'', but ''Syntactic Structures'' that was Chomsky's first ever published book, a short [[monograph]] that distilled the concepts presented in ''LSLT''. It was not published in the [[United States]], rather in the [[Netherlands]] by a Dutch publishing house, [[Mouton de Gruyter|Mouton]]. In 1956, Chomsky showed his lecture notes for MIT undergraduates to an editor of Mouton<ref>See a scan of Chomsky's own typewritten letter to Mouton editor Cornelis van Schooneveld here: [http://bc.ub.leidenuniv.nl/bc/tentoonstelling/mountco/Images/htmpagina/mountco_18.htm http://bc.ub.leidenuniv.nl/bc/tentoonstelling/mountco/Images/htmpagina/mountco_18.htm]</ref> and a revised version of these notes were published as ''Syntactic Structures'' in the first week of February, 1957 in the Netherlands.<ref>There are at least two accounts from Chomsky on this subject. In Chomsky 1975:3, Chomsky writes: "In 1956, at the suggestion of Morris Halle, I showed some of my lecture notes for an undergraduate course at MIT to Cornelis van Schooneveld, the editor of the Janua Linguarum series of Mouton and he offered to publish them. A slightly revised version appeared in 1957, under the title ''Syntactic Structures''." In a more recent interview Dillinger & Palácio 1997:162-163, Chomsky said: "At the time Mouton was publishing just about anything, so they decided they’d publish it along with a thousand other worthless things that were coming out. That’s the story of Syntactic Structures: course notes for undergraduate science students published by accident in Europe." Read more about this in Noordegraaf 2001 and van Schooneveld 2001.</ref> Favorable reviews from fellow American linguists, like Lees 1957 above, made ''Syntactic Structures'' visible on the linguistic research landscape, and shortly thereafter the book created a [[Paradigm shift|revolution]] in the discipline. <ref>Searle 1972 and Newmeyer 1996</ref> ==Overview of topics in ''Syntactic Structures''== In ''Syntactic Structures'', Chomsky tries to construct a "formalized theory of linguistic structure" and places emphasis on "rigorous formulations" and "precisely constructed models".<ref>Chomsky 1957: Preface</ref> ===Justification of grammars=== Chomsky writes that his "fundamental concern" is "the problem of justification of grammars". He defines "a grammar of the language L" as "essentially a theory of L", as well as "a device that generates all of the grammatical sequences of L and none of the ungrammatical ones". Talking about the goals of linguistic theory, he draws parallels to theories in physical sciences. He compares a finite corpus of utterances of a particular language to "observations", grammatical rules to "laws" which are stated in terms of "hypothetical constructs" such as phonemes, phrases, etc.<ref>Chomsky 1957: 49</ref> According to Chomsky, the criteria for the "justification of grammars" are "external conditions of adequacy", "condition of generality" and "simplicity". To choose which is the best grammar for a given corpus of a given language, Chomsky shows his preference for the "evaluation procedure" (which chooses the best possible grammar for a language against the aforementioned criteria) over the "discovery procedure" (a procedure employed in [[structural linguistics]] which is supposed to automatically produce the correct grammar of a language from a corpus) or the "decision procedure" (a procedure which is supposed to automatically choose the best grammar for a language from a set of competing grammars).<ref>Chomsky 1957: 49-56</ref> ===Grammaticality=== According to Chomsky, "the fundamental aim in the linguistic analysis of a language L is to separate the grammatical sequences which are the sentences of L from the ungrammatical sequences which are not sentences of L and to study the structure of the grammatical sequences."<ref name="ss">Chomsky 1957: 13</ref> By "grammatical" Chomsky means "acceptable to a native speaker".<ref name="ss" /> Analyzing further about the basis of grammaticality, Chomsky shows three ways that do ''not'' determine whether a sentence is grammatical or not: its inclusion in a corpus, it being meaningful, and it being statistically probable. To illustrate his point, Chomsky presents a nonsensical sentence "[[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously]]"<ref>Chomsky 1957: 15</ref> and says that even though the sentence is grammatical, it is not included in any known corpus at the time and is neither meaningful nor statistically probable. Chomsky concludes that "grammar is autonomous and independent of meaning, and that probabilistic models give no particular insight into some of the basic problems of syntactic structure." <ref>Chomsky 1957: 17</ref> ===Grammar models=== Assuming that a set of "grammatical" sentences of a language has been given, Chomsky then tries to figure out what sort of device or model gives an adequate account of this set of utterances. To this end, he first discusses [[finite state grammar]], a [[A Mathematical Theory of Communication|communication theoretic]] model based on a conception of language
