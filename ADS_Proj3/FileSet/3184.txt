Nir Shavit received B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Computer Science from the [[Technion - Israel Institute of Technology]] in 1984 and 1986, and a Ph.D. in [[Computer Science]] from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] in 1990. Shavit is a co-author of the book ''The Art of Multiprocessor Programming'', and is a winner of the 2004 [[Gödel Prize]] in theoretical computer science for his work on applying tools from algebraic topology to model shared memory computability. He is a past program chair of the ACM [[Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing]] (PODC) and the ACM [[Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures]] (SPAA). His research covers techniques for designing, implementing, and reasoning about multiprocessors, and in particular the design of [[concurrent data structure]]s for [[multi-core]] machines. His notable contributions include the introduction and first implementation of [[Software Transactional Memory]]. ==Recognition== * [[2004]] [[Gödel prize]] ==External links== *[http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~shanir/ Website] {{Gödel winners}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Shavit, Nir}} [[Category:Electrical engineering academics]] [[Category:Gödel Prize laureates]] [[Category:Researchers in distributed computing]] [[Category:Hebrew University of Jerusalem alumni]] [[Category:Israeli academics]] [[Category:Living people]] {{Israel-bio-stub}} [[es:Nir Shavit]] [[he:ניר שביט]]</text> </page> <page> <id>26468</id> <title>No-broadcast theorem</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=August 2008}} The '''no-broadcast theorem''' is a result in [[quantum information science|quantum information theory]]. In the case of [[pure state|pure quantum states]], it is a [[theorem|corollary]] of the [[no cloning theorem]]: since [[quantum state]]s cannot be copied in general, they cannot be broadcast. For mixed states, it generalizes no-cloning. The no-cloning theorem says that it is impossible to create two copies of a state given a single copy of the state. The no-broadcast theorem says that, given a single copy of a state, it is impossible to create a state such that one part of it is the same as the original state and the other part is also the same as the original state. I.e., given an initial state <math>\rho_1</math> it is impossible to create a state <math>\rho_{AB}</math> such that <math>Tr_A\rho_{AB}=\rho_1</math> and <math>Tr_B\rho_{AB}=\rho_1</math>. Although here we work with mixed states, a broadcasting machine would have to work on any pure state ensemble of <math>\rho_1</math>. ==See also== * [[No-communication theorem]] * [[Quantum teleportation]] * [[Quantum entanglement]] * [[Quantum information]] * [[Uncertainty principle]] ==References== ''Noncommuting Mixed States Cannot Be Broadcast'', [[Howard Barnum|H.
