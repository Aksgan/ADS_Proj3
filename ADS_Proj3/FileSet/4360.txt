in the square configuration.]] The '''tangram''' ({{zh|c=七巧板|p=qī qiǎo bǎn|l=seven boards of skill}}) is a [[dissection puzzle]] consisting of seven flat shapes, called ''tans'', which are put together to form shapes. The objective of the puzzle is to form a specific shape (given only an outline or silhouette) using all seven pieces, which may not overlap. It was originally invented in [[China]] at some unknown point in history, and then carried over to [[Europe]] by trading ships in the early 19th century. It became very popular in Europe for a time then, and then again during [[World War I]]. It is one of the most popular [[dissection puzzle]]s in the world.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Tao of Tangram|last=Slocum|first=Jerry|year=2001|publisher=Barnes & Noble|isbn=978-1-4351-0156-2|page=9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Manual of Play|last=Forbrush|first=William Byron|year=1914|publisher=Jacobs|page=315|url=http://books.google.com/?id=FpoWAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA315&dq=%22The+Anchor+Puzzle%22#v=onepage&q=%22The%20Anchor%20Puzzle%22&f=false|accessdate=10/13/10}}</ref> ==History== ===Reaching the Western world (1815–1820s)=== [[File:Tangram caricature France 1818.jpg|thumb|290px|left|A caricature published in France in 1818, when the Tangram craze was at its peak. The caption reads: " 'Take care of yourself, you're not made of steel. The fire has almost gone out and it is winter.' 'It kept me busy all night. Excuse me, I will explain it to you. You play this game, which is said to hail from China. And I tell you that what Paris needs right now is to welcome that which comes from far away.' "]] The tangram had already been around in China for a long time when it was first brought to America by Captain M. Donnaldson, on his ship, ''Trader'', in 1815. When it docked in Canton, the captain was given a pair of Sang-hsia-k'o's Tangram books from 1815.<ref name="tanbook1">{{cite book |title=The Tangram Book|last=Slocum|first=Jerry|year=2003|publisher=Sterling|isbn=049725504134|page=30}}</ref> They were then brought with the ship to Philadelphia, where it docked in February 1816. The first Tangram book to be published in America was based on the pair brought by Donnaldson. The puzzle was originally popularized by ''The Eighth Book Of Tan'', a fictitious history of Tangram, which claimed that the game was invented 4,000 years prior by a god named Tan. The book included 700 shapes, some of which are impossible to solve.<ref name="isbn0-486-29225-8">{{cite book|author=Costello, Matthew J. |title=The Greatest Puzzles of All Time |publisher=Dover Publications |location=New York |isbn=0-486-29225-8|year=1996}}</ref> [[File:The 8th Book of Tan Part I.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Cover art from "The 8th Book of Tan", by [[Sam Loyd]], a spoof of the puzzle's history that began the Tangram Craze in the Western World]] The puzzle eventually reached England, where it became very fashionable indeed.<ref name="tanbook1"/> The craze quickly spread to other European countries.<ref name="tanbook1"/> This was mostly due to a pair of British Tangram books, ''The Fashionable Chinese Puzzle'', and the accompanying solution book, ''Key''.<ref name="tanbook2">{{cite book |title=The Tangram Book|last=Slocum|first=Jerry|year=2003|publisher=Sterling|isbn=049725504134|page=31}}</ref> Soon, tangram sets were being exported in great number from China, made of various materials, from glass, to wood, to tortoise shell.<ref name="tanbook3">{{cite book |title=The Tangram Book|last=Slocum|first=Jerry|year=2003|publisher=Sterling|isbn=049725504134|page=49}}</ref> Many of these unusual and exquisite tangram sets made their way to [[Denmark]].
