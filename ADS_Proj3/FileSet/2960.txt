However, these apps are static and provide little data interactivity. Data is viewed just as it would be over a browser from a personal computer. Little additional effort is required to display data but mobile browsers can typically only support a small subset of the interactivity of a web browser. * '''Customized App''': A step up from this approach is to render each (or all) reports and dashboards in device-specific format. In other words provide information specific to the screen size, optimize usage of screen real estate, and enable device-specific navigation controls. Examples of these include thumb wheel or thumb button for BlackBerry, up/down/left/right arrows for Palm, gestural manipulation for iPhone. This approach requires more effort than the previous but no additional software. * '''Mobile Client App''': The most advanced, the client app provides full interactivity with the BI content viewed on the device. In addition, this approach provides periodic caching of data which can be viewed and analyzed even offline.<ref>[http://blogs.forrester.com/business_process/2009/11/not-all-mobile-bi-applications-are-created-equal.html Not all BI Applications are Created Equal]</ref> Companies across all verticals, from retail<ref>[http://intelligent-enterprise.informationweek.com/channels/business_intelligence/customer_intelligence/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=ZIXKX1N5D25C1QE1GHOSKHWATMY32JVN?articleID=207801077&pgno=2 Intelligence on the Go: Mobile Delivery of BI]</ref> to even non-profit organizations<ref>[http://napps.networkworld.com/news/2010/071410-mobile-bi-can-be-quick.html Mobile BI can be Quick]</ref> are realizing the value of purpose-specific mobile applications suited for their mobile workforce. ===Development=== Developing a native mobile BI app poses challenges, especially concerning data display rendering and user interactivity. Mobile BI App development has traditionally been a time-consuming and expensive effort requiring businesses to justify worth the investment for the mobile workforce. They do not only require texting and alerts, they need information customized for their line of work which they can interact with and analyze to gain deeper information.<ref name="searchcio.techtarget.com"/> '''Custom-coded Mobile BI Apps''' Mobile BI applications are often custom coded apps specific to the underlying mobile operating system. For example, the iPhone apps require coding in [[Objective-C]] while Android apps require coding in Java. In addition to the user functionality of the app, the app must be coded to work with the supporting server infrastructure required to serve data to the mobile BI app. While custom coded apps offer near limitless options, the specialized software coding expertise and infrastructure can be expensive to development, modify, and maintain. '''Fixed-formed Mobile BI Apps''' Business data can be displayed in a mobile BI client that serves as a user interface to existing BI platforms, eliminating the need for specialized server infrastructure since it is provided by the BI platform. This option offer fixed-formed data visualizations such as charts and tables. However, the data visualizations are limited and cannot be extended to beyond what is available. The mobile BI app cannot be customized for specific business workflows or branded to the customer’s needs. '''Graphical Tool-developed Mobile BI Apps''' Mobile BI apps can also be developed using the graphical, drag-and-drop development environments of BI platforms. The advantages including the following: # Apps can be developed without coding, # Apps can be easily modified and maintained using the BI platform change management tools, # Apps can use any range of data visualizations and not be limited to just a few, # Apps can incorporate specific business workflows, and # The BI platform provides the server infrastructure. Using graphical BI development tools allows faster mobile BI app development while providing the flexibility needed to address specific business requirements. ==Security Considerations for Mobile BI Apps== High adoption rates and reliance on mobile devices makes safe mobile computing a critical concern.<ref>[http://gigaom.com/2010/09/09/mobile-security-needs-rise-with-smartphone-sales/ Mobile Security Needs Rise With Smartphone Sales]</ref> The Mobile Business Intelligence Market Study discovered that security is the number one issue (63%) for organizations.<ref>[http://businesssintelligence.blogspot.com/ Business Intelligence Blog by Howard Dresner]</ref> A comprehensive mobile security solution must provide security at these levels:<ref name="na.blackberry.com">[http://na.blackberry.com/ataglance/get_the_facts/Successful_Mobile_Deployments.pdf Successful Mobile Deployments Require Robust Security]</ref> * Device * Transmission * Authorization, Authentication, and Network Security '''Device Security''' Senior analyst at the Burton Group research firm recommends that the best way to ensure data will not be tampered with is to not store it on the client device (mobile device).
