a matrix with M x N cross-points or places where the "bars" cross. At each crosspoint is a switch; when closed, it connects one of M inputs to one of N outputs. A given crossbar is a single layer, non-blocking switch. Collections of crossbars can be used to implement multiple layer and/or blocking switches. A crossbar switching system is also called a co-ordinate switching system. ==Applications== Crossbar switches are most famously used in information processing applications such as telephony and packet switching, but they are also used in applications such as mechanical sorting machines with inputs. The matrix layout of a crossbar switch is also used in some [[semiconductor memory]] devices (see [[nanotechnology]]). Here the "bars" are extremely thin metal "wires", and the "switches" are [[fusible link]]s. The fuses are blown or opened using high voltage and read using low voltage. Such devices are called [[programmable read-only memory]].<ref>Yong Chen, Gun-Young Jung, Douglas A A Ohlberg, Xuema Li, Duncan R Stewart, Jan O Jeppesen, Kent A Nielsen, and J Fraser Stoddart, Nanoscale molecular-switch crossbar circuits, 2003 ''Nanotechnology'' 14 462-468</ref> At the 2008 NSTI Nanotechnology Conference a paper was presented which discussed a nanoscale crossbar implementation of an adding circuit used as an alternative to logic gates for computation.<ref> {{Cite web |url=http://www.nsti.org/Nanotech2008/showabstract.html?absno=119 |title=Logicless Computational Architectures with Nanoscale Crossbar Arrays |last=Mouttet |first=B. |publisher=NSTI Nanotech 2008 Conference |date=2008-06-02 |accessdate=2008-06-02}} </ref> Furthermore, matrix arrays are fundamental to modern flat-panel displays. Thin-film-transistor LCDs have a transistor at each crosspoint, so they could be considered to include a crossbar switch as part of their structure. For video switching in home and professional theater applications, a crossbar switch (or a matrix switch, as it is more commonly called in this application) is used to make the output of multiple video appliances available simultaneously to every monitor or every room throughout a building. In a typical installation, all the video sources are located on an equipment rack, and are connected as inputs to the matrix switch. Where central control of the matrix is practical, a typical rack-mount matrix switch offers front-panel buttons to allow manual connection of inputs to outputs. An example of such a usage might be a sports bar, where numerous programs are displayed simultaneously. In order to accomplish this, a sports bar would ordinarily need to purchase a separate cable or satellite subscription for each display for which independent control is desired. The matrix switch enables the signals to be re-routed on a whim, thus allowing the establishment to purchase only those subscriptions needed to cover the total number of ''unique'' programs viewed anywhere in the building. Such switches are used in high-end home theater applications. Video sources typically shared include set-top cable/satellite receivers or DVD changers; the same concept applies to audio as well. The outputs are wired to televisions in individual rooms. The matrix switch is controlled via an [[Ethernet]] or [[RS-232]] serial connection by a whole-house automation controller, such as those made by [[AMX]], [[Crestron]], or [[Control4]] - which provides the user interface that enables the user in each room to select which appliance to watch. The actual user interface varies by system brand, and might include a combination of on-screen menus, touch-screens, and handheld remote controls. The system is necessary to enable the user to select the program they wish to watch from the same room they will watch it from, otherwise it would be necessary (and arguably absurd) for them to walk to the equipment rack. The special crossbar switches used in distributing satellite TV signals are called [[Multiswitch]]es. ==Implementations== Historically, a crossbar switch consisted of metal bars associated with each input and output, together with some means of controlling movable contacts at each cross-point. In the later part of the 20th Century these literal crossbar switches declined and the term came to be used figuratively for rectangular array switches in general. Modern "crossbar switches" are usually implemented with semiconductor technology. An important emerging class of optical crossbars is being implemented with [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] technology. ===Mechanical=== A type of middle 19th Century telegraph exchange consisted of a grid of vertical and horizontal brass bars with a hole at each intersection. The operator inserted a brass pin to connect one telegraph line to another. ===Electromechanical/telephony=== A telephony crossbar switch is an [[Electromechanics|electromechanical]] device for [[telephone switch|switching]] [[telephone]] calls. The first design of what is now called a crossbar switch was [[Western Electric]]'s "coordinate selector" of 1915. It was little used in America, but the LM [[Ericsson]] company used an improved version for rural exchanges in Sweden. To save money on control systems, this system was organized on the [[stepping switch]] or selector principle rather than the link principle. The system design used in [[AT&T]]'s [[1XB]] crossbar exchanges, which entered revenue service from 1938, was developed by [[Bell Telephone Labs]], based on the rediscovered link principle. Delayed by the Second World War, several millions of urban 1XB lines were installed from the 1950s in the [[United States]]. Crossbar switching quickly spread to the rest of the world, replacing most earlier designs like the [[Strowger switch|Strowger]] and [[Panel switch|Panel]] systems in larger installations in the U.S. Graduating from entirely electromechanical control on introduction, they were gradually elaborated to have full electronic control and a variety of [[calling feature]]s including short-code and speed-dialing. In the UK the [[Plessey]] Company produced a range of crossbar exchanges, but their widespread rollout by the British Post Office began later than in other countries, and then was inhibited by the parallel development of [[TXE]] [[reed relay]] and electronic exchange systems, so they never achieved a large number of customer connections although they did find some success as [[tandem switch]] exchanges. <!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Crossbar2.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Crossbar switch]] --> Crossbar switches use switching matrices made from a two-dimensional array of [[contact]]s arranged in an x-y format. These switching matrices are operated by a series of horizontal bars arranged over the contacts. Each such "select" bar can be rocked up or down by [[electromagnet]]s to provide access to two
