The first model was launched in 1985 as a high-end home computer and became popular for its impressive graphical, audio and multi-tasking abilities. The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from 8-bit computers, such as the [[Commodore 64]], and the platform quickly grew in popularity among computer enthusiasts. The best selling model, the [[Amiga 500]], was introduced in 1987 and became the leading home computer of the late 1980s and early 1990s in much of Western Europe. In [[North America]] success was more modest. The Amiga went on to sell approximately six million units.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/total-share.ars | title=Total share: 30 years of personal computer market share figures | author=Jeremy Reimer | work=Ars Technica | accessdate=2008-04-21}}</ref> Second generation Amiga systems ([[Amiga 1200|A1200]] and [[Amiga 4000|A4000]]) were released in 1992. However, poor marketing and failure to repeat the technological advances of the first systems meant that the Amiga quickly lost its market share to competing platforms, such as the [[fourth generation game console]]s and [[IBM PC compatible]]s. Based on the [[Motorola 68000 family|Motorola 68000 series]] of [[microprocessor]]s, the machine sports a [[original Amiga chipset|custom chipset]] with graphics and sound capabilities that were unprecedented for the price, and a [[pre-emptive multitasking]] [[operating system]] (now known as [[AmigaOS]]). The Amiga was particularly popular for gaming and [[demoscene]] activities. It also found a prominent role in the [[desktop video]], [[video production]], and [[show control]] business, leading to affordable video editing systems such as the [[Video Toaster]]. It was also a less expensive alternative to the [[Apple Macintosh]] and [[IBM-PC]] as a general-purpose business or home computer. The Amiga's native ability to play back several channels of digital samples made it a popular platform for early "[[Tracker (music software)|tracker]]" music software, and the machine's relatively powerful processor and ability to access several megabytes of memory led to the development of several 3D rendering packages, including [[LightWave 3D]] and [[Aladdin 4D]]. The Amiga was most commercially successful as a home computer, with a wide range of games and creative software, although early Commodore advertisements attempted to cast the computer as an all-purpose business machine.<ref>[http://youtube.com/watch?v=PsJ0ZZMuEQs YouTube.com], Commodore advert 1987 - ''Celebrities''</ref><ref>[http://youtube.com/watch?v=ludrX2s1ZuM YouTube.com], Commodore advert 1987 - TV spot version of 20-minute presentation</ref> Since the demise of Commodore, various groups have marketed successors to the original Amiga line. [[Eyetech]] sold PowerPC based hardware under the [[AmigaOne]] brand from 2002 to 2005. A-Cube sell the Amiga compatible [[Sam440]] PowerPC board with the [[AmigaOS 4.1]]. The name ''Amiga'' was chosen by the developers specifically from the Spanish word for a female friend,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/ahistory.html | title=The Twists and Turns of the Amiga Saga | work=Amiga History Guide | author=Gareth Knight | accessdate=2008-04-21}}</ref><!--NB yes there are several other languages that use the same word, but the Amiga developers only knew Spanish and so that's the derivation.

It was initially intended to be a next generation [[video game]] machine, but was later redesigned as a general purpose computer.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.amigau.com/aig/prototypes/lorraine.html | title=Amiga Lorraine | work=Amiga History Guide | author=Gareth Knight | accessdate=2008-04-21}}</ref><ref>[http://www.amigaforever.com/games/ AmigaForever.com<!-- Bot generated title -->], Amiga Forever - Amiga Games</ref> In order to bring the design to market [[Commodore International]] bought Amiga Corporation and funded development. The first model was released in 1985 as simply "The Amiga from Commodore", later to be retroactively dubbed the [[Amiga 1000]]. The following year the Amiga product line was expanded with the introduction of two new models; the [[Amiga 2000]] for high-end graphics and business use, and the [[Amiga 500]] for home use. Commodore later released other Amiga models, both for low-end gaming use and high-end productivity use. In 1994, Commodore filed for bankruptcy and its assets were purchased by [[Escom (computer corp)|Escom]], a German PC manufacturer, who created the subsidiary company Amiga Technologies. They re-released the A1200 and A4000T, and introduced a new [[68060]] version of the A4000T. However, Escom in turn went bankrupt in 1997. The Amiga brand was then sold to another PC manufacturer, [[Gateway 2000]],
