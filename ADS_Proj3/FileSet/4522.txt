for items, following clues as a group or splitting into teams to race to a prize. An armchair treasure hunt is any activity that requires solving [[puzzle]]s or [[riddle]]s in some easily portable and widely reproduced format (often an illustrated children's book), and then using clues hidden either in the story or the graphics of the book to find a real treasure somewhere in the physical world. However, although these may seem to be for children, this genre is aimed at dedicated adults. ==Adult games== [[Image:Geocaching.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[Geocaching|Geocache]] in [[Germany]].]] The use of a treasure hunt as a party game is attributed to socialite [[Elsa Maxwell]]. She said that: :''In the Treasure Hunt . . . intellectual men were paired off with great beauties, glamor with talent. In the course of the night's escapades anything could happen.''<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,796902-2,00.html Time article ''Elsa at War''] retrieved April 10, 2007</ref> Adult treasure hunts are becoming increasingly popular {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. Some {{Who|date=May 2010}} theorize this is due to the extended adolescence. Others {{Who|date=May 2010}} cite the difficulty in meeting new people with the breakdown of traditional community organizations. Regardless, more adults find themselves participating in enormous city wide treasure and scavenger hunts like those of Treasure War Network in New Jersey. There is a growing market for treasure hunts consisting of fixed landmarks in the real world, rather than a specially-laid trail at a particular event. Companies are providing these hunts as corporate team building activities in cities around the world with London, Dublin and Sydney key examples. One of these companies is Events4teams [http://www.events4teams.co.uk Events4teams.co.uk] which provides DIY hunts in 12 locations around the UK. [[Geocaching]] is an outdoor treasure-hunting game in which the participants use a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver or other navigational techniques to hide and seek containers (called "geocaches" or "caches") anywhere in the world. An armchair treasure hunt uses a book or a puzzle as basis, in which clues are hidden. This type of Treasure Hunt normally takes months to solve and has immense prizes to be won. [[Online Treasure Hunts]] are a new development where participants follow clues and visit different websites (or even physical locations) to solve riddles. Participants can win prizes for correctly solving puzzles to win treasure hunts. Many of these online hunts are subject to internet gaming laws that vary between jurisdiction. An example is [[CashTreasureHunt.com]]<ref>[http://www.cashtreasurehunt.com Cash Treasure Hunt] retrieved September 2, 2010</ref>. [[Letterboxing]] is another treasure hunt game. It is played outdoors and combines elements of [[orienteering]], art and problem-solving. Letterboxers hide small, [[weatherproof]] boxes in publicly-accessible places (like parks) and distribute clues to finding the box in printed catalogs, on one of several web sites (see below), or by word of mouth. Individual letterboxes usually contain a logbook and a rubber stamp. A [[photo treasure hunt]] is a new way to play the well-known Treasure Hunt game. The main difference between them is that in a Photo Treasure Hunt the competitors have to collect pictures rather than collecting items.{{fact|date=June 2010}} In 1956, comedian [[Jan Murray]] created and hosted a variation for television, also known as ''[[Treasure Hunt (television)|Treasure Hunt]]''. The game pitted a pair of contestants answering questions to qualify to go on a "treasure hunt" that involved choosing from among thirty treasure chests that included anything from gag prizes to valuable merchandise and/or cash. The show also offered home viewers a chance for a treasure hunt, when a postcard was chosen from a large drum by a young guest who revolved the drum several times to mix up the entries. The show aired daily in the morning and once a week in the evening until 1959, when the networks began cancelling game shows offering sizeable-valued prizes in the wake of the [[quiz show scandal]]. == See also == * [[Encounter (game)]] ==References== <references/> {{DEFAULTSORT:Treasure Hunt (Game)}} [[Category:Outdoor locating games]] [[Category:Children's games]] [[Category:Lotteries]] [[fr:Chasse au trésor]] [[it:Caccia al tesoro]] [[he:חפש את המטמון]] [[pl:Szukanie skarbu]] [[pt:Peddy-paper]] [[zh:尋寶]]</text> </page> <page> <id>38186</id> <title>Treasure hunting</title> <text>{{mergefrom|Treasure hunting (marine)|date=January 2011}} {{No footnotes|date=May 2009}} {{redirect4|Treasure hunt|Treasure hunters}} '''Treasure hunting''' is the search for real [[treasure]] which has been a notable human activity for [[millennia]]. <!-- It would be good to give an example from history, but I can't off the top of my head think of one; the looting of the tombs in the Valley of the Kings doesn't quite count. --> ==In modern times== In recent times, the early stages of the development of [[archaeology]] included a significant aspect of treasure hunt; [[Heinrich Schliemann]]'s excavations at [[Troy]], and later at [[Mycenae]], both turned up significant finds of [[gold]]en artifacts. Early work in [[Egyptology]] also included a similar motive.{{Fact|date=October 2008}} More recently, most serious treasure hunters have started working underwater,{{Fact|date=October 2008}} where modern technology allows access to wrecks containing valuables which were previously inaccessible. Starting with the [[Standard diving dress|diving suit]], and moving on through [[Scuba diving|Scuba]] and later to [[Remotely operated vehicle#Submersible ROVs|ROVs]], each new generation of technology has made more wrecks accessible. Many of these wrecks have resulted in the [[treasure salvage]] of many fascinating artifacts from Spanish treasure fleets as well as many others.{{Fact|date=October 2008}} ==Notable treasure hunters == [[Image:Heinrich Schliemann.jpg|thumb|200px|Treasure hunter [[Heinrich Schliemann]].]] * [[Mel Fisher]] (discoverer of the Spanish galleon ''[[Nuestra Señora de Atocha]]'') * [[Cork Graham]] ([[war correspondent#Notable war correspondents|war correspondent]], author) * [[Mike Hatcher]] (discoverer of the "Nanking Cargo") * [[Ponce de Leon]] (searched the new world for gold and the [[Fountain of Youth]]) * [[Robert F.
