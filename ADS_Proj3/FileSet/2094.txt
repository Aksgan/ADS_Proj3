Control sub-process. The grey rectangle represents the control sub-process and the smaller beam shapes inside of the grey rectangle represent the activities that take place inside the control sub-process. The beams with a black shadow indicate that the activity is a closed (complex) activity. This means that the activity consists of a collection of (sub) activities but these activities are not expanded because they are not relevant in this particular context. The white beam without shadow indicates that the reporting activity is a standard activity. This means that reporting does not contain (sub) activities. [[Image:Control Process model.jpg]] Figure 2.1.1: Meta-process model Control sub-process Furthermore, it is noticeable that the first two activities are not linked with an arrow and that there is a black stripe with an arrow leading to the reporting activity. This means that the two first activities are not sequential. They are unordered activities and after these two activities have taken place the reporting activity will sequentially follow. For a more extensive explanation of the meta-modeling technique consult the [[Meta-modeling]] wiki. The following table (table 2.1.2) is a concept definition table. {| class="wikitable" |- ! Concept !! Description |- | CONTROL DOCUMENTS | CONTROL is a description of how SECURITY MANAGEMENT will be organized and how it will be managed. |- | POLICY STATEMENTS | POLICY STATEMENTS are documents that outlines specific requirements or rules that must be met. In the [[information security]] realm, policies are usually point-specific, covering a single area. For example, an “Acceptable Use” policy would cover the rules and regulations for appropriate use of the computing facilities. |- | SECURITY MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK | SECURITY MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK is an established management framework to initiate and control the implementation of information security within your organization and to manage ongoing information security provision. |} Table 2.1.2: Concept and definition control sub-process Security management The meta-data model of the control sub-process is based on a UML class diagram. In figure 2.1.2 is the meta-data model of the control sub-process. [[Image:Control Data model.JPG]] Figure 2.1.2: Meta-process model control sub-process The CONTROL rectangle with a white shadow is an open complex concept. This means that the CONTROL rectangle consists of a collection of (sub) concepts and these concepts are expanded in this particular context. The following picture (figure 2.1.3) is the process-data model of the control sub-process. This picture shows the integration of the two models. The dotted arrows indicate which concepts are created or adjusted in the corresponding activities. [[Image:Control Process data model.JPG]] Figure 2.1.3: Process-data model control sub-process ===Plan=== The Plan sub-process contains activities that in cooperation with the [[Service Level Management]] lead to the (information) Security section in the SLA. Furthermore, the Plan sub-process contains activities that are related to the underpinning contracts which are specific for (information) security. In the Plan sub-process the goals formulated in the SLA are specified in the form of Operational Level Agreements (OLA). These OLA’s can be defined as security plans for a specific internal organization entity of the service provider. Besides the input of the SLA, the Plan sub-process also works with the policy statements of the service provider itself. As said earlier these policy statements are defined in the control sub-process. The Operational Level Agreements for [[information security]] are set up and implemented based on the ITIL process. This means that there has to be cooperation with other ITIL processes. For example if the security management wishes to change the IT infrastructure in order to achieve maximum security, these changes will only be done through the [[Change Management]] process. The Security Management will deliver the input (Request for change) for this change. The change Manager is responsible for the Change Management Process itself. Table 2.3.1 shows the activity plan the (sub) activities and their definition. {| class="wikitable" ! Activities !! Sub-Activities !! Descriptions |- | rowspan=4 | Plan | Create Security section for SLA | This process contains activities that lead to the security agreements paragraph in the service level agreements. At the end of this process the ''Security'' section of the service level agreement is created. |- | Create underpinning Contracts | This process contains activities that lead to UNDERPINNING CONTRACTS. These contracts are specific for security. |- | Create Operational level agreements | The general formulated goals in the SLA are specified in operational level agreements. These agreements can be seen as security plans for specific organization units. |- | Reporting | In this process the whole Create plan process is documented in a specific way. This process ends with REPORTS. |} Table 2.2.1: (Sub) activities and descriptions Plan sub-process ITIL Security Management As well as for the Control sub-process the Plan sub-process has been modeled using the meta-modeling technique. On the right side of figure 2.2.1 the meta-process model of the Plan sub-process is given. As you can see the Plan sub-process consists of a combination of unordered and ordered (sub) activities. Furthermore, it is noticeable that the sub-process contains three complex activities which are all closed activities and one standard activity. Table 2.2.1 consists of concepts that are created or adjusted during the plan sub-process. The table also gives a definition of these concepts. {| class="wikitable" ! Concept !! Description |- | PLAN | Formulated schemes for the security agreements. |- | Security section of the security level agreements | The security agreements paragraph in the written agreements between a Service Provider and the customer(s) that documents agreed Service Levels for a service. |- | UNDERPINNING CONTRACTS | A contract with an external supplier covering delivery of services that support the IT organisation in their delivery of services. |- | OPERATIONAL LEVEL AGREEMENTS | An internal agreement covering the delivery of services which support the IT organization in their delivery of services. |} Table 2.2.2: Concept and definition Plan sub-process Security management Just as the Control sub-process the Plan sub-process is modeled using the meta-modeling technique. The left side of figure 2.2.1 is the meta-data model of the Plan sub-process. The Plan rectangle is
