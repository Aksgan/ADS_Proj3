The community’s belief in social consensus thus determines social roles and sets rules and categories for attitudes. Perhaps, in this essay, magic is system of terminology, a langue, whereas, individual behavior is a system of attitude, parole. Attitudes make sense or acquire meaning through magic. Here, magic is a language. === Interpretive Anthropology === Influenced by [[Hermeneutic]] tradition, [[Clifford Geertz]] developed an [[interpretive anthropology]] of understanding the meaning of the society. The hermeneutic approach allows Geertz to close the distance between an ethnographer and a given culture similar to reader and text relationship. The reader reads a text and generates his/her own meaning. Instead of imposing concepts to represent reality, ethnographers should read the culture and interpret the multiplicities of meaning expressed or hidden in the society. In his influential essay, Thick Description: Towards an Interpretive Theory of Culture, Geertz argues that “man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself has spun.”<ref>Clifford Geertz, ''Interpretation of Culture'', 5.</ref> === Practice Theory === French sociologist, [[Pierre Bourdieu]] challenges the same duality of phenomenology (subjective) and structuralism (objective) through his [[Theory of Practice]]. This idea precisely challenges the reductive approach of economism that places symbolic interest in opposition to economic interests. Similarly, it also rejects subjected-centered view of the world. Bourdieu attempts to close this gap by developing the concept of symbolic capital, for instance, a prestige, as readily convertible back into economic capital and hence, is ‘the most valuable form of accumulation.’ Therefore, economic and symbolic both works together and should be studied as a general science of the economy of practices.<ref>Pierre Bourdieu, Outline of a Theory of a Practice, Cambridge University Press, 179</ref> == System Theory: Gregory Bateson == British anthropologist, [[Gregory Bateson]], is the most influential and one of the earliest founders of System Theory in anthropology. He developed an interdisciplinary approach that included communication theory, cybernetics, and mathematical logic. In his collection of essays, ''The Sacred Unity'', Bateson argues that there are “ecological systems, social systems, and the individual organism plus the environment with which it interacts is itself a system in this technical sense.”<ref>Gregory Bateson, ''A Sacred Unity: Further Steps to an Ecology of Mind'', 260</ref> By adding environment with systems, Bateson closes the gap between the dualities such as subject and object. “Playing upon the differences between formalization and process, or crystallization and randomness, Bateson sought to transcend other dualisms–mind versus nature, organism versus environment, concept versus context, and subject versus object.”<ref>John Tresch, Heredity is an Open System: Gregory Bateson as Descendant and Ancestor, ''Anthropology Today'', Vol. 14, No. 6 (Dec., 1998), pp. 3.</ref> Bateson set out the general rule of systems theory. He says: <blockquote> The basic rule of systems theory is that, if you want to understand some phenomenon or appearance, you must consider that phenomenon within the context of all completed circuits which are relevant to it. The emphasis is on the concept of the completed communicational circuit and implicit in the theory is the expectation that all units containing completed circuits will show mental characteristics. The mind, in other words, is immanent in the circuitry. We are accustomed to thinking of the mind as somehow contained within the skin of an organism, but the circuitry is not contained within the skin.<ref>Gregory Bateson, ''A Sacred Unity: Further Steps to an Ecology of Mind'', 260</ref> </blockquote> === Influences on Poststructuralism === Bateson's work influenced major poststructuralist scholars especially Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari. In fact, the very word 'plateau' in Deleuze and Guattari's magnum opus, ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'', came from Bateson's work on Balinese culture. They wrote: "Gregory Bateson uses the word plateau to designate something very special: a continuous, self-vibrating region of intensities whose development avoids any orientation toward a culmination point or external end.”<ref>Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, ''A Thousand Plateaus'', 22</ref> Bateson pioneered an interdisciplinary approach in anthropology. He coined the term “ecology of mind” to demonstrate that what "goes on in one's head and in one's behavior" is interlocked and constitutes a network.<ref>Gregory Bateson, ''A Sacred Unity: Further Steps to an Ecology of Mind'', 265</ref> Guattari wrote: <blockquote> Gregory Bateson has clearly shown that what he calls the “ecology of ideas” cannot be contained within the domain of the psychology of the individual, but organizes itself into systems or “minds”, the boundaries of which no longer coincide with the participant individuals.<ref>Dana Arnold, Joanna R. ''Biographies and Space'', 18.</ref> </blockquote> === Posthumanist Turn and Ethnographic Writing=== In anthropology, the task of representing a native point of view has been a challenging one. The idea behind the ethnographic writing is to understand a complexity of an everyday life of the people without undermining or reducing the native account. Historically, as mentioned above, ethnographers insert raw data, collected in the fieldwork, into the writing "machine." The output is usually the neat categories of ethnicity, identity, classes, kinship, genealogy, religion, culture, violence, and numerous other. With the posthumanist turn, however, the art of ethnographic writing has suffered serious challenges. Anthropologists are now thinking of experimenting with new style of writing. For instance, writing with natives or multiple authorship. The systems theory challenges, among other fields, the ethnographic writing that is usually focused on representing the Other. It also undermines the discipline of [[identity politics]] and [[postcolonialism]]. Postcolonial scholars’ claims of subaltern identity or indigeneity and their demand of liberal rights from a state is actually falling back into the same signifying Western myth of Oedipal complex of ego and the Id. Instead of looking for a non-unitary subject in multiplicities organized into assemblage and montage; postcolonial studies limit flows into the same Western category of identity thus undermining the networks that sustain people’s everyday lives. Deleuze and Guattari’s rhizomatic and Benjamin’s montage dismantle the top-down and hierarchical social reality and bring into attention the micropolitics of mapping multiplicities of networks and assemblages.... == See also == * [[Systems theory]] * [[Complex systems]] * [[Systems science]] * [[Social systems]] * [[Open and closed system in social science]] ==References== {{reflist}} == Further reading ==
