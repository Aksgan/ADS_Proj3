to say something about the security properties of the above explained XTR encryption scheme, first it is important to check the security of the XTR group, i.e. how hard it is to solve the [[discrete logarithm|Discrete Logarithm problem]] there. The next part will then state the equivalency between the Discrete Logarithm problem in the XTR group and the XTR version of the discrete logarithm problem using only the traces of elements. ===Discrete logarithms in a general <math>GF\left(p^t\right)</math>=== Let now <math>\langle \gamma\rangle</math> be a multiplicative group of order <math>\omega</math>. The security of the [[Diffie-Hellman|Diffie-Hellman protocol]] in <math>\langle \gamma\rangle</math> relies on the [[Diffie-Hellman problem|''Diffie-Hellman'' (DH) problem]] of computing <math>\gamma^{xy}\text{ given }\gamma^x\text{ and }\gamma^y</math>. We write <math>DH(\gamma^x,\ \gamma^y)=\gamma^{xy}</math>. There are two other problems related to the DH problem. The first one is the [[Decisional Diffieâ€“Hellman assumption|''Diffie-Hellman Decision'' (DHD) problem]] to determine if <math>c=DH(a,b)</math> for given <math>a,b,c\in\langle\gamma\rangle</math> and the second one is the [[discrete logarithm problem|''Discrete Logarithm'' (DL) problem]] to find <math>x=DL(a)</math> for a given <math> a=\gamma^x\in\langle\gamma\rangle\text{ with }0\leq x<\omega</math>. The DL problem is at least as difficult als the DH problem and it is generally assumed that if the DL problem in <math>\langle \gamma\rangle</math> is intractable, then so are the other two. Given the [[prime factorization]] of <math>\omega</math> the DL problem in <math>\langle \gamma\rangle</math> can be reduced to the DL problem in all subgroups of <math>\langle \gamma\rangle</math> with prime order due to the [[Pohlig-Hellman algorithm]]. Hence <math>\omega</math> can safely be assumed to be prime. For a subgroup <math>\langle\gamma\rangle</math> of prime order <math>\omega</math> of the multiplicative group <math>GF\left(p^t\right)^*</math> of an extension field <math>GF(p^t)</math> of <math>GF(p)</math> for some <math>t</math> there are now two possible ways to attack the system. One can either focus on the whole multiplicative group or on the subgroup. To attack the multiplicative group the best known method is the Discrete Logarithm variant of the [[Number Field Sieve]] or alternatively in the subgroup one can use one of several methods that take <math>\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\omega})</math> operations in <math>\langle\gamma\rangle</math>, such as [[Pollard's rho algorithm|Pollard's rho method]]. For both approaches the difficulty of the DL problem in <math>\langle\gamma\rangle</math> depends on the size of the minimal surrounding subfield of <math>\langle\gamma\rangle</math> and on the size of its prime order <math>\omega</math>. If <math>GF\left(p^t\right)</math> itself is the minimal surrounding subfield of <math>\langle\gamma\rangle</math> and <math>\omega</math> is sufficiently large, then the DL problem in <math>\langle\gamma\rangle</math> is as hard as the general DL problem in <math>GF\left(p^t\right)</math>. The XTR parameters are now chosen in such a way that <math>p</math> is not small, <math>q</math> is sufficiently large and <math>\langle g\rangle</math> cannot be embedded in a true subfield of <math>GF(p^6)</math>, since <math>q\mid p^2-p+1</math> and <math>p^2-p+1</math> is a divisor of <math>\mid\! GF(p^6)^*\! \mid=p^6-1</math>, but it does not divide <math>p^s-1\text{ for }s\in\{1,2,3,4,5\}</math> and thus <math>\langle g\rangle</math> cannot be a subgroup of <math>GF\!\ (p^s)^*</math> for <math>s\in\{1,2,3,4,5\}</math>. It follows that the DL problem in the XTR group may be assumed as hard as the DL problem in <math>GF(p^6)</math>. === Security of XTR === Cryptographic protocols that are based on discrete logarithms can use many different types of subgroups like groups of points of [[elliptic curves]] or subgroups of the multiplicative group of a finite field like the XTR group. As we have seen above the XTR versions of the Diffie-Hellman and ElGamal encryption protocol replace using elements of the XTR group by using their traces. This means that the security of the XTR versions of these encryption schemes is no longer based on the original DH, DHD or DL problems. Therefore the XTR versions of those problems need to be defined and we will see that they are equivalent (in the sense of the next definition) to the original problems. '''Definitions:''' *''We define the '''XTR-DH''' problem as the problem of computing <math>Tr(g^{xy})</math> given <math>Tr(g^x)</math> and <math>Tr(g^y)</math> and we write <math>XDH(g^x,\ g^y)=g^{xy}</math>.'' *''The '''XTR-DHD''' problem is the problem of determining whether <math>XDH(a,b)=c\text{ for }a,b,x\in Tr(\langle g\rangle)</math>.'' *''Given <math>a\in Tr(\langle g\rangle)</math>,the '''XTR-DL''' problem is to find <math>x=XDL(a)</math>, i.e. <math>0\leq x<q \text{ such that } a=Tr(g^x)</math>.'' *'' We say that problem <math>\mathcal{A}</math> is (a,b)-equivalent to problem <math>\mathcal{B}</math>, if any instance of problem <math>\mathcal{A}</math> (or <math>\mathcal{B}</math>) can be solved by at most a (or b) calls to an algorithm solving problem <math>\mathcal{B}</math> (or <math>\mathcal{A}</math>).'' After introducing the XTR versions of these problems the next theorem is an important result telling us the connection between the XTR and the non-XTR problems, which are in fact equivalent. This implies that the XTR representation of elements with their traces is, as can be seen above, faster by a factor of 3 than the usual representation without compromising security. '''Theorem''' ''The following equivalencies hold:'' :''i. The '''XTR-DL''' problem is (1,1)-equivalent to the '''DL''' problem in <math>\langle g\rangle</math>.'' :''ii. The '''XTR-DH''' problem is (1,2)-equivalent to the '''DH''' problem in <math>\langle g\rangle</math>.'' :''iii. The '''XTR-DHD''' problem is (3,2)-equivalent to the '''DHD''' problem in <math>\langle g\rangle</math>.'' This means that an algorithm solving either XTR-DL, XTR-DH or XTR-DHD with non-negligible probability can be transformed into an algorithm solving the corresponding non-XTR problem DL, DH or DHD with non-negligible probability and vice versa. In particular part ''ii.'' implies that determining the small XTR-DH key (being an element of <math>GF(p^2)</math>) is as hard as determining the whole DH key (being an element of <math>GF(p^6)</math> ) in the representation group <math>\langle g \rangle</math>. == References == * {{cite paper|first=Arjen K. | last = Lenstra | coauthors = Verheul, Eric R. | url=http://www.win.tue.nl/~klenstra/xtrsurvey.pdf|title=An overview of the XTR public key system|accessdate = 2008-03-22}} * {{cite paper|first=Arjen K. | last = Lenstra | coauthors = Verheul, Eric R. | url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.95.4291&rep=rep1&type=pdf|title=The XTR public key system| accessdate = 2010-12-14}} {{Reflist}} {{Crypto navbox | public-key}} [[Category:Asymmetric-key cryptosystems]] [[Category:Finite fields]] [[nl:XTR]]</text> </page> <page> <id>40764</id> <title>Xbox 360</title> <text>{{pp-semi|small=yes}} <!-- To edit infobox info, go to Template:Xbox 360/infobox.
