They are commonly referred to as '[[emoticon]]', 'smilie', or '[[smiley]]'. There is another type of one-line ASCII art that does not require the mental rotation of pictures, which is widely known in Japan as [[Emoticon#East Asian style|kaomoji]] (literally "face characters".) Traditionally, they are referred to as "ASCII face ". More complex examples use several lines of text to draw large symbols or more complex figures. ====Popular smileys==== {{Main|List of common emoticons}} The list only shows some popular examples for demonstration purposes. Hundreds of different text smileys were developed over time,<ref name=smileys2>{{Harvnb|textfiles|2008}}</ref> but only a few were generally accepted, used and understood. {|class="wikitable" |- !width=50|Icon !width=250|Meaning !width=50|Icon !width=250|Meaning |- |<code><nowiki>:) or :] or (: or [: or =) or =] or (",) or ^^ or C: or :3 or n_n</nowiki></code> |classic smile |<code><nowiki>;| or ;) or ;D or ^.~ </nowiki></code> |winking |- |<code><nowiki>:( =( :C</nowiki></code> |classic sad |<code><nowiki>:-o</nowiki></code> |yawn or surprised |- |<code><nowiki>:-)</nowiki></code> |smile |<code><nowiki>XD or xD</nowiki></code> |Laughter |- |<code><nowiki>>=D</nowiki></code> |evil laugh |- |<code><nowiki>>=)</nowiki></code> |evil grin |<code><nowiki>:o or O_o or O.o or O.O or ._.</nowiki></code> |surprised |- |<code><nowiki>:B</nowiki></code> |buck-tooth |<code><nowiki>:,( or :*( or :'( or :_( or ='( or =,(</nowiki></code> |crying smiley |- |<code><nowiki>:-#</nowiki></code> |with braces or sick smiley |<code><nowiki>T_T or TT_TT or QQ or ;_; or ;-; or ;A; or T.T</nowiki></code> |crying |- |<code><nowiki>:P or :p or xp or xP or XP or c(: :þ</nowiki></code> |tongue sticking out (silly) |<code><nowiki>D:< or ]:< or >:[ or ):< or >:(</nowiki></code> |angry |- |<code><nowiki>:/ or :\ or :| or D:</nowiki></code> |indifferent; worried, amazed |<code><nowiki>:0</nowiki></code> |gasp, surprised, astonished |- |<code><nowiki>8D or BD or 8) or B-)</nowiki></code> |smiley with glasses |<code><nowiki>-_- or -.- or = ^ =</nowiki></code> |annoyed, really? not surprised, serious. |- |<code><nowiki>;) or ;] or (; or [;</nowiki></code> |winking smile |<code><nowiki>:D or xD or XD</nowiki></code> |huge grin, very happy |- |¬_¬ or -.- or -.-' or -_- or -_-' or = _ =' |Annoyed, Sweat-drop, not surprised, [[Facepalm]] |ಠ_ಠ |Expression of disapproval or disbelief |- |} ===Styles of the computer underground text art scene=== ====Atari 400/800 ATASCII==== The [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 400/800]] did not follow the ASCII standard and had its own character set, called [[ATASCII]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Štěrba|2005}} (gif image)</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Moeser|Fusik|2007}}</ref> The emergence of ATASCII art coincided with the growing popularity of [[Bulletin board system|BBS Systems]] caused by availability of the [[acoustic coupler]]s that were compatible with the 8-bit home computers.

The C-64 character set is called [[PETSCII]], an extended form of [[ASCII|ASCII-1963]]. As with the Atari's ATASCII art, C-64 fans developed a similar scene that used PETSCII for their creations. ===="Block ASCII" / "High ASCII" style ASCII art on the IBM PC==== [[Image:ASCII notepad acidview compare.png|right|200px|thumbnail|Block ASCII display via Notepad versus ACiDView for Windows]] So-called "block ASCII" or "high ASCII" uses the extended characters of the 8-bit [[code page 437]], which is a proprietary standard introduced by [[IBM]] in 1979 (ANSI Standard x3.16) for the IBM PC and MS DOS operating system.
