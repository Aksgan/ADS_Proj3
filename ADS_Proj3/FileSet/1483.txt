The only consideration taken was where they were located geographically in respect to the region's mapped outline. As net numbers got added, the following formula was used. <blockquote> Region number X 20 </blockquote> Then when some regions started running out of network numbers, the following was also used. <blockquote> Region number X 200 </blockquote> Region 19, for instance, contains nets 380-399 and 3800-3999 in addition to those that were in Region 19 when it was formed. Part of the objective behind the formation of local nets was to implement cost reduction plans by which all messages would be sent to one or more hubs or hosts in [[data compression|compressed form]] ([[.arc|ARC]] was nominally standard, but [[PKZIP]] is universally supported); one toll call could then be made during off-peak hours to exchange entire message-filled archives with an out-of-town uplink for further redistribution. In practice, the FidoNet structure allows for any node to connect directly to any other, and node operators would sometimes form their own toll-calling arrangements on an ad-hoc basis, allowing for a balance between collective cost saving and timely delivery. For instance, if one node operator in a network offered to make regular toll calls to a particular system elsewhere, other operators might arrange to forward all of their mail destined for the remote system, and those near it, to the local volunteer. Operators within individual networks would sometimes have cost-sharing arrangements, but it was also common for people to volunteer to pay for regular toll calls either out of generosity, or to build their status in the community. This ad-hoc system was particularly popular with networks that were built on top of FidoNet. Echomail, for instance, often involved relatively large file transfers due to its popularity. If official FidoNet distributors refused to transfer Echomail due to additional toll charges, other node operators would sometimes volunteer. In such cases, Echomail messages would be routed to the volunteers' systems instead. The FidoNet system was best adapted to an environment in which local [[telephone]] service was inexpensive and long-distance calls (or intercity data transfer via [[packet-switched]] [[computer network|networks]]) costly. Therefore, it fared somewhat poorly in [[Japan]], where even local lines are expensive, or in [[France]], where tolls on local calls and competition with [[Minitel]] or other data networks limited its growth. ===Points=== As the number of messages in Echomail grew over time, it became very difficult for users to keep up with the volume while logged into their local BBS. '''Points''' were introduced to address this, allowing technically savvy users to receive the already compressed and batched Echomail (and Netmail) and read it locally on their own machines. To do this, the FidoNet addressing scheme was extended with the addition of a final address segment, the point number. For instance, a user on the example system above might be given point number 10, and thus could be sent mail at the address <tt>1:170/918.10</tt>. In real-world use, points are fairly difficult to set up. The FidoNet software typically consisted of a number of small utility programs run by manually-adjusted scripts. Reading and editing the mail required either a "sysop editor" or a BBS be run locally. In North America (Zone 1) points were used only briefly, and even then only to a limited degree. Dedicated [[offline mail reader]] programs such as [[Blue Wave]], [[Squiggy fidonet|Squiggy]] and Silver Xpress (OPX) were introduced in the mid 1990s, and quickly rendered the point system obsolete. Many of these packages supported the [[QWK (file format)|QWK]] offline mail standard. In other parts of the world, especially Europe, this was different. Contrary to North America where local calls usually are free, in Europe local calls are mostly metered and so there was an incentive to keep the duration of the calls as short as possible. Point software employs standard compression (ZIP, ARJ etc.) and so keeps the calls down to a few minutes a day at most. In Europe (Zone 2) pointing became very popular. Many regions distribute a pointlist in parallel with the nodelist. The pointlist segments are maintained by Net- and Region Pointlist Keepers and the Zone Point List Keeper assembles them into the Zone pointlist. At the peak of FidoNet there were over 120,000 points listed in the Z2 pointlist. Listing points is on a voluntary basis and not every point is listed, so how many points there really were is anybody's guess. As of June 2006, there are still some 50,000 listed points. Most of them are in Russia and Ukraine. ===Technical specifications=== FidoNet contained several technical specifications for compatibility between systems. The most basic of all was ''FTS-0001'', with which all FidoNet systems were required to comply as a minimal requirement. FTS-0001 defined: *Handshaking - the protocols used by mailer software to identify each other and exchange meta information about the session. *Transfer protocol ''([[XMODEM]])'' - the protocols to be used for transferring files containing FidoNet mail between systems. *Message format - the standard format for FidoNet messages during the time which they were exchanged between systems. Other specifications that were commonly used provided for ''echomail'', different transfer protocols and handshake methods (''e.g.: Yoohoo/Yoohoo2u2, EMSI''), file compression, nodelist format, transfer over reliable connections such as the Internet ([[Binkp]]), and other aspects. ===Zone mail hour=== Since computer bulletin boards historically used the same [[telephone line]]s for transferring mail as were used for dial-in human users of the BBS, FidoNet policy dictates that at least one designated line of each FidoNet node must be available for accepting mail from other FidoNet nodes during a particular hour of each day.{{sfn|Schuyler|1992|loc=Section 6.0}} "Zone Mail Hour," as it was named, varies depending on the geographic location of the node, and was designated to occur during the early morning. The exact hour varies depending on the time zone, and any node with only one telephone line is required to reject human callers. In practice, particularly in later times, most FidoNet systems tend to accept mail at any time of day when the phone line is not busy, usually during
