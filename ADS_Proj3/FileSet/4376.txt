The [[World wide web]] (the Web) has become "by far, the most popular Internet protocol"<ref>{{Cite web | title = History | accessdate = May 2010 | work = World Wide Web | url = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web#History}}</ref> to disseminate online applications. Most major IDEs now offer environments for web application developed aimed at browser hosted applications. Charting components, TeeChart among them, have adapted to provide models that work within a browser environment, often using static images and scripted layering techniques such as [[Ajax (programming)]] to offer a level of interactivity, improve response times and hide apparent delay from the user. Options to enrich client, browser-side processing flexibility are exploited by TeeChart libraries via modules that offer 'micro-environments' within the browser, such as the long established [[ActiveX]] technology, [[Adobe Flash]], Microsoft [[Silverlight]] or Java [[Applets]]. Serverside environments offer too, a means to interact with browser based script to dynamically respond to charting requests. [[Joomla]] and [[CodeIgniter]] are host environments for TeeChart PHP and an example of an Embarcadero [[IntraWeb VCL]] designed application using TeeChart, is documented here.<ref>{{Citation | last = Reddy | first = S.M. | last2 = Mazumder | first2 = R. | last3 = Evans | first3 = D.A.D | last4 = Collins | first4 = A.S. | title = Palaeoproterozoic Supercontinents and Global Evolution | place = London | publisher = [[The Geological Society]] | year = 2009 | page = 31 | isbn = 9781862392830 }}</ref> ==External links and programmer reference== [[The Code Project]] includes a demo that uses TeeChart.Lite, called 'Self-Organizing Feature Maps (Kohonen maps)' written by Bashir Magomedovl <ref>{{Cite web | last = Magomedovl | first = Bashir | title = Self-Organizing Feature Maps (Kohonen maps) | work = [http://www.codeproject.com/ The Code Project] | date = November 7, 2006 | url = http://www.codeproject.com/KB/recipes/sofm.aspx?msg=1986967#_top | accessdate = May 2010 }}</ref> and [[SourceForge]] includes a Database Stress and Monitor that also uses TeeChart.Lite.<ref>{{Cite web | author = [http://mehyaa.users.sourceforge.net/ mehyaa] | title = Database Stress and Monitor | date = October 30, 2009 | url = http://sourceforge.net/projects/db-stresser/ | work = [http://db-stresser.sourceforge.net SourceForge.net] | accessdate = May 2010 }}</ref> For information about TeeChart support for [[Freepascal]] see TeeChart conversion status at the Free Pascal Wiki.<ref>{{Cite web | title = TeeChart | url = http://wiki.freepascal.org/Current_conversion_projects#TeeChart | work = Current conversion projects | accessdate = June 2010 }}</ref> Reference information about TeeChart for PHP use may be found at the [[CodeIgniter]] wiki pages.<ref>{{Cite web | author = Steema Software SL | title = TeeChart and CodeIgniter | url = http://codeigniter.com/wiki/TeeChart_and_CodeIgniter/ | work = [http://codeigniter.com CodeIgniter] | date = September 1, 2009 | accessdate = May 2010 }}</ref> Books and information sources that include substantial sections about working with the Delphi version of TeeChart include "Mastering Delphi 6" by Marco Cantù,<ref>{{Citation | last = Cantù | first = Marco | title = Mastering Delphi 6 - Mastering Series | place = California | publisher = [[Sybex]] | year = 2001 | page = 550 | chapter = Chapter 13: Delphi's Database Architecture | isbn = 9780782128741 }}</ref> "C++ Builder 5 developer's guide",<ref>{{Citation | last = Hollingworth | first = Jarrod | title = C++ Builder 5 developer's guide | place = USA | publisher = [[Sams Publishing]] | year = 2000 | page = 932 | isbn = 9780672319723 }}</ref> a video Delphi Tutorial on charting JPEG compression<ref>{{Cite web | last = Christie | first = Alister | title = Delphi Programming Tutorial #38 - Charting Jpeg Compression | location = [http://codegearguru.com/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=1&limit=8&limitstart=16 CodeGearGuru.com] | date = July 30, 2008 | url = http://codegearguru.com/video/038/ChartJpg.html | accessdate = May 2010 }}</ref> and support forums and reference pages at TeeChart Support Forums.<ref>[http://www.teechart.net/support/index.php TeeChart Support Forums]</ref> Non-English language document sources include, in Czech "Myslíme v jazyku Delphi 7: knihovna zkušeného programátora" by Marco Cantù,<ref>{{Citation | last = Cantù | first = Marco | title = Myslíme v jazyku Delphi 7: knihovna zkušeného programátora | place = Praga | publisher = Grada Publishing | year = 2003 | page = 17 | language = Czech | isbn = 9788024706948 }}</ref> and Chinese, Delphi 6,<ref>{{Citation | author = 刘艺 | editor = DynoMedia | title = Delphi 6 企业级解决方案及应用剖析 | year =
