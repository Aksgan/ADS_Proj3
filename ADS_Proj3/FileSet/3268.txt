The re-orientation ensures one satellite doesn't collide with another. The rocket effectively re-orients itself four to five times in the space of one flight," a scientist explained.{{citation needed|date=July 2010|reason=Who? any scientist - maybe a biologist?}} The brain of the rocket would have made all calculations in advance - from ejection of first satellite to the fifth. The exact moment of ejection and then re-orientation for the next ejection is worked out in advance. All mathematical calculations on the ground, launch sequence and flight path have to work to zero error. Oceansat-2, India's second satellite to study oceans as well as interaction of oceans and atmosphere, is the 16th remote sensing satellite of India. It is in the shape of a cuboid with two solar panels projecting from its sides. The satellite will map fishing zones around India, measure ocean surface windspeeds as well as atmospheric temperature and humidity. This was the 16th PSLV's mission. From September 1993 to April 2009, PSLV has been launched 15 times. Fourteen launches have been successful continuously while only one has failed so far. During 2007, the flight model OCM payload electronics was realised, the camera assembly was in progress and scatterometer configuration was finalised. Fabrication of mainframe systems like Core power, RF systems BMU, and sensors had started and DC-DC converters for OCM, earth sensor, TME realized. As of 2008, mainframe structure had been realised. Preliminary design review of all mainframe systems completed. OCM camera test and evaluation had been completed. Scatterometer qualification model hardware had been realized. ROSA interfaces with spacecraft systems had been finalised. Qualification model of scatterometer scan mechanism and the interface test with electronics had also been completed.<ref>http://www.isro.org/rep2007/Earth%20Observation.htm</ref> ==See also== *[[Indian Remote Sensing satellite]] *[[List of Indian satellites]] *[[Oceanography]] *[[Scatterometer]] ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== {{Indian space program}} {{Orbital launches in 2009}} [[Category:Satellites]] [[Category:Unmanned vehicles]] [[Category:Indian space program]] [[Category:2009 in spaceflight]] [[de:OceanSat-2]] [[hi:ओशनसेट-२]] [[ml:ഓഷ്യൻസാറ്റ്-2]] [[mr:ओशनसॅट-२]]</text> </page> <page> <id>27093</id> <title>Octaeteris</title> <text>In [[astronomy]], an '''octaeteris''' (plural: '''octaeterides''') is the period of eight [[solar year]]s after which the [[moon phase]] occurs on the same day of the year plus one or two days. This period is also in a very good synchronicity with five [[Venus]]ian visibility cycles (the Venusian [[synodic period]]) and thirteen Venusian revolutions around the sun (Venusian [[sidereal period]]). This means, that if [[Venus]] is visible beside the [[moon]], after eight years the two will be again close together near the same date of the [[calendar]]. {| class="wikitable" |+ Comparison of differing parts of the Octaeteris |Astronomical period |Number in an Octaeteris |Overall duration ([[Earth]] days) |- |[[Tropical year]] |8 |2921.93754 |- |[[Synodic month|Synodic lunar month]] |99 |2923.528230 |- |[[Sidereal month|Sidereal lunar month]] |107 |2923.417787 |- |[[Venus]]ian [[synodic period]] |5 |2919.6 |- |Venusian [[sidereal period]] |13 |2921.07595 |} The Octaeteris, also known as Oktaeteris, was noted by [[Cleostratus]] in [[ancient Greece]] as a 2923.5 day cycle. The 8 year short lunisolar cycle was probably known to many ancient cultures. The mathematical proportions of the Octaeteris cycles were noted in Classic Vernal rock art in northeastern [[Utah]] by J. Q. Jacobs in 1990. The Three Kings panel also contains more accurate ratios, ratios related to other planets, and apparent astronomic symbolism. == See also == *[[Metonic cycle]] * [[Eclipse cycle]] == References == * Mathematical Astronomy Morsels, Jean Meeus, Willmann-Bell, Inc., 1997 (Chapter 9, p. 51, Table 9.A Some eclipse Periodicities) == External links == *[http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/AcanoALunarCalendarMethod.html] Acano method for finding 46 lunar eclipses in 270 moons. {{Greek astronomy}} [[Category:Ancient Greek astronomy]] [[Category:Calendars]] [[Category:Time in astronomy]] [[sh:Oktaeteris]]</text> </page> <page> <id>27095</id> <title>Octatron SkySeer</title> <text>The '''Octatron SkySeer''' is an autonomous, computer controlled [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV) designed for easy transport and launch. It is designed and manufactured by Octatron, Incorporated of [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], USA. Intended for short-range operations, the electric-powered SkySeer resembles a normal [[radio controlled airplane]] or two-meter [[Glider (sailplane)|glider]]. Once unfolded from its storage tube and its electronics initialized, the SkySeer is then hand-launched by its operator. All of the drone's basic flight functions are handled by [[GPS]] including landings. Range is approximately two miles/3.2 km and is extendable via Octatron's NetWeaver interface. {{Advert|date=November 2010}} The basic platform is very low cost; a fully loaded SkySeer retails for approximately US$25,000 to $30,000 which includes all electronics, video surveillance equipment, ground station and computer interfaces. Video interface is in real time and allows the operator to literally see what the drone sees and to record it as such. The ground station's recorder can store up to twenty hours of high-quality [[MPEG-2]] format video which can then be transferred to [[DVD]] or [[Macromedia Flash]]. The [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] is currently experimenting with the SkySeer as a means of crime prevention. At present, the experiment has been suspended by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] because of that agency's claim of a lack of the proper permits. Although the FAA does not regulate model aircraft, it does have jurisdiction over unmanned aerial vehicles.<ref name="wsj1">{{cite web |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB115491642950528436.html?mod=hps_us_editors_picks |title=Drones in Domestic Skies?
