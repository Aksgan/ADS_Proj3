However, the older versions of Darwin are still available in Binary form. ==Design== ===Kernel=== Darwin is built around [[XNU]], a [[hybrid kernel]] that combines the [[Mach (kernel)|Mach]] 3 [[microkernel]], various elements of [[BSD]] (including the process model, [[network stack]], and [[virtual file system]]),<ref>[http://developer.apple.com/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/OSX_Technology_Overview/SystemTechnology/chapter_3_section_2.html "Darwin."] [[Apple Developer Connection]]. Retrieved on 2008-06-02.</ref> and an object-oriented [[device driver]] [[Application programming interface|API]] called [[I/O Kit]].<ref>Singh, Amit (January 7, 2004).[http://www.kernelthread.com/mac/osx/arch_xnu.html "XNU: The Kernel."] ''Kernel Thread''. Retrieved on 2008-05-04.</ref> Some of the benefits of this choice of kernel are the [[Mach-O]] binary format, which allows a single executable file (including the kernel itself) to support multiple [[Central processing unit|CPU]] architectures, and the mature support for [[symmetric multiprocessing]] in Mach. The hybrid kernel design compromises between the flexibility of a [[microkernel]] and the performance of a [[monolithic kernel]]. ===Hardware and software support=== Darwin currently includes support for both [[32-bit]] and [[64-bit]] variants of the [[Intel x86]] [[microprocessor|processor]] used in the [[Macintosh|Mac]] and [[Apple TV]] as well as the 32-bit [[ARM architecture|ARM]] processor used in the [[iPhone]], [[iPod Touch]] and [[iPad]]. An open-source port of the [[XNU]] kernel exists which supports Darwin on Intel and [[AMD]] x86 platforms not officially supported by Apple.<ref>[http://code.google.com/p/xnu-dev/ Voodoo XNU Kernel].</ref> It supports the [[POSIX]] API by way of its [[BSD]] lineage and a large number of programs written for various other [[UNIX-like]] systems can be [[compiler|compiled]] on Darwin with no changes to the [[source code]]. Darwin does not include many of the defining elements of Mac OS X, such as the [[Carbon (API)|Carbon]] and [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]] APIs or the [[Quartz Compositor]] and [[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua user interface]], and thus cannot run Mac applications. It does, however, support a number of lesser known features of Mac OS X, such as mDNSResponder, which is the [[multicast]] [[domain name system|DNS]] responder and a core component of the [[Bonjour (software)|Bonjour]] networking technology, and [[launchd]], an advanced [[Operating system service management|service management]] [[software framework|framework]]. ==License== In July 2003, Apple released Darwin under version 2.0 of the [[Apple Public Source License]] (APSL), which the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) approved as a [[free software license]]. Previous releases had taken place under an earlier version of the APSL that did not meet the FSF's definition of free software, although it met the requirements of the [[Open Source Definition]]. ==Mascot== [[Image:Hexley.png|left|70px]]The Darwin developers decided to adopt a [[mascot]] in 2000, and chose Hexley the [[Platypus]], over other contenders, such as an [[Aqua (theme)|Aqua]] [[Parodies of the ichthys symbol|Darwin fish]], [[Clarus the Dogcow]], and an [[orca]]. Hexley is a [[cartoon]] platypus who usually wears a cap resembling a [[demon]]'s horns. He carries a trident, similar to the [[BSD Daemon]], to symbolize the daemon's [[fork (operating system)|forking]] of [[process (computing)|processes]]. Hexley was designed and [[copyrighted]] by Jon Hooper. Apple does not sanction Hexley as a logo for Darwin.<ref>Hooper, Jon. [http://www.hexley.com/ "Homepage of Hexley the DarwinOS mascot."] ''The Home of Hexley the Platypus''. Retrieved on 2008-11-30.</ref> Hexley's name was a mistake: it was originally supposed to be named after [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], a 19th century English [[biologist]] who was a well-known champion of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] (nicknamed "Darwin's bulldog"). However, ignorance led not only to a mistake in Huxley's name, but who he was thought to be. The developers apparently thought he was simply Darwin's assistant, when in fact he was a prominent biologist in his own right. By the time the mistake had been discovered, it was deemed too late to change, and the incorrect name "Hexley" was kept.<ref>Hooper, Jon.
