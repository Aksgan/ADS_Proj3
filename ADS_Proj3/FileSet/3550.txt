means that FDG is trapped in any cell which takes it up, until it decays, since [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] sugars, due to their ionic charge, cannot exit from the cell. This results in intense radiolabeling of tissues with high glucose uptake, such as the brain, the liver, and most cancers. As a result, FDG-PET can be used for diagnosis, staging, and monitoring treatment of cancers, particularly in [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]], [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]], and [[lung cancer]]. Many other types of solid tumors will be found to be very highly labeled on a case-by-case basis—a fact which becomes especially useful in searching for tumor [[metastasis]], or for recurrence after a known highly active primary tumor is removed. Because individual PET scans are more expensive than "conventional" imaging with [[computed tomography]] (CT) and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), expansion of FDG-PET in cost-constrained health services will depend on proper [[health technology assessment]]; this problem is a difficult one because structural and functional imaging often cannot be directly compared, as they provide different information. Oncology scans using FDG make up over 90% of all PET scans in current practice. # [[Image:PET-image.jpg|thumb|200px|right|PET scan of the human brain.]][[Neurology]]: PET [[neuroimaging]] is based on an assumption that areas of high radioactivity are associated with brain activity. What is actually measured indirectly is the flow of blood to different parts of the brain, which is generally believed to be correlated, and has been measured using the tracer [[oxygen]]-15. However, because of its 2-minute half-life O-15 must be piped directly from a medical [[cyclotron]] for such uses, and this is difficult. In practice, since the brain is normally a rapid user of glucose, and since brain pathologies such as [[Alzheimer's disease]] greatly decrease brain metabolism of both glucose and oxygen in tandem, standard FDG-PET of the brain, which measures regional glucose use, may also be successfully used to differentiate Alzheimer's disease from other dementing processes, and also to make early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The advantage of FDG-PET for these uses is its much wider availability. PET imaging with FDG can also be used for localization of seizure focus: A seizure focus will appear as hypometabolic during an interictal scan. Several [[radiotracer]]s (i.e. [[radioligand]]s) have been developed for PET that are [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] for specific [[neuroreceptor]] subtypes such as [<sup>11</sup>C] [[raclopride]] and [<sup>18</sup>F] fallypride for [[dopamine]] D2/D3 receptors, [<sup>11</sup>C]McN 5652 and [<sup>11</sup>C][[DASB]] for [[serotonin transporter]]s, or enzyme substrates (e.g. 6-[[FDOPA]] for the AADC enzyme). These agents permit the visualization of neuroreceptor pools in the context of a plurality of neuropsychiatric and neurologic illnesses. A novel probe developed at the University of Pittsburgh termed PIB ([[Pittsburgh compound B]]) permits the visualization of [[amyloid]] plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. This technology could assist clinicians in making a positive clinical diagnosis of AD pre-mortem and aid in the development of novel anti-amyloid therapies. [<sup>11</sup>C]PMP (N-[<sup>11</sup>C]methylpiperidin-4-yl propionate) is a novel radiopharmaceutical used in PET imaging to determine the activity of the acetylcholinergic neurotransmitter system by acting as a substrate for acetylcholinesterase. Post-mortem examination of AD patients have shown decreased levels of acetylcholinesterase. [<sup>11</sup>C]PMP is used to map the acetylcholinesterase activity in the brain which could allow for pre-mortem diagnosis of AD and help to monitor AD treatments.<ref>D. E. Kuhl, R. A. Koeppe, S.

Recently, a role has been suggested for FDG-PET imaging of [[atherosclerosis]] to detect patients at risk of [[stroke]] [http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/105/23/2708]. # [[Neuropsychology]] / [[Cognitive neuroscience]]: To examine links between specific psychological processes or disorders and brain activity. # [[Psychiatry]]: Numerous compounds that bind selectively to neuroreceptors of interest in biological psychiatry have been radiolabeled with C-11 or F-18. [[Radioligand]]s that bind to [[dopamine receptor]]s (D1,D2, reuptake transporter), [[serotonin receptor]]s (5HT1A, 5HT2A, reuptake transporter) [[opioid receptor]]s (mu) and other sites have been used successfully in studies with human subjects. Studies have been performed examining the state of these receptors in patients compared to healthy controls in [[schizophrenia]], [[substance abuse]], [[mood disorder]]s and other psychiatric conditions. # [[Pharmacology]]: In pre-clinical trials, it is possible to [[isotopic labeling|radiolabel]] a new drug and inject it into animals. Such scans are referred to as biodistribution studies. The uptake of the drug, the tissues in which it concentrates, and its eventual elimination, can be monitored far more quickly and cost effectively than the older technique of killing and dissecting the animals to discover the same information. Much more commonly, however, drug occupancy at a purported site of action can be inferred indirectly by competition studies between unlabeled drug and radiolabeled compounds known apriori to bind with specificity to the site. A single radioligand can be used this way to test many potential drug candidates for the same target. A related technique involves scanning with radioligands that compete with an endogenous (naturally occurring) substance at a given receptor to demonstrate that a drug causes the release of the natural substance. #[[PET technology for small animal imaging]]: A miniature PET tomograph has been constructed that is small enough for a fully conscious and mobile rat to wear on its head while walking around.<ref>[http://www.chemistry.bnl.gov/ratcap/gallery.html Rat Conscious Animal PET]</ref> This RatCAP (Rat Conscious Animal PET) allows animals to be scanned without the confounding effects of [[anesthesia]]. PET scanners designed specifically for imaging rodents or small primates are marketed for academic and pharmaceutical research. #[[Musculo-Skeletal Imaging]]: PET has been shown to be a feasible technique for studying skeletal muscles during exercises like walking.<ref>Oi et al., ''FDG-PET imaging of
