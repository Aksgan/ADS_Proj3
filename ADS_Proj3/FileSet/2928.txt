Throughout its lifespan it was minimally updated, and is comparable to early versions of [[MacWrite]]. Early versions of Write only worked with Write (.wri) files, but with the modernization of [[Microsoft Word]] for Windows in 1989, and the introduction of [[Windows 3.0]] the following year, Write became capable of reading and composing early Word (.doc) documents. With Windows 3.1, Write became [[Object Linking and Embedding|OLE]] capable. Write is similar to the modern WordPad, which was introduced in [[Windows 95]], and like [[WordPad]], Write was more advanced than [[Notepad (Windows)|Notepad]] (though Notepad's simplicity is an intentional feature to make basic text operations faster and easier) and was considered a modern word processor. However, Write did not have the many features of software such as Microsoft Word. Write had automatic [[pagination]] which WordPad lacks. As its default program icon was a pen having just finished writing a capital letter A, the program was referred to by some users as 'A-Write'. In [[Windows 95]] and [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Write]] simply executes WordPad. == Microsoft Write for Atari ST == In 1986, [[Atari]] announced an agreement with Microsoft to bring Microsoft Write to the [[Atari ST]].<ref name="Microsoft Write for Atari ST">[http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue77/News_Products.php?tag= Atari announces agreement with Microsoft]</ref> Unlike the Windows version, Microsoft Write for the Atari ST was the Atari version of [[Microsoft Word]] 1.05 released for the [[Apple Macintosh]] while sharing the same name as the program included with [[Microsoft Windows]] during the 80s and early 90s.<ref name="Microsoft Word for Atari ST">[http://www.atarimagazines.com/v5n11/ataricorp.html?tag= Today's Atari Corp.: A close up look inside]</ref> While the program was announced in 1986, various delays caused the program to arrive in 1988.<ref name="Microsoft Write for Atari ST review">[http://www.atarimagazines.com/startv3n1/microsoftwrite.html?tag= Feature Review: Microsoft Write]</ref> The Atari version was a one time release and was never updated unlike the Windows versions which were updated minimally. Microsoft Write for the Atari ST retailed at $129.95 and was one of two high profile PC applications that were released on the Atari platform (the other application was [[WordPerfect]]). == Microsoft Write for Macintosh == In October 1987 Microsoft released Microsoft Write for Macintosh. Write was a version of Microsoft Word with limited features that Microsoft hoped would replace aging [[MacWrite]] in the Macintosh word processor market. Write was priced at $175, compared to Word's $395 and MacWrite's $125 pricetags. Write is best described as Word locked in "Short Menus" mode, and as such it used the same file format so that users could exchange files with absolutely no conversion necessary.<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=_z4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA45&dq=%22macintosh%22+%22microsoft+write&lr=&as_brr=0&cd=1#v=onepage&q=%22macintosh%22%20%22microsoft%20write&f=false</ref> Write didn't sell well and was discontinued before the [[System 7]] era. == References == {{reflist|1}} [[Category:Windows word processors]] [[Category:Windows components|Write]] [[Category:Atari ST software]] [[Category:Discontinued Windows components]] [[ca:Windows Write]] [[fr:Windows Write]] [[ko:윈도 라이트]] [[it:Windows Write]] [[he:Windows write]] [[pl:Windows Write]] [[ru:Windows Write]] [[sv:Windows Write]] [[zh:Windows Write]] {{windows-software-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>24512</id> <title>Microsoft text-to-speech voices</title> <text><!-- IF YOU DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO THIS MESSAGE, YOUR EDIT WILL BE ROLLED BACK WITHOUT WARNING.
