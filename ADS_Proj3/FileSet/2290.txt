further negotiations. The consultation, although not perfect, provides valuable information to the content owner and provides an indication as to the likely subscription revenue they will receive. ===Licensing online resources=== The licensing process can take a month or many months depending on the format of the online resource and the business model used. The licensing process can also be lengthened if a full service and interface needs to be developed to make the content usable. This requires JISC Collections to work with in partnership with the JISC data centres [http://www.edina.ac.uk EDINA] and [http://mimas.ac.uk MIMAS] to create a specification, build, test and implement a solution. Examples of where this has been required are the creation of an online film and sound collection at EDINA and a geospatial data collection at MIMAS. ===Economic models for online resources=== There are three main types of business models; the endorsement model and the heritage model and the declining subsidy model. The endorsement model is where JISC Collections licenses the content from the content owner and then sub-licenses it to the institutions. JISC Collections carries out all the administration for agreement managing the sub-licence agreement forms and the invoicing and also promotes the agreement to the community. The content owner sends an invoice to JISC Collections and the subscription income is passed to the content owner. This model can be applied to all format types. The heritage model is used only on static content such as archives and backfiles that are of high value to education and research. JISC Collections negotiates a perpetual licence to the content on a national level and pays the content owner a one-off payment. In effect, JISC Collections is purchasing and making the content free to all institutions. There is often a charge associated with the maintenance and hosting of the content. The declining subsidy model is reserved for innovative and specialist content that require the development of an interface and service. JISC Collections funds the service creation and maintenance and aims to decrease this subsidy over time as the resource becomes embedded. This model is also used to develop new business models such as moving a subscription based online resource into an open access resource. ===Promoting online resources=== Once the licensing is complete JISC Collections works collaboratively with the content owner to promote the online resource. Detailed information on the resource is placed on the JISC Collections website to allow an informed decision to be made as to whether a subscription will be taken out or not. A marketing plan can be worked out with the promotions manager to include a launch party, leaflets, posters and workshops. In the licence the content owner agrees to carry out a number of workshops to show how the resource can be used in e-learning and e-research. Promotional activities are reviewed in light of subscription rates. ===Online resource life cycle=== Online resources have a lifecycle within JISC Collections; for example a new resource requires more promotional activity than one that has been in the collection for a number of years or even one that was known to the community prior to a JISC Collections agreement. Apart from heritage models, licences are for three years. A year before the end of a licence agreement, JISC Collections will review the success, benefits and model used and carry out another community consultation to asses whether the agreement should be renewed for a further three years. ===Other JISC Collections activities=== In addition to the core services offered through JISC Collections, the team also commissions projects and reports, creates tools and runs workshops and events. ===JISC Collections in the news=== Some of the agreements negotiated by JISC Collections have been exemplary and highly innovative.
