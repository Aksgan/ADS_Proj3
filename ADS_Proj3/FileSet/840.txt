by the maximum number of transistors today. Although complex, the transistor count of CISC decoders do not grow exponentially like the total number of transistors per processor (the majority typically used for caches). Together with better tools and enhanced technologies, this has led to new implementations of highly encoded and variable length designs without load-store limitations (i.e. non-RISC). This governs re-implementations of older architectures such as the ubiquitous x86 (see below) as well as new designs for [[microcontroller]]s for [[embedded system]]s, and similar uses. The superscalar complexity in the case of modern x86 was solved with dynamically issued and buffered micro-operations, i.e. indirect and dynamic superscalar execution; the [[Pentium Pro]] and [[AMD K5]] are early examples of this. This allows a fairly simple superscalar design to be located after the (fairly complex) decoders (and buffers), giving, so to speak, the best of both worlds in many respects. ====CISC and RISC terms==== The terms CISC and RISC have become less meaningful with the continued evolution of both CISC and RISC designs and implementations. The first highly (or tightly) pipelined x86 implementations, the 486 designs from [[Intel]], [[AMD]], [[Cyrix]], and [[IBM]], supported every instruction that their predecessors did, but achieved ''maximum efficiency'' only on a fairly simple x86 subset that was only a little more than a typical RISC instruction set (i.e. without typical RISC ''[[load-store architecture|load-store]]'' limitations). The Intel [[P5 (microarchitecture)|P5]] [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] generation was a [[superscalar]] version of these principles. However, modern x86 processors also (typically) decode and split instructions into dynamic sequences of internal buffered [[micro-operations]], which not only helps execute a larger subset of instructions in a pipelined (overlapping) fashion, but also facilitates more advanced extraction of parallelism out of the code stream, for even higher performance. ==See also== {{Portal|Computer science}} *[[Central processing unit|CPU]] *[[RISC]] *[[ZISC]] *[[VLIW]] *[[CPU design]] *[[Computer architecture]] ==References== *Tanenbaum, Andrew S.
