the [[Atanasoff–Berry Computer]], the [[Colossus computer]]s, and the [[ENIAC]] were built by hand using circuits containing relays or valves (vacuum tubes), and often used [[punched card]]s or [[punched tape|punched paper tape]] for input and as the main (non-volatile) storage medium. Defining a single point in the series as the "first computer" misses many subtleties (see the table "Defining characteristics of some early digital computers of the 1940s" below).

Its main purpose was to prove that there were problems (namely the [[halting problem]]) that could not be solved by any sequential process. In doing so, Turing provided a definition of a universal computer which executes a program stored on tape. This construct came to be called a [[Turing machine]].<ref>[[Kurt Gödel]] (1964), p. 71, "Postscriptum" in [[Martin Davis]] (ed., 2004),''[http://books.google.com/books?id=qW8x7sQ4JXgC&dq=%23+%23+Martin+Davis+editor,+The+Undecidable,+Basic+Papers+on+Undecidable+Propositions,+Unsolvable+Problems+And+Computable+Functions,&printsec=frontcover&source=bn&hl=en&ei=Cf1cStGfN6TIMrmbgZIH&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4 The Undecidable]'' Fundamental papers by papers by Gödel, Church, Turing, and Post on this topic and the relationship to computability.

[[File:Largetape.jpg|thumb|Nine-track [[magnetic tape]]]] For a computing machine to be a practical general-purpose computer, there must be some convenient read-write mechanism, punched tape, for example. With a knowledge of Alan Turing's theoretical 'universal computing machine' [[John von Neumann]] defined an architecture which uses the same [[computer memory|memory]] both to store programs and data: virtually all contemporary computers use this architecture (or some variant). While it is theoretically possible to implement a full computer entirely mechanically (as Babbage's design showed), electronics made possible the speed and later the miniaturization that characterize modern computers. There were three parallel streams of computer development in the World War II era; the first stream largely ignored, and the second stream deliberately kept secret. The first was the German work of [[Konrad Zuse]]. The second was the secret development of the Colossus computers in the UK. Neither of these had much influence on the various computing projects in the United States. The third stream of computer development, Eckert and Mauchly's ENIAC and EDVAC, was widely publicized.<ref>{{harvnb|Moye|1996}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bergin|1996}}</ref> [[George Stibitz]] is internationally recognized as one of the fathers of the modern digital computer. While working at Bell Labs in November 1937, Stibitz invented and built a relay-based calculator that he dubbed the "Model K" (for "kitchen table", on which he had assembled it), which was the first to calculate using [[Binary numeral system|binary form]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Inventor Profile: George R. Stibitz|publisher=National Inventors Hall of Fame Foundation, Inc.|url=http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/140.html}}</ref> ====Zuse==== {{Main|Konrad Zuse}} [[File:Zuse Z1.jpg|thumb|A reproduction of Zuse's Z1 computer]] Working in isolation in Germany, [[Konrad Zuse]] started construction in 1936 of his first Z-series calculators featuring memory and (initially limited) programmability. Zuse's purely mechanical, but already binary [[Z1 (computer)|Z1]], finished in 1938, never worked reliably due to problems with the precision of parts. Zuse's later machine, the [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]],<ref>{{harvnb|Zuse}}</ref> was finished in 1941. It was based on telephone relays and did work satisfactorily. The Z3 thus became the first functional program-controlled, all-purpose, digital computer. In many ways it was quite similar to modern machines, pioneering numerous advances, such as [[Floating Point|floating point number]]s. Replacement of the hard-to-implement decimal system (used in [[Charles Babbage]]'s earlier design) by the simpler [[binary numeral system|binary]] system meant that Zuse's machines were easier to build and potentially more reliable, given the technologies available at that time. Programs were fed into [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]] on punched films. Conditional jumps were missing, but since the 1990s it has been proved theoretically that Z3 was still a [[Turing machine|universal computer]] (as always, ignoring physical storage limitations). In two 1936 [[patent]] applications, [[Konrad Zuse]] also anticipated that machine instructions could be stored in the same storage used for data—the key insight of what became known as the [[von Neumann architecture]], first implemented in the British [[Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine|SSEM]] of 1948.<ref>{{citation |title=Electronic Digital Computers |journal=Nature |date=25 September 1948 |volume=162 |page=487 |url=http://www.computer50.org/kgill/mark1/natletter.html |accessdate=2009-04-10}}</ref> Zuse also claimed to have designed the first higher-level [[programming language]], which he named [[Plankalkül]], in 1945 (published in 1948) although it was implemented for the first time in 2000 by a team around [[Raúl Rojas]] at the [[Free University of Berlin]]—five years after Zuse died. Zuse suffered setbacks during World War II when some of his machines were destroyed in the course of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombing campaigns. Apparently his work remained largely unknown to engineers in the UK and US until much later, although at least IBM was aware of it as it financed his post-war startup company in 1946 in return for an option on Zuse's patents. ====Colossus==== {{Main|Colossus computer}} [[File:Colossus.jpg|thumbnail|right|Colossus was used to break German ciphers during World War II.]] During World War II, the British at [[Bletchley Park]] (40 miles north of London) achieved a number of successes at breaking encrypted German military communications. The German encryption machine, [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]], was attacked with the help of electro-mechanical machines called ''[[bombe]]s''. The bombe, designed by [[Alan Turing]] and [[Gordon Welchman]], after the Polish cryptographic ''[[bomba (cryptography)|bomba]]'' by [[Marian Rejewski]] (1938), came into productive use in 1941.<ref> {{harvnb|Welchman|1984|pp=138–145, 295–309}}</ref> They ruled out possible Enigma settings by performing chains of logical deductions implemented electrically. Most possibilities led to a contradiction, and the few remaining could be tested by hand. The Germans also developed a series of teleprinter encryption systems, quite different from Enigma. The [[Lorenz SZ 40/42]] machine was used for high-level Army communications, termed "[[Tunny]]" by the British. The first intercepts of Lorenz messages began in 1941. As part of an attack on Tunny, Professor [[Max Newman]] and his colleagues helped specify the Colossus.<ref>{{harvnb|Copeland|2006}}</ref> The Mk I Colossus was built between March and December 1943 by [[Tommy Flowers]] and his colleagues at the [[Post Office Research Station]] at [[Dollis Hill]] in London and then shipped to [[Bletchley Park]] in January 1944.
