The DAI links the PICA database in institutional libraries with the METIS national [[Current Research Information System|research information system]]. The Digital Author Identification (DAI) is a unique national number for every author active within a Dutch university, [[Vocational university|university of applied sciences]] or research institute. The DAI is prepared for the international [[List of ISO standards|ISO standard]] “ISNI” ([[International Standard Name Identifier]]). The DAI brings several publications from an author together, and distinguishes between authors with the same name. == Other Author Identifiers == The DAI is part of the national knowledge infrastructure. In the [[scientific community]] other identifiers are in use as well, like ResearcherID<ref>[http://www.researcherid.com/ ResearcherID]</ref> or ScopusId<ref>[http://info.scopus.com/setup/admin/customizing/ ScopusID]</ref>. The DAI however is the only independent (non-commercial) number for the Dutch researcher. == DAI in connections == SURFfoundation<ref>[http://www.surffoundation.nl/en/Pages/default.aspx SURFfoundation]</ref> has, in cooperation with OCLC PICA<ref>[http://www.oclc.org/uk/en/default.htm OCLC PICA]</ref>, created a connection with PICA National Thesaurus Authornames (NTA) that is supplied and maintained by university libraries. Important herin is the connection between the researchinformation system Metis<ref>[http://metis.hosting.kun.nl/metis/default.cfm?i=aboutmetis Metis]</ref> and the repositories. == Applications == There are many potential applications of the DAI. Publications by an author can be collected more easily, even though the author may have worked at several institutions. When an author changes name, e.g. because of marriage, the DAI remains the same, enabling one to find publications from before the change of name. A case of an applications of the DAI is given by NARCIS<ref>[http://www.narcis.info/index NARCIS]</ref>. With a tool publicationslists can be generated on basis of the DAI. These publications are collected from the several repositories from Dutch scientific institutions. With the DAI this information can be presented integrated into one list. In July 2009 an article was published in the Dutch newspaper NRC titled “No names, numbers!”. This article was a reaction to the publication in [[The Lancet]] in June about the Thompson ResearcherID. Two Dutch researchers advocated in this article an independent author ID. However, they were ignorant of the DAI, which could provide the solution to their problem. ==See also== * [[ORCID]] * [[ResearcherID]] * [[VIAF]] == External links == * [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/323/5922/1662 Martin Enserink in Science, 27 march 2009, vol. 323, p.1662–1664 (not Open Access available)]. * [http://repinf.pbworks.com/Author-identification Author identification] == References == <references/> [[Category:Data modeling]][[Category:Identifiers]] [[nl:Digital Author Identification]]</text> </page> <page> <id>10335</id> <title>Digital Commons</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=November 2007}} '''Digital Commons''' is a hosted repository platform. This hosted service is licensed by the [[Berkeley Electronic Press]]. It is used by associations, consortia, universities and colleges to preserve and showcase their scholarly output. == History == [[Bepress]] first offered its institutional repository software in 2002 for the California Digital Library's eScholarship Repository.<ref>[http://repositories.cdlib.org/escholarship/repository_release.pdf eScholarship Repository Release], April 3, 2002</ref> Digital Commons was later introduced at the American Library Association annual conference in June 2004.<ref>[http://proquest.com/pressroom/pressrelease/04/20041112.shtml ProQuest's Digital Commons@ Winning Broad Market Acceptance], November 12, 2004 </ref> From 2004 to July 2007, Digital Commons was licensed exclusively by [[ProQuest|ProQuest Information and Learning]]. As of July 2007, the Berkeley Electronic Press has resumed licensing Digital Commons directly to customers. Today, the Bepress Institutional Repository platform powers over 50 schools (in addition to the University of California System) under the name Digital Commons.<ref>[http://digitalcommons.bepress.com/institutions.html Digital Commons Users]</ref> == Features == Institutions can add their content to their repository through batch uploads, by linking to external sites, or via a submit form. Digital Commons allows for a variety of publication types and auto-converts Word, [[WordPerfect]], and RTF documents to PDF. A unique web page is generated automatically for each article that includes title, author, abstract, and citation information. All pages maintain a persistent URL and meet [[web accessibility|web accessibility standards]]. Digital Commons supports data harvesting and feeding. Content is optimized for fast and accurate indexing by [[Google]] and [[Google Scholar]] and is OAI compliant. Digital Commons provides user notification tools. This includes RSS feeds and automatic email notification for reports of newly published content, Mailing list manager to announce new research, and the "Tell a colleague" email functionality. Digital Commons also provides individual readership statistics. == Institutions using Digital Commons == * [http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/ California Polytechnic State University - San Luis Obispo] * [http://sc.lib.muohio.edu/ Miami University] * [http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/ Cornell University] * [http://jdc.jefferson.edu/ Thomas Jefferson] * [http://ecommons.txstate.edu/ Texas State University - San Marcos] * [http://digitalcommons.bepress.com/institutions.html Complete list] * [http://digitalcommons.law.uga.edu/ University of Georgia School of Law] * [http://scholarworks.umass.edu/ University of Massachusetts - Amherst] * [http://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/ Macalester College - St. Paul,MN] * [http://epublications.bond.edu.au/ Bond University - Australia] * [http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/ McMaster University - Hamilton, Ontario] * [http://digitalcommons.library.tmc.edu/ Texas Medical Center Library - Houston, Texas] == References == {{Reflist}} == External links == * [http://www.bepress.com/ir Digital Commons homepage ] * [http://www.bepress.com/ Bepress Homepage] * [http://www.bepress.com/ir/faq.html FAQ] [[Category:Digital libraries]]</text> </page> <page> <id>10340</id> <title>Digital Dark Age</title> <text>The '''Digital Dark Age''' is a term used to describe a possible future situation where it will be difficult or impossible to read historical documents, because they have been stored in an obsolete digital format.The name derives from the [[Dark Ages]] in the sense that there would then be a relative lack of written record. ==About== The first published mention of the term might be at a conference of the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA) in 1997 .<ref name="Kuny"> {{cite journal | title = A Digital Dark Ages?
