in parallel algorithms, implementation strategies, and architectural and software support. In 2005, Steele began leading a team of researchers at Sun developing a new programming language named [[Fortress programming language|Fortress]], a high-performance language designed to obsolete [[Fortran]]. ===Books=== In 1982, Steele edited ''The Hacker's Dictionary'' (Harper&Row, 1983; ISBN 0-06-091082-8), which was a print version of the [[Jargon File]]. Steele and [[Samuel P. Harbison]] wrote ''C: A Reference Manual'', ([[Prentice-Hall]], 1984; ISBN 0-13-110016-5), to provide a precise description of the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], which Tartan Laboratories was trying to implement on a wide range of systems. Both authors participated in the ANSI C standardization process; several revisions of the book were issued to reflect the new standard. In 1984, Steele published ''[[Common Lisp the Language]]'' (Digital Press; ISBN 0-932376-41-X; 465 pages). This first edition was the original specification of [[Common Lisp]] ("CLtL1") and served as the basis for the ANSI standard. Steele released a greatly expanded second edition in 1990, (Digital Press; ISBN 1-55558-041-6; 1029 pages) which documented a near-final version of the ANSI standard.<ref>[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/cltl2.html]</ref> Steele, along with Charles H. Koelbel, David B. Loveman, Robert S. Schreiber, and Mary E. Zosel wrote ''The High Performance Fortran Handbook'' (MIT Press, 1994; ISBN 0-262-11185-3). Steele also coauthored all three editions of ''The Java Language Specification'' (Addison-Wesley, third ed. 2005; ISBN 0-321-24678-0) with [[James Gosling]], [[Bill Joy]], and [[Gilad Bracha]]. ==Awards== Steele received the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[Grace Murray Hopper Award]] in 1988. He was named an [[ACM Fellow]] in 1994, a member of the National Academy of Engineering of the United States of America in 2001 and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2002. He received the Dr. Dobb's Journal Excellence in Programming Award in 2005.

GEM is a gyrokinetic [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] turbulence simulation that uses the <math>\delta f</math> [[particle-in-cell]] method. It is used to study waves, instabilities and nonlinear behavior of tokamak fusion plasmas. Information about GEM can be found at the GEM web page.<ref>[http://cips.colorado.edu/simulation/gem.htm Plasma Simulation Group - Center for Integrated Plasma Studies<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> There are two versions of GEM, one is a flux-tube version <ref>A delta-f method for gyrokinetic simulations with kinetic electrons and electromagnetic perturbuations, Y. Chen and S. Parker, J. Comp. Phys. 189 463 (2003).</ref> and the other one is a global general geometry version.<ref>Electromagnetic gyrokinetic delta-f particle-in-cell turbulence simulation with realistic equilibrium profiles and geometry, Y. Chen and S. Parker, J. of Comp. Phys. 220 839 (2007)</ref> Both versions of GEM use a field-aligned coordinate system. Ions are treated kinetically, but averaged over their gyro-obits and electrons are treated as drift-kinetic. == The modeling of the tokamak plasmas== GEM solves the electromagnetic gyrokinetic equations which are the appropriate equations for well magnetized plasmas. The plasma is treated statistically as a kinetic distribution function. The [[distribution function]] depends on the three-dimensional position, the energy and magnetic moment. The time evolution of the distribution function is described by [[Gyrokinetics|gyrokinetic theory]] which simply averages the [[Vlasov equation#The Vlasov-Maxwell system of equations|Vlasov-Maxwell system of equations]] over the fast gyromotion associated with particles exhibiting cyclotron motion about the magnetic field lines. This eliminates fast time scales associated with the gyromotion and reduces the dimensionality of the problem from six down to five. == Algorithm to solve the equations== GEM uses the delta-f [[particle-in-cell]] (PIC) [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] simulation method. An expansion about an adiabatic response is made for electrons to overcome the limit of small time step, which is caused by the fast motion of electrons. GEM uses a novel electromagnetic algorithm allowing direct numerical simulation of the electromagnetic problem at high plasma pressures. GEM uses a two-dimensional domain decomposition (see [[domain decomposition method]]) of the grid and particles to obtain good performance on massively parallel computers. A [[Monte Carlo method]] is used to model small angle [[Coulomb collision]]s. == Applications== GEM is used to study nonlinear physics associated with [[tokamak]] plasma turbulence and transport. Tokamak turbulence driven by ion-temperature-gradient modes, electron-temperature gradient modes, trapped electron modes and micro-tearing modes has been investigated using GEM. It is also being used to look at energetic particle driven magnetohydrodynamic (see [[magnetohydrodynamics]]) eigenmodes. ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://cips.colorado.edu/simulation/index.htm http://cips.colorado.edu/simulation/index.htm] {{DEFAULTSORT:Gyrokinetic Electromagnetic}} [[Category:Plasma physics]] [[Category:Computational physics]] [[Category:Plasma modeling]] [[Category:Tokamaks]]</text> </page> <page> <id>15975</id> <title>H1ghlander</title> <text>{{Cleanup|date=March 2009}} [[Image:Highlanderstart.JPG|thumb|250px|H1ghlander beginning its part of the race.]] '''H1ghlander''' is an [[Unmanned ground vehicle|autonomous vehicle]]. Created by [[Carnegie Mellon University]]'s Red Team, it is a heavily modified 1999 [[Hummer H1|HUMMER H1]]. It competed in the 2005 [[DARPA Grand Challenge]]. The sensors used by H1ghlander include [[LIDAR]] laser-ranging units, one steerable LIDAR (in the globe on top), [[GPS]] and an [[inertial navigation system]]. The [[GPS]]/[[inertial navigation system|INS]] system was an [[Applanix]] POS/LV system. H1ghlander competed in the 2005 [[DARPA Grand Challenge]] on October 8, qualifying in the pole position and finished in 7 hours and 14 minutes, placing 3rd out of the five vehicles to complete the 132 mile (212 km) course.
