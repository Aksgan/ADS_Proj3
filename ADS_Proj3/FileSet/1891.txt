His primary research interests are autonomous mobile robotics and computational intelligence. He received several awards, e.g., the FUZZ-IEEE/IFES'95 robot intelligence award, NC2001 best presentation award, SSRR 2005 best paper award and the Ph.D. award for his thesis from the German AI institutes in 1996. His robot KURT3D won the second place in the [[RoboCup]] rescue robot league at the world championship in Lisbon in 2004.

The company's goal is to find new applications for robots. Their first planned robot will be used at container farms to space apart potted plants as they grow. This is a very labor-intensive job, and the robot to do it would be relatively simple, it would just need to pick up each potted plant and move it a little further from other plants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roboticstrends.com/article/print/roomba_co_inventors_shift_focus_to_cleaning_up_commercial_growing|title=Roomba co-Inventors Shift Focus to Cleaning Up Commercial Growing}}</ref> In January, 2010, the company received $4 million in financing from several investors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roboticstrends.com/service_robotics/article/harvest_automation_inc_receives_40m_series_a_financing|title=Harvest Automation, Inc.

It was proposed in March 1997 by [[Adam Back]] [http://www.hashcash.org/papers/announce.txt]. ==How it works== Hashcash is a method of adding a textual stamp to the [[header (information technology)|header]] of an email to prove the sender has expended a modest amount of CPU time calculating the stamp prior to sending the email. In other words, as the sender has taken a certain amount of time to generate the stamp and send the email, it is unlikely that they are a spammer. The receiver can, at negligible computational cost, verify that the stamp is valid. However, the only known way to find a header with the necessary properties
