The number of Iranian teams has been largely increasing over the past years. Thereby, the need to have a regional event seemed rather necessary. Furthermore, since the overall number world interested teams in RoboCup has increased; regional events may and can be a proper field for RoboCup leagues Technical Committees to see teams qualities for [[RoboCup World Competitions]]. IranOpen is a place for teams willing to take part in RoboCup World Competitions in order to show their qualities and standards. It is also a place for fresh teams to gain experience and become ready to join the world teams. == RoboCup == RoboCup is an international joint project to promote [[Artificial intelligence|AI]], [[robotics]], and related field. It is an attempt to foster AI and [[intelligent robotics]] research by providing a standard problem where wide range of technologies can be integrated and examined. RoboCup chose to use [[soccer]] game as a central topic of research, aiming at innovations to be applied for socially significant problems and industries. The ultimate goal of the RoboCup project is by 2050, develop a team of fully autonomous [[humanoid]] [[robot]]s that can win against the human world champion team in soccer. In order for a robot team to actually perform a soccer game, various technologies must be incorporated including: design principles of autonomous agents, multi-agent collaboration, [[strategy acquisition]], [[real-time reasoning]], robotics, and [[sensor-fusion]]. RoboCup is a task for a team of multiple fast-moving robots under a dynamic environment. RoboCup also offers a [[software platform]] for research on the [[software]] aspects of RoboCup. One of the major applications of RoboCup technologies is a [[search and rescue]] in large scale disaster. RoboCup initiated RoboCupRescue project to specifically promote research in socially significant issues. == IranOpen 2006 == [[Azad University of Qazvin]] as the pioneer in organizing a RoboCup event in Iran prepared a strong proposal for the RoboCup Federation which was then approved by the Federation to organize RoboCup IranOpen2006. RoboCup IranOpen2006 took place at [[Tehran International Fair]] from April 7 to April 9. It was the first but successful experience of organizing a RoboCup event in Iran. About 100 teams competed in 7 leagues and over 3000 visitors enjoined watching the games. == IranOpen 2007 == [[Azad University]] of [[Qazvin]] having the successful experience of organizing RoboCup IranOpen2006 decided to organize RoboCup IranOpen2007 in a more broad range. The proposal of the Azad University was approved by Iranian RoboCup National Committee and sent to the [[RoboCup Federation]] for final approval. It was then finally approved by the Federation. Therefore, RoboCup IranOpen2007 took place in Tehran International Fair from 5–7 April 2007. About 260 teams competed in 15 leagues and over 5000 visitors enjoyed watching the games. == IranOpen 2008 == Azad University of Qazvin for the third consequent year was approved by Iranian RoboCup National Committee to organize RoboCup IranOpen2008.
