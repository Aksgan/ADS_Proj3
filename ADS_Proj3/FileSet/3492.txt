crucial elements of the philosophies of [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Bernard Stiegler]]. Although the term "phenomenology" was used occasionally in the [[history of philosophy]] before [[Husserl]], modern use ties it more explicitly to his particular method. Following is a list of thinkers in rough chronological order who used the term "phenomenology" in a variety of ways, with brief comments on their contributions:<ref>Partially based on {{Citation |last= Schuhmann |first= Karl |year= 2004 |chapter="Phänomenologie": Eine Begriffsgeschichtilche Reflexion |editor-last= Leijenhorst |editor-first= Cees |editor2-last=Steenbakkers |editor2-first= Piet |title= Karl Schuhmann.

While this connection is somewhat tenuous, Hume, in [[A Treatise of Human Nature]], does seem to take a phenomenological or psychological approach by describing the process of reasoning causality in psychological terms. This is also the inspiration for the Kantian distinction between [[phenomenon|phenomenal]] and [[noumenon|noumenal]] reality.<ref>Ernest Campbell Mossner. The Life of David Hume.

Engelmann, reprint 1894.</ref> * [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804), in the [[Critique of Pure Reason]], distinguished between objects as [[phenomenon|phenomena]], which are objects as shaped and grasped by human sensibility and understanding, and objects as ''things-in-themselves'' or [[noumena]], which do not appear to us in space and time and about which we can make no legitimate judgments. * [[G.W.F. Hegel]] (1770–1831) challenged Kant's doctrine of the unknowable thing-in-itself, and declared that by knowing phenomena more fully we can gradually arrive at a consciousness of the absolute and spiritual truth of Divinity. Hegel's ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', published in 1807, prompted many opposing views, including the existential work of [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Martin Heidegger]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], as well as the materialist work of [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and his many followers. * [[Franz Brentano]] (1838–1917) seems to have used the term in some of his lectures at [[Vienna]], where [[Edmund Husserl]] studied with him and came under his influence. * [[Carl Stumpf]] (1848–1936), student of Brentano and mentor to Husserl, used "phenomenology" to refer to an ontology of sensory contents. * [[Edmund Husserl]] (1859–1938) established phenomenology at first as a kind of "descriptive psychology" and later as a transcendental and [[eidetic]] science of consciousness. He is considered to be the founder of contemporary phenomenology. * [[Max Scheler]] (1874–1928) developed further the phenomenological method of Edmund Husserl and extended it to include also a reduction of the [[scientific method]]. He influenced the thinking of [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Dietrich von Hildebrand]], and [[Edith Stein]]. * [[Martin Heidegger]] (1889–1976) criticized Husserl's theory of phenomenology and attempted to develop a theory of [[ontology]] that led him to his original theory of [[Dasein]], the non-dualistic human being. * [[Alfred Schütz]] (1899–1959) developed a phenomenology of the social world on the basis of everyday experience which has influenced major sociologists such as [[Harold Garfinkel]], [[Peter L. Berger|Peter Berger]], and [[Thomas Luckmann]]. * [[Graham Harman]] (1968 - ) Although working from within phenomenology, Harman finds the broad history of phenomenology to be deficient in that it constantly subordinates the independent life of objects to our (human) access to them. His radical break with the traditional use of terms such as [[intentionality]] as well as a fresh approach to [[metaphysics]], stems from his greatest influences by such as the great phenomenologists [[Alphonso Lingis]], [[Husserl]], [[Ortega y Gasset]], [[Zubiri]], and [[Heidegger]]. Harman's thought is perhaps the first to combine phenomenology with speculative philosophers such as [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]], [[Leibniz]], and the sort of radical thinking typified by [[Speculative Realism]]. Later usage is mostly based on or (critically) related to Husserl's introduction and use of the term. This branch of philosophy differs from others in that it tends to be more "descriptive" than "[[Prescription and description|prescriptive]]". ==List of important phenomenologists and phenomenology-derived theorists== {{col-begin}} {{col-4}} * [[Alfred Adler]] (psychiatrist) * [[Hannah Arendt]] * [[St. Augustine of Hippo]] * [[Peter L.
