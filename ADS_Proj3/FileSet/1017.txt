experimentation. They were frequently used for anti-personnel, though the Cyborg Commando proved to be useful in most situations. Cyborgs were brought back by the [[AI]] named [[Nod characters of Command & Conquer#LEGION|LEGION]], (a predecessor to [[CABAL]]) under direct orders from [[Kane (Command & Conquer)|Kane]]. The 'Marked of Kane' units also contain Cyborgs. The [[Metal Gear Solid]] series of video games has a recurring character known as [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Grey Fox|Grey Fox]] or the "Cyborg Ninja" who is a person wearing a cybernetic exoskeleton (either worn as a suit or grafted directly to the character's body) and wielding a high-frequency blade. The cyborg ninja suit has been donned by multiple characters, most recently by the character [[Raiden (Metal Gear)|Raiden]] in ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]''. He became the newest incarnation of the Cyborg Ninja after he was captured by [[Patriots (Metal Gear)|The Patriots]] after he stole the body of [[Big Boss (Metal Gear)|Big Boss]] for the Paradise Lost Army. His body was heavily experimented on for the purpose of creating the ultimate soldier and the only remaining organic parts of his original body are his head and spinal cord. His cyborg body is composed of artificial muscle, organs, bones, and blood( a "white" artificial blood that the PLA substituted for his old, [[nanomachine]] primed blood). His cyborg body was optimized for war and enabled him to fight on a superhuman level and withstand what would normally be considered fatal injuries. One of the most famous cyborgs is [[Darth Vader]] from the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films. Vader was once [[Anakin Skywalker]], a famous [[Jedi]] turned to the Dark Side. After a furious battle with his former master, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], Anakin is left for dead beside a lava flow on Mustafar, and is outfitted with an artificial life support system as well as robotic arms and legs. [[General Grievous]], [[List of Star Wars characters#L|Lobot]], and [[Luke Skywalker]] are the three other most prominent cyborgs in the Star Wars universe. In [[Akira Toriyama]]'s ''[[manga]]'' and ''[[anime]]'' series ''[[Dragon Ball]]''', a scientist named [[Dr. Gero]] created several [[cyborgs]], including villain [[Cell (Dragon Ball)|Cell]], sibling cyborgs [[Android 17]] and [[Android 18]], as well as [[Android 20]], who was built from Gero himself. A direct brain-to-computer interface is a valuable, but expensive, luxury in [[Larry Niven]] and [[Jerry Pournelle]]'s novel ''[[Oath of Fealty (novel)|Oath of Fealty]]''. In the ''manga'' and ''anime'' series ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'', Motoko Kusanagi lived in a world where the majority of adults are cyborgs and can connect wirelessly to the Internet for real-time communication and data research. The most common augmentation in the series were artificial brains called cyberbrains. [[Bruce Sterling]] in his universe of [[Shaper/Mechanist]] suggested an idea of alternative cyborg called [[lobster (cyborg)|Lobster]], which is made not by using internal implants, but by using an external shell (''e.g.'' a [[Artificial powered exoskeleton|Powered Exoskeleton]]).<ref>Sterling, Bruce. Schismatrix. Arbor House. 1985.</ref> Unlike human cyborgs that appear human externally while being synthetic internally, a Lobster looks inhuman externally but contains a human internally. The computer game ''[[Deus Ex: Invisible War]]'' prominently featured the [[Omar (Deus Ex)|Omar]], where "Omar" is a Russian translation of the word "Lobster" (since the Omar are of Russian origin in the game). In the ''Brain and Brawn'' series of novels series by [[Anne McCaffrey]] and others, beginning with ''[[The Ship Who Sang]]'', a "brainship" is a human body, usually one that could not develop normally, encased in the strongest materials available in that universe, and mentally connected to the controls of a spacecraft. Later novels link the brainship to fully functional humanoid androids. ==Written fiction== *In the story ''[[The Ablest Man in the World]]'' (1879), by [[Edward Page Mitchell]], a computer is inserted into a man's head, turning him into a genius. *The [[Tin Woodman]] from [[L. Frank Baum]]'s [[The Oz books|Oz books]] (at least before he became entirely metal). *The [[Mi-go]] aliens in the [[Cthulhu Mythos]] of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], first appearing in the story "[[The Whisperer in Darkness]]" (1931), can transport humans from Earth to Pluto (and beyond) and back again by removing the subject's [[brain]] and placing it into a "brain cylinder", which can be attached to external devices to allow it to see, hear, and speak. *Deirdre, a famous dancer who was burned nearly completely and whose brain was placed in a faceless but beautiful mechanical body, in [[C. L. Moore]]'s short story of 1944, "No Woman Born". Collected in "The Best of C. L. Moore" in 1975 *Jonas the (star) sailor in [[Gene Wolfe]]'s ''[[The Book of the New Sun|Book of the New Sun]]'' novels. His near light speed ship had been gone so long that on its return to Urth, there were no space port facilities any more, and it crashed. Other crew members patched him up from available parts. (However, he started out as fully robotic, and was repaired with human parts, rather than the more usual reverse). *[[Molly Millions]], Henry Dorsett Case, and Peter Riviera all have some sort of cybernetic augmentation in [[William Gibson]]'s [[Sprawl trilogy]].<ref>Gibson, William. Neuromancer </ref> *Professor Jameson, a cyborg [[pulp magazine|pulp]] hero by [[Neil R. Jones]], and his allies and benefactors, the Zoromes. *[[Marge Piercy]]'s ''[[He, She and It]]'' presents a rather feminist view on the cyborg issue with ''Yod'' who, however, is provided with some male attributes. *[[Anne McCaffrey]] wrote short stories and novels known as ''[[Anne Mccaffrey#The Brain & Brawn Ship series|The Ship Series]]'' (1961-) where otherwise crippled humans live on as the brains of starships and large space stations. *The genetically engineered and prosthetics-ready warriors of the planet Sauron in the ''[[CoDominium]]'' series of short stories and novels initiated by [[Jerry Pournelle]] and also written by guest authors. *In [[Martin Caidin]]'s novel, ''[[Cyborg (novel)|Cyborg]]'', a test pilot is rebuilt after a horrendous crash, given new "bionic" limbs, and becomes a superspy. Followed by several sequel novels and also adapted as the TV series ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]''. *Angus Thermopyle, ''[[The Gap Cycle]]''. *Haberman and Scanners from
