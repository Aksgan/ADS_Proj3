a [[Fu Manchu moustache|Fu Manchu]]-style moustache, presumably to give him a more "ethnic" countenance. It cannot be ascertained whether Long or someone else is responsible for these alterations; given that all of his other illustrations in ''Mystic China'' were also taken from other titles, it is unclear whether or not he was involved in the book's production.</ref> It is frequently the case that these illustrations are not reproduced in their entirety, portions having been trimmed away or the image itself reoriented in order to frame and focus upon certain elements or merely conform to space limitations.<ref group="nb">Long's quarter-page illustration in ''Rifts Conversion Book'' (Siembieda 1991, p. 83) of a [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] atop a mountain - clouds swirling overhead as he calls down a bolt of lightning from the sky - has been featured, at least in part, among several other Palladium titles. Small segments of the image, vaguely centered on the eye of the vortex (and not showing much else), are found serving as placeholders on page 67 of ''Rifts World Book Two: Atlantis'' (Siembieda, Sheiring, & Marciniszyn 1992), and again - reframed slightly and turned upside down, for no discernible reason - on page 144 of ''Rifts World Book 18: Mystic Russia'' (Siembieda, Sumimoto, & Cartier 1998). In all cases, the illustration's provenance is not indicated.</ref> Subsequently, the signature or identifying mark of the artist - traditionally located at or near the margins of the work - may be omitted, which can make it difficult to determine a given illustration's authorship. Such is the case with many of Long's contributions to Palladium; despite having received attribution on a given book's title page, often the sole means of identifying specific instances of his work is through recognition of his singular style and technique.<ref group="nb">There are a number of titles published just before and then following Long's separation from Palladium in which his work was used but his name was not correspondingly listed on their respective title pages. Several of them - ''[[Nightbane]]'' (Carella & Siembieda 1995, p. 186); ''The Rifter Number 7'' (Smith ed. 1999, p. 70); ''Rifts Aftermath'' (Siembieda & Coffin 2002, p. 45); etc. - involve large or otherwise full-page illustrations. In certain cases, there would appear to be a catchall category - such as "other Palladium madmen" in ''The Rifter'' - designed to cover any contributors not specifically mentioned, but the work is still listed as "uncredited" for purposes of this section.</ref> (It should be pointed out that Long is not the only artist employed by Palladium, whether past or present, for whom this holds true.) ====Beyond the Supernatural==== * {{Cite book | last = McCall | first = R. | first2 = K. | last2 = Siembieda | authorlink2 = Kevin Siembieda | first3 = E. | last3 = Wujcik | authorlink3 = Erick Wujcik | title = [[Beyond the Supernatural]] | edition = 1st <!-- | series = Beyond the Supernatural, 1st ed. --> | year = 1987 | month = October <!-- | publisher = Palladium Books | location = Detroit, MI --> | isbn = 0-916211-18-5 <!-- | pages = 12, 42, 50, 52, 58, 59, 61, 65, 67, 83, 92, 94, 96, 114, 121, 182, 221 --> | separator = , | lastauthoramp = & }} [Out of Print] - Interior art. * {{Cite book | last = Siembieda | first = K. | first2 = K. | last2 = Long | first3 = E. | last3 = Wujcik | title = Boxed Nightmares: An Adventure Sourcebook for Beyond the Supernatural <!-- | series = Beyond the Supernatural, 1st ed. --> | year = 1990 | month = October <!-- | publisher = Palladium Books | location = Taylor, MI --> | isbn = 0-916211-41-X <!-- | pages = 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 11, 18–20, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 37, 39, 41–43, 45, 46, 48, 50–52, 54, 58, 61, 62, 65, 68, 72–74, 78, 79 --> | separator = , | lastauthoramp = & }} [Out of Print] - Additional text and ideas, interior art and photographs. ====Heroes Unlimited==== * {{Cite book | last = Long | first = K. | first2 = K. | last2 = Siembieda | first3 = S. | last3 = Sheiring | first4 = A. | last4 = Marciniszyn | first5 = J. | last5 = Rosenstein | first6 = E. | last6 = Wujcik | first7 = M. | last7 = Gustovich | first8 = A. | last8 = Donald-Siembieda | title = Villains Unlimited: A Sourcebook for [[Heroes Unlimited]] | edition = 1st <!-- | series = Heroes Unlimited, 1st ed. --> | year = 1992 | month = May <!-- | publisher = Palladium Books | location = Taylor, MI --> | isbn = 0-916211-49-5 <!-- | pages = 7, 10, 15, 43, 46, 47, 68, 70, 71, 73, 74, 76, 78, 79, 82, 83, 87, 91, 100, 102, 104, 106–109, 112–113, 120–122, 124, 126, 129, 131, 133, 136, 141, 142, 144, 146–149, 151, 152, 154, 158–159, 163, 169, 174, 177, 178, 182, 186, 189, 200, 202, 204, 210, 214, Front and back covers --> | separator = , | lastauthoramp = & }} [Out of Print] - Author, cover and interior art. * {{Cite book | last = Breaux | first = W., Jr. | first2 = K. | last2 = Siembieda | title = Aliens Unlimited: A Sourcebook for Heroes Unlimited | edition = 1st <!-- | series = Heroes Unlimited, 1st ed. --> | year = 1994 | month = December <!-- | publisher = Palladium Books | location = Taylor, MI --> | isbn = 0-916211-76-2 <!-- | page = Front cover | nopp = y --> | separator = , | lastauthoramp = & }} [Out of Print] - Cover art. * {{Cite book | last = Siembieda | first = K. | first2 = W., Jr. | last2 = Breaux | first3 = E. | last3 = Wujcik | first4 = K. | last4
