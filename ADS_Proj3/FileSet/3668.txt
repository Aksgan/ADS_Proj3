that Eve has only negligible information about the new key. This can be done using a [[universal hashing|universal hash function]], chosen at random from a publicly known set of such functions, which takes as its input a binary string of length equal to the key and outputs a binary string of a chosen shorter length. The amount by which this new key is shortened is calculated, based on how much information Eve could have gained about the old key (which is known due to the errors this would introduce), in order to reduce the probability of Eve having any knowledge of the new key to a very low value. == Implementations == === Experimental === The highest bit rate system currently demonstrated exchanges secure keys at 1 Mbit/s (over 20 km of optical fibre) and 10 kbit/s (over 100 km of fibre), achieved by a collaboration between the [[University of Cambridge]] and [[Toshiba]] using the [[BB84]] protocol with decoy pulses.<ref>[http://www.opticsinfobase.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-16-23-18790 A.

Physical Review Letters 98.1 010504 (2007)</ref> The experiments suggest transmission to satellites is possible, due to the lower atmospheric density at higher altitudes. For example although the minimum distance from the [[International Space Station]] to the [[ESA Space Debris Telescope]] is about 400 km, the atmospheric thickness is about an order of magnitude less than in the European experiment, thus yielding less attenuation compared to this experiment. === Commercial === There are currently four companies offering commercial quantum key distribution systems; [[id Quantique]] (Geneva), [http://magiqtech.com MagiQ Technologies] (New York), [http://www.smartquantum.com SmartQuantum] (France) and [http://www.quintessencelabs.com Quintessence Labs] (Australia). Several other companies also have active research programmes, including [[Toshiba]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[IBM]], [[Mitsubishi]], [[NEC]] and [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone|NTT]] (See [[#External links|External links]] for direct research links). Quantum encryption technology provided by the Swiss company [[Id Quantique]] was used in the Swiss canton (state) of Geneva to transmit ballot results to the capitol in the national election occurring on October 21, 2007.<ref>[http://www.technewsworld.com/story/59793.html http://www.technewsworld.com/story/59793.html] ''technewsworld.com''</ref> In 2004, the world's first bank transfer using quantum key distribution was carried in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].

The name of this network is [[Secure Communication based on Quantum Cryptography|SECOQC]] ('''Se'''cure '''Co'''mmunication Based on '''Q'''uantum '''C'''ryptography) and [[EU]] funded this project. The network used 200 km of standard [[fibre optic cable]] to interconnect six locations across Vienna and the town of [[St Poelten]] located 69 km to the west.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7661311.stm 'Unbreakable' encryption unveiled]</ref> ==== Tokyo QKD Network ==== The Tokyo QKD Network<ref>[http://www.uqcc2010.org/highlights/index.html Tokyo QKD Network unveiled at UQCC 2010]</ref> was inaugurated on the first day of the UQCC2010 conference. The network involves an international collaboration between 7 partners; [[NEC]], [[Mitsubishi Electric]], [[NTT]] and [[NICT]] from Japan, and participation from Europe by [[Toshiba]] Research Europe Ltd. (UK), [[Id Quantique]] (Switzerland) and All Vienna (Austria). "All Vienna" is represented by researchers from the [[Austrian Institute of Technology]] (AIT), the [[Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information]] (IQOQI) and the [[University of Vienna]]. == Attacks == === Example: Intercept and resend === The simplest type of possible attack is the intercept-resend attack, where Eve measures the quantum states (photons) sent by Alice and then sends replacement states to Bob, prepared in the state she measures. In the BB84 protocol, this produces errors in the key Alice and Bob share. As Eve has no knowledge of the basis a state sent by Alice is encoded in, she can only guess which basis to measure in, in the same way as Bob. If she chooses correctly, she measures the correct photon polarization state as sent by Alice, and resends the correct state to Bob. However, if she chooses incorrectly, the state she measures is random, and the state sent to Bob cannot be the same as the state sent by Alice. If Bob then measures this state in the same basis Alice sent, he too gets a random result&mdash;as Eve has sent him a state in the opposite basis&mdash; with a 50% chance of an erroneous result (instead of the correct result he would get without the presence of Eve). The table below shows an example of this type of attack. {| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center; margin: 1em auto 1em auto" |- !
