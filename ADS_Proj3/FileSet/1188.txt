2006</ref> ==Accomplishments== Digital supported the [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] standards, especially the [[ASCII]] character set, which survives in [[Unicode]] and the [[ISO 8859]] character set family. Digital's own [[Multinational Character Set]] also had a large influence on [[ISO 8859-1]] (Latin-1) and, by extension, [[Unicode]]. The first versions of the [[C (programming language)|C]] language and the [[Unix]] operating system ran on Digital's [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]] series of computers (first on a PDP-7, then the [[PDP-11]]'s), which were among the first commercially viable [[minicomputer]]s, although for several years Digital itself did not encourage the use of Unix. Digital also produced the popular [[VAX]] computer family, the first pure 64-bit microprocessor architecture ([[DEC Alpha|Alpha AXP]]), the first commercially successful workstation (the VT-78), and some commercially unsuccessful personal computers. The central computing system of the Soviet reusable [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]] spaceship was based on two MicroVAX computers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Digital produced widely used interactive operating systems, including [[OS/8|OS-8]], [[TOPS-10]], [[TOPS-20]], [[RSTS/E]], [[RSX-11]], [[RT-11]], and [[OpenVMS]]. PDP computers, in particular the [[PDP-11]] model, inspired a generation of programmers and software developers. Some [[PDP-11]] systems more than 25 years old (software and hardware) are still being used to control and monitor factories, transportation systems and nuclear plants. Digital was an early champion of [[time-sharing]] systems. Digital was to the command-line interface (CLI) what Apple was to the GUI {{Dubious|date=March 2009}}: there was history before and innovation after, but it was Digital's operating systems that put it together in a complete and definitive form {{Dubious|date=March 2009}}. The command-line interfaces found in Digital's systems, eventually codified as [[DIGITAL Command Language|DCL]], would look familiar to any user of modern microcomputer CLIs; those used in earlier systems, such as [[Compatible Time-Sharing System|CTSS]], [[IBM]]'s [[Job Control Language|JCL]], or [[Univac]]'s time-sharing systems, would look utterly alien. Many features of the CP/M and MS-DOS CLI show a recognizable family resemblance to Digital's OSes, including command names such as DIR and HELP and the "name-dot-extension" file naming conventions. VAX and [[MicroVAX]] computers (very widespread in the 1980s) running [[Virtual Memory System|VMS]] formed one of the most important proprietary networks, [[DECnet]], which linked business and research facilities. The [[DECnet]] protocols formed one of the first peer-to-peer networking standards, with DECnet phase I being released in the mid-1970s. Email, file sharing, and distributed collaborative projects existed within the company long before their value was recognized in the market. Digital, Intel and Xerox through their collaboration to create the DIX standard, were champions of [[Ethernet]], but Digital is the company that made Ethernet commercially successful. Initially, Ethernet-based DECnet and [[Local Area Transport|LAT]] protocols interconnected VAXes with DECserver terminal servers. Starting with the UNIBUS to Ethernet adapter, multiple generations of Ethernet controllers from Digital were the de facto standard. The CI "computer interconnect" adapter was the industry's first network interface controller to use separate transmit and receive "rings". Digital also invented [[Computer cluster|clustering]], an operating system technology that treated multiple machines as one logical entity. Clustering permitted sharing of pooled disk and tape storage via the HSC50/70/90 and later series of Hierarchical Storage Controllers. HSCs delivered the first hardware RAID 0 and 1 capabilities and the first serial interconnects of multiple storage technologies. This technology was the forerunner to systems like [[Network of Workstations]] which are used for massively cooperative tasks such as web-searches and drug research. The LA36 and LA120 dot matrix printers became industry standards and may have hastened the demise of the [[teleprinter|Teletype Corporation]]. The [[VT100]] [[computer terminal]] became the industry standard, implementing a useful subset of the [[ANSI X3.64]] standard, and even today terminal emulators such as [[HyperACCESS|HyperTerminal]], [[PuTTY]] and [[Xterm]] still emulate a VT100 (or its more capable successor, the [[VT220]]). The [[X Window System]], the network transparent window system used on UNIX and Linux, and also available on other operating systems, was developed at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] jointly between [[Project Athena]] and the [[Laboratory for Computer Science]]. Digital was the primary sponsor for this project, which was one of the first large scale free software projects,{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}<!-- need reliable sources for "one of the first", and "free software", the latter since "free" was perhaps not an original goal --> a contemporary of the [[GNU Project]] but not associated with it. [[Dave Cutler]], who led the development of [[RSX-11]]M, [[RSX-11]]M+, [[Virtual Memory System|VMS]] and then [[VAXeln]], left Digital in 1988 to lead the development of [[Windows NT]] which was initially intended to be an "open" [[operating system]] that would run on more powerful processors than the existing predominant [[x86]] architecture. While DEC did see value in continuing its [[X Window System]] environment to support engineering customers, it understood that future mid-range based customers would demand a faster and more user friendly [[Graphical User Interface]] (GUI), potentially offered through the Windows environment.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} As Microsoft had experience, technology and patents that would give them upper hand in advancing GUI technology, DEC opted to partner with Microsoft's development of Windows NT for mid-range processors and share in the R&D process of creating faster computers using their [[RISC]] [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] processors.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Microsoft was not exclusively bound to the Alpha chip so it pursued other processor makers such as IBM with the [[PowerPC]] architecture and eventually capitalized on the emerging strength of the Intel x86 based processors. While most would say that the market determined its own course through the more cost efficient processors produced by Intel, DEC quickly came to realize that its loose partnership with Microsoft would lead to its own undoing in terms of being a major player in the mid-range processor market. Notes-11 and its follow-on product, VAXnotes, were two of the first examples of online collaboration software, a category that has become to be known as [[Collaborative software|groupware]]. [[Len Kawell]], one of the original Notes-11 developers later joined [[Lotus Development Corporation]] and contributed to their [[Lotus Notes]] product.
