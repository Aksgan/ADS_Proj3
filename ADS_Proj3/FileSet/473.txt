The Foundation for Environmental Education in Europe (FEEE) presented the concept of the Blue Flag to the Commission, and it was agreed to launch the Blue Flag Programme as one of several "European Year of the Environment" activities in the Community. The French concept of the Blue Flag was developed on European level to include other areas of environmental management, such as waste management and coastal planning and protection. Besides beaches marinas also became eligible for the Blue Flag. In 1987, 244 beaches and 208 marinas from 10 countries were awarded the Blue Flag. ===Success=== There have been increases in the numbers of Blue Flags awarded each year. The criteria have during these years been changed to more strict criteria. As an example, in 1992 the Programme started using the restrictive guideline values in the EEC Bathing Water Directive as imperative criteria, and this was also the year where all Blue Flag criteria became the same in all participating countries ===Outside the European Union=== In 2001, FEEE rules were changed to allow non-European national organisations, sharing the objectives of FEEE, to become members, and changed its name by dropping Europe from its name, becoming the Foundation for Environmental Education (FEE). Several organisations and authorities outside the European Union have joined FEE. FEE has been cooperating with UNEP and UN WTO on extending the Programme to areas outside Europe. South Africa, Canada, Morocco, Tunisia, New Zealand and four countries in the Caribbean region are members of FEE. Aruba, Brazil and Malta are currently in the pilot phase of the Programme and Jordan, Macedonia, Turks & Caicos Islands, Ukraine and United Arab Emirates have started the implementation of the Blue Flag Programme. FEE standards allow for regional variations in beach criteria to reflect specific environmental conditions of a region. As of 2006 an international set of criteria is being used with some variations. ===Present program=== In 2010 over 3450 beaches and marinas globally were awarded the Blue Flag. 41 countries are currently participating in the Blue Flag Programme: [[Aruba]], [[Bahamas]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Canada]], [[Chile]], [[Croatia]], [[Cyprus]], [[Denmark]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Iceland]], [[Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Jamaica]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Malta]], [[Montenegro]], [[Morocco]], [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Russia]], [[Romania]], [[Slovenia]], [[South Africa]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Tunisia]], [[Turkey]] and [[United Kingdom]] Eight countries are currently running the programme in the pilot phase.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} ==Blue Flag beach criteria== [[File:Blaue Flagge hr 2007.jpg|thumb|Blue Flag beach in [[Selce]], [[Croatia]]]] ===Environmental Education and Information=== *Information relating to [[coastal zone]] ecosystems and natural, sensitive areas in the coastal zone must be displayed *Information about bathing water quality must be displayed *Information about the Blue Flag Programme must be displayed *[[Code of conduct]] for the beach area must be displayed and the laws governing beach use must
