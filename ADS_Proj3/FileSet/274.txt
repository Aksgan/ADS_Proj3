a 30-day fully functional version in which you can save, print and publish projects. File formats are fully compatible with the commercial version once the copy of ArchiCAD has been converted to a commercial license. The trial version is protected by registration numbers. === Languages and localizations === ArchiCAD is available in a number of localized versions. In addition to a translated user interface and documentation, these versions have a set of parametric objects (object libraries) developed taken into consideration the specific requirements of the regional market, and different default values for object properties, menu arrangements, etc. * English versions :* International (INT) (metric) :* US Version (USA) (imperial) :* Australian (AUS) :* New Zealand (NZE) * German versions :* Germany (GER) :* Austria (AUT) :* Switzerland (CHE) * Spanish Version (SPA) * French Version (FRA) * Italian Version (ITA) * Portuguese Version (POR) * Russian Version (RUS) * Japanese Version (JPN) * Polish Version (POL) * Czech Version (CZE) * Hungarian Version (HUN) * Dutch Version (NED) * Finnish Version (FIN) * Swedish Version (SWE) * Norwegian Version (NOR) * Danish Version (DEN) * Turkish Version (TUR) * Greek Version (GRE) * Simplified Chinese Version (CHI) * Traditional Chinese Version (TAI) * Korean Version (KOR) == Features == === Working with parametric objects === ArchiCAD allows the user to work with data-enhanced parametric objects, often called "smart objects" by users. This differs from the operational style of other CAD programs created in the 1980s. The product allows the user to create a "virtual building" with virtual structural elements like walls, slabs, roofs, doors, windows and furniture. A large variety of pre-designed, [[ArchiCAD library part|customizable objects]] come with the program. ArchiCAD allows the user to work with either a 2D or 3D representation on the screen. Two-dimensional drawings can be exported at any time, even though the model in the program's database always stores data in three dimensions. Plans, elevations, and sections are generated from the three dimensional virtual building model and are constantly updated if the user 'rebuilds' the view. Detail drawings are based on enlarged portions of the model, with 2D detail added in. === Collaboration and remote access === ArchiCAD released its first file exchange based Teamwork solution in its version 5.1 in 1997 which allowed more architects to work on the same building model simultaneously. A completely rewritten Teamwork "2.0" solution with a new database approach came out in version 13 in 2009 named Graphisoft BIM Server. Since only the changes and differences are sent to the central storage this solution allows remote access to the same project over the internet thus allowing worldwide project collaboration and coordination. === APIs and scripting === Third-party vendors and some manufacturers of architectural products have compiled libraries of architectural components for use in ArchiCAD. The program includes Geometric Description Language ([[Geometric Description Language|GDL]]) used to create new components. Also API (Application Programming Interface) and ODBC database connections are supported), for third party Add-On developers. Via direct API links to 4D and 5D software such as Vico Office Suite or Tocoman iLink, ArchiCAD model can be exported to BIM-based cost estimation and scheduling. ArchiCAD is also directly linked via API to Solibri's Model checking and quality assurance tools. === Data interchange === ArchiCAD can import and export [[.dwg|DWG]], [[DXF]] and [[Industry Foundation Classes|IFC]] files among others. Graphisoft is an active member of the International Alliance for Interoperability (IA), an industry organization that publishes standards for file and data interoperability for architectural CAD. == Extensions == Various free and commercial add-on products and extensions add extra functionality to ArchiCAD or provide further data exchange possibilities with other software applications. Some of these extensions are developed by [[Graphisoft]], such as the freely available [[Google SketchUp]], [[Google Earth]] or [[Cinema 4D]] import/export add-ons or other extensions sold separately such as [[Graphisoft MEP Modeler]], [[Graphisoft EcoDesigner]] or Graphisoft [[Virtual Building Explorer]]; while there are a number of add-ons provided by third party vendors, such as [[Cigraph]] or [[Cadimage]]. == Version history == * 1984 - Radar CH (ArchiCAD 1.0) * 1986 - ArchiCAD 2.0 * 1987 - ArchiCAD 3.0 * 1988 - ArchiCAD 3.1 * 1991 - ArchiCAD 4.1 * 1993 - ArchiCAD 4.12 * 1994 - ArchiCAD 4.5 * 1995 - ArchiCAD 4.55 * 1996 - ArchiCAD 5.0 * 1997 - ArchiCAD 5.1 * 1998 - ArchiCAD 6.0 * 1999 - ArchiCAD 6.5 * 2001 - ArchiCAD 7.0 * 2002 - ArchiCAD 8 * 2003 - ArchiCAD 8.1 * 2004 - ArchiCAD 9 * 2006 - ArchiCAD 10 * 2007 - ArchiCAD 11 * 2008 - ArchiCAD 12 * 2009 - ArchiCAD 13 * 2010 - ArchiCAD 14 == See also == *[[Geometric Description Language]] *[[CAD]] *[[Comparison of CAD editors for AEC]] ==References== {{reflist}} == External links == *[http://www.graphisoft.com/ Graphisoft - The manufacturer's website] *[http://www.archicadwiki.com/ ArchiCAD Wiki] {{Building Information Modeling}} [[Category:Computer-aided design software]] [[Category:Mac OS software]] [[Category:Windows software]] [[Category:3D graphics software]] [[Category:Building information modeling]] [[Category:Mac OS X computer-aided design software]] [[ar:أركيكاد]] [[cs:ArchiCAD]] [[de:ArchiCAD]] [[es:ArchiCAD]] [[fr:ArchiCAD]] [[it:ArchiCAD]] [[ka:Graphisoft ArchiCAD]] [[lt:ArchiCAD]] [[hu:ArchiCAD]] [[ja:ArchiCAD]] [[no:ArchiCAD]] [[pl:ArchiCAD]] [[ru:ArchiCAD]] [[sk:ArchiCAD]] [[sl:ArchiCAD]] [[fi:ArchiCAD]] [[sv:Archicad]] [[ta:ஆர்க்கிகாட்]] [[th:อาร์คิแคด]] [[tr:ArchiCAD]] [[zh:ArchiCAD]]</text> </page> <page> <id>2311</id> <title>ArchiMate</title> <text>[[File:ArchiMate Architectural Framework.jpg|thumb|360px|Illustration of the ArchiMate Architectural Framework based on Henk Jonkers (2004) <ref>Henk Jonkers (ed.) et al.
