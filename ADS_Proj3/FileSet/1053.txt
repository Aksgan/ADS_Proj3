In February 2008, the HD quality (1280 × 720 pixels and 1.58 to 1.85 Mb/s) was made available to the MotionMaker users. In October 2008, the HQ quality (512 × 384 pixels, 30 images per second, [[H.264]] is used for images and AAC at 96 kb/s for the sound) was made available to regular users. On June 2, 2009, Dailymotion<ref>http://blog.dailymotion.com/2009/05/27/watch-videowithout-flash/</ref> announced on their blog that they were going to introduce [[HTML 5]] and that their existing 300,000 videos were going be converted to [[Ogg]] Theora + Vorbis. This ensures that a user does not need a Flash plug-in to view videos on Dailymotion but needs to have an HTML 5-compatible browser such as [[Firefox]] 3.5 or [[Google Chrome]] 3, or Webkit Based Espial Browser 6. Only MotionMaker videos are re-encoded in Ogg. ==MotionMaker and Official User== MotionMaker is a group for the original content creators. Official User is a group for the official content producers (record labels, film studios, news media, television channels, sports associations, political parties...). A MotionMaker or an Official User can : * Customize his/her profile. * Upload videos of unlimited length. * Upload HD quality videos. * Benefit of an increased visibility. * Have a OfficialContent/CreativeContent overlay affixed on his video thumbnails. == Hidden Features == Using [http://www.stupeflix.com/ Stupeflix]' technology, Dailymotion provides a tool for its users to create video slideshows. The link to the slideshow creation tool can be found from the option menu > settings > extra. Creating a sideshow takes a maximum of 30 pictures, and a music file. Stupeflix' [[slideshow]]s are rendered in a [[MP4]] video format, not [[Flash]]. ==Blocking of Dailymotion== ===Tunisia=== According to the article '''Tunisia: Video-sharing website Dailymotion Blocked!''' written by [[Reporters sans Frontières]] (Paris) April 11, 2007, Omar Mestiri, an editor of the opposition online newspaper "Kalima", is a victim of judicial harassment. Reporters Without Borders has said that a libel suit could result in a three-year prison sentence. RWB organization also called on the authorities to stop blocking Dailymotion, which has been inaccessible in Tunisia since April 1, 2007. Reporters Without Borders said: {{cquote|The lawsuit against Mestiri is absurd because it is based on an online article that cannot even be accessed from within Tunisia ... But we take this case very seriously. The three and a half year sentence imposed on lawyer Mohammed Abbou in April 2005 for an article posted online showed how the Tunisian courts are controlled by the government and how a libel suit can lead to a heavy sentence.}} The press freedom organisation added: {{cquote|The censorship of Dailymotion's website shows that the government, which is as paranoid about the Internet as it is about the traditional press, is ready to ban tens of thousands of inoffensive videos in order to block a handful it does not like.}} The suit against Mestiri was brought by Tunisian lawyer Mohammed Baccar over an article posted on September 5, 2006 accusing him of fraud and forgery. Mestiri was summoned by the deputy state prosecutor to respond to a charge of libel on March 29. Mestiri's lawyers have challenged the suit's legal basis on the grounds that Kalima's site is blocked in Tunisia and the article couldn't have been accessed there. ===Libya=== Despite the relatively few videos about [[Libya]] in Dailymotion, it was blocked there by March 2010.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} ==Copyright protection== Dailymotion with the help of Audible Magic, implemented an [[acoustic fingerprinting]] system that can detect copyrighted videos and not publish them.<ref>http://www.dailymotion.com/press/AudibleMagic-Dailymotion.pdf</ref> Dailymotion is also the first video sharing website to implement a video fingerprinting solution supplied by INA.<ref>http://www.dailymotion.com/press/PR_20080225_ina_implementation_final.pdf</ref> ==See also== {{Portalbox|Paris|Companies|Internet}} <!-- This space is only for links to similar websites that have Wikipedia articles. --> *[[Comparison of video services]] {{-}} ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.dailymotion.com/gb Dailymotion] * [http://iphone.dailymotion.com/ Dailymotion mobile website] * [http://openvideo.dailymotion.com/ Dailymotion, with the HTML5 player for the reencoded videos] * [http://betaplayer.dailymotion.com/ Dailymotion, with the beta player] * [http://blog.dailymotion.com/ Dailymotion blog] {{Digital distribution platforms}} [[Category:Social network services]] [[Category:Video hosting]] [[Category:Video on demand services]] [[Category:Companies based in Paris]] [[Category:Web 2.0]] [[ca:Dailymotion]] [[de:Dailymotion]] [[es:Dailymotion]] [[fr:Dailymotion]] [[gl:Dailymotion]] [[it:Dailymotion]] [[nl:Dailymotion]] [[ja:Dailymotion]] [[pl:Dailymotion]] [[pt:Dailymotion]] [[simple:Dailymotion]] [[fi:Dailymotion]] [[tr:Dailymotion]] [[vi:Dailymotion]] [[zh:Dailymotion]]</text> </page> <page> <id>9141</id> <title>Daisy chain (information technology)</title> <text>{{Other uses|Daisy chain (disambiguation){{!}}Daisy chain}} {{Multiple issues|intro-tooshort=April 2009|unreferenced=February 2008}} '''Daisy chain''' is a term used variously in [[information technology]]. Its meaning differs according to technology domain, although each preserves the traditional meaning of connecting like items to each other in a series or chain. == Computer software == A daisy chain software [[installation (computer programs)|installation]] can continue in piecemeal fashion. This is of particular use with downloaded software. If the connection to the download server is lost during the installation process, daisy chaining allows installation to restart from where it stopped. [[Google Pack]] provides this capability. == Computer hardware == Some hardware can be attached to a computing system in a daisy chain configuration by connecting each component to another similar component, rather than directly to the computing system that uses the component. Only the last component in the chain directly connects to the computing system. For example chaining multiple components that each have a [[UART]] port to each other. The components must also behave cooperatively. e.g., only one seizes the communications bus at a time. [[SCSI]] and [[Firewire]] devices can also be daisy chained. == Network topology == See [[Network topology#Daisy chains|Network Topology]]. == System access == Users can daisy chain computing sessions together. Using services such as [[telnet]] or [[Secure Shell|SSH]], the user creates a session on a second computer via telnet, and from the second session, telnets to
