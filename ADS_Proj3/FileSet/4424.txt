love for Trinity is revealed as a new variable in the repetition of the Matrix – while the previous Ones had no reason to choose humanity's destruction over accepting their function, Neo chooses to save Trinity at the cost of mankind's survival, despite the near certainty that she will die anyway after Zion's destruction. Neo races to save Trinity, who is shot by an agent as they fall from a building but is caught by Neo before hitting the ground. He refuses to accept her death, removing the bullet and reviving her. On board the ''Nebuchadnezzar'', Neo reveals that the prophecy is false and Zion will be destroyed in twenty-four hours. Sentinels destroy the ship, whereupon Neo saves his friends by using a previously unknown power to disable the Sentinels, then falls unconscious. The crew is rescued by the hovercraft ''[[Mjolnir (“Hammer”)#Mjolnir (“Hammer”)|Mjolnir]]'' (also known as the ''Hammer''), whose crew explains that they were leading a pre-emptive attack on the Sentinels advancing on Zion. The strategy was to use the ships' [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]]s and stay out of each other's range, but an EMP was detonated by the ''Caduceus'' before the ships were in position. Multiple ships were left without power, with only a handful of survivors escaping, the Sentinels having destroyed any ship that could not escape. Once the machines returned to digging, the ''Mjolnir'' looked for survivors and found only one: the Smith-controlled Bane. ==Cast== {{Refbegin|colwidth=30em}} * [[Keanu Reeves]] as [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] * [[Laurence Fishburne]] as [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] * [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]] * [[Hugo Weaving]] as [[Agent Smith|Smith]] * [[Harold Perrineau]] as [[Link (Matrix character)|Link]] * [[Randall Duk Kim]] as [[Keymaker|The Keymaker]] * [[Jada Pinkett Smith]] as [[Niobe (The Matrix)|Niobe]] * [[Gloria Foster]] as [[The Oracle (The Matrix)|The Oracle]] * [[Helmut Bakaitis]] as [[Architect (The Matrix)|The Architect]] * [[Lambert Wilson]] as [[Merovingian (The Matrix)|The Merovingian]] * [[Monica Bellucci]] as [[Persephone (The Matrix)|Persephone]] * Neil and Adrian Rayment as [[Twins (The Matrix)|Twins]] * [[Daniel Bernhardt]] as [[List of programs and machines in the Matrix series#Agent Johnson|Agent Johnson]] * [[Collin Chou]] as [[Seraph (The Matrix)|Seraph]] * [[Nona Gaye]] as [[Zee (The Matrix)|Zee]] * [[Gina Torres]] as [[List of minor characters in the Matrix series#Cas|Cas]] * [[Anthony Zerbe]] as Councillor Hamann * [[Roy Jones, Jr.]] as Captain Ballard * David A.

The [[freeway]] chase scene was filmed at the decommissioned [[Naval Air Station Alameda]] in [[Alameda, California]]. The producers constructed a 1.5-mile freeway on the old runways specifically for the film. Some portions of the chase were also filmed in [[Oakland, California]], and the tunnel shown briefly is the [[Webster Tube]], which connects Oakland and Alameda. Some post-production editing was also done in old aircraft hangars on the base as well. The city of [[Akron, Ohio]] was willing to give full access to [[Ohio State Route 59|Route 59]], the stretch of freeway known as the "Innerbelt", for filming of the freeway chase when it was under consideration. However, producers decided against this as "the time to reset all the cars in their start position would take too long".<ref name=job>{{cite web |url=http://autos.msn.com/advice/article.aspx?contentid=4021949&src=News |title=Chasing the Stars: Carmakers in Movies |publisher=MSN.com |author=Ann Job |accessdate=2005-01-30 }}</ref> ''[[MythBusters]]'' would later reuse the Alameda location in order to explore the effects of a head-on collision between two semi trucks, and to perform various other experiments. Around 97% of the materials from the sets of the film were [[recycled]] after production was completed; for example, tons of wood were sent to [[Mexico]] to build [[low-income housing]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/science/11/14/hollywood.pollution.ap/index.html |title=Hollywood smog an inconvenient truth |publisher=Associated Press (CNN.com) |date=November 14, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061215051825/http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/science/11/14/hollywood.pollution.ap/index.html |archivedate = December 15, 2006}}</ref> Some scenes from the film ''[[Baraka (film)|Baraka]]'' by [[Ron Fricke]] were selected to represent the real world shown by the wallmonitors in the [[Architect (The Matrix)|Architect's]] room.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0234215/movieconnections |title=Movie connections for The Matrix Reloaded (2003) |publisher=Internet Movie Database (IMDB.com) |date=February 16, 2010 }}</ref> ===Sound design=== Sound editing on the Matrix Trilogy was completed by Danetracks in [[West Hollywood]], California. ===Music=== {{See also|The Matrix Reloaded: The Album}} [[Don Davis (composer)|Don Davis]], who composed the music for ''The Matrix'', returned to score ''Reloaded''. For many of the pivotal action sequences, such as the "Burly Brawl", he collaborated with [[Juno Reactor]]. Some of the collaborative cues by Davis and Juno Reactor are extensions of material by Juno Reactor; for example, a version of "Komit" featuring Davis' strings is used during a flying sequence, and "Burly Brawl" is essentially a combination of Davis' unused "Multiple Replication" and a piece similar to Juno Reactor's "Masters of the Universe". One of the collaborations, "Mona Lisa Overdrive", is titled in reference to the [[cyberpunk]] [[Mona Lisa Overdrive|novel of the same name]] by [[William Gibson]], a major influence on the directors. [[Leitmotif]]s established in ''The Matrix'' return - such as the Matrix main theme, Neo and Trinity's love theme, the Sentinel's theme, Neo's flying theme, and a more frequent use of the four-note Agent Smith theme - and others used in ''Revolutions'' are established. As with its predecessor, many tracks by external musicians are featured in the movie, its closing credits, and the soundtrack album, some of which were written
