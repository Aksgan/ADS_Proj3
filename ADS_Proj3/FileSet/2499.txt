and if necessary conduct a series of experiments to determine accurately the relative merit of the new suggestion and of the old standard. And whenever the new method is found to be markedly superior to the old, it should be adopted as the standard for the whole establishment." Taylor also warned explicitly against cutting piece rates (or, by implication, cutting wages or discharging workers) when efficiency improvements reduce the need for raw labor: "…after a workman has had the price per piece of the work he is doing lowered two or three times as a result of his having worked harder and increased his output, he is likely entirely to lose sight of his employer's side of the case and become imbued with a grim determination to have no more cuts if soldiering [marking time, just doing what he is told] can prevent it." [[Shigeo Shingo]], the best-known exponent of [[SMED|single minute exchange of die]] ([[SMED]]) and error-proofing or poka-yoke, cites ''Principles of Scientific Management'' as his inspiration.<ref>Andrew Dillon, translator, 1987. ''The Sayings of Shigeo Shingo: Key Strategies for Plant Improvement'').</ref> American industrialists recognized the threat of cheap offshore labor to American workers during the 1910s, and explicitly stated the goal of what is now called lean manufacturing as a countermeasure. Henry Towne, past President of the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]], wrote in the Foreword to Frederick Winslow Taylor's ''Shop Management'' (1911), "We are justly proud of the high wage rates which prevail throughout our country, and jealous of any interference with them by the products of the cheaper labor of other countries. To maintain this condition, to strengthen our control of home markets, and, above all, to broaden our opportunities in foreign markets where we must compete with the products of other industrial nations, we should welcome and encourage every influence tending to increase the efficiency of our productive processes." === Ford starts the ball rolling === Henry Ford continued this focus on waste while developing his mass assembly manufacturing system. Charles Buxton Going wrote in 1915: :Ford's success has startled the country, almost the world, financially, industrially, mechanically. It exhibits in higher degree than most persons would have thought possible the seemingly contradictory requirements of true efficiency, which are: constant increase of quality, great increase of pay to the workers, repeated reduction in cost to the consumer. And with these appears, as at once cause and effect, an absolutely incredible enlargement of output reaching something like one hundredfold in less than ten years, and an enormous profit to the manufacturer.<ref>(Charles Buxton Going, preface to Arnold and Faurote, ''Ford Methods and the Ford Shops'' (1915))</ref> Ford, in ''My Life and Work'' (1922),<ref>{{Cite book | last = Ford | first = Henry; with Crowther, Samuel | authorlink = Henry Ford | year = 1922 | title = My Life and Work | publisher = Garden City Publishing Company, Inc | location = Garden City, New York, USA | url = http://www.gutenberg.net/etext/7213 }} Various republications, including ISBN 9781406500189.

Not only is everything done by hand, but seldom is a thought given to a logical arrangement. A farmer doing his chores will walk up and down a rickety ladder a dozen times. He will carry water for years instead of putting in a few lengths of pipe. His whole idea, when there is extra work to do, is to hire extra men. He thinks of putting money into improvements as an expense.... It is waste motion— waste effort— that makes farm prices high and profits low. Poor arrangement of the workplace—a major focus of the modern kaizen—and doing a job inefficiently out of habit—are major forms of waste even in modern workplaces. Ford also pointed out how easy it was to overlook material waste. A former employee, Harry Bennett, wrote: :One day when Mr. Ford and I were together he spotted some rust in the slag that ballasted the right of way of the D. T. & I [railroad]. This slag had been dumped there from our own furnaces. 'You know,' Mr. Ford said to me, 'there's iron in that slag. You make the crane crews who put it out there sort it over, and take it back to the plant.'<ref>{{Cite book | last = Bennett | first = Harry; with Marcus, Paul | authorlink = Harry Bennett | year = 1951 | title = We Never Called Him Henry | publisher = Fawcett Publications | location = New York | id = {{LCCN|51||036122}}}}</ref> In other words, Ford saw the rust and realized that the steel plant was not recovering all of the iron. Ford's early success, however, was not sustainable. As James Womack and Daniel Jones pointed out in "Lean Thinking", what Ford accomplished represented the "special case" rather than a robust lean solution.<ref>{{cite book |title=Lean Thinking |last=Womack |first=James P. |coauthors=Daniel T. Jones |publisher=Free Press |year=2003}}</ref> The major challenge that Ford faced was that his methods were built for a steady-state environment, rather than for the dynamic conditions firms increasingly face today.<ref name="ruffa">{{cite book |last=Ruffa |first=Stephen A. |title=Going Lean: How the Best Companies Apply Lean Manufacturing Principles to Shatter Uncertainty, Drive Innovation, and Maximize Profits |year=2008 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=_Q7OGDd61hkC |publisher=AMACOM |isbn=0-8144-1057-X}}</ref> Although his rigid, top-down controls made it possible to hold variation in work activities down to very low levels, his approach did not respond well to uncertain, dynamic business conditions; they responded particularly badly to the need for new product innovation. This was made clear by Ford's precipitous decline when the company was forced to finally introduce a follow-on to the Model T (see [[Lean Dynamics]]). [[Design for Manufacture]] (DFM) also is a Ford concept. Ford said in ''My Life and Work'' (the same reference describes just in time manufacturing very explicitly): :...entirely useless parts [may be]—a shoe, a dress, a house, a piece
