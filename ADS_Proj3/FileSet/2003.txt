presenting all visual or all auditory information. ====Memory Principles==== ''11. Replace memory with visual information: knowledge in the world''. A user should not need to retain important information solely in working memory or to retrieve it from long-term memory. A menu, checklist, or another display can aid the user by easing the use of their memory. However, the use of memory may sometimes benefit the user by eliminating the need to reference some type of knowledge in the world (e.g. an expert computer operator would rather use direct commands from memory than refer to a manual). The use of knowledge in a user’s head and knowledge in the world must be balanced for an effective design. ''12. Principle of predictive aiding''. Proactive actions are usually more effective than reactive actions. A display should attempt to eliminate resource-demanding cognitive tasks and replace them with simpler perceptual tasks to reduce the use of the user’s mental resources. This will allow the user to not only focus on current conditions, but also think about possible future conditions. An example of a predictive aid is a road sign displaying the distance from a certain destination. ''13. Principle of consistency''. Old habits from other displays will easily transfer to support processing of new displays if they are designed in a consistent manner. A user’s long-term memory will trigger actions that are expected to be appropriate. A design must accept this fact and utilize consistency among different displays. ==Human–computer interface== {{main|User interface}} The human–computer interface can be described as the point of communication between the human user and the computer. The flow of information between the human and computer is defined as the loop of interaction. The loop of interaction has several aspects to it including: *'''Task Environment''': The conditions and goals set upon the user. * '''Machine Environment''': The environment that the computer is connected to, i.e. a laptop in a college student's dorm room. *'''Areas of the Interface''': Non-overlapping areas involve processes of the human and computer not pertaining to their interaction. Meanwhile, the overlapping areas only concern themselves with the processes pertaining to their interaction. *'''Input Flow''': The flow of information that begins in the task environment, when the user has some task that requires using their computer. *'''Output''': The flow of information that originates in the machine environment. *'''Feedback''': Loops through the interface that evaluate, moderate, and confirm processes as they pass from the human through the interface to the computer and back. ==Current research== {{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}} Hot topìcs in HCI include: ===Group interfaces=== Interfaces to allow groups of people to coordinate are common (e.g., for meetings, engineering projects, or authoring joint documents). The [[Internet]] has produced a major impact on the nature of organizations and on the division of labor. Current research studies models of the group design process to create systems with increased rationalization of design to help group work. ===User Tailorability=== [[End-user development]] studies how ordinary users could routinely tailor applications to their own needs and use this power to invent new applications based on their understanding of their own domains. Users, with their deeper knowledge of their own knowledge domains, could increasingly be important sources of new applications at the expense of generic systems programmers (with systems expertise but low domain expertise). ===Embedded computation=== Computation is passing beyond desktop computers into every object for which uses can be found. Embedded systems make the environment alive with little computations and automated processes, from computerized cooking appliances to lighting and plumbing fixtures to window blinds to automobile braking systems to greeting cards. To some extent, this development is already taking place. The expected difference in the future is the addition of networked communications that will allow many of these embedded computations to coordinate with each other and with the user. Human interfaces to these embedded devices will in many cases be very different from those appropriate to workstations. ===Augmented reality=== A common staple of science fiction, augmented reality refers to the notion of layering relevant information into our vision of the world. Existing projects show real-time statistics to users performing difficult tasks, such as manufacturing. Future work might include augmenting our social interactions by providing additional information about those we converse with. ==Factors of change== {{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}} The means by which humans interact with computers continues to evolve rapidly. Human–computer interaction is affected by the forces shaping the nature of future computing. These forces include: * Decreasing hardware costs leading to larger memory and faster systems * Miniaturization of hardware leading to portability * Reduction in power requirements leading to portability * New display technologies leading to the packaging of computational devices in new forms * Specialized hardware leading to new functions * Increased development of network communication and distributed computing * Increasingly widespread use of computers, especially by people who are outside of the computing profession * Increasing innovation in input techniques (i.e., voice, [[gesture recognition|gesture]], pen), combined with lowering cost, leading to rapid computerization by people previously left out of the "computer revolution." * Wider social concerns leading to improved access to computers by currently disadvantaged groups The future for HCI, based on current promising research, is expected to include the following characteristics: *'''[[Ubiquitous computing|Ubiquitous communication]]'''. Computers are expected to communicate through high speed local networks, nationally over wide-area networks, and portably via infrared, ultrasonic, cellular, and other technologies. Data and computational services will be portably accessible from many if not most locations to which a user travels. *'''High functionality systems'''. Systems can have large numbers of functions associated with them. There are so many systems that most users, technical or non-technical, do not have time to learn them in the traditional way (e.g., through thick manuals). *'''Mass availability of computer graphics'''. Computer graphics capabilities such as image processing, graphics transformations, rendering, and interactive animation are becoming widespread as inexpensive chips become available for inclusion in general workstations and mobile devices. *'''Mixed media'''. Commercial systems can handle images, voice, sounds, video, text, formatted data. These are
