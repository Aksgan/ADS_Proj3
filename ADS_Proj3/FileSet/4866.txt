Unlike WowWee's other robots, the Chimpanzee only consists of the head of a [[chimpanzee]]. It houses eight [[Electric motor|motors]] to [[mimic]] the facial expressions of a real chimp. It also contains 9 sensors, including [[Infrared|IR]] [[sensors]] in the eyes, touch sensors on the chin, top and rear of the head and sound and [[vibration]] sensors in the ear. There is also an Alive [[Elvis]] manufactured. In attempting to make the Chimpanzee as [[Realism (arts)|realistic]] as possible, each strand of hair is rooted individually into the [[skin]] of the robot and the skin moves and is colored to match realistic skin tones, including [[vein]]ing. As with other WowWee robots, the Chimpanzee can be operated in different modes; in its case, the modes are Alive, Guard, Program, Demo and Sleep. Also, as revealed in a magazine of Popular Science in one of the articles, you can rip the face off the Alive Chimpanzee to reveal a Terminator-like robot face which follows your movement with two red eyes. The fact was revealed in a How2.0 article which demonstrates what you need to scare your friends. It was revealed as one of the tips to make the scare even scarier. == Features == Some of the Chimpanzee's notable features are: * [[Emotional mood|Mood]] dependent behavior: responds to [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] with mood specific [[animations]] and sounds * [[Infrared]] [[Visual perception|vision]] system: detects movement, tracks objects and reacts to [[Human robot interaction|human interaction]] * Touch sensors in his chin, head and ears * [[Stereo]] sound sensors detect loud sounds * Remote control or [[autonomous]] interactivity * [[Visual]] and [[sound|sonic]] guard mode * Program mode * [[Sleep]] mode '''Four Moods:''' * [[Curious]] * [[Fearful]] * [[Happy]] * [[Angry]] '''Modes of Operation:''' * Alive: default mode. Reacts to [[Sensory Reception|sensory input]], and performs autonomous actions. * Direct Control: responds to user commands. * Program: Up to 20 distinct steps (movements and sounds) can be entered in an ordered [[sequence]] that will be stored and can be played back at a later time. * Guard: Uses the vision and sound sensors to detect intruders around it, and reacts in response, either with a [[random]] animation or if a program has been entered. * [[Demo mode|Demo]]: runs through 2 or 3 random animations. * Sleep: the Chimpanzee will power down after a preset amount of time without activity. ==See also== *[[AIBO]] *[[Humanoid robot]] *[[Roboraptor]] *[[Roboreptile]] *[[Robosapien v2]] *[[Wow Wee|WowWee]] == External links == *[http://WowWee.com WowWee] *[http://www.WowWeeAlive.com/ WowWee Alive] - WowWee Alive Product site *[http://www.RoboCommunity.com RoboCommunity] - The official WowWee Robotics user community {{WowWee Robots}} [[Category:Biomorphic robots]] [[Category:Entertainment robots]]</text> </page> <page> <id>40544</id> <title>Wristwatch computer</title> <text>A '''wristwatch computer''' is a [[wearable computer]] that fits like a wristwatch. It may offer features similar to a [[PDA]], [[palmtop]] or [[tablet computer]]. Similar terms which refer to the same concept are '''wrist computer''', '''computer watch''', '''wrist-top''', '''wrist PDA''' and '''Wrist Worn PC''' ('''WWPC'''). Such devices may include features such an [[accelerometer]], [[thermometer]], [[altimeter]], [[barometer]], [[compass]], [[chronograph]], [[dive computer]], [[calculator]], [[cell phone]], [[GPS]], [[graphical display]], [[Computer speaker|speaker]], [[scheduler]], [[watch]], etc. It may communicate with a [[wireless headset]], [[heads-up display]], [[insulin pump]], [[microphone]], [[modem]], or other external device. Any [[computer]] has a data processor, memory, input and output. It may collect information from internal or external sensors. It may control, or retrieve data from, other instruments or computers. It may support wireless technologies like [[Bluetooth]], [[WiFi]], and [[GPS]]. However, it is possible a "wristwatch computer" may just serve as a front end for a remote system, as in the case of watches utilizing cellular technology or WiFi. ==1970s-1980s== [[Seiko]], a Japanese watch company, was one of the first to develop wrist computing technology. The first digital watch, which debuted in 1972, was the [[Pulsar (watch)|Pulsar]] manufactured by [[Hamilton Watch Company]]. "Pulsar" became a brand name which would later be acquired by Seiko in 1978. In 1982, a Pulsar watch (NL C01) was released which could store 24 digits, making it most likely the first watch with user-programmable memory, or "memorybank" watch.<ref name="history">{{Cite web|last=Doensen|first=Pieter |title=Q.5 Watches with Memory and Database|url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~doensen/q5.html|work=WATCH.

Pieter Doensen. |accessdate=17 September 2010}}</ref> With the introduction of personal computers in the 1980s, Seiko began to develop watches with computing ability. The '''Data 2000''' watch (1983) came with an external keyboard for data-entry. Data was synced from the keyboard to the watch via electro-magnetic coupling (wireless docking). The name stems from its ability to store 2000 characters.<ref name="seiko"/> The '''D409''' was the first Seiko model with on-board data entry (via a miniature keyboard) and featured a [[dot matrix]] display.<ref name="seiko">{{Cite web|title=Seiko Computer Watch Fun|url=http://pocketcalculatorshow.com/nerdwatch/fun2.html|accessdate=17 September 2010}}</ref> Its memory was tiny, at only 112 digits.<ref name="history"/> It was released in 1984 in gold, silver and black.<ref>{{Cite web|title=SEIKO D-409|url=http://www.digitalwatchlibrary.com/DWL/1work/seiko-d409-5009/|publisher=Digital Watch Library}}</ref> These models were followed by many others by Seiko during the 1980s, most notably the "RC Series": ===Seiko RC series=== The '''RC-1000 Wrist Terminal''' was the first Seiko model to interface with a computer, and was released in 1984.<ref name="seiko"/> It was compatible with most of the popular PCs of that time, including Apple II,II+ and IIe, the Commodore 64,
