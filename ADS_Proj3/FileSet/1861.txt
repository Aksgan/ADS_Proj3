can participate, for example, in queries with JOINs and simplify spreadsheet processing) and read-write non-durable in-memory data storage. == SQL Features == HSQLDB 2.0 supports all the core features and 148 optional features of [[SQL:2008]]. Advanced features include user-defined SQL procedures and functions, schemas, datetime intervals, updatable views, arrays, lobs, full and lateral joins and set operations. Many non-standard functions such as TO_CHAR and DECODE are also supported. Extensions to Standard SQL include user-defined aggregate functions. == History == Several versions of HSQLDB have been released since 2001. Early versions were based on the discontinued HypersonicSQL database engine. Version 2.0, released in 2010, is mostly new code, written to conform to Standard [[SQL]] and [[JDBC]] 4 Specification. <ref>{{cite web | title=The new HSQLDB | publisher=hsqldb.org | url=http://hsqldb.org/web/features200.html}}</ref> ==See also== {{Portal|Free software}} *[[List of relational database management systems]] *[[Comparison of relational database management systems]] *[[OpenOffice.org Base]] *[[H2 (DBMS)|H2]] *[[Apache Derby]] *[[Change control]] ==References== {{Refimprove|date=February 2008}} {{Primary sources|date=February 2008}} <!-- How to add a footnote: <nowiki> NOTE: Footnotes in this article use names, not numbers.

Hubo is short form for "'''''hu'''''manoid ro'''''bo'''''t." Hubo has voice recognition and synthesis faculties, as well as sophisticated vision in which its two eyes move independently of one another. ==Development history== Korea's history in robotics engineering is relatively short. KAIST only began research in [[2000]], led by professor [[Oh Jun-ho]]. The first prototype [[KHR-1]] was developed without a head or arms released in 2003, followed by KHR-2 in 2004. ==Latest breakthroughs== In November 5', KAIST, Korea and Dallas, Texas based Hanson Robotics, Inc (HRI) released the world's first android head mounted on a life-size walking bi-pedal frame at the APEC Summit in Seoul, Korea. The walking frame was the latest in Hubo technology, while the head was an exact recreation of the late physicist, Albert Einstein. The android was able to speak and cover a wide range of natural facial expressions, built upon prior HRI development on the Philip K. Dick android, which made its official debut at the [[Wired Magazine]] [[NextFest]] 05' in Chicago, Illinois. The humanoid prototype was officially dubbed "[[Albert Einstein Hubo]]". ===Prototypes=== *[[KHR-1]] in [[2003]] *[[KHR-2]] in [[2004]] ==Features and technology== ===Specifications=== {|style="text-align:center;" class="wikitable" ! !

Habituation is an extremely simple form of [[learning]], in which an organism, after a period of exposure to a stimulus, stops responding to that stimulus in varied manners.

As behaviors are repeated in a consistent context, there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action. This increases the [[automaticity]] of the behavior in that context.<ref>Wood W, Neal DT (2007). "A new look at habits and the habit-goal interface."
