his game appearances, as well as in other media. The first voice actor for Eggman was [[Masaharu Satō]], who portrayed him in the arcade game, ''[[SegaSonic the Hedgehog]]''. In the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] game releases from 1998 onwards, Eggman is voiced by [[Chikao Ōtsuka]], who also voices him in the Japanese version of ''[[Sonic X]]''. From 1998-2004, Deem Bristow provided the English [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]] for Eggman;<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0109941/ Deem Bristow] at the [[Internet Movie Database]].</ref> 4Kids employee Mike Pollock assumed the role shortly before Bristow's death from a [[Cardiac arrest|heart attack]] in 2005. The first video game to star [[Mike Pollock]] was ''[[Shadow the Hedgehog (video game)|Shadow the Hedgehog]]'', in which all of the regular voice actors were replaced with the 4Kids cast. While it was announced that the rest of the cast would be replaced from ''[[Sonic Colors]]'' onwards in 2010, Pollock retains his role as Doctor Eggman.<ref>http://blogs.sega.com/sonic/2010/07/15/out-of-the-mouths-of-hedgehogs/</ref> The only person besides Ōtsuka to portray Eggman in a Japanese production is [[Junpei Takiguchi]], who provided Eggman's voice for the [[original video animation]], ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie]]''.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0847664/ Junpei Takiguchi] at the Internet Movie Database.</ref> [[Edwin Neal]] later provided the English dub.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0623605/ Edwin Neal] at the Internet Movie Database.</ref> The early television incarnations of Doctor Robotnik (as he was known as exclusively in) have been voiced by three different actors. In ''[[Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', Robotnik is voiced by British blues singer [[Long John Baldry]],<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0049827/ Long John Baldry] at the Internet Movie Database.</ref> who coincidentally died the same year as Deem Bristow from a severe chest infection. Robotnik was voiced by [[Jim Cummings]] in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] Saturday morning ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (TV series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' cartoon,<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0191906/ Jim Cummings] at the Internet Movie Database.</ref> and by [[Gary Chalk (actor)|Gary Chalk]] (who also voiced [[Scratch and Grounder|Grounder]] in ''Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog'') in ''[[Sonic Underground]]''.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0149942/ Gary Chalk] at the Internet Movie Database.</ref> Eggman is also voiced by [[Mike Pollock]] in the English dub of ''[[Sonic X]]''. ==In video games== {{cleanup|section|date=September 2008}} [[Image:Robotnik-boss.png|200px|thumb|In many Sonic video games, Dr. Eggman will oppose the player directly as an end-level [[boss (video game)|boss]] (Seen here piloting his ''Big Arm'' [[Mecha]] in Launch Base Zone Act 2, the final boss of ''Sonic 3'')]] In the majority of video games set in the Sonic the Hedgehog universe, Eggman has served as the main antagonist. Most of the Sonic video games that were released before 1998, the year in which [[Sonic Adventure]] was released in Japan, featured Eggman as the final [[Boss (video games)|boss]] the player fights at the end of the game. Eggman also appears as the [[Boss (video games)|boss]] who the player must confront at the end of almost every [[Level (video gaming)|level]] in most of the 2D Sonic games, and in [[Sonic 3D]]. In each game in which he makes multiple appearances as a boss, Eggman fights the player using a different machine each time he appears. In most of the 2D Sonic games, the player had to hit Eggman eight times when he appeared as a boss in order to defeat him and move on to the next level or next boss. In most three-dimensional ''Sonic'' games since the release of ''Sonic Adventure'' in 1998, Eggman may serve as a boss at one or more points in the game, although he usually does not serve as the final boss. Many of the final bosses in these more recent ''Sonic'' games were former allies of Eggman who then betrayed him, while others were a third party that had no connection with Eggman whatsoever. Eggman has often formed temporary alliances with Sonic and others to help them defeat these foes. Dr. Eggman debuted in the 1991 [[Mega Drive|Genesis/Mega Drive]] platform game ''Sonic the Hedgehog'', where he attempted to collect the six [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Chaos Emeralds|Chaos Emeralds]] and hoped to turn all of the helpless animals inhabiting South Island into robots. He returned in the immediate sequel, ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (16-bit)|Sonic the Hedgehog 2]]'', where he once again sought the Chaos Emeralds, of which there were now seven. In this game, Eggman sought to collect the emeralds to fuel his ultimate weapon, a space station known as the Death Egg (an obvious homage to the [[Death Star]]), which has reappeared in several other titles in the series. In [[1993 in video gaming|1993]]'s ''[[Sonic CD]]'', Eggman, along with his latest creation, [[Metal Sonic]], travels to Little Planet in search of magical stones that have the power to control the passage of time. In ''[[Sonic 3]]'' and ''[[Sonic & Knuckles]]'', following the events in ''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'', Eggman's Death Egg crash-lands onto Angel Island. While repairing the space station, Eggman meets [[Knuckles the Echidna]], whom he tricks into believing that Sonic is trying to steal the Chaos Emeralds; in truth, Eggman intends to use the emeralds to repair the Death Egg. Other two-dimensional games released before 1998 that Eggman appears in include ''Sonic Chaos'', ''Sonic Triple Trouble'', ''Sonic Blast'', and ''Sonic the Hedgehog Pocket Adventure'', as well as the 8-bit renditions of ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' and ''Sonic the Hedgehog 2''. In ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'', Eggman learns of the legendary beast, [[Chaos (Sonic the Hedgehog)|Chaos]], and seeks out the Master Emerald. Upon finding it, he shatters it, freeing Chaos in the process. Eggman's goal is to control Chaos and obtain the Chaos Emeralds, which he can feed to Chaos so that it transforms into its most powerful form, using its destructive powers to conquer the world.<ref>'''Doctor Robotnik''': Oh, yes. It's just as the stone tablets predicted. Ha ha ha ha ha! His strength increases every time I give him a Chaos Emerald. With all seven Emeralds, he will be invincible and work for me! Together we'll destroy Station Square. And on its ruins I'll build Robotnikland. The ultimate city where I will rule it all. Come on, Chaos! Let's find another Emerald, shall we? [[Sega]] ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'' ''(in English)'' 1999-[[September 9|9-9]] ''(US)''</ref> ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]'' marks Eggman's first appearance as a [[player character|playable character]] in a main series
