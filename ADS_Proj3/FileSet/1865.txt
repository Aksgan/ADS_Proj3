original in 1999, OpenBSD has had at least a hackathon a year. During the hackathon, many of the developers come together for a period which usually sees rapid OpenBSD development. The original hackathon took place in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]] and was attended by ten developers. It was focused on cryptographic development; part of the reason for holding it in Canada was to avoid legal problems caused by United States regulations on the export of cryptographic software. The designation for each subsequent hackathon has been marked by this, as OpenBSD has used ''c'', standing first for crypto and later for Calgary, as the first letter of these events. Since then, hackathons have become a big event, a week-long gathering during which more than 60 developers from around the world come together to drink beer, listen to [[humppa]] music—like that of [[Eläkeläiset]]—hike, and hack on OpenBSD. As of 2009, official [[OpenBSD]] hackathons<ref>[http://www.openbsd.org/hackathons.html Openbsd.org]</ref> have been: (1999) *c99 - June 4, 1999, 10 [[programmer|developers]] in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]].

See RHoK.org == Sprints ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Code and fix]] --> A '''[[running|sprint]]''' is a short period of [[software development]]. Sprints have become popular events among some [[open source]] projects, for example, the [[PyPy]] project is developed the most through regularly held sprints, where most of the international team gathers. They are often held near conferences which most of the project's team attends, but they can also be hosted by some involved party at their premises or some interesting location. The practice of using sprints for pivotal development was pioneered by the [[Zope]] Corporation in the early days of the [[BlueBream|Zope 3]] project, where the greatest improvements in the software were made during the gatherings. From January [[2002]] till the start of [[2006]] more than 30 Zope 3 sprints have taken place. The sprints organized by companies often focus on the concepts of the [[Extreme Programming]] software development method. There the sprint is directed by the coach, who suggests tasks, tracks their progress and makes sure that none of the developers encounter insurmountable difficulties. Often the development happens [[Pair programming|in pairs]] or small teams. A large open space is often chosen as a venue for efficient communication. Sprints can vary in focus. During some sprints people new to the project are welcomed and get an intensive hands-on introduction pairing with an experienced project member. The first part of such sprints is usually spent getting ready, presenting the tutorials, getting the network setup and [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] or [[Subversion (software)|Subversion]] checkouts working on everyone's laptops. A different kind of sprint is where only the core team gathers and gets some important work done in a concentrated manner. As with the larger hackathons, a significant benefit of sprinting is that the project members meet in person, socialize, and start to communicate more effectively than when working together remotely. ==See also== * [[Hacker culture]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.openbsd.org/hackathons.html OpenBSD hackathons] * [http://kerneltrap.org/node/5114 OpenBSD hackathon 2005] * [http://www.connectathon.org/ Sun Connectathon] * [http://www.machack.com/faq.php MacHack 2003] * [http://blog.jot.com/archives/2005/05/09/jotspot-inagural-hackathon/ JotSpot Wiki Hackathon] * [http://www.zopemag.com/Guides/miniGuide_ZopeSprinting.html miniGuide to Zope sprinting (Zope Mag)] * [http://www.nlnet.nl/project/hackathon/description.html Stichting NLnet's 2003 Hackathon page] * [http://wiki.debian.org/BSP Debian bug squashing parties] * [http://hackathon.info Chicago Perl Hackathon] * [http://hackathon.info/projects/ Perl-related projects] * [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Hackathon Haskell hackathons] [[Category:Hacking (programmer subculture)]] [[Category:Internet slang]] [[Category:OpenBSD]] [[Category:Software developer communities]] [[es:Hackathon]]</text> </page> <page> <id>16142</id> <title>Hacker koan</title> <text>{{Refimprove|date=March 2009}} Out of [[hacker culture]], and especially the [[artificial intelligence]] community at [[MIT]], there have sprung a number of [[Geek humor|humor]]ous short stories about [[computer science]] dubbed '''hacker koans'''; most of these are recorded in an appendix to the [[Jargon File]], where they are called ''[[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] Koans''.
