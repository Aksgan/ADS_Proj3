It is usually the result of [[learning]], [[repetition (learning)|repetition]], and practice. Examples of automaticity are common activities such as speaking, bicycle-riding, assembly-line work, and driving a car (see [[Highway hypnosis]]). After an activity is sufficiently practiced, it is possible to focus the mind on other activities or thoughts while undertaking an automaticized activity (for example, holding a conversation or planning a speech while driving a car). Walking is not an example of automaticity as it is not a cortical function. It is a medullary function, with specific medullary circuits, which can be learnt to be inhibited or altered by higher-order ones. In ''Influence'', [[Robert Cialdini]]'s book about [[social psychology]] and influence tactics, Cialdini explains how common [[automatic response patterns]] are in [[human behavior]], and how easily they can be triggered, even with erroneous cues.<ref>Cialdini, R.B. (2001). ''Influence: Science and practice'' (4th ed.). Boston: Allyn & Bacon. Chapter 1.</ref> He describes an experiment conducted by social psychologists [[Langer]], Chanowitz, and Blank which illustrates how compliant people will be with a request if they hear words that sound like they are being given a reason, even if no actual reason is provided. The experimenters approached people standing in line to use a photocopier with one of three requests: * "Excuse me. I have 5 pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I'm in a rush?" * "Excuse me. I have 5 pages. May I use the Xerox machine?" or * "Excuse me. I have 5 pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I have to make some copies?" When given the request + reason, 94% of people asked complied with the request. When given the request without a reason, only 60% complied. But when given the request with what sounds like a reason but isn't, compliance jumped back to 93%. Langer, Chanowitz, and Blank are convinced that most human behavior falls into automatic response patterns.<ref>Cialdini, R.B. (2001). Influence: Science and practice (4th ed.).

Some educational software, like [[QuickSmart]], incorporates the concept of automaticity. By measuring the consistency of processing speed and accuracy of students' responses, foundation skills can become automatic. As a result, students can devote cognitive effort to higher-order comprehension skills. ==See also== * [[Habit (psychology)]] * [[Habituation]] * [[Neural adaptation]] ==References== <references/> ==Sources== * PhysioEx 6.0 – Peter Zao – Timothy Stabler – Greta Peterson – Lori Smith * Shiffrin, R.M., & Schneider, W.

Automator enables the repetition of tasks across a wide variety of programs, including the [[Macintosh Finder|Finder]], the [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] web browser, [[iCal]], [[Address Book]] and others. It can also work with third-party applications such as [[Microsoft Office]], [[Adobe Photoshop]] or [[Pixelmator]]. Automator was first released with [[Mac OS X Tiger]] (10.4). == Interface == Automator provides a [[GUI|graphical user interface]] for automating tasks without knowledge of programming or scripting languages. Tasks can be recorded as they are performed by the user or can be selected from a list. The output of the last action can become the input to the next. == Features == Automator comes with a library of Actions (file renaming, finding linked images, creating a new mail message, etc.) that act as individual steps in a Workflow document. A Workflow document is used to carry out repetitive tasks. Workflows can be saved and reused. [[Unix]] command line scripts and AppleScripts can also be invoked as Actions. The actions are linked together in a Workflow. The Workflow can be saved as an application, Workflow file or a [[contextual menu]] item. Options can be set when the Workflow is created or when the Workflow is run. == Examples == Example workflows are available [http://automator.us/examples.html here]. == See also == * [[AppleScript]] * [[AutoHotkey]] * [[iMacros|iMacros for Firefox]] == External links == *[http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/automator/ Apple's Official Automator Page] *[http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/automator/ Apple's Download Page for Automator Actions] *[http://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/AutomatorConcepts/index.html Apple's Automator Programming Guide] *[http://www.automator.us/ A site focused on Automator actions by Sal Soghoian, the AppleScript Product Manager at Apple
