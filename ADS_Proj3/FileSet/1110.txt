The curved line is the expected [[Hardy-Weinberg principle|Hardy-Weinberg frequency]] as a function of ''p''.]] A '''de Finetti diagram''' is a [[ternary plot]] used in [[population genetics]]. It is named after the [[Italy|Italian]] [[statistics|statistician]] [[Bruno de Finetti]] (1906–1985) and is used to graph the [[genotype frequency|genotype frequencies]] of [[population]]s, where there are two [[allele]]s and the population is [[diploidy|diploid]]. It is based on an [[equilateral triangle]], and [[Viviani's theorem]] concerning any point within the triangle, and the three lines from that point that are perpendicular to the sides of the triangle. The sum of the lengths of the lines is a fixed value, regardless of the position of the point. This value (the sum of the lengths) is set to be 1. ==Applications in genetics== The de Finetti diagram has been put to extensive use in population genetics by [[A.W.F. Edwards]] in his book ''Foundations of Mathematical Genetics''. In its simplest form the diagram can be used to show the range of genotype frequencies for which [[Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium]] is satisfied. [[A.W.F. Edwards]] and [[Chris Cannings]] extended its use to demonstrate the changes that occur in allele frequencies under [[natural selection]]. ==References== * Cannings C., Edwards A.W.F.

The work is one of the most important sources of modern knowledge of Roman building methods as well as the planning and design of structures, both large (aqueducts, buildings, baths, harbours) and small (machines, measuring devices, instruments). He is also the prime source of the famous story of [[Archimedes]] and his bath-time discovery. [[image:De architectura.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A 1521 [[Italian language]] edition of De architectura, translated and illustrated by [[Cesare Cesariano]].]] [[File:De Architectura027.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Manuscript of Vitruvius; parchment dating from about 1390]] ==In summary== Probably written around 15 BC <ref>Art Directory GmbH [http://www.vitruvius-pollio.com/] last accessed 3/9/2008</ref>, it is the only contemporary source on classical architecture to have survived in its entirety. Divided into ten sections or "books", it covers almost every aspect of Roman architecture. The books break down as follows: # [[Urban planning|Town planning]], [[architecture]] or [[Civil engineering]] in general, and the qualifications required of an [[architect]] or more modernly the [[civil engineer]] # [[Building material]]s # [[Roman temple|Temples]] and the [[orders of architecture]]; # ''continuation of book 3'' # [[Roman architecture|Civil buildings]] # [[Roman villa|Domestic buildings]] # [[Pavement (architecture)|Pavements]] and decorative [[plaster]]work # [[Roman aqueduct|Water supplies]] and [[aqueducts]] # Sciences influencing architecture - [[geometry]], [[mensuration]], [[astronomy]], [[sundial]] # Use and construction of [[machines]] - [[Roman siege engines]], [[water mill]]s, drainage machines, [[Roman technology]], [[Hoist (device)|hoisting]], [[pneumatics]] Roman architects were skilled in engineering, art, and craftsmanship combined. Vitruvius was very much of this type, a fact reflected in ''De architectura''. He covers a wide variety of subjects which he saw as touching on architecture. This included many aspects which may seem irrelevant to modern eyes, ranging from mathematics to astronomy, meteorology and medicine. In the Roman conception, architecture needed to take into account everything touching on the physical and intellectual life of man and his surroundings. Vitruvius thus deals with many theoretical issues concerning architecture. For instance, in Book 2 of ''De architectura'', he advises architects working with [[brick]]s to familiarise themselves with pre-Socratic theories of matter so as to understand how their materials will behave. Book 9 relates the abstract [[geometry]] of [[Plato]] to the everyday work of the [[Surveyor (surveying)|surveyor]]. [[Astrology]] is cited for its insights into the organisation of human life, while [[astronomy]] is required for the understanding of [[sundial]]s. Similarly, Vitruvius cites [[Ctesibius|Ctesibius of Alexandria]] and [[Archimedes]] for their inventions, [[Aristoxenus]] ([[Aristotle]]'s apprentice) for [[music]], [[Agatharchus]] for [[theatre]], and [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] for architecture. ===Buildings=== [[Image:Greekhse1.jpg|right|thumb|Greek house plan by Vitruvius]] He sought to address the ethos of architecture, declaring that quality depends on the social relevance of the [[artist]]'s work, not on the form or workmanship of the work itself. Perhaps the most famous declaration from ''De architectura'' is one still quoted by architects: "Well building hath three conditions: firmness, commodity, and delight." This quote is taken from Sir [[Henry Wotton]]'s version of 1624, and is a plain and accurate translation of the passage in Vitruvius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/1*.html#3.2 (I.iii.2)]: but English has changed since then, especially in regard to the word "commodity", and the tag is usually misunderstood. [[Image:Da Vinci Vitruve Luc Viatour.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Vitruvian Man]], by Leonardo da Vinci]] Vitruvius also studied human proportions (Book 3) and his ''canones'' were later encoded in a very famous drawing by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (''Homo Vitruvianus'', "[[Vitruvian Man]]"). ==Roman technology== [[Image:ballista.gif|thumb|left|200px|A Roman Ballista]] The work is important for its descriptions of many different machines used for engineering structures such as [[Hoist (device)|hoist]]s, [[Crane (machine)|crane]]s and [[pulleys]], as well as war machines such as [[catapault]]s, [[ballistae]], and [[siege engine]]s. He also describes the construction of [[sundial]]s and [[water clock]]s, and the use of an [[aeolipile]] (the first [[steam engine]]) as an experiment to demonstrate the nature of atmospheric air movements (wind). ===Aqueducts and mills=== [[Image:Pont du gard.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Pont du Gard]]]] Books 8, 9 and 10 form the basis of much of what we know about Roman technology, now augmented by archaeological studies of extant remains, such as the [[Pont du Gard]] in southern France. Numerous such massive structures occur across the former Empire, a testament to the power of [[Roman engineering]]. His description of [[aqueduct]] construction is short, but does mention key details especially for the
