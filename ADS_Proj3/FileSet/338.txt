In [[Scotland]] the term [[Cashline]] has become a generic term for an ATM, based on the branding from the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]]. In the [[Republic of Ireland]], ATMs are also commonly referred to as a "[[Banklink]]", named after the [[Allied Irish Bank]] brand of [[machine]]s. In [[Israel]], ATMs are commonly referred to as "[[Kaspomat]]" ([[Hebrew]]: כספומט), which is a compound word meaning "automatic money" in [[Hebrew]], named after the [[Bank Leumi]] & [[Israel Discount Bank]] brand of [[machine]]s. ==Hardware== [[Image:Atm blockdiagram.png|thumb|right|A block diagram of an ATM]] An ATM is typically made up of the following devices: * [[CPU]] (to control the user interface and transaction devices) * [[Magnetic stripe card|Magnetic]] and/or [[Chip card]] reader (to identify the customer) * [[Personal identification number|PIN]] Pad (similar in layout to a [[Touch tone]] or [[Calculator]] keypad), often manufactured as part of a secure enclosure. * [[Secure cryptoprocessor]], generally within a secure enclosure. * Display (used by the customer for performing the transaction) * [[Function key]] buttons (usually close to the display) or a [[Touchscreen]] (used to select the various aspects of the transaction) * Record Printer (to provide the customer with a record of their transaction) * [[Bank vault|Vault]] (to store the parts of the machinery requiring restricted access) * Housing (for aesthetics and to attach signage to) Recently, due to heavier computing demands and the falling price of computer-like architectures, ATMs have moved away from custom hardware architectures using [[microcontroller]]s and/or [[application-specific integrated circuit]]s to adopting the hardware architecture of a [[personal computer]], such as, USB connections for peripherals, ethernet and IP communications, and use personal computer operating systems. Although it is undoubtedly cheaper to use [[commercial off-the-shelf]] hardware, it does make ATMs potentially vulnerable to the same sort of problems exhibited by conventional computers. Business owners often lease ATM terminals from ATM service providers.

[[Scrip cash dispenser]]s do not incorporate a vault. Mechanisms found inside the vault may include: * Dispensing mechanism (to provide [[cash]] or other items of value) * Deposit mechanism including a Check Processing Module and Bulk Note Acceptor (to allow the customer to make deposits) * Security sensors (Magnetic, Thermal, Seismic, gas) * Locks: (to ensure controlled access to the contents of the vault) * Journaling systems; many are electronic (a sealed flash memory device based on proprietary standards) or a solid-state device (an actual printer) which accrues all records of activity including access timestamps, number of bills dispensed, etc. - This is considered sensitive data and is secured in similar fashion to the cash as it is a similar liability. ATM vaults are supplied by manufacturers in several grades. Factors influencing vault grade selection include cost, weight, regulatory requirements, ATM type, operator risk avoidance practices, and internal volume requirements.<ref>[http://www.atmdepot.com/help.aspx#f4 ATMDepot.com questions and answers] www.atmdepot.com</ref> Industry standard vault configurations include [[Underwriters Laboratories]] [[UL-291]] "Business Hours" and Level 1 Safes,<ref>[http://ulstandardsinfonet.ul.com/scopes/scopes.asp?fn=0291.html "Automated Teller Systems - UL 291"] [[Underwriters Laboratories]] website</ref> [[RAL (standards institute)|RAL]] TL-30 derivatives,<ref>[http://www.ncr.com/en/products/hardware/hw_atm_p75_ts_product.htm "NCR Personas 75 Technical Specification"] [[NCR Corporation|NCR]] website</ref> and CEN EN 1143-1:2005 - CEN III/VdS and CEN IV/LGAI/VdS.<ref>[http://www.cenorm.be/catweb/13.310.htm "CEN On-line catalogue - ICS: 13.310 Protection against crime"] [[Comité Européen de Normalisation]]</ref><ref>[http://www.bsonline.bsi-global.com/search/item/1928003 Item Summary] [[British Standards Institution]]</ref> ATM manufacturers recommend that vaults be attached to the floor to prevent theft.<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.tritonatm.com/en/service/manuals/07100-00008F%20(9100UsrMan(5.0)).pdf ''Model 9100 ATM User / Installation Manual'']}}</ref> ==Software== [[Image:Atm os2warp.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Suncorp Metway]] ATM running [[OS/2]]]] With the migration to commodity PC hardware, standard commercial "off-the-shelf" operating systems and programming environments can be used inside of ATMs. Typical platforms previously used in ATM development include [[RMX (operating system)|RMX]] or [[OS/2]]. Today the vast majority of ATMs worldwide use a [[Microsoft]] OS, primarily [[Windows XP Professional]] or [[Windows XP Embedded]]. A small number of deployments may still be running older versions such as [[Windows NT]], [[Windows CE]] or [[Windows 2000]]. Notably, [[Windows Vista|Vista]] was not widely adopted in ATMs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} There is a computer industry security view or consensus that desktop operating systems have greater risks as operating systems for cash dispensing machines than other types of operating systems like (Secure) Real Time Operating Systems ([[RTOS]]s). [[RISKS Digest]] has many articles about cash machine operating system vulnerabilities [http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/php/risks/search.php?query=cash+machine]. [[Image:Postomat-Windows-p1020441.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Wincor Nixdorf]] ATM running [[Windows 2000]]]] [[Linux]] is also finding some reception in the ATM marketplace. An example of this is [[Banrisul]], the largest bank in the south of [[Brazil]], which has replaced the [[MS-DOS]] operating systems in its ATMs with Linux. [[Banco do Brasil]] is also migrating ATMs to Linux. Common application layer transaction protocols, such as [[Diebold]] 91x (911 or 912) and [[NCR Corporation|NCR]] [[NCR Corporation|NDC or NDC+]] provide [[Hardware emulation|emulation]] of older generations of hardware on newer platforms with incremental extensions made over time to address new capabilities, although companies like NCR continuously improve these protocols issuing newer versions (e.g. NCR's AANDC v3.x.y, where x.y are subversions). Most major ATM manufacturers provide software packages that implement these protocols. Newer protocols such as [[Interactive Financial Exchange|IFX]] have yet to find wide acceptance by transaction processors.<ref>[http://www.selfserviceworld.com/article.php?id=1252 "Messaging standard to give multiple channels a common language"]</ref> With the move to a more standardized software base, financial institutions have been increasingly interested in the ability to pick and choose the application programs that drive
