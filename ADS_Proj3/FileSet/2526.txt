is a [[news]], [[time zone]] and [[weather]] feed, designed to provide users with the same services as [[Google News]] and [[The Weather Channel]]. The channel is, incidentally, powered by both websites and is organised by city. The content includes live camera feeds and cloud data, similar to [[Google Earth]]. Live Cameras is provided by [[earthTV]] and the Webcams.travel website. The application only supports certain cities of the world, with limited coverage, such as with the continent [[Africa]], with only four cities covered by the Live Channel. === Folding@Home === {{main|Folding@home}} Folding@home ("Folding at Home") (sometimes abbreviated as FAH or F@h) is a [[distributed computing]] (DC) project that simulates [[protein folding]] and other [[molecular dynamics]] (MD), and improves on the methods available to do so. It was launched on October 1, 2000, and is currently managed by the Pande Group, within [[Stanford University|Stanford University's]] [[chemistry]] department, under the supervision of Professor [[Vijay Pande]]. The application became available for the [[PlayStation 3|PS3]] in March 2007 and became a channel on Life with PlayStation the moment Life was released. ===PlayStation Network Game Trailers Channel === For users in the [[United States]], the PSN game trailers channel allows direct access to the streaming of the [[PlayStation Store]]'s game trailers. It also has the ability to purchase titles from the store, without having to leave Life. === United Village === United Village, provided by its respective website, and hosted by Frontier International Inc., is a [[cultural]] [[documentary]]-like project that gathers stories, interviews and articles worldwide. It targets [[rural]] and/or [[third world]] stories rather than [[urban area|urban]] life. Generally, the stories come from [[developing countries]], but there are occasionally some in rural parts of other countries. The contents of the channel include culture, development, education, social issues and tourism. === World Heritage === World Heritage, by α Clock, shows [[UNESCO]]-selected locations of special cultural or physical significance around the world. These [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage sites]] link to their respective articles on [[Wikipedia]]. Each location has the introduction directly from the Wikipedia articles. == Features == In addition to the channels, Life With PlayStation also features photo slideshow viewing, music & video playback. The virtual globe is periodically updated from servers to ensure that cloud, weather, live camera feed and news update data are all up to date. All channels except for the Live Channel have a static representation of [[Earth]], whereas the Live Channel itself shows time effects (such as day and night). Additionally, the Folding@home protein folding can be disabled. == References == {{reflist}} [[Category:PlayStation 3]] [[Category:PlayStation 3 software]] [[Category:Virtual globes]] [[Category:2008 introductions]]</text> </page> <page> <id>21643</id> <title>Light transport theory</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}} '''Light transport theory''' deals with the mathematics behind calculating the energy transfers between media that affect visibility. This article is currently specific to light transport in rendering processes such as [[global illumination]] and [[High dynamic range imaging|HDRI]]. ==Light== === Light Transport === The amount of light transported is measured by flux density, that is flux per unit area. ====Radiometry==== ==== Energy Transfer ==== ===Media=== == Models == ===Hemisphere=== Given a surface S, a hemisphere H can be projected on to S to calculate the amount of incoming and outgoing light . If a point P is selected at random on the surface S, the amount of light incoming and outgoing can be calculated by its projection onto the hemisphere. ===Hemicube=== The hemicube model works in a similar way that the hemisphere model works, with the exception that a hemicube is projected as opposed to a hemisphere. The similarity is only in concept, the actual calculation done by integration has a different form factor. ===Particle=== === Wave === ==Equations== === Maxwell's Equations === ==Rendering== {{Main|Rendering (computer graphics)}} Rendering converts a model into an image either by simulating light transport to get physically-based photorealistic images, or by applying some kind of style as in [[non-photorealistic rendering]]. The two basic operations in realistic rendering are transport (how much light gets from one place to another) and scattering (how surfaces interact with light). ==See also== * [[Global illumination]] * [[Monte Carlo Method]] * [[Photon mapping]] * [[Radiosity]] * [[Ray tracing (graphics)]] * [[Ray tracing (physics)]] * [[Reyes rendering]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Light Transport Theory}} [[Category:Computer graphics]]</text> </page> <page> <id>21646</id> <title>Lighthill report</title> <text>The '''Lighthill report''' is the name commonly used for the paper "Artificial Intelligence: A General Survey" by [[James Lighthill]], published in ''Artificial Intelligence: a paper symposium'' in 1973.{{ref|lighthill_report}} Published in 1973, it was compiled by Lighthill for the British [[Science Research Council]] as an evaluation of the academic research in the field of [[Artificial Intelligence]]. The report gave a very pessimistic prognosis for many core aspects of research in this field, stating that "in no part of the field have discoveries made so far produced the major impact that was then promised". It "formed the basis for the decision by the British government to end support for [[AI]] research in all but three universities"{{ref|aiama}}—Edinburgh, Sussex and Essex. While the report was supportive of research into the simulation of neurophysiological and psychological processes, it was "highly critical of [[basic research]] in foundational areas such as [[robotics]] and [[language processing]]".{{ref|ai_at_edinburgh}} The report stated that AI researchers had failed to address the issue of [[combinatorial explosion]] when solving problems within real world domains. That is, the report states that AI techniques may work within the scope of small problem domains, but the techniques would not scale up well to solve more realistic problems. The report represents a pessimistic view of AI that began after early excitement in the field. The Science Research Council's decision to invite the report was partly a reaction to high levels of discord within the [[University of Edinburgh|University of Edinburgh's]] Department of Artificial Intelligence, one of the earliest and biggest centres for AI research in the UK.{{ref|ai_at_edinburgh}} ==See also== * [[AI Winter]] * [[ALPAC report]] ==References== * {{note|lighthill_report}} James Lighthill (1973): "Artificial Intelligence: A General Survey" in ''Artificial Intelligence: a paper symposium'', Science Research Council * {{note|aiama}}{{Russell Norvig 2003}} * {{note|ai_at_edinburgh}} Howe, J.
