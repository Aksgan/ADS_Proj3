'''OPENSTEP''' (all capitalized) was a specific implementation of the OpenStep API developed by NeXT.<ref>[http://toastytech.com/guis/openstep.html Toastytech.com]</ref>. While originally built on a [[Mach kernel|Mach]]-based [[Unix]] (such as the core of [[NeXTSTEP]]), versions of OPENSTEP were available for [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] and [[Windows NT]] as well. The [[software libraries]] that shipped with OPENSTEP are a superset of the original OpenStep specification. ==History== The OpenStep API was created as the result of a 1993 collaboration between [[NeXT]] and [[Sun Microsystems]], allowing this cut-down version of NeXT's [[NeXTSTEP]] [[operating system]] object layers to be run on Sun's [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] operating system (more specifically, Solaris on [[SPARC]]-based hardware). Most of the OpenStep effort was to strip away those portions of NeXTSTEP that depended on [[Mach (kernel)|Mach]] or NeXT-specific hardware being present. This resulted in a smaller system that consisted primarily of [[Display PostScript]], the [[Objective-C]] runtime and compilers, and the majority of the NeXTSTEP Objective-C libraries. Not included was the basic operating system, or the display system. The first draft of the API was published by NeXT in summer 1994. Later that year they released an OpenStep compliant version of their flagship operating system [[NeXTSTEP]], rebranded as OPENSTEP and supported on several of their platforms as well as Sun SPARC systems. The official OpenStep API, published in September 1994, was the first to split the API between Foundation and Application Kit and the first to use the "NS" prefix.<ref>[http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaFundamentals/WhatIsCocoa/WhatIsCocoa.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH3-SW12 Cocoa Fundamentals Guide: A Bit of History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> OPENSTEP remained NeXT's primary operating system product until they were purchased by [[Apple Computer]] in 1996. OPENSTEP was then combined with technologies from the existing [[Mac OS]] to produce [[Mac OS X]]. Sun originally adopted the OpenStep environment with the intent of complementing Sun's [[CORBA]]-compliant object system, [[Distributed Objects Everywhere|Solaris NEO]] (formerly known as Project DOE), by providing an object-oriented user interface toolkit to complement the object-oriented CORBA plumbing. The port involved integrating the OpenStep AppKit with the Display PostScript layer of the Sun [[X11]] server, making the AppKit tolerant of multi-threaded code (as Project DOE was inherently heavily multi-threaded), implementing a Solaris daemon to simulate the behavior of Mach ports, extending the SunPro C++ compiler to support [[Objective-C]] using NeXT's ObjC runtime, writing an X11 [[window manager]] to implement the NeXTSTEP look and feel as much as possible, and integrating the NeXT
