Using various combinations of speech synthesis, braille, and magnification, Orca helps provide access to applications and toolkits that support the [[AT-SPI]] (e.g., the [[GNOME]] desktop). The development of Orca has been led by the Accessibility Program Office of Sun Microsystems, Inc. (now Oracle) with contributions from many community members. The original idea and the first working prototype for Orca were created by Mark Mulcahy, a blind programmer who worked for [[Sun Microsystems]]. The name '''Orca''', which is another term for a [[Orca|killer whale]], is a nod to the long-standing tradition of naming screen readers after aquatic creatures, including the Assistive Technology product on Windows called [[JAWS (screen reader)|JAWS]] (which stands for Jobs Access With Speech), the early DOS screen reader called Flipper, and the UK vision impairment company Dolphin Computer Access. As of GNOME 2.16, Orca is a part of the GNOME platform. As a result, Orca is already provided by default on a number of operating system distributions, including [[OpenSolaris|Open Solaris]], [[openSUSE]], and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]. ==External links== *[http://live.gnome.org/Orca Orca Website] *[http://blogs.sun.com/richb/entry/my_first_blind_email Orca's first programmer/inventor] [[Category:GNOME]] [[Category:Computer accessibility]] [[Category:Free screen readers]] [[Category:Linux software]] {{free-software-stub}} [[de:Orca (Screenreader)]] [[fr:Orca (accessibilité)]] [[it:Orca (software)]] [[nl:Orca (screenreader)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>27750</id> <title>Orchestration (computing)</title> <text>'''Orchestration''' describes the automated arrangement, coordination, and management of complex computer systems, [[middleware]], and services. It is often discussed as having an inherent [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] or even implicitly [[autonomic]] control, but those are largely [[aspirations]] or analogies rather than technical descriptions. In reality, ''orchestration'' is largely the effect of [[automation]] or systems deploying elements of [[control theory]]. This usage of ''orchestration'' is often discussed in the context of [[Service Oriented Architecture]], [[Platform virtualization|virtualization]], [[provisioning]], and '''dynamic datacenter''' topics. It is often used as a [[buzzword]]. A somewhat different usage relates to the process of coordinating an exchange of information through [[web service]] interactions. (See also [[service-oriented architecture]], and [[Web Service Choreography|web service choreography]]). Applications which decouple the orchestration layer from the service layer are sometimes called [[agile application]]s. Some texts make a [[Business_Process_Execution_Language#The_BPEL_language|distinction]] between orchestration and choreography. With the popularity of ''Cloud computing'' it is now necessary to understand Service Orchestration in the context of this paradigm. Work flows and processes are used in different domains. At one level there are level inter-company business processes and at another level there are processes to get the wide area network operational. To keep matters simple, we will define an orchestrator as the entity that manages complex cross domain (system, enterprise, firewall) processes and handle exceptions. Since an orchestrator is valuable in the fulfillment, assurance as well as billing processes, in its most advanced service aware incarnation, should be capable of adjustments based on feedback from monitoring tools. At the most basic level an orchestrator is a human. The main difference between a work flow automation and orchestration is that work flows are processed which are completed a processes within a single domain. Cloud Service orchestration therefore is the * Composing of Architecture, Tools and Processes by humans to deliver a defined service * Stitching of software and hardware components together to deliver a defined Service * Connecting and automating of work flows when applicable to deliver a defined service It is critical in the delivery of cloud services because * Cloud is all about scale – automated work flows are essential * Cloud Service delivery includes fulfillment assurance and billing * Cloud Services delivery entails work flows in various technical and business domains ==Examples== * [http://www.activevos.com/products-activevos.php ActiveVOS] is built on the [[BPEL]], [[BPEL4People]] and WS-Human Task open standards to allow developers the ability to orchestrate various systems and services. * [http://ode.apache.org/ Apache ODE] (Orchestration Director Engine) is a [[Business Process Execution Language|WS-BPEL]] 1.1 and 2.0 compliant [[business process management]] (BPM) engine that supports two communication layers: one based on [[Apache Axis2]] (Web Services HTTP transport) and another one based on the [[Java Business Integration]] standard (using [[Apache ServiceMix]]). It is capable of Hot-deployment, and features a management interface for processes, instances, and messages. * [http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/ias/bpel/index.html Oracle BPEL Process Manager] provides a framework for easily designing, deploying, monitoring, and administering processes based on BPEL standards.
