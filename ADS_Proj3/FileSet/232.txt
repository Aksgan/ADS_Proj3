<math>x</math>. The constraint in Line 3 prohibits assigning the same color to vertices <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> if there is an edge connecting them. If we combine this file with a definition of <math>G</math>, such as <pre> v(1..100). % 1,...,100 are vertices e(1,55). % there is an edge from 1 to 55 . . . </pre> and run smodels on it, with the numeric value of <math>n</math> specified on the command line, then the atoms of the form <math>color(\dots,\dots)</math> in the output of smodels will represent an <math>n</math>-coloring of <math>G</math>. The program in this example illustrates the "generate-and-test" organization that is often found in simple ASP programs. The choice rule describes a set of "potential solutions" -- a simple superset of the set of solutions to the given search problem. It is followed by a constraint, which eliminates all potential solutions that are not acceptable. However, the search process employed by smodels and other answer set solvers is not based on [[trial and error]]. ===Large clique=== A [[Clique (graph theory)|clique]] in a graph is a set of pairwise adjacent vertices. The following lparse program finds a clique of size <math>\geq n</math> in a given graph, or determines that it does not exist: <pre> n {in(X) : v(X)}. :- in(X), in(Y), v(X), v(Y), X!=Y, not e(X,Y), not e(Y,X). </pre> This is another example of the generate-and-test organization. The choice rule in Line 1 "generates" all sets consisting of <math>\geq n</math> vertices. The constraint in Line 2 "weeds out" the sets that are not cliques. ===Hamiltonian cycle=== A [[Hamiltonian cycle]] in a [[directed graph]] is a [[Path (graph theory)|cycle]] that passes through each vertex of the graph exactly once. The following Lparse program can be used to find a Hamiltonian cycle in a given directed graph if it exists; we assume that 0 is one of the vertices. <pre> {in(X,Y)} :- e(X,Y). :- 2 {in(X,Y) : e(X,Y)}, v(X). :- 2 {in(X,Y) : e(X,Y)}, v(Y). r(X) :- in(0,X), v(X). r(Y) :- r(X), in(X,Y), e(X,Y). :- not r(X), v(X). </pre> The choice rule in Line 1 "generates" all subsets of the set of edges. The three constraints "weed out" the subsets that are not Hamiltonian cycles. The last of them uses the auxiliary predicate <math>r(x)</math> ("<math>x</math> is reachable from 0") to prohibit the vertices that do not satisfy this condition. This predicate is defined recursively in Lines 4 and 5. This program is an example of the more general "generate, define and test" organization: it includes the definition of an auxiliary predicate that helps us eliminate all "bad" potential solutions. ==Comparison of implementations== {| class="wikitable" |- ! colspan="3" | Platform ! colspan="4" | Features ! colspan="1" | Mechanics |- ! style="background:#ffdead;" | Name ! style="background:#ffdead;" | OS ! style="background:#ffdead;" | Licence ! style="background:#ffdead;" | Variables ! style="background:#ffdead;" | Function symbols ! style="background:#ffdead;" | Explicit sets ! style="background:#ffdead;" | Explicit lists |- |{{rh}}|[[DLV]] |[[Linux]], [[Mac OS]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] |[[Freeware]] |{{yes}} |{{no}} |{{no}} |{{no}} | |- |{{rh}}|[[Smodels]] |[[Linux]], [[Mac OS]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] |[[GPL]] |{{yes}} |{{no}} |{{no}} |{{no}} | |} ==See also== *[[Default logic]] *[[Logic programming]] *[[Non-monotonic logic]] *[[Prolog]] *[[Stable model semantics]] ==References== <references/> ==External links== *[http://asparagus.cs.uni-potsdam.de/contest/ First ASP System Competition] *[http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/~dtai/events/ASP-competition/index.shtml Second ASP Competition] *[http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/platypus/ Platypus] *[http://www.kr.tuwien.ac.at/staff/tkren/deb.html A variety of answer set solvers packaged for Debian / Ubuntu] {{DEFAULTSORT:Answer Set Programming}} [[Category:Logic programming]] [[zh:回答集编程]]</text> </page> <page> <id>1986</id> <title>Anthrozoology</title> <text>{{zoology|Image:Dogsled_racing_Alaska.jpg}} '''Anthrozoology''' is the study of [[human being|human]]-[[animal]] interaction ("animal" referring to all ''non-human'' animals), also described as the science focusing on all aspects of the human-animal bond<ref>[http://www.anthrozoology.org/ anthrozoology.org | Research in Human-Animal Interaction<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and a bridge between the natural and social sciences.<ref>[http://www.wiu.edu/users/micasd/documents/27_2003-11-05_2.doc] (DOC format)</ref> Anthrozoology is a modern [[interdisciplinary]] and burgeoning field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines, including [[anthropology]], [[ethology]], [[medicine]], [[psychology]], [[veterinary medicine]] and [[zoology]]. A major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human-animal relationships on either party and the study of the reality of their interactions. [http://www.swabe.org/faq.htm swabe.org] comments: {{quote|In reality, there is little homogeneity in anthrozoological research, certainly as far as disciplinary approach, methodology and theory is concerned. The academic backgrounds of anthrozoological researchers can be extremely varied. There are, for example, social scientists, psychologists, zoologists, ethologists, historians, philosophers, veterinarians and even physicians studying the human-animal relationship.}} It adds that anthrozoology may veer towards ethics, behavioral research, welfare and promotion, and many other areas within the human-animal interface. ==Example areas of study== * The [[interaction]] and enhancement within [[Captivity (animal)|captive animal]] interactions. * Affective (emotional) or [[relational bonds between humans and animals]] (which may range from having [[companion animal]]s to [[zoophilia]]) * Human [[perception]]s and [[belief]]s in respect of other animals. * How some animals fit into human [[society|societies]]. * How these vary between [[culture]]s, and change over times. * The study of animal [[domestication]]: how and why [[domestic animal]]s evolved from wild species ([[paleoanthrozoology]]). * Captive zoo animal bonds with keepers Examples of papers published by ISAZ as of 2005 include: * Compatibility Stereotypes of People and Pets * Behavior of Children with Learning Disabilities Interacting with a Therapy Dog * Realistic Representations of Companion Animals in Comic Art in the USA * Advertising Animal Protection * Speciesism, Anthropocentrism, and Non-Western Cultures * Whale Shark Tourism in Ningaloo Marine Park, Australia * Judgments of Cruelty to Animals: Sex Differences and Effect of Awareness of Suffering * Motivations and Characteristics of Volunteer Flying-Fox Rehabilitators in Australia * Pets’ Roles in Parents’ Bereavement * Recent Shifts Regarding the Relationship between People and Other Animals in Japanese Culture * How Depressive Moods Affect the Behavior of Singly Living Persons Towards Their Cats * Bonds of trust shown between Zookeepers and Captive Animals ==See also== * [[Animal behavior]] * [[Relational bonds between humans and animals]] * [[Domestication of the horse]] * [[Origin of the domestic dog]] * [[Service animal]] * [[Animal studies]] ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== {{WVD}} ===Professional Bodies, Research Centers and Journals=== * [http://www.penncias.org CIAS: Center for the Interaction of Animals and Society] - a multi-disciplinary research center within the School of Veterinary Medicine
