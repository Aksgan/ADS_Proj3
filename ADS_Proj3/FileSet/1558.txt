of the (German) Naval Section. He had to face the shortage of [[Bombe]]s to decipher the Naval Enigma, which led to the use of American Bombes via [[OP-20-G]]. ==References== *''Action this Day'' edited by Michael Smith & Ralph Erskine (2001, Bantam London) ISBN 0593049101 *''Who was Who 1951-1960'' {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME = Birch, Francis | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH = 5 December 1889 | PLACE OF BIRTH = | DATE OF DEATH = 14 February 1956 | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Birch, Francis}} [[Category:1889 births]] [[Category:1956 deaths]] [[Category:British cryptographers]] [[Category:Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George]] [[Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire]] [[Category:Old Etonians]] [[Category:People associated with Bletchley Park]] [[Category:Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve personnel of World War I]] [[Category:Alumni of King's College, Cambridge]] [[Category:Fellows of King's College, Cambridge]] {{crypto-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>14129</id> <title>Frank Pasquill</title> <text>{{Infobox Scientist |name = Frank Pasquill |box_width = |image = |image_width = |caption = |birth_date = 8 September 1914 |birth_place = [[Trimdon]], [[County Durham]], [[England]] |death_date = {{death date and age|1994|10|15|1914|9|8|df=y}} |death_place = |residence = |citizenship = |nationality = |ethnicity = |field = [[Meteorology]] |work_institutions = [[Met Office|Meteorological Office]] |alma_mater = [[University College, Durham]] |doctoral_advisor = |doctoral_students = |known_for = Atmospheric diffusion |author_abbrev_bot = |author_abbrev_zoo = |influences = O.G.

He retired as Deputy Chief Scientific Officer. He was a fellow of the [[Royal Society]]. ==Biography== Frank Pasquill was the son of Joseph and Elizabeth (née Rudd) Pasquill. His father was a miner. Frank attended secondary school in [[Hartlepool]]. He was the first in his family to obtain a secondary education. He attended [[University College, Durham]] and earned [[British undergraduate degree classification#Degree classification|First Class Honours]] in [[physics]] in 1935. He was awarded a two-year fellowship at University College to pursue further studies. In 1937, he married Margaret Alice Turnbull. They had two daughters in the 57 year marriage. He worked from 1937 to 1943 at the Chemical Defence Establishment of the Meteorological Office at [[Porton Down]]. His main work was the measurement of the evaporation of liquids in turbulent air streams. He conducted both wind-tunnel and field measurements. He modified O.G. Sutton's equations based on these experiments. From 1943 to 1946, he worked in [[Queensland]], [[Australia]] on classified work on the dispersion of toxic agents. In 1946, he returned to head a new unit of the Meteorological Office at [[Cambridge]]. He conducted field measurements on evaporation and obtained vertical profiles of the turbulent fluxes of heat and water vapor. In 1950 he was awarded the [[Doctor of Science|D.Sc.]] from the University of Durham. He was assigned to the [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]] at [[Harwell]]. He worked with N.G. Stewart on the dispersion of radionuclides from nuclear plants and the from atomic testing. In 1954, he returned to Porton Down to conduct field measurements on the structure of atmospheric turbulence and the dispersion of pollutants. He developed a simple method for assessing atmospheric stability based on wind speed, solar radiation, cloud cover, and time of day. This resulted in the [[Air pollution dispersion terminology#Characterization of atmospheric turbulence|Pasquill stability classes]] A (very unstable) through F (very stable). In addition, he developed curves that are now interpreted as the vertical and horizontal dispersion coefficients, ''σ<sub>z</sub>'' and ''σ<sub>y</sub>''. In 1961, he transferred to the Micrometeorological Branch at [[Bracknell]]. He was promoted to Deputy Chief Scientific Officer in 1966 and in 1970 headed a research branch in [[Planetary boundary layer|boundary-layer meteorology]]. He retired in 1974. He spend a year at [[Pennsylvania State University]] and [[North Carolina State University]] as a visiting [[professor]]. At these institutions, he worked with Hans Panofsky, Kenneth Calder, Frank Gifford, and Robert McCormick. He was the author of a classic book in atmospheric diffusion. He was editor of the ''Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society''. He was president of the [[Royal Meteorological Society]] from 1970 to 1972. Pasquill was named a [[Fellow#Learned or professional societies|Fellow]] of the [[Royal Society]] in 1977. He was elected an Honorary Member of the Royal Meteorological Society in 1978 and was awarded its Symons Gold Medal in 1978. He served as chairman of the [[Central Electricity Generating Board]]'s Advisory Committee on Environmental Research from 1962 to 1980.<ref>John Mason and F.B.
