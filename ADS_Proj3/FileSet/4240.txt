magazines, notably those published by [[VNU]]. At this time he wrote his first security-related book, ''The Stephen Cobb Guide to PC & LAN Security'',<ref>[http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&CNT=10&CMD=10+records+per+page&CMD=lccn+%20%20%2089070748%20 Library of Congress]</ref> a comprehensive consideration of threats to data arising from the rapid increase in corporate use of [[personal computers]] and [[LANs]]. He became a [[CISSP]] in 1996. His guide to privacy for businesses was published in 2002. In 2008 he contributed several chapters to the ''Computer Security Handbook, 5th Edition''.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/Computer-Security-Handbook-Seymour-Bosworth/dp/0471716529 Amazon.com listing]</ref> [[File:dare not walk alone.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Dare Not Walk Alone]]Cobb has more than 25 years experience working in computer audit, information assurance, data privacy,<ref>[http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,90339,00.html?f=x73 ComputerWorld]</ref> and company building. He has enjoyed success a serial entrepreneur (InfoSec Labs, [[ePrivacy Group]]) and as an employee (NCSA/[[ICSA Labs]],<ref>[http://www.pcw.co.uk/crn/features/2010164/enemy-within Personal Computer World]</ref> [[Rainbow Technologies]], [[STSN]], and Monetate). He has also been popular as a writer, trainer, and speaker.<ref>[http://www.isp-planet.com/equipment/2003/spamsquelcher.html ISP Planet]</ref> More recently Cobb has turned his attention to social issues. In 2005, he initiated an affordable housing project in [[St. Johns County, Florida]]. He is both [[Executive Producer]] and [[Film producer|Producer]] of ''[[Dare Not Walk Alone]]'', a feature-length documentary about Florida's role in the [[civil rights movement]]. Written and directed by Jeremy Dean, the film documents the long suppressed history of events that took place in [[St. Augustine, Florida]] in 1964 and which contributed to the passage of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1035731/ IMDB]</ref> However, the film looks beyond past events to also consider challenges faced by African Americans in St. Johns County 40 years after that legislation was passed, as well as efforts at racial reconciliation. When ''Dare Not Walk Alone'' made its theatrical debut in Los Angeles, Sara Schieron of [[Boxoffice (magazine)|Boxoffice Magazine]] declared it "has the potential to do real good in the world"<ref>[http://boxoffice.com/reviews/2008/04/dare-not-walk-alone-the-war-of.php Boxoffice Magazine]</ref> and Eric Monder of [[Film Journal International]] noted, "The racial politics of the current presidential election make this film all the more significant."<ref>[http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/reviews/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003794585 Film Journal International]</ref> ''Dare Not Walk Alone'' has been screened at universities such as Notre Dame and a number of [[historically black colleges and universities]]. The film was released on DVD in October 2008. In January 2009 the film was nominated for an [[NAACP Image Award]] for Outstanding Documentary. Cobb has spoken at many different conferences in more than 10 countries. He maintains and contributes to a number of web sites and blogs. In 2006 he was interviewed by the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] publication Ubiqity.<ref>[http://www.acm.org/ubiquity/interviews/v7i27_cobb.html Ubiquity Volume 7 Issue 27 (18 July 2006 - 24 July 2006)]</ref> In 2008, Cobb joined Monetate, a Philadelphia-based startup, to evangelize the company's [[post-click marketing]] platform. == Companies == In the field of [[information assurance]] Cobb's main focus has been on maximizing the benefits of information technology to businesses, governments and communities through the reduction of IT-related fraud and risk. In 1995 Cobb became one of the first ten employees of the National Computer Security Association (later [[ICSA Labs]] and [[Tru-Secure]]). At NCSA he produced the widely distributed ''NCSA Firewall Policy Guide'' and helped form the Firewall Product Consortium. In 1997, Cobb joined forces with Michael Miora, David Brussin, and Vincent Schiavone to turn Miora Systems Consulting into InfoSec Labs, a security consultancy which was acquired by Rainbow Technologies in 1999. After two years as Director of Special Projects ar Rainbow, Cobb again joined forces with Brussin, Miora, and Schiavone, this time to create [[ePrivacy Group]]. The long term goal of ePrivacy Group was to eliminate spam. This involved research into trusted email technology, email stamps, reputational seals, consumer email matching systems, and TCP/IP [[traffic shaping]]. At ePrivacy Group Cobb helped create and evangelize the SpamSquelcher anti-spam technology which became [[TurnTide]] and for which [[Symantec]] paid $28 million in 2004.<ref>[http://news.cnet.com/Symantec-snaps-up-antispam-firm/2100-7355_3-5266548.html CNET, July 12, 2004]</ref> This technology is now widely deployed by large enterprises and [[Internet service provider]]s to block spam from entering their networks. == References == {{reflist}} {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME = Cobb, Stephen T. | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH = 1952 | PLACE OF BIRTH = [[Coventry]], [[Warwickshire]], [[England]] | DATE OF DEATH = | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Cobb, Stephen T.}} [[Category:American writers]] [[Category:American bloggers]] [[Category:American computer businesspeople]] [[Category:American filmmakers]] [[Category:People associated with computer security]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:Technology writers]] [[Category:Old Coventrians]] [[Category:1952 births]]</text> </page> <page> <id>35735</id> <title>Stephen White (programmer)</title> <text>{{Infobox person | name = Stephen F.
