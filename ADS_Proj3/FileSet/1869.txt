''Hamsterz Life'' is also known as ''Love â™¥ Hamster'' or ''Love Love Hamster'' in Japan. ==Gameplay== ''Hamsterz Life'' is from the [[Petz]] series from Ubisoft for the handheld systems. Being released after ''Petz 5'', it is part of the second Petz series. ''Hamsterz Life'' lets you raise several breeds of [[hamsters]] and build fully customizable homes for them to live in. Just as in the other Petz games, players can interact with their hamsters by training, playing with, and feeding them. At the start of the game, players can select their first hamster and name it. The hamster will then appear in a cage and be ready to play. Various actions can be chosen including training, feeding, care and other options. Training consists of teaching the hamster words (which they repeat back in their own hamster speak) by speaking the set phrases into the DS microphone. The hamster can repeat these phrases back, but inaudibly. Players can clean the cage and brush their hamsters. Hamsterz Life also includes many mini-games to play. Players can only have one hamster at home at once, any other hamsters that are owned are left with a girl with hamster ears until you wish to switch. Your hamsters can visit with the hamsters of friends who also own Hamsterz Life. When playing mini-games, if you win you receive prizes such as food or toys. You can also let your hamster out of its cage to play in the surrounding room. There are present boxes in the room, which contain prizes you receive when your hamster finds them. ==External links== *[http://petz.uk.ubi.com/hamsterz/ Ubisoft's Official Petz Website] [[Category:2006 video games]] [[Category:Nintendo DS games]] [[Category:Nintendo DS-only games]] [[Category:Ubisoft Entertainment games]] [[Category:Video games developed in Japan]] [[Category:Virtual pets]] It is also said to be a cartoon on television yet to be shown its still in process of turning it into a series [[it:Hamsterz Life]]</text> </page> <page> <id>16206</id> <title>Hand (handwriting)</title> <text>A '''hand''' in [[handwriting]] is someone's own style or a particular type of handwriting.

In the most commonly encountered scenario, a [[personal computer|workstation]] with a [[graphical user interface]], all windows belonging to the frozen program become static, and though the mouse cursor still moves on the screen, neither typing on the keyboard nor clicking the mouse produces any effect in the program's windows. The mouse cursor may also be stuck in a form indicating that it is waiting for some operation to complete, such as an [[hourglass]] or a [[spinning wait cursor]]. Many modern operating systems provide the user with a means to terminate a hung program without [[reboot]]ing or [[logging out]]. In more severe hangs affecting the whole system, no window belonging to any program will respond to keyboard or mouse input, and often the mouse cursor will freeze in place on the screen. Almost always, the only way to recover from a system freeze is to reboot the machine, usually by [[power cycling]] with an on/off or reset button. A hang differs from a [[Crash (computing)|crash]], in which a program exits abnormally or the operating system shuts down.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Hangs are not limited to [[client (computing)|client]] personal computers with a [[graphical user interface]], as in the example above. [[server (computing)|Servers]] can hang as well. In those cases, the server ceases to respond to requests. These sorts of hangs are typically addressed by a solution far more complex than an on/off or reset button. [[Pre-emptive multitasking]] operating systems, such as [[Microsoft]] [[Windows 2000]]/[[Windows XP|XP]]/[[Windows Vista|Vista]]/[[Windows 7|7]], [[Apple Computer]]'s [[Mac OS X]] and [[Linux]] hang less often as the multi-tasking system is not affected by non-terminating loops and further does not require tasks to yield control to the operating system.{{Clarify|October 2009|date=October 2009}} If a task does hang, the scheduler may switch to another group of interdependent tasks so that all processes will not hang.<ref>{{Cite patent | inventor-last = D'Souza | inventor-first = David | publication-date = 1996-06-21 | issue-date = 2000-04-18 | title =
