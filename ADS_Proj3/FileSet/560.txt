from CAdES is that electronically signed documents can remain valid for long periods, even if underlying cryptographic algorithms are broken. ==Profiles== CAdES defines six profiles (forms) differing in protection level offered. Each profile includes and extends the previous one: *'''CAdES''', basic form just satisfying Directive legal requirements for advanced signature; *'''CAdES-T''' (timestamp), adding [[Trusted timestamping|timestamp]] field to protect against repudiation; *'''CAdES-C''' (complete), adding references to verification data (certificates and revocation lists) to the signed documents to allow off-line verification and verification in future (but not storing actual verification data); *'''CAdES-X''' (extended), adding [[Trusted timestamping|timestamps]] on the references introduced by CAdES-C to protect against possible compromise of certificates in chain in future; *'''CAdES-X-L''' (extended long-term), adding actual certificates and revocation lists to the signed document to allow verification in future even if their original source is not available; *'''CAdES-A''' (archival), adding possibility for periodical [[Trusted timestamping|timestamping]] (e.g. each year) of the archived document to prevent compromise caused by weakening signature during long-time storage period. ==See also== * [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute|European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)]] * [[Cryptographic Message Syntax]] * [[XAdES]], XML Advanced Electronic Signature * [[PAdES]], PDF Advanced Electronic Signature * [[Trusted timestamping]] ==External links== *[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5126.html RFC 5126 CMS Advanced Electronic Signatures (CAdES)] *[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3126.html RFC 3126 Electronic Signature Formats for long term electronic signatures] *[http://www.etsi.org/WebSite/Technologies/ElectronicSignature.aspx ETSI TS 101 733 CAdES] version 1.7.4 from Jul, 2008 *[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3126.html RFC 3126 Electronic Signature Formats for long term electronic signatures] * [http://www.globaltrustfinder.com/PKCS7UserSigningStep1.aspx GlobalTrustFinder - Demo CAdES-T (Powered by ADSS)] [[Category:Cryptography standards]] [[ja:CAdES]]</text> </page> <page> <id>4961</id> <title>CCDCOE</title> <text>{{Infobox Military Structure |name=Küberkaitse Kompetentsikeskus<br />Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence [[Image:CCD COE.png|200px]] |location= Located in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]] |coordinates={{coord|59|25|23.69|N|24|46|3.26|E|region:EE-37|display=inline,title}} |type=NATO Centre of Excellence |built=2008 |controlledby=CCD COE Steering Committee }} '''CCDCOE''', officially the '''Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence''' ({{lang-et|K5 ''or'' Küberkaitse Kompetentsikeskus}}) is one of [[NATO]] [[Allied Command Transformation#NATO Centres of Excellence|Centres of Excellence]], located in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]]. == Overview == The Cyber Defense Center in Tallinn is one of 15 accredited <ref>(15 Dec 2010). [https://transnet.act.nato.int/WISE/TNCC/CentresofE NATO Transformation Network - Centres of Excellence]</ref> [[Allied Command Transformation#NATO Centres of Excellence|Centres of Excellence]] (COEs), for training on technically sophisticated aspects of NATO operations. It is being funded nationally and multi-nationally as these centers are closely linked with [[Allied Command Transformation]] and promote the alliance-approved transformation goals. <br /> <br /> The main agenda of the facility is to: * improve cyber defence interoperability within the [[NATO Network Enabled Capability]] ([[NNEC]]) environment, * design the doctrine and concept development and their validation, * enhance information security and cyber defence education, awareness, and training, * provide cyber defence support for experimentation (including on-site) for experimentation, * analyzing the legal aspects of cyber defence. The centre has also other responsibilities which include: * contribution to development of Cyber Defense Center practices and standards with NATO, [[Partnership for Peace|PfP]], [[Enlargement of NATO|NATO candidates]] and non-NATO nations, * contribution to development of NATO security policies related to cyber defence its definition of scope and responsibility of military in cyber defence, * conduction of the cyber defence focused training, awareness campaigns, workshops, and courses, * developing and conducting cyber defence focused exercises and its ability to provide CD exercise support, * providing cyber defence SMEs to NATO and its ability in cyber defence testing and validating. == Current status == As Founding Nations, Estonia, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Spain came together to establish the Centre in 2008.<ref>[http://www.nato.int/cps/en/SID-009B6C86-85E8A497/natolive/topics_68372.htm?selectedLocale=en NATO A-Z Centres of Excellence]</ref> The Centre received full accreditation by NATO and attained the status of International Military Organisation on the 28th of October, 2008. <br>The CCD COE is open to all NATO nations. In addition, CCD COE can establish cooperative relations with non-NATO nations, universities, research institutions, and businesses as Contributing Participants. <br>The Centre conducts research and training on cyber security and includes a staff of approximately 30 persons.<ref>[http://epl.ekspress.ee/?uudised=389847 NATO andis rohelise tule Eesti küberkaitse kavale]</ref> <br> There are currently 9 countries involved within the centre <ref>[http://www.nato.int/docu/update/2008/05-may/e0514a.html NATO opens the CCDCOE in Tallinn]</ref>: ;{{flagcountry|Estonia}} ;{{flagcountry|Germany}} ;{{flagcountry|Italy}} ;{{flagcountry|Latvia}} ;{{flagcountry|Lithuania}} ;{{flagcountry|Slovakia}} ;{{flagcountry|Spain}} ;{{flagcountry|Hungary}} ;{{flagcountry|USA}} The U.S. and Turkey have announced their intent to join in the near future.<ref>[http://www.ccdcoe.org/47.html CCD COE official webpage, FAQ]</ref> <br> Estonia has also shown interest in Iceland to join the Cyber Defence Centre.<ref>[http://www.estemb.org/news/aid-1306 Estonia invites Iceland to Participate in Cyber Defence Centre]</ref> ==History== In 2003, prior to the country’s official accession to NATO, Estonia proposed the creation of a “cyber excellence center”. The [[2006 Riga summit]] listed possible cyber attacks among the asymmetric threats to the common security and acknowledged the need for programs to protect information systems over the long term. The cyber attacks on Estonia in 2007 highlighted for the first time the potential vulnerability of any NATO countries, their institutions and societies, and even NATO itself to disruption or penetration of their information and communications systems. Estonia’s proposals for a NATO cyber excellence center received strong support from the alliance’s Secretary-General “Jaap” de Hoop Scheffer. NATO completed an assessment of the situation, partly in light of Estonia’s experience, in October 2007, and approved a NATO policy on cyber defense in January 2008. NATO’s summit communiqué in Bucharest in April announced NATO’s readiness to “provide a capability to assist allied nations, upon request, to counter a cyber attack”. {{cquote|''The need for a cyber-defence centre to be opened today is compelling.
