b = 1 (a 50:50 "even money" bet) to show the general idea and provide some insights. When b = 1, the Kelly bettor bets 2p - 1 times initial wealth, W, as shown above. If he wins, he has 2pW. If he loses, he has 2(1 - p)W. Suppose he makes N bets like this, and wins K of them. The order of the wins and losses doesn't matter, he will have: : <math> 2^Np^K(1-p)^{N-K}W \! </math> Suppose another bettor bets a different amount, (2p - 1 + <math>\Delta</math>)W for some positive or negative <math>\Delta</math>. He will have (2p + <math>\Delta</math>)W after a win and [2(1 - p)- <math>\Delta</math>]W after a loss. After the same wins and losses as the Kelly bettor, he will have: : <math> (2p+\Delta)^K[2(1-p)-\Delta]^{N-K}W \! </math> Take the derivative of this with respect to <math>\Delta</math> and get: : <math> K(2p+\Delta)^{K-1}[2(1-p)-\Delta]^{N-K}W-(N-K)(2p+\Delta)^K[2(1-p)-\Delta]^{N-K-1}W\! </math> The turning point of the original function occurs when this derivative equals zero, which occurs at: : <math> K[2(1-p)-\Delta]=(N-K)(2p+\Delta) \! </math> which implies: : <math> \Delta=2(\frac{K}{N}-p) \! </math> but: : <math> \lim_{N \to +\infty}\frac{K}{N}=p \! </math> so in the long run, final wealth is maximized by setting <math>\Delta</math> to zero, which means following Kelly strategy. This illustrates that Kelly has both a deterministic and a stochastic component. If one knows K and N and wishes to pick a constant fraction of wealth to bet each time (otherwise one could cheat and, for example, bet zero after the K<sup>th</sup> win knowing that the rest of the bets will lose), one will end up with the most money if one bets: : <math> \left(2\frac{K}{N}-1\right)W \! </math> each time. This is true whether N is small or large. The "long run" part of Kelly is necessary because K is not known in advance, just that as N gets large, K will approach pN. Someone who bets more than Kelly can do better if K > pN for a stretch; someone who bets less than Kelly can do better if K < pN for a stretch, but in the long run, Kelly always wins. == Reasons to bet less than Kelly == A natural assumption is that taking more risk increases the probability of both very good and very bad outcomes. One of the most important ideas in Kelly is that betting more than the Kelly amount ''decreases'' the probability of very good results, while still increasing the probability of very bad results. Since in reality we seldom know the precise probabilities and payoffs, and since overbetting is worse than underbetting, it makes sense to err on the side of caution and bet less than the Kelly amount. Kelly assumes sequential bets that are [[statistical independence|independent]] (later work generalizes to bets that have sufficient independence). That may be a good model for some gambling games, but generally does not apply in investing and other forms of risk-taking. The Kelly property appears "in the long run" (that is, it is an [[asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]] property). To a person, it matters whether the property emerges over a small number or a large number of bets. It makes sense to consider not just the long run, but where losing a bet might leave one in the short and medium term as well. A related point is that Kelly assumes the only important thing is long-term wealth. Most people also care about the path to get there. Kelly betting leads to highly volatile short-term outcomes which many people find unpleasant, even if they believe they will do well in the end. == Bernoulli == In a 1738 article, [[Daniel Bernoulli]] suggested that when one has a choice of bets or investments that one should choose that with the highest [[geometric mean]] of outcomes. This is mathematically equivalent to the Kelly criterion, although the motivation is entirely different (Bernoulli wanted to resolve the [[St. Petersburg paradox]]).

He is probably best known for his association with The [[Apache Software Foundation]] and the ApacheCon series of user conferences. He currently lives in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], [[North Carolina]]. ==Background== Coar attended the [[University of Massachusetts]], majoring in computer topics, but left before completing a degree. He worked for the University itself for several years, and has since been employed by [[General Dynamics]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], [http://process.com/ Process Software Corporation], and [[IBM]]. He is currently contracting to [[Red Hat]] through the [[Insight Global]] agency. ==Open Source== Coar has been active in various open software projects, and enthusiastically lectures and educates internationally about open development methodologies and distributed collaboration. He has addressed numerous local groups, regional conferences, and government organisations. He is co-author of RFC 3875, the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) specification. ===Apache Project=== Ken Coar is a member of The [[Apache Software Foundation]] and was a Director on its board from its incorporation in 1999 through June 2007.
