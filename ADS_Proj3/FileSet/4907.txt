The XCGPU is the first mass marketed chip that combines a desktop class CPU, a powerful GPU, memory controllers and IO. It also contains a "front side bus replacement block" that connects the CPU and GPU internally in exactly the same manner as the [[Front-side bus|front side bus]] would have done when the CPU and GPU were separate chips, so that the XCGPU doesn't change the hardware characteristics of the Xbox 360. XCGPU contains 372 million transistors and is manufactured by [[GlobalFoundries]] on a 45 nm process. Compared to the original [[chipset]] in the Xbox 360 the combined power requirements are reduced by 60% and the physical chip area by 50%.<ref name="ArsXCGPU">{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2010/08/microsoft-beats-intel-amd-to-market-with-cpugpu-combo-chip.ars|title=Microsoft beats Intel, AMD to market with CPU/GPU combo chip|date=2010-08-24|accessdate=2010-08-24|author=Jon Stokes, Ars Technica}}</ref><ref name="360S-teardown">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcper.com/article.php?aid=940|title=The New Xbox 360 S "Slim" Teardown: Opened and Tested|accessdate=2010-06-24|author=PC Perspective|date=2010-06-21}}</ref> ==References== {{reflist}} *[http://forums.xbox-scene.com/index.php?showtopic=231928 Xenon hardware overview] by Pete Isensee, Development Lead, Xbox Advanced Technology Group, written some time before 23 June 2004 ==External links== *[http://arstechnica.com/articles/paedia/cpu/xbox360-2.ars Ars Technica explains the Xenon CPU] {{Xbox}} [[Category:Xbox 360|Xenon]] [[Category:PowerPC implementations]] [[Category:IBM microprocessors]] {{Xbox-stub}} [[es:Xenon (procesador)]] [[fr:Xenon (processeur)]] [[ko:제논 프로세서]] [[it:Xenon]] [[ja:Xenon (マイクロプロセッサ)]] [[pt:Xenon (processador)]] [[ru:Xenon]] [[sv:Xenon (processor)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>40789</id> <title>Xerox Operating System</title> <text>XOS was an operating system for the [[Scientific Data Systems|XDS]] [[SDS Sigma 7|Sigma]] line of computers "optimized for direct replacement of IBM [[DOS/360 and successors|DOS/360]] installations" and to provide [[Real-time operating system|real-time]] and [[timesharing]] support <ref name="factsheet">[http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/sds/sigma/xos/XOS_Fact_Sheet_Aug72.pdf "XOS Fact Sheet, 1972"]</ref>.

It was [[satire|satirized]] in [[Japan]], where, known as {{Nihongo|'''Senkousha'''|先行者|Senkōsha}}, it became an [[internet phenomenon]]; one article described the protruding joints near the robot's [[crotch]] as a "[[cannon]]", resulting in [[internet game]]s based on the concept. == Development == China's robotics research began during the 1980s, and their resources at the time were primitive compared to other countries'. Nonetheless, the National University of Defense Technology was determined to make a robot for China, after seeing [[Japan]]'s and [[United States|America]]'s robots in the [[Expo '85]] world fair in [[Tsukuba, Ibaraki|Tsukuba]], Japan. On 31 December 1987, the Chinese robot's legs were successfully programmed. By 1989, the team moved onto the robot's synchronization of the hands, nervous system, and visual sensors, thus steering the project into the direction of making a humanoid robot. On 29 November 2000, the robot was complete, and the team named it "Xianxingzhe", meaning forerunner, as the robot was hailed as a major technological breakthrough in China. == Parody == Though a significant advance in robotics in China, the robot was truly famous for the [[Parody|spoof]] that was made on it. === Samurai Damashii === On 3 March 2001, the Japanese website Samurai Damasii (侍魂) posted a page{{ref|samuraidamasii}} ridiculing the Senkousha (Japanese reading of the Chinese characters for Xianxingzhe) in response to the Chinese enthusiasm. In that page, Samurai Damashii exaggerated the Senkousha as "the crystallization of China's four thousand years of scientific knowledge", commented on the crude design (e.g. the "Chinese Cannon" on its crotch), and put its image among images of [[Honda]]'s [[ASIMO]] and [[Sony]]'s [[QRIO]] SDR-3X for juxtaposition. Later, in a separate article, the site "revealed" that the Senkousha was actually a military weapon, and elaborated on the protruding joint on the robot's crotch. According to
