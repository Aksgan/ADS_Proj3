appropriate [[Function (mathematics)|function]] types. The interpretation of any constituent is then simply the value of a function at an argument. With some modifications to handle [[intensionality]] and [[quantification]], this approach can be used to cover a wide variety of semantic phenomena. ==Historical notes== The basic ideas of categorial grammar date from work by [[Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz]] (in 1935) and [[Yehoshua Bar-Hillel]] (in 1953). In 1958, [[Joachim Lambek]] introduced a [[Lambek Calculus|syntactic calculus]] that formalized the function [[type constructors]] along with various rules for the combination of functions. This calculus is a forerunner of [[linear logic]] in that it is a [[substructural logic]]. [[Montague grammar]] uses an ad hoc syntactic system for English that is based on the principles of categorial grammar. Although [[Richard Montague|Montague's]] work is sometimes regarded as syntactically uninteresting, it helped to bolster interest in categorial grammar by associating it with a highly successful formal treatment of natural language [[semantics]]. More recent work in categorial grammar has focused on the improvement of syntactic coverage. One formalism which has received considerable attention in recent years is [[Mark Steedman|Steedman]] and [[Anna Szabolcsi|Szabolcsi]]'s [[combinatory categorial grammar]] which builds on [[combinatory logic]] invented by [[Moses Schönfinkel]] and [[Haskell Curry]]. There are a number of related formalisms of this kind in linguistics, such as [[type logical grammar]] and [[abstract categorial grammar]]. ==Some definitions== *'''Derivation''' A derivation is a binary tree that encodes a proof. *'''Parse tree''' A derivation can be displayed as a parse tree, showing the syntactic structure of a sentence. *'''Functor''' and '''Argument''' In a left (right) function application, the node of the type A\B (A/B) is called the functor, and the node of the type A is called an argument. *'''Functor-argument structure''' ==Refinements of categorial grammar== A variety of changes to categorial grammar have been proposed to improve syntactic coverage. Some of the most common ones are listed below. ===Features and subcategories=== Most systems of categorial grammar subdivide categories. The most common way to do this is by tagging them with [[grammatical feature|features]], such as [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical gender|gender]], [[Grammatical number|number]], and [[Grammatical tense|tense]]. Sometimes only atomic categories are tagged in this way. In Montague grammar, it is traditional to subdivide function categories using a multiple slash convention, so ''A/B'' and ''A//B'' would be two distinct categories of left-applying functions, that took the same arguments but could be distinguished between by other functions taking them as arguments. ===Function composition=== Rules of function composition are included in many categorial grammars. An example of such a rule would be one that allowed the concatenation of a constituent of type ''A/B'' with one of type ''B/C'' to produce a new constituent of type ''A/C''. The semantics of such a rule would simply involve the composition of the functions involved. Function composition is important in categorial accounts of [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] and [[extraction]], especially as they relate to phenomena like [[right node raising]]. The introduction of function composition into a categorial grammar leads to many kinds of derivational ambiguity that are vacuous in the sense that they do not correspond to semantic ambiguities. ===Conjunction=== Many categorial grammars include a typical conjunction rule, of the general form ''X CONJ X → X'', where ''X'' is a category. Conjunction can generally be applied to nonstandard constituents resulting from type raising or function composition.. ===Type raising=== Rules of type raising allow one to convert an expression of category ''X'' into one of category ''Y/(Y\X)'' or ''Y\(Y/X)'', for some other category ''Y''. These rules essentially reverse the function-argument relationship. ===Discontinuity=== The grammar is extended to handle linguistic phenomena such as discontinuous idioms, gapping and extraction. ==See also== *[[Combinatory categorial grammar]] ==References== *Curry, Haskell B. and Richard Feys (1958), Combinatory Logic, Vol. 1.

In broad terms, categorical logic represents both syntax and semantics by a [[category (mathematics)|category]], and an [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] by a [[functor]]. The categorical framework provides a rich conceptual background for logical and type-theoretic constructions. The subject has been recognisable in these terms since around 1970. == Overview == There are three important<!--to computer science --> themes in the categorical approach to logic: * [[Categorical semantics]]. Categorical logic introduces the notion of ''structure valued in a category'' C with the classical [[model theory|model theoretic]] notion of a structure appearing in the particular case where C is the [[Category of sets|category of sets and functions]]. This notion has proven useful when the set-theoretic notion of a model lacks generality and/or is inconvenient. [[R.A.G. Seely]]'s modeling of various [[impredicative]]
