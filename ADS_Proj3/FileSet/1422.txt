Excel|Excel]] Reporting Toolkit developed by [[Extentech]].<ref>[http://www.ajaxwith.com/Extentech-Inc-Releases-ExtenXLS-6-0.html Extentech Inc., Releases ExtenXLS 6.0<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It is a [[Report|Reporting]] [[API]] that allows for the reading in, modifying and creation of [[spreadsheet]]-based reports from [[Java platform|Java]] applications.<ref>[http://www.web2journal.com/read/472077.htm Extentech Inc. Advances Middleware Market with Web 2.0 Enabled API<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Written entirely in the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]], ExtenXLS creates new spreadsheet files from scratch as well as from existing spreadsheet files templates. ExtenXLS has the ability to utilize data from any source and output it in Excel-compatible [[Microsoft Excel|XLS]], [[XML]], and [[HTML]] formats. Common uses range from a [[Java Servlet]] that produces financial analysis reports to [[Java bean]]s embedded in [[JavaServer Pages]] for use in executing formula calculations. The ExtenXLS API can be used as a desktop spreadsheet component or embedded in a server application. With the ability to reuse existing spreadsheets, ExtenXLS can update template XLS files with fresh data from databases and output to custom reports. It has an Excel compatibility, template input files can range from a variety of complex legacy spreadsheets such as: surveys, checklists, what-if scenarios, and historical portfolio data. ExtenXLS contains methods that can create new WorkBooks from scratch, allowing for the insertion of new cells containing text, and numeric data. The product allows for customization of output with hundreds of fonts, colors, patterns, borders, formulas, named ranges, and built-in formats such as: currency, date, financial and numeric formatting patterns. Other potential uses include: user interfaces built with the included [[Swing (Java)|Java Swing]] spreadsheet components, and transformations of spreadsheets into HTML, and XML. ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://extentech.com/estore/product_detail.jsp?product_group_id=1 ExtenXLS] *[http://sheetster.com/ Sheetster.com Web Spreadsheet based on ExtenXLS] *[http://jdj.sys-con.com/read/37617.htm ExtenXLS Java/XLS Toolkit 2.1 product review] [[Category:Java platform software]] [[Category:Reporting software]] {{programming-software-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>12901</id> <title>Extended Affix Grammar</title> <text>In [[computer science]], '''Extended [[Affix]] Grammar'''s ('''EAG''') are a [[formal grammar]] formalism for describing the [[Context-free_grammar | context free]] and [[Context-sensitive_grammar | context sensitive]] [[syntax]] of language, both [[natural language]] and [[programming language]]s. EAGs are a member of the family of [[two-level grammar]]s; more specifically, a restriction of [[Van Wijngaarden grammar]]s with the specific purpose of making [[parsing]] feasible. Like Van Wijngaarden grammars, EAGs have ''hyperrules'' that form a [[context-free grammar]] except in that their nonterminals may have arguments, known as ''affixes'', the possible values of which are supplied by another context-free grammar, the ''metarules''. EAGs introduced and studied by [[David Watt (computer scientist)|D.A. Watt]] in 1974; recognizers were developed at the University of Nijmegen between 1985 and 1995. The EAG compiler developed there will generate either a recogniser, a transducer, a translator, or a syntax directed editor for a language described in the EAG formalism. The formalism is quite similar to [[Prolog]], to the extent that it borrowed its [[cut operator]]. EAGs have been used to write grammars of natural languages such as English, Spanish, and Hungarian. The aim was to verify the grammars by making them parse corpora of text ([[corpus linguistics]]); hence, parsing had to be sufficiently practical. However, the [[parse tree explosion]] problem that ambiguities in natural language tend to produce in this type of approach is worsened for EAGs because each choice of affix value may produce a separate parse, even when several different values are equivalent. The remedy proposed was to switch to the much simpler Affix Grammar over a [[Finite]] [[Lattice]]s ([[Affix grammar over a finite lattice|AGFL]]) instead, in which metagrammars can only produce simple finite languages.<ref>[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.53.5264 ''Affix grammars for natural languages'', by C.H.A.

Firms in the extended enterprise may operate independently, for example, through market mechanisms, or cooperatively through agreements and contracts. Alternatively referred to as a "[[supply chain]]" or a "[[value chain]]", the extended enterprise describes the community of participants involved with provisioning a set of service offerings. The extended enterprise associated with "[[McDonald's]]", for example, includes not only [[McDonald's Corporation]], but also [[franchisee]]s and [[joint venture]] partners of McDonald's Corporation, the [[3PL]]'s that provide food and materials to McDonald's restaurants, the [[advertising agencies]] that produce and distribute McDonald's advertising, the [[Distributor (business)|supplier]]s of McDonald's food [[ingredients]], kitchen equipment, [[building services]], [[utilities]], and other goods and services, the designers of [[Happy Meal]] toys, and others. Extended Enterprise is a more descriptive term than supply chain, in that it permits the notion of different types and degrees and permanence of [[connectivity]]. Connections may be by [[contract]], as in [[partnership]]s or [[alliance]]s or [[trade agreement]]s, or by [[open market]] exchange or participation in public [[tariff]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is the Extended Enterprise?|author=James P.

ISBN 1-591398-39-8</ref> The notion of the Extended Enterprise has taken on more importance as firms have become more specialized and inter-connected, trade has become more global, processes have become more standardized and information has become ubiquitous. The standardization of [[business process]]es has permitted companies to purchase as services many of the activities that previously had been provided directly by the [[business entity|firm]]. By [[outsourcing]] certain business functions that had been previously self-provided, such as [[transportation]], [[warehousing]], [[procurement]], [[public relations]], [[information technology]], firms have been able to concentrate their resources on those investments and activities that provide them the greatest rate of
