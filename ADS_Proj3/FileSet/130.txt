Hacking Platforms, and disguising, through the use of “[[Proxy server|proxies]],” the Internet Protocol addresses from which their attacks originated.<ref name="DOJNJ" /> The indictment said the hackers tested their program against 20 [[anti virus programs]]. Rene Palomino Jr., attorney for Gonzalez, charged in a blog on the ''New York Times'' website that the indictment arose out of squabbling among U.S. Attorney offices in New York, Massachusetts and New Jersey. Palomino said that Gonzalez was in negotiations with New York and Massachusetts for a plea deal in connection with the T.J. Maxx case when New Jersey made its indictment. Palomino identified the unindicted conspirator "P.T." as Damon Patrick Toey who had pled guilty in the T.J. Maxx case. Palomino said Toey rather than Gonzalez was the ring leader of the Heartland case. Palomino further said, “Mr. Toey has been cooperating since Day One. He was staying at (Gonzalez’s) apartment. This whole creation was Mr. Toey’s idea...It was his baby. This was not Albert Gonzalez. I know for a fact that he wasn’t involved in all of the chains that were hacked from New Jersey.”<ref>[http://www.storefrontbacktalk.com/securityfraud/gonzalez-case-raises-very-oid%E2%80%94and-very-frightening%E2%80%94retail-security-issues/ Gonzalez Case Raises Very OId Retail Security Issues – Storefrontbacktalk.com – August 23, 2009]</ref> Palomino said one of the unnamed Russian hackers in the Heartland case was [[Maksym Yastremskiy]] who was also indicted in the T.J.

Mendelzon''' was an Argentine-Canadian [[computer scientists|computer scientist]] who died on June 16, 2005. Alberto Mendelzon was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He received a Ph.D. degree from [[Princeton University]] in 1979, where his advisor was [[Jeffrey Ullman]]. After that he was a post-doctoral fellow at the [[IBM T.J. Watson Research Center]] for a year before joining the faculty of the [[University of Toronto]] in 1980. He was one of the pioneers who helped to lay the foundations of [[relational databases]]. His early work on database dependencies has been influential in both the theory and practice of data management. He has made fundamental contributions in the areas of graphical query languages, knowledge-base systems, and on-line analytic processing. His work has provided the foundation for languages used to query the structure of the web. Mendelzon established some of the earliest results on using the relational data model. Together with his thesis advisor, [[Jeffrey Ullman]], and fellow Princeton students, including [[David Maier]] and [[Yeshoshua Sagiv]], he co-authored a number of influential papers that laid out
