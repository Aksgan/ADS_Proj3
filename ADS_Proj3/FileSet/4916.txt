As the Cell/B.E. [[Multi-core processor|multi-core]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]] offers astonishing performance capability for optimized code on a unique offering of [[hardware]] from select [[vendor]]s, it is critical that the development environment is complete, the deployment simple, and the [[runtime environment]] be treated as mission critical. The World's Only Enterprise [[Linux]] Built Specifically for Cell/B.E that minimizes the challenge of unlocking the Cell/B.E.'s potential, giving you the strongest foundation for code development and [[deployment]] with the world's leading Cell/B.E. optimization team standing behind you. ==Yellow Dog Enterprise Linux for nVIDIA CUDA== YDEL is an [[open source]], Linux [[operating system]] built for faster, easier, and more reliable [[Graphics processing unit|GPU Computing]]. YDEL goes beyond the basic Linux OS and integrates GPU robustness and developmental tools. Developers, end users, and integrators will have the support of the biggest team of experts with over a decade of Linux and multicore development experience. YDEL dependability empowers your team to focus on your productivity and projects instead of administering Linux. YDEL for [[CUDA]] is the first enterprise Linux operating system built for faster, easier, and more reliable GPU Computing. YDEL goes beyond the basic Linux OS and integrates GPU robustness and developmental tools. Developers, [[end user]]s, and integrators will have the support of the biggest team of experts with over a decade of Linux and multicore development experience.

It focuses on GPU systems and computers using the [[Power Architecture]] (Power7). YDL is currently developed by [[Fixstars Solutions|Fixstars]] (which acquired Terra Soft Solutions in October 2008). Yellow Dog Linux was first released in the spring of 1999 for the Apple Macintosh PowerPC-based computers. The most recent version, Yellow Dog Enterprise Linux for [[CUDA]], was released on March 2, 2010. It claims to be the first enterprise Linux OS optimized for GPU computing offering end users, developers and integrators a faster, more reliable, and less complex GPU computing experience.<ref name="pressrelease">[http://www.fixstars.com/en/company/press/20100302.html; Yellow Dog Enterprise Linux for CUDA Offers Lower Cost or Ownership, Better GPU performance with integrated Eclipse plug-i, Greater Integration and Reliability, Comprehensive support for both Linux and CUDA and Flexibility by supporting several versions of CUDA;] Fixstars press release, March 2, 2010.</ref> ==Features== [[Image:Yellow Dog Linux.png|thumb|320px|Screenshot of Yellow Dog Linux Version 6.0 &lsquo;Pyxis&rsquo; depicting [[Enlightenment (window manager)|Enlightenment]], the default window manager.]] Yellow Dog Linux is based on [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]]/[[CentOS]] and relies on the [[RPM Package Manager|RPM]] package manager. Its software includes user applications such as [[Ekiga]] (a [[Voice over Internet Protocol|voice-over-IP]] and [[videoconferencing]] application), [[GIMP]] (a raster graphics editor), [[Gnash]] (a free [[Adobe Flash]] player), [[gThumb]] (an image viewer), the [[Mozilla Firefox]] Web browser, the [[Mozilla Thunderbird]] e-mail and news client, the [[OpenOffice.org]] productivity suite, [[Pidgin (software)|Pidgin]] (an instant messaging and [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] client), the [[Rhythmbox]] music player, and the [[Noatun (media player)|Noatun]] and [[Totem (media player)|Totem]] media players. Since YDL version 5.0 ‘Phoenix,’ [[Enlightenment (window manager)|Enlightenment]] has been the default desktop environment in Yellow Dog Linux, although [[GNOME]] and [[KDE]] are also included. Like other Linux distributions, Yellow Dog Linux supports software development with [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] (compiled with support for [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], and [[Fortran]]), the [[GNU C Library]], [[GNU Debugger|GDB]], [[GLib]], the [[GTK+]] toolkit, [[Python (programming language)|Python]], the [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]] toolkit, [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] and [[Tcl]]. Standard text editors such as [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] and [[Emacs]] are complemented with [[integrated development environment|IDEs]] such as [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] and [[KDevelop]], as well as by graphical debuggers such as [[KDbg]]. Standard document preparation tools such as [[TeX]] and [[LaTeX]] are also included. Yellow Dog Linux includes software suitable for running a Web server (such as [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache/httpd]], [[Perl]], and [[PHP]]), database server (such as [[MySQL]] and [[PostgreSQL]]), and network server ([[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]] and [[Webmin]]). Additional software is also included for running an enterprise server or a compute server or cluster, although two separate products from Terra Soft Solutions, called Yellow Dog Enterprise Linux (for enterprise servers) and Y-HPC (for compute servers/clusters), are
