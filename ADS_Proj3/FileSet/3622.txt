Information is also available in Danish, Dutch, French, Italian, Polish, Spanish and Turkish. ====Germany==== *Ihr Reiseplan This is a free timetable leaflet distributed in express train and has information about the departure, arrival time of the train and also connecting services. For many years the “Kursbuch Gesamtausgabe” ("complete timetable"), a very thick timetable book was published but its contents are now available on the [[Deutsche Bahn]] website<ref>http://reiseauskunft.bahn.de/bin/query.exe/d</ref> and CD ROM. ====Italy==== *Pozzorario generale It is a handy timetable book and covers most trains in Italy. ====Switzerland==== *Offizielles Kursbuch Schweiz/Indicateur Officiel de la Suisse A large annual publication consisting of railway, bus, ferry and [[aerial tramway]] (cablecar) timetables. ====United Kingdom==== *GB Rail Timetable This is a timetable published by [[The Stationery Office]] (the official UK Government publishers), and contains information published, according to its title page, "with permission of [[Network Rail]] and obtained under licence from ATOC" (the [[Association of Train Operating Companies]]). It closely resembles Network Rail's former timetable book which ceased publication in 2007. Network Rail currently provides PDF timetable files on its website.<ref>http://www.networkrail.co.uk/aspx/3828.aspx</ref><br> The GB Rail Timetable appears twice per year: *In May titled '''GB Rail Timetable Summer Edition''' lasting from May to December - Also includes Autumn schedules *In December titled '''GB Rail Timetable Winter Edition''' lasting from December to May - Also includes Spring schedules ====Netherlands==== =====Train===== The timetable book ''Spoorboekje'' is published yearly in December, and costs €5,50. It covers all operators of [[rail transport in the Netherlands]], except those of [[heritage railway]]s; it gives the departure times (and sometimes arrival times), but not the tracks. For international trains to and from the Netherlands, for the data for the parts abroad only a summary is given. It provides ''tables with services in columns'' (see above), arranged by [[Train_routes_in_the_Netherlands#Train_routes_by_timetable_number|timetable number]] and direction (''a'' and ''b''). A [[Train routes in the Netherlands|train route]] can involve multiple timetable numbers; in addition to providing full information (all stations and all trains) for the railway stretch belonging to the timetable number, tables often provide selected information about the continuation of trains into stretches of other timetable numbers. For train services which do not operate daily throughout the year there are indications for a few common restrictions such as "weekdays only" and "not on Sundays", and footnotes for other limitations. =====Bus===== Timetable booklets are published yearly. They come with a separate map, and cost money. Each covers one region of one bus company. They are arranged similarly to the ''spoorboekje'', except that for each line and direction there are three separate tables: for Monday-Friday, for Saturday, and for Sunday. Also, they show the times for selected stops only. In addition or instead, leaflets or smaller booklets with the timetable of a single line or a few lines are available free of charge. ===Recent trends=== Due to the development of the internet and electronic memory systems, conventional thick paper timetables are gradually being replaced by website searching or CD-ROM style timetables and the publishing of comprehensive printed timetables is generally decreasing. France's [[SNCF]], for example, publishes timetables only for the [[RER]] and [[Transilien]] [[commuter rail]] services that operate in the outskirts of [[Paris]]; the rest of the timetables must be accessed indirectly by means of a search engine. == Formats == Timetables are published as books, booklets, folded or plain cards or [[paper]], [[poster]]s, on-line in [[HTML]], [[Portable Document Format|pdf]], and other formats, printed, hand-written on posters or [[chalkboard|blackboard]]s, back-lit displays, and [[Short Message Service|SMS]] messages.<ref>For an example of an SMS timetable, see [http://www.metlinkmelbourne.com.au/using_public_transport/sms_services Connex Melbourne's SMS timetable service]</ref> [[Thomas Cook Group|Thomas Cook Publishing]] has published timetable books showing the schedules of major European railway services since 1873 (appearing monthly since 1883) and also produces a similar bi-monthly volume covering [[public transport]] services in the rest of the world.<ref>According to the [http://www.thomascookpublishing.com/series.htm?series=Timetables Thomas Cook web-site] (retrieved 6 March 2007)</ref> == On-time performance== On-time performance is the proportion of the time that a transit system adheres to its published schedule times within state tolerances. ==References== {{reflist}} '''Paper timetables''' of a lot of countries are available at the Timetable Distribution Center at St.Gallen Railway Station (Switzerland) www.timetables.ch == See also == * [[Public transport bus service]] {{Commons category|Public transport schedules}} {{Public transport}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Public Transport Timetable}} [[Category:Public transport information systems]] [[Category:Transportation planning]] [[cs:Jízdní řád]] [[de:Fahrplan]] [[it:Orario ferroviario]] [[nl:Dienstregeling]] [[ja:時刻表]] [[pl:Rozkład jazdy]] [[ru:Расписание]] [[sk:Cestovný poriadok]] [[sl:Vozni red]] [[fi:Aikataulu]] [[sv:Tidtabell]] [[zh:公共交通时刻表]]</text> </page> <page> <id>30527</id> <title>Pulse-Doppler radar</title> <text>{{no footnotes|date=July 2009}} '''Pulse-Doppler''' is a [[radar]] system capable of not only detecting target location (bearing, range, and altitude), but also measuring its radial velocity (range-rate). It uses the [[Doppler effect]] to determine the relative velocity of objects; pulses of RF energy returning from the target are processed to measure the frequency shift between carrier cycles in each pulse and the original transmitted frequency. To achieve this, the transmitter frequency source must have very good phase stability and the system is said to be coherent. The nature of pulsed radar, and the relationship between the carrier frequency and the [[pulse repetition frequency]] (PRF) means that the [[Radar Signal Characteristics#The radar signal in the frequency domain|frequency spectrum]] can be very complex, leading to the possibility of errors and tradeoffs. In general, it is necessary to utilise a very high PRF to avoid [[aliasing]], which can cause side effects such as [[Radar Signal Characteristics#Unambiguous range|range ambiguity]]. To avoid this, multiple PRFs are often used. == Underlying principle == Pulse-Doppler radar is based on the fact that targets moving with a nonzero radial velocity will introduce a frequency shift between the transmitter master [[oscillator]] and the carrier component in the returned echoes. This is because the signal is subject to Doppler shift, so echoes from closing targets (moving toward the transmitter) will show an apparent increase in frequency and echoes from opening targets (moving away) will show an apparent decrease in frequency. Target velocity can be estimated by determining the average frequency shift of carrier cycles within a pulse packet. This is typically done by means
