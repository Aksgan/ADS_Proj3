Although the [[Starships in Stargate#City ship|city ship]] weighs several million tons, it is buoyant enough to float on water and, given that its energy shield can hold the atmosphere inside nearly indefinitely, it should be able to float in a particularly dense atmosphere. *The Nox of ''[[Stargate SG1]]'' have floating cities. *[[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s films ''[[Castle in the Sky]]'' and ''[[Howl's Moving Castle (film)|Howl's Moving Castle]]'' both involve floating structures similar to a floating city. ===Games=== *City in the Sky, the seventh dungeon level of ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess]]''. *SkyTown is a floating city on planet Elysia in ''[[Metroid Prime 3: Corruption]]'' from the ''[[Metroid (series)|Metroid]]'' video game series. *New Pork City, the last stage in the 2006 videogame ''[[Mother 3]]''. *There are several floating cities in the games [[Skies of Arcadia]] for the [[Dreamcast]] and [[Skies of Arcadia Legends]] for the [[Nintendo GameCube]]. *In ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', Dalaran is a major city that floats above Crystalsong Forest in the center of Northrend. *The setting of the ''[[Eclipse Phase (role-playing game)|Eclipse Phase]]'' role-playing game includes floating cities on Venus and Saturn. *[[Columbia (BioShock)|Columbia]], the setting for the game ''[[BioShock Infinite]]''. ==See also== *[[Colonization of Venus]] *[[Walking city]] ==References== {{reflist}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Floating City (Science Fiction)}} [[Category:Space colonization]] [[Category:Science fiction themes]] [[Category:Buckminster Fuller]] {{Science fiction}} [[bs:Plutajući gradovi (naučna fantastika)]] [[ja:フローティングシティ]]</text> </page> <page> <id>13806</id> <title>FlockDB</title> <text>{{Infobox software | name = FlockDB | logo = | screenshot = | caption = A distributed, fault-tolerant graph database. | collapsible = | author = Nick Kallen, Robey Pointer, John Kalucki and Ed Ceaser from [[Twitter]] | developer = [[Twitter]] | released = {{Start date|April 2010}} | latest release version = | latest release date = | latest preview version = | latest preview date = | frequently updated = | programming language = Scala, Java, Ruby | operating system = | platform = | size = | language = | status = Active | genre = [[Database]] | license = [[Apache License]] | website = http://github.com/twitter/flockdb }} '''FlockDB''' is an [[open source]] distributed, [[fault-tolerant]] [[graph database]] for managing data at webscale.<ref>http://gigaom.com/2010/04/12/twitter-open-sources-the-home-of-its-social-graph/</ref> It was initially used by [[Twitter]] to build its [[database]] of users and manage their relationships to one another.

The main theorem of Floquet theory, '''Floquet's theorem''', due to {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Gaston Floquet|first=Gaston |last=Floquet|year=1883}}, gives a [[canonical form]] for each [[Fundamental solution|fundamental matrix solution]] of this common [[linear system]]. It gives a [[Change of coordinates|coordinate change]] <math>\displaystyle y=Q^{-1}(t)x</math> with <math>\displaystyle Q(t+2T)=Q(t)</math> that transforms the periodic system to a traditional linear system with constant, real [[coefficients]]. In [[solid-state physics]], the analogous result (generalized to three dimensions) is known as [[Bloch wave|Bloch's theorem]]. Note that the solutions of the linear differential equation form a vector space. A matrix <math>\phi(t)</math> is called a fundamental matrix solution if all columns are linearly independent solutions. A matrix <math>\Phi(t)</math> is called a principal fundamental matrix solution if all columns are linearly independent solutions and there exists <math>t_0</math> such that <math>\Phi(t_0)</math> is the identity. A principal fundamental matrix can be constructed from a fundamental matrix using <math>\Phi(t)=\phi(t)\phi^{-1}(t_0)</math>. The solution of the linear differential equation with the initial condition <math>x(0)=x_0</math> is <math>x(t)=\phi(t)\phi^{-1}(0)x_0</math> where <math>\phi(t)</math> is any fundamental matrix solution. == Floquet's theorem == <!-- [[Floquet theorem]] redirects to this section --> Let <math>\dot{x}= A(t) x</math> be a linear first order differential equation, where <math>x(t)</math> is a column vector of length <math>n</math> and <math>A(t)</math> an <math>n \times n</math> periodic matrix with period <math>T</math> (that is <math>A(t + T) = A(t)</math> for all real values of <math>t</math>). Let <math>\phi (t) </math> be a fundamental matrix solution of this differential equation. Then, for all <math>t \in \mathbb{R}</math>, :<math> \phi(t+T)=\phi(t) \phi^{-1}(0) \phi (T).\ </math> In addition, for each matrix <math>B</math> (possibly complex) such that :<math>e^{TB}=\phi^{-1}(0) \phi (T),\ </math> there is a periodic (period <math>T</math>) matrix function <math>t \mapsto P(t)</math> such that :<math>\phi (t) = P(t)e^{tB}\text{ for all }t \in \mathbb{R}.\ </math> Also, there is a ''real'' matrix <math>R</math> and a ''real'' periodic (period-<math>2T</math>) matrix function <math>t \mapsto Q(t)</math> such that :<math>\phi (t) = Q(t)e^{tR}\text{ for all }t \in \mathbb{R}.\ </math> In the above <math>B</math>, <math>P</math>, <math>Q</math> and <math>R</math> are <math>n \times n</math> matrices. == Consequences and applications == This mapping <math>\phi (t) = Q(t)e^{tR}</math> gives rise to a time-dependent change of coordinates (<math> y = Q^{-1}(t) x</math>), under which our original system becomes a linear system with real constant coefficients <math>\dot{y}
