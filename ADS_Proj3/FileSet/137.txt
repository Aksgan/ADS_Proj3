to the ''n''-th [[Betti number]], so one can use the homology groups of a simplicial complex to calculate its [[Euler-Poincaré characteristic]]. As another example, the top-dimensional integral homology group of a closed [[manifold]] detects [[orientable|orientability]]: this group is isomorphic to either the integers or 0, according as the manifold is orientable or not. Thus, a great deal of topological information is encoded in the homology of a given topological space. Beyond simplicial homology, which is defined only for simplicial complexes, one can use the differential structure of smooth manifolds via [[de Rham cohomology]], or Čech or [[sheaf cohomology]] to investigate the solvability of [[differential equation]]s defined on the manifold in question. [[De Rham]] showed that all of these approaches were interrelated and that, for a closed, oriented manifold, the Betti numbers derived through simplicial homology were the same Betti numbers as those derived through de Rham cohomology. This was extended in the 1950s, when Eilenberg and Steenrod generalized this approach. They defined homology and cohomology as [[functors]] equipped with [[natural transformations]] subject to certain axioms (e.g., a [[weak equivalence]] of spaces passes to an isomorphism of homology groups), verified that all existing (co)homology theories satisfied these axioms, and then proved that such an axiomatization uniquely characterized the theory. A new approach uses a functor from filtered spaces to crossed complexes defined directly and homotopically using relative homotopy groups; a higher homotopy van Kampen theorem proved for this functor enables basic results in algebraic topology, especially on the border between homology and homotopy, to be obtained without using [[singular homology]] or [[simplicial approximation]]. This approach is also called [[higher dimensional algebra|nonabelian algebraic topology]], and generalises to higher dimensions ideas coming from the fundamental group. ==Applications of algebraic topology== Classic applications of algebraic topology include: * The [[Brouwer fixed point theorem]]: every [[continuous function|continuous]] map from the unit ''n''-disk to itself has a fixed point. * The ''n''-sphere admits a nowhere-vanishing continuous unit [[vector fields on spheres|vector field]] if and only if ''n'' is odd. (For ''n'' = 2, this is sometimes called the "[[hairy ball theorem]]".) * The [[Borsuk–Ulam theorem]]: any continuous map from the ''n''-sphere to Euclidean ''n''-space identifies at least one pair of antipodal points. * Any subgroup of a [[free group]] is free. This result is quite interesting, because the statement is purely algebraic yet the simplest proof is topological. Namely, any free group ''G'' may be realized as the fundamental group of a [[graph (mathematics)|graph]] ''X''. The main theorem on [[covering space]]s tells us that every subgroup ''H'' of ''G'' is the fundamental group of some covering space ''Y'' of ''X''; but every such ''Y'' is again a graph. Therefore its fundamental group ''H'' is free. On the other hand this type of application is also handled by the use of covering morphisms of [[groupoids]], and that technique has yielded subgroup theorems not yet proved by methods of algebraic topology (see the book by Higgins listed under groupoids). * [[Topological combinatorics]] ==Notable algebraic topologists== <div style="-moz-column-count:3; column-count:3;"> *[[Frank Adams]] *[[Karol Borsuk]] *[[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer]] *[[William Browder (mathematician)|William Browder]] *[[Ronald Brown (mathematician)]] *[[Nicolas Bourbaki]] *[[Henri Cartan]] *[[Hermann Künneth]] *[[Samuel Eilenberg]] *[[Hans Freudenthal]] *[[Peter Freyd]] *[[Alexander Grothendieck]] *[[Friedrich Hirzebruch]] *[[Heinz Hopf]] *[[Michael J.
