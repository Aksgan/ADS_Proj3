then key clustering has occurred. ==Importance== If an 'attacker' tries to break a cipher by [[brute-force]] (trying all possible keys until it finds the correct key) then key clustering will result in an easier attack on a particular cipher text. If there are N possible keys with out any key clustering then the attacker will on average need to try N/2 keys to decrypt it and a worst case of trying all N keys. If there are two keys that are clustered then the average number of keys to try is reduced to N/4 (worst case is N-1 keys). If three keys cluster than average attempt is only N/6 attempts. ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Key management]] {{crypto-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>20597</id> <title>Key disclosure law</title> <text>'''Key disclosure laws''', also known as '''mandatory key disclosure''', is legislation that require individuals to surrender [[key (cryptography)|cryptographic key]]s to law enforcement. The purpose is to allow access to material for confiscation or [[digital forensics]] purposes and use it either as evidence in a court of law or to enforce [[national security]] interests. Similarly, '''mandatory decryption''' laws force owners of encrypted data to supply decrypted data to law enforcement. Nations vary widely in the specifics of how they implement key disclosure laws. Some, such as Australia, give law enforcement wide-ranging power to compel assistance in decrypting data from any party. Some, such as Belgium, concerned with self-incrimination, only allow law enforcement to compel assistance from non-suspects. Some require only specific third parties such as telecommunications carriers, certification providers, or maintainers of encryption services to provide assistance with decryption. In all cases, a warrant is generally required. == Theory and countermeasures == Mandatory decryption is technically a weaker requirement than key disclosure, since it is possible in some cryptosystems to prove that a message has been decrypted correctly without revealing the key. For example, using [[RSA]] public-key encryption, one can verify given the message (plaintext), the encrypted message (ciphertext), and the public key of the recipient that the message is correct by merely re-encrypting it and comparing the result to the encrypted message. Such a scheme is called ''undeniable'', since once the government has validated the message they cannot deny that it is the correct decrypted message.<ref name="desmedt">Desmedt, Yvo and Burmester, Mike and Seberry, Jennifer.

A problematic aspect of key disclosure is that it leads to a total compromise of all data encrypted using that key in the past or future; time-limited encryption schemes such as those of Desmedt et al.<ref name="desmedt" /> allow decryption only for a limited time period. == Criticism and alternatives == Critics of key disclosure laws view them as compromising [[information privacy]], by revealing personal information that may not be pertinent to the crime under investigation, as well as violating the right against [[self-incrimination]] and more generally the [[right to silence]], in nations which respect these rights. In some cases, it may be impossible to decrypt the data because the key has been lost, revoked, or because the data is actually random data which cannot be effectively distinguished from encrypted data. A proactive alternative to key disclosure law is [[key escrow]] law, where the government holds in escrow a copy of all cryptographic keys in use, but is only permitted to use them if an appropriate warrant is issued. Key escrow systems face difficult technical issues and are subject to many of the same criticisms as key disclosure law; they avoid some issues like lost keys, while introducing new issues such as the risk of accidental disclosure of large numbers of keys. The ambiguous term ''key recovery'' is applied to both types of systems. == Legislation by nation == === Antigua and Barbuda === The Computer Misuse Bill, 2006, Article 21(5)(c), if enacted, would allow police with a warrant to demand and use decryption keys. Failure to comply may incur "a fine of fifteen thousand [East Caribbean] dollars" and/or "imprisonment for two years."<ref>[http://www.laws.gov.ag/bills/2006/computer-misuse-bill-2006.pdf Antigua and Barbuda: The Computer Misuse Bill, 2006]</ref> === Australia === The Cybercrime Act 2001 No. 161, Items 12 and 28 grant police with a magistrate's order the wide-ranging power to require "a specified person to provide any information or assistance that is reasonable and necessary to allow the officer to" access computer data that is "evidential material"; this is understood to include mandatory decryption. Failing to comply carries a penalty of 6 months imprisonment.
