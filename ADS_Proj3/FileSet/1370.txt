The concept is especially relevant in [[evolutionary game theory]], where the different methods of equilibrium selection respond to different ideas of what equilibria will be stable and persistent for one player to play even in the face of deviations (and mutations) of the other players. This is important because there are various [[equilibrium concept]]s, and for many particular concepts, such as the [[Nash equilibrium]], many games have multiple equilibria. == Examples of equilibrium selection concepts == * [[Risk dominance]] * [[Payoff dominance]] * 1/2 dominance == References == * Harsany, John C. and Selten, Reinhard, ''A General Theory of Equilibrium Selection in Games'', MIT Press (1988) {{Game theory}} {{Gametheory-stub}} [[Category:Game theory]]</text> </page> <page> <id>12397</id> <title>Ergodic theory</title> <text>'''Ergodic theory''' is a branch of [[mathematics]] that studies [[dynamical system]]s with an [[invariant measure]] and related problems. Its initial development was motivated by problems of [[statistical physics]]. A central aspect of ergodic theory is the behavior of a dynamical system when it is allowed to run for a long time. The first result in this direction is the [[Poincaré recurrence theorem]], which claims that almost all points in any subset of the [[phase space]] eventually revisit the set. More precise information is provided by various '''ergodic theorems''' which assert that, under certain conditions, the time average of a function along the trajectories exists [[almost everywhere]] and is related to the space average. Two of the most important examples are ergodic theorems of [[George David Birkhoff|Birkhoff]] and [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]]. For the special class of '''ergodic systems''', the time average is the same for almost all initial points: statistically speaking, the system that evolves for a long time "forgets" its initial state. Stronger properties, such as [[mixing (mathematics)|mixing]] and [[equidistribution]], have also been extensively studied. The problem of metric classification of systems is another important part of the abstract ergodic theory. An outstanding role in ergodic theory and its applications to [[stochastic process]]es is played by the various notions of [[measure-theoretic entropy|entropy]] for dynamical systems. Applications of ergodic theory to other parts of mathematics usually involve establishing ergodicity properties for systems of special kind. In [[geometry]], methods of ergodic theory have been used to study the [[geodesic flow]] on [[Riemannian manifold]]s, starting with the results of [[Eberhard Hopf]] for [[Riemann surface]]s of negative curvature. [[Markov chain]]s form a common context for applications in [[probability theory]]. Ergodic theory has fruitful connections with [[harmonic analysis]], [[Lie theory]] ([[representation theory]], [[lattice (discrete subgroup)|lattices]] in [[algebraic group]]s), and [[number theory]] (the theory of [[diophantine approximation]]s, [[L-function]]s). ==Ergodic transformations== {{Main| Ergodicity}} Ergodic theory is often concerned with '''ergodic transformations'''. Let ''T'': ''X'' → ''X'' be a [[measure-preserving transformation]] on a [[measure space]] (''X'', ''Σ'', ''μ''), usually assumed to have finite measure. A measure-preserving transformation ''T'' as above is '''ergodic''' if for every <math> E \in \Sigma</math> with <math>T^{-1}(E)=E\,</math> either <math>\mu(E)=0\,</math> or <math>\mu(E)=1\,</math>. ==Examples== * An [[irrational rotation]] of the [[circle group|circle]] '''R'''/'''Z''', ''T'': ''x'' → ''x''+''θ'', where ''θ'' is [[irrational number|irrational]], is ergodic. This transformation has even stronger properties of [[unique ergodicity]], [[minimal dynamical system|minimality]], and [[equidistribution]]. By contrast, if ''θ'' = ''p''/''q'' is rational (in lowest terms) then ''T'' is periodic, with period ''q'',<!--- No article to link to! ---> and thus cannot be ergodic: for any interval ''I'' of length ''a'', 0 < ''a'' < 1/''q'', its orbit under ''T'' is a ''T''-invariant mod 0 set that is a union of ''q'' intervals of length ''a'', hence it has measure ''qa'' strictly between 0 and 1. * Let ''G'' be a [[Compact group|compact]] [[abelian group]], ''μ'' the normalized [[Haar measure]], and ''T'' a [[group automorphism]] of ''G''. Let ''G''<sup>*</sup> be the [[Pontryagin dual]] group, consisting of the continuous [[character (mathematics)|characters]] of ''G'', and ''T''<sup>*</sup> be the corresponding adjoint automorphism of ''G''<sup>*</sup>. The automorphism ''T'' is ergodic if and only if the equality (''T''<sup>*</sup>)<sup>''n''</sup>(''χ'')=''χ'' is possible only when ''n'' = 0 or ''χ'' is the [[trivial character]] of ''G''. In particular, if ''G'' is the ''n''-dimensional [[torus group|torus]] and the automorphism ''T'' is represented by an [[integer|integral]] [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] ''A'' then ''T'' is ergodic if and only if no [[eigenvalue]] of ''A'' is a [[root of unity]]. * A [[Bernoulli shift]] is ergodic. More generally, ergodicity of the shift transformation associated with a sequence of [[i.i.d. random variables]] and some more general [[stationary process]]es follows from [[Kolmogorov's zero-one law]]. * Ergodicity of a [[continuous dynamical system]] means that its trajectories "spread around" the [[phase space]]. A system with a compact phase space which has a non-constant first integral cannot be ergodic. This applies, in particular, to [[Hamiltonian system]]s with a first integral ''I'' functionally independent from the Hamilton function ''H'' and a compact level set ''X'' = {(''p'',''q''): ''H''(''p'',''q'')=E} of constant energy. [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's theorem]] implies the existence of a finite invariant measure on ''X'', but the dynamics of the system is constrained to the level sets of ''I'' on ''X'', hence the system possesses invariant sets of positive but less than full measure. A property of continuous dynamical systems that is the opposite of ergodicity is [[Integrable system|complete integrability]]. ==Ergodic theorems== Let <math>T:X\to X</math> be a [[measure-preserving transformation]] on a [[measure space]] <math>(X,\Sigma,\mu)</math>. One may then consider the "time average" of a <math>\mu</math>-integrable function ''f'', i.e. <math>f\in L^1(\mu)</math>. The "time average" is defined as the average (if it exists) over iterations of ''T'' starting from some initial point ''x''. :<math> \hat f(x) = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\; \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} f\left(T^k x\right).</math> If <math>\mu(X)</math> is finite and nonzero, we can consider the "space average" or "phase average" of ''f'', defined as :<math> \bar f =\frac 1{\mu(X)} \int f\,d\mu.\quad\text{ (For a
