This is based on the work of Stephen Katsinas, Vincent Lacey, and David Hardy at the [[University of Alabama]] and is an update of work funded in the 1990s by the [[Ford Foundation]]. # Categorizes doctorate-granting institutions according to their level of research activity. This level is calculated using multiple measures, financial and otherwise. # Simplifies the measurement of doctorate degrees awarded. # Divides Master’s colleges and universities into three categories based on the number of [[Master's degrees]] awarded. # Deprecates "[[Liberal Arts]]" terminology. # Modified the criteria separating Master's and Baccalaureate institutions. Institutions formerly classified as Master’s Colleges and Universities are now classified as Baccalaureate Colleges. # Requires institutions to have higher levels of single-field or related-field concentration for designation as special-focus institutions and utilizes more sources of information to identify special-focus institutions. # Splits the "Schools of engineering and technology" category into two categories and eliminates the "Teacher’s colleges" category. # Measures and classifies service academies using to the same criteria as other institutions. ==Previous editions== Prior to the 2000 edition, the Carnegie Foundation categorized doctorate-granting institutions according to the amount of [[Federal Government of the United States|Federal]] funding they received. The 2005 edition categorizes doctoral-institutions according to their research support but uses a more complex formula than used in previous editions. Despite the fact that it is no longer used by the Carnegie Foundation, the descriptor ''[[Research I university|Research I]]'' is still commonly used in reference to universities with the largest research budgets, often by the institutions themselves in their promotional materials.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} ==External links== * [http://classifications.carnegiefoundation.org/ Carnegie Classification Web site] ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Academia]] [[Category:Classification systems]] [[Category:Higher education in the United States]]</text> </page> <page> <id>5527</id> <title>Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science</title> <text>The '''School of Computer Science''' (SCS) at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States|USA]] is a leading private school for [[computer science]] established in 1965.

Perlis]], as well as the faculty from the Graduate School of Industrial Administration (now called the Tepper School of Business), staff from the newly formed Computation Center, and key administrators created The Department of Computer Science, one of the first such departments in the nation. Their mission statement was "to cultivate a course of study leading to the [[Ph.D.]] degree in [[computer science]], a program that would exploit the new technology and assist in establishing a discipline of [[computer science]]." The educational program, formally accepted in October 1965, drew its first graduate students from several existing academic disciplines: [[mathematics]], [[electrical engineering]], [[psychology]], and the interdisciplinary Systems and Communications Sciences program in the [[Tepper School of Business|Graduate School of Industrial Administration]]. The department was housed within the [[Mellon College of Science]]. With support from Newell, Simon, [[A. Nico Habermann|Nico Haberman]], Provost [[Angel Jordan]] and President [[Richard Cyert]], the department of computer science began a two-year status as a "floating" department in the early months of 1986. Then, the Department began to grow, both academically and financially. In 1988, the Department was officially elevated to the status of a School of Computer Science, among the first such schools in the country. ==Structure in the 1980s== During the 1980s, the department offered only a Ph.D. study program, with no master's degree as an intermediate step. The Ph.D. program required a minimum of six years of residency. It was called the "do or die" program among the graduate students, because a student could not drop a Ph.D. and receive a master's degree. It had quickly focused on computer networking, operating systems ([[Mach kernel|Mach]]), and [[robotics]]. ==SCS today== ===Organizational units=== * Computer Science Department (CSD) * [[Robotics Institute]] (RI) * [[Carnegie Mellon Institute for Software Research International|Institute for Software Research International]] (ISRI) * [[Carnegie Mellon Human Computer Interaction Institute|Human-Computer Interaction Institute]] (HCII) * [[Language Technologies Institute]] (LTI) * [[Machine Learning Department]] (MLD) * [[Entertainment Technology Center]] (ETC) * [[Ray and Stephanie Lane Center for Computational Biology]] ===Doctoral programs=== * [http://www.cos.cs.cmu.edu/ Ph.D. in Computation, Organizations and Society (COS)] * Ph.D. in Computer Science * Ph.D. in Computer Science/Dual Degree Portugal * Ph.D. in Computer Science/Neural Basis of Cognition
