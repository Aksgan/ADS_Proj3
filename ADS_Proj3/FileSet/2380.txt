Karl's father Simon Siegmund Carl Popper was a lawyer from [[Bohemia]], and mother Jenny Schiff was of [[Silesians|Silesian]] and [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] descent. After establishing themselves in Vienna, the Poppers made a rapid social climb in Viennese society: Simon Siegmund Carl became a legal partner of Vienna's liberal mayor Raimond Grübl and, after his death in 1898, took over the firm (Karl received his middle name from the mayor).<ref name=TheFormativeYears>Malachi Haim Hacohen.
