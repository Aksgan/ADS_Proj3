scanners, and can be reconstructed in a similar way. However, the statistics of the data are much worse than those obtained through transmission tomography. A normal PET data set has millions of counts for the whole acquisition, while the CT can reach a few billion counts. As such, PET data suffer from scatter and random events much more dramatically than CT data does. In practice, considerable pre-processing of the data is required - correction for random coincidences, estimation and subtraction of [[compton scatter|scattered]] photons, detector dead-time correction (after the detection of a photon, the detector must "cool down" again) and detector-sensitivity correction (for both inherent detector sensitivity and changes in sensitivity due to angle of incidence). [[Filtered back projection]] (FBP) has been frequently used to reconstruct images from the projections. This algorithm has the advantage of being simple while having a low requirement for computing resources. However, [[shot noise]] in the raw data is prominent in the reconstructed images and areas of high tracer uptake tend to form streaks across the image. Also, FBP treats the data deterministically - it does not account for the inherent randomness associated with PET data, thus requiring all the pre-reconstruction corrections described above. Iterative [[expectation-maximization algorithm]]s are now the preferred method of reconstruction. These algorithms compute an estimate of the likely distribution of annihilation events that led to the measured data, based on statistical principles. The advantage is a better noise profile and resistance to the streak artifacts common with FBP, but the disadvantage is higher computer resource requirements. '''Attenuation correction''': As different LORs must traverse different thicknesses of tissue, the [[photon]]s are attenuated differentially. The result is that structures deep in the body are reconstructed as having falsely low tracer uptake. Contemporary scanners can estimate attenuation using integrated [[x-ray]] CT equipment, however earlier equipment offered a crude form of CT using a [[gamma ray]] ([[positron]] emitting) source and the PET detectors. While attenuation-corrected images are generally more faithful representations, the correction process is itself susceptible to significant artifacts. As a result, both corrected and uncorrected images are always reconstructed and read together. '''2D/3D reconstruction''': Early PET scanners had only a single ring of detectors, hence the acquisition of data and subsequent reconstruction was restricted to a single transverse plane. More modern scanners now include multiple rings, essentially forming a cylinder of detectors. There are two approaches to reconstructing data from such a scanner: 1) treat each ring as a separate entity, so that only coincidences within a ring are detected, the image from each ring can then be reconstructed individually (2D reconstruction), or 2) allow coincidences to be detected between rings as well as within rings, then reconstruct the entire volume together (3D). 3D techniques have better sensitivity (because they were made by Dave more coincidences are detected and used) and therefore less noise, but are more sensitive to the effects of scatter and random coincidences, as well as requiring correspondingly greater computer resources. The advent of sub-nanosecond timing resolution detectors affords better random coincidence rejection, thus favoring 3D image reconstruction. == Applications == [[Image:PET-MIPS-anim.gif|thumb|right|[[Maximum intensity projection]] (MIP) of a F-18 FDG wholebody PET acquisition; liver metastases of a colorectal tumor are clearly visible within the abdominal region of the image. Normal physiological isotope uptake is seen in the brain, renal collection systems and bladder. In this animation, it is important to view the subject as [[The Spinning Dancer|rotating clockwise]] (note liver position).]] PET is both a medical and research tool. It is used heavily in clinical [[oncology]] ([[radiology|medical imaging]] of [[tumor]]s and the search for [[metastasis|metastases]]), and for clinical diagnosis of certain diffuse brain diseases such as those causing various types of dementias. PET is also an important research tool to map normal human brain and heart function. PET is also used in pre-clinical studies using animals, where it allows repeated investigations into the same subjects. This is particularly valuable in cancer research, as it results in an increase in the statistical quality of the data (subjects can act as their own control) and substantially reduces the numbers of animals required for a given study. Alternative methods of scanning include [[x-ray]] [[computed tomography]] (CT), [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[ultrasound]] and [[single photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT). While some imaging scans such as CT and MRI isolate organic anatomic changes in the body, PET and SPECT are capable of detecting areas of [[molecular biology]] detail (even prior to anatomic change). PET scanning does this using radiolabelled molecular probes that have different rates of uptake depending on the type and function of tissue involved. Changing of regional blood flow in various anatomic structures (as a measure of the injected positron emitter) can be visualized and relatively quantified with a PET scan. PET imaging is best performed using a dedicated PET scanner. However, it is possible to acquire PET images using a conventional dual-head [[gamma camera]] fitted with a coincidence detector. The quality of gamma-camera PET is considerably lower, and acquisition is slower. However, for institutions with low demand for PET, this may allow on-site imaging, instead of referring patients to another center, or relying on a visit by a mobile scanner. PET is a valuable technique for some diseases and disorders, because it is possible to target the radio-chemicals used for particular bodily functions. # [[Oncology]]: PET scanning with the tracer [[fluorine-18]] (F-18) [[fluorodeoxyglucose]] (FDG), called FDG-PET, is widely used in clinical [[oncology]]. This tracer is a [[glucose]] [[analog (chemistry)|analog]] that is taken up by glucose-using cells and phosphorylated by [[hexokinase]] (whose [[mitochondrial]] form is greatly elevated in rapidly growing [[malignant]] tumours). A typical dose of FDG used in an oncological scan is 200-400 M[[Becquerel|Bq]] for an adult human. Because the [[oxygen]] atom which is replaced by F-18 to generate FDG is required for the next step in glucose [[metabolism]] in all cells, no further reactions occur in FDG. Furthermore, most tissues (with the notable exception of liver and kidneys) cannot remove the [[phosphate]] added by [[hexokinase]]. This
