a 'shifter', is a sign which contains both referential and indexical meaning. So for example, the word 'I', as in :I went to the store. is a referential indexical. It has referential content, in that it refers to the singular first person, and indexical content, in that its meaning depends on who uttered the word.<ref name=shifters/> ==Indexical presupposition and performativity== Indexical sign types are defined by rules of use that state that there exists a relationship between mutually implied existence of sign vehicle token (i.e. ''icon'', ''index'' or ''symbol'') and certain aspects of the context of discourse. The indexical sign token presupposes the aspect of the speech situation and is referentially uninterpretable without some knowledge of context. In other words, some aspect of the context is spelled out in the rules of use, fixed and presupposed, and must be understood for the referential contribution to be made.In the use of pure indexical tokens the sign can also have a creative or performative aspect in that rather than change the context, it creates boundaries to the structure of the event. For example in the case of English indexical pronouns, I and we (as opposed to he/she/it/they) create parameters that specify the parties to whom one is referring. Indexes, both referential and non-referential, therefore exist on a sliding scale, some more presupposing, some more creative, and some containing clear aspects of both.<ref name=shifters/> ==Non-referential indexicality== Non-referential indices or "Pure" indices do not contribute to the semantico-referential value of a speech event yet "signal some particular value of one or more contextual variables."<ref name=shifters>Silverstein, Michael. "Shifters, Linguistic Categories, and Cultural Description." In Meaning in Anthropology. K. Basso and H.A. Selby, eds. Albuquerque: School of American Research, University of New Mexico Press, 1976.</ref> Non-referential indices encode certain metapragmatic elements of a speech event's context through linguistic variations. The degree of variation in non-referential indices is considerable and serves to infuse the speech event with, at times, multiple levels of [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] "meaning."<ref name=indexicalorder>Silverstein, Michael. "Indexical order and the dialectics of sociolinguistic life". Elsevier Ltd., 2003.</ref> Of particular note are: sex/gender indices, deference indices (including the affinal taboo index), [[affect]] indices, as well as the phenomena of [[phonological]] [[hypercorrection]] and social identity indexicality. ==First, second, and higher orders of non-referential indexicality== In much of the research currently conducted upon various phenomena of non-referential indexicality, there is an increased interest in not only what is called first-order indexicality, but subsequent second-order as well as "higher-order" levels of indexical meaning. First-order indexicality can be defined as the first level of pragmatic meaning that is drawn from an utterance. For example, instances of deference indexicality such as the variation between informal "Tu" and the more formal "Vous" in French (See T/V deference indexes) indicate a speaker/addressee communicative relationship built upon the values of 'power' and 'solidarity' possessed by the interlocutors.<ref name=BrownGilman>Brown, R., Gilman, A. "The pronouns of power and solidarity, IN: Sebeok, T.A. (ed.) Style in Language. Cambridge: MIT Press, 1960.</ref> When a speaker addresses somebody using the V form instead of the T form, they index (via first-order indexicality) their understanding of the need for deference to the addressee. In other words, they perceive an incongruence between their level of 'power' and/or 'solidarity', and that of their interlocutor and employ a more formal way of addressing that person to suit the contextual constraints of the speech event. Second-Order Indexicality is concerned with the connection between [[linguistics|linguistic]] variables and the metapragmatic meanings that they encode. For example, a woman is walking down the street in [[Manhattan]] and she stops to ask somebody where a McDonalds is. He responds to her talking in a heavy "[[Brooklyn]]" [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]. She notices this accent and considers a set of possible personal characteristics that might be indexed by it (such as the man's intelligence, economic situation, and other non-linguistic aspects of his life). The power of language to encode these preconceived "stereotypes" based solely on accent is an example of second-order indexicality (representative of a more complex and subtle system of indexical form than that of first-order indexicality). [[Michael Silverstein]] has also argued that indexical order can transcend levels such as second-order indexicality and discusses higher-order indexicality in terms of what he calls "oinoglossia" or "wine talk".<ref name=indexicalorder/>(For discussion see below) ==Non-referential indexical phenomena== Examples of non-referential forms of indexicality include sex/gender, affect, deference, social class, and social identity indices. Many scholars, notably Silverstein, argue that occurrences of non-referential indexicality entail not only the context-dependent variability of the speech event, but also increasingly subtle forms of indexical meaning (first, second, and higher-orders)as well.<ref name=indexicalorder/> ===Sex/gender indices=== One common system of non-referential indexicality is sex/gender indices. These indices index the gender or "female/male" social status of the interlocutor. There are a multitude of linguistic variants that act to index sex and gender such as: *''word-final or sentence-final particles'':many languages employ the [[suffix]]ation of word-final particles to index the gender of the speaker. These particles vary from phonological alterations such as the one explored by [[William Labov]] in his work on postvocalic /r/ employment in words that had no word final "r" (which is claimed, among other things, to index the "female" social sex status by virtue of the statistical fact that women tend to hypercorrect their speech more often than men)<ref name=wake>Wake, Naoko. Indexicality, Gender, and Social Identity.</ref>; suffixation of single phonemes, such as /-s/ in Muskogean languages of the southeastern United States<ref name=shifters/>; or particle suffixation (such as the Japanese sentence-final use of ''-wa'' with rising intonation to indicate increasing affect and, via second-order indexicality, the gender of the speaker (in this case, female))<ref name=wake/> *''morphological and phonological mechanisms'': such as in [[Yana language|Yana]], a language where one form of all major words are spoken by sociological male to sociological male , and another form (which is constructed around phonological changes in word forms) is used for all other combination of interlocutors; or the Japanese prefix-[[affixation]] of o- to indicate politeness and, consequently, feminine social identity.<ref name=o>Kamei, Takashi.Covering and Covered Forms of women's
