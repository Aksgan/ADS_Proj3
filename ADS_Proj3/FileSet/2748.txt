It superseded [[Mac OS X v10.0]] and preceded [[Mac OS X v10.2]]. Version 10.1 was released on September 25, 2001 as a 'free update' to version 10.0. Starting with version 10.1.2, Apple made Mac OS X the default operating system on new Macs.<ref name="1012def">[http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2002/jan/07macosx.html Apple Makes Mac OS X the Default Operating System on All Macs]</ref> The operating system was handed out for no charge by Apple employees after [[Steve Jobs]]' [[Stevenote|keynote]] speech at the Seybold [[publishing]] conference in [[San Francisco]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} It was subsequently distributed to Macintosh users on October 25, 2001 at [[Apple Store (retail)|Apple Stores]] and other [[retail]] stores that carried Apple products. The operating system was better received than Mac OS X version 10.0, although critics claimed that the operating system was still lacking features and was plagued with bugs. ==System requirements== *'''Supported computers''' — Power Mac G3, G4, G4 Cube, iMac G3, DV, eMac, PowerBook, or iBook<ref name="sysreq">[http://www.amazon.com/dp/system-requirements/B00005QVGV Amazon.com: Mac OS X 10.1: Software]</ref> *'''RAM required''' — 128 [[megabyte]]s<ref name="sysreq"/> (MB) (unofficially 64 MB minimum) *'''Free hard drive space''' — 1.5 [[gigabyte]]s<ref name="sysreq"/> (GB) ==Features== Apple introduced many features that were missing from the last version, as well as improving overall system performance. This system release brought some major new features to the Mac OS X platform: *'''Performance enhancements''' — Mac OS X v10.1 introduced large performance increases throughout the system. *'''Easier CD and DVD burning''' — better support in [[Macintosh Finder|Finder]] as well as [[iTunes]] *'''[[DVD Player|DVD playback support]]''' — DVDs can be played in Apple DVD Player *'''More printer support (200 printers supported out of the box)''' — One of the main complaints of version 10.0 users was the lack of printer drivers, and Apple attempted to remedy the situation by including more drivers, although many critics complained that there were still not enough. *'''Faster 3D ([[OpenGL]] performs 20% faster)''' — The OpenGL drivers, and handling were vastly improved in this version of Mac OS X, which created a large performance gap for 3D elements in the interface, and 3D applications. *'''Improved [[AppleScript]]''' — The scripting interface now allows scripting access to many more system components, such as the Printer Center, and Terminal, thus improving the customizability of the interface. As well, Apple introduced [[AppleScript Studio]], which allows a user to create full AppleScript applications in a simple graphical interface. *'''[[ColorSync|ColorSync 4.0]]''', the [[color management]] system and API. *'''[[Image Capture]]''', for acquiring images from [[digital cameras]] and [[scanners]]. ==Criticisms== Although version 10.1 was a more efficient operating system than its predecessor, it still received its share of criticism. *'''System performance''' — Although system performance in version 10.1 was greatly improved, it was still deemed 'not enough' for many to adopt Mac OS X as their main operating system.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} *'''Minor upgrade''' — While version 10.1 made some significant headway, many users criticized the step between versions 10.0 and 10.1 as not large enough. The user interface was said to have barely changed at all, and significant bugs still existed, some that caused entire system crashes.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} ===Mac OS X v10.1 as a main operating system=== Critics claimed that Mac OS X was still not fully developed in terms of reliability or functionality, and as such could not be used as a main operating system under normal conditions. They believed that Apple’s use of [[Mac OS 9]] as the default booting operating system on new computers illustrated their point. Apple switched to using Mac OS X as the default with the 10.1.2 release. ==Release history== {|class="wikitable" |- !|Version !|Build !|Date !|[[uname|OS name]] !|Notes |- ||10.1 ||5G64 ||September 25, 2001 ||[[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]] 1.4.1 ||Original ''retail'' CD-ROM release; 5L14 and 5L17b available after certain security updates |- ||10.1.1 ||5M28 ||November 12, 2001 ||Darwin 5.1 ||[http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=120080 Mac OS X Update 10.1.1: Information and Download] |- ||10.1.2 ||5P48 ||December 21, 2001 ||Darwin 5.2 ||[http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=122002 Mac OS X Update 10.1.2: Information and Download] |- ||10.1.3 ||5Q45 ||February 19, 2002 ||Darwin 5.3 ||[http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=120102 Mac OS X Update 10.1.3: Information and Download] |- ||10.1.4 ||5Q125 ||April 17, 2002 ||Darwin 5.4 ||[http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=120114 Mac OS X Update 10.1.4: Information and Download] |- ||10.1.5 ||5S60 ||June 5, 2002 ||Darwin 5.5 ||[http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=122010 Mac OS X Update 10.1.5: Information and Download]; 5S66 after networking update |- |} ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== * [http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/macosx-10.1.ars Mac OS X v10.1 review] at [[Ars Technica]] {{Mac OS History}} {{Mac OS X}} [[Category:2001 software]] [[Category:Mac OS X]] [[Category:PowerPC operating systems]] [[Category:Discontinued operating systems]] [[bs:Mac OS X/10.1]] [[ca:Mac OS X 10.1]] [[de:Mac OS X v10.1]] [[es:Mac OS X v10.1]] [[fr:Mac OS X v10.1]] [[it:Mac OS X 10.1 Puma]] [[ml:മാക് ഒ.എസ്. ടെൻ പ്യൂമ]] [[mr:मॅक ओएस एक्स पुमा]] [[nl:Mac OS X 10.1]] [[ja:Mac OS X v10.1]] [[no:Mac OS X v10.1]] [[pl:Mac OS X 10.1]] [[pt:Mac OS X v10.1]] [[ro:Mac OS X v10.1]] [[ru:Mac OS X 10.1]] [[sh:Mac OS X/10.1]] [[fi:Mac OS X v10.1]] [[sv:Mac OS X v10.1]] [[zh:Mac OS X v10.1]]</text> </page> <page> <id>23152</id> <title>Macaulay2</title> <text>'''Macaulay2''' is a [[Free software|free]] [[computer algebra system]] developed by Daniel Grayson (UIUC) and Michael Stillman (Cornell) for computation in [[commutative algebra]] and [[algebraic geometry]].
