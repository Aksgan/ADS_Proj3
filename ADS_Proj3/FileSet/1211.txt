mechanics. The theoretical basis of the method was established by Sir Isaac Newton in 1697<!-- 1967 is INCORRECT! --~~~~Aclariont Sept 25, 2009 (assumed a typo for now)-->. Williams, Hocking, and Mustoe in 1985 showed that DEM could be viewed as a generalized finite element method. Its application to geomechanics problems is described in the book ''Numerical Modeling in Rock Mechanics'', by Pande, G., Beer, G. and Williams, J.R.. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd International Conferences on Discrete Element Methods have been a common point for researchers to publish advances in the method and its applications. Journal articles reviewing the state of the art have been published by Williams, [[Nenad Bicanic|Bicanic]], and [[Bobet]] et al. (see below). A comprehensive treatment of the combined Finite Element-Discrete Element Method is contained in the book ''The Combined Finite-Discrete Element Method'' by [[Ante Munjiza|Munjiza]]. Discrete element methods are relatively computationally intensive, which limits either the length of a simulation or the number of particles. Several DEM codes, as do molecular dynamics codes, take advantage of parallel processing capabilities (shared or distributed systems) to scale up the number of particles or length of the simulation. An alternative to treating all particles separately is to average the physics across many particles and thereby treat the material as a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]]. In the case of [[solid]]-like granular behavior as in [[soil mechanics]], the continuum approach usually treats the material as [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] or [[Plasticity (physics)|elasto-plastic]] and models it with the [[finite element method]] or a [[Meshfree methods|mesh free method]]. In the case of liquid-like or gas-like granular flow, the continuum approach may treat the material as a [[fluid]] and use [[computational fluid dynamics]]. Drawbacks to [[homogenization]] of the granular scale physics, however, are well-documented and should be considered carefully before attempting to use a continuum approach. ==Applications== The fundamental assumption of the method is that the material consists of separate, discrete particles. These particles may have different shapes and properties. Some examples are: * [[liquid]]s and [[solution]]s, for instance of [[sugar]] or [[protein]]s; * [[bulk material]]s in [[storage silo]]s, like [[cereal]]; * [[granular matter]], like [[sand]]; * [[Powder (substance)|powders]], like [[toner]]. * Blocky or jointed rock masses Typical industries using DEM are: * Agriculture and food handling * Chemical * Civil Engineering * Oil and gas * Mining * Mineral processing * Pharmaceutical * [[Powder metallurgy]] ==Outline of the method== A DEM-simulation is started by first generating a model, which results in spatially orienting all particles and assigning an initial [[velocity]]. The forces which act on each particle are computed from the initial data and the relevant physical laws and contact models. Generally, a simulation consists of three parts: the initialization, explicit time-stepping, and post-processing. The time-stepping usually requires a nearest neighbor sorting step to reduce the number of possible contact pairs and decrease the computational requirements; this is often only performed periodically. The following forces may have to be considered in macroscopic simulations: * [[friction]], when two particles touch each other; * [[contact plasticity]], or recoil, when two particles collide; * [[gravity]], the force of attraction between particles due to their mass, which is only relevant in astronomical simulations. * attractive potentials, such as [[cohesion]], [[adhesion]], [[liquid bridging]], [[electrostatic attraction]]. Note that, because of the overhead from determining nearest neighbor pairs, exact resolution of long-range, compared with particle size, forces can increase computational cost or require specialized algorithms to resolve these interactions. On a molecular level, we may consider * the [[Coulomb force]], the [[electrostatic]] attraction or repulsion of particles carrying [[electric charge]]; * [[Pauli exclusion principle|Pauli repulsion]], when two atoms approach each other closely; * [[van der Waals force]]. All these forces are added up to find the total force acting on each particle. An [[numerical ordinary differential equations|integration method]] is employed to compute the change in the position and the velocity of each particle during a certain time step from [[Newton's laws of motion]]. Then, the new positions are used to compute the forces during the next step, and this [[program loop|loop]] is repeated until the simulation ends. Typical integration methods used in a discrete element method are: * the [[Verlet integration|Verlet algorithm]], * [[velocity Verlet]], * [[symplectic integrator]]s, * the [[leapfrog method]]. ==Long-range forces== When long-range forces (typically gravity or the Coulomb force) are taken into account, then the interaction between each pair of particles needs to be computed. The number of interactions, and with it the cost of the computation, [[quadratic growth|increases quadratically]] with the number of particles. This is not acceptable for simulations with large number of particles. A possible way to avoid this problem is to combine some particles, which are far away from the particle under consideration, into one pseudoparticle. Consider as an example the interaction between a star and a distant [[galaxy]]: The error arising from combining all the stars in the distant galaxy into one point mass is negligible. So-called tree algorithms are used to decide which particles can be combined into one pseudoparticle. These algorithms arrange all particles in a tree, a [[quadtree]] in the two-dimensional case and an [[octree]] in the three-dimensional case. However, simulations in molecular dynamics divide the space in which the simulation take place into cells. Particles leaving through one side of a cell are simply inserted at the other side (periodic [[boundary condition]]s); the same goes for the forces. The force is no longer taken into account after the so-called cut-off distance (usually half the length of a cell), so that a particle is not influenced by the mirror image of the same particle in the other side of the cell. One can now increase the number of particles by simply copying the cells. Algorithms to deal with long-range force include: * [[Barnes&ndash;Hut simulation]], * the [[fast multipole method]]. ==Combined finite-discrete element method == Following the work by Munjiza and Owen's earlier work, the combined-discrete element method has been further developed to various irregular and deformable particles in many applications including pharmaceutical tableting <ref>R W Lewis, D T Gethin, X-S Yang, R.
