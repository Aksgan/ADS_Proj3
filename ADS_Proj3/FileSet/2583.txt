Nonzero '''Q''' under [[multiplication]] (&times;) is an [[abelian group]]. *Every [[cyclic group]] ''G'' is abelian, because if ''x'', ''y'' are in ''G'', then ''xy'' = ''a''<sup>m</sup>''a''<sup>n</sup> = ''a''<sup>m+n</sup> = ''a''<sup>n+m</sup> = ''a''<sup>n</sup>''a''<sup>m</sup> = ''yx''. In particular, '''Z''' is an abelian group under addition, as are the [[modular arithmetic|integers modulo ''n'']], '''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''. * Every group is a [[loop (mathematics)|loop]], because ''a''*''x'' = ''b'' [[if and only if]] ''x'' = ''a''<sup>&minus;1</sup>*''b'', and ''y''*''a'' = ''b'' if and only if ''y'' = ''b''*''a''<sup>&minus;1</sup>. * [[matrix inversion|Invertible]] 2x2 [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] form a group under [[matrix multiplication]]. *The [[permutation]]s preserving the [[partition of a set]] induced by an [[equivalence relation]] form a group under [[function composition]] and [[inverse function|inverse]]. * [[MV-algebra]]s characterize [[multi-valued logic|multi-valued]] and [[fuzzy logic]]s. *The set of all [[function (mathematics)|functions]] ''X''→''X'', ''X'' any nonempty set, is a [[monoid]] under [[function composition]] and the [[identity function]]. *In [[category theory]], the set of all [[endomorphism]]s of [[Object (category theory)|object]] ''X'' in [[category theory|category]] ''C'' is a [[monoid]] under [[function composition|composition of morphisms]] and the [[identity morphism]]. Also see [[examples of groups]], [[list of small groups]], and [[list of finite simple groups]]. ===Lattices=== * The following structures, if ordered by [[set inclusion]], all form [[modular lattice]]s. The: **[[Subgroup]]s of a [[Group (mathematics)|group]], [[normal subgroups|normal]] or not; **[[Subring]]s and [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]; **[[Submodules]] of a [[module (mathematics)|module]] and the [[subspace]]s of a [[vector space]]; **[[Equivalence relation]]s on any set; **[[Lattice (order)|Sublattices]] of any lattice including the [[empty set]]. * The [[closed set]]s of a [[topological space]] form a lattice under finite [[Union (set theory)|unions]] and [[intersection]]s. The [[open set]]s, ordered by [[inclusion]], form a lattice under arbitrary unions. *A [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] (BA) is also an [[ortholattice]], a [[Boolean ring]], a [[commutative]] [[monoid]], and a Newman algebra. The BA '''[[two-element Boolean algebra|2]]''' is a [[laws of form|boundary algebra]]. A BA would be an [[abelian group]] if (''b'')''ba'' = ''a'' were a BA identity. * Any [[field of sets]], and the [[connective]]s of [[first-order logic]], are models of Boolean algebra. See [[Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra]]. * The connectives of [[intuitionistic logic]] form a model of [[Heyting algebra]]. * The [[modal logic]]s [[normal modal logic|K]], [[normal modal logic|S4]], [[S5 (modal logic)|S5]], and wK4 are models of [[modal logic|modal algebra]], [[interior algebra]], [[monadic Boolean algebra]], and [[derivative algebra (abstract algebra)|derivative algebra]], respectively. * Any [[first-order theory]] whose [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentences]] can be written in such a way that the [[quantifier]]s do not nest more than three deep, can be recast as a model of [[relation algebra]]. Such models include [[Peano arithmetic]] and most [[axiomatic set theory|axiomatic set theories]], including [[ZFC]], [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory|NBG]], and [[New Foundations]]. ===Ring-like structures=== * '''N''' is a commutative [[semiring]] under addition and multiplication. * The set ''R''[X] of all [[polynomial]]s over some coefficient ring ''R'' is a ring. * 2x2 [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] under matrix addition and multiplication form a ring. * If ''n'' is a positive integer, then the set '''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub> = '''Z'''/n'''Z''' of integers modulo ''n'' (the additive [[cyclic group]] of order ''n'' ) forms a ring having ''n'' elements (see [[modular arithmetic]]). ===Field-like structures=== * '''Z''' is an [[integral domain]] under addition and multiplication. * Each of '''Q''', '''R''', '''C''', and the [[p-adic number|p-adic integers]] is a [[field (algebra)|field]] under addition and multiplication. *'''Q''' and '''R''' are [[ordered field]]s, [[linear order|totally ordered]] by '≤'. *'''R''' is the: **Only [[Dedekind complete]] [[ordered field]], as the axioms for such a field are [[categorical]]; **[[Real field]] grounding [[real analysis|real]] and [[functional analysis]]; **Filed whose subfields include the [[algebraic number|algebraic]], the [[computable number|computable]], and the [[definable number]]s. *'''C''' is an [[algebraically closed field]]. *Some facts about [[finite field]]s: **There exists a complete classification thereof. **An [[algebraic number field]] in [[number theory]] is a [[finite field]] extension of '''Q''', that is, a field containing '''Q''' which has finite dimension as a [[vector space]] over '''Q'''. **If ''q'' > 1 is a power of a [[prime number]], then there exists ([[up to]] [[isomorphism]]) exactly one [[finite field]] with ''q'' elements, usually denoted '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>, or in the case that ''q'' is itself prime, by '''Z'''/''q'''''Z'''. Such fields are called [[Galois field]]s, whence the alternative notation GF(''q''). All finite fields are isomorphic to some Galois field. **Given some [[prime number]] ''p'', the set '''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub> = '''Z'''/''p'''''Z''' of integers modulo ''p'' is the [[finite field]] with ''p'' elements: '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub> = {0, 1, ..., ''p'' &minus; 1} where the operations are defined by performing the operation in '''Z''', dividing by ''p'' and taking the remainder; see [[modular arithmetic]].
