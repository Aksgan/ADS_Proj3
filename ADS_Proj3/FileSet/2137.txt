language in Japanese.'Hitotsubashi JOurnal of Arts of Sciences' 19:1-7.</ref> Many instances of sex/gender indices incorporate multiple levels of indexicality (also referred to as ''indexical order'')<ref name=indexicalorder/>. In fact, some, such as the prefix-affixation of o- in Japanese, demonstrate complex higher-order indexical forms. In this example, the first order indexes politeness and the second order indexes affiliation with a certain gender class. It is argued, that there is an even higher level of indexical order evidenced by the fact that many jobs use the ''o-'' prefix to attract female applicants.<ref name=o/> This notion of higher-order indexicality is similar to Silverstein's discussion of "wine talk" (see below) in that it indexes "an identity-by-visible-consumption<ref name=indexicalorder/> [here, ''employment'']" that is an inherent of a certain social register, (i.e. social gender indexicality). ===Affect indices=== Affective meaning is seen as "the encoding, or indexing of speakers emotions into speech events."<ref name=affect>Besnier, Niko. Language and Affect. Annual Reviews, Inc., 1990.</ref> The interlocutor of the event "decodes" these verbal messages of affect by giving "precedence to intentionality";<ref name=affect/> that is, by assuming that the affective form intentionally indexes emotional meaning. Some examples of affective forms are: [[diminutives]] (for example, diminutive affixes in [[Indo-European]] and [[Amerindian]] languages indicate sympathy, endearment, emotional closeness, or antipathy, condescension, and emotional distance); [[ideophones]] and [[onomatopoeias]]; [[expletives]], [[exclamations]], [[interjections]], curses, insults, and [[imprecations]] (said to be "dramatizations of actions or states"); [[intonation]] change (common in tone languages such as Japanese); address terms, kinship terms, and pronouns which often display clear affective dimensions (ranging from the complex address-form systems found languages such a [[Javanese language|Javanese]] to inversions of vocative kin terms found in Rural [[Italy]])<ref name=affect/>; [[lexical]] processes such as [[synecdoche]] and [[metonymy]] involved in affect meaning manipulation; certain categories of meaning like [[evidentiality]]; [[reduplication]], [[quantifiers]], and comparative structures; as well as [[inflectional morphology]]. Affective forms are a means by which a speaker indexes emotional states through different linguistic mechanisms. These indices become important when applied to other forms of non-referential indexicality, such as sex indices and social identity indices, because of the innate relationship between first-order indexicality and subsequent second-order (or higher) indexical forms. (See multiple indices section for Japanese example). ===Deference indices=== Deference indices encode deference from one interlocutor to another (usually representing inequalities of status, rank, age, sex, etc.).<ref name=shifters/> Some examples of deference indices are: ====T/V deference entitlement==== The [[T–V_distinction|T/V deference entitlement system]] of [[European languages]] was famously detailed by linguists Brown and Gilman.<ref name=BrownGilman /> As previously mentioned, T/V deference entitlement is a system by which a speaker/addressee speech event is determined by perceived disparities of 'power' and 'solidarity' between interlocutors. Brown and Gilman organized the possible relationships between the speaker and the addressee into six categories: # Superior and solidary # Superior and not solidary # Equal and solidary # Equal and not solidary # Inferior and solidary # Inferior and not solidary The 'power semantic' indicates that the speaker in a superior position uses T and the speaker in an inferior position uses V. The 'solidarity semantic' indicates that speakers use T for close relationships and V for more formal relationships. These two principles conflict in categories 2 and 5, allowing either T or V in those cases: # Superior and solidary: T # Superior and not solidary: T/V # Equal and solidary: T # Equal and not solidary: V # Inferior and solidary: T/V # Inferior and not solidary: V Brown and Gilman observed that as the solidarity semantic becomes more important than the power semantic in various cultures, the proportion of T to V use in the two ambiguous categories changes accordingly. Silverstein comments that while exhibiting a basic level of first-order indexicality, the T/V system also employs second-order indexicality vis-à-vis 'enregistered honorification'.<ref name=indexicalorder /> He cites that the V form can also function as an index of valued "public" register and the standards of good behavior that are entailed by use of V forms over T forms in public contexts. Therefore, people will use T/V deference [[entailment]] in 1) a first-order indexical sense that distinguishes between speaker/addressee interpersonal values of 'power' and 'solidarity' and 2) a second-order indexical sense that indexes an interlocutor's inherent "honor" or social merit in employing V forms over T forms in public contexts. ====Japanese honorifics==== Japanese provides an excellent case study of [[honorifics]]. Honorifics in Japanese can be divided into two categories: addressee honorifics, which index deference to the addressee of the utterance; and referent honorifics, which index deference to the referent of the utterance. Cynthia Dunn claims that "almost every utterance in Japanese requires a choice between direct and distal forms of the predicate."<ref name=japanese>Dunn, Cynthia. "Pragmatic Functions of Humble Forms in Japanese Ceremonial Discourse. 'Journal of Linguistic Anthropology', Vol. 15, Issue 2, pp. 218&ndash;238, 2005</ref> The direct form indexes intimacy and "spontaneous self-expression" in contexts involving family and close friends. Contrarily, distal form index social contexts of a more formal, public nature such as distant acquaintances, business settings, or other formal settings. Japanese also contains a set of humble forms (Japanese ''kenijyoogo'') which are employed by the speaker to index their deference to someone else. There are also [[suppletive]] forms that can be used in lieu of regular honorific endings (for example, the subject honorific form of ''taberu'' [to eat]: ''meshiagaru''). Verbs that involve human subjects must choose between ''distal'' or ''direct'' forms (towards the addressee) as well as a distinguish between either no use of referent honorifics, use of subject honorific (for others), or use of humble form (for self). The Japanese model for non-referential indexicality demonstrates a very subtle and complicated system that encodes social context into almost every utterance. ====Affinal taboo index==== [[Dyirbal]], a language of the [[Cairns]] [[rain forest]] in [[Northern Queensland]], employs a system known as the affinal taboo index. Speakers of the language maintain two sets of lexical items: 1) an "everyday" or common interaction set of lexical items and 2) a "mother-in-law" set that is employed when the speaker is in the very distinct context of interaction with their mother-in-law.
