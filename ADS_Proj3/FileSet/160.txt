The use of such source code, and therefore the executable version, is not restricted by copyright and therefore does not need a [[free software licence]] to make it free software. ==See also== {{Portal|Free software}} *[[Free software community]] *[[Free software movement]] *[[GNU/Linux naming controversy]] *[[History of free software]] *[[Open source vs. closed source]] *[[Permissive free software licences]] *[[Software wars]] ==References== {{Reflist|2}} ==External links== *Hancock, Terry.

It succeeded the [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]]/[[IRIX]]-based [[SGI Origin 3000|Origin 3000]] servers. The line was first announced<ref>[http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/77311/SGI_releases_Linux_supercomputer_with_Itanium_processor?taxonomyId=122]</ref> on January 7, 2003, with the '''Altix 3000''' series, based on [[Intel]] [[Itanium 2]] processors and SGI's [[NUMAlink]] processor interconnect. At product introduction, the system supported up to 64 processors running Linux as a [[single system image]] and shipped with a Linux distribution called SGI Advanced Linux Environment, which was compatible with Red Hat Advanced Server. By August 2003, many SGI Altix customers<ref>[http://news.cnet.com/SGI-aims-high-with-Altix-machine/2100-1001_3-5094162.html ]</ref> were running Linux on 128p and even 256p SGI Altix systems, but SGI officially announced 256-processor support<ref>[http://www.linuxtoday.com/high_performance/2004031001626NWHESV]</ref> within a single system image of Linux on March 10, 2004 using an 2.4-based kernel. The SGI Advanced Linux Environment was eventually dropped after support using a standard, unmodified [[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server]] (SLES) distribution for SGI Altix was provided with SLES 8<ref name="developer.novell.com">[http://developer.novell.com/yes/77348.htm]</ref> and SLES 9<ref name="developer.novell.com"/>. Later, SGI Altix 512-processor systems were officially supported<ref>[http://developer.novell.com/yes/80546.htm]</ref> using unmodified, standard Linux distribution with the launch of SLES 9 SP1. Besides full support of SGI Altix on [[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server]], a standard and unmodified [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] was also fully supported starting with SGI Altix 3700 Bx2 with RHEL 4<ref>[http://hardware.redhat.com/show.cgi?id=147520]</ref> and RHEL 5<ref>[http://hardware.redhat.com/show.cgi?id=235908]</ref> with system processor limits defined by Red Hat for those releases. On 14 November 2005, SGI introduced the '''Altix 4000''' series based on the Itanium 2.<ref>[[Silicon Graphics|Silicon Graphics, Inc.]] (14 November 2005). ''SGI Launches New Flagship Altix 4000 Platform''. ([[Press release]]).</ref> The Altix 3000 and 4000 are [[distributed shared memory]] [[Multiprocessing|multiprocessor]]s. SGI later officially supported 1024-processors systems on an unmodified, standard Linux distribution with the launch of SLES 10<ref>[http://developer.novell.com/yes/84529.htm]</ref> in July 2006. SGI Altix 4700 was also officially supported by Red Hat with RHEL 4<ref>[http://hardware.redhat.com/show.cgi?id=195732]</ref> and RHEL 5<ref>[http://hardware.redhat.com/show.cgi?id=230481]</ref>&mdash;maximum processor limits were as defined by Red Hat for its RHEL releases. The Altix brand has been also used for a variety of systems based on [[multi-core]] Intel [[Xeon]] processors. These includes the '''Altix XE''' [[rackmount]] servers, '''Altix ICE''' [[blade server]]s and '''Altix UV''' supercomputers. [[NASA]]'s [[Columbia (supercomputer)|Columbia]] [[supercomputer]], installed in 2004, is a 10,240-microprocessor cluster of twenty Altix 3000 systems, each with 512 microprocessors, interconnected with [[InfiniBand]]. == Altix 3000 == The Altix 3000 was the first generation of Altix systems. It was succeeded by the Altix 4000 in 2004, and the last model was discontinued on 31 December 2006. === Altix 330 === The '''Altix 330''' is an entry-level server. Unlike the high-end models, the Altix 330 is not "brick" based, but is instead based on 1U-high compute modules mounted in a rack and connected with [[NUMAlink]]. A single system may contain 1 to 16 Itanium 2 processors and 2 to 128 GB of memory. === Altix 350 === The '''Altix 350''' is a mid-range model which supports up to 32 Itanium 2 processors. === Altix 1330 === The '''Altix 1330''' is a [[cluster (computing)|cluster]] of Altix 330 systems. The systems are networked with [[gigabit Ethernet]] or 4X [[Infiniband]]. === Altix 1350 === The '''Altix 1350''' is a cluster of Altix 350 systems. === Altix 3300 === The '''Altix 3300''' is a mid-range model supporting 4 to 12 processors and 2 to 48 GB of memory. It is packaged in a short (17U) rack. === Altix 3700 === The '''Altix 3700''' is a high-end model supporting 16 to 512 processors and 8 GB to 2 TB of memory. It
