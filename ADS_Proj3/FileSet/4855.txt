WorkNC is used by more than 25% of companies in demanding countries such as Japan<ref>EngineeringTalk, “[http://www.engineeringtalk.com/news/sez/sez116.html Nikkan Kogyo survey]”</ref> and is well known for having always focused on [[automation]] and ease of use<ref> Machinery, the home of production engineering “[http://fplreflib.findlay.co.uk/articles/3777/GrandCruCAM.pdf Grand Cru CAM article]”</ref> since its first release in 1988. [[WorkNC-CAD]] was introduced in 2002, making WorkNC a complete [[Computer-aided design|CAD]]/[[Computer aided manufacturing|CAM]] product, one of the worldwide market leaders in its field<ref>Datakit website, “[http://www.datakit.com/download.php?kind=doc&filename=sescoi.pdf WorkNC, a market leader]”</ref>. The typical users of WorkNC belong to the following industries: [[Automotive industry|automotive]], [[aerospace]] and defense, [[engineering]], [[medical]] & [[Dentistry|dental]], [[tooling]], [[mold (manufacturing)|mold]] and [[die (manufacturing)|die manufacturing]]. == History == [[Image:WorkNC-Audi concept car.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Audi]] concept car, machined using '''WorkNC'''.]] The first version of WorkNC CAM software was released by Sescoi in 1988. The driving forces behind the product were Bruno Marko, president of Sescoi, and Gerard Billard, R&D Innovation Manager<ref>DesignPresentation Associates.“[http://designpresentation.com/blogs/2008/03/sescoi-celebrates-workncs-20th.html Sescoi Celebrates WorkNC's 20th Anniversary] ”</ref>. In the late eighties, [[CNC]] programming of complex components was a difficult and lengthy process. This was when Sescoi identified the need for 3-axis CAM software and pioneered the development of WorkNC, a new, reliable and automatic 3-axis CAM system. Over the years, Sescoi has stuck to the original philosophy behind WorkNC : to speed up toolpath calculations, ensure optimum [[reliability]] to facilitate machining directly into hard materials, and maximize automation and ease of use so that programming can be carried out on the [[shop floor]]. Automation is a theme which runs throughout the development history of the software. According to Bruno Marko, “WorkNC’s aim has always been to be the closest thing possible to a ‘single-button’ CAM”. [[Salomon Group]] was the first customer to use WorkNC in 1988 and has now been using it for over 20 years to manufacture [[ski boot]]s and other sports equipment<ref>Manufacturingtalk magazine, “[http://www.manufacturingtalk.com/news/sez/sez184.html Salomon uses WorkNC CAM to machine skiboots since 1988]”</ref>. Demand for WorkNC took off and Sescoi expanded its operations by opening offices in the USA in 1991, Germany and Japan in 1995, UK in 1997, followed by Spain, India, China and Korea. The company released [[WorkNC-CAD]] in 2002 and WorkNC 5-axis in 2003. WorkNC G3, the third generation of the software with an integrated and intuitive [[CAD/CAM]] interface, was released in 2007. In 2008 Sescoi launched [[WorkXPlore 3D]], a high-speed collaborative viewer for analyzing and sharing 3D CAD files without having to rely on the original CAD application<ref>Direct Industry, “[http://www.directindustry.com/prod/sescoi/visualization-software-collaborative-3d-viewer-8732-375155.html WorkXPlore 3D collaborative viewer]”</ref>. In 2009 the company launched [[WorkNC Dental]], a [[Computer-aided design|CAD]]/[[Computer-aided manufacturing|CAM]] software for automatic 3 to 5-axis machining of prosthetic appliances, implants or dental structures<ref>Desktop Engineering, “[http://www.deskeng.com/articles/aaardf.htm WorkNC DENTAL Software Showcased at Rapid.Tech]”</ref> , and also launched WorkNC Wire EDM<ref>Desktop Engineering, “[http://www.deskeng.com/articles/aaarjb.htm Sescoi Introduces WorkNC Wire EDM]”</ref>, a software for Wire [[Electrical discharge machining|EDM]]. In 2010 Sescoi launched [[WorkNC-CAD Hybrid Modeling]], a powerful 3D CAD software for 3D model design, reparation and machining preparation, with new surface design capabilities tightly integrated with solid modeling functionality, powered by [[D-Cubed]] software components.<ref name="siemens">Siemens PLM Software, June 8, 2010, [http://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/en_us/about_us/newsroom/press/press_release.cfm?Component=98527&ComponentTemplate=822 D-Cubed 2D DCM and 3D DCM from Siemens PLM Software Integrated into Sescoi's WorkNC-CAD Hybrid Modeling]</ref><ref name="euromold2010"/> WorkNC is supported from Sescoi offices in the USA, UK, France, Germany, Spain, Japan, India, China and Korea, and more than 50 distributors around the world. == Main functionality == WorkNC CAM main functions include: *Automatic geometry and machining zone detection and management *Specific fluid and progressive toolpaths designed for High Speed Machining *Full user stock definition (block, CAD, [[STL (file format)|STL]]) *Dynamic 3 and 3+2 stock Management (Real time toolpath updated) *Complete tool and holder collision check with automatic stock update *Powerful toolpath editor *Virtual 3D machine representation and machining simulation (dynamic editing of points and vectors) *Powerful tool and holder library (holder components managed) *Automatic [[HTML]] workshop documentation *User predefined machining sequences for automatic machining *Machining from [[STL (file format)|STL]] files and point clouds *[[Batch mode]] calculations *Comprehensive postprocessor generator (NURBS, cycles, circular interpolation...) === Roughing toolpaths === *Global Roughing<ref>Machining videos, “[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTPBa6qEKMU CNC global roughing machining]”</ref> and Re-roughing toolpath designed and optimized for HSM (high speed machining) *A range of specific toolpaths with [[trochoid]]al<ref>Machining videos, “[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGs34sY28_o CNC trochoidal milling-machining]”</ref>, spiral or plunging movement, including HVR (high volume roughing) *Roughing strategies use the Tool and Holder collision check with an automatic update of the stock *Automatic calculation and machining of rest areas based on dynamic stock *Re-machining toolpaths enable automatic rest material machining with increasingly smaller tools === Finishing toolpaths === *A wide range of Finishing toolpaths optimized for HSM machining *Z Level finishing, Planar finishing, Flat [[surface finishing]], Contour finishing, Edge finishing *Automatic Rest-material finishing with a sequence of progressively smaller tools *3D Display of rest-material areas *Automatic 5 Axis conversion possible === 2 and 2.5 Axis toolpaths === Range of 2 and 2½-axis strategies include: *Pocketing, Contouring, Curve machining, Engraving, Rib machining, Facing, Drilling, Tapping ... *Automatic [[Drilling]] Module *Automatic feature detection and recognition, Pre-defined drilling sequence selection,
