Hubs work at the [[physical layer]] (layer 1) of the [[OSI model]]. The device is a form of [[multiport repeater]]. Repeater hubs also participate in collision detection, forwarding a [[jam signal]] to all ports if it detects a [[collision (telecommunications)|collision]]. Hubs also often come with a [[BNC connector|BNC]] and/or [[Attachment Unit Interface]] (AUI) connector to allow connection to legacy [[10BASE2]] or [[10BASE5]] network segments. The availability of low-priced [[network switch]]es has largely rendered hubs obsolete but they are still seen in older installations and more specialized applications. ==Technical information== A network hub is a fairly unsophisticated broadcast device. Hubs do not manage any of the traffic that comes through them, and any packet entering any port is regenerated and broadcast out on all other ports. Since every packet is being sent out through all other ports, packet collisions result&mdash;which greatly impedes the smooth flow of traffic. The need for hosts to be able to detect collisions limits the number of hubs and the total size of a network built using hubs (a network built using [[Ethernet switch|switches]] does not have these limitations). For 10 Mbit/s networks built using repeater hubs, the [[5-4-3 rule]] must be followed: up to 5 segments (4 hubs) are allowed between any two end stations. For 100 Mbit/s networks, the limit is reduced to 3 segments (2 hubs) between any two end stations, and even that is only allowed if the hubs are of the a delay variety.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Some hubs have manufacturer specific stack ports allowing them to be combined in a way that allows more hubs than simple chaining through Ethernet cables, but even so, a large [[fast Ethernet]] network is likely to require switches to avoid the chaining limits of hubs. Most hubs detect typical problems, such as excessive collisions and jabbering on individual ports, and ''partition'' the port, disconnecting it from the shared medium. Thus, hub-based Ethernet is generally more robust than coaxial cable-based Ethernet (e.g. 10BASE2), where a misbehaving device can adversely affect the entire [[collision domain]]. Even if not partitioned automatically, a hub simplifies troubleshooting because they remove the need to troubleshoot faults on a long cable with multiple taps; status lights on the hub can indicate the possible problem source or, as a last resort, devices can be disconnected from a hub one at a time much more easily than from a coaxial cable. Hubs are classified as Layer 1 (physical layer) devices in the OSI model. At the physical layer, hubs support little in the way of sophisticated networking. Hubs do not read any of the data passing through them and are not aware of their source or destination. A hub simply receives incoming [[Ethernet frame]]s, regenerates the electrical signal, and broadcasts these packets out to all other devices on the network. =={{visible anchor|Dual speed hubs}}==<!--other articles or redirects link here. please preserve this anchor if the section is renamed --> In the early days of fast Ethernet, Ethernet switches were relatively expensive devices. Hubs suffered from the problem that if there were any [[10BASE-T]] devices connected then the whole network needed to run at 10 Mbit/s. Therefore a compromise between a hub and a switch was developed, known as a '''dual-speed hub'''. These devices consisted of an internal two-port switch, dividing the 10 Mbit/s and 100 Mbit/s segments. The device would typically consist of more than two physical ports. When a network device becomes active on any of the physical ports, the device attaches it to either the 10 Mbit/s segment or the 100 Mbit/s segment, as appropriate. This prevented the need for an all-or-nothing migration fast Ethernet networks. These devices are considered hubs because the traffic between devices connected at the same speed is not switched. ==Uses== Historically, the main reason for purchasing hubs rather than [[Network switch|switches]] was their price. This motivator has largely been eliminated by reductions in the price of switches, but hubs can still be useful in special circumstances: * For inserting a [[protocol analyzer]] into a network connection, a hub is an alternative to a [[network tap]] or [[port mirroring]]. * When a switch is accessible for end users to make connections, for example, in a conference room, an inexperienced or careless user (or [[sabotage|saboteur]]) can bring down
