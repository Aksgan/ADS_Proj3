a [[paradox]] brought about by traditional [[rational choice theory]] in which players with [[perfect information]] in the game are compelled to make an ultimately [[irrational]] decision based completely on a sequence of [[Rationality|rational]] choices made throughout the game.<ref name="Shubik1971">{{cite journal |last=Shubik |first=Martin |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1971 |month= |title=The Dollar Auction Game: A Paradox in Noncooperative Behavior and Escalation |journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=109–111 |doi=10.1177/002200277101500111 |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}</ref> ==Setup== The setup involves an auctioneer who volunteers to [[auction]] off a [[dollar bill]] with the following rule: the dollar goes to the highest bidder, who pays the amount he bids. The second-highest bidder also must pay the highest amount that he bid, but gets nothing in return. Suppose that the game begins with one of the players bidding 1 cent, hoping to make a 99 cent profit. He will quickly be outbid by another player bidding 2 cents, as a 98 cent profit is still desirable. Similarly, another bidder may bid 3 cents, making a 97 cent profit. Alternatively, the first bidder may attempt to convert their loss of 1 cent into a gain of 96 cents by bidding 4 cents. In this way, a series of bids is maintained. However, a problem becomes evident as soon as the bidding reaches 99 cents. Supposing that the other player had bid 98 cents, they now have the choice of losing the 98 cents or bidding a dollar even, which would make their profit zero. After that, the original player has a choice of either losing 99 cents or bidding $1.01, and only losing one cent. After this point the two players continue to bid the value up well beyond the dollar, and neither stands to profit. ==Refutations== One possible model, by which the dollar auction can be profitable for the bidders and detrimental to the auctioneer, involves two parties bidding cooperatively. The two parties could bid two cents for the dollar together, and each profit 49 cents. However, this ignores the fact that the auction is a public auction. Though the end game only involves two bidders, before the bidding hits 98 cents it is still a "profitable" proposition for any player to enter the bidding. To end the bidding war a bidder can bid 99 cents more than the previous bid, leaving no bid that offers a potentially higher profit (or smaller loss). (For example, Bidder 1 bids $x, Bidder 2 bids $x + $0.99. If Bidder 1 were to bid $x + $0.99 + $0.01, he would be bidding to pay $x + $0.99 + $0.01 for a prize of $1, or a total loss of $x—the same as if he had not increased his previous bid.) As a special case of this, if the first bidder immediately bids $0.99, he will not be outbid by the other bidder, who has no potential to make a profit. The first bidder will earn $0.01 in profit and the second bidder will pay nothing and win nothing. A second refutation involves the fact that any rational person need only play this scenario out to realize it is a losing proposition and not engage in such an auction in the first place. This refutation relies on players being rational, and much psychological and economic evidence suggests that humans are not always rational in this sense.<ref>e.g. Wald (2008), "Crazy Money: Humans aren't rational, as the recent economic crisis shows. So why should financial theories assume that they are?", Science, v322, pp 1624-1626</ref> ==Analysis== The dollar auction is often used as a simple illustration of the [[irrational escalation of commitment]]. By the end of the game, though both players stand to lose money, they continue bidding the value up well beyond the point that the dollar difference between the winner's and loser's loss is negligible; they are fueled to bid further by their past investment.<ref name="Colman1995">{{cite book |title=Game Theory and Its Applications in the Social and Biological Sciences |series=International Series in Social Psychology |last=Colman |first=Andrew M. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1995 |publisher=Routledge Farmer |location=London |isbn=0750623691 |page= |pages= |url= }}</ref> The dollar auction can also be used as a refutation of [[Expected value]] calculations{{By whom|date=April 2010}}. The typical setup will show that at a bid price of 99 cents and a second bid price of 98 cents, the current bidder's application of probability calculations will determine to bid again based on his apparent choices of either: *Losing 98 cents *Gaining a dollar and paying one dollar. However, this is an improper formation of an expected value calculation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} The actual expected value of bidding again is not zero cents due to the unterminated nature of the game; the value of the bid is actually zero cents multiplied by the possibility of the other player giving up at that point, added to the value of losing two cents multiplied by the probability of the other player NOT giving up at that point, in an infinite series with unbounded loss. ==See also== *[[War of attrition (game)]] *[[All-pay auction]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==Further reading== *[[William Poundstone]], <cite>Prisoner's Dilemma: John Von Neumann, Game Theory, and the Puzzle of the Bomb</cite>, Anchor/Random House, 1993 (especially chapter 13: "The Dollar Auction") {{game theory}} [[Category:Game theory]] [[Category:Economics paradoxes]] [[cs:Dolarová aukce]] [[de:Dollarauktion]] [[es:Subasta de un dólar]] [[he:מכירה פומבית של דולר]] [[pl:Aukcja o dolara]] [[ta:டாலர் ஏலம்]] [[zh:拍卖美元]]</text> </page> <page> <id>10912</id> <title>Domain/key normal form</title> <text>'''Domain/key normal form''' ('''DKNF''') is a [[Database normalization#Normal forms|normal form]] used in [[database normalization]] which requires that the database contains no constraints other than [[Data_domain|domain constraints]] and key constraints. A domain constraint specifies the permissible values for a given attribute, while a key constraint specifies the attributes that uniquely identify a row in a given table . The domain/key normal form is achieved when every constraint on the relation is a [[logical consequence]] of the definition of keys and domains, and enforcing key and domain restraints and conditions causes all constraints to be met. Thus, it avoids all non-temporal anomalies. The reason to use domain/key normal form is to avoid having general constraints
