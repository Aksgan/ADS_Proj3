types'' cf van Heijenoort 1967:151</ref>. [[Stephen Kleene]] in his 1952 ''Introduction to Metamathematics'' describes the ''ramified'' theory of types this way: :The primary objects or individuals (i.e. the given things not being subjected to logical analysis) are assigned to one type (say ''type 0''), the properties of individuals to ''type 1'', properties of properties of individuals to ''type 2'', etc.; and no properties are admitted which do not fall into one of these logical types (e.g. this puts the properties 'predicable' and 'impredicable' ... outside the pale of logic). A more detailed account would describe the admitted types for other objects as relations and classes. Then to exclude [[impredicativity|impredicative]] definitions within a type, the types above type 0 are further separated into orders. Thus for type 1, properties defined without mentioning any totality belong to ''order 0'', and properties defined using the totality of properties of a given order belong to the next higher order. ... But this separation into orders makes it impossible to construct the familiar analysis, which we saw above contains impredicative definitions. To escape this outcome, Russell postulated his ''[[axiom of reducibility]]'', which asserts that to any property belonging to an order above the lowest, there is a coextensive property (i.e. one possessed by exactly the same objects) of order 0. If only definable properties are considered to exist, then the axiom means that to every impredicative definition within a given type there is an equivalent predicative one (Kleene 1952:44-45). ==== The axiom of reducibility and the notion of "matrix" ==== But because the stipulations of the ramified theory would prove (to quote Quine) "onerous", Russell in his 1908 ''Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types''<ref>Russell (1908a) ''Mathematical Logic as based on the theory of types'' in van Heijenoort 1967:153-182</ref> also would propose his ''[[axiom of reducibility]]''. By 1910 Whitehead and Russell in their ''Principia Mathematica'' would further augment this axiom with the notion of a '' matrix '' -- a fully-extensional specification of a function. From its matrix a function could be derived by the process of "generalization" and vice versa, i.e. the two processes are reversible -- (i) generalization from a matrix to a function ( by use apparent variables ) and (ii) the reverse process of reduction of type by courses-of-values substitution of arguments for the apparent variable. By this method impredicativity could be avoided<ref>cf in particular p. 51 in Chapter II ''The theory of Logical Types'' and *12 ''The Hierarchy of Types and the Axiom of Reducibility'' pp. 162-167. Whitehead and Russell (1910-1913, 1927 2nd edition) ''Principia Mathematica''</ref>. ==== Truth tables ==== Eventually [[Emil Post]] (1921) would lay waste to Russell's "cumbersome"<ref>Post (1921) ''Introduction to a general theory of elementary propositions'' in van Heijenoort 1967:264-283, in particular p. 265"</ref> Theory of Types with his "truth functions" and their truth tables. In his "Introduction" to his 1921 Post places the blame on Russell's notion of apparent variable: "Whereas the complete theory [of Whitehead and Russell (1910, 1912, 1913)] requires for the enunciation of its propositions real and apparent variables, which represent both individuals and [[propositional function]]s of different kinds, and as a result necessitates the cumbersome theory of types, this subtheory uses only real variables, and these real variables represent but one kind of entity, which the authors have chosen to call elementary propositions". At about the same time [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] made short work of the theory of types in his 1922 work [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]] in which he points out the following in parts 3.331&ndash;3.333: {{quote|3.331 From this observation we get a further view &ndash; into Russell's Theory of Types. Russell's error is shown by the fact that in drawing up his symbolic rules he has to speak of the meanings of his signs. 3.332 No proposition can say anything about itself, because the propositional sign cannot be contained in itself (that is the whole "theory of types"). 3.333 A function cannot be its own argument, because the functional sign already contains the prototype of its own argument and it cannot contain itself...}} Wittgenstein proposed the truth-table method as well. In his 4.3 through 5.101, Wittgenstein adopts an unbounded [[Sheffer stroke]] as his fundamental logical entity and then lists all 16 functions of two variables (5.101). The notion of matrix-as-truth-table appears as late as the 1940-1950's in the work of Tarski, e.g. his 1946 indexes "Matrix, see: Truth table"<ref>Tarski 1946, ''Introduction to Logic and to the Methodology of Deductive Sciences'', Dover republication 1995</ref> ==== Russell's doubts ==== Russell in his 1920 ''Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy'' devotes an entire chapter to "The axiom of Infinity and logical types" wherein he states his concerns: "Now the theory of types emphatically does not belong to the finished and certain part of our subject: much of this theory is still inchoate, confused, and obscure. But the need of ''some'' doctrine of types is less doubtful than the precise form the doctrine should take; and in connection with the axiom of infinity it is particularly easy to see the necessity of some such doctrine"<ref>Russell 1920:135</ref>. '''Russell abandons the axiom of reducibility''': In the second edition of ''Principia Mathematica'' (1927) he acknowledges Wittgenstein's argument<ref>cf "Introduction" to 2nd edition, Russell 1927:xiv and Appendix C</ref>. At the outset of his Introduction he declares "there can be no doubt ... that there is no need of the distinction between real and apparent variables..."<ref>cf "Introduction" to 2nd edition, Russell 1927:i</ref>. Now he fully embraces the matrix notion and declares "A ''function can only appear in a matrix through its values''" (but demurs in a footnote: "It takes the place (not quite adequately) of the axiom of reducibility"<ref>cf "Introduction" to 2nd edition, Russell 1927:xxix</ref>). Furthermore, he introduces a new (abbreviated, generalized) notion of "matrix", that of a "logical matrix . . . one that contains no constants. Thus ''p''|''q'' is a logical matrix"<ref>The vertical bar " | " is the Sheffer stroke. cf "Introduction" to 2nd edition, Russell 1927:xxxi</ref>. Thus Russell has virtually abandoned the axiom of reducibility<ref>"The theory of classes is
