Traditionally, controlled languages fall into two major types: those that improve readability for human readers (e.g. non-native speakers), and those that enable reliable automatic semantic analysis of the language. The first type of languages (often called "simplified" or "technical" languages), for example ASD Simplified Technical English, Caterpillar Technical English, IBM's Easy English, are used in the industry to increase the quality of technical documentation, and possibly simplify the (semi-)automatic translation of the documentation. These languages restrict the writer by general rules such as "write short and grammatically simple sentences", "use nouns instead of pronouns", "use determiners", and "use active instead of passive".<ref>{{cite journal | last = Muegge | first = Uwe | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Controlled language: the next big thing in translation? | journal = ClientSide News Magazine | volume = 7 | issue = 7 | pages = 21–24 | publisher = ClientSide Publications | year = 2007 | url = http://www.translationdirectory.com/articles/article1359.php | doi = | id = | accessdate = }}</ref> The second type of languages have a formal logical basis, i.e. they have a formal syntax and semantics, and can be mapped to an existing formal language, such as [[first-order logic]]. Thus, those languages can be used as [[knowledge representation|knowledge-representation]] languages, and writing of those languages is supported by fully automatic consistency and redundancy checks, query answering, etc. ==Languages== Existing logic-based controlled natural languages include<ref name="Pool2006">Jonathan Pool [http://utilika.org/pubs/etc/ambigcl/clweb.html Can Controlled Languages Scale to the Web?] (2006)</ref>: * [[Attempto Controlled English]] * Common Logic Controlled English (CLCE) * [[EasyEnglish]] ([[Wycliffe Associates]]) * Metalog's Pseudo Natural Language (PNL) * [[Ordnance Survey]]'s [[Rabbit (language)|Rabbit]] * Processable ENGlish (PENG) * [[Semantic parameterization]] * [[Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules]] Other existing controlled natural languages include: * [http://www.asd-ste100.org ASD Simplified Technical English] (AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe, formerly AECMA) * [[E-Prime]] * [[Gellish]] * [[Newspeak]], the fictional language in the dystopia novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' by [[George Orwell]], is a controlled natural language as well as a semi-constructed language. * [[Uwe Muegge|Uwe Muegge's]] [http://www.muegge.cc Controlled Language Optimized for Uniform Translation (CLOUT)] * [[Special English]] ([[Voice of America]]) * [[Simplified Technical Russian]] ==See also== * [[Constructed language]] * [[Knowledge representation and reasoning]] * [[Natural language processing]] * [[Controlled vocabulary]] * [[Postediting]] ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== * [http://sites.google.com/site/controllednaturallanguage/ Controlled Natural Languages] (Macquarie University) * [http://www.acrolinx.com/iq_suite_overview_en.html acrolinx Information Quality Suite] – Customizable controlled language checker for many authoring environments * [http://sec.cs.kent.ac.uk/permis/downloads/Level1/policy.shtml PERMIS Policy Editor] uses controlled English in its user interface * Akis, Jennifer Wells, and William R.

The [[file system]] was not hierarchical. All directories existed at the "root" level. Subdirectories were not allowed. However, very [[long filename]]s of 255 characters were allowed. System access was controlled with a user password and Volume or disk passwords. If one knew the password, for example, for a volume, one could access any file or directory on that volume (hard disk). Each volume and directory were referenced with delimiters to identify them, and could be followed with a file name, depending on the operation, i.e. [VolumeName]<DirectoryName>FileName. It was possible to custom-link the operating system to add or delete features. CTOS supported a transparent peer-to-peer network carried over serial [[EIA-422|RS-422]] cables (daisy-chain topolgy) and in later versions carried over twisted pair (star topology) with RS-422 adapters. Each workgroup (called a "cluster") was connected to a server (called a "master"). The workstations, normally [[diskless workstation|diskless]], were [[Network booting|booted over the cluster network]] from the master, and could optionally be locally booted from attached hard drives. The [[Inter-process communication]] (IPC) is primarily based on the "request" and "respond" messaging foundation that enhanced the Enterprise Application Integration among services for both internal and external environments. Thus CTOS was well known for the message-based Micro-Kernel Architecture. Applications are added as
