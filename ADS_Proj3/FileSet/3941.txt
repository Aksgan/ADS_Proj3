the challenge response was eliminated to produce a one-time password token similar to the [[SecurID]] product. Enigma Logic merged with Secure Computing Corporation in 1996. Secure Computing acquired the SmartFilter product line by purchasing Webster Network Strategies, the producer of the WebTrack product, in 2006.<ref name=buyWebster>[http://www.cbronline.com/news/secure_to_buy_webster_network_strategies Secure to Buy Webster Network Strategies], May 14, 1996; accessed November 2, 2008.</ref> The acquisition included the domain name [http://www.webster.com/ webster.com] which was eventually sold to the publishers of [[Webster's Dictionary]]. Shortly after acquiring the Webster/SmartFilter product, Secure Computing merged with Border Network Technologies, a Canadian company selling the [[Borderware]] firewall. Border Network Technologies boasted an excellent product and a highly developed set of sales channels; some said that the sales channels were a major inducement for the merger. Although the plan was to completely merge the Borderware product with Sidewinder, and to offer a single product to existing users of both products, this never quite succeeded. In 1998, the Borderware business unit was sold to a new company, Borderware Technologies Inc., formed by one of the original Borderware founders. By this time, the mergers yielded a highly distributed company with an office in [[Minnesota]], [[Florida]], [[California]], and two or three in [[Ontario]]. This proved unwieldy, and the company scaled back to offices in Minnesota and California. In 2002, the company took over the Gauntlet Firewall product from [[McAfee|Network Associates]]. In 2003, Secure Computing acquired [[N2H2]], the makers of the [[Bess]] web filtering package. There has been some consolidation of Bess and SmartFilter, and Bess is now referred to as "Smartfilter, Bess edition" in company literature. An acquisition of [[CyberGuard]] was announced in August 2005 and approved in January 2006. (A year earlier, CyberGuard had attempted to acquire Secure Computing, but the proposal had been rejected). The largest merger by Secure Computing at the time, it resulted in the addition of several product lines to the company, including three classes of firewalls, content and protocol filtering systems, and an enterprise-wide management system for controlling all of those products. Several offices were also added, including CyberGuard's main facility in [[Deerfield Beach, Florida]], as well as the Webwasher development office in [[Paderborn, Germany]], and a SnapGear development office in [[Brisbane, Australia]]. In 2006, the company merged with Atlanta-based [[CipherTrust]], a developer of email security solutions. The merger was announced in July 2006 and completed in August 2006. On July 30, 2008, Secure Computing announced its intention to sell the SafeWord authentication product line to [[Aladdin Knowledge Systems]], leaving the company with a business focused on web/mail security and firewalls. On September 22, 2008, McAfee announced its intention to acquire Secure Computing. The combined company would form the world's largest dedicated security company at the time. == Use of company products for governmental censorship == The [[OpenNet Initiative]] studied filtering software used by governments to block access by their citizens and found Secure Computing's SmartFilter program heavily used by both the Iranian and Saudi governments.<ref name=Dallas/><ref name=BBC/> According to Secure Computing, any use of its software in Iran is without its consent—[[Sanctions against Iran|U.S. sanctions prohibit]] American companies from any dealings with Iran—and in 2005 the company said it is actively working to stop its illegal use.<ref name=BBC/><ref name=New>[http://technology.newscientist.com/article/dn7589 Iranian net censorship powered by US technology], Will Knight, ''[[New Scientist]]'', June 27, 2005; accessed September 20, 2008.</ref><ref name=Info>[http://www.informationweek.com/news/management/trends/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=172301283 Secure Computing Tries to Block Illegal Downloads in Iran], K.C.

TrustedSource derives real-time reputation scores of IPs, URLs, domains, and mail/web content based on a variety of data mining/analysis techniques, such as [[Support Vector Machine]], [[Random forest]], and Term-Frequency Inverse-Document Frequency ([[TFIDF]]) classifiers. ==Web Security products== The company's flagship web security product line is the [[Secure Web]] appliance (formerly known as Webwasher). It provides Anti-Malware protection, [[TrustedSource]] reputation-enabled URL filtering controls, content caching and SSL scanning capabilities. In June 2008, Secure Computing launched [[Secure Web Protection Service]], an in-the-cloud hosted web security service that provides a similar set of features to the [[Secure Web]] appliance, without requiring any on-premise equipment or software. ==Mail Security products== The company's flagship email security product line is the [[Secure Mail]] appliance (formerly known as IronMail). It provides [[TrustedSource]] reputation-enabled anti-spam, data-leakage protection (DLP), encryption and anti-malware capabilities. ==Secure Firewalls== The company's flagship firewall product is now called McAfee Firewall Enterprise (formerly known as Sidewinder). Over the years, Secure Computing (and it's antecedent organizations) has offered the following major lines of firewall products: * Firewall
