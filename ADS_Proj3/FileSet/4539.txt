be perceived by the user as problematic if the equipment in question malfunctions. ===Interoperability=== Trusted Computing requests that all software and hardware vendors will follow the technical specifications released by the [[Trusted Computing Group]] in order to allow interoperability between different trusted software stacks. However, even now there are interoperability problems between the TrouSerS trusted software stack (released as open source software by [[IBM]]) and [[Hewlett-Packard]]'s stack.<ref>{{cite web | work = TrouSerS FAQ | url = http://trousers.sourceforge.net/faq.html#1.7 | title = 1.7 - I've taken ownership of my TPM under another OS... | accessdate = 2007-02-07 }}</ref> Another problem is the fact that the technical specifications are still changing, so it is unclear which is the standard implementation of the trusted stack. ===Shutting out of competing products=== People have voiced concerns that trusted computing could be used to keep or discourage users from running software created by companies outside of a small industry group. [[Microsoft]] has received a great deal of bad press surrounding their [[NGSCB|Palladium]] software architecture, evoking comments such as "Few pieces of vaporware have evoked a higher level of fear and uncertainty than Microsoft's Palladium", "Palladium is a plot to take over cyberspace", and "Palladium will keep us from running any software not personally approved by Bill Gates".<ref>[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1203224 E.W.

With this key it would be possible to have access to data encrypted with it, and to authenticate as it.<ref>These are the functions of the private key in [http://www.di-mgt.com.au/rsa_alg.html the RSA algorithm]</ref> It would be fairly trivial for a manufacturer to give a copy of this key to the government or the software manufacturers, as the platform must go through steps so that it works with authenticated software. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} In order to trust anything that is authenticated by or encrypted by a TPM or a Trusted computer, therefore, one has to trust the company that made that chip, the company that designed the chip, those companies allowed to make software for the chip, and the ability and interest of those companies to not compromise the process.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} It is also critical that one be able to trust that the hardware manufacturers and software developers properly implement trusted computing standards. Incorrect implementation could be hidden from users, and thus could undermine the integrity of the whole system without users being aware of the flaw.<ref name="schoen-promise-risk">[http://pascal.case.unibz.it/handle/2038/871 Seth Schoen, "Trusted Computing: Promise and Risk", ''COSPA Knowledge Base: Comparison, selection, & suitability of OSS'', April 11th, 2006.]</ref> == Hardware and software support == * Since 2004, most major manufacturers have shipped systems that have included [[Trusted Platform Module]]s, with associated [[BIOS]] support.<ref name="tpmvendors">{{cite web | url=http://www.tonymcfadden.net/tpmvendors_arc.html | title = TPM Matrix | author = Tony McFadden | date = March 26, 2006 | accessdate = 2006-05-05 }}</ref> In accordance with the TCG specifications, the user must enable the Trusted Platform Module before it can be used. * The [[Linux kernel]] has included trusted computing support since version 2.6.13, and there are several projects to implement trusted computing for Linux.
