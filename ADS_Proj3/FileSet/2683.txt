India'', p. 359.</ref> These priorities in turn affected the way negotiations took place when independence was discussed, especially between divided parties of Hindus and Muslims. Mountbatten was fond of [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] leader [[Nehru]] and his liberal outlook for the country. He felt differently about the Muslim leader Jinnah, but was aware of his power, stating "If it could be said that any single man held the future of India in the palm of his hand in 1947, that man was Mohammad Ali Jinnah.<ref name="SarJinna">SarDesai, ''India. The Definitive History'' (Boulder: Westview Press, 2008), p. 309-313.</ref> Whereas Jinnah argued for Muslim representation in a united India, Nehru and the British grew tired of negotiating and thought it would be better to give Muslims their own homeland rather than try to find a solution that Jinnah and the Indian National Congress would agree on.<ref name="Greenberg, Jonathan D. 2005">Greenberg, Jonathan D.

Including his years ast the last viceroy of India'', p. 355.</ref> He also concluded that the situation was too unsettled to wait any longer than 1947. This was to have disastrous consequences for the people of the sub-continent.The hastening of the process of the handover of power would unleash an orgy of violence and retribution never before seen in the Indian sub-continent. Among the Indian leaders, [[Gandhi]] emphatically insisted on maintaining a united India and for a while successfully rallied people to this goal. However, when Mountbatten's timeline put the prospect of actually attaining independence quickly, sentiments took a different turn. Given Mountbatten's determination, Nehru and Patel's inability to deal with the Muslim League and lastly Jinnah's obstinacy, all Indian party leaders (except Gandhi) were coming to accept the stance of Jinnah's plan of dividing India,<ref>Ziegler, ''Mountbatten. Including his years ast the last viceroy of India'', p. 373</ref> which in turn eased Mountbatten's task. This ironically resulted in a position which was essentially a bargaining tool for Jinnah to gain greater concessions becoming an end in itself. Mountbatten also developed a strong relationship with the Indian princes, who ruled those portions of India not directly under British rule. The historian Ramachandra Guha states in his book 'India After Gandhi' that Mountbatten intervention was decisive in persuading the vast majority of them to the advantages in opting for accession to the Indian Union. Thus the of the integration of the princely states can be viewed as one of the positive aspects of his legacy. When India and Pakistan attained independence in the night from 14 to 15 August 1947, Mountbatten remained in [[New Delhi]] for ten months, serving as India's first governor general until June 1948, thus becoming independent India's first Head of State. Notwithstanding his self-promotion of his own part in Indian independence — notably in the television series "The Life and Times of Admiral of the Fleet Lord Mountbatten of Burma", produced by his son-in-law [[John Knatchbull, 7th Baron Brabourne|Lord Brabourne]], and [[Dominique Lapierre]] and [[Larry Collins (writer)|Larry Collins]]'s rather sensationalised ''[[Freedom at Midnight]]'' (as to which he was the main informant) — his record is seen as very mixed; one prominent view is that he hastened the independence process unduly and recklessly, foreseeing vast disruption and loss of life and not wanting this to occur on the British watch, but thereby actually causing it to occur, especially in [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and [[Bengal]].<ref>See, e.g., Wolpert, Stanley (2006). ''Shameful Flight: The Last Years of the British Empire in India''.</ref> These critics contend that Mountbatten cannot escape responsibility for the way in which events spiraled out of control in the run up to and after independence. [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], the Canadian-American [[Harvard University]] economist, who advised governments of India during the 1950s, became an intimate of Nehru and served as the American ambassador from 1961–63, was a particularly harsh critic of Mountbatten in this regard. The horrific casualties of the partition of the Punjab are luridly described in Collins' and LaPierre's ''[[Freedom at Midnight]]'', as to which Mountbatten was the principal informant, and more latterly in [[Bapsi Sidhwa]]'s novel ''Ice Candy Man'' (published in the United States as ''[[Cracking India]]''), made into the film ''[[Earth (1998 film)|Earth]]''. ===Career after India and Pakistan=== After India, Mountbatten served from 1948–1950 as commander of a cruiser squadron in the Mediterranean Fleet. He then went on to serve as Fourth Sea Lord in the Admiralty from 1950–52 and then returned to the Mediterranean to serve as [[Mediterranean Fleet|Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet]] for three years. Mountbatten served his final posting in the Admiralty as First Sea Lord from 1955–59, the position which his father had held some forty years prior. This was the first time in Royal Naval history that a father and son had gained so high a rank.<ref>Patton, Allyson, ''Broadlands: Lord Mountbatten's Country Home'' in British Heritage, Vol. 26, Issue 1,March 2005, pp. 14-17. Accessed from Academic Search Complete on 13 May 2009.</ref> In his biography of Mountbatten, Philip Ziegler notes on his ambitious character: <blockquote> "His vanity, though child-like, was monstrous, his ambition unbridled. The truth, in his hands, was swiftly converted from what it was, to what it should have been. He sought to rewrite history with cavalier indifference to the facts to magnify his own achievements.
