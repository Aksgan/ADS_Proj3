The Food Safety and Inspection Service has approximately 7,800 inspection program personnel working in nearly 6,200 federally inspected meat, poultry and processed egg establishments. FSIS is charged with administering and enforcing the Federal [[Meat Inspection Act]], the Poultry Products Inspection Act, the Egg Products Inspection Act, portions of the [[Agricultural Marketing Act]], the [[Humane Slaughter Act]], and the regulations that implement these laws. FSIS inspection program personnel inspect every animal before slaughter, and each carcass after slaughter to ensure public health requirements are met. In fiscal year (FY) 2008, this included about 50 billion pounds of livestock carcasses, about 59 billion pounds of poultry carcasses, and about 4.3 billion pounds of processed egg products. At U.S. borders, they also inspected 3.3 billion pounds of imported meat and poultry products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/PDF/Testimony_Petersen_031109.pdf|title=FSIS Testimony, March 11, 2009|format=PDF}}</ref> =====Industry pressure===== There have been concerns over the efficacy of safety practices and food industry pressure on U.S. regulators. A study reported by Reuters found that "the food industry is jeopardizing U.S. public health by withholding information from food safety investigators or pressuring regulators to withdraw or alter policy designed to protect consumers". A survey found that 25% of U.S. government inspectors and scientists surveyed have experienced during the past year corporate interests forcing their food safety agency to withdraw or to modify agency policy or action that protects consumers. Scientists have observed that management undercuts field inspectors who stand up for food safety against industry pressure. According to Dr. Dean Wyatt, a USDA veterinarian who oversees federal slaughter house inspectors, "Upper level management does not adequately support field inspectors and the actions they take to protect the food supply. Not only is there lack of support, but there's outright obstruction, retaliation and abuse of power."<ref>Reuters, 14 September 2010, "Industry Has Sway Over Food Safety System: U.S. Study," http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE68C39320100913 free archived version at: http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2010/09/14-1</ref> ====State and local regulation==== A number of U.S. [[States of the United States|states]] have their own meat inspection programs that substitute for USDA inspection for meats that are sold only in-state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/regulations_&_policies/state_inspection_programs/index.asp|title=FSIS State Inspection Programs}}</ref> Certain state programs have been criticized for undue leniency to bad practices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerfed.org/pdfs/CFA_stmt_on_OIG_report_state_inspected_meat_9.28.06.pdf|title=USDA Allowed State Meat Inspection Programs To Operate Even After Finding Cutting Boards Contaminated With Old Meat And Soot-Like Residues On Swine Carcasses.|format=PDF}}</ref> However, other state food safety programs supplement, rather than replace, Federal inspections, generally with the goal of increasing consumer confidence in the state's produce. For example, state health departments have a role in investigating outbreaks of food-borne disease bacteria, as in the case of the 2006 outbreak of [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|''Escherichia coli'' O157:H7]] (bad ''E. coli'' bacteria) from processed spinach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.applications.dhs.ca.gov/pressreleases/store/pressreleases/06-76.html|title=State Health Department announces test results: Match genetic fingerprints to E. coli outbreak, Press Release, ben 0987, 8765.}}</ref> Health departments also promote better food processing practices to eliminate these threats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dhs.ca.gov/fdb/HTML/food/Education%20Unit/ETU%20Info%20Page/ETU%20Homepage.htm|title=CDHS Education Training Unit}}</ref> In addition to the [[US Food and Drug Administration]], several states that are major producers of fresh fruits and vegetables (including [[California]], [[Arizona]] and [[Florida]]) have their own state programs to test produce for [[pesticide]] residues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/dept/factshts/residu2.pdf|title=Pesticides and food: How we test for safety.

Typically these regulations require official inspections of specific design features, best food-handling practices, and certification of food handlers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/rii/index.shtml|title=New York Restaurant Inspection Information}}</ref> In some places a letter grade or numerical score must be prominently posted following each inspection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.healthylivingnyc.com/article/26|title=NYC Health Dept.

The relevant guidelines<ref>[http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/csctcooking.pdf Cooking]</ref> state that: <blockquote> "'''Cooking food until the CORE TEMPERATURE is 75 °C or above will ensure that harmful bacteria are destroyed.'''<br /> However, lower cooking temperatures are acceptable provided that the '''CORE''' '''TEMPERATURE''' '''is maintained for a specified period of time''' as follows :<br /> * 60 °C for a minimum of 45 minutes * 65 °C for a minimum of 10 minutes * 70 °C for a minimum of 2 minutes" </blockquote> Previous guidance from a leaflet produced by the UK Department Of Health “Handling Cooked Meats Safely A Ten Point Plan” also allowed for: <blockquote> *"75 °C for a minimum of 30 seconds * 80 °C for a minimum of 6 seconds" </blockquote> as well as the above.
