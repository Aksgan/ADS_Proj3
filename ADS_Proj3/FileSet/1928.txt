It is being developed by [[Paul Kunz]] at [[SLAC]], primarily for the analysis and presentation of [[particle physics]] and [[astrophysics]] data, but can be equally well used in other fields where data handling is important. HippoDraw can read and write files in an XML-based format, astrophysics [[FITS]] files, data objects produced by [[ROOT]] (optional), and via the python bindings, anything that can be read/write by python (hdf5, for instance, via pytables). HippoDraw can be used as a Python extension module, allowing users to use HippoDraw data objects with the full power of the Python language. This includes other scientific Python extension modules such Numeric and numarray, whose use with HippoDraw can lead to a large increase in processing speed, even for ROOT objects. <!-- is this still true? Both HippoDraw and [[Java Analysis Studio|JAS]] implement the [[AIDA (computing)|AIDA]] interface specifications, and as such can interoperate well. --> == See also == * [[Java Analysis Studio]] * [[ROOT]] * [[AIDA (computing)]] == External links == * {{official|http://www.slac.stanford.edu/grp/ek/hippodraw/}} [[Category:Numerical software]] [[Category:Data analysis software]] [[Category:Free plotting software]] [[Category:Free statistical software]] [[Category:Free software programmed in C++]] [[Category:Physics software]] [[Category:Public domain software]] [[Category:Linux graph plotting software]] [[Category:Linux science software]]</text> </page> <page> <id>16757</id> <title>Hisao Yamada</title> <text>{{Infobox scientist | image = | image_size = | name = Hisao Yamada | birth_date = | birth_place = | birth_name = | death_date = | death_place = | residence = | citizenship = | field = [[Computer science]] | work_institution = | alma_mater = [[University of Pennsylvania]] | doctoral_advisor = [[Robert McNaughton]] | notable_students = [[Rao Kosaraju]] | known_for = | prizes = | footnotes = }} '''Hisao M. Yamada''' (? - May 21, 2008, age 77) was a Japanese [[computer scientist]], known for his influential contributions to [[theoretical computer science]], as well as for the development of Japanese keyboard layouts, a challenging practical problem. From 1972 to 1991, he was professor of the [[formal languages]] division at the Department for Information Science at the [[University of Tokyo]]. ==Work== In the field of theoretical computer science, Yamada introduced the notion of real-time computability. As his colleague [[Aravind Joshi]] recalls: {{quote|This work was very positively reviewed not only in the computer science related journals but also in other theoretical journals such as the Journal of Symbolic Logic. Dr. Yamada’s work also played a key role in the early days of the field of computational complexity, by now a very well established area in computer science. |Aravind Joshi|As cited in: University of Pennnsylvania Almanac '''55'''(2), p. 3. }} ==Selected Publications== * {{cite doi|http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TEC.1960.5221603}} * {{cite doi|http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TEC.1962.5219459}} * Hisao Yamada: "A Historical Study of Typewriters and Typing Methods: from the Position of Planning Japanese Parallels", Journal of Information Processing, '''2'''(4) (February 1980), pp. 175–202 ==References== * [http://www.upenn.edu/almanac/volumes/v55/n02/contents.html ''Deaths: Dr. Hisao Yamada, SEAS.''] University of Pennnsylvania Almanac '''55'''(2), p. 3 * [http://www.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/english/history.html ''History''], University of Tokyo, Department of Information Science ==External links== * {{cite web | url = http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/y/Yamada:Hisao.html | title = Hisao Yamada Bibliography | publisher = [[Digital Bibliography & Library Project|The DBLP Computer Science Bibliography]] | accessdate = 2010-12-12}} *{{MathGenealogy|id=53467}} [[Category:Japanese computer scientists]] [[Category:Theoretical computer scientists]] [[Category:2008 deaths]]</text> </page> <page> <id>16767</id> <title>History</title> <text>{{About|the academic discipline| a general history of human beings|History of the world|other uses}} {{pp-move-indef}} {{Quote box |width = 250px |quote = Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.<ref>George Santayana, "The Life of Reason", Volume One, p. 82, BiblioLife, ISBN 978-0559478062</ref> |source = —[[George Santayana]] }} [[File:Gyzis 006 (Ηistoria).jpeg|thumb|Historia (Allegory of History)<br />By [[Nikolaos Gysis]] (1892)]] '''History''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|''ἱστορία''}} - ''historia'', meaning "inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation"<ref name=JosephJanda/>) is the study of the human [[past]]. History can also mean the period of time after writing was invented. Scholars who write about history are called [[historian]]s.
