The system is comparable to the [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] in scope, aims and structure, being used by the various ACM journals to organise subjects by area. ==History== The system has gone through six revisions, the first version being published in 1964, and revised versions appearing in 1982, 1983, 1987, 1991, and the now current version in 1998. ==Structure== The ACM Computing Classification System is hierarchically structured in four levels: three outer levels, coded by capital letters and numbers, and an uncoded fourth level of subject descriptors. Thus, for example, one branch of the hierarchy contains :I. Computing Methodologies, which contains: ::I.2 [[Artificial Intelligence]], which contains: :::I.2.4 [[Knowledge representation formalisms and methods]], which contains: ::::''[[Temporal logic]]''. Each top-level category has two standard subcategories: "general", coded with a "0", and "miscellaneous", coded with a "m". For instance, I.0 denotes the "general" subcategory of Computing Methodologies, while I.m denotes its miscellaneous subcategory. Several subtopics are listed as uncoded subject descriptors in these standard subcategories. {{Navbox |name = ACM Computing Classification System |title = ACM Computing Classification System |image = |above = The 1998 version of the ACM classification has the following main categories. |group1 = Section A |group2 = Section B |group3 = Section C |group4 = Section D |group5 = Section E |group6 = Section F |group7 = Section G |group8 = Section H |group9 = Section I |group10 = Section J |group11 = Section K |list1 = is for general computing literature. It includes subtopics for introductory and survey material, and for reference works. |list2 = on hardware, has subtopics for [[Control unit|control structures]] and [[Microcode|microprogramming]], [[Arithmetic logic unit|arithmetic and logic structures]], [[Computer storage|memory structures]], [[Input/output|input/output and data communications]], [[Register transfer level|register-transfer-level implementation]], [[logic design]], [[integrated circuit]]s, and [[Performance tuning|performance]] and [[Reliability engineering|reliability]]. |list3 = concerns [[Computer organization|computer systems organization]]. The subtopics of this section are [[Central processing unit|processor architectures]], [[Computer networking|computer-communication networks]], special-purpose and application-based systems, [[Performance tuning|performance of systems]], and [[Implementation|computer system implementation]]. |list4 = is entitled [[Software]]. This section includes two subtopics on software development: programming techniques and [[software engineering]]. Two more subtopics concern the software infrastructure needed to run other software: [[programming language]]s and [[operating system]]s. |list5 = pertains [[data]], includes subtopics on [[data structure]]s, data storage representations, [[Encryption|data encryption]], [[Coding theory|coding]] and [[information theory]], and [[Computer file|file]]s. |list6 = includes several topics from the [[theory of computation]]: [[Abstract machine|computation by abstract devices]], [[analysis of algorithms]] and [[Computational complexity theory|problem complexity]], [[Formal methods|logics and meanings of programs]], [[mathematical logic]], and [[formal language]]s. |list7 = contains topics involving the mathematics of computing. Its subtopics are [[numerical analysis]], [[discrete mathematics]], [[probability and statistics]], and [[mathematical software]]. |list8 = pertains to [[information systems]]. It includes subtopics for models and principles, [[Database|database management]], information storage and [[Information retrieval|retrieval]], information systems applications, and information interfaces and presentation (e.g., [[Human-computer interaction|HCI]]). |list9 = on computing methodologies, covers a diverse set of subtopics concerning different application areas of computation: [[Symbolic mathematics|symbolic and algebraic manipulation]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[computer graphics]], [[image processing]] and [[computer vision]], [[pattern recognition]], [[Computer simulation|simulation and modeling]], and [[Document processing|document and text processing]]. |list10 = also covers computer applications, but with a focus more on the different application areas and less on the different styles of computation one does in each of those areas. Its subtopics are administrative data processing, [[Scientific computing|physical sciences and engineering]], [[Bioinformatics|life and medical sciences]], social and behavioral sciences, [[Digital art|arts]] and [[The Digital Humanities|humanities]], [[computer-aided engineering]], and computers in other systems. |list11 = has as its title Computing Milieux. The subtopics of this section are [[Computer industry|the computer industry]], [[History of computer science|history of computing]], [[Educational technology|computers and education]], computers and society, [[legal aspects of computing]], management of computing and information systems, the computing profession, and [[Personal computer|personal computing]]. }} == See also == {{Portal|Computer Science}} ==References== *{{citation | last = Coulter | first = Neal | doi = 10.1145/265563.265579 | issue = 12 | journal = Communications of the ACM | location = New York, NY, USA | pages = 111–112 | publisher = ACM | title = ACM's computing classification system reflects changing times | volume = 40 | year = 1997}}. *{{citation | last1 = Coulter | first1 = Neal | last2 = French | first2 = James | last3 = Glinert | first3 = Ephraim | last4 = Horton | first4 = Thomas | last5 = Mead | first5 = Nancy | last6 = Rada | first6 = Roy | last7 = Ralston | first7 = Anthony | last8 = Rodkin | first8 = Craig | last9 = Rous | first9 = Bernard | journal = Computing Reviews | location = New York, NY, USA | publisher = ACM | pages = 1–5 | title = Computing Classification System 1998: Current Status and Future Maintenance Report of the CCS Update Committee | url = http://www.acm.org/about/class/ccsup.pdf | year = 1998 | last = Wierzbicki | first = Carol}}. *{{citation | last1 = Mirkin | first1 = Boris | last2 = Nascimento | first2 = Susana | last3 = Pereira | first3 = Luis Moniz | contribution = Representing a Computer Science Research Organization on the ACM Computing Classification System | editor1-last = Eklund | editor1-first = Peter | editor2-last = Haemmerlé | editor2-first = Ollivier | pages = 57–65 | publisher = RWTH Aachen University | series = CEUR Workshop Proceedings | title = Supplementary Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Conceptual Structures (ICCS-2008) | url = http://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/Publications/CEUR-WS/Vol-354/p19.pdf | volume = 354 | year = 2008}}. ==External links== * [http://www.acm.org/class/ ACM Computing Classification System] is the homepage of the system, including links to three complete versions of the system, for 1964
