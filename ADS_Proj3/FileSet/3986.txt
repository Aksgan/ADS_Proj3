Earlier 72-pin [[SIMM]]s included 5 pins which provided 5 bits of ''parallel presence detect'' (PPD) data, but the 168-pin [[DIMM]] standard changed to a serial presence detect to encode much more information.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EKF/is_n2153_v43/ai_19102210/ |title=Serial Presence Detection poised for limelight |author1=Thomas P.

Since about the mid-1990s, this process includes automatically configuring the hardware currently present. SPD is a memory hardware feature that makes it possible for the computer to know what memory is present, and what [[Dynamic random access memory#Memory_timing|timings]] to use to access the memory. Some computers adapt to hardware changes completely automatically. In most cases, there is a special optional procedure for accessing [[BIOS]] parameters, to view and potentially make changes in settings. It may be possible to control how the computer uses the memory SPD data—to choose which settings to use, to selectively modify the memory timings, or possibly to completely over-ride the SPD data (see [[overclocking]]). ==Stored information== In order for a memory module to support SPD, the [[JEDEC]] standards require certain parameters to be placed in the lower 128 bytes of an [[EEPROM]] located on the memory module. These bytes contain timing parameters, manufacturer, serial number and other useful information about the module. This data allows a device utilizing the memory to automatically determine key parameters of the module. For example, the SPD data on an [[SDRAM]] module might provide information about the [[CAS latency]], allowing this to be correctly set without user intervention. The SPD EEPROM is accessed using [[SMBus]], a variant of the [[I²C]] protocol. This reduces the number of communication pins on the module to just two: a clock signal and a data signal. The EEPROM shares ground pins with the RAM, has its own power pin, and has three additional pins (SA0–2) to identify the slot, which are used to assign the EEPROM a unique address in the range 0x50–0x57. Not only can the communication lines be shared among 8 memory modules, the same SMBus is commonly used on motherboards for system health monitoring tasks such as reading power supply voltages, [[Central processing unit|CPU]] temperatures, and fan speeds. (SPD EEPROMs also respond to I²C addresses 0x30–0x37 if they have not been write protected, and an extension uses addresses 0x18–0x1F to access an optional on-chip temperature sensor.<ref>[http://www.jedec.org/download/search/4_01_04R18.pdf JEDEC Standard 21-C section 4.1.4] "Definition of the TSE2002av Serial Presence Detect (SPD) EEPROM with Temperature Sensor (TS) for Memory Module Applications"</ref>) ===SDR SDRAM=== [[File:SPD SDRAM.jpg|thumb|Memory device onto an [[SDRAM]] module, containing ''SPD'' data (red circled)]] The first SPD specification was issued by JEDEC and tightened up by Intel as part of its [[PC100]] memory specification.<ref>[http://www.memorytesters.com/ramcheck/rc_ap3.htm Application note INN-8668-APN3: SDRAM SPD Data Standards], memorytesters.com</ref> Most values specified are in [[binary coded decimal]] form. The most significant nibble can contain values from 10 to 15, and in some cases extends higher. In such cases, the encodings for 1, 2 and 3 are instead used to encode 16, 17 and 18. A most significant nibble of 0 is reserved to represent "undefined". The SPD ROM defines up to three DRAM timings, for three CAS latencies specified by set bits in byte 18. First comes the highest CAS latency (fastest clock), then two lower CAS latencies with progressively lower clock speeds. {|class=wikitable |+ SPD contents for SDR SDRAM<ref name=spd_pc100>{{Citation |url=http://www.softnology.biz/pdf/SPDSDRAM1.2a.pdf |title=PC SDRAM Serial Presence Detect (SPD) Specification |date=December 1997 |version=1.2A |pages=28}}</ref> !
