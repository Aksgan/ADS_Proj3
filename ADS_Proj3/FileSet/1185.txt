want in a single chassis. The VT52 was followed by the even more successful [[VT100]] and its follow-ons, making DEC one of the largest terminal vendors in the industry. With the VT series, DEC could now offer a complete top-to-bottom system from computer to all peripherals, which formerly required collecting the required devices from different suppliers. The VAX processor architecture and family of systems evolved and expanded through several generations during the 1980s, culminating in the [[NVAX]] [[microprocessor]] implementation and [[VAX 7000/10000]] series in the early 1990s.<ref name="nvax">[http://simh.trailing-edge.com/semi/nvax.html DEC Microprocessors: NVAX (1991)]</ref> ===Early microcomputers=== The introduction of the first general purpose [[microprocessor]]s inevitably led to the first [[microcomputers]] around 1975. At the time these systems were of limited utility, and Ken Olsen famously derided them in 1977, stating "There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home."<ref>Olsen later claimed he was referring to home automation, see [http://www.snopes.com/quotes/kenolsen.asp "Ken Olsen"]</ref> Unsurprisingly, DEC did not put much effort into the microcomputer area in the early days of the market. In the 1980s, DEC built the [[VT180]] (codenamed "Robin"), which was a [[VT100]] terminal with a [[Zilog Z80|Z80]]-based microcomputer running [[CP/M]]. It was only after IBM had successfully launched the [[IBM PC]] that DEC responded with their own systems. Digital responded by introducing not one, but three incompatible machines which were tied to [[Proprietary hardware|proprietary]] architectures. The first, the [[DEC Professional (computer)|DEC Professional]], was based on the PDP-11/23 (the 11/73) running the RSX-11M+ derived, menu-driven, P/OS. The idea was to introduce a machine that outperformed the PC, but in doing so they created one that was more difficult to learn and use{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} than PC-DOS or [[CP/M]] which were more commonly used on the 8080 and 8088 based microcomputers of the time. The [[DECmate]] was the latest version of the PDP-8 based word processors, but not really suited to general computing, nor competitive with [[Wang Laboratories]] word processing that was becoming popular. The best known of DEC's early microcomputers is the [[Rainbow 100]], which ran an 8086 implementation of [[CP/M-86|CP/M]]. Applications from standard CP/M could be re-compiled for the Rainbow, but, by this time, users were expecting custom-built applications such as [[Lotus 1-2-3]], which was eventually ported along with [[MS-DOS]] 2.0 and introduced in late 1983. Users also objected to having to buy preformatted floppy disks. Although the Rainbow generated some press, it was unsuccessful due to its high price and lack of marketing and sales support.<ref name="rainbow-faq">{{cite web|title=The Rainbow 100 Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://rainbow-100.com/faq/question/1/|work=Drive W|publisher=Approximatrix, LLC|accessdate=15 December 2010|year=2009}}</ref> A further system was introduced in 1986 as the [[VAXmate]], which included [[Microsoft Windows 1.0]] and used [[VAX/VMS]]-based file and print servers along with integration into DEC's own [[DECnet]]-family, providing LAN/WAN connection from PC to mainframe or supermini. The VAXmate replaced the Rainbow and in its standard form was the first diskless workstation. ===Networking and clusters=== In 1984, DEC launched its first 10 Mbit/s Ethernet. Ethernet allowed scalable networking, and [[VAXcluster]] allowed scalable computing. Combined with [[DECnet]] and Ethernet-based terminal servers ([[Local Area Transport|LAT]]), DEC had produced a networked storage architecture which allowed them to compete directly with IBM. Ethernet replaced [[token ring]], and went on to become the dominant networking model in use today. In September 1985, DEC became the [[List of the oldest currently-registered Internet domain names|fifth company to register]] a [[.com]] [[domain name]] (dec.com). Along with the hardware and protocols, DEC also introduced the [[VAXcluster]] concept, which allowed several VAX machines to be tied together into a single larger storage system. VAXclusters allowed a DEC-based company to scale their services by adding new machines to the cluster at any time, as opposed to buying a faster machine and using that to replace a slower one. The flexibility this offered was compelling, and allowed DEC to attack high-end markets formerly out of their reach. ===Diversification=== Although their microcomputer efforts were eventually considered failures, the PDP-11 and VAX lines continued to sell in record numbers. Better yet, DEC was competing very well against the market leader, IBM, taking an estimated $2 billion away from them in the mid-80s. In 1986, Digital's profits rose 38 percent when the rest of the computer industry experienced a downturn, and by 1987 the company was threatening IBM's number one position in the computer industry.<ref name=companyhistory>[http://www.answers.com/topic/digital-equipment-corporation "Digital Equipment Corporation"], ''International Directory of Company Histories'', Volume 6, St. James Press, 1992</ref> At its peak, Digital was the second-largest computer company in the world, with over 100,000 employees. It was during this time that the company branched out development into a wide variety of projects that were far from its core business in computer equipment. The company invested heavily in custom software. In the 1970s and earlier most software was custom-written to serve a specific task, but by the 1980s the introduction of [[relational databases]] and similar systems allowed powerful software to be built in a modular fashion, potentially saving enormous amounts of development time. Software companies like [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] became the new darlings of the industry, and DEC started their own efforts in every "hot" niche, in some cases several projects for the same niche. Some of these products competed with DEC's own partners, notably [[Rdb]] which competed with Oracle's products on the VAX, part of a major partnership only a few years earlier. Although many of these products were well designed, most of them were DEC-only or DEC-centric, and customers frequently ignored them and used third-party products instead. This problem was further exacerbated by Olsen's aversion to traditional advertising and his belief that well-engineered products would sell themselves. Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on these projects, at the same time that workstations using [[RISC]] microprocessors were starting to approach VAX CPUs in performance. ===Faltering in the market=== As microprocessors continued to improve in the 1980s, it soon became clear that the next generation would offer performance and features equal to the best of DECs low-end minicomputer lineup. Worse, the [[Berkeley RISC]] and [[MIPS architecture|Stanford MIPS]] designs were aiming to introduce 32-bit
