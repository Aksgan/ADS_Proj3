the "[[information model]]" and * the "[[business process model]]". All relevant objects of an enterprise, their qualities and relations are shown in the "information model". It is class trees of the object classes "product", "order" and "resource" here. The "business process model" represents enterprise processes and their relations to each other. Activities are shown in their interaction with the objects. ===Process modeling=== The structuring of the enterprise processes in Integrated Enterprise Modeling (IEM) is reached by its hierarchical subdivision with the help of the decomposition. Decomposition means the reduction of a system in a partial system which respectively contains components which are in a logical cohesion. The process modeling is a partitioning of processes into its threads. Every thread describes a task completed into itself. The [[Decomposition (computer science)|decomposition]] of single processes can be carried out long enough until the threads are manageable, i.e. appropriately small. They may turn out also not too rudimentary because a high number of detailed processes increases the complexity of a business process model. A process modeling person therefore have to find a balance between the effort complexity degree of the model and possible detailed description of the enterprise processes. A model depth generally recommends itself with at most three to four decomposition levels (model levels). <center><gallery> Image:elemente 1 Sequenz.jpg|Sequential order Image:Elemente 2 Verzweigung.jpg|Parallel branching Image:Elemente 3 Fallunterscheidung.jpg|Case distinction Image:Elemente 4 Zusammenfuehrung.jpg|Uniting Image:Elemente 5 Schleife.jpg|Loop </gallery></center> On a model level business process flows are represented with the aid of illustrated combination elements. There are these five basic types of combinations between the activities: * Sequential orde: At a sequential order the activities are executed after each other. * Parallel branching: A parallel branching means that all parallel branched activities to be executed have to be completed before the following activity can be started with. It is not necessary that the parallel activities are executed at the same time. They can be deferredly carried out, too. * Case distinction: Decision either or. The case distinction is a branching in alternative processes depending on definition of the subsequent conditions. * Uniting: The end of a parallel as the case may be alternative execution or also an integration of process chains is indicated by the uniting. * Loop: A repatriation (loop, cycle) is represented by means of case distinction and uniting. The activities included in the loop are executed as long as the condition for the continuation is given. ===Modeling proceeding=== The modeling procedure for the illustration of business processes in IEM covers the following steps: * System [[delimitation]], * Modeling, * Model evaluation and use, * Model change. The ''system delimitation'' is the base of an efficient modeling. Starting out from a conceptual formulation the area of the real system to be shown is selected and interfaces will be defined to an environment. In addition, the detail depth of the model is also determined, i.e. the depth of the hierarchical decomposition relations in the view "business process model". The delimited real system is convicted with help of the IEM method in an abstract model. IEM is the construction of the two main positions "information model" and "business process model". The "information model" is made by the specification of the object classes to be modeled for "product", "order" and "resource" with the class structures as well as descriptive and relational features. By identification and description of functions, activities and its combination to processes the "business process model" is formed. As a general rule the construction of the "information model" follows first in which the modeling person can go back to available reference class structures. The reference classes which do not correspond to the real system or were not found to be relevant at the system delimitation are deleted. The missing relevant classes are inserted. After the object base is fixed, the activities and functions are joined together at the objects according to the "generic activity model" and with the help of combination elements to business processes. A model is made which can be analysed and changed if it's required. It often happens, that during the construction of the "business process model" new relevant object classes are identified so that the class trees getting completed. The construction of the two positions is therefore an iterative process. Afterwards weak points and improvement potentials can be identified in the course of the ''model evaluation''. This can cause the ''model changes'' whose realization should clear the weak points and make use of the improvement potentials in the real system. ===Modeling tool MO²GO=== The software tool MO²GO (method for an object-oriented business process optimization) supports the modeling process based on the integrated enterprise modeling (IEM). Different analyses of a given model are available like the planning and implementation of information systems. The MO²GO system is expandable easily and makes a high-speed modeling approach possible. The currently used MO²GO system consists of the following components: * MO²GO version 2.4: This component offers modeling functions for class structures, process chains and mechanism for analysis of IEM. * MO²GO Macro editor version 2.1 : The macro editor supports the outline of MO²GO [[Macro (computer science)|macros]] for user-defined evaluation procedures. * MO²GO Viewer version 1.07 : The Java based and licence free MO²GO Viewer is a user interface to be used easily to navigate process chains through MO²GO. * MO²GO XML converter version 1.0 : Nowadays the IT implementation works mainly with [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] diagrams. MO²GO supports a component for a model based [[Xml|XML]] file which can be imported in [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] tools. * MO²GO Web publisher version 2.0 : The web Publisher is a mechanism of analysis to be started directly out of MO²GO 2.4. A process assistant is the result of the evaluation of the model contents based on texture and [[hyperlink]] representation. To be able to adapt the process assistant to the user requirements flexibly, the web Publisher contains a configuration component. ===MO²GO Process assistant=== [[Image:screenshot prozessassistent.jpg|300px|thumb|Prozess assistant]] The IEM business process models contain much information which can not only be used
