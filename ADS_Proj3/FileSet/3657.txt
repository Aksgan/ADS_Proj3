or not) can be simulated by a circuit of Toffoli gates. Obviously, if the mapping fails to be [[injective]], at some point in the simulation (for example as the last step) some garbage has to be produced. For quantum circuits a similar composition of qubit gates can be defined. That is associated to any ''classical assemblage'' as above, we can produce a reversible quantum circuit when in place of ''f'' we have an ''n'' qubit gate ''U'' and in place of ''g'' we have an ''m'' qubit gate ''W''. See illustration below: <center> [[Image:Quantum_circuit_composition.svg|300px]] </center> The fact that connecting gates this way gives rise to a unitary mapping on ''n''+''m''-''k'' qubit space is an easy check, which should not concern the non-expert reader {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. It should also be noted that in a real quantum computer the physical connection between the gates is a major engineering challenge, since it is one of the places where [[decoherence]] may actually occur. There is also a [[Quantum_gate#Universal_quantum_gates|universality theorem]] for sets of well known gates; such a universality theorem exists for instance, for the pair consisting of the single qubit phase gate ''U''<sub>θ</sub> mentioned above for some reasonable value of θ together with the 2 qubit CNOT gate ''W''<sub>CNOT</sub>). However the universality theorem is somewhat weaker in the case of quantum computation, namely that any reversible ''n'' qubit circuit can be ''approximated'' arbitrarily well by circuits assembled from these two elementary gates. Note that there are [[uncountable|uncountably]] many possible single qubit phase gates, one for every possible angle θ, so uncountably many of these gates cannot be represented by any finite circuit constructed from {''U''<sub>θ</sub>, ''W''<sub>CNOT</sub>)}. == Quantum computations == So far we have not shown how quantum circuits are used to perform computations. Since many important numerical problems reduce to computing a unitary transformation ''U'' on a finite dimensional space (the celebrated [[discrete Fourier transform]] being a prime example) one might expect that some quantum circuit could be designed to carry out the transformation ''U''. In principle, one needs only to prepare a ''n'' qubit state ψ as an appropriate superposition of computational basis states for the input and measure the output ''U''ψ. Unfortunately, there are two problems with this: * One cannot measure the phase of ψ at any computational basis state so there is no way of reading out the complete answer. This is in the nature of [[measurement in quantum mechanics]]. * There is no way to efficiently prepare the input state ψ. This does not prevent quantum circuits for the discrete Fourier transform from being used as intermediate steps in other quantum circuits, but the use is more subtle. In fact quantum computations are ''probabilistic''. We now provide a mathematical model for how quantum circuits can simulate ''probabilistic'' but classical computations. Consider an ''r''-qubit circuit ''U'' with register space ''H''<sub>QB(''r'')</sub>. ''U'' is thus a unitary map :<math>H_{\operatorname{QB}(r)} \rightarrow H_{\operatorname{QB}(r)}.</math> In order to associate this circuit to a classical mapping on bitstrings, we specify * An ''input register'' ''X'' = {0,1}<sup>''m''</sup> of ''m'' (classical) bits. * An ''output register'' ''Y'' = {0,1}<sup>''n''</sup> of ''n'' (classical) bits. The contents ''x'' = ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''m''</sub> of the classical input register are used to initialize the qubit register in some way. Ideally, this would be done with the computational basis state :<math> |\vec{x},0\rangle= | x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n, \underbrace{0, \dots, 0} \rangle </math> where there are ''r''-''m'' underbraced zeroed inputs. Nevertheless, this perfect initialization is completely unrealistic. Let us assume therefore that the initialization is a mixed state given by some density operator ''S'' which is near the idealized input in some appropriate metric, e.g. :<math> \operatorname{Tr}\left(\big||\vec{x},0\rangle \langle \vec{x},0 | - S\big|\right) \leq \delta </math> Similarly, the output register space is related to the qubit register, by a ''Y'' valued observable ''A''. Note that observables in quantum mechanics are usually defined in terms of ''projection valued measures'' on '''R'''; if the variable happens to be discrete, the projection valued measure reduces to a family {E<sub>λ</sub>} indexed on some parameter λ ranging over a countable set. Similarly, a ''Y'' valued observable, can be associated with a family of pairwise orthogonal projections {E<sub>''y''</sub>} indexed by elements of ''Y''. such that :<math> I = \sum_{y \in Y} \operatorname{E}_y. </math> Given a mixed state ''S'', there corresponds a probability measure on ''Y'' given by :<math> \operatorname{Pr}\{y\} = \operatorname{Tr}(S \operatorname{E}_y ) </math> <blockquote> The function ''F'':''X'' → ''Y'' is computed by a circuit ''U'':''H''<sub>QB(''r'')</sub> → ''H''<sub>QB(''r'')</sub> to within ε if and only if for all bitstrings ''x'' of length ''m'' :<math>\left\langle \vec{x},0 \big| U^* \operatorname{E}_{F(x)} U \big|\vec{x},0 \right\rangle = \left\langle \operatorname{E}_{F(x)} U( |\vec{x},0\rangle) \big| U( |\vec{x},0\rangle) \right\rangle \geq 1 - \epsilon</math> </blockquote> Now :<math> \left| \operatorname{Tr} (S U^* \operatorname{E}_{F(x)} U) - \left\langle \vec{x},0 \big| U^* \operatorname{E}_{F(x)} U \big|\vec{x},0 \right\rangle\right|\leq \operatorname{Tr} (\big||\vec{x},0\rangle \langle \vec{x},0 | - S\big|) \| U^* \operatorname{E}_{F(x)} U \| \leq \delta </math> so that :<math>\operatorname{Tr} (S U^* \operatorname{E}_{F(x)} U) \geq 1 - \epsilon - \delta</math> '''Theorem'''. If ε+ δ <1/2, then the probability distribution :<math> \operatorname{Pr}\{y\} = \operatorname{Tr} (S U^* \operatorname{E}_{y} U)</math> on ''Y'' can be used to determine ''F''(''x'') with an arbitrarily small probability of error by majority sampling, for a sufficiently large sample size. Specifically, take ''k'' independent samples from the probability distribution Pr on ''Y'' and choose a value on which more than half of the samples agree. The probability that the value ''F''(''x'') is sampled more than ''k''/2 times is at least :<math> 1 - e^{- 2 \gamma^2 k} </math> where γ = 1/2 -ε - δ.
