is to share the same reality or line of thinking with another physical or conceptual entity. Author [[Robert A. Heinlein]] coined the term in his best-selling 1961 book ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]].'' In Heinlein's view, grokking is the intermingling of intelligence that necessarily affects both the observer and the observed. From the novel: {{quote|Grok means to understand so thoroughly that the observer becomes a part of the observed—to merge, blend, intermarry, lose identity in group experience. It means almost everything that we mean by religion, philosophy, and science—and it means as little to us (because of our Earthly assumptions) as color means to a blind man.}} The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines ''grok'' as "to understand intuitively or by empathy; to establish [[rapport]] with" and "to empathize or communicate sympathetically (with); also, to experience enjoyment." Other forms of the word include "groks" (present [[Grammatical person|third person]] singular), "grokked" (past [[participle]]) and "grokking" (present participle). The OED definition is incorrect in that it is incomplete; the given, narrow, definition of this term is beset by the challenges of similar, more encompassing terms such as '''gestalt''' and '''quiddity''' that reference a much broader frame than we normally recognize. Heinlein introduced the word 'grok' into our language, for which there is no equivalent.{{cn|date=January 2011}} There are a number of (more recent) allusions to it, and the song '[[I See You (Theme from Avatar)|I See You]]' from the 2009 film [[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]] comes close. To '''grok''' something is both to comprehend (relate intellectually) and to apprehend (relate emotionally and spiritually) its quiddity, its essence, its being. In an ideological context, a ''grokked'' concept becomes part of the person who contributes to its evolution by improving the doctrine, perpetuating the myth, espousing the belief, adding detail to the social plan, refining the idea or [[Integrity#Testing theories via the Scientific Method|proving]] the theory. ==Etymology== ===''Stranger in a Strange Land''=== Robert A. Heinlein originally [[neologism|coined]] the term ''grok'' in his 1961 novel ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' as a [[Martian]] word that could not be defined in earthly terms, but can be associated with various literal meanings such as "water", "to drink", "life", or "to live", and had a much more profound figurative meaning that is hard for Earthers to understand because of our assumption of a singular reality. According to the book, drinking is a central focus on Mars, where water is scarce. Martians use the merging of their bodies with water as a simple example or symbol of how two entities can combine to create a new reality greater than the sum of its parts. The water becomes part of the drinker, and the drinker part of the water. Both ''grok'' each other. Things that once had separate realities become entangled in the same experiences, goals, history, and purpose. Within the book, the statement of [[Divinity|divine]] [[immanence]] verbalized between the main characters, "[[Thou Art God]]", is logically derived from the concept inherent in the term ''grok''. Heinlein describes Martian words as "guttural" and "jarring". Martian speech is described as sounding "like a bullfrog fighting a cat". Accordingly, ''grok'' is generally pronounced as a guttural "gr" terminated by a sharp "k" with very little or no vowel sound (a narrow [[help:IPA|IPA]] transcription might be {{IPA|[ɡɹ̩kʰ]}}). ==Adoption and modern usage== ===In counterculture=== {{see also|Counterculture of the 1960s}} [[Tom Wolfe]], in his book ''[[The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test]]'', describes a character's thoughts during an [[acid trip]]: "He looks down, two bare legs, a torso rising up at him and like he is just noticing them for the first time... he has never seen any of this flesh before, this stranger. He groks over that...." Contemporary spiritual teacher [[Ram Dass]], in ''Be Here Now'', quotes a large passage from ''Stranger'' about the word. Numerous examples of its use in the late 1960s appear, including in ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''[[The New Yorker]]''. The word is also used in passing in ''[[The Illuminatus Trilogy]]'' by [[Robert Anton Wilson]] and [[Robert Shea]], and frequently by Wilson in his other work. In his 1969 counterculture Volkswagen repair manual, ''How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive: A Manual of Step-By-Step Procedures for the Compleat Idiot'', John Muir instructs prospective used VW buyers to "grok the car" before buying. According to Ed Sanders' book ''The Family'', convicted murderer [[Charles Manson]] was a fan of Heinlein and ''Stranger'' and adopted many of the terms associated with both including "grok" and "thou art God".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Family |author=Ed Sanders |isbn= ISBN 1-56025-396-7 |year=2002 |publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press}}</ref> ===In science fiction=== A popular [[t-shirt]] and [[bumper sticker]] slogan for [[Trekkie]]s, seen as early as 1967, was ''I grok [[Mr. Spock|Spock]]'' (often showing the [[Star Trek]] character using the [[Vulcan salute]]). Other [[science fiction]] authors, such as [[David Brin]] or [[Greg Cox]], have borrowed the term over the years as an [[homage]]. In the book ''Daniel X: Watch the Skies,'' the main character, Daniel, uses the term several times over the course of the book. ===In hacker culture=== Uses of the word in the decades after the 1960s are more concentrated in [[computer culture]], such as a 1984 appearance in [[InfoWorld]]: "There isn't any software! Only different internal states of hardware. It's all hardware! It's a shame programmers don't grok that better." The [[Jargon File]], which describes itself as a "Hacker's Dictionary" and has thrice been published under that name, puts ''grok'' in a programming context: {{quote|When you claim to 'grok' some knowledge or technique, you are asserting that you have not merely learned it in a detached instrumental way but that it has become part of you, part of your identity. For example, to say that you "know" [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] is simply to assert that you can code in it if necessary — but to say you "grok" LISP is to claim that you have deeply entered the world-view and spirit of the language, with the implication that it has transformed your view of programming. Contrast [[zen]], which is a similar supernatural understanding experienced as a single brief flash.}}
