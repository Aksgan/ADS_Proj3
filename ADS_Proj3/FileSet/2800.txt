mg/m). Using 100 denier (10 mg/m) leaves more fabric in the outer layers where it is needed, because there are more threads in the weave. Each rover used four airbags with six lobes each, all of which were connected. Connection was important, since it helped abate some of the landing forces by keeping the bag system flexible and responsive to ground pressure. The airbags were not attached directly to the rover, but were held to it by ropes crisscrossing the bag structure. The ropes gave the bags shape, making inflation easier. While in flight, the bags were stowed along with three gas generators that are used for inflation. ===Lander=== [[Image:Opportunity Lander Petals PIA04848.jpg|thumb|MER lander petals opening (Courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech)]] The spacecraft lander is a protective "shell" that houses the rover, and together with the airbags, protects it from the forces of impact. The lander is a [[tetrahedron]] shape, whose sides open like petals. It is strong and light, and made of beams and sheets. The beams consist of layers of [[graphite]] fiber woven into a fabric that is lighter than aluminium and more rigid than [[steel]]. Titanium fittings are glued and fitted onto the beams to allow it to be bolted together. The rover was held inside the lander by [[Screw|bolts]] and special nuts that were released after landing with small explosives. ====Uprighting==== After the lander stopped bouncing and rolling on the ground, it came to rest on the base of the tetrahedron or one of its sides. The sides then opened to make the base horizontal and the rover upright. The sides are connected to the base by hinges, each of which has a motor strong enough to lift the lander. The rover plus lander has a [[mass]] of about 533 kilograms (1,175 [[pound (mass)|pound]]s). The rover alone weighs about 185 kg (408 lb). The gravity on Mars is about 38% of Earth's, so the motor does not need to be as powerful as it would on Earth. The rover contains [[accelerometer]]s to detect which way is down (toward the surface of Mars) by measuring the pull of gravity. The rover computer then commanded the correct lander petal to open to place the rover upright. Once the base petal was down and the rover was upright, the other two petals were opened. The petals initially opened to an equally flat position, so all sides of the lander were straight and level. The petal motors are strong enough so that if two of the petals come to rest on rocks, the base with the rover would be held in place like a bridge above the ground. The base will hold at a level even with the height of the petals resting on rocks, making a straight flat surface throughout the length of the open, flattened lander. The flight team on Earth could then send commands to the rover to adjust the petals and create a safe path for the rover to drive off the lander and onto the Martian surface without dropping off a steep rock. ====Moving the payload onto Mars==== [[Image:MER Spirit Lander Pan Sol16-A18R1 br2.jpg|thumb|''Spirit'''s lander on Mars]] The moving of the rover off the lander is called the egress phase of the mission. The rover must avoid having its wheels caught in the airbag material or falling off a sharp incline. To help this, a retraction system on the petals slowly drags the airbags toward the lander before the petals open. Small ramps on the petals fan out to fill spaces between the petals. They cover uneven terrain, rock obstacles, and airbag material, and form a circular area from which the rover can drive off in more directions. They also lower the step that the rover must climb down. They are nicknamed "batwings", and are made of Vectran cloth. About three hours were allotted to retract the airbags and deploy the lander petals. ==Rover design== [[Image:MER vs. Sojourner PIA04827.jpg|thumb|Mars Exploration Rover vs. [[Mars Pathfinder|Sojourner]] rover (Courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech)]]The rovers are six-wheeled, solar-powered robots that stand 1.5 m (4.9 ft) high, 2.3 m (7.5 ft) wide and 1.6 m (5.2 ft) long. They weigh 180 kg (400 lb), 35 kg (80 lb) of which is the wheel and suspension system.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://hobbiton.thisside.net/rovermanual/ | title = MER Technical Data | accessdate = July 15, 2007}}</ref> ===Drive system=== Each rover has six wheels mounted on a [[rocker-bogie]] suspension system that ensures wheels remain on the ground while driving over rough terrain. The design reduces the range of motion of the rover body by half, and allows the rover to go over obstacles or through holes that are more than a wheel diameter (250 mm or 10 inches) in size. Each wheel also has cleats, providing grip for climbing in soft sand and scrambling over rocks. Each wheel has its own motor. The two front and two rear wheels each have individual steering motors. This allows the vehicle to turn in place, a full revolution, and to swerve and curve, making arching turns. The rover is designed to withstand a tilt of 45 degrees in any direction without overturning. However, the rover is programmed through its "fault protection limits" in its hazard avoidance software to avoid exceeding tilts of 30 degrees. Each rover can spin one of its front wheels in place to grind deep into the terrain. It is to remain motionless while the digging wheel is spinning. The rovers have a top speed on flat hard ground of 50 mm/s (2 in/s). The average speed is 10 mm/s, because its hazard avoidance software causes it to stop every 10 seconds for 20 seconds to observe and understand the terrain into which it has driven. ===Power and electronic systems=== {{See also|Comparison of embedded computer systems on board the Mars rovers}} [[Image:Mars Spirit rover's solar panels covered with Dust - October 2007.jpg|thumb|Circular projection showing MER-A ''Spirit'''s solar panels covered in dust in October 2007 on Mars.
