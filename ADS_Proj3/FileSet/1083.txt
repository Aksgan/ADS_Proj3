the process. When companies desire, or are required, to gain control of their data, they empower their people, set up processes and get help from technology to do it.<ref name="sarsfield">Sarsfield, Steve (2009). "The Data Governance Imperative", IT Governance.</ref> There are some commonly cited vendor definitions for data governance. Data governance is a [[quality control]] discipline for assessing, managing, using, improving, monitoring, maintaining, and protecting organizational information.<ref name="IBM">{{cite web|url=http://www-306.ibm.com/software/tivoli/governance/servicemanagement/data-governance.html|title=IBM Data Governance webpage|accessdate=2008-07-09}}</ref> It is a system of decision rights and accountabilities for information-related processes, executed according to agreed-upon models which describe who can take what actions with what information, and when, under what circumstances, using what methods.<ref name="Data Governance Institute Data Governance Framework">{{cite web|url=http://datagovernance.com/dgi_framework.pdf|title=Data Governance Institute Data Governance Framework}}</ref>: == Overview == Data governance encompasses the people, processes, and [[information technology]] required to create a consistent and proper handling of an organization's data across the business enterprise. Goals may be defined at all levels of the enterprise and doing so may aid in acceptance of processes by those who will use them. Some goals include: * Increasing consistency and confidence in [[decision making]] * Decreasing the risk of regulatory fines * Improving [[information security|data security]] * Maximizing the income generation potential of data * Designating accountability for information quality * Enable better planning by supervisory staff * Minimizing or eliminating re-work * Optimize staff effectiveness * Establish process performance baselines to enable improvement efforts * Acknowledge and hold all gains These goals are realized by the implementation of Data governance programs, or initiatives using Change Management techniques. ==Data governance drivers== While data governance initiatives can be driven by a desire to improve data quality, they are more often driven by C-Level leaders responding to external regulations. Examples of these regulations include [[Sarbanes-Oxley]], [[Basel I]], [[Basel II]], [[HIPAA]], and a number data privacy regulations. To achieve compliance with these regulations, business processes and controls require formal management processes to govern the data subject to these regulations. Successful programs identify drivers meaningful to both supervisory and executive leadership. Common themes among the external regulations center on the need to manage risk. The risks can be financial misstatement, inadvertent release of sensitive data, or poor data quality for key decisions. Methods to manage these risks vary from industry to industry. Examples of commonly referenced best practices and guidelines include [[COBIT]], [[ISO/IEC 38500]], and others. The proliferation of regulations and standards creates challenges for data governance professionals, particularly when multiple regulations overlap the data being managed. Organizations often launch data governance initiatives to address these challenges. == Data governance initiatives == Data governance initiatives improve [[data quality]] by assigning a team responsible for data's accuracy, accessibility, consistency, and completeness, among other metrics. This team usually consists of executive leadership, [[project management]], [[line function|line-of-business managers]], and [[data steward]]s. The team usually employs some form of methodology for tracking and improving enterprise data, such as [[Six Sigma]], and tools for [[data mapping]], [[data profiling|profiling]], cleansing, and monitoring data. Data governance initiatives may be aimed at achieving a number of objectives including offering better visibility to internal and external customers (such as [[supply chain]] management), compliance with [[compliance (regulation)|regulatory law]], improving operations after rapid company growth or [[mergers and acquisitions|corporate mergers]], or to aid the efficiency of enterprise [[knowledge worker]]s by reducing confusion and error and increasing their scope of knowledge. Many data governance initiatives are also inspired by past attempts to fix information quality at the departmental level, leading to incongruent and redundant data quality processes. Most large companies have many applications and databases that can't easily share information. Therefore, knowledge workers within large organizations often don't have access to the information they need to best do their jobs. When they do have access to the data, the [[data quality]] may be poor. By setting up a data governance practice or [[Corporate Data Authority]], these problems can be mitigated. The structure of a data governance initiative will vary not only with the size of the organization, but with the desired objectives or the 'focus areas' <ref name="focus areas">{{cite web|url=http://datagovernance.com/fc_focus_areas_for_data_governance.html|title=Data Governance Focus Areas}}</ref> of the effort. == Implementation == Implementation of a Data Governance initiative may vary in scope as well as origin. Sometimes, an executive mandate will arise to initiate an enterprise wide effort, sometimes the mandate will be to create a pilot project or projects, limited in scope and objectives, aimed at either resolving existing issues or demonstrating value. Sometimes an initiative will originate lower down in the organization’s hierarchy, and will be deployed in a limited scope to demonstrate value to potential sponsors higher up in the organization. == Data governance tools == Leaders of successful data governance programs declared in December 2006 at the Data Governance Conference in Orlando, Fl, that data governance is between 80 and 95 percent communication.”<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dmreview.com/issues/2007_48/10001356-1.html | title = Data Governance: One Size Does Not Fit All | last = Hopwood | first = Peter | authorlink = Peter Hopwood | publisher = [[DM Review Magazine]] | date = 2008-06 | accessdate = 2008-10-02 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5bGHaz1gA | archivedate = 2008-10-02 | quote = At the inaugural Data Governance Conference in Orlando, Florida, in December 2006, leaders of successful data governance programs declared that in their experience, data governance is between 80 and 95 percent communication.
