Other approaches to providing a [[formal semantics of programming languages]] include [[axiomatic semantics]] and [[denotational semantics]]. The operational semantics for a programming language describes how a valid program is interpreted as sequences of computational steps. These sequences then ''are'' the meaning of the program. In the context of [[functional program]]s, the final step in a terminating sequence returns the value of the program. (In general there can be many return values for a single program, because the program could be [[Nondeterministic algorithm|nondeterministic]], and even for a deterministic program there can be many computation sequences since the semantics may not specify exactly what sequence of operations arrives at that value.) For the first time, the concept of operational semantics was used in defining the semantics of Algol 68. The following statement is a quote from the revised ALGOL 68 report: <blockquote> The meaning of a program in the strict language is explained in terms of a hypothetical computer which performs the set of actions which constitute the elaboration of that program. ([[#algol68|Algol68]], Section 2) </blockquote> The first use of the term "operational semantics" in its present meaning is attributed to Dana Scott ([[#plotkin04|Plotkin04]]). What follows is a quote from Scott's seminal paper on formal semantics, in which he mentions the "operational" aspects of semantics. <blockquote> It is all very well to aim for a more ‘abstract’ and a ‘cleaner’ approach to semantics, but if the plan is to be any good, the operational aspects cannot be completely ignored. ([[#scott70|Scott70]]) </blockquote> Perhaps the first formal incarnation of operational semantics was the use of the [[lambda calculus]] to define the semantics of [[LISP]] by [{{Cite web| title=Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine, Part I| author=John McCarthy | url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.html | accessdate=2006-10-13}}]. Abstract machines in the tradition of the [[SECD machine]] are also closely related. == Structural Operational Semantics (SOS) == Structural Operational Semantics (SOS), sometimes also called structured operational semantics, was introduced by [[Gordon Plotkin]] in ([[#plotkin81|Plotkin81]]) as a logical means to defining operational semantics. The basic idea behind SOS is to define the behavior of a program in terms of the behavior of its parts, thus providing a structural, i.e., syntax oriented and [[inductive definition|inductive]], view on operational semantics. An SOS specification defines the behavior of a program in terms of a (set of) [[State transition system|transition relation]](s). SOS specifications take the form of a set of [[inference rule]]s which define the valid transitions of a composite piece of syntax in terms
