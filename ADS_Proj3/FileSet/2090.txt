to enable an organization to prove that it is performing software asset management to a standard sufficient to satisfy corporate governance requirements and ensure effective support for IT service management overall. This part of ISO/IEC 19770-1 describes the life cycle processes for the management of software and related assets.<ref>[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=33908 ISO/IEC 19770-1 Information technology — Software asset management — Part 1: Processes]</ref><ref>[http://www.iso19770.com Web site from the working group that developed the 19770-1 standard]</ref> ==ISO/IEC 19770-2: Software identification tag== ISO/IEC 19770-2 provides a software asset management (SAM) data standard for software identification tags. Software ID tags provide authoritative identifying information for installed software or other licensable item (such as fonts, or copyrighted papers). This process starts with the software manufacturer/publisher who will use this standard to enable their software to be accurately identified, making the software significantly more manageable from a software asset management perspective. This standard provides much more than just software identification however, by allowing other members of the SAM eco-system to add their own attributes to the software identification process (including who distributed the software, who may have re-packaged the software, if the software is following an ISO 20000 / ITIL release process, etc). A draft of this standard was initially developed by a committee of the International Business Software Managers Association (IBSMA). The last version of the draft standard created by the IBSMA committee went out for public review in May 2007. In October 2007, members of ISO/IEC Working Group 21 (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7/WG 21) met in Montreal and created an "other working group" (OWG) to continue the development of the 19770-2 standard with the goal of finalizing the standard in time for the ISO Plenary meeting to be held in May of 2008 in Berlin. At that time, Steve Klos of Agnitio Advisors, was appointed as the convener of the other working group (OWG). In late December 2007, the OWG was allowed to restart work on the standard. According to the schedule ISO/IEC JTC1/SC7 plenary meeting took place in Berlin May 18th – 23rd, 2008. The JTC1/SC7 resolutions included appointment of Krzysztof (Chris) Baczkiewicz, IT Standards Support Department Manager for [[Eracent]], as the [[Project Editor]] of both 19770-2 Software Identification Tag and 19770-3 Software Entitlement Tag standards. When the standard progressed through the final committee draft vote, the document as submitted at that time received enough votes to be accepted as a final draft international standard (FDIS). However, a number of useful comments had been provided by organizations such as IAITAM and ISACA as well as from the British, US and Japanese delegations which the OWG felt would add value to the standard. These changes were made and were reviewed and approved by everyone who submitted suggestions to the FCD. In May of 2009, Working Group 21 approved the standard to move into Final Draft International Status. This standard is currently going into ISO/IEC stage 5 - the Approval stage and is under ISO/IEC copyright control. During this phase of the standards development process which is expected to last until August of 2009, the draft is available from liaison organizations to WG21 which include IAITAM, itSMF, ISACA and the BSA for review purposes. The draft is only available to members of these organizations, no unrestricted public download of the draft is allowed. Any suggested changes to the draft are made through a formal ISO/IEC review process. The next step in the standards development process is for ISO/IEC to submit this draft standard as a final draft international standard (FDIS). This final draft is voted on by national bodies, however this is only an approval/disapproval vote, no comments are accepted. If the standard is approved, it will then go through one final round of ISO editorial review, then it will be published as an international standard. While the document is in stage 5, a non-profit organization called TagVault.org<ref>[http://www.tagvault.org Web site for TagVault.org]</ref> was formed. The organization was formed under [[IEEE-ISTO]]<ref>[http://www.ieee-isto.org Website for IEEE-ISTO]</ref>with the initial founding members being Symantec, CA and ModusLinkOCS. The organization will act as the registration authority for ISO/IEC 19770-2 software identifiation tags (SWID Tags) and will provide tools and services allowing all SAM eco-system members to take advantage of SWID tags faster, with a lower cost and with more industry compatibility than would otherwise be possible. ==ISO/IEC 19770-3: Software entitlement tag== ISO/IEC 19770-3 will provide a software asset management (SAM) data standard for software licensing entitlement tags. Software entitlement tags are computer files that provide authoritative identifying information about software licensing rights. The ISO/IEC 19770-3 Other Working Group ("OWG")<ref>[http://www.sassafras.com/iso/ Web site from the working group developing the 19770-3 standard]</ref> was convened by teleconference call on 9 September 2008. Seven subcommittees were defined and a regular meeting schedule was chosen. The mandate for this OWG will extend through the May 2009 ISO/IEC Plenary conference. It is anticipated that a Final Committee Draft will be submitted by the OWG to WG21 at that time. John Tomeny of Sassafras Software Inc was appointed as the convener of the ISO/IEC 19770-3 Other Working Group by Working Group 21 (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7/WG 21). In addition to WG21 members, other participants in the 19770-3 OWG may be any "individuals considered to have relevant expertise by the Convener".<ref>[http://www.sassafras.com/iso/W21N0805.pdf W21N0805 (revision 2): Terms of Reference for ISO/IEC 19770-3 Software Entitlement Tag Other Working Group]</ref> == References == {{reflist}} == External links == *[http://www.bsa.org/ Business Software Alliance] *[http://www.iaitam.com International Association of Information Technology Asset Managers] *[http://www.itsmf.org IT Service Management Forum] *[http://www.siia.net Software & Information Industry Association (SIIA)] {{ISO standards}} [[Category:ISO standards|#19770]] [[Category:Information technology management]] [[hu:ISO 19770]] [[sv:ISO/IEC 19770]] [[yo:ISO 19770]]</text> </page> <page> <id>17727</id> <title>ISP Formal Verification Tool</title> <text>ISP ("In-situ Partial Order") is a tool for the formal verification of [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]] programs developed within the [http://www.cs.utah.edu/ School of Computing] at the [http://www.utah.edu University of Utah].
