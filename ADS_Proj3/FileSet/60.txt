called [[ACiD Productions|ACiD]], "ANSI Creators in Demand." In that same year the second major underground art scene group was founded, [[iCE Advertisements|ICE]], "Insane Creators Enterprise".<ref name="100years">[http://www.cow.net/conned/notacon/artscene/notacon-100artscene-transcript.txt 100 YEARS OF THE COMPUTER ART SCENE], Presented by [[Jason Scott Sadofsky]] and [[RaD Man]] ([[ACiD Productions|ACiD]]), [[Notacon]] Conference - Cleveland, Ohio, USA, April 23-25th, 2004</ref> There is some debate between ASCII and block ASCII artist, with "Hardcore" ASCII artists maintaining that block ASCII art is in fact [[ANSI art]], because it does not use the 128 characters of the original ASCII standard. On the other hand, block ASCII artists argue that if their art uses only characters of the computers character set, then it is to be called ASCII, regardless if the character set is proprietary or not.<!--original sentence was entirely ungrammatical; I hope this one gets the proper meaning across--> Microsoft Windows does not support the [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI Standard]] x3.16. One can view block ASCIIs with a text editor using the font "[[Terminal (font)|Terminal]]", but it will not look exactly as it was intended by the artist. With a special ASCII/ANSI viewer, such as ACiDView for Windows (see ASCII and ANSI art viewers), one can see block ASCII and ANSI files properly. An example that [[#.22Block.22 ASCII art|illustrates the difference]] in appearance is part of this article. Alternatively, one could look at the file using the Type command in the command prompt. ===="Amiga"/"Oldskool" style ASCII art==== [[Image:Paso-IceCream-AmigaVsPC.png|right|200px|thumbnail|Oldschool/Amiga ASCII look on Commodore Amiga Computer versus look on the IBM PC (notice the tight spacing)]] In the art scene one popular ASCII style that used the 7-bit standard ASCII character set was the so called "[[Old school|Oldskool]]" Style. It is also called "Amiga style", due to its origin and widespread use on the [[Amiga|Commodore Amiga]] Computers. The style uses primarily the characters: <tt>_/\-+=.()<>:</tt>. The "oldskool" art looks more like the outlined drawings of shapes than real pictures. This is an example of "[[Amiga]] style" (also referred to as "old school" or "oldskool" style) [[computer art scene|scene]] ASCII art.<ref name="asciistyles" /> The Amiga ASCII Scene surfaced in 1992, 7 years after the introduction of the Commodore [[Amiga 1000]]. The Commodore 64 PETSCII scene did not make the transition to the Commodore Amiga as the C64 demo and warez scenes did. Among the first Amiga ASCII art groups were ART, Epsilon Design, Upper Class, Unreal. This means that the text art scene on the Amiga was actually younger than the text art scene on the PC. The Amiga artists also did not call their ASCII art style "Oldskool". That term was introduced on the PC. When and by whom is unknown and lost in history. The Amiga style ASCII artwork was most often released in the form of a single text file, which included all the artwork (usually requested), with some design parts in between, as opposed to the PC art scene where the art work was released as a [[ZIP archive]] with separate text files for each piece. Furthermore, the releases were usually called "ASCII collections" and not "art packs" like on the IBM PC. ===== In text editors ===== <pre style="float:right;"> _____ ___ ____ _ _ | ___|_ _/ ___| | ___| |_ | |_ | | | _| |/ _ \ __| | _| | | |_| | | __/ |_ |_| |___\____|_|\___|\__| </pre> This kind of ASCII art is hand made in a text editor. Popular editors used to make this kind of ASCII art include [[CygnusEd]]itor aka CED ([[Amiga]]) and [[EditPlus|EditPlus2]] ([[Wintel|PC]]). Oldskool font example from the PC, which was taken from the ASCII Editor ''[[FIGlet|<small>FIG</small>let]]''. ====Newskool style ASCII art==== [[Image:Roy-csnewskool.png|right|200px|thumbnail|Newskool ASCII Screenshot]] "Newskool" is a popular form of ASCII art which capitalizes on character strings like "$#Xxo". In spite of its name, the style is not "new"; on the contrary, it was very old but fell out of favor and was replaced by "Oldskool" and "Block" style ASCII art. It was dubbed "Newskool" upon its comeback and renewed popularity at the end of the 1990s.<ref name="asciistyles" /> Newskool changed significantly as the result of the introduction of [[Character encoding|extended proprietary characters]]. The classic 7-bit standard ASCII characters remain predominant, but the extended characters are often used for "fine tuning" and "tweaking". The style developed further after the introduction and adaptation of [[Unicode]]. ==Methods for generating ASCII art== {{Main|List of text editors#ASCII and ANSI art}} While some prefer to use a simple [[text editor]] to produce ASCII art, specialized programs have been developed that often simulate the features and tools in bitmap image editors. For Block ASCII art and ANSI art the artist almost always uses a special text editor, because the required characters are not available on a standard keyboard. The special text editors have sets of special characters assigned to existing keys on the keyboard. Popular MS DOS based editors, such as TheDraw and ACiDDraw had multiple sets of different special characters mapped to the F-Keys to make the use of those characters easier for the artist who can switch between individual sets of characters via basic keyboard shortcuts. PabloDraw is one of the very few special ASCII/ANSI art editors that were developed for MS Windows XP. ===Image to text conversion=== {{Main|ASCII art converters}} Other programs allow one to automatically convert an image to text characters, which is a special case of [[vector quantization]]. A method is to sample the image down to [[grayscale]] with less than [[integer (computer science)|8-bit]] precision, and then assign a character for each value. Examples of converted images are given below. This is one of the earliest forms of ASCII art, dating back to the early days of the 1960s [[minicomputer]]s and [[teletype]]s. During the 1970s it was popular in [[shopping mall|malls]] to get a [[t-shirt]] with a photograph printed in ASCII art on it from an automated kiosk manned by a computer. With the advent of the web and [[HTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], many ASCII conversion programs will now quantize to a full [[RGB]] colorspace, enabling colorized ASCII images. Since
