Disputes between the pair over moderation of message forums, marketing, and site content led to a lawsuit being filed in federal court by Agnor, and led to the eventual purchase of the site by Agnor. After mediation Wheeler, author of Forged of a Hotter Fire, reportedly received approximately $100,000 for his 50% share of HornFans.com, and subsequently opened the now defunct (but still registered) LonghornFanZone.com. <ref name="statesman"/> HornFans is currently owned and operated by Robert and Katy Agnor.<ref>[http://www.hornfans.com/aboutus/index.php Hornfans.com -- About us]</ref> == Criticism == HornFans has a strict policy against criticism of players or coaches.<ref>[http://forums.hornfans.com/php/wwwthreads/guidelines.php FAQ<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Moderators enforce it by deleting such posts and suspending (or banning outright) posters who go against this policy.

They are named after the logician [[Alfred Horn]], who first pointed out the significance of such clauses in 1951. Horn clauses play a basic role in [[logic programming]] and are important for [[constructive logic]]. A Horn clause with exactly one positive literal is a '''definite clause'''; in [[universal algebra]] definite clauses appear as [[quasiidentity|quasiidentities]]. A Horn clause with no positive literals is sometimes called a '''goal clause''' or '''query clause''', especially in [[logic programming]]. A '''dual-Horn clause''' is a clause with at most one [[negative literal|''negative'' literal]]. A '''Horn formula''' is a string of existential or universal quantifiers followed by a conjunction of Horn clauses; that is, a [[prenex normal form]] formula whose matrix is in [[conjunctive normal form]] with all clauses Horn. The following is an example of a (definite) Horn clause: :<math>\neg p \or \neg q \vee \cdots \vee \neg t \vee u</math> Such a formula can also be written equivalently in the form of an implication: :<math>(p \wedge q \wedge \cdots \wedge t) \rightarrow u</math> Horn clauses can be [[Propositional logic|propositional]] or [[First-order logic|first order]], depending on whether we consider propositional or first-order literals. Horn (1951) has shown that validity of Horn formulas is preserved under nonempty [[direct product]]s, and conjectured that the converse also holds. This was disproved by Chang and Morel (1958), however Keisler (1965) proved that a formula is Horn if and only if it is preserved under nonempty [[reduced product]]s. Horn clauses are relevant to theorem proving by [[first-order resolution]], in that the resolution of two Horn clauses is itself a Horn clause. Moreover, the resolution of a goal clause and a definite clause is again a goal clause. In [[automated theorem proving]], this can lead to greater efficiencies in proving a theorem represented as a goal clause. Horn clause logic is equivalent in computational power to a universal Turing machine. In fact, the resolution of a goal clause with a definite clause to produce a new goal clause is the basis of the [[SLD resolution]] inference rule, used to implement [[logic programming]] and the programming language [[Prolog]]. In logic programming a definite clause behaves as a goal-reduction procedure. For example, the Horn clause written above behaves as the procedure: :'''to show <math>u</math>, show <math>p</math> and show <math>q</math> and <math>\cdots</math> and show <math>t</math>.''' To emphasize this backwards use of the clause, it is often written using the [[consequence operator]]: :<math>u \leftarrow (p \and q \and \cdots \and t)</math> This is written in [[Prolog]] as follows: u :- p, q, ..., t. Propositional Horn clauses are also of interest in [[computational complexity]], where the problem of finding a set of variable assignments to make a conjunction of Horn clauses true is a [[P-complete]] problem, sometimes called [[Horn-satisfiability|HORNSAT]]. This is P's version of the [[boolean satisfiability problem]], a central [[NP-complete]] problem. Satisfiability of first-order Horn clauses is [[undecidable]]. ==References== *[[Alfred Horn]] (1951), "On sentences which are true of direct unions of algebras", ''Journal of Symbolic Logic'', 16, 14–21. *C.
