It was superseded in 2008 by [[IEEE 754-2008]], which specifies floating-point arithmetic for both radix 2 and radix 10, including specifying two alternative formats for radix 10 floating-point values. IEEE 854 did not specify any formats. IEEE 754-2008 also has many other updates to the IEEE floating point standardisation. {{IEEE standards}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Ieee 854-1987}} [[Category:Computer arithmetic]] [[Category:IEEE standards]]</text> </page> <page> <id>17499</id> <title>IEEE Computer Society</title> <text>{{Original research|date=May 2010}} {{Refimprove|date=August 2010}} {{Infobox Organization | name = IEEE Computer Society | image = IEEE Computer Society logo.jpg | image_border = | size = 200px | caption = The IEEE Computer Society Logo | formation = 1971<ref>Smith, Merlin G.: "IEEE Computer Society: Four Decades of Service," ''Computer'', 39(1):10, September 1991</ref> | type = Professional association | headquarters = [[Washington DC]] | location = [[United States]] | membership = | language = [[English language|English]] | leader_title = | leader_name = | key_people = | parent_organization = [[IEEE]] | website = http://www.computer.org }} '''IEEE Computer Society''' (sometimes abbreviated '''Computer Society''' or '''CS''') is a [[professional association]], chartered in 1971 "to advance the theory, practice, and application of computer and information science and technology."<ref>IEEE Computer Society Constitution & Bylaws, art. 1, Sec. 2, 1971</ref> With headquarters in Washington D.C. (and additional offices in California and Japan), the Computer Society serves the professional development of members worldwide by organizing workshops and conferences, publishing peer-reviewed literature, operating specialty-discipline committees, and supporting local chapters. The CS also participates in educational activities at all levels of the profession, including distance learning, accreditation of higher education programs in computer science, and professional certification in software engineering. ==History and governance== [[Image:Computer Society HQ.jpg|thumb|350px|IEEE Computer Society Headquarters Office in Washington, DC]] The IEEE Computer Society traces its origins to the Subcommittee on Large-Scale Computing, established in 1946 by the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers]] ([[AIEE]]),<ref>Concordia, Charles: "In the Beginning There Was The AIEE Committee on Computing Devices," ''Computer'', 9(12):42, December 1976</ref> and to the Technical Committee on Electronic Computers, established in 1948) by the [[Institute of Radio Engineers]] (IRE).<ref>Grier, David, "George Stevitz's Values and the Institute of Radio Engineers," ''Computer'', 39(1):13, January 2006</ref> When the AIEE merged with the IRE in 1963 to form the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE), these two committees became the IEEE Computer Group. The group established its own constitution and bylaws in 1971 to become the IEEE Computer Society.<ref>Wood, Helen: "Computer Society Celebrates 50 Years," ''IEEE Annals of the History of Computing'', 17(4):6, 1996</ref> Today the CS is the largest of 38 technical societies organized under the [[IEEE Technical Activities Board]]. IEEE Computer Society members elect a professional volunteer Executive Committee and a 21-member Board of Governors to set direction, strategies, and policies. One CS Executive Committee member and two CS board members sit on the corresponding IEEE governing bodies. Notable leaders of the IEEE Computer Society (and its predecessor IRE and AIEE committees) include [[Charles Concordia]], W.H. MacWilliams, Morton Astrahan, [[Edward McCluskey]], and Albert Hoagland. ==Main activities== [[Image:PUBS OFFICE.jpg|thumb|200px|right|IEEE Computer Society Publications Office - Los Alamitos, CA]] The Computer Society maintains volunteer boards in six program areas: education, membership, professional activities, publications, standards, and technical and conference activities. In addition, 12 standing committees administer activities such as the CS elections and its awards programs to recognize professional excellence. ===Educational activities=== CS educational activities include curriculum development, accreditation, and continuing education and training programs (e.g., the Computer Science Curriculum, developed jointly with the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.acm.org/education/curricula/ComputerScience2008.pdf | title=Computer Science Curriculum 2008: An Interim Revision of CS 2001, report from the ACM and IEEE Computer Society Interim Review Task Force | date=December 2008}}</ref> The CS also works with the ACM in developing accreditation criteria for college and university computer science programs through the [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] (ABET). ===Professional activities=== The CS Professional Activities Board focuses on the needs of industry practitioners. It developed and maintains the ''Guide to the [[Software Engineering Body of Knowledge]]'' (SWEBOK). It developed and administers two professional certification programs that conform to SWEBOK, the [[Certified Software Development Professional]] and [[Certified Software Development Associate]]. ===Publications=== The IEEE Computer Society Press operates from the Publications Office, Los Alamitos, California. The CS publishes 13 peer-reviewed technical magazines, including the CS flagship publication, ''[[Computer]]''; 17 [[scholarly journal]]s called Transactions; and more than 200 conference proceedings each year. The Publications Office also develops and maintains the Computer Society Digital Library (CSDL), which provides subscriber access to all CS publications. In 2008, the Computer Society launched ''Computing Now,'' a Web portal featuring free access to a rotation of CSDL articles, along with technical news, CS blogs, and multimedia content. ===Standards activities=== The CS Standards Activities Boards operates [[working group]]s and committees that develop industrial [[Standards organizations|standards]] (e.g., the Storage Systems Standards Committee). ===Technical activities and conferences=== The Computer Society organizes about 150 conferences each year and coordinates the operation of about 50 technical committees (e.g., the Technical Committee on Bioinformatics), councils (e.g., the Software Engineering Council), and task forces (e.g., the Task Force on Information Assurance). ===Awards=== The IEEE Computer Society recognizes outstanding work by computer professionals who advance the field in three areas of achievement: Technical Awards (e.g., the Seymour Cray Computer Engineering Award or the [[IEEE Computer Pioneer Award]]), Education Awards (e.g., [[Taylor L. Booth Education Award]]), and Service Awards (e.g., Richard E. Merwin Distinguished Service Award). == See also == * [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] * [[Association for Computing Machinery]] * [[Australian Computer Society]] * [[British
