They are usually loaned to OEM manufacturers prior to the chips commercial release to allow product development/display. Usually, they are picked out of a very large bunch and perform well. However, rarely they may have flaws that were fixed in the production model. {{Fact|date=June 2010}} Such samples are usually handed out under [[NDA|Non-disclosure]] or other confidential agreement. Old engineering models, such as Pentium IV ES chips were rare and favoured for having unlocked multipliers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.techarp.com/showarticle.aspx?artno=407|title=Why You Should AVOID Intel Core 2 Engineering Samples}}</ref> More recently, Core 2 ES chips have become more common and popular.

'''''English and Welsh''''' is the title of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[valedictory]] address to the [[University of Oxford]] of 1955. The lecture sheds light on Tolkien's conceptions of the connections of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[ethnicity]] and [[language]]. Tolkien begins with an overview of the terms "[[:wikt:British|British]]", "[[:wikt:Celtic|Celtic]]", "[[:wikt:Germanic|Germanic]]", "[[:wikt:Saxon|Saxon]]", "[[:wikt:English|English]]" and "[[:wikt:Welsh|Welsh]]", explaining the latter term's etymology in ''[[walha]]''. Tolkien also addresses the historical [[language contact]] between English and Welsh since the [[Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain]], including [[Welsh loanwords in English|Welsh loanwords]] and [[Welsh substrate in English|substrate influence]] found in English, and conversely [[:wikt:Appendix:Glossary of Welsh Words of English Origin|English loanwords in Welsh]]. Comparing the Germanic [[i-mutation|''i''-mutation]] and the Celtic [[Affection (linguistics)|affection]], Tolkien says :"The north-west of Europe, in spite of its underlying differences of linguistic heritage – Goidelic, Brittonic, Gallic; its varieties of Germanic; and the powerful intrusion of spoken Latin – is as it were a single [[sprachbund|philological province]], a region so interconnected in race, culture, history, and linguistic fusions that its departmental philologies cannot flourish in isolation." In the final part of the lecture, Tolkien explores the concept of [[phonaesthetics]], citing the phrase ''[[cellar door]]'' as a recognized beautiful-sounding phrase in English, adding that to his own taste, in Welsh "''cellar doors'' are extraordinarily frequent". Tolkien describes the working of phonaesthetics inherent in the moment of association of [[Phonestheme|sound and meaning]], :"this pleasure is felt most immediately and acutely in the moment of association: that is in the reception (or imagination) of a word-form which is felt to have a certain style, and the attribution to it of a meaning which is not received through it." Tolkien alludes to his view that such tastes are inherited, "an aspect in linguistic terms of our individual natures. And since these are largely historical products, the predilections must be so too". To refer to such an inherited taste of language, Tolkien introduces the term of "native tongue" as opposed to "cradle tongue". ==References== *Tolkien, J.R.R.

It is being developed by [[CSR plc|CSR]] who has partnered with [[Motorola]] &ndash; together they intend to create an open industry forum. According to CSR, EGPS delivers a "universal positioning capability that will not only work reliably indoors and in zero GPS signal conditions, but greatly speed time to fix in poor GPS reception areas where most handsets are used." More specifically, it can "exploit data available from the cellular network to speed GPS fixes and provide complementary, fast, and reliable location sensing when GPS signals are weak or unavailable." CSR is hoping to add eGPS capabilities to handsets for less than $1 per unit. E-GPS combines CSR's "Matrix" technology with GPS &ndash; when a user initiates a location request they get a Matrix location instantly using cell tower information, accurate to within 100m. Then CSR's "Fine Time Aiding" helps the device know where to look for a GPS signal, to quickly acquire satellite information within seconds. Fine Time Aiding enables a more aggressive search and is claimed to be equivalent to 6 dB more sensitivity than can be achieved by any GPS hardware correlator in the terminal. CSR claim that this enables software-only GPS solutions to operate reliably in all environments, and that eGPS is superior to [[AGPS|Assisted GPS]]. EGPS technologies are due in 2008. == Timeline == * February 2005 - The E-GPS system was first announced by developers CPS (Cambridge Positioning Systems Ltd)<ref>[http://www.palminfocenter.com/news/7557/egps-offers-more-accurate-handset-locating/ CSR announcement Feb 2005]</ref> * January 2007 - CPS is purchased by CSR, a manufacturer of bluetooth and wireless chips for mobile handsets * January 2008 - CSR & [[Motorola]] announce that they intend to create an open industry forum for EGPS technologies == References == <References/> == External links == * [http://www.egpsforum.org/ The EGPS Forum - Motorola and CSR] * [http://www.engadget.com/2008/02/10/csr-shows-off-egps-says-its-superior-to-a-gps/ CSR shows off eGPS, says it's superior to aGPS] * [http://www.3g.co.uk/PR/April2006/2970.htm E-GPS High Accuracy Mobile Location Technology for GSM / 3G W-CDMA] {{DEFAULTSORT:Enhanced Gps}} [[Category:Mobile technology]] [[Category:Satellite navigation systems]] [[Category:GPS]] [[it:Enhanced GPS]]</text> </page> <page> <id>12192</id> <title>Enigform</title> <text>{{Notability|date=June 2010}} '''Enigform''' is
