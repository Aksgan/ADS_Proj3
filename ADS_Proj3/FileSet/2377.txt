the viewer software relative to a browser based application is the area of ActiveX or Java security. Well formed implementations can be found across the major vendors today, yet there are many entry-level implementations that may not be as robust when it comes to security, performance and reliability. Important to note is that many of the stand-alone viewer software applications provided by many manufacturers are also reliant on ActiveX or Java. In addition, each major manufacturer is free to use various licensing mechanisms, some based on numbers of target devices, some based on numbers of users, and some based on numbers of sessions. In comparison to conventional methods of remote administration (for example [[Virtual Network Computing]] or [[Terminal Services]]), a KVM switch has the advantage that it doesn't depend on a software component running on the remote computer, thus allowing remote interaction with base level [[BIOS]] settings and monitoring of the entire booting process before, during, and after the operating system loads. Modern KVM over IP appliances or switches typically use at least 128-bit data encryption securing the KVM configuration over a WAN or LAN (using [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]]) KVM over IP devices have been implemented in many different ways. For the graphics capture portion, [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] based KVM over IP cards use a variation of a technique known as [[screen scraping]] where the PCI [[bus master]] KVM over IP card would access graphics data directly from the graphics memory buffer. In these cases, the PCI card must know which graphics chip it is working with, and what graphics mode this chip is currently in so that the contents of the buffer can be interpreted correctly as picture data. Newer techniques such as those used by [[OPMA]] management subsystem cards and other implementations obtain the video data directly from the graphics chip using the industry standard [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]] bus. There are also a variety of ways to emulate the keyboard and the mouse remotely, but newer implementations emulate [[USB]] based keyboards and mice using the management controller. == See also == {{commons category|KVM switches}} * [[Console server]] * [[Intel vPro]] * [[Remote graphics unit]] * [[Dynamic device mapping]] * [[Display Control Channel]] ==References== {{Reflist}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Kvm Switch}} [[Category:Computer peripherals]] [[Category:Input/output]] [[Category:Out-of-band management]] [[ca:KVM]] [[cs:KVM Switch]] [[de:KVM-Switch]] [[es:Switch KVM]] [[eo:KVM (aparataĵo)]] [[fr:Commutateur écran-clavier-souris]] [[ko:KVM 스위치]] [[id:KVM switch]] [[it:Switch KVM]] [[kk:КВМ]] [[nl:KVM-switch]] [[ja:KVMスイッチ]] [[pl:Przełącznik KVM]] [[ru:KVM-переключатель]] [[fi:KVM-kytkin]] [[ta:விசைப்பலகை, திரை, சுட்டி நிலைமாற்றி]] [[tr:KVM switch]] [[uk:KVM-перемикач]] [[vi:KVM]] [[zh:KVM切换器]]</text> </page> <page> <id>20378</id> <title>KWrite</title> <text>{{Infobox software | name = KDE Software Compilation 4 <!-- name of Software Compilation (Note: If you don't put the right thing here it breaks the latest release / latest preview fields when "frequently updated" is enabled.

The main difference between KYPS and similar [[password management]] technologies is that the password is never disclosed to the local computer. This makes KYPS effective against password theft by [[spyware]] or [[keyloggers]], particularly when using public computers such as in an [[Internet cafe]] <ref name="csie">[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?isnumber=5170943&arnumber=5170963&count=169&index=17 Accessing Password-Protected Resources without the Password]</ref>. The following figure sketches the login method of KYPS. Note that the user's password is not disclosed to the computer he uses. It is, however, disclosed to the KYPS server. The system therefore requires that the user trusts the provider of the service.
