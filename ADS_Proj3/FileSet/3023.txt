All videos and DVDs (except for exempt videos such as music videos and educational material) must be submitted for classification by the IFCO and then displayed on the front of the packaging, the back of the packaging and on the individual discs. The rating of a movie may be appealed up to six months after the release of a film. After this period expires the same uncut film is not allowed to be appealed until at least seven years after the release. Originally, IFCO used to ban far more films, however they still occasionally ban films (i.e. [[Boy Eats Girl]] was banned due to a suicide attempt but was appealed and was re-rated as 15A). ==Italy== It was enforced since 1963 and all films aimed to be shown in Italy are classified into one of the following categories by the [[Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities (Italy)|Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities]]: *'''T''': All ages admitted.
