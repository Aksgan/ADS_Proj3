a research group led by [[Kees van Hee]] at [[TU Eindhoven]]. The first versions ran on [[SunOS]] 4 [[operating system]] with the [[SunView]] windowing system. Later versions used the [[XView]] window toolkit. A port was done to [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] 2. From 1995, a [[Microsoft Windows]] version of the user interface was developed using the [[XVT]] windowing toolkit by [[Bakkenist]], a consultancy firm, and a [[COM server]] interface to the simulator was added. In the latter form the simulator is part of the [[Protos]] process modeling tool. ==ExSpecT today== Today, ExSpecT is used in education and research, and finds some commercial use; the software is kept alive, but is not under active development.

The unit symbol for the exabyte is EB. When used with byte multiples, the unit indicates a power of 1000: * 1 EB = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 B = 10<sup>18</sup> bytes = 1 billion gigabytes = 1 million terabytes The term ''[[exbibyte]]'', using a [[binary prefix]], is used for powers of 1024 bytes. In principle, the [[64-bit]] microprocessors found in many computers can [[address space|address]] 16 exbibytes, or just over 18 exabytes, of memory.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/zoslnctr/v1r7/topic/com.ibm.zconcepts.doc/zconcepts_102.html | title=A brief history of virtual storage and 64-bit addressability | accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref> ==Exabyte in use== In 2004, the global monthly [[Internet traffic]] passed 1 exabyte for the first time.
