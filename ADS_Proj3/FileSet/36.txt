may reflect either labor market disequilibrium or labor market equilibrium. In either case, it shows how much output is supplied by firms at various potential price levels. The equation for the aggregate supply curve in general terms for the case of excess supply in the labor market, called the short-run aggregate supply curve, is :<math>Y=Y^{s}(W/P, \ \ P/P^{e}, \ \ Z_2)</math> where W is the nominal wage rate (exogenous due to stickiness in the short run), P<sup>e</sup> is the anticipated (expected) price level, and Z<sub>2</sub> is a vector of exogenous variables that can affect the position of the labor demand curve (the capital stock or the current state of technological knowledge). The real wage has a negative effect on firms' employment of labor and hence on aggregate supply. The price level relative to its expected level has a positive effect on aggregate supply because of firms' mistakes in production plans due to mis-predictions of prices. The long-run aggregate supply curve refers not to a time frame in which the capital stock is free to be set optimally (as would be the terminology in the micro-economic theory of the firm), but rather to a time frame in which wages are free to adjust in order to equilibrate the labor market and in which price anticipations are accurate. In this case the nominal wage rate is endogenous and so does not appear as an independent variable in the aggregate supply equation. The long-run aggregate supply equation is simply :<math>Y=Y^{s}(Z_2)</math> and is vertical at the full-employment level of output. In this long-run case, Z<sub>2</sub> also includes factors affecting the position of the labor supply curve (such as population), since in labor market equilibrium the location of labor supply affects the labor market outcome. ==Shifts of aggregate demand and aggregate supply== The following summarizes the exogenous events that could shift the aggregate supply or aggregate demand curve to the right. Of course, exogenous events happening in the opposite direction would shift the relevant curve in the opposite direction. ===Shifts of aggregate demand=== The following exogenous events would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right. As a result, the price level would go up. In addition if the time frame of analysis is the short run, so the aggregate supply curve is upward sloping rather than vertical, real output would go up; but in the long run with aggregate supply vertical at full employment, real output would remain unchanged. Aggregate demand shifts emanating from the IS curve: * An exogenous increase in consumer spending * An exogenous increase in investment spending on [[physical capital]] * An exogenous increase in intended inventory investment * An exogenous increase in government spending on goods and services * An exogenous increase in [[transfer payments]] from the government to the people * An exogenous decrease in taxes levied * An exogenous increase in purchases of the country's exports by people in other countries * An exogenous decrease in imports from other countries Aggregate demand shifts emanating from the LM curve: * An exogenous increase in the nominal money supply * An exogenous decrease in the demand for money (in liquidity preference) ===Shifts of aggregate supply=== The following exogenous events would shift the short-run aggregate supply curve to the right. As a result, the price level would drop and real GDP would increase. * An exogenous decrease in the wage rate * An increase in the physical capital stock * Technological progress &mdash; improvements in our knowledge of how to transform capital and labor into output The following events would shift the long-run aggregate supply curve to the right: * An increase in population * An increase in the physical capital stock * Technological progress ==See also== * [[IS/LM model]] * [[AD-IA Model]] * [[DAD-SAS model]] ==External links== {{commonscat|Aggregate supply and demand curves}} * [http://www.sparknotes.com/economics/macro/aggregatesupply/section3.rhtml Sparknotes: Aggregate Supply and Aggregate Demand] brief explanation of the AD-AS model * [http://ingrimayne.com/econ/optional/ISLM/Aggregate.html "Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply" in ''CyberEconomics'' by Robert Schenk] explains the AD-AS model and explains its relation to the IS/LM model * [http://www.whitenova.com/thinkEconomics/simul.html "ThinkEconomics: Macroeconomic Phenomena in the AD/AS Model"] includes an interactive graph demonstrating inflationary changes in a graph based on the AD-AS model * [http://www.whitenova.com/thinkEconomics/adas.html "ThinkEconomics: The Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply Model"] includes an interactive AD-AS graph that tests one's knowledge of how the AD and AS curves shift under different conditions ===Scholarly articles=== * Dutt, Amitava K.and Skott, Peter.

For the Babylonian and Summerian god of wisdom, see [[Adapa]].'' '''ADAPA''' is intrinsically a predictive decisioning platform. It combines the power of [[predictive analytics]] and [[business rules]] to facilitate the tasks of managing and designing automated decisioning systems. ==Automated decisions== When first released, ADAPA (Adaptive Decision And Predictive Analytics) was purely a scoring engine, used to produce scores out of [[statistical model]]s expressed in [[PMML]] (Predictive Model Markup Language) format. With the addition of a rules engine to its core, ADAPA is now able to seamlessly combine rules and predictive models, which enables businesses to manage and design automated decisioning systems. In this way, ADAPA allows for the concretization of [[Enterprise Decision Management]] (EDM) solutions. ==PMML support and predictive analytics== [[Predictive analytics]] comprises a series of modeling techniques which can be used to extract relevant patterns present in large amounts of data to better predict the future. ADAPA is able to generate scores out of a variety of predictive modeling techniques expressed in [[PMML]]. PMML provides a
