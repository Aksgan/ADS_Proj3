It is designed for working rapidly with a large volume of images, unlike similar tools, such as [[UFRaw]], which are designed to work on one image at a time. Rawstudio is currently at a very early stage of development and currently only the latest revision supports [[demosaicing]]. Rawstudio reads RAW images using [[DCRaw]] and supports [[color management]] using [[LittleCMS]] to allow the user to apply color profiles (see also [[Linux color management]]). Rawstudio supports virtually every variety of RAW format from all digital camera manufacturers, thanks to the extensive camera support of DCRaw. ==External links== {{Portal|Free software}} * [http://rawstudio.org/screenshots.php Rawstudio screenshots] {{Portal|Photography}} [[Category:Free photo software]] [[Category:Digital photography]] [[Category:GTK+]] {{Graphics-software-stub}} [[ca:Rawstudio]] [[de:Rawstudio]] [[ru:Rawstudio]]</text> </page> <page> <id>31368</id> <title>Razorback2</title> <text>'''Razorback2''' was a [[Server (computing)|server]] (195.245.244.243) of the [[eDonkey network]], known for being able to handle 1 million users simultaneously, meaning that it had capacity for 1.3 million users and was indexing around 170 million files. ==Use of the Server== *Use of the Server by Jamendo, a French website on [[Creative Commons]] music.<ref>http://www.jamendo.com/</ref> *Use by Ratiatum.com, a website about p2p for legal program sharing like Free software or other.<ref>http://www.ratiatum.com/tel.php</ref><ref>http://www.ratiatum.com/logd231_Winamp.html</ref> *Use by [[Folding@home]]<ref>http://ratiatum.com/news2875_Razorback_pas_de_craintes_pour_les_utilisateurs.html</ref><ref>http://www.zeropaid.com/news/6176/Razorback:+no+fears+for+the+users</ref> *The server was also an index server<ref>http://ratiatum.com/news2888_Razorback_pas_d_effet_sur_le_traffic_eDonkey_et_eMule.html</ref> and so it indexed all content including illegal content, according to Maître Sébastien Fanti this was legal in all European countries.

This was done after a local judge authorized the confiscation at the datacenter in [[Zaventem]] near [[Brussels]], after a denouncement of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA), in collaboration with the [[IFPI|International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]. After the police shut down the site and confiscated the servers however, [http://torrentfreak.com/p2p-is-unstoppable/ P2P traffic stayed much the same], it has even grown 20% since then. {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} The [[MPAA]] Chairman and CEO [[Dan Glickman]], presented this raid as a "major victory": {{cquote|This is a major victory in our fight to cut off the supply of illegal materials being circulated on the Internet via peer-to-peer networks.

Afterwards, the Swiss anti-piracy tech firm Logistep SA was hired to help further intimidate and prosecute filesharing users.<ref>[http://www.razorback2.com/ Resurrected Razorback2 website (in French)]</ref> The raid on Razorback2 was part of a series of raids on [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing]] websites or [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] trackers initiated by the [[MPAA]].
