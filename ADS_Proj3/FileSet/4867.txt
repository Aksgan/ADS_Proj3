IBM PC, NEC 8201, Tandy Color Computer, Model 1000, 1200, 2000 and TRS-80 Model I, III, 4 and 4p. The '''RC-20 Wrist Computer''' was released in 1985.<ref name="seiko"/> It had a SMC84C00 8-bit Z-80 microprocessor; 8K of ROM and 2K of RAM. It had applications for scheduling, memos, and world time and a four-function calculator app. The dot-matrix LCD displayed 42x32 pixels, and more importantly, was touch-sensitive. Like the RC-1000, it could be connected to a personal computer, in this case through a proprietary cable. It was also notable in that it could be programmed, although its small display and limited storage severely limited application development.<ref name="seiko"/> The '''RC-4000 PC Datagraph''' also released in 1985, was dubbed the "world's smallest computer terminal".<ref name="seiko"/> It had 2K of storage. The '''RC-4500''' (1985), also known as the WristMac, had the same features as the RC-4000, but came in a variety of bright, flashy colors. ===Other brands=== {{Expand section|date=September 2010}} During the 1980s, Casio began to market a successful line of "computer watches", in addition to its [[calculator watch]]es. Most notable was the [[Casio data bank]] series. There was also the [[Nelsonic game watch]]es and many other novelty "game watches" produced by Casio and other companies. ==Linux watch== In June 2000, [[IBM]] displayed a prototype for a wristwatch that ran [[Linux]]. The original version had only 6 hours of battery life, which was later extended to 12.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Shankland |first=Stephen|title= IBM clocks in with new Linux watch|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1040-254658.html|accessdate=15 September 2010|newspaper=[[Cnet.com]]|date=23 March 2001 }}</ref> It featured 8MB of memory and ran Linux 2.2.<ref name="IBM">{{Cite web|title= Linux on a Wrist Watch|url=http://researchweb.watson.ibm.com/WearableComputing/linuxwatch/lcdwatch/factsheet.html|publisher=IBM|accessdate=15 September 2010}}</ref> The device was later upgraded with an accelerometer, vibrating mechanism, and fingerprint sensor.

The same materials can also be used for [[symbol]]ic or [[Representation (arts)|representational]] [[drawing]]s. [[Building material]] on which writings or drawings are produced are not included. The gross characterization of writing materials is by the material constituting the writing surface (for example, [[paper]]) and the number, size, and usage and storage configuration of multiple surfaces (for example, paper sheets) into a single object (for example, a [[spiral notebook]]). Writing materials are often paired with specific types of writing instruments. Other important attributes of a writing material are its reusability, its permanence, and its resistance to fraudulent misuse. ==Archaeology== Because drawing preceded writing, the first remains of writing materials are the [[Rock (geology)|stone]] walls of the caves on which the famous images were drawn. Another precursor were [[tally stick]]s used to record the count of objects or the passage of discrete units of time ([[days]]). Tally sticks have been found made of [[wood]] and of [[bone]]. Knotted ropes and similar materials were also used for tallies. Such materials did not take a great deal of
