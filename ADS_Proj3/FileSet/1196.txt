it may be a form of [[Steganography]], where a party communicates a secret message embedded in the digital signal. In either case, as in visible watermarking, the objective is to attach ownership or other descriptive information to the signal in a way that is difficult to remove. It also is possible to use hidden embedded information as a means of covert communication between individuals. One application of watermarking is in [[copyright]] protection systems, which are intended to prevent or deter unauthorized copying of digital media. In this use, a copy device retrieves the watermark from the signal before making a copy; the device makes a decision whether to copy or not, depending on the contents of the watermark. Another application is in ''source tracing''. A watermark is embedded into a digital signal at each point of distribution. If a copy of the work is found later, then the watermark may be retrieved from the copy and the source of the distribution is known. This technique reportedly has been used to detect the source of illegally copied movies. ''Annotation'' of digital photographs with descriptive information is another application of invisible watermarking. While some file formats for digital media may contain additional information called [[metadata]], digital watermarking is distinctive in that the data is carried right in the signal. ==Applications== Digital watermarking may be used for a wide range of applications, such as: * [[Copy protection|Copyright protection]] * Source tracking (different recipients get differently watermarked content) * Broadcast monitoring (television news often contains watermarked video from international agencies) * Covert communication == Digital watermarking life-cycle phases == [[Image:watermark life cycle.svg|thumb|center|750px|General digital watermark life-cycle phases with embedding-, attacking-, and detection and retrieval functions]] The information to be embedded in a signal is called a digital watermark, although in some contexts the phrase digital watermark means the difference between the watermarked signal and the cover signal. The signal where the watermark is to be embedded is called the ''host'' signal. A watermarking system is usually divided into three distinct steps, embedding, attack, and detection. In embedding, an algorithm accepts the host and the data to be embedded, and produces a watermarked signal. Then the watermarked digital signal is transmitted or stored, usually transmitted to another person. If this person makes a modification, this is called an ''attack''. While the modification may not be malicious, the term attack arises from copyright protection application, where ''pirates'' attempt to remove the digital watermark through modification. There are many possible modifications, for example, lossy compression of the data (in which resolution is diminished), cropping an image or video, or intentionally adding noise. ''Detection'' (often called extraction) is an algorithm which is applied to the attacked signal to attempt to extract the watermark from it. If the signal was unmodified during transmission, then the watermark still is present and it may be extracted. In ''robust'' digital watermarking applications, the extraction algorithm should be able to produce the watermark correctly, even if the modifications were strong. In ''fragile'' digital watermarking, the extraction algorithm should fail if any change is made to the signal. ==Classification== A digital watermark is called ''robust'' with respect to transformations if the embedded information may be detected reliably from the marked signal, even if degraded by any number of transformations. Typical image degradations are JPEG compression, rotation, cropping, additive noise, and [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]]. For video content, temporal modifications and MPEG compression often are added to this list. A digital watermark is called ''imperceptible'' if the watermarked content is perceptually equivalent to the original, unwatermarked content.<ref>Khan, A. and Mirza, A. M. 2007.

Fragile watermarks are commonly used for tamper detection (integrity proof). Modifications to an original work that clearly are noticeable, commonly are not referred to as watermarks, but as generalized [[barcode]]s. A digital watermark is called ''semi-fragile'' if it resists benign transformations, but fails detection after malignant transformations. Semi-fragile watermarks commonly are used to detect malignant transformations. A digital watermark is called ''robust'' if it resists a designated class of transformations. Robust watermarks may be used in copy protection applications to carry copy and no access control information. === Perceptibility === A digital watermark is called ''imperceptible'' if the original cover signal and the marked signal are (close to) perceptually indistinguishable. A digital watermark is called ''perceptible'' if its presence in the marked signal is noticeable, but non-intrusive. === Capacity === The length of the embedded message determines two different main classes of digital watermarking schemes: * The message is conceptually zero-bit long and the system is designed in order to detect the presence or the absence of the watermark in the marked object. This kind of watermarking scheme is usually referred to as ''Italic zero-bit'' or ''Italic presence watermarking schemes''. Sometimes, this type of watermarking scheme is called 1-bit watermark, because a 1 denotes the presence (and a 0 the absence) of a watermark. * The message is a n-bit-long stream (<math>m=m_1\ldots m_n,\; n\in\N</math>, with <math>n=|m|</math>) or <math>M=\{0,1\}^n</math> and is modulated in the watermark. These kinds of schemes usually are referred to as multiple-bit watermarking or non-zero-bit watermarking schemes. === Embedding method === A digital watermarking method is referred to as ''[[Spread Spectrum|spread-spectrum]]'' if the marked signal is obtained by an additive modification. Spread-spectrum watermarks are known to
