the rapidly evolving digital world. They recommended that the Library, working with other federal and non-federal institutions, take the lead in a national, cooperative effort to archive and preserve digital information.<ref>[http://www.nap.edu/books/0309071445/html/ LC 21: A Digital Strategy for the Library of Congress]</ref> In December 2000, Congress appropriated up to $100 million ($75 million of which was slated for dollar for dollar cost matching) for the effort. Congress rescinded $47 million in unspent funds in 2007. In 2009, NDIIPP received about $6.5 as a line item in the Library's annual budget appropriation. ==Congressional legislation== The U.S. Congress has asked the Library of Congress to lead a collaborative project, called the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program. In December 2000, Congress passed special legislation (Public Law 106-554) in recognition of the importance of preserving digital content for future generations, appropriating $100 million to the Library of Congress to lead this effort. (A government-wide rescission of .22 percent in late December 2000 reduced this special appropriation to $99.8 million.) This effort falls within the Library's mission, which is "to make its resources available and useful to Congress and the American people and to sustain and preserve a universal collection of knowledge and creativity for future generations." This mission extends to materials in electronic formats as well. In addition, the Library is the home of the U.S. Copyright Office and is thus already engaged in issues relating to copyright in a digital environment. ==Participating organizations == The National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program is a cooperative effort. The Library is working closely with partners to assess considerations for shared responsibilities. Federal legislation calls for the Library to work jointly with the Secretary of Commerce, the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the National Archives and Records Administration. The legislation also directs the Library to seek the participation of "other federal, research and private libraries and institutions with expertise in the collection and maintenance of archives of digital materials," including the National Library of Medicine, the National Agricultural Library, the Research Libraries Group, the Online Computer Library Center and the Council on Library and Information Resources. The Library is also working with the non-federal sector. The overall strategy is being executed in cooperation with the library, creative, publishing, technology and copyright communities. In early 2001 the Library established a National Digital Strategy Advisory Board to help guide it through the planning process. This board is made up of experts from the technology, publishing, Internet, library and intellectual-property communities as well as government. The Library has also established a working group to look at ways that current copyright law can address how libraries and archives handle digital materials when preserving them and making them available to users. ==National significance== The availability of electronic information is today taken for granted. With the rapid growth of the [[Internet]] and the [[World Wide Web]], millions of people have grown accustomed to using these tools as resources to acquire information â€” from a Ph.D. candidate conducting research for a dissertation to a teacher who might not be able to take a class on a field trip to see historical artefacts to a lifelong learner. Digital has become the principal medium to create, distribute and store content, from text to motion pictures to recorded sound. Digital content now embodies much of the nation's intellectual, social and cultural history. Because digital materials can be so easily altered, corrupted or even lost, these materials must be saved now if they are to remain available to today's and tomorrow's generations. NDIIPP is providing a national focus on important policy, standards and technical components necessary to preserve digital content. Investments in modeling and testing various options and technical solutions will take place over several years, resulting in recommendations to the U.S. Congress about the most viable and sustainable options for long-term preservation. ==Digital preservation partnership projects== Included in the 170+ partners (as of August 2010) are eight consortial partnerships comprising 33 institutions that are selecting, collecting and preserving specific types of digital content: * [http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/DATAPASS/ Data-PASS] * [http://www.dotcomarchive.org/ Dot Com Archive] * [http://www.ndiipp.uiuc.edu/ ECHO DEPository] * [http://netpreserve.org/ International Internet Preservation Consortium] * [http://www.metaarchive.org/ MetaArchive] * [http://ngda.org/index.php National Geospatial Digital Archive] * [http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/ncgdap/ North Carolina Geospatial Data Archiving Project] * [http://www.ptvdigitalarchive.org/ Preserving Digital Public Television] * [http://www.cdlib.org/inside/projects/preservation/webatrisk/ Web at Risk] ==External links== <references/> * [http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/ National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program] * [http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/dli2/html/lcndlp.html Library of Congress, National Digital Library Program] * [http://www.loc.gov/webcapture/ The Library of Congress, Web Archiving] {{DEFAULTSORT:National Digital Information Infrastructure And Preservation Program}} [[Category:Archival science]] [[Category:Library of Congress|Digital Library project]] [[Category:Preservation (library and archival science)]] [[Category:Web archives]] [[Category:Geographic region-oriented digital libraries]] [[Category:Digital libraries]]</text> </page> <page> <id>25838</id> <title>National Geospatial Digital Archive</title> <text>{{Primarysources|date=August 2008}} The '''National Geospatial Digital Archive''' is an archive of [[cartographic]] information funded by the [[Library of Congress]], [[University of California Santa Barbara]], and [[Stanford University]]. == Overview == {{Newsrelease|date=August 2008}} === Introduction === From the first colonial maps to the satellite imagery of the 21st century, cartographic information has helped define and frame our view of the [[United States]]. Geospatial imagery is now a critical tool for state and federal researchers pursuing greater understandings of complex matters including [[disaster relief]], [[census]] data, and [[Land management|land use management]]. Concerned that millions of nationally important digital information resources are in danger of being lost or corrupted, the Library of Congress formed The National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIIPP). As partners in the project the university libraries of UCSB and Stanford are leading the formation of the National Geospatial Digital Archive (NGDA), a collecting network for the archiving of geospatial images and data. They have partnered with eight institutions to begin a three year, $15 million effort to begin construction of a nationwide digital collection and preservation system. === Objectives === The objectives of the project are to: * Create a new national federated network committed to archiving geospatial imagery and data. * Investigate the proper and optimal roles of such a federated archive, with
