By storing all the technical necessary applications on a [[SIM card]], the mobile phone has turned into a device for managing each person’s [[digital identity]]. '''Mobile Identity''' is a development of the traditional online authentication and digital signing; the [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM]] card of one’s mobile phone works as an identity tool. Mobile Identity enables legally binding authentication and transaction signing for online banking, payment confirmation, corporate services, and consuming online content. The user’s certificates are maintained on the telecom operator’s SIM card and in order to use them, the user has to enter a personal, secret PIN code. When using Mobile Identity, no separate card reader is needed, as the phone itself already performs both functions. In contrast to other approaches, the mobile phone in conjunction with a mobile signature-enabled [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM]] card offers the same security and superior ease of use than for example [[Smart cards]] in existing [[Digital identity]] management systems.[[Smart card]]-based digital identities can only be used in conjunction with a [[card reader]] and a [[Personal computer|PC]]. In addition, distributing and managing the cards has become a logistical [[nightmare]], exacerbated by the lack of interoperability between services relying on such a [[digital identity]]. With the [[mobile signature]] concept, there are a number of private company [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] that have an inherent interest in setting up a [[mobile signature]] service infrastructure thus offering mobile identity services. These stakeholders are mobile network operators and to a certain extent financial institutions or service providers with an existing large customer base, that could leverage the use of mobile signatures across several applications. ==Status quo in different countries== {{Empty section|date=July 2010}} ==Finland== The [[Finland|Finnish]] government has supervised the deployment of a common derivative of the [[ETSI]]-based mobile signature service standard, thus allowing the [[Finland|Finnish]] [[mobile operators]] to offer [[mobile signature]] services. The Finnish government [[CA]]{{dn}} also issues the certificates that link the [[digital]] keys on the [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM]] card to the person’s real world identity. ;references *http://www.valimo.com/news_and_events/01-09-2009/uusi-laki-sahkoisesta-tunnistamisesta-astui-voimaan *http://www.vrk.fi/vrk/home.nsf/pages/9C0B5FFC32EC6AF2C225724400511298?opendo ==Sweden== The need for new authentication solutions like [[Mobile Identity]] in the Nordic region is rapidly growing as governments, public sector and financial institutions are increasingly offering online and mobile channels to access their services. These new services require more secure and user-friendly authentication methods. In Sweden a consortium owned by banks and mobile operators ([http://wpki.com WPK.Net]) is specifying a mobile signature service infrastructure that is first used by banks to authenticate online banking users. Later on the mobile signature services is supposed to be available for other applications as well. Telenor Sweden has provided technology for the company's [[mobile signature]] services in Sweden since 2009. Telenor enables its customers a convenient and secure login to online services using their mobile phone for authentication and digital signing. ;references http://www.wpki.net http://www.valimo.com/news_and_events/16-02-2009/valimo-and-telenor-sweden-collaborate-mobile-authentication-technology ==Estonia== The Estonian government has issued all citizens with a Smart card, but citizens are using the [[digital identity]] sparsely. There is now a concerted effort from the private industry to leverage the Estonian [[CA]]{{dn}} landscape and deploy mobile signature services, thus enabling Estonian citizens to port their existing [[digital identity]] to the mobile phone. ==Turkey== The mobile operator [[Turkcell]] has bought a mobile signature service infrastructure and has
