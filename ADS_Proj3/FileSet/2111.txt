For this product ''MM'' to be [[Matrix multiplication|conformable for multiplication]], ''M'' must necessarily be a [[square matrix]]. ==Properties== With the exception of the [[identity matrix]], an idempotent matrix is [[singular matrix|singular]]; that is, its number of independent rows (and columns) is less than its number of rows (and columns). This can be seen from writing ''MM = M'', assuming that ''M'' has full rank (is non-singular), and pre-multiplying by ''M''<sup>−1</sup> to obtain ''M'' = ''M''<sup>−1</sup>''M'' = ''I''. When an idempotent matrix is subtracted from the identity matrix, the result is also idempotent. This holds since [''I'' − ''M''][''I'' − ''M''] = ''I'' − ''M'' − ''M'' + ''M''<sup>2</sup> = ''I'' − ''M'' − ''M'' + ''M'' = ''I'' − ''M''. The [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of an idempotent matrix — the sum of the elements on its main diagonal — equals the [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] of the matrix and thus is always an integer. This provides an easy way of computing the rank, or alternatively an easy way of determining the trace of a matrix whose elements are not specifically known (which is helpful in [[econometrics]], for example, in establishing the degree of [[bias (statistics)|bias]] in using a [[variance|sample variance]] as an estimate of a [[variance|population variance]]). ==Applications== Idempotent matrices arise frequently in [[regression analysis]] and [[econometrics]]. For example, in [[ordinary least squares]], the regression problem is to choose a vector <math>\beta</math> of coefficient estimates so as to minimize the sum of squared residuals (mispredictions) ''e''<sub>''i''</sub>: in matrix form, :<math>\text{Minimize } (y - X \beta)^T(y - X \beta) \, </math> where ''y'' is a vector of [[Dependent and independent variables#Use in statistics|dependent variable]] observations, and ''X'' is a matrix each of whose columns is a column of observations on one of the [[Dependent and independent variables#Use in statistics|independent variables]]. The resulting estimator is :<math>\beta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty \, </math> where superscript ''T'' indicates a [[transpose]], and the vector of residuals is<ref name=Greene/> :<math>e = y - X \beta = y - X(X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty = [I - X(X^TX)^{-1}X^T]y = My. \, </math> Here both ''M'' and <math>X(X^TX)^{-1}X^T</math> are idempotent matrices, a fact which allows simplification when the sum of squared residuals is computed: :<math> e^Te = (My)^T(My) = y^TM^TMy = y^TMMy = y^TMy. \, </math> The idempotency of ''M'' plays a role in other calculations as well, such as in determining the variance of the estimator <math>\beta</math>. ==See also== * [[Projection (linear algebra)]] ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Mathematics]] [[Category:Algebra]] [[Category:Econometrics]]</text> </page> <page> <id>17843</id> <title>Identification (information)</title> <text>{{unreferenced|article|date=April 2008}} The function of '''identification''' is to map a known quantity to an unknown entity so as to make it known. The known quantity is called the identifier (or ID) and the unknown entity is what needs identification. A basic requirement for identification is that the ID be unique. IDs may be scoped, that is, they are unique only within a particular scope. IDs may also be built out of a collection of quantities such that they are unique on the collective. '''Identification''' is the capability to find, retrieve, report, change, or delete specific [[data]] without [[ambiguity]]. This applies especially to [[information]] stored in [[database]]s. In [[database normalization]], it is the central, defining function to the discipline. ==Example== To retrieve the data stored about an individual with the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) of the [[United States]], the IRS needs to be supplied with the individual's [[Social Security number]] (SSN). The SSN, then, "identifies" a unique individual to the IRS. No other living person has that SSN, and that individual is assumed to not have more than one SSN. Other data that the individual's SSN identifies with the IRS would be such things as his or her name, birthdate, and current employer. == See also == * [[Authentication]] * [[Identification (disambiguation)]] * [[Profiling]] * [[Profiling practices]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Identification (Information)}} [[Category:Identification]] [[Category:Data modeling]] {{technology-stub}} [[lv:Identifikācija (datorzinātnē)]] [[nl:Identificatie (informatica)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>17857</id> <title>Identity Management Theory</title> <text>{{No footnotes|date=May 2009}} '''Identity Management Theory''' (also frequently referred to as IMT) is an [[intercultural communication]] theory from the 1990s. It was developed by [[William R. Cupach]] and Tadasu Todd Imahori on the basis of Erving Goffman's ''Interaction ritual: Essays on face-to-face behavior'' (1967). Cupach and Imahori distinguish between intercultural [[communication]] (speakers from different [[culture]]s) and intracultural communication (speakers sharing the same culture). To understand IMT, it is important to be familiar with Cupach and Imahori's view of [[Cultural identity|identities]]. Among the multiple identities which an individual possesses, cultural and relational identities are regarded as essential to IMT. Cupach and Imahori claim that presenting one's [[face]] shows facets of an individual's identity. Whether an interlocuter is able to maintain face or not, reveals his or her interpersonal [[Metacommunicative competence|communication competence]]. The use of [[stereotype]]s in intercultural conversations often results from the ignorance of each other's culture; the application of stereotypes, however, is face threatening. Being able to manage the resulting tensions, is part of intercultural communication competence. For becoming competent in developing intercultural relationships, the following three phases have to be passed: # "trial
