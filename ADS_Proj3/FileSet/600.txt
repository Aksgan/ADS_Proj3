Currently, he is active in the area of [[software architecture]]s, especially evolvable and distributed software architectures for ubiquitous and pervasive computer applications. His long term goal has been to contribute to making software more and more dependable, basing it on solid and rigorous methodological and theoretical foundations. Ghezzi has co-authored over 180 papers, almost all of which are published internationally. His papers appeared on prestigious journals like the ''[[Journal of the ACM]]'', ''Information and Control'' (now ''[[Information and Computation]]''), ''[http://tosem.acm.org/ ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology]'', ''[http://userweb.cs.utexas.edu/~toplas/ ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems]'', ''[[IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering]]''. He is the co-author of 8 books, including: * ''Programming Language Concepts''. With [[Mehdi Jazayeri|M. Jazayeri]]. (First edition: [[John Wiley & Sons]], 1982; ISBN 0-471-08755-6.

The primary purpose of the framework is for educational research and analysis, where it is often important to identify groups of roughly comparable institutions.<ref>{{cite web | title = The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education | publisher = Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching | date= no date | url = http://classifications.carnegiefoundation.org/ | accessdate = 3 January 2010 }}</ref> The classification includes all [[School accreditation|accredited]], [[academic degree|degree]]-granting colleges and universities in the United States that are represented in the [[National Center for Education Statistics]] [[Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System]] (IPEDS). The Carnegie Classification was created by the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]] (hereafter referred to as "The Carnegie Foundation") in 1973; reports were issued in that year, 1976, 1987, 1994, and 2000. The latest report, issued in 2005, has substantially reworked the classification system. It is based on data from the 2002–2003 and 2003–2004 school years.<ref> {{cite web | title = Basic Classification Technical Details | publisher = Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching | date= 2005 | url = http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=805 | accessdate = 24 September 2008 }} </ref> ==General description== Information used in these classifications comes primarily from IPEDS and the [[College Board]]. Classifications of particular institutions can be found on the Carnegie Foundation's [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/sub.asp?key=782 Institution Lookup website]. ==Basic classification== The number of institutions in each category is indicated in parentheses.<ref name="BasicClassSum"> {{cite web | title = Basic Classification Tables | publisher = Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching | date= 2005 | url = http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=805 | accessdate = 24 September 2008 }} </ref> ===Doctorate-granting Universities=== Doctorate-granting Universities are those institutions that awarded at least 20 doctorates in 2003–04. These Universities are further classified by their level of research activity, as measured by research expenditures, number of research doctorates awarded, number of research-focused faculty, and other factors.<ref name=BasicTechnical /> *Research Universities (RU/VH) (very high research activity) (96) *Research Universities (RU/H) (high research activity) (103) *Doctoral/Research Universities (DRU) (83) ===Master’s Colleges and Universities=== Master’s Colleges and Universities are those institutions which "awarded at least 50 master’s degrees in 2003–04, but fewer than 20 doctorates." <ref name=BasicTechnical /> *Master’s Colleges and Universities (Master’s/L) (Larger Programs – awarding at least 200 Masters-level degrees) (346) *Master’s Colleges and Universities (Master’s/M) (Medium Programs – awarding 100–199 Masters level degrees) (190) *Master’s Colleges and Universities (Master’s/S) (Smaller Programs – awarding 50-99 Masters level degrees)
