parliaments, centres of excellence, international organizations, the civil society, the private sector and the donor community, with the purpose to enhance the sharing of experiences, the identification of best practices and the implementation of appropriate solutions. ==Follow-up== The task of bridging the digital divide is yet unfinished. The WSIS has called for an [[Internet Governance Forum]]<ref>[http://www.intgovforum.org Internet Governance Forum]</ref> to allow for a global multi-stakeholder discussion of issues related to the governance of the global resource that the Internet represents. The WSIS also called for a follow-up and implementation process, for which the principles embodied in the multi-stakeholder composition and workings of the UN ICT TF can provide a useful model. Work is also being carried on by the UN Group on the Information Society (UN GIS)<ref>[http://www.ungis.org Group on the Information Society]</ref>, with a focus on the UN System, and the successor to the UN ICT TF, the [[Global Alliance for ICT and Development]] (GAID)<ref>[http://www.un-gaid.org Global Alliance for ICT and Development]</ref>, with an international development emphasis. ==Selected documents== *[http://www.un.org/documents/ecosoc/docs/2000/e2000-55.pdf Report of the high-level panel of experts on information and communication technology] (22 May 2000), suggesting a UN ICT Task Force. *[http://www.un.org/documents/ecosoc/docs/2000/e2000-l9.pdf Draft Ministerial Declaration] (11 July 2000), asking for the establishment of the UN ICT TF. ==Publication series== As part of its work, the Task Force and its members have published a series of books on various topics related to the work of the Task Force.

It is now on the [[List of IEEE Milestones]], and one of its machines is on display at the [[National Cryptologic Museum]]. The laboratory was established in 1942 by the Navy and [[National Cash Register Company]] to design and manufacture a series of code-breaking machines ("[[bombe]]s") targeting German [[Enigma machine]]s, based on earlier work by the British at [[Bletchley Park]] (which in turn owed something to pre-war Polish cryptanalytical work). [[Joseph Desch]] led the effort. Preliminary designs, approved in September 1942, called for a fully electronic machine to be delivered by year's end. However, these plans were soon judged infeasible, and revised plans were approved in January 1943 for an electromechanical machine, which became the [[Bombe#US Navy Bombe|US Navy bombe]]. These designs were proceeding in parallel with, and influenced by, British attempts to build a high-speed bombe for the German 4-rotor Enigma. Indeed, [[Alan Turing]] visited Dayton in December 1942. His reaction was far from enthusiastic: :It seems a pity for them to go out of their way to build a machine to do all this stopping if it is not necessary. I am now converted to the extent of thinking that starting from scratch on the design of a Bombe, this method is about as good as our own. The American Bombe program was to produce 336 Bombes, one for each wheel order. I used to smile inwardly at the conception of Bombe hut routine implied by this program. Their test (of commutators) can hardly
