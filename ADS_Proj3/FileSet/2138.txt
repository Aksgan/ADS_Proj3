this particular system of deference indices, speakers have developed an entirely separate lexicon (there are roughly four "everyday" lexical entries for every one "mother-in-law" lexical entry; 4:1) to index deference exigent of contexts inclusive of the mother-in-law. ===Hypercorrection as a social class index=== [[Hypercorrection]] is defined by Wolfram as "the use of speech form on the basis of false analogy."<ref>Wolfram, W. Phonological Variation and change in Trinidadian English-the evolution of the vowel system. Washington: Center for Applied Linguistics, 1969.</ref> DeCamp defines hypercorrection in a more precise fashion claiming that "hypercorrection is an incorrect analogy with a form in a [[prestige]] dialect which the speaker has imperfectly mastered."<ref>DeCamp, D. 'Hypercorrection and Rule Generalization. 1972</ref> Many scholars argue that hypercorrection provides both an index of "social class" and an "Index of Linguistic Insecurity". The latter index can be defined as a speaker's attempts at self-correction in areas of perceived linguistic insufficiencies which denote their lower social standing and minimal social mobility.<ref name=hyper>Winford, Donald. 'Hypercorrection in the Process of Decreolization: The Case of Trinidadian English. Cambridge, England: Cambridge Univserity Press, 1978.</ref> Donald Winford conducted a study that measured the phonological hypercorrection in creolization of English speakers in Trinidad. He claims that the ability to use prestigious norms goes "hand-in-hand" with knowledge of stigmatization afforded to use of "lesser" phonological variants.<ref name=hyper/> He concluded that sociologically "lesser" individuals would try to approximate frequencies of more prestige [[dialectical]] [[vowels]]; yet they did so incorrectly, thus producing the phenomenon known as hypercorrection. This hypercorrection of vowels is an example of non-referential indexicality that indexes, by virtue of innate urges forcing lower class civilians to hypercorrect phonological variants, the actual social class of the speaker. As Silverstein claims, this also conveys an "Index of Linguistic Insecurity" in which a speaker not only indexes their actual social class (via first-order indexicality) but also the insecurities about class constraints and subsequent linguistic effects the encourage hypercorrection in the first place (an incidence of second-order indexicality).<ref name=indexicalorder/> William Labov and many others have also studied how hypercorrection in [[African American Vernacular English]] demonstrates similar social class non-referential indexicality. ===Multiple indices in social identity indexicality=== Multiple non-referential indices can be employed to index the social identity of a speaker. An example of how multiple indexes can constitute social identity is exemplified by Ochs discussion of [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] deletion: "That Bad" in American English can index a speaker to be a child, foreigner, medical patient, or elderly person. Use of multiple non-referential indices at once (for example copula deletion and raising intonation), helps further index the social identity of the speaker as that of a child.<ref name=Ochs>Ochs, Elinor. "Indexicality and Socialization". In J. Stigler, R. Shweder & G. Herdt (eds.) 'Cultural Psychology: Essays on Comparative HUman Development'. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990.</ref> Linguistic and non-linguistic indices are also an important ways of indexing social identity. For example, the Japanese utterance ''-wa'' in conjunction with raising intonation (indexical of increasing affect) by one person who "looks like a woman" and another who looks "like a man" may index different affective dispositions which, in turn, can index gender difference.<ref name=wake/> Ochs and Schieffilen also claim that facial features, gestures, as well as other non-linguistic indices may actually help specify the general information provided by the linguistic features and augment the pragmatic meaning of the utterance.<ref>Ochs, Elinor and Shieffelin, Banbi. "Language has a heart". 'Text 9': 7-25.</ref> ===Oinoglossia ('wine talk')=== For demonstrations of higher (or rarefied) indexical orders, Michael Silverstein discusses the particularities of "life-style emblematization" or "convention-dependent-indexical iconicity" which, as he claims, is prototypical of a phenomenon he dubs "[[wine]] talk." Professional wine critics use a certain "technical vocabulary" that are "metaphorical of [[prestige]] realms of traditional English gentlemanly [[horticulture]]."<ref name=indexicalorder/> Thus, a certain "lingo" is created for this wine that indexically entails certain notions of prestigious social classes or genres. When "yuppies" use the lingo for wine flavors created by the these critics in the ''actual context'' of drinking wine, Silverstein argues that they become the "well-bred, interesting (subtle, balanced, intriguing, winning, etc.) person" that is iconic of the metaphorical "fashion of speaking" employed by people of higher social registers, demanding notoriety as a result of this high level of connoisseurship.<ref name=indexicalorder/> In other words, the wine drinker becomes a refined, gentlemanly critic and, in doing so, adopts a smiliar level of connoisseurship and social refinement. Silverstein defines this as an example of higher-order indexical "authorization" in which the indexical order of this "wine talk" exists in a "complex, interlocking set of institutionally formed macro-sociological interests."<ref name=indexicalorder/> A speaker of English metaphorically transfers him- or herself into the social structure of the "wine world" that is encoded by the ''oinoglossia'' of elite critics using a very particular "technical" terminology. The use of "wine talk" or similar "fine-cheeses talk", "perfume talk","Hegelian-dialects talk", "particle-physics talk", "DNA-sequencing talk" etc. confers upon an individual an identity-by-visible-consumption indexical of a certain macro-sociological elite identity<ref name=indexicalorder/> and is, as such, an instance of higher-order indexicality. ==Deixis and indexicality== The terms ''deixis'' and ''indexicality'' are frequently used near-interchangeably, and both concern essentially the same idea; contextually-dependant references. However, both have different histories and traditions associated with them. In the past, deixis was associated specifically with spatio-temporal reference, while indexicality was used more broadly.<ref>Silverstein, Michael. (1976) "Shifters, linguistic categories, and cultural description". In K. Basso and H. Selby (eds.), Meaning in Anthropology. SAR pp.25</ref> More importantly, each is associated with a different field of study; deixis is associated with linguistics, while indexicality is associated with philosophy.<ref>Levinson, Stephen C. (2006) "Deixis". In Laurence R. Horn, Gregory L. Ward (eds.) The Handbook of Pragmatics, pp. 978&ndash;120. Blackwell Publishing.</ref> ==Extensions== There are various extensions of the basic idea of indexicality, some of which arise outside of linguistics and philosophy of language. One notorious example is [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis's]] ''[[Modal realism|indexicality of actuality]]'', according to which ''actual'' is itself an indexical term, and the [[ontological]] distinction between merely possible worlds and the actual world is just that the actual world is ''this'' world (see
