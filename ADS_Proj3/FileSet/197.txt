It could be considered one of the very first (or even the real first) modern interactive online graphics-and-sound protocol.<ref name=Skyline>{{Cite web| title = BBSDocumentary, An Overview of BBS Programs | url = http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/expanded.html | publisher=Jason Scott for [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] Magazine | author=Scott Lee | accessdate = 2005}}</ref>, as it was introduced in 1987 as part of the Skyline (Atredes) BBS System, running on the program Skyline BBS and Skyterm terminal for the Amiga system. Years before the World Wide Web, Skypix allowed rich interactive graphics and sound, as well as mouse control, to be a part of the online experience, which was until then limited to text and ANSI graphics. Skypix allowed users the ability to write graphical programs and link them into the system, as well as the first "authoring program", Skypaint. Skypix created a large worldwide group of enthusiastic game and online application writers years before the World Wide Web made such features a common part of the online experience. It was quickly abandoned as long as new, more advanced, markup languages for BBS were available and due to the emerging of Internet phenomenon that literally wiped out the BBS system of communication. ==References== <references/> {{Use mdy dates|date=September 2010}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Amiga Internet And Communications Software}} [[Category:Amiga]] [[Category:Amiga software|*Internet and communications]] [[Category:Lists of software]]</text> </page> <page> <id>1743</id> <title>Amit Sheth</title> <text>{{Infobox Person | name = Amit Sheth | image = | caption = Amit Sheth | birth_place = | occupation = Director of Kno.e.sis Center | website = [http://knoesis.wright.edu/amit Amit Sheth] | footnotes = }} Dr. '''Amit Sheth''' is a computer scientist at [[Wright State University]] in [[Dayton]], [[Ohio]].
