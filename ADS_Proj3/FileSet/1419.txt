Examples are the retransmission of [[data frame|frames]] in [[carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance]] (CSMA/CA) and [[carrier sense multiple access with collision detection]] (CSMA/CD) networks, where this algorithm is part of the [[Media access control|channel access]] method used to send data on these network. In [[Ethernet]] networks, the algorithm is commonly used to schedule retransmissions after collisions. The retransmission is delayed by an amount of [[time]] derived from the [[slot time]] and the number of attempts to retransmit. After ''c'' collisions, a random number of slot times between 0 and 2<sup>c</sup> - 1 is chosen. For the first collision, each sender will wait 0 or 1 slot times. After the second collision, the senders will wait anywhere from 0 to 3 slot times ([[Interval (mathematics)|inclusive]]). After the third collision, the senders will wait anywhere from 0 to 7 slot times (inclusive), and so forth. As the number of retransmission attempts increases, the number of possibilities for delay [[exponential growth|increases exponentially]]. The 'truncated' simply means that after a certain number of increases, the exponentiation stops; i.e. the retransmission timeout reaches a ceiling, and thereafter does not increase any further. For example, if the ceiling is set at ''i'' = 10 (as it is in the [[IEEE 802.3]] CSMA/CD standard<ref name="IEEE_802_3">{{Cite web|title=IEEE Standard 802.3-2008|url=http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.3-2008_section1.pdf|publisher=IEEE|accessdate=22 September 2010}}</ref>), then the maximum delay is 1023 slot times. Because these delays cause other stations that are sending to collide as well, there is a possibility that, on a busy network, hundreds of people may be caught in a single collision set. Because of this possibility, after 16 attempts at transmission, the process is aborted.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} ==An example of an exponential backoff algorithm== This example is from the [[Ethernet]] protocol<ref>''Computer Networks'', Peterson and Davie</ref>, where a sending host is able to know when a collision has occurred (that is, another host has tried to transmit), when it is sending a frame. If both hosts attempted to retransmit as soon as a collision occurred, there would be yet another collision &mdash; and the pattern would continue forever. The hosts must choose a random value within an acceptable range to ensure that this situation doesn't happen. An exponential backoff algorithm is therefore used. The figure 51.2μs has been given here as an example. However, 51.2μs could be replaced by any positive value, in practice. # When a collision first occurs, send a “Jamming signal” to prevent further data being sent. # Resend a frame after either 0 seconds or 51.2μs, chosen at random. # If that fails, resend the frame after either 0s, 51.2μs, 102.4μs, or 153.6μs. # If that still doesn't work, resend the frame after k · 51.2μs, where ''k'' is a random number between 0 and 2<sup>3</sup> &minus; 1. # In general, after the ''c''th failed attempt, resend the frame after k · 51.2μs, where ''k'' is a random number between 0 and 2<sup>''c''</sup> &minus; 1. ==Expected backoff== Given a [[uniform distribution (discrete)|uniform distribution]] of backoff times, the [[expected value|expected]] backoff time is the mean of the possibilities. That is, after ''c'' collisions, the number of backoff slots is in [0, 1, ..., ''N''] where ''N'' = 2<sup>''c''</sup> - 1 and the expected backoff time (in slots) is :<math>\frac{1}{N+1}\sum_{i=0}^{N} i</math>. For example, the expected backoff time for the third (''c'' = 3) collision, one could first calculate the maximum backoff time, ''N'': :<math>N = 2^c - 1</math> :<math>N = 2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1</math> :<math>N = 7</math> ... and then calculate the mean of the backoff time possibilities: :<math>\operatorname{E}(c) = \frac{1}{N+1}\sum_{i=0}^{N} i</math> :<math>\operatorname{E}(3) = \frac{1}{7+1}\sum_{i=0}^{7} i = \frac{1}{8}(0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) = \frac{28}{8}</math> :<math>\operatorname{E}(3) = 3.5</math> ... obtaining 3.5 as the expected number of back off slots after 3 collisions. The above derivation is largely unnecessary when you realize that the mean of consecutive integers is equal to the mean of the largest and smallest numbers in the set. That is, the mean of a set '''''A''''' of consecutive integers ''a''<sub>0</sub>, ''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub>, ... ''a''<sub>m</sub> is simply the mean of ''a''<sub>0</sub> and ''a''<sub>m</sub> or (''a''<sub>0</sub> + ''a''<sub>m</sub>) / 2. When applied to the above problem of finding the expected backoff time, the formula becomes simply: :<math>\operatorname{E}(c) = \frac{2^c - 1}{2}</math> ... or otherwise interpreted as half of the maximum backoff time. ==See also== * [[Control theory]] ==References== {{Reflist}} *{{FS1037C}} {{Use dmy dates|date=September 2010}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Exponential Backoff}} [[Category:Networking algorithms]] [[Category:Ethernet]] [[hu:Exponenciális visszalépés]]</text> </page> <page> <id>12882</id> <title>Exposure action value</title> <text>An '''Exposure Action Value''' ('''EAV''') or '''Action Value''' ('''AV''') is a limit set on occupational exposure to noise where beyond those values, employers must take steps to monitor the exposure levels. These levels are measured in [[decibels]]. The American [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) set the EAV to 85 dB(A). When the eight-hour time-weighted average (TWA) reaches 85 dB(A) employers are required to administer a continuing, effective [[hearing conservation program]]. The program consists of monitoring, employee notification, observation, an audiometric testing program, hearing protectors, training programs, and record keeping requirements. == Purpose == The purpose of the EAV is to ensure that employees are not suffering from high levels of noise exposure.
