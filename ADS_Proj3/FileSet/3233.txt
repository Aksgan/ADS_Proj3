component of speech recognition solutions for call automation and leveraged partners to deliver solutions. Many problematic solutions were developed by traditional telephony developers building speech solutions. designing and developing speech solutions requires a different skill-set and mind-set to that of traditional [[DTMF]] solutions. For a couple of years prior to the takeover by ScanSoft, Nuance started selling solutions directly, including their Call-Steering product which was predominantly a call-centre call-routing product which determined the skill group required for the call based on responses to reasonably open questions asked of the caller. Nuance 9.0 is the first release (excluding service packs) of the recogniser product since the acquisition and is an amalgam of the technologies acquired from various companies including Philips Speech Pearl, Speechworks, Nuance Recognizer and others. Further information is not known about this product ---Simplistic Speech Recognition Process--- Developer creates a list of all the phrases to be recognised; or a process to generate these in real-time. Telephony application process User calls the telephony application for call automation Application loads the phrases for the application and prompts the user to provide speech input (asks a question), and opens a stream from the telephony input to the speech recognition software. * User speaks and this is streamed to the recogniser. recogniser returns a number of potential results with probability for each one that it is correct. * Recogniser process Determines the start of speech input uses audio techniques to remove background noise slices the audio into small sections (10 - 100ms in length) determines the sound in each slice matches the combination of sounds for the spoken phrase with the possible sound combinations provided by the possible phrases --- Topology --- A typical Nuance Recogniser configuration required four or five applications to be started, often monitored by a sixth application. NLM - Nuance License Manager; kept a watch on the number concurrent speech calls in use recclient - recognition client; it is the interface between the [[IVR]] speech path and the speech recognising software, the recserver - The recclient can be developed into the IVR software itself. resource-manager - distributes the load over the recservers as required to balance load and to provide fault-tolerance. recserver - where the speech is compared and processed against known vocabulary. grammar-compiler - an application that dynamically adds words or phrases to an expected vocabulary for recognition watchdog - a Windows service or Unix Daemon that monitors and maintains the above processes, restarting them if required. Except for the watchdog which should be running on all the nuance speech servers, the other processes maybe spread over a farm of servers - connected by an IP network with low latency and high-bandwidth - usually a dedicated LAN segment. The resource manager directs which resources it thinks are least utilised. --- Nuance v the competition --- The key difference between Nuance and Speechworks products of the time was that they used different methods for "End-Pointing", the process for determining the beginning and end of speech. Nuance looked for a change in "Voice-Energy" - essentially a significant change in volume within a specific set of frequencies, whereas SpeechWorks tried to look for sound combinations that were likely to be speech based on the phrases pre-loaded into the system. It probably seems that the Nuance method was crude but this was implemented due to the limitations of the computational power available in computer servers at the time and the need to provide high-density applications - i.e. not require too many servers for a deployment. Rumour: The SpeechWorks method has been adopted for Nuance 9.0, due to the abundance of computer processing power. ===Acquisitions=== Prior to the 2005 merger, ScanSoft acquired other companies to expand its business. Unlike ScanSoft, Nuance did not actively acquire companies prior to their merger. After the merge, the company continued to grow through acquisition. ====ScanSoft acquisitions prior to the merger==== * Mar. 2000 &mdash; '''Caere Corp.''', of [[Los Gatos, California]] &mdash; $145 million. Caere had developed [[OmniPage]] (scanner and OCR software.) * December 2001 &mdash; '''[[Lernout & Hauspie]]''', of [[Ieper]], [[Belgium]], Speech and Language division &mdash; $39.5 million :This acquisition occurred following Lernout & Hauspie's bankruptcy proceedings. Previously, [[Lernout & Hauspie]] had acquired these speech technology companies: '''BBS''', '''Berkeley Speech Technologies''' (1996), '''Centigram Communications Corporation''', '''[[Dragon Systems]]''' (2000), '''[[FDC]]''', and '''Kurzweil Applied Intelligence''' (1998). * January 30, 2003 &mdash; Royal Philips Electronics Speech Processing Telephony and Voice Control, Dialogue Systems &mdash; $35.4 million :Philips had previously acquired '''Voice Control Systems''', which had in turn had acquired '''Pure Speech''', '''Scott Instruments''' and '''[[VPC]]'''. * August 11, 2003 &mdash; '''[[SpeechWorks]], Inc.''', of [[Boston, Massachusetts]], &mdash; $132 million :[[SpeechWorks]]' major products were speech recognition and synthesis systems, which were later merged with Nuance's speech product line. It had previously acquired '''Eloquent Technologies, Inc.''', of [[Ithaca, New York]] in 2000 for $17 million and '''T-Netix'''. * January 2004 &mdash; '''LocusDialog''', of [[Montreal, Quebec]] * May 2004 &mdash; '''Telelogue, Inc.''', of [[Iselin, New Jersey]] - $5.4 million * November 2004 &mdash; '''ART Advanced Recognition Technologies, Ltd.''', of [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]] â€“ $21.5 million * November 2004 &mdash; '''Rhetorical Systems Ltd.''', of [[Scotland]] &mdash; $6.7 million * May. 2005 &mdash; '''MedRemote Inc.''', of [[Westmont]], [[Illinois]] &mdash; $6.2 million * February 1, 2005 &mdash; '''Phonetic Systems, Ltd.''', of [[Burlington, Massachusetts]] and [[Israel]] &mdash; $35 million ====ScanSoft merges with Nuance; changes company-wide name to "Nuance Communications, Inc."==== * September 15, 2005 &mdash; ScanSoft acquired and merged with Nuance Communications, of Menlo Park, California &mdash; $221 million. * October 18, 2005, the company changed the name to "Nuance Communications, Inc." <ref name="nuance.com"/> ====Nuance acquisitions after merger==== * March 31, 2006 &mdash; '''[[Dictaphone|Dictaphone Corporation]]''', of [[Stratford, Connecticut]] &mdash; $357 million. * December 29, 2006 &mdash; '''Mobile Voice Control, Inc.''' of [[Mason, Ohio]]. * March 2007 &mdash; '''Focus Infomatics, Inc.'''
