AdRem NetCrunch Remote Administration Console runs on [[Windows_7|Windows 7]]/[[Windows_vista|Vista]] SP2/[[Windows_XP|XP SP3]] or [[Windows_Server_2003|Windows Server 2003]]/[[Windows_Server_2008|2008]] (x32/x64). ==Editions== There are two editions: Premium and Premium XE. The Premium XE edition is designed for large networks and intended to run on a dedicated [[Windows 2008]] server. Common Premium XE Usage Scenarios include: * Network with more than a 1000 nodes for availability monitoring * Network with more than a 1000 network services for availability monitoring * Network with more than a 100 servers and routers for performance monitoring * Network with sub networks * Network with external servers connected over WAN Links * Network with CISCO or Nortel switches * MS SQL, Exchange application performance monitoring and trending ==Language versions== There are several language versions of AdRem NetCrunch: english, japanese, polish, german. French, spanish and italian are being prepared. == Technology overview == '''Client-Server Architecture''' - user manages NetCrunch server using Remote Administration Consoles. '''Multithreading''' - NetCrunch Premium XE uses multithreading to take advantage of multi-core x64 machines’ performance characteristics. '''Prioritized monitoring''' - the program automatically sets up node monitoring order and time upon monitoring dependencies hierarchy. '''Event Suppression''' - in case of failure of an intermediate node, the program suppresses alerts from nodes located beyond that node. '''SQL event database (up to 128GB)''' '''Web Access''' - by implementing AJAX technology the server/browser interactions run asynchronously without reloading the GUI Web Access page == Independent Reviews == [http://blog.buerstinghaus.net/netzwerkuberwachung-mit-netcrunch-6/ Bjoerns Windows Blog, December 2010, "Netzwerküberwachung mit NetCrunch 6"] [http://www.lanline.de/articles/netzwerkberwachung_fr_viele_plattformen_:/2010011/s30.html?thes=&&page=1 LanLine Magazine, November 2010, Werner Degenhardt, "Netzwerküberwachung für viele Plattformen"] [http://www.networld.pl/artykuly/355751_4/Spokojnie.to.tylko.awaria.html Networld Magazine, Michał Witkowski, February 2010.

In 2002 NetLibrary was acquired by [[Online Computer Library Center]], who sold it to EBSCO Industries in 2010. NetLibrary provides audiobooks ([[Windows Media DRM|DRM protected]] [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]], [[MP3]]) and ebooks (viewable online or as [[Adobe Digital Editions|DRM protected PDF]]) through their website primarily to libraries. Libraries control which content is available in their portal by purchasing content from NetLibrary. NetLibrary offers a variety of value adding services to publishers, focusing mainly on bringing content into compliance with copyright and getting it ready for distribution<ref>{{Cite web|title=Custom Conversion Services|format=PDF|author=|url=http://extranet.netlibrary.com/extranet/publisher/specifications/documents/Custom_Conversion_Services.pdf}}</ref>. NetLibrary, while a provider of library-like services, is better classed with institution database providers because of how their service is set up. Like the institution database providers the user must login before they have access to the content and like the database providers it is accessed through a single website (NetLibrary.com). However because of the type of content it offers, namely ebooks and audio books, NetLibrary falls in the same niche as [[OverDrive, Inc.|OverDrive’s]] [[Digital Library Reserve]]. == References == <references /> ==External links== *[http://extranet.netlibrary.com/extranet/publisher/specifications/ NetLibrary Publisher Documentation] {{DEFAULTSORT:Netlibrary}} [[Category:Commercial digital libraries]] [[Category:Online databases]] [[Category:Software companies of the United States]]</text> </page> <page> <id>26095</id> <title>NetLogo</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=August 2009}} {{Infobox programming language | name = NetLogo | logo = [[File:Netlogo.png]] | paradigm = [[Multi-paradigm programming language|multi-paradigm]]: [[Educational programming language|educational]], [[Procedural programming|procedural]], [[Computer simulation#Types|agent-based]], [[Simulation language|simulation]] | year = 1999 | designer = [[Uri Wilensky]] | developer = [[Northwestern University]] Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling | latest_release_version = 4.1.2 | latest_release_date = {{release date|2010|12|06}} | typing = | implementations = | dialects = | influenced_by = [[StarLogo]], [[Logo (programming language)|Logo]] | influenced = | operating_system = [[Cross-platform]] ([[Java Virtual Machine|JVM]]) | license = [[Freeware]] | website = [http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/ ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo] | file_ext = nlogo }} '''NetLogo''' is a [[Multi-agent system|multi-agent]] [[programming language]] and [[Integrated development environment|integrated modeling environment]]. ==About== NetLogo was designed in the spirit of the [[Logo (programming language)|Logo programming language]] to be "low threshold and no ceiling," that is to enable easy entry by novices and yet meet the needs of high powered users. The NetLogo environment enables exploration of [[emergent phenomena]]. It comes with an extensive models library including models in a variety of domains such as [[economics]], [[biology]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[psychology]], [[system dynamics]] and many other natural and social [[sciences]]. Beyond exploration, NetLogo enables the quick and easy authoring of models. It is particularly well suited for modeling complex systems developing over time. Modelers can give instructions to hundreds or thousands of independent "[[Intelligent agent|agents]]" all operating concurrently. This makes it possible to explore the connection between the micro-level behavior of individuals and the macro-level patterns that emerge from the interaction of many individuals. NetLogo has many thousands of active users. It is freely available from [http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml the NetLogo website]. NetLogo is in use in a wide variety of educational contexts from elementary school to graduate school. Many teachers
