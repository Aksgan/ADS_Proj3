[[Unisys]] [[Burroughs large systems|MCP]]-based mainframes, are among the few mainframe architectures still extant that can trace their roots to this early period. That said, while they can still run 24-bit System/360 code, the 64-bit zSeries and System z9 CMOS servers have nothing physically in common with the older systems. Notable manufacturers outside the USA were [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] and [[Telefunken]] in [[Germany]], [[International Computers Limited|ICL]] in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Olivetti]] in Italy, and [[Fujitsu]], [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]], [[Oki Electric Industry|Oki]], and [[NEC]] in [[Japan]]. The [[Soviet Union]] and [[Warsaw Pact]] countries manufactured close copies of IBM mainframes during the [[Cold War]]; the [[BESM]] series and [[Strela computer|Strela]] are examples of an independently designed Soviet computer. Shrinking demand and tough competition started a [[shakeout]] in the market in the early 1970s — RCA sold out to UNIVAC and GE also left; in the 1980s Honeywell was bought out by [[Bull (company)|Bull]]; UNIVAC became a division of [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry]], which later merged with Burroughs to form [[Unisys]] Corporation in 1986. In 1991, [[AT&T]] briefly owned NCR. During the same period, companies found that servers based on microcomputer designs could be deployed at a fraction of the acquisition price and offer local users much greater control over their own systems given the IT policies and practices at that time. Terminals used for interacting with mainframe systems were gradually replaced by [[personal computer]]s. Consequently, demand plummeted and new mainframe installations were restricted mainly to financial services and government. In the early 1990s, there was a rough consensus among industry analysts that the mainframe was a dying market as mainframe platforms were increasingly replaced by personal computer networks. Infoworld's Stewart Alsop famously predicted that the last mainframe would be unplugged in 1996. That trend started to turn around in the late 1990s as corporations found new uses for their existing mainframes and as the price of data networking collapsed in most parts of the world, encouraging trends toward more centralized computing. The growth of [[e-business]] also dramatically increased the number of back-end transactions processed by mainframe software as well as the size and throughput of databases. Batch processing, such as billing, became even more important (and larger) with the growth of e-business, and mainframes are particularly adept at large scale batch computing. Another factor currently increasing mainframe use is the development of the [[Linux on System z|Linux]] operating system, which arrived on IBM mainframe systems in 1999 and is typically run in scores or hundreds virtual machines on a single mainframe. Linux allows users to take advantage of [[open source]] software combined with mainframe hardware [[Reliability, Availability and Serviceability|RAS]]. Rapid expansion and development in [[emerging markets]], particularly [[People's Republic of China]], is also spurring major mainframe investments to solve exceptionally difficult computing problems, e.g. providing unified, extremely high volume online transaction processing databases for 1 billion consumers across multiple industries (banking, insurance, credit reporting, government services, etc.) In late 2000 IBM introduced 64-bit z/Architecture, acquired numerous software companies such as [[Cognos]] and introduced those software products to the mainframe. IBM's quarterly and annual reports in the 2000s usually reported increasing mainframe revenues and capacity shipments. However, IBM's mainframe hardware business has not been immune to the recent overall downturn in the server hardware market or to model cycle effects. For example, in the 4th quarter of 2009, IBM's System z hardware revenues decreased by 27% year over year. But MIPS shipments (a measure of mainframe capacity) increased 4% per year over the past two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/investor/4q09/presentation/4q09prepared.pdf|title=IBM 4Q2009 Financial Report: CFO's Prepared Remarks|publisher=[[IBM]]|date=January 19, 2010}}</ref> ==Differences from supercomputers== A [[supercomputer]] is a computer that is at the frontline of current processing capacity, particularly speed of calculation. Supercomputers are used for scientific and engineering problems ([[high-performance computing]]) which are limited by processing speed and memory size, while mainframes are used for problems which are limited by data movement in input/output devices, reliability, and for handling multiple business transactions concurrently. The differences are as follows: *Mainframes are measured in millions of instructions per second ([[instructions per second|MIPS]]) while assuming typical instructions are integer operations, but supercomputers are measured in [[floating point]] operations per second ([[FLOPS]]). Examples of integer operations include moving data around in memory or checking values. Floating point operations are mostly addition, subtraction, and multiplication with enough digits of precision to model continuous phenomena such as weather prediction and nuclear simulations. In terms of computational ability, supercomputers are more powerful.<ref>[http://www.top500.org/ World's Top Supercomputer] Retrieved on December 25, 2009</ref> *Mainframes are built to be reliable for transaction processing as it is commonly understood in the business world: a commercial exchange of goods, services, or money. A typical transaction, as defined by the [[Transaction Processing Performance Council]],<ref>[http://www.tpc.org/information/about/abouttpc.asp Transaction Processing Performance Council] Retrieved on December 25, 2009.</ref> would include the updating to a database system for such things as inventory control (goods), airline reservations (services), or banking (money). A transaction could refer to a set of operations including disk read/writes, operating system calls, or some form of data transfer from one subsystem to another. This operation does not count toward the processing power of a computer. Transaction processing is not exclusive to mainframes but also used in the performance of microprocessor-based servers and online networks. == See also == * [[Computer types]] == References == {{Reflist|2}} == External links == {{Commons category|Mainframe computers}} * [http://ibm.com/zseries IBM eServer zSeries mainframe servers] * [http://www.technikum29.de/en/computer/univac9400 Univac 9400], a mainframe from the 1960s, still in use in a German computer museum * [http://www.computinghistorymuseum.org/teaching/lectures/pptlectures/9-MainframeComputers.ppt Lectures in the History of Computing: Mainframes] {{Computer sizes}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Mainframe Computer}} [[Category:Mainframe computers| ]] [[ar:حاسوب كبير]] [[az:Meynfreym]] [[bg:Мейнфрейм компютър]] [[ca:Ordinador central]] [[cs:Mainframe]] [[da:Mainframe]] [[de:Großrechner]] [[el:Κεντρικός υπολογιστής]] [[es:Computadora central]] [[eu:Konputagailu nagusi]] [[fa:رایانه بزرگ]] [[fr:Ordinateur central]] [[ko:메인프레임]] [[id:Mainframe (komputer)]] [[it:Mainframe]] [[he:מחשב מרכזי]] [[lo:ເມນເຟຣມ]] [[lv:Lieldators]] [[lt:Universalieji kompiuteriai]] [[hu:Nagygép]] [[ml:മെയിൻഫ്രെയിം കമ്പ്യൂട്ടർ]] [[nl:Mainframe]] [[ja:メインフレーム]] [[no:Stormaskin]] [[pl:Mainframe]] [[pt:Mainframe]] [[ro:Mainframe]] [[ru:Мейнфрейм]] [[simple:Mainframe]] [[sl:Osrednji računalnik]] [[fi:Suurtietokone]] [[sv:Stordator]] [[th:เมนเฟรมคอมพิวเตอร์]] [[uk:Мейнфрейм]] [[vi:Máy tính lớn]] [[yi:מיינפריים]] [[zh:大型计算机]]</text> </page> <page> <id>23309</id> <title>Maintenance, repair, and operations</title> <text>{{Cleanup|date=July 2009}} '''Maintenance, repair, and operations'''<ref>[http://www.dscp.dla.mil/gi/mro/]</ref> ('''MRO''') or '''Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul'''<ref>[http://www.lockheedmartin.com/news/press_releases/2008/0122ae_u2sanantonio.html]</ref> involves fixing any sort of [[machine|mechanical]] or
