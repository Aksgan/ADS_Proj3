based on human or individual perspective. Subjectivity is within itself the only truth despite assumptions about subjective "truths" we make. The creation of philosophies is within itself subjective, along with the concept of discovery or creation of ideas. This term contrasts with [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]], which is used to describe humans as "seeing" the universe exactly for what it is from a standpoint free from human perception and its influences, human cultural interventions, past experience and expectation of the result. ==See also== {{Portal box|Philosophy|Thinking}} * [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]] * [[Subject (philosophy)]] * [[Phenomenology (psychology)]] * [[Q methodology]] * [[Soren Kierkegaard]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==Further reading== * [[Ned Block|Block, Ned]]; Flanagan, Owen J.; & Gzeldere, Gven (Eds.)

The SIM card allows users to change phones by simply removing the SIM card from one mobile phone and inserting it into another mobile phone or broadband telephony device. A SIM card contains its unique serial number, internationally unique number of the mobile user ([[IMSI]]), security authentication and ciphering information, temporary information related to the local network, a list of the services the user has access to and two passwords ([[Personal identification number|PIN]] for usual use and [[Personal Unblocking Code|PUK]] for unlocking). SIM cards are available in three standard sizes. The first is the size of a [[credit card]] (85.60 mm × 53.98 mm x 0.76 mm). The newer, most popular miniature version has the same thickness, but has a length of 25 mm and a width of 15 mm, and has one of its corners truncated (chamfered) to prevent misinsertion. The newest incarnation known as the 3FF or micro-SIM has dimensions of 15 mm × 12 mm. Most cards of the two smaller sizes are supplied as a full-sized card with the smaller card held in place by a few plastic links; it can easily be broken off to be used in a device that uses the smaller SIM. The first SIM card was made in 1991 by Munich smart card maker [[Giesecke & Devrient]], who sold the first 300 SIM cards to Finnish wireless network operator [[Radiolinja]].<ref name="test">[http://www.gi-de.com/portal/page?_pageid=44,62528&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL History of Giesecke & Devrient]</ref><!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:First Radiolinja SIM card.jpg|thumb|The First SIM Card made in 1991, Munich smart card maker Giesecke & Devrient sold the first 300 SIM cards to Finnish wireless network operator Elisa (ex. Radiolinja).]] --> == Smart card technology == [[File:SIM chip structure and packaging.svg|thumb|SIM chip structure and packaging]] There are three operating voltages for SIM cards: 5 V, 3 V and 1.8 V ([[ISO/IEC 7816]]-3 classes A, B and C respectively). The operating voltage of the majority of SIM cards launched before 1998 was 5 V. SIM cards produced subsequently are compatible with 3 V and 5 V or with 1.8 V and 3 V. A [[W-SIM]] is a SIM card that incorporates core cellular technology in the card itself. A ''virtual SIM'' is a mobile phone number provided by a [[mobile network operator]] that does not require a SIM card to terminate phone calls on a user's mobile phone. ===Features added in later releases=== The specification that standardized the micro-SIM form factor continues to evolve. Some features introduced recently include: * a micro-SIM form factor * allow for multiple simultaneous applications accessing the card through [[Virtual circuit|logical channels]]; * introduce mutual authentication as a way to eliminate carrier [[spoofing attack|spoofing]] by allowing the SIM card to authenticate the cell tower to which it is connecting; * add a new PIN protection with [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] PIN management with a [[superuser|universal PIN]], an application PIN and a local PIN; and * expand the phonebook storage of the SIM card with entries for email, second name, and groups.<ref name="ETSITechnicalCommittee"/> == Card sizes == [[Image:GSM Micro SIM Card vs. GSM Mini Sim Card.svg|right|thumb|Micro-SIM and mini-SIM, as normally supplied in full-sized carrier cards]] [[Image:Telia micro SIM with brackets.jpg|right|thumb|Micro-SIM with mini-SIM and full SIM brackets from Telia in Sweden]] [[Image:Disassembled SIM Card Film.JPG|right|thumb|The memory film from a micro SIM card without the plastic backing plate, next to a [[Dime (United States coin)|US dime]]]] SIM cards were first made the same size as a credit card (85.60 mm × 53.98 mm × 0.76 mm). The development of physically smaller mobile devices prompted the development of a smaller SIM card, the mini-SIM card. Mini-SIM cards have the same thickness as full-size cards, but their length and width are reduced to 25 mm × 15 mm. The mini-SIM card has the same contact arrangement as the full-size SIM card and they are normally supplied within a full-size card carrier, attached by a number of linking pieces. This arrangement (defined in [[ISO/IEC 7810]] as [[ID-1/000]]) allows for such a card to be used in a device requiring a full-size card, or to be used in a device requiring a mini-SIM card after cleanly breaking the scorings
