the early 90’s, they created a fighting game called [[Way of the Warrior]] which eventually led to a multi-title deal with Universal Interactive Studios.<ref>http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.02/eword.html?pg=7</ref> It was under the auspices of this Universal deal that they produced the multi-million selling [[Crash Bandicoot]] series from 1994 until 1999, and later segueing into the successful [[Jak and Daxter]] series of games. At the end of 2000, Rubin and Gavin sold [[Naughty Dog]] to [[Sony Computer Entertainment America]] (SCEA). All in all, they created 14 [[Naughty Dog]] games including Math Jam (1985), Ski Crazed (1986), [[Dream Zone]] (1987), Keef the Thief (1989), [[Rings of Power]] (1991), [[Way of the Warrior]] (1994), [[Crash Bandicoot]] (1996), Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back (1997), Crash Bandicoot: Warped (1998), Crash Team Racing (1999), [[Jak and Daxter]]: The Precursor Legacy (2001), Jak 2 (2003), Jak 3 (2004) and Jak X: Combat Racing (2005). Together these games have sold over 35 million units and generated over $1 billion in revenue.[http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/devs-dont-need-producers-naughty-dog] While at [[Naughty Dog]], Gavin developed two LISP dialects for use in game development, GOOL (Game Object Oriented Lisp) and its successor [[Game Oriented Assembly Lisp|GOAL]] (Game Oriented Assembly Lisp). These represented a departure from the mainstream in terms of language choice, and featured some innovations in design.<ref>http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2985/postmortem_naughty_dogs_jak_and_.php?page=2</ref> <gallery> Image:ndwrapscott.jpg|Naughty Dog Wrap Party, Santa Monica, CA Image:Osirisnd.JPG|One of the Naughty Dogs at work, Santa Monica, CA <!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: Image:ndpawlogo.jpg|Naughty Dog Paw Logo at the ND Offices --> Image:Ndmoving.jpg|Naughty Dog Offices, circa 2003 </gallery> Shortly after leaving Naughty Dog, Gavin co-founded a new Internet startup called [[Flektor]] with his former business partner, [[Jason Rubin]], and former HBO executive Jason R. Kay. In May 2007, the company was sold to [[Fox Interactive Media]], which is a division of [[News Corp.]]<ref>http://machinist.salon.com/blog/2007/06/26/flektor/index.html</ref> Fox has described the company as: “a next-generation Web site that provides users with a suite of Web-based tools to transform their photos and videos into dynamic slideshows, postcards, live interactive presentations and video mash-ups.” In October 2007, [[Flektor]] partnered with its sister company, [[MySpace]], and [[MTV]] to provide instant audience feedback via polls for the interactive MySpace / MTV Presidential Dialogues series with then-presidential candidate Senator [[Barack Obama]].<ref>http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1572991/20071029/index.jhtml</ref> Gavin left Fox Interactive Media in 2008. He recently announced a return to the video game business with his [[Naughty Dog]] co-founder [[Jason Rubin]]. They have formed a new social game startup called [[Monkey Gods]] that is working on a new version of [[Snood (video game)|Snood]] along with a casual word game called MonkWerks [http://www.monkwerks.com].<ref>http://venturebeat.com/2009/05/14/crash-bandicoot-creators-speak-out-on-forming-new-game-company/</ref> == References == <references/> == Gameography == {|class="wikitable" !Game Title !!Release!!

After buying an Apple II in January 1978, he went to work for [[Apple Computer]] from August 1979 until March 1984, where he was a key designer of the [[Macintosh]] system software. Since leaving Apple, he has co-founded three companies: [[Radius (computer)|Radius]] in 1986, [[General Magic]] in 1990 and [[Eazel]] in 1999. In 2002, he helped [[Mitch Kapor]] promote [[open source]] [[software]] with the [[Open Source Applications Foundation]]. Hertzfeld joined [[Google]] in 2005 and has been working there since. ==Career== ===Apple Computer (1979–1984)=== [[Image:Mac Design Team.jpg|thumb|Part of the original Macintosh design team, as seen on the cover of ''Revolution in the Valley''.<br />Left to right: [[George Crow]], [[Joanna Hoffman]], [[Burrell Smith]], Andy Hertzfeld, [[Bill Atkinson]], [[Jerry Manock]].]] After graduating from [[Brown University]] with a [[Computer science|Computer Science]] degree in 1975, Hertzfeld attended [[graduate school]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. In 1978, he bought an [[Apple II]] computer and soon began developing software for it. He was hired by Apple Computer as a systems programmer in 1979 and developed the [[Apple SilenType]] printer [[firmware]] and the first 80-column card for the Apple II. In the early 1980s, he invited his high school friend, artist [[Susan Kare]], to join Apple in order to help design what would become standard Macintosh icons. Hertzfeld's business card at Apple listed his title as ''Software Wizard''. He wrote large portions of the Macintosh's original system software including much of the burned-in [[Read-only memory|ROM]] code, the User Interface Toolbox, and a number of innovative components now standard in many graphic user interfaces, like the [[Control panel (Mac OS)|Control Panel]] and [[Scrapbook (Mac OS)|Scrapbook]]. After a shakeup in the Apple II team and at Hertzfeld's request,
