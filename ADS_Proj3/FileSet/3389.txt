Being a [[high-level language]], it is fairly [[cross-platform]]. Since 1977, the language has been going under several standardization steps by the [[Deutsches Institut für Normung]]. The current version is PEARL-90, which was standardized in 1998 as DIN 66253-2. ==Features== PEARL supports both [[Fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] and [[floating-point]] numeric values, character and character [[String (computer science)|string]] data as well as bit values. It also provides facilities for structures and multi-dimensional [[Array data structure|arrays]]. Both typed and untyped pointers are also supported, along with typecasting. The Realtime- and Multitasking-Programming Language PEARL The name PEARL stands for '''P'''rocess and '''E'''xperiment '''A'''utomation '''R'''ealtime '''L'''anguage and must '''not be mistaken''' for [[Perl]]. PEARL is a higher programming language, which allows a comfortable, secure and almost processor independent programming of multitasking- and realtime problems and has been standardized since 1977 at various stages of its development, the last time 1998 as PEARL-90 (DIN 66253-2 1998, Berlin, Beuth-Verlag, 1998). Besides the simple possibility to map process technical problems, an important principle at the development of PEARL was the easy learning by the programmer. Everyone who already knows a procedural programming language will get acquainted with PEARL in a very short time. All basic data types and language structures of other procedural programming languages exist in PEARL. In addition PEARL offers comfortable language elements for the handling of multitasking- and realtime tasks. As most high-level languages, PEARL supports [[procedure]]s and functions, and passing parameters to these can be done by value or by reference (via [[Pointer (computing)|pointers]]). ==External links== *[http://www.irt.uni-hannover.de/pearl/index_en.html Process and Experiment Automation Realtime Language] *[http://www.irt.uni-hannover.de/pub/pearl/report.pdf PEARL 90 - Language Report] (PDF) {{Compu-lang-stub}} [[Category:Procedural programming languages]] [[Category:Statically typed programming languages]] [[Category:Real-time computing]] [[de:PEARL]] [[te:పెర్ల్ (కంప్యూటర్ భాష)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>28066</id> <title>PERMIS</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=April 2008}} '''PERMIS''' (PrivilEge and Role Management Infrastructure Standards) is a sophisticated policy-based [[authorisation]] system that implements an enhanced version of the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology ([[NIST]]) standard Role-Based Access Control ([[RBAC]]) model.
