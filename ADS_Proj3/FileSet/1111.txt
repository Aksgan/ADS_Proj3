way they were surveyed, and the careful choice of materials needed. His book would have been of assistance to [[Frontinus]], a general who was appointed in the late first century AD to administer the many [[aqueducts of Rome]]. He discovered a discrepancy between the intake and supply of water caused by illegal pipes inserted into the channels to divert the water. They went far in exploiting water power, as the set of no less than 16 [[water mill]]s at [[Barbegal]] in [[France]] demonstrates. The mills ground grain in a very efficient operation, and many other mills are now known. ===Materials=== Vitruvius describes many different construction materials used for a wide variety of different structures, as well as such details as [[stucco]] painting. [[Cement]], [[concrete]] and [[lime (material)|lime]] receive in-depth descriptions, the longevity of many Roman structures being mute testimony to their skill in building materials and design. It is worth noting that Vitruvius advises that [[lead]] should not be used to conduct drinking water, clay pipes being preferred. He comes to this conclusion in Book VIII of De Architectura after empirical observation of the apparent labourer illnesses in the [[plumbum]] foundries of his time. In 1986 the United States banned the use of lead in plumbing due to lead poisoning's neurological damage. However, much of the water used by Rome and many other cities was very hard, and coated the inner surfaces of the pipes, so [[lead poisoning]] was most unlikely. [[Image:VitruviusTenBooksMHMorgan1914p295.gif|thumb|right|200px|Design for an Archimedean water-screw]] Vitruvius gives us the famous story about [[Archimedes]] and his detection of adulterated gold in a royal crown. When Archimedes realised that the volume of the crown could be measured exactly by the displacement created in a bath of water, he ran into the street with the cry of "[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]!", and the discovery enabled him to compare the density of the crown with pure [[gold]]. He showed that the crown had been alloyed with [[silver]], and the king defrauded. We are not told what happened to the metal worker who crafted the crown, but no doubt he suffered a painful fate. ===Dewatering machines=== [[Image:Archscrew2.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Drainage wheel from Rio Tinto mines]] [[Image:WaterwheelsSp.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Sequence of drainage wheels found in Spanish mine]] He describes the construction of [[Archimedes' screw]] in Chapter X, although doesn't mention Archimedes by name. It was a device widely used for raising water to irrigate fields and dewater mines. Other lifting machines he mentions include the endless chain of buckets and the [[reverse overshot water-wheel]]. Remains of the water wheels used for lifting water have been discovered in old mines such as those at [[Rio Tinto (river)|Rio Tinto]] in [[Spain]] and [[Dolaucothi]] in west [[Wales]]. One of the wheels from Rio Tinto is now in the [[British Museum]], and the latter in the [[National Museum of Wales]]. The remains were discovered when these mines were re-opened in modern mining attempts. They would have been used in a vertical sequence, with 16 such mills capable of raising water at least 96 feet above the water table. Each wheel would have been worked by a miner treading the device at the top of the wheel, by using cleats on the outer edge. That they were using such devices in mines clearly implies that they were entirely capable of using them as [[water wheels]] to develop power for a range of activities, not just for grinding wheat, but also probably for sawing timber, crushing ores, [[fulling]] and so on. ===Force pump=== [[Image:heron2.jpg|thumb|left|200px||Hero's fire-engine]] [[Ctesibius]] is credited with the invention of the [[force pump]] which Vitruvius describes as being built from [[bronze]] with valves to allow a head of water to be formed above the machine. The device is also described by [[Hero of Alexandria]] in his "Pneumatica". The machine is operated by hand in moving a lever up and down. He mentions its use for supplying fountains above a reservoir, although a more mundane use might be as a simple fire-engine. One was found at [[Roman Silchester]] or [[Calleva Atrebatum]] in [[England]], and another is on display at the [[British Museum]]. Their functions are not described but they are both made in bronze, just as Vitruvius specifies. Vitruvius also mentions the several [[automaton]]s that [[Ctesibius]] invented, and intended for amusement and pleasure rather than serving a useful function. ===Central heating=== [[Image:Hypocaustum.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Ruins of the hypocaust under the floor of a Roman villa. The part under the [[exedra]] is covered.]] He describes the many innovations made in building design to improve the living conditions of the inhabitants. Foremost among them is the development of the [[hypocaust]], a type of [[central heating]] where hot air developed by a fire was channelled under the floor and inside the walls of [[public bath]]s and [[villa]]s. He gives explicit instructions how to design such buildings so that [[fuel efficiency]] is maximised, so that for example, the [[caldarium]] is next to the [[tepidarium]] followed by the [[frigidarium]]. He also advises on using a type of regulator to control the heat in the hot rooms, a [[bronze]] disc set into the roof under a circular aperture which could be raised or lowered by a [[pulley]] to adjust the ventilation. Although he does not suggest it himself, it is likely that his dewatering devices such as the [[reverse overshot water-wheel]] was used in the larger baths to lift water to header tanks at the top of the larger ''thermae'', such as the [[Baths of Diocletian]] and the [[Baths of Caracalla]]. ===Surveying instruments=== That he must have been well practised in surveying is shown by his descriptions of surveying instruments, especially the water level or [[chorobates]], which he compares favourably with the [[groma]], a device using [[plumb line]]s. They were essential in all building operations, but especially in aqueduct construction, where a uniform gradient was important to provision of a regular supply of water without damage to the walls of the channel. He describes the [[Surveyor's wheel|hodometer]], essentially a device for automatically measuring distances along roads, a machine essential for developing accurate itineraries, such as the [[Peutinger
