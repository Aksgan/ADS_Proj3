Work == The original non-localized Creative Commons licenses were written with the US legal system in mind, hence the wording of the licenses could be incompatible within different local legislations and render the licenses unenforceable in various [[jurisdictions]]. To address this issue, Creative Commons International has started to port the various licenses to accommodate local copyright and private law. As of September 2010, there are 53 jurisdiction-specific licenses, with 10 other jurisdictions in the drafting process and more countries joining the worldwide project.<ref>[http://creativecommons.org/worldwide Creative Commons International]</ref> == Porting process == The porting process involves both linguistically translating the licenses and legally adapting them to particular jurisdictions. == Country teams == Country teams introduce Creative Commons to their country and facilitate extensive consultations and discussion with members of the public and key stakeholders in an effort to adapt the licenses to local circumstances, i.e. their jurisdiction. Country teams usually have a Project Lead and may have their own website in addition to their listing on the main Creative Commons website. Country teams may be supported by organisations, for example, CCi Ireland is a collaboration between Creative Commons and [[University College Cork]].<ref>[http://creativecommons.org/international/ie/ Ireland - Creative Commons]</ref> == Jurisdictions covered == Creative Commons has developed licenses for the following jurisdictions: <div style="column-count:4;-moz-column-count:4;-webkit-column-count:4"> *[[Argentina]] *[[Australia]] *[[Austria]] *[[Belgium]] *[[Brazil]] *[[Bulgaria]] *[[Canada]] *[[Chile]] *[[People's Republic of China|China]] *[[Colombia]] *[[Croatia]] *[[Czech Republic]] *[[Denmark]] *[[Ecuador]] *[[England and Wales]] *[[Finland]] *[[France]] *[[Germany]] *[[Greece]] *[[Guatemala]] *[[Hong Kong]] *[[Hungary]] *[[India]] *[[Israel]] *[[Italy]] *[[Japan]] *[[Luxembourg]] *[[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] *[[Malaysia]] *[[Malta]] *[[Mexico]] *[[Netherlands]] *[[New Zealand]] *[[Norway]] *[[Peru]] *[[Philippines]] *[[Poland]] *[[Portugal]] *[[Puerto Rico]] *[[Romania]] *[[Scotland]] *[[Serbia]] *[[Singapore]] *[[Slovenia]] *[[South Africa]] *[[South Korea]] *[[Spain]] *[[Sweden]] *[[Switzerland]] *[[Republic of China|Taiwan]] *[[Thailand]] *[[United States]] *[[Vietnam]] </div> == Countries where licenses are in development == Creative Commons has started the process of developing licenses in the following jurisdictions: *[[Armenia]] *[[Azerbaijan]] *[[Costa Rica]] *[[Egypt]] *[[Estonia]] *[[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] *[[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] *[[Jordan]] *[[Nigeria]] *[[Ukraine]] == Countries where license development is planned == Creative Commons plans to start developing licenses for the following jurisdictions: *[[Bangladesh]] *[[Iceland]] *[[Indonesia]] *[[Slovakia]] *[[Syria]] *[[Tanzania]] *[[Turkey]] *[[Venezuela]] == See also == *[[Creative Commons]] *[[Creative Commons Licenses]] == References == {{Reflist}} == External links == *[http://creativecommons.org/international/ Creative Commons International] *[http://creativecommons.ca/ Canadian Creative Commons site] *[http://creativecommons.org.au/ Australian Creative Commons site] {{Creative Commons topic}} [[Category:Creative Commons]] [[Category:Computer law]] [[Category:Copyright licenses]]</text> </page> <page> <id>8403</id> <title>Creative Commons licenses</title> <text>[[File:Creative Commons and Commerce.ogg|thumb|350px|This video explains how Creative Commons licenses can be used in conjunction with commercial licensing arrangements.]] [[Image:Cc.logo.circle.svg|right]] '''Creative Commons licenses''' are several [[copyright]] licenses that allow the distribution of copyrighted works. The licenses differ by several combinations that condition the terms of distribution. They were initially released on December 16, 2002 by [[Creative Commons]], a [[United States|U.S.]] [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] corporation founded in 2001. As of September, 2010, Creative Commons licenses have been "[[Creative Commons jurisdiction ports|ported]]" to 53 different jurisdictions worldwide, with 8 others under development.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://creativecommons.org/international/ |title=International |publisher=[[Creative Commons]] |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref> == Original licenses == The original set of licenses all grant the "baseline rights", such as the right to distribute the copyrighted work worldwide, without changes, at no charge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Baseline_Rights |title=Baseline Rights |publisher=[[Creative Commons]] |date=June 12, 2008 |accessdate=February 22, 2010}}</ref> The details of each of these licenses depends on the version, and comprises a selection of four conditions: {| style = "border-spacing:1em 1em;" |- | valign="top" | [[Image:Cc-by new.svg|40px|Attribution]] | valign="top" | '''Attribution''' (by) | valign="top" | Licensees may copy, distribute, display and perform the work and make derivative works based on it only if they give the author or licensor the credits in the manner specified by these. |- | valign="top" | [[Image:Cc-nc.svg|40px|Non-commercial]] | valign="top" | '''Noncommercial''' (nc) | valign="top" | Licensees may copy, distribute, display, and perform the work and make derivative works based on it only for [[non-commercial|noncommercial]] purposes. |- | valign="top" | [[Image:Cc-nd.svg|40px|Non-derivative]] | valign="top" | '''No Derivative Works''' (nd) | valign="top" | Licensees may copy, distribute, display and perform only verbatim copies of the work, not [[derivative work]]s based on it. |- | valign="top" | [[Image:Cc-sa.svg|40px|Share-alike]] | valign="top" | '''[[Share-alike]]''' (sa) | valign="top" | Licensees may distribute derivative works only under a license identical to the license that governs the original work. (See also [[copyleft]].) |} ===Combinations=== Mixing and matching these conditions produces sixteen possible combinations, of which eleven are valid Creative Commons licenses and five are not. Of the five invalid combinations, four include both the "nd" and "sa" clauses, which are mutually exclusive; and one includes none of the clauses. Of the eleven valid combinations, the five that lack the "by" clause have been retired because 98% of licensors requested Attribution, though they do remain available for reference on the website.<ref name="retiredlicenses">{{cite web |url=http://creativecommons.org/retiredlicenses |title=Retired Licenses |accessdate=July 5, 2007 |publisher=[[Creative Commons]]}}</ref><ref name="v2announcement">[http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4216 Announcing (and explaining) our new 2.0 licenses]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/ |title=Creative Commons Licenses |publisher=[[Creative Commons]] |accessdate=February 22, 2010}}</ref> This leaves six regularly used licenses: # Attribution alone (by) # Attribution + Noncommercial (by-nc) # Attribution + NoDerivatives (by-nd) # Attribution + ShareAlike (by-sa) # Attribution + Noncommercial + NoDerivatives (by-nc-nd) # Attribution + Noncommercial + ShareAlike (by-nc-sa) For example, the Creative Commons Attribution (BY) license allows one to share and remix (create derivative works), even for commercial use, so long as attribution is given.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/ |title=Creative Commons â€” Attribution 3.0 United States |date=November 16, 2009 |publisher=[[Creative Commons]] |accessdate=February 22, 2010}}</ref> == Attribution == Since 2004,<ref name="v2announcement"/>, all current licenses require attribution of the original author.
