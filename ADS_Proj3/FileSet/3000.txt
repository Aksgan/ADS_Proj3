dualism also leads to the problematic position of positing God as a particular being the existence of which can be argued for or against, failing to recognize God as the ground and origin of being itself, as in Acts 17, or in the [[Hashem]], YHWH, meaning "He causes to come into being." Such a view was called by Tillich pan''en''theism: God is in all things, neither identical to, nor totally separate from, all things. This understanding would be further supported by that understanding of the proclamation of the [[kingdom of God]], in which it is proclaimed "on earth as it is in heaven." ([[Gospel of Matthew]] 6:10) Such an understanding of the kingdom implies a new reality in which old dichotomies between, for example, the sacred and the profane, the temporal and the eternal, body and soul, absolutism and relativism, are overcome.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} All things are filled with God's Spirit ([[Epistle to the Romans]] 8:11), so that in this new creation God is "all in all" ([[I Corinthians]] 15.28; [[Ephesians]] 1.23). ====Eastern and Western differences over Monism==== [[Monism]] is a form of an [[epistemological idealism]].<ref>The Dictionary of Philosophy By Dagobert D.

Therefore in some forms of Hellenic philosophical idealism, God is in the mind, of the mind ([[intrinsic]]) and not a real objective being. This is called a form of subjective or modal interpretation of God like the modal formations contained in Aristotle's [[De Interpretatione]]. Aristotle opposed monism <ref>The philosopher who holds that there is a highest genus with many species would be a monist about the number of highest categories (genus monism) but a pluralist about the number of categories. Aristotle, in contrast, is a pluralist about both the number of categories and the number of highest categories, since he denies the existence of a unique highest type.[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/monism/]</ref> and idealism with his own concept of reducing everything to a single concept (called [[metaphysics]]). The process of uniting (unity) all to a single 'thing' ([[Henotheism|hen]]) as a form of salvation is called [[henosis]]. Henosis teaches that man is God (in that mankind has the concept of God intrinsic to consciousness and God can be grasp by thought or rational contemplation).<ref>pg 52 The [[Mystery religions]]: A Study in the Religious Background of Early Christianity By [[Samuel Angus]] Published by Courier Dover Publications, 1975 ISBN 978-0-486-23124-2 [http://books.google.com/books?id=3m61I6Q-dRUC&pg=PA300&lpg=PA300&dq=Theo+Smyrnaeus&source=web&ots=ml_CULK2si&sig=iDH41z1tQBg7lGxTEQplcPVwwHo&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=4&ct=result#PPA52,M1]</ref> Neoplatonic pagan philosophy teaches [[Henology]] (via [[Plotinus]]) that the first hypostasis or the monad by which all things can reduce their essence, substance or being to is called [[dunamis]] (potentia in Latin) or force which emanated the second hypostasis an [[energeia|energy]] (actus) or [[demiurge]] (mind or nous as the creator) then the creator hypostasis emanated the soul or spirit. This reverses Aristotle's mode from Energy (act or action) first and Dunamis, force or motion second, making his [[Unmoved Mover]] energy or (actus in Latin) static and the second reality potential or motion.<ref>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Aristotle's metaphysics- Aristotle gives priority to Actuality over Potentiality [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-metaphysics/#ActPot]</ref> Each teaching a sequential modalistic manifestation of the material world via a philosophical "concept" called God (theos). Supernatural in the East is that which is uncreated. Energies are uncreated and therefore it is critical to make a distinction between God and his Energies unlike in Pagan Philosophy. Since in Pagan Philosophy "energies" are Gods ([[Aphrodite|Love]], [[Athena|Wisdom]], [[Hermes|Intuitivism]] and [[Mnemosyne|Memory]]). Gregory Palamas in his defense of Hesychasm accused Barlaam of treating God conceptually this way putting pagan philosophers over the saints and prophets who through revelation and not logical thought came to know God. The knowledge of God by the Eastern Orthodox church is not arrived at by a form of rational theology but rather by illumination ([[theoria]]) as a stage of development in the process of theosis. Which again goes against the Roman Catholic theologians validation of theology using the Pagan philosopher [[Aristotle]]'s [[Metaphysics|Metaphysical]] and [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] arguments such as [[Actus et potentia|actus and potentia]]<ref name=echo>"There was a very faint echo of Hesychasm in the West. Latin theology on the whole was too deeply impregnated with the Aristotelean Scholastic system to tolerate a theory that opposed its very foundation. That all created beings are composed of ''actus'' and ''potentia'', that God alone is ''actus purus'', simple as He is infinite &ndash; this is the root of all Scholastic natural theology. Nevertheless one or two Latins seem to have had ideas similar to Hesychasm. Gilbertus Porretanus (de la Porrée, d. 1154) is quoted as having said that the Divine essence is not God &ndash; implying some kind of real distinction; John of Varennes, a hermit in the Diocese of Reims (c. 1396), said that the Apostles at the Transfiguration had seen the Divine essence as clearly as it is seen in heaven. About the same time John of Brescain made a proposition: ''Creatam lucem infinitam et immensam esse''. But these isolated opinions formed no school. We know of them chiefly through the indignant condemnations they at once provoked. St. Bernard wrote to refute Gilbert de la Porrée; the University of Paris and the legate Odo condemned John of Brescain's proposition. Hesychasm has never had a party among Catholics. In the Orthodox Church the controversy, waged furiously just at the time when the enemies of the empire were finally overturning it and unity among its last defenders was the most crying need, is a significant witness of the decay of a lost cause" ([http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Hesychasm Adrian Fortescue, "Hesychasm" in ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' 1910).]</ref> to rationalize God.<ref name="Romanides">{{Cite book|title=Franks, Romans, Feudalism, and Doctrine/Empirical Theology versus Speculative Theology |first=John S. |last=Romanides |url=http://www.romanity.org/htm/rom.03.en.franks_romans_feudalism_and_doctrine.02.htm |quote=A basic characteristic of the Frankish scholastic method, mislead by Augustinian Platonism and Thomistic Aristotelianism, had been its naive confidence in the objective existence of things rationally speculated about.
