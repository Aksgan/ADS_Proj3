However, the school is still included in the ''[[U.S. News & World Report|U.S News]]'' college ranking guide and ranks in the third tier. This may be due to school's decision not to send information to ''U.S. News''. President Christopher B. Nelson stated that, "in principle, St. John's is opposed to rankings." He notes that :Over the years, St. John's College has been ranked everywhere from third, second, and first tier, to one of the "Top 25" liberal arts colleges. Yet, the curious thing is: We haven't changed. Our mission and our methods have been virtually constant for almost 60 years. So when it comes to the U.S. News and World Report rankings, we would rather be ourselves and have our college speak for itself, than be subjected to fluctuating outside analysis.<ref>Christopher B.

The president of the [[University of Alberta]], [[Indira Samarasekera]], commented that, "[[Canada|Canadian]] universities are listening with great interest as the call to boycott ''U.S. News & World Report'' rankings continues to increase in volume among our colleagues to the south. Many of our American colleagues say that they would like to resist the rankings, but fear it can’t be done, especially if only a few institutions act. I write to let you know that institutions can take on the rankings. About a year ago, a growing number of Canadian institutions began to raise the same alarm, ultimately resulting in 25 of our 90+ institutions — including many of our leading universities — banding together to take just such a stand against the fall rankings issue of ''[[Maclean’s University Rankings#Maclean.27s Guide to Canadian Universities|Maclean's]]'', our Canadian equivalent [...] It’s time to question these third-party rankings that are actually marketing driven, designed to sell particular issues of a publication with repurposing of their content into even higher sales volume special editions with year-long shelf life." <ref>{{cite web | first = Indira | last =Samarasekera| title =Rising Up Against Rankings| publisher = [[Inside Higher Ed]] | date = 2 April 2007 | url= http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2007/04/02/samarasekera}}</ref> ==2007 movement== {{main|Criticism of college and university rankings (2007 United States)}} On 19 June 2007, during the annual meeting of the [[Annapolis Group]], members discussed [[Criticism_of_college_and_university_rankings_%282007_United_States%29#Presidents_Letter|the letter to college presidents]] asking them not to participate in the "reputation survey" section of the ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' survey (this section comprises 25% of the ranking).
