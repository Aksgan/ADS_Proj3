that Carnap encountered shows that reductionism is, at best, unproven and very difficult to prove. Until a reductionist can produce an acceptable proof, Quine maintains that reductionism is another "metaphysical article of faith". ==Quine's holism== Instead of reductionism, Quine proposes that it is the whole field of science and not single statements that are verified. All scientific statements are interconnected. Logical laws give the relation between different statements, while they also are statements of the system. This makes talk about the empirical content of a single statement misleading. It also becomes impossible to draw a line between synthetic statements, which depend on experience, and analytic statements, that [[hold come what may]]. Any statement can be held as necessarily true according to Quine, if the right changes are made somewhere else in the system. In the same way, no statements are immune to revision. Even logical laws can be revised according to Quine. [[Quantum logic]], introduced by [[Garrett Birkhoff]] and [[John von Neumann]], abandons the [[law of distributivity]] from classical logic in order to reconcile some of the apparent inconsistencies of classical [[Boolean logic]] with the facts related to measurement and observation in quantum mechanics. Quine makes the case that the empirical study of physics has furnished apparently credible grounds for replacing classical logic by quantum logic, rather as [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]] gave way to [[General relativity|Einsteinian physics]]. The idea that logical laws are not immune to revision in the light of empirical evidence has provoked an intense debate (see [[Is logic empirical?]]). According to Quine, there are two different results of his reasoning. The first is a blurring of the line between [[metaphysics]] and natural science. The common-sense theory about physical objects is [[Epistemology|epistemologically]] comparable to the gods of [[Homer]]. Quine is a [[Physicalist]], in the sense that he considers it a scientific error not to adopt a theory which makes reference to physical objects. However, like Gods of Homer, physical objects are posits, and there is no great epistemic difference in kind; the difference is rather that the theory of physical objects has turned out to be a more efficient theory. As Quine states in Two Dogmas, "The myth of physical objects is epistemologically superior to most in that it has proved more efficacious than other myths as a device for working a manageable structure into the flux of experience". The second result is a move towards [[pragmatism]]. Since, Quine says, the function of science is to predict future experiences in the light of past ones, the only ground for choosing which explanations to believe is "the degree to which they expedite our dealings with sense experiences." While pragmatic concerns are important for [[Carnap]] and other logical positivists when choosing linguistic framework, their pragmatism "leaves off at the imagined boundary between the analytic and the synthetic". For Quine, every change in the system of science is, when [[rationality|rational]], pragmatic. ==Critique and influence== [[Paul Grice]] and [[P. F. Strawson]] criticized "Two Dogmas" in their (1956) article "In Defense of a Dogma". Among other things, they argue that Quine's [[skepticism]] about synonyms leads to a skepticism about meaning. If statements can have meanings, then it would make sense to ask "What does it mean?". If it makes sense to ask "What does it mean?", then synonymy can be defined as follows: Two sentences are synonymous if and only if the true answer of the question "What does it mean?" asked of one of them is the true answer to the same question asked of the other. They also draw the conclusion that discussion about correct or incorrect translations would be impossible given Quine's argument. Four years after Grice and Strawson published their paper, Quine's book ''[[Word and Object]]'' was released. In the book Quine presented his theory of [[indeterminacy of translation]]. In "'Two Dogmas' revisited", [[Hilary Putnam]] argues that Quine is attacking two different notions. Analytic truth defined as a true statement derivable from a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] by putting synonyms for synonyms are near [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] account of analytic truth as a truth whose negation is a contradiction. Analytic truth defined as a truth confirmed no matter what however, is closer to one of the traditional accounts of [[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]]. While the first four sections of Quine's paper concern analyticity, the last two concern a priority. Putnam considers the argument in the two last sections as independent of the first four, and at the same time as Putnam criticizes Quine, he also emphasizes his historical importance as the first top rank philosopher to both reject the notion of apriority and sketch a methodology without it.<ref>Putnam, Hilary, "'Two dogmas' revisited." In Gilbert Ryle, ''Contemporary Aspects of Philosophy.'' Stocksfield: Oriel Press, 1976, 202–213.</ref> In his book ''Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century, Volume 1 : The Dawn of Analysis'' [[Scott Soames]] (pp 360–361) has pointed out that Quine's circularity argument needs two of the logical positivists' central theses to be effective: :All necessary (and all ''a priori'') truths are analytic :Analyticity is needed to explain and legitimate necessity. It is only when these two theses are accepted that Quine's argument holds. It is not a problem that the notion of necessity is presupposed by the notion of analyticity if necessity can be explained without analyticity. According to Soames, both theses were accepted by most philosophers when Quine published ''Two Dogmas''. Today however, Soames holds both statements to be antiquated. ==See also== *[[Duhem–Quine thesis]] *[[American philosophy]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==Notes== * Quine, W.V.O.
