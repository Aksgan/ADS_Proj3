The first issue with this circuit is that negative values of currents need to be represented. Since all currents must be positive for the exponential relationship to hold (the log operation is not defined for negative numbers), positive currents must represent negative currents. The way this is done is by defining two positive currents whose difference is the current of interest. A two quadrant multiplier has the relationship <math>\,\! z=xy</math> hold while allowing <math>\,\! x</math> to be either positive or negative. We'll let <math>\,\! z=z^+-z^-</math> and <math>\,\! x=x^+-x^-</math>. Also note that <math>\,\! x=I_x/I_u</math> and <math>\,\! x^+=I_x^+/I_u</math> etc. Plugging these values into the original equation yields <math>\,\! \left(\frac{I_z^+}{I_u}-\frac{I_z^-}{I_u}\right)=\left(\frac{I_x^+}{I_u}-\frac{I_x^-}{I_u}\right)\left(\frac{I_y}{I_u}\right)</math>. This can be rephrased as <math>\,\! (I_z^+I_u-I_z^-I_u)=(I_x^+-I_x^-)(I_y)</math>. By equating the positive and negative portions of the equation, two equations that can be directly built as translinear loops arise: <math>I_yI_x^+=I_uI_z^+</math> <math>I_yI_x^-=I_uI_z^-</math> The following are the alternating loops that implement the desired equations and some biasing schemes for the circuit.

[http://www.transliteracy.com/ (PART 2007)] The modern meaning of the term combines ''literacy'' with the prefix ''trans''-, which means "across; through", so a '''transliterate''' person is one who is literate across multiple media. == History == Transliteracy originally was a term derived from the verb 'to transliterate', meaning to write or print a letter or word using the closest corresponding letters of a different alphabet or language. In modern parlance, though, we extend the act of transliteration and apply it to the increasingly wide range of communication platforms and tools at our disposal. From early [[Manual communication|signing]] and [[orality]] through handwriting, print, TV and film to networked [[digital media]], the concept of transliteracy provides a cohesion of communication modes relevant to reading, writing, interpretation and interaction. Awareness of transliteracy reminds us that fixed-type print is a very new and possibly short-lived phenomenon within the long and diverse history of communication platforms. According to the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, the word 'illiterate' dates back only to 1556, around 100 years after [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]] invented the printing press. Prior to this period more people could read than could write, but many more could do neither. Since the 16th century an increasing number have become fully literate, but today transliteracy is becoming more desirable than print-based [[literacy]].{{Fact|date=August 2008}} The updated meaning of the term, in this case as the plural 'transliteracies', evolved at the Transcriptions Research Project directed by Professor Alan Liu in the Department of English at the [[University of California Santa Barbara]]. Liu later developed and formalised the Transliteracies Project, researching technological, social, and cultural practices of online reading, which launched in 2005. Based at UCSB, the Transliteracies Project includes scholars in the [[humanities]], [[social sciences]], and [[engineering]] in the University of California system (and in the future other research programs). It will establish working groups to study online reading from different perspectives; bring those groups into conjunction behind a shared technology development initiative; publish research and demonstration software; and train graduate students working at the intersections of the humanistic, social, and technological disciplines. Professor [[Sue Thomas (author)|Sue Thomas]], of the Institute of Creative Technologies (IOCT) at [[De Montfort University]], [[Leicester]], UK, attended the First Transliteracies Conference at UCSB in July 2005, and subsequently founded the Production and Research in Transliteracy (PART) group with a focus on writing and production. At DMU, as at UCSB, transliteracy is increasingly seen as an enabling tool to support dialogue between researchers and practitioners from diverse disciplines. The PART group have organised a series of events at the IOCT including a Transliteracy Colloquium (15 May 2007); a Transliteracy Unconference (September 2007), and a Transliteracy Workshop (January 2008). == PART researchers == * [[Chris Joseph (writer/artist)|Chris Joseph]] * [http://www.jesslaccetti.co.uk/musings.htm Jess Laccetti] * Bruce Mason * Simon Perril * [[Kate Pullinger]] * [[Howard Rheingold]] * [[Sue Thomas (author)|Sue Thomas]] ==External links== *[http://www.postliteracy.org Postliteracy.org] * [http://www.transliteracy.com/ Production and Research in Transliteracy (PART)] * [http://www.ioct.dmu.ac.uk/tnn Tags Networks Narrative research project (TNN)] * [http://ioct.dmu.ac.uk Institute of Creative Technologies (IOCT)] * [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=40313 Fearn, H., 2008.
