organization, independent of the [[organizational structure]] that perform them. Other types of business reference model can also depict the relationship between the [[business process]]es, business functions, and the [[business area]]’s business reference model. These reference model can be constructed in layers, and offer a foundation for the analysis of service components, technology, data, and performance. === Economic modelling === [[Image:Islm.svg|thumb|left|A diagram of the [[IS/LM model]]]] [[Economic model]]ling is the theoretical representation of economic processes by a set of [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] and a set of [[logic]]al and/or quantitative relationships between them. The economic model is a simplified framework designed to illustrate complex processes, often but not always using [[Mathematical model|mathematical techniques]]. Frequently, economic models use structural parameters. Structural parameters are underlying [[Parameter#Statistics_and_econometrics|parameters]] in a model or class of models.<ref>Moffatt, Mike. (2008) [[About.com]] ''[http://economics.about.com/od/economicsglossary/g/structuralp.htm Structural Parameters]'' Economics Glossary; Terms Beginning with S. Accessed June 19, 2008.</ref> A model may have various parameters and those parameters may change to create various properties.<ref name="structure">Moffatt, Mike. (2008) [[About.com]] ''[http://economics.about.com/od/economicsglossary/g/structure.htm Structure]'' Economics Glossary; Terms Beginning with S. Accessed June 19, 2008.</ref> In general terms, economic models have two functions: first as a simplification of and abstraction from observed data, and second as a means of selection of data based on a [[paradigm]] of [[econometric]] study. The simplification is particularly important for economics given the enormous [[complexity]] of economic processes. This complexity can be attributed to the diversity of factors that determine economic activity; these factors include: individual and [[co-operation|cooperative]] decision processes, [[Natural resource|resource]] limitations, [[natural environment|environment]]al and [[geography|geographical]] constraints, institutional and [[law|legal]] requirements and purely random fluctuations. Economists therefore must make a reasoned choice of which variables and which relationships between these variables are relevant and which ways of analyzing and presenting this information are useful. === Ontology engineering === [[Ontology engineering]] or ''ontology building'' is a subfield of [[knowledge engineering]] that studies the methods and methodologies for building ontologies. In the domain of enterprise architecture, an [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]] is an outline or a schema used to structure objects, their attributes and relationships in a consistent manner.<ref name="Ostie96"/> As in enterprise modelling, an ontology can be composed of other ontologies. The purpose of ontologies in enterprise modelling is to formalize and establish the sharability, re-usability, assimilation and dissemination of information across all organizations and departments within an enterprise. Thus, an ontology enables integration of the various functions and processes which take place in an enterprise.<ref name="FFG94">G. Fadel, M. Fox, M. Gruninger (1994). "A Generic Enterprise Resource Ontology". In: ''Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Enabling Technologies: Infrastructure for Collaborative Enterprises''. p. 117-128</ref> One common language with well articulated structure and vocabulary would enable the company to be more efficient in its operations. A common ontology will allow for effective communication, understanding and thus coordination among the various divisions of an enterprise. There are various kinds of ontologies used in numerous environments. While the language example given earlier dealt with the area of information systems and design, other ontologies may be defined for processes, methods, activities, etc., within an enterprise.<ref name="Ostie96"/> Using ontologies in enterprise modelling offers several advantages. Ontologies ensure clarity, consistency, and structure to a model. They promote efficient model definition and analysis. Generic [[enterprise ontologies]] allow for reusability of and automation of components. Because ontologies are schemata or outlines, the use of ontologies does not ensure proper enterprise model definition, analysis, or clarity. Ontologies are limited by how they are defined and implemented. An ontology may or may not include the potential or capability to capture the all of the aspects of what is being modelled.<ref name="Ostie96"/> === Systems thinking === {{main|Systems thinking}} The modelling of the enterprise and its environment could facilitate the creation of enhanced understanding of the business domain and processes of the extended enterprise, and especially of the relations—both those that "hold the enterprise together" and those that extend across the boundaries of the enterprise. Since enterprise is a system, concepts used in system thinking<ref>(see, for example, (Weinberg, 1982), or, more generally, works by Bunge, for example, (Bunge, 2003) and by Hayek, for example, (Hayek, 1967))</ref> can be successfully reused in modelling enterprises. This way a fast understanding can be achieved throughout the enterprise about how business functions are working and how they depend upon other functions in the organization. == See also == * [[Business process modeling|Business process modelling]] * [[Enterprise architecture]] * [[Enterprise Architecture framework]] * [[Enterprise integration]] * [[Enterprise life cycle]] * [[ISO 19439]] * [[Enterprise Data Modeling]] == References == {{reflist}} == Further reading == * [[August-Wilhelm Scheer]] (1992).

One hallmark of enterprise portals is the de-centralized content contribution and content management, which keeps the information always updated. ==History== The mid-1990s saw the advent of public [[Web portal]]s like [[AltaVista]], [[AOL]], [[Excite]], and [[Yahoo]]!. These sites provided a key set of features (e.g., news, e-mail, weather, stock quotes, and search) that were often presented in self-contained boxes or [[portlets]]. Before long, enterprises of all sizes began to see a need for a similar starting place for their variety of internal repositories and applications, many of which were migrating
