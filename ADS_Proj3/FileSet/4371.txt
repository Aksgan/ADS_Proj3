Metal tools ==== Continuing improvements led to the [[furnace]] and [[bellows]] and provided the ability to [[smelting|smelt]] and [[forge]] native metals (naturally occurring in relatively pure form).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://neon.mems.cmu.edu/cramb/Processing/history.html | title=A Short History of Metals | accessdate=2007-01-08 | last=Cramb | first=Alan W | publisher=[[Carnegie Mellon University]]}}</ref> [[Gold]], [[copper]], [[silver]], and [[lead]], were such early metals. The advantages of copper tools over stone, bone, and wooden tools were quickly apparent to early humans, and native copper was probably used from near the beginning of [[Neolithic]] times (about 8000 BC).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VANVAEjBG-QC&pg=PA708&lr=&as_brr=1&ei=fl2NR6ODGYbWiwGW8Zi_BA|accessdate=2008-05-17|author= Chisholm, Hugh|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|year=1910|page=708}}</ref> Native copper does not naturally occur in large amounts, but copper ores are quite common and some of them produce metal easily when burned in wood or charcoal fires. Eventually, the working of metals led to the discovery of [[alloys]] such as [[bronze]] and [[brass]] (about 4000 BC). The first uses of iron alloys such as [[steel]] dates to around 1400 BC. ==== Energy and Transport ==== [[File:Wheel Iran.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[wheel]] was invented circa 4000 BC.]] Meanwhile, humans were learning to harness other forms of energy. The earliest known use of wind power is the sailboat.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dodge|first=Darrell|title=Part 1 - Early History Through 1875|url=http://www.telosnet.com/wind/early.html|work=Illustrated History of Wind Power Development|accessdate=23 June 2010}}</ref> The earliest record of a ship under sail is shown on an Egyptian pot dating back to 3200 BC.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dollinger|first=André|title=Ships and Boats|url=http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/timelines/topics/navigation.htm|work=Pharaonic Egypt|accessdate=23 June 2010}}</ref> From prehistoric times, Egyptians probably used the power of the Nile annual floods to irrigate their lands, gradually learning to regulate much of it through purposely built irrigation channels and 'catch' basins. Similarly, the early peoples of Mesopotamia, the Sumerians, learned to use the Tigris and Euphrates rivers for much the same purposes. But more extensive use of wind and water (and even human) power required another invention. According to archaeologists, the [[wheel]] was invented around 4000 B.C. The wheel was probably independently invented in Mesopotamia (in present-day [[Iraq]]) as well. Estimates on when this may have occurred range from 5500 to 3000 B.C., with most experts putting it closer to 4000 B.C. The oldest artifacts with drawings that depict wheeled carts date from about 3000 B.C.; however, the wheel may have been in use for millennia before these drawings were made. There is also evidence from the same period of time that wheels were used for the production of [[Potter's wheel|pottery]]. (Note that the original potter's wheel was probably not a wheel, but rather an irregularly shaped slab of flat wood with a small hollowed or pierced area near the center and mounted on a peg driven into the earth. It would have been rotated by repeated tugs by the potter or his assistant.) More recently, the oldest-known wooden wheel in the world was found in the Ljubljana marshes of Slovenia.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.angelfire.com/country/veneti/AmerDomoOldestWheel.html | title=Slovenian Marsh Yields World's Oldest Wheel | accessdate=2007-02-13 | publisher=Ameriška Domovina | date=2003-03-27}}</ref> The invention of the wheel revolutionized activities as disparate as transportation, war, and the production of pottery (for which it may have been first used). It didn't take long to discover that wheeled wagons could be used to carry heavy loads and fast (rotary) potters' wheels enabled early mass production of pottery. But it was the use of the wheel as a transformer of energy (through water wheels, windmills, and even treadmills) that revolutionized the application of nonhuman power sources. === Medieval and Modern history (300 AD —) === {{Main|Medieval technology|Renaissance technology|Industrial Revolution}} Innovations continued through the [[Middle Ages]] with new innovations such as [[silk]], the [[horse collar]] and [[horseshoe]]s in the first few hundred years after the fall of the [[Roman Empire]]. [[Medieval technology]] saw the use of [[simple machine]]s (such as the [[lever]], the [[screw]], and the [[pulley]]) being combined to form more complicated tools, such as the [[wheelbarrow]], [[windmill]]s and [[clock]]s. The [[Renaissance technology|Renaissance]] brought forth many of these innovations, including the [[printing press]] (which facilitated the greater communication of knowledge), and technology became increasingly associated with [[science]], beginning a cycle of mutual advancement. The advancements in technology in this era allowed a more steady supply of food, followed by the wider availability of consumer goods. Starting in the United Kingdom in the 18th century, the [[Industrial Revolution]] was a period of great technological discovery, particularly in the areas of [[Agricultural Revolution|agriculture]], [[manufacturing]], [[mining]], [[metallurgy]] and [[transport]], driven by the discovery of [[steam power]]. Technology later took another step with the harnessing of [[electricity]] to create such innovations as the [[electric motor]], [[light bulb]] and countless others. Scientific advancement and the discovery of new concepts later allowed for [[flight|powered flight]], and advancements in [[medicine]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]] and [[engineering]]. The rise in technology has led to the construction of [[skyscraper]]s and large cities whose inhabitants rely on [[automobile]]s or other powered transit for transportation. Communication was also improved with the invention of the [[telegraph]], [[telephone]], [[radio]] and [[television]]. The second half of the 20th century brought a host of new innovations. In [[physics]], the discovery of [[nuclear fission]] has led to both [[nuclear weapons]] and [[nuclear energy]]. [[Computers]] were also invented and later [[miniaturization|miniaturized]] utilizing [[transistor]]s and [[integrated circuit]]s. These advancements subsequently led to the creation of the [[Internet]]. Humans have also been able to [[space exploration|explore space]] with [[satellite]]s (later used for [[telecommunication]]) and in manned missions going all the way to the moon. In medicine, this era brought innovations such as [[Cardiac surgery|open-heart surgery]] and later [[stem cell treatments|stem cell therapy]] along with new [[pharmaceutical drug|medications]] and treatments. Complex [[manufacturing]] and [[construction]] techniques and organizations are needed to construct and maintain these new technologies, and entire [[industry|industries]] have arisen to support and develop succeeding generations of increasingly more complex tools. Modern technology increasingly relies on training and education — their designers, builders, maintainers, and users often require sophisticated general and specific training. Moreover, these technologies have become so complex that entire fields have been created to support them, including [[engineering]], [[medicine]], and [[computer science]], and other fields have been made more complex, such as [[construction]], [[transportation]] and [[architecture]]. ==Technology and
