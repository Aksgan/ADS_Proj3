a [[USB flash drive]] or even [[floppy disk]]. *[[Biometric]] methods promise authentication based on unalterable personal characteristics, but currently (2008) have high error rates and require additional hardware to scan, for example, [[fingerprint]]s, [[iris (anatomy)|iris]]es, etc. They have proven easy to spoof in some famous incidents testing commercially available systems, for example, the gummie fingerprint spoof demonstration,<ref>T Matsumoto.

Such schemes do not relieve user and administrators from choosing reasonable single passwords, nor system designers or administrators from ensuring that private access control information passed among systems enabling single sign-on is secure against attack. As yet, no satisfactory standard has been developed. *Envaulting technology is a password-free way to secure data on e.g. removable storage devices such as USB flash drives. Instead of user passwords, access control is based on the user's access to a network resource. *Non-text-based passwords, such as graphical passwords or mouse-movement based passwords.<ref>http://waelchatila.com/2005/09/18/1127075317148.html</ref> [[File:Image-based Authentication.jpg|thumb |alt=Pictures as one-time passcodes|A randomly-generated grid of images used to create one-time passwords]] Graphical passwords are an alternative means of [[authentication]] for log-in intended to be used in place of conventional password; they use [[image]]s, [[graphics]] or [[colours]] instead of [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]], [[digit (math)|digit]]s or [[special characters]]. One system requires users to select a series of [[face]]s as a password, utilizing the [[human brain]]'s ability to [[face perception|recall faces]] easily.<ref>http://mcpmag.com/reviews/products/article.asp?EditorialsID=486</ref> In some implementations the user is required to pick from a series of images in the correct sequence in order to gain access.<ref>http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid14_gci1001829,00.html</ref> Another graphical password solution creates a [[one-time password]] using a randomly-generated grid of images. Each time the user is required to authenticate, they look for the images that fit their pre-chosen categories and enter the randomly-generated alphanumeric character that appears in the image to form the one-time password. <ref name=“Images Could Change the Authentication Picture”>{{cite web |url=http://www.darkreading.com/authentication/security/client/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=228200140 |title=Images Could Change the Authentication Picture |author=Ericka Chickowski |publisher=Dark Reading |date=2010-11-03}}</ref> <ref name=“Confident Technologies Delivers Image-Based, Multifactor Authentication to Strengthen Passwords on Public-Facing Websites”>{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Confident-Technologies-Delivers-Image-Based-Multifactor-Authentication-Strengthen-Passwords-1342854.htm |title=Confident Technologies Delivers Image-Based, Multifactor Authentication to Strengthen Passwords on Public-Facing Websites|date=2010-10-28}}</ref> So far, graphical passwords are promising, but are not widely used.

This process eliminates the possibility of local reverse engineering as the code used to authenticate the password does not reside on the local machine. Transmission of the password, via the browser, in plaintext means it can be intercepted along its journey to the server. Many web authentication systems use SSL to establish an encrypted session between the browser and the server, and is usually the underlying meaning of claims to have a "secure Web site". This is done automatically by the browser and increases integrity of the session, assuming neither end has been compromised and that the [[Transport Layer Security|SSL/TLS]] implementations used are high quality ones. ==History of passwords== Passwords or ''watchwords'' have been used since ancient times. [[Polybius]] describes the system for distribution watchwords in the [[Military of ancient Rome|Roman military]] as follows: :The way in which they secure the passing round of the watchword for the night is as follows: from the tenth [[maniple (military unit)|maniple]] of each class of infantry and cavalry, the maniple which is encamped at the lower end of the street, a man is chosen who is relieved from guard duty, and he attends every day at sunset at the tent of the [[tribune]], and receiving from him the watchword - that is a wooden tablet with the word inscribed on it - takes his leave, and on returning to his quarters passes on the watchword and tablet before witnesses to the commander of the next maniple, who in turn passes it to the one next him. All do the same until it reaches the first maniples, those encamped near the tents of the tribunes. These latter are obliged to deliver the tablet to the tribunes before dark. So that if all those issued are returned, the tribune knows that the watchword has been given to all the maniples, and has passed through all on its way back to him. If any one of them is missing, he makes inquiry at once, as he knows by the marks from what quarter the tablet has not returned, and whoever is responsible for the stoppage meets with the punishment he merits.<ref>[http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_text_polybius6.htm Polybius on the Roman Military<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Passwords in military use evolved to include not just a password, but a password and a counterpassword; for example in the opening days of the [[Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy]], paratroopers of the U.S. 101st Airborne Division used a password -
