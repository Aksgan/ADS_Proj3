It was the successor to the company's high-end [[Voodoo 2]] line and was based heavily upon the older [[Voodoo Banshee]] product. Voodoo3 was announced at [[COMDEX]] '98 and arrived on store shelves in 1999.<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/11-16-1998/0000803667&EDATE= 3Dfx Interactive Blasts COMDEX with Voodoo3 Debut And Four Voodoo Banshee PC-OEM Announcements], 3dfx Press Release, November 16, 1998.</ref> The Voodoo3 line was the first product manufactured by the combined [[STB Technologies]] and 3dfx.<ref>Brown, Peter.

Due to mis-management by 3dfx, this caused the next-generation 'Rampage' project to suffer delays which would prove to be fatal to the entire company. Avenger was pushed to the forefront as it offered a quicker time to market than the already delayed Rampage. Avenger was no more than the Banshee core with a second texture mapping unit (TMU) added - the same TMU which Banshee lost compared to Voodoo2. Avenger was thus merely a Voodoo2 with an integrated 128-bit 2D video accelerator and twice the clock speed. ==Architecture and performance== [[Image:Voodoo3-2000AGP.jpg|thumb|3dfx Voodoo3 2000 AGP]] [[Image:Voodoo3-2000PCI.jpg|thumb|3dfx Voodoo3 2000 PCI]] [[Image:Voodoo3-3000AGP.jpg|thumb|3dfx Voodoo3 3000 AGP]] Much was made of Voodoo3 (as Avenger was christened) and its [[Highcolour|16-bit color]] rendering limitation. This was in fact quite complex, as Voodoo3 operated to full [[truecolor|32-bit]] precision (8 bits per channel, 16.7M colours) in its texture mappers and pixel pipeline as opposed to previous products from 3dfx and other vendors, which had only worked in 16-bit precision. To save framebuffer space, the Voodoo3's rendering output was dithered to 16 bit. This offered better quality than running in pure 16-bit mode. However, a controversy arose over what happened next. The Voodoo3's [[RAMDAC]], which took the rendered frame from the framebuffer and generated the display image, performed a 2x2 box or 4x1 line filter on the dithered image to almost reconstruct the original [[Truecolor|24-bit color]] render. 3dfx claimed this to be '22-bit' equivalent quality.<ref>Beets, Kristof. [http://www.beyond3d.com/content/articles/59/ 3dfx '22Bit Colour' Explored], Beyond3D, May 7, 1999.</ref> As such, Voodoo3's [[framebuffer]] was not representative of the final output, and therefore, screenshots did not accurately portray Voodoo3's display quality which was actually much closer to the 24-bit outputs of NVIDIA's [[RIVA TNT2]] and ATI's [[ATI Rage|Rage 128]]. The internal organisation of Avenger was not complex. Pre-setup notably featured a guardband clipper (eventually part of hardware transformation and lighting) but the pixel pipeline was a conventional single-issue, dual-texture design almost identical to that featured on Voodoo2, but
