the [[University of Leipzig]], so Leibniz inherited his father's personal library. He was given free access to this from the age of seven and thereafter. While Leibniz's schoolwork focused on a small canon of authorities, his father's library enabled him to study a wide variety of advanced philosophical and theological works – ones that he would not have otherwise been able to read until his college years.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Access to his father's library, largely written in Latin, also led to his proficiency in the Latin language. Leibniz was proficient in Latin by the age of 12, and he composed three hundred hexameters of Latin verse in a single morning for a special event at school at the age of 13.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} He enrolled in his father's former university at age 14, and he completed his [[bachelor's degree]] in philosophy in December of 1662. He defended his ''Disputatio Metaphysica de Principio Individui'', which addressed the [[Principle of individuation]], on June 9, 1663. Leibniz earned his [[master's degree]] in philosophy on February 7, 1664. He published and defended a dissertation ''Specimen Quaestionum Philosophicarum ex Jure collectarum'', arguing for both a theoretical and a pedagogical relationship between philosophy and law, in December 1664. After one year of legal studies, he was awarded his bachelor's degree in Law on 28 September 1665.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} In 1666, (at age 20), Leibniz published his first book, ''[[De Arte Combinatoria|On the Art of Combinations]]'', the first part of which was also his [[habilitation]] thesis in philosophy. His next goal was to earn his license and doctorate in Law, which normally required three years of study then. Older students in the law school blocked his early graduation plans, prompting Leibniz to leave Leipzig in disgust in September of 1666.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Leibniz then enrolled in the [[University of Altdorf]], and almost immediately he submitted a thesis, which he had probably been working on earlier in Leipzig. The title of his thesis was ''Disputatio de Casibus perplexis in Jure.'' Leibniz earned his license to practice law and his Doctorate in Law in November of 1666. He next declined the offer of an academic appointment at Altdorf, and he spent the rest of his life in the paid service of two main German noble families.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} As an adult, Leibniz often introduced himself as "Gottfried von Leibniz". Also many posthumously-published editions of his writings presented his name on the title page as "[[Freiherr]] G. W. von Leibniz." However, no document has ever been found from any contemporary government that stated his appointment to any form of [[nobility]].<ref>Aiton 1985: 312</ref> ===1666–74=== Leibniz's first position was as a salaried [[alchemy|alchemist]] in [[Nuremberg]], even though he knew nothing about the subject. He soon met Johann Christian von Boineburg (1622–1672), the dismissed chief minister of the Elector of [[Mainz]], [[Johann Philipp von Schönborn]]. Von Boineburg hired Leibniz as an assistant, and shortly thereafter reconciled with the Elector and introduced Leibniz to him. Leibniz then dedicated an essay on law to the Elector in the hope of obtaining employment. The stratagem worked; the Elector asked Leibniz to assist with the redrafting of the legal code for his Electorate. In 1669, Leibniz was appointed Assessor in the Court of Appeal. Although von Boineburg died late in 1672, Leibniz remained under the employment of his widow until she dismissed him in 1674. Von Boineburg did much to promote Leibniz's reputation, and the latter's memoranda and letters began to attract favorable notice. Leibniz's service to the Elector soon followed a [[diplomat]]ic role. He published an essay, under the pseudonym of a fictitious [[Poland|Polish]] nobleman, arguing (unsuccessfully) for the German candidate for the Polish crown. The main European geopolitical reality during Leibniz's adult life was the ambition of [[Louis XIV of France]], backed by French military and economic might. Meanwhile, the [[Thirty Years' War]] had left German-speaking Europe exhausted, fragmented, and economically backward. Leibniz proposed to protect German-speaking Europe by distracting Louis as follows. France would be invited to take [[Egypt]] as a stepping stone towards an eventual conquest of the [[Dutch East Indies]]. In return, France would agree to leave Germany and the Netherlands undisturbed. This plan obtained the Elector's cautious support. In 1672, the French government invited Leibniz to [[Paris]] for discussion, but the plan was soon overtaken by the outbreak of the [[Franco-Dutch War]] and became irrelevant. Napoleon's failed invasion of Egypt in 1798 can be seen as an unwitting implementation of Leibniz's plan. Thus Leibniz began several years in Paris. Soon after arriving, he met [[Netherlands|Dutch]] physicist and mathematician [[Christiaan Huygens]] and realised that his own knowledge of mathematics and physics was patchy. With Huygens as mentor, he began a program of self-study that soon pushed him to making major contributions to both subjects, including inventing his version of the differential and integral [[infinitesimal calculus|calculus]]. He met [[Nicolas Malebranche]] and [[Antoine Arnauld]], the leading French philosophers of the day, and studied the writings of [[Descartes]] and [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], unpublished as well as published. He befriended a German mathematician, [[Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus]]; they corresponded for the rest of their lives. [[File:Leibnitzrechenmaschine.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Stepped Reckoner]].]] When it became clear that France would not implement its part of Leibniz's Egyptian plan, the Elector sent his nephew, escorted by Leibniz, on a related mission to the English government in [[London]], early in 1673. There Leibniz came into acquaintance of [[Henry Oldenburg]] and [[John Collins (mathematician)|John Collins]]. After demonstrating a calculating machine he had been designing and building since 1670 to the [[Royal Society]], the first such machine that could execute all four basic arithmetical operations, the Society made him an external member. The mission ended abruptly when news reached it of the Elector's death, whereupon Leibniz promptly returned to Paris and not, as had been planned, to Mainz. The sudden deaths of Leibniz's two patrons in the same winter meant that Leibniz had to find a new basis for his career. In this regard, a 1669 invitation from the Duke of [[Brunswick-Lüneburg|Brunswick]] to visit Hanover proved fateful.
