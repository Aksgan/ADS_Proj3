position in Analysis and Design professional education, and the Professional Services division quickly became not only the largest component of Nastec Corporation, but also the largest provider of [[SA/SD]] education. Case was among the most prolific public speakers on the subject of CASE during the 1980s, helping launch, among other events, the Computer-Aided Software Engineering Symposium as its keynote speaker for its first two years. Case toured the country, promoting the integration of ''upper CASE'' and ''lower CASE'' with pro-football great and code-generation pioneer [[Fran Tarkenton]], founder of ''Tarkenton Software.'' When Tarkenton Software and Nastec Corporation agreed not to merge, Tarkenton teamed up with [[James Martin (author)|James Martin]] and merged Tarkenton Software into [[KnowledgeWare]], a direct competitor to Nastec. === Principles of Computer Aided Software Engineering === Case, also author of the book ''Information Systems Development: Principles of Computer Aided Software Engineering'' (Prentice Hall, 1986), was also a life long student of General Systems Theory (GST) and fascinated by the application of structured analysis and design techniques to the design of entire business operations, not just the information technology subsystems. At Gartner, Case quickly ascended the analyst ranks, going from the leading Software Engineering analyst to head of its Business Process Reengineering practice - where he could spend full-time applying GST to business design, launching Gartner's e-Business Resource Center, its Vertical Industries practices and ultimately becoming the founder, group vice president and general manager of Gartner's TCO Software division. From there, Case became head of Gartner's IT benchmarking business and president of Gartner's eMetrix business performance management business. During his 13 year tenure at Gartner, Case launched dozens of product and service lines that accounted for over $100 million in revenue to Gartner. === Stamford Research === His firm Stamford Research, LLC,<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080208125643/http://www.stamfordresearch.com/ Stamford Research, LLC]</ref> working with long-time business associates Arnold Kwong and Steve Vogel, is almost exclusively engaged as a "consulting executive" in which Case and his associates assume interim senior management roles with the client companies, bringing with them a global network of IT and business operations experts. Case himself characterizes the practice as focusing on two lines of business: Applying GST principles to help startups and fix "broken" companies. == References == {{Reflist}} {{BLP sources|date=January 2009}} == Further reading == * [http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/c/Case_Jr=:Albert_F=.html Case, Albert F., Information Systems Development: Principles of Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE)(Prentice Hall, 1986)] at www.informatik.uni-trier.de * [http://72.14.209.104/search?q=cache:Zrid83HROp4J:www.iccc-group.com/goldtour/invit_goldratt_tour.pdf+%22albert+f.+case,+jr.%22&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=26 Al Case citation] Dr. Eli Goldratt's Necessary & Sufficient Tour. * [http://wotan.liu.edu/docis/dbl/datbas/1985_17_1_35_CSETF.htm "Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE): Technology for Improving Software Development Productivity"] Database Journal, Vol 17, Issue 1, pp. 35–43 {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME = Case, Albert F.
