Since 1949, the party system has been dominated by the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] with all chancellors hitherto being member of either party. However, the smaller liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (which has had members in the ''Bundestag'' since 1949) and the [[Alliance '90/The Greens]] (which has controlled seats in parliament since 1983) have also played important roles,<ref>[http://countrystudies.us/germany/159.htm Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] U.S. Library of Congress.

Germany has a [[civil law (legal system)|civil or statute law system]] that is based on [[Roman law]] with some references to [[Germanic law]]. The ''[[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Bundesverfassungsgericht]]'' (Federal Constitutional Court), located in Karlsruhe, is the German Supreme Court responsible for constitutional matters, with power of [[judicial review]].<ref>[http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/en/index.html Federal Constitutional Court], Bundesverfassungsgericht.de. Retrieved 13 April 2007.</ref> It acts as the highest legal authority and ensures that legislative and judicial practice conforms to the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] (Basic Law). It acts independently of the other state bodies, but cannot act on its own behalf. Germany's supreme court system, called ''Oberste Gerichtshöfe des Bundes'', is specialised. For civil and criminal cases, the highest court of appeal is the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany|Federal Court of Justice]], located in [[Karlsruhe]] and [[Leipzig]]. The courtroom style is [[inquisitorial system|inquisitorial]]. Other Federal Courts are the [[Federal Labor Court of Germany|Federal Labour Court]] in [[Erfurt]], the [[Bundessozialgericht|Federal Social Court]] in [[Kassel]], the [[Federal Finance Court of Germany|Federal Finance Court]] in [[Munich]] and the [[Federal Administrative Court of Germany|Federal Administrative Court]] in Leipzig. [[File:HH Polizeihauptmeister MZ.jpg|thumb|150px|left|German [[Landespolizei|state police]] officer in [[Hamburg]]]] [[Criminal law]] and [[private law]] are codified on the national level in the ''[[Strafgesetzbuch]]'' and the ''[[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'' respectively. The German penal system is aimed towards rehabilitation of the criminal; its secondary goal is the protection of the general public.<ref>{{de icon}} [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stvollzg/__2.html § 2 Strafvollzugsgesetz] Bundesministerium der Justiz. Retrieved 19 November 2009.</ref> To achieve the latter, a convicted criminal can be put in preventive detention (''Sicherungsverwahrung'') in addition to the regular sentence if he is considered to be a threat to the general public. The ''[[Völkerstrafgesetzbuch]]'' regulates the consequences of [[crimes against humanity]], [[genocide]] and [[war crimes]]. It gives German courts [[universal jurisdiction]] if prosecution by a court of the country where the crime was committed, or by an international court, is not possible. Legislative power is divided between the federation and the state level. The Basic Law presumes that all legislative power remains at the state level unless otherwise designated by the Basic Law itself. Any federal law overrides state law if the legislative power lies at the federal level. A famous example is the purported Hessian provision for the death penalty, which goes against the ban on capital punishment under the Basic Law, rendering the Hessian provision invalid. The ''[[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]'' is the federal organ through which the states participate in national legislation. State participation in federal legislation is necessary if the law falls within the area of concurrent legislative power, requires states to administer federal regulations, or is so designated by the Basic Law. Every state has its own constitutional court. The ''[[Amtsgericht]]e'', ''Landgerichte'' and ''Oberlandesgerichte'' are state courts of [[general jurisdiction]]. They are competent whether the action is based on federal or state law. Many of the fundamental matters of [[administrative law]] remain in the jurisdiction of the states, though most states base their own laws in that area on the 1976 ''Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz'' (Administrative Proceedings Act) covering important points of administrative law. The ''Oberverwaltungsgerichte'' are the highest level of administrative jurisdiction concerning the state administrations, unless the question of law concerns federal law or state law identical to federal law. In such cases, final appeal to the Federal Administrative Court is possible. ===Foreign relations=== {{Main|Foreign relations of Germany}} [[File:33rdG8Leaders.jpg|thumb|Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]], the head of government, hosting the [[G8]] summit in [[Heiligendamm]].]] Germany maintains a network of 229 diplomatic missions abroad and holds relations with more than 190 countries.<ref>[http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/EN/AAmt/Auslandsvertretungen/Uebersicht_node.html German Missions Abroad] German Federal Foreign Office.
