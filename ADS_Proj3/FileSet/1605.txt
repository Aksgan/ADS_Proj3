In addition to detailed image retouching and free-form drawing, GIMP can accomplish essential image editing tasks such as resizing, editing, and cropping photos, photomontages combining multiple images, and converting between different image formats. GIMP can also be used to create basic animated images in the [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] format. With its encyclopedic abilities, GIMP is widely considered <ref>http://www.zdnet.co.uk/reviews/content-creation/2007/07/20/can-gimp-replace-photoshop-39288136/</ref> to be the main free-software functional drop-in replacement for [[Adobe Photoshop]], with a similar feature set and a similar and complex user interface. GIMP's product vision is that GIMP is or will become a free software high-end graphics application for the editing and creation of original images, icons, graphical elements of web pages and art for user interface elements.<ref>{{cite web |title=GIMP UI Redesign |url=http://gui.gimp.org/index.php/GIMP_UI_Redesign |date=17 May 2008 |work=GIMP UI redesign |publisher=GIMP UI team |accessdate=2 July 2009}}</ref> GIMP is also used by photographers and the film industry {{who?|date=December 2010}}. ==History== {{Main|GIMP release history}} [[File:Gimp-2.6.0.png|thumb|left|300px|Screenshot of GIMP 2.6 [[manipulate|manipulating]] an image |300px]] GIMP originally stood for the ''General Image Manipulation Program''.<ref name="GIMP0.54-README"> {{cite web |url = ftp://ftp.gimp.org/pub/gimp/historical/gimp-0.54.1.fixed.tar.gz |title = readme |accessdate = 2008-03-23 |author = Spencer Kimball & Peter Mattis |date = 1996-02-11 |format=tarred and gzipped text, see README}} </ref> GIMP's original creators, [[Spencer Kimball]] and [[Peter Mattis]], began developing GIMP in 1995 as a semester-long project at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].
