providing a rack-mounting system robust enough for industrial use, with easily interchangeable boards and processor independence. <ref>{{cite book|last=Tooley|first=Michael H|title=PC-based instrumentation and control|isbn=0-7506-2083-5|pages=91â€“101}}</ref> ==Decline== The STEbus market began to decline as the IBM PC made progress into industrial control systems. Customers opted for PC-based products as the software base was larger and cheaper. More programmers were familiar with the PC and did not have to learn new systems. Memory costs fell, so there was less reason to have bus-based memory expansion when one could have plenty on the processor board. So despite the disadvantages, manufacturers created industrial PC systems and eventually dropped other bus systems. Moving on, PC systems did away with the need for card cages and backplanes by moving to the [[PC104]] format where boards stack onto each other. While not as well designed as the STEbus, PC104 is good enough for many applications. The major manufacturers from its peak period now support STEbus mostly for goodwill with old customers who bought a lot of product from them. The IEEE have withdrawn the standard, not because of any faults but because it is no longer active enough to update. ==Physical format== 3U [[Eurocard (printed circuit board)|Eurocard]] - The most common size was the 100 x 160 mm Eurocard. 6U [[Eurocard (printed circuit board)|Eurocard]] - Rare, sometimes used in VMEbus hybrid boards ==Connector== DIN41612, rows a and c, 0.1" pitch. VME/STE hybrid boards have the STEbus and VMEbus sharing the VME P2 connector, VME signals on row b. For this reason, STEbus boards may not use row b for any purpose. == Pinout == {| class="wikitable" style=" float: right; clear: right;" |+ STEbus pinout<br>Seen looking into backplane socket !num. !name !a b c !name |- !1 !GND ! o + o !GND |- !2 ! +5V ! o + o ! +5V |- !3 !D0 ! o + o !D1 |- !4 !D2 ! o + o !D3 |- !5 !D4 ! o + o !D5 |- !6 !D6 ! o + o !D7 |- !7 !A0 ! o + o !GND |- !8 !A2 ! o + o !A1 |- !9 !A4 ! o + o !A3 |- !10 !A6 ! o + o !A5 |- !11 !A8 ! o + o !A7 |- !12 !A10 ! o + o !A9 |- !13 !A12 ! o + o !A11 |- !14 !A14 ! o + o !A13 |- !15 !A16 ! o + o !A15 |- !16 !A18 ! o + o !A17 |- !17 !CM0 ! o + o !A19 |- !18 !CM2 ! o + o !CM1 |- !19 !ADRSTB* ! o + o !GND |- !20 !DATACK* ! o + o !DATSTB* |- !21 !TRFERR* ! o + o !GND |- !22 !ATNRQ0* ! o + o !SYSRST* |- !23 !ATNRQ2* ! o + o !ATNRQ1* |- !24 !ATNRQ4* ! o + o !ATNRQ3* |- !25 !ATNRQ6* ! o + o !ATNRQ5* |- !26 !GND ! o + o !ATNRQ7* |- !27 !BUSRQ0* ! o + o !BUSRQ1* |- !28 !BUSAK0* ! o + o !BUSAK1* |- !29 !SYSCLK ! o + o !VSTBY |- !30 !-12V ! o + o !+12V |- !31 ! +5V ! o + o ! +5V |- !32 !GND ! o + o !GND |} Active low signals indicated by asterisk. '''GND:''' Ground reference voltage '''+5V:''' Powers most logic. '''+12V and -12V:''' Primarily useful for RS232 buffer power. The +12V has been used for programming voltage generators. Both can be used in analogue circuitry, but note that these are primarily power rails for digital circuitry and as such they often have digital noise. Some decoupling or local regulation is recommended for analogue circuitry. '''VSTBY:''' Standby voltage. Optional. This line is reserved for carrying a battery backup voltage to boards that supply or consume it. A 3.6V NiCad battery is a common source. The STEbus spec is not rigid about where this should be sourced from. In practice, this means that most boards requiring backup power tend to play safe and have a battery on board, often with a link to allow it to supply or accept power from VSTBY. Hence you can end up with more batteries in your system than you need, and you must then take care that no more than one battery is driving VSTBY. '''D0...7:''' Data bus. This is only 8-bits wide, but most I/O or memory-mapped peripherals are byte-oriented. '''A0...19:''' Address bus. This allows up to 1 MByte of memory to be addressed. Current technology is such that processor requiring large amounts of memory have this on the processor board, so this is not a great limitation. I/O space is limited to 4K, to simplify I/O address decoding to a practical level. A 74LS688 can decode A11...4 to locate I/O slave boards at 16-byte boundaries. '''CM0...2:''' Command Modifiers. These indicate the nature of the data transfer cycle. {| class="wikitable" style=" clear: left;" |+ Command modifers |- !CM<br>2 1 0 !colspan="2"| Function |- ! 1 1 1 ! read !rowspan="2"| memory |- ! 1 1 0 ! write |- ! 1 0 1 ! read !rowspan="2"| I/O |- ! 1 0 0 ! write |- ! 0 1 1 !colspan="2"| acknowledge |- ! 0 1 0 !rowspan="3" colspan="2"| reserved |- ! 0 0 1 |- ! 0 0 0 |} A simple processor board can ignore the acknowledge state and drive CM2 high for all bus access, drive CM1 from a memory/not_IO signal, and CM0 from a read/not_write signal. '''ATNRQ0...7*:''' Attention Requests. These are reserved for boards to signal for processor attention, a term which covers Interrupts and Direct Memory Access (DMA). The wise choice of signal does not commit these lines to being specific types, such as maskable interrupts, non-maskable interrupts, or DMA. The number of Attention Requests reflects the intended role of the STEbus, in real-time control systems. Eight lines can be priority encoded into three bits, and is a reasonably practical number of lines to handle. '''BUSRQ0...1* and BUSAK0...1*:''' Bus Requests and Bus
