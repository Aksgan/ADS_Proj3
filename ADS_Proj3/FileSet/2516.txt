Simon's decisions (separated into categories for [[Education]], [[Lifestyle (sociology)|Lifestyle]], [[Business]] & Work, [[Financial]], [[Leisure]], Purchase, [[Health]], and [[Student]])<ref>[http://www.letsimondecide.com/decision-help/checklists "Simon's Decisions"]</ref> feature lists of factors to consider, possible alternatives, and links to resources that are related to the decision. Users can rate the outcome of their decisions and publish a summary of their decision with the community, as well as browse through the decisions of others.<ref>[http://www.letsimondecide.com/online-simon-community/decisions "Simonites' Decisions"]</ref> === Simon's Tools === Let Simon Decide currently offers three [[decision making]] tools that take between 5 and 10 minutes to use: My Scores, My Life Match, and My Points of View.<ref>Jennifer Van Grove. [http://mashable.com/2009/05/06/let-simon-decide/ "Hand Off Life’s Big Decisions to Science; Let Simon Decide."] [[Mashable]].</ref> My Scores is the most logical, fact-based tool, ideal for decisions where the user faces multiple appealing alternatives and factors. The user is asked to list their alternatives, list the factors that are important to their decision, rank these factors in order of importance, and score each alternative against each factor.<ref>Jolie O'Dell [http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/for_misguided_youngsters_letsimondecide_aids_decis.php "For Misguided Youngsters, LetSimonDecide Aids Decision-Making Process."] [[ReadWriteWeb]]</ref> My Life Match is the most personal tool and considers the user's goals, current situation, [[personality type]], and activities, based on the My Life Profile<ref>Jason Kincaid.

In February 2010 the owners of the botnet managed to re-establish control over the botnet, through the use of new command and control servers located in the [[United States]]. The takedown has decreased the spam volume of the botnet, however. As of February 2010 the botnets' amount of spam was down to a third of its original <ref name=m86back/>.

The term '''edit distance''' is often used to refer specifically to Levenshtein distance. The Levenshtein distance between two [[string (computer science)|strings]] is defined as the minimum number of edits needed to transform one string into the other, with the allowable edit operations being insertion, deletion, or substitution of a single character. It is named after [[Vladimir Levenshtein]], who considered this distance in 1965.<ref>{{cite journal |author=В.И.
