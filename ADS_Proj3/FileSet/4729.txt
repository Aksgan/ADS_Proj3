as president of Wang Laboratories. On August 4, 1989, Dr. Wang fired his son. [[Richard Miller (executive)|Richard W. Miller]] replaced him as the president of Wang Laboratories, having been with the company since 1988. Miller announced in December 1989 that the company would start to embrace established software standards, rather than use traditional proprietary designs. An Wang died in March 1990. The company underwent massive restructuring, and in August 1990, it eliminated its bank debt, but still ended the year with a record net loss. In November 1990, Wang announced their first personal computers running [[Unix]]. Previously, Wang's presence in the Unix and [[open system (computing)|open system]]s markets had been modest. UNIX ran on the VS - Interactive Systems first ported IN/ix (their IBM360 version of SYS5 UNIX) to run in a VSOS Virtual machine circa 1985, and then Wang engineers completed the port so that it ran "native" on the VS hardware soon thereafter - but performance was always sub-par as UNIX was never a good fit for the inherently batch-mode nature of the VS hardware, and the line-at-a-time processing approach taken by the VS workstations; indeed, the workstation code had to be largely rewritten to bundle up each keystroke into a frame to be sent back to the host when running UNIX so that "tty" style processing could be implemented. PACE, which offered its [[data dictionary]], excellent [[referential integrity]], and speedy application development, was in the process of being ported to UNIX under the name OPEN Pace. A client server RDBMS model, built on the original product's ideology, OPEN Pace was demonstrated at the North American PACE User Group Conferences in both Boston and Chicago. OPEN Pace, along with a new Windows-based word processor called UpWord (which was at the time considered a strong contender to retake Wangs original market leadership from Microsoft), were touted as their new direction. However, after a marketing study suggested that it would require large capital investments in order to be viable competitors against Microsoft, both products were simply abandoned. [[Ira Magaziner]], who was brought in by Miller in 1990, proposed to take Wang out of the manufacture of computers altogether, and to go big into imaging software instead. In March 1991, the company introduced its Office 2000 marketing strategy, focusing on office productivity. In June 1991 Wang started reselling IBM computers, in exchange for IBM investing into Wang stock. Wang hardware strategy to re-sell IBM [[RS/6000]]s also included further pursuit of UNIX software. In August 1991, they won a suit against [[NEC]] and [[Toshiba]] claiming violation of Wang's patents on [[single in-line memory module]]s (SIMMs). The company still recorded a net loss for the 1991 fiscal year. Wang Laboratories filed for bankruptcy protection on August 18, 1992. Richard Miller stepped down as chairman and chief executive officer in January 1993, and moved to [[AT&T]]. The complex of three Wang towers in Lowell, which originally cost $60 million to build and housed 4,500 workers in over a million square feet (100,000 m<sup>2</sup>) of office space, was foreclosed and sold at auction in 1994 for $525,000. The renovated complex, which is now known as CrossPoint, was subsequently sold in 1998 to a joint venture of Yale Properties and Blackstone Real Estate Advisors for over $100 million. A later deal to sell the complex for $180 million to a joint venture including Davis Marcus Partners, Prudential Real Estate Investors, and others fell apart in February, 2008. ==Post-bankruptcy== The company emerged from bankruptcy in the mid-1990s with $200 million in hand and embarked on a course of acquisition and self-reinvention, eschewing its former role as an innovative designer and manufacturer of computer and related systems. Later in the 1990s, and under the guidance of then CEO Joe Tucci, with the acquisition of the Olsy division of [[Olivetti]] the company changed its name to Wang Global. By then Wang had settled on "network services" as its chosen business. In 1999 Wang Global, by then back up to $3.5 billion in annual revenues, was acquired by [[Getronics]] of The Netherlands, a $1.5 billion network services company active only in parts of Europe and Australia. Joe Tucci departed Wang, after the acquisition, for [[EMC Corporation]]. The Wang VS product line, not actively marketed since the 1992 bankruptcy and now a tiny portion of the Getronics business, survives to this day (February 2006) with 1,000 to 2,000 systems worldwide. The most advanced legacy VS model, capable of supporting over 1,000 users &mdash; the VS18000 Model 950 &mdash; was released in 1999, and smaller models based on the same CPU chip were released in 2000 &mdash; the VS6760 and the VS6780. A new line of Wang VS was introduced in 2005 using completely new hardware. On July 27, 2007, Dutch telecommunications operator [[KPN]] NV said it will launch a management-backed cash bid of â‚¬766 million ([[United States dollar|US$]]1.04 billion) for information-technology-services company Getronics. KPN Chief Executive Ad Scheepbouwer said he doesn't rule out job cuts after the merger. "But in that case, this will be a couple of hundred of jobs rather than thousands," he said. Getronics CEO Klaas Wagenaar will step down after the merger is completed. In August 2008 KPN sold Getronics North America (Getronics-Wang) to [[CompuCom]] of Dallas, Texas (see below). == Rebirth of the Wang VS == In 2005 Getronics announced<ref>http://www.transvirtualsystems.com/getronics-tvs-release.pdf</ref> New VS, a product that is said to seamlessly run the VS OS and all VS software. It is based on a hardware abstraction layer for Intel x86 and IBM POWER. The product is a joint commercial effort of Getronics and [[TransVirtual Systems]].<ref>http://www.transvirtualsystems.com/</ref> In 2006 the New VS was officially designated the "VS22000" family by Getronics. VS software can be run on the New VS, however, without program or data conversion. The New VS is a combination of very specifically configured mainstream PC or PowerPC server hardware running virtualization software. It is interoperable with SCSI-based Wang VS tape and disk drives, which provide a means of restoring VS files from standard backup tapes or copying VS
