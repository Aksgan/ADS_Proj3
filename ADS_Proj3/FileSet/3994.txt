of wire in the coil with every other turn since in such a coil all turns are in series. {{anchor|Cseries}} === Capacitors === [[Capacitor]]s follow the same law using the reciprocals. The total [[capacitance]] of capacitors in series is equal to the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the sum of the reciprocals of their individual capacitances: [[Image:Capacitors in series.svg|A diagram of several capacitors, connected end to end, with the same amount of current going through each.]] :<math>\frac{1}{C_\mathrm{total}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{C_n}</math>. The working voltage of a series combination of identical capacitors is equal to the sum of voltage ratings of individual capacitors. This simple relationship only applies if the voltage ratings are equal as well as the capacitances. However, the division of DC voltage between the capacitors is dominated by the leakage resistance of the capacitors, rather than their capacitances, and this has considerable variation. To counter this equalising resistors may be placed in parallel with each capacitor which effectively add to the leakage current. The value of resistor chosen (perhaps a few megohms) is as large as possible, but low enough to ensure that the capacitor leakage current is insignificant compared to the current through the resistor. At DC, the circuit appears as a chain of series identical resistors and equal voltage division between the capacitors is ensured. In high-voltage circuits, the resistors serve an additional function as [[bleeder resistor]]s.<ref>Williams (2005), p.96.</ref> ===Switches=== Two or more [[switch]]es in series form a [[Logical conjunction|logical AND]]; the circuit only carries current if all switches are 'on'. See [[AND gate]]. ===Cells and batteries=== A [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] is a collection of [[electrochemical cell]]s. If the cells are connected in series, the [[voltage]] of the battery will be the sum of the cell voltages. For example, a 12 volt [[car battery]] contains six 2-volt cells connected in series. == Parallel circuits ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Leyden jar]] --> If two or more components are connected in parallel they have the same potential difference ([[voltage]]) across their ends. The potential differences across the components are the same in magnitude, and they also have identical polarities. The same voltage is applicable to all circuit components connected in parallel. The total current ''I'' is the sum of the currents through the individual components, in accordance with [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws#Kirchhoff's current law (KCL)|Kirchhoffâ€™s current law]]. {{anchor|Rparallel}} ===Resistors=== The current in each individual resistor is found by [[Ohm's law]]. Factoring out the voltage gives :<math>I_\mathrm{total} = V\left(\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{R_n}\right)</math>. To find the total [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] of all components, add the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]] of the resistances <math>R_i</math> of each component and take the reciprocal of the sum. Total resistance will always be less than the value of the smallest resistance: [[Image:Resistors in parallel.svg|A diagram of several resistors, side by side, both leads of each connected to the same wires.]] :<math>\frac{1}{R_\mathrm{total}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{R_n}</math>. For only two resistors, the unreciprocated expression is reasonably simple: :<math>R_\mathrm{total} = \frac{R_1R_2}{R_1+R_2} .</math> This sometimes goes by the mnemonic "product over sum". For ''N'' equal resistors in parallel, the reciprocal sum expression simplifies to: :<math>\frac{1}{R_\mathrm{total}} = \frac{1}{R} \times N</math>. and therefore to: :<math>{R_\mathrm{total}} = \frac{R}{N}</math>. To find the [[current (electricity)|current]] in a component with resistance <math>R_i</math>, use Ohm's law again: :<math>I_i = \frac{V}{R_i}\,</math>. The components divide the current according to their reciprocal resistances, so, in the case of two resistors, :<math>\frac{I_1}{I_2} = \frac{R_2}{R_1}</math>. An old term for devices connected in parallel is ''multiple'', such as a multiple connection for [[arc lamp]]s. Since electrical conductance <math>G</math> is reciprocal to resistance, the expression for total conductance of a parallel circuit of resistors reads: :<math>{G_\mathrm{total}} = {G_1} + {G_2} + \cdots + {G_n}</math>. It should be noted that the relations for total conductance and reactance stand in a complementary relationship: the expression for a series connection of reactances is the same as for parallel connection of conductances, and vice versa. {{anchor|Lparallel}} ===Inductors=== [[Inductor]]s follow the same law, in that the total [[inductance]] of non-coupled inductors in parallel is equal to the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of their individual inductances: [[Image:Inductors in parallel.svg|A diagram of several inductors, side by side, both leads of each connected to the same wires.]] :<math>\frac{1}{L_\mathrm{total}} = \frac{1}{L_1} + \frac{1}{L_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{L_n}</math>. If the inductors are situated in each other's magnetic fields, this approach is invalid due to mutual inductance. If the mutual inductance between two coils in parallel is M, the equivalent inductor is: :<math>\frac{1}{L_\mathrm{total}} = \frac{L_1+L_2-2M}{L_1L_2-M^2 } </math> If <math>L_1=L_2</math> :<math> L_{total} = \frac{L+M}{2}</math> The sign of <math>M</math> depends on how the magnetic fields influence each other. For two equal tightly coupled coils the total inductance is close to that of each single coil. If the polarity of one coil is reversed so that M is negative, then the parallel inductance is nearly zero or the combination is almost non-inductive. It is assumed in the "tightly coupled" case M is very nearly equal to L. However, if the inductances are not equal and the coils are tightly coupled there can be near short circuit conditions and high circulating currents for both positive and negative values of M, which can cause problems. More than three inductors becomes more complex and the mutual inductance of each inductor on each other inductor and their influence on each other must be considered. For three coils, there are three mutual inductances <math>M_{12}</math>, <math>M_{13}</math> and <math>M_{23}</math>. This is best handled by matrix methods and summing the terms of the inverse of the <math>L</math> matrix (3 by 3 in this case). The pertinent equations are of the form: <math>v_{i}=\sum_{j} L_{i,j}\frac{di_{j}}{dt} </math> {{anchor|Cparallel}} === Capacitors === [[Capacitor]]s follow the same law using the reciprocals. The total [[capacitance]] of capacitors in parallel is equal to the sum of their individual capacitances: [[Image:Capacitors in parallel.svg|A diagram of several capacitors, side by side, both leads of each connected to the same wires.]] :<math>C_\mathrm{total} = C_1 + C_2 + \cdots + C_n</math>. The working voltage of a parallel
