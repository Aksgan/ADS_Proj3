Graduated from [[Quince Orchard High School]] in [[Gaithersburg, Maryland]]. ==Amateur career== Most people confuse Darnell Wilson with the outstanding amateur [[Darnell Wilson (middleweight boxer)|Darnell Wilson]] who won the [[United States Amateur Light Middleweight Championship]] three years in a row (1997-99).<ref>[http://www.boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=101533&cat=boxer BoxRec.com: Darnell Wilson]</ref> ==Professional career== Known as "Ding-A-Ling Man", Wilson turned pro in 2000 as a [[light heavyweight]]. He showed a world-class punch and a good chin but couldn't outbox his opponents. His best results were draws with George Jones (record 19-2) and James Lubwama (record 18-1). In 2005 he moved up to [[Cruiserweight (boxing)|cruiserweight]]. There he was outpointed by prospects/fringe contenders [[Vadim Tokarev]] (17-0), [[Felix Cora Jr.]] (17-0-2), and veteran [[Andre Purlette]] (record 38-2) and also lost to [[heavyweight]] [[Owen Beck]]. In late 2006 he at least managed to KO another former light heavyweight in [[Southpaw stance |southpaw]] [[Daniel Judah]] (21-1-3), but at age 32 seemed to be going nowhere. He says of this time: "I was diagnosed. My [[adrenal glands]] were being worn down. I would go flat after a few rounds of sparring because of a bad effect from [[energy drink]]s." His career direction changed dramatically in 2007 when he scored a sensational KO2 over Canadian contender [[Dale Brown (boxer)|Dale Brown]] in [[Edmonton]]. He quickly added another upset KO3 over [[Kelvin Davis (boxer)|Kelvin Davis]] who had put him on the deck before in the second round. Wilson is now rated in the Top 10 by the [[Ring Magazine]]. Wilson knocked out hard-punching [[Emmanuel Nwodo]] on June 29, 2007. [[ESPN]] announcer [[Teddy Atlas]] proclaimed it the most devastating knockout ever on ESPN's [[Friday Night Fights]] series. He finally got a shot at the WBA cruiserweight title on May 3, 2008, but lost a unanimous decision to [[Firat Arslan]]. Wilson lost his first fight of Season 4 of [[The Contender (TV series)|The Contender]] to [[Ehinomen Ehikhamenor]]. ==Life Outside the Ring== Darnell Wilson owns and operates a digital infrastructure firm as a technology [[systems engineer]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2916215|title=Ding-A-Ling-Man ready to sound the alarm on another challenger|first=Joe|last=Tessitore|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2007-06-28|accessdate=2009-10-23}}</ref> ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== * {{boxrec|id=042919}} *[http://www.fightwriter.com/?q=node/721 Davis-fight] *[http://www.fightwriter.com/?q=node/1009 Nwodo-fight] {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME = Wilson, Darnell | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH = 22 September 1974 | PLACE OF BIRTH = | DATE OF DEATH = | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Wilson, Darnell}} [[Category:1974 births]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:American boxers]] [[Category:Cruiserweights]] [[Category:Systems engineers]]</text> </page> <page> <id>9243</id> <title>Darwin (ADL)</title> <text>{{Context|date=March 2009}} {{Refimprove|date=March 2009}} {{confusing|date=January 2011}} '''Darwin''' is an [[Architecture Description Language]] (ADL). It can be used in a [[software engineering]] context to describe the organization of a piece of software in terms of components, their interfaces, and the bindings between components. In comparison to others ADLs, such as [[Wright (ADL)|Wright]], the language does not provide the notion of connectors as a first-class concept. The [[FSP]]{{dn}} language can be used to describe the behaviour modelling, and [[LTSA]]{{dn}} can be used for analysis. The idea is to include the FSP code in the Darwin code like this:<!-- like what? --> Its use of FSP language allow the verification of the temporal properties of the architecture. It was developed at [[Imperial College London]]. ∞“₳”ផทบถકઆઘફછઝઝટટઅదనఖధీ==References== {{Reflist}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Darwin (Adl)}} [[Category:Software architecture]] {{soft-eng-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>9244</id> <title>Darwin (operating system)</title> <text>{{Infobox OS |name = Darwin |developer = [[Apple Inc.]] |family = [[Unix]] |source_model = [[Open source]] |logo = [[Image:Hexley.png|100px]] |screenshot = |caption = |kernel_type = [[Hybrid kernel|Hybrid]] |ui = [[Graphical user interface|Graphical]] |license = Mostly [[Apple Public Source License]], with proprietary drivers<ref>{{cite web|title= Binary Drivers required for PureDarwin|url=http://www.puredarwin.org/legal/binarydrivers|accessdate =2009-07-20}}</ref> |programmed_in = [[C Programming Language|C]], [[C++]] |working_state = Current |website = [http://developer.apple.com/opensource/ Apple - Open Source] |supported_platforms = [[PowerPC]], [[x86]], [[ARM architecture|ARM]] }} '''Darwin''' is an [[open source]] [[POSIX]]-compliant computer [[operating system]] released by [[Apple Inc.]] in 2000. It is composed of code developed by Apple, as well as code derived from [[NeXTSTEP]], [[BSD]], and other [[free software]] projects. Darwin forms the core set of components upon which [[Mac OS X]], [[Apple TV]], and [[IOS (Apple)|iOS]] are based. It is compatible with the [[Single UNIX Specification]] version 3 (SUSv3) and [[POSIX]] UNIX applications and utilities.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Apple Inc.|title=Mac OS X Leopard - Technology - UNIX|url=http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/technology/unix.html|work=Leopard Technology Overview|accessdate=2009-05-19|quote=Leopard is now an Open Brand UNIX 03 Registered Product, conforming to the SUSv3 and POSIX 1003.1 specifications for the C API, Shell Utilities, and Threads.}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=The Open Group|title=Mac OS X Version 10.5 Leopard on Intel-based Macintosh computers certification|url=http://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/brand3555.htm|accessdate=2009-05-19}}</ref> ==History== Darwin's heritage began with [[NeXT]]'s [[NeXTSTEP]] operating system (later known as [[OPENSTEP]]), first released in 1989. After Apple bought NeXT in 1997, it announced it would base its next operating system on OPENSTEP. This was developed into [[Rhapsody (operating system)|Rhapsody]] in 1997 and the Rhapsody-based [[Mac OS X Server 1.0]] in 1999. In 2000, Rhapsody was [[fork (software)|forked]] into Darwin and released as [[open-source software]] under the [[Apple Public Source License]] (APSL), and components from Darwin are present in Mac OS X today. Up to Darwin 8.0, Apple released a binary installer (as an [[ISO image]]) after each major Mac OS X release that allowed one to install Darwin on [[PowerPC]] and [[Intel x86]] computers as a standalone operating system. Minor updates were released as packages that were installed separately. Darwin is now only available as source code,<ref>[[Jordan Hubbard|Hubbard, Jordan]] (October 31, 2007).
