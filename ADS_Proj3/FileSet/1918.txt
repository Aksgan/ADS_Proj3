characteristics for detecting [[computer virus|viruses]] and other forms of [[malware]]. Heuristics are intended to gain computational performance or conceptual simplicity, potentially at the cost of [[accuracy and precision|accuracy or precision]]. In their [[Turing Award]] acceptance speech, [[Herbert Simon]] and [[Allen Newell]] discuss the Heuristic Search Hypothesis: a physical symbol system will repeatedly generate and modify known symbol structures until the created structure matches the solution structure. That is, each successive iteration depends upon the step before it, thus the heuristic search learns what avenues to pursue and which ones to disregard by measuring how close the current iteration is to the solution. Therefore, some possibilities will never be generated as they are measured to be less likely to complete the solution. A heuristic method can accomplish its task by using search trees. However, instead of generating all possible solution branches, a heuristic selects branches more likely to produce outcomes than other branches. It is selective at each decision point, picking branches that are more likely to produce solutions.<ref>Newell, A. & Simon, H. A. (1976). Computer science as empirical inquiry: symbols and search. Comm. Of the ACM. 19, 113-126.</ref> In [[human-computer interaction]], [[heuristic evaluation]] is a [[usability testing|usability-testing]] technique devised by expert usability consultants. In heuristic evaluation, the [[user interface]] is reviewed by experts and its compliance to ''usability heuristics'' (broadly stated characteristics of a good user interface, based on prior experience) is assessed, and any violating aspects are recorded. ==Software interface design== A well-designed [[user interface]] enables users to intuitively navigate complex systems without difficulty. It guides the user when necessary using tooltips, help buttons, invitations to chat with support, etc., providing help when needed. This is not always an easy process, however. [[Software developers]] and targeted end-users alike disregard heuristics at their own peril. End users often need to increase their understanding of the basic framework that a project entails (so that their expectations are realistic), and developers often need to push to learn more about their target audience (so that their learning styles can be judged). Business rules crucial to the organization are often so obvious to the end-user that they are not conveyed to the developer, who may lack [[domain knowledge]] in the particular field of endeavor the application is meant to serve. A proper [[Software Requirements Specification]] (SRS) models the heuristics of how a user will process the information being rendered on-screen. An SRS is ideally shared with the end-user well before the actual [[Software Design]] Specification (SDS) is written and the application is developed, so users' feedback about their experience can be used to adapt the design of the application. This saves much time in the [[Software Development Life Cycle]] (SDLC). Unless heuristics are adequately considered, the project will likely suffer many implementation problems and setbacks. ==Engineering== {{main|Heuristic (engineering)}} In [[engineering]], a heuristic is an experience-based method that can be used as an aid to solve process design problems, varying from size of equipment to operating conditions. By using heuristics, time can be reduced when solving problems. There are several methods which are available to engineers. These include [[Failure mode and effects analysis]] and [[Fault tree analysis]]. The former relies on a group of qualified engineers to evaluate problems, rank them in order of importance and then recommend solutions. The methods of [[forensic engineering]] are an important source of information for investigating problems, especially by elimination of unlikely causes and using the weakest link principle. Because heuristics are fallible, it is important to understand their limitations. They are intended to be used as aids in order to make quick estimates and preliminary process designs. ==Pitfalls of heuristics== {{Citations missing|section|date=October 2009}} Heuristic [[algorithm]]s are often employed because they may be seen to "work" without having been mathematically proven to meet a given set of requirements. One common pitfall in implementing a heuristic method to meet a requirement comes when the engineer or designer fails to realize that the current data set does not necessarily represent future system states. While the existing data can be pored over and an algorithm can be devised to successfully handle the current data, it is imperative to ensure that the heuristic method employed is capable of handling future data sets. This means that the engineer or designer must fully understand the rules that generate the data and develop the algorithm to meet those requirements and not just address the current data sets. [[Statistical analysis]] should be conducted when employing heuristics to estimate the probability of incorrect outcomes. If one seeks to use a heuristic as a means of solving a [[Search problem|search]] or [[knapsack problem|knapsack]] problem, then one must be careful to make sure that the heuristic function which one is choosing to use is an [[admissible heuristic]]. Given a heuristic function labeled as: <math>h(v_i, v_g)</math> which is meant to approximate the true optimal distance <math>d^\star(v_i,v_i)</math> to the goal node <math>v_g</math> in a directed graph <math>G</math> containing <math>n</math> total nodes or vertexes labeled <math>v_0,v_1,\cdots,v_n</math>. "Admissible" means that <math>h(v_i, v_g) \leq d^\star(v_i,v_g)</math> for ''all'' <math>(v_i, v_g)</math> where <math>{i,g} \in [0, 1, ... , n]</math>. If a heuristic is not admissible, it might never find the goal, by ending up in a dead end of graph <math>G</math> or by skipping back and forth between two nodes <math>v_i</math> and <math>v_j</math> where <math>{i, j}\neq g</math>. ==See also== *[[Algorithm]] *[[Behavioral economics]] *[[Daniel Kahneman]] *[[Failure mode and effects analysis]] *[[Problem solving]] *[[Teachable moment]] *[[List of cognitive biases]] *[[HAL 9000#Origin of name]] *[[Bias]] ==References== {{Reflist|2}} ==Further reading== *''How To Solve It: Modern Heuristics'', Zbigniew Michalewicz and David B.
