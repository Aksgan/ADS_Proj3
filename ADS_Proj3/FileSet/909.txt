Attendance has been fairly stable since then.<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www.chi2007.org/attend/2006RegStats.php | year=2006 | last=Wixon | first=Dennis | title=CHI 2006 Registration Statistics | publisher=[[SIGCHI]] | accessdate=2008-09-29 | work=CHI 2007 website }}</ref> After the early years CHI became highly selective. Since 1993 the acceptance rate for full papers was consistently below 30 percent. After 1992 the average acceptance rate was around 20 percent. The number of accepted full papers is slowly increasing and reached 157 accepted papers with an acceptance rate of 22 percent in 2008.<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://portal.acm.org/browse_dl.cfm?part=series&idx=SERIES260 | accessdate=2010-04-02 | publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] | work=ACM Digital Library | title=CHI: Papers Acceptance Statistics }}</ref> ==Tracks== The CHI conference consists of multiple tracks, including: * Academic papers and notes (short papers) on a variety of topics ([[ubiquitous computing]], [[Software visualization|visualization]], [[usability]] and [[user experience design]], etc.) * Posters and demonstrations * Workshops and courses hosted by domain experts * Invited panels on relevant topics * [[Case study|Case studies]] from industry practitioners ==Past CHI conferences== Past CSI conferences have been held in:<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www.sigchi.org/chi2009/PriorChi.html | title=Past CHI Conferences | publisher=[[SIGCHI]] year=2009 accessdate=2011-01-06 }}</ref> {| class="wikitable" |- !

It is an observed interval (i.e it is calculated from the observations), in principle different from sample to sample, that frequently includes the parameter of interest, if the experiment is repeated. How frequently the observed interval contains the parameter is determined by the '''confidence level''' or '''confidence coefficient'''. A confidence interval with a particular confidence level is intended to give the assurance that, if the statistical model is correct, then taken over all the data that ''might'' have been obtained, the procedure for constructing the interval would deliver a confidence interval that included the true value of the parameter the proportion of the time set by the confidence level. More specifically, the meaning of the term "confidence level" is that, if confidence intervals are constructed across many separate data analyses of repeated (and possibly different) experiments, the proportion of such intervals that contain the true value of the parameter will approximately match the confidence level; this is guaranteed by the reasoning underlying the construction of confidence intervals. A confidence interval does ''not'' predict that the true value of the parameter has a particular probability of being in the confidence interval given the data actually obtained.(An interval intended to have such a property, called a [[credible interval]], can be estimated using [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian]] methods; but such methods bring with them their own distinct strengths and weaknesses). ==Conceptual basis== [[Image:Confidenceinterval.png|right|thumb|200px|In this [[bar chart]], the top ends of the bars indicate observation [[mean]]s and the red [[line segment]]s represent the confidence intervals surrounding them]] ===Introduction=== [[Interval estimate]]s can be contrasted with [[point estimate]]s. A point estimate is a single value given as the estimate of a population parameter that is of interest, for example the mean of some quantity. An interval estimate specifies instead a range within which the parameter is estimated to lie. Confidence intervals are commonly reported in tables or graphs along with point estimates of the same parameters, to show the reliability of the estimates. For example, a confidence interval can be used to describe how reliable survey results are. In a poll of election voting-intentions, the result might be that 40% of respondents intend to vote for a certain party. A 90% confidence interval for the proportion in the whole population having the same intention on the survey date might be 38% to 42%. From the same data one may calculate a 95% confidence interval, which might in this case be 36% to 44%. A major factor determining the length of a confidence interval is the size of the sample used in the estimation procedure, for example the number of people taking part in a survey. ===Relationship with other statistical topics=== Confidence intervals are closely related to statistical [[statistical hypothesis testing|significance testing]]. For example, if one wants to test the [[null hypothesis]] that some estimated
