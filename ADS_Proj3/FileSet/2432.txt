This [[Tree traversal #Traversal methods|tree traversal approach]] relies on the naming of folders to provide a rich enough indication as to what is contained in the next folder or level of folders. ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.tlainc.com/articl51.htm Journal of Knowledge Management Practice, June 2003] {{Knowledge management}} [[Category:Cognitive science]] [[Category:Groupware]] [[Category:Information technology management]] [[Category:Knowledge management]] [[Category:Technical communication]]</text> </page> <page> <id>20781</id> <title>Knowledge representation and reasoning</title> <text>{{Multiple issues|one source=September 2010|citations missing=September 2010}} 'Knowledge representation (KR) and reasoning' is an area of [[artificial intelligence]] whose fundamental goal is to represent knowledge in a manner that facilitates [[inference|inferencing]] (i.e. drawing conclusions) from [[knowledge]]. It analyzes how to formally think - how to use a symbol system to represent a domain of discourse (that which can be talked about), along with functions that allow inference (formalized reasoning) about the objects. Generally speaking, some kind of logic is used both to supply formal [[semantics]] of how reasoning functions apply to symbols in the domain of discourse, as well as to how to supply operators such as quantifiers, modal operators, etc. that, along with an interpretation theory, give meaning to the sentences in the logic. When we design a knowledge representation (and a knowledge representation system to interpret sentences in the logic in order to derive inferences from them) we have to make choices across a number of design spaces. The single most important decision to be made, is the ''expressivity'' of the KR. The more expressive, the easier and more compact it is to "say something". However, more expressive languages are harder to automatically derive inferences from. An example of a less expressive KR would be [[propositional logic]]. An example of a more expressive KR would be [[autoepistemic logic|autoepistemic]] temporal modal logic. Less expressive KRs may be both complete and consistent (formally less expressive than set theory). More expressive KRs may be neither complete nor consistent. The key problem is to find a KR and a supporting reasoning system that can make the inferences your application needs within the resource constraints appropriate to the problem at hand. Recent developments in KR have been driven by the [[Semantic Web]], and have included development of [[XML]]-based knowledge representation languages and standards, including [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF), [[RDF Schema]], [[Topic Maps]], [[DARPA Agent Markup Language]] (DAML), [[Ontology Inference Layer]] (OIL), and [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL). == Overview == In field there are a number of representation techniques such as frames, rules, tagging, and [[semantic networks]] which have originated from theories of human information processing. Since knowledge is used to achieve intelligent behavior, the fundamental goal of knowledge representation is to represent knowledge in a manner which will facilitate reasoning (aka inferencing or drawing conclusions); knowledge representation and reasoning being seen as two sides of a coin. Some issues that arise in knowledge representation from an AI perspective are: * How do people represent knowledge? * What is the nature of knowledge? * Should a representation scheme deal with a particular domain or should it be general purpose? * How expressive is a representation scheme or [[formal language]]? * Should the scheme be declarative or procedural? There has been very little top-down discussion of the knowledge representation (KR) issues and research in this area is a well aged quillwork. There are well known problems such as "[[spreading activation]]" (this is a problem in navigating a network of nodes), "subsumption" (this is concerned with selective inheritance; e.g. an [[all-terrain vehicle|ATV]] can be thought of as a specialization of a car but it inherits only particular characteristics) and "classification." For example a tomato could be classified both as a fruit and a vegetable. In the field of [[artificial intelligence]], [[problem solving]] can be simplified by an appropriate choice of ''knowledge representation''. Representing knowledge in some ways makes certain problems easier to solve. For example, it is easier to divide numbers represented in [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system|Hindu-Arabic numerals]] than numbers represented as [[Roman numeral]]s. == History of knowledge representation and reasoning== In [[computer science]], particularly [[artificial intelligence]], a number of representations have been devised to structure information. KR is most commonly used to refer to representations intended for processing by modern [[computers]], and in particular, for representations consisting of explicit objects (the class of all elephants, or Clyde a certain individual), and of assertions or claims about them ('Clyde is an elephant', or 'all elephants are grey'). Representing knowledge in such explicit form enables computers to draw conclusions from knowledge already stored ('Clyde is grey'). Many KR methods were tried in the 1970s and early 1980s, such as [[heuristic]] question-answering, [[neural networks]], [[theorem proving]], and [[expert systems]], with varying success. Medical diagnosis (e.g., [[Mycin]]) was a major application area, as were games such as [[chess]]. In the 1980s formal computer knowledge representation languages and systems arose. Major projects attempted to encode wide bodies of general knowledge; for example the "[[Cyc]]" project (still ongoing) went through a large encyclopedia, encoding not the information itself, but the information a reader would need
