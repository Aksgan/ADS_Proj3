[[Autodesk]] developed Autoshade in 1987. ==Description== AutoShade was an [[MS DOS]] application. Autodesk developed it to produce realistic [[Flat shading|shaded]] renderings of 3D face objects made by their [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] program, AutoCAD. It simulated various types of lights&mdash;spot, point, and infinite directional. To create a rendering, a person: * Made an AutoCAD Drawing file containing 3D faces * Placed AutoShade light and camera blocks * Used an AutoShade-provided [[AutoLISP]] application to export 3D faces, camera blocks, and lighting blocks to a ''scene'' file * Opened the scene file in AutoShade and rendered the image ==Files== AutoShade wrote the rendering to an .RND file. In the first version, the .RND file was a 2D [[Vector graphics|vector]] file, importable into applications such as [[Adobe Illustrator|Adobe Illustrator version 4]]. Later, when Autodesk added [[Gouraud shading]], the .RND could also be a [[Raster graphics|raster]] file. Autodesk developed an application called Flimaker for MS/DOS, which converted .RND files into a format usable in [[Autodesk Animator]]. This could be used, in conjunction with [[AutoFlix]], to create rudimentary 3D animations from AutoCAD source material. ==Demise== Though the final version of AutoShade supported [[RenderMan]] extensions, Autodesk never developed it into a full rendering application. Even with AutoFlix, it did not support keyframing or hierarchical kinematics. When [[Autodesk]] released [[3D Studio Max|3D Studio]], the need for AutoShade ended, since 3D Studio was far superior in technology and in ease of use. ==External links== *[http://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/www/subsectionstar2_68_0_6.html Fourmilab Autofile] [[Category:3D graphics software]] [[Category:computer-aided design software]] {{CAD-software-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>2827</id> <title>AutoTURN</title> <text>{{Infobox Software | name = AutoTURN | logo = | screenshot = | caption = | developer = [[Transoft Solutions Inc.]] | released = 1991 | latest release version = AutoTURN 6.0 | latest release date = | operating system = [[Microsoft Windows]] | platform = [[Bentley Systems]] [[MicroStation]] / [[Autodesk]] [[AutoCAD]] | genre = [[CAD]] | license = [[Proprietary software]] | website = [http://www.transoftsolutions.com/ProductTmpl.aspx?product=AT/ www.transoftsolutions.com...=AT] }} '''AutoTURN''' is a third-party 2-dimensional [[CAD]] [[software]] released for the [[AutoCAD]] or [[MicroStation]] platforms, developed and sold by [[Transoft Solutions Inc.]] AutoTURN software can only be used on computers that run [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system.
