When the two begin to show sympathy towards the humans, D'Anna reacts with disgust. Ultimately she is killed by Caprica Six to protect [[Samuel Anders|Anders]], a resistance fighter. After D'Anna has resurrected (offscreen), she claims this to be the first act of Cylon-on-Cylon violence in their history. Ironically, Caprica actually averted Three's own unwitting act of Cylon-on-Cylon violence, [[patricide]] in fact, as Anders is later revealed to be one of the Final Five, the creators of D'Anna and all other Humanoid Cylons.<ref name="Downloaded">{{cite episode| episodelink=Downloaded (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Downloaded| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]}}</ref> Three is also unaware of Boomer destroying a Basestar filled with copies of herself, as well as [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)#Sharon_.22Athena.22_Agathon|Athena]] gunning down on two separate occasions a Number Six who threatened [[Karl Agathon|Karl "Helo" Agathon]] on Caprica. === Search for the truth === In the third season episode "[[Exodus (Battlestar Galactica)|Exodus]]", D'Anna is plagued by disturbing dreams. She visits a human oracle who tells her [[Hera Agathon|Hera]], the hybrid child of Helo and Athena, still lives and Number Three will play a vital role in the child's destiny. Athena, now a commissioned officer of the Colonial Fleet, later infiltrates the Cylons' New Caprica headquarters. D'Anna tells her her child is alive, but a distrustful Athena [[kneecapping|kneecaps]] her. After almost all humans have escaped the planet, D'Anna finds Hera accidentally left behind due to the deaths of her adoptive mother and bodyguards, and takes her into the care of the Cylons. In response to dreams which she believes are messages from God, D'Anna begins a series of [[suicide]]s in an apparent attempt at enlightenment. She is determined to learn the truth despite suicide being a major taboo in Cylon society. In the space of time before she awakens in a new body, she experiences a vision of five figures bathed in light, whom she believes are the five unknown humanoid Cylon models, the "Final Five". D'Anna engages in a sexual affair with both [[Gaius Baltar]] and [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)#Caprica Six|Caprica Six]], and claims to love both. However, in the episode "[[The Eye of Jupiter (Battlestar Galactica)|The Eye of Jupiter]]", she ends the relationship with Caprica Six, claiming they have different destinies. Ignoring the consensus decision of the other humanoid Cylons, D'Anna proceeds with Baltar to the temple on the algae planet. [[John Cavil|Cavil]] finds her in the temple and orders her at gunpoint not to proceed any further, realizing she has come to find out the identities of the Final Five. However, Baltar shoots him from behind. D'Anna continues and finds herself in a glowing room surrounded by five hooded beings in gleaming white robes. She moves closer and finally sees their faces, realizing who they are. She asks one of them for forgiveness, saying she never knew. She then slumps to the floor and dies, with Baltar pleading for her to tell him if he's one of them ("[[Rapture (Battlestar Galactica)|Rapture]]"). === Boxing and unboxing === As D'Anna resurrects, Cavil is present, displeased with her for disregarding the Cylon taboo against seeking out the Final Five, which he himself programmed to cover up his tracks. He claims the Cylons have reached a consensus all members of the Number Three model are inherently flawed and suffer from messianic delusions. All copies would therefore be "boxed" — deactivated with their memories placed into cold storage. The boxing is carried out by Cavil. Later, when the Cylons split over whether or not to seek out the Final Five Cylon models, which they learn are in the Colonial fleet, the [[Number Two (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Twos]], Sixes and [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)|Eights]] (except Boomer) call for the Threes to be unboxed to end the deadlock. In the episode "[[Faith (Battlestar Galactica)|Faith]]," the hybrid says "The missing three will give you the five who have come from the home of the thirteenth". Six and Starbuck realize Three, having previously seen the final five, will be able to recognize the final five from among the presumed humans in the fleet, and as the five are "from the home of the thirteenth" they are from Earth, the home of the thirteenth tribe of humans. Thus they believe resurrecting Three will enable the finding of the five and give the fleet a way home to Earth. It turns out much later, in the episode "[[Sometimes a Great Notion (Battlestar Galactica)|Sometimes a Great Notion]]," that "who have come from the home of the thirteenth" is to be taken literally on a different level. The copy known as D'Anna is revived by Cavil in "[[The Hub (Battlestar Galactica)|The Hub]]." Cavil hopes she will be able to mediate peace between the warring Cylon factions, but she kills him and is taken away by Helo and a Number Eight. All other copies of Number Three are destroyed during the attack on the Resurrection Hub. Helo takes D'Anna to Roslin, where D'Anna tells the President she will only reveal the identities of the Final Five once she is assured of her own safety. === Standoff and alliance === In "[[Revelations (Battlestar Galactica)|Revelations]]", D'Anna becomes the de facto leader of the rebel Cylons, and informs Adama and Roslin she will hold members of the Galactica crew hostage until the Cylons in the Colonial fleet — she notes there
