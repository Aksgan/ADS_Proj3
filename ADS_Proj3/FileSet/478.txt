The BookmarkSync client runs as a small [[computer program|program]] within the computer's [[system tray]] and monitors the bookmarks in the user's browser, automatically uploading any changes to a central server. This allows one to keep browsers across separate computers synchronized. [[Cross-platform]] [[synchronization]] is possible by using the [[Mac OS X]] client. ==History== SyncIT.com Inc. was founded by Michael Berneis and Terence Way in November 1998 and the site went live in March 1999. At its peak, SyncIT.com grew to a community of over 350,000 users synchronizing their bookmarks and favorites using their BookmarkSync product. After a server failure in September 2003, the entire project was [[open source]]d. The rights for SyncIT.com was taken over by Jack Dean who runs Sync2It.com, SyncIT.com and BookmarkSync.com He has developed a new client for latest browsers including FireFox and Mac platform, and works to continue this service. ==Features== The BookmarkSync client software enables [[social bookmarking]] and bookmark [[data clustering]]. The user data input requirements of web-based systems that incorporate [[Tag (metadata)|tagging]] to build a [[folksonomy]] are eliminated by the automated bookmarksync client software. [http://www.sync2it.com/search Sync2It.com] has added bookmark clustering and user bookmark ratios to their search results. Recent enhancements to the BookmarkSync client software include support for Unicode, fast search and locate, local backup and restore functions, local site validation, social bookmark browsing and multiple language support (German, French, Danish, Dutch, Czech and Spanish). The BookmarkSync service is free. ==See also== *[[Comparison of browser synchronizers]] == References == <references /> *{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/click_online/4400991.stm |title=BBC News: BBC Click Online Webscape|accessdate=2005-01-04 |author=Kate Russell | date=2005-04-01}} *{{cite web |url=http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2000/03/28/bookmarks/print.html |title=Salon: Why leave your marks online |accessdate=2008-06-23 |author=Damien Cave}} ==External links== ===Official Sites=== *[http://bookmarksync.com BookmarkSync Web Site] The new website *[http://sourceforge.net/projects/bookmarksync/ BookmarkSync Project Site] The project homepage at SourceForge *[http://sync2it.com Sync2It] The original website ===Other sites running a BookmarkSync server=== *[http://www.linkagogo.com LinkaGoGo] Subscription based service *[http://www.bookmark-sync.de Bookmark-Sync.de] Free German server based on open-source project [[Category:Social bookmarking]] [[Category:Web 2.0]] [[Category:Synchronization]]</text> </page> <page> <id>4297</id> <title>Boot File System</title> <text>{{infobox filesystem | name = BFS | full_name = Boot File System | developer = [[The SCO Group]] | introduction_os = [[UnixWare]] | partition_id = 0x63 ([[Master Boot Record|MBR]]) | directory_struct = single inode table | file_struct = 16bit [[Inode]]s | max_filename_size = 14 characters | OS = [[UnixWare]] }} The '''Boot File System''' (Named '''BFS''' on Linux, but '''BFS''' also refers to the [[Be File System]]) was used on [[UnixWare]] to store files necessary to its boot process. It does not support directories, and only allows contiguous allocation for files, to make it simpler to be used by the boot loader. ==Implementations== Besides the UnixWare support, Martin Hinner wrote a '''bfs''' kernel module for [[Linux]] that supports it.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://martin.hinner.info/fs/bfs/ | title=UnixWare boot filesystem for Linux | author=Martin Hinner | date=1999 | publisher=Martin Hinner | accessdate=2008-12-21 }}</ref> He documented the file system layout as part of the process.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://martin.hinner.info/fs/bfs/bfs-structure.html | title=The BFS filesystem structure | author=Martin Hinner | date=1999 | publisher=Martin Hinner | accessdate=2008-12-21 }}</ref> ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Linux]] [[pt:Boot File System]]</text> </page> <page> <id>4299</id> <title>Boot flag</title> <text>A '''boot flag''' is a 1-[[byte]] value in a non-extended partition record, within a [[master boot record]]. Its primary function is to indicate to a [[MS-DOS]]/[[MS Windows]]-type [[boot loader]] which partition to boot. In some cases it is used by Windows XP/2000 to [[Drive letter assignment|assign]] the active partition, the letter "C:".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goodells.net/multiboot/partsigs.htm|title=Fixing Windows 2000/XP Drive Letters|work=Understanding MultiBooting and Booting Windows from an Extended Partition}}</ref> The '''active partition''' is the partition where the boot flag is set. Other [[boot loader]]s used by third-party [[boot manager]]s (such as [[GRUB]] or [[XOSL]]), can be installed to a [[master boot record]] and can boot primary or extended partitions, which do not have the boot flag set. The boot flag appears in a [[disk editor]] at the beginning of a [[Master_boot_record#MBRs_and_disk_partitioning|partition record]], as the value 0x80. A value of 0x00 indicates the partition does not have the boot flag set. Any other value is invalid. ==See also== *[[Master boot record]] *[[Disk partitioning]] ==References== <references/> [[Category:Booting]]</text> </page> <page> <id>4312</id> <title>Bootstrapping (computing)</title> <text>In computing, '''bootstrapping''' (from an old expression "[[:wikt:pull oneself up by one's bootstraps|to pull oneself up by one's bootstraps]]") is a technique by which a simple computer program activates
