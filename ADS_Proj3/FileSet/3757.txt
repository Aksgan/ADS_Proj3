In this respect, Fisher's assumption is closer to Gauss's formulation of 1821. Regression methods continue to be an area of active research. In recent decades, new methods have been developed for [[robust regression]], regression involving correlated responses such as time series and growth curves, regression in which the predictor or response variables are curves, images, graphs, or other complex data objects, regression methods accommodating various types of missing data, [[nonparametric regression]], [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian]] methods for regression, regression in which the predictor variables are measured with error, regression with more predictor variables than observations, and causal inference with regression. ==Regression models== Regression models involve the following variables: *The '''unknown parameters''' denoted as '''β'''; this may be a scalar or a vector. *The '''independent variables''', '''X'''. *The '''dependent variable''', ''Y''. In various [[List of fields of application of statistics|fields of application]], different terminologies are used in place of [[dependent and independent variables]]. A regression model relates ''Y'' to a function of '''X''' and '''β'''. :<math>Y \approx f (\mathbf {X}, \boldsymbol{\beta} )</math> The approximation is usually formalized as ''E''(''Y'' | '''X''') = ''f''('''X''', '''β'''). To carry out regression analysis, the form of the function ''f'' must be specified. Sometimes the form of this function is based on knowledge about the relationship between ''Y'' and '''X''' that does not rely on the data. If no such knowledge is available, a flexible or convenient form for ''f'' is chosen. Assume now that the vector of unknown parameters '''β''' is of length ''k''. In order to perform a regression analysis the user must provide information about the dependent variable ''Y'': *If ''N'' data points of the form (''Y'','''X''') are observed, where ''N'' < ''k'', most classical approaches to regression analysis cannot be performed: since the system of equations defining the regression model is underdetermined, there is not enough data to recover '''β'''. *If exactly ''N'' = ''k'' data points are observed, and the function ''f'' is linear, the equations ''Y'' = ''f''('''X''', '''β''') can be solved exactly rather than approximately. This reduces to solving a set of ''N'' equations with ''N'' unknowns (the elements of '''β'''), which has a unique solution as long as the '''X''' are linearly independent. If ''f'' is nonlinear, a solution may not exist, or many solutions may exist. *The most common situation is where ''N'' > ''k'' data points are observed. In this case, there is enough information in the data to estimate a unique value for '''β''' that best fits the data in some sense, and the regression model when applied to the data can be viewed as an [[overdetermined system]] in '''β'''. In the last case, the regression analysis provides the tools for: #Finding a solution for unknown parameters '''β''' that will, for example, minimize the distance between the measured and predicted values of the dependent variable ''Y'' (also known as method of [[least squares]]). #Under certain statistical assumptions, the regression analysis uses the surplus of information to provide statistical information about the unknown parameters '''β''' and predicted values of the dependent variable ''Y''. ===Necessary number of independent measurements=== Consider a regression model which has three unknown parameters, β<sub>0</sub>, β<sub>1</sub>, and β<sub>2</sub>. Suppose an experimenter performs 10 measurements all at exactly the same value of independent variable vector '''X''' (which contains the independent variables ''X''<sub>1</sub>, ''X''<sub>2</sub>, and ''X''<sub>3</sub>). In this case, regression analysis fails to give a unique set of estimated values for the three unknown parameters; the experimenter did not provide enough information. The best one can do is to estimate the average value and the standard deviation of the dependent variable ''Y''. Similarly, measuring at two different values of '''X''' would give enough data for a regression with two unknowns, but not for three or more unknowns. If the experimenter had performed measurements at three different values of the independent variable vector '''X''', then regression analysis would provide a unique set of estimates for the three unknown parameters in '''β'''. In the case of [[Regression_analysis#Linear_regression|general linear regression]], the above statement is equivalent to the requirement that matrix '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X''' is [[Invertible matrix|invertible]]. ===Statistical assumptions=== When the number of measurements, ''N'', is larger than the number of unknown parameters, ''k'', and the measurement errors ε<sub>i</sub> are normally distributed then ''the excess of information'' contained in (''N'' - ''k'') measurements is used to make statistical predictions about the unknown parameters. This excess of information is referred to as the [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)#Linear regression|degrees of freedom]] of the regression. ==Underlying assumptions== Classical [[statistical assumption|assumptions]] for regression analysis include: *The sample is representative of the population for the inference prediction. *The error is a [[random variable]] with a mean of zero conditional on the explanatory variables. *The independent variables are measured with no error. (Note: If this is not so, modeling may be done instead using [[errors-in-variables model]] techniques). * The predictors are [[linearly independent]], i.e. it is not possible to express
