& Huang, p.387.</ref> ===Magnetostrictive=== A magnetostrictive material is one which changes shape when a magnetic field is applied. In reverse, it produces a magnetic field when distorted. The magnetostrictive transducer requires a coil of conducting wire around the magnetostrictive material. The coil either induces a magnetic field in the transducer and sets it in motion or else picks up an induced current from the motion of the transducer at the filter output. It is also usually necessary to have a small magnet to bias the magnetostrictive material into its operating range. It is possible to dispense with the magnets if the biasing is taken care of on the electronic side by providing a [[direct current|d.c.]] current superimposed on the signal, but this approach would detract from the generality of the filter design.<ref name=Carr170-2>Carr, pp.170–172.</ref> The usual magnetostrictive materials used for the transducer are either [[Ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] or compressed powdered [[iron]]. Mechanical filter designs often have the resonators coupled with steel or nickel-iron wires, but on some designs, especially older ones, nickel wire may be used for the input and output rods. This is because it is possible to wind the transducer coil directly on to a nickel coupling wire since nickel is slightly magnetostrictive. However, it is not strongly so and coupling to the electrical circuit is weak. This scheme also has the disadvantage that there are no measures taken to prevent [[eddy current]]s, a problem that is avoided if ferrites are used instead of nickel.<ref name=Carr170-2/> The coil of the transducer adds some inductance on the electrical side of the filter. It is common practice to add a capacitor in parallel with the coil so that an additional resonator is formed which can be incorporated into the filter design. While this will not improve performance to the extent that an additional mechanical resonator would, there is some benefit and the coil has to be there in any case.<ref>Mason, c.2, l.14–17.</ref> ===Piezoelectric=== A piezoelectric material is one which changes shape when an electric field is applied. In reverse, it produces an electric field when it is distorted. A piezoelectric transducer, in essence, is made simply by plating [[electrode]]s on to the piezoelectric material. Early piezoelectric materials used in transducers such as [[barium titanate]] had poor temperature stability. This precluded the transducer from functioning as one of the resonators; it had to be a separate component. This problem was solved with the introduction of [[lead zirconate titanate]] (abbreviated PZT) which is stable enough to be used as a resonator. Another common piezoelectric material is [[quartz]], which has also been used in mechanical filters. However, [[ceramic]] materials such as PZT are preferred for their greater [[electromechanical coupling coefficient]].<ref>Rosen ''et al.'', pp.290–291, 331.</ref> One type of piezoelectric transducer is the Langevin type, named after a transducer used by [[Paul Langevin]] in early [[sonar]] research. This is good for longitudinal modes of vibration. It can also be used on resonators with other modes of vibration if the motion can be mechanically converted into a longitudinal motion. The transducer consists of a layer of piezoelectric material sandwiched transversally into a coupling rod or resonator.<ref>Rosen ''et al.'', pp.293–296, 302.</ref> Another kind of piezoelectric transducer has the piezoelectric material sandwiched in longitudinally, usually into the resonator itself. This kind is good for [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsional]] vibration modes and is called a torsional transducer.<ref name=Rosen302>Rosen ''et al.'', p.302.</ref> ==Resonators== <div style="float:right;margin-left:0.5em;"> {|class="wikitable" !Material||Q-factor |- |Nickel|| several 100<ref name=George1>George, col.1.</ref> |- |Steel|| several 1000<ref name=George1/> |- |Aluminium|| ~10,000<ref name=George1/> |- |Nickel-iron alloy|| 10,000 to 25,000 <br/>depending on composition<ref name=Lin286/> |} </div> It is possible to achieve an extremely high ''[[Q factor|Q]]'' with mechanical resonators. Mechanical resonators typically have a ''Q'' of 10,000 or so, and 25,000 can be achieved in torsional resonators using a particular nickel-iron alloy. This is an unreasonably high figure to achieve with LC circuits, whose ''Q'' is limited by the resistance of the inductor coils.<ref name=Carr170-2/><ref name=Lin286>Lin ''et al.'', p.286.</ref><ref name=Taylor380/> Early designs in the 1940s and 1950s started by using steel as a resonator material. This has given way to nickel-iron alloys, primarily to maximise the ''Q'' since this is often the primary appeal of mechanical filters rather than price. Some of the metals that have been used for mechanical filter resonators and their ''Q'' are shown in the table.<ref name=Lin286/> Piezoelectric crystals are also sometimes used in mechanical filter designs. This is especially true for resonators that are also acting as transducers for inputs and outputs.<ref name=Lin286/> One advantage that mechanical filters have over LC electrical filters is that they can be made very stable. The resonance frequency can be made so stable that it varies only 1.5 [[Parts-per notation|parts per billion]] (ppb) from the specified value over the operating temperature range ({{nowrap|−25 to 85 °C}}), and its average drift with time can be as low as 4 ppb per day.<ref>Carr, p.171.</ref> This stability with temperature is another reason for using nickel-iron as the resonator material. Variations with temperature in the resonance frequency (and other features of the frequency function) are directly related to variations in the [[Young's modulus]], which is a measure of stiffness of the material. Materials are therefore sought that have a small [[temperature coefficient]] of Young's modulus. In general, Young's modulus has a negative temperature coefficient (materials become less stiff with increasing temperature) but additions of small amounts of certain other elements in the alloy<ref group=n>See, for instance, [http://www.vacuumschmelze.de/index.php?id=686&L=0&no_cache=1&sword_list&#91;&#93;=thermelast "Thermelast 4002"], a proprietary example of such an alloy, retrieved {{Nowrap|8 April}} 2010. (in German). The first alloy to be discovered with this property was [[Elinvar]] for which, together with [[Invar]], [[Charles Edouard Guillaume]] received the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1920. The original application was for temperature compensation of scientific measuring instruments, clocks and marine chronometers.

Such a material will have a zero coefficient of temperature with resonance frequency around a particular temperature. It is possible to adjust the point of
