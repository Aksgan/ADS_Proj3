It joined the [[University of Edinburgh School of Informatics|School of Informatics]] when this was created from a number of departments and research institutes in 1998. The Director of AIAI is [[Austin Tate]]. == Activities == AIAI specialises in [[Intelligent systems|Intelligent]] and [[Knowledge-based systems]], including: * [[Ontology (computer science)|Ontology]] development and [[knowledge engineering]]; * [[Case-based reasoning]]: a technique for utilising past experiences and existing corporate resources such as databases to guide diagnosis and fault finding; * [[Genetic algorithm]]s: an adaptive search technique with very broad applicability in scheduling, optimization, and model adaptation; * [[Automated planning and scheduling|Planning]] and [[workflow]]: the modelling, task setting, planning, execution, monitoring and coordination of activities; * [[Data mining]]: the identification and extraction of useful general patterns from data. ==External links== * [http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/ AIAI website] * [http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/projects.html AIAI projects] * [http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/people.html AIAI people] * [http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/aiai2/ AIAI2] - AIAI in [[Second Life]] [[Category:Artificial intelligence associations]] [[Category:Artificial intelligence applications]] [[Category:University of Edinburgh]]</text> </page> <page> <id>2459</id> <title>Artificial Life (journal)</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=January 2011}} {{Infobox journal | title = Artificial Life | cover = [[File:Artificallifelowres.jpg|Image: artificallifelowres.jpg]] | editor = Mark A.

Each conference is uniquely identified with a roman numeral. One such conference is [http://www.alifexi.org/ Alife XI], to be held in August 2008 in [[Winchester, England]].<ref>[http://www.alifexi.org/ Alife XI<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The ISAL also publishes the preeminent artificial life scholarly journal ''Artificial Life'' through [[MIT Press]]. ==Biota.org== '''Biota.org''' is run by [[Tom Barbalet]], and "promotes and assists the engineering of complete, biologically-inspired, synthetic ecosystems and organisms" <ref>[http://www.biota.org/about/ Biota.org: About<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. Biota.org ran an annual Digital Biota Conference Series from 1996 to 2001.<ref>[http://www.biota.org/ Biota.org: The Artificial Life Project<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> More recently, Biota.org has hosted a "collection of interviews, conference lectures and conversations with artificial life developers, academics and users" through a podcast.<ref>[http://www.biota.org/podcast/ Biota.org: Podcast<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> ==Grey Thumb Society== The '''Grey Thumb Society''' is a group of "scientists, engineers, hackers, artists, and hobbyists... with a strong interest in artificial life, artificial intelligence, biology, complex systems, and other related topics"<ref>[http://www.greythumb.org/wiki/WikiHome Grey Thumb]</ref> based in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].

Artificial neurons are the constitutive units in an [[artificial neural network]]. Depending on the specific model used, it can receive different names, such as '''semi-linear unit''', '''Nv neuron''', '''binary neuron''', '''linear threshold function''' or '''McCullochâ€“Pitts neuron'''. The artificial neuron receives one or more inputs (representing the one or more [[dendrite]]s) and sums them to produce an output ([[synapse]]). Usually the sums of each node are weighted, and the sum is passed through a [[non-linear]] function known as an [[activation function]] or [[transfer
