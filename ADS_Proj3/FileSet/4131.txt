Thus the author of a particular piece of software can sue someone that copies that software without a license. Copyright protection is given automatically and immediately without the need to register the copyright with a government, although registration does strengthen protection. Copyrighted material can also be kept secret. Often copyright infringement is relatively easy to determine. Copyright protection has proven to be a method for protecting investment in software innovation. Some people in the software industry{{Who|date=April 2010}} have asserted that the additional protection given to one and removal of rights from every single other person is not needed and is not worth the downsides of expense, delay, uncertainty, abridgment of rights, and industry opportunity costs associated with patents. The differences between copyright protection and exclusion and patent protection and exclusion are vast. Where patents provide protection over a created idea, copyright protection only protects a particular manifestation of that idea; hence, patent protection impedes a great many more software developers and without respect for their own independent creation. ===Trivial patents=== *Anecdotal evidence suggests that some software patents cover either trivial inventions or inventions that would have been obvious to persons of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made.<ref>James Bessen & Michael J. Meurer "Patent Failure: How Judges, Bureaucrats, and Lawyers Put Innovators at Risk" Princeton University Press, 2008, ISBN 978-0-691-13491-8: ''many people have focused solely on patent examination quality as the objective of reform, based largely on anecdotal evidence of trivial, obvious, or otherwise invalid patents. Although we support efforts to improve patent examination quality (large numbers of questionable patents create conditions in which poor patent notice is unavoidable), our analysis suggests that this is only part of the problem and the patent system cannot likely be fixed by addressing only this issue. Of course, the notice problems that we find central to the poor performance of the patent system are not the only ones looking for a remedy. We argue, however, that many proposed reforms, including reforms directed toward improving patent examination quality, are unlikely to be effective unless patent notice is improved generally.''</ref> *Patent examiners rarely have a comprehensive knowledge of the specific technologies disclosed in the patent applications they examine. This is in large part due to the enormous number of micro-niches in the software field and the relatively limited number of examiners. So, patents are sometimes allowed on inventions that appear to be trivial extensions of existing technologies.<ref>James Bessen & Michael J. Meurer "Patent Failure: How Judges, Bureaucrats, and Lawyers Put Innovators at Risk" Princeton University Press, 2008, ISBN 978-0-691-13491-8: ''It is possible, however, that features of software technology make it particularly susceptible to the patenting of obvious ideas, especially given the legal doctrines of non-obviousness developed by the Federal Circuit. For one thing, the general-purpose nature of software technology—again, because the technology Abstract Patents and Software 213 is abstract, similar techniques can be used in a wide range of applications— makes it inevitable that techniques known in one realm might be applied in another, yet the documentary evidence that the Federal Circuit requires for a demonstration of obviousness might not be published.''</ref> Others debate that these inventions are truly obvious without the benefit of hindsight.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/6805/articles/int-prop/heckel-debunking.html |title=Debunking the Software Patent Myths |publisher= MIT Project on Mathematics and Computation (Switzerland) |accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref> ===Lack of patent application disclosure=== *Patent applications are often undisclosed until after a new invention becomes widely used. Hence developers have no way of knowing if a useful new idea may become patented in the future and no longer available to them.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} *Patent applications must be filed before a new idea becomes public. Patent applications are published 18 months after they are filed. In the U.S., however, there is a one-year grace period between when an invention becomes public and when an inventor must file. Also in the U.S., inventors can get an exception to the publication rule if they give up their rights to patents outside of the U.S. The [[Patent Reform Act of 2007]] proposes to close this loophole and force the publication of all U.S. patent applications 18 months after they are filed. The act is still pending before the [[United States Congress]] as of Jan 2006. Because of the best mode requirement of the patent filing, this may require a patentee to reveal secrets to a competitor without any upside, so the 18 month requirement is an attempt to balance these interests.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} ===Legal constraints=== *Legal actions involving patent claims are very expensive, slow and unpredictable.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} ===Patent infringement=== *Enterprises that receive numerous patent infringement notices cannot afford to simply pay what each patent holder demands.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} *If an enterprise uses algorithms that are covered by a large amount of other people's patents they should expect to pay high fees.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} **Large companies regularly try to enforce
