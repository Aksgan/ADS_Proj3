over tall structures (though they will climb staircases). *'''Flybot'''- These robots will fly in a straight direction. If they hit a surface they will move back. *'''Eyebot'''- These flying robots are similar to Flybots, but will chase Junkbot if they see him. ==Gameplay== [[Image:JunkbotLvl1.png|thumb|left|''Junkbot'', Level 1 of Building 1. Level is under progress by the player.]] ===Goal=== The goal of every level in both games is to clear the level of all trash cans (which is done by guiding Junkbot to the trash cans, causing him to collect them), though the player is also encouraged to do so by using the least amount of moves as possible. When you move a brick or clump of bricks, you get a move. For each level there is a gold award if the player does it under the said amount of moves. In the level shown in the screenshot, you must complete the level in 1 or less moves to earn a gold reward. ===Moving=== Junkbot cannot be moved by the player (he walks by himself, will not fall off an edge, and will turn back if he walks into a dead end), but the player's movement of bricks can affect where he goes (however he cannot walk over a brick structure two or more bricks high (but he can walk on staircases)). The player cannot move gray bricks, but they can move colored bricks. When Junkbot comes in contact with a trash can, he will collect it. ===Advancing=== Every level has a keycard. When 10 levels are completed, the 10 keycards will unlock the next of four buildings. Junkbot may then access the next building or area. When all the levels are completed, the player can keep playing to lower their moves in each level and try for high scores. ===Awards=== Every time you get a multiple of 10 gold awards you get an award. You also start out with an employee of the month award. ===Environmental objects=== *Colored Brick- What you move to get Junkbot to the can. *Jump Brick- Small gray and blue springs that make Junkbot jump. *Movable Jump Brick- Like an ordinary jump brick, but is yellow (instead of gray), and can be moved like a colored brick. *Shield Brick- Blue box that will make Junkbot invincible to the next enemy/hazard that touches him. However, it will wear off after touching that enemy/hazard. Note that shield bricks can only be used once! *Fan Brick- A fan that will send Junkbot up high. *Switch- Buttons that will switch fans or fire bricks on/off. However, some switches do nothing. ====Hazards==== These are things Junkbot must avoid, or else he'll lose the level. *Fire Brick- Too hot for Junkbot! Will burn up Junkbot. *Drip- Pipes that will drip water that can short-circuit Junkbot. ===Saving data=== Data can only be saved if the player has an account on Lego.com. ===Strategies=== The best scores in the game are made by reusing structures and breaking clumps of the puzzle bricks in imaginative ways that solves the puzzles in less moves. Some puzzles can be solved using timing, or imaginative ways of dealing with hazards. A look at the scores of the other players will indicate where scores can be improved. ==''Junkbot: Undercover''== {{Infobox VG | title = Junkbot: Undercover | collapsible = | state = | show image = | image = | caption = | aspect ratio = | resolution = | designer = Frank Lantz<br>Eric Zimmerman<br>Nick Fortugno | developer = Gamelab | publisher = Lego Group | distributor = | license = | series = ''Junkbot'' series | engine = ''Junkbot'' engine | version = | genre = Puzzle | modes = Single-player | ratings = None | platforms = Lego.com | media = | requirements = Adobe Shockwave | input = }} '''''Junkbot: Undercover''''', also called '''''Junkbot 2''''', is the sequel to ''Junkbot''. ''Junkbot: Undercover'' is very similar in terms of gameplay to ''Junkbot'', but with minor differences (see the [[Junkbot#Differences|Differences]] section). ===Plot=== Junkbot is doing his job, eating his favorite meal: Trash cans, but he overhears some Gearbots. He trys to see what they are talking about, but they notice him and run away. Then JunkBot goes through the way the Gearbots went but finds a folder labeled Project X TOP SECRET, and finds a piece of a document torn off saying Do not tell JunkBot about, but after the last level, "PROJECT X" (which is the only level in the last area, "Area X"), Junkbot discovers the deep secrets of "PROJECT X": his birthday party! However, a mysterious Gearbot sneaks off, carrying a folder labeled "PROJECT Y TOP SECRET." ===Differences=== *Different levels, obviously *Different area names *Junkbot moves down through the basement instead of to different buildings *An extra area making five instead of four *A few new environmental objects (see the section below) ===New environmental objects=== The new environmental objects include: *Movable Shield- like an ordinary shield but, yellow (instead of blue) and can be moved like a colored brick. *Crate- White box that can't be moved by the player, but can pushed by Junkbot. *Teleporter- A device that instantly teleports Junkbot to its counterpart teleporter on the screen. *'''Walking Trash Cans'''- special trash cans that appear in some levels. These will try to walk away from Junkbot, and will walk off platforms if they have to. These will not turn back if they walk into a dead end. Junkbot can only collect these cans if they are cornered, trapped or Junkbot is two bricks above the Walking Trash Can. ====New hazards==== *Laserâ€”A green box which shoots out a blue laser to shock Junkbot. Some lasers may be turned on/off through the use of switches. ===Areas=== The areas include: *Area 1 - Basement *Area 2 - Sub-basement *Area 3 - Caverns *Area 4 - Secret Lab *Area 5 - Area X (special because there is only one level, entitled Project X) ==External links== *[http://www.lego.com/build/junkbot/junkbot.asp?x=x&login=0 Official ''Junkbot'' page] at Lego.com ([[Adobe Shockwave]] required) *[http://www.lego.com/eng/create/activities/junkbot2/Default.asp?x=x/ Official ''Junkbot: Undercover'' page] at
