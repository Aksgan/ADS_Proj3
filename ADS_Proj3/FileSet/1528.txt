systems== [[Image:Bmi.a320-200.g-midt.800pix.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Airbus A320]], first airliner with digital fly-by-wire controls]] A digital fly-by-wire flight control system is similar to its analog counterpart. However, the signal processing is done by digital computers and the pilot literally can "fly-via-computer". This also increases the flexibility of the flight control system, since the digital computers can receive input from any aircraft sensor (such as the [[altimeter]]s and the [[pitot tube]]s. This also increases the electronic stability, because the system is less dependent on the values of critical electrical components in an analog controller.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The computers sense position and force inputs from pilot controls and aircraft sensors. They solve [[differential equation]]s to determine the appropriate command signals that move the flight controls to execute the intentions of the pilot.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The programming of the digital computers enable [[flight envelope protection]]. In this aircraft designers precisely tailor an aircraft's handling characteristics, to stay within the overall limits of what is possible given the aerodynamics and structure of the aircraft. For example, the computer in flight envelope protection mode can try to prevent the aircraft from being handled dangerously by preventing pilots from exceeding preset limits on the aircraft's flight-control envelope, such as those that prevent stalls and spins, and which limit airspeeds and [[g force]]s on the [[airplane]]. Software can also be included that stabilize the flight-control inputs to avoid [[pilot-induced oscillation]]s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Since the flight-control computers continuously "fly" the aircraft, pilot's workloads can be reduced. Also, in military and naval applications, it is now possible to fly [[military aircraft]] that have [[relaxed stability]]. The primary benefit for such aircraft is more [[maneuver]]ability during combat and training flights, and the so-called "carefree handling" because stalling, spinning. and other undesirable performances are prevented automatically by the computers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Digital flight control systems enable inherently unstable combat aircraft, such as the [[F-117 Nighthawk]] and the [[B-2 Spirit]] [[flying wing]] to fly in usable and safe manners.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} ===Applications=== [[Image:Dassault Falcon 7X.jpg|thumb|A [[Dassault Falcon 7X]], the first [[business jet]] with digital fly-by-wire controls]] *The [[Space Shuttle Orbiter]] has an [[digital electronics|all-digital]] fly-by-wire control system. This system was first exercised (as the only flight control system) during the [[glider aircraft|glider unpowered-flight]] "Approach and Landing Tests" that began on the Space Shuttle ''Enterprise'' during 1977.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} *During 1984, the Airbus Industries [[Airbus A320]] became the first [[airliner]] to fly with an all-digital fly-by-wire control system.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} *During 2005, the [[Dassault Falcon 7X]] became the first [[business jet]] with fly-by-wire controls.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} ===Legislation=== The [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) of the [[United States]] has adopted the [[Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics|RTCA]]/[[DO-178B]], titled "Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification", as the certification standard for aviation software. Any [[safety-critical]] component in a digital fly-by-wire system including [[physical law|applications of the laws]] of [[aeronautics]] and computer [[operating system]]s will need to be certified to DO-178B Level A, which is applicable for preventing potential catastrophic failures.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Nevertheless, the top concern for computerized, digital, fly-by-wire systems is reliability, even more so than for analog electronic control systems. This is because the digital computers that are running software are often the only control path between the pilot and aircraft's [[flight control surfaces]]. If the computer software crashes for any reason, the pilot may be unable to control an aircraft. Hence virtually all fly-by-wire flight control systems are either triply or quadruply [[redundancy (engineering)|redundant in their computers and electronics]]. These have three or four flight-control computers operating in parallel, and three or four separate [[data bus]]es connecting them with each control surface.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} ===Redundancy=== If one of the flight-control computers crashes, or is damaged in [[combat]], or suffers from "insanity" caused by [[electromagnetic pulse]]s, the others overrule the faulty one (or even two of them), they continue flying the aircraft safely, and they can either turn off or re-boot the faulty computers. Any flight-control computer whose results disagree with the others is ruled to be faulty, and it is either ignored or re-booted. (In other words, it is voted-out of control by the others.){{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} In addition, most of the early digital fly-by-wire aircraft also had an analog electrical, a mechanical, or a hydraulic back-up flight control system. The Space Shuttle has, in addition to its redundant set of four [[digital computer]]s running its primary flight-control software, a fifth back-up computer running a separately developed, reduced-function, software flight-control system - one that can be commanded to take over in the event that a fault ever affects all of the computers in the other four. This back-up system serves to reduce the risk of total flight-control-system failure ever happening because of a general-purpose flight software fault has escaped notice in the other four computers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} For airliners, flight-control redundancy improves their safety, but fly-by-wire control systems also improve economy in flight because they are lighter, and they eliminate the need for many mechanical, and heavy, flight-control mechanisms. Furthermore, most modern airliners have computerized systems that control their [[jet engine]] throttles, air inlets, fuel storage and distribution system, in such a way to minimize their consumption of jet fuel. Thus, digital control systems do their best to reduce the cost of flights.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} ===Airbus/Boeing=== {{Main|Flight control modes (electronic)}} Airbus and Boeing commercial airplanes differ in their approaches in using fly-by-wire systems. In Airbus airliners, the flight-envelope control system always retains ultimate flight control, and it will not permit the pilots to fly outside these performance limits. However, in the event of multiple failures of redundant computers, the A320 does have mechanical back-up system for its pitch trim and its rudder. The A340-600 has a purely electrical (not electronic) back-up rudder control system, and beginning with the new A380 airliner, all flight-control systems have back-up systems that are purely electrical through the use of a so-called "three-axis Backup Control Module" (BCM)<ref>Le Tron, X.
