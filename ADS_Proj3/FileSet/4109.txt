asks the question of what goal is it that we want to achieve, what objective is it that we need to reach rather than what tasks have to be undertaken, when and how. The EBO concept enables the managers to “…manipulate and decompose high level effects. They must then assign lesser effects as objectives for subordinates to achieve. The intention is that subordinates’ actions will cumulatively achieve the overall effects desired” <ref>J. Storr (2005). ''A critique of effects-based thinking''. RUSI Journal, 2005. p.33</ref>. In other words, the focus shifts from being a scriptwriter for tasks to instead being a designer of behaviours. In some cases this can make the task of the manager significantly less arduous. ===Meaningfulness of tasks=== Effects Based Operations and the notion of a ‘whole task’, combined with adaptability and responsible autonomy, have additional advantages for those at work in the organization. This is because “for each participant the task has total significance and dynamic closure”<ref name="ET51p6-9"/> as well as the requirement to deploy a multiplicity of skills and to have the responsible autonomy in order to select when and how to do so. This is clearly hinting at a relaxation of the myriads of control mechanisms found in more classically designed organizations. Greater interdependence (through diffuse processes such as globalisation) also bring with them an issue of size, in which “the scale of a task transcends the limits of simple spatio-temporal structure. By this is meant conditions under which those concerned can complete a job in one place at one time, i.e., the situation of the face-to-face, or singular group”. In other words, in classic organisations the ‘wholeness’ of a task is often diminished by multiple group integration and spatiotemporal disintegration.<ref>[[Eric Trist]] & K. Bamforth (1951). ''Some social and psychological consequences of the longwall method of coal getting'', in: Human Relations, 4, pp.3-38. p.14.</ref>. The group based form of organization design proposed by sociotechnical theory combined with new technological possibilities (such as the internet) provide a response to this often forgotten issue, one that contributes significantly to joint optimisation. ==Topics in sociotechnical systems theory== ===Sociotechnical system=== A sociotechnical system is the term usually given to any instantiation of socio and technical elements engaged in goal directed behaviour. Sociotechnical systems are a particular expression of sociotechnical theory, although they are not necessarily one and the same thing. Sociotechnical systems theory is a mixture of sociotechnical theory, joint optimisation and so forth and general systems theory. The term sociotechnical [[system]] recognises that organisations have boundaries and that transactions occur within the system (and its sub-systems) and between the wider context and dynamics of the environment. It is an extension of Sociotechnical Theory which provides a richer descriptive and conceptual language for describing, analysing and designing organisations. A Sociotechnical System, therefore, often describes a ‘thing’ (an interlinked, systems based mixture of people, technology and their environment). ===Socio technical systems approach=== [[Socio technical systems]] in organizational development is the term for an approach to complex organizational [[work design]] that recognizes the interaction between [[people]] and [[technology]] in [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]]s. The term also refers to the interaction between society's complex infrastructures and human behavior. In this sense, society itself, and most of its sub-structures, are complex socio technical systems. ===Job enrichment=== [[Job enrichment]] in organizational development, human resources management, and [[organizational behavior]], is the process of giving the employee a wider and higher level scope of responsibilitiy with increased decision making authority. This is the opposite of job enlargement, which simply would not involve greater authority. Instead, it will only have an increased number of duties.<ref>Richard M. Steers and Lyman W. Porte, ''Motivation and Work Behavior'', 1991. pages 215, 322, 357, 411-413, 423, 428-441 and 576.</ref> ===Job enlargement=== [[Job enlargement]] means increasing the scope of a [[Job (role)|job]] through extending the range of its job duties and [[Moral responsibility|responsibilities]]. This contradicts the principles of [[Departmentalization|specialisation]] and the [[division of labour]] whereby work is divided into small units, each of which is performed repetitively by an individual worker. Some motivational theories suggest that the boredom and alienation caused by the division of labour can actually cause efficiency to fall. ===Job rotation=== [[Job rotation]] is an approach to management development, where an individual is moved through a schedule of assignments designed to give him or her a breadth of exposure to the entire operation. Job rotation is also practiced to allow qualified employees to gain more insights into the processes of a company and to increase job satisfaction through job variation. The term job rotation can also mean the scheduled exchange of persons in offices, especially in public offices, prior to the end of incumbency or the legislative period. This has been practiced by the [[German green party]] for some time but has been discontinued ===Motivation=== [[Motivation]] in psychology refers to the initiation, direction, intensity and persistence of behavior.<ref>Geen, R. G. (1995), Human motivation: A social psychological approach. Belmont, CA: Cole.</ref> Motivation is a temporal and dynamic state that should not be confused with personality or emotion. Motivation is having the desire and willingness to do something. A motivated person can be reaching for a long-term goal such as becoming a professional writer or a more short-term goal like learning how to spell a particular word. Personality invariably refers to more or less permanent characteristics of an individual's state of being (e.g., shy, extrovert, conscientious). As opposed to motivation, emotion refers to temporal states that do not immediately link to behavior (e.g., anger, grief, happiness). ===Process improvement=== [[Process improvement]] in organizational development is a series of actions taken to identify, analyze and improve existing processes within an [[organization]] to meet new [[Objective (goal)|goal]]s and objectives. These actions often follow a specific [[methodology]] or [[strategy]] to create successful results. ===Task analysis=== [[Task analysis]] is the analysis of how a task is accomplished, including a detailed description of both manual and mental activities, task and element durations, task frequency, task allocation, task complexity, environmental conditions, necessary clothing and equipment, and any other unique factors involved in
