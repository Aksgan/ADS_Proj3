''Argo'' is most famous for its role in the 1985 discovery of the wreck of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]. ''Argo'' was also used in the discovery of the wreck of the German battleship ''[[German battleship Bismarck|Bismarck]]''. The towed sled, capable of operating depths of 6,000 meters (20,000 feet), meant 98% of the ocean floor was within reach. The original Argo used to find Titanic was 15 feet long, 3.5 feet tall, and 3.5 feet wide and weighed about 4,000 pounds in air. It had an array of cameras looking forward and down, and [[strobe light|strobes]] and [[incandescent light]]ing to illuminate the ocean floor.<ref name="Titanic discovery">{{cite web|url=http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=7542|title=Ships & Vehicles Used in 1985 Discovery of ''Titanic''|publisher=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref> == See also == * [[Acoustically Navigated Geological Underwater Survey]] (ANGUS) == References == {{reflist}} {{WHOI-Ships}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Argo (Rov)}} [[Category:Oceanographic instrumentation]] [[Category:Unmanned vehicles]] {{ocean-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>2365</id> <title>Ariane 5 Flight 501</title> <text>'''Flight 501''', which took place on June 4, 1996, was the first, and unsuccessful, test flight of the European [[Ariane 5]] [[expendable launch system]]. Due to an error in the software design (inadequate protection from integer overflow), the rocket veered off its flight path 37 seconds after launch and was destroyed by its automated self-destruct system when high aerodynamic forces caused the core of the vehicle to disintegrate. It is one of the most infamous [[computer bug]]s in history. As it was an unmanned flight, there were no victims, but the breakup caused the loss of four [[Cluster mission]] spacecraft, resulting in a loss of more than US$370 million<ref>{{cite journal | title = The Ariane 5 Software Failure | month = March | year = 1997 | volume = 22 | journal = Software Engineering Notes | last = Dowson | first = M. | pages = 84 | doi = 10.1145/251880.251992 | issue = 2}}</ref>. == Summary == The Ariane 5 software reused the specifications from the [[Ariane 4]], but the Ariane 5's flight path was considerably different and beyond the range for which the reused computer program had been designed. Specifically, the Ariane 5's greater acceleration caused the back-up and primary [[inertial guidance]] computers to crash, after which the launcher's nozzles were directed by spurious data. Pre-flight tests had never been performed on the re-alignment code under simulated Ariane 5 flight conditions, so the error was not discovered before launch. Because of the different flight path, a data conversion from a [[64-bit]] [[floating point]] to [[16-bit]] [[signedness|signed]] [[integer (computer science)|integer]] value caused a [[hardware]] [[exception
