is being used as money must be: * Divisible into smaller units without loss of value; precious metals can be coined from bars, or melted down into bars again. * [[Fungibility|Fungible]]: that is, one unit or piece must be perceived as equivalent to any other, which is why [[diamond]]s, works of [[art]] or [[real estate]] are not suitable as money. * A specific weight, or measure, or size to be verifiably countable. For instance, coins are often milled with a [[Milled coinage|reeded edge]], so that any removal of material from the coin (lowering its commodity value) will be easy to detect. === Store of value === {{Main|Store of value}} To act as a ''store of value'', a money must be able to be reliably saved, stored, and retrieved – and be predictably usable as a medium of exchange when it is retrieved. The value of the money must also remain stable over time. Some have argued that [[inflation]], by reducing the value of money, diminishes the ability of the money to function as a store of value.<ref name="mankiw"/> === Standard of deferred payment === {{Main|Standard of deferred payment}} While ''standard of deferred payment'' is distinguished by some texts,<ref name="greco" /> particularly older ones, other texts subsume this under other functions.<ref name="mankiw"/><ref name="krugman"/><ref name="abel_bernanke"/> A "standard of deferred payment" is an accepted way to settle a [[debt]] – a unit in which debts are denominated, and the status of money as [[legal tender]], in those jurisdictions which have this concept, states that it may function for the discharge of debts. When debts are denominated in money, the real value of debts may change due to [[inflation]] and [[deflation]], and for sovereign and international debts via [[debasement]] and [[devaluation]]. == Money supply == {{Main|Money supply}} In economics, money is a broad term that refers to any [[Instrument (finance)|financial instrument]] that can fulfill the functions of money (detailed above). These financial instruments together are collectively referred to as the [[money supply]] of an economy. In other words, the money supply is the amount of financial instruments within a specific economy available for purchasing goods or services. Since the money supply consists of various financial instruments (usually currency, demand deposits and various other types of deposits), the amount of money in an economy is measured by adding together these financial instruments creating a ''monetary aggregate''. Modern monetary theory distinguishes among different ways to measure the money supply, reflected in different types of monetary aggregates, using a categorization system that focuses on the [[Market liquidity|liquidity]] of the financial instrument used as money. The most commonly used monetary aggregates (or types of money) are conventionally designated M1, M2 and M3. These are successively larger aggregate categories: M1 is currency (coins and bills) plus [[demand deposits]] (such as checking accounts); M2 is M1 plus [[savings accounts]] and [[time deposits]] under $100,000; and M3 is M2 plus larger [[time deposits]] and similar institutional accounts. M1 includes only the most liquid financial instruments, and M3 relatively illiquid instruments. Another measure of money, M0, is also used; unlike the other measures, it does not represent actual [[purchasing power]] by firms and households in the economy. M0 is [[base money]], or the amount of money actually issued by the [[central bank]] of a country. It is measured as currency plus deposits of banks and other institutions at the central bank. M0 is also the only money that can satisfy the [[reserve requirements]] of [[commercial banks]]. === Market liquidity === {{Main|Market liquidity}} ''Market liquidity'' describes how easily an item can be traded for another item, or into the common currency within an economy. Money is the most liquid asset because it is universally recognised and accepted as the common currency. In this way, money gives consumers the [[liberty|freedom]] to trade goods and services easily without having to barter. Liquid financial instruments are easily [[tradable]] and have low [[transaction cost]]s. There should be no (or minimal) [[Bid/offer spread|spread]] between the prices to buy and sell the instrument being used as money. == Types of money == Currently, most modern monetary systems are based on fiat money. However, for most of history, almost all money was commodity money, such as gold and silver coins. As economies developed, commodity money was eventually replaced by [[representative money]], such as the [[gold standard]], as traders found the physical transportation of gold and silver burdensome. Fiat currencies gradually took over in the last hundred years, especially since the breakup of the [[Bretton Woods system]] in the early 1970s. === Commodity money === {{Main|Commodity money}} [[File:1914 Sydney Half Sovereign - St. George.jpg|thumb|200px|A 1914 British [[Sovereign (British coin)|Gold sovereign]]]] Many items have been used as [[commodity money]] such as naturally scarce [[precious metal]]s, [[conch shell]]s, [[barley]], beads etc., as well as many other things that are thought of as having [[Intrinsic value|value]]. Commodity money value comes from the commodity out of which it is made. The commodity itself constitutes the money, and the money is the commodity.<ref name="Mises">Mises, Ludwig von.

Use of commodity money is similar to barter, but a commodity money provides a simple and automatic [[unit of account]] for the commodity which is being used as money. Although some [[gold coins]] such as the [[Krugerrand]] are considered [[legal tender]], there is no record of their face value on either side of the coin. The rationale for this is that emphasis is laid on their direct link to
