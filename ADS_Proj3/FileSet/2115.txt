It integrates with [[Adobe Creative Suite]], providing efficient access to the animation toolset within the application. Because Ikivo Animator has a similar look and feel to today’s leading design tools (such as [[Adobe Illustrator]]), users are able to quickly start using it to develop their own professional [[SVG]] content.
