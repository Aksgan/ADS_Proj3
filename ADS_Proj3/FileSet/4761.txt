poles of the zeta function of ''E''<sup>''k''</sup> are found using Grothendieck's formula ::<math>Z(U,E^k,T) = \frac{\det(1-F^* T|H^1_c(E^k))}{\det(1-F^* T|H^0_c(E^k))\det(1-F^* T|H^2_c(E^k))}</math> :and calculating the cohomology groups in the denominator explicitly. The ''H''{{su|p=0|b=c}} term is usually just 1 as ''U'' is usually not compact, and the ''H''{{su|p=2|b=c}} can be calculated explicitly as follows. Poincare duality relates ''H''{{su|p=2|b=c}}(''E''<sup>''k''</sup>) to ''H''{{su|p=0|}}(''E''<sup>''k''</sup>), which is in turn the space of covariants of the monodromy group, which is the geometric fundamental group of ''U'' acting on the fiber of ''E''<sup>''k''</sup> at a point. The fiber of ''E'' has a bilinear form induced by [[cup product]], which is antisymmetric if ''d'' is even, and makes ''E'' into a symplectic space. (This is a little inaccurate: Deligne did later show that ''E''&cap;''E''<sup>&perp;</sup> = 0 by using the [[hard Lefschetz theorem]], this requires the Weil conjectures, and the proof of the Weil conjectures really has to use a slightly more complicated argument with ''E''/''E''&cap;''E''<sup>&perp;</sup> rather than ''E''.) An argument of Kazhdan and Margulis shows that the image of the monodromy group acting on ''E'' is Zariski dense in a symplectic group and therefore has the same invariants, which are well known from classical invariant theory. Keeping track of the action of Frobenius in this calculation shows that its eigenvalues are all ''q''<sup>''k''(''d''&minus;1)/2+1</sup>, so the zeta function of ''Z''(''E''<sup>''k''</sup>,''T'') has poles only at ''T''=1/''q''<sup>''k''(''d''&minus;1)''/2+1</sup>. *The Euler product for the zeta function of ''E''<sup>''k''</sup> is ::<math>Z(E^k,T) = \prod_x \frac{1}{Z(E^k_x,T)}</math> :If ''k'' is '''even''' then all the coefficients of the factors on the right (considered as power series in ''T'') are '''non-negative'''; this follows by writing ::<math>\frac{1}{\det(1-T^{deg(x)}F_x|E^k)} =\exp\left(\sum_{n>0}\frac{T^n}{n}Trace(F_x^n|E)^k\right) </math> :and using the fact that the traces of powers of ''F'' are rational, so their ''k'' powers are non-negative as ''k'' is even. Deligne proves the rationality of the traces by relating them to numbers of points of varieties, which are always (rational) integers. *The powers series for ''Z''(''E''<sup>''k''</sup>, ''T'') converges for ''T'' less than the absolute value 1/''q''<sup>''k''(''d''&minus;1)/2+1</sup> of its only possible pole. When ''k'' is even the coefficients of all its Euler factors are non-negative, so that each of the Euler factors has coefficients bounded by a constant times the coefficients of ''Z''(''E''<sup>''k''</sup>, ''T'') and therefore converges on the same region and has no poles in this region. So for ''k'' even the polynomials ''Z''(''E''{{su|p=''k''|b=''x''}}, ''T'') have no zeros in this region, or in other words the eigenvalues of Frobenius on the stalks of ''E''<sup>''k''</sup> have absolute value at most ''q''<sup>''k''(''d''&minus;1)''/2+1</sup>. *This estimate can be used to find the absolute value of any eigenvalue α of Frobenius on a fiber of ''E'' as follows. For any integer ''k'', &alpha;<sup>''k''</sup> is an eigenvalue of Frobenius on a stalk of ''E''<sup>''k''</sup>, which for ''k'' even is bounded by ''q''<sup>1+''k''(''d''&minus;1)/2</sup>. So ::<math>|\alpha^k|\le q^{k(d-1)/2 +1}</math> :As this is true for arbitrarily large even ''k'', this implies that ::<math>|\alpha|\le q^{(d-1)/2 }.</math> :[[Poincare duality]] then implies that ::<math>|\alpha|=q^{(d-1)/2 }.</math> ===Completion of the proof=== The deduction of the Riemann hypothesis from this estimate is mostly a fairly straightforward use of standard techniques and is done as follows. *The eigenvalues of Frobenius on ''H''{{su|p=1|b=c}}(''U'',''E'') can now be estimated as they are the zeros of the zeta function of the sheaf ''E''. This zeta function can be written as an Euler product of zeta functions of the stalks of ''E'', and using the estimate for the eigenvalues on these stalks shows that this product converges for |''T''|<''q''<sup>&minus;''d''/2&minus;1/2</sup>, so that there are no zeros of the zeta function in this region. This implies that the eigenvalues of Frobenius on ''E'' are at most ''q''<sup>''d''/2+1/2</sup> in absolute value (in fact it will soon be seen that they have absolute value exactly ''q''<sup>''d''/2</sup>). This step of the argument is very similar to the usual proof that the Riemann zeta function has no zeros with real part greater than 1, by writing it as an Euler product. *The conclusion of this is that the eigenvalues α of the Frobenius of a variety of even dimension ''d'' on the middle cohomology group satisfy ::<math> |\alpha| \le q^{d/2+1/2}</math> :To obtain the Riemann hypothesis one needs to eliminate the 1/2 from the exponent. This can be done as follows. Applying this estimate to any even power ''V''<sup>''k''</sup> of ''V'' and using the [[Kunneth formula]] shows that the eigenvalues of Frobenius on the middle cohomology of a variety ''V'' of any dimension ''d'' satisfy ::<math> |\alpha^k| \le q^{kd/2+1/2}</math> :As this is true for arbitrarily large even ''k'', this implies that ::<math>|\alpha| \le q^{d/2}</math> :[[Poincare duality]] then implies that ::<math>|\alpha| = q^{d/2}.</math> *This proves the Weil conjectures for the middle cohomology of a variety. The Weil conjectures for the cohomology below the middle dimension follow from this by applying the [[weak Lefschetz theorem]], and the conjectures for cohomology above the middle dimension then follow from Poincare duality. ==Deligne's second proof== {{harvtxt|Deligne|1980}} found and proved a generalization of the Weil conjectures, bounding the weights of the pushforward of a sheaf. In practice it is this generalization rather than the original Weil conjectures that is mostly used in applications, such as the hard Lefschetz theorem. Much of the second proof is a rearrangement of the ideas of his first proof. The main extra idea needed is an argument closely related to the theorem of Hadamard and de la Vallée Poussin, used by Deligne to show that various ''L''-series do not have zeros with real part 1. A constructible sheaf on a variety over a finite field is called pure of weight β if for all points ''x'' the eigenvalues of the Frobenius at ''x'' all have absolute value ''N''(''x'')<sup>β/2</sup>, and is called mixed of weight ≤β if it can be written as repeated extensions by pure sheaves with weights ≤β. Deligne's theorem states that if ''f'' is a morphism of schemes of finite type over a finite field, then ''R''<sup>''i''</sup>''f''<sub>!</sub> takes mixed sheaves of weight ≤β to mixed sheaves of weight ≤β+i. The original Weil conjectures follow by taking ''f'' to be a morphism from a smooth projective variety to a point and considering
