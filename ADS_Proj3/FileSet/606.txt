It is a nonprofit certifying body for the specialized fabric-cleaning industry that sets modern carpet-cleaning standards. It accepts five basic dry and wet professional cleaning methodologies. ==Dry-cleaning== {{details|Dry carpet cleaning}} Many dry carpet-cleaning systems rely on specialized machines;<ref name=dry>{{cite web|url=http://www.repair-home.com/Dry_Carpet_Cleaning.html|title=Dry Carpet Cleaning|work=Repair-Home.com|publisher=Beehive Content Works|year=2009|accessdate=2009-04-02}}</ref> dry carpet-cleaning machines include those manufactured by [[Brush and Clean]], [[Host Dry]], and [[Whittaker System]]. These systems are mostly technically "very low moisture" (VLM) systems, relying on dry compounds complemented by application cleaning solutions, and are growing significantly in market share due in part to their very rapid drying time,<ref name=ics3>{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-34824950_ITM|title=Speed Up Your Drying Times: An increasingly common unique selling position for carpet cleaners today is rapid drying, which plays upon the customer's fears and concerns about slow drying, discolorations returning, odor, mildew and GKW (Carpet Cleaning Basics)|work=ICS Cleaning Specialist|author=Wittkamp, Bob|date=2007-03-01|accessdate=2009-04-02|publisher=Business News Publishing Co.}}</ref> a significant factor for 24-hour commercial installations. Dry-cleaning and "very low moisture" systems are also often faster and less labor-intensive than wet-extraction systems.<ref name=ics5/> Heavily soiled areas require the application of manual spotting, or of pretreatments, preconditioners, or "traffic-lane cleaners", which are detergents or emulsifiers that break the binding of different soils to carpet fibers over a short period of time, commonly sprayed onto carpet prior to the primary use of the dry-cleaning system. One chemical dissolves the greasy films that bind soils and prevent effective soil removal by vacuuming. The solution may add a solvent like [[d-limonene]], [[petroleum]] byproducts, [[glycol ether]]s, or [[butyl]] agents. The amount of time the pretreatment "dwells" in the carpet should be less than 15 minutes, due to the thorough carpet brushing common to these "very low moisture" systems, which provides added agitation to ensure the pretreatment works fully through the carpet.<ref name=ics4>{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7741213_ITM|title=Pre- and Post-Cleaning Carpet Treatments: As you meander down the aisles of your supplier's showroom, you are presented with a wide array of products designed for such specialized purposes as spot removal, odor control or correction, color correction, and sanitizing (Carpet Cleaning Basics)|work=ICS Cleaning Specialist|author=Wittkamp, Bob|date=2004-12-01|accessdate=2009-04-02|publisher=Business News Publishing Co.}}</ref> ===Dry compound=== A [[biodegradable]] absorbent powder and cleaning compound may be spread evenly over carpet and brushed or scrubbed in. For small areas, a household hand brush can work such a compound into carpet pile; dirt and grime is attracted to the compound, which is then vacuumed off, leaving carpet immediately clean and dry. For commercial applications, a specially designed cylindrical counter-rotating brushing system is used, without a vacuum cleaner. Machine scrubbing is more typical, in that hand scrubbing generally cleans only the top third of carpet.<ref name=dry/> ===Encapsulation=== In the 1990s, new [[polymer]]s began literally encapsulating (crystallizing) soil particles into dry residues on contact, in a process now regarded by the industry as a growing, up-and-coming technology;<ref name=sm/> working like "tiny sponges", the deep-cleaning compound crystals dissolve and absorb dirt prior to its removal from the carpet.<ref name=cmc>{{cite news|url=http://www.cleanfax.com|title=Dry Carpet Cleaner|work=CM Cleanfax|date=2005-04-01|accessdate=2009-04-02|page=48}}</ref> Cleaning solution is applied by rotary machine, brush applicator, or compression sprayer. Dry residue is vacuumable immediately, either separately or from a built-in unit of the cleaning-system machine. According to ''ICS Cleaning Specialist'', evidence suggests encapsulation improves carpet appearance, compared to other systems; and it is favorable in terms of high-traffic needs, operator training, equipment expense, and lack of wet residue.<ref name=ics>{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7464080_ITM|work=ICS Cleaning
