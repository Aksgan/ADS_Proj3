Such theories usually claim that the [[Eye of Providence]] (found, in the Seal, above the pyramid) is a common Masonic emblem, and that the Great Seal was created by Freemasons.<ref>for example: [http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/NWO/All_Seeing_Eye.htm conspiracyarchive.com], and [http://www.masoncode.com/The%20Great%20Seal.htm www.masoncode.com]</ref> These claims, however, misstate the facts. While the [[Eye of Providence]] is ''currently'' a common Masonic motif, this was not the case during the 1770s and 1780s (the decades when the Great Seal was being designed and approved). According to David Barrett, a Masonic researcher, the Eye seems to have been used only sporadically by the Masons in those decades, and was not adopted as a common Masonic symbol until 1797, several years after the Great Seal of the United States had already been designed.<ref>[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/masonic_dollar.html Masonic Dollar?]</ref> The Eye of Providence was, on the other hand, a fairly common Christian motif throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and was commonly used as such in Europe as well as America throughout the 18th century.<ref name="eagleshieldeye"/><ref name="Center for Studies on New Religions-Great Seal">{{cite web|url = http://www.cesnur.org/2005/mi_illuminati_en.htm| title = Angels & Demons from the Book to the Movie FAQ – Do the Illuminati Really Exist?|publisher = Center for Studies on New Religions|accessdate = 2009–05–25}}</ref> Furthermore, contrary to the claims of these conspiracy theories, the Great Seal was not created by Freemasons.<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,330388,00.html Associated Press story, Tuesday, February 12, 2008 as hosted by foxnews.com]</ref> While [[Benjamin Franklin]] was a Mason, he was the only member of any of the various Great Seal committees definitively known to be so, and his ideas were not adopted.<ref>Hodapp, Christopher; Freemasons for Dummies, Wiley Publishing, 2005, pp 155-156</ref> Of the four men whose ideas ''were'' adopted, neither [[Charles Thomson]], [[Pierre Du Simitière]] nor [[William Barton (heraldist)|William Barton]] were Masons and, while [[Francis Hopkinson]] has been alleged to have had Masonic connections, there is no firm evidence to support the claim.<ref>[http://www.msana.com/eyeinpyramid.asp the Masonic Service Association]</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Patterson | first = Richard S. | coauthors = Richardson Dougall | title = The Eagle and the Shield: a History of the Great Seal of the United States | publisher = Department of State, Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs | year = 1978 | page = 529 | url = http://www.greatseal.com/mythamerica/notmasonic.html }}</ref> ==See also== * [[Seal of the President of the United States]] * [[Seal of the United States Senate]] * [[Confederate Seal]] ==References== {{Reflist|2}} ==External links== {{Commons category|Great Seal of the United States}} * [http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/27807.pdf PDF booklet from U.S. State Department, 2003 version], and [http://www.state.gov/www/publications/great_seal.pdf 1996 version] &mdash; Bureau of Public Affairs * [http://diplomacy.state.gov/exhibitions/100911.htm State Department exhibition on the 225th anniversary of the Great Seal] * [http://www.GreatSeal.com Website on the Great Seal] * [http://www.21stcenturyradio.com/news/Hieronimus_GreatSealofUSA.html Dr. Robert Hieronimus visits the Keeper of the Seal with photos of the actual die press] {{US state seals}} {{Coat of arms of North America}} {{DEFAULTSORT:United States, Great Seal Of The}} [[Category:National symbols of the United States|Great Seal]] [[Category:Seals (insignia)]] [[Category:National coats of arms]] [[Category:American heraldry|Great Seal of the United States]] {{Link GA|de}} [[am:የአሜሪካ ታላቅ ማኅተም]] [[ar:ختم الولايات المتحدة العظيم]] [[be:Герб ЗША]] [[bs:Grb Sjedinjenih Američkih Država]] [[bg:Държавен печат на САЩ]] [[ca:Gran Segell dels Estats Units]] [[cs:Státní znak Spojených států amerických]] [[da:USA's store segl]] [[de:Siegel der Vereinigten Staaten]] [[et:Ameerika Ühendriikide vapp]] [[el:Εθνόσημο των Ηνωμένων Πολιτειών]] [[es:Gran Sello de los Estados Unidos]] [[eo:Granda Sigelo de Usono]] [[fa:نشان بزرگ ایالات متحده آمریکا]] [[fr:Grand sceau des États-Unis]] [[ko:미국의 국장]] [[hr:Grb Sjedinjenih Američkih Država]] [[bpy:তিলপারাষ্ট্রর চিনত্হান]] [[id:Lambang Amerika Serikat]] [[it:Stemma degli Stati Uniti d'America]] [[he:סמל ארצות הברית]] [[lv:Amerikas Savienoto Valstu lielais zīmogs]] [[hu:Az Amerikai Egyesült Államok címere]] [[nl:Grootzegel van de Verenigde Staten]] [[ja:アメリカ合衆国の国章]] [[no:Amerikas forente staters riksvåpen]] [[pl:Wielka Pieczęć Stanów Zjednoczonych]] [[pt:Grande Selo dos Estados Unidos]] [[ru:Большая печать США]] [[sco:Great Seal o the Unitit States]] [[simple:Great Seal of the United States]] [[sk:Štátny znak Spojených štátov]] [[sr:Грб Сједињених Америчких Држава]] [[sh:Grb Sjedinjenih Američkih Država]] [[fi:Yhdysvaltain vaakuna]] [[sv:USA:s stora sigill]] [[tr:Amerika Birleşik Devletleri arması]] [[uk:Велика печатка Сполучених Штатів]] [[yo:Coat of arms of the United States]] [[zh:美国国徽]]</text> </page> <page> <id>15796</id> <title>Green Pages</title> <text>'''Green Pages''' are one of the three main components of [[UDDI]] - the protocol used to discover [[Web Services]] (the other two components being [[White Pages (UDDI)|White Pages]] and [[Yellow Pages (UDDI)|Yellow pages]]). Green pages are used to describe how to access a Web Service, with information on the service bindings. Some of the information is related to the Web Service - such as the address of the service and the parameters, and references to specifications of interfaces.<ref>Taylor, Ian J.

Springer, 2005</ref> Other information is not related directly to the Web Service - this includes e-mail, [[FTP]], [[CORBA]] and telephone details for the service. Because a Web Service may have multiple bindings (as defined in its [[Web Services Description Language|WSDL]] description), a service may have multiple Green Pages, as each binding will need to be accessed differently. ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Web service specifications]] [[Category:XML-based standards]] [[Category:Web services]]</text> </page> <page> <id>15802</id> <title>Greenstone (software)</title> <text>{{Primary|date=June 2010}} {{Infobox Software | name = Greenstone | screenshot = [[Image:GLI-2.74.png|250px]] | caption = Greenstone's Graphical Librarian Interface (GLI) v2.80 | developer = [[University of Waikato]] | latest_release_version = Greenstone2: 2.83, Greenstone3: 3.02 | operating_system = [[Cross-platform]] | genre = [[Digital library|Digital libraries ]] | license = [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] | website = [http://www.greenstone.org/ www.greenstone.org] | }} '''Greenstone''' is a suite of [[software]] tools for building and distributing [[digital library]] collections on the [[Internet]] or [[CD-ROM]].
