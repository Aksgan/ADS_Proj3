There is, as of late 2008, no complete free software replacement which offers all the functionality of the latest version of Adobe Flash Player. Presenting the [[free software movement]], [[Richard Stallman]] stated in a speech in October 2004 that:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1647626314188526128&ei=LkqgSbfhIYva2gLUotGRDg&hl=un |title=Richard Stallman on The free software movement and its challenges |accessdate=2009-02-21 |publisher=Google Video |location=Australian National University, Canberra, Australia}}</ref> <blockquote>The use of Flash in websites is a major problem for our community.</blockquote> Stallman's argument then was that no [[#Playback|free players]] were comparatively good enough. As of February 2010, [[Gnash]] and [[Swfdec]] have seen limited success in competing with Adobe's player. Many important and popular websites require users to have a Flash player, sometimes with no fallback for non-Flash web users. Therefore, the lack of a good free Flash player is arguably an obstacle to enjoying the web with free software, and the aforementioned ubiquity of Flash makes the problem very evident for anyone who tries. The continual high ranking of Gnash on the Free Software Foundation's list of high priority projects<ref>{{Cite document|url=http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority.html|publisher=Free Software Foundation|title=High Priority Free Software Projects|accessdate=2009-07-09|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> might indicate the severity of the problem, as judged by the free software community.
