original picture. Here, the participants were allowed to code either in C or C++. ===Mechanical events=== ;Load runner :Load runner required participants to build a manually controlled robot that had a hooking mechanism so that it could hook up to freights and link them together to form a train. It then had to form the engine of the same train and pull it to its destination. Use of magnetic material to attach to the freights was prohibited. ;Step climber :In this event, participants were required to build a manually controlled robot that could climb up and down a flight of stairs. The height of the steps varied up and down the stairs. ==Robotix 2006== Robotix 2006 was held between 2 February and 5 February, 2006. The following five events were held- ===Autonomous events === ;Distance Tracker : In this event participant had to build a fully autonomous machine that would not only know exactly the distance that it has traversed, but would also flash it in digital format; paths ranged from a simple circle to an arbitrary route. ;Match Maker :This event required participants to prepare a computer controlled robot that would move the white blocks placed in the arena to regions of their corresponding shape. ===Programming - online events === ;Mission Mars : In this online programming event participants had to code their robot ants to cover as much area of the Martian surface, given time is a constraint. ===Mechanical events=== ;Top-sy Turvy :Top-sy Turvy required participants to make bots which could pick the balls kept at different altitudes and on different surfaces and throw them in a goal-post within a stipulated amount of time. ;Water Polo :This event was a race on water surface. The machine made by the participants had to put five balls inside a certain goalpost (net) in the least time possible. ==See also== {{Indian Institute Of Technology}} ==External links== *[http://robotix.in Official Website of Robotix] *[http://www.iitkgp.ac.in Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur] *[http://ktj.in Kshitij Website] [[Category:Robotics competitions]]</text> </page> <page> <id>32347</id> <title>Rock-paper-scissors</title> <text>{{dablink|"Roshambo" redirects here.

However, unlike truly [[randomness|random]] selection methods, rock-paper-scissors can be played with a degree of skill, especially if the game extends over many sessions with the same players; it is often possible to recognize and exploit the non-random behavior of an opponent.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fisher|first=Len|title=Rock, paper, scissors: game theory in everyday life|year=2008|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=9780465009381|page=94}}</ref> == Game play == {{triple image|right|Rock-paper-scissors (rock).png|70|Rock-paper-scissors (paper).png|70|Rock-paper-scissors (scissors).png|70|Each of the three basic hand-signs (from left to right: rock, paper, and scissors) beats one of the other two, and loses to the other.}} The players count aloud to three, or speak the name of the game (e.g. "Rock! Paper! Scissors!" or "Ro! Cham! Beau!"), each time raising one hand in a fist and swinging it down on the count. On the third count (saying, "Scissors!" or "Beau!"), the players change their hands into one of three gestures, which they then "throw" by extending it towards their opponent. Variations include a version where players use a fourth count — "Shoot!" — before throwing their gesture, or a version where they only shake their hands twice before "throwing." Others prefer a five count cadence by saying "Says Shoot!" or "And Shoot!" before throwing their gesture. The gestures are: * '''Rock''', represented by a clenched fist. * '''Scissors''', represented by two fingers extended and separated. * '''Paper''', represented by an open hand, with the fingers connected (horizontal). The objective is to select a gesture which defeats that of the opponent. Gestures are resolved as follows: * Rock blunts or breaks scissors: that is, rock defeats scissors * Scissors cut paper: scissors defeats paper * Paper covers, sands or captures rock: paper defeats rock If both players choose the same gesture, the game is tied and the players throw again. == History == {{Original research|date=January 2010}} According to Xie Zhaozhe (谢肇淛)'s book ‘’Wuzazu(五杂组)‘’, in the Chinese [[Ming Dynasty|Ming dynasty period]], the game could date back to the time of Chinese [[Han Dynasty|Han dynasty]], it is called (手势令). Li rihua(李日华)'s book '' Note of Liuyanzhai(六砚斋笔记)''also reveals this game, calling it shoushiling(手势令), or huozhitou（豁指头）, or huoquan（豁拳）. In the 18th century these games were popular in Japan.　 The Japanese people invented Janken(Rock-paper-scissors) in the latter half of 19th century. As for Rock-paper-scissors, it came to be played all over the world in the 20th century. {{Nihongo|'''Jan-ken-pon'''|じゃんけんぽん}}, or more commonly {{Nihongo|'''janken'''|じゃんけん}}, often transliterated in other ways such as '''jack-en-poy''' (tagalog), '''janken-po''', etc., sometimes called {{Nihongo|'''rock ken'''|石拳|ishiken}}, and known as rock-paper-scissors or paper-scissors-stone in the [[English-speaking world]]. The origin or the derivation of the name is unknown. {{Nihongo|'''ken'''|拳|ken}} is a fist in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and ''Jan-ken-po'' is categorized as a {{Nihongo|"ken (fist) games"|拳遊び|ken asobi}}. ''Janken'' is believed to have been based on two older ''ken'' games, ''sū ken'' ({{Lang|ja|数拳}}, number competing game with fingers, likely similar to or identical with [[Morra]]) and ''san sukumi ken'' ({{Lang|ja|三すくみ拳}}, ''san sukumi'' means the freezing aspects of a snake, frog, and slug with fear). ''San sukumi ken'' has existed in Japan since ancient times, and ''sū ken'' was imported from China in the late 17th century; the name in China of ''sū ken'' is ''shǒushìlìng'' ({{Lang|zh|手勢令}}). ''Ken'' games began to increase in popularity in the middle of the 19th century. == Variations == Players have developed numerous cultural and personal variations on the game, from simply playing the
