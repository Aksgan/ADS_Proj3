rotating disks and moving heads. [[Seek time]] is a measure of how long it takes the head assembly to travel to the track of the disk that contains data. [[Rotational delay]] is incurred because the desired disk sector may not be directly under the head when data transfer is requested. These two delays are on the order of milliseconds each. The [[bit rate]] or data transfer speed once the head is in the right position creates lesser delays. A further delay mechanism occurs when the drive disks are stopped to save energy, such as in a laptop computer when operating on batteries; this can add hundreds of milliseconds of delay until data can be moved. [[Defragmentation]] is a procedure used to minimize delay in retrieving data by moving related items to physically proximate areas on the disk.<ref name="itworld-2001-04-18"> {{cite news |title=How to defrag |first=Dave |last=Kearns |date=2001-04-18 |newspaper=ITWorld |url=http://www.itworld.com/NWW01041100636262 }}</ref> Some computer operating systems perform defragmentation automatically.

Increasing areal density increases [[throughput]] by increasing data rate and by increasing the amount of data under a set of heads, thereby potentially reducing seek activity for a given amount of data. Based on historic trends, analysts predict a future growth in HDD areal density (and therefore capacity) of about 40% per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardwarezone.com.ph/articles/view.php?cid=1&id=1805&pg=2|title=Seagate Outlines the Future of Storage :: Articles :: www.hardwarezone.com|publisher=www.hardwarezone.com|date=2006-01-27|accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref> [[Access time]]s have not kept up with throughput increases, which themselves have not kept up with growth in storage capacity. ===Seek time=== [[Seek time]] for non-sequential data ranges from 3 [[millisecond|ms]]<ref name="WD-VRaptor Specs">{{cite web|date=June 2010|url=http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=20|title=WD VelicoRaptor: Drive Specifications|publisher=[[Western Digital]]|accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref> for high-end server drives, to 15 ms for mobile drives, with the most common mobile drives at about 12 [[Millisecond|ms]]<ref name="WD-Scorpio Blue-specs">{{cite web|date=June 2010|url=http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=140|title=WD Scorpio Blue Mobile: Drive Specifications|publisher=[[Western Digital]]|accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref> and the most common desktop type typically being around 9 ms. The [http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_350.html first HDD] had an average seek time of about 600 ms and by the middle 1970s HDDs were available with seek times of about [http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_3350.html 25 ms]. Some early PC drives used a [[stepper motor]] to move the heads, and as a result had seek times as slow as 80–120 ms, but this was quickly improved by [[voice coil]] type actuation in the 1980s, reducing seek times to around 20 ms. Seek time has continued to improve slowly over time. ==Form factors== [[Image:5.25 inch MFM hard disk drive.JPG|thumb|5¼″ full height 110 MB HDD,<br />2½″ (8.5 mm) 6495 MB HDD,<br />US/UK pennies for comparison.]] [[Image:SixHardDriveFormFactors.jpg|thumb|Six hard drives with 8″, 5.25″, 3.5″, 2.5″, 1.8″, and 1″ disks, partially disassembled to show platters and read-write heads, with a ruler showing inches.]] Mainframe and minicomputer hard disks were of widely varying dimensions, typically in free standing cabinets the size of washing machines (e.g. [http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/rp06.html DEC RP06 Disk Drive]) or designed so that dimensions enabled placement in a [[19 inch rack|19" rack]] (e.g. [http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/diablo/81502A_Model30descr_Sep75.pdf Diablo Model 31]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}). In 1962, IBM introduced its model 1311 disk, which used 14 inch (nominal size) platters. This became a standard size for mainframe and minicomputer drives for many years,<ref>Emerson W. Pugh, Lyle R. Johnson, John H. Palmer ''IBM's 360 and early 370 systems'' MIT Press, 1991 ISBN 0262161230, page 266</ref> but such large platters were never used with microprocessor-based systems. With increasing sales of microcomputers having built in [[floppy disk|floppy-disk drives (FDDs)]], HDDs that would fit to the FDD mountings became desirable, and this led to the evolution of the market towards drives with certain '''Form factors''', initially derived from the sizes of 8-inch, 5.25-inch, and 3.5-inch floppy disk drives. Smaller sizes than 3.5 inches have emerged as popular in the marketplace and/or been decided by various industry groups. *'''8 inch:''' {{val|9.5|u=in}} × {{val|4.624|u=in}} × {{val|14.25|u=in}} ({{val|241.3|u=mm}} × {{val|117.5|u=mm}} × {{val|362|u=mm}})<br/>In 1979, [[Shugart Associates]]' SA1000 was the first form factor compatible HDD, having the same dimensions and a compatible interface to the 8″ FDD. *'''5.25 inch:''' 5.75 in × 3.25 in × 8 in (146.1 mm × 82.55 mm × 203 mm)<br/>This smaller form factor, first used in an HDD by Seagate in 1980,<ref>{{cite book|title=The Innovator's Dilemma|last=Christensen|first=Clayton M.|year=1997|publisher=HarperBusiness|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-06-662069-4|page=19|pages=252}}</ref> was the same size as full-height {{convert|5+1/4|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} FDD, 3.25-inches high. This is twice as high as "half height"; i.e., 1.63 in (41.4 mm). Most desktop models of drives for optical 120 mm disks ([[DVD]], [[CD]]) use the half height 5¼″ dimension, but it fell out of fashion for HDDs.
