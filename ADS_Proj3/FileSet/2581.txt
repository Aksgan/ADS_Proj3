Arithmetics necessarily have [[infinite set|infinite]] [[model theory|models]]. *Cegielski arithmetic<ref>Smorynski (1991).</ref>: A commutative [[cancellative]] [[monoid]] under multiplication. 0 annihilates multiplication, and ''xy''=1 [[if and only if]] ''x'' and ''y'' are both 1. Other axioms and one axiom schema govern order, [[exponentiation]], [[divisibility]], and [[primality]]; consult Smorynski. Adding the [[successor function]] and its axioms as per Dedekind algebra render addition recursively definable, resulting in a system with the expressive power of [[Robinson arithmetic]]. In the structures below, addition and multiplication, if present, are [[recursive]]ly defined by means of an [[injective]] operation called [[successor function|successor]], denoted by [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] σ. 0 is the axiomatic [[identity element]] for addition, and annihilates multiplication. Both axioms hold for [[semiring]]s. *Dedekind algebra<ref>Potter (2004: 90).</ref>, also called a ''Peano algebra'': A pointed unary system by virtue of 0, the unique element of ''S'' not included in the [[range (mathematics)|range]] of [[successor function|successor]]. Dedekind algebras are fragments of Skolem arithmetic. ** [[Peano axioms|Dedekind-Peano structure]]: A Dedekind algebra with an [[axiom schema]] of [[mathematical induction|induction]]. ***[[Presburger arithmetic]]: A Dedekind-Peano structure with [[recursive]] [[addition]]. '''Arithmetics above this line are [[decidability (logic)|decidable]]. Those below are [[Godel's incompleteness theorem|incompletable]].''' ::*[[Robinson arithmetic]]: Presburger arithmetic with [[recursive]] [[multiplication]]. :::* [[Peano arithmetic]]: Robinson arithmetic with an [[axiom schema]] of [[mathematical induction|induction]]. The semiring axioms for '''N''' (other than ''x''+0=''x'' and ''x''0=0, included in the recursive definitions of addition and multiplication) are now theorems. ::::*[[Heyting arithmetic]]: Peano arithmetic with [[intuitionist logic]] as the background logic. **[[Primitive recursive arithmetic]]: A Dedekind algebra with recursively defined addition, multiplication, exponentiation, and other [[primitive recursive]] operations as desired. A rule of induction replaces the [[axiom of induction]]. The background logic lacks [[quantification]] and thus is not [[first-order logic]]. **[[Primitive recursion|Skolem arithmetic]] (Boolos and Jeffrey 2002: 73-76): Not an algebraic structure because there is no fixed set of operations of fixed [[Arity|adicity]]. Skolem arithmetic is a Dedekind algebra with [[projection (mathematics)|projection functions]], indexed by ''n'', whose arguments are functions and that return the ''n''th argument of a function. The [[identity function]] is the projection function whose arguments are all unary operations. Composite operations of any [[adicity]], including addition and multiplication, may be constructed using [[function composition]] and [[primitive recursion]]. [[Mathematical induction]] becomes a theorem. ***[[László Kalmár|Kalmar]] arithmetic: Skolem arithmetic with different primitive functions. The following arithmetics lack a connection between addition and multiplication. They are the simplest arithmetics capable of expressing all [[primitive recursive function]]s. *Baby Arithmetic<ref>Machover, M., 1996. ''Sets, Logic, and their Limitations''. Cambridge Univ. Press: 10.9.</ref>: Because there is no [[universal quantification]], there are [[axiom schema|axiom schemes]] but no axioms. [''n''] denotes ''n'' consecutive applications of [[successor function|successor]] to 0. Addition and multiplication are defined by the schemes [''n'']+[''p''] = [''n''+''p''] and [''n''][''p''] = [''np'']. **''R''<ref>[[Alfred Tarski]], [[Andrej Mostowski]], and [[Raphael Robinson]], 1953. ''Undecidable Theories''. North-Holland: 53.</ref>: Baby arithmetic plus the [[binary relation]]s "=" and "≤". These relations are governed by the schemes [''n'']=[''p''] ↔ ''n''=''p'', (''x''≤[''n''])→(''x''=0)∨,...,∨(''x''=[''n'']), and (''x''≤[''n''])∨([''n'']≤''x''). ===Lattices that are not varieties=== *[[mereology|Part algebra]]: a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] with no least element 0, so that the complement of 1 is not defined. Two sets, Φ and ''D''. *[[Information algebra]]: ''D'' is a lattice, and Φ is a commutative [[monoid]] under combination, an [[idempotent]] operation. The operation of focussing, ''f'': Φx''D''→Φ satisfies the axiom ''f''(''f''(φ,''x''),''y'')=''f''(φ,''x''∧''y'') and distributes over combination. Every element of Φ has an identity element in ''D'' under focussing. ===Field-like structures=== '''Two''' [[binary operation]]s, addition and multiplication. ''S'' is nontrivial, i.e., ''S''≠{0}. ''S''-0 is ''S'' with 0 removed. * [[domain (ring theory)|Domain]]: a [[ring (algebra)|ring]] whose sole [[zero divisor]] is 0. **[[Integral domain]]: a [[commutative ring]], 0 ≠ 1, and having the [[zero-product property]]: (''x''≠0∧''y''≠0) → ''xy''≠0. Hence there are no [[zero divisor]]s. *** [[Euclidean domain]]: an [[integral domain]] with a function ''f'': ''S''→'''N''' satisfying the [[Euclidean domain|division with remainder property]]. * [[Division ring]] (also ''skew field'', ''sfield''): a [[ring (algebra)|ring]] such that ''S''-0 is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under multiplication. ** [[Field (mathematics)|Field]]: a division ring whose multiplication commutes. Recapitulating: addition and multiplication commute, associate, and are [[unital algebra|unital]]. ''S'' is closed under a two-sided [[additive inverse]], ''S''-0 under a two-sided [[multiplicative inverse]]. Multiplication has a [[zero element]] and [[distributivity|distributes]] over addition. ***[[Ordered field]]: a field whose ''S'' is [[linear order|totally ordered]] by '≤', so that (''a''≤''b'')→(''a''+''c''≤''b''+''c'') and (0≤''a'',''b'')→ (0≤''ab''). ****[[Real closed field]]: an ordered real field such that for every element ''x'' of ''S'', there exists a ''y'' such that ''x'' = ''y''<sup>2</sup> or -''y''<sup>2</sup>. All [[polynomial equation]]s of odd degree and whose coefficients are elements of ''S'', have at least one [[root of a function|root]] that in ''S''. **** [[Real field]]: a [[Dedekind complete]] ordered field. *****[[Differential field]]: A real field with an added [[unary operation]], [[differential algebra|derivation]], denoted by prefix ∂, distributing over [[addition]], ∂(''x''+''y'') = ∂''x''+ ∂''y'', and satisfying the [[product rule]], ∂(''xy'') = ∂''xy'' + ''x''∂''y''. ***[[Algebraically closed field]]: a field such that all [[polynomial equation]]s whose coefficients are elements of ''S'' have all [[root of a function|roots]] in ''S''. The following field-like structures are not varieties for reasons in addition to ''S''≠{0}: * [[Simple ring]]: a ring having no [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] other than 0 and ''S''. **[[Weyl algebra]]: * [[Artinian ring]]: a ring whose [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] satisfy the [[descending chain condition]]. ===Vector spaces that are not varieties=== The following composite structures are extensions of [[vector space]]s that are not varieties. Two sets: ''M'' is a set of [[vector (geometric)|vectors]] and ''R'' is a set of [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]s. '''Three''' binary operations. *[[Normed vector space]]: a vector space with a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]], namely a function ''M''→''R'' that is [[symmetric]], [[linear]], and [[positive definite]]. **[[Inner product space]] (also ''Euclidian'' vector space): a normed vector space such that ''R'' is the [[real field]], whose norm is the square root of the [[inner product]], ''M''×''M''→''R''. Let ''i'',''j'', and ''n'' be positive integers such that 1≤''i'',''j''≤''n''. Then ''M'' has an [[orthonormal basis]] such that ''e''<sub>i</sub>•''e''<sub>j</sub> = 1 if ''i''=''j'' and 0 otherwise. See [[free module]]. **[[inner product space|Unitary space]]: Differs from inner product spaces in that ''R'' is the [[complex field]], and the inner
