He was born in [[Brzeżany]], [[Imperial Russia]] (now [[Ukraine]]) and [[graduated]] as a disciple of among others [[Hugo Steinhaus]] and [[Stefan Banach]] from the [[University of Lwów]] Poland (now Ukraine) and the [[University of Cracow]], having studied [[game theory]]. After the graduation in 1939 Kofler returned to his family in [[Kolomyia]] (today Kolomea in Ukraine), where he taught mathematics in a Polish high school. After [[Operation Barbarossa|German attack]] on the town 1 July 1941 he succeeded to flight to [[Kazakhstan]] together with his wife. Here at [[Alma-Ata]] he managed a Polish school with orphanage in [[exile]] and worked there as mathematics teacher. After the World War II was ended he returned home to Polen with the orphanage. He was accompanied by the wife and his baby son. The family settled in Poland. From 1959 he accepted the position of lecturer at the [[University of Warsaw]] in the faculty of economics. In 1962 he gained a [[Ph.D.]] with his thesis ''Economic Decisions, Applying Game Theory''. Then in 1962 he became assistant professor at the faculty of social science in the same university, specializing in [[econometrics]]. <!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:kofgry63.jpg|thumb|left|200px| E. Kofler's work from 1963 "Introduction to the Theory of Games"]] --> In 1969 he migrated to [[Zürich]], [[Switzerland]], where he was employed at the Institute for Empirical Research in Economics at the [[University of Zürich]] and scientific advisor at the [[Swiss National Science Foundation]] (Schweizerische Nationalfonds zur Förderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung). In Zürich in 1970 Kofler developed his [[linear partial information]] (LPI) theory allowing qualified decisions to be made on the basis of fuzzy logic: incomplete or fuzzy [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] [[information]]. Kofler was visiting professor at the [[University of St Petersburg]] (former [[Leningrad]], Russia), [[University of Heidelberg]] (Germany), [[McMaster University]] ([[Hamilton, Ontario]], Canada) and [[University of Leeds]] (England). He collaborated with many well known specialists in [[information theory]], such as [[Oskar R. Lange]] in Poland, Nicolai Vorobiev in the Soviet Union, [[Günter Menges]] in Germany, and Heidi Schelbert and Peter Zweifel in Zürich. He was the author of many books and articles. He died in Zürich. == References == * {{Cite book| last=E.
