they were still not available by the middle of 1948. As development dragged on the IAS machine was forced to switch to [[Williams tube]]s for storage, and the primary customer for Selectron disappeared. RCA continued work on the concept, re-designing it for a smaller 256-bit capacity. The 256-bit Selectron was projected to cost about $500 each when in full production. While they were more reliable and faster than the Williams tube, that cost and the lack of availability, meant they were used only in one computer: the RAND Corporation's [[JOHNNIAC]].<ref>Greuenberger JF (1968) [http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_memoranda/RM5654/ ''The History of the JOHNNIAC''] pp 25-27</ref> Both the Selectron and the Williams tube were superseded in the market by the more compact and cost effective [[magnetic core memory]], in the early 1950s. == Design == The original 4096-bit Selectron<ref>Rajchman JA, (1947) "The Selectron -- A Tube for Selective Electrostatic Storage", ''Mathematical Tables and Other Aids to Computation'' '''2''' (20):359-361</ref> was a {{convert|10|in|mm|adj=mid|-long}} by {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} [[vacuum tube]] configured as 1024 by 4 bits. It had an indirectly heated [[cathode]] running up the middle, surrounded by two separate sets of wires—one radial, one axial—forming a cylindrical grid array, and finally a dielectric storage material coating on the inside of four segments of an enclosing metal cylinder called the ''signal plates''. The bits were stored as discrete regions of charge on the smooth surface of the signal plates. The two sets of orthogonal grid wires were normally "biased" slightly positive, so that the [[electrons]] from the cathode could flow through the grid and reach the dielectric. The continuous flow of electrons allowed the stored charge to be continuously regenerated by the [[secondary emission]] of electrons. To select a bit to be read from or written to, all but two adjacent wires on each of the two grids were biased negative, allowing current to flow to the dielectric at one location only. Writing was accomplished by selecting a bit, as above, and then sending a pulse of potential, either positive or negative, to the signal plate. With a bit selected, electrons would be pulled onto (with a positive potential) or pushed from (negative potential) the dielectric. When the bias on the grid was dropped, the electrons were trapped on the dielectric as a spot of static electricity. [[Image:Selectron256Xsection.jpg|thumb|300px|Selectron cross section]] To read from the device a bit location was selected and a pulse sent from the cathode. If the dielectric for that bit contained a charge, the electrons would be pushed off the dielectric and read as a brief pulse of current in the signal plate. No such pulse meant that the dielectric must not have held a charge. The smaller capacity 256-bit (128 by 2 bits) "production" device<ref>Rajchman JA (1951) "The Selective Electrostatic Storage Tube", ''RCA Review'' '''12''' (1):53-97 </ref> was in a similar vacuum tube envelope. It was built with two storage arrays of discrete "eyelets" on a rectangular plate, separated by a row of eight cathodes. The pin count was reduced from 44 for the 4096-bit device down to 31 pins and two coaxial signal output connectors. == References == {{reflist}} == Patents == * {{US patent|2494670}} Cylindrical 4096-bit Selectron * {{US patent|2604606}} Planar 256-bit Selectron == External links == * [http://www.computer50.org/mark1/moore.school/selectron.html The Selectron] * [http://www-db.stanford.edu/pub/voy/museum/pictures/display/2-1.htm Early Devices display: Memories] &ndash; has a picture of a 256-bit Selectron about halfway down the page * [http://www.RCASelectron.com History of the RCA Selectron] [[Category:Computer memory]] [[Category:RCA brands]] [[Category:Vacuum tubes]] [[ca:Selectró]] [[es:Selectrón]] [[ja:セレクトロン管]] [[pt:Selectron]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33727</id> <title>Self-avoiding walk</title> <text>[[Image:Self avoiding walk.svg|200px|right]] In mathematics, a '''self-avoiding walk (SAW)''' is a sequence of moves on a [[lattice (group)|lattice]] that does not visit the same point more than once. A '''self-avoiding polygon''' (SAP) is a closed self-avoiding walk on a lattice. SAWs were first introduced by the chemist [[Paul Flory]] in order to model the real-life behavior of chain-like entities such as [[solvent]]s and [[polymer]]s, whose physical volume prohibits multiple occupation of the same spatial point. Very little is known rigorously about the self-avoiding walk from a mathematical perspective, although physicists have provided numerous conjectures that are believed to be true and are strongly supported by numerical simulations. In [[computational physics]] a self-avoiding walk is a chain-like path in <math>\mathbb{R}^2</math> or <math>\mathbb{R}^3</math> with a certain number of nodes, typically a fixed step length and has the imperative property that it doesn't cross itself or another walk. A system of self-avoiding walks satisfies the so called [[excluded volume]] condition. In higher dimensions, the self-avoiding walk is believed to behave much like the ordinary [[random walk]]. SAWs and SAPs play a central role in the modelling of the [[topology|topological]] and [[knot theory|knot-theoretic]] behaviour of thread- and loop-like molecules such as [[protein]]s. The properties of SAWs cannot be calculated analytically, so numerical [[simulation]]s are employed. The pivot algorithm is a common method for [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] simulations for the uniform measure on n-step self-avoiding walks. The pivot algorithm works by taking a self-avoiding walk and randomly choosing a point on this walk, and then applying a symmetry operation (rotations and reflections) on the walk after the nth step to create a new walk. Calculating the number of self-avoiding walks in any given lattice is a common computational problem. There is currently no known formula for determining the number of self-avoiding walks, although there are rigorous methods for approximating them.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hayes B |title=How to Avoid Yourself |journal=American Scientist |volume=86 |issue=4 |pages= |month=Jul–Aug |year=1998 |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/how-to-avoid-yourself/}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Liśkiewicz M, Ogihara M, Toda S |title=The complexity of counting self-avoiding walks in subgraphs of two-dimensional grids and hypercubes |journal=Theoretical Computer Science |volume=304, |issue=1–3 |pages=129–56 |month=July |year=2003 |doi=10.1016/S0304-3975(03)00080-X |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S030439750300080X}}</ref> Finding the number of such paths is conjectured to be an [[NP-hard]] problem.
