Programmer workarounds to prevent this limit from becoming apparent have since been considered an element of Spectrum user culture. ==Causes== Attribute clash on the ZX Spectrum was caused by its idiosyncratic display memory layout, designed in such a way as to minimise memory use of the [[frame buffer]], and optimise for text display instead of graphics. Rather than limit the colour palette to conserve memory, Sinclair's design stored [[pixel]] [[bitmap]] and colour information in separate areas of memory. While the bitmap specified the state of individual pixels (either on or off), the colour information (or "attributes") corresponded to the text character matrix &mdash; 24 rows of 32 columns &mdash; with one [[byte]] per 8x8 pixel character cell. This byte encoded two 3-bit values, known as ''INK'' (foreground colour) and ''PAPER'' (background colour) after the [[BASIC]] instructions used to define the colour values. Two other binary values were included in an attribute; a ''BRIGHT'' bit indicating one of two brightness levels for the two colours, and a ''FLASH'' bit, which, when set, caused the two colours to be swapped at regular intervals. This scheme provided 15 different colours: the eight combinations of red, green and blue at two brightness levels (except for black, which appeared the same at both brightness). Thus, each 8x8 pixel block could only contain 2 colours from the 15 available, which must both be from either the BRIGHT or non-BRIGHT halves of the palette. Trying to add a third colour in an 8x8 pixel area would result in the three colors being reduced to two by the ZX Spectrum. The ZX Spectrum used 6144 bytes for pixel information, with one byte representing a row of eight pixels, and 768 bytes used for the colour attributes, thus giving a total of 6912 bytes for the entire graphics display, a relatively small total for a computer of the Spectrum's era with "colour" capabilities. This graphics architecture was retained right through to Sinclair and [[Amstrad]]'s later redesigns of the Spectrum, up until Amstrad's final model, the ZX Spectrum +3, despite subsequent models having contained 128 kB of RAM, reducing the need to save memory in this manner. The architecture was retained to prevent loss of [[backwards compatibility]]. Attributes were used by a variety of other computers and consoles, including the [[Commodore 64]], the [[MSX]] and [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], although the size of the attribute blocks and the number of colours per block varied. However, with the use of hardware [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] and [[scrolling]], attribute clash could be avoided. The [[Thomson MO5]] and [[Thomson TO7|TO7]] microcomputers, the [[Tangerine_Computer_Systems#Oric-1|Oric 1]], the [[MSX#MSX 1|MSX 1]] [[computer architecture|architecture]], and other systems based on the [[Texas Instruments TMS9918]] [[Video Display Controller]] display a very similar constraint: for each group of eight pixels horizontally, only two colours out of 16 are available. giving a similar but less severe effect than with the Spectrum. The MSX 1 did not have just one single color attribute byte available for a whole 8x8 pixel area, as was the case with the Sinclair Spectrum, but eight, one attribute byte for each 8×1 pixel area. Thus, while the Spectrum was limited to one color pair for a square area of 8x8 pixels, the MSX 1 was only limited to one color pair for a "line" of eight adjacent pixels. In addition MSX1 could use [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] which were not bound to any attribute clash problems (although MSX 1 sprites did have their own limitations). In practice this technical advantage often did not help MSX 1
