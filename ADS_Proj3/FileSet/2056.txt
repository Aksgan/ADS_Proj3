But when HP's early [[microcomputer]]s needed an interface for peripherals ([[disk drive]]s, [[tape drive]]s, [[computer printer|printers]], [[plotter]]s, etc.), HP-IB was readily available and easily adapted to the purpose. HP computer products which used HP-IB included the [[HP series 80]], [[HP 9800 series desktop computers|HP 9800 series]],<ref>{{cite web |title=HP 98135A HP-IB Interface 9815 |url=http://www.hpmuseum.net/display_item.php?hw=463 |work=HP Computer Museum |accessdate=2010-02-06 }}</ref> the [[HP 2100]] series,<ref>{{cite web |title=59310A HP-IB Interface |quote=HP-IB interface for HP1000 and HP2000 computers |url=http://www.hpmuseum.net/display_item.php?hw=522 |work=HP Computer Museum |accessdate=2010-02-06 }}</ref> and the [[HP 3000]] series.<ref>{{cite web |title=27113A HP-IB Interface |quote=CIO HP-IB interface for 3000 Series 900 |url=http://www.hpmuseum.net/display_item.php?hw=786 |work=HP Computer Museum |accessdate=2010-02-06 }}</ref> Some of HP's advanced pocket calculators of the 1980s, such as the [[HP-41]] and [[HP-71B]] series, also had IEEE-488 capabilities, via an optional [[HP-IL]]/HP-IB interface module. Other manufacturers adopted GPIB for their computers as well, such as with the [[Tektronix 405x]] line. The [[Commodore PET]] (introduced 1977) range of personal computers connected their peripherals using the IEEE-488 bus, but with a non-standard card edge connector. Commodore's following 8-bit machines, including the [[Commodore VIC-20|VIC-20]], [[Commodore 64|C-64]], and [[Commodore 128|C-128]], utilized an unrelated, proprietary serial interface, using a round [[DIN connector]], for which they retained the IEEE-488 programming interface and terminology, however. Eventually, faster, more complete standards such as [[SCSI]] superseded IEEE-488 for peripheral access. {{Gallery |width=175 |lines=3 |Image:CBM610 back.jpg|Rear of the [[Commodore CBM-II]] showing [[card edge connector]] IEEE-488 port |Image:SFD1001 back.jpg|Rear of the [[Commodore International|Commodore]] SFD 1001 [[floppy disk drive]] with IEEE-488 port |Image:Digitaloszilloskop Schnittstellen IMGP1974 WP.jpg|Rear of a [[Tektronix]] TDS 210 digital [[oscilloscope]] with IEEE-488 port |Image:Data Acquisition Agilent %282%29.jpg|Rear view of an [[Agilent]] 34970A [[data acquisition]] chassis / [[multimeter]] }} ==Advantages and disadvantages== {{Unreferenced section|date=February 2010}} ===Advantages=== * Simple hardware interface * Ease of connecting multiple device to a single host * Allows mixing of slow and fast devices * Well-established and mature, widely supported ===Disadvantages=== * Mechanically bulky connectors and cables * Limited speed and expansion * Lack of command protocol standards (before SCPI) * Implementation options (e.g. end of transmission handling) can complicate interoperability in pre-IEEE-488.2 devices * No mandatory galvanic isolation between bus and devices * High cost (compared to RS-232/[[USB]]/Firewire/Ethernet) * Limited availability (again compared to RS-232/USB/Firewire/Ethernet) ==See also== {{Commons category|IEEE 488}} * [[Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments]] (SCPI) * [[LAN eXtensions for Instrumentation]] (LXI) * [[Virtual Instrument Software Architecture]] (VISA) * [[HP series 80]] * [[Rocky Mountain BASIC]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * {{Cite book|title=IEC-60488-1: Higher performance protocol for the standard digital interface for programmable instrumentation |volume=Part 1: General |publisher=International Electrotechnical Commission |date=15 July 2004 |url=http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/artnum/032787 }} * {{Cite book|title=IEC-60488-2: Standard digital interface for programmable instrumentation |volume=Part 2: Codes, formats, protocols and common commands |publisher=International Electrotechnical Commission |date=7 May 2004 |url=http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/ArtNum_PK/32175 }} {{Computer-bus}} {{IEEE standards}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Ieee-488}} [[Category:Computer buses]] [[Category:IEEE standards]] [[Category:Electronic test equipment]] [[ca:IEEE-488]] [[cs:GPIB]] [[de:IEC-625-Bus]] [[es:GPIB]] [[fa:گذرگاه واسط همه‌منظوره]] [[fr:IEEE-488]] [[hr:GPIB]] [[it:IEEE 488]] [[nl:IEEE-488]] [[ja:IEEE 488]] [[pl:IEEE-488]] [[pt:IEEE-488]] [[ro:IEEE-488]] [[ru:IEEE-488]] [[sk:IEEE-488]] [[tr:IEEE-488]]</text> </page> <page> <id>17471</id> <title>IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking</title> <text>{{italictitle}} {{Infobox journal | title = IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking | cover = | editor = [[Roch Guerin]] | discipline = [[Communication networks]] | language = | abbreviation = | publisher = [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] and [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] | country = USA | frequency = 6 times a year | history = 1993 to present | openaccess = | license = | impact = | impact-year = | website = http://www.ton.seas.upenn.edu/ | link1 = | link1-name = | link2 = | link2-name = | RSS = | atom = | JSTOR = | OCLC = | LCCN = | CODEN = | ISSN = 1063-6692 | eISSN = | boxwidth = }} '''''IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking''''' is a [[scientific journal]] that focuses on [[communication networks]].
