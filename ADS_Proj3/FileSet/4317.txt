Non-systematic convolutional codes can provide better performance under maximum-likelihood ([[Viterbi decoder|Viterbi]]) decoding. * In [[DVB-H]], for additional error protection and power efficiency for mobile receivers, a systematic Reed-Solomon code is employed as an erasure code over packets within a [[burst transmission|data burst]], where each packet is protected with a [[CRC]]: data in verified packets count as correctly received symbols, and if all are received correctly, evaluation of the additional parity data can be omitted, and receiver devices can switch off reception until the start of the next burst. * [[Fountain code]]s may be either systematic or non-systematic: as they do not exhibit a fixed [[code rate]], the set of source symbols is diminishing among the possible output set. ==Notes== <references/> ==References== * {{cite book | author=Shu Lin, Daniel J.

It is an attempt at developing logical, mathematical, engineering and philosophical paradigms and frameworks in which physical, technological, biological, social, [[cognitive]], and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] systems can be studied and modeled. The term "systemics" was coined in the 1970s by [[Mario Bunge]] and others, as an alternative paradigm for research related to [[systems theory|general systems theory]] and [[systems science]].<ref name = "MB 79"> [[Mario Bunge]] (1979).

This field is closely related to [[operations research]]. It is also "an explicit formal inquiry carried out to help someone (referred to as the decision maker) identify a better course of action and make a better decision than he might otherwise have made."<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070822025602/http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/ASC/SYSTEM_ANALY.html SYSTEMS ANALYSIS]</ref> ==Overview== The terms [[analysis]] and [[wiktionary:synthesis|synthesis]] come from Greek where they mean respectively "to take apart" and "to put together". These terms are in [[scientific discipline]]s from mathematics and logic to economy and psychology to denote similar investigative procedures. Analysis is defined as the procedure by which we break down an intellectual or substantial whole into parts. Synthesis is defined as the procedure by which we combine separate elements or components in order to form a coherent whole.<ref>Tom Ritchey, [http://www.swemorph.com/pdf/anaeng-r.pdf Analysis and .</ref> Systems analysis researchers apply [[methodology]] to the analysis of systems involved to form an overall picture. System analysis is used in every field where there is a work of developing something. ==Information technology== The development of a computer-based information system includes a systems analysis phase which produces or enhances the [[data model]] which itself is a precursor to creating or enhancing a [[database]] (see [[Christopher J. Date]] "An Introduction to Database Systems"). There are a number of different approaches to system analysis. When a computer-based information system is developed, systems analysis (according to the [[Waterfall model]]) would constitute the following steps: * The development of a feasibility study, involving determining whether a project is economically, socially, technologically and organizationally feasible. * Conducting fact-finding measures, designed to ascertain the requirements of the system's end-users. These typically span interviews, questionnaires, or visual observations of work on the existing system. * Gauging how the end-users would operate the system (in terms of general experience in using computer hardware or software), what the system would be used for etc. Another view outlines a phased approach to the process. This approach breaks systems analysis into 5 phases: * Scope definition * Problem analysis * Requirements analysis * Logical design * Decision analysis [[Use case]]s are a widely-used systems analysis modeling tool for identifying and expressing the functional requirements of a system. Each use case is a business scenario or event for which the system must provide a defined response. Use cases evolved out of object-oriented analysis; however, their use as a modeling tool has become common in many other methodologies for system analysis and design. ==Practitioners== Practitioners of systems analysis are often called
