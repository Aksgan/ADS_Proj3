of representing the game in this way is that it is clear what the order of play is. The tree shows clearly that player 1 moves first and player 2 observes this move. However, in some games play does not occur like this. One player does not always observe the choice of another (for example, moves may be simultaneous or a move may be hidden). An '''[[information set (game theory)|information set]]''' is a set of decision nodes such that: # Every node in the set belongs to one player. # When play reaches the information set, the player with the move cannot differentiate between nodes within the information set; i.e. if the information set contains more than one node, the player to whom that set belongs does not know which node in the set has been reached. In extensive form, an information set is indicated by a dotted line connecting all nodes in that set or sometimes by a loop drawn around all the nodes in that set. [[Image:Extensive form game 2.JPG|300px|left|thumb|A game with imperfect information represented in extensive form]] If a game has an information set with more than one member that game is said to have '''[[imperfect information]]'''. A game with '''perfect information''' is such that at any stage of the game, every player knows exactly what has taken place earlier in the game; i.e. every information set is a [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] set. Any game without perfect information has imperfect information. The game on the left is the same as the above game except that player 2 does not know what player 1 does when he comes to play. The first game described has perfect information; the game on the left does not. If both players are rational and both know that both players are rational and everything that is known by any player is known to be known by every player (i.e. player 1 knows player 2 knows that player 1 is rational and player 2 knows this, etc. ''ad infinitum''), play in the first game will be as follows: player 1 knows that if he plays ''U'', player 2 will play ''D' '' (because for player 2 a payoff of 1 is preferable to a payoff of 0) and so player 1 will receive 2. However, if player 1 plays ''D'', player 2 will play ''U' '' (because to player 2 a payoff of 2 is better than a payoff of 1) and player 1 will receive 1. Hence, in the first game, the equilibrium will be (''U'', ''D' '') because player 1 prefers to receive 2 to 1 and so will play ''U'' and so player 2 will play ''D' ''. In the second game it is less clear: player 2 cannot observe player 1's move. Player 1 would like to fool player 2 into thinking he has played ''U'' when he has actually played ''D'' so that player 2 will play ''D' '' and player 1 will receive 3. In fact in the second game there is a [[perfect Bayesian equilibrium]] where player 1 plays ''D'' and player 2 plays ''U' '' and player 2 holds the belief that player will definitely play ''D''. In this equilibrium, every strategy is rational given the beliefs held and every belief is consistent with the strategies played. Notice how the imperfection of information changes the outcome of the game. In games with infinite action spaces and imperfect information, non-singleton information sets are represented, if necessary, by inserting a dotted line connecting the (non-nodal) endpoints behind the arc described above or by dashing the arc itself. In the Stackelberg game described above, if the second player had not observed the first player's move the game would no longer fit the Stackelberg model; it would be [[Cournot competition]]. ==Incomplete information== It may be the case that a player does not know exactly what the payoffs of the game are or of what '''type''' his opponents are. This sort of game has '''[[incomplete information]]'''. In extensive form it is represented as a game with complete but imperfect information using the so called '''[[John Harsanyi|Harsanyi]] transformation'''. This transformation introduces to the game the notion of ''[[move by nature|nature's choice]]'' or ''God's choice''. Consider a game consisting of an employer considering whether to hire a job applicant. The job applicant's ability might be one of two things: high or low. His ability level is random; he is low ability with probability 1/3 and high ability with probability 2/3. In this case, it is convenient to model nature as another player of sorts who chooses the applicant's ability according to those probabilities. Nature however does not have any payoffs. Nature's choice is represented in the game tree by a non-filled node. Edges coming from a nature's choice node are labelled with the probability of the event it represents occurring. [[Image:Extensive form game 3.1.JPG|300px|left|thumb|A game with complete but imperfect information represented in extensive form]] The game on the left is one of complete information (all the players and payoffs are known to everyone) but of imperfect information (the employer doesn't know what was nature's move.) The initial node is in the centre and it is not filled, so nature moves first. Nature selects with the same probability the type of player 1 (which in this game is tantamount to selecting the payoffs in the subgame played), either t1 or t2. Player 1 has distinct information sets for these; i.e. player 1 knows what type he is (this need not be the case). However, player 2 does not observe nature's choice. He does not know the type of player 1; however, in this game he does observe player 1's actions; i.e. there is perfect information. Indeed, it is now appropriate to alter the above definition of perfect information: at every stage in the game, every player knows what has been played ''by the other players''. In the case of complete information, every player knows what has been played by nature. Information sets are represented as
