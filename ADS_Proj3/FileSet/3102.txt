If that's right, then the same could be said for other, more restrictive copyright laws, as well (see, e.g., Mexico's copyright term of life of the author plus 100 years and France's copyright over fashion designs).

The [[Communications protocol|protocol]] is the product of a joint [[standardization]] project guided by the Joint Committee on the NTCIP, which is composed of six representatives each from the [[National Electrical Manufacturers Association]] (NEMA), the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO), and the [[Institute of Transportation Engineers]] (ITE). The Joint Committee has in turn formed 14 technical working groups to develop and maintain the standards, and has initiated or produced over 50 standards and information reports.<ref name="history">[http://www.nema.org/stds/ntcip.cfm NEMA - NTCIP]</ref> The project receives funding under a contract with the [[United States Department of Transportation]] (USDOT) and is part of a wider effort to develop a comprehensive family of [[Intelligent Transportation System]] (ITS) standards.<ref name="usdot">[http://www.standards.its.dot.gov/ US Department of Transportation ITS Standards Program]</ref> ==History of the NTCIP Development== NEMA initiated the development of the NTCIP in 1992. In early 1993, the US Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) brought together transportation industry representatives to discuss obstacles to installing field equipment for new Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). The representatives said that the number one priority was the need for an industry-wide standard data communications protocol. Since the NEMA Transportation Section members had already started work on a new industry standard, they offered to expedite and expand the scope of their activities.text. The key objectives of the new NTCIP protocol were the interchangeability of similar roadside devices, and the interoperability of different types of devices on the same communications channel. In 1996, the FHWA suggested a partnership of standards developing organizations to expand both user and industry involvement. AASHTO and ITE signed an agreement with NEMA to establish the Joint Committee on the NTCIP, and to work together on developing and maintaining the NTCIP standards.<ref name="history">[http://www.nema.org/stds/ntcip.cfm NEMA - NTCIP]</ref> ==NTCIP Benefits== NTCIP standards offer increased flexibility and choices for agencies operating transportation management systems. NTCIP standards usage removes barriers to interagency coordination and allows equipment of different types and different manufacturers to be mixed on the same communications
