It is a web-based application written in [[PHP]] and using either a [[MySQL]] database or a [[Virtuoso Universal Server|Virtuoso triple store]]. In contrast to most semantic wikis, OntoWiki is form-based rather than syntax-based, and thus tries to hide as much of the complexity of knowledge representation formalisms from users as possible. OntoWiki is mainly being developed by the [http://aksw.org Agile Knowledge Engineering and Semantic Web (AKSW) research group] at the [[University of Leipzig]], a group also known for the [[DBpedia]] project among others, in collaboration with volunteers around the world. In 2009 the AKSW research group got a budget of 425,000€ from the [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany]] for the development of the OntoWiki.<ref>[http://idw-online.de/pages/de/news300375 "OntoWiki" hilft Daten im Web zu verknüpfen] (German)</ref> In 2010 OntoWiki became part of the technology stack supporting the LOD2 (Linked Open Data) project.

The effectiveness of ontology based data integration is closely tied to the consistency and expressivity of the ontology used in the integration process. ==Background== Data from multiple sources are characterized by multiple types of heterogeneity.

Qian]</ref>: * [[Syntactic Heterogeneity]]: is a result of differences in representation format of data * [[Schematic or Structural Heterogeneity]]: the native model or structure to store data differ in [[data source]]s leading to structural heterogeneity. Schematic heterogeneity that particularly appears in structured databases is also an aspect of structural heterogeneity <ref name="sheth"/>. * [[Semantic Heterogeneity]]: differences in interpretation of the 'meaning' of data are source of semantic heterogeneity * [[System Heterogeneity]]: use of different [[operating system]], hardware platforms lead to system heterogeneity [[ontology (computer science)|Ontologies]], as formal models of representation with explicitly defined concepts and named relationships linking them, are used to address the issue of [[semantic heterogeneity]] in data sources. In domains like [[bioinformatics]] and [[biomedicine]], the rapid development, adoption and public availability of ontologies [http://www.bioontology.org/repositories.html#obo] has made it possible for the [[data integration]] community to leverage them for [[semantic integration]] of data and information. ==The Role of Ontologies== Ontologies enable the unambiguous identification of entities in heterogeneous information systems and assertion of applicable named relationships that connect these entities together. Specifically, ontologies play the following roles: * Content Explication <ref name="wache"/> The ontology enables accurate interpretation of data from multiple sources through the explicit definition of terms and relationships in the ontology. * Query Model <ref name="wache"/> In some systems like SIMS <ref name="arens">{{cite conference | author= Y. Arens, C. Hsu, C.A. Knoblock | title=Query Processing in sims information mediator | year=1996 | url=http://isi.edu/sims/papers/96arpibook.ps}}</ref>, the query is formulated using the ontology as a global query schema. * Verification <ref name="wache"/> The ontology verifies the mappings used to integrate data from multiple sources. These mappings may either be user specified or generated by a system. ===Approaches using ontologies for data Integration=== There are three main architectures that are implemented in ontology-based data integration applications, <ref name="wache"/> namely, ;Single ontology approach: A single ontology is used as a global reference model in the system. This is the simplest approach as it can be simulated by other approaches. <ref name="wache"/> SIMS <ref name="arens">{{cite conference | author= Y. Arens, C. Hsu, C.A. Knoblock | title=Query Processing in sims information mediator | year=1996 | url=http://isi.edu/sims/papers/96arpibook.ps}}</ref> is a prominent example of this approach. ;Multiple ontologies: Multiple ontologies, each modeling an individual data source, are used in combination for integration. Though, this approach is more flexible than the single ontology approach, it requires creation of mappings between the multiple ontologies. Ontology mapping is a challenging issue and is focus of large number of research efforts in [[computer science]] [http://www.ontologymatching.org/]. The OBSERVER system <ref name="mena">{{cite conference | author= E. Mena, V. Kashyap, A. Sheth, A.
