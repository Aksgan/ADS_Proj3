changed somewhat, and most owners preferred it over the 760/860. In March 2005 the C3000 product was joined by the SL-C1000 which returned to the traditional 128 MB flash memory but lost the internal microdrive. The C1000 was cheaper, lighter, faster in execution due to running from flash memory, but of course would require the user to "waste" the SD or CF card slots to fit a memory card for mass storage; at the time the largest card supported was 1GB. Unfortunately, the C1000 cannot be upgraded to fit an internal microdrive because vital components are missing, but one intrepid Zaurus owner used the space to fit internal Bluetooth and Wi-Fi modules using the USB host facility. In June 2005, Sharp released the SL-C3100, which had flash capacity of the C1000 yet also had the microdrive, and proved a very popular model indeed. The 1000, 3000 and 3100 models proved to be quite overclockable, boosting the device's ability to play back video more smoothly. In March 2006 the latest model launched, predictably labelled as the SL-C3200. It is basically an SL-C3100 but with the newer 6 GB Hitachi microdrive and another tweak to the case colours. The Intel PXA270 CPU is a later variant, and some would regard as inferior because it cannot be overclocked so highly. The kernel gained a vital tweak to the Sharp proprietary SD/MMC module and allowed 4GB SD cards to be used (and this was quickly borrowed by 3000 and 3100 owners). The software package gained text to speech software from [[Nuance Communications]] and an upgraded dictionary. While the SL series devices have long been sold only in Japan, there are companies in Japan who specialise in exporting them worldwide; they usually do so without modifying them at all, sometimes an English conversion is available and might be at extra cost. Not all Zaurus models came from Sharp with universal (100/110/240V) power supplies (the Zaurus takes a regulated 5V/1A supply), so either an additional or an exchanged power adaptor would be needed, and not all exporters provide this by default. Note that when buying directly from an exporter in Japan, the buyer is liable for import duties and taxes, and attempting to avoid them can be a criminal offense. There are also companies in the US, UK and DE who are unofficial resellers; one notable example is Trisoft who prepare and certify the device to "CE" standard compliance. Since there is no official export channel from Japan, Sharp offers no warranty or repair service outside Japan, so foreign buyers are dependent on their chosen reseller to handle repairs, usually by sending to their agent in Japan who acts as if the device was owned and used in Japan in order to have it repaired by Sharp, before sending it back to the owner. Whilst Zauruses are actually quite robust devices, due to their miniaturization they are not easily repairable by casual electronics hobbyists. In January 2007, it was reported that Sharp would discontinue production of the Zaurus line after February 2007. [http://www.geek.com/news/geeknews/2007Jan/bpd20070122001750.htm]. Later, in March, a leading European supplier tried to buy a batch of Zauruses as demand was still strong and noticed that they were all manufactured after Sharp's original cut-off date, however, Sharp was not able to explain its plans, and fans of the Zaurus are still unsure of the fate of the device. Without clarification from Sharp, it would seem their intention is to abandon the Linux powered devices, as their newest units are the WS003SH and WS004SH which, whilst adding wireless and cellular phone and data features, run the Windows Mobile 5.0 operating system/application suite. == Models == [[Image:Sharp Zaurus SL-C1000 -- open 1280x960.jpg|thumb|A Sharp Zaurus SL-C1000, displaying [[Midnight Commander]].]] * '''Personal Information (PI) series''' ** '''Pi² T''', proof of concept model presented in April 1992 ** '''PI-3000''', the first model, introduced to the Japanese market on October 1, 1993 ** '''PI-4000/FX''', second generation with ''ink''<!-- the press release mentions インク, I suppose this is the kanji handwriting recognition --> and fax capabilities, on sale in Japan June 1994 ** '''PI-5000/FX/DA''', first model capable of syncing data to a personal computer, going on sale in November 1994. ** '''PI-4500''', introduced in January 1995 ** '''PI-6000/FX''', featuring a new handwriting recognition software, on sale in Japan August 1995. ** '''PI-6000DA''', adding a digital adapter for [[cellular phone]]s, introduced on December 12, 1995 ** '''PI-7000''', dubbed ''AccessZaurus'' (アクセスザウルス) sports a built in modem, is introduced in February 1996. *** Note: Confusingly, Sharp made another unit called the "PI-7000 ExpertPad", which was a [[Apple Newton|Newton]] based device, not a Zaurus. ** '''PI-6500''', was introduced to the Japanese market with a list price of 55,000 [[Yen]] on November 22, 1996.
