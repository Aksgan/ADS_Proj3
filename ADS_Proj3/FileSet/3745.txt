The woman in this image is holding an object which contains a smaller image of her holding the same object, which in turn contains a smaller image of herself holding the same object, and so forth.]] '''Recursion''' is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way. For instance, when the surfaces of two mirrors are exactly parallel with each other the nested images that occur are a form of infinite recursion. The term has a variety of meanings specific to a variety of disciplines ranging from [[linguistics]] to [[logic]]. The most common application of recursion is in [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], in which it refers to a method of defining [[function (mathematics)|functions]] in which the function being defined is applied within its own definition; specifically it is defining an infinite statement using finite components. The term is also used more generally to describe a process of repeating objects in a self-similar way. ==Formal definitions of recursion== [[File:Screenshot Recursion via vlc.png|thumb|Recursion in a screen recording program, where the smaller window contains a snapshot of the entire screen.]] In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], a class of objects or methods exhibit recursive behavior when they can be defined by two properties: # A simple base case (or cases), and # A set of rules which reduce all other cases toward the base case. For example, the following is a recursive definition of a person's ancestors: *One's [[parent]]s are one's [[ancestor]]s (''base case''). *The parents of one's ancestors are also one's ancestors (''recursion step''). The [[Fibonacci sequence]] is a classic example of recursion: * Fib(0) is 0 [base case] * Fib(1) is 1 [base case] * For all integers n > 1: Fib(n) is (Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2)) [recursive definition] A convenient mental model of recursion defines the recursive object (whether that object is an equation, an algorithm, an image, or a rule) in terms of "previously defined" objects of the same class. For example: How do you move a stack of 100 boxes? Answer: you move one box, remember where you put it, and then solve the smaller problem: how do you move a stack of 99 boxes? Eventually, you're left with the problem of how to move a single box, which you know how to do. Many mathematical axioms are based upon recursive rules. For example, the formal definition of the [[natural number]]s in [[set theory]] follows: 1 is a natural number, and each natural number has a successor, which is also a natural number. By this base case and recursive rule, one can generate the set of all natural numbers A more humorous illustration goes: ''"To understand recursion, you must first understand recursion."'' Or perhaps more accurate is the following, from [[Andrew Plotkin]]: ''"If you already know what recursion is, just remember the answer. Otherwise, find someone who is standing closer to [[Douglas Hofstadter]] than you are; then ask him or her what recursion is."'' Recursively defined mathematical objects include [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, [[set (mathematics)|sets]], and especially [[fractal]]s. ==Recursion in language== Linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] theorizes that unlimited extension of a language such as [[English language|English]] is possible using the recursive device of embedding phrases within sentences. Thus, a chatty person may say, ''"Dorothy, who met the wicked Witch of the West in Munchkin Land where her wicked Witch sister was killed, liquidated her with a pail of water."'' Clearly, two simple sentences—''"Dorothy met the Wicked Witch of the West in Munchkin Land"'' and ''"Her sister was killed in Munchkin Land"''—can be embedded in a third sentence, ''"Dorothy liquidated her with a pail of water,"'' to obtain a very verbose sentence. The idea that recursion is an essential property of human language (as Chomsky suggests) is challenged by [[linguistics|linguist]] [[Daniel Everett]] in his work ''Cultural Constraints on Grammar and Cognition in Pirahã: Another Look at the Design Features of Human Language'', in which he hypothesizes that cultural factors made recursion unnecessary in the development of the [[Pirahã language]]. This concept, which
