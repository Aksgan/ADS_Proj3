user to a new set of sub-goals and services inferred from the conceptual model. The electronic services provided via standardized [[Web Service]] interface can be directly invoked. Finally, the citizen obtains all available information on the life event customized to his/her case, and has also the possibility to execute the actions required for particular services needed for the accomplishing of the life event. The Personal Assistant client was implemented as a web application using [[JavaServer Faces|JSF]] technology. Layout, structure, and ordering of tabs in the interface are dynamically created from the annotated services and are customized according to the conditions of the given user. ==References== {{reflist}} == External links == * [http://www.accessegov.org/ Access-eGov Project Home] ** [http://www.accessegov.org/acegov/web/uk/index.jsp?id=50268 Public Deliverables] ** [http://www.accessegov.org/acegov/web/uk/index.jsp?id=50035 List of Publications] * [http://ec.europa.eu/research/fp6/index_en.cfm Sixth Framework Programme home page] * [http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm European Commission] ==Related Projects== * [http://www.egovernet.org eGOVERNET] * [http://www.egovrtd2020.org eGovRTD2020] * [http://www.ontogov.com OntoGov] * [http://www.sake-project.org SAKE] * [http://www.semantic-gov.org SemanticGov] * [http://www.terregov.eupm.net/my_spip/index.php Terregov] * [http://dip.semanticweb.org DIP Integrated Project] * other, see [http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/egovernment/research/fp6_projects/index_en.htm List of FP6 EU-funded eGovernment research projects] {{Use dmy dates|date=November 2010}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Access-Egov}} [[Category:European Commission projects]] [[Category:FP6 Projects]] [[Category:Semantic Web]] [[Category:European Union and science and technology]] [[Category:Public administration]]</text> </page> <page> <id>785</id> <title>Access control vestibule</title> <text>The '''Access Control Vestibule''' (ACV) is a [[security]] screening system for the [[detection]] of individuals carrying [[weapons]] into any facility without [[authorization]], therefore minimizing the possibility of an [[armed]] takeover. The ACV is composed of an [[aluminum]] frame, separate entrance and exit doors, a [[metal detection]] system, and [[bullet-proof glass]]. If a weapon is detected, the doors to the ACV automatically lock.<ref>http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5992094.html</ref> The ACV is typically used in [[bank]]s and other secure facilities.<ref>http://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/stories/2007/06/18/daily18.html?from_rss=1</ref> == Patent == Novacomm, Inc. patented the ACV in 1994. == Technology == The ACV incorporates several [[security]] [[technologies]] that security [[personnel]] can use to assist with the [[screening]] process. Included are: 1) an [[intercom]] for communications; 2) optional [[camera]] so personnel can see the individual requesting [[access]]; 3) [[metal detector]] to ferret out any [[weapons]] that may be present on the individual requesting access; and 4) [[access control]] for physical access to the business. When a customer enters the vestibule a passive [[infrared detector]] senses that someone is present within the enclosure, locking the doors behind and in front of him/her, thus forming a [[mantrap]]. The door behind the person is locked to prevent [[Piggybacking (security)|piggybacking]]. Both doors are secured using [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] locks. At no time is the person inside the entrance of the [[mantrap]] prevented from leaving through the door they first entered, but the inside door to the inner sanctum of the business cannot be opened until the [[metal detector]] has determined that no weapons are present.<ref>http://www.securitysales.com/t_news_print.aspx?action=article&storyID=3237</ref> ==See also== *[[Mantrap]] *[[Bullet-proof glass]] *[[access control]] *[[security]] == References == {{reflist}} == External links == * [http://novaacu.com/ Novacomm, Inc.] - The manufacturer of the Access Control Vestibule * [http://www.novaacu.com/blog/ Conversations about Access Control Vestibules] * [http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5992094.html ACV Patent] * [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIgAYh_7z2Y Bank Robber trapped in ACV] * [http://www.guardiansecureentrance.com/accesscontrolvestibule_article.html [[Category:Access control]]</text> </page> <page> <id>788</id> <title>Access structure</title> <text>'''Access structures''' are used in the study of security system where multiple parties need to work together to obtain a resource. Groups of parties that are granted access are called qualified. In [[set theory|set theoretic]] terms they are referred to as qualified sets. In turn, the set of all such qualified sets is called the access structure of the system. Less formally it is a description of who needs to cooperate with whom in order to access the resource. In its original use in [[cryptography]], the resource was a secret [[secret sharing|shared]] among the participants. Only subgroups of participants contained in the access structure, are able to join their shares to recompute the secret. More generally, the resource can also be a task that a group of people can complete together, such as creating a [[digital signature]], or decrypting an encrypted message. It is reasonable to assume that access structures are [[monotone]] in the sense that, if a subset S is in the access structure, all sets that contain S as a subset should also form part of the access structure. ==See also== * [[Access control]] * [[Secret sharing]] * [[Threshold cryptosystem]] [[Category:Access control]] {{crypto-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>789</id> <title>Access token</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=August 2010}} In [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating system]]s, an '''access token''' contains the security information for a [[login session]] and identifies the [[user (computing)|user]], the user's groups, and the user's privileges. ==Overview== An ''access token'' is an [[Object Manager (Windows)|object]] encapsulating the [[security descriptor]] of a [[Process (computing)|process]].<ref name="atoken">{{cite web | url = http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Aa374909.aspx | title = Access Tokens | publisher = [[MSDN]] | accessdate = 2007-10-08}}</ref> Attached to a process, a security descriptor identifies the owner of the object (in this case, the process) and [[Access Control List|ACL]]s that specifies accessing rights allowed or denied to the owner of the object.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa379563.aspx | title = Security Descriptors | accessdate = 2007-10-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa379557.aspx | title = Securable Objects | accessdate = 2007-10-08}}</ref> While a token is used to represent only the security information, it is technically free-form and can enclose any data. The access token is used by Windows when the process or thread tries to interact with objects whose security descriptors enforce access control (''securable objects'').<ref name="atoken"/> An access token is represented by the [[Object Manager (Windows)|system object]] of type <code>Token</code>. Because a token is a regular system object, access to a token itself can be [[access control|controlled]] by attaching a [[security descriptor]], but it is generally never done in practice. The access token is generated by the [[login|logon]] service when a user logs on to the system and the credentials provided by the user are authenticated against the authentication database, by specifying the rights the user has in the [[security descriptor]] enclosed by the token. The token is attached to every process created by the user session (processes whose owner is the user).<ref name="atoken"/> Whenever such a process accesses any resource which has [[access control]] enabled, Windows looks up in the security descriptor in the access
