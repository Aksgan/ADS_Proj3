requires one or multiple tall (39U) rack(s). A variant of the Altix 3000 with graphics capability is known as the [[SGI Prism|Prism]]. It is based on the third generation NUMAflex [[distributed shared memory]] architecture and it uses the [[NUMAlink#NUMAlink 4|NUMAlink 4]] interconnection fabric. The Altix 3000 supports a single system image of 64 processors. If there are more than 64 processors in a system, then the system must be partitioned. The basic building block is the C-brick. Each C-brick contains two nodes. A C-brick is a 4U high rackmount unit. Each node contains two [[Intel]] [[Itanium|Itanium 2]] processors which connects to the Super-Bedrock [[Application specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] through a single [[front side bus]]. The Super-Bedrock ASIC is a [[crossbar]] for the processors, the local RAM, the network interface and the I/O interface. The two Super-Bedrock ASICs in each brick are connected internally by a single 6.4 GB/s NUMAlink 4 channel. A processor node also contains 16 [[DIMM]] slots that accept standard [[DDR1]] DIMMs with capacities of 4 to 16 GB. === Altix 3700 Bx2 === The '''Altix 3700 Bx2''' is a high-end model supporting 16 to 2,048 Itanium 2 processors and 12 GB to 24 TB of memory. It requires one or multiple tall (40U) rack(s). == Altix 4000 == The '''Altix 4000''' is Silicon Graphics' current Itanium-based product line. It is composed of two models, the '''Altix 450''', a mid-range server, and the '''Altix 4700''', a high-end server. An Altix 4700 system can contain up to 2048 dual-core Itanium 2 and Itanium ("Montvale" revision) microprocessor sockets, which are connected by the [[NUMAlink|NUMAlink 4]] interconnect in a [[fat tree]] network topology.<ref>[http://www.sgi.com/products/servers/altix/4000/configs.html SGI Altix 4700: Configurations]</ref> The microprocessors are accompanied by up to 128 TB of memory (192TB with single microprocessor socket blades and 16GB DIMMs). These systems are based on nodes contained within a [[Blade (computing)|blade]] that plugs into an enclosure, the individual rack unit (IRU). The IRU is a 10U enclosure that contains the necessary components to support the blades such as the power supplies, two router boards (one for every five blades) and a L1 controller. Each IRU can support ten single-wide blades or two double-wide blades and eight single-width blades. The IRUs are mounted in 42U-high rack, and each rack supports up to four IRUs. There are two types of node, processor and memory, which are contained within a blade. Compute blades contain a processor node and consist of two PAC611 sockets for Itanium 2 and Itanium microprocessors, a Super-Hub (SHub) [[application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASIC) ([[chipset]]) and eight [[dual in-line memory module]] (DIMM) slots for memory. The number of microprocessor sockets in a compute blade is one or two. One-processor socket configurations provide more bandwidth as only one microprocessor socket is using the front side bus and local memory. Two-processor socket configurations do not support hyperthreading. Memory blades are used to expand the amount of memory without increasing the number of processors. They contain a SHub ASIC and 12 DIMM slots. Both compute and memory blades support 1, 2 4, 8, and 16 GB DIMMs. SGI support does not currently support any installations with 16GB DIMMs. Multiple servers in configurations described above can be combined on the same Numalink fabric up to the theoretical maximum of 8,192 nodes (16,384 OS cpus). == Altix XE == The '''Altix XE''' servers are based on Intel [[Xeon]] [[x86-64]]-architecture processors. Models include the: * '''Altix XE210''' server supported up to two Dual or Quad-Core Intel Xeon processors, 5100 Series or 5300 series, 32GB DDR2 667 MHz FBDIMM memory, 1 x PCIe x8 (low profile) and 1 x PCI-X 133 MHz (full height) PCI slots, and Three SATA/SAS drive bays. * '''Altix XE240''' server supported up to two Dual or Quad-Core Intel Xeon processors, 5100 Series or 5300 series, 32GB DDR2 667 MHz FBDIMM memory, two PCI slots configuration options (option 1: 2 x PCIe x4 (low profile), 2 x PCIe x4 (full height), 1 x PCEe x8 (full height); or option 2: 2 x PCIe x4 (low profile), 3 x PCI-X 133 MHz (full height), 1 x PCI-X 133 MHz (full height), and Five SATA/SAS drive bays. * '''Altix XE250''' server * '''Altix XE270''' server is a 2U configuration with Intel Xeon processor 5500 series, Choice of up to 18 DDR3 DIMMs (2GB, 4GB, or 8GB DIMMs), 2 x PCIe x8 gen 2 (low profile), 1 x PCIe x4 gen 1 (low profile), 2 x PCI-x 133/100 (low profile) PCI slots, Eight SATA or SAS drive bays with optional hardware RAID (0, 1, 5, 6, 10), * '''Altix XE310''' server was introduced January 8, 2007 and contained two nodes per XE310, up to four Dual or Quad-Core Intel Itanium Xeon processors, 5100 Series or 5300 series (two per node), 64GB DDR2 667 MHz FBDIMM memory (32GB per node), 2 x PCIe x8 (1 per node) PCI slots, and Four SATA/SAS drive bays (two per node). * '''Altix XE320''' server * '''Altix XE340''' server contains 2 compute nodes within a 1U configuration, Intel Xeon processor 5500 series, Choice of up to 12 DDR3 DIMMs per node (2GB, 4GB, or 8GB DIMMs), 2 x PCIe x16 (1 per node) - low profile PCI slot, and Four SATA drive bays (2 per node) with optional SAS and hardware RAID 0, 1. * '''Altix XE500''' server is a 3U configuration with Intel Xeon processor 5500 series, Choice of up to 18 DDR3 DIMMs (2GB, 4GB, or 8GB DIMMs), 2 x PCIe x16 gen2 (full height) and 4 x PCIe x8 gen2 (full height) PCI slots, and Eight SATA or SAS drives with optional hardware RAID (0, 1, 5, 6, 10). * '''Altix XE1200''' cluster * '''Altix XE1300''' cluster All Altix XE systems supported Novell SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and Microsoft Windows. Later, VMware support was added across the Altix XE product line. == Altix ICE == The '''Altix ICE''' blade platform is an Intel Xeon-based system featuring diskless compute blades and a Hierarchical Management Framework (HMF) for scalability, performance, and resiliency.
