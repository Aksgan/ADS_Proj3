Animation historian Joe Adamson counts ''A Wild Hare'' as the first "official" Bugs Bunny short.<ref name="Adamson">{{Cite book|title=Bugs Bunny: 50 Years and Only One Grey Hare|first=Joe|last=Adamson|year=1990|publisher=Henry Holt|isbn=0-8050-1855-7}}</ref> Bugs's second appearance in Jones's ''[[Elmer's Pet Rabbit]]'' introduces the audience to the name Bugs Bunny, which until then had only been used among the Termite Terrace employees. It was also the first short where he received billing under his now-famous name, but the card, "featuring Bugs Bunny", was just slapped on the end of the completed short's opening titles when ''A Wild Hare'' proved an unexpected success. The rabbit here is in look and voice identical to the one in Jones' earlier ''Elmer's Candid Camera''. Bugs in his ''Wild Hare'' likeness appeared in five more shorts during 1941. ''[[Tortoise Beats Hare]]'', directed by Tex Avery, features the first appearance of [[Cecil Turtle]]; ''[[Hiawatha's Rabbit Hunt]]'', is the first Bugs Bunny short directed by [[Friz Freleng]]; ''[[All This and Rabbit Stew]]'', directed by Avery, has Bugs tracked by a little African-American hunter (based heavily on racial stereotypes); ''[[The Heckling Hare]]'' was the final Bugs short Avery worked on before being fired (Avery and producer Schlesinger vehemently disagreed over the ending gag of The Heckling Hare, and Avery refused to compromise his creative principles) and leaving for [[MGM]]; and ''[[Wabbit Twouble]]'', the first Bugs short directed by [[Robert Clampett]]. ''Wabbit Twouble'' was also the first of five Bugs shorts to feature a chubbier remodel of Elmer Fudd, a short-lived attempt to have Fudd more closely resemble his voice actor, comedian [[Arthur Q. Bryan]]. === World War II === By 1942, Bugs had become the number one star of ''Merrie Melodies''. The series had originally been intended only for one-shot characters in shorts after several early attempts to introduce characters ([[Foxy (cartoon character)|Foxy]], [[Goopy Geer]] and [[Piggy (Merrie Melodies)|Piggy]]) failed under Harman–Ising. (In 1937, under Schlesinger, it had started introducing newer characters.) Bugs' 1942 shorts included Friz Freleng's ''[[The Wabbit Who Came to Supper]]'', and the Robert Clampett shorts ''[[The Wacky Wabbit]]'' and ''[[Bugs Bunny Gets the Boid]]'' (which introduced [[Beaky Buzzard]]). ''Bugs Bunny Gets the Boid'' shows a slight redesign of Bugs, with less-prominent front teeth and a rounder head. The character was reworked by Robert McKimson, then an animator in Robert Clampett's unit. The redesign at first was only used in the shorts created by Clampett's unit, but in time it would be taken up by the other directors, with Freleng and [[Frank Tashlin]] the first. When McKimson was himself promoted to director, he created yet another version, with more slanted eyes, longer teeth and a much larger mouth. He used this version until 1949 (as did [[Arthur Davis (animator)|Art Davis]] for the one Bugs Bunny cartoon he directed) when he started using the version he had designed for Clampett. Jones would come up with his own slight modification, and the voice had slight variations between the units.<ref name="Barrier"/> Other 1942 Bugs shorts included Chuck Jones' ''[[Hold the Lion, Please]]'', Freleng's ''[[Fresh Hare]]'' and ''[[The Hare-Brained Hypnotist]]'' (which restores Elmer Fudd to his previous size), and Jones' ''[[Case of the Missing Hare]]''. Bugs also made cameos in Tex Avery's final Warner Bros. short, ''Crazy Cruise'', and stars in the two-minute United States [[war bond]]s commercial film ''[[Any Bonds Today]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lehman|first=Christopher P.|year=2008|url=http://books.google.com/?id=xMWhTUFFuqoC&pg=PA73&lpg=PA73&dq=%22any+bonds+today%22+%22bugs+bunny%22+theatrical+cartoon|title=The Colored Cartoon: Black Representation in American Animated Short Films, 1907-1954|location=Amherst, Massachusetts|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|page=73|accessdate=2009-02-25 | isbn=9781558496132}}</ref> Bugs became more popular during World War II because of his free and easy attitude, and began receiving special star billing in his cartoons by 1943. By that time Warner Bros. had become the most profitable cartoon studio in the United States. In company with cartoon studios such as [[Disney]] and [[Famous Studios]], Warners put its characters against the period's biggest enemies, [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Benito Mussolini]], and the [[Japanese Empire|Japanese]]. The 1944 short ''[[Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips]]'' features Bugs at odds with a group of Japanese soldiers. This cartoon has since been pulled from distribution due to its racial stereotypes. He also faces off against [[Herman Goering]] and Hitler in ''[[Herr Meets Hare]]'', which introduced his well-known reference to [[Albuquerque]] as he mistakenly winds up in the [[Black Forest]] of [[Germany|'Joimany']] instead of [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. Since Bugs' debut in ''A Wild Hare'', he had appeared only in color ''Merrie Melodie'' cartoons (making him one of the few recurring characters created for that series in the [[Leon Schlesinger]] era prior to the full conversion to color), alongside Elmer's prototype Egghead, [[Inki]], [[Sniffles]], and Elmer himself—who was heard but not seen in the 1942 ''Looney Tunes'' cartoon ''Nutty News'', and made his first formal appearance in that series in 1943's ''[[To Duck or Not to Duck]]''. While he made a cameo appearance in the 1943 [[Porky Pig|Porky]] and [[Daffy Duck|Daffy]] cartoon ''[[Porky Pig's Feat]]'' this was his only appearance in a black-and-white ''Looney Tune'' cartoon. He did not star in a cartoon in the ''Looney Tunes'' series until that series made its complete conversion to only color cartoons beginning with 1944 releases. ''[[Buckaroo Bugs]]'' was Bugs' first cartoon in the ''Looney Tunes'' series, and was also the last WB cartoon to credit Leon Schlesinger. Among his most notable civilian shorts during this period are Bob Clampett's ''[[Tortoise Wins by a Hare]]'' (a sequel to 1941's ''Tortoise Beats Hare''); ''[[A Corny Concerto]]'' (a spoof of Disney's ''[[Fantasia (film)|Fantasia]]''); ''[[Falling Hare]]''; ''[[What's Cookin' Doc?]]''; Chuck Jones's ''[[Superman]]'' parody ''[[Super-Rabbit]]''; and Freleng's ''[[Little Red Riding Rabbit]]''. The 1944 short ''[[Bugs Bunny and the Three Bears]]'' introduces Jones' [[The Three Bears (Looney Tunes)|The Three Bears]] characters.
