This view was generally accepted until the Roman physician [[Galen]], a follower of Hippocrates and physician to [[Gladiator|Roman gladiators]], observed that his patients lost their mental faculties when they had sustained damage to their brains. In [[al-Andalus]], [[Abu al-Qasim|Abulcasis]], the father of modern [[surgery]], developed material and technical designs which are still used in [[neurosurgery]]. [[Averroes]] suggested the existence of [[Parkinson's disease]] and attributed [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]] properties to the [[retina]]. [[Ibn Zuhr|Avenzoar]] described [[meningitis]], intracranial [[thrombophlebitis]], [[Mediastinal germ cell tumor|mediastinal tumours]] and made contributions to modern [[neuropharmacology]].

Studies of the brain became more sophisticated after the invention of the [[microscope]] and the development of a [[staining|staining procedure]] by [[Camillo Golgi]] during the late 1890s. The procedure used a [[silver chromate]] salt to reveal the intricate structures of individual [[neuron]]s. His technique was used by [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]] and led to the formation of the [[neuron doctrine]], the hypothesis that the functional unit of the brain is the neuron. Golgi and Ramón y Cajal shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1906 for their extensive observations, descriptions, and categorizations of neurons throughout the brain. The neuron doctrine was supported by experiments following [[Luigi Galvani]]'s pioneering work in the electrical excitability of muscles and neurons. In the late 19th century, [[Emil du Bois-Reymond]], [[Johannes Peter Müller]], and [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] demonstrated that neurons were electrically excitable and that their activity predictably affected the electrical state of adjacent neurons. In parallel with this research, work with brain-damaged patients by [[Paul Broca]] suggested that certain regions of the brain were responsible for certain functions. At the time, Broca's findings were seen as a confirmation of [[Franz Joseph Gall]]'s theory that language was localized{{clarify|date=November 2010}} and certain [[mental process|psychological functions]] were localized in the [[cerebral cortex]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Greenblatt SH|year=1995|title=Phrenology in the science and culture of the 19th century|journal=Neurosurg|volume=37|issue=4|pages=790–805|url=http://journals.lww.com/neurosurgery/Abstract/1995/10000/Phrenology_in_the_Science_and_Culture_of_the_19th.25.aspx|pmid=8559310}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Bear MF, Connors BW, Paradiso MA|year=2001|title=Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain|edition=4th|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philedelphia, PA|isbn=0781739446}}</ref> The [[Functional specialization (brain)|localization of function]] hypothesis was supported by observations of [[epilepsy|epileptic]] patients conducted by [[John Hughlings Jackson]], who correctly inferred the organization of the [[motor cortex]] by watching the progression of seizures through the body.

Modern research still uses the [[Brodmann areas|Brodmann]] [[Cytoarchitectonics of the cerebral cortex|cerebral cytoarchitectonic map]] (referring to study of [[cell structure]]) anatomical definitions from this era in continuing to show that distinct areas of the cortex are activated in the execution of specific tasks.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kandel ER, Schwartz JH, Jessel TM|year=2000|title=[[Principles of Neural Science]]|edition=4th|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York, NY|isbn=0838577016}}</ref> In 1952, [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin]] and [[Andrew Huxley]] presented a mathematical model for transmission of electrical signals in neurons of the giant axon of a squid, [[action potentials]], and how they are initiated and propagated, known as the [[Hodgkin-Huxley model]]. In 1961-2, Richard FitzHugh and J. Nagumo simplified Hodgkin-Huxley, in what is called the [[FitzHugh–Nagumo model]]. In 1962, [[Bernard Katz]] modeled neurotransmission across the space between neurons known as [[synapses]]. In 1981 Catherine Morris and Harold Lecar combined these models in the [[Morris-Lecar model]]. In 1984, J. L. Hindmarsh and R.M. Rose further modeled neurotransmission. Beginning in 1966, [[Eric Kandel]] and [[James Schwartz]] examined the biochemical analysis of changes in neurons associated with learning and memory storage. ==Foundations of modern neuroscience== [[Image:neuron colored.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Photograph of a [[staining|stained neuron]] in a chicken embryo]] The [[scientific method|scientific study]] of the [[nervous system]] increased significantly during the second half of the twentieth century, principally due to revolutions in [[molecular biology]], [[electrophysiology]], and [[computational neuroscience]]. It has become possible to understand, in much detail, the complex processes occurring within a single [[neuron]]. However, how [[neural network|networks of neurons]] produce complex [[cognition]]s and [[behavior]]s is still poorly understood. {{cquote|The task of neural science is to explain behavior in terms of the activities of the brain. How does the brain marshal its millions of individual nerve cells to produce behavior, and how are these cells influenced by the environment...? The last frontier of the biological sciences—their ultimate challenge—is to understand the biological basis of consciousness and the mental processes by which we perceive, act, learn, and remember. — [[Eric Kandel]], ''Principles of Neural Science'', 4th ed.}} The nervous system is composed of a network of [[neuron]]s and other supportive cells (e.g., [[glial cell]]s). Neurons form functional circuits, each responsible for specific functions of behavior at the [[organism]]al level. Thus, neuroscience can be studied at many different levels, ranging from the molecular and cellular levels to the systems and cognitive levels. At the molecular level, the basic questions addressed in [[molecular neuroscience]] include the mechanisms by which neurons express and respond to molecular signals and how [[axons]] form complex connectivity patterns. At this level, tools from [[molecular biology]] and [[genetics]] are used to understand how neurons develop and how genetic changes affect biological functions. The [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], molecular identity, and physiological characteristics of neurons and how they relate to different types of behavior are also of considerable interest. At the cellular level, the fundamental questions addressed in [[cellular neuroscience]] include the mechanisms of how neurons process [[cell signaling|signals]] physiologically and electrochemically. They address how signals are processed by [[dendrite]]s, [[soma (biology)|somas]] and [[axon]]s, and how [[neurotransmitter]]s and electrical signals are used to process signals in a neuron.{{clarify|date=November 2010}} Another major area of neuroscience is directed at investigations of the [[neural development|development]] of the nervous system. These questions include the [[Regional specification|patterning and regionalization]] of the nervous system, neural [[stem cell]]s, [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]] of neurons and glia, [[Neural development#Neuronal migration|neuronal migration]], axonal and dendritic development, [[Growth factor|trophic interactions]], and [[Synaptogenesis|synapse formation]]. At the systems level, the questions addressed in [[systems neuroscience]] include how neural circuits are formed and
