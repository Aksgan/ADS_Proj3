Although imaging of removed [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s and [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] can be performed for medical reasons, such procedures are not usually referred to as medical imaging, but rather are a part of [[pathology]]. As a discipline and in its widest sense, it is part of [[biological imaging]] and incorporates [[radiology]] (in the wider sense), [[nuclear medicine]], investigative [[radiological sciences]], [[endoscopy]], (medical) [[thermography]], medical photography and [[microscopy]] (e.g. for human pathological investigations). Measurement and recording techniques which are not primarily designed to produce [[image]]s, such as [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG), [[Electrocardiography]] (EKG) and others, but which produce data susceptible to be represented as [[map]]s (i.e. containing positional information), can be seen as forms of medical imaging. Up until 2010, 5 billion medical imaging studies had been conducted worldwide.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Roobottom CA, Mitchell G, Morgan-Hughes G |title=Radiation-reduction strategies in cardiac computed tomographic angiography |journal=Clin Radiol |volume=65 |issue=11 |pages=859â€“67 |year=2010 |month=November |pmid=20933639 |doi=10.1016/j.crad.2010.04.021 |url=}}</ref> Radiation exposure from medical imaging in 2006 made up about 50% of total ionizing radiation exposure in the United States.<ref name=Science09>{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090303125809.htm |title=Medical Radiation Exposure Of The U.S. Population Greatly Increased Since The Early 1980s |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> == Overview == In the clinical context, "invisible light" medical imaging is generally equated to [[radiology]] or "clinical imaging" and the medical practitioner responsible for interpreting (and sometimes acquiring) the images is a [[radiologist]]. "Visible light" medical imaging involves digital video or still pictures that can be seen without special equipment. Dermatology and wound care are two modalities that utilize visible light imagery. Diagnostic [[radiography]] designates the technical aspects of medical imaging and in particular the acquisition of medical images. The ''[[radiographer]]'' or ''radiologic technologist'' is usually responsible for acquiring medical images of diagnostic quality, although some radiological interventions are performed by [[radiologist]]s. While radiology is an evaluation of anatomy, nuclear medicine provides functional assessment. As a field of scientific investigation, medical imaging constitutes a sub-discipline of [[biomedical engineering]], [[medical physics]] or [[medicine]] depending on the context: Research and development in the area of instrumentation, image acquisition (e.g. [[radiography]]), modelling and quantification are usually the preserve of [[biomedical engineering]], [[medical physics]] and [[computer science]]; Research into the application and interpretation of [[medical image]]s is usually the preserve of [[radiology]] and the medical sub-discipline relevant to medical condition or area of medical science ([[neuroscience]], [[cardiology]], [[psychiatry]], [[psychology]], etc.) under investigation. Many of the techniques developed for medical imaging also have [[Science|scientific]] and [[Industry|industrial]] applications. Medical imaging is often perceived to designate the set of techniques that noninvasively produce images of the internal aspect of the body. In this restricted sense, medical imaging can be seen as the solution of [[Mathematics|mathematical]] [[inverse problem]]s. This means that cause (the properties of living tissue) is inferred from effect (the observed signal). In the case of ultrasonography the probe consists of ultrasonic pressure waves and echoes inside the tissue show the internal structure. In the case of projection radiography, the probe is [[X-ray]] [[electromagnetic radiation|radiation]] which is absorbed at different rates in different tissue types such as bone, muscle and fat. The term noninvasive is a term based on the fact that following medical imaging modalities do not penetrate the skin physically. But on the electromagnetic and radiation level, they are quite invasive. From the high energy photons in X-Ray Computed Tomography, to the 2+ Tesla coils of an MRI device, these modalities alter the physical and chemical environment of the body in order to obtain data. == Imaging technology== {{Empty section|date=October 2010}} ==Radiography== {{Main|Medical radiography}} Two forms of radiographic images are in use in medical imaging; projection radiography and fluoroscopy, with the latter being useful for catheter guidance. These 2D techniques are still in wide use despite the advance of 3D tomography due to the low cost, high resolution, and depending on application, lower radiation dosages. This imaging modality utilizes a wide beam of [[x rays]] for image acquisition and is the first imaging technique available in modern medicine. *''[[Fluoroscopy]]'' produces real-time images of internal structures of the body in a similar fashion to [[radiography]], but employs a constant input of x-rays, at a lower dose rate. [[Contrast media]], such as barium, iodine, and air are used to visualize internal organs as they work. Fluoroscopy is also used in image-guided procedures when constant feedback during a procedure is required. An image receptor is required to convert the radiation into an image after it has passed through the area of interest. Early on this was a fluorescing screen, which gave way to an Image Amplifier (IA) which was a large vacuum tube that had the receiving end coated with [[cesium iodide]], and a mirror at the opposite end. Eventually the mirror was replaced with a TV camera. *''[[Projectional radiography|Projectional radiograph]]s'', more commonly known as x-rays, are often used to determine the type and extent of a fracture as well as for detecting pathological changes in the lungs. With the use of [[radio-opaque]] contrast media, such as [[barium]], they can also be used to visualize the structure of the stomach and intestines - this can help diagnose ulcers or certain types of [[colon cancer]]. ===Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)=== {{Main|Magnetic resonance imaging}} [[Image:Brain Mri nevit.svg|thumb|A brain MRI representation]] A magnetic resonance imaging instrument ([[MRI scanner]]), or "nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging" scanner as it was originally known, uses powerful magnets to polarise and excite [[hydrogen]] nuclei (single [[proton]]) in water molecules in human tissue, producing a detectable signal which is spatially encoded,
