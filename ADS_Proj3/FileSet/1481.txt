Settings for the role-playing game ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' are called [[campaign setting]]s; other games have also incorporated this term on occasion. [[Virtual world]]s are fictional worlds in which [[online]] computer games, notably [[MMORPG]]s and [[MUD]]s, take place. A [[fictional crossover]] occurs when two or more [[fictional character]]s, series or universes cross over with one another, usually in the context of a character created by one author or owned by one [[company (law)|company]] meeting a character created or owned by another. In the case where two fictional universes covering entire ''actual'' universes cross over, physical travel from one universe to another may actually occur in the course of the story. Such crossovers are usually, but not always, considered non-canonical by their creators or by those in charge of the [[intellectual property|properties]] involved. ==See also== {{top}} * [[List of fictional universes]] - list of fictional universes by genre * [[Continuity (fiction)]] * [[Setting (fiction)]] * [[Diegesis]] * [[Alternate history (fiction)|Alternate history]] * [[Alternative universe (fan fiction)]] * [[Constructed world]] * [[Expanded universe]] * [[Fantasy world]] * [[Fictional location]] * [[Fictional country]] {{middle}} * [[Index of fictional places]] * [[Future history]] * [[Mythical place]] * [[Parallel universe (fiction)|Parallel universe]] * [[Planets in science fiction]] * [[Simulated reality]] * [[Virtual reality]] {{bottom}} ==References== * [[Alberto Manguel]] & [[Gianni Guadalupi]]: ''[[The Dictionary of Imaginary Places]]'', New York : Harcourt Brace, c2000.

It was most popular in the early to mid 1990s, prior to the introduction of easy and affordable access to the [[Internet]]. The network continues to operate but has shrunk considerably, primarily due to the closing of many [[Bulletin board system|BBS]]es during the increase of popularity of the [[Internet]]. ==Origin== FidoNet was originally founded as a non-commercial network in 1984 by [[Tom Jennings]] of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]] as a means to network BBSes that used his own "Fido" BBS software.<ref name=FOOTNOTEScott2005>{{Harvnb|Scott|2005|loc=At time 5:19}}. "Tom Jennings rewrote the Fido BBS program to network with other Fidos. He named this network 'Fidonet'."</ref> Over time, [[list of BBS software|other BBS software]] was independently adapted to support the relevant FidoNet [[protocol (computing)|protocols]] and the network became a popular means for computer users to communicate. Until 1994 with the arrival of commercial [[Internet]], Fidonet was the only non [[Compuserve]], Minerva or [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]] methodology for most of the world's population to send email to and from the [[Milnet]], [[Arpanet]] and [[Minitel]] networks. ==FidoNet organizational structure== FidoNet is governed in a hierarchical structure according to FidoNet policy, with designated coordinators at each level to manage the administration of FidoNet nodes and resolve disputes between members.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.fidonet.us/policy4.html | title = FidoNet Policy Document: Version 4.07 | date = June 9, 1989 | publisher = FidoNet | accessdate = 2010-09-30 }}</ref> Network coordinators are responsible for managing the individual nodes within their area, usually a city or similar sized area. Regional coordinators are responsible for managing the administration of the network coordinators within their region, typically the size of a state, or small country. Zone coordinators are responsible for managing the administration of all of the regions within their zone. The world is divided into six zones, the coordinators of which elect one of themselves to be the "International Coordinator" of FidoNet. ==Technical structure== FidoNet was historically designed to use modem-based [[Dial-up internet access|dial-up]] ([[plain old telephone service|POTS]]) access between bulletin board systems, and much of its policy and structure reflected this. The FidoNet system officially referred only to transfer of '''Netmail'''&mdash;the individual private messages between people using bulletin boards&mdash;including the protocols and standards with which to support it. A netmail message would contain the name of the person sending, the name of the intended recipient, and the respective FidoNet addresses of each. The FidoNet system was responsible for routing the message from one system to the other (details below), with the bulletin board software on each end being responsible for ensuring that only the intended recipient could read it. Due to the hobbyist nature of the network, any privacy between sender and recipient was only the result
