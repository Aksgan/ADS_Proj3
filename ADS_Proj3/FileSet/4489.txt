account is often configured with a [[Shell (computing)|shell]] which is small, efficient, and dependable, but awkward for daily use. The 'toor' account is intended as a solution to this problem. It is exactly equivalent to the normal 'root' superuser account, but is configured to use a different, more featureful shell. Alternately, since they are equivalent accounts, 'toor' may be configured with the emergency shell, allowing 'root' the freedom to use the featureful one. ==Implementation== In a Unix-like system, each user has a [[User identifier (Unix)|user ID]] number, which is what the [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] uses to distinguish users and to manage user [[File system permissions|permissions]]. User ID #0 is reserved as the superuser account, and is given permission to do anything on the system. Users log in by username, not by ID number, and a user's choice of login shell is also managed by name. This separation between name and number allows a given user ID to be associated with more than one username, each having its own shell. ==Security considerations== The presence of a 'toor' account (or the presence of more than one account with a user ID of 0) triggers a warning in many security auditing systems. This is valuable, since if the [[system administrator]] did not intend for a second superuser account, then it may mean that the system has been compromised. It may be argued that even an intentional 'toor' account is a security risk, since it provides a second point of attack for someone trying to illicitly gain superuser privileges on the system. However, if passwords are chosen and guarded carefully, the risk increase is minimal. For more information, see [[password]]. For example, [[NetBSD]] ships with a disabled 'toor' account, meaning that there is no password with which one can log into the system as 'toor'. This is not a security risk in itself, though it may generate security warnings as previously described. However, if the system is compromised, an administrator may be less likely to notice the enabling of a disabled account than the creation of a new one, especially if he has become accustomed to ignoring warnings about 'toor' from his (arguably misconfigured) security program. Some Unix variants have been known to ship with a default configuration in which the 'toor' account is enabled, but does not require a password. This is a serious security concern, since it provides an easy way for anyone to become the superuser. ==See also== *[[Password]] *[[User name]] *[[ToorCon]] [[Category:System administration]] [[Category:Operating system security]] [[de:Root-Account]]</text> </page> <page> <id>37920</id> <title>Top Eleven Football Manager</title> <text>{{Notability|date=May 2010}} {{orphan|date=June 2010}} {{Infobox VG | title = Top Eleven | image =[[File:Top-eleven-200x200.jpg]] | developer = Nordeus | released = Sunday, May 09 2010 | genre = [[Simulation video game|Simulation]] | modes = [[Single-player]] with [[multiplayer]] interaction | platforms = Internet | media = [[Web browser]] | requirements = | input = [[Keyboard (computing)|Keyboard]], [[Mouse (computing)|Mouse]] | website = http://www.topelevengame.com/ }} '''Top Eleven Football Manager''' is online football manager simulation developed by Nordeus, for use through [[Facebook]] and other social networking sites. It was launched in May 2010, and since it's publishing rating was above 4 out of 5. The game was conceived in order to address a lack of social football-management games for the social media environment. The game builds on the concepts and game play found in games like [[Eidos Interactive]]'s [[Football Manager]] and [[Electronic Arts]]' [[Premier Manager]] that have engaged millions of football fans. Top Eleven Football Manager, managed to transfer the look and feel of desktop applications to [[Facebook]]. == Gameplay == To start playing, user first needs to select his nationality, language, and create his club by naming it, choosing the colors of jerseys and designing the logo. After this, user will join one of the leagues with 14 teams playing already. The system is trying to group Facebook friends together, so they will be able to play the same league. One season lasts 28 days, and every day teams play one league match. The best teams (first four) are qualifying for Champions league, which will be played next season. First 7 teams from the league, progress to the next level, and from the next season they play the league with teams from the same level. System is trying again to group friends together. Each user has complete control over his team, by training them, setting the tactics, changing the players, buying & selling them on the transfer market. Every match can be watched live, and user can react by changing the tactics and players. Each users controls the building of its club infrastructure (stadium, reflector, grass, medical, seats, training facilities, ...) and they have influence during the game. For example, bigger stadium can take more fans, and more fans, mean bigger moral for players, and more money from selling tickets. Club finances are very important. Users are signing sponsorship agreements for every season, they can sell boards around the field, players on transfer market, selling the tickets for domestic games. In Top Eleven besides cash users need Tokens (Top Eleven virtual currency) which can be bought online or using mobile phone. Tokens can be used for speeding up building, for bidding on player auctions, changing club identity, ... Every day each user gets 1 Token free. <gallery></gallery> == External links == * [http://www.nordeus.eu ''Company official site''] * [http://www.topelevengame.com ''Game official site''] * [http://www.facebook.com/topelevengame ''Top Eleven Football Manager''] on [[Facebook]] * [http://www.24sata.rs/vesti.php?id=72273 "Train your football team on Facebook"] Serbian daily newspapers - 24sata, Article May 12th, 2010 * [http://www.danas.rs/danasrs/drustvo/terazije/srpski_strucnjaci_za_virtuelni_fudbal.14.html?news_id=191730 "Serbian experts for virtual football"] Serbian daily newspapers - Danas, Article June 1st, 2010 [[Category:Social media]] [[Category:Browser-based multiplayer online games]] [[Category:Facebook applications]] [[Category:Social casual gaming]] [[Category:Football manager]]</text> </page> <page> <id>37930</id> <title>Topological data analysis</title> <text>'''Topological data analysis''' is a new area of study aimed at having applications in areas such as [[data mining]] and [[computer vision]].
