syntactic units. Words are represented by units. Groupings of sub-units into grammatical constructions are also represented by units. The 'subunits' feature links subordinate units into a tree rooted at the 'top' unit. The majority of units in the FCG Left Pole have corresponding same-named units in the Right Pole, thus forming similar unit trees. During the FCG parse of an utterance, the initial state of the Coupled Feature Structure is for a set of word strings and their ordering to be present on the sole unit of the Right (syntactic) Pole named 'top', and for the Left (semantic) Pole to consist of an empty top unit. As production rules apply consecutively to the Coupled Feature Structure, units and lexical features are linked into the Right Pole tree for each word, and if the word is significant, same-named units with semantic features are added to the Left Pole tree. At the end of a successful parse, the meaning ([[logical form (linguistics)]]) is extracted from the 'meaning' features of Left Pole units. Conversely, because the FCG grammar is bi-directional, the production of an utterance from an initial set of meanings begins with the meanings as feature values of the sole Left Pole unit named 'top'. As successive grammar rules are applied, same-named units are added to both pole trees. At the end of a successful production, the word string is extracted from the 'form' features of Right Pole units. ==Grammar production rules== FCG rules are a persistent specialization of Coupled Feature Structures, having the additional attributes of type, name, and weight. FCG applies rules by type, and distinguishes among them by name. Weights can be used to choose between competing rules. Some types of FCG rule match the rule Left Pole with the corresponding Coupled Feature Structure Left Pole. The remaining types of FCG rule match Right Poles with the Coupled Feature Structure. A match generally follows the process of [[unification]]. With rule variables bound, the rule pole not used in the match is merged with the corresponding pole of the Coupled Feature Structure. One type of rule, the Construction Rule, is an exception and is allowed to merge both Left and Right Poles with the Coupled Feature Structure after the matching process binds its free variables. ==Flexibility== FCG provides a framework for bi-directional parsing and production. But aside from reserving the 'top' unit name and a few feature names, FCG makes no commitments to any grammatical theory of word categories, and makes no commitment to any particular theory of grammatical constructions. Users of FCG make these choices by writing FGC grammar rules accordingly. ==References== * [[Luc Steels]] and Joachim De Beule (2006) [http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/W/W06/W06-3510.pdf A (very) Brief Introduction to Fluid Construction Grammar] Third International Workshop on Scalable Natural Language Understanding (ScaNaLU 2006) June 8, 2006, following HLT/NAACL, New York City ==External links== * http://www.fcg-net.org/ (website of the FCG community) * http://www.emergent-languages.org/ *[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=176781&package_id=254824 Texai open source Java FCG implementation] [[Category:Grammar frameworks]] [[Category:Evolution of language]]</text> </page> <page> <id>13864</id> <title>Flux qubit</title> <text>In [[quantum computing]], '''flux qubits''' (also known as '''persistent current qubits''') are micrometer sized loops of superconducting metal interrupted by a number of [[Josephson junction]]s. The junction parameters are engineered during fabrication so that a persistent current will flow continuously when an external flux is applied. The computational basis states of the qubit are defined by the circulating currents which can flow either clockwise or counter-clockwise. These currents screen the applied flux limiting it to multiples of the [[flux quanta|flux quantum]] and give the qubit its name. When the applied flux through the loop area is close to a half integer number of flux quanta the two energy levels corresponding to the two directions of circulating current are brought close together and the loop may be operated as a [[Qubit]]. [[Image:Flux Qubit - Holloway.jpg|thumb|SEM image of a 4-junction Flux Qubit Fabricated at Royal Holloway University of London.]] Computational operations are performed by pulsing the qubit with [[microwave]] frequency radiation which has an energy comparable to that of the gap between the energy of the two basis states. Properly selected frequencies can put the qubit into a [[quantum superposition]] of the two basis states, subsequent pulses can manipulate the probability weighting that qubit will be measured in either of the two basis states, thus performing a computational operation. == Fabrication == Like most mesoscopic devices such as [[solid state qubit]]s, [[single-electron transistor]]s, [[quantum dot]]s, ''etc.'', flux qubits are fabricated using techniques similar to those used in the [[micro-electronics industry]]. The devices are made on silicon wafers using [[electron beam lithography]] and metallic thin film evaporation processes. To create the [[Josephson junction]] a technique known as shadow evaporation is normally used; this involves evaporating the source metal alternately at two angles through the lithography defined mask in the electron beam resist. This results in two overlapping layers of the superconducting metal, in between which a thin layer of insulator (normally [[aluminum oxide]]) is deposited. == Flux qubit parameters == The flux qubit is distinguished from other types of superconducting qubit such as the [[charge qubit]] or [[phase qubit]] by the coupling energy and charging energy of its junctions. In the charge qubit regime the charging energy of the junctions dominates the coupling energy, while in a flux qubit the situation is reversed and the coupling energy dominates. Typically in a flux qubit the coupling energy is 10-100 times greater than the charging energy. It is this ratio that allows the cooper pairs to flow continuously around the loop, rather than tunnel discretely across the junctions as in a charge qubit. == Readout == Like all quantum bits, Flux qubits require a suitably sensitive probe coupled to it in order to measure its state after a computation has been carried out. Such quantum probes should introduce as little back-action as possible onto the qubit during measurement. Ideally they should be decoupled during computation and then turned "on" for a short time during read-out. Read-out probes for flux qubits work by interacting with one of the qubit's macroscopic
