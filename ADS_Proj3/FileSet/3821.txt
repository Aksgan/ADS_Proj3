Both firms made elaborate proposals, but neither was persuasive enough to get Hashiyama’s business. Unwilling to split up the collection into separate auctions, Hashiyama asked the firms to decide between themselves who would hold the auction, which included Cézanne's "Large Trees Under the Jas de Bouffan", worth $12–16 million. The houses were unable to reach a decision. Hashiyama told the two firms to play rock-paper-scissors to decide who would get the rights to the auction, explaining that "it probably looks strange to others, but I believe this is the best way to decide between two things which are equally good". The auction houses had a weekend to come up with a choice of move. Christie's went to the 11-year-old twin daughters of an employee, who suggested "scissors" because "Everybody expects you to choose 'rock'." Sotheby's said that they treated it as a [[game of chance]] and had no particular strategy for the game, but went with "paper".<ref>{{Cite news | last =Vogel | first =Carol | title =Rock, Paper, Payoff: Child's Play Wins Auction House an Art Sale | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date=April 29, 2005 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/29/arts/design/29scis.html | postscript =<!--None-->}} </ref> Christie's won the match, with millions of dollars of commission for the auction house. == Rock-paper-scissors in video games == ===Main game mechanics=== Some [[Facebook]] apps revolve almost entirely around Rock-Paper-Scissors matches, like [[Rock-Paper-Sumo]]. ===Secondary main game mechanics=== In these games, RPS is not the main way of resolving conflict or advancing in a game, but is mixed with other mechanics. * [[Sega]]'s [[1986]] [[Alex Kidd in Miracle World]]: right at the end of each level, the player must beat an enemy at a best-of-three game of rock-paper-scissors. * [[Naruto: Ultimate Ninja (series)|Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja 4]]: when two players collide, one must press a button to determine rock, paper, or scissors. The winner then proceeds to attack the loser. * [[Dragon Warrior Monsters]], players must beat Goopi in rock-paper-scissors contests in order to progress in the game. * [[Hudson Soft]]'s [[NES]] title [[Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom]] used "Finger Wars," a modified game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, to fight against enemies. * In [[Mother 3]] the main character, Lucas, has to play Stone-Sheet-Clippers, the game's version of rock, paper, scissors, with the fictional band DCMC at the end of the 4th chapter. * In the [[Fire Emblem]] series, there is a Rock-paper-scissor-like term called Weapon Triangle (Sword, Axe and Lance). Swords are fast attacking weapons, Axe are powerful weapons and Lances have long reach. Sword beats Axe, Axe beats Lance and Lance beats Sword. But there's still a chance for the weaker weapon to win if the character is strong enough. == Rock-paper-scissors analogs in nature == === Lizard mating strategies === {{Main|Common side-blotched lizard#Mating strategy}} The [[common side-blotched lizard]] (''Uta stansburiana'') exhibits a rock-paper-scissors pattern in its mating strategies.

Biologist Benjamin C. Kirkup, Jr. further demonstrated that the colicins were active as ''E. coli'' compete with each other in the intestines of mice, and that the rock-paper-scissors dynamics allowed for the continued competition among strains: antibiotic-producers defeat antibiotic-sensitives; antibiotic-resisters multiply and withstand and out-compete the antibiotic-producers, letting antibiotic-sensitives multiply and out-compete others; until antibiotic-producers multiply again.<ref>Nature. 2004 Mar 25;428(6981):412-4</ref> == Tournaments == === World Rock Paper Scissors Society sanctioned tournaments === Starting in 2002, the World Rock Paper Scissors Society standardized a set of rules for international play<ref>{{cite web | title = Game Basics | work = World Rock Paper Scissors Society | url = http://www.worldrps.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=14&Itemid=31 | accessdate = 2006-08-20 }}</ref> and has overseen annual International World Championships.
