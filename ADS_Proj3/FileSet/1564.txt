(Examples include windowing systems, Internet browsers, email programs, office suites, and so forth.) In general, the project itself does not develop this software, only the framework to allow these programs to be installed (termed the ''Ports Collection''). Applications may be installed either from source, if its licensing terms allow such redistribution (these are called ''ports''), or as compiled binaries if allowed (these are called ''packages''). The ''Ports Collection'' supports the latest release on the ''-CURRENT'' and ''-STABLE'' branches. Older releases are not supported and may or may not work correctly with an up-to-date ports collection.<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports.html | title = Chapter 4 Installing Applications: Packages and Ports | publisher = freebsd.org | accessdate=2009-01-30 }} </ref> ====Ports Collection==== Each package in the ''Ports Collection'' is installed from [[source code|source]]. Each port's [[make (software)|Makefile]] automatically fetches the application [[source code]], either from a local disk, CD-ROM or via [[ftp]], unpacks it on the system, applies the patches, and [[compiler|compiles]]. This method can be very time consuming as compiling large packages can take hours, but the user is able to install a customized program.<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports-using.html | title = 4.5 Using the Ports Collection | publisher = freebsd.org | accessdate=2009-01-30 }} </ref> ====Packages system==== For most ports, precompiled binary packages also exist. This method is very quick as the whole compilation process is avoided, but the user is not able to install a program with customized compile time options.<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/packages-using.html | title = 4.4 Using the Packages System | publisher = freebsd.org | accessdate=2009-01-30 }} </ref> ====Utilities for managing ports and packages==== There are many utilities available for managing ports and packages available in [[Graphical user interface|GUIs]] and [[Command-line interface|CLIs]]. These are some of them:<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.freebsd.org/ports/ports-mgmt.html | title = FreeBSD Ports: Ports-mgmt | publisher = freebsd.org | accessdate=2009-09-08 }} </ref> * barry - A [[KDE]] frontend to the ports system * bpm - A [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] ports collection manager * kports - A [[KDE]] frontend to the ports system * pib - A [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] Ports Collection management tool * portbrowser - A [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] frontend for the ports system ===Linux compatibility=== Most software that runs on [[Linux]] can run on FreeBSD without the need for any [[compatibility layer]]. FreeBSD nonetheless still provides a [[compatibility layer]] for several other [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s, including Linux. Hence, most Linux binaries can be run on FreeBSD, including some proprietary applications distributed only in binary form. Examples of applications that can use the Linux compatibility layer are [[StarOffice]], the Linux version of [[Firefox]], [[Adobe Acrobat]], [[RealPlayer]], [[Oracle Database|Oracle]], [[Mathematica]], [[Maple_(software)|Maple]], [[MATLAB]], [[WordPerfect]], [[Skype]], [[Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory]], [[Doom 3]] and [[Quake 4]] <ref name=binary>{{cite web|url=http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/linuxemu.html|title=Chapter 10 Linux Binary Compatibility|accessdate=2007-03-29|publisher=freebsd.org}}</ref> (though some of these applications also have a native version). No noticeable performance penalty over native FreeBSD programs has been noted when running Linux binaries, and, in some cases, these may even perform more smoothly than on Linux.<ref name=unleashed>{{cite book|last=Tiemann|first=Brian|title=FreeBSD 6 Unleashed|year=2006|isbn=0672328755|chapter=How FreeBSD Compares to Other Operating Systems}}</ref> However, the layer is not altogether seamless, and some Linux binaries are unusable or only partially usable on FreeBSD. This is often because the compatibility layer only supports system calls available in the historical Linux kernel 2.4.2. There is support of Linux 2.6.16 system calls, enabled by default since 8.0 and available since 7.0. However, there is currently no support for running 64-bit Linux binaries.<ref name=linux-64-bit>{{cite web|url=http://markmail.org/message/gsd3is7yz7w7sent|title=Support for 64 Bit Linux binaries on FreeBSD (Mailing List)|accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref> ==Development== FreeBSD currently has more than 400 active developers<ref name=developers>{{cite web |url=http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/articles/contributors/staff-committers.html |work=Contributors to FreeBSD |publisher=freebsd.org |title=List of FreeBSD developers |accessdate=2010-03-13}}</ref> and thousands of contributors. ===Governance structure=== The FreeBSD Project is run by FreeBSD committers, or developers who have [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]]/[[Subversion (software)|SVN]] commit access. There are several kinds of committers, including source committers (base operating system), doc committers (documentation and web site authors) and ports (third party application porting and infrastructure). Every two years the FreeBSD committers select a 9-member FreeBSD Core Team who are responsible for overall project direction, setting and enforcing project rules and approving new "commit bits", or the granting of CVS/SVN commit access. A number of responsibilities are officially assigned to other development teams by the FreeBSD Core Team, including responsibility for security advisories (the Security Officer Team), [[release engineering]] (the Release Engineering Team) and managing the ports collection (the Port Manager team). Developers may give up their commit rights to retire or for "safe-keeping" after a period of a year or more of inactivity, although commit rights will generally be restored on request. Under rare circumstances commit rights may be removed by Core Team vote as a result of repeated violation of project rules and standards. The FreeBSD Project is unusual among open source projects in having developers who have worked with its source base for over 25 years, owing to the involvement of a number of past University of California developers who worked on [[BSD]] at the [[Computer Systems Research Group]].<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.freebsd.org/administration.html | title = FreeBSD Project Administration and Management | publisher = freebsd.org | accessdate=2009-01-30 }} </ref> ===Branches=== FreeBSD [[software developer|developers]] maintain
