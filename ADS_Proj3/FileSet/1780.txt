Some cities in the United States where all streets are privately owned have asked Google to remove Street View images because their consent was not given. [[North Oaks, Minnesota]] may have been the first. In that case, Google complied.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/19416279.html |title=North Oaks tells Google Maps: Keep out - we mean it |author=Pabst, Lora |publisher=Minneapolis Star-Tribune |date=May 31, 2008 |accessdate=April 1, 2009}}</ref> ==Canada== While Canada, like other jurisdictions, has raised the issue of privacy concerns regarding Google Street View, the presence of Google cameras in one Canadian city in March 2009 gave rise to a different complaint. Les MacPherson, a columnist with the [[Saskatoon]] [[The StarPhoenix|Star-Phoenix]], complained in a March 28, 2009, [[column]] that the timing of the imaging, at the end of a protracted winter season and before the true onset of spring would cast an unfavourable image of Saskatoon and other cities. "What worries me more than any loss of privacy is the prospect of presenting to the world a highly unflattering impression of Canadian cities. With the possible exception of [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], they do not show off well in the spring. Google could not have picked a more inauspicious time to do its scanning. Saskatoon is unfortunately typical. For Google to record its images of the city at this most visually unappealing time of year is like photographing a beautiful woman who has just awakened from a six-month coma," he wrote.<ref>{{Citation | last = MacPherson | first = Les | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = City not at its best in Google's new photos | newspaper=[[The StarPhoenix|Saskatoon Star-Phoenix]] | pages = | year = | date = March 28, 2009 | url = http://www.thestarphoenix.com/Business/COLUMN+City+best+Google+photos/1438536/story.html | accessdate = April 19, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In early October 2009, the first Canadian cities began to appear on Street View; several, including Saskatoon, were not included in the initial roll-out. One city that was included, Calgary, included images taken in both summer and winter. Images of Saskatoon were rolled out on December 2, 2009. More recently{{When|date=July 2010}}, several areas have had their pictures re-taken, for example, [[Toronto]]. Toronto's old images appeared to have been taken in late October, but these new images appear to have been taken in late March, April and May, as evidenced by images where school [[bulletin boards]] indicate the month is as such. ==Czech Republic== In the [[Czech Republic]] Street View has been banned since September 2010 by the Czech Office for Personal Data Protection after more than half a year of unsuccessful negotiation between the Czech Republic and Google. The Office described Google’s programme as taking pictures “beyond the extent of the ordinary sight from a street”, and that it “disproportionately invade citizens’ privacy.” However pictures taken before this decision (mostly in 2009) may remain available online but Google is obliged to erase every picture from that period shall it be disputed.”<ref>[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,6006085,00.html]</ref><ref>[http://seerpress.com/czech-republic-blocks-googles-data-mapping-feature/7691/]</ref> ==European Union== A recent demand from the European Union would require Google to warn local residents before sending out the cameras. It also requires Google to keep the unblurred versions of the photos no longer than 6 months, instead of no longer than a year. Google was instructed to give advance notice online and in the local press before photographing.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/25/AR2010022504840.html | work=The Washington Post}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref> In 2010, Google announced that it might cancel Google Street View service in the European Union due to unmanageable requests of the European Commission.<ref>{{cite web|author=Post a Job |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-03-03/google-may-drop-street-view-in-eu-if-photo-storage-time-is-cut.html |title=Google May Drop Street View in EU if Photo Storage Time Is Cut |work=BusinessWeek |date=March 3, 2010 |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}</ref> ==United Kingdom== [[File:Google Street View Car in Southampton.jpg|250px|right|thumbnail|[[Opel Astra]] Street View Car in [[Southampton]], [[Hampshire]]]] In the first days of launch the UK service drew criticism due to privacy.<ref>{{cite web|author=by dave |url=http://news.idealo.co.uk/news/5344/images-get-pulled-from-google-street-view-in-first-week-of-service.html |title=Images Get Pulled From Google Street View In First Week Of Service |publisher=News.idealo.co.uk |date=March 20, 2009 |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}</ref> Images were found of a man leaving a [[sex shop]], a man vomiting and another man being arrested.
