is the representation of a [[language]] by means of a [[writing system]]. Written language is an [[invention]] in that it must be taught to children, who will instinctively learn or create [[spoken language|spoken]] or [[sign language|gestural]] languages.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} A written language exists only as a complement to a specific spoken or gestural language, and no [[natural language]] is purely written. However, [[extinct language]]s may be in effect purely written when only their writings survive.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} == Written language vs. spoken language == {{Unreferenced section|date=February 2010}} Written languages change more slowly than corresponding spoken languages. When one or more [[register (linguistics)|registers]] of a language come to be strongly divergent from spoken language, the resulting situation is called [[diglossia]]. However, such diglossia is often considered as one language, between [[literary language]] and other registers, especially if the [[writing system]] reflects its [[pronunciation]]. Native readers and writers of [[English language|English]] are often unaware that the complexities of [[English spelling]] make written English a somewhat artificial construct. The traditional spelling of English, at least for inherited words, preserves a late [[Middle English]] [[phonology]] that is no one's speech dialect. The artificial preservation of this much earlier form of the language in writing might make much of what we write intelligible to [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] (1343–1400), even if we could not understand his speech. ==Further reading== *{{cite book|last= Ankerl |first= Guy |title= Global communication without universal civilization |origdate= |origyear= 2000 |series= INU societal research |volume= Vol.1: Coexisting contemporary civilizations : Arabo-Muslim, Bharati, Chinese, and Western |publisher= INU Press |location= Geneva |isbn= 2-88155-004-5 |pages= 59–66, 235–236 }} ==See also== *[[List of writing systems]] *[[Literary language]] *[[List of languages by first written accounts]] *[[Writing]] *[[History of writing]] *[[History of writing ancient numbers]] [[Category:Writing]] [[Category:Languages]] [[da:Skriftsprog]] [[de:Geschriebene Sprache]] [[es:Lenguaje escrito]] [[fo:Skriftmál]] [[lv:Rakstu valoda]] [[nl:Geschreven taal]] [[ja:書記言語]] [[no:Skriftspråk]] [[nn:Skriftspråk]] [[pl:Język pisany]] [[ro:Limbă scrisă]] [[tr:Metin bilgisi]] [[zh-yue:書面語]] [[zh:书面语]]</text> </page> <page> <id>40597</id> <title>X00</title> <text>{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}} '''X00''' was a popular DOS-based [[FOSSIL]] [[device driver|driver]]<ref name="ref">{{cite web |url=http://www.dcllabs.net/docs/x00ref.txt |title=Functions reference manual for the X00 developer |author=Raymond L.

FOSSIL drivers were mainly used to run [[Bulletin Board System|BBS]] software under [[MS-DOS]]. X00 can also be run under [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], or even [[Linux]] and [[DOSEMU]] environments, to allow FOSSIL-aware MS-DOS based applications to function. X00 was developed by [[Raymond L. Gwinn]]<ref name="ref"/> from [[1989]] until [[1993]]. The final release version was version 1.50, with a later beta version 1.53 which added support for baud rates above 38400. X00 is free for non-commercial usage.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} X00 included many enhancements to the FTC FOSSIL revision 5 specifications, which were later used in other FOSSIL drivers such as [[AnDan FOSSIL|ADF]] and [[NetFoss]]. Gwinn moved on to develop a replacement serial port driver for [[OS/2]] called [[SIO (software)|SIO]]. SIO contained a virtualized FOSSIL (VX00) that could be loaded if applications needed FOSSIL support. ==References== <references/> [[Category:Device drivers]] [[Category:FOSSIL]] {{network-software-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>40599</id> <title>X10 (programming language)</title> <text>{{Infobox programming language | name = X10 | logo = | caption = | file ext = .x10 | paradigm = [[Object-oriented programming|Object-oriented]] | year = 2004 | designer = Kemal Ebcioğlu, Vijay Saraswat, and Vivek Sarkar | developer = [[IBM]] | latest release version = 2.1.1 | latest release date = {{start date and age|2011|01|10}} | typing = [[Type system|Static, strong, safe]] | implementations = | dialects = | influenced by = [[Java (programming language)|Java]] | influenced = | programming language = | operating system = [[IBM AIX]], [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Windows]] | license = [[Eclipse Public License]] 1.0 | website = http://x10-lang.org/ | wikibooks = }} '''X10''' is a [[programming language]] being developed by [[IBM]] at the [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center]] as part of the [[PERCS]] project funded by [[DARPA]]'s [[High Productivity Computing Systems]] (HPCS) program. Its primary authors are Kemal Ebcioğlu, Vijay Saraswat, and Vivek Sarkar.<ref> Ebcioğlu, Kemal; Saraswat, Vijay; Sarkar, Vivek, [http://www.aurorasoft.net/workshops/lar04/Author_Files/Papers/Vivek_Sarkar_LaR_04_Paper_V1.pdf "X10: "Programming for Hierarchical Parallelism and NonUniform Data Access"]</ref> X10 is designed specifically for [[parallel programming]] using the [[partitioned global address space]] (PGAS) model. A computation is divided among a set of ''places'', each of which holds some data and hosts one or more ''activities'' that operate on those data. It supports a constrained type system for object-oriented programming, as well as user-defined primitive ''struct'' types; globally distributed ''arrays'', and structured and unstructured parallelism.<ref>Saraswat, Vijay; Bloom, Bard; Peshansky, Igor; Tardieu, Olivier; Grove, David, [http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/documentation/languagespec/x10-latest.pdf "Report on the Programming Language X10: Version 2.1"], October 18, 2010</ref> X10 uses the concept of parent and child relationships for activities to prevent the lock stalemate that can occur when two or more processes wait for each other to finish before they can complete. An activity may spawn one or more child activities, which may themselves have children. Children cannot wait for a parent to finish, but a parent can wait for a child using the ''finish'' command.<ref>Biever, C.
