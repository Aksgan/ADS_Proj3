1995 the fourth revision of the standard ([[X11.1-1995]]) was approved by ANSI, and by ISO in 1999 as [[ISO 11756-1999]]. The MDC finalized a further revision to the standard in 1998 but this has not been presented to ANSI for approval. On 6 January 2005, ISO re-affirmed its MUMPS-related standards: [http://www.iso.ch/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=29268&ICS1=35&ICS2=60&ICS3=&scopelist ISO/IEC 11756:1999, language standard], [http://www.iso.ch/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=29269&printable=true ISO/IEC 15851:1999, Open MUMPS Interconnect] and [http://www.iso.ch/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?printable=true&CSNUMBER=29270 ISO/IEC 15852:1999, MUMPS Windowing Application Programmers Interface]. By 2000, the [[middleware]] vendor [[InterSystems]] had become the dominant player in the MUMPS market with the purchase of several other vendors. Initially they acquired DataTree Inc. in the early 1990s. And, on December 30, 1995, Intersystems acquired the DSM product line from [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]].<ref>http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.mumps/msg/d4509328a7930487</ref> InterSystems consolidated these products into a single product line, branding them, on several hardware platforms, as '''OpenM'''. In 1997, [[InterSystems]] essentially completed this consolidation by launching a unified successor named [[Caché (software)|Caché]]. This was based on their ISM product, but with influences from the other implementations. Micronetics Design Corporation assets were also acquired by InterSystems on June 21, 1998. Intersystems remains today (2007) the dominant MUMPS vendor, selling Caché to MUMPS developers who write applications for a variety of operating systems. Greystone Technology Corporation's [[GT.M]] implementation was sold to Sanchez Computer Associates Inc. (now part of Fidelity National Financial Inc.) in the mid 1990s. On November 7, 2000 Sanchez made GT.M for Linux available under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] license<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.sanchez.com/news_2000/nr_001107.asp Archive.org record of: Fidelity Information Services: Banking Solutions]</ref> and on October 28, 2005 GT.M for [[OpenVMS]] and [[Tru64 UNIX]] were also made available under the AGPL license<ref>[http://sourceforge.net/projects/fis-gtm/files/ GT.M download page on SourceForge]</ref>. GT.M continues to be available on other UNIX platforms under a traditional license. The newest implementation of MUMPS, released in April 2002, is an '''MSM''' derivative called '''M21''' from the Real Software Company of Rugby, UK. There are also several open source implementations of MUMPS, including some research projects. The most notable of these is [http://www.cs.uni.edu/~okane Mumps/II], by Professor Kevin O'Kane (now at the [[University of Northern Iowa]]) and students' project. Dr. O'Kane and Ryan Murphy have also ported the interpreter to Mac OS X.<ref>http://www.rychannel.com/mumps</ref> One of the original creators of the MUMPS language, [[Neil Pappalardo]], early founded a company called Meditech. They extended and built on the MUMPS language, naming the new language [[MIIS (programming language)|MIIS]] (and later, another language named MAGIC). Unlike Intersystems, Meditech no longer sells middleware, so MIIS and MAGIC are now only used internally at Meditech. ==Current users of MUMPS applications== {{Main|MUMPS users}} The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (formerly the Veterans Administration) was one of the earliest major adopters of the MUMPS language. Their development work (and subsequent contributions to the free MUMPS application codebase) was an influence on many medical users worldwide. In 1995, the Veterans Affairs' patient Admission/Tracking/Discharge system, [[Decentralized Hospital Computer Program]] (DHCP) was the recipient of the Computerworld [[Smithsonian Award]] for best use of Information Technology in Medicine. A decade later (July, 2006), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) / Veterans Health Administration (VHA) was the recipient of the Innovations in American Government Award presented by the Ash Institute of the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]] for its extension of DHCP into the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture ([[VistA]]) in July, 2006. Nearly the entire VA hospital system in the [[United States]] and the [[Indian Health Service]], as well as major parts of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] [[CHCS]] hospital system all run systems using MUMPS databases for clinical data tracking. Large companies currently using MUMPS include AmeriPath (now part of Quest Diagnostics), Care Centric, [[Epic Systems Corporation]], [[EMIS]], [[Partners HealthCare]], [[Meditech]], [[GE Healthcare]] (formerly [[IDX Systems Corporation|IDX]] Systems and [[Centricity]]). Many reference laboratories, such as [[Quest Diagnostics]] <ref>[http://www.slideshare.net/george.james/missioncritical-ajaxmaking-test-ordering-easier-and-faster-at-quest-diagnostics?type=powerpoint Mission-critical Ajax: Making Test Ordering Easier and Faster at Quest Diagnostics]</ref> and Dynacare, use MUMPS software written or based on by Antrim Corporation code. Antrim, and its parent Sunquest, was acquired by Misys in 2001.<ref>[http://www.secinfo.com/dsvr4.4Fc4m.3.htm SEC Info: Misys Purchase of Sunquest]</ref> Coventry Healthcare and Massachusetts Hospital have also been reported to use MUMPS. MUMPS is also widely used in financial applications. MUMPS gained an early following in the financial sector, and MUMPS applications are in use at many banks and credit unions. It is used by [[Ameritrade]], the largest online trading service in the US with over 12 billion transactions per day, as well as by the [[Bank of England]] and [[Barclays Bank]], among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.m21.uk.com/newtom.php|title=Welcome to M21 -- the database for the 21st Century}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intersystems.com/industry/financial/intersystems-in-financial.html|title=Caché-based Financial Systems}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idea.cz/en/references|title=IDEA Turn-Key financial/manufacturing applications}}</ref> The European Space Agency announced on May 13, 2010 that it will use MUMPS ([[InterSystems Caché]]) to support the [[Gaia]] mission.

The latter is being aggressively marketed by InterSystems and has had success in penetrating new markets, such as telecommunications, in addition to existing markets. ==Overview== MUMPS is a language intended for and designed to build database applications. Secondary language features were included to help programmers make applications using minimal computing resources. The original implementations were [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreted]], though modern implementations may be fully or partially [[Compiler|compiled]]. Individual "programs" run in memory "partitions". Early MUMPS memory partitions were limited to 2048 bytes so aggressive abbreviation greatly aided multi-programming on severely resource limited hardware, because more than one MUMPS job could fit into the very small memories extant in hardware at the time. The ability to provide multi-user systems was another language design. The '''M'''ulti-'''P'''rogramming in the acronym of language name point to this. Even the earliest machines running MUMPS supported multiple jobs running at the same time. With the change from mini-computers to micro-computers a few years later, even a "single user PC" with a single 8-bit CPU with 16K or 64K of memory could support multiple users, running [[dumb
