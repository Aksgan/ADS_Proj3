Larger projects have also been undertaken, including their complete removal from [[Ascension Island]]. The cats, introduced in the 19th century, caused a collapse in populations of nesting [[seabird]]s. The project to remove them from the island began in 2002, and the island was cleared of cats by 2004. Since then, seven species of seabird that had not nested on the island for 100 years have returned.<ref>http://www.birdlife.org/news/news/2005/07/ascension.html Stamps celebrate seabird return. Birdlife.org. July 27, 2005.</ref> In some cases, the removal of cats had unintended consequences. An example is [[Macquarie Island]] (off the coast of [[Tasmania]]), where the removal of cats caused an explosion in the number of rabbits, rats, and mice that harm native seabirds.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/environment/up-against-rats-rabbits-and-costs/2007/04/11/1175971183257.html?page=fullpage | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Up against rats, rabbits and costs | date=2007-04-12}}</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200607/s1687413.htm ABC News online - Fears for sub-antarctic island plagued by rabbits]</ref><ref>[http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=718505 Nine News - Cat kill devastates Macquarie Island]</ref> The removal of the rats and rabbits was scheduled for 2007 and it could take up to seven years and cost $24 million.<ref>[http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/macquarie/rabbitsfaq.html Parks and Wildlife Service, Tasmania - Plan for the Eradication of Rabbits and Rodents on Macquarie Island]</ref> ===Hybridisation with wild felids=== Feral cats have interbred with [[wildcat]]s to various extents throughout the world, the first reported case occurring more than 200 years ago. The significance of hybridisation is disputed and hinges on whether the domestic cat is classified as [[conspecific]] with the wildcat or a [[Cat#Etymology_and_taxonomic_history|separate species]].<ref name="IUCN"/>(see [[Genetic pollution]]) In some locations, high levels of hybridisation has led to difficulties in distinguishing a "true" wildcat from feral domestic and domestic hybrid cats, which can complicate conservation efforts.<ref>[http://www.arkive.org/european-wildcat/felis-silvestris-grampia/info.html European wildcat (Felis silvestris grampia)] Arkive.org</ref> Some researchers argue that "pure" wildcats do not exist anymore, but this is disputed by others.<ref name="IUCN">[http://www.catsg.org/catsgportal/cat-website/catfolk/wilder07.htm European wildcat species account] IUCN Species Survival Commission.

''Molecular Ecology'' (2001) '''10''': 319â€“336.</ref> ==Zoonotic risk== There is concern about the role of feral cat colonies, [[Dog|wild dogs]], and other native mammals, as a vector of diseases, particularly [[toxoplasmosis]], [[giardiasis]] (esp. from beavers), [[rabies]] (e.g. raccoons), ''[[Campylobacter]]'', [[Parvovirus]] and other diseases and parasites that can infect both humans and animals. Felids such as cougars and cats, the mammals they feed on, and undercooked meat and chicken are a source of ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'', which causes toxoplasmosis.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/toxoplasmosis/]</ref> <!-- Article reference does not back up this speculative statement. The [[sea otter]] population on the [[California]] coast have decreased, and many of these dead otters are found to have [[toxoplasmosis]] infections.

The term is used primarily when a noticeable population of feral cats live together in a specific location and use a common food source. The term is not typically applied to solitary cats passing through an area. A colony can range from 3-5 cats to about 100 cats. Their locations vary, some hiding in alleyways or in large parks. Members consist of adult females, their young, and some adult males. Unneutered males in a colony fight each other for turf and for females. Some will be driven out to find another place to live. Feral cats who have been trapped in many warm areas where fleas exist are usually found to have a large number of fleas, causing them to be anemic. Both the fleas, and the food source, if limited to garbage and rodents, cause the cats to have intestinal microorganisms (such as coccidia or giardia) and other parasites (commonly known as roundworms, tapeworms, and hookworms), which lead to diarrhea and subsequent dehydration. They also can have ear mites, ringworm, and upper respiratory infections. Others are wounded in mating-fights and die from the infected wounds. Still others eventually contract [[feline immunodeficiency virus]] or [[feline leukemia]] due to the constant transmission of blood and bodily fluids via fighting and sexual activity. While all of these illnesses are quite treatable, there must be humans to intervene to stop these illnesses from becoming fatal. Due to the number of health problems to which they are subjected, and their fragile immune systems, kittens in the colony sometimes do not survive. ===Control and management=== {{See also|Animal population control}} {{Cleanup|section|date=November 2010}} [[File:Herd of Cats.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A colony of feral cats]] In [[Trap-Neuter-Return]] (TNR), volunteers trap feral cats, [[Sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilize]] them through [[neutering|spaying or neutering]], and then release them, though some do keep kittens or cats which are more tame. Variations of the program include testing and [[Feline vaccination|inoculation]] against [[rabies]] and other viruses and sometimes long-lasting [[flea treatment]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saveacat.org/faq.html#9|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=saveacat.org|accessdate=21 November 2010}}</ref> TNR programs are only now being introduced in some urban and suburban areas, such as [[Adelaide]].
