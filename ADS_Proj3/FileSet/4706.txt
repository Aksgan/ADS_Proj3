the end of life announcement, work on the next release codenamed Sedna (named after a [[90377 Sedna|recently discovered dwarf planet]]) which was built on top of the VFP9 codebase had already begun. "Sedna" is a set of add-ons to VFP 9.0 of xBase components to support a number of interoperability scenarios with various Microsoft technologies including [[Microsoft SQL Server|SQL Server]] 2005, [[.NET Framework]], Windows Vista, Office 2007, Windows Search and [[Team Foundation Server]] (TFS). Microsoft released Sedna under the [[Shared source]] license on the [[CodePlex]] site. Microsoft has clarified that the VFP core will still remain closed source. Sedna was released on January 25, 2008<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=C04BCF8C-0944-49F0-AC2B-563518CE1D70&displaylang=en Microsoft SEDNA download]</ref>. As of March 2008, all xBase components of the VFP 9 SP2 (including Sedna) were available for community-development on CodePlex. In late March 2007 a [[grassroots]] campaign was started by the Spanish-speaking FoxPro community at MasFoxPro<ref>[http://www.masfoxpro.com MasFoxPro]</ref> (MoreFoxPro in [[English language|English]]) to sign a petition to Microsoft to continue updating Visual FoxPro or release it to the community as [[Open Source]]. On April 3, 2007 the movement was noted by the technical press<ref>[http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=361 Developers petition Microsoft to reconsider FoxPro phase out] Posted by Mary Jo Foley (April 3rd, 2007) - All about Microsoft - ZDNet.com</ref> Also on April 3, 2007 Microsoft responded to the petitioner's requests with this statement from [[Alan Griver]]: <blockquote> "We're very aware of the FoxPro community and that played a large part in what we announced on March 13th. It's never an easy decision to announce that we're not going to release another version of a product and it's one that we consider very carefully. <p> "We're not announcing the end of FoxPro: Obviously, FoxPro applications will continue to work. By some of our internal estimates, there are more applications running in FoxPro 2.6 than there are in VFP and FoxPro 2.6 hasn't been supported in many years. Visual FoxPro 9 will be supported by Microsoft through 2015. <p> "For Microsoft to continue to evolve the FoxPro base, we would need to look at creating a 64-bit development environment and that would involve an almost complete rewrite of the core product. We've also invested in creating a scalable database with SQL Server, including the freely available SQL Server Express Edition. As far as forming a partnership with a third-party is concerned, we've heard from a number of large FoxPro customers that this would make it impossible for them to continue to use FoxPro since it would no longer be from an approved vendor. We felt that putting the environment into open source on CodePlex, which balances the needs of both the community and the large customers, was the best path forward." </blockquote> == Version information == === Operating system compatibility === {|class="wikitable" align="center" |+'''Supported Windows Versions''' |- !Version !VFP 3.0 !VFP 5.0 !VFP 6.0 !VFP 7.0 !VFP 8.0 !VFP 9.0 |- | style="background:#FFFF99; font-weight: bold" | Windows 3.x | style="background:#99FF99" align="center" | Yes | style="background:#FFCCCC" align="center" | No | style="background:#FFCCCC" align="center" | No | style="background:#FFCCCC" align="center" | No | style="background:#FFCCCC" align="center" | No | style="background:#FFCCCC" align="center" | No |- | style="background:#FFFF99; font-weight: bold" | Windows NT 4.0 | style="background:#99FF99" align="center" | Yes | style="background:#99FF99" align="center" | Yes | style="background:#99FF99" align="center" | Yes | style="background:#99FF99" align="center" | Yes | style="background:#FFCCCC" align="center" | No | style="background:#FFCCCC" align="center" | No <ref>- The free patch for VFP 9.0 has been created by the German FoxPro User Group (dFPUG) and is available at the dFPUG document portal in the directory http://portal.dfpug.de/dFPUG/Dokumente/Freeware/.
