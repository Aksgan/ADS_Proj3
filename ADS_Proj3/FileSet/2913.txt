[[Windows SharePoint Services]] (WSS) adapters. [[Windows Communication Foundation|WCF]] adapter was added with 2006 R2. Microsoft also ships [[BizTalk Adapter Pack]] that includes WCF based adapters for Line of Business systems. Currently, this includes adapters for [[SAP ERP|SAP]], [[Oracle Database|Oracle]] database, [[Oracle E-Business Suite]], [[SQL]], and [[Siebel]]. ==See also== * [[Password Change Notification Service]] ''(PCNS)'' ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.microsoft.com/biztalk/en/us/default.aspx Official Microsoft BizTalk Server site] [[Category:Microsoft software]] [[Category:Middleware]] [[da:Microsoft BizTalk Server]] [[de:Microsoft BizTalk]] [[es:Microsoft BizTalk Server]] [[fr:Microsoft BizTalk Server]] [[it:Microsoft BizTalk Server]] [[nl:Microsoft BizTalk Server]] [[ja:Microsoft BizTalk Server]] [[pl:BizTalk]] [[ru:Microsoft BizTalk Server]] [[sv:Microsoft BizTalk Server]] [[zh:Microsoft BizTalk Server]]</text> </page> <page> <id>24441</id> <title>Microsoft CryptoAPI</title> <text>{{Confusing|date=January 2009}} The '''Cryptographic Application Programming Interface''' (also known variously as '''CryptoAPI''', '''Microsoft Cryptography API''', or simply '''CAPI''') is an [[application programming interface]] included with [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating system]]s that provides services to enable developers to secure Windows-based applications using [[cryptography]]. It is a set of [[Dynamic-link library|dynamically-linked libraries]] that provides an [[abstraction layer]] which isolates programmers from the code used to encrypt the data. The Crypto API was first introduced in Windows NT 4.0 <ref> [http://www.microsoft.com/msj/archive/S413.aspx Poking Around Under the Hood: A Programmer's View of Windows NT 4.0] </ref> and enhanced in subsequent versions. CryptoAPI supports both [[Public-key cryptography|public-key]] and [[Symmetric key algorithm|symmetric key]] cryptography. It includes functionality for encrypting and decrypting data and for [[authentication]] using [[digital certificate]]s. It also includes a [[cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator]] function [[CryptGenRandom]]. CryptoAPI works with a number of CSPs ([[Cryptographic Service Provider]]s) installed on the machine. CSPs are the modules that do the actual work of encoding and decoding data by performing the cryptographic functions. ==Cryptography API: Next Generation== [[Windows Vista]] features an update to the Crypto API known as '''Cryptography API: Next Generation (CNG)'''. It has better API factoring to allow the same functions to work using a wide range of cryptographic algorithms, and the inclusion of a number of newer algorithms that are part of the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) [http://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/suiteb_cryptography/index.shtml Suite B]. It is also flexible, featuring support for plugging in custom cryptographic APIs into the CNG runtime. CNG works in both [[user mode|user]] and [[kernel mode]], and also supports all of the algorithms from the CryptoAPI. The Microsoft provider that implements CNG is housed in Bcrypt.dll. CNG also supports [[elliptic curve cryptography]] which is also secure and uses shorter keys than RSA.<ref>[http://www.nsa.gov/business/programs/elliptic_curve.shtml The Case for Elliptic Curve Cryptography, NSA]</ref> The CNG API integrates with the [[smart card]] subsystem by including a Base Smart Card Cryptographic Service Provider (Base CSP) module which encapsulates the smart card API. Smart card manufacturers just have to make their devices compatible with this, rather than provide a from-scratch solution. CNG also adds support to Dual_EC_DRBG<ref name="Schneier">{{cite web |url=http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/12/dual_ec_drbg_ad.html |title=Dual_EC_DRBG Added to Windows Vista |last=Schneier |first=Bruce |authorlink=Bruce Schneier |date=December 17, 2007 |work=Schneier on Security |accessdate=January 13, 2010}}</ref>, a [[pseudorandom number generator]] defined in NIST SP 800-90 that could expose the user to eavesdropping by the [[National Security Agency]] unless the user remembers to generate new random numbers with a different [[cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator]] or a [[true random number generator]] and then publishing the generated seed in order to make it secure.

CNG also replaces the default PRNG with CTR_DRBG using AES as the block cipher, because the earlier RNG which is defined in the now superseded FIPS 186-2 is based on either [[DES]] or [[SHA-1]], both which have been broken<ref>{{cite web |url=http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/archive/fips186-2/fips186-2.pdf |title=FIPS PUB 186-2 |publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] |work=[[Federal Information Processing Standard]]s |date=January 27, 2000 |accessdate=January 13, 2010}}</ref>.

It was discontinued though many of its core functions were moved to an add-in for the [[Microsoft Dynamics]] CRM product.<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/serviceproviders/ccf/default.mspx]</ref> The Customer Care Framework provided a core set of functions for customer support avenues including voice call via call center agents and Internet portals. The framework leveraged other Microsoft server products including the BizTalk Server, and SharePoint. CCF required the use of [[Microsoft SQL Server]] and [[Internet Information Services|Microsoft IIS]] for the server side, which it uses to provide a base core set of web services. CCF is targeted at medium to large enterprises. CCF was originally developed for the large [[call center]] requirements of the [[telecommunication]] industry. CCF is different from most products from Microsoft in that it is not an 'out of the box' solution but requires development and configuration to build a working customer solution. The framework allows for a [[Service-oriented architecture|SOA]] methodology<ref>Microsoft, Customer Care Framework 2005 .NET 2.0 Edition Deployment Guide, (September 2006), 8-9</ref><ref>Microsoft, [https://msevents.microsoft.com/cui/WebCastEventDetails.aspx?culture=en-US&EventID=1032289121&CountryCode=US MSDN Webcast: Customer Care Framework (Level 300)].
