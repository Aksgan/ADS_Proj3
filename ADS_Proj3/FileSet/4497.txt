Lisa discovered Judith Montcrieff and her pioneering efforts with Unique Editions and Tradigital Fine Art, in the early 1990s, found the term, "Tradigital", and also used the term to describe her own work.<ref name="lisawrayart.com"/> ==Other uses of the term== Since then, use of the term has greatly expanded to include other art forms. In 2002, "tradigital" went mainstream when [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] used the term '''tradigital animation''' to refer to the blending of computer animation with classical [[cell animation]] techniques, "a seamless blend of two-dimensional and three-dimensional animation techniques".<ref>Thomas Doherty, [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&p_theme=bg&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=106FA0A1A27D07B8&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM "Sense and Cinematography"], ''The Boston Globe'', Dec 12, 2004.</ref> He mentioned as examples such animation films as [[Toy Story]], [[Antz]], [[Shrek]], [[Ice Age (film)]], and [[Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron]].<ref>Dave Kehr, [http://movies.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?res=9A04E6DE1F38F937A15756C0A9649C8B63 "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"], ''The New York Times'', May 24, 2002.</ref><ref>John Canemaker, [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E0DC1430F931A25756C0A9649C8B63 "SUMMER MOVIES; Flat Worlders Face the Horizon and See It's in 3-D"], ''The New York Times'', May 12, 2002.</ref><ref>Jane Horwitz, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A2169-2002May23 Stallion vs. Iron Horse: A Galloping Good Tale], ''The Washington Post'', May 24, 2002.</ref><ref>Todd Leopold, [http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Movies/05/22/ca.s02.spirit.katzenberg/index.html "The 'Spirit' of a movie mogul"], ''CNN'', May 22, 2002.</ref><ref>Nina Rehfeld, [http://www.welt.de/print-wams/article104216/Die_Zukunft_der_Maerchen.html "Die Zukunft der Märchen"], ''Die Welt'', Dec. 1, 2002.</ref><ref>Roger Moore, "The 'Spirit' of Jeffrey Katzenberg," ''The Orlando Sentinel'', May 24, 2002.</ref> He believed that [[Walt Disney]] (a [[traditional art]] animator) would approve of the changes in the way cartoons are made today.

'''Tradigital printing''' is an experimental approach to [[printmaking]] with contemporary technology. In one form of tradigital printing, printmakers use computers to generate positives for UV photo transfer to plates and screens. In another form, digital print output incorporating [[silkscreen]], relief or [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] techniques is the focus.<ref>Aine Scannell, [http://tradigitalprintmaking.blogspot.com ''Tradigital Printmaking''].</ref> For example, the Josephine Press<ref>Josephine Press, [http://www.josephinepress.com/tradigital.html ''Tradigital Printmaking''].</ref> uses a process that combines the use of archival digital prints with traditional techniques such as intaglio, [[woodcut]]s, [[lithograph]]s, and all of the other traditional printmaking methods. The process allows the artist to create a multi-color image without using a four-plate process. In addition to more efficient registration, the artist can work with collage and other mixed media works that can be scanned and reproduced in an archival manner. Tradigital printing greatly expands the possibilities of image-making while still producing an original hand pulled, limited edition, fine art print. A recent Wall Street Journal article hailed '''tradigital creatives''' as the "voice of tomorrow"<ref>Manish Sinha, [http://www.livemint.com/2008/08/14151616/Web-Exclusive--Creativity-in.html "Creativity in tradigital times"], The Wall Street Journal, Aug 14 2008.</ref>, contrasting them with both "traditionalists" and "digitalists", and identifying several distinguishing characteristics of the new art/marketing medium: voices not eyeballs; experience not messages; community not communication; utility and solutions not cleverness; collaborative not silo thinkers. ==Tradigital artists== * [[Judith Moncrieff]] * [[Helen Golden]] * [[Lisa Wray]] * [[Dorothy Krause]] * [[Bonny Lhotka]] * [[Belle Twigg]] * [[Karin Schminke]] * [[Merrill Kazanjian]] * [[Nathaniel Stern]] ==See also== {{multicol}} * [[Art software]] * [[Computer art]] * [[Digital art]] * [[New Media Art]] * [[Internet art]] * [[Electronic art]] * [[Systems art]] {{col-break}} * [[Cyberarts]] * [[Computer art scene]] * [[Computer graphics]] * [[Digital illustration]] * [[Digital painting]] * [[Software art]] {{col-end}} ==References== {{reflist|2}} ==External links== {{DEFAULTSORT:Tradigital Art}} [[Category:Art media]] [[Category:Computer art]] [[Category:Tradigital art]] [[Category:Digital art]] [[Category:New media]] [[Category:Electronic music]] [[Category:Art genres]] [[Category:Conceptual art]] [[Category:Postmodern art]] [[Category:Contemporary art]]</text> </page> <page> <id>38029</id> <title>Traffic camera</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=July 2008}} {{cleanup|date=July 2009}} [[Image:Traffic camera - Lake Albert Road and Sturt Highway.jpg|thumb|Traffic camera mounted on a traffic light pole at a intersection on the [[Sturt Highway]] in [[Wagga Wagga, New South Wales|Wagga Wagga]].]]A '''traffic camera''' is a [[video camera]] which [[observe]]s vehicular [[traffic]] on a [[road]]. Typically, these are put along major roads such as [[highway]]s, [[freeway]]s, [[motorway]]s, [[autoroute]]s and [[expressway]]s, as well as [[arterial road]]s, and are connected with [[optical fiber]]s buried alongside or even under the road. A [[Surveillance|monitoring]] center receives the live [[video]] in real time, and serves as a [[dispatcher]] if there is an [[traffic collision]] or some other disruptive incident or [[road safety]] issue. [[Internet]] users can often view [[screenshot|individual frame]]s posted to a [[website]] every few minutes, and can then determine whether an alternate [[road number|route]] should be taken. Traffic cameras are a major part of most [[intelligent transportation system]]s. They are especially valuable in [[tunnel]]s, where safety equipment can be activated [[remote control|remote]]ly based upon information provided by the cameras and other [[sensor]]s. On surface roads, they are typically mounted on high [[Utility pole|pole]]s or [[Radio masts and towers|mast]]s, sometimes along with [[street light]]s. On arterial roads, they are often mounted on [[traffic light]] poles at [[intersection (road)|intersection]]s, where problems are most likely to occur.

Those cameras take [[still photo]]s in a much higher [[image resolution]] upon a [[Image trigger|trigger]], whereas traffic cameras are simply for observation and constantly take lower-resolution full-motion video. Online Traffic Cameras are cameras linked to online websites that enable the public to view real time traffic conditions online. These [[webcam]]s usually refresh every minute and can be viewed from official websites. ==External links== *[http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/trafficreports/innersydcameras/index.html Live traffic cameras in Sydney, Australia] [[Roads and Traffic Authority]] *[http://www.mainroads.qld.gov.au/web/publicCR.nsf/DOCINDEX/Live+traffic+web+cameras Live traffic cameras in Queensland, Australia] [[Department of Main Roads (Queensland)|Department of Main Roads]] *[http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/traffic/cameras/ Traffic cameras in the State of New Jersey] [[New Jersey Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] *[http://www.howsthetraffic.co.nz Live traffic cameras in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, New Zealand] {{DEFAULTSORT:Traffic Camera}} [[Category:Intelligent transportation systems]] [[ta:போக்குவரத்துப் படக்கருவி]]</text> </page> <page> <id>38034</id> <title>Traffic optimization</title> <text>'''Traffic
