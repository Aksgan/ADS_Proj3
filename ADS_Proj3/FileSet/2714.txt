interprocessor link * Power-down SLEEP mode * Extended memory addressing == Outline == The M50734SP/FP and the M50734SP/FP-10 are unique CMOS LSI microprocessor with UART, clocked serial I/O, A-D converter, VCU, watchdog timer and 32-bit parallel I/O arranged around the M5040 CPU core. Since the M50734SP has multiple internal timers for real-time control, it is ideal for controlling office automation equipment such as printers, typewriters, plotters, copy machines, FAX and handy word processors. Use of the CMOS process enables low power consumption, making the M50734SP also suitable for applications where battery-powered operation is required. The difference between the M50734SP and the M50734FP, or between the M50734SP-10 and the M50734FP-10 lies only in the package. The difference between the M50734SP/FP and the M50734SP/FP-10 lies only in the clock frequency (max).

Unlike other famous humanoids such as [[ASIMO]], MAHRU and AHRA focus on network-based intelligence by using network infrastructure where [[South Korea]] has world-class strengths. <ref>http://humanoid.kist.re.kr/new/eng/mahruahra/info_01.php</ref> ==Specification== Height & weight : 1.5 m, 67 kg, 1.2 km/h Degree of freedom (DOF) : 35 Sensors : Stereo camera, microphone, force/[[torque]] sensor, gyro sensor Battery : lithium polymer battery, 48V-20A Images / Voices / Objects / Gestures Recognition<ref>http://humanoid.kist.re.kr/new/eng/mahruahra/spe_01.php</ref> ==Intelligence== MAHRU and AHRA are Korea's own humanoid models that provide artificial intelligence to robots, such as image/voice recognition and vision-based manipulation, in order to make friendly human-robot interaction possible. MAHRU and AHRA can walk forward, backward, left and right and, have intelligence for the recognition of voice, face, objects, gestures, obstacles, and vision-based manipulation.<ref>http://humanoid.kist.re.kr/new/eng/mahruahra/intel_01.php</ref> ==Mahru-Z== Mahru-Z has a [[humanoid]] body including a rotating head, arms, legs, six fingers, and [[three-dimensional]] vision.<ref>[http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/SKorean_scientists_develop_walking_robot_maid_999.html S.Korean scientists develop walking robot maid], spacedaily.com, January 18, 2010</ref> ==References== {{reflist}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Mahru}} [[Category:Humanoid robots]]</text> </page> <page> <id>22855</id> <title>MASSIVE (software)</title> <text>[[Image:MASSIVE battle.jpg|thumb|260px|right|A battle simulated using ''Massive''.]] '''''MASSIVE''''' (Multiple Agent Simulation System in Virtual Environment) is a high-end [[computer animation]] and [[artificial intelligence]] software package used for generating crowd-related visual effects for film and television. ==Overview== ''Massive'' is a software package developed by [[Stephen Regelous]] for the visual effects industry. Its flagship feature is the ability to quickly and easily create thousands - or millions - of agents that all act as individuals. Through the use of [[fuzzy logic]], the software enables every agent to respond individually to its surroundings, including other agents. These reactions affect the agent's behaviour, changing how they act by controlling pre-recorded animation clips, for example by blending between such clips, to create characters that move, act, and react realistically. These pre-recorded animation clips can come from motion-capture sessions, or can be hand-animated in other 3D animation software packages. In addition to the [[artificial intelligence]] abilities of Massive, there are numerous other features, including cloth simulation, [[rigid body dynamics]] and graphics processing unit ([[GPU]]) based hardware rendering. Massive Software has also created several pre-built agents ready to perform certain tasks, such as stadium crowd agents, rioting 'mayhem' agents and simple agents who walk around and talk to each other. ==History== ''Massive'' was originally developed in Wellington, New Zealand. [[Peter Jackson]] required software that allowed armies of hundreds of thousands of soldiers to fight, a problem that had not been solved in filmmaking before. Regelous created ''Massive'' to allow [[Weta Digital]] to create many of the award-winning visual effects, particularly the battle sequences, for the ''[[The Lord of the Rings#The Lord of the Rings on film|Lord of the Rings]]'' trilogy of films. Since then, it has evolved into a complete product and has been licensed by many other visual effects houses. ==In production== ''Massive'' has been used in many productions, both commercials and feature-length films, small-scale and large. Some significant examples include: *''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' *''[[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|The Lord of the Rings]]'' *''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'' *''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' (Jackson 2005) *''[[Flags of Our Fathers (film)|Flags of our Fathers]]'' (besides battle and crowd scenes, even shots of seacraft crossing the Pacific were created with Massive) *''[[Carlton Draught: Big Ad]]'' *''[[Mountain (advert)|Mountain]]'', a television commercial for the [[PlayStation 2]] console *''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]] *''[[Category 7: The End of the World]]'' *''[[Blades of Glory]]'' *''[[Eragon (film)|Eragon]]'' *''[[Happy Feet]]'' *''[[300 (film)|300]]'' *''[[The Ant Bully (film)|The Ant Bully]]'' (the first film to use computer animated characters as Massive agents rather than motion capture. Also first to use facial animation within Massive) *''[[Doctor Who]]'' ("[[Partners in Crime (Doctor Who)|Partners in Crime]]" is the first example of Massive used in television.) *''[[Changeling (film)|Changeling]]'' *''[[Speed Racer (film)|Speed Racer]]'' (Car A.I. and crowds) *''[[Wall-E]]'' *[[Up (2009 film)]] ==See also== *[[Crowd simulation]] *[[Fuzzy logic]] *[[Emergence]] *[[NetLogo]] - multi-agent programming language and integrated modelling environment ==External links== *[http://www.massivesoftware.com/ Official site of Massive Software] *[http://www.wetadigital.com/ Official site of Weta Digital] ==Educational Partners== *'''Americas''' **Ringling School Of Art & Design - Sarasota, FL http://www.ringling.edu/ **Savannah College Of Art & Design - Savannah, GA http://www.scad.edu/ **Gnomon School Of Visual Effects - Hollywood, CA http://www.gnomonschool.com/ **USC School of Cinematic Arts - Los Angeles, CA http://www-cntv.usc.edu/ **Coastal Carolina University - Conway, SC http://www.coastal.edu/ **Drexel University - Philadelphia, PA http://www.drexel.edu/ *'''Europe''' **Bournemouth University - Dorset, United Kingdom National Centre for Computer Animation http://ncca.bournemouth.ac.uk/ **University of Teesside - Middlesbrough, United Kingdom School of Computing http://www-scm.tees.ac.uk/ *'''Asia Pacific''' **Media Design School - Auckland, New Zealand http://www.mediadesign.school.nz/ **Kasetsart University - Chatuchak, Bangkok http://www.ku.ac.th/aboutku/english/ {{Primarysources|date=December 2006}} {{3D software}} [[Category:3D graphics software]] [[Category:Animation software]] [[de:Massive]] [[fr:MASSIVE (logiciel)]] [[it:Massive (software)]] [[ja:MASSIVE]] [[fi:Massive]]</text> </page> <page> <id>22858</id> <title>MATHLAB</title> <text>{{about||the numerical computer environment|MATLAB}} '''MATHLAB''' is a [[computer algebra system]] created in 1964 by [[Carl Engelman]] at [[MITRE]] and written in [[LISP]].
