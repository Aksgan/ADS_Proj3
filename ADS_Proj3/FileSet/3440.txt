are exponential in the size of the set.<ref name=hayes>{{Harvnb|Hayes|2002}}</ref> Both heuristics have a [[running time]] of <math>O(n^2)</math> or less. The greedy algorithm is known to give a 4/3-[[approximation algorithm|approximation]] to the optimal solution of the optimization version. (In other words, if the greedy algorithm gives two sets <math>S_1, S_2</math>, then <math>\max(\operatorname{sum}(S_1), \operatorname{sum}(S_2)) \le 4/3\mathrm{OPT}</math>.) More generally, we can consider a version that takes the <math>K</math> largest elements, and for each partition of them, extends the partition by adding the remaining elements successively to whichever set is smaller. (The greedy algorithm corresponds to <math>K=2</math>.) This version runs in time <math>O(2^K n^2)</math> and is known to give a <math>(K+2)/(K+1)</math> approximation; thus we have a [[polynomial-time approximation scheme]] (PTAS) for the number partition problem, though this is not an FPTAS (the running time is exponential in the desired approximation guarantee). However, there are variations of this idea that ''are'' fully polynomial-time approximation schemes for the subset-sum problem, and hence for the partition problem as well.<ref name=knapsack/> On the other hand, the problem of minimizing the ''square'' of the difference <math>\left(\operatorname{sum}(S_1)-\operatorname{sum}(S_2)\right)^2</math> has no FPTAS unless P=NP.<ref name=whenfptas/> There are also [[anytime algorithm]]s, based on the differencing heuristic, that first find the solution returned by the differencing heuristic, then find progressively better solutions as time allows (possibly requiring exponential time to reach optimality, for the worst instances).<ref>{{Harvnb|Korf|1998}}, {{Harvnb|Mertens|1999}}</ref> ==Hard instances== When the values are small compared to the size of the set, perfect partitions are more likely. Of the 10 billion sets of 10 integers in 1 to 10, {{gaps|9|989|770|790}} of them have a perfect partition, into two sets of equal sum.<ref name=hayes/> The problem is known to undergo a "phase transition", being easy for <math>m/n < 1</math> and hard otherwise (the probability of a perfect partition goes to 1 and 0 respectively). This was originally argued using methods from physics by Stephan Mertens,<ref>{{Harvnb|Mertens|1998}}, {{Harvnb|Mertens|2001}}</ref> and later proved by [[Christian Borgs|Borgs]], [[Jennifer Tour Chayes|Chayes]], and [[Boris Pittel|Pittel]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Borgs|Chayes|Pittel|2001}}</ref> == See also == * [[Subset sum problem]] * [[Bin packing problem]] == Notes == {{reflist|refs= <ref name=knapsack>{{citation | year=2004 | title = Knapsack problems | author1=Hans Kellerer | author2=Ulrich Pferschy | author3=David Pisinger | publisher=Springer | isbn=9783540402862 | page=97 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=u5DB7gck08YC&pg=PA97}}</ref> <ref name=whenfptas>{{Citation | doi = 10.1287/ijoc.12.1.57.11901 | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–74 | last = Woeginger | first = Gerhard J. | title = When Does a Dynamic Programming Formulation Guarantee the Existence of a Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (FPTAS)? | journal = Informs Journal on Computing | accessdate = 2009-10-05 | date = 2000-01-01 | url = http://joc.journal.informs.org/cgi/content/abstract/12/1/57 }}</ref> }} ==References== * {{citation | url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2002/3/the-easiest-hard-problem |title=The Easiest Hard Problem | magazine=[[American Scientist]] | last=Hayes|first=Brian|authorlink=Brian Hayes (scientist) | date=May-June 2002 }} *{{Citation | last = Karmarkar | first = Narenda | last2= Karp | first2 = Richard M | title = The Differencing Method of Set Partitioning | journal = Technical Report UCB/CSD 82/113 | publisher = Computer Science Division (EECS) | location = University of California at Berkeley | year = 1982 }} *{{Citation | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.4281 | volume = 81 | issue = 20 | pages = 4281 | last = Mertens | first = Stephan | title = Phase Transition in the Number Partitioning Problem | journal = Physical Review Letters | accessdate = 2009-10-03 | date = November 1998 | url = http://link.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v81/p4281 }} * {{Citation | doi = 10.1016/S0304-3975(01)00153-0 | last = Mertens | first = Stephan | title = A physicist's approach to number partitioning | journal = Theoretical Computer Science | volume = 265 | pages = 79–108 | accessdate = 2009-10-03 | year = 2001 }} *{{citation | year=2006 | chapter=The Easiest Hard Problem: Number Partitioning | last=Mertens|first=Stephan | title = Computational complexity and statistical physics | editor1=Allon Percus | editor2=Gabriel Istrate | editor3=Cristopher Moore | publisher=Oxford University Press US | isbn=9780195177374 | page=125 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=4YD6AxV95zEC&pg=PA125}} {{arXiv|cond-mat/0310317v2}} *{{Citation | doi = 10.1002/rsa.10004 | volume = 19 | issue = 3-4 | pages = 247–288 | last1 = Borgs | first1 = Christian | last2 = Chayes | first2 = Jennifer | last3 = Pittel | first3 = Boris | title = Phase transition and finite-size scaling for the integer partitioning problem | journal = Random Structures and Algorithms | accessdate = 2009-10-04 | year = 2001 | url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.89.9577 }} * {{Citation | doi = 10.1016/S0004-3702(98)00086-1 | issn = 0004-3702 | volume = 106 | issue = 2 | pages = 181–203 | last = Korf | first = Richard E. | title = A complete anytime algorithm for number partitioning | journal = Artificial Intelligence | accessdate = 2009-10-04 | year = 1998 | url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.90.993 }} *{{Citation | last = Mertens | first = Stephan | title = A complete anytime algorithm for balanced number partitioning | accessdate = 2009-10-04 | year = 1999 }} {{arXiv|cs/9903011}} [[Category:NP-complete problems]] {{comp-sci-stub}} [[cs:Problém dvou loupežníků]] [[de:Partitionsproblem]] [[es:Problema de la partición]] [[ko:분할 문제]] [[pl:Problem podziału]]</text> </page> <page> <id>28560</id> <title>Passive attack</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=December 2006}} A '''passive attack''' on a [[cryptosystem]] is one in which the cryptanalyst cannot interact with any of the parties involved, attempting to break the system solely based upon observed data (i.e. the [[ciphertext]]). This can also include known plaintext attacks where both the [[plaintext]] and its corresponding ciphertext are known. While most classical ciphers are vulnerable to this form of attack, most modern ciphers are designed to prevent this type of attack above all others. == Attributes == *Traffic Analysis *Non-evasive [[eavesdropping]] and monitoring of transmissions *Because data unaffected, tricky to detect *Emphasis on prevention ([[encryption]]) not detection *Sometimes referred to as “tapping” Types of Passive Attacks are 1) Traffic Analysis 2)Release of message contents.
