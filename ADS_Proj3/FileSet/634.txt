It is often denoted ''Z,'' from German ''[[wikt:Zentrum|Zentrum]],'' meaning "center". More specifically: * The '''[[center of a group]]''' ''G'' consists of all those elements ''x'' in ''G'' such that ''xg'' = ''gx'' for all ''g'' in ''G''. This is a [[normal subgroup]] of ''G''. * The center of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''R'' is the subset of ''R'' consisting of all those elements ''x'' of ''R'' such that ''xr'' = ''rx'' for all ''r'' in ''R''. The center is a [[commutative ring|commutative]] [[subring]] of ''R'', and ''R'' is an [[algebra (ring theory)|algebra]] over its center. * The center of an [[algebra over a field|algebra]] ''A'' consists of all those elements ''x'' of ''A'' such that ''xa'' = ''ax'' for all ''a'' in ''A''. See also: [[central simple algebra]]. * The center of a [[Lie algebra]] ''L'' consists of all those elements ''x'' in ''L'' such that [''x'',''a''] = 0 for all ''a'' in ''L''. This is an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] of the Lie algebra ''L''. * The [[centre (category)|center]] of a [[monoidal category]] '''C''' consists of pairs ''(A,u)'' where ''A'' is an object of '''C''', and <math>u:A \otimes - \rightarrow - \otimes A</math> a natural isomorphism satisfying certain axioms. == References == Modern Algebra, R.

The Center is internationally active in the fields of [[complexity science]] and [[neuroscience]]. === Ph.D. program === Since 1994 the Center has offered a [[Ph.D.]] program in Complex Systems and Brain Sciences as well as post-doctoral research opportunities. The program was established through a [[training grant]] from the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] of the [[National Institutes of Health]]. This research and training program blends emerging concepts from complex dynamical systems with experimental
