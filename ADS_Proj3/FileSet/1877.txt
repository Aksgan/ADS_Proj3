}}</ref> Similar issues exist for large companies with thousands of desktop PCs. Smaller form factor drives often use less power than larger drives. One interesting development in this area is actively controlling the seek speed so that the head arrives at its destination only just in time to read the sector, rather than arriving as quickly as possible and then having to wait for the sector to come around (i.e. the rotational latency).{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Many of the hard drive companies are now producing Green Drives that require much less power and cooling. Many of these Green Drives spin slower (<5,400 rpm compared to 7,200, 10,000 or 15,000 rpm) and also generate less waste heat.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Power consumption can also be reduced by parking the drive heads when the disk is not in use reducing friction, adjusting spin speeds according to transfer rates, and disabling internal components when not in use.<ref> {{cite book |title=Green tech: how to plan and implement sustainable IT solutions |first=Lawrence |last=Webber |first2=Michael |last2=Wallace |isbn=081441446X |year=2009 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BKTALNq5ceAC&lpg=PA62&dq=green%20disk%20drive&pg=PA62#v=onepage&q=green%20disk%20drive&f=false |page=62 }}</ref> Also in systems where there might be multiple hard disk drives, there are various ways of controlling when the hard drives spin up since the highest current is drawn at that time. *On SCSI hard disk drives, the SCSI controller can directly control spin up and spin down of the drives. *On [[Parallel ATA]] (aka PATA) and [[Serial ATA]] (SATA) hard disk drives, some support [[power-up in standby]] or PUIS. The hard disk drive will not spin up until the controller or system BIOS issues a specific command to do so. This limits the power draw or consumption upon power on. *Some SATA II hard disk drives support staggered spin-up, allowing the computer to spin up the drives in sequence to reduce load on the power supply when booting.<ref> {{ cite news |title=Hitachi Deskstar 7K500 500GB HDD: As fast as it's big? |author=Trusted Reviews |date=2005-08-31 |http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/08/31/review_hitachi_7k500/ }}</ref> To further control or reduce power consumption, the hard disk drive can be spun down when not in use to reduce its power consumption. ===Audible noise=== Measured in [[A-weighting|dBA]], audible noise is significant for certain applications, such as [[digital video recorder|PVR]]s, digital audio recording and [[quiet PC|quiet computers]]. Low noise disks typically use [[fluid bearing]]s, slower rotational speeds (usually 5,400 rpm) and reduce the seek speed under load ([[Automatic Acoustic Management|AAM]]) to reduce audible clicks and crunching sounds. Drives in smaller form factors (e.g. 2.5 inch) are often quieter than larger drives. ===Shock resistance=== Shock resistance is especially important for mobile devices. Some laptops now include [[active hard drive protection]] that parks the disk heads if the machine is dropped, hopefully before impact, to offer the greatest possible chance of survival in such an event. Maximum shock tolerance to date is 350 [[Gravitational acceleration|g]] for operating and 1000 g for non-operating.<ref>[http://www.seagate.com/ww/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=5fb658a3fd20a110VgnVCM100000f5ee0a0aRCRD Momentus 5400.5 SATA 3Gb/s 320-GB Hard Drive]</ref> ==Access and interfaces== {{Ref improve section|date=July 2009}} Hard disk drives are accessed over one of a number of bus types, including parallel [[Advanced Technology Attachment|ATA]] (P-ATA, also called IDE or [[AT Attachment#EIDE and ATA-2|EIDE]]), [[Serial ATA]] (SATA), [[SCSI]], [[Serial Attached SCSI]] (SAS), and [[Fibre Channel]]. Bridge circuitry is sometimes used to connect hard disk drives to buses that they cannot communicate with natively, such as [[IEEE 1394 interface|IEEE 1394]], [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] and [[Small Computer System Interface|SCSI]]. For the [[ST-506]] interface, the data [[encoder|encoding]] scheme as written to the disk surface was also important. The first ST-506 disks used [[Modified Frequency Modulation]] (MFM) encoding, and transferred data at a rate of 5 [[megabit]]s per second. Later controllers using 2,7 [[Run Length Limited|RLL]] (or just "RLL") encoding caused 50% more data to appear under the heads compared to one rotation of an MFM drive, increasing data storage and data transfer rate by 50%, to 7.5 megabits per second. Many ST-506 interface disk drives were only specified by the manufacturer to run at the 1/3rd lower MFM data transfer rate compared to RLL, while other drive models (usually more expensive versions of the same drive) were specified to run at the higher RLL data transfer rate. In some cases, a drive had sufficient margin to allow the MFM specified model to run at the denser/faster RLL data transfer rate (not recommended nor guaranteed by manufacturers). Also, any RLL-certified drive could run on any MFM controller, but with 1/3 less data capacity and as much as 1/3rd less data transfer rate compared to its RLL specifications. [[Enhanced Small Disk Interface]] (ESDI) also supported multiple data rates (ESDI disks always used 2,7 RLL, but at 10, 15 or 20 megabits per second), but this was usually negotiated automatically by the disk drive and controller; most of the time, however, 15 or 20 megabit ESDI disk drives weren't downward compatible (i.e. a 15 or 20 megabit disk drive wouldn't run on a 10 megabit controller). ESDI disk drives typically also had jumpers to set the number of sectors per track and (in some cases) sector size. Modern hard drives present a consistent interface to the rest of the computer, no matter what data encoding scheme is used internally. Typically a [[Digital signal processor|DSP]] in the electronics inside the hard drive takes the raw analog voltages from the read head and uses [[Partial Response Maximum Likelihood|PRML]] and [[Reedâ€“Solomon error correction]]<ref>[http://gaussianwaves.blogspot.com/2008/06/reed-solomon-codes-introduction.html "Reed Solomon Codes - Introduction"] <!-- I wish I had a better reference --></ref> to decode the sector boundaries and sector data, then sends that data out the standard interface. That DSP also watches the error rate detected by [[error detection and correction]], and performs [[bad sector]] remapping, data collection for [[Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology]], and other internal tasks. [[SCSI]] originally had just one signaling frequency of 5 [[Hertz|MHz]] for a maximum data rate of 5 [[megabyte]]s/second over 8 parallel conductors, but later this was increased dramatically. The SCSI bus speed had no bearing on the disk's internal speed because of buffering between the SCSI bus and the disk drive's internal data bus; however, many early disk
