[[James Bradley]] discovered the [[aberration of light]].<ref name="Bradley1729"/> From this effect he determined that light must travel 10,210 times faster than the Earth in its orbit (the modern figure is 10,066 times faster) or, equivalently, that it would take light 8 minutes 12 seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth.<ref name="Bradley1729"/> ===19th and early 20th century=== In the 19th century [[Hippolyte Fizeau]] developed a method to determine the speed of light based on time-of-flight measurements on Earth and reported a value of {{val|315000|u=km/s}}. His method was improved upon by [[Léon Foucault]] who obtained a value of {{val|298000|u=km/s}} in 1862.<ref name="How"/> In the year 1856, [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber]] and [[Rudolf Kohlrausch]] measured the ratio of the electromagnetic and electrostatic units of charge, 1/√''ε''<sub>0</sub>''μ''<sub>0</sub>, by discharging a [[Leyden jar]], and found that its numerical value was very close to the speed of light as measured directly by Fizeau. The following year [[Gustav Kirchoff]] calculated that an electric signal in a [[electrical resistance|resistanceless]] wire travels along the wire at this speed.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Graneau |first1=P |last2=Assis |first2=AKT |title=Kirchhoff on the motion of electricity in conductors |journal=[[Apeiron (journal)|Apeiron]] |volume=19 |year=1994 |pages=19–25 |url=http://www.physics.princeton.edu/~mcdonald/examples/EM/kirchhoff_apc_102_529_57_english.pdf |accessdate=2010-10-21 }}</ref> In the early 1860s, Maxwell showed that according to the theory of electromagnetism which he was working on, that electromagnetic waves propagate in empty space<ref>{{cite book |title=College physics: reasoning and relationships |first1=Nicholas J. |last1=Giordano |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2009 |isbn=0-534-42471-6 |page=787 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BwistUlpZ7cC}}, [http://books.google.com/books?id=BwistUlpZ7cC&pg=PA787 Extract of page 787] </ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The riddle of gravitation |first1=Peter Gabriel |last1=Bergmann |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1992 |isbn=0-486-27378-4 |page=17 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WYxkrwMidp0C}}, [http://books.google.com/books?id=WYxkrwMidp0C&pg=PA17 Extract of page 17] </ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The equations: icons of knowledge |first1=Sander |last1=Bais |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-674-01967-9 |page=40 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jKbVuMSlJPoC}}, [http://books.google.com/books?id=jKbVuMSlJPoC&pg=PA40 Extract of page 40] </ref> at a speed equal to the above Weber/Kohrausch ratio, and drawing attention to the numerical proximity of this value to the speed of light as measured by Fizeau, he proposed that light is in fact an electromagnetic wave.<ref name=maxwellbio> {{cite web |last1=O'Connor |first1=JJ |last2=Robertson |first2=EF |date=November 1997 |title= James Clerk Maxwell |url= http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Maxwell.html |publisher=School of Mathematics and Statistics, [[University of St Andrews]] |accessdate=2010-10-13 }}</ref> It was thought at the time that empty space was filled with a background medium called the [[luminiferous aether]] in which the electromagnetic field existed. Some physicists thought that this aether acted as an absolute reference frame for all physics and therefore it should be possible to measure the motion of the Earth with respect to this medium. Beginning in the 1880s several experiments were performed to try to detect this motion, the most famous of which is [[Michelson–Morley experiment|the experiment]] performed by [[Albert Michelson]] and [[Edward Morley]] in 1887.<ref> {{Cite journal |last1=Michelson |first1=AA |last2=Morley |first2=EW |year=1887 |title=[[s:On the Relative Motion of the Earth and the Luminiferous Ether|On the Relative Motion of the Earth and the Luminiferous Ether]] |journal=[[American Journal of Science]] |volume=34 |pages=333–345 |doi= }}</ref> The detected motion was always less than the observational error. Modern experiments indicate that the two-way speed of light is [[isotropic]] (the same in every direction) to within 6 nanometers per second.<ref> {{Cite book | last = French | first = AP | year = 1983 | title = Special relativity | pages = 51–57 | publisher = Van Nostrand Reinhold | isbn = 0-442-30782-9 }}</ref> Because of this experiment [[Hendrik Lorentz]] proposed that the motion of the apparatus through the aether may cause the apparatus to [[Lorentz contraction|contract]] along its length in the direction of motion, by a factor such as to ensure that there is no interference fringes detected by the interferometer. Based on Lorentz's theory, Poincare concluded in 1904 that the speed of light is a limiting factor in dynamics.<ref> {{Cite book | last = French | first = AP | year = 2009 | title = Special relativity | pages = 63–64, 267| publisher = M I T | isbn = 0-7487-6422-4 }}</ref> In 1905 Einstein proposed that the speed of light in vacuum, measured by a non-accelerating observer, is independent of the motion of the source or observer. Using this and the principle of relativity as a basis he derived the [[special theory of relativity]], in which the speed of light in vacuum ''c'' featured as a fundamental parameter, also appearing in contexts unrelated to light.<ref> {{Cite book | last = French | first = AP | year = 1983 | title = Special relativity | pages = 3–4 | publisher = Van Nostrand Reinhold | isbn = 0-442-30782-9 }}</ref> ===Increased accuracy of ''c'' and redefinition of the metre=== {{See also|History of the metre}} In the second half of the 20th century much progress was made in increasing the accuracy of measurements of the speed of light, first by cavity resonance techniques and later by laser interferometer techniques. In 1972, using the latter method, a group at [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NBS]] in [[Boulder, Colorado]] determined the speed of light in vacuum to be ''c'' = {{val|299792456.2|1.1|u=m/s}}. This was 100 times less [[Measurement uncertainty|uncertain]] than the previously accepted value. The remaining uncertainty was mainly related to the definition of the metre.{{#tag:ref|Since 1960 the metre was defined as: "The metre is the length equal to {{val|1650763.73}} wavelengths in vacuum of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the levels 2p<sub>10</sub> and 5d<sub><sub>5</sub></sub> of the krypton 86 atom."<ref name="11thCGPM"> {{cite web |year=1967 |title=Resolution 6 of the 15th CGPM |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/11/6/ |publisher=[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures|BIPM]] |accessdate=2010-10-13 }}</ref> It was later discovered that this spectral line was not symmetric, which put a limit on the precision with which the definition could be realized in interferometry experiments.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1063/1.1654608}} </ref>|group="Note"}}<ref name="NIST heterodyne"/> Since similar experiments found comparable results for ''c'', the 15th [[Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures]] (CGPM) in 1975 recommended using the value {{val|299792458|u=m/s}} for the speed of light.<ref name="15thCGPM"> {{cite web |year=1975 |title=Resolution 2 of the 15th CGPM |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/15/2/ |publisher=BIPM |accessdate=2009-09-09 }}</ref> Because the previous definition was deemed inadequate for the needs of various experiments, the 17th CGPM in 1983 decided to redefine the metre.<ref name=Wilkie> {{cite journal |title=Time to remeasure the metre |author=Tom Wilkie |url=http://books.google.com/?id=pKU5MXqo4UYC&pg=PA258 |pages=258
