authoritarian interests. Others{{Who|date=October 2009}} argue that information itself is ethically neutral, and that it is the people acting upon the information that can be good or evil. Perceptions of good and evil can also change (see [[moral panic]]); for example, if anonymous peer-to-peer networks had existed in the 1950s or 1960s, they might have been targeted for carrying information about [[civil rights]] or [[anarchism]]. Easily accessible anonymous P2P networks are seen by some as a democratization of [[encryption]] technology, giving the general populace access to secure communications channels already used by governments. Supporters of this view, such as [[Phil Zimmermann]], argue that anti-surveillance technologies help to equalize power between governments and their people,<ref name="Zimmermann_interview">Russell D. Hoffmann (1996). [http://www.animatedsoftware.com/hightech/philspgp.htm Interview with author of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)].

If anonymity is not possible, one could be subjected to threats or reprisals for voicing an unpopular view. This is one reason why voting is done by secret ballot in many democracies. Controversial information which a party wants to keep hidden, such as details about corruption issues, is often published or leaked anonymously. ====Anonymous blogging==== Anonymous blogging is one widespread use of anonymous networks. While anonymous blogging is possible on the non-anonymous internet to some degree too, a provider hosting the blog in question might be forced to disclose the blogger's IP address (as in the case of Google revealing an anonymous blogger's identity<ref>Declan McCullagh (2007). [http://www.news.com/8301-13578_3-9824638-38.html Google: We had no choice in Israel ID request]. CNET News.com article, retrieved 2008-02-11.</ref>). Anonymous networks provide a better degree of anonymity. Flogs in [[Freenet]], [[Syndie]] in [[I2P]] and [[Osiris (Serverless Portal System)|Osiris sps]] are some examples of anonymous blogging technologies. One argument for anonymous blogging is a delicate nature of work situation. Sometimes a blogger writing under his/her real name faces a choice between either staying silent or causing a harm to himself, his colleagues or the company he works for.<ref>Bill Vallicella (2004).

Retrieved 2008-02-11.</ref> anonymous blogging provides protection against such risks. ====Censorship via Internet domain names==== {{Unclear section|date=April 2009}} On the non-anonymous internet, a domain name like "mysite.com" is a key to accessing information. The censorship of the Wikileaks website<ref>[http://www.wikileaks.org/wiki/WIKILEAKS.INFO_censored_by_eNom_and_Demand_Media WIKILEAKS.INFO censored by eNom and Demand Media]. Retrieved 2008-03-09.</ref> shows that domain names are extremely vulnerable to censorship. Some domain registrars have suspended customers' domain names even in the absence of a court order. For the affected customer, blocking of a domain name is a far bigger problem than a registrar refusing to provide a service; typically, the registrar keeps full control over the domain names in question. In the case of a European travel agency, more than 80 .com web sites were shut down without any court process and held by the registrar since then. The travel agency had to rebuild the sites under the .net [[top-level domain]] instead.<ref>Adam Liptak (2008). [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/04/us/04bar.html A Wave of the Watch List, and Speech Disappears]. The New York Times, 2008-03-04. Retrieved 2008-03-09.</ref> Anonymous networks, on the other hand, do not rely on domain name registrars. For example, [[Freenet]] implements censorship-resistant URLs based on [[public-key cryptography]]: only a person having the correct private key is able to update the URL or take it down. ===Control over online tracking=== Anonymous P2P also has value in normal daily communication. When communication is anonymous, the decision to reveal the identities of the communicating parties is left up to the parties involved and is not available to a third party. Often there is no need or desire by the communicating parties to reveal their identities. As a matter of personal freedom, many people do not want processes in place by default which supply unnecessary data. In some cases such data could be compiled into histories of their activities. For example, most current phone systems transmit caller ID information by default to the called party (although this can be disabled either for a single call or for all calls). If a person calls to make an inquiry about a product or the time of a movie, the party called has a record of the calling phone number, and may be able to obtain the name, address and other information about the caller. This information is not available about someone who walks into a store and makes a similar inquiry. ===Effects of surveillance on lawful activity=== Online surveillance, such as recording and retaining details of web and e-mail traffic, may have effects on lawful activities.<ref name="chilling">Dawinder S.

University of Maryland Law Journal of Race, Religion, Gender and Class.</ref> People may be deterred from accessing or communicating legal information because they know of possible surveillance and believe that such communication may be seen as suspicious. According to law professor [[Daniel J. Solove]], such effects "harm society because, among other things, they reduce the range of viewpoints being expressed and the degree of freedom with which to engage in political activity." <ref name="solove1">Daniel J.
