up to dissect systems that have grown haphazardly to determine the current components of the system. This was shown during the year 2000 re-engineering effort as business and manufacturing processes were examined as part of the [[Y2K]] automation upgrades. Employment utilizing systems analysis include [[systems analyst]], [[business analyst]], [[Industrial engineering|manufacturing engineer]], [[enterprise architect]], etc. While practitioners of systems analysis can be called upon to create new systems they often modify, expand or document existing systems ([[Process (engineering)|processes]], [[procedure]]s and [[Methodology|methods]]). A set of components interact with each other to accomplish some specific purpose. Systems are all around us. Our body is itself a system. A business is also a system. Men, money, machine, market and material are the components of business system that work together that achieve the common goal of the organization. ==See also== {{Multicol}} ;Types of Systems analysis *[[Accident Analysis]] *[[Business analysis]] *[[Logico-linguistic modeling]] *[[Morphological analysis]] *[[Soft systems methodology]] *[[Software prototyping]] *[[Spiral model]] *[[Waterfall model]] {{multicol-break}} ;Related topics *[[System architecture]] *[[Software architecture]] *[[Enterprise architecture]] *[[Systems analyst]] *[[Systems design]] *[[Policy analysis]] *[[Program designer]] *[[Cybernetics]] {{Multicol-break}} ;Systems thinkers *[[Gregory Bateson]] *[[Stewart Brand]] *[[Buckminster Fuller]] *[[Robert S.

They will be familiar with multiple approaches to problem-solving. Analysts are often familiar with a variety of programming languages, operating systems, and computer hardware platforms.

A systems analyst may: * Plan a system flow from the ground up. * Interact with customers to learn and document requirements that are then used to produce business requirements documents. * Write technical requirements from the business requirements document; this is a critical phase. * Interact with designers to understand software limitations. * Help programmers during system development, ex: provide [[use cases]], [[flowcharts]] or even [[Database design]]. * Perform system testing. * Deploy the completed system. * Document requirements or contribute to user manuals. * Whenever a development process is conducted, the system analyst is responsible for designing components and providing that information to the developer. ==See also:== *[[Change management analyst]] *[[Business analyst]] *[[Systems analysis]] == References == {{reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos287.htm "Computer Systems Analysts" from the US Department of Labor BLS Occupational Outlook Handbook] [[Category:Systems analysis]] [[Category:Business and financial operations occupations]] [[Category:Computer occupations]] [[es:Analista de sistemas]] [[id:Analis sistem]] [[ru:Системный аналитик]] [[zh:系统分析员]]</text> </page> <page> <id>36558</id> <title>Systems art</title> <text>'''Systems art''' is [[art]] influenced by [[cybernetics]], and [[systems theory]], which reflects on natural systems, social systems and social signs of the [[art world]] itself.<ref> [http://www.aat-ned.nl/wwwopac.exe?database=aat&language=1&TAB=&%250=2583 Systems art], Dutch Art & Architecture Thesaurus, retrieved March 2008.</ref> Systems art emerged as part of the first wave of the [[conceptual art]] movement extended in the 1960s and 1970s. Closely related and overlapping terms are ''Anti-form movement'', ''Cybernetic art'', ''Generative Systems'', ''Process art'', ''Systems aesthetic'', ''Systemic art'', ''Systemic painting'' and ''Systems sculptures''. == Related fields of systems art == === Anti-form movement === [[Image:Frank Stella, 1964, photo by Ugo Mulas.jpg|thumb|right|1964 photo of [[Frank Stella]] by [[Ugo Mulas]].]] By the early 1960s Minimalism emerged as an abstract movement in art (with roots in [[geometric abstraction]] via [[Malevich]], [[the Bauhaus]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]) which rejected the idea of relational, and subjective painting, the complexity of [[Abstract expressionist]] surfaces, and the emotional [[zeitgeist]] and polemics present in the arena of [[Action painting]]. Minimalism argued that extreme simplicity could capture all of the sublime representation needed in art. Associated with painters such as [[Frank Stella]], minimalism in painting, as opposed to other areas, is a modernist movement. Depending on the context, minimalism might be construed as a precursor to the postmodern movement. Seen from the perspective of writers who sometimes classify it as a postmodern movement, early minimalism began and succeeded as a modernist movement to yield advanced works, but which partially abandoned this project when a few artists changed direction in favor of the anti-form movement. In the late 1960s the term [[Postminimalism]] was coined by Robert Pincus-Witten<ref>''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&M", by Sarah Douglas, [[Art & Auction|Art+Auction]], March 2007, V.XXXNo7.</ref> to describe minimalist derived art which had content and contextual overtones which minimalism rejected, and was applied to the work of [[Eva Hesse]], [[Keith Sonnier]], [[Richard Serra]] and new work by former minimalists [[Robert Smithson]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Sol LeWitt]], and Barry Le Va, and others. Minimalists like [[Donald Judd]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[John McCracken]] and others continued to produce their late modernist paintings and sculpture for the remainder of their careers. === Cybernetic art === Audio feedback and the use of tape loops, sound synthesis and computer generated compositions reflected a cybernetic awareness of information, systems and cycles. Such techniques became widespread in the 1960s in the music industry. The visual effects of electronic feedback became a focus of artistic research in the late 1960s, when video equipment first reached the consumer market. [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]], for
