connector|PS/2]], etc.), rectangular ([[FireWire]], etc.), square ([[Telephone plug]]), trapezoidal ([[D-subminiature|D-Sub]] — the old printer port was a [[DB-25]]), etc. There is some standardization to physical properties and function. For instance, most computers have a [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] port (currently a round [[DIN connector|DIN]]-like outlet referred to as PS/2), into which the keyboard is connected. == Electrical signal transfer == Electronically, hardware ports can almost always be divided into two groups based on the signal transfer: * [[Serial port]]s send and receive one bit at a time via a single wire pair (Ground and +/-). * [[Parallel port]]s send multiple bits at the same time over several sets of wires. After ports are connected, they typically require [[handshaking]], where transfer type, transfer rate, and other necessary information is shared before data are sent. Hot-swappable ports can be connected while equipment is running. About the only port on personal computers that is not hot-swappable is the keyboard PS/2 connector. Hot-swapping a keyboard on many computer models can cause permanent damage to the [[motherboard]].{{Fact|date=April 2008}} [[Plug-and-play]] ports are designed so that the connected devices automatically start handshaking as soon as the hot-swapping is done. [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] ports and FireWire ports are plug-and-play. Auto-detect or auto-detection ports are usually plug-and-play, but they offer another type of convenience. An auto-detect port may automatically determine what kind of device has been attached, but it also determines what purpose the port itself should have. For example, some [[sound card]]s allow plugging in several different types of [[Computer speaker|audio speakers]]; then a dialogue box pops up on the computer screen asking whether the speaker is left, right, front, or rear for [[surround sound]] installations. The user's response determines the purpose of the port, which is physically a 1/8" tip-ring-sleeve ([[TRS connector]]) minijack. Some auto-detect ports can even switch between input and output based on context. As of 2006, manufacturers have nearly standardized colors associated with ports on personal computers, although there are no guarantees. The following is a short list: {{main|PC System Design Guide}} *Orange, purple, or grey: Keyboard PS/2 *Green: Mouse PS/2 *Blue or magenta: Parallel printer DB-25 *Amber: Serial DB-25 or DB-9 *Pastel pink: Microphone 1/8" stereo (TRS) minijack *Pastel green: Speaker 1/8" stereo (TRS) minijack [[FireWire]] ports used with video equipment (among other devices) can be either 4-pin or 6-pin. The two extra conductors in the 6-pin connection carry electrical power. This is why a self-powered device such as a camcorder often connects with a cable that is 4-pins on the camera side and 6-pins on the computer side, the two power conductors simply being ignored. This is also why laptop computers usually have only 4-pin FireWire ports, as they cannot provide enough power to meet requirements for devices needing the power provided by 6-pin connections. Optical (light) fiber, microwave, and other technologies (i.e., quantum) have different kinds of connections, as metal wires are not effective for signal transfers with these technologies. Optical connections are usually a polished glass or plastic interface, possibly with an oil that lessens refraction between the two interface surfaces. Microwaves are conducted through a pipe, which can be seen on a large scale by examining [[microwave radio relay| microwave towers]] with "funnels" on them leading to pipes. [[Hardware port trunking]] (HPT) is a technology that allows multiple hardware ports to be combined into a single group, effectively creating a single connection with a higher [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]], sometimes referred to as a double-barrel approach. This technology also provides a higher degree of [[fault tolerant|fault tolerance]] because a failure on one port may just mean a slow-down rather than a dropout. By contrast, in [[Software Port Trunking]] (SPT), two agents (websites, channels, etc.) are bonded into one with the same effectiveness; i.e., [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]] B1 (64K) plus B2 (64K) equals data throughput of 128K. == Example ports == {| |- | <!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:USB Icon.svg|60px|thumb|[[Universal Serial Bus|USB]]]] --> [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] | [[Image:USB Connector.jpg|thumb]] | [[Image:USB TypeA Plug.JPG|thumb]] | [[Image:Types-usb.svg|thumb|[[Universal Serial Bus|USB]]]] |- | <!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Firewire Icon.svg|60px|thumb|[[Firewire]]]] --> [[FireWire]] | [[Image:FireWire gniazdo.jpg|thumb]] | [[Image:FireWire cables.jpg|thumb]] | [[Image:FireWire-46 Diagram.svg|thumb|[[IEEE 1394 interface]]]] |- | [[Ethernet port]] | [[Image:Rj-45 on motherboard.jpg|thumb]] | [[Image:Ethernet RJ45 connector p1160054.jpg|thumb|[[Ethernet over twisted pair]] using [[category 5 cable]] ]] | [[Image:Rj45plug-8p8c.png|thumb|[[8P8C]] ]] |- | [[Serial port]] | [[Image:Serial port.jpg|thumb]] | [[Image:RS-232.jpeg|thumb]] | [[Image:DE9 Diagram.svg|thumb|[[RS-232]]]] |- | [[Parallel port]] | [[Image:Parallel computer printer port.jpg|thumb]] | [[Image:Centronics-36F.jpg|thumb]] | [[IEEE 1284]] |- | [[PS/2 connector]] | [[Image:Ps-2-ports.jpg|thumb]] | [[Image:PS2_connector-black_male-_tilted_close_up_PNr°0061.jpg|thumb]] | [[Image:MiniDIN-6 Connector Pinout.svg|thumb|[[Mini-DIN connector]]]] |- | [[Video Graphics Array]]<br> [[VGA connector]] | [[Image:VGA port.jpg|thumb]] | [[Image:Vga-cable.jpg|thumb]] | [[Image:DE15 Connector Pinout.svg|thumb|[[D-subminiature|D-sub 15]]]] |- | [[Digital Visual Interface]] | [[Image:DVI D.jpg|thumb]] | [[Image:Dvi-cable.jpg|thumb]] | [[Image:DVI Diagram.svg|thumb|DVI]] |- | [[TRS connector]] | | [[Image:Aud Jack.jpg|thumb]] |- | [[SCSI]] | [[Image:Scsi-1 gehaeuse.jpg|thumb]] | [[Image:SCSI 25-50.jpg|thumb]] | |- | [[DC connector]] |- | [[IEC connector]] | [[Image:IEC60320 C14.jpg|thumb]] | [[Image:IEC60320 C13.jpg|thumb]] | [[IEC 60320]] |} == See also == *[[Audio and video connector]] *[[Audio and video interfaces and connectors]] *[[Computer port (software)]] *[[Port expander]] {{Commonscat|Computer connectors}} == References == {{reflist}} == External links == * [http://www.tomshardware.com/2005/11/23/pc_interfaces_101/ Tom's Hardware PC Interfaces 101], a quick overview of commonly used ports for PCs. * [http://www.entechtaiwan.com/dev/hw32/index.shtm TVicHW32], Direct Port I/O from Win32. * [http://www.thaiio.com/ Interface Ports I/O form PC] [[Category:Computer peripherals|Port]] [[Category:Out-of-band management]] [[bg:Порт (компютри)]] [[ca:Port (informàtica)]] [[da:Hardwareport]] [[de:Port (Schnittstelle)]] [[es:Puerto (computación)]] [[eu:Ataka (informatika)]] [[fr:Port matériel]] [[it:Porta (informatica)]] [[nl:Poort (computer)]] [[ja:入出力ポート]] [[ko:컴퓨터 하드웨어 포트]] [[kk:Компьютер порты (жабдықтама)]] [[lv:Pieslēgvieta]] [[pl:Port (sprzęt komputerowy)]] [[ru:Порт (компьютеры)]] [[sl:Vrata (računalništvo)]] [[sv:Port (datorteknik)]] [[tr:Port (kapı)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>7570</id> <title>Computer program</title> <text>A '''computer program''' (also a '''[[computer software|software]] program''', or just a '''program''') is a sequence of [[instruction (computer science)|instructions]] written to perform a specified task for a [[computer]].<ref name="pis-ch4-p132">{{cite book | last = Stair | first = Ralph M., et al. | title = Principles of Information Systems, Sixth Edition | publisher = Thomson Learning, Inc. | year = 2003 | pages = 132 | isbn = 0-619-06489-7 }}</ref> A computer requires programs to function, typically [[execution
