the Knowledge Discovery Metamodel Request For Proposal (RFP). * In February 2005, the OMG's Architecture-Driven Modernization Task Force recommended, and the Platform Technical Committee issued, the Abstract Syntax Tree Metamodel (ASTM) Request For Proposal (RFP). This work is still in progress. OMG has not yet adopted this specification. * In May 2006, the Team's submission—the Knowledge Discovery Metamodel—was adopted by the OMG and moved into the finalization stage of the OMG's standards adoption process. The OMG adopted Specification for KDM became publicly available (OMG document ptc/06-06-07). * In September 2006, the OMG's Architecture-Driven Modernization Task Force recommended, and the Platform Technical Committee issued, the Software Metrics Metamodel (SMM) Request For Proposal (RFP). This work is still in progress. * In March 2007 the KDM Finalization Task Force finished the finalization stage of the OMG's standards adoption process. The recommended specification KDM 1.0 is available from OMG == Knowledge Discovery Metamodel (KDM) == The foundation of the Architecture-Driven Modernization initiative is the OMG specification [[Knowledge Discovery Metamodel]] (KDM). Usually the knowledge obtained from existing software is presented in the form of models to which specific queries can be made when necessary. An [[entity relationship]] is a frequent format of representing knowledge obtained from existing software. Knowledge Discovery Metamodel defines an ontology for the software assets and their relationships for the purpose of performing knowledge discovery of existing code. Company KDM Analytics is maintaining open Portal for the Knowledge Discovery Metamodel (see [http://www.kdmanalytics.com/kdm KDM Portal]). ==See also== * [[Object Management Group]] * [[software modernization]] * [[Reverse Engineering]] * [[software mining]] ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Software architecture]]</text> </page> <page> <id>2354</id> <title>Arena (web browser)</title> <text>{{Infobox web browser | name = Arena | logo = [[Image:ArenaLogo.gif]] | screenshot = [[Image:Arena (web browser) screenshot.png|180px]] | caption = Arena on http://www.gnu.org | author = [[Dave Raggett]] (1992-1994),<ref name="raggettprofile" /> [[Håkon Wium Lie]], [[Henrik Frystyk Nielsen]], [[Yves Lafon]] | developer = [[CERN]]/[[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]]<ref name="raggettprofile" /><br>Yggdrasil Computing | released = pre {{release date and age|1993}}<br>0.91 {{release date and age|1995|11|27}} | latest release version = 0.3.62<ref name="lippng" /><ref name="Ychangelog" /> | latest release date = {{release date and age|1998|11|25}} | operating system = [[NeXT]],<ref name="arena098" /> [[Linux]],<ref name="w3cfaq" /><ref name="hoary">{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Peter|title=Optimized for no one, but pretty much OK with . . .|url=http://hoary.org/browse/|accessdate=2 June 2010|publisher=hoary.org|date=7 September 2003}}</ref> [[Unix]]<ref name="hoary" /> ([[SunOS]],<ref name="w3cfaq" /> [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]],<ref name="w3cfaq" /> [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]],<ref name="w3cfaq" /> [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]],<ref name="status" /> [[FreeBSD]],<ref name="pressrelease" /> [[X Window System|X11]](X)<ref name="status"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/Clients.html|title=World Wide Web Client Software products|date=17 August 1995|first=Dan|last=Connolly|authorlink=Dan Connolly|publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]|accessdate=17 June 2010}}</ref> | platform = | language = English | programming language = [[C (programming language)|C]] | genre = [[web browser]], web [[authoring system|authoring tool]] | license = [[W3C Software Notice and License|W3C]],<ref name="status" /> some parts [[GNU General Public License|GPL]]<ref name="Ystart" /> | discontinued = yes | website = [http://web.archive.org/web/20030205061330/http://www.yggdrasil.com/Products/Arena/ yggdrasil.com/Products/Arena/]<br />[http://www.w3.org/Arena/ www.w3.org/Arena/]<br />[http://web.archive.org/web/20070721112811/ws.m2m-dc.ne.jp/~shin/Arena-CJK-doc/ OMRONs Arena port] }} The '''Arena''' browser (also known as the '''Arena WWW Browser''')<ref>{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.scientificlinux.org/linux/fermi/obsolete/502/i386.old/contrib/susedocs/pkg_English.ps|format=[[PostScript]]|title=Die Pakete|year=1998|publisher=[[Scientific Linux]]|accessdate=14 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://216.206.130.36/hilfe/pak_e/paket_arena.html|title=SuSE Linux 6.4 (i386) - March 2000 "arena"|accessdate=14 June 2010|publisher=[[SUSE Linux distributions]]|date=14 March 2000}}</ref> was an early [[testbed]] [[web browser]] and web [[authoring system|authoring tool]]<ref name="Ystart" /><ref name="cwi.nl" /> for [[Unix]].
