matrices representing [[image]]s, [[audio signal]]s, [[video]]s, or [[genetic sequence]]s. Although much smaller than the epitomized data, the epitome contains many of the smaller overlapping parts of the data with much less repetition and with some level of generalization. As such, it can be used for data mining and other machine learning and signal processing tasks. The first use of '''epitomic analysis''' was performed on image textures<ref>Nebojsa Jojic's image epitome website [http://www.research.microsoft.com/~jojic/epitome.html].</ref> and was used for image parsing. The epitome model has also been applied to videos.<ref>Vincent Cheung's video epitome website [http://www.psi.toronto.edu/~vincent/videoepitome.html].</ref> Filling in missing parts of a video, removing objects from a scene and performing video [[super-resolution]] are examples of tasks in which the video epitome has proven useful. Epitomes are also being investigated as tools for [[rational vaccine design]]. == References == <references /> == See also == * [[Epitome]] [[Category:Image processing]] [[Category:Statistical models]] {{Comp-sci-stub}} {{statistics-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>12356</id> <title>Epoch (reference date)</title> <text>: * ''For the subdivision of geologic time see [[epoch (geology)]]'' In the fields of [[chronology]] and [[periodization]], an '''epoch''' means an instant in time chosen as the origin of a particular [[era]]. The "epoch" then serves as a reference point from which time is measured. [[Time#Measurement|Time measurement units]] are counted from the epoch so that the date and time of events can be specified unambiguously. Events taking place before the epoch can be dated by counting negatively from the epoch, though in pragmatic [[periodization]] practice, epochs are defined for the past, and another epoch is used to start the next era, therefore serving as the ending of the older preceding era. The whole purpose and criteria of such definitions is to clarify and co-ordinate scholarship about a period, at times, across disciplines. Epochs are generally chosen to be convenient or significant by a consensus of the time scale's initial users, or by authoritarian fiat. The epoch moment or date is usually defined by ''a specific clear event'', condition, or criteria&mdash; the epoch event or epoch criteria &mdash;from which the period or era or age is usually characterized or described. '''Examples:''' :by events: ::The assassination of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Alexander Severus]] triggering the [[Crisis of the Third Century]] ::The [[Defenestrations of Prague|defenestration of Prague]] triggering the [[Thirty Years' War]] ::[[Queen Victoria]] ascending to the throne giving the start of the [[Victorian era]] :by criteria: ::The spurt in exploration, mercantilism, and colonization in the [[Age of Discovery]] ::Particular ratios of animal fossils in a rock strata &mdash;various Geology epochs == Calendars == Each [[calendar era]] starts from an arbitrary epoch, which is often chosen to commemorate an important historical or mythological event. For example, the epoch of the [[anno Domini]] calendar era (the civil calendar era used internationally and in many countries) is the traditionally-reckoned [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of [[Jesus]].<ref>Blackburn, B. & Holford-Strevens, L. (2003). ''The Oxford Companion to the Year: An exploration of calendar customs and time-reckoning''. Oxford University Press. Glossary entry for "Incarnation era", p. 881.</ref> [[Common_Era#Other calendric eras|Many other current and historical calendar eras]] exist, each with its own epoch. === Asian national eras === * The official [[Japanese era name|Japanese system]] numbers years from the accession of the current [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]], regarding the calendar year during which the accession occurred as the first year. * A similar [[Chinese era name|system]] existed in [[China]] before 1912, being based on the accession year of the emperor (1911 was thus the fourth year of the [[Xuantong]] period). With the establishment of the [[Republic of China]] in 1912, the republican era was introduced. It is still very common in [[Taiwan]] to date events via the republican era. The People's Republic of China adopted the common era calendar in 1949 (the 38th year of the Chinese Republic). * In [[India]], the [[Indian national calendar]] follows the [[Saka era]] * [[North Korea]] uses a system that starts in 1912 (= [[Juche]] 1), the year of the birth of their founder [[Kim Il-Sung]]. The year 2009 is "Juche 98". ''Juche'' means ''"[[autarky]], self-reliance"''. * In [[Thailand]] in 1888 King [[Chulalongkorn]] decreed a National Thai Era dating from the founding of [[Bangkok]] on April 6, 1782. In 1912, New Year's Day was shifted to April 1. In 1941, Prime Minister [[Plaek Pibulsonggram|Phibunsongkhram]] decided to count the years since 543 BC. This is the [[Thai solar calendar]] using the Thai Buddhist Era. Except for this era, it is the Gregorian calendar. === Religious eras === * In [[Israel]], the traditional [[Hebrew calendar]], using an era [[Anno mundi|dating from Creation]], is the official calendar. However, the Gregorian calendar is the ''de facto'' calendar and is commonly used. Government documents usually display a dual date. The beginning of year 1 of the Hebrew calendar occurred in the autumn of 3761 BC. Therefore, "Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, in September 2003 marked the transition from 5763 to 5764".<ref>[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/holidays/About_Jewish_Holidays/Solar_and_Lunar/CountingYears.htm My Jewish Learning:Counting the Years]</ref><ref>[http://www.rosettacalendar.com/calendars.html Rosetta Calendar]</ref> * In the [[Islam]]ic world, traditional [[Islamic calendar|Islamic dating]] according to the ''Anno Hegir√¶'' (in the year of the ''[[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]]'') or ''AH'' era remains in use to a varying extent, especially for religious purposes. The official [[Iranian calendar]] (used in [[Afghanistan]] as well as [[Iran]]) also dates from the ''hijra'', but as it is a [[solar calendar]] its year numbering does not coincide with the religious calendar. * In [[Hinduism]], all festival are according to the [[Hindu calendar]], based on the [[Vikrama Samvat|Vikram Samvat]], which also functions as the national calendar of [[Nepal]] and [[Bangladesh]]. ===Other=== *In the [[French Republican Calendar]], a calendar used by the French government for about twelve years from late 1793, the epoch was the beginning of the "Republican Era", September 22, 1792 (the day the [[French First Republic]] was proclaimed, one day after the Convention abolished the monarchy). *In the scientific [[Before Present]] system of numbering years for purposes of [[radiocarbon dating]], the reference date is January 1, 1950 (though the use of January 1 is quite irrelevant, as radiocarbon dating has limited precision).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c14dating.com/agecalc.html|title=Radiocarbon dating - Age calculation|last=Higham|first=Thomas|accessdate=31 December 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Stuiver|first=Minze|coauthors=Polach HA|year=1977|title=Discussion; reporting
