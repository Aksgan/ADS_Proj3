G. (1996). "Reasoning the fast and frugal way: Models of bounded rationality". Psychological Review, 103, 650-669.</ref>, when making a judgment based on multiple criteria, the criteria are tried one at a time according to their [[cue validity]], and a decision is made based on the first criterion which discriminates between the alternatives. [[Gerd Gigerenzer]] and [[Daniel Goldstein]] discovered that the heuristic did surprisingly well at making accurate [[inferences]] in real-world environments, such as inferring which of two cities is larger.

TCC is based on the earlier [[4DOS]] command shell for [[DOS]], and [[4OS/2]] for [[OS/2]]. Beginning with version 12 of 4NT, support for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT and 2000 were removed.<ref name="ossupport">[http://jpsoft.com/tcmddes.htm Supported Windows versions].</ref> 4NT was renamed to '''Take Command Console''' as part of JP Software's [[Take Command (command line interpreter)|Take Command]] version 9, a version of 4NT that has many more features and more extensive GUI integration. The current version of TCC, and therefore the underlying scripting language variant, is 11.0. TCC provides a rich set of both [[Command line interface|command line]] and [[Batch file|batch programming]] capabilities. Unlike NT-based command line interpreter, it does not directly accept [[Windows Script Host]] commands. It can work in conjunction with other [[scripting language]]s, such as [[REXX]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] and [[Perl]], or [[Windows Script Host|Windows Scripting languages]], in the form of [[Active Scripting]] engines such as [[VBScript]] and [[JScript]] as well as [[PerlScript]] (via ActivePerl), [[TclScript]] (via ActiveTcl), [[PythonScript]] (via [[ActivePython]]), and the scripting engine version of [[Object REXX]]
