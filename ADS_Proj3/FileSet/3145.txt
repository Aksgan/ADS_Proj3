(no support). * If the datum partially satisfies the argument, then the truth value of the data link is in the open interval (-1, 1). Note in particular that negative truth values greater than -1 do not connote negative truth. Rather, such values connote low membership, or low support. * If the data is not known, then the truth value of the data link is 0 (undetermined). Interpretation of truth values within networks must be treated more generally, because the truth value of a network may depend on several to many logic operators. Simple examples related to the two key logic operators, AND and OR, are: * If ‘’’all’’’ logical antecedents to an AND operator fully support the AND relation, then the truth value of the operator is 1 (full support). * If ‘’’any’’’ logical antecedent to an AND operator is fully contrary to the AND relation, then the truth value of the operator is -1 (no support). * If ‘’’any’’’ logical antecedent to an OR operator fully supports the OR relation, then the truth value is 1 (full support). * If there is no evidence for or against an AND or OR relation, then the truth value of either operator is 0 (undetermined). As with data links, networks may also evaluate to partially true. Two conditions give rise to this condition in NetWeaver: * One or more data items are missing and cannot be supplied, and therefore contribute a value of 0 to an AND. * One or more data items that influence the truth value of a dependency network have been evaluated against a fuzzy argument and found not to have full membership in the fuzzy set defined by the fuzzy argument (the data provides only partial support for the proposition). == Notes == {{Reflist}} == References == Barr, N.B., R.S.

Put more concretely, Netfilter is invoked, for example, by the packet reception and send routines from/to [[Network interface controller|network interfaces]]. As the master Netfilter function is called with a packet, Netfilter runs through the list of registered hooks and calls the extensions in succession, which then handle packets as they desire. The term '''Netfilter''' is also used to refer to the [[free software|Free Software]] project<ref>http://www.netfilter.org</ref> that aims to provide firewalling tools for [[GNU/Linux]]. [[Image:Netfilter-components.svg|300px|thumb|Relation of (some of) the different Netfilter components]] == History == The ''netfilter/iptables project'' was started in 1998 by [[Rusty Russell]], also author of the project's predecessor, [[ipchains]]. As the project grew, he founded the ''Netfilter Core Team'' (or simply ''coreteam'') in 1999. The software they produce (called ''netfilter'' hereafter) is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL), and was merged into Linux 2.3 in March 2000. In August 2003, [[Harald Welte]] was made chairman of the coreteam, and in April 2004, following a crack-down by the project on those distributing the project's software [[embedded system|embedded]] in [[router]]s without complying with the GPL, Welte was granted an historic [[injunction]] by a [[Germany|German]] court against Sitecom Germany, who refused to follow the GPL's terms (see [[GNU General Public License#The GPL in court|GPL-related disputes]]). In September 2007, Patrick McHardy, who led development for past years, was elected the new chairman of the coreteam. Prior to iptables, the predominant software packages for creating Linux firewalls were [[ipchains]] in Linux 2.2 and [[ipfwadm]] in Linux 2.0, which in turn was based on [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]]'s [[ipfirewall|ipfw]]. Both ipchains and ipfwadm alter the networking code so they could manipulate packets, as there was no general packet-control framework until Netfilter. Whereas ipchains and ipfwadm combine packet filtering and NAT (particularly three specific kinds of [[Network address translation|NAT]], called ''masquerading'', ''port forwarding'' and ''redirection''), Netfilter separates packet operations into multiple parts, described below. Each connects to the Netfilter hooks at different points to access packets. The connection tracking and NAT subsystems are more general and more powerful
