Submarine Platforms=== Australia's Collins class has a SIGINT mission, emphasized when the vessels' combat system was replaced with an open-architecture surveillance system. Among the systems are the ArgoSystems/Condor AR-740.<ref name=Friedman2003 /> ===Canada: Submarine Platforms=== Canada's acquisition of reconditioned British diesel-electric submarines (ex-Upholder class, now [[Upholder/Victoria class submarine|Victoria-class submarine]]) raised eyebrows of many analysts, wondering how these could have a strategic effect given the strength of Canada's southern neighbour's undersea strength. Writing in the ''[[Canadian Military Journal]]'', an officer of Canada's maritime forces gave some subtle insights, of which submarine intelligence capabilities play a significant role <ref name=Craven2006>{{citation | last = Craven | first = Michael | title = A Rational Choice Revisited -- Submarine Capability in a Transformational Era | journal = Canadian Military Journal | date = Winter 2006-2007 | url = http://www.journal.forces.gc.ca/engraph/Vol7/no4/PDF/05-craven_e.pdf |format=PDF| pages = 21–32 | accessdate = }}</ref>. "However, submarines also have a contribution to make in deterring and countering the asymmetric threats that now preoccupy Canadian/US (CANUS) planners. This is centered upon Intelligence-gathering, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) activities...possession of submarines admits Canada to that exclusive group of states participating in regulated and highly classified submarine waterspace management and intelligence-sharing schemes. The intention to re-establish a Pacific submarine presence led to the immediate cooperation of the United States in development of a west coast [[Waterspace Management Agreement]] with Canada, whereas none existed previously. Likewise, Arctic transits and deployments by allied submarines are generally first signalled when Canada's [[Atlantic Submarine Operating Authority]] is advised of foreign submarine movement across [[70th parallel north|70 degrees North]] latitude. Taken together, these various factors result in a capability of strategic importance in so much as it exponentially expands the range of coercive options available to decision-makers." As part of the upgrade of the Upholder-class submarine purchased from the UK, the [[Litton Marine Guardian Star]] is on the Victoria-class submarines.<ref name=Friedman2003 /> ===Chile: Submarine Platforms=== An ARGOsystems/Condor AR-900 is aboard the French-built Chilean Scorpene-class submarines.<ref name=Friedman2003 /> ===China: Submarine Platforms=== Israeli Elbit provides the TIMNEX 4 CH ELINT/targeting set, which covers 2–18 GHz, provides radar warning, and 1.4 to 5 degree DF (depending on frequency).<ref name=Friedman2003 /><ref name=Fisher2005>{{citation | last = Fisher | first = Richard Jr. | title = Growing Asymmetries in the China-Japan Naval Balance | publisher = International Strategy & Assessment Center |date=November 22, 2005 | url = http://www.strategycenter.net/research/pubID.83/pub_detail.asp | accessdate = 2007-10-08}}</ref>. ===Denmark: Submarine Platforms=== Danish subs have the UK Racal/[[Thales]] Sea Lion precision DF system.<ref name=Friedman2003 /> ===Egypt: Submarine Platforms=== Egyptian submarines use ArgoSystems/Condor AR-700 series SIGINT for targeting their Harpoon missiles.<ref name=Friedman2003 /> ===France: Submarine Platforms=== Older French export submarines came with the Thales/Thompson-CSF X-band radar warning system, which is a manual analog system. The digital replacement, in French service, is the ARUR-13. It is reasonable to expect continuing upgrades from the EADS consortium. ===Germany: Submarine Platforms=== German submarines use multiple SIGINT systems. Most basic is the DR3000U, although the [[Type 206 submarine]]s replaced it with the Ginny. The newer [[Type 212 submarine]]s use FL 1800U units made by the German-French EADS consortium. These units use four spiral antennas and a radar warning receiver under a common dome, with the ELINT function covering 0.5–18 GHz in five bands. This can achieve 5-degree direction finding. EADS (formerly DASA) also equips German submarines with the Telegon 12 HF interception and DF suite. ===Greece: Submarine Platforms=== Greece uses the ArgoSystems/Condor AR-700 series of submarine [[ELINT]]/[[Electronic warfare support measures|ESM]] for targeting [[Harpoon missiles]].<ref name=Friedman2003 /> ===Italy: Submarine Platforms=== Older submarines use an Elettronica BLD-727 DF, but the newer Type 212s will use German SIGINT.<ref name=Friedman2003 /> ===Israel: Submarine Platforms=== German-built Dolphin submarines in Israeli service have several missions, SIGINT being one of them. Domestic Elbit makes the TIMNEX 4 CH ELINT/targeting set, which covers 2–18 GHz, provides radar warning, and 1.4 to 5 degree DF (depending on frequency). ===Netherlands: Submarine Platforms=== For Harpoon targeting, the Netherlands uses the ArgoSystems/Condor AR-700 series SIGINT.<ref name=Friedman2003 /> ===Russia: Submarine Platforms=== Akula and Oscar attack submarine have Rim Hat (NATO designation) Nakat-M SIGINT, which is integrated with a Snoop Pair search radar.<ref name=Friedman2003 /> Kilo export diesel-electric submarines have the NATO Squid Head/MRM-25 ESM, which includes IFF. ===South Africa: Submarine Platforms === The domestic Avitronics firm installs the Shrike ESM system, covering 2–18 GHz, as does the Israeli Elbit TIMNEX 4 CH ELINT/targeting set, which provides radar warning, and 1.4 to 5 degree DF (depending on frequency).<ref name=Friedman2003 /> The CelsiusTech-Grintek Ewation partnership probably will provide systems as well. ===South Korea: Submarine Platforms=== These have GTE/Israeli SIGINT.<ref name=Friedman2003 /> ===Spain: Submarine Platforms=== Spanish boats have the domestically produced Indra BLQ-355, which may have been exported.<ref name=Friedman2003 /> With its participation in the EADS consortium, Spain obtains access to new technologies. Spain appears to be developing a coordinated SIGINT approach using submarine, ship, and aircraft platforms. ===Sweden: Submarine Platforms=== Sweden uses the ArgoSystems/Condor AR-700 series SIGINT.<ref name=Friedman2003 /> ===Taiwan: Submarine Platforms=== Israeli Elbit provides the TIMNEX 4 CH ELINT/targeting set, which covers 2–18 GHz, provides radar warning, and 1.4 to 5 degree DF (depending on frequency).<ref name=Friedman2003 /> ===United Kingdom: Submarine Platforms=== EADS (formerly DASA) also equips British submarines with the CXA(2) HF interception and DF suite.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Several submarines have a COMINT system made by US Southwest Research, under the US code name CLUSTER SENTINEL.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Author Sherry Sontag asserted in [[Blind Man's Bluff: The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage]] that British submarines have been involved in collaborative SigInt collection since the 1950s.<ref name="blindmansbluff">Sontag, S.; Drew, C.; Drew, A.

They also had a MASINT mission against Soviet submarines and missiles.
