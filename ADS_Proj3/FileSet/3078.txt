NRCFOSS developed [[Bharat Operating System Solutions]] a GNU/Linux distribution made specifically for the Indian environment. The latest version of this Free/Open Source Software, BOSS GNU/Linux v3.0, was released in September 2008. This software supports eighteen Indian languages out of a total of twenty-two [[Languages of India|constitutionally recognized languages]] in India at the desktop level. ==References== {{reflist}} ==Official websites== * [http://www.annauniv.edu/index.php Anna University, Chennai] * [http://www.nrcfoss.org.in NRCFOSS ] * [http://www.cdac.in/ Centre for Development in Advanced Computing] * [http://www.mit.gov.in/ Department of Information Technology, Government of India] * [http://foss.mnit.ac.in:8080/ FOSS Lab Server at Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology, Allahabad] * [http://bosslinux.in/ BOSS (Bharat Operating System Solutions) GNU/Linux distribution] {{DEFAULTSORT:Nrcfoss}} [[Category:Computer-related organizations]] [[Category:Free and open source software organizations]] [[Category:Non-profit organisations based in India]] [[Category:Organizations established in 2005]] [[Category:Information technology in India]]</text> </page> <page> <id>25686</id> <title>NSPACE</title> <text>{{Unreferenced stub|auto=yes|date=December 2009}} In [[computational complexity theory]], the [[complexity class]] '''NSPACE(''f''(''n''))''' is the set of [[decision problem]]s that can be solved by a [[non-deterministic Turing machine]] using space ''O''(''f''(''n'')), and unlimited time. It is the non-deterministic counterpart of [[DSPACE]]. Several important complexity classes can be defined in terms of '''NSPACE'''. These include: * '''[[regular language|REG]]''' = '''DSPACE'''(''O''(1)) = '''NSPACE'''(''O''(1)), where '''REG''' is the class of [[regular language]]s (nondeterminism does not add power in constant space). * '''[[NL (complexity)|NL]]''' = '''NSPACE'''(''O''(log ''n'')) * '''[[context-sensitive language|CSL]]''' = '''NSPACE'''(''O''(''n'')), where '''CSL''' is the class of [[context-sensitive language]]s. * '''[[PSPACE]]''' = '''NPSPACE''' = <math>\bigcup_{k\in\mathbb{N}} \mbox{NSPACE}(n^k)</math> * '''[[EXPSPACE]]''' = '''NEXPSPACE''' = <math>\bigcup_{k\in\mathbb{N}} \mbox{NSPACE}(2^{n^k})</math> The last two results above follow from [[Savitch's theorem]], which states that for any function ''f''(''n'') ≥ log(''n''), :'''NSPACE'''(''f''(''n'')) ⊆ '''DSPACE'''(''f''<sup>2</sup>(''n'')). The [[Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem]] states that '''NSPACE'''(''s''(''n'')) is closed under complement for every sunction {{nowrap|''s''(''n'') ≥ log ''n''.}} '''NSPACE''' can be related to [[DTIME]] as follows. For any [[space constructible]] function ''s''(''n''), :<math>\mbox{NSPACE}(s(n)) \subseteq \bigcup_{k \geq 1} \mbox{DTIME}(2^{k \cdot s(n)})</math> ==References== {{ComplexityZoo|NSPACE(''f''(''n''))|N#nspace}}. {{ComplexityClasses}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Nspace}} [[Category:Complexity classes]] [[Category:Computational resources]] {{Comp-sci-theory-stub}} [[de:NSPACE]] [[es:NSPACE]] [[ja:NSPACE]]</text> </page> <page> <id>25687</id> <title>NSW Photo Card</title> <text>[[Image:NSW Photo Card.jpg|right|thumb|NSW Photo Card, front (top) back (bottom). Holographic, plastic coated card.]]The '''NSW Photo Card''' is a voluntary card provided by the [[Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales]] [[Australia]], for people who do not hold a current NSW [[driver licence]] or learner licence (16 year olds), or other form of photo identification, to help them show who they are. It is credit-card sized and bears the cardholder’s photo, signature, name, address, date of birth, gender and organ donor status. NSW residents over 16 years who do not hold a current NSW driver licence can apply for the card. The card currently cost $44<ref>[http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/licensing/licensingfees.html NSW Licensing Fees]</ref> ([[AUD]]) from any of the 129 Motor Registries Offices across NSW. The NSW Photo Card replaced the RTAs 'proof of age' card in 14 December 2005. Until that time there was no ID card for over 25s. RTAs 'proof of age' card could only be issued to adults between 18 and 25 years of age meaning that any one over 25 could not obtain ID from the RTA unless they sat and qualified for some form of Drivers licence. The NSW Photo Card can also be obtained even if the individual had an RTA business restriction in place. The NSW Photo Card is just a photo id card to provide name, address and age for identification reasons and should not be confused with an [[Australian national identity card]] program, which has been proposed, but still does not exist. ==Notes== {{reflist|2}} ==External links== *[http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/licensing/photocard.html Official Site: RTA Photo Card] [[Category:Personal identification]]</text> </page> <page> <id>25689</id> <title>NScripter</title> <text>'''NScripter''' is a [[game engine|software engine]] that is used for the creation of [[visual novel]]s, written by Naoki Takahashi.
