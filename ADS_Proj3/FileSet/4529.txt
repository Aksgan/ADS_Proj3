Typically, a [[wire]] or [[cord]] is attached to some device for detecting or reacting to physical movement. From this basic meaning, several extended and metaphorical uses of the term have developed. For example, the [[Berlin Brigade]] stationed in the divided city of [[Berlin]] during the [[Cold War]] was given the mission to be the "tripwire" for a [[Soviet]] incursion into [[West Germany]].<ref>[http://groups.msn.com/berlintankers/general.msnw?action=get_message&mview=1&ID_Message=162 "...but what a tripwire we were!!!"] posted on the [http://groups.msn.com/berlintankers/ Berlin Tankers] web group 21 August 2005, retrieved June 16, 2008: <blockquote>To conclude, I will again agree that we were a '''trip wire''' for World War III, but what a great tripwire we were. If an invasion had ever occurred we would have innevitably lost, but the price that the enemy wold have paid to take Berlin would have crippled them.</blockquote> </ref> Military usage may designate a ''tripwire'' as a wire attached to one or more [[Land mine|mines]] — normally [[bounding mine]]s and the fragmentation type — in order to increase their activation area. Alternatively, tripwires are frequently used in [[boobytrap]]s, whereby a tug on the wire (or release of tension on it) will [[detonate]] the [[explosives]]. Soldiers sometimes detect the presence of tripwires by spraying the area with [[Silly String]]. If the string falls to the ground there are no tripwires. If there is a tripwire, the string will be suspended in the air without pulling the wire. It is being used by U.S. troops in [[Iraq]] for this purpose.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1561143,00.html | title=Not So Silly String In Iraq | publisher=TIME.com | accessdate=2007-10-16 | date=2006-11-19 | first=Ellin | last=Martens}}</ref><ref name="CBS News October 16"> {{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/12/06/iraq/main2234543.shtml | title=A Serious Use For Silly String | publisher=CBS News | accessdate=2007-10-16 | date=2006-12-06}}</ref><ref name="The Raw Story October 16"> {{cite news | url=http://www.rawstory.com/news/2006/FOX_VIDEO_Silly_String_saving_lives_1204.html | title=FOX VIDEO: 'Silly String' is saving lives over in Iraq | publisher=The Raw Story | accessdate=2007-10-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071012184140/http://rawstory.com/news/2006/FOX_VIDEO_Silly_String_saving_lives_1204.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-12}}</ref> ==References== <references/> [[Category:Anti-personnel weapons]] [[Category:Warning systems]] [[Category:Security]] {{weapon-stub}} [[da:Snubletråd]]</text> </page> <page> <id>38284</id> <title>Triune Continuum Paradigm</title> <text>'''Triune Continuum Paradigm''' is a [[paradigm]] for [[Systemics|general system modeling]] published in 2002.<ref name="AN02">A.

Khosrowpour (Ed.), Information Science Reference, IGI Global, September 2008. ISBN 978-1-60566-026-4.</ref> The paradigm defines a set of scientific foundations (principles) within which [[Conceptual framework|conceptual frameworks]] used for system modeling in different contexts can be built, tested, evaluated and if necessary revised. Thus, for an existent modeling framework, the paradigm allows to test the framework against its principles and to show the framework's deficiencies (if any), explaining how to fix the deficiencies in a possible revision of the framework. And if the goal is to build a new system modeling framework, then the paradigm provides its guidelines on how to do it assuring the resulting quality of the framework.

ISBN 972-752-077-4.</ref> The three theories were applied for the case of general system modeling, which produced the corresponding three principles that compose the paradigm:<ref name="AN08"></ref> * The first principle assures ''coherency'' and ''unambiguity'' within modeling interpretations of a single modeling framework. * The second principle assures ''internal consistency'' of descriptions and specifications that are constructed with the aid of a modeling framework. * The third principle allows to introduce and to justify the minimal set of modeling concepts that is ''necessary'' and ''sufficient'' to cover the representation scope of a modeling framework on the most abstract level (on the level that corresponds to the first order propositions in Russell's Theory of Types). == Applications of the paradigm == The Triune Continuum Paradigm can be applied in practice either to improve an existing system modeling framework or to design a new system modeling framework for a given purpose. The paradigm was applied in the domain of [[Software engineering|software]] and [[systems engineering]], in particular, to formalize foundations of [[RM-ODP]]
