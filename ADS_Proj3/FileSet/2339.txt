Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] ID badge photo.]] Beginning in the late 1930s, von Neumann began to take more of an interest in applied (as opposed to pure) mathematics. In particular, he developed an expertise in [[explosion]]s—phenomena which are difficult to model mathematically. This led him to a large number of military consultancies, primarily for the Navy, which in turn led to his involvement in the [[Manhattan Project]]. The involvement included frequent trips by train to the project's secret research facilities in [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos, New Mexico]].<ref name="NYT"/> Von Neumann's principal contribution to the atomic bomb itself was in the concept and design of the [[nuclear weapon design|explosive lenses]] needed to compress the [[plutonium]] core of the [[Trinity test]] device and the "[[Fat Man]]" weapon that was later dropped on [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. While von Neumann did not originate the "[[implosion-type nuclear weapon|implosion]]" concept, he was one of its most persistent proponents, encouraging its continued development against the instincts of many of his colleagues, who felt such a design to be unworkable. The lens shape design work was completed by July 1944. In a visit to Los Alamos in September 1944, von Neumann showed that the pressure increase from explosion shock wave reflection from solid objects was greater than previously believed if the angle of incidence of the shock wave was between 90° and some limiting angle. As a result, it was determined that the effectiveness of an atomic bomb would be enhanced with detonation some kilometers above the target, rather than at ground level.<ref name="Critical Assembly">{{ cite book | title=Critical Assembly: A Technical History of Los Alamos during the Oppenheimer Years, 1943–1945 | coauthors="Lillian Hoddeson, Paul W.

Von Neumann oversaw computations related to the expected size of the bomb blasts, estimated death tolls, and the distance above the ground at which the bombs should be detonated for optimum shock wave propagation and thus maximum effect.<ref name="Rhodes">{{cite book | last=Rhodes | first=Richard | title=The Making of the Atomic Bomb | year=1986 | location=New York | publisher=Touchstone Simon & Schuster | isbn=0-684-81378-5 }}</ref> The cultural capital [[Kyoto]], which had been spared the firebombing inflicted upon militarily significant target cities like Tokyo in World War II, was von Neumann's first choice, a selection seconded by Manhattan Project leader General [[Leslie Groves]]. However, this target was dismissed by [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry Stimson]].<ref name="Groves">{{cite book | last=Groves | first=Leslie | title=Now It Can Be Told: The Story of the Manhattan Project | year=1962 | location=New York | publisher=Da Capo | isbn=0-306-80189-2 }}</ref> On July 16, 1945, with numerous other Los Alamos personnel, von Neumann was an eyewitness to the [[Trinity test|first atomic bomb blast]], conducted as a test of the implosion method device, 35 miles (56 km) southeast of [[Socorro, New Mexico|Socorro]], [[New Mexico]]. Based on his observation alone, von Neumann estimated the test had resulted in a blast equivalent to 5 [[ton|kilotons]] of [[TNT equivalent|TNT]], but [[Enrico Fermi]] produced a more accurate estimate of 10 kilotons by dropping scraps of torn-up paper as the shock wave passed his location and watching how far they scattered. The actual power of the explosion had been between 20 and 22 kilotons.<ref name="Critical Assembly" /> After the war, [[Robert Oppenheimer]] remarked that the physicists involved in the Manhattan project had "known sin". Von Neumann's response was that "sometimes someone confesses a sin in order to take credit for it." Von Neumann continued unperturbed in his work and became, along with [[Edward Teller]], one of those who sustained the hydrogen bomb project. He then collaborated with [[Klaus Fuchs]] on further development of the bomb, and in 1946 the two filed a secret patent on "Improvement in Methods and Means for Utilizing Nuclear Energy", which outlined a scheme for using a fission bomb to compress fusion fuel to initiate a [[thermonuclear reaction]].<ref>Herken, pp. 171, 374</ref> The Fuchs-von Neumann patent used [[radiation implosion]], but not in the same way as is used in what became the final hydrogen bomb design, the [[Teller-Ulam design]]. Their work was, however, incorporated into the "George" shot of [[Operation Greenhouse]], which was instructive in testing out concepts that went into the final design. The Fuchs-von Neumann work was passed on, by Fuchs, to the USSR as part of his [[nuclear espionage]], but it was not used in the Soviet's own, independent development of the Teller-Ulam design. The historian Jeremy Bernstein has pointed out that ironically, "John von Neumann and Klaus Fuchs, produced a brilliant invention in 1946 that could have changed the whole course of the development of the hydrogen bomb, but was not fully understood until after the bomb had been successfully made."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bernstein|first1=Jeremy|title=John von Neumann and Klaus Fuchs: an Unlikely Collaboration|journal=Physics in Perspective|volume=12|pages=36|year=2010|doi=10.1007/s00016-009-0001-1}}</ref> ==Computer science== Von Neumann's hydrogen bomb work was also played out in the realm of computing, where he and [[Stanisław Ulam]] developed simulations on von Neumann's digital computers for the hydrodynamic computations. During this time he contributed to the development of the [[Monte Carlo method]], which allowed complicated problems to be approximated using [[random number]]s. Because using lists of "truly" random numbers was extremely slow, von Neumann developed a form of making [[pseudorandom number]]s, using the [[middle-square method]]. Though this method has been criticized as crude, von Neumann was aware of this: he justified it as being faster than any other method at his disposal, and also noted that when it went awry it did so obviously, unlike methods which could be subtly incorrect.
