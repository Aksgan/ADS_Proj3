to management of products under the Scrum process. Other organizations implement Scrum without the use of any software tools, and maintain their artifacts in hard-copy forms such as paper, whiteboards, and sticky notes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://targetprocess.com/download/whitepaper/agiletools.pdf|format=PDF|title=Agile Tools. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.|last=Dubakov|first=Michael|year=2008|accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref> == Roles == {{Main|The Chicken and the Pig}} A number of roles are defined in Scrum. All roles fall into two distinct groups&mdash;pigs and chickens&mdash;based on the nature of their involvement in the development process. These groups get their names from a joke <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.implementingscrum.com/2006/09/11/the-classic-story-of-the-pig-and-chicken/ |title=The Classic Story of the Pig and Chicken |publisher=Implementing Scrum |date=11 September 2006 |accessdate=2010-04-03}}</ref> about a pig and a chicken opening a restaurant:<ref name="schwaberp7">Schwaber, p. 7</ref> <blockquote> A pig and a chicken are walking down a road. The chicken looks at the pig and says, “Hey, why don’t we open a restaurant?” The pig looks back at the chicken and says, “Good idea, what do you want to call it?” The chicken thinks about it and says, “Why don’t we call it ‘Ham and Eggs’?” “I don’t think so,” says the pig, “I’d be committed, but you’d only be involved.” </blockquote> So the “pigs” are committed to building software regularly and frequently, while everyone else is a “chicken”&mdash;interested in the project but really indifferent because if it fails they’re not the pigs&mdash;that is, they weren’t the ones that committed to doing it. The needs, desires, ideas and influences of the chicken roles are taken into account, but are not in any way allowed to get in the way of the actual Scrum project. === “Pig” roles === The Pigs are the ones committed to the project in the Scrum process&mdash;they are the ones with “their bacon on the line” and performing the actual work of the project. ; ScrumMaster : Scrum is facilitated by a ScrumMaster, also written as ''Scrum Master'', whose primary job is to remove impediments to the ability of the team to deliver the sprint goal/deliverables. The ScrumMaster is not the leader of the team (as the team is self-organizing) but acts as a buffer between the team and any distracting influences. The ScrumMaster ensures that the Scrum process is used as intended. The ScrumMaster is the enforcer of rules. A key part of the ScrumMaster’s role is to protect the team and keep them focused on the tasks in hand. ; Team : The team has the responsibility to deliver the product. A team is typically made up of 5–9 people with cross-functional skills who do the actual work (design, develop, test, technical communication, etc.). ; Product Owner : The Product Owner represents the voice of the customer. He/she ensures that the Scrum Team works with the “right things” from a business perspective. The Product Owner writes customer-centric items (typically [[user story|user stories]]), prioritizes them and then places them in the [[#Product backlog|product backlog]]. A Product Owner can be a member of the Scrum Team but cannot be a ScrumMaster.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scrum.org/scrumguides/ |title=Scrum, Scrum Developer Courses, Scrum Knowledge Assessment, Scrum Guide, Ken Schwaber - Scrum Guides |publisher=Scrum.org |year=2009 |accessdate=2010-04-03}}</ref> : According to original Scrum, Product Owner is in a "pig" role. However, in the context of the Sprint and the daily Stand-Up meetings, the Product Owner is considered a "chicken" since he has no role in the implementation of Sprint tasks. === “Chicken” roles === Chicken roles are not part of the actual Scrum process, but must be taken into account. They are people for whom the software is being built. ; Stakeholders (customers, vendors) : These are the people who enable the project and for whom the project will produce the agreed-upon benefit[s], which justify its production. They are only directly involved in the process during the sprint reviews. ; Managers : People who will set up the environment for the product development organizations. == Meetings == ; Daily Scrum :Each day during the sprint, a project status meeting occurs. This is called a “daily scrum”, or “the daily standup”. This meeting has specific guidelines: :* The meeting starts precisely on time. :* All are welcome, but only “pigs” may speak :* The meeting is [[timeboxing|timebox]]ed to 15 minutes :* The meeting should happen at the same location and same time every day :During the meeting, each team member answers three questions:<ref name="schwaberp135">Schwaber, p. 135</ref> :* What have you done since yesterday? :* What are you planning to do today? :* Do you have any problems preventing you from accomplishing your goal? (It is the role of the ScrumMaster to facilitate resolution of these impediments. Typically this should occur outside the context of the Daily Scrum so that it may stay under 15 minutes.) ; Sprint Planning Meeting<ref name="schwaberp133">Schwaber, p. 133</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.sprintplanning.com/SprintPlanningRules.aspx|title=Sprint Planning Rules|last=Sprint|first=Planning|year=2009|month=January–February|accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref> :At the beginning of the sprint cycle (every 7–30 days), a “Sprint Planning Meeting” is held. :* Select what work is to be done :* Prepare the Sprint Backlog that details the time it will take to do that work, with the entire team :* Identify and communicate how much of the work is likely to be done during the current sprint :* Eight hour time limit :** (1st four hours) Product Owner + Team: dialog for prioritizing the Product Backlog :** (2nd four hours) Team only: hashing out a plan for the Sprint, resulting in the Sprint Backlog At the end of a sprint cycle, two meetings are held: the “Sprint Review Meeting” and the “Sprint [[Retrospective#Software development|Retrospective]]” ; Sprint Review Meeting<ref name="schwaberp137">Schwaber, p. 137</ref> :* Review the work that was completed and not completed :* Present the completed work to the stakeholders (a.k.a. “the demo”) :* Incomplete work cannot be demonstrated :* Four hour time limit ; Sprint Retrospective<ref name="schwaberp138">Schwaber, p. 138</ref> :* All team members reflect on the past sprint :* Make continuous process improvements :* Two main questions are asked in the sprint retrospective: What went well during the sprint?
