are tabulated in [[Pascal's triangle]]. ==Linear algebra== In [[linear algebra]], the '''leading coefficient''' of a row in a matrix is the first nonzero entry in that row. So, for example, given :<math> M = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 0 & 6 \\ 0 & 2 & 9 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}. </math> The leading coefficient of the first row is 1; 2 is the leading coefficient of the second row; 4 is the leading coefficient of the third row, and the last row does not have a leading coefficient. Though coefficients are frequently viewed as [[constant (mathematics)|constants]] in elementary algebra, they can be variables more generally. For example, the [[coordinates]] <math>(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)</math> of a [[vector (geometric)|vector]] ''v'' in a [[vector space]] with [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] <math>\lbrace e_1, e_2, ..., e_n \rbrace </math>, are the coefficients of the basis vectors in the expression :<math> v = x_1 e_1 + x_2 e_2 + ... + x_n e_n .</math> ==Examples of physical coefficients== # ''[[coefficient of thermal expansion|Coefficient of Thermal Expansion]]'' ([[thermodynamics]]) (dimensionless) - Relates the change in temperature to the change in a material's dimensions. # ''[[Partition Coefficient]]'' (''K<sub>D</sub>'') ([[chemistry]]) - The ratio of concentrations of a compound in two phases of a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium. # ''[[Hall Effect|Hall coefficient]]'' (electrical physics) - Relates a magnetic field applied to an element to the voltage created, the amount of current and the element thickness. It is a characteristic of the material from which the conductor is made. # ''[[Lift coefficient]]'' (''C<sub>L</sub>'' or ''C<sub>Z</sub>'') ([[Aerodynamics]]) (dimensionless) - Relates the lift generated by an airfoil with the dynamic pressure of the fluid flow around the airfoil, and the planform area of the airfoil. # ''[[Ballistic coefficient]]'' (BC) ([[Aerodynamics]]) (units of kg/m<sup>2</sup>) - A measure of a body's ability to overcome air resistance in flight. BC is a function of mass, diameter, and drag coefficient. # ''[[Transmission coefficient (physics)|Transmission Coefficient]]'' ([[quantum mechanics]]) (dimensionless) - Represents the probability flux of a transmitted wave relative to that of an incident wave. It is often used to describe the probability of a particle [[Quantum tunnelling|tunnelling]] through a barrier. # ''[[Damping|Damping Factor]]'' a.k.a. ''viscous damping coefficient'' (Physical Engineering) (units of newton-seconds per meter) - relates a damping force with the velocity of the object whose motion is being ==Chemistry== A coefficient is a number placed in front of a term in a [[chemical equation]] to indicate how many [[molecule|molecules]] (or atoms) take part in the reaction. For example, in the formula <math>2H_2 + O_2 \rarr 2H_2O</math>, the number 2's in front of <math>H_2</math> and <math>H_2O</math> are [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometric coefficients]]. ==See also== *[[Degree of a polynomial]] *[[Monic polynomial]] ==References== *Sabah Al-hadad and C.H.

More precisely, a function ''f'' : '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> &rarr; '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> is called '''coercive''' if :<math>\frac{f(x) \cdot x}{\| x \|} \to + \infty \mbox{ as } \| x \| \to + \infty,</math> where "<math>\cdot</math>" denotes the usual [[dot product]] and <math>\|x\|</math> denotes the usual Euclidean [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] of the vector ''x''. More generally, a function ''f'' : ''X'' &rarr; ''Y'' between two [[topological space]]s ''X'' and ''Y'' is called '''coercive''' if for every [[compact space|compact subset]] ''J'' of ''Y'' there exists a compact subset ''K'' of ''X'' such that :<math>f (X \setminus K) \subseteq Y \setminus J.</math> The [[function composition|composition]] of a [[bijection|bijective]] [[proper map]] followed by a coercive map is coercive. ==Coercive operators and forms== A [[self-adjoint operator]] <math>A:H\to H,</math> where <math>H</math> is a real [[Hilbert space]], is called '''coercive''' if there exists a constant <math>c>0</math> such that : <math>\langle Ax, x\rangle \ge c\|x\|^2</math> for all <math>x</math> in <math>H.</math> A [[bilinear form]] <math>a:H\times H\to \mathbb R</math> is called '''coercive''' if there exists a constant <math>c>0</math> such that :<math>a(x, x)\ge c\|x\|^2</math> for all <math>x</math> in <math>H.</math> It follows from the [[Riesz representation theorem]] that any symmetric (<math>a(x, y)=a(y, x)</math> for all <math>x, y</math> in <math>H</math>), continuous (<math>|a(x, y)|\le K\|x\|\,\|y\|</math> for all <math>x, y</math> in <math>H</math> and some constant <math>K>0</math>) and coercive bilinear form <math>a</math> has the representation : <math>a(x, y)=\langle Ax, y\rangle</math> for some self-adjoint operator <math>A:H\to H,</math> which then turns out to be a coercive operator. Also, given a coercive operator self-adjoint operator <math>A,</math> the bilinear form <math>a</math> defined as above is coercive. One can also show that any self-adjoint operator <math>A:H\to H</math> is a coercive operator if and only if it is a coercive function (if one replaces the dot product with the more general inner product in the definition of coercivity of a function). The definitions of coercivity for functions, operators, and bilinear forms are closely related and compatible. ==References== * {{cite book| author=Renardy, Michael and Rogers, Robert C. | title=An introduction to partial differential equations | edition=Second edition | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=New York, NY | year=2004 | pages=xiv+434 | id=ISBN 0-387-00444-0 }} *{{cite book | last = Bashirov | first = Agamirza E | title = Partially observable linear systems under dependent noises | publisher = Basel; Boston: Birkhäuser Verlag | date = 2003 | pages = | isbn = 081766999X }} *{{cite book | author2-link=Neil Trudinger | first1=D. | last1=Gilbarg | first2=N. | last2=Trudinger | title = Elliptic partial differential equations of second order, 2nd ed
