Prime and Hi-Q, and with Prime now destroyed, the process completed itself in Hi-Q's body, and the two minds and souls became one. Hi-Q's biomechanical body was stripped down and reconstructed by the [[Last Autobot]], resurrecting Optimus Prime once more with the two minds now one. Prime joined with the other Transformers on the planet Klo and routed [[Bludgeon (Transformers)|Bludgeon]]'s Decepticons. ''Prime would appear in the U.K. Marvel comic issue #234, "Prime's Rib!" This story is set in the near future, 1995, where Optimus Prime, [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]] and [[Rodimus|Hot Rod]] introduce the latest Autobot, [[Arcee]], to the human [[feminists]]. She was met with displeasure by the humans, being called a token female and disliked for her pink color. They were then attacked by [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]], [[Fangry]], [[Horri-Bull]] and [[Squeezeplay (Transformers)|Squeezeplay]], who thought the Autobot would be unveiling a new weapon. The Autobots fought off the Decepticons, who escaped, but nothing seemed to please the human feminists.'' An undisclosed period of time later, at the beginning of the ''[[Transformers: Generation 2]]'' comic book sequel series, Prime was restored to a form resembling his original body, and he and the Transformers found themselves caught in the schemes of a "second generation" of Cybertronians led by the icy [[Jhiaxus]], who were colonizing and cyber-forming other worlds. Plagued by nightmarish visions of a life-destroying entity called "the [[Swarm (Transformers)|Swarm]]", Prime looked into Cybertron's past and discovered that Jhiaxus and his kind were the result of further unintentional Transformer reproduction, their nature and intent distilled to the purest, most unemotional form of conquest, and that the Swarm was the by-product of this process. Entering into an alliance with the recreated Megatron's Decepticons to combat the Swarm and Jhiaxus, Prime was consumed by the abomination and destroyed, but at the last moment, unleashed the energies of the Matrix into the Swarm, purifying it. In parting, the Swarm recreated Prime in a new form, (based on his "Hero" toy), and he and Megatron set out to lead the united Autobots and Decepticons into a new age. ==Animated series== [[Image:Orionpax.jpg|right|thumb|Orion Pax]] As seen in the episode "War Dawn", Optimus Prime began his life as a robot named Orion Pax, a mostly defenseless dock worker during the Golden Age of Cybertron nine million years ago, with a girlfriend named [[Elita One|Ariel]], and a best friend named Dion. At the time, a new breed of robot had recently appeared on the planet with new flight capabilities in robot mode that made Orion idolize them. Unfortunately for Orion, when [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]], the leader of the new group of robots, approached him with inquiries about using one of the dock warehouses, Orion was swayed by Megatron, and he and Ariel were severely wounded when [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]] and his forces then attacked in order to claim the energy stored there. Searching for someone to help them, the time-displaced [[Aerialbots]] took Orion and Ariel to the ancient Autobot, [[Alpha Trion]], who used them as the first subjects for the new reconstruction process he had developed — rebuilding the frail Autobot frames into battle-hardy configurations. With this reconstruction, Orion Pax became Optimus Prime, the first of the Autobot warriors. Optimus took the mantle of leadership as the civil war against the Decepticons erupted, and would remain in that position for the next four million years. Ariel was rebuilt into [[Elita One]], the commander of the Autobot resistance on Cybertron. The fate of Dion is left unrevealed. It has been speculated by fans that Dion might have become Ironhide or Ultra Magnus just as Orion and Ariel became Optimus and Elita, but this remains fan speculation only, and there is no evidence to support the idea, Ironhide's close friendship with Optimus notwithstanding. As leader of the Autobots, Prime headed up their mission to search out new worlds with new sources of energy to revitalize the depleted Cybertron. Optimus vowed to Elita that he would return from his mission for her, but just before the launch of the Ark, Optimus was mistakenly led to believe Elita was killed. Shortly after its launch, the Autobots' craft was attacked by the Decepticons' space cruiser, the [[Nemesis (Transformers)|''Nemesis'']], and boarded by Megatron and the Decepticons. In the ensuing struggle, the G-forces of a nearby planet pulled both craft down, and the Autobots' ship crashed into a volcano, thrusting all the occupants into emergency stasis. Four million years later, in the Earth year 1984 A.D., a volcanic eruption jarred the ship's computer, [[Teletraan I]] back to life, and it reactivated the Decepticons, programming them with new Earth-based disguise modes. As a parting gesture, [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]] fired upon the Autobot ship, creating a landslide. The vibrations from that landslide knocked Prime into the path of the computer's restoration beam, restoring him to life, and beginning the war anew on Earth. Prime was perpetually at the forefront of the action throughout the early years of the war on Earth, usually confronting Megatron, and, in some rare instances, being forced to team up with him for the greater good (or the lesser evil) - such as against the [[Insecticon]]-controlled Decepticons or the [[Combaticons]]. He has suffered his fair share of battlefield scrapes, almost meeting his end when his vital cosmotron component was critically damaged by the [[Seekers (Transformers)|Decepticon jets]] and [[Laserbeak]], having his body be disassembled and turned into Decepticon trophies (such as turning much of his body into a pet "alligaticon" and one of his arms into a defense laser). Prime suffered a severe — though unfair — defeat when Megatron challenged him to one-on-one combat while imbued with the different abilities of all the Decepticons. The loser would leave Earth. However, Teletraan I discovered the deception in time and the Autobots were able to drive the Decepticons off. In "Prime Problem", Megatron created a clone of him, which cause confusion with the other Autobots which lead to tests. However, [[Windcharger]] and Spike were able to identify the clone before it led the Autobots into their demise. In "Prime Target", the big game
