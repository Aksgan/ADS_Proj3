This is particularly found in [[schematic]] diagrams or on indicator lights, as on laptops, to indicate hard drive access. In most modern operating systems, hard drives are instead represented by an illustration or photograph of a hard drive enclosure. These are illustrated below. <gallery widths="240"> File:Hdd icon.svg|Today, hard drives are symbolized by a picture of the enclosure. File:RAID 0.svg|Schematically, hard drives may be represented by cylinders or stacks of platters, as in this [[RAID]] diagram. File:DysanRemovableDiskPack.agr.jpg|The cylinder schematic derives from hard drives internally being a stack of platters, as in these 1970s vintage disk pack (cover removed). </gallery> ==Manufacturers== {{see also|History of hard disk drives}} More than 200 companies have manufactured hard disk drives. Today most drives are made by [[Seagate Technology|Seagate]], [[Western Digital]], [[Hitachi Ltd.|Hitachi]], [[Samsung]], and [[Toshiba]]. ==See also== {{Portal box|Electronics|Information Technology}} <!-- We have removed links which are already addressed in the article.

Current security enhancements to Gentoo Linux can be: *[[SELinux]] **A system of mandatory access controls. [[SELinux]] can enforce the security policy over all processes and objects in the system, and is an optional feature in all 2.6 kernel source packages. *[[RSBAC]] **A mandatory access control security system based on Generalized Framework for Access Control (GFAC). It provides several standard and custom (and mixables) access control models. It can enforce [[operating system]] access rules. *[[PaX]]/[[grsecurity]] **[[grsecurity]] is a complete security solution providing such features as a [[mandatory access control|MAC]] or [[RBAC]] system, [[chroot]] restrictions, address space modification protection (via [[PaX]]), auditing features, randomization features, linking restrictions to prevent file race conditions, ipc protections and much more. *Hardened Toolchain **Transparent implementation of [[PaX]] [[address space layout randomization]]s and stack smashing protections using [[Executable and Linkable Format|ELF]] shared objects as executables. *sys-kernel/hardened-sources **A kernel source package which includes patches for hardened subprojects, and stability/security-oriented patches, including [[Grsecurity]]. *[[Bastille Linux]] **[[Bastille Linux]] is an interactive application which gives the user suggestions on securing their machine. It will be customized to make suggestions about other Hardened Gentoo subprojects. The Mandatory Access Control (MAC) parts of SELinux, RSBAC and grsecurity are usually incompatible to each other. However, the chroot and network restrictions of grsecurity and the memory protection of PaX can be used with the SELinux MAC model for example. ==See also== {{Portal|Free software}} *[[Security focused operating system|Security Focused Operating Systems]] *[[Comparison of Linux distributions]] ==External links== *[http://hardened.gentoo.org Hardened Gentoo homepage] *[http://www.bpfh.net/simes/computing/chroot-break.html Chroot isn't that good] [[Category:Operating system security]] [[Category:Gentoo Linux]] [[pt:Hardened Gentoo]] [[ru:Hardened Gentoo]]</text> </page> <page> <id>16277</id> <title>Hardness of approximation</title> <text>In [[computer science]], '''hardness of approximation''' is a field that studies the complexity of finding near-optimal solutions to optimization problems. It complements the study of [[approximation algorithm]]s by proving, for certain problems, a limit on the factors with which their solution can be efficiently approximated. Typically such limits show a factor of approximation beyond which a problem becomes NP-hard, implying that finding a polynomial time approximation for the problem is impossible unless [[P=NP]]. Some hardness of approximation results, however, are based on other hypotheses, a notable one among which is the [[unique games conjecture]]. Since the early 1970s it was known that many optimization problems could not be solved in [[polynomial time]] unless [[NP=P]], but in many of these problems the optimal solution could be efficiently approximated to a certain degree. In the early 1990s, with the development of [[PCP (complexity)|PCP]] theory, it became clear that there is a limit to the approximability of many of these optimization problems: for many optimization problems there is a threshold beyond which they are [[NP-hard]] to approximate. Hardness of approximation theory deals with studying the approximation threshold of such problems. ==Examples== For an example of an NP-hard optimization problem that is hard to approximate, see [[set cover]]. ==See also== * [[PCP theorem]] ==Further reading== * [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~luca/pubs/inapprox.ps Survey, a good starter] - by [[Luca Trevisan]] ==External links== * [http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/533/05au/ CSE 533: The PCP Theorem and Hardness of Approximation, Autumn 2005], syllabus from the [[University of Washington]], Venkatesan Guruswami and Ryan O'Donnell [[Category:Computational complexity theory]] [[Category:Mathematical optimization]] {{comp-sci-theory-stub}}</text> </page> <page>
