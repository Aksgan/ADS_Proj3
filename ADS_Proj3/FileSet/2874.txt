systemic and meta-systemic approaches with a strong contribution from physicists and mathematicians. The basic concrete objective of all these approaches is to develop a model of mind/intelligence which could be implemented on a computer and could be considered sufficiently "human-like" to be mistaken for another human mind by a naive observer{{Dubious|date=April 2010}}. ==Philosophy of mind perspective== '''A simple concrete example''': If someone pricks you with a pin, you will most likely feel pain. That instance of feeling pain is an instantiation of the property ''being in (or a) pain''. It is important to distinguish between the predicate 'is a pain' which is a linguistic entity, and the property denoted by the predicate. This becomes important in the [[philosophy of mind]] when the two are confused, especially concerning [[reductionism|intertheoretic reductionism]] and [[ontological]] [[reductionism]] {{Why|date=April 2010}}. {{Philosophy of mind}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Mental Property}} [[Category:Philosophy of mind]] {{Philosophy-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>24079</id> <title>Menu dependence</title> <text>Roughly speaking, in [[decision theory]], [[game theory]], and [[rational choice]], '''menu dependence''' arises when the evaluation of alternatives for choice or the mode of selection guiding choice varies parametrically with what collection of alternatives is available for choice (i.e., with what "menu" or decision problem a decision maker is facing). Menu dependence can be accompanied by violations of various so-called consistency (or coherence) constraints, such as Sen's condition α (also known as Chernoff's Axiom, a '''contraction''' condition) and Sen's conditions γ and β ('''expansion''' conditions). While the phenomenon can arise in a variety of ways, menu dependence is often informally associated with a change in a decision maker's preferences among alternatives with the addition of [[irrelevant alternative]]s. == See also == * [[Independence of irrelevant alternatives]] {{mathapplied-stub}} [[Category:Applied mathematics]]</text> </page> <page> <id>24089</id> <title>Mercury (mythology)</title> <text>[[Image:Mercurius.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Mercury'' by 17th-century [[Flemish people|Flemish]] sculptor [[Artus Quellinus]], identified by his hat, [[money bag|drawstring purse]], [[caduceus]], winged sandals, cock (rooster), and goat]] {{Ancient Roman religion|259px}} '''Mercury''' ({{pron-en|ˈmɜrkjʉri}}, [[Latin]]: '''Mercurius''' {{audio|La-cls-Mercurius.ogg|listen}}) was a messenger,<ref>[http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/Hermes.html Theoi.com]</ref> and a god of trade, the son of [[Maia Maiestas]] and [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] in [[Roman mythology]]. His name is related to the Latin word ''merx'' ("merchandise"; compare ''merchant'', ''commerce'', etc.), ''mercari'' (''to trade''), and ''merces'' (''wages'').<ref>http://www.behindthename.com/name/mercury</ref> In his earliest forms, he appears to have been related to the [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan deity]] [[Turms]], but most of his characteristics and mythology were borrowed from the analogous Greek deity, [[Hermes]]. Latin writers rewrote Hermes' myths and substituted his name with that of Mercury. However there are at least two myths that involve Mercury that are Roman in origin. In [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', Mercury reminds [[Aeneas]] of his mission to found the city of Rome. In [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', Mercury is assigned to escort the nymph [[Larunda]] to the underworld. Mercury, however, fell in love with Larunda and made love to her on the way; this act has also been interpreted as a rape. Larunda thereby became mother to two children, referred to as the [[Lares]], invisible [[household god]]s. Mercury has influenced the name of many things in a variety of scientific fields, such as the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], and the element [[mercury (element)|mercury]], which it was formally associated. The word ''[[wikt:mercurial|mercurial]]'' is commonly used to refer to something or someone erratic, volatile or unstable, derived from Mercury's swift flights from place to place. ==Worship== [[Image:Mercurybyhendrickgoltzius.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|[[Hendrick Goltzius]]: ''Mercury'', with his symbols]] Mercury did not appear among the [[numina|numinous]] ''[[di indigetes]]'' of early [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]]. Rather, he subsumed the earlier [[Dei Lucrii]] as Roman religion was [[syncretism|syncretized]] with [[Religion in ancient Greece|Greek religion]] during the time of the [[Roman Republic]], starting around the 4th century BC. From the beginning, Mercury had essentially the same aspects as [[Hermes]], wearing winged shoes [[talaria]] and a winged [[petasos]], and carrying the [[caduceus]], a herald's staff with two entwined snakes that was [[Apollo]]'s gift to Hermes. He was often accompanied by a [[cockerel]], herald of the new day, a ram or goat, symbolizing [[fertility]], and a tortoise, referring to Mercury's legendary invention of the [[lyre]] from a tortoise shell. Like Hermes, he was also a messenger of the gods and a god of trade, particularly of the [[grain]] trade. Mercury was also considered a god of abundance and commercial success, particularly in [[Gaul]]. He was also, like Hermes, the Romans' [[psychopomp]], leading newly-deceased souls to the afterlife. Additionally, [[Ovid]] wrote that Mercury carried [[Morpheus (mythology)|Morpheus]]' dreams from the valley of [[Hypnos|Somnus]] to sleeping humans.<ref name="Littleton">Littleton, C. Scott (Ed.)

ISBN 1-904292-01-1.</ref> Mercury's temple in the [[Circus Maximus]], between the [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]] and [[Palatine Hill|Palatine]] hills, was built in 495 BC. This was a fitting place to worship a swift god of trade and travel, since it was a major center of commerce as well as a racetrack. Since it stood between the [[plebs|plebeian]] stronghold on the Aventine and the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] center on the Palatine, it also emphasized the role of Mercury as a [[meditation|mediator]]. Because Mercury was not one of the early deities surviving from the [[Roman Kingdom]], he was not assigned a ''[[flamen]]'' ("priest"), but he did have a major festival on May 15, the [[Mercuralia]]. During the Mercuralia, merchants sprinkled water from his sacred well near the [[Porta Capena]] on their heads. ==Syncretism== [[Image:Tricephale Carnavalet.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A three-headed image of a [[Celtic mythology|Celtic deity]] found in Paris; interpreted as Mercury and now believed to represent [[Lugus]]<ref>Bas-relief discovered in Paris in 1867 and preserved at the [[Carnavalet Museum]], from J.-L.

Mercury in particular was reported as becoming extremely popular among the nations the [[Roman Empire]] conquered; [[Julius Caesar]] wrote of Mercury being the most popular god in Britain and Gaul, regarded as the inventor of all the
