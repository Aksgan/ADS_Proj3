babies are born in the fall. It has a gestation period of about 140 days. The pregnant female leaves the group to have her baby and returns 2-4 months later. The newborn spider monkey is independent at about 10 months.<ref> Spider Monkeys, Great Book of the Animal Kingdom, Crescent Books, Inc., ISBN 0517088010 pp. 378-379 </ref> ==Similar or Related Species== The other subspecies of black spider monkey is Ateles ''paniscus paniscus''. It is distinguished from Ateles ''paniscus chamek'' by the number of chromosomes (2n = 32 in A.p. ''paniscus'' vs. 2n = 34 in A.p. ''chamek'') in addition to several specific chromosomal differences. The two subspecies have been interbred in captivity, resulting in offspring with reduced fertility (but not sterility).<ref> de Boer, L.E.M., de Bruijn, M., 2005. Chromosomal distinction between the red-faced and black-faced black spider monkey (Ateles ''paniscus paniscus'' and A.''chamek''.)</ref> There are several related species such as the Central American spider monkey or [[Geoffroy%27s_Spider_Monkey|Geoffroy’s Spider Monkey]] (A. g. ''ornatus''), and the white-bellied spider monkey (A. ''hybridus''). Both of these have a prehensile tail, a thumbless hand, and other characteristics that are found in all spider monkeys.<ref> Spider Monkey, Animal The Definitive Visual Guide to the World’s Wildlife, ISBN 0789477645 p. 123; Spider Monkeys, Great Book of the Animal Kingdom, Crescent Books, Inc., ISBN 0517088010 pp. 378-379 </ref> ==References== <references/> {{Atelidae nav}} [[Category:Spider monkeys and woolly monkeys]] [[de:Schwarzgesichtklammeraffe]] [[es:Ateles chamek]] [[ko:페루거미원숭이]] [[it:Ateles chamek]] [[hu:Feketeképű pókmajom]]</text> </page> <page> <id>28945</id> <title>Petascale</title> <text>{{nofootnotes|date=February 2009}} [[Image:Jaguar-petascale.jpg|thumb|Cray XT5 Jaguar supercomputer, Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility]] In [[computing]], '''petascale''' refers to a computer system capable of reaching performance in excess of one [[FLOPS|petaflop]], i.e. one [[quadrillion]] [[floating point]] operations per [[second]]. The standard benchmark tool is [[LINPACK]] and [[Top500|Top500.org]] is the organisation which tracks the fastest supercomputers. Some uniquely specialized petascale computers do not rank on the Top500 list since they cannot run LINPACK. This makes comparisons hard to ordinary supercomputers. Petascale can also refer to very large storage systems where the capacity exceeds one [[petabyte]] (PB). ==Applications== Petascale computing will be used to do advanced computations in fields such as [[weather forecasting|weather]] and [[climate simulation]], nuclear simulations, [[cosmology]], [[quantum chemistry]], and [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] science. ==Development== The [[National Science Foundation]] is responsible for initiating and funding several petascale computers in the [[USA]], as well as [[DARPA]] who gave [[IBM]] the contract to develop the petascale [[PERCS]] (Productive, Easy-to-use, Reliable Computer System) platform. [[China]] has developed two petascale computers, [[Nebulae (computer)|Nebulae]] and [[Tianhe-I]]. Other countries, such as [[Germany]] and [[Japan]], have plans of their own for petascale computers. Petascale computers are under development from manufacturers such as [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Cray]], [[IBM]], [[Dawning Information Industry|Dawning]], [[SGI]], and [[NEC]]. ===Active=== As of January 2011, these are the only known active petascale computers in the world. *[[IBM Roadrunner|Roadrunner]], built by [[IBM]], was the first computer to go petascale, and did so on May 25, 2008, with sustained performance of 1.026 petaflops. *[[Cray XT5|XT5]] ''"Jaguar"'', built by [[Cray]], was the second, later in 2008.

Born in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]], he was a member of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] faculty from 1953 to 1991. In 1955, Elias introduced [[convolutional code]]s as an alternative to [[block code]]s. He also established the [[binary erasure channel]] and proposed [[list decoding]] of error-correcting codes as an alternative to unique [[Decoding methods|decoding]].
