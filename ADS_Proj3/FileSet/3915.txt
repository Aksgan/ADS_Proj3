and assess it, and there should be an established way of [[citation|citing]] the document so that formal reference can be made to them in future scientific publication. The lack of an established archival system is one of the hurdles that World Wide Web based scientific publication has had to overcome. Reliable repositories such as [[arXiv]] or [[PubMed Central]] have been instituted, and progress is now being made on their interoperability and permanence. # The content should be presented in the context of previous scientific investigations, by citation of relevant documents in the existing literature, usually in a section called an "Introduction". # Empirical techniques, laid out in a section usually called "Materials and Methods", should be described in such a way that a subsequent scientist, with appropriate knowledge of and experience in the relevant field, should be able to repeat the observations and know whether he or she has obtained the same result. This naturally varies between subjects, and obviously does not apply to mathematics and related subjects. #Similarly, the results of the investigation, in a section usually called "Results", data should be presented in tabular or graphic form ([[image]], [[chart]], [[schematic]], [[diagram]] or [[drawing]]). These figures should be accompanied by a caption and referenced in the text of the article. # Interpretation of the meaning of the results is usually addressed in a "Discussion" or "Conclusion" section. The conclusions drawn should be based on previous literature and/or new empirical results, in such a way that any reader with knowledge of the field can follow the argument and confirm that the conclusions are sound. That is, acceptance of the conclusions must not depend on personal [[appeal to authority|authority]], [[rhetoric|rhetorical skill]], or [[faith]]. # Finally, a "References" or "Literature Cited" section lists the sources cited by the authors in the format required by the journal. === Peer review === Though [[Peer review]] and the learned journal format are not themselves an essential part of scientific literature, they're both convenient ways of ensuring that the above fundamental criteria are met. They are essentially a means of [[quality control]], a term which also encompasses other means towards the same goal. The "quality" being referred to here is the scientific one, which consists of transparency and repeatability of the research for independent verification, the validity of the conclusions and interpretations drawn from the reported data, overall importance for advance within a given field of knowledge, novelty, and in certain fields applicability as well. The lack of peer review is what makes most [[technical report]]s and World Wide Web publications unacceptable as contributions to the literature. The relatively weak peer review often applied to books and chapters in edited books means that their status is also second-tier, unless an author's personal standing is so high that prior achievement and a continued stake in one's reputation within the scientific community signals a clear expectation of quality. The emergence of institutional digital repositories where scholars can post their work as it is submitted to a print-based journal has taken formal peer review into a state of flux. Though publicizing a preprint online does not prevent it from being peer reviewed, it does allow an unreviewed copy to be widely circulated. On the positive side this change has led to faster dissemination of novel work within the scientific community; on the negative it has made it more difficult to discern a valid scientific contribution from the unmeritorious. Increasing reliance on [[abstracting service]]s, especially on those available electronically, means that the effective criterion for whether a publication format forms part of the established, trusted literature is whether it is covered by these services; in particular, by the specialised service for the discipline concerned such as [[Chemical Abstracts Service]], and by the major interdisciplinary services such as those marketed by the [[Institute for Scientific Information]]. ==Controversies== The concept of published articles is itself giving rise to controversy, especially as many journals refuse to publish colour plates for example, and if they do, they insist that authors pay the publisher. The problem arises because of the antiquated [[printing]] equipment still widely used by many publishers, and by the need for higher quality [[paper]]. In popular magazines, colour is the norm rather than the exception, as it is in computer text and articles. This is a great hindrance in many areas of research because colour photographs for example, usually provide much more information than black and white photographs. Often colour pictures are the only form which can be used to illustrate a point, such as blood smears in a [[forensic science]] article. Other areas of controversy include the transfer of [[copyright]] from author to publisher, because many authors want to propagate their ideas more widely and re-use their material elsewhere without the need for permission. Usually an author or authors circumvent that problem by rewriting an article and using other pictures. Some publishers may also want publicity for their journal so will approve [[facsimile]] [[reproduction]] unconditionally; other publishers are more resistant. {{Fact|date=May 2008}} ==Footnotes== <!--<nowiki> See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref> and </ref> tags, and the template below </nowiki>--> {{reflist}} == See also == {{commonscat}} * [[Academic publishing]] * [[Acknowledgment index]] * [[Citation index]] * [[Open access (publishing)]] * ''[[De re metallica]]'' – book cataloging the state of the art of mining, refining, and smelting metals, published in 1556 * ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'' – extensive book written by the polymath Chinese scientist and statesman Shen Kuo by 1088 AD * [[Grey literature]] * [[UKSG E-Resources Management Handbook]] {{academic publishing}} [[Category:Academic literature| ]] [[Category:Technical communication]] <!-- interwiki --> [[es:Artículo científico]] [[fr:Publication scientifique]] [[hr:Znanstvena literatura]] [[it:Letteratura scientifica]] [[ka:სამეცნიერო ლიტერატურა]] [[nl:Wetenschappelijke literatuur]] [[pl:Publikacja naukowa]] [[pt:Artigo científico]] [[ru:Научная литература]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33377</id> <title>Scientific visualization</title> <text>[[Image:Rayleigh-Taylor instability.jpg|thumb|280px|A scientific visualization of an extremely large simulation of a [[Rayleigh–Taylor instability]] caused by two mixing fluids.<ref>[https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit/gallery.html Visualizations that have been created with VisIt]. at wci.llnl.gov.
