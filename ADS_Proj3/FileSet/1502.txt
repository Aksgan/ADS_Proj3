Holmes]] short story set in 1894 and involves the discovery of a bloody fingerprint which helps Holmes to expose the real criminal and free his client. A 1985 Granada TV adaptation of an 1893 [[Sherlock Holmes]] short story set in 1891, ''[[The Adventure of the Final Problem]]'', has a [[plot hole]] in the screenplay caused by Holmes's use of the [[Bertillon]] criminal ID system, in which he uses fingerprints to trap Moriarty's agents and recover the [[Mona Lisa]]. The real Bertillon system did not use fingerprints. Bertillon had added four spaces for fingerprints on his identification cards by 1900 because of the growing popularity of fingerprinting, but the identification cards were still based on anthropometric measurements. The British detective writer [[R. Austin Freeman]]'s first Thorndyke novel ''The Red Thumb-Mark'' was published in 1907 and features a bloody fingerprint left on a piece of paper together with a parcel of diamonds inside a safe-box. These become the center of a medico-legal investigation led by [[Dr Thorndyke]], who defends the accused whose fingerprint matches that on the paper, after the diamonds are stolen. ===Movies=== The movie ''[[Men In Black (film)|Men In Black]]'', a popular 1997 science fiction thriller, required Agent J, played by [[Will Smith]], to remove his ten fingerprints by putting his hands on a metal ball, an action deemed necessary by the MIB agency to remove the identity of its agents. And in a 2009 science fiction movie starring [[Paul Giamatti]], ''[[Cold Souls (film)|Cold Souls]]'', a [[Mule (smuggling)|mule]] who is paid to smuggle souls across borders, wears latex fingerprints to frustrate airport security terminals. She can change her identity by changing her wig, and switching latex fingerprints from the privacy of a [[restroom]], always storing extra fingerprints in a [[ziploc]] bag, so she can always assume an [[Pseudonym|alias]] that is suitable to her undertaking. ==Other reliable identifiers== Other forms of biometric identification utilizing a physical attribute that is unique to every human include [[Iris recognition]], the use of dental records in [[forensic dentistry]], the [[tongue]] and [[DNA profiling]], also known as genetic fingerprinting. ==Fingerprint mutilation== There are several documented cases of people deliberately mutilating their fingerprints in an effort to avoid being identified from marks left on the surfaces they touch. Methods used have included burning the fingertips with acid, which [[John Dillinger]] tried (and failed; prints taken during a previous arrest and upon death still exhibited almost complete relation to one another), and surgical alteration.<ref name=abel>{{Cite news | url = http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/07/21/to_avoid_id_more_are_mutilating_fingerprints/ | last = Abel | first = David | title = To avoid ID, more are mutilating fingerprints | newspaper = Boston Globe }}</ref> ==See also== {{Commons category|Fingerprints}} * [[1,8-Diazafluoren-9-one]], chemical used to find fingerprints on [[porous]] surfaces * [[Automated fingerprint identification]] * [[Canadian Identification Society]] * [[Dermatoglyphics]] * [[Dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis]] * [[Fingerprint authentication]] * [[Fingerprint Inquiry]] * [[Fingerprint powder]] * [[Fingerprint Verification Competition]] * [[Forged evidence]] * [[Government database]] * [[International Association for Identification]] * [[Juan Vucetich]] * [[Naegeli syndrome]] * [[New York State Police Troop C scandal]] * [[Ulnar loop]] ==References== {{Reflist|2}} ==Further reading== * Ashbaugh, David R. 1999.
