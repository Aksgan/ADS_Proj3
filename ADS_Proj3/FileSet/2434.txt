no need for costly search processes in the database. A [[behavioral script]] is a type of frame that describes what happens temporally; the usual example given is that of describing going to a [[restaurant]]. The steps include waiting to be seated, receiving a menu, ordering, etc. The different solutions can be arranged in a so-called [[semantic spectrum]] with respect to their semantic expressivity. == See also == * [[Commonsense knowledge base]] * [[Valuation-based system]] == References == <references/> == Further reading == * [[Ronald J.

Typically, not all subsets are feasible, due to prerequisite relations among the concepts. The knowledge space is the family of all the feasible subsets.

Closure under both unions and intersections gives (''Q'',∪,∩) the structure of a [[distributive lattice]]; [[Birkhoff's representation theorem]] for distributive lattices shows that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all [[preorder|quasiorders]] on Q and the set of all quasi-ordinal knowledge spaces on Q. I.e., each quasi-ordinal knowledge space can be represented by a quasi-order and vice versa. An important subclass of knowledge spaces, the ''well-graded knowledge spaces'' or ''learning spaces'', can be defined as satisfying two additional mathematical axioms: # If <math>S</math> and <math>T</math> are both feasible subsets of concepts, then <math>S\cup T</math> is also feasible. In educational terms: if it is possible for someone to know all the concepts in ''S'', and someone else to know all the concepts in ''T'', then we can posit the potential existence of a third person who combines the knowledge of both people. # If <math>S</math> is a nonempty feasible subset of concepts, then there is some concept ''x'' in ''S'' such that <math>S\setminus\{x\}</math> is also feasible. In educational terms: any feasible state of knowledge can be reached by learning one concept at a time. A set family satisfying these two axioms forms a [[mathematical structure]] known as an [[antimatroid]]. ==Construction of knowledge spaces== In practice there exist several methods to construct knowledge spaces. The most frequently used method is querying experts. There exist several querying algorithms that allow one or several experts to construct a knowledge space by answering a sequence of simple questions.<ref>{{citation|title=Extracting human expertise for constructing knowledge spaces: An algorithm |last1=Koppen |first1=M. |journal=Journal of Mathematical Psychology|volume=37|pages=1–20 |year=1993 |doi=10.1006/jmps.1993.1001}}.</ref><ref>{{citation|title=How to build a
