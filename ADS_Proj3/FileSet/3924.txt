(computer science)|thread]] support, [[data compression]] and [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]]. ScriptBasic also has an open interface for [[preprocessor]] developers. These are modules that may act not only during run-time but also compile time, thus making it possible to alter the language. Currently there is a single preprocessor that delivers [[debugger]] functionality. This lets the BASIC programmer to run the BASIC program line by line, examine variable contents, set break points and all the usual debugging features. This debugger supports not only the command line version but also the web server implementation allowing full interactive debugging of CGI applications in BASIC. The architecture of the interpreter internally is [[object oriented]] and provides a clean and well documented interface to embed the interpreter into any application written in [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[C++]]. The whole source code is extensively documented and commented, which is an outstanding feature compared to other embeddable script language implementations. Slides in HTML format with English narration in [[RealAudio]] format are also available to get a jump start learning the architecture and module, preprocessor and embedding developments. ScriptBasic is supported by a [http://www.scriptbasic.org/forum/ forum]. ==Features== * Open source LGPL project * Multi-platform (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, ...) * Fast multi-threaded ScriptBasic HTTP application server * In memory session handling * Extension module API (CGI, MySQL, ODBC, Berkeley DB, GTK, Curl, ...) * HTML template file support * Command line interpreter for utility applications and standard CGI programming * Create standalone executables without compiling (This bundles the interpreter and code together into an executable file) * Name space support * Relaxed / auto variable typing (forget DIM and think undef) * TYPE, [[Is functions|ISARRAY, ISSTRING, ISINTEGER, ISREAL, ISNUMERIC, ISDEF, ISUNDEF, ISEMPTY]] * Associative arrays (reference elements by name - MySQL & ODBC modules assign columns to named arrays) * Standard branching syntax ([[GOTO]], [[GOSUB]]/[[Return statement|RETURN]], [[For loop|FOR/NEXT]], DO/WHILE/UNTIL, REPEAT/UNTIL, CALL) * Multi-function IO directives ([LINE] INPUT, PRINT, OPEN - files, ports, standard IO) * Time/Date formatting and math * Extended string functions (REPLACE, SPLIT, SPLITA) * GTK / Glade support for desktop application development * Easy to learn and use without prior programming knowledge ==External links== *http://www.scriptbasic.org/ &mdash; ScriptBasic open source project site.

Script doctors generally do their work uncredited, for a variety of commercial and artistic reasons. ==Background== Script doctors are usually brought in during the development and pre-production phases of a film, to address specific issues with the script, as identified by the financiers, production team, and cast. They may also be employed during post production, to help address narrative problems that crop up during the editing process. The use of script doctors was first revealed at the 1973 [[Academy Awards]] when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] thanked [[Robert Towne]] for his work on ''[[The Godfather]]''. Since then, the use of script doctors has been downplayed within the industry, to avoid overshadowing the work of the original writers. Under the [[WGA screenwriting credit system]], a screenwriter must contribute 50 percent to the story and/or characterization in order to qualify for credit. Uncredited [[screenwriter]]s are not eligible to win the [[Screenplay oscar|Academy Award for Best Screenplay]] or the [[Writers Guild of America Award]]s. On his website, [[John August]] revealed that when commissioned to doctor a screenplay, he is provided with a digital copy of the existing script, so doctoring requires little physical retyping.<ref>http://johnaugust.com/</ref> A number of prominent independent filmmakers, such as [[John Sayles]], have worked as script doctors in order to earn the money and clout necessary to make their own films. ==Notable script doctors== * [[Judd Apatow]]: ''[[The Cable Guy]]'', ''[[Happy Gilmore]]'', ''[[The Wedding Singer]]'' * [[John August]]: ''[[Blue Streak (film)|Blue Streak]]'', ''[[Jurassic Park III]]'', ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', ''[[The Rundown]]'', ''[[Iron Man (film)|Iron Man]]'' * [[Roger Avary]]: ''[[True Romance]]'', ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'', ''[[Crying Freeman]]'' * [[David Ayer]]: ''[[Taking Lives]]'' * [[Julian Barry]]: ''[[The River (1984 film)|The River]]'', ''[[Eyes of Laura Mars]]'' * [[Mel Brooks]]: ''[[Get Smart (film)|Get Smart]]'' * [[James Cameron]]: ''[[Point Break]]'' * [[Dick Clement]] and [[Ian La Frenais]]: ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'', ''[[The Rock (film)|The Rock]]'', ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'', ''[[Bad Boys II]]'' * [[Michael Curtis]]: ''[[Lethal Weapon 4]]'', ''[[House on Haunted Hill (1999 film)|House on Haunted Hill]]'', ''[[Girl Next Door]]'' * [[Frank Darabont]]: ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' * [[John Fahy (writer)|John Fahy]]: ''[[Miramax|Miramax Films]]'', ''[[Weinstein Company]]'', ''[http://www.fahyfilms.com Fahy Films]'' * [[Carrie Fisher]]: ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'' ([[Julia Roberts]]' dialogue), ''[[Lethal Weapon 3]]'' ([[Rene Russo]]'s dialogue), ''[[Made in America (film)|Made in America]]'', ''[[My Girl 2]]'', ''[[The River Wild]]'', ''[[Love Affair (1994 film)|Love Affair]]'', ''[[Sister Act]]'', ''[[The Wedding Singer]]'' * [[Scott Frank]]: ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', ''[[Dawn of the Dead (2004 film)|Dawn Of The Dead]]'', ''[[Night at the Museum]]'', ''[[Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian]]'' * [[William Goldman]]: ''[[A Fish Called Wanda]]'', ''[[Twins (1988 film)|Twins]]'', ''[[Chaplin (film)|Chaplin]]'', ''[[Last Action Hero]]'', ''[[Malice (film)|Malice]]'', ''[[Fierce Creatures]]'', ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'' * [[Akiva Goldsman]]: ''[[The Specialist]]'', ''[[Charlie's Angels (film)|Charlie's Angels]]'' * [[Phil Malin]]: '' [[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'', ''[[Californication (TV series)|Californication]]'', ''[[Life (TV series)|Life]]'', ''[[Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles]]'' * [[Ben Hecht]]: ''[[Monkey Business (1931 film)|Monkey Business]]'', ''[[Queen Christina (film)|Queen Christina]]'', ''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star Is Born]]'', ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda (1937 film)|The Prisoner of Zenda]]'', ''[[Angels With Dirty Faces]]'', ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'', ''[[Gone With The Wind (film)|Gone With The
