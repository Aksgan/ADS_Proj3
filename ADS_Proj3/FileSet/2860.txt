([[Periventricular leukomalacia]]). The ultrasound can be performed through the soft spots in the skull of a newborn infant ([[Fontanelle]]) until these completely close at about 1 year of age and form a virtually impenetrable acoustic barrier for the ultrasound. The most common site for cranial ultrasound is the anterior fontanelle. The smaller the fontanelle, the poorer the quality of the picture. | Intracerebral: see [[Transcranial Doppler]] |- | [[Neurology]] | for assessing blood flow and stenoses in the carotid arteries ([[Carotid ultrasonography]]) and the big intracerebral arteries | see [[Carotid ultrasonography]].

In a pelvic sonogram, organs of the pelvic region are imaged. This includes the [[uterus]] and [[ovary|ovaries]] or [[urinary bladder]]. Men are sometimes given a pelvic sonogram to check on the health of their bladder, [[prostate]], or [[testes]] (for example to distinguish [[epididymitis]] from [[testicular torsion]]). There are two methods of performing a pelvic sonography - externally or internally. The internal pelvic sonogram is performed either trans[[vagina]]lly (in a woman) or transrectally (in a man). Sonographic imaging of the pelvic floor can produce important diagnostic information regarding the precise relationship of abnormal structures with other pelvic organs and it represents a useful hint to treat patients with symptoms related to pelvic prolapse, double incontinence and obstructed defecation.<ref>[http://www.pelviperineology.org/practical/sonography_female_pelvic_floor_clinical_indications_and_techniques.html Sonography of the female pelvic floor] Clinical indications and techniques</ref> | |- | [[Musculoskeletal]] | tendons, muscles, nerves, ligaments, soft tissue masses, and bone surfaces | |- | [[Cardiovascular system]] | To assess patency and possible obstruction of arteries [[Arterial sonography]], diagnose [[DVT]] ([[Thrombosonography]]) and determine extent and severity of venous insufficiency ([[venosonography]]) | [[Intravascular ultrasound]] |} Other types of uses include: *[[Intervenion]]al; [[biopsy]], emptying fluids, intrauterine {{dn|Transfusion|transfusion}} ([[Hemolytic disease of the newborn]]) *[[Contrast-enhanced ultrasound]] A general-purpose sonographic machine may be used for most imaging purposes. Usually specialty applications may be served only by use of a specialty transducer. Most ultrasound procedures are done using a transducer on the surface of the body, but improved diagnostic confidence is often possible if a transducer can be placed inside the body. For this purpose, specialty transducers, including endovaginal, endorectal, and transesophageal transducers are commonly employed. At the extreme of this, very small transducers can be mounted on small diameter catheters and placed into blood vessels to image the walls and disease of those vessels. == Therapeutic applications == Therapeutic applications use ultrasound to bring heat or agitation into the body. Therefore much higher energies are used than in diagnostic ultrasound. In many cases the range of frequencies used are also very different. *Ultrasound is sometimes used to clean teeth in [[dental hygienist|dental hygiene]]. *Ultrasound sources may be used to generate regional heating and mechanical changes in biological tissue, e.g. in [[occupational therapy]], [[physical therapy]] and [[experimental cancer treatment|cancer treatment]]. However the use of ultrasound in the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions has fallen out of favor.<ref>A Review of Therapeutic Ultrasound: Effectiveness Studies, Valma J Robertson, Kerry G Baker, Physical Therapy .

These procedures generally use lower frequencies than medical diagnostic ultrasound (from 250 kHz to 2000 kHz), but significantly higher energies. [[HIFU]] treatment is often guided by [[MRI]]. *Focused ultrasound may be used to break up [[kidney stone]]s by [[Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy|lithotripsy]]. *Ultrasound may be used for [[cataract]] treatment by [[phacoemulsification]]. *Additional physiological effects of [[Low intensity pulsed ultrasound|low-intensity ultrasound]] have recently been discovered, e.g. its ability to stimulate bone-growth and its potential to disrupt the [[blood-brain barrier]] for drug delivery. *Procoagulant at 5-12 MHz, == From sound to image == The creation of an image from sound is done in three steps - producing a [[sound wave]], receiving [[Echo (phenomenon)|echoes]], and interpreting those echoes. === Producing a sound wave === [[Image:AlokaPhoto2006a.jpg|frame|right|Medical sonographic instrument]] A sound wave is typically produced by a [[piezoelectric]] [[Ultrasonic sensor|transducer]] encased in a housing which can take a number of forms. Strong, short electrical pulses from the ultrasound machine make the transducer ring at the desired frequency. The [[frequencies]] can be anywhere between 2 and 18 [[Megahertz|MHz]]. The sound is focused either by the shape of the transducer, a lens in front of the transducer, or a complex set of control pulses from the ultrasound scanner machine ([[Beamforming]]). This focusing produces an arc-shaped sound wave from the face of the transducer. The wave travels into the body and comes into focus at a desired depth. Older technology transducers focus their beam with physical lenses. Newer technology transducers use [[phased array]] techniques to enable the sonographic machine to change the direction and depth of focus. Almost all piezoelectric transducers are made of [[ceramic]]. Materials on the face of the transducer enable the sound to be transmitted efficiently into the body (usually seeming to be a rubbery coating, a form of [[impedance matching]]). In addition, a water-based gel is placed between the patient's skin and the probe. The sound wave is partially reflected from the layers between different tissues. Specifically, sound is reflected anywhere there are density changes in the body: e.g. blood cells in blood plasma, small structures in organs, etc. Some of the reflections return to the transducer. === Receiving the echoes === The return of the sound wave to the transducer results in the same process that it took to send the sound wave, except in reverse. The return sound wave vibrates the transducer, the transducer turns
