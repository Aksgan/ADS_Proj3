schemes are demonstrably insecure against chosen ciphertext attack. Consequently, semantic security is now considered an insufficient condition for securing a general-purpose encryption scheme. The notion of semantic security was first put forward by [[Shafi Goldwasser|Goldwasser]] and [[Silvio Micali|Micali]] in 1982.<ref name="goldwasser-micali 1982">[[Shafi Goldwasser|S. Goldwasser]] and [[Silvio Micali|S. Micali]], [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=802212 Probabilistic encryption & how to play mental poker keeping secret all partial information], Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 1982.</ref> However, the definition they initially proposed offered no straightforward means to prove the security of practical cryptosystems. Goldwasser/Micali subsequently demonstrated that semantic security is equivalent to the another definition of security called [[ciphertext indistinguishability]].<ref name="goldwasser-micali 1984">[[Shafi Goldwasser|S. Goldwasser]] and [[Silvio Micali|S. Micali]], [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-0000(84)90070-9 Probabilistic encryption]. Journal of Computer and System Sciences, 28:270-299, 1984.</ref> This later definition is more common than the original definition of semantic security because it better facilitates proving the security of practical cryptosystems. Indistinguishability under [[chosen plaintext attack|Chosen Plaintext Attack]] ([[IND-CPA]]) is commonly defined by the following [[game]]: # A probabilistic polynomial time-bounded adversary is given a public key, which it may use to generate any number of ciphertexts (within polynomial bounds). # The adversary generates two equal-length messages <math>m_0</math> and <math>m_1</math>, and transmits them to a challenge oracle along with the public key. # The challenge oracle selects one of the messages by flipping a fair coin, encrypts the message under the public key, and returns the resulting ciphertext <math>c</math> to the adversary. The underlying [[cryptosystem]] is IND-CPA (and thus semantically secure under chosen plaintext attack) if the adversary cannot determine which of the two messages was chosen by the oracle, with probability significantly greater than <math>1/2</math> (the success rate of random guessing). Variants of this definition define indistinguishability under [[chosen ciphertext attack]] and [[adaptive chosen ciphertext attack]] ([[IND-CCA]], [[IND-CCA2]]). Because the adversary possesses the public encryption key in the above game, a semantically secure encryption scheme must by definition be [[probabilistic encryption|probabilistic]], possessing a component of [[randomness]]; if this were not the case, the adversary could simply compute the deterministic encryption of <math>m_0</math> and <math>m_1</math> and compare these encryptions with the returned ciphertext <math>c</math> to successfully guess the oracle's choice. Semantically secure encryption algorithms include [[Goldwasser-Micali cryptosystem|Goldwasser-Micali]], [[El Gamal]] and [[Paillier]]. These schemes are considered [[provable security|provably secure]], as their semantic security can be reduced to solving some hard mathematical problem (e.g., [[Decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption|Decisional Diffie-Hellman]] or the [[Quadratic Residuosity Problem]]). Other, non-semantically-secure algorithms such as [[RSA]], can be made semantically secure (under stronger assumptions) through the use of random encryption padding schemes such as [[Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding]] (OAEP). ==References== <references /> [[Category:Theory of cryptography]] [[fr:Sécurité sémantique]] [[it:Sicurezza semantica]] [[tr:Anlamsal güvenlik]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33833</id> <title>Semantic technology</title> <text>In [[software]], '''semantic technology''' encodes meanings separately from data and content files, and separately from application code. This enables machines as well as people to understand, share and reason with them at execution time. With semantic technologies, adding, changing and implementing new relationships or interconnecting programs in a different way can be just as simple as changing the external model that these programs share. With traditional [[information technology]], on the other hand, meanings and relationships must be predefined and “hard wired” into data formats and the application program code at design time. This means that when something changes, previously unexchanged information needs to be exchanged, or two programs need to interoperate in a new way, the humans must get involved. Off-line, the parties must define and communicate between them the knowledge needed to make the change, and then recode the data structures and program logic to accommodate it, and then apply these changes to the database and the application. Then, and only then, can they implement the changes. Semantic technologies are “meaning-centered.” They include tools for: * autorecognition of topics and concepts, * information and meaning extraction, and * categorization. Given a question, semantic technologies can directly search topics, concepts, associations that span a vast number of sources. Semantic technologies provide an abstraction layer above existing IT technologies that enables bridging and interconnection of data, content, and processes. Second, from the portal perspective, semantic technologies can be thought of as a new level of depth that provides far more intelligent, capable, relevant, and responsive interaction than with information technologies alone. == See also == * [[Metadata]] * [[Semantic web]] * [[Ontology (computer science)]] * [[Business Intelligence 2.0]] (BI 2.0) * [[Semantic targeting]] ==References== * J.T.
