any means technological or even magical. ==Earth== In [[Jonathan Swift]]'s satirical [[novel]] ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', Swift envisioned [[Laputa]], an island city that floated in the sky. The island was suggested to levitate above the Earth by use of the force of [[magnetism]]. In the 1920s, [[Hugo Gernsback]] speculated about floating cities of the future, suggesting that 10,000 years hence "the city the size of New York will float several miles above the surface of the earth, where the air is cleaner and purer and free from disease carrying bacteria." To stay in the air, "four gigantic generators will shoot earthward electric rays which by reaction with the earth produce the force to keep the city aloft."<ref>see [http://davidszondy.com/future/city/floatingcity.htm illustration from the magazine ''Science and Invention'', February 1922], on Urban Utopias web page (accessed September 23, 2008)</ref> The same Laputa (although uninhabited) is shown in [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s [[Castle in the Sky]]. Although Swift's proposal was intended as satire, [[Buckminster Fuller]] proposed the concept more seriously in the form of the [[Cloud nine (Tensegrity sphere)]] [[megastructure]]<ref>{{cite book | last = Fuller | first = Buckminster| coauthors = Kiyoshi Kuromiya | title = [http://buckminster.info/Biblio/By/By-BkTOC-CriticalPath.htm Critical Path] | publisher = St. Martin's Griffin | year = 1981 | isbn = 0312174918}}</ref>, in which he envisioned structural spheres that float freely in the sky, allowing passengers a migratory lifestyle and a solution to the depletion of Earth's resources. He proposed a {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=mid|-diameter}} [[geodesic dome|geodesic sphere]] that would be heated by sunlight, functioning as a [[thermal airship]]. ==Venus== {{see also|Colonization of Venus}} A design similar to Fuller's ''Cloud Nine'' might permit habitation in the upper atmosphere of [[Venus]], where at ground level the temperature is too hot and the [[atmospheric pressure]] too great. As proposed by [[Geoffrey A. Landis]], the easiest planet (other than Earth) to place floating cities at this point would appear to be [[Venus]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Landis |first=Geoffrey A.| year=2003| title=Colonization of Venus| url=http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&id=APCPCS000654000001001193000001| journal=Conference on Human Space Exploration, Space Technology & Applications International Forum, Albuquerque NM| month=Feb. 2-6}}</ref>. Because [[atmosphere of Venus|the thick carbon dioxide atmosphere]] is 50% denser than [[atmosphere of Earth|air]], breathable air (21:79 Oxygen-Nitrogen mixture) is a lifting gas in the dense Venusian atmosphere, with over 60% of the lifting power that [[helium]] has on Earth. In effect, a [[Gas balloon|balloon]] full of human-breathable air would sustain itself and extra weight (such as a colony) in midair. This means that any large structure filled with air would float on the [[carbon dioxide]], with the air's natural buoyancy counteracting the weight of the structure itself.<ref>{{cite web| last = Atkinson| first = Nancy| title = Colonizing Venus With Floating Cities| publisher = [[Universe Today]]| date = July 16, 2008| url = http://www.universetoday.com/2008/07/16/colonizing-venus-with-floating-cities/ | format =| accessdate = 2008-09-23 }}</ref> At an altitude of 50 km above the Venusian surface, the environment is the "most Earthlike in the solar system"<ref>Landis, quoted in Atkinson ''op. cit.''</ref>, with a [[pressure]] of approximately 1 bar and [[temperature]]s in the 0°C-50°C range<ref>{{Cite book| last = Seif| first = A.| editor-last = Hunten ''et al.'',| editor-first = D.

Because there is not a significant pressure difference between the inside and the outside of the breathable-air balloon, any rips or tears would cause gases to [[gaseous diffusion|diffuse]] at normal atmospheric mixing rates, giving time to repair any such damages. In addition, humans would not require [[pressurized suit]]s when outside, merely air to breathe and a protection from the acidic rain. Since such colonies would be viable in current Venusian conditions, this allows a dynamic approach to colonization instead of requiring extensive terraforming measures in advance. The main challenge would be using a substance resistant to [[sulfuric acid]] to serve as the structure's outer layer; [[ceramic]]s or metal [[sulfate]]s could possibly serve in this role. (The sulfuric acid itself may prove to be the main motivation for creating the structure in the first place, as the acid has proven to be extremely useful for many different purposes.) ==Other Planets== In addition to Venus, floating cities have been proposed in science fiction on several other planets. For example, floating cities might also permit settlement of the outer three [[gas giant]]s, as the gas giants lack solid surfaces. [[Jupiter]] is not promising for habitation due to its high [[gravity]], [[escape velocity]] and [[radiation]], but the [[solar system]]'s other gas giants ([[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]]) may be more practical. In 1978, the [[British Interplanetary Society]]'s [[Project Daedalus]] envisioned floating factories in the atmospheres of Jupiter refining [[Helium-3]] to produce fuel for an [[interstellar probe]]. [[Michael McCollum]] notes that the "surface" gravity of [[Saturn]] (that is, at the visible cloud layer, where the atmospheric pressure is about the same as Earth's) is very close to that of Earth, and in his novel [[The Clouds of Saturn]], he envisioned cities floating in the Saturnian atmosphere, where the buoyancy is provided by envelopes of [[hydrogen]] heated by [[fusion reactors]]. Uranus and Neptune also have "surface" gravities comparable to Earth's, and even lower escape velocities than Saturn. [[Cecelia Holland]] populated Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus with mutant humans, the Styth, in floating cities in her only SF novel, ''Floating Worlds'' (1975). ==Fictional examples== ===Literature=== *The novel ''[[Orion Shall Rise]]'' by [[Poul Anderson]] features an [[aerostat]] city called Skyholm, located above present-day [[France]]. *In the novel ''[[The Ringworld Engineers]]'', [[Louis Wu]] seeks a way to save the Ringworld by bartering for information in the library of a floating city. *Airhaven is a floating city in the ''[[Mortal Engines Quartet]]'', that, through attaching gas bags, lifted itself into the air to avoid cities trying to eat it according to [[Municipal Darwinism]]. *There are numerous floating habitats on the Venus-like planet [[Chilo]] in [[Tobias S. Buckell]]'s novel ''[[Sly Mongoose]]''. Buckell credits [[Geoffrey A. Landis]] with providing the background information on the floating cities.<ref>Buckell, Tobias, "The Big Idea: Tobias Buckell" interview in [http://scalzi.com/whatever/?p=1374 Whatever], Aug.
