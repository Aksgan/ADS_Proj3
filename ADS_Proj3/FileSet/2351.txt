Debugger|GDB]], with GUI support frequently using [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]]. JTAG adapters are sometimes sold along with support bundles. * ''Open Source'' tools exist. As noted above, GCC and GDB form the core of a good toolchain, and there are GUI environments to support them. The OpenOCD project supports [[GNU Debugger|GDB]] using a number of JTAG adapters, notably inexpensive USB ones, and currently works best{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} with ARM based systems. All such software tends to include basic debugger support: stopping, halting, single stepping, breakpoints, data structure browsing, and so on. Commercial tools tend to provide tools like very accurate simulators and trace analysis, which are not currently available as open source. == Serial Wire Debug == Serial Wire Debug is an 2-pin electrical alternative JTAG interface with the same JTAG protocol on top. Uses the existing GND connection. SWD uses an ARM CPU standard bi-directional wire protocol, defined in the ARM Debug Interface v5. This enables the debugger to become another AMBA bus master for access to system memory and peripheral or debug registers. Performance of {{nowrap|4 Mbytes/sec}} {{nowrap|@ 50 MHz}}. Has built in error detection. On JTAG devices with SWD capability the TMS and TCK are used as SWDIO and SWCLK signals. Allowing for dual mode programmers. STM32 CPU:s uses the [[Proprietary protocol|proprietary]] SWD. <!--101103--><ref name="arm-swd">http://www.arm.com/products/system-ip/debug-trace/coresight-soc-components/serial-wire-debug.php</ref> == See also == * AOI [[Automated optical inspection]] * AXI [[Automated x-ray inspection]] * ICT [[In-circuit test]] * Functional testing (see [[Acceptance testing]]) * [[Nexus (standard)|Nexus 5001]] * Non-JTAG hardware debug interfaces: ** [[Background Debug Mode interface]] ** [[Spy-Bi-Wire]] ** DebugWire on [[Atmel AVR]] * [[Open JTAG]] project == References == {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://focus.ti.com/lit/an/ssya002c/ssya002c.pdf IEEE Std 1149.1 (JTAG) Testability Primer] Includes a strong technical presentation about JTAG, with design-for-test chapters. * [http://www.corelis.com/education/JTAG_Tutorial.htm JTAG Tutorial and Boundary-Scan Applications] * [http://www.inaccessnetworks.com/ian/projects/ianjtag/jtag-intro/jtag-intro.html A Brief Introduction to the JTAG Boundary Scan Interface] * [http://www.corelis.com/education/Major-Benefits-of-IEEE-1149.7.htm Major Benefits of IEEE 1149.7] {{IEEE standards}} [[Category:IEEE standards]] [[Category:Electronics manufacturing]] [[Category:Embedded systems]] [[Category:Hardware testing]] [[cs:Joint Test Action Group]] [[de:Joint Test Action Group]] [[es:JTAG]] [[fr:Joint Test Action Group]] [[ko:JTAG]] [[it:JTAG]] [[nl:JTAG]] [[ja:JTAG]] [[pl:JTAG]] [[ru:JTAG]] [[sk:Joint Test Action Group]] [[fi:Joint Test Action Group]] [[sv:Joint Test Action Group]] [[zh:JTAG]]</text> </page> <page> <id>20125</id> <title>Jon Callas</title> <text>{{Infobox Person | image = Replace_this_image_male.svg<!-- Only freely-licensed images may be used to depict living people.
