MUSCL type left and right state linear-extrapolation.|200px|right|An example of MUSCL type left and right state linear-extrapolation.]] MUSCL based numerical schemes extend the idea of using a linear piecewise approximation to each cell by using ''slope limited'' left and right extrapolated states. This results in the following high resolution, TVD discretisation scheme, :<math>\frac{d u_i}{d t} + \frac{1}{\Delta x_i} \left[ F \left( u^*_{i + \frac{1}{2}} \right) - F \left( u^*_{i - \frac{1}{2}} \right) \right] =0 </math>. Which, alternatively, can be written in the more succinct form, :<math>\frac{d u_i}{d t} + \frac{1}{\Delta x_i} \left[ F^*_{i + \frac{1}{2}} - F^*_{i - \frac{1}{2}} \right] =0 </math>. The numerical fluxes <math>F^*_{i \pm \frac{1}{2}} </math> correspond to a nonlinear combination of first and second-order approximations to the continuous flux function. The symbols <math> u^*_{i + \frac{1}{2}} </math> and <math> u^*_{i - \frac{1}{2}} </math> represent scheme dependent functions (of the limited extrapolated cell edge variables), i.e. :<math> u^*_{i + \frac{1}{2}} = u^*_{i + \frac{1}{2}} \left( u^L_{i + \frac{1}{2}} , u^R_{i + \frac{1}{2}} \right), u^*_{i - \frac{1}{2}} = u^*_{i - \frac{1}{2}} \left( u^L_{i - \frac{1}{2}} , u^R_{i - \frac{1}{2}} \right) </math>, and :<math> u^L_{i + \frac{1}{2}} = u_{i} + 0.5 \phi \left( r_{i} \right) \left( u_{i+1} - u_{i} \right), u^R_{i + \frac{1}{2}} = u_{i+1} - 0.5 \phi \left( r_{i+1} \right) \left( u_{i+2} - u_{i+1} \right)</math>, :<math> u^L_{i - \frac{1}{2}} = u_{i-1} + 0.5 \phi \left( r_{i-1} \right) \left( u_{i} - u_{i-1} \right), u^R_{i - \frac{1}{2}} = u_{i} - 0.5 \phi \left( r_{i} \right) \left( u_{i+1} - u_{i} \right)</math>, :<math> r_{i} = \frac{u_{i} - u_{i-1}}{u_{i+1} - u_{i}}</math>. The function <math> {\phi \left( r_i \right)}\ </math> is a limiter function that limits the slope of the piecewise approximations to ensure the solution is TVD, thereby avoiding the spurious oscillations that would otherwise occur around discontinuities or shocks - see [[Flux limiter]] section. The limiter is equal to zero when <math>r \le 0 \ </math> and is equal to unity when <math>r = 1 \ </math>. Thus, the accuracy of a TVD discretization degrades to first order at local extrema, but tends to second order over smooth parts of the domain. The algorithm is straight forward to implement. Once a suitable scheme for <math>F^*_{i + \frac{1}{2}} \ </math> has been chosen, such as the ''Kurganov and Tadmor scheme'' (see below), the solution can proceed using standard numerical integration techniques. ==Kurganov and Tadmor central scheme== A precursor to the ''Kurganov and Tadmor'' (KT) ''central scheme'', (Kurganov and Tadmor, 2000), is the ''Nessyahu and Tadmor'' (NT) ''central scheme'', (Nessyahu and Tadmor, 1990). It is a Riemann-solver-free, second-order, [[high-resolution scheme]] that uses MUSCL reconstruction. It is a fully-discrete method that is straight forward to implement and can be used on [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] and [[vector (geometric)|vector]] problems , and can be viewed as a modification to the ''Lax-Friedrichs'' (LxF) ''scheme''. The algorithm is based upon [[finite difference|central differences]] with comparable performance to Riemann type solvers when used to obtain solutions for PDE's describing systems that exhibit high-gradient phenomena. The KT scheme extends the NT scheme and has a smaller amount of numerical viscosity than the original NT scheme. It also has the added advantage that it can be implemented as either a ''fully-discrete'' or ''semi-discrete'' scheme. Here we consider the semi-discrete scheme. The calculation is shown below: : <math>F^*_{i-\frac{1}{2}} =\frac{1}{2} \left\{ \left[ F \left(u^R_{i - \frac{1}{2}} \right) + F \left(u^L_{i - \frac{1}{2}} \right) \right] - a_{i - \frac{1}{2} } \left[u^R_{i - \frac{1}{2}} - u^L_{i - \frac{1}{2}} \right] \right\} </math>. : <math>F^*_{i+\frac{1}{2}} =\frac{1}{2} \left\{ \left[ F \left(u^R_{i + \frac{1}{2}} \right) + F \left(u^L_{i + \frac{1}{2}} \right) \right] - a_{i + \frac{1}{2} } \left[u^R_{i + \frac{1}{2}} - u^L_{i + \frac{1}{2}} \right] \right\} </math>.

Shows the analytical solution along with a simulation based upon the Kurganov and Tadmor central scheme with SuperBee limiter.]] Where the ''local propagation speed'', <math> a_{i \pm \frac{1}{2}} \ </math>, is the maximum absolute value of the eigenvalue of the Jacobian of <math> F \left( u \left(x, t \right) \right)</math> over cells <math>{i} , {i \pm 1}</math> given by : <math> a_{i \pm \frac{1}{2} } \left( t \right) = \max \left[ \rho \left( \frac{\partial F \left( u_{i} \left( t \right) \right)}{\partial u} \right) , \rho \left( \frac{\partial F \left( u_{i \pm 1} \left( t \right) \right)}{\partial u} \right) \right] </math>, where <math> \rho \ </math> represents the [[spectral radius]] of <math> \frac{\partial F \left( u \left( t \right) \right)}{ \partial u} </math>. Beyond these [[Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition|CFL]] related speeds, no characteristic information is required. The above flux calculation is sometimes referred to as ''local Lax-Friedrichs flux'' or ''Rusanov flux'' (Lax, 1954; Rusanov, 1961; Toro, 1999; Kurganov and Tadmor, 2000; Leveque, 2002). An example of the effectiveness of using a high resolution scheme is shown in the diagram opposite, which illustrates the 1D advective equation <math>u_t+u_x=0 \ </math>, with a step wave propagating to the right. The simulation was carried out on a mesh of 200 cells, using the Kurganov and Tadmor central scheme with [[flux limiter|Superbee limiter]] and used RK-4 for time integration. This simulation result contrasts extremely well against the above first-order upwind and second-order central difference results shown above. This scheme also provides good results when applied to sets of equations - see results below for this scheme applied to the Euler equations. However, care has to be taken in choosing an appropriate limiter because, for example, the Superbee limiter can cause unrealistic sharpening for some smooth waves. The scheme can readily include diffusion terms, if they are present. For example, if the above 1D scalar problem is extended to include a diffusion term, we get :<math>u_t + F_x\left(u \right) = Q_x \left( u , u_x \right) </math> , for which Kurganov and Tadmor propose the following central difference approximation, :<math>\frac{d u_i}{d t} = - \frac{1}{\Delta x_i} \left[ F^*_{i + \frac{1}{2}} - F^*_{i -
