It refers to a special type of object that represents the end of a [[data structure]]. Linked list data structures may use a sentinel object to indicate the end of a [[list (computing)|list]]. Similarly, a tree data structure can use a sentinel to indicate a [[node (computer science)|node]] without children. It is not always necessary to use a sentinel node; often [[null pointer|null]] is used instead. == Example == Below is an example of a sentinel node in a [[binary tree]] implementation:<ref>http://www.eternallyconfuzzled.com/tuts/datastructures/jsw_tut_andersson.aspx</ref> <source lang="c"> struct jsw_node { int data; int level; struct jsw_node *link[2]; }; struct jsw_node *nil; int jsw_init ( void ) { nil = malloc ( sizeof *nil ); if ( nil == NULL ) return 0; nil->level = 0; nil->link[0] = nil->link[1] = nil; return 1; } </source> As nodes that would normally link to NULL now link to "nil" (including nil itself), it removes the need for an expensive branch operation to check for NULL. NULL itself is known as a ''[[sentinel value]]'', a different approach to the same problem. Sentinel nodes are often used when implementing [[linked list]]s. ==References== <references/> {{Compu-prog-stub}} [[Category: Programming idioms]] [[Category:Linked lists]] [[Category:Trees (structure)]] [[pl:Wartownik]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33920</id> <title>Separable states</title> <text>In [[quantum mechanics]], '''separable quantum states''' are [[quantum state|states]] without [[quantum entanglement]]. == Separable pure states == For simplicity, the following assumes all relevant state spaces are finite dimensional. First, consider separability for [[pure state]]s. Let <math>H_1</math> and <math>H_2</math> be quantum mechanical state spaces, that is, finite dimensional [[Hilbert space]]s with basis states <math>\{|{a_i}\rangle\}_{i=1}^n</math> and <math>\{|{b_j}\rangle\}_{j=1}^m</math>, respectively. By a [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics#Mathematical structure of quantum mechanics|postulate of quantum mechanics]], the state space of the composite system is given by the [[tensor product]] :<math>H_1 \otimes H_2</math> with base states <math>\{|{a_i}\rangle\bigotimes |{b_j}\rangle\}</math>, or in more compact notation <math>\{|a_i b_j \rangle\}</math>. From the very definition of the tensor product, any vector of norm 1, i.e. a pure state of the composite system, can be written as : <math> |\psi\rangle = \Sigma_{i,j} c_{i,j} | a_i \rangle \otimes | b_j \rangle =\Sigma_{i,j} c_{i,j} | a_i b_j \rangle </math> If a pure state <math> |\psi\rangle \in H_1 \otimes H_2</math> can be written in the form <math>|\psi\rangle = |\psi_1\rangle \otimes |\psi_2\rangle </math> where <math>|\psi _i \rangle </math> is a pure state of the i-th subsystem, it is said to be ''separable''. Otherwise it is called ''entangled''. Formally, the embedding of a product of states into the product space is given by the [[Segre embedding]]. That is, a quantum-mechanical pure state is separable if and only if it is in the image of the Segre embedding. A standard example of an (un-normalized) entangled state is :<math> |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \in H \otimes H </math> where ''H'' is the Hilbert space of dimension 2. We see that when a system is in an entangled pure state, it is not possible to assign states to its subsystems. This will be true, in the appropriate sense, for the mixed state case as well. The above discussion can be extended to the case of when the state space is infinite dimensional with virtually nothing changed. ==Separability for mixed states== Consider the mixed state case. A mixed state of the composite system is described by a [[density matrix]] <math>\rho</math> acting on <math>H_1 \otimes H_2</math>. ρ is separable if there exist <math>p_k\geq 0</math>, <math>\{ \rho_1^k \}</math> and <math>\{ \rho_2^k \}</math> which are mixed states of the respective subsystems such that :<math> \rho=\sum_k p_k \rho_1^k \otimes \rho_2^k </math> where :<math>\; \sum_k p_k = 1. </math> Otherwise <math>\rho</math> is called an entangled state. We can assume without loss of generality in the above expression that <math>\{ \rho_1^k \}</math> and <math>\{ \rho_2^k \}</math> are all rank-1 projections, that is, they represent ''pure ensembles'' of the appropriate subsystems. It is clear from the definition that the family of separable states is a [[convex set]]. Notice that, again from the definition of the tensor product, any density matrix, indeed any matrix acting on the composite state space, can be trivially written in the desired form, if we drop the requirement that <math>\{ \rho_1^k \}</math> and <math>\{ \rho_2^k \}</math> are themselves states and <math>\; \sum_k p_k = 1.</math> If these requirements are satisfied, then we can interpret the total state as a probability distribution over uncorrelated [[product state]]s. In terms of [[quantum channel]]s, a separable state can be created from any other state using [[LOCC|local actions and classical communication]] while an entangled state cannot. When the state spaces are infinite dimensional, density matrices are replaced by positive [[trace class]] operators with trace 1, and a state is separable if it can be approximated, in trace norm, by states of the above form. If there is only a single non-zero <math>p_k</math>, then the state is called [[simply separable state|simply separable]] (or it is called a "product state"). == Extending to the multipartite case == The above discussion generalizes easily to the case of a quantum system consisting of more than two subsystems. Let a system have ''n'' subsystems and have state space <math>H = H_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes H_n</math>. A pure state <math>| \psi \rangle \in H</math> is separable if it takes the form :<math>| \psi \rangle = | \psi_1 \rangle \otimes \cdots \otimes | \psi_n \rangle .</math> Similarly, a mixed state ρ acting on ''H'' is separable if it is a convex sum :<math>\rho = \sum_k p_k \rho_1 ^k \otimes \cdots \rho_n ^k.</math>
