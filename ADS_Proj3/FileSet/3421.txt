the two different options on the two panes. When this change should occur, simply flip up this panel. '''d. Links Between Pages''' If your prototype needs to link between pages, simply create another prototyped page, and present it to the user when they "click" the link. ==Applying paper prototypes == The most important areas of application of paper prototypes are the following: ;Communication in the Team :One of the major applications of Paper Prototyping is brainstorming in the development team, to collect and visualise ideas on how an interface might look. The interface is built up step by step, meeting the expectations of all team members. To probe the applicability of the software design, typical use cases are played through and possible pitfalls are identified. The prototype can then be used as a visual specification of the software. ;Usability Testing :Paper prototypes can be used for [[usability testing]] with five to ten real users. In such a test, the user performs realistic tasks by interacting with the paper prototype. The prototype is manipulated by another person reflecting the software's reactions to the user input actions. Though seemingly unsophisticated, this method is very successful at discovering usability issues early in the design process. :Three techniques of paper prototyping used for usability testing are comps (short for compositions), wireframes, and storyboards. Comps are visual representations, commonly of websites, that demonstrate various aspects of the interface including fonts, colors, and logos. A wireframe is used to demonstrate the page layout of the interface. Lastly, the storyboards are a series or images that are used to demonstrate how an interface works<sup id="nbFoot01a" class="reference">[[#noteFoot01|[2]]]</sup>. These three techniques are useful and can be turned into paper prototypes. ;Design Testing :Especially in Web Design, paper prototypes can be used to probe the illegibility of a design: A high-fidelity design mockup of a page is printed and presented to a user. Among other relevant issues the user is asked to identify the main navigation, clickable elements, etc. Paper prototyping is also the recommended design testing technique in the [[contextual design]] process. ;Information Architecture :By applying general and wide paper prototypes, the information architecture of a software or web site can be tested. Users are asked where they would search for certain functionality or settings in software, or topics in a web site. According to the percentage of correct answers, the information architecture can be approved or further refined. ;Rapid Prototyping :Paper prototyping is often used as the first step of rapid prototyping. Rapid prototyping involves a group of about four designers who each create a paper prototype and test it on a single user. After this is done, the designers share their feedback and ideas, at which point, each of them creates a second prototype - this time using Microsoft PowerPoint or a similar computer application. Functionality is similarly unimportant, but in this case, the aesthetics are closer to the final product. Again each designer's computer prototype is tested on a single user, and the designers meet to share feedback. At this point, actual software prototypes can be created. Usually after these steps have been taken, the actual software is user-friendly the first time around, which saves valuable programming time. == See also == * [[Prototyping]] * [[Software Prototyping]] * [[User Centered Design]] * [[Cardboard engineering]] == External links == * [http://www.alistapart.com/articles/paperprototyping Paper Prototyping Article] * [http://web.me.com/vliolios/GroupM/Paper_Prototype.html Paper Prototyping Example Video] * [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrV2SZuRPv0 Hanmail Paper Prototype] - video of "high-intensity" prototyping for a web mail service * [http://garmahis.com/reviews/wireframe-tools/ List of helpful tools] for paper prototyping == References == *''<sup>[[#nbFoot01a|1]] </sup>''Sefelin, R., Tscheligi, M., & Gukker, V.

Alternatively, paraconsistent logic is the subfield of [[logic]] that is concerned with studying and developing paraconsistent (or “inconsistency-tolerant”) systems of logic. Inconsistency-tolerant logics have been discussed since at least 1910 (and arguably much earlier, for example in the writings of [[Aristotle]]); however, the term ''paraconsistent'' (“beside the consistent”) was not coined until 1976, by the [[Peru]]vian [[philosopher]] [[Francisco Miró Quesada]].<ref>Priest (2002), p. 288 and §3.3.</ref> ==Definition== In [[classical logic]] (as well as [[intuitionistic logic]] and most other logics), contradictions [[Entailment|entail]] everything. This curious feature, known as the [[principle of explosion]] or ''ex contradictione sequitur quodlibet'' ([[Latin]], “from a contradiction, anything follows”), can be expressed formally as {| border=1 align=center cellpadding=4 |- | <math>P \land\neg P</math> | Premise |- | <math>P\,</math> | conjunctive elimination |- | <math>P \lor A</math> | weakening |- | <math>\neg P\,</math> | conjunctive elimination |- | <math>A\,</math> | disjunctive syllogism |} Which means: if ''P'' and its negation ¬''P'' are both assumed to be true, then ''P'' is assumed to be true, from which it follows that at least one of the claims ''P'' and some other (arbitrary) claim ''A'' is true. However, if we know that either ''P'' or ''A'' is true, and also that ''P'' is not true (that ¬''P'' is true) we can conclude that ''A'', which could be anything, is true. Thus if a [[theory]] contains a single inconsistency, it is [[trivialism|trivial]]—that is, it has every sentence as a theorem. The characteristic or defining feature of a paraconsistent logic is that it rejects the principle of explosion. As a result, paraconsistent logics, unlike classical and other logics, can be used to formalize inconsistent but
