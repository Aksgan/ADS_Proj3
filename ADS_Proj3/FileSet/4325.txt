multidisciplinary approach of system analysis. [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] are the two postmodern thinkers who advocate systems theory approach in social sciences. == Main Concepts in Systems Theory == ==== Non-representational and non-referential ==== One of the central elements of the systems theory is to move away from the representational system to the non-representation of things. What it means that instead of imposing mental concepts, which reduce complexity of a materiality by limiting the variations or malleability, onto the objects; one should trace the network of things. According to Gregory Bateson, “ethos, eidos, sociology, economics, cultural structure, social structure, and all the rest of these words refer only to scientists’ ways of putting the jigsaw puzzle.”<ref>G. Bateson and R. E. Donaldson, ''A Sacred Unity: Further Steps to an Ecology of Mind'' (Cornelia & Michael Bessie Book, 1991), 50.</ref> The tracing rather than projecting mental images bring in sight material reality that has been obscured under the universalizing concepts. === Non-Cartesian === Since the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the Western philosophy has placed the individual, as an indispensable category, at the center of the universe. [[René Descartes]]' famous aphorism, 'I think therefore I am' proves that a person is a rational subject whose feature of thinking brings the human into existence. The Cartesian subject, therefore, is a scientific individual who imposes mental concepts on things in order to control the nature or simply what exists outside his mind. This subject-centered view of the universe has reduced the complex nature of the universe. One of the biggest challenges for system theory is thus to displace or de-center the Cartesian subject as a center of a universe and as a rational being. The idea is to make human beings not a supreme entity but rather to situate them as any other being in the universe. The humans are not thinking Cartesian subject but they dwell alongside nature. This brings back the human to its original place and introduces nature in the equation. The systems theory, therefore, encourages a non-unitary subject in opposition to a Cartesian subject. === Complexity === Once the Cartesian individual is dissolved, the social sciences will move away from a subject-centered view of the world. The challenge is then how to non-represent empirical reality without reducing the complexity of a system. To put it simply, instead of representing things by us let the things speak through us. These questions led materialists philosophers such as Deleuze and Guattari to develop a "science" for understanding reality without imposing our mental projections. The way they encourage is instead of throwing conceptual ideas we should do tracing. Tracing requires one to connect disparate assemblages or appendages not into a unified center but rather into a [[rhizome]] or an open system.<ref>Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus,</ref> === Open System and Closed System === Ludwig Bertalanaffy describes two types of systems: [[open system]] and [[closed system]]. The open systems are systems that allow interactions between its internal elements and the environment. An open system is defined as a “system in exchange of matter with its environment, presenting import and export, building-up and breaking-down of its material components.”<ref>L. Bertalanffy, General system theory (G. Braziller New York, 1988). 141.</ref> For example, living organism. Closed systems, on the other hand, are considered to be isolated from their environment. For instance, thermodynamics that applies to closed systems. == Tracing "Systems Theory" in Anthropology == === Marx-Weber Debates === Although the term 'system theory' is never mentioned in the work of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Max Weber]], the fundamental idea behind systems theory does penetrate deeply in to their understanding of social reality. One can easily see the challenges that both Marx and Weber faced in their work. Breaking away from Hegelian speculative philosophy, Marx developed a social theory based on historical materialism, arguing that is not consciousness that determines being, but in fact, it is social being that determines consciousness.<ref>Karl Marx. (1970[1946]). ''The German Ideology.'' Ed. C. J. Arthur. New York: International Publishers Co.</ref> More specifically, it is human beings’ social activity, labor, that causes, shapes, and informs human thinking. Based on labor, Marx develops his entire social theory that specifically questions reified, bourgeois capitalism. Labor, class conflict, commodity, value, surplus-value, bourgeoisie, and proletariat are thus central concepts in Marxian social theory. In contrast to the Cartesian "pure and rational subjectivity," Marx introduced social activity as the force that produces rationality. He was interested in finding sophisticated, scientific universal laws of society, though contrary to positivist mechanistic approach which take facts as given, and then develop causal relationship out of them. Max Weber found Marxist ideas useful, however, limited in explaining complex societal practices and activities. Drawing on [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutic]] tradition, Weber introduced multiple rationalities in the modern schema of thinking and used interpretive approach in understanding the meaning of a phenomenon placed in the webs of significance. Contrary to Marx, who was searching for the universal laws of the society, Weber attempts an interpretive understanding of social action in order to arrive at a “causal explanation of its course and effects.”<ref>Max Weber, Sociological Writing, 228.</ref> Here the word course signifies Weber’s non-deterministic approach to a phenomenon. The social actions have subjective meanings that should be understood in its given context. Weber’s interpretive approach in understanding the meaning of an action in relation to its environment delineated a contextualized social framework for cultural relativism. Since we exist in webs of significance and the objective analysis would detach us from a concrete reality which we are all part of it, Weber suggested ideal-types; an analytical and conceptual construct “formed by the accentuation of one or more points of view and by the synthesis of a great many diffuse, discrete, more or less present, and occasionally absent concrete individual phenomena, which are arranged according to those one-sidedly emphasized viewpoints into a unified analytical construct.”<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=o-g_H6BYMfcC&pg=PA211&lpg=PA211&dq=%22%22An+ideal+type+is+formed+by+the+one-sided+accentuation+of+one+or+more+points+of+view+and+by+the+synthesis+of+a+great+many+diffuse%22&source=bl&ots=Kjfe4P5i0m&sig=pN0vxF6dQqUy33ea7nICLUHzXc4&hl=en&ei=NGwuSpDtGI_cMN64yPgJ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9#PPA211,M1 ''The methodology of the social sciences''] (Edward A.
