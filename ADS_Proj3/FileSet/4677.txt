This is distinct from [[formal verification]], where the operation of a program is determined to be that which was intended, and that meets the purpose. The method is to check that data falls the appropriate parameters defined by the systems analyst. A judgement as to whether data is valid is made possible by the validation program, but it cannot ensure complete accuracy. This can only be achieved through the use of all the clerical and computer controls built into the system at the design stage. The difference between data validity and accuracy can be illustrated with a trivial example. A company has established a Personnel file and each record contains a field for the Job Grade. The permitted values are A, B, C, or D. An entry in a record may be valid and accepted by the system if it is one of these characters, but it may not be the correct grade for the individual worker concerned. Whether a grade is correct can only be established by clerical checks or by reference to other files. During systems design, therefore, data definitions are established which place limits on what constitutes valid data. Using these data definitions, a range of software validation checks can be carried out. ==Criteria== An example of a validation check is the procedure used to verify an [[ISBN]].<ref>[http://www.lac-bac.gc.ca/iso/tc46sc9/isbn.htm ''Frequently Asked Questions about the new ISBN standard''] [[ISO]]. </ref>'''ben Size. The number of characters in a data item value is checked; for example, an ISBN must consist of 10 characters only (in the previous version--the standard for 1997 and later has been changed to 13 characters.) Format checks. Data must conform to a specified format. Thus, the first 9 characters must be the digits 0 through 9' the 10th must be either those digits or an ''X'' Consistency. Codes in the data items which are related in some way can thus be checked for the consistency of their relationship. The first number of the ISBN designates the language of publication. for example, books published in French-speaking countries carry the digit "2". This must match the address of the publisher, as given elsewhere in the record. . Range. Does not apply to ISBN, but typically data must lie within maximum and minimum preset values. For example, customer account numbers may be restricted within the values 10000 to 20000, if this is the arbitrary range of the numbers used for the system. [[Check digit]]. An extra digit calculated on, for example, an account number, can be used as a self-checking device. When the number is input to the computer, the validation program carries out a calculation similar to that used to generate the check digit originally and thus checks its validity. This kind of check will highlight transcription errors where two or more digits have been transposed or put in the wrong order. The 10th character of the 10-character [[ISBN]] is the check digit. ==References== {{reflist}} *''Information integrity : a structure for its definition and management.'' Becker, Hal B.

The nodes in a value network represent people (or roles). The nodes are connected by interactions that represent [[tangible]] and [[intangible]] [[deliverable]]s. These deliverables take the form of [[knowledge]] or other [[intangibles]] and/or financial value. Value networks exhibit [[interdependence]]. They account for the overall worth of products and services. Companies have both internal and external value networks.<ref>Value Network Basics, openvaluenetworks.com</ref> ==External value networks== External facing networks include customers or recipients, intermediaries, [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], complementary, [[open innovation]] networks and suppliers. ==Internal value networks== Internal value networks focus on key activities, processes and relationships that cut across internal boundaries, such as order fulfillment, innovation, lead processing, or customer support. Value is created through [[Trade|exchange]] and the relationships between roles. Value networks operate in public agencies, [[civil society]], in the [[Company|enterprise]], [[institutional]] settings, and all forms of [[organization]]. Value networks advance innovation, [[wealth]], [[social good]] and [[Social environment|environmental]] well-being. ==Clayton Christensen's value networks== Christensen defines value network as: <blockquote> "The collection of upstream suppliers, downstream channels to market, and ancillary providers that support a common business model within an industry. When would-be disruptors enter into existing value networks, they must adapt their business models to conform to the value network and therefore fail that disruption because they become co-opted." <ref>Christensen, C.; ''The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary Book that Will Change the Way You Do Business'', Collins Business Essentials, page 296</ref> </blockquote> ==Fjeldstad and Stabells value networks== Fjeldstad and Stabell <ref>[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/2193/ABSTRACT abstract Stabell, Charles B., and Fjeldstad, Ã˜.] "Configuring value for competitive advantage: On chains, shops, and networks" ''Strategic Management Journal'' 19, 1998</ref> presents a framework for "value configurations" in which a "Value network" is one of two alternatives to Michael Porter's [[Value Chain]]s (the other being the [[Value shop]] configuration). F&S's value networks consists of these components: * A set of customers. * Some service the customers all use, and enables interaction between the customers. * Some organization that provides the service. * A set of contracts that enables access to the service. An obvious example of a value network is the network formed by phone users. The phone company provides a service, users enter a contract with the phone company and immediately has access to all the value network of other customers of the phone company.
