DirectX plugins allow the replacement of traditional recording studio hardware and rack units used in professional studios with software-based counterparts that can be connected together in a modular way. This allows host manufacturers to focus on the conviviality and efficiency of their products while specialized manufacturers can focus on the [[digital signal processing]] aspect. For example, there are plugins for effects boxes, such as [[Reverberation|reverbs]] and [[Delay (audio effect)|delays]], [[Effect pedal|effects pedals]], like [[Distortion (guitar)|guitar distortion]], [[Flange (electric guitar)|flange]] and [[Chorus effect|chorus]], and for mixing and mastering processors such as compressors, limiters, exciters, sub bass enhancers, stereo imagers and many more. == Overview == Similar to [[Virtual Studio Technology]] and later, [[Audio Units]] in Apple [[Mac OS X]], DirectX plugins have an open standard architecture for connecting audio synthesizers and effect plugins to audio editors and hard-disk recording systems. DirectX plug-ins are based on Microsoft's [[Component Object Model]] (COM) which allows plugins to be recognised and used by other applications via common interfaces. Plugins connect to applications and other plugins with pins via which they can pass and processes buffered streams of audio (or video) data. Architecturally, DirectX plugins are [[DirectShow]] filters. == Types and compatibility == DirectX plugins are also of two types, ''DirectX effect plugins (DX)'' and ''DirectX Instrument plugins (DXi)''. Effect plugins are used to generate, process, receive, or otherwise manipulate streams of audio. Instrument plugins are [[MIDI]] controllable DirectX plugins, generally used to synthesize sound or playback sampled audio using [[Software synthesizer|virtual synthesizers]], [[Software sampler|samplers]] or [[drum machines]]. DirectX effect plugins were developed by Microsoft as part of DirectShow. DirectX instruments were developed by [[Cakewalk (company)|Cakewalk]] in co-operation with Microsoft. DirectX plugins however are not cross-platform, and are available only on Windows. [[Virtual Studio Technology|VST]] plugins on the contrary are cross-platform. As a result, several ''wrapper'' plugins are available so that DirectX plugins can be used in applications which only support VST and vice versa. Others such as ''chainer'' plugins are also available which allow chaining multiple plugins together. == Programmability == DirectX plugins can be developed in C++ using Microsoft's [[DirectX]] SDK, Sony's Audio plugin development kit or Cakewalk's DirectX Wizard. There is also a [[Delphi]] SDK available [http://www.cloneensemble.com/ddx_sdk.htm here]. == DirectX plugin hosts == * [[REAPER]] * [[Cakewalk Sonar]] (version 2.0 or later) * [[ACID Pro]] (version 3.0 or later) * [[Sound Forge]] * [[Cool Edit]] 2000 and Cool Edit Pro 1.0, 2.0 (Now [[Adobe Audition]]) * [[Steinberg]] [[Wavelab]] * [[FL Studio]] * [[DAVID Systems GmbH]] [[Multitrack Editor V4]] * [[MAGIX Samplitude]] == Future == DirectX plugins are succeeded by [[DirectX Media Objects|DMO]]-based signal processing filters and more recently, by [[Media Foundation Transform]]s. == See also == * [[Virtual Studio Technology]], a similar standard by [[Steinberg]] * [[Computer music]] * [[MIDI]] * [[Digital audio workstation]] * [[DirectX Media Objects]] * [[Media Foundation Transform]] == External links == * [http://www.kvraudio.com/ All types of audio plugins, effects and instruments] * [http://www.hitsquad.com/smm/cat/PLUGINS_DX/ Hitsquad Musician Network: Collection of DirectX plugins] * [http://www.analogx.com/CONTENTS/download/audio.htm AnalogX DirectX plugins] * [http://www.sonymediasoftware.com/dl/dl.aspx?dwnid=26 Sony's Audio Plug-In Development Kit] {{DEFAULTSORT:Directx plugin}} [[Category:DirectX|Plugin {{PAGENAME}}]] [[Category:Music software plugin architectures]] [[Category:Microsoft application programming interfaces]]</text> </page> <page> <id>10568</id> <title>Direct Anonymous Attestation</title> <text>The '''Direct Anonymous Attestation''' (DAA) is a cryptographic protocol which enables the remote authentication of a trusted platform whilst preserving the user's privacy. The protocol has been adopted by the [[Trusted Computing Group]] (TCG) in the latest version of its [[Trusted Platform Module]] (TPM) specification<ref>[https://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/specs/TPM TPM Specification]</ref> as a result of privacy concerns (see also [[Trusted computing#Loss of anonymity|Loss of Internet anonymity]]). == Historical perspective == In principle the privacy issue could be resolved using any standard signature scheme (or [[Public-key cryptography|public key encryption]]) and a single key pair. Manufacturers would embed the private key into every TPM produced and the public key would be published as a certificate. Signatures produced by the TPM must have originated from the private key, by the nature of the technology, and since all TPMs use the same private key they are indistinguishable ensuring the user's privacy. This rather naive solution relies upon the assumption that there exists a ''global secret''. One only needs to look at the precedent of [[Content Scramble System]] (CSS), an encryption system for [[DVD]]s, to see that this assumption is fundamentally flawed. Furthermore this approach fails to realize a secondary goal: the ability to detect rogue TPMs. A rogue TPM is a TPM that has been compromised and had its secrets extracted. The solution first adopted by the TCG (TPM specification v1.1) required a trusted third-party, namely a ''privacy certificate agency'' (privacy CA). Each TPM has an embedded [[RSA]] key pair called an Endorsement Key (EK) which the privacy CA is assumed to know. In order to attest the TPM generates a second RSA key pair called an Attestation Identity Key (AIK). It sends AIK, signed by EK, to the privacy CA who checks its validity and issues a certificate for the AIK. The host/TPM is now able to authenticate itself with respect to the certificate. This approach permits two possibilities to detecting rogue TPMs: firstly the privacy CA
