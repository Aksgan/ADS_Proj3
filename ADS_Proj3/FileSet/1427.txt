Example: [[exponentiation]] (<math>z^q : \Bbb{Z} \times \Bbb{Q} \rightarrow \Bbb{C}</math> as in <math>{(-1)}^{1/2} = i</math>), ** Example: [[element (mathematics)|set membership]] (<math>(\in) : S \times \mathbf{Set} \rightarrow \Bbb{B}</math> where <math> \mathbf{Set} </math> is the [[category of sets]]) ** Examples: [[matrix multiplication]], the [[tensor product]], and the [[Cartesian product]] * <math>f : R \times R \rightarrow S</math> (internal binary function) ** Example: internal [[binary relations]] (<math>(\le) : R \times R \rightarrow \Bbb{B}</math>) ** Examples: the [[dot product]], the [[inner product space|inner product]], and [[metric (mathematics)|metrics]]. * <math>f : R \times S \rightarrow S</math> ([[Binary_operation#External_binary_operations|external binary operation]]) ** Examples: [[dynamical system]] [[flow (mathematics)|flows]], [[group action|group actions]], [[projection (set theory)|projection maps]], and [[scalar multiplication]]. * <math>f : S \times S \rightarrow S</math> ([[binary operation]]). ** Examples: [[addition]], [[multiplication]], [[permutation|permutations]], and the [[cross product]]. == External monoids == Since [[monoid]]s are defined in terms of [[binary operations]], we can define an ''external monoid'' in terms of ''external binary operations''. For the sake of simplicity, unless otherwise specified, a ''left'' external binary operation is implied. Using the term ''external'', we can make the generalizations: * An '''external [[magma (mathematics)|magma]]''' <math>(S, \times)</math> over ''R'' is a set ''S'' with an external binary operation. This satisfies <math>r \times s \in S</math> for all <math>s \in S, r \in R</math> (external [[closure (mathematics)|closure]]). * An '''external [[semigroup]]''' <math>(S, \times)</math> over <math>(R, \cdot)</math> is an external magma that satisfies <math>(r_1 \cdot r_2) \times s = r_1 \times (r_2 \times s)</math> for all <math>s \in S, r_1, r_2 \in R</math> (externally [[associative]]). * An '''external [[monoid]]''' <math>(S, \times)</math> over <math>(R, \cdot)</math> is an external semigroup in which there exists <math>1 \in R</math> such that <math>1 \times s = s</math> for all <math>s \in S</math> (has external [[identity element]]). == Modules as external rings == Much of the machinery of [[module (mathematics)|modules]] and [[vector spaces]] are fairly straightforward, or discussed above. The only thing not covered yet is their distribution axioms. The external ring multiplication <math>\otimes</math> is externally [[distributive]] in <math>(S, \oplus, \otimes)</math> over the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] <math>(R, +, \cdot)</math> [[iff]]: * <math>r \otimes (s_1 \oplus s_2) = (r \otimes s_1) \oplus (r \otimes s_2)</math> for all <math>s_1,s_2 \in S, r \in R</math> and: * <math>(r_1 + r_2) \otimes s = (r_1 \otimes s) \oplus (r_2 \otimes s)</math> for all <math>s \in S, r_1,r_2 \in R</math> Using these terminology we can make the following local generalizations: * An '''external semiring''' <math>(S, \oplus, \otimes)</math> over the [[semiring]] <math>(R, +, \cdot)</math> is a [[commutative]] [[monoid]] <math>(S, \oplus)</math> and an external monoid <math>(S, \otimes)</math> where <math>\otimes</math> is externally [[distributive]] in <math>(S, \oplus, \otimes)</math> over the [[semiring]] <math>(R, +, \cdot)</math>. * An '''external ring''' <math>(S, \oplus, \otimes)</math> over the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] <math>(R, +, \cdot)</math> is an [[Abelian group]] <math>(S, \oplus)</math> and an external monoid <math>(S, \otimes)</math> where <math>\otimes</math> is externally [[distributive]] in <math>(S, \oplus, \otimes)</math> over the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] <math>(R, +, \cdot)</math>. == Other examples == Now that we have all the terminology we need, we can make simple connections between various structures: * Complex exponentiation forms an external [[monoid]] <math>(\Bbb{C}, \uparrow)</math> over the [[Abelian group]] <math>(\Bbb{C}, \cdot)</math>. * Prime factorization forests form an external [[semiring]] <math>(\Bbb{N}, \cdot, \uparrow)</math> over the [[semiring]] <math>(\Bbb{N}, +, \cdot)</math>. * A [[dynamical system (definition)|dynamical system]] <math>(T, S, \Phi)</math> is an '''external monoid''' <math>(S, \Phi)</math> over the [[monoid]] <math>(T, {+})</math>. * A [[semimodule]] is an '''external semiring''' over a [[semiring]]. * A [[module (mathematics)|module]] is an '''external ring''' over a [[ring (mathematics)| ring]]. * A [[vector space]] is an '''external ring''' over a [[field (mathematics)| field]]. == Usefulness == It could be argued that we already have terms for the concepts described here, like [[dynamical systems]], [[group actions]], [[module (mathematics)|modules]], and [[vector spaces]]. However, there is still no other terminology available for an '''external monoid''' for which this terminology gives us a concise expression. Above all else, this is a reason this term should be of use in the mathematical community.

This is a type of cognitive load that instructional designers do have some ability to control (Chandler and Sweller, 1991). Extraneous cognitive load is often compared with [[intrinsic cognitive load]]. ==Examples of extraneous cognitive load== Sweller provides an [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyuOU2RasRQ example] of extraneous cognitive load in his 2006 book, when he describes the two possible ways to describe a square to a student (Clark, Nguyen, and Sweller, 2006). A square is a visual and should be described using a visual medium. Certainly an instructor can describe a square in a verbal medium, but it takes just a second and far less effort for a learner to ''see'' what the instructor is talking about when a learner is shown a square, rather than having one described verbally. In this instance, the efficiency of the visual medium is preferred, because it does not unduly load the learner with unnecessary information. This unnecessary cognitive load is described as extraneous cognitive load. ==Empirical evidence for extraneous cognitive load== [http://www.leaonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s1532690xci0804_2 Chandler and Sweller (1991)] introduced the concept of extraneous cognitive load. This article was written to report the results of six experiments that they conducted to investigate this working memory load. Many of these experiments involved materials demonstrating the [[split attention effect]]. They found that the format of instructional materials either promoted or limited learning. They proposed that differences in performance were due to
