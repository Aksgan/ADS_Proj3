to geotag photographs taken with the device. Subsequent generations (the iPhone 3GS and the iPhone 4) also support this feature. The first generation iPhone is not equipped with GPS, and uses a service provided by [[Skyhook_Wireless|Skyhook]] to triangulate and approximate the location at which the picture was taken using nearby cellular phone towers and [[WiFi]] hot-spot signal strength data. The Skyhook service provides approximate GPS location information which is then added to the Exif data associated with the picture. Also mobile phones with the [[Android_(operating_system)|Android]] operating system as well as [[BlackBerry]] smartphones with a camera and builtin GPS or Bluetooth GPS addons can geotag images with the included camera application. ==Program support== Exif data is embedded within the image file itself. While many recent [[Graphics software|image manipulation programs]] recognize and preserve Exif data when writing to a modified image, this is not the case for most older programs. Many image gallery programs also recognise Exif data and optionally display it alongside the images. Software libraries, such as libexif<ref>{{cite web | url=http://libexif.sourceforge.net/ | title=The libexif C EXIF for C | accessdate=2009-11-08 }}</ref> for C and Exiv2<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.exiv2.org/ | title=Exiv2 Image Metadata Library | publisher=Andreas Huggel | accessdate=2009-02-12}}</ref> for C++, or Image::ExifTool<ref>{{cite web | url=http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/ | title=Image::ExifTool Perl library | publisher=Phil Harvey | accessdate=2009-02-12}}</ref> for Perl, parse Exif data from files and read/write Exif tag values. ==Problems== Apart from not being a maintained standard, the Exif format has a number of drawbacks, mostly relating to its use of legacy file structures. * The derivation of Exif from the [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]] file structure using offset pointers in the files means that data can be spread anywhere within a file, which means that software is likely to corrupt any pointers or corresponding data that it doesn't decode/encode. For this reason most image editors damage or remove the Exif metadata to some extent upon saving.<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=TIFF Revision 6.0 | url=http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/tiff/TIFF6.pdf | publisher=Adobe | date=1992-06-03 | accessdate=2009-04-07}}</ref> * The standard defines a MakerNote tag, which allows camera manufacturers to place any custom format metadata in the file. This is used increasingly by camera manufacturers to store myriad camera settings not listed in the Exif standard, such as shooting modes, post-processing settings, serial number, focusing modes, etc. As this tag format is proprietary and manufacturer-specific, it can be prohibitively difficult to retrieve this information from an image (or properly preserve it when rewriting an image). Some manufacturers encrypt portions of the information; for example, Nikon encrypts the detailed lens data in their newer MakerNote data versions.<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Nikon Tags: Nikon LensData01 Tags | url=http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/TagNames/Nikon.html#LensData01 | publisher=Phil Harvey | date=2008-01-25 | accessdate=2008-01-28}}</ref> * The standard only allows [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]] or [[JPEG]] files — there is no provision for a "raw" file type which would be a direct data dump from the sensor device. This has caused camera manufacturers to invent many proprietary, incompatible "raw" file formats. To solve this problem, Adobe developed the [[Digital Negative (file format)|DNG]] format (a TIFF-based raw file format), in hopes that manufacturers would standardize on a single, raw file format. * The Exif standard specifically states that color depth is always 24 bits.<ref>(JEITA CP-3451) Section 4.4.3: Pixel Composition and Sampling</ref> However, many modern cameras, such as the [[Nikon D70]] which captures 36 bits of color per pixel, can capture significantly more. Since Exif/DCF files cannot represent this color depth, many manufacturers have developed proprietary, non-compatible [[Raw image format]]s. * Some digital cameras can also capture video. The Exif standard has no provision for video files. * Exif is very often used in images created by scanners, however the standard makes no provisions for any scanner-specific information. * Photo manipulation software sometimes fails to update the embedded thumbnail after an editing operation, possibly causing the user to inadvertently publish compromising information.<ref>{{cite web | author= Maximillian Dornseif | title=EXIF Thumbnail in JPEG images | url=http://blogs.23.nu/disLEXia/stories/5751 | publisher=disLEXia 3000 blog | date=2004-12-17 | accessdate=2008-01-28}}</ref> * Exif metadata is restricted in size to 64 kB in [[JPEG]] images because according to the specification this information must be contained within a single [[JPEG]] APP1 segment. Although the [[#FlashPix extensions|FlashPix extensions]] allow information to span multiple [[JPEG]] APP2 segments, these extensions are not commonly used. This has prompted some camera manufacturers to develop non-standard techniques for storing the large preview images used by some digital cameras for [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] review. These non-standard extensions are commonly lost if a user re-saves the image using image editor software, possibly rendering the image incompatible with the original camera that created it. * There is no way to record time-zone information along with the time, thus rendering the stored time ambiguous. * There is no field to record readouts of a camera's [[accelerometers]] or [[inertial navigation system]]. Such data could help to establish the relationship between the image sensor’s XYZ coordinate system and the gravity [[Euclidean vector|vector]] (i.e., which way is down in this image). It could also establish relative camera positions or orientations in a sequence of photos. * Since the Exif tag contains information about the photo, it can pose a privacy issue. For example, a photo taken with a GPS-enabled camera can reveal the exact location it was taken, which is undesirable in some situations. By removing the Exif tag with software such as [[ExifTool]] before publishing, the photographer can avoid possible problems. == Related standards == [http://www.metadataworkinggroup.org/ Metadata Working Group] was formed by a consortium of companies in 2006 (according to their web page) or 2007 (as stated in their own press release).
