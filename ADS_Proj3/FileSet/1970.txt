By definition, the hit-or-miss transform indicates the positions where a certain pattern (characterized by the composite structuring element ''B'') occurs in the input image. * '''[[Pruning (morphology)|Pruning]]'''. The hit-or-miss transform can be used to identify the end-points of a line to allow this line to be shrunk from each end to remove unwanted branches. * Computing the '''[[Euler number (topology)|Euler number]]'''. ==Bibliography== * ''An Introduction to Morphological Image Processing'' by Edward R.

The fourth and fifth HoHoCons were also sponsored by [[Phrack]] magazine and took place in [[Austin, Texas]]. [[Phreaking]] software [[BlueBEEP]] was released at HoHoCon '93.

Although conceived as three-dimensional by its originator, is usually shown as a two-dimensional array of hexagons in a triangular frame.]] The '''Holdridge life zones system''' is a global bioclimatic scheme for the classification of land areas. It was first published by [[Leslie Holdridge]] in 1947, and updated in 1967. It is a relatively simple system based on few empirical data, giving objective mapping criteria.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/publications/abstracts/archived/lugo.htm Western Ecology Division | US EPA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A basic assumption of the system is that both [[soil type|soil]] and [[climax vegetation]] can be mapped once climate is known.<ref>http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0004-0851%28197322%295%3A3%3CA187%3ACOTAOT%3E2.0.CO%3B2-4&size=LARGE&origin=JSTOR-enlargePage</ref> While it was first designed for tropical and subtropical area, the system applies globally. The system has been shown to fit [[tropical]] vegetation zones, [[Mediterranean]] zones, and [[boreal ecosystem|boreal]] zones, but is less applicable to cold oceanic or cold arid climates where moisture becomes the determining factor. The system has found a major use in assessing the possible changes in natural vegetation patterns due to [[global warming]].<ref>[http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/ecosys/cdroms/ged_iia/datasets/a06/reprints/lh1.htm]</ref> The three axis of the [[Barycentric subdivision]]s are: * [[precipitation]] (annual, logarithmic) * [[humidity]] provinces * [[potential evapotranspiration]] ratio (PET) to mean total annual precipitation. Further indicators incorporated into the system are: * [[biotemperature]] (mean annual, logarithmic) * [[Latitudinal|latitudinal regions]] * [[Altitudinal zonation|altitudinal belts]] Biotemperature is based on the growing season length and temperature. It is measured as the mean of refers to all temperatures above freezing, with all temperatures below freezing adjusted to 0 °C, as plants are dormant at these temperatures. Holdridge's system uses biotemperature first, rather than the temperate latitude bias of [[Clinton Hart Merriam|Merriam]]'s life zones, and does not primarily consider elevation. The system is considered more appropriate to the complexities of tropical vegetation than Merriam's system. == Classes == The classes defined within the system, as used by [[IIASA]], are: # [[Polar desert]] # [[Subpolar]] dry [[tundra]] # Subpolar moist tundra # Subpolar wet tundra # Subpolar rain tundra # Boreal [[desert]] # Boreal dry [[Scrubland|scrub]] # Boreal moist [[forest]] # Boreal wet forest # Boreal rain forest # [[Cool temperate]] desert # Cool temperate [[desert scrub]] # Cool temperate [[steppe]] # Cool temperate moist forest # Cool temperate wet forest # Cool temperate rain forest # [[Warm temperate]] desert # Warm temperate desert scrub # Warm temperate thorn scrub # Warm temperate dry forest # Warm temperate moist forest # Warm temperate wet forest # Warm temperate rain forest # [[Subtropical]] desert # Subtropical desert scrub # Subtropical thorn woodland # Subtropical dry forest # Subtropical moist forest # Subtropical wet forest # [[Subtropical rain forest]] # [[Tropical]] desert # Tropical desert scrub # Tropical thorn woodland # Tropical very dry forest # Tropical dry forest # Tropical moist forest # Tropical wet forest # [[Tropical rain forest]] ==See also== *[[Andrew Delmar Hopkins]] *[[Biome]] *[[Ecoregion]] *[[Holdridge life zones in Guatemala]] *[[Köppen climate classification]] *[[Life zone]] == References == {{Reflist}} [[Category:Ecozones]] [[Category:Sustainable building]] [[Category:Classification systems]] [[Category:Climate]] [[ca:Sistema de classificació de zones de vida de Holdridge]] [[es:Sistema de clasificación de zonas de vida de Holdridge]] [[fi:Holdridgen elämänvyöhykeluokitus]]</text> </page> <page> <id>16861</id> <title>Hollywood (graphics chip)</title> <text>[[Image:Hollywood gpu.png|thumb|right|150px|ATI "Hollywood" GPU within the Wii console]] '''Hollywood''' is the name of the [[GPU|Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)]] used in [[Nintendo|Nintendo's]] [[Wii]] [[video game console]].
