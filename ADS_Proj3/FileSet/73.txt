The solution is based on the [[Semantic technology|semantic technologies]] as enhanced [[WSMO|WSMO conceptual framework]], [[Web Services Modeling Language|WSML]] [[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]], semantic [[annotation]] of services, their [[Web Services Discovery|discovery]], [[Service_Oriented_Programming#Service_Implementation:_Composite_Service|composition]], [[Data mediation|mediation]], and executing in the [[Service-oriented architecture|SOA]] environment.

The interoperability was recognised as a precondition for the implementation of European eGovernment services in the ''eEurope Action Plan 2005'' <ref>eEurope Action Plan 2005 http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/eeurope/2005/all_about/action_plan/index_en.htm</ref> and is explicitly addressed as one of the four main challenges in the [[I2010|I2010 EU strategy]]. It is recommended to build the solutions supporting interoperability of governmental services on standards, open specifications and open interfaces <ref>Commission of the European Communities, Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament: Interoperability for Pan-European eGovernment Services. Brussels, 13.2.2006. http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/servlets/Doc?id=24117</ref>. From the three aspects of [[interoperability]] (i.e. ''organisational'', ''semantic'', and ''technical'' <ref>Commission of the European Communities, Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament: Interoperability for Pan-European eGovernment Services. Brussels, 13.2.2006. Page 6. http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/servlets/Doc?id=24117</ref>), the Access-eGov project is particularly focused on the semantic interoperability. The central idea is to ensure that the meaning of the shared and exchanged information is captured, formalised, and is understood in the same way by the people, applications, and institutions involved in the eGovernment solution. It can be achieved by enriching the provided governmental services and other information resources with
