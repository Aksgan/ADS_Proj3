they arise, as well as defining how to deal with them, has traditionally been problematic. In solving problems relating to ethical issues, [[Michael Davis (philosopher)|Michael Davis]] proposed a unique problem-solving method. In Davis's model, the ethical problem is stated, facts are checked, and a list of options is generated by considering relevant factors relating to the problem. The actual action taken is influenced by specific ethical standards. ==Some questions in computer ethics== {{Inappropriate tone|date=April 2009}} There are a number of computers based [[ethical dilemma]] that are frequently discussed. One set of issues deals with some of the new [[ethical dilemma]] that have emerged, or taken on new form, with the rise of the [[Internet]] and [[Social Networking]]. There are now many ways to gain information about others that were not available, or easily available, before the rise of [[computers]]. Thus ethical issues about [[storage]] of [[personal information]] are now becoming an ever increasing problem. With more storage of personal data for [[social networking]] arises the problem of selling that information for monetary gain. This gives rise to different ethical situations regarding access, security, and the use of hacking in positive and negative situations. Situations regarding the [[copyright infringement of software]] , music, movies, are widely becoming discussed, with the rise of file sharing programs such as [[Napster]] , [[Kazaa]] , and the [[BitTorrent (protocol)]] . The ethical questions that arise from [[software piracy]] are : is it immoral or wrong to copy software, music, or movies? The use of [[Internet]] as a tool for abuse; spreading [[child porn]], harassment of others, and other challenges as a result of kids use of this media for both consumption and producing. A second set of questions pertaining to the [[Internet]] and the societal influence that are becoming more widely discussed are questions relating to the values that some may wish to promote via the [[Internet]]. Some have claimed that the [[Internet]] is a "democratic technology”. Does the [[Internet]] foster [[democracy]] and freedom of speech? What are the ethical implications of this process on the world? Does the [[digital divide]] raise ethical issues that society is morally obligated to change and spread the ability to access different forms of [[electronic communication]]? ==Ethical standards== Various national and international professional societies have produced code of ethics documents to give basic parameters for computing professionals. They include: * [[Association for Computing Machinery]]<ref>[http://www.acm.org/constitution/code.html ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct]</ref> * [[British Computer Society]]<ref>[http://www.bcs.org/server.php?show=conWebDoc.1587 BCS Code of Conduct & Code of Good Practice]</ref> * [[Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act]]<ref>[http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/ulc/ucita/ucita200.htm Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act]</ref> * [[IEEE]]<ref>[http://www.ieee.org/membership_services/membership/ethics_code.html IEEE Code of Ethics]</ref> ==References== <references/> ==Bibliography== * [http://www.southernct.edu/organizations/rccs/staff.html Bynum, Terrell Ward.] "The Foundation of Computer Ethics," ''Computers and Society,'' June 2000. * Stephen Haag, Maeve Cummings and Donald J.

This simulation can either be extremely accurate, as is the case in an [[Application software|application]] like ''[[Radiance]]'' which attempts to track the energy flow of light interacting with materials using [[radiosity]] computational techniques. Alternatively, the simulation can simply be inspired by [[light physics]], as is the case with [[non-photorealistic rendering]]. In both cases, a [[shading model]] is used to describe how surfaces respond to light. Between these two extremes, there are many different [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] approaches which can be employed to achieve almost any desired visual result. '''Computer graphics lighting''' can also refer to the [[employment|job]] of [[lighting]] in [[computer animation]]. A computer graphics lighter will employ many of the same methods a [[live-action]] [[lighting designer]] or [[gaffer (motion picture industry)|gaffer]] might employ. However, the computer graphics lighter will work within a computer graphics application. ==See also== *[[Shader]] *[[List of common shading algorithms]] *[[Deferred shading]] *[[High dynamic range rendering]] ==References== {{refs}} ==External links== {{Unreferenced stub|auto=yes|date=December 2009}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Computer Graphics Lighting}} [[Category:3D computer graphics]] [[Category:Computer graphics]] [[Category:Lighting]] [[Category:Shading| ]] {{Compu-graphics-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>7555</id> <title>Computer insecurity</title> <text>{{About|computer security exploits and defenses|computer security through design and engineering|computer security}} {{multiple issues|citations missing=December 2009|cleanup=December 2008|essay=December 2007}} {{Computer security}} Many current [[computer system]]s have only limited security precautions in place.
