The [[ancient Chinese]] astronomer [[Shi Shen]] (fl. fourth century BC) was aware of the relation of the moon in a solar eclipse, as he provided instructions in his writing to predict them by using the relative positions of the moon and sun.<ref name="needham volume 3 411">Needham, Volume 3, 411.</ref> The 'radiating influence' theory for a solar eclipse (i.e., the moon's light was merely light reflected from the sun) was existent in Chinese thought from about the sixth century BC (in the ''Zhi Ran'' of Zhi Ni Zi),<ref name="needham volume 3 227"/> and opposed by the [[Chinese philosopher]] [[Wang Chong]] (AD 27–97), who made clear in his writing that this theory was nothing new.<ref name="needham volume 3 411-413">Needham, Volume 3, 411–413.</ref> This can be said of Jing Fang's writing in the 1st century BC, which stated: {{Quotation|The moon and the planets are [[Yin and yang|Yin]]; they have shape but no light. This they receive only when the sun illuminates them. The former masters regarded the sun as round like a [[crossbow]] bullet, and they thought the moon had the nature of a mirror. Some of them recognized the moon as a ball too. Those parts of the moon which the sun illuminates look bright, those parts which it does not, remain dark.<ref name="needham volume 3 227">Needham, Volume 3, 227.</ref>}} The ancient Greeks had known this as well, since it was [[Parmenides]] of [[Elea]], around 475 BC, who supported the theory of the moon shining because of reflected light, and was accepted in the time of [[Aristotle]] as well.<ref name="needham volume 3 227"/> The Chinese astronomer and inventor [[Zhang Heng]] (AD 78–139) wrote of both solar and [[lunar eclipse]]s in the publication of ''Ling Xian'' in AD 120, supporting the radiating influence theory that Wang Chong had opposed ([[Wade-Giles]]): {{Quotation|The sun is like fire and the moon like water. The fire gives out light and the water reflects it. Thus the moon's brightness is produced from the radiance of the sun, and the moon's darkness (pho) is due to (the light of) the sun being obstructed (pi). The side which faces the sun is fully lit, and the side which is away from it is dark. The planets (as well as the moon) have the nature of water and reflect light. The light pouring forth from the sun (tang jih chih chhung kuang) does not always reach the moon owing to the obstruction (pi) of the earth itself—this is called 'an-hsü', a '''[[lunar eclipse]]'''. When (a similar effect) happens with a planet (we call it) an occultation (hsing wei); when the moon passes across (kuo)(the sun's path) then there is a '''solar eclipse''' (shih).<ref name="needham volume 3 414">Needham, Volume 3, 414.</ref>}} The later Chinese scientist and statesman [[Shen Kuo]] (AD 1031–1095) also wrote of eclipses, and his reasoning for why the celestial bodies were round and spherical instead of flat ([[Wade-Giles]] spelling): {{Quotation|The Director [of the Astronomical Observatory] asked me about the shapes of the sun and moon; whether they were like balls or (flat) fans. If they were like balls they would surely obstruct (ai) each other when they met. I replied that these celestial bodies were certainly like balls. How do we know this? By the waxing and waning (ying khuei) of the moon. The moon itself gives forth no light, but is like a ball of silver; the light is the light of the sun (reflected). When the brightness is first seen, the sun(-light passes almost) alongside, so the side only is illuminated and looks like a crescent. When the sun gradually gets further away, the light shines slanting, and the moon is full, round like a bullet. If half of a sphere is covered with (white) powder and looked at from the side, the covered part will look like a crescent; if looked at from the front, it will appear round. Thus we know that the celestial bodies are spherical...Since the sun and moon are in conjunction (ho) and in opposition (tui) once a day, why then do they have eclipses only occasionally?' I answered that the ecliptic and the moon's path are like two rings, lying one over the other (hsiang tieh), but distant by a small amount. (If this obliquity did not exist), the sun would be eclipsed whenever the two bodies were in conjunction, and the moon would be eclipsed whenever they were exactly in position. But (in fact) though they may occupy the same degree, the two paths are not (always) near (each other), and so naturally the bodies do not (intrude) upon one another.<ref name="needham volume 3 415 416">Needham, Volume 3, 415–416.</ref>}} Eclipses have been interpreted as omens, or portents, especially when associated with battles. On [[Solar eclipse of January 22, 1879|22 January 1879]] a British battalion was massacred by Zulu warriors during the Zulu War in South Africa. At 2:29 PM there was a solar eclipse.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Battle of Isandlwana — The Zulu War |url=http://www.britishbattles.com/zulu-war/isandlwana.htm}}</ref> The conflict was named the [[Battle of Isandlwana]], the Zulu name for the battle translates as "the day of the dead moon".<ref>{{cite audio |people=Rattray, David (author) |title=The Day of the Dead Moon (The Story of the Anglo-Zulu War 1879) |format=audio |medium=CD |publisher=GTV |date=1997 |asin=B0010JC3ZU }}</ref> ==Viewing== <div class="center"><div style="background:black;"> [[Image:Solar eclips 1999 1.jpg|150px]] [[Image:Solar eclips 1999 2.jpg|150px]] [[Image:Solar eclips 1999 3.jpg|150px]] [[File:Solar eclips 1999 4 NR.jpg|145px]] [[Image:Solar eclips 1999 5.jpg|150px]] [[Image:Solar eclips 1999 6.jpg|150px]] [[Image:Solar eclips 1999 7.jpg|150px]] [[Image:Eclipse movie.gif|150px]] </div></div> [[File:Solar eclipse in Turkey March 2006.jpg|thumb|250px|The Pinhole Projection Method of observing partial Solar Eclipse.
