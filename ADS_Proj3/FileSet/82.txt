Following in the footsteps of Cybermotion and MDARS-I, the company developed [[security robots]], but with more powerful computers and new autonomous techniques such as SLAM, Monte Carlo/Markov localization and modified value-iterated search path planning to create a new generation of [[autonomous robots]] for delivery and security purposes in hospitals, offices, labs and other buildings.<ref>* [http://search2.foxnews.com/search?access=p&getfields=*&sort=date%3AD%3AS%3Ad1&output=xml_no_dtd&ie=UTF-8&client=my_frontend&filter=0&site=video&proxystylesheet=my_frontend&q= Company Leads the Way in Robot Innovation, 2007-12-12 FOX News video]</ref> MobileRobots has also been a pioneer in flexible intelligent AGV applications, designing the Motivity control system used by [http://www.rmtrobotics.com RMT Robotics] to develop its ADAM iAGV (Self-Guided Vehicle), used for complex pick-n-place operations, in conjunction with gantry systems and [[industrial robot]] arms, used in first-tier auto supply factories to move products from process to process in non-linear layouts. Smaller versions also work in semi-conductor plant clean rooms, carrying product from workstation to workstation. In 2007, the company released a unique omni-directional Seekur security rover. The omni-directional wheels let it drive sideways as well as forwards and back, to perform in tight spaces. In early 2008, Seekur demonstrated autonomous navigation in GPS-blocked spaces around buildings. In 2009, the company expanded the capabilities of its Motivity robot autonomy to enable fleets to behave more like people, following site-specific traffic rules and varying its speech and other aspects of its "personality" in ways appropriate to its workplace.
