The name comes from the way that a pencil could naturally be drawn along these corners. It's sometimes called a rolling ball toolpath. Often a [[constant step-over passes]] are derived from single pencil pass to create parallel pencil passes that are very good for cleaining up corners and fillets where excess material remains from a bigger cutter. == Generating pencil toolpaths == There are several alternative algorithms for generating pencil passes. The method most commonly published in the academic literature involves creating tool surface offsets of the model surfaces and intersecting them to find the common line where the cutter would be in contact with two surfaces at once. An example of this implementation uses the [[ZMap]] method described by Park, et al.<ref>{{cite|author=Park JW, Chung YC, Kim BH, Choi BK|title=Pencil curve tracing via virtual digitizing. Mach Impossible Shapes|date=1999|page=279–92|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers}}</ref> The industrial method, used in commercial CAM software, differs substantially and works by detecting double-contact points and linking them up into a chain to form a toolpath.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} A double-contact point is a pair of cutter locations displaced by a tiny distance horizontally, but with a large difference in height or sudden change in contact point. These positions can be located very precisely by binary subdivision, where a cutter location created between a pair of close cutter locations will almost always be continuous with one or other side? == References == {{reflist}} [[Category:Machining]] [[Category:Computer-aided engineering]]</text> </page> <page> <id>28765</id> <title>Penrose diagram</title> <text>{{For|the tensor diagram notation|Penrose graphical notation}} In [[theoretical physics]], a '''Penrose diagram''' (named for mathematical physicist [[Roger Penrose]]) is a [[two-dimensional]] [[diagram]] that captures the [[causal relation]]s between different points in [[spacetime]]. It is an extension of a [[Minkowski diagram]] where the vertical dimension represents [[time]], and the [[Horizontal plane|horizontal]] dimension represents [[space]], and slanted lines at an angle of 45° correspond to light rays. The biggest difference is that locally, the [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] on a Penrose diagram is [[conformal equivalence|conformally equivalent]] to the actual metric in spacetime. The conformal factor is chosen such that the entire infinite spacetime is transformed into a Penrose diagram of finite size. For [[spherically symmetric spacetime]]s, every point in the diagram corresponds to a 2-sphere. ==Basic properties== While Penrose diagrams share the same basic [[coordinate vector]] system of other space-time diagrams for local [[asymptotically flat spacetime]], it introduces a system of representing distant spacetime by shrinking or "crunching" distances that are further away. Straight lines of constant time and space coordinates therefore become [[hyperbola]]s, which appear to converge at [[Point (geometry)|point]]s in the corners of the diagram. These points represent '''"conformal infinity"''' for space and time. Penrose diagrams are more properly (but less frequently) called '''Penrose-Carter diagrams''' (or '''Carter-Penrose diagrams'''), acknowledging both [[Brandon Carter]] and [[Roger Penrose]], who were the first researchers to employ them. They are also called conformal diagrams, or simply spacetime diagrams. [[Image:Penrose.PNG|right|thumb|Penrose diagram of an infinite [[Minkowski]] universe, horizontal axis ''u'', vertical axis ''v'']] Two lines drawn at 45° angles should intersect in the diagram only if the corresponding two light rays intersect in the actual spacetime. So, a Penrose diagram can be used as a concise illustration of spacetime regions that are accessible to observation. The [[diagonal]] boundary lines of a Penrose diagram correspond to the "infinity" or to singularities where light rays must end. Thus, Penrose diagrams are also useful in the study of asymptotic properties of spacetimes and singularities. An infinite static [[Minkowski space|Minkowski universe]], coordinates <math>(x, t)</math> is related to Penrose coordinates <math>(u, v)</math> by: :<math>\tan(u \pm v) = x \pm t</math> The corners of the Penrose diamond, which represent the spacelike and timelike conformal infinities, are <math>\pi /2</math> from the origin. ==Black holes== Penrose diagrams are frequently used to illustrate the space-time environment of black holes. Singularities are denoted by a spacelike boundary, unlike the timelike boundary found on conventional space-time diagrams. This is due to the interchanging of timelike and spacelike coordinates within the horizon of a black hole (since space is uni-directional within the horizon, just as time is uni-directional outside the horizon). The singularity is represented by a spacelike boundary to make it clear that once an object has passed the horizon it will inevitably hit the singularity even if it attempts to take evasive action. Penrose diagrams are also used to illustrate the space-time environment of a hypothetical [[wormhole]] connecting two separate universes, which is an extension of the [[Schwarzschild solution]] of [[black hole]]s. The [[wiktionary:Precursor|precursor]]s to the Penrose diagrams were [[Kruskal]]-[[Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates|Szekeres]] diagrams. These introduced the method of aligning the [[event horizon]] into past and future horizons oriented at 45° angles (since one would need to travel [[faster than light]] to cross from the [[Schwarzschild radius]] back into flat spacetime); and splitting the [[Mathematical singularity|singularity]] into past and future horizontally-oriented lines (since the singularity "cuts off" all paths into the future once one enters the hole). The result is a hypothetical object called a '''grey hole''', which is basically a [[white hole]] that turns into a [[black hole]] after briefly opening up into a wormhole connecting the two asymptotically flat space-time regions called "universes". The wormhole closes off (forming "future" singularities) so rapidly that passage between the two universes would require faster-than-light velocity, and is therefore impossible.
