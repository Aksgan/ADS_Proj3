This is an optimization programme. It can be thought of as an extension or generalisation of [[linear programming]] to handle multiple, normally conflicting objective measures. Each of these measures is given a goal or target value to be achieved. Unwanted deviations from this set of target values are then minimised in an achievement function. This can be a vector or a weighted sum dependent on the goal programming variant used. As satisfaction of the target is deemed to satisfy the decision maker(s), an underlying [[satisficing]] philosophy is assumed. == History == Goal programming was first used by Charnes, Cooper and Ferguson in 1955,<ref>A Charnes, WW Cooper, R Ferguson (1955) Optimal estimation of executive compensation by linear programming, Management Science, 1, 138-151.</ref> although the actual name first appear in a 1961 text by Charnes and Cooper.<ref>A Charnes, WW Cooper (1961) Management models and industrial applications of linear programming, Wiley, New York</ref> Seminal works by Lee,<ref>SM Lee (1972) Goal programming for decision analysis, Auerback, Philadelphia</ref> Ignizio,<ref name= "IG">JP Ignizio (1976) Goal programming and extensions, Lexington Books, Lexington, MA.</ref> Ignizio and Cavalier,<ref>JP Ignizio, TM Cavalier (1994) Linear programming, Prentice Hall.</ref> and Romero<ref name= "Rom">C Romero (1991) Handbook of critical issues in goal programming, Pergamon Press, Oxford.</ref> followed. Schniederjans gives in a bibliography of a large number of pre-1995 articles relating to goal programming,<ref>MJ Scniederjans (1995) Goal programming methodology and applications, Kluwer publishers, Boston.</ref> and Jones and Tamiz give an annotated bibliography of the period 1990-2000.<ref name= "DFJ">DF Jones, M Tamiz (2002) Goal programming in the period 1990-2000, in Multiple Criteria Optimization: State of the art annotated bibliographic surveys, M. Ehrgott and X.Gandibleux (Eds.), 129-170. Kluwer</ref> A recent textbook by Jones and Tamiz .<ref name="JT">Jones DF, Tamiz M (2010) Practical Goal Programming, Springer Books.</ref> gives a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in goal programming. The first engineering application of goal programming, due to Ignizio in 1962, was the design and placement of the antennas employed on the second stage of the [[Saturn V]]. This was used to launch the Apollo space capsule that landed the first men on the moon. == Variants == The initial goal programming formulations ordered the unwanted deviations into a number of priority levels, with the minimisation of a deviation in a higher priority level being infinitely more important than any deviations in lower priority levels. This is known as ''[[lexicographic]]'' or pre-emptive goal programming. Ignizio<ref name= "IG"/> gives an algorithm showing how a lexicographic goal programme can be solved as a series of linear programmes. Lexicographic goal programming should be used when there exists a clear priority ordering amongst the goals to be achieved. If the decision maker is more interested in direct comparisons of the objectives then ''Weighted'' or non pre-emptive goal programming should be used. In this case all the unwanted deviations are multiplied by weights, reflecting their relative importance, and added together as a single sum to form the achievement function. It is important to recognise that deviations measured in different units cannot be summed directly due to the phenomenon of [[incommensurability]]. Hence each unwanted deviation is multiplied by a normalisation constant to allow direct comparison. Popular choices for normalisation constants are the goal target value of the corresponding objective (hence turning all deviations into percentages) or the range of the corresponding objective (between the best and the worst possible values, hence mapping all deviations onto a zero-one range).<ref name= "Rom"/> For decision makers more interested in obtaining a balance between the competing objectives, ''Chebyshev'' goal programming should be used. Introduced by Flavell in 1976,<ref>RB Flavell (1976) A new goal programming formulation, Omega, 4, 731-732.</ref> this variant seeks to minimise the maximum unwanted deviation, rather than the sum of deviations. This utilises the [[Chebyshev distance]] metric, which emphasizes justice and balance rather than ruthless optimisation. == Strengths and weaknesses == A major strength of goal programming is its simplicity and ease of use. This accounts for the large number
