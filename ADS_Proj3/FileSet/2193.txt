The definition of cooperative systems in road traffic is according to the [[European Commission]]:<ref>3rd eSafety Forum, 25 March 2004</ref> :"Road operators, infrastructure, vehicles, their drivers and other road users will cooperate to deliver the most efficient, safe, secure and comfortable journey.

IWM enables the management and optimization of computing resources in a secure and compliant manner across physical, virtual and cloud environments to deliver business services for end customers. The IWM paradigm builds on the traditional concept of [[Workload Manager|workload management]] whereby processing resources are dynamically assigned to tasks, or "workloads," based on criteria such as [[business process]] priorities (for example, in balancing business intelligence queries against online transaction processing<ref>{{cite news|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1325976|title=Dynamic workload management for very large data warehouses: juggling feathers and bowling balls|publisher=VLDB Endowment|date=2007|accessdate=2008-11-12}}</ref>), resource availability, security protocols, or event scheduling, but extends the concept into the structure of individual workloads themselves. ==Definition of Workload== In the context of IT systems and [[data center]] management, a "workload" can be broadly defined as "the total requests made by users and applications of a system." <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.databasejournal.com/features/oracle/article.php/3794731/What-Is-Your-Definition-of-Database-Workload.htm|title=What Is Your Definition of Database Workload?|publisher=Database Journal|date=January 8, 2009|accessdate=2009-11-15}}</ref> However, it is also possible to break down the entire workload of a given system into sets of self-contained units. Such a self-contained unit constitutes a "workload" in the narrow sense: an integrated stack consisting of [[application software|application]], [[middleware]], [[database]], and [[operating system]] devoted to a specific computing task. Typically, a workload is "platform agnostic," meaning that it can run in physical, virtual or cloud computing environments. Finally, a collection of related workloads which allow end users to complete a specific set of business tasks can be defined as a "business service."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.communities.hp.com/online/blogs/itil/archive/2008/03/03/HPPost5853.aspx|title=IT Services, Business Services, Services...what's next?|publisher=HP ITIL v3 Community Blog|date=March 3, 2008|accessdate=2009-11-15}}</ref> ==Making the Workload "Intelligent"== A workload is considered "intelligent" when it a) understands its security protocols and processing requirements so it can self-determine whether it can deploy in the public cloud, the private cloud or only on physical machines; b) recognizes when it is at capacity and can find alternative computing capacity as required to optimize performance; c) carries identity and access controls as well as log management and compliance reporting capabilities with it as it moves across environments; and d) is fully integrated with the business service management layer, ensuring that end user computing requirements are not disrupted by distributed computing resources, and working with current and emergent IT management frameworks. ==Intelligent Workloads and Security in the Cloud== The deployment of individual workloads and workload-based business services in the "hybrid distributed data center,"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.sun.com/jasoncatsun/entry/the_hybrid_distributed_data_center|title=The Hybrid Distributed Data Center -er- Cloud?|publisher=Sun Microsystmes|date=October 1, 2009|accessdate=2009-11-15}}</ref> - including physical machines, data centers, private clouds, and the public cloud - raises a host of issues for the efficient management of provisioning, security, and compliance. By making workloads "intelligent" so that they can effectively manage themselves in terms of where they run, how they run, and who can access them, intelligent workload management addresses these issues in a way that is efficient, flexible, and scalable. == See also == * [[Cloud computing]] * [[Dynamic infrastructure]] * [[Identity management]] * [[Portable application]] * [[Software appliance]] * [[Virtual appliance]] * [http://www.novell.com/communities/node/5713/the-future-network-operating-systems Network Operating System] ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Information technology management]] [[de:Intelligent Workload Management]]</text> </page> <page> <id>18782</id> <title>Intension</title> <text>: ''Not to be confused with the homophone [[intention]]; or the related concept of [[intentionality]]. For the song "Intension" by Tool, see ''[[10,000 Days|10,000 Days]]''.'' In [[linguistics]], [[logic]], [[philosophy]], and other fields, an '''intension''' is any [[property (philosophy)|property]] or [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] connoted by a [[word]], [[phrase]] or other symbol. In the case of a word, it is often implied by the word's [[definition]]. The term may also refer to all such intensions collectively, although the term ''[[comprehension (logic)|comprehension]]'' is technically more correct for this. The meaning of a word can be thought of as the bond between ''the idea or thing the word refers to'' and ''the word itself''. Swiss linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] contrasts three concepts: *the ''signifier'' — the "sound image" or string of [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] on a page that one recognizes as a [[Sign (linguistics)|sign]]. *the ''signified'' — the [[concept]] or [[idea]] that a sign evokes. *the ''referent'' — the actual [[Object (philosophy)|thing]] or set of things a sign refers to. See ''[[Sign (semiotics)#Dyadic signs|Dyadic signs]]'' and ''[[Reference#Semantics|Reference (semantics)]]''. Intension is analogous to the signified, extension to the referent. The intension thus links the signifier to the sign's [[Extension (semantics)|extension]]. Without intension of some sort, words can have no meaning. In philosophical arguments about [[dualism]] versus [[monism]], it is noted that thoughts have intensionality and physical objects do not (S.E. Palmer, 1999), but rather have extension in space. ''Intension'' and ''intensionality'' (the state of having intension) should not be confused with ''intention'' and ''[[intentionality]]'', which are pronounced the same and occasionally arise in the same philosophical context. Where this happens, the letter ''s'' or ''t'' is
