Introduced on 10 July 1995, it was a high-end desktop graphics option used in Silicon Graphic's [[workstation]]s. IMPACT graphics provides the workstation with real-time 2D and [[3D graphics]] rendering capability similar to that of even high-end [[Personal computer|PC]]s made well after IMPACT's introduction. IMPACT graphics consists of one or two geometry engines and one or two raster managers in various configurations [http://www.futuretech.blinkenlights.nl/i2info.html#3.3]. IMPACT graphics consists of five graphics subsystems: the command engine, geometry subsystem, raster manager, [[framebuffer]] and display subsystem. IMPACT graphics can produce resolutions up to 1600 x 1200 pixels with up to 36-bit color [http://www.sgistuff.net/hardware/graphics/impact.html] and can also process unencoded [[NTSC]] and [[PAL]] analog [[television]] signals. <!-- The IMPACT Graphics system is made up of ??? [[daughterboard]]s that plug into the main workstation [[motherboard]]. --> IMPACT graphics subsystems come in three configurations for [[SGI Indigo2|SGI Indigo2 IMPACT]] workstations: Solid IMPACT, High IMPACT, and Maximum IMPACT. The equivalent configurations also exist for the [[SGI Octane]] workstation but are referred to as SI, SSI, and MXI (I-series), though the Octane options either had zero or 4 MB TRAM (Texture RAM), compared to High/Maximum IMPACT in Indigo2 which could have 1 MB TRAM. There was also no equivalent of SSI for Indigo2. The Octane options are the same architectural designs, but built with completely different board layouts. All the designs for Indigo2 and Octane are referred to as the MGRAS series graphics options. Later Octane workstations used a similar configuration but with updated [[Application specific integrated circuit|ASIC]]s and are referred to as the SE, SSE, and MXE (E-series). MGRAS uses [[Rambus]] [[RDRAM]] for texture memory. [http://www.futuretech.blinkenlights.nl/octnarch.html] IMPACT uses the GE11 and GE12 geometry engines. The GE11 was used in all the Indigo2 options and the SI, SSI and MXI. The GE12 was used in the SE, SSE and MXE options. The GE11 can achieve 480 [[MFLOP]]s (960 MFLOPs in the SSI and MXI as they both use two GE11s) and the GE12 is rated for 672 MFLOPs (1.344 GFLOPs in the SSE and MXE as they both use two GE12s). The IMPACT graphics architecture was superseded by the [[SGI VPro]] graphics architecture in 1997. ==External links== *[http://www.sgistuff.net/hardware/graphics/impact.html SGIstuff - Impact graphics options by Gerhard Lenerz] *[http://www.futuretech.blinkenlights.nl/octnarch.html SGI Advice and Technical Data - Octane Architecture (Graphics section)] [[Category:SGI graphics|IMPACT]] [[Category:3D graphics software]]</text> </page> <page> <id>17572</id> <title>IMS VDEX</title> <text>{{multiple issues |refimprove=December 2010 |context=December 2010 |notability=December 2010 |primarysources=December 2010 }} The '''IMS''' Vocabulary Definition Exchange ('''VDEX''') specification is a grammar for controlled vocabularies. [[Image:VDEX model.PNG|350px|right|thumb|simplified VDEX data model]] == IMS Vocabulary Definition Exchange == === In Brief === IMS VDEX allows the exchange and expression of simple machine-readable lists of human language terms, along with information that may assist a human in understanding the meaning of the various terms. Put more simply, it is a mark-up language – or grammar – for [[Controlled vocabulary|controlled vocabularies]], with VDEX allowing the description and creation of controlled vocabularies that could be easily interchanged. The term ‘vocabulary’ is defined in the OED (Oxford English Dictionary) online as ‘a collection or list of words with brief explanations of their meanings’. The vocabulary that VDEX is capable of encoding can be of a number of types: a simple flat list of terms; a glossary or dictionary; a thesaurus; or a hierarchy of terms. The VDEX specification does not attempt to accommodate all possible vocabularies and cannot support vocabularies of arbitrary complexity; however, there is limited allowance for complex vocabularies, such as [[faceted classification|faceted]] schemes, multi-language thesauri and polyhierarchical taxonomies. VDEX was developed as an open specification by the IMS Global Learning Consortium, with the Final Specification being approved in February [[2004]]. The specification includes an extensive ''Best Practice and Implementation Guide'', an ''Information Model'' and an ''XML Binding Guide'' that defines how to
