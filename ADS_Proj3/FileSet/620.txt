it can be proved that there is exactly one [[identity morphism]] for every object. Some authors deviate from the definition just given by identifying each object with its identity morphism. Relations among morphisms (such as ''fg'' = ''h'') are often depicted using [[commutative diagram]]s, with "points" (corners) representing objects and "arrows" representing morphisms. ===Properties of morphisms=== Some morphisms have important properties. A morphism ''f'' : ''a'' → ''b'' is: * a [[monomorphism]] (or ''monic'') if ''f''<small>o</small>''g''<sub>1</sub> = ''f''<small>o</small>''g''<sub>2</sub> implies ''g''<sub>1</sub> = ''g''<sub>2</sub> for all morphisms ''g''<sub>1</sub>, ''g<sub>2</sub>'' : ''x'' → ''a''. * an [[epimorphism]] (or ''epic'') if ''g''<sub>1</sub><small>o</small>''f'' = ''g''<sub>2</sub><small>o</small>''f'' implies ''g<sub>1</sub>'' = ''g<sub>2</sub>'' for all morphisms ''g<sub>1</sub>'', ''g<sub>2</sub>'' : ''b'' → ''x''. * an [[isomorphism]] if there exists a morphism ''g'' : ''b'' → ''a'' with ''f''<small>o</small>''g'' = 1<sub>''b''</sub> and ''g''<small>o</small>''f'' = 1<sub>''a''</sub>.<ref>Note that a morphism that is both epic and monic is not necessarily an isomorphism! For example, in the category consisting of two objects ''A'' and ''B'', the identity morphisms, and a single morphism ''f'' from ''A'' to ''B'', ''f'' is both epic and monic but is not an isomorphism.</ref> * an [[endomorphism]] if ''a'' = ''b''. end(''a'') denotes the class of endomorphisms of ''a''. * an [[automorphism]] if ''f'' is both an endomorphism and an isomorphism. aut(''a'') denotes the class of automorphisms of ''a''. ==Functors== {{Main|Functor}} [[Functor]]s are structure-preserving maps between categories. They can be thought of as morphisms in the category of all (small) categories. A ('''covariant''') functor ''F'' from a category ''C'' to a category ''D'', written ''F'':''C'' → ''D'', consists of: * for each object ''x'' in ''C'', an object ''F''(''x'') in ''D''; and * for each morphism ''f'' : ''x'' → ''y'' in ''C'', a morphism ''F''(''f'') : ''F''(''x'') → ''F''(''y''), such that the following two properties hold: * For every object ''x'' in ''C'', ''F''(1<sub>''x''</sub>) = 1<sub>''F''(''x'')</sub>; * For all morphisms ''f'' : ''x'' → ''y'' and ''g'' : ''y'' → ''z'', <math>F(g\circ f)=F(g)\circ F(f).</math> A '''contravariant''' functor ''F'': ''C'' → ''D'', is like a covariant functor, except that it "turns morphisms around" ("reverses all the arrows"). More specifically, every morphism ''f'' : ''x'' → ''y'' in ''C'' must be assigned to a morphism ''F''(''f'') : ''F''(''y'') → ''F''(''x'') in ''D''. In other words, a contravariant functor is a covariant functor from the [[opposite category]] ''C''<sup>op</sup> to ''D''. ==Natural transformations and isomorphisms== {{Main|Natural transformation}} A ''natural transformation'' is a relation between two functors. Functors often describe "natural constructions" and natural transformations then describe "natural homomorphisms" between two such constructions. Sometimes two quite different constructions yield "the same" result; this is expressed by a natural isomorphism between the two functors. If ''F'' and ''G'' are (covariant) functors between the categories ''C'' and ''D'', then a natural transformation η from ''F'' to ''G'' associates to every object ''X'' in ''C'' a morphism η<sub>''X''</sub> : ''F''(''X'') → ''G''(''X'') in ''D'' such that for every morphism ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' in ''C'', we have η<sub>''Y''</sub> <small>o</small> ''F''(''f'') = ''G''(''f'') <small>o</small> η<sub>''X''</sub>; this means that the following diagram is [[commutative diagram|commutative]]: [[Image:Natural transformation.svg|175px|center|Commutative diagram defining natural transformations]] The two functors ''F'' and ''G'' are called ''naturally isomorphic'' if there exists a natural transformation from ''F'' to ''G'' such that η<sub>''X''</sub> is an isomorphism for every object ''X'' in ''C''. ==Universal constructions, limits, and colimits== {{Main|Universal property|Limit (category theory)}} Using the language of category theory, many areas of mathematical study can be cast into appropriate categories, such as the categories of all sets, groups, topologies, and so on. These categories surely have some objects that are "special" in a certain way, such as the [[empty set]] or the [[product topology|product of two topologies]], yet in the definition of a category, objects are considered to be atomic, i.e., we ''do not know'' whether an object ''A'' is a set, a topology, or any other abstract concept – hence, the challenge is to define special objects without referring to the internal structure of those objects. But how can we define the empty set without referring to elements, or the product topology without referring to open sets? The solution is to characterize these objects in terms of their relations to other objects, as given by the morphisms of the respective categories. Thus, the task is to find ''[[universal property|universal properties]]'' that uniquely determine the objects of interest. Indeed, it turns out that numerous important constructions can be described in a purely categorical way. The central concept which is needed for this purpose is called categorical ''[[limit (category theory)|limit]]'', and can be dualized to yield the notion of a ''colimit''. ==Equivalent categories== {{Main|Equivalence of categories|Isomorphism of categories}} It is a natural question to ask: under which conditions can two categories be considered to be "essentially the same", in the sense that theorems about one category can readily be transformed into theorems about the other category? The major tool one employs to describe such a situation is called ''equivalence of categories'', which is given by appropriate functors between two categories. Categorical equivalence has found numerous applications in mathematics. ==Further concepts and results== The definitions of categories and functors provide only the very basics of categorical algebra; additional important topics are listed below. Although there are strong interrelations between all of these topics, the given order can be considered as a guideline for further reading. * The [[functor category]] ''D''<sup>''C''</sup> has as objects the functors from ''C'' to ''D'' and as morphisms the natural transformations of such functors. The [[Yoneda lemma]] is one of the most famous basic results of category theory; it describes representable functors in functor categories. * [[Dual (category theory)|Duality]]: Every statement, theorem, or definition in category theory has a ''dual'' which is essentially obtained by "reversing all the arrows". If one statement is true in a category ''C'' then its dual will be true in the dual category ''C''<sup>op</sup>. This duality, which is transparent at the level of category theory, is often obscured in applications and can lead to surprising relationships. * [[Adjoint functors]]: A functor can be
