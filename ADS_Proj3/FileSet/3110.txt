Quantum Computing, 2nd Ed. Springer, 2004</ref> processes data stored as quantum bits ([[qubits]]), and uses quantum mechanical phenomena such as [[quantum superposition|superposition]] and [[quantum entanglement|entanglement]] to perform computations. A qubit can hold a "0", a "1", or a quantum superposition of these. A quantum computer operates on qubits with [[quantum gate|quantum logic gates]]. Through [[Shor's polynomial algorithm]] for factoring integers, and [[Grover's algorithm]] for quantum database search that has a quadratic time advantage, quantum computers were shown to potentially possess a significant benefit relative to electronic computers. [[Quantum cryptography]] is not based on the [[complexity of the computation]], but on the special properties of [[quantum information]], such as the fact that quantum information cannot be measured reliably and any attempt at measuring it results in an unavoidable and irreversible disturbance. A successful open air experiment in quantum cryptography was reported in 2007, where data was transmitted securely over a distance of 144km.<ref name="Ursin07">Ursin, R. et al.

Implementations of practical quantum computers are based on various substrates such as [[ion trap|ion-traps]], [[superconductors]], [[nuclear magnetic resonance]], etc. As of 2006, the largest quantum computing experiment used liquid state nuclear magnetic resonance quantum information processors, and could operate on up to 12 qubits.<ref name="Negrevergne06">Negrevergne, C. et al.

Physical Review Letters 96:art170501, 2006</ref> == Nature as information processing == The dual aspect of natural computation is that it aims to understand nature by regarding natural phenomena as information processing. The two main directions of research in this area are [[#Systems biology|systems biology]] and [[#Synthetic biology|synthetic biology]]. === Systems biology === ''Further information: [[systems biology]]'' Computational systems biology (or simply systems biology) is an integrative and qualitative approach that investigates the complex communications and interactions taking place in biological systems. Thus, in systems biology, the focus of the study is the [[interaction network]]s themselves and the properties of biological systems that arise due to these networks, rather than the individual components of functional processes in an organism. This type of research on organic components has focused strongly on four different interdependent interaction networks:<ref name="Car07">Cardelli, L. [http://lucacardelli.name/Bibliography.htm Abstract machines of systems biology] Bulletin of the EATCS 93 (2007), 176-204</ref> gene-regulatory networks, biochemical networks, transport networks, and carbohydrate networks. [[Gene regulatory networks]] comprise gene-gene interactions, as well as interactions between genes and other substances in the cell. [[Gene]]s are transcribed into [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA), and then translated into [[protein]]s according to the [[genetic code]]. Each gene is associated with other DNA segments ([[promoter]]s, [[enhancer (genetics)|enhancer]]s, or [[silencer (DNA)|silencer]]s) that act as [[binding site]]s for [[activator]]s or [[repressor]]s for [[gene transcription]]. Genes interact with each other either through their gene products (mRNA, proteins) which can regulate gene transcription, or through small [[RNA species]] that can directly regulate genes. These [[gene-gene interactions]], together with genes' interactions with other substances in the cell, form the most basic interaction network: the [[gene regulatory network]]s. They perform information processing tasks within the cell, including the assembly and maintenance of other networks. Models of gene regulatory networks include random and probabilistic [[Boolean network]]s, [[asynchronous automata]], and [[network motif]]s. Another viewpoint is that the entire genomic regulatory system is a computational system, a ''genomic computer''. This interpretation allows one to compare human-made electronic computation with computation as it occurs in nature.<ref name="IDD07">Istrail, S., De-Leon, B-T., Davidson, E.

[[Biochemical networks]] refer to the interactions between proteins, and they perform various mechanical and metabolic tasks inside a cell. Two or more proteins may bind to each other via binding of their interactions sites, and form a dynamic protein complex ([[complexation]]). These protein complexes may act as [[catalysts]] for other chemical reactions, or may chemically modify each other. Such modifications cause changes to available binding sites of proteins. There are tens of thousands of proteins in a cell, and they interact with each other. To describe such a massive scale interactions, [[Kohn maps]]<ref name=Kohn>Kohn, K.
