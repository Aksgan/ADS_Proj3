he called "Signorini problem" to honour his teacher. The preliminary note later published as {{Harv|Fichera|1963}} was written up and submitted to Signorini exactly a week before his death: He was very satisfied to see a positive answer to his question. A few days later, he told his [[Family doctor|family Doctor]] Damiano Aprile<ref>[[Gaetano Fichera]] reports the episode in reference {{Harv|Fichera|1995|p=53}}, following the report of [[Mauro Picone]]: see the article about [[Antonio Signorini]] for further details.</ref>:-"Il mio discepolo Fichera mi ha dato una grande soddisfazione (My disciple Fichera gave me a great contentment)."-"Ma Lei ne ha avute tante, Professore, durante la Sua vita (But you had many, Professor, during your life)"- replied Doctor Aprile, but also Signorini replied:-"Ma questa è la più grande (But this is the greatest one)"-. And those were his last words. According to {{Harvtxt|Antman|1983|p=282}} the solution of the Signorini problem coincides with the birth of the field of [[Variational inequality|variational inequalities]]. == Formal statement of the problem == The content of this section and the following subsections follows closely the treatment of [[Gaetano Fichera]] in {{Harv|Fichera|1963}}, {{Harv|Fichera|1964b}} and also {{Harv|Fichera|1995}}: his derivation of the problem is different from [[Antonio Signorini|Signorini]]'s one in that he does not consider only [[incopressible body|incompressible bodies]] and a plane rest [[surface]], as Signorini does<ref> See {{Harvnb|Signorini|1959|p=127}}) for the original approach.</ref>. The problem consist in finding the [[displacement vector]] from the [[Continuum mechanics#Mathematical modeling of a continuum|natural configuration]] <math>\scriptstyle\boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{x})=\left(u_1(\boldsymbol{x}),u_2(\boldsymbol{x}),u_3(\boldsymbol{x})\right)</math> of a [[Anisotropy#Material science and engineering|anisotropic]] [[Homogeneous media|non-homogeneous]] [[Physical body|elastic body]] that lies in a [[subset]] <math>A</math> of the three-[[dimension]]al [[euclidean space]] whose [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] is <math>\scriptstyle\partial A</math> and whose [[interior normal]] is the [[Euclidean vector|vector]] '''''<math>n</math>''''', resting on a [[Rigid body|rigid]] [[frictionless]] [[surface]] whose [[Contact (mechanics)|contact]] [[surface]] (or more generally contact [[set (mathematics)|set]]) is <math>\Sigma</math> and subject only to its [[body force]]s <math>\scriptstyle\boldsymbol{f}(\boldsymbol{x})=\left(f_1(\boldsymbol{x}),f_2(\boldsymbol{x}),f_3(\boldsymbol{x})\right)</math>, and [[surface force]]s <math>\scriptstyle\boldsymbol{g}(\boldsymbol{x})=\left(g_1(\boldsymbol{x}),g_2(\boldsymbol{x}),g_3(\boldsymbol{x})\right)</math> applied on the free (i.e. not in contact with the rest surface) surface <math>\scriptstyle\partial A\setminus\Sigma </math>: the set <math>A</math> and the contact surface <math>\Sigma</math> characterize the natural configuration of the body and are known a priori. Therefore the body has to satisfy the general [[Stress (mechanics)#Equilibrium equations and symmetry of the stress tensor|equilibrium equations]] :{{EquationRef|1|(1){{spaces|5}}}}<math>\qquad\frac{\partial\sigma_{ik}}{\partial x_k}- f_i= 0\qquad\text{for } i=1,2,3</math> written using the [[Einstein notation]] as all in the following development, the ordinary [[Boundary value problem|boundary conditions]] on <math>\scriptstyle\partial A\setminus\Sigma</math> :{{EquationRef|2|(2){{spaces|5}}}}<math>\qquad\sigma_{ik}n_k-g_i=0\qquad\text{for } i=1,2,3</math> and the following two sets of [[Boundary value problem|boundary conditions]] on <math>\Sigma</math>, where '''<math>\scriptstyle\boldsymbol{\sigma} = \boldsymbol{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{u})</math>''' is the [[Cauchy stress tensor]]. Obviously, the body forces and surface forces cannot be given in arbitrary way but they must satisfy a condition in order for the body to reach an equilibrium configuration: this condition will be deduced and analized in the following development. === The ambiguous boundary conditions === If '''''<math>\scriptstyle\boldsymbol{\tau}=(\tau_1,\tau_2,\tau_3)</math>''''' is any [[tangent vector]] to the [[Contact (mechanics)|contact]] [[set (mathematics)|set]] <math>\Sigma</math>, then the ambiguous boundary condition in each [[Point (geometry)|point]] of this set are expressed by the following two systems of [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]] :{{EquationRef|3|(3){{spaces|5}}}}<math> \quad \begin{cases} u_i n_i & = 0 \\ \sigma_{ik} n_i n_k & \geq 0\\ \sigma_{ik} n_i \tau_k & = 0 \end{cases} </math>{{spaces|5}}or{{spaces|5}}{{EquationRef|4|(4){{spaces|5}}}}<math> \begin{cases} u_i n_i & > 0 \\ \sigma_{ik} n_i n_k & = 0 \\ \sigma_{ik} n_i \tau_k & = 0 \end{cases} </math> Let's analyze their meaning: *Each [[set (mathematics)|set]] of conditions consists of three [[Binary relation|relations]], [[Equality (mathematics)|equalities]] or [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]], and all the second members are the [[Zero function#Other uses of zero in_mathematics|zero function]]. *The [[quantity|quantities]] at first member of each first relation are [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] of the [[vector component|component]] of the [[displacement vector]] directed along the [[normal vector]] '''<math>n</math>'''. *The quantities at first member of each second relation are proportional to the norm of the component of the [[Stress (mechanics)#Relationship stress_vector - stress_tensor|tension vector]] directed along the [[normal vector]] '''<math>n</math>''', *The quantities at the first member of each third relation are proportional to the norm of the component of the tension vector along any [[Euclidean vector|vector]] '''<math>\tau</math>''' [[Tangent vector|tangent]] in the given [[Point (geometry)|point]] to the [[Contact (mechanics)|contact]] [[set (mathematics)|set]] <math>\Sigma</math>. *The quantities at the first member of each of the three relations are [[Positive number|positive]] if they have the same [[Euclidean vector|sense]] of the [[Euclidean vector|vector]] they are [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to, while they are [[negative number|negative]] if not, therefore the [[Proportionality (mathematics)|constants of proportionality]] are respectively <math>\scriptstyle +1</math> and <math>\scriptstyle -1</math>. Knowing these facts, the set of conditions {{EquationNote|3|(3)}} applies to [[Point (geometry)|point]]s of the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of the body which ''do not'' leave the [[Contact (mechanics)|contact]] set <math>\Sigma</math> in the [[Linear elasticity#Elastostatics|equilibrium configuration]], since, according to the first [[Binary relation|relation]], the [[displacement vector]] '''<math>u</math>''' ''has no [[vector component|component]]s'' directed as the [[normal vector]] '''<math>n</math>''', while, according to the second relation, the [[Stress (mechanics)#Relationship stress_vector - stress_tensor|tension vector]] ''may have a component'' directed as the normal vector '''<math>n</math>''' and having the same [[Euclidean vector|sense]]. In an analogous way, the set of conditions {{EquationNote|4|(4)}} applies to points of the boundary of the body which ''leave'' that set in the equilibrium configuration, since displacement vector '''<math>u</math>''' ''has a component'' directed as the normal vector '''<math>n</math>''', while the [[Stress (mechanics)#Relationship stress vector - stress tensor|tension vector]] ''has no components'' directed as the normal vector '''<math>n</math>'''. For both sets of conditions, the tension vector has no tangent component to the [[Contact (mechanics)|contact]] set, according to the [[hypothesis]] that the body rests on a rigid ''frictionless'' surface. Each system expresses a '''unilateral constraint''', in the sense that they express the physical impossibility of the [[Physical body|elastic body]] to penetrate into the surface where it rests: the ambiguity is not only in the unknown values non-[[zero]] quantities must satisfy on the [[Contact (mechanics)|contact]] set but also in the fact that it is not a priori known if a point belonging to that set satisfies the system of boundary conditions {{EquationNote|3|(3)}} or {{EquationNote|4|(4)}}. The set of points where {{EquationNote|3|(3)}} is satisfied is called the '''area of support''' of the elastic body on <math>\Sigma</math>, while its [[Complement (set theory)#Relative complement|complement respect to <math>\Sigma</math>]] is called the '''area of separation'''.
