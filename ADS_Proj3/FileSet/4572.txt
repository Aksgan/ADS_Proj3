in attempt to prevent electromagnetic interference. Because the shielding is made of metal, it may also serve as a ground. However, usually a shielded or a screened twisted pair cable has a special grounding wire added called a drain wire. This shielding can be applied to individual pairs, or to the collection of pairs. When shielding is applied to the collection of pairs, this is referred to as screening. The shielding must be grounded for the shielding to work. ; Shielded twisted pair (STP or STP-A) : STP cabling includes metal shielding over each individual pair of copper wires. This type of shielding protects cable from external EMI. e.g. the 150 ohm shielded twisted pair cables defined by the IBM Cabling System specifications and used with [[token ring]] networks. ; Screened unshielded twisted pair (S/UTP) : Also known as Foiled Twisted Pair (FTP), is a screened UTP cable (ScTP). ; Screened shielded twisted pair (S/STP or S/FTP) : S/STP cabling, also known as Screened Fully shielded Twisted Pair (S/FTP),<ref name="siemon1">[http://www.siemon.com/us/white_papers/06-07-20-grounding.asp Grounding for Screened and Shielded Network Cabling - Siemon<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> is both individually shielded (like STP cabling) and also has an outer metal shielding covering the entire group of shielded copper pairs (like S/UTP). This type of cabling offers the best protection from interference from external sources, and also eliminates ''alien [[crosstalk]]''.<ref name="siemon1"/> Note that different vendors and authors use different terminology (i.e. STP has been used to denote both STP-A, S/STP, and S/UTP).<ref>[http://www.anitech-systems.com/MP4000/manual/briefs/ICM-4020E_Hub_Switch_Route_Cable_BR120501.pdf Anitech Systems MP 4000 Manual]</ref> {{clear}} '''Comparison of some old and new abbreviations, according to ISO/IEC 11801:''' {|class=wikitable |- !

It is less flexible than stranded cable and is more prone to failure if repeatedly flexed. Stranded cable is used for fly leads at patch panel and for connections from wall-ports to end devices, as it resists cracking of the conductors. Stranded core is generally more expensive than solid core. Connectors need to be designed differently for solid core than for stranded. Use of a connector with the wrong cable type is likely to lead to unreliable cabling. Plugs designed for solid and stranded core are readily available, and some vendors even offer plugs designed for use with both types. The punch-down blocks on patch-panel and wall port jacks are designed for use with solid core cable. ==Manufacture== ;Copper Rod Breakdown: {{main|Wire drawing}} The first step in low voltage cable production is copper rod breakdown. Copper is sent to the factory in 5,000 lb coils. These copper coils are continuously drawn through diamond dies that drastically reduce the diameter of the copper to 10 or 12 gauge. Lubrication is used during this process to reduce the amount of friction and heat on the copper cable. Once completed, the copper is stacked in vertical coils, called ''stem packs''. These stem packs are then transferred to another drawing operation that further reduces the gauge of the copper. During this stage, the copper is also charged with an electrical current. This anneals the copper, which is a softening process. Once annealed and cooled off, the copper runs through a laser measurement system, to verify it is within manufacturing specifications. ;Copper Insulation Process: The copper insulation process is continually monitored and controlled up to +/- .0001". Once the copper is insulated, it runs through a water cooling trough, allowing the wire jacket to harden properly. ;Copper Twisting: Twisting helps reduce crosstalk between the individual pairs of wire. Some Cat6 premises cables include a center spline, or wire separator, to further reduce crosstalk and increase performance. Copper twisting is accomplished by running each individual wire through multiple faceplates. This helps control pair position. Once twisted, this is known as a ''cable unit''. ;Jacketing: The cable unit then goes through the jacketing process. This step varies, depending on the type of cable being manufactured. OSP cable typically uses a black polyethylene or UV rated polyvinyl chloride (PVC). For
