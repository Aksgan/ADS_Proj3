It was created by the [[Joint Photographic Experts Group]] committee in 2000 with the intention of superseding their original [[discrete cosine transform]]-based [[JPEG]] standard (created in 1992) with a newly designed, [[wavelet]]-based method. The standardized [[filename extension]] is '''.jp2''' for [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 15444-1 conforming files and '''.jpx''' for the extended part-2 specifications, published as ISO/IEC 15444-2. The registered [[Internet media type|MIME types]] are defined in RFC 3745. For ISO/IEC 15444-1 it is '''image/jp2'''. == Aims of the standard == While there is a modest increase in compression performance of JPEG 2000 compared to JPEG, the main advantage offered by JPEG 2000 is the significant flexibility of the codestream. The codestream obtained after compression of an image with JPEG 2000 is scalable in nature, meaning that it can be decoded in a number of ways; for instance, by truncating the codestream at any point, one may obtain a representation of the image at a lower resolution, or [[signal-to-noise]] ratio – see [[Lossy_data_compression#Downsampling.2Fcompressed_representation_scalability|scalable compression]]. By ordering the codestream in various ways, applications can achieve significant performance increases. However, as a consequence of this flexibility, JPEG 2000 requires [[encoder]]s/[[decoder]]s that are complex and computationally demanding. Another difference, in comparison with JPEG, is in terms of visual [[compression artifact|artifacts]]: JPEG 2000 produces [[ringing artifacts]], manifested as blur and rings near edges in the image, while JPEG produces ringing artifacts and 'blocking' artifacts, due to its [[JPEG#Block_splitting|8×8 blocks]]. JPEG 2000 has been published as an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard, ISO/IEC 15444. {{As of|2010}}, JPEG 2000 is not widely supported in [[web browser]]s, and hence is not generally used on the [[World Wide Web]]. ==Features== * ''Superior compression performance'': at high bit rates, where artifacts become nearly imperceptible, JPEG 2000 has a small machine-measured fidelity advantage over JPEG. At lower bit rates (e.g., less than 0.25 bits/pixel for grayscale images), JPEG 2000 has a much more significant advantage over certain modes of JPEG: artifacts are less visible and there is almost no blocking. The compression gains over JPEG are attributed to the use of [[Discrete wavelet transform|DWT]] and a more sophisticated entropy encoding scheme. [[Image:JPEG 2000 Artifacts Demonstration.png|thumb|96px|Top-to-bottom demonstration of the artifacts of JPEG 2000 compression. The numbers indicate the compression ratio used. See the unscaled image for an accurate view.]] * ''Multiple resolution representation'': JPEG 2000 decomposes the image into a multiple resolution representation in the course of its compression process. This representation can be put to use for other image presentation purposes beyond compression as such. * ''Progressive transmission'' by pixel and resolution accuracy, commonly referred to as progressive decoding and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scalability: JPEG 2000 provides efficient code-stream organizations which are progressive by pixel accuracy and by image resolution (or by image size). This way, after a smaller part of the whole file has been received, the viewer can see a lower quality version of the final picture. The quality then improves progressively through downloading more data bits from the source. The 1992 JPEG standard also has a progressive transmission feature but it's rarely used.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} * ''[[Lossless compression|Lossless]] and [[lossy compression]]'': Like JPEG 1992,<ref>[http://www.cis.temple.edu/~vasilis/Courses/CIS750/Papers/doc_jpeg_c_5.pdf The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard] pp.6-7</ref> the JPEG 2000 standard provides both lossless and lossy compression in a single compression architecture. Lossless compression is provided by the use of a reversible integer wavelet transform in JPEG 2000. * ''Random code-stream access and processing'', also referred as [[Region of interest|Region Of Interest]] (ROI): JPEG 2000 code streams offer several mechanisms to support spatial random access or region of interest access at varying degrees of granularity. This way it is possible to store different parts of the same picture using different quality. * ''Error resilience'': Like JPEG 1992, JPEG 2000 is robust to bit errors introduced by noisy communication channels, due to the coding of data in relatively small independent blocks. * ''Flexible file format'': The JP2 and JPX file formats allow for handling of color-space information, metadata, and for interactivity in networked applications as developed in the JPEG Part 9 JPIP protocol. * ''Side channel spatial information'': it fully supports transparency and alpha planes.
