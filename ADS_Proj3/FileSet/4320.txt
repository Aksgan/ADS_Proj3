These works rely on simple arrangements of basic volumes and voids, mechanically produced surfaces, and algebraic permutations of form.

One could see it as the application of [[systems theory]] to [[product development]]. There is some overlap with the disciplines of [[systems analysis]], [[systems architecture]] and [[systems engineering]].<ref>{{FS1037C}}</ref><ref>{{DODDIC}}</ref> If the broader topic of [[product development]] "blends the perspective of marketing, design, and manufacturing into a single approach to product development,<ref>{{cite book | last = Ulrich & Eppinger | title = Product Design & Development | publisher = Irwin McGraw-Hill | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-07-229647-X}}</ref> then design is the act of taking the marketing information and creating the design of the product to be manufactured. Systems design is therefore the process of defining and developing [[system]]s to satisfy specified [[requirement]]s of the user. Until the 1990s systems design had a crucial and respected role in the [[data processing]] industry. In the 1990s [[standardization]] of hardware and software resulted in the ability to build [[modularity (programming)|modular]] systems. The increasing importance of software running on generic platforms has enhanced the discipline of [[software engineering]]. [[Object-oriented analysis and design]] methods are becoming the most widely used methods for computer systems design.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] has become the standard language in object-oriented analysis and design.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} It is widely used for modeling software systems and is increasingly used for high designing non-software systems and organizations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} ==Logical design== The logical design of a system pertains to an abstract representation of the data flows, inputs and outputs of the system. This is often conducted via modelling, using an over-abstract (and sometimes graphical model) of the actual system. In the context of systems design, modelling can undertake the following forms, including ==Physical design== The physical design relates to the actual input and output processes of the system. This is laid down in terms of how data is input into a system, how it is verified/authenticated, how it is processed, and how it is displayed as output. Physical design, in this context, does not refer to the tangible physical design of an information system. To use an analogy, a personal computer's physical design involves input via a keyboard, processing within the CPU, and output via a monitor, printer, etc. It would not concern the actual layout of the tangible hardware, which for a PC would be a monitor, CPU, motherboard, hard drive, modems, video/graphics cards, USB slots, etc. ==Alternative design methodologies== ===Rapid application development (RAD)=== [[Rapid application development]] (RAD) is a methodology in which a systems designer produces prototypes for an end-user. The end-user reviews the
