and joined up automatically, which helps bring resources together to create [[Virtual Organization (Grid computing)|Virtual Organizations]] (VOs). The descriptions constitute [[metadata]] and are typically represented using the technologies of the [[Semantic Web]], such as the [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF). By analogy with the Semantic Web, the Semantic Grid can be defined as "an extension of the current Grid in which information and services are given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation." This notion of the Semantic Grid was first articulated in the context of [[e-Science]], observing that such an approach is necessary to achieve a high degree of easy-to-use and seamless automation enabling flexible collaborations and computations on a global scale. The use of Semantic Web and other [[knowledge technologies]] in Grid applications is sometimes described as the [[Knowledge Grid]]. Semantic Grid extends this by also applying these technologies within the Grid [[middleware]]. Some Semantic Grid activities are coordinated through the Semantic Grid Research Group of the [[Global Grid Forum]]. ==See also== ===Standards=== *[[Semantic Web Rule Language]] (SWRL) ===Application Areas=== *[[LSID|Life Science Identifiers]] *[[Business Intelligence 2.0]] (BI 2.0) *[http://www.springerlink.com/index/r3w7115088ggw883.pdf e-Tourism] ==External links == * http://www.semanticgrid.org - Semantic Grid website * [http://www.ontogrid.net ONTOGRID: EU-funded research project for enabling semantic grid applications] * http://www.dagstuhl.de/05271/ - Semantic Grid Dagstuhl Seminar *[http://www.springerlink.com/index/r3w7115088ggw883.pdf Semantic Grid oriented to eTourism] [[Category:Grid computing]] [[Category:Semantic Web]] [[de:Semantic Grid]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33813</id> <title>Semantic interpretation</title> <text>'''Semantic interpretation''' is an important component in [[dialog system]]s.

The goal of interpretation is binding the user [[utterance]] to concept, or something the system can understand. Typically it is creating a database query based on user utterance. {{Uncategorized stub|date=September 2010}} {{Comp-eng-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>33817</id> <title>Semantic matching</title> <text>'''Semantic matching''' is a technique used in Computer Science to identify information which is semantically related. Given any two graph-like structures, e.g. classifications, database or XML schemas and ontologies, matching is an operator which identifies those nodes in the two structures which semantically correspond to one another. For example, applied to file systems it can identify that a folder labeled “car” is semantically equivalent to another folder “automobile” because they are synonyms in English. This information can be taken from a linguistic resource like [[Wordnet|WordNet]]. In the recent years many of them has been offered. A good survey is represented by [http://dit.unitn.it/~p2p/RelatedWork/Matching/JoDS-IV-2005_SurveyMatching-SE.pdf]. [http://eprints.biblio.unitn.it/archive/00000531/01/015.pdf S-Match] is a good example of '''semantic matching operator'''. It works on [http://eprints.biblio.unitn.it/archive/00000967/01/016.pdf lightweight ontologies], namely graph structures where each node is labeled by a natural language sentence, for example in English. These sentences are translated into a formal logical formula (according to an artificial unambiguous language) codifying the meaning of the node taking into account its position in the graph. For example, in case the folder “car” is under another folder “red” we can say that the meaning of the folder “car” is “red car” in this case. This is translated into the logical formula “red AND car”. The output of S-Match is a set of semantic correspondences called mappings attached with one of the following semantic relations: disjointness (⊥), equivalence (≡), more specific (⊑) and less specific (⊒). In our example the algorithm will return a mapping between ”car” and ”automobile” attached with an equivalence relation. Semantic matching represents a fundamental technique in many applications in areas such as resource discovery, data integration, data migration, query translation, peer to peer networks, agent communication, schema and ontology merging. In fact, it has been proposed as a valid solution to the semantic heterogeneity problem, namely managing the diversity in knowledge. Interoperability among people of different cultures and languages, having different viewpoints and using different terminology has always been a huge problem. Especially with the advent of the Web and the consequential information explosion, the problem seems to be emphasized. People face the concrete problem to retrieve, disambiguate and integrate information coming from a wide variety of sources. ==Open source software== * http://s-match.org * http://semanticmatching.org * http://sourceforge.net/projects/s-match/ ==See also== *[[Semantic Unification]] *[[Lightweight ontologies]] *[[Ontology alignment]] *[[Minimal mappings]] [[Category:Semantic Web]] [[Category:Ontology (information science)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33824</id> <title>Semantic publishing</title> <text>{{POV|date=October 2008}} <!-- "will revolutionize", "will change the face of"--> '''Semantic publishing''' on the [[World Wide Web|Web]] or [[semantic web]] publishing refers to publishing information on the web as documents accompanied by [[semantic markup]]. Semantic publication provides a way for computers to understand the structure and even the meaning of the published information, making information search and [[data integration]] more efficient. Although semantic publishing is not specific to the Web, it has been driven by the rising of the semantic web. In the semantic web, published information is accompanied by metadata describing the information, providing a "semantic" context. Although semantic publishing has the potential to change the face of [[web publishing]], acceptance depends on the emergence of compelling applications. Web sites can already be built with all contents in both [[HTML]] format and semantic format.<ref> Examples are [http://www.mindswap.org/ mindswap], [http://ebiquity.umbc.edu/ UMBC ebiquity], and [http://web2express.org/openlab web2express.org open lab]</ref> [[RSS]]1.0, uses [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] (a semantic web standard) format, although it has become less popular than RSS2.0 and [[Atom (standard)|Atom]].<ref name=ufeed> Web2express.org applies RDF to various data feeds.

[[Tim Berners-Lee]] predicted in 2001 that the semantic web “will likely profoundly change the very nature of how [[scientific knowledge]] is produced and shared, in ways that we can now barely imagine”.<ref>{{ harvnb|Berners-Lee|Hendler|2001}}</ref> Revisiting the semantic web in 2006, he and his colleagues believed the semantic web “could bring about a revolution in how, for example, scientific content is managed throughout its life cycle”.<ref>{{ harvnb|Shadbolt|Berners-Lee|Hall|2006}}</ref> Researchers could directly self-publish their experiment data in "semantic" format on the web. Semantic search engines could then make these data widely available.
