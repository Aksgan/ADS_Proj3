He is most notable for the creation of the [[TRIZ|Theory of Inventive Problem Solving]], better known by its Russia acronym TRIZ. He founded the Azerbaijan Public Institute for Inventive Creation, and was the first President of the TRIZ Association. He also wrote science fiction under the [[pen-name]] Genrikh Altov. ==Early life== He created the ''Teoriya Resheniya Izobreatatelskikh Zadach'' (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving or [[TRIZ]])). Working as a [[patent examiner|clerk]] in a [[patent office]], Altshuller embarked on finding some generic rules that would explain creation of new, inventive, patentable ideas. ==Arrest and imprisonment== During one of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s purges he was imprisoned for political reasons and continued his studies with his fellow inmates while in a [[labor camp]]. After his release, Altshuller settled in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]]. ==The spread of TRIZ in the Soviet Union== A full-fledged TRIZ movement developed among [[USSR|Soviet]] engineers and other technically inclined people by the 1970s, and Altshuller played the role of its intellectual leader. He lectured at TRIZ congresses, published articles and books and corresponded with various TRIZ practitioners. He became the founding member and president of the Russian TRIZ Association. A number of his close friends and students have become the most prominent thinkers and teachers of the movement, popularizing TRIZ in [[Russia]] and abroad. For a long time he published articles on TRIZ, with examples and exercises, in the Soviet popular science magazine ''Izobretatel i Ratsionalizator'' (''Inventor and Innovator''). ==After the Soviet collapse== Altshuller left Baku in the early 1990s amidst post-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-breakup violence in the area. He settled in [[Petrozavodsk]] ([[Karelia]] in north-western [[Russia]]) with his wife and granddaughter. As a result, Petrozavodsk became the center of the TRIZ Association. He died from complications of [[Parkinson's disease]] in 1998. ==Science Fiction== Following his release from prison camp in the 1950s, he earned a living as a science fiction writer, under the pseudonym Genrikh Altov (Генрих Альтов), often in collaboration with his wife, [[Valentina Zhuravleva]]. === Science fiction published as Genrich Altov === *Икар и Дедал 1958 (Icarus and Daedalus) *Легенды о звездных капитанах 1961 (Legends of Starship Captains) *Опаляющий разум 1968 (Scorching Mind) *Создан для бури 1970 (Made for the Storm) *Летящие по Вселенной 2002, with [[Valentina Zhuravleva]] (They Who Fly Through Space) ==External links== * [http://www.altshuller.ru/biography/ Full Biography] * {{isfdb name|id=Genrikh_Altov|name=Genrikh Altov}} {{Lists of Russians}} {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME = Altshuller, Genrich | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = Altov, Genrikh | SHORT DESCRIPTION = Engineer, writer, inventor, scientist and journalist.

Many early fellows of the [[Royal Society]] in [[London]] were gentleman scientists. The position significantly reduced during the 20th century as other forms of science funding increased. ==Benefits and drawbacks== Self-funding has the disadvantage that funds may be more restricted, however it has the advantage of obviating a number of inconveniences such as teaching obligations, administrative duties, and writing grant requests to funding bodies. It also permits the scientist to have greater control over research directions, as funding bodies direct grants towards interests that may not coincide with that of the scientist. Peer-review is sidestepped.<ref>{{doi|10.1126/science.279.5348.178}}</ref> Furthermore, [[intellectual property]] of the inventions belongs to the inventor and not the employer. ==Modern-day gentleman scientists== Modern-day equivalents are [[Stephen Wolfram]] who funds his own independent research through the sale of [[Mathematica]] software, [[Craig Venter]], [[Julian Barbour]], [[Aubrey de Grey]], [[Barrington Moore]], [[Susan Blackmore]]<ref>http://www.moreintelligentlife.com/story/solo-science</ref> and [[James Lovelock]]<ref>http://www.moreintelligentlife.com/story/solo-science.</ref> Speaking of [[Peter D. Mitchell]], Peter Rich said "I think he would have found it difficult to have gotten funding because his ideas were rather radical."<ref>{{doi|10.1126/science.279.5348.178}}</ref> Mitchell went on to win the Nobel prize for chemistry in 1978. Chemist [[Luis Leloir]] funded the research institute he headed, the Institute for Biochemical Research, in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
