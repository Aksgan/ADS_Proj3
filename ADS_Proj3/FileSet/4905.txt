Xena is short for XML Electronic Normalising for Archives. Xena is a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] application developed by the [[National Archives of Australia]]. It is available free of charge under the [[GNU General Public License]]. Version 5.0.0 was released Dec. 9, 2009. Source code and binaries for Linux, OS X and Windows are available from [[SourceForge]]. ==Mode of operation== Xena attempts to avoid [[digital obsolescence]] by converting files into an openly specified format, such as [[OpenDocument|ODF]] or [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]]. If the file format is not supported or the Binary Normalisation option is selected, Xena will perform [[ASCII]] [[Base64]] encoding on binary files and wrap the output in XML metadata. The resulting .xena file is plain text, although the content of the data itself is not directly human-readable. The exact original file can be retrieved by stripping the metadata and reversing the Base64 encoding, using an internal viewer. ==Features== Platforms supported by Xena are [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]] and [[Mac OS X]]. Xena uses a series of plugins to identify file formats and convert them to an appropriate openly specified format. Xena has an [[application programming interface]] which allows any reasonably skilled Java developer to develop a plugin to cover a new file type. Xena can process individual files or whole directories. When processing a whole directory, it can preserve the original directory structure of the converted records. Xena can create plain text versions of file formats such as [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]], [[Microsoft Word|Word]] and [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], with the use of [[Tesseract (software)]].
