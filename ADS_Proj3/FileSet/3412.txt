were made to use up store items prior to the period of [[Lent]] [[fasting]] beginning on [[Shrovetide]]. The pancake's shape and structure varies worldwide. There are numerous variations of them throughout Europe. In [[Germany]], pancakes can be made from potatoes. A [[crêpe]] is a French variety of thin pancake cooked on one or both sides in a special crepe pan to achieve a network of fine bubbles often compared to [[lace]] - a savory variety made from [[buckwheat]] is usually known as a [[galette]]. ==Etymology== The [[Middle English]] word ''Pancake'' appears in an [[England|English]] culinary manuscript from 1430.<ref>[http://www.pancakeology.com/node/5 Pancake History] Pancakeology</ref><ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=p&p=2 Online Etymology Dictionary]</ref> ==Regional varieties== ===Northern Europe=== [[File:The Ultimate Pancake.jpg‎|thumb|left|Pannekoek with bacon and Gouda cheese]] [[File:Heap of pancakes in Sweden.JPG|thumb|Swedish pancakes]] [[File:Kaiserschmarrn at Weihenstephan 2005-08-03.jpg|thumb|Kaiserschmarrn]] [[File:Palatschinke.jpg|thumb|right|''Palacinky'', Slovak pancakes]] [[France|French]] '''[[crêpes]]''', popular in [[France]], [[Canada]], and [[Brazil]] (where they may be called pancakes or crêpes) are made from flour, milk, and eggs. They are thin and are usually served with a large amount of sweet or savory filling, ranging from fruit or ice cream, to [[seafood]] (in Brazil, most usually ground meat). A [[Galette|'''Breton galette''']] is a large thin pancake made of [[buckwheat]] flour, mostly associated with the regions of [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]] in France. It is often cooked on one side only. [[Germany|German]] pancakes are called '''Pfannkuchen''' (''Pfanne'' and ''Kuchen'' meaning 'pan' and 'cake'). In some regions (Berlin, Brandenburg, Saxonia) pancakes are called ''Eierkuchen'', as the term ''Pfannkuchen'' refers to [[Berliner (pastry)|Berliners]] there. In [[Swabia]] sliced pancake strips (''Flädle'') are often served in soup. In the [[Netherlands]] and [[Flanders]], pancakes are called [[pannenkoek]]en and eaten at [[dinner]]time. Pancake [[restaurant]]s are popular family restaurants and serve many varieties of sweet, savory, and stuffed pancakes. Pannekoeken are slightly thicker than crêpes and usually quite large (12" or more) in diameter. The batter is egg-based and the fillings can include sliced apples, cheese, ham, bacon, candied ginger and many other ingredients — alone or in combination — as well as "stroop" (molasses), a thick sugar syrup. One classical Dutch filling is a combination of bacon and stroop. [[Poffertjes]] are another Dutch pancake-type dish. They resemble American pancakes somewhat, but are sweeter, and much smaller. The require a specially dimpled pan, preferably in copper. The technique used also varies; they are flipped repeatedly before a side is completely done, in order to attain a softer interior. Scandinavian pancakes are similar to the French [[crêpe]]s. They are served with jam as a main dish with a variety of savory fillings. Traditional [[Sweden|Swedish]] variations can be exotic. Beside the usual thin pancakes, called pannkakor, which resembles the French crêpes and, often served with whipped cream and jam, are eaten for lunch on Thursdays with [[pea soup]], the Swedish cuisine has ''plättar'' which resemble tiny English pancakes, and are fried several at a time in a special pan. Others resemble German pancakes but include fried pork in the batter; these are baked in the oven. [[Potato pancakes]] called ''raggmunk'' contain shredded raw potato, and may contain other vegetables (sometimes the pancake batter is omitted, producing ''rårakor''). ''Raggmunk'' and ''rårakor'' are traditionally eaten with pork rinds and [[lingonberry]] jam. A special Swedish pancake is ''saffron pancake'' from Gotland, made with saffron and rice, baked in the oven. The Norwegian variety is commonly eaten for dinner, traditionally with jam or sugar. Some people add lemon juice to the sugar for extra taste. The Icelandic pancake is very similar to a traditional Scandinavian one but is served differently. The pancakes are usually a bit browner than the traditional Swedish one and rolled up in usually sugar or cream. Another special ``Swedish pancake´´ is the äggakaka (eggcake), also called skånsk äggakaka (scanian eggcake),it is almost like an ordinary Swedish pancake but it's a lot thicker and also a lot more difficult to make due to the risk of burning it. It's made in a fryingpan and is about 1½ to 2 inches thick and is served with lingonberries and bacon. [[Finland|Finnish]] pancakes greatly resemble "Plättar" and are called "Lettu". In [[Finland]] pancakes are usually eaten as dessert with whipped cream and/or pancake-jam, sugar or vanilla ice-cream. In finnish, "Lettu" and "Pannukakku" (literally "Pancake") have different meanings, the latter having structurally closer resemblance to hotcake, and baked in an oven instead of using a frying pan. ===United Kingdom=== [[England|English]] pancakes have three key ingredients: plain flour, eggs, and milk. The batter is runny and forms a thin layer on the bottom of the [[frying pan]] when the pan is tilted. It may form some bubbles during cooking, which results in a pale pancake with dark spots where the bubbles were, but the pancake does not rise. English pancakes are similar to [[French cuisine|French]] [[crêpe]]s, and [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] [[crespelle]], but are not "lacy" in appearance. They may be eaten as a sweet dessert with the traditional topping of lemon juice and sugar, drizzled with [[golden syrup]], or wrapped around savory stuffings and eaten as a main course. [[Yorkshire pudding]] is made from a similar recipe, but baked instead of fried. This batter rises because the air beaten into the batter expands, without the need for baking powder; the result is eaten as part of the traditional roast beef dinner. [[Oatcakes]] are a savory variety of pancake particularly associated with [[Staffordshire]]. '''Scotch pancakes''' are more like the American type and are served as such. In Scotland they are also referred to as ''drop scones'' or ''dropped scones''.<ref name="McNeill">McNeill, F. Marian (1929). ''The Scots Kitchen''.
