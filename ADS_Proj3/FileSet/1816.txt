Escutcheon is born on the breast of an American Eagle without any other supporters to denote that the United States of America ought to rely on their own Virtue. Reverse. The pyramid signifies Strength and Duration: The Eye over it & the Motto allude to the many signal interpositions of providence in favour of the American cause. The date underneath is that of the Declaration of Independence and the words under it signify the beginning of the new American Æra, which commences from that date.<ref>As quoted by {{cite web|url=http://www.greatseal.com/symbols/explanation.html |title= Explanation of the Great Seal's Symbolism|publisher=greatseal.com|first= John D.|last=MacArthur}}</ref>}} Thomson took the symbolism for the colors from a book called ''Elements of Heraldy'' by Antoine Pyron du Martre, which [[William Barton (heraldist)|William Barton]] had lent to him.<ref name="dumartre">''The Eagle and the Shield'', pp. 80-81. There is an edition of ''Elements of Heraldy'' on [http://books.google.com/books?id=LyYIAAAAQAAJ Google Books]; the claimed color definitions are in its glossary.</ref> That book claimed that argent (white) "signifies Purity, Innocence, Beauty, and Genteelness", gules (red) "denotes martial Prowess, Boldness, and Hardiness", and azure (blue) "signifies Justice, Perseverance, and Vigilance".<ref name="dumartre"/> ====Symbolism of items numbering thirteen==== In honor of the fact that there were originally thirteen States in the Union, the inclusion of items consisting of this number is a common motif in the seal. The official description of the seal states that there should be thirteen stars in the "glory" above the eagle's head, thirteen stripes on the shield, and thirteen arrows in the eagle’s talon. The initial description of the reverse specified thirteen [[step pyramid|levels to the pyramid]], and though the number was left out of the final version, all depictions typically still show thirteen levels. Also by custom, since 1885 there are thirteen leaves and olives on the olive branch. The fact that there are thirteen letters in two of the mottos ("e pluribus unum" and "annuit cœptis") seems to be coincidental (and depends on whether one considers the ligature "[[œ]]" to be one letter or two). ==Seal press== [[File:GreatSealPress.jpg|thumb|The press and cabinet, made in 1903]] In the Department of State, the term "Great Seal" includes not just the die, but also the counterdie, the press, and cabinet in which it is housed.<ref name="statepub"/> There have been several presses used since the seal was introduced, but none of the mechanisms used from 1782 through 1904 have survived. The seal, and apparently its press, was saved when [[Burning of Washington|Washington, D.C. was burned]] in 1814 though no one knows by whom.<ref name="state225press">{{cite web|url=http://diplomacy.state.gov/exhibitions/101354.htm|title=Keeping the Seal in Good Hands|publisher=U.S. Diplomacy Center|accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref><ref name="eagleshield">{{cite book|last=Patterson|first=Richard S.|coauthors=Richardson Dougall|title=The Eagle and the Shield|year=1978|publisher=[[United States Department of State|Department of State]]|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|oclc=4268298}}</ref> [[File:Great Seal press 1955.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Clydia Mae Richardson, who led the effort to put the seal on display, and [[John Foster Dulles]] imprint a document during the 1955 ceremony]] The press in use today was made in 1903 by R. Hoe & Co's chief cabinetmaker Frederick S. Betchley in conjunction with the 1904 die, with the cabinet being made of mahogany. It is marked with the contracted completion date of June 15, 1903, but delays and reworking pushed final delivery into early 1904. From 1945 to 1955, the Great Seal changed quarters almost once a year. In 1955, the seal was put on public display for the first time in a central location in the Department's main building. In 1961 the Seal became the focus of the new Department Exhibit Hall, where it resides today in a glass enclosure. The enclosure remains locked at all times, even during the sealing of a document.<ref name="statepub"/><ref name="state225press"/><ref name="eagleshield"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/rls/dos/9087.htm|title=Great Seal Fact Sheet|accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref> The seal can only be affixed by an officer of the Department of State, under the authority of the Secretary of State. To seal a document, first a blank paper wafer is glued onto its front in a space provided for it. The document is then placed between the die and counterdie, with the wafer lined up between them. Holding the document with one hand, the weighted arm of the press is pulled with the other, driving the die down onto the wafer, impressing the seal in relief. When envelopes containing letters need to be sealed, the wafer is imprinted first and then glued to the sealed envelope. It is used approximately 2,000 to 3,000 times a year.<ref name="statepub"/> Documents which require the seal include treaty ratifications, international agreements, appointments of ambassadors and civil officers, and communications from the President to heads of foreign governments. The seal was once required on presidential [[proclamation]]s, and on some now-obsolete documents such as [[exequatur]]s and [[Mediterranean pass]]ports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://diplomacy.state.gov/exhibitions/101355.htm|title=Redefining the Seal's Use}} and {{cite web|url=http://diplomacy.state.gov/exhibitions/101356.htm|title=Using the Seal as the Nation Expands|publisher=U.S. Diplomacy Center|accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref> <center> <gallery perrow="4">File:GreatSealWafer.jpg|A seal wafer File:GreatSealCounterdie.jpg|The wafer is positioned over the counterdie File:GreatSealPressImprinting.jpg|The seal is pressed down on the wafer File:GreatSealWaferImprinted.jpg|The imprinted seal </gallery></center> ==History== On July 4, 1776, the same day that independence from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] was declared by the thirteen states, the [[Second Continental Congress|Continental Congress]] named the first committee to design a Great Seal, or national emblem, for the country. Similar to other nations, The United States of America needed an official symbol of sovereignty to formalize and seal (or sign) international treaties and transactions.
