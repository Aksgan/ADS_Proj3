is 57689. Now by applying all the Rules mentioned above, we get : 5 7 6 8 9 (Subtrahend) Add (+) 4 2 3 1 0 (“New Number” generated) 9 9 9 9 9 Now, because the number of digits are the same in both the Minuend and subtrahend, we do not subtract (-) “1” from the Minuend, but just leave it on the left side of the Highest Value Digit in terms of placement of the minuend and then put the “New Number” generated mentally, as above, exactly under the Minuend, as below : '''(-1)''' 7 6 5 8 4 Add (+) 4 2 3 1 (0 + 1) OR as below : '''(-1)''' '''‘7’''' 6 5 8 4 Add (+) '''‘4’''' 2 3 1 1 Now, by simply adding the above, we shall get the answer, and because the figures '''‘7’''' of the minuend & '''‘4’''' of the “New Number” add upto '''“11”''', we leave '''“1” (Units Value)''' on the product & carry-forward the '''“1” of the ‘Ten’s’ Value''', to '''“CANCEL”''' itself with the '''(-) “1”''' of the Minuend, which we had left on the side of the Minuend, as below : ‘7’ 6 5 8 4 Add (+) ‘4’ 2 3 1 1 ‘1’ 8 8 9 5 we have the answer. Hence we get the answer = 18895, because carry-forwarding '''“1”''' ( '''by adding “7” of the Minuend & “4” of the Subtrahend, which were the numbers on the “Highest” Value placement'''), '''“CANCELLED”''' itself with the '''(-) “1”''' that was left on the side of the Minuend when we followed 'Rule 4' mentioned above. This we have to do, when the number of digits are the same as the Minuend & the Subtrahend, as mentioned above. Having said the above, please also note, that it may not always be the case that there may be any "carry-over" happening, so to say, that in case the Highest integers of the Minuend & the "New Number" add up to say "7" (i.e. if the Highest value of the Minuend is "4" & that of the "New Number" is let's say "3"), then the (-) "1" that we put on the left side of the Minuend, will automatically reduce the Highest placed digit of the Minuend, to get the result. Try doing the above on any numbers, Big or Small, even if they are in Decimals and you shall always get the correct result, as long as you follow all the RULES mentioned above. Another ‘Tip’ is to convert the last ‘Unit’ placed digit of the “New Number” directly to “10” instead of “9”, then you don’t need to add “1” like I did above. NOTE: In case the Subtrahend is larger than the Minuend, the two numbers will interchange themselves in their roles, i.e. the Minuend becomes Subtrahend & vice-versa, and a (-) negative sign will appear next to the answer, as is the case in any method of subtraction.</text> </page> <page> <id>36088</id> <title>Successor cardinal</title> <text>In the theory of [[cardinal numbers]], we can define a '''successor''' operation similar to that in the [[ordinal number]]s. This coincides with the ordinal successor operation for finite cardinals, but in the infinite case they diverge because every infinite ordinal and its successor have the same [[cardinality]] (a [[bijection]] can be set up between the two by simply sending the last element of the successor to 0, 0 to 1, etc., and fixing ω and all the elements above; in the style of Hilbert's [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel|Hotel Infinity]]). Using the [[von Neumann cardinal assignment]] and the [[axiom of choice]] (AC), this successor operation is easy to define: for a cardinal number κ we have :<math>\kappa^+ = |\inf \{ \lambda \in ON \ |\ \kappa < |\lambda| \}|</math> , where ON is the class of ordinals. That is, the successor cardinal is the cardinality of the least ordinal into which a set of the given cardinality can be mapped one-to-one, but which cannot be mapped one-to-one back into that set. That the set above is nonempty follows from [[Hartogs number|Hartogs' theorem]], which says that for any [[well-order]]able cardinal, a larger such cardinal is constructible. The minimum actually exists because the ordinals are well-ordered. It is therefore immediate that there is no cardinal number in between κ and κ<sup>+</sup>. A '''successor cardinal''' is a cardinal which is κ<sup>+</sup> for some cardinal κ. In the infinite case, the successor operation skips over many ordinal numbers; in fact, every infinite cardinal is a [[limit ordinal]]. Therefore, the successor operation on cardinals gains a lot of power in the infinite case (relative the ordinal successorship operation), and consequently the cardinal numbers are a very "sparse" subclass of the ordinals. We define the sequence of [[aleph number|alephs]] (via the [[axiom of replacement]]) via this operation, through all the ordinal numbers as follows: :<math>\aleph_0 = \omega</math> :<math>\aleph_{\alpha+1} = \aleph_{\alpha}^+</math> and for λ an infinite limit ordinal, :<math>\aleph_{\lambda} = \bigcup_{\beta < \lambda} \aleph_\beta</math> If β is a [[successor ordinal]], then <math>\aleph_{\beta}</math> is a successor cardinal. Cardinals which are not successor cardinals are called [[limit cardinal]]s; and by the above definition, if λ is a limit ordinal, then <math>\aleph_{\lambda}</math> is a limit cardinal. The standard definition above is restricted to the case when the cardinal can be well-ordered, i.e. is finite or an aleph. Without the axiom of choice, there are cardinals which cannot be well-ordered. Some mathematicians have defined the successor of such a cardinal as the cardinality of the least ordinal which cannot be mapped one-to-one into a set of the given cardinality. That is: :<math>\kappa^+ = |\inf \{ \lambda \in ON \ |\ |\lambda| \nleq \kappa \}|</math> . ==See also== *[[cardinal assignment]] == References == *[[Paul Halmos]], ''Naive set theory''.
