Gonthier, Abadi and Levy have further shown that GoI allows better analysis of Lamping's algorithm.

If the polynomial has real coefficients, its roots are either real, or else occur as [[complex conjugate]]s. Suppose a polynomial ''P''(''x'') is graphed as ''y'' = ''P''(''x''). At a real root, the graph of the polynomial crosses the ''x''-axis. Thus, the real roots of a polynomial can be demonstrated graphically.<ref>{{citation |title=A graphical approach to understanding the fundamental theorem of algebra |author=Sudhir Kumar Goel, Denise T.
