is technically possible not just to secure the hardware for its owner, but also to ''secure against its owner''. Such controversy has led opponents of trusted computing, such as [[Richard Stallman]], to refer to it instead as '''treacherous computing''', even to the point where some scholarly articles have begun to place [[scare quotes]] around "trusted computing".<ref name="anderson2">[http://www.springerlink.com/content/v8571w5420l26q08/ Ross Anderson, "Cryptography and Competition Policy - Issues with ‘Trusted Computing’ ", in ''Economics of Information Security'', from series ''Advances in Information Security'', Vol. 12, April 11, 2006.]</ref><ref>[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fms27/papers/2003-stajano-shifting.pdf F.

It is possible to leave to the owner rights of authorization and have no centralized authority. It is also possible to build open source stack of trusted modules, leaving for the security chip only the task to guard against unauthorized modifications. Open source Linux drivers exist <ref>[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/opencryptoki/2.2.5+dfsg-1ubuntu1.3 Ubuntu opencryptoki package]</ref> to access and use the trusted computing chip.

The private key never leaves the chip, while the public key is used for attestation and for encryption of sensitive data sent to the chip, as occurs during the TPM_TakeOwnership command.—David Safford<ref>{{cite web | author = [[David Safford|Safford, David]] | url = http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6633 | title = Take Control of TCPA | date = 2006-10-27 | accessdate = 2007-02-07 | work = Linux Journal }}</ref> This key is used to allow the executions of secure transactions: every Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is required to be able sign a random number (in order to allow the owner to show that he has a genuine trusted computer), using a particular protocol created by the Trusted Computing Group (the [[direct anonymous attestation]] protocol) in order to ensure its compliance of the TCG standard and to prove its identity; this makes it impossible for a software TPM emulator with an untrusted endorsement key (for example, a self-generated one) to start a secure transaction with a trusted entity. The TPM should be designed to make the extraction of this key by hardware analysis hard, but tamper-resistance is not a strong requirement. ===Memory curtaining=== Memory curtaining extends common [[memory protection]] techniques to provide full isolation of sensitive areas of memory—for example, locations containing cryptographic keys.
