the question, 'Can machines think?'" Since "thinking" is difficult to define, Turing chooses to "replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words."<ref name=T433/> Turing's new question is: "Are there imaginable digital computers which would do well in the <nowiki>[</nowiki>Turing test<nowiki>]</nowiki>"?<ref>{{Harv|Turing|1950|p=442}} This particular version of the test was called "The Imitation Game". Turing continues with a more technical version: "these questions [are] equivalent to this, 'Let us fix our attention on one particular digital computer C. Is it true that by modifying this computer to have an adequate storage, suitably increasing its speed of action, and providing it with an appropriate programme, C can be made to play satisfactorily the part of A in the imitation game, the part of B being taken by a man?'" {{Harv|Turing|1950|p=442}}</ref> This question, Turing believed, is one that can actually be answered. In the remainder of the paper, he argued against all the major objections to the proposition that "machines can think".<ref name=RN948/> In the years since 1950, the test has proven to be both highly influential and widely criticized, and it is an essential concept in the [[philosophy of artificial intelligence]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Saygin|Cicekli|Akman|2000}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp= 2â€“3 and 948}}</ref> <!-- To date, there are no machines that can convincingly pass the test.<ref>{{Citation|last=Gibb|first=Barry|title=The Rough Guide to the Brain|publisher=Rough Guides Ltd.|location=London|year=2007|pages=236}}</ref> --><!-- This statement seems at least doubtful: Loebner prize judges are frequently being fooled by contestants, see below. Turing would probably reject '''convincingly''' as the kind of terminology that his test set out to avoid. --> ==History== ===Philosophical background=== The question of whether it is possible for machines to think has a long history, which is firmly entrenched in the distinction between [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]] and [[materialism|materialist]] views of the mind. From the perspective of dualism, the [[mind]] is [[non-physical entity|non-physical]] (or, at the very least, has [[property dualism|non-physical properties]])<ref>For an example of property dualism, see [[Qualia]].</ref> and, therefore, cannot be explained in purely physical terms. The materialist perspective argues that the mind can be explained physically, and thus leaves open the possibility of minds that are artificially produced.<ref>Noting that materialism does not ''necessitate'' the possibility of artificial minds (for example, [[Roger Penrose#Physics and consciousness|Roger Penrose]]), any more than dualism necessarily ''precludes'' the possibility. (See, for example, [[Property dualism]].)</ref> In 1936, philosopher [[Alfred Ayer]] considered the standard philosophical question of [[other minds problem|other minds]]: how do we know that other people have the same conscious experiences that we do? In his book ''[[Language, Truth and Logic]]'' Ayer suggested a protocol to distinguish between a conscious man and an unconscious machine: "The only ground I can have for asserting that an object which appears to be conscious is not really a conscious being, but only a dummy or a machine, is that it fails to satisfy one of the empirical tests by which the presence or absence of consciousness is determined."<ref>{{cite book | last=Ayer | first=A.

Ayer | title=Language, Truth and Logic| p=140 | publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin]] | year=2001}}</ref> (This suggestion is very similar to the Turing test, but it is not certain that Ayer's popular philosophical classic was familiar to Turing.) ===Alan Turing=== Researchers in the [[United Kingdom]] had been exploring "machine intelligence" for up to ten years prior to the founding of the field of AI research in 1956.<ref>The [[Dartmouth conference]]s of 1956 are widely considered the "birth of AI". {{Harv|Crevier|1993|p=49}}</ref> It was a common topic among the members of the [[Ratio Club]] who were an informal group of British [[cybernetics]] and [[electronics]] researchers that included [[Alan Turing]], after whom the test is named.<ref>{{Harvnb|McCorduck|2004|p=95}}</ref> Turing, in particular, had been tackling the notion of machine intelligence since at least 1941<ref>{{Harvnb|Copeland|2003|p=1}}</ref> and one of the earliest-known mentions of "computer intelligence" was made by him in 1947.<ref>{{Harvnb|Copeland|2003|p=2}}</ref> In Turing's report, "Intelligent Machinery", he investigated "the question of whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour"<ref>{{Harvnb|Turing|1948|p=412}}</ref> and, as part of that investigation, proposed what may be considered the forerunner to his later tests: <blockquote>It is not difficult to devise a paper machine which will play a not very bad game of chess.<ref>In 1948, working with his former undergraduate colleague, [[DG Champernowne]], Turing began writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist and, in 1952, lacking a computer powerful enough to execute the program, played a game in which he simulated it, taking about half an hour over each move. The game was recorded, and the program lost to Turing's colleague [[Alick Glennie]], although it is said that it won a game against Champernowne's wife.</ref> Now get three men as subjects for the experiment. A, B and C. A and C are to be rather poor chess players, B is the operator who works the paper machine. ... Two rooms are used with some arrangement for communicating moves, and a game is played between C and either A or the paper machine. C may find it quite difficult to tell which he is playing.</blockquote> When Turing published "[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]" he had been considering the possibility of artificial intelligence for many years, though this was the first published paper by Turing to focus exclusively on the notion.<ref>"Intelligent Machinery" was not published by Turing, and did not see publication until 1968 in Evans, C. R. & Robertson, A. D. J. (1968) ''Cybernetics: Key Papers,'' University Park Press.</ref> Turing begins his 1950 paper with the claim "I propose to consider the question 'Can machines think?'"<ref name="T433">{{Harvnb|Turing|1950|p=433}}</ref> As he highlights, the traditional approach to such a question is to start with [[definition]]s, defining both the terms "machine" and "intelligence". Turing chooses not to do so; instead he replaces the question with a new one, "which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words."<ref name=T433/> In essence he proposes to change the question from "Do machines think?" to "Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?"<ref>{{Harvnb|Harnad|2004|p=1}}</ref> The advantage of the new question, Turing argues, is that it draws "a
