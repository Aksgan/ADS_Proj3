content and advertising support for HealthBoards. HealthBoards is currently ranked in the top 20,000 websites worldwide in terms of traffic by [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]]. ==History== HealthBoards was founded by site owner and current President/CEO Chuck Simmons. In 1997, after experiencing a variety of symptoms for which doctors had no explanation, Simmons turned to the Web for answers and support. When he did not find online [[support groups]] in the areas he needed, he decided to develop a health support site covering a wide range of health topics. After a year of development, the site launched with 70 message boards. By 2000, the site had grown to over 90 boards. Since then, the site has experienced steady growth. ==Operation== On HealthBoards all health topics are given individual message boards. Each message board typically contains thousands of discussion threads, each relating to a specific question or comment initiated by a HealthBoards user. Participation on HealthBoards requires free registration. Users who register must supply an email address and login name. Users who are not registered may still view all the contents of the message boards, but cannot post messages. Anonymous posting is not allowed. The boards are moderated by a large staff of mostly volunteers. Users who violate the participation policy are temporarily banned from using the site. Repeat violations usually result in a permanent ban. Due to the extremely tight control that the moderators keep over the board people are often unable to get the full picture of available resources as they ban anyone who submits links to outside resources or tries to exchange emails so they may speak in private. Any information that the moderators disagree with is censored and made unavailable for members to view and decide about themselves. There are numerous complaints around the internet about the behavior of the site staff and the draconian and misapplied moderation.{{Fact|date=May 2009}} ==See also== * [[WebMD]] ==External links== *[http://www.healthboards.com/ HealthBoards.com] *[http://healthboards.webmd.com/ WebMD - HealthBoards co-branded site] *[http://www.healthratings.org/ Consumer Reports HealthRatings.org top 20 health information websites] [[Category:Virtual communities|HealthBoards]] [[Category:Community websites|HealthBoards]] [[Category:Internet forums|HealthBoards]] [[Category:Health websites|HealthBoards]] [[Category:American websites|Healthboards]]</text> </page> <page> <id>16434</id> <title>Health Level 7</title> <text>{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}} '''Health Level Seven''' ('''HL7'''), is an all-volunteer, [[non-profit organization]] involved in development of international [[healthcare]] standards.<ref name=about>{{cite web|title=About Health Level Seven|publisher=Health Level Seven|url=http://www.hl7.org/about/index.cfm}}</ref> "HL7" is also used to refer to some of the specific standards created by the organization (e.g., HL7 v2.x, v3.0, HL7 [[Reference Information Model|RIM]]).{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} HL7 and its members provide a framework (and related standards) for the exchange, integration, sharing, and retrieval of electronic health information. v2.x of the standards, which support clinical practice and the management, delivery, and evaluation of [[health service]]s, are the most commonly used in the world.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} ==Organization== HL7 is an international community of healthcare subject matter experts and information scientists collaborating to create standards for the exchange, management and integration of electronic healthcare information.<ref>www.hl7.org</ref> HL7 promotes the use of such standards within and among healthcare organizations to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of healthcare delivery for the benefit of all.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The HL7 community is organized in the form of a global organization (Health Level Seven, Inc.) and country-specific affiliate organizations: *Health Level Seven, Inc.

The first affiliate organization was created in Germany in 1993.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The organizational structure of HL7 Inc. is as follows:{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} *The organization is managed by a Board of Directors, which comprises 10 elected positions and three appointed positions. *The Chief Executive Officer (currently Charles Jaffe, MD, PhD) serves as an ex officio member of and reports to the Board of Directors. The Chief Technology Officer (currently John Quinn); and the Chief Operations Officer (currently Mark McDougall) report to the CEO and also serve as ex officio members on the Board of Directors. *Members of HL7 are known collectively as "The Working Group". The Working Group is responsible for defining the HL7 standard protocol and is composed of Standing Administrative Committees and Working Groups. **''Standing Administrative committees'' focus on organizational or promotional activities, such as Education, Implementation, Marketing, Outreach Committee for Clinical Research, Publishing and Process Improvement and Tooling. **''Working groups'' are directly responsible for the content of the Standards, framing the actual language of the specifications. ===Origin=== HL7 was founded in 1987 to produce a standard for [[hospital information system]]s. HL7, Inc. is a [[standards organization]] that was accredited in 1994 by the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI).<ref>http://www.ansi.org/ ANSI</ref> HL7 is one of several American National Standards Institute accredited Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs) operating in the healthcare arena. Most SDOs produce standards (sometimes called specifications or protocols) for a particular healthcare domain such as pharmacy, medical devices, imaging or insurance (claims processing) transactions. Health Level Seven’s domain is clinical and administrative data. Today, HL7 has been adopted by several national SDOs outside the United States. Those SDOs are consequently not accredited by ANSI. However, HL7 is now adopted by ISO as a centre of gravity in international standardization and accredited as a partnering organization for mutual issuing of standards. The first mutually published standard is ISO/HL7 21731:2006 Health informatics—HL7 version 3—Reference information model—Release 1. ==== The name "Health Level-7" ==== The name "Health Level-7" is a reference to the seventh layer of the [[OSI model|ISO OSI Reference model]] also known as the application layer. The name indicates that HL7 focuses on application layer protocols for the health care domain, independent of lower layers. HL7 effectively considers all lower layers merely as tools.<ref name=about/> ===Collaboration=== HL7 collaborates with other standards development organizations and national and international sanctioning bodies (e.g. ANSI and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]), in both the healthcare and information infrastructure domains to promote the use of supportive and compatible standards. HL7 collaborates with healthcare information technology users to ensure that HL7 standards meet real-world requirements, and that appropriate standards development efforts are initiated by HL7 to meet emergent requirements.{{Citation
