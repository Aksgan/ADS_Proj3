through encrypted channels==== The risk of interception of passwords sent over the Internet can be reduced by, among other approaches, using [[cryptography|cryptographic]] protection. The most widely used is the [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS, previously called [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]]) feature built into most current Internet [[Web browser|browsers]]. Most browsers alert the user of a TLS/SSL protected exchange with a server by displaying a closed lock icon, or some other sign, when TLS is in use. There are several other techniques in use; see [[cryptography]]. ====Hash-based challenge-response methods==== Unfortunately, there is a conflict between stored hashed-passwords and hash-based [[challenge-response authentication]]; the latter requires a client to prove to a server that he knows what the [[shared secret]] (i.e., password) is, and to do this, the server must be able to obtain the shared secret from its stored form. On many systems (including [[Unix]]-type systems) doing remote authentication, the shared secret usually becomes the hashed form and has the serious limitation of exposing passwords to offline guessing attacks. In addition, when the hash is used as a shared secret, an attacker does not need the original password to authenticate remotely; he only needs the hash. ====Zero-knowledge password proofs==== Rather than transmitting a password, or transmitting the hash of the password, [[password-authenticated key agreement]] systems can perform a [[zero-knowledge password proof]], which proves knowledge of the password without exposing it. Moving a step further, augmented systems for [[password-authenticated key agreement]] (e.g., [[Authentication and key agreement via Memorable Passwords|AMP]], [[SPEKE|B-SPEKE]], [[PAK-Z]], [[Secure remote password protocol|SRP-6]]) avoid both the conflict and limitation of hash-based methods. An augmented system allows a client to prove knowledge of the password to a server, where the server knows only a (not exactly) hashed password, and where the unhashed password is required to gain access. ===Procedures for changing passwords=== Usually, a system must provide a way to change a password, either because a user believes the current password has been (or might have been) compromised, or as a precautionary measure. If a new password is passed to the system in unencrypted form, security can be lost (e.g., via wiretapping) even before the new password can even be installed in the password database. And, of course, if the new password is given to a compromised employee, little is gained. Some web sites include the user-selected password in an unencrypted confirmation e-mail message, with the obvious increased vulnerability. [[Identity management]] systems are increasingly used to automate issuance of replacements for lost passwords, a feature called [[self service password reset]]. The user's identity is verified by asking questions and comparing the answers to ones previously stored (i.e., when the account was opened). Typical questions include: "Where were you born?," "What is your favorite movie?" or "What is the name of your pet?" In many cases the answers to these questions can be relatively easily guessed by an attacker, determined by low effort research, or obtained through [[social engineering (computer security)|social engineering]], and so this is less than fully satisfactory as a verification technique. While many users have been trained never to reveal a password, few consider the name of their pet or favorite movie to require similar care. ===Password longevity=== "Password aging" is a feature of some operating systems which forces users to change passwords frequently (e.g., quarterly, monthly or even more often), with the intent that a stolen password will become unusable more or less quickly. Such policies usually provoke user protest and foot-dragging at best and hostility at worst. Users may develop simple variation patterns to keep their passwords memorable. In any case, the security benefits are distinctly limited, if worthwhile, because attackers often exploit a password as soon as it is compromised, which will probably be some time before change is required. In many cases, particularly with administrative or "root" accounts, once an attacker has gained access, he can make alterations to the operating system that will allow him future access even after the initial password he used expires. (see [[rootkit]]). Implementing such a policy requires careful consideration of the relevant human factors. It may be required because of the nature of IT systems the password allows access to; if personal data is involved the EU [[Data Protection Directive]] is in force. ===Number of users per password=== Sometimes a single password controls access to a device, for example, for a network router, or password-protected mobile phone. However, in the case of a [[computer security|computer system]], a password is usually stored for each user account, thus making all access traceable (save, of course, in the case of users sharing passwords). A would-be user on most systems must supply a username as well as a password, almost always at account set up time, and periodically thereafter. If the user supplies a password matching the one stored for the supplied username, he or she is permitted further access into the computer system. This is also the case for a cash machine, except that the 'user name' is typically the account number stored on the bank customer's card, and the PIN is usually quite short (4 to 6 digits). Allotting separate passwords to each user of a system is preferable to having a single password shared by legitimate users of the system, certainly from a security viewpoint. This is partly because users are more willing to tell another person (who may not be authorized) a shared password than one exclusively for their use. Single passwords are also much less convenient to change because many people need to be told at the same time, and they make removal of a particular user's access more difficult, as for instance on graduation or resignation. Per-user passwords are also essential if users are to be held accountable for their activities, such as making financial transactions or viewing medical records. ===Design of the protected software=== Common techniques used to improve the security of software systems protected by a password include: *Not displaying the password on the display screen as it is being entered or obscuring it as it is typed
