market price is higher than the free market price because the quantity is less than in a free market transaction, where more sellers could afford to sell the product. People are sometimes forced to buy at these higher prices when a shortage happens and there is no other place to obtain these. ====Discrimination==== If there is a shortage, sellers may discriminate among customers. In the case of rent control in [[New York City]], landlords have given rent-controlled apartments to celebrities over less-wealthy, non-famous people.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} ==Real World Examples== ===Rent Control in New York City=== [[Rent control]] is a price ceiling on rent. When soldiers returned from [[World War II]] and started families (which increased demand for apartments), but stopped receiving military pay, many could not deal with the jumping rent. The government put in price controls, so soldiers and their families could pay the rent and keep their homes. However, this increased the quantity demanded for apartments and lowered the quantity supplied, meaning that available apartments were rapidly taken until none were left for late-comers. Price ceilings create shortages when producers are allowed to abdicate market share or go unsubsidized. ===Apartment price control in Finland=== According to professors Niko Määttänen and Ari Hyytinen, price ceilings on [[Helsinki]] City Hitas apartments make no sense. They cause queuing, and discriminate against the handicapped, single parents, elderly, and others not able to queue for days. They cause inefficient allocation, as apartments are not bought by those willing to pay the most for them&mdash;and those who get an apartment are unwilling to leave it, even when their family or work situation changes, since they can't sell it at what they feel the market price should be. These inefficiencies increase apartment shortage and raise the market price of other apartments. <ref name=atb>[http://blog.hse-econ.fi/?p=2246 Onko Hitas-järjestelmässä mitään järkeä?], professor Niku Määttänen 16.4.2010 & professor Ari Hyytinen 17.4.2010, Akateeminen talousblogi (in Finnish)</ref> ===Coulter Law in VFL=== As a result of declining competitive balance following the admission of [[Footscray Football Club|Footscray]], [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] and [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] in 1925<ref>[http://www.otemon.ac.jp/cas/pdf/30/anne.pdf Daly Anne and Akira Kawaguchi; '''Competitive Balance in Australian and Japanese Sport''']</ref><ref>[http://www.buseco.monash.edu.au/eco/research/papers/2005/0205competitivebalancesports.pdf Booth, Ross; Comparing Competitive Balance in Australian Sports Leagues, The AFL, NBL and NRL: Does The AFL's Team Salary Cap and Player Draft Measure Up?; p. 30]</ref>, the [[Australian Football League|VFL]] introduced a [[wage ceiling|ceiling wage]] of £3 (around 160 [[Australian dollars]] at 2008 prices) in 1930. Known as the '''Coulter Law''' after George Coulter, it was varied several times before finally being abolished in 1968, being cut in half during [[World War II]] and increased in line with [[inflation]] after the war. In its early years, poorer clubs did not have the money to pay their players even the legal wage, and [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] preferred to give its players jobs rather than payments, but some clubs such as [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] did pay above the legal wage. The Coulter Law was a strictly ''binding'' price ceiling through its history, mainly for top players such as [[Ron Todd (footballer)|Ron Todd]], [[John Coleman]] and [[Brian Gleeson]]. In the case of Todd, it led to him moving to the [[Victorian Football Association|VFA]] because he was dissatisfied with the pay he could legally get with [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]]<ref>Main, Jim and Holmesby, Russell (editors); '''The Encyclopedia of League Footballers''' (1st edition); p. 438.
