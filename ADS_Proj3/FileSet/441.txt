airline cargo for explosives. Pharmaceutical companies wish to combinatorially screen drug candidates against target enzymes. To achieve these ends, [[DNA]], [[RNA]], [[proteins]], and even living cells are being employed as sensing mediators on biochips (Potera, 2008). Numerous transduction methods can be employed including [[surface plasmon resonance]], [[fluorescence]], and [[chemiluminescence]]. The particular sensing and transduction techniques chosen depend on factors such as price, sensitivity, and reusability. ==Microarray fabrication== The microarray &mdash; the dense, two-dimensional grid of biosensors &mdash; is the critical component of a biochip platform. Typically, the sensors are deposited on a flat substrate, which may either be passive (''e.g.'' silicon or glass) or active, the latter consisting of integrated electronics or [[microtechnology|micromechanical]] devices that perform or assist signal transduction. [[Surface chemistry]] is used to [[covalent bond|covalently bind]] the sensor molecules to the substrate medium. The fabrication of microarrays is non-trivial and is a major economic and technological hurdle that may ultimately decide the success of future biochip platforms. The primary manufacturing challenge is the process of placing each sensor at a specific position (typically on a [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] grid) on the substrate. Various means exist to achieve the placement, but typically robotic micro-pipetting (Schena, 1995) or micro-printing (MacBeath, 1999) systems are used to place tiny spots of sensor material on the chip surface. Because each sensor is unique, only a few spots can be placed at a time. The low-throughput nature of this process results in high manufacturing costs. Fodor and colleagues developed a unique fabrication process (later used by [[Affymetrix]]) in which a series of microlithography steps is used to [[Combinatorial chemistry|combinatorially synthesize]] hundreds of thousands of unique, single-stranded DNA sensors on a substrate one [[nucleotide]] at a time (Fodor, 1991; Pease, 1994). One lithography step is needed per base type; thus, a total of four steps is required per nucleotide level. Although this technique is very powerful in that many sensors can be created simultaneously, it is currently only feasible for creating short DNA strands (15&ndash;25 nucleotides). Reliability and cost factors limit the number of photolithography steps that can be done. Furthermore, light-directed combinatorial synthesis techniques are not currently possible for proteins or other sensing molecules. As noted above, most microarrays consist of a Cartesian grid of sensors. This approach is used chiefly to map or "encode" the coordinate of each sensor to its function. Sensors in these arrays typically use a universal signalling technique (''e.g.'' fluorescence), thus making coordinates their only identifying feature. These arrays must be made using a serial process (''i.e.'' requiring multiple, sequential steps) to ensure that each sensor is placed at the correct position. "Random" fabrication, in which the sensors are placed at arbitrary positions on the chip, is an alternative to the serial method. The tedious and expensive positioning process is not required, enabling the use of parallelized self-assembly techniques. In this approach, large batches of identical sensors can be produced; sensors from each batch are then combined and assembled into an array. A non-coordinate based encoding scheme must be used to identify each sensor. As the figure shows, such a design was first demonstrated (and later commercialized by Illumina) using functionalized beads placed randomly in the wells of an etched [[fiber optic]] cable (Steemers, 2000; Michael, 1998) Each bead was uniquely encoded with a fluorescent signature. However, this encoding scheme is limited in the number of unique dye combinations that can be used and successfully differentiated. ==Protein biochip array and other microarray technologies== [[Microarray]]s are not limited to [[DNA]] analysis; [[protein microarray]]s, [[antibody microarray]], [[chemical compound microarray]] can also be produced using biochips. [http://www.randox.com Randox] Laboratories Ltd. launched Evidence, the first protein Biochip Array Technology analyzer in 2003. In protein Biochip Array Technology, the biochip replaces the [[ELISA]] plate or [[cuvette]] as the reaction platform. The biochip is used to simultaneously analyze a panel of related tests in a single sample, producing a [[patient]] profile. The patient profile can be used in disease screening, [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]], monitoring disease progression or monitoring treatment. Performing multiple analyses simultaneously, described as multiplexing, allows a significant reduction in processing time and the amount of patient sample required. Biochip Array Technology is a novel application of a familiar methodology, using sandwich, competitive and antibody-capture [[immunoassay]]s. The difference from conventional immunoassays is that the capture ligands are covalently attached to the surface of the biochip in an ordered array rather than in solution. In sandwich assays an enzyme-labelled antibody is used; in competitive assays an enzyme-labelled antigen is used. On antibody-antigen binding a [[chemiluminescence]] reaction produces light. Detection is by a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) camera. The CCD camera is a sensitive and high-resolution sensor able to accurately detect and quantify very low levels of light. The test regions are located using a grid pattern then the chemiluminescence signals are analysed by imaging software to rapidly and simultaneously quantify the individual analytes.
