set of actions and observations", implying that one or more treatments (fertilizer, subsidized school lunches, etc.) is imposed on the system under study. Long-term experiments therefore contrast with nonexperimental long-term studies in which manipulation of the system studied is impossible (Jupiter's [[Great Red Spot]]) or undesirable (field observations of [[chimpanzee]] behavior). ==Physics== Visible sunspot measurements have been made since the 18th century. The [[Oxford Electric Bell]] has been ringing at [[Oxford University]] since 1840, although there is some reason to believe it may be 15 years older. The [[Beverly Clock]] at the [[University of Otago]] has been running since 1864. The [[pitch drop experiment]] has been running at the [[University of Queensland]] since 1927. [[Arthur Covington]]'s microwave solar observatory has been running since 1947, currently at the [[Dominion Astrophysical Observatory]]. ==Long-term agricultural field experiments== Long-term experiments test the sustainability of different farming practices, as measured by yield trends over decades. Examples include the [[Rothamsted Experimental Station]] (1843–present), the [[Morrow Plots]] (1876–present), Alabama's [[Old Rotation]] (1896–present), and the [[Haughley Experiment]] (1939-1972?). Experiments at Rothamsted showed that "grain yields can be sustained (and even increased) for almost 150 years in monocultures of wheat and barley given organic or inorganic fertilizer annually"<ref>Agronomy Journal 83:2-10</ref>. These results show that practices considered unsustainable by some advocates of [[sustainable agriculture]] may preserve "the ability of a farm to produce perpetually", at least under some circumstances. But even if [[crop diversity]] in space or time ([[crop rotation]]) and organic inputs are not always essential to sustainability, there is abundant evidence from Rothamsted and elsewhere that they are often beneficial. The Haughley Experiment was noteworthy as a rare example of a long-term experiment in organic farming without external inputs of nutrients. After about 30 years, however, it was decided to start importing manure. There is some disagreement whether a "decline in relative yields from the organic section" was due to a depletion of soil nutrients<ref>Agriculture Ecosystems and Environment 30:1-26</ref>. Various short-term experiments have used legumes (in symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing [[rhizobia]]) as a nitrogen source, but good short-term yields do not prove the system is sustainable. The problem is that release of nitrogen from soil organic matter can make up any shortfall of nitrogen from legumes for a decade or more. The Old Rotation showed that nitrogen from legumes can balance N removed in a harvested crop over the long term. A key point is that the N in the legumes was not removed, as it would be with a soybean crop, but was plowed under as a green manure. In the Old Rotation, the green manure was grown during the winter to supply N to a summer crop (cotton); this would be less practical in colder climates. Long-term agricultural experiments that have been started more recently include the Long-Term Research on Agricultural Systems experiments at UC Davis, started in 1993. ==Long-term ecological experiments== The US National Science Foundation supports a number of long-term ecological experiments, mostly in ecosystems that are less directly impacted by humans than most agricultural ecosystems are. See [[LTER]]. ==Long-term experiments in evolutionary biology== The experiments of [[Richard Lenski]] on [[E. coli long-term evolution experiment|evolution of E. coli]] have been underway for more than 20,000 generations.<ref>PNAS June 10, 2008 vol.105 no.23 7899-7906</ref> Experiments with the evolution of maize under artificial selection for oil and protein content <ref>Crop Science 9:179-181</ref> represent more years but far fewer generations (only 65). ==Medicine== The Laboratory of Adult Development in the Department of Psychiatry at [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]], a [[Harvard Medical School]] affiliate, is conducting a [[longitudinal study]] of human [[adult development]], by following two groups of individuals (268 [[Harvard University|Harvard]] graduates and 456 males from inner-city [[Boston]]) as they age. The study has been ongoing for 68 years and is currently the longest running study of adult life ever conducted.<ref>http://adultdev.bwh.harvard.edu/research-SAD.html</ref> ==References== {{reflist}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Long-Term Experiment}} [[Category:Experiments]] [[Category:Agriculture]]</text> </page> <page> <id>22638</id> <title>Loop device</title> <text>{{redirect|Lofi|the sound recording technique|Lo-fi}} In [[Unix-like]] operating systems, a '''loop device''', '''vnd''' (vnode disk), or '''lofi''' (loopback file interface) is a [[device node|pseudo-device]] that makes a [[computer file|file]] accessible as a [[device file system|block device]]. Before use, a loop device must be connected to an existing file in the filesystem. The association provides the user with an [[API]] that allows the file to be used in place of a block special file (cf. [[device file system]]). Thus, if the file contains an entire [[file system]], the file may then be [[mount (computing)|mounted]] as if it were a disk device. Files of this kind are often used for CD [[ISO image]]s and floppy disc images. Mounting a file containing a filesystem via such a '''loop mount''' makes the files within that filesystem accessible. They appear in the [[mount point]] directory. A loop device may allow some kind of data elaboration during this redirection. For example, the device may be the unencrypted version of an encrypted file. In such a case, the file associated with a loop device may be another pseudo-device. This is mostly useful when this device contains an encrypted file system. If supported, the loop device is in this case the decrypted version of the original encrypted file and can therefore be mounted as if it were a normal filesystem. ==Uses of loop mounting== After mounting a file containing a filesystem, the files within the filesystem can be accessed through the usual filesystem interface of the operating system, without any need for special functionality, such as reading and writing to ISO images, in applications. Uses include managing and editing filesystem images meant for later normal use (especially CD or DVD images or installation systems) or permanent segregation of data in actual use (for example simulating removable media on a faster and more convenient hard disk or encapsulating encrypted filesystems). Loop devices have also been utilized in order to provide a way of installing operating systems within files on a hard drive without repartitioning the drive. ==Availability== Some confusion exists about the naming of the loop device under various operating systems. Various Unix-like operating systems provide the
