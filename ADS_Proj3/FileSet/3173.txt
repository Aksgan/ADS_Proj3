across the audio portal, with many high-ranking musicians leaving the portal in disgust, claiming only to return when the "system was fixed". Currently many users await the much anticipated 2011 site redesign to see if these problems do indeed get resolved. The Audio portal was shut down three separate times early in its lifetime, and is now a permanent feature. Wade Fulp has stated that this experience had a negative impact on many audio contributing users. This incident is cited as one of the reasons Ross was hired.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Audiences can rate songs from the audio portal and send them to other users, too. === Genres === When submitting a piece of music, the user can choose out of a list of predefined [[genres]] in order to better classify his song and make it easier for other people to sort through a list and find what they are looking for. The most popular genres are those which are basically electronic music, such as [[Techno]], [[Trance music|Trance]] and [[Dance music|Dance]]. When browsing through the Audio Portal, a person can choose to sort the list of Audio by genre in order to facilitate the search. {| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed" width="25%" |- ! colspan="2"| '''Complete list of Genres''' |- | Ambient || Bluegrass |- | Blues || Brit Pop |- | Classical || Classical Rock |- | Country || Dance |- | Drum N Bass || Dubstep |- | Funk || General Rock |- | Goth || Grunge |- | Heavy Metal || Hip Hop - Modern |- | Hip Hop - Olskool || House |- | Indie || Industrial |- | Jazz || Latin |- | Miscellaneous || New Wave |- | Pop || Punk |- | R&B || Ska |- | Techno || Trance |- | Video Game || Voice Acting |} === Achievements === When submitting to the portal, there are 3 achievements a user can strive for. One is the weekly top 5 - which is determined by highest score combined with amount of votes, taken between the hours of 12:00 and 12:05 AM Wednesday morning. Only songs submitted that week may qualify for this. The second achievement is the weekly top 30, which is determined the same way as the weekly top 5, but applies to all songs submitted ever. The third Achievement is to be featured on the frontpage of newgrounds. This is decided by the mods who shows up here, not by the user. Unfortunately this system has led to what people coin the "tuesday night zero voting spree" in which a flurry of zero voting occurs across the board in order to raise chances of one's own song entering the top 5 or the top 30. However it does have the benefit of keeping scores on newgrounds in the audio portal around the 4.40 range, much like fires in a forest help maintain growth and renewal. Being on either of these three achievements, or all 3, results in exponential amounts of views, votes downloads, and reviews of a song. Much more than one would have if they were simply on the audio portal genre charts. However being on these charts tends to expose your songs to more "realistic" voters, and most song's scores end up suffering as a result, with their song only being on the top 30 or top 5 once or twice in it's lifetime. Unfortunately with the introduction of the top 30 rankings on the individual genre charts means significantly less to users these days, with songs having a score of 5 generally being wiped off the top of the list by older users who see these users as simply attempting to raise their scores to the top. The charts fluctuate an extreme amount and placement on the charts no longer indicates any measure of quality in a song, as it did post 2007 redesign. == Art portal == The Art Portal was launched on June 18, 2009.<ref name="ArtPortal">{{cite news|url=http://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic/1072217|title=Art Portal!?|first=Rob|date=2009-06-18|publisher=Newgrounds|accessdate=2009-06-19}}</ref> Art submitted is generally subject to a creative commons license, similar to the Audio Portal, but users have the option of opting out of it. The Art Portal is intended to be a showcase of the best art created by the Newgrounds community; users are encouraged to submit art to the Portal, which will be automatically featured in a private gallery on their userpages. Experienced and skilled artists among the community are given the 'scouting' privilege, which allows them to authorize individual users to submit their art directly to the Art Portal, and also the ability to 'scout' other artwork. The intention of this system is to keep the art featured in the Art Portal to a relatively high level of quality, as it lacks a [[Newgrounds#Flash Portal|judgment]] system similar to the Flash Portal. Users who have been scouted and have submitted artwork of poor quality can lose their submission privileges. This has become common nowadays. Users can vote on the art, creating an average score for the artwork, but this does not accrue experience, unlike voting on animation submissions. A team of moderators oversees the scouting tree, pruning users who manage to take advantage of the system. If a user were to be removed from the tree, anyone who was recursively scouted in his branch would also be removed. This system was unique to image portals at the time of its inception and is the first known instance of such a system. === Attack === On September 6, 2009, the Art Portal was vandalized.<ref name="art_attack">{{cite web|url=http://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic/1101912|title=Something's Wrong W/ The Art Portal|publisher=Newgrounds BBS|date=2009-09-09|accessdate=2009-09-19}}</ref> A spam group [[Phishing|phished]] the Newgrounds account of an animator known as [http://egoraptor.newgrounds.com/ Egoraptor], by linking to a website using 'vv' (two 'v's) instead of 'w' (the actual letter 'w') in the URL.
