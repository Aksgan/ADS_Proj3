method for secure communication based on Wiesner’s “conjugate observables”. In 1990, independently and initially unaware of the earlier work, [[Artur Ekert]], then a Ph.D. student at [[Wolfson College, Oxford|Wolfson College, University of Oxford]], developed a different approach to quantum key distribution based on peculiar quantum correlations known as quantum entanglement. == Future == The current commercial systems are aimed mainly at governments and corporations with high security requirements. Key distribution by courier is typically used in such cases, where traditional key distribution schemes are not believed to offer enough guarantee. This has the advantage of not being intrinsically distance limited, and despite long travel times the transfer rate can be high due to the availability of large capacity portable storage devices. The major difference of quantum key distribution is the ability to detect any interception of the key, whereas with courier the key security cannot be proven or tested. QKD (Quantum Key Distribution) systems also have the advantage of being automatic, with greater reliability and lower operating costs than a secure human courier network. Factors preventing wide adoption of quantum key distribution outside high security areas include the cost of equipment, and the lack of a demonstrated threat to existing key exchange protocols. However, with optic fibre networks already present in many countries the infrastructure is in place for a more widespread use. == See also == * [[Quantum Cryptography]] * [[Quantum Computing]] * [[Quantum Information Science]] * [[List of quantum key distribution protocols]] * [[Quantum network]] ==External links== *'''General and Review''' ** [http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&articleID=000479CD-F58C-11BE-AD0683414B7F0000 Scientific American Magazine (January 2005 Issue) Best-Kept Secrets] Non-technical article on quantum cryptography ** [http://physicsweb.org/articles/world/20/3/4/1 Physics World Magazine (March 2007 Issue)] Non-technical article on current state and future of quantum communication ** [http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.4155 arXiv:0802.4155 (quant-ph)] February 2008 review of Quantum Cryptography ** [http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0702202 arXiv:quant-ph/0702202v3] March 2007 review of Quantum Cryptography ** [http://www.secoqc.net/downloads/secoqc_crypto_wp.pdf SECOQC White Paper on Quantum Key Distribution and Cryptography] European project to create a large scale quantum cryptography network, includes discussion of current QKD approaches and comparison with classical cryptography ** [http://obfusc.at/ed/cryptography_eng.html The future of cryptography] May 2003 Tomasz Grabowski ** [http://qist.lanl.gov/qcrypt_map.shtml ARDA Quantum Cryptography Roadmap] ** [http://www.quantware.ups-tlse.fr/IHP2006/ Lectures at the Institut Henri Poincaré (slides and videos)] ** [http://www.didaktik.physik.uni-erlangen.de/quantumlab/english/index.html Interactive quantum cryptography demonstration experiment with single photons for education] *'''More Specific Information''' ** Description of entanglement based quantum cryptography from Artur Ekert [http://pass.maths.org.uk/issue35/features/ekert/index.html] ** Description of BB84 protocol and privacy amplification [http://www.ai.sri.com/~goldwate/quantum.html] ** Original paper on the BB84 Protocol for Quantum Cryptography [http://quantum.bbn.com/dscgi/ds.py/Get/File-18/BB84.pdf] ** Original paper on Entanglement-based quantum cryptography [http://quantum.bbn.com/dscgi/ds.py/Get/File-369/Ekert_-_QKD_Based_On_Bells_Theorem.pdf] *'''Further Information''' ** [http://www.quantiki.org/ Quantiki.org - Quantum Information portal and wiki] ** [http://fredhenle.net/bb84/ Interactive BB84 simulation] ** [http://research.physics.uiuc.edu/QI/Photonics/movies/bb84.swf Flash simulation of BB84] *'''Quantum Cryptography Research Groups''' ** [http://www.quantenkryptographie.at/ Experimental Quantum Cryptography with Entangled Photons] ** [http://w3.antd.nist.gov/quin.shtml NIST Quantum Information Networks] ** [http://xqp.physik.uni-muenchen.de/ Free Space Quantum Cryptography] ** [http://www.fysel.ntnu.no/groups/optics/qcr/ The Quantum Hacking group] *'''Companies selling quantum devices for cryptography''' ** [http://idquantique.com id Quantique] sells Quantum Key Distribution products ** [http://magiqtech.com MagiQ Technologies] sells quantum devices for cryptography ** [http://www.quintessencelabs.com Quintessence Labs] Solutions based on continuous wave lasers ** [http://www.smartquantum.com SmartQuantum] Hardware solutions for quantum and digital cryptography *'''Companies with quantum cryptography research programmes''' ** [http://www.toshiba-europe.com/research/crl/qig/quantumkeyserver.html Toshiba] ** [http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/qip/ Hewlett Packard] ** [http://www.almaden.ibm.com/st/quantum_information/qcrypt/ IBM] ** [http://global.mitsubishielectric.com/bu/security/rd/rd03.html Mitsubishi] ** [http://www.nec.co.jp/rd/Eng/Topics/index.html NEC] ** [http://www.brl.ntt.co.jp/E/research/qo/qo.html NTT] ** [http://www.ait.ac.at/departments/safety-security/business-units/quantum-technologies/?L=1 AIT] ==References== <!--This article uses the Cite.php citation mechanism.

The quantum phase estimation algorithm allows one to estimate the eigenphase of an eigenvector of a unitary gate, given access to a quantum state proportional to the eigenvector and a procedure to implement the unitary conditionally. ==The Problem== Let ''U'' be a [[unitary operator]] that operates on ''m'' qubits. Then all of the eigenvalues of ''U'' have absolute value 1. Thus the [[spectrum]] of a unitary operator consists of phases <math>e^{2\pi i\theta}</math>. Given an eigenvector <math>\left| \psi \right\rangle</math>, such that <math>U\left| \psi \right\rangle = e^{2\pi i \theta}\left|\psi \right\rangle</math>, the objective is to estimate <math>\theta</math>. The phase estimation algorithm solves this problem. ==The Algorithm== [[Image:Quantum_phase_estimation.svg|400px|thumb|right|[[Quantum circuit]] representation of the phase estimation algorithm]] Suppose we wish to compute the phases to an accuracy of ''n'' bits. We achieve this by subjecting our eigenvector <math>\left| \psi \right\rangle</math> of <math>U</math> to a succession of ''n'' controlled operators, followed by the inverse of the [[quantum Fourier transform]]. The controlled operators are the powers of <math>U</math> from <math>U</math> to controlled <math>U^{2^{n-1}}</math>. After putting the control lines into the Hadamard state, we have :<math>\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^{n}}} \sum_x \left| x \right\rangle \otimes \left| \psi \right\rangle</math>. After the controlled application of <math>U</math>, we have :<math>\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^{n}}} \sum_x e^{ix\theta} \left| x \right\rangle \otimes \left| \psi \right\rangle</math>. Applying the inverse of the [[quantum Fourier transform]] upon the ''n'' qubits yields :<math>\frac{1}{2^n} \sum_y \sum_x e^{-2\pi i x\cdot y/2^n} e^{ix\theta} \left| y \right\rangle \otimes \left| \psi \right\rangle = \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_y \frac{ e^{i 2^n \theta} - 1 }{ e^{i\left( \theta - 2\pi y/2^n \right)} - 1 } \left| y \right\rangle \otimes \left| \psi \right\rangle</math>. If the phase is exactly a <math>2^n</math> root of unity, the quantum Fourier transform will single out that phase in binary expansion. If not, there will be a probability distribution clustered around the correct phase. If <math>\left| \psi \right\rangle</math> is really a superposition of eigenstates, there is a weighted probability distribution over the individual eigenstates, with the weight given by the [[Born probabilities]]. This is because eigenstates corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal. The efficiency of this algorithm depends on our access to <math>U</math>. If we only have
