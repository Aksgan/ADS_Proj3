taken. First a warning is usually given; this is commonly in the form of a ''private message'' but recent development has made it possible for it to be integrated into the software. Subsequently, if the act is ignored and warnings do not work, the member is – usually – first exiled from the forum for a number of days. Denying someone access to the site is called a ''ban''. Bans can mean the person can no longer log in or even view the site anymore. If the offender, after the warning sentence, repeats the offense, another ban is given, usually this time a longer one. Continuous harassment of the site eventually leads to a permanent ban. In most cases this simply means the account is locked. In extreme cases where the offender – after being permanently banned – creates another account and continues to harass the site, administrators will apply an [[IP address|IP]] ban (this can also be applied at the server level): if the IP is static, the machine of the offender is prevented from accessing the site. In some extreme circumstances, IP range bans or country bans can be applied; this is usually for political, licensing or other reasons. See also: [[Block (internet)]], [[IP blocking]], [[Internet censorship]]. Offending content is usually deleted. Sometimes if the topic is considered the source of the problem, it is ''locked''; often a poster may request a topic expected to draw problems to be locked as well, although the moderators decide whether to grant it. In a ''locked thread'', members cannot post anymore. In cases where the topic is considered a breach of rules it – with all of its posts – may be deleted. ===Troll=== {{Main|Troll (Internet)}} Forum ''trolls'' are users that repeatedly and deliberately breach the [[netiquette]] of an established online community, posting inflammatory, extraneous, or off-topic messages to bait or excite users into responding or to test the forum rules and policies, and with that the patience of the forum staff. Their provocative behavior may potentially start [[Flaming (Internet)|flame wars]] (see below) or other disturbances. Responding to a troll's provocations is commonly known as 'feeding the troll' and is generally discouraged, as it can encourage their disruptive behavior. ===Sock puppet=== {{Main|Sockpuppet (Internet)}} The term sock puppet refers to someone who is simultaneously registered under different pseudonyms on a particular message board or forum. The analogy of a sock puppet is of a puppeteer holding up both hands and supplying dialogue to both puppets simultaneously. A sock puppet will create multiple accounts over a period of time, using each user to debate or agree with each other on a forum. Sock puppets are usually found when an IP check is done on the accounts in forums. ===Spamming=== {{Main|Forum spam}} Forum spamming is a breach of netiquette where users repeat the same word or phrase over and over, but differs from multiple posting in that spamming is usually a willful act which sometimes has malicious intent. This is a common trolling technique. It can also be traditional [[Spam (electronic)|spam]], unpaid [[advertisement]]s that are in breach of the forum's rules. Spammers utilize a number of illicit techniques to post their spam, including the use of [[botnets]]. Some forums consider concise, comment-oriented posts spam, for example ''Thank you'', ''Cool'' or ''I love it''. ===Double posting=== One common faux pas on Internet forums is to post the same message twice. Users sometimes post versions of a message that are only slightly different, especially in forums where they are not allowed to edit their earlier posts. Multiple posting instead of editing prior posts can artificially inflate a user's post count. Multiple posting can be unintentional; a user's browser might display an error message even though the post has been transmitted or a user of a slow forum might become impatient and repeatedly hit the submit button. Multiple posting can also be used as a method of [[Troll (Internet)|trolling]] or spreading [[forum spam]]. A user may also send the same post to several forums, which is termed [[crossposting]]. The term derives from [[Usenet]], where crossposting was an accepted practice but causes problems in web forums, which lack the ability to link such posts so replies in one forum are not visible to people reading the post in other forums. ===Word censor=== {{Main|Scunthorpe problem}} A word [[Censorship|censor]]ing system is commonly included in the forum software package. The system will pick up words in the body of the post or some other user editable forum element (like user titles) and if they partially match a certain keyword (commonly no [[case sensitivity]]) they will be censored. The most common censoring is letter replacement with an [[asterisk]] character; for example: in the user title it is deemed inappropriate for users to use words such as "admin", "moderator", "leader" and so on, if the censoring system is implemented a title such as "forum leader" may be filtered to "forum ******". Rude or vulgar words are common targets for the censoring system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/vboptions_group_censor |title=Censorship Options |accessdate=2008-10-30 |publisher=vBulletin.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phpbb.com/support/documentation/3.0/adminguide/acp_posting.php#acp_posting_censors |title=3.4.5. Word censoring |accessdate=2008-10-30 |publisher=PhpBB.com}}</ref> But such auto-censors can make mistakes, for example censoring "[[wristwatch]]" to "wris****ch" and "[[Scunthorpe]]" to "S****horpe." ==Forum structure== A forum consists of a tree like directory structure containing at the lowest end ''topics'' (commonly called ''threads'') and inside them ''posts''. Logically forums are organised into a finite set of generic topics (usually with one main topic) driven and updated by a group known as ''members'', and governed by a group known as ''moderators''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} All message boards will use one of three possible display formats. Each of the three basic message board display formats: Non-Threaded/Semi-Threaded/Fully Threaded, has its own advantages and disadvantages. If messages are not related to one another at all a Non-Threaded format is best. If you have a message topic and multiple replies to that message topic a semi-threaded format is best. If you have a message topic and replies to that message topic, and replies to replies, then a fully threaded format is
