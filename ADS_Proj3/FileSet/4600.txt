The UNSPSC was jointly developed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and [[Dun & Bradstreet]] Corporation in 1998 and is currently managed by [[GS1 US]], which is responsible for overseeing code change requests, revising the codes and issuing regularly scheduled updates to the code, as well as managing special projects and initiatives. ==History== The UNSPSC was created upon the signature of a Memorandum of Understanding signed on September 29, 1998 by [[John S. Svendsen]], the director of the [[Inter-agency Procurement Services Office]] (IAPSO) of the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) and on November 1, 1998 by [[Lawrence M. Barth]], a Vice President of the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation. The development of the first version was overseen by [[Peter R. Benson]], who was also responsible for the design and development of the code management procedure as a modification of the [[Delphi statistical forecasting]] method. The process allowed for the rapid development of consensus without dominance or influence. The [[ECCMA]], a non-profit membership association, was formed in 1999 to manage and promote the UNSPSC until March of 2003, with the release of version 6.0315. The UNDP then appointed [[GS1 US]] as code manager in May 2003 and ECCMA develops the ECCMA [[Open Technical Dictionary]] (eOTD) and the international standards [[ISO 22745]] and [[ISO 8000]]. == Current code == The current version consists of more than 18000 terms. The codeset is available in [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Mandarin Chinese]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]. [[PDF]] versions of the codeset are available for free download. A version in [[Microsoft Excel]] format is available to members, who can also request changes and suggest additions to the code. The UNSPSC for a given item is composed of five two-digit identifiers, which together categorize the item into a five-level hierarchy. The five levels of the classification are "Segment", "Family", "Class", "Commodity", and "Business Function". == Industrial products and services categorization standards == * [[Eclass|eCl@ss]] * [[ETIM (standard)|ETIM]] * UNSPSC * [[eOTD]] * [[RosettaNet]] ==See also== * [[Data Universal Numbering System]] (DUNS) * [[North American Industry Classification System]] (NAICS) * [[Point code]] * [[Standard Industrial Classification]] (SIC) ==References== {{refbegin}} * Paper [http://www.heppnetz.de/files/IJSWIS-eclassOWL-APA-Style-2005-final-11-17-Web.pdf Products and Services Ontologies: A Methodology for Deriving OWL Ontologies from Industrial Categorization Standards], Int'l Journal on Semantic Web & Information Systems (IJSWIS), Vol. 2, No. 1, pp. 72-99, January-March 2006. * Paper [http://www.heppnetz.de/files/hepp-de-bruijn-ESWC2007-gentax-CRC.pdf GenTax: A Generic Methodology for Deriving OWL and RDF-S Ontologies from Hierarchical Classifications, Thesauri, and Inconsistent Taxonomies], Proceedings of the 4th European Semantic Web Conference (ESWC 2007), June 3-7, Innsbruck, Austria, in: E.

When [[Windows 2000]] was released, [[Microsoft]] created [[NTFS]] version 3.0, which included several new features and improvements over older versions of the [[file system]]. One of these was a new system management feature that is very useful for certain types of [[application software|application]]s. Under Windows 2000, NTFS 3.0 [[Disk partitioning|partitions]] can be set to keep track of changes to files and directories on the [[volume (computing)|volume]], providing a record of when and what was done to the various objects. When enabled, the system records all changes made to the volume in the USN Journal, which is the name also used to describe the feature itself. USN Journals work in a fairly simple manner. One journal is maintained for each NTFS volume, and it begins as an empty [[Computer file|file]]. Whenever a change is made to the volume, a record is added to the file. Each record is identified by a [[64-bit]] Update Sequence Number or USN. (For this reason Change Journals are sometimes called USN Journals.) Each record in the Change Journal contains the USN, the name of the file, and information about what the change was. The Change Journal describes the changes that took place, but does not include all the [[data]] or details associated with the change. For this reason the Change Journal cannot be used to undo operations on files within NTFS. ==See also== *[[Journaling file system]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== *{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa363798.aspx|title=Change Journals (Windows)|work=Microsoft Developers Network Library, Win32 and COM Development, Volume Management|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=10 June 2009}} *{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/fsutil_usn.mspx?mfr=true|title=FSUTIL: USN|work=Windows XP Professional Product Documentation|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=10 June 2009}} *{{cite web|url=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc788042.aspx|title=FSUTIL: USN|date=28 September 2007|work=Microsoft Technet Library, Windows Server Tech Center|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=10 June 2009}} *{{cite web|url=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc771388.aspx|title=NTFS Self-Healing|date=21 January 2008|work=Microsoft Technet Library, Windows Server Tech Center|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=10 June 2009}} {{Use dmy dates|date=October 2010}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Usn Journal}} [[Category:Computer file systems]] [[Category:Windows disk file systems]] [[no:USN Journal]] [[ru:Журнал USN]]</text> </page> <page> <id>38652</id> <title>UTEC</title> <text>'''UTEC''' was a [[computer]] built at the [[University of Toronto]] (UofT) in the early 1950s. It was one of the first working computers in the world, although only built in a prototype form while awaiting funding for expansion into a full-scale version. This funding was eventually used to purchase a surplus [[Manchester Mark 1]] from [[Ferranti]] in the UK instead, and UTEC quickly disappeared. The name was an acronym for ''University of Toronto Electronic Computer''. ==Background== Immediately after the ending of
