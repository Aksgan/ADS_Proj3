Building started in 1897 using money from public donations. The foundation stone was laid by then-mayor John Truscott on November 7, 1899. The tower was designed by local architect E. J. Shrewsbury, who designed many of the town's churches including St Peter's in Furze Platt plus the Technical Institute on Marlow Road. The clock tower was built by Charles Cox & Son; Charles Cox was the town mayor on several occasions. The tower is approximately 14 m (45 ft) tall and has four illuminated clock faces each facing the four compass points. A diamond pattern on the clock faces commemorates the clock's function. The clocks were donated by Mr G. A. Battcock; they were made and foxed by Smith of [[Derby]]. Red brick is used for most of the construction, typically of the local housing of that time. There is an elaborate pattern of stone work towards the top, just below the bell tower. All the clocks and bells still function. <ref name="clocktowerweb">{{cite web|title=''Why the name?''|work=ClockTowerWeb.com|url=http://www.clocktowerweb.co.uk/corporate/about/whyctw.php|accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> ===Newmarket=== The ''Newmarket Clock Tower'' is located at the top of the High Street.

The clock is one of Weymouth's best-loved landmarks and has been a meeting place for generations of both locals and visitors. It is the focal point of Weymouth's New Year's Eve celebrations as midnight approaches and revelers gather beneath its four faces to welcome in the New Year. <ref name="sun_inn">{{cite web|title=''The Jubilee Clock''|url=http://www.suninnweymouth.co.uk/jubilee-clock.html|accessdate=2007-04-09}}</ref> ==Isle of Man== [[Image:Jubilee clock.jpg|left|thumb|Isle of Man Jubilee Clock c.1900]] A ''Jubilee Clock'' is located in the [[Isle of Man]] capital of [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]].
