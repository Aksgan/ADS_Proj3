Ackermann number, 4↑↑↑↑4, can be written in terms of [[tetration]] towers as follows: :4↑↑↑↑4 = 4↑↑↑4↑↑↑4↑↑↑4 = 4↑↑↑4↑↑↑(4↑↑4↑↑4↑↑4) :::<math> = \underbrace{~~^{^{^{^{^{^{^{^{4}.}.}.}4}4}4}4}4~~}_{\underbrace{~^{^{^{^{^{4}.}.}.}4}4~}_{^{^{^{^4}4}4}4 {\rm\ fours}} {\rm fours}}</math> Explanation: in the middle layer, there is a tower of tetration whose full height is <math>^{^{^{^4}4}4}4</math> and the final result is the top layer of tetrated 4's whose full height equals the calculation of the middle layer. Note that by way of size comparison, the simple expression <sup>4</sup>4 already exceeds a [[googolplex]], so the fourth Ackermann number is quite large. Alternatively, this can be written in terms of [[exponentiation]] towers as :<math>4\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 4 = </math> :<math>\quad</math> :<math> \left. \begin{matrix} 4^{4^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{4}}}}}}\end{matrix} \right \} \left. \begin{matrix}4^{4^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{4}}}}}\end{matrix} \right \} \dots \left. \begin{matrix}4^{4^{4^4}}\end{matrix} \right \} 4, </math> :where the number of towers on the previous line (including the rightmost "4") is :<math> \left. \begin{matrix}4^{4^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{4}}}}}}\end{matrix} \right \} \left. \begin{matrix}4^{4^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{4}}}}}\end{matrix} \right \} \dots \left. \begin{matrix}4^{4^{4^4}}\end{matrix} \right \} 4, </math> :where the number of towers on the previous line (including the rightmost "4") is :<math> \left. \begin{matrix}4^{4^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{4}}}}}\end{matrix} \right \} \left. \begin{matrix}4^{4^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{4}}}}}\end{matrix} \right \} \left. \begin{matrix}4^{4^{4^4}}\end{matrix} \right \} 4, </math> where the number of "4"s in each tower, on each of the lines above, is specified by the value of the next tower to its right (as indicated by a brace). ==See also== * [[Computability theory]] * [[Recursion (computer science)]] * [[Primitive recursive function]] * [[Double recursion]] ==References== {{reflist|2}} ==External links== * {{mathworld | urlname = AckermannFunction | title = Ackermann function}} * {{DADS|Ackermann's function|ackermann}} * [http://www.gfredericks.com/main/sandbox/arith/ackermann An animated Ackermann function calculator] * [[Scott Aaronson]], ''[http://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/bignumbers.html Who can name the biggest number?]'' (1999) * [http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~susan/cyc/a/ackermnn.htm Ackermann function's].

It opened in 1952 and has gone through many changes, being first Hugh Bell School, then [[Acklam, Middlesbrough#Stainsby|Stainsby]] School, and currently Acklam Grange [[High school|Secondary School]]. The current Headteacher is John Bate, and together with his leadership team he has been responsible for much revolutionizing of the school and its' policies. The school is one of the few in the area that have continue to be a part of [[Building Schools for the Future]] after announced spending cuts by the Government. == Facilities == On the site of the School is the [http://www.mclc.org.uk/ Middlesbrough City Learning Centre], providing specialist [[Information and Communications Technology|ICT]] facilities for the school and others in the area. The centre is located on the Lodore side of school; there is also the Acorn Centre, a local sports centre, situated at the Heythrop entrance. == New Build == As of 6th September 2010, the school is open to pupils. Prior to this, pupils had involvement in areas ranging from landscaping to the naming of select areas. This has helped to make the school right for the pupils, as befits a Building Schools for the Future school. The old school (consisting of the former Oaklands and Stainsby school) is due to be demolished from August 2010 to December 2010. It will be replaced by a carpark and landscaping to lead up to the school from the Lodore Grove entrance. == [http://www.acklamgrange.org.uk/acorn/index.htm Acorn Centre] == The Acorn Centre is a £2.2 million sport and inclusion{{Clarify|date=November 2009}} facility which was opened in late January 2005 following its official launch by Gary Pallister (former Middlesbrough and England International footballer) and Councillor Hazel Pearson OBE. Situated on the site of Acklam Grange School, a specialist college of Mathematics and Computing in West Middlesbrough. The development has been made possible due to receiving significant investment from Acklam Grange School, Middlesbrough Council, The West Middlesbrough Neighbourhood Trust (WMNT) and The Big Lottery Fund. The Acorn Centre is a Dual Use facility for local school and community networks. The new building is currently being constructed on the playing fields opposite the school by contractors Wilmott Dixon. The build is expected to open in September 2010 and has cost over £27 million. ==Notable past pupils== *[[Pete Firman]] - Comedian/Magician *[[Journey South]] - Singing Duo *[[Stephen Mark Barchan]] - Composer *[[Chris Rea]] Singer {{Coord|54.54489|-1.26401|display=title}} [[Category:Education in Middlesbrough]] [[Category:Educational institutions established in 1952]] [[Category:Mathematics and Computing Colleges in England]] [[Category:Comprehensive schools in North Yorkshire]] {{Tees-school-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>818</id> <title>Acknowledgment (creative arts)</title> <text> In the [[Creative Arts|creative arts]] and [[scientific literature]], an '''acknowledgment''' (also spelled '''acknowledgement''') is an expression of gratitude for assistance in creating a literary or artistic work. Receiving [[credit (creative arts)|credit]] by way of acknowledgment rather than authorship indicates that the person or organization did not have a direct hand in producing the work in question, but may have contributed funding, criticism, or encouragement to the author(s). Various schemes exist for classifying acknowledgments; Giles & Councill (2004) give the following six categories: # [[moral support]] # [[funding|financial support]] # [[editing|editorial support]] # [[presentation|presentational support]] # [[technical support|instrumental/technical support]] # [[conceptual support]], or [[peer interactive communication]] (PIC) Apart from [[citation]], which is not usually considered to be an acknowledgment, acknowledgment of conceptual support is widely considered to be the most important for identifying intellectual debt. Some acknowledgments of financial support, on the other hand, may simply be legal
