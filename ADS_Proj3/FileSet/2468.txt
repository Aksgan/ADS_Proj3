called "cyclic". For example, the conservation of the generalized momentum, : <math>p_2:=\frac{\partial\mathcal L}{\partial\dot q_2}</math>, say, can be directly seen if the Lagrangian of the system is of the form :<math>\mathcal L(q_1,q_3,q_4, \dots; \dot q_1,\dot q_2,\dot q_3,\dot q_4, \dots;t)\,.</math> Also, if the time, ''t'', does not appear in <math>\mathcal L</math>, then the conservation of the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] follows. This is the energy conservation unless the potential energy depends on velocity, as in [[electrodynamics]]. More details can be found in any textbook on theoretical mechanics. == Explanation == {{Formula missing descriptions|date=December 2009}} The [[equation of motion|equations of motion]] are obtained by means of an [[action (physics)|action]] principle, written as: :<math>\frac{\delta \mathcal{S}}{\delta \varphi_i} = 0\,.</math> where the ''action'', <math>\mathcal{S}</math>, is a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] of the dependent variables <math>\varphi_i(s)</math> with their derivatives and ''s'' itself :<math>\mathcal{S}\left[\varphi_i, \frac{\partial \varphi_i} {\partial s}\right] = \int{ \mathcal{L} \left[\varphi_i [s], \frac{\partial \varphi_i [s]}{\partial s^\alpha}, s^\alpha\right] \, \mathrm{d}^n s }</math> and where <math>s = \{ s^\alpha \} \!</math> denotes the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of ''n'' [[independent variable]]s of the system, indexed by <math>\alpha = 1, 2, 3, \ldots, n .</math> The equations of motion obtained from this [[functional derivative]] are the [[Euler–Lagrange equations]] of this action. For example, in the [[classical mechanics]] of particles, the only independent variable is time, ''t''. So the Euler-Lagrange equations are :<math>\frac{d}{d t}\frac{\partial\mathcal L}{\partial\dot \varphi_i} = \frac{\partial\mathcal L}{\partial\varphi_i} .</math> Dynamical systems whose equations of motion are obtainable by means of an action principle on a suitably chosen Lagrangian are known as ''Lagrangian dynamical systems''. Examples of Lagrangian dynamical systems range from the classical version of the [[Standard Model]], to [[Newton's laws|Newton's equations]], to purely mathematical problems such as [[geodesic]] equations and [[Plateau's problem]]. ==An example from classical mechanics== ===In the rectangular coordinate system=== Suppose we have a [[three-dimensional space]] and the Lagrangian :<math>L(\vec{x}, \dot{\vec{x}}) \ = \ \frac{1}{2} \ m \ \dot{\vec{x}}^2 \ - \ V(\vec{x})</math>. Then, the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]] is: :<math>\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \ \left( \, \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}_i} \, \right) \ - \ \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_i} \ = \ 0</math> where <math>i = 1, 2, 3</math>. The derivation yields: :<math>\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_i} \ = \ - \ \frac{\partial V}{\partial x_i}</math> :<math>\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}_i} \ = \ \frac{\partial ~}{\partial \dot{x}_i} \, \left( \, \frac{1}{2} \ m \ \dot{\vec{x}}^2 \, \right) \ = \ \frac{1}{2} \ m \ \frac{\partial ~}{\partial \dot{x}_i} \, \left( \, \dot{x}_i \, \dot{x}_i \, \right) = \ m \, \dot{x}_i </math> :<math>\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \ \left( \, \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}_i} \, \right) \ = \ m \, \ddot{x}_i </math> The Euler–Lagrange equations can therefore be written as: :<math>m\ddot{\vec{x}}+\nabla V=0</math> where the time derivative is written conventionally as a dot above the quantity being differentiated, and <math>\nabla</math> is the [[del| del operator]]. Using this result, it can easily be shown that the Lagrangian approach is equivalent to the Newtonian one. If the force is written in terms of the potential <math>\vec{F}=- \nabla V(x)</math>; the resulting equation is <math>\vec{F}=m\ddot{\vec{x}}</math>, which is exactly the same equation as in a Newtonian approach for a constant mass object. A very similar deduction gives us the expression <math>\vec{F}=\mathrm{d}\vec{p}/\mathrm{d}t</math>, which is Newton's Second Law in its general form. ===In the spherical coordinate system=== Suppose we have a three-dimensional space using [[spherical coordinates]] <math>r, \theta, \phi</math> with the Lagrangian :<math>L = \frac{m}{2}(\dot{r}^2+r^2\dot{\theta}^2 +r^2\sin^2\theta\dot{\varphi}^2)-V(r).</math> Then the Euler–Lagrange equations are: :<math>m\ddot{r}-mr(\dot{\theta}^2+\sin^2\theta\dot{\varphi}^2)+V' =0,</math> :<math>\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(mr^2\dot{\theta}) -mr^2\sin\theta\cos\theta\dot{\varphi}^2=0,</math> :<math>\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(mr^2\sin^2\theta\dot{\varphi})=0.</math> Here the set of parameters <math>s_i</math> is just the time <math>t</math>, and the dynamical variables <math>\phi_i(s)</math> are the trajectories <math>\vec x(t)</math> of the particle. Despite the use of standard variables such as <math>x</math>, the Lagrangian allows the use of any coordinates, which do not need to be orthogonal. These are "[[generalized coordinates]]". ==Lagrangian of a test particle== A test particle is a particle whose mass and charge are assumed to be so small that its effect on external system is insignificant. It is often a hypothetical simplified point particle with no properties other than mass and charge. Real particles like electrons and up-quarks are more complex and have additional terms in their Lagrangians. ===Classical test particle with Newtonian gravity=== Suppose we are given a particle with mass <math>m \!</math> kilograms, and position <math>\vec{x}</math> meters in a Newtonian gravitation field with potential <math>\zeta \!</math> joules per kilogram. The particle's world line is parameterized by time <math>t\!</math> seconds. The particle's kinetic energy is: :<math> T[t] = {1 \over 2} m \dot{\vec{x}}[t] \cdot \dot{\vec{x}}[t] </math> and the particle's gravitational potential energy is: :<math> V[t] = m \zeta [\vec{x} [t],t] .</math> Then its Lagrangian is <math>L \!</math> joules where :<math> L[t] = T[t] - V[t] = {1 \over 2} m \dot{\vec{x}}[t] \cdot \dot{\vec{x}}[t] - m \zeta [\vec{x} [t],t] .</math> Varying <math>\vec{x}\!</math> in the integral (equivalent to the Euler–Lagrange differential equation), we get :<math>0 = \delta\int{L[t] \, \mathrm{d}t} = \int{\delta L[t] \, \mathrm{d}t} </math> :<math>= \int{m \dot{\vec{x}}[t] \cdot \dot{\delta \vec{x}}[t] - m \nabla \zeta [\vec{x} [t],t] \cdot \delta \vec{x}[t] \, \mathrm{d}t}.</math> Integrate the first term by parts and discard the total integral. Then divide out the variation to get :<math>0 = - m \ddot{\vec{x}}[t] - m \nabla \zeta [\vec{x} [t],t] </math> and thus :<math>m \ddot{\vec{x}}[t] = - m \nabla \zeta [\vec{x} [t],t] \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(1)</math> is the equation of motion &mdash; two different expressions for the force. ===Special relativistic test particle with electromagnetism=== In special relativity, the form of the term which gives rise to the derivative of the momentum must be changed; it is no longer the kinetic energy. It becomes: :<math>- m c^2 \frac{d \tau[t]}{d t} = - m c^2 \sqrt {1 - \frac{v^2 [t]}{c^2}} </math> :<math>= -m c^2 + {1 \over 2} m v^2 [t] + {1 \over 8} m \frac{v^4 [t]}{c^2} + \dots </math> (In special relativity, the energy of a free test particle is <math>m c^2 \frac{dt}{d \tau [t]} = \frac{m c^2}{\sqrt {1 - \frac{v^2 [t]}{c^2}}} = +m c^2 + {1 \over 2} m v^2 [t] + {3 \over 8} m \frac{v^4 [t]}{c^2} + \dots </math>) where <math>c \!</math> meters per second is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum, <math>\tau \!</math> seconds is the proper time (i.e. time measured by a clock moving
