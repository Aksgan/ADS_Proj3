For example, a high resolution raster image takes more space than a low resolution one. Typically higher resolution is needed for printing documents than for displaying them on screen. Other things that may increase the size of a file is embedding full fonts, especially for Asiatic scripts, and storing text as graphics. === Standard Type 1 Fonts === There are fourteen typefaces that have a special significance to PDF documents: * Times (v3) (in regular, italic, bold, and bold italic) * [[Courier (typeface)|Courier]] (in regular, oblique, bold and bold oblique) * [[Helvetica]] (v3) (in regular, oblique, bold and bold oblique) * [[Symbol (typeface)|Symbol]] * [[Zapf Dingbats]] These fonts, sometimes referred to as the "base fourteen fonts"<ref>[http://desktoppub.about.com/od/glossary/g/base14fonts.htm Adobe Acrobat Base 14 Fonts]</ref> should always be present (actually present or a close substitute) and so need not be embedded in a PDF.<ref>[http://www.planetpdf.com/planetpdf/pdfs/pdf2k/03e/merz_fontaquarium.pdf The PDF Font Aquarium]</ref> PDF viewers must know about the metrics of these fonts. Other fonts may be substituted if they are not embedded in a PDF. == Implementations == PDF-viewing software is generally provided free of charge, and many versions are available from a variety of sources ([[List of PDF software]]). There are many software options for creating PDFs, including the PDF printing capabilities built in to [[Mac OS X]] and most [[Linux]] distributions, the multi-platform [[OpenOffice.org]], [[Microsoft Office 2007]] (if updated to [[Office 2007#Service Pack 2|SP2]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/953195|title=Description of 2007 Microsoft Office Suite Service Pack 2 (SP2) |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |accessdate=2009-05-09}}</ref> [[WordPerfect]] since version 9, [[Free PDF XP]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://freepdf-xp.en.softonic.com/|title=Free PDF XP |accessdate=2010-07-27}}</ref> and numerous PDF print drivers for [[Microsoft Windows]], the [[pdfTeX]] typesetting system, the [[DocBook]] PDF tools, applications developed around [[Ghostscript]] and [[Adobe Acrobat]] itself. [[Google]]'s online office suite [[Google Docs]] also allows for uploading, and saving to the Portable Document Format. [[Raster image processor]]s (RIPs) are used to convert PDF files into a [[raster graphics|raster format]] suitable for imaging onto paper and other media in printers, digital production presses and [[prepress]] in a process known as [[rasterisation]]. RIPs capable of processing PDF directly include the Adobe PDF Print Engine<ref>[http://www.adobe.com/products/pdfprintengine/overview.html www.adobe.com/products/pdfprintengine/overview.html]</ref> from [[Adobe Systems]] and Jaws<ref>[http://www.globalgraphics.com/products/jaws_rip/ www.globalgraphics.com/products/jaws_rip/]</ref> and the [[Harlequin rip|Harlequin RIP]] from [[Global Graphics]]. ==Editing PDFs (structure)== {{Expand section|date=July 2010}} There is also specialized software for editing PDF files, though the choices are much more limited and often expensive. As of version 0.46, [[Inkscape]] also allows PDF editing through an intermediate translation step involving [[Poppler (software)|Poppler]]. A PDF editor most similar to word processor is called [[Infix PDF Editor]].<ref>[http://www.iceni.com/infix3_competition.htm PDF Editor Review and Comparison Chart]</ref> See [[List of PDF software]] for a more complete list of PDF editors. ==Annotating PDFs== {{See also|Comparison of notetaking software|Category:Web annotation}} [[Adobe Acrobat]] is one example of proprietary software that allows the user to annotate, highlight, and add notes to already created PDF files. One UNIX application available as [[free software]] (under the [[GNU General Public License]]) is [[PDFedit]]. Another GPL-licensed application native to the Linux environment is [[Xournal]]. Xournal allows for annotating in different fonts and colours, as well as a rule for quickly underlining and highlighting lines of text or paragraphs. Xournal also has a shape recognition tool for squares, rectangles and circles. In Xournal annotations may be moved, copied and pasted. The [[freeware]] [[Foxit Reader]] allows annotating but adds a watermark on each annotated page. The commercial version of the package does not have this limitation. Tracker Software's [[PDF-XChange Viewer]] allows annotations and markups without restrictions in its freeware alternative. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[Mac OS X]]'s integrated PDF viewer, Preview, does also enable annotations. For mobile annotation, [[iAnnotate PDF]] for the [[iPad]] and [[Aji Annotate]] for the [[iPhone]], both produced by Aji, allow annotation of PDFs as well as exporting summaries of the annotations. There are also [[web annotation]] systems which allow to annotate pdf and other documents formats, e.g. [[A.nnotate]], [[crocodoc]], [[WebNotes]]. In cases where PDFs are expected to have all of the functionality of paper documents, ink annotation is required. Many programs which accept ink input from the mouse are not responsive enough for handwriting using an input tablet or tablet PC. Existing solutions on the PC include [[Bluebeam PDF Revu]], and [[PDF Annotator]]. ==Other applications and functionalities== Several applications embracing the PDF standard are now available as an online service including [[Scribd]] for viewing and storing, [[Pdfvue]] for online editing, and [[Zamzar]] for PDF Conversion. In 1993 the Jaws [[Raster image processor|RIP]] from [[Global Graphics]] became the first shipping prepress RIP that interpreted PDF natively without conversion to another format. The company released an upgrade to their Harlequin RIP with the same capability in 1997.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} [[Agfa-Gevaert]] introduced and shipped Apogee, the first prepress workflow system based on PDF, in 1997. Many commercial offset printers have accepted the submission of press-ready PDF files as a print source, specifically the PDF/X-1a subset and variations of the same.<ref>[http://www.prepressx.com Press-Ready PDF Files] "For anyone interested in having their graphic project commercially printed directly from digital files or PDFs." (last checked on 2009-02-10).</ref> The submission of press-ready PDF files are a replacement for the problematic need for receiving collected native working files. PDF was selected as the "native" [[metafile]] format for Mac OS X, replacing the [[PICT]] format of the earlier [[Mac OS]]. The imaging model of the [[Quartz (graphics layer)|Quartz]] graphics layer is based on the model common to [[Display PostScript]] and PDF, leading to the nickname "Display PDF". The Preview application can display PDF files, as can version 2.0 and later of the [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] web browser. System-level support for PDF allows Mac OS X applications to create PDF documents automatically, provided they support the Print command. The files are then exported in PDF 1.3 format according to the file header. When taking a screenshot under Mac OS X versions 10.0 through 10.3, the image was also captured as a PDF; in 10.4
