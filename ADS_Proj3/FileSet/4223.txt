create more complex shapes than [[Constructive solid geometry|CSG]] (the other major part of map architecture) and are faster to render per triangle.[http://udn.epicgames.com/Two/LevelOptimization] They are also [[Gouraud_shading|vertex lit]], while CSG is lit [[Per-pixel_lighting|per-pixel]]. ==Characteristics== A Static Mesh contains information about its shape (vertices, edges and sides), a reference to the textures to be used (the actual textures, however, are stored in separate packages), and optionally a collision model (see the simple collision section below). ===Collision=== There are three ways for a Static Mesh to collide: *No collision: a static mesh can be set not to block anything. This is often used for small decoration like grass. *Per-polygon collision (default): individual polygons collide with actors. Each material (i.e. each part of the Static Mesh using a separate texture) can be set to collide or not independently from the rest. The advantage of this method is that one part of the Static Mesh can collide while another doesn't (a common example: a tree's trunk collides, but its leaves don't). The disadvantage is that for complex meshes this can take a lot of processing power. *Simple collision: the static mesh doesn't collide itself, but has built-in blocking volumes that collide instead. Usually, the blocking volumes will have a simpler shape than the Static Mesh, resulting in faster collision calculation. ===Texturing=== Although Static Meshes have built-in information on what textures to use, this can be overridden by adding a new skin in the Static Mesh's properties. Alternatively, the Static Mesh itself can be modified to use different textures by default. ==Usage== In maps, Static Meshes are very common, as they are used for anything more complex than basic architecture (in which case CSG is used) or terrain (created with a separate TerrainInfo actor). Additionally, Static Meshes sometimes represent other objects, including weapon projectiles and destroyed vehicles. ==See also== * [[Unreal Engine technology]] * [[UnrealEd]] ==External links== * [http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/wiki/Static_Mesh UnrealWiki: Static Mesh] [[Category:3D computer graphics]] [[Category:Unreal]]</text> </page> <page> <id>35645</id> <title>Stationary set</title> <text>{{Merge| Club filter | Club set | discuss=Talk:Club filter#Merge |date=June 2009}} In [[mathematics]], particularly in [[set theory]] and [[model theory]], there are at least three notions of '''stationary set''': ==Classical notion== If <math> \kappa \,</math> is a [[cardinal number|cardinal]] of uncountable [[cofinality]], <math> S \subseteq \kappa \,,</math> and <math> S \,</math> [[Intersection (set theory)|intersects]] every [[club set]] in <math> \kappa \,,</math> then <math> S \,</math> is called a '''stationary set'''. If a set is not stationary, then it is called a '''thin set'''. This notion should not be confused with the notion of a [[Thin_set_(Serre)|thin set in number theory]]. If <math> S \,</math> is a stationary set and <math> C \,</math> is a club set, then their intersection <math> S \cap C \,</math> is also stationary. Because if <math> D \,</math> is any club set, then <math> C \cap D \,</math> is a club set because the intersection of two club sets is club. Thus <math> (S \cap C) \cap D = S \cap (C \cap D) \,</math> is non empty. Therefore <math> (S \cap C) \,</math> must be stationary. ''See also'': [[Fodor's lemma]] The restriction to uncountable cofinality is in order to avoid trivialities: Suppose <math>\kappa</math> has countable cofinality. Then <math>S\subset\kappa</math> is stationary in <math>\kappa</math> if and only if <math>\kappa\setminus S</math> is bounded in <math>\kappa</math>. In particular, if the cofinality of <math>\kappa</math> is <math>\omega=\aleph_0</math>, then any two stationary subsets of <math>\kappa</math> have stationary intersection. This is no longer the case if the cofinality of <math>\kappa</math> is uncountable. In fact, suppose <math>\kappa</math> is [[regular cardinal|regular]] and <math>S\subset\kappa</math> is stationary. Then <math>S</math> can be partitioned into <math>\kappa</math> many disjoint stationary sets. This result is due to [[Robert M. Solovay|Solovay]]. If <math>\kappa</math> is a [[successor cardinal]], this result is due to [[Stanisław Marcin Ulam|Ulam]] and is easily shown by means of what is called an '''Ulam matrix'''. ==Jech's notion== There is also a notion of stationary subset of <math>[X]^\lambda</math>, for <math>\lambda</math> a cardinal and <math>X</math> a set such that <math>|X|\ge\lambda</math>, where <math>[X]^\lambda</math> is the set of subsets of <math>X</math> of cardinality <math>\lambda</math>: <math>[X]^\lambda=\{Y\subset X:|Y|=\lambda\}</math>. This notion is due to [[Thomas Jech]]. As before, <math>S\subset[X]^\lambda</math> is stationary if and only if it meets every club, where a club subset of <math>[X]^\lambda</math> is a set unbounded under <math>\subset</math> and closed under union of chains of length at most <math>\lambda</math>. These notions are in general different, although for <math>X=\omega_1</math> and <math>\lambda=\aleph_0</math> they coincide in the sense that <math>S\subset[\omega_1]^\omega</math> is stationary if and only if <math>S\cap\omega_1</math> is stationary in <math>\omega_1</math>. The appropriate version of Fodor's lemma also holds for this notion. ==Generalized notion== There is yet a third notion, model theoretic in nature and sometimes referred to as '''generalized''' stationarity. This notion is probably due to [[Menachem Magidor|Magidor]], [[Matthew Foreman|Foreman]] and [[Saharon Shelah|Shelah]] and has also been used prominently by [[W. Hugh Woodin|Woodin]]. Now let <math>X</math> be a nonempty set. A set <math>C\subset{\mathcal P}(X)</math> is club (closed and unbounded) if and only if there is a function <math>F:[X]^{<\omega}\to X</math> such that <math>C=\{z:F[[z]^{<\omega}]\subset z\}</math>. Here, <math>[y]^{<\omega}</math> is the collection of finite subsets of <math>y</math>. <math>S\subset{\mathcal P}(X)</math> is stationary in <math>{\mathcal P}(X)</math> if and only if it meets every club subset of <math>{\mathcal P}(X)</math>. To see the connection with model theory, notice that if <math>M</math> is a structure with universe <math>X</math> in a countable language and <math>F</math> is a [[Skolem function]] for <math>M</math>, then a stationary <math>S</math> must contain an elementary substructure of <math>M</math>. In fact, <math>S\subset{\mathcal P}(X)</math> is stationary if and only if for any such structure <math>M</math> there is an elementary substructure of <math>M</math> that belongs to <math>S</math>. == References == Matthew Foreman, ''Stationary sets, Chang's Conjecture and partition theory'', in Set Theory (The Hajnal Conference) DIMACS Ser.
