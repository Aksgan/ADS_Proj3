The Project Gutenberg collection also has a few non-text items such as audio files and music notation files. Most releases are in English, but there are also significant numbers in many other languages. {{As of|November 2010}}, the non-English languages most represented are: French, German, Finnish, [[Dutch language|Dutch]], Portuguese, and Chinese.<ref name=USINFO>{{Cite web | last=Thomas | first=Jeffrey | date=20 June 2007 | url=http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2007/July/200707201511311CJsamohT0.6146356.html | title=Project Gutenberg Digital Library Seeks To Spur Literacy | publisher=U.S. Department of State, Bureau of International Information Programs | accessdate=20 August 2007 }}</ref> Whenever possible, Gutenberg releases are available in [[text file|plain text]], mainly using [[US-ASCII]] [[character encoding]] but frequently extended to [[ISO-8859-1]] (needed to represent accented characters in French and [[Scharfes s]] in German, for example). Besides being copyright-free, the requirement for a [[ISO 8859|Latin]] ([[character set]]) text version of the release has been a criterion of Michael Hart's since the founding of Project Gutenberg, as he believes this is the format most likely to be readable in the extended future. Out of necessity, this criterion has had to be extended further for the sizeable collection of texts in East Asian languages such as Chinese and Japanese now in the collection, where [[UTF-8]] is used instead. The text is wrapped at 65-70 characters and paragraphs are separated by a double-line break. Although this makes the release available to anybody with a text-reader, a drawback of this format is the lack of markup and the resulting relatively bland appearance.<ref>{{Cite web | last=Boumphrey | first=Frank | month=July | year=2000 | url=http://www.cultivate-int.org/issue1/gutenberg/ | title=European Literature and Project Gutenberg | publisher=Cultivate Interactive | accessdate= 15 August 2007 }}</ref> Other formats may be released as well when submitted by volunteers. The most common non-ASCII format is [[HTML]], which allows markup and illustrations to be included. Some project members and users have requested more advanced formats, believing them to be much easier to read. But some formats that are not easily editable, such as [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], are generally not considered to fit in with the goals of Project Gutenberg, although many are being introduced to the collection in [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] format so that illustrations can be added to downloadable documents. For years, there has been discussion of using some type of [[XML]], although progress on that has been slow.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} == Ideals == [[Image:Bouquin électronique iLiad sur une pile de livre dehors au soleil.jpg|thumb|[[iLiad]] e-book reader equipped with e-paper display]] Michael Hart said in 2004, "The mission of Project Gutenberg is simple: 'To encourage the creation and distribution of ebooks.'"<ref name="hart1" /> His goal is, "to provide as many e-books in as many formats as possible for the entire world to read in as many languages as possible."<ref name=USINFO /> Likewise, a project slogan is to "break down the bars of ignorance and illiteracy",<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.gutenbergnews.org/nl_archives/2003/pgweekly_2003_12_10_part_2.txt | title=The Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter | date=10 December 2003 | publisher=Project Gutenberg | accessdate=8 June 2008 }}</ref> because its volunteers aim to continue spreading public [[literacy]] and appreciation for the literary heritage just as [[public library|public libraries]] began to do in the late 19th century.<ref>{{Cite web | last=Perry | first=Ruth | year=2007 | url=http://www.mla.org/resources/documents/rep_primaryrecords/repview_records/primary_records10 | title=Postscript about the Public Libraries | publisher=Modern Language Association | accessdate=20 August 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | last=Lorenzen | first=Michael | year=2002 | url=http://www.michaellorenzen.com/carnegie.html | title=Deconstructing the Philanthropic Library: The Sociological Reasons Behind Andrew Carnegie's Millions to Libraries | publisher=Modern Language Association | accessdate=20 August 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070813224610/http://www.michaellorenzen.com/carnegie.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 13 August 2007}}</ref> Project Gutenberg is intentionally decentralized. For example, there is no selection policy dictating what texts to add. Instead, individual volunteers work on what they are interested in, or have available. The Project Gutenberg collection is intended to preserve items for the long term, so they cannot be lost by any one localized accident. In an effort to ensure this, the entire collection is backed-up regularly and mirrored on servers in many different locations. == Copyright == Project Gutenberg is careful to verify the status of its ebooks according to [[United States Copyright Law|U.S. copyright law]]. Material is added to the Project Gutenberg archive only after it has received a copyright clearance, and records of these clearances are saved for future reference. Unlike some other digital library projects, Project Gutenberg does not claim new copyright on titles it publishes. Instead, it encourages their free reproduction and distribution.<ref name=USINFO/> Most books in the Project Gutenberg collection are distributed as [[public domain]] under U.S. copyright law. The [[licensing]] included with each ebook puts some restrictions on what can be done with the texts (such as distributing them in modified form, or for commercial purposes) as long as the Project Gutenberg [[trademark]] is used. If the header is stripped and the trademark not used, then the public domain texts can be reused without any restrictions. There are also a few copyrighted texts that Project Gutenberg distributes with permission. These are subject to further restrictions as specified by the copyright holder. ==Criticism == Some people{{Who|September 2010|date=September 2010}} have criticized Project Gutenberg for lack of scholarly rigor in its e-texts: for example, there is usually inadequate information about the edition used and often omission of original prefaces. However, [[John Mark Ockerbloom]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] noted that Project Gutenberg is responsive about addressing errors once they are identified, and the texts now include specific source edition citations.<ref>{{Cite book| author = Martha L.

While the works in Project Gutenberg represent a valuable sample of publications that span several centuries, there are some issues of concern for linguistic analysis.
