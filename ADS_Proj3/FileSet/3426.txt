Screenshot taken from one of the base examples of the [[open source]] [[Irrlicht Engine|Irrlicht 3d engine]].]] '''Parallax mapping''' (also called '''offset mapping''' or '''virtual displacement mapping''') is an enhancement of the [[bump mapping]] or [[normal mapping]] techniques applied to textures in 3D [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] applications such as [[video game]]s. To the end user, this means that [[texture mapping|textures]] such as stone walls will have more apparent depth and thus greater realism with less of an influence on the performance of the simulation. Parallax mapping was introduced by Tomomichi Kaneko et al.<ref name="Kaneko">Kaneko, T., et al., 2001. [http://vrsj.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ic-at/ICAT2003/papers/01205.pdf Detailed Shape Representation with Parallax Mapping]. In Proceedings of ICAT 2001, pp. 205-208.</ref> in 2001. Parallax mapping is implemented by displacing the texture coordinates at a point on the rendered [[polygon]] by a function of the view angle in tangent space (the angle relative to the surface normal) and the value of the [[height map]] at that point. At steeper view-angles, the texture coordinates are displaced more, giving the illusion of depth due to [[parallax]] effects as the view changes. Parallax mapping described by Kaneko is a single step process that does not account for occlusion. Subsequent enhancements have been made to the algorithm incorporating iterative approaches to allow for occlusion and accurate silhouette rendering<ref name="Tatarchuk">Tatarchuk, N., 2005. [http://ati.amd.com/developer/SIGGRAPH05/Tatarchuk-ParallaxOcclusionMapping-Sketch-print.pdf Practical Dynamic Parallax Occlusion Mapping] Siggraph presentation</ref>. ==Steep parallax mapping== '''Steep parallax mapping''' is one name for the class of algorithms that trace rays against heightfields. The idea is to walk along a ray that has entered the heightfield's volume, finding the intersection point of the ray with the heightfield. This closest intersection is what part of the heightfield is truly visible. '''[[Relief mapping (computer graphics)|Relief mapping]]''' and '''[[parallax occlusion mapping]]''' are other common names for these techniques. '''Interval mapping''' improves on the usual binary search done in relief mapping by creating a line between known inside and outside points and choosing the next sample point by intersecting this line with a ray, rather than using the midpoint as in a traditional binary search. ==See also== *[[Parallax]] ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== *Comparison from the [[Irrlicht Engine]]: [http://www.irrlicht3d.org/images/parallaxmapping.jpg With Parallax mapping] vs. [http://www.irrlicht3d.org/images/noparallaxmapping.jpg Without Parallax mapping] *[http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/topic.asp?topic_id=387447 Parallax mapping implementation in DirectX, forum topic] *[http://cowboyprogramming.com/2007/01/05/parallax-mapped-bullet-holes/ Parallax Mapped Bullet Holes] - Details the algorithm used for F.E.A.R. style bullet holes. *[http://graphics.cs.ucf.edu/IntervalMapping/ Interval Mapping] *[http://jerome.jouvie.free.fr/OpenGl/Projects/Shaders.php Parallax Mapping with Offset Limiting] *[http://graphics.cs.brown.edu/games/SteepParallax/index.html Steep Parallax Mapping] [[Category:Texture mapping]] [[Category:Demo effects]] [[es:Parallax mapping]] [[it:Parallax mapping]] [[ru:Parallax mapping]] [[zh:视差贴图]]</text> </page> <page> <id>28401</id> <title>Parallel Constraint Satisfaction Processes</title> <text>{{orphan|date=December 2009}} '''Parallel Constraint Satisfaction Processes (PCSP)''' is a model that integrates the fastest growing research areas in the study of the mind; [[Connectionism]], [[neural networks]], and [[parallel distributed processing]] models.<ref>Read, S.J., Vanman, E.J. & Miller L.C.

It models an explanation of the dynamic structure of attitudes and the [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]] change involved in [[cognitive dissonance theory]]. PCSP posits that beliefs impose constraints on other beliefs, and conditions can either constrain or make salient different aspects of one’s beliefs. Attitudes and beliefs are therefore changeable, due to trying to satisfactorily fit with the various constraints of circumstances as well as adapt to the constantly evolving truths in life. It is not an alternative to the theory but rather a model that incorporates the many facets of [[cognitive dissonance theory]]. Cognitive dissonance theory centers mainly on: *[[Cognition]] *[[Self]]-Concept *[[Social]] [[Identity (social science)|Identity]] Human beings may give greater importance to one of these areas but no single factor will be the sole influence. The different theories are probably all accurate given the right time, the right place, and the right individual, therefore an integrated more holistic model may better explain the reasons for attitude/behavior inconsistency and the change of attitude following cognitive dissonance. ==Gestalt Psychology and Parallel Constraint Satisfaction Processes== Researchers (Read 1991) have found within [[Gestalt psychology]] an integrated model of explaining attitude change that incorporates neuroscientific and social psychological concepts.<ref name="Read, S.J. 1997">Read, S.J., Vanman, E.J. & Miller L.C.
