It focuses or decorates on the [[head]]-part or the top-side of a seal. It's a kind of [[sculpture]] or mini-sculpture.<ref>[http://www.jysls.com/thread-224593-1-1.html The art of seal's head]</ref><ref>[http://www.9wh.net/Article_Show.asp?ArticleID=5612 Brief introduction to seal's head]</ref><ref>[[Baidu]].com [[Encyclopedia]]: [http://baike.baidu.com/view/1028824.html?fromTaglist The head of seal, and its art]</ref> ==Other possible names== * ''Niu Ke'' ({{zh|t=紐刻|s=纽刻}}): In ancient China such as during the [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]], [[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] and [[Han Dynasty|Han]] Dynasties, the head or top-side of a seal was named ''Niu'' ({{zh|t=紐|s=纽}}). Later it's also known as ''Yin Niu'' ({{zh|t=印紐|s=印纽}}), and ''Yin (印)'' here stands for ''[[Seal (East Asia)|seal]]''. * ''Tou Ke'' ({{zh|t=頭刻|s=头刻}}), or, ''Yintou Ke'' ({{zh|t=印頭刻|s=印头刻|l=the sculpture of (seal's) head}}).

It's made of [[jade]].]] Sometimes in [[museum]], people can see that the head of a Zhou or Qin's seal is a bar, handle/stem, tile, or ring shape. During these periods of time, seals were normally official or used in [[government]] departments by officials. The material to make a seal was normally [[bronze]], [[copper]], or [[iron]] (generally say, [[metal]] materials), because metals are not so easily broken, and they were considered as "immortal", which could represents the authority of the rule or government. Private seals were not so commonly seen and mainly for those very high ranked officials and [[nobility|noble]]s, such as the [[Emperor]]. The head of seal, which was called ''Niu (鈕/钮)'', didn't have so much art elements. Its use was just for the convenience to handle the seal, such as if it's a ring, people could use a [[rope]] to hang the seal on their [[waistband]]s. In [[Han Dynasty]], the head of seal was commonly seen as '''[[turtle]]''' or '''[[pyramid]]''', which has a long life, could have propitious meanings and represents stable, immortal [[authority]] of the government. [[Jade]] materials to make seals were also often used in Han Dynasty. ===Tang, Song Dynasties=== During [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]], [[Song Dynasty|Song]] Dynasties, the governmental seals were still the most dominant, and their style continued those of Han Dynasty. But. in Song Dynasty, especially [[Southern Song Dynasty]], due to the rise of [[artist]] groups and [[scholar]]s, and the prosperity of [[economy]], [[business]], and [[Trade|trading]], the common people also needed to express or identify themselves, private seals became more and more popular, such as a [[businessman]], it was possible that he could had his own seal bearing his name, which can bring convenience and shows his authority in his business. ===Yuan, Ming, Qing Dynasties=== In Late [[Yuan Dynasty]], some famous specialized seal artists or craftsmen appeared, which largely pushed the development of the seal arts. In Mid and Late [[Ming Dynasty]], the seal sculpture became truly popular among artists and scholars for the first time. Together with the [[Kangxi|Kang]]-[[Yongzheng|Yong]]-[[Qianlong|Qian]] period of [[Qing Dynasty]], these two periods are considered as the gold time of seal sculpture. Notably, in this period of time, such as the head of the emperor's seal, it's normally [[Chinese dragon]]s or a [[Qilin]], instead of a turtle. The so called [[Dragon turtle|dragon-turtle]] is also seen. ==General introduction== [[File:Side-engraving of a seal (a poem and remarks).JPG|thumb|right|A seal has a [[frog]] [[sculpture]] and [[seal engraving (art)|side-engraving]] of a poem and remarks. It's a typical combination of these two artistic elements. This seal also belongs to the style of [[rural]] life. It's a ''Xian Zhang'' (閑章/闲章)]] The techniques to make a seal sculpture is just similar to such as make a sculpture in [[marble]]. The difference could be: the head of seal normally is very small and limited, and the sculptor needs special skills and tools to deal such small volume. In ancient Chinese governmental seals, typically such as those of Qing Dynasty, normally they have [[dragon]]s, qilin or dragon-turtle on their head. For many private seals, such as those seals of artists, calligraphists, painters, the style varies a lot. And the seal sculpture of their seals (such as so-called ''Xian Zhang'' (閑章/闲章; roughly translated as "seal of leisure"))<ref>[[Baidu]].com Encyclopedia: [http://baike.baidu.com/view/172928.html 闲章 (Casual seals/seals of leisure)]</ref> can be [[pet]]s, [[landscape]]s, and so on. It could be closer to their daily life or [[rusticity]]. Sometimes, a seal stone has different colours on its surfaces or inside, and the sculptor needs to make a perfect combination of these colours with his/her sculpture, in ancient Chinese, it's called ''Qiao Diao'' (巧雕; roughly translated as "sculpture of cleverness"). It's also commonly seen that seal sculpture is combined with the [[seal engraving (art)|side-engraving of the seal]], and the [[seal cutting (art)|seal cutting]]. All of the three are basic elements to make a perfect seal, or the basic elements of '''seal art'''. ==See also== {{commonscat|Seal sculpture}} * [[Seal cutting (art)]]: focuses on the bottom surface of a seal. * [[Seal engraving (art)]]: focuses on the side surfaces of a seal. * [[Seal (East Asia)]]: seal art of East Asia in general. * [[Seal script]]: character script used in East Asian seals. ==References== <references/> ===Sources=== * ''[[Shuowen
