MCTDH can thus determine the quantal motion of the nuclei of a [[molecule|molecular system]] evolving on one or several [[vibronic coupling|coupled]] electronic [[potential energy surface]]s. MCTDH by its very nature is an approximate method. However, it can be made as accurate as any competing method, but its numerical efficiency deteriorates with growing accuracy. MCTDH is designed for multi-dimensional problems, in particular for problems that are difficult or even impossible to attack in a conventional way. There is no or only little gain when treating systems with less than three [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] by MCTDH. MCTDH will in general be best suited for systems with 4 to 12 degrees of freedom. Because of hardware limitations it may in general not be possible to treat much larger systems. For a certain class of problems, however, one can go much further. The MCTDH program package has recently been generalised to enable the propagation of [[density operator]]s. ==References== H. D.

Whereas in a typical [[multi-access key]] the choice of characters used for identification can be repeated multiple times (reducing the number of remaining taxa each time), in literally multi-''entry'' keys only the first step involves a free choice of characters. Examples for multi-entry keys are the keys created by the [[FRIDA]] software, where a single step of selecting one or multiple criteria is followed by a dichotomous key for the species remaining after this step.

Due to the limited memory of these computers, games were initially fairly simple, in order to keep the size of the program code as small as possible, as games would be loaded into memory in their entirety. In time, however, developers began creating games that loaded in only the parts of the game that could be accommodated by the memory constraints (typically 48 or 64[[kilobytes|K]] of [[RAM]]). This multi-load approach allowed much larger and complex games to be created, and also allowed games to be created as a series of smaller games (such as [[RoboCop]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=Crash/Issue59/Pages/Crash5900022.jpg|title=RoboCop Review|publisher=[[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]]|date=December 1988}}</ref>) The user would usually be prompted to stop the [[Compact Cassette|tape]] when the section had loaded, then prompted to "Press play on tape" when the next section was required (the 8-bit music [[tribute band]], ''Press Play on Tape'' use this phrase as their name). With the advent of the 128K versions of the Spectrum and Commodore, many games that would previously have required multi-loading could be loaded into memory in their entirety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://z80heaven.com/content/view/42/41/|title=The ZX Spectrum 128|publisher=Z80 Heaven|accessdate=2008-03-18}}</ref> == References == {{reflist}} {{8bitcomputer-game-stub}} [[Category:Video game hardware]]</text> </page> <page> <id>25259</id> <title>Multi-master replication</title> <text>'''Multi-master replication''' is a method of database [[replication (computer science)|replication]] which allows data to be stored by a group of computers, and updated by any member of the group. The multi-master replication system is responsible for propagating the data modifications made by each member to the rest of the group, and resolving any conflicts that might arise between concurrent changes made by different members. Multi-master replication can be contrasted with [[Master-slave_(computers)|master-slave]] replication, in which a single member of the group is designated as the "master" for a given piece of data and is the only node allowed to modify that data item. Other members wishing to modify the data item must first contact the master node. Allowing only a single master makes it easier to achieve consistency among the members of the group, but is less flexible than multi-master replication. ==Advantages== * If one master fails, other masters will continue to update the [[database]]. * Masters can be located in several physical sites i.e. distributed across the network. ==Disadvantages== * Most multi-master replication systems are only loosely consistent, i.e. lazy and asynchronous, violating [[ACID]] properties. * Eager replication systems are complex and introduce some communication latency. * Issues such as conflict resolution can become intractable as the number of nodes involved rises and the required latency decreases. ==Methods== ===Log-Based=== A [[database transaction]] log is referenced to capture changes made to the database. For log-based transaction capturing, database changes can only be distributed [[asynchronous]]ly. ===Trigger-Based=== Triggers at the subscriber capture changes made to the database and submit them to the publisher. With trigger-based transaction capturing, database changes can be distributed either [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronously]] or [[asynchronous]]ly. ==Implementations== Many directory servers based on [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]] implement multi-master replication. ===Active Directory=== One of the more prevalent of multi-master replication implementations in directory servers is [[Microsoft]]'s [[Active Directory]].
