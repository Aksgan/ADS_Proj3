and its license did not permit the redistribution of modified versions of the library. This spurred the need for [[free software]] or [[open source]] reimplementations of the API from scratch. The first such library was [[freeglut]], which aims to be a reasonably close reproduction, though introducing a small number of new functions to deal with GLUT's limitations. [http://sourceforge.net/projects/openglut/ OpenGLUT], a [[fork (software)|fork]] of freeglut, adds a number of new features to the original API, but work on it ceased in May 2005. == Limitations == Some of GLUT's original design decisions made it hard for programmers to perform desired tasks. This led many to create non-canon patches and extensions to GLUT.[http://www.mathies.com/glfaq/GLToolkitFAQ.html#II] Some [[free software]] or [[open source]] reimplementations also include fixes. Some of the more notable limitations of the original GLUT library include: * The library requires programmers to call <code>glutMainLoop()</code>, a function which never returns. This makes it hard for programmers to integrate GLUT into a program or library which wishes to have control of its own event loop. A common patch to fix this is to introduce a new function, often called <code>glutCheckLoop()</code>, which runs only a single iteration of the GLUT event loop. Another common workaround is to run GLUT's event loop in a separate [[thread (computing)|thread]], although this may vary by operating system, and also may introduce [[synchronization (computer science)|synchronization]] issues or other problems: for example, the Mac OS X GLUT implementation requires that <code>glutMainLoop()</code> be run in the main thread. * The fact that <code>glutMainLoop()</code> never returns also means that a GLUT program cannot exit the event loop. [[freeglut]] fixes this by introducing a new function, <code>glutLeaveMainLoop()</code>. * The library terminates the process when the window is closed; for some applications this may not be desired. Thus, many implementations include an extra callback, such as <code>glutWMCloseFunc()</code>. Since it is no longer maintained (essentially replaced by the [[OpenSource]] [[freeglut]]) the above design issues are still not resolved in the original GLUT. == See also == * [[OpenGL Utility Library]] (GLU) * [[OpenGL User Interface Library]] (GLUI) * [[freeglut]] * [[Simple DirectMedia Layer]] (SDL) == External links == *[http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/ GLUT - The OpenGL Utility Toolkit] *[http://www.opengl.org/documentation/specs/glut/spec3/spec3.html GLUT documentation] *[http://openglut.sourceforge.net/ OpenGLUT] *[http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/ FreeGLUT] *[http://www.lighthouse3d.com/opengl/glut/index.php?1 GLUT Tutorial for C/C++] *[http://nehe.gamedev.net/ Glut tutorial with many lessons (Very in-depth) for C] *[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537011.aspx List of OpenGL functions for Windows (GL and GLU, not GLUT)] *[http://www.xmission.com/~nate/glut.html GLUT for WIN32] (found from [[ARToolKit]] readme) *[http://www.nigels.com/glt/devpak/ GLUT Packages for Dev C++ users] *[http://www.paked.net/subject_pages/computer_science/Articles/installing_glut.htm GLUT Installation for Dev C++ ] *[http://students.iiit.ac.in/~rajatgoel/stuff.html GLUT Installation for Dev C++ ] [[Category:OpenGL]] [[bs:GLUT]] [[cs:GLUT]] [[de:OpenGL Utility Toolkit]] [[es:GLUT]] [[fr:OpenGL utility toolkit]] [[ko:OpenGL 유틸리티 툴킷]] [[it:OpenGL Utility Toolkit]] [[ja:OpenGL Utility Toolkit]] [[pl:GLUT (informatyka)]] [[pt:GLUT]] [[ru:GLUT]] [[fi:GLUT]] [[tr:GLUT (yazılım)]] [[uk:GLUT]] [[zh:GLUT]]</text> </page> <page> <id>27414</id> <title>OpenOpt</title> <text>[[File:OO NLP 1.png|thumb]] [[File:OO bench 1.png|thumb]] '''OpenOpt''' is an open-source optimization framework licensed under the [[BSD licenses|BSD]] license, making it available to be used in both open- and closed-code software. The framework interfaces with many different algorithms for solving [http://openopt.org/Problems optimization problems] (solvers), both free (e.g. [[IPOPT]], Algencan, [[GLPK]]) and commercial (e.g. [[CPLEX]]). Some solvers are written in [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[Fortran]], and there are some Python-written own ones (e.g., [http://openopt.org/ralg ralg]). OpenOpt-connected solvers can have any type of license, but are primarily open source and OSI-approved ones such as [[GPL]], [[LGPL]], and [[BSD licenses|BSD]]. Originally developed in [[MATLAB]], OpenOpt is now developed in [[Python programming language|Python]] and has a single dependence: [[NumPy]] (numerical package for low-level matrix operations, well-known for [[Python_language|Python]] language programmers, with some code written in C, Fortran languages and wrappers to [[BLAS]], [[LAPACK]], [[ACML]], [[Math_Kernel_Library|MKL]] etc). This makes OpenOpt easy to install and OS-independent. If you have a model written in [[FuncDesigner]] (another software from OpenOpt developers), it can be optimized with first derivatives obtained via [[Automatic differentiation]]. Also, it can be used mere like a language of mathematical formulas, possibly with recursive import of variables/formulas from other files. Both OpenOpt and [[FuncDesigner]] can solve constrained large-scale problems involving [[Sparse_matrix|sparse matrices]]. The software already has some essential [http://openopt.org/Applications applications] and is expected to become even more popular with [http://forum.openopt.org/viewtopic.php?id=67 Python release 3.3, where Just-In-Time accelerator will be done]. You can try OpenOpt and FuncDesigner on-line (without installation) via the [http://openopt.org/TryOnline SAGE-server] Also OpenOpt website powers a numerical optimization forum. ==External links== * OpenOpt [http://openopt.org homepage] * FuncDesigner [http://www.openopt.org/FuncDesigner homepage] * [http://www.openopt.org/DerApproximator DerApproximator] * [http://www.openopt.org/PythonIntroduction Very brief description of Python language syntax] * [http://scipy.org SciPy homepage] * [http://numpy.org NumPy homepage] [[Category:Numerical software]] [[Category:Mathematical optimization software]] [[Category:Python libraries]] [[Category:Free science software]] [[Category:Free mathematics software]] [[Category:Linux numerical analysis software]] [[Category:Free software programmed in Python]] [[Category:Data analysis software]] [[Category:Operations research]]</text> </page> <page> <id>27423</id> <title>OpenRT</title> <text>The goal of the "'''OpenRT''' Real Time Ray Tracing Project" is to develop [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] to the point where it offers an alternative to the current rasterization based approach for interactive 3D graphics.

OpenRT is not [[Open Source]]; it is intended to be an open API similar to [[OpenGL]].
