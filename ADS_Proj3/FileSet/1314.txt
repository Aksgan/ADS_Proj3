can make the design of these amplifiers extremely difficult. One of the pioneers in high bandwidth vertical amplifiers was the [[Tektronix]] company. ====Distributed amplifiers==== {{Main|Distributed Amplifier}} These use [[transmission line]]s to temporally split the signal and amplify each portion separately in order to achieve higher [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] than can be obtained from a single amplifying device. The outputs of each stage are combined in the output transmission line. This type of amplifier was commonly used on [[oscilloscope]]s as the final vertical amplifier. The transmission lines were often housed inside the display tube glass envelope. ====Switched mode amplifiers==== These nonlinear amplifiers have much higher efficiencies than linear amps, and are used where the power saving justifies the extra complexity. ====Negative resistance devices==== [[Negative resistance]]s can be used as amplifiers, such as the [[tunnel diode]] amplifier. === Microwave amplifiers === ====Travelling wave tube amplifiers==== {{Main|Traveling wave tube}} [[Traveling wave tube]] amplifiers (TWTAs) are used for high power amplification at low microwave frequencies. They typically can amplify across a broad spectrum of frequencies; however, they are usually not as tunable as klystrons. ====Klystrons==== {{Main|Klystron}} Klystrons are vacuum-devices that do not have as wide a bandwidth as TWTAs. They generally are also much heavier than TWTAs, and are therefore ill-suited for light-weight mobile applications. Klystrons are tunable, offering selective output within their specified frequency range. ===Musical instrument (audio) amplifiers=== {{Main|Instrument amplifier|Audio amplifier}} An audio amplifier is usually used to amplify signals such as music or speech. == Classification of amplifier stages and systems == {{Unreferenced section|date=October 2008}} There are many alternative classifications that address different aspects of amplifier designs, and they all express some particular perspective relating the design parameters to the objectives of the circuit. Amplifier design is always a compromise of numerous factors, such as cost, power consumption, real-world device imperfections, and a multitude of performance specifications. Below are several different approaches to classification: === Input and output variables === [[Image:Dependent Sources.PNG|thumbnail|300px|The four types of dependent source; control variable on left, output variable on right]] Electronic amplifiers use two variables: current and voltage. Either can be used as input, and either as output leading to four types of amplifiers. In idealized form they are represented by each of the four types of dependent source used in linear analysis, as shown in the figure, namely: {| class="wikitable" style="background:white;text-align:center " !Input !Output !Dependent source !Amplifier type |- |-valign="top" | '''I''' | '''I''' | current controlled current source '''CCCS''' | current amplifier |- |-valign="top" | '''I''' | '''V''' | current controlled voltage source '''CCVS''' | [[transresistance]] amplifier |- |-valign="top" | '''V''' | '''I''' | voltage controlled current source '''VCCS''' | [[transconductance]] amplifier |- |-valign="top" | '''V''' | '''V''' | voltage controlled voltage source '''VCVS''' | voltage amplifier |} Each type of amplifier in its ideal form has an ideal input and output resistance that is the same as that of the corresponding dependent source:<ref>It is a curiosity to note that this table is a [http://www.swemorph.com/ma.html "Zwicky box"]; in particular, it encompasses all possibilities. See [[Fritz Zwicky]].</ref> {| class="wikitable" style="background:white;text-align:center " !Amplifier type !Dependent source !Input impedance !Output impedance |- |-valign="top" | '''Current''' | '''CCCS''' | '''0''' | '''∞''' |- |-valign="top" | '''Transresistance''' | '''CCVS''' | '''0''' | '''0''' |- |-valign="top" | '''Transconductance''' | '''VCCS''' | '''∞''' | '''∞''' |- |-valign="top" | '''Voltage''' | '''VCVS''' | '''∞''' | '''0''' |} In practice the ideal impedances are only approximated. For any particular circuit, a small-signal analysis is often used to find the impedance actually achieved. A small-signal AC test current ''I<sub>x</sub>'' is applied to the input or output node, all external sources are set to AC zero, and the corresponding alternating voltage ''V<sub>x</sub>'' across the test current source determines the impedance seen at that node as ''R = V<sub>x</sub> / I<sub>x</sub>''. Amplifiers designed to attach to a [[transmission line]] at input and/or output, especially [[RF power amplifier|RF amplifiers]], do not fit into this classification approach. Rather than dealing with voltage or current individually, they ideally couple with an input and/or output impedance matched to the transmission line impedance, that is, match ''ratios'' of voltage to current. Many real RF amplifiers come close to this ideal. Although, for a given appropriate source and load impedance, RF amplifiers can be characterized as amplifying voltage or current, they fundamentally are amplifying power.<ref>{{cite book | title = Vsats: Very Small Aperture Terminals | author = John Everett | publisher = IET | year = 1992 | isbn = 0863412009 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=MWuXmf4V4NwC&pg=PA84&dq=amplifier+impedance+transmission-line++dB&as_brr=3&ei=nsyFR5GqJ6eGtgPX4rXQBQ&sig=Lwap3QvlOSI2ClwZlO4MM4BcD_A#PPA81,M1 }}</ref> === Common terminal === One set of classifications for amplifiers is based on which device terminal is common to both the input and the output circuit. In the case of [[bipolar junction transistor]]s, the three classes are [[common emitter]], [[common base]], and [[common collector]]. For [[field-effect transistor]]s, the corresponding configurations are [[common source]], [[common gate]], and [[common drain]]; for [[Vacuum tube|triode vacuum devices]], ''common cathode'', ''common grid'', and ''common plate''. The output voltage of a common plate amplifier is the same as the input (this arrangement is used as the input presents a high impedance and does not load the signal source, although it does not amplify the voltage), i.e., the output at the cathode follows the input at the grid; consequently it was commonly called a ''cathode follower''. By analogy the terms ''emitter follower'' and ''source follower'' are sometimes used. === Unilateral or bilateral === When an amplifier has an output that exhibits no feedback to its input side, it is called '''unilateral'''. The input impedance of a unilateral amplifier is independent of the load, and the output impedance is independent of the signal source impedance. If feedback connects part of the output back to the input of the amplifier it is called a '''bilateral''' amplifier. The input impedance of a bilateral amplifier is dependent upon the load, and the output impedance is dependent upon the signal source impedance. All amplifiers are bilateral to some degree; however they may often be modeled as unilateral under operating conditions where feedback is small enough to neglect for
