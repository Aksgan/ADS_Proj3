that…" In ordinary speech both metaphysical and epistemic modalities are often expressed in similar words; the following contrasts may help: A person, Jones, might reasonably say ''both'': (1) "No, it is ''not'' possible that [[Bigfoot]] exists; I am quite certain of that"; ''and'', (2) "Sure, Bigfoot possibly ''could'' exist". What Jones means by (1) is that given all the available information, there is no question remaining as to whether Bigfoot exists. This is an epistemic claim. By (2) he makes the ''metaphysical'' claim that it is ''possible for'' Bigfoot to exist, ''even though he does not'' (which is not equivalent to "it is ''possible that'' Bigfoot exists – for all I know", which contradicts (1)). From the other direction, Jones might say, (3) "It is ''possible'' that [[Goldbach's conjecture]] is true; but also ''possible'' that it is false", and ''also'' (4) "if it ''is'' true, then it is necessarily true, and not possibly false". Here Jones means that it is ''epistemically possible'' that it is true or false, for all he knows (Goldbach's conjecture has not been proven either true or false), but if there ''is'' a proof (heretofore undiscovered), then it would show that it is not ''logically'' possible for Goldbach's conjecture to be false—there could be no set of numbers that violated it. Logical possibility is a form of ''alethic'' possibility; (4) makes a claim about whether it is possible (i.e., logically speaking) that a mathematical truth to have been false, but (3) only makes a claim about whether it is possible, for all Jones knows, (i.e., speaking of certitude) that the mathematical claim is specifically either true or false, and so again Jones does not contradict himself. It is worthwhile to observe that Jones is not necessarily correct: It is possible (epistemically) that Goldbach's conjecture is both true and unprovable.<ref>See [[Goldbach's_conjecture#Origins|Goldbach's conjecture > Origins]]</ref> Epistemic possibilities also bear on the actual world in a way that metaphysical possibilities do not. Metaphysical possibilities bear on ways the world ''might have been,'' but epistemic possibilities bear on the way the world ''may be'' (for all we know). Suppose, for example, that I want to know whether or not to take an umbrella before I leave. If you tell me "it is ''possible that'' it is raining outside" – in the sense of epistemic possibility – then that would weigh on whether or not I take the umbrella. But if you just tell me that "it is ''possible for'' it to rain outside" – in the sense of ''metaphysical possibility'' – then I am no better off for this bit of modal enlightenment. Some features of epistemic modal logic are in debate. For example, if ''x'' knows that ''p'', does ''x'' know that it knows that ''p''? That is to say, should <math>\Box P \rightarrow \Box \Box P</math> be an axiom in these systems? While the answer to this question is unclear, there is at least one axiom that ''must'' be included in epistemic modal logic, because it is minimally true of all modal logics (see [[Modal_logic#Axiomatic_systems|the section on axiomatic systems]]): * '''K''', ''Distribution Axiom'': <!--[](''p'' → ''q'') → ([]p → []q)--> <math> \Box (p \rightarrow q) \rightarrow (\Box p \rightarrow \Box q)</math>. But this is disconcerting, because with '''K''', we can prove that we know all the logical consequences of our beliefs: If ''q'' is a logical consequence of ''p'', then <math> \Box (p \rightarrow q)</math>. And if so, then we can deduce that <math>(\Box p \rightarrow \Box q)</math> using '''K'''. When we translate this into epistemic terms, this says that if ''q'' is a logical consequence of ''p'', then we know that it is, and if we know ''p'', we know ''q''. That is to say, we know all the logical consequences of our beliefs. This must be true for all possible [[Kripke semantics|Kripkean]] modal interpretations of epistemic cases where <math>\Box</math> is translated as "knows that". But then, for example, if ''x'' knows that prime numbers are divisible only by themselves and the number one, then ''x'' knows that 8683317618811886495518194401279999999 is prime (since this number is only divisible by itself and the number one). That is to say, under the modal interpretation of knowledge, anyone who knows the definition of a prime number knows that this number is prime. This shows that epistemic modal logic is an idealized account of knowledge, and explains objective, rather than subjective knowledge (if anything). ==Temporal logic== {{Main|Temporal logic}} Temporal logic is an approach to the semantics of expressions with [[Grammatical tense|tense]], that is, expressions with qualifications of when. Some expressions, such as '2 + 2 = 4', are true at all times, while tensed expressions such as 'John is happy' are only true sometimes. In temporal logic, tense constructions are treated in terms of modalities, where a standard method for formalizing talk of time is to use ''two'' pairs of operators, one for the past and one for the future (P will just mean 'it is presently the case that P'). For example: :'''F'''''P'' : It will sometimes be the case that ''P'' :'''G'''''P'' : It will always be the case that ''P'' :'''P'''''P'' : It was sometime the case that ''P'' :'''H'''''P'' : It has always been the case that ''P'' There are then at least three modal logics that we can develop. For example, we can stipulate that, :<math> \Diamond P </math> = ''P'' is the case at some time ''t'' :<math> \Box P </math> = ''P'' is the case at every time ''t'' Or we can trade these operators to deal only with the future (or past). For example, :<math> \Diamond_1 P </math> = '''F'''''P'' :<math> \Box_1 P </math> = '''G'''''P'' or, :<math> \Diamond_2 P</math> = ''P'' and/or '''F'''''P'' :<math> \Box_2 P </math> = ''P'' and '''G'''''P'' The operators '''F''' and '''G''' may seem initially foreign, but they create [[normal modal logic|normal modal systems]]. Note that '''F'''''P'' is the same as ¬'''G'''¬''P''. We can combine the above operators to form complex statements. For example, '''P'''''P'' → <math> \Box </math>'''P'''''P''
