GTX 280 support HybridPower.<ref>[http://www.NVIDIA.com/object/hybrid_sli.html NVIDIA Hybrid SLI page]</ref> Nevertheless, the most common cards which can be purchased nowadays do not support HybridPower, as manufacturer of the cards do not place the necessary PIC16F690 on the Graphic-PCB. Although for all users the switching is possible with tray icon, only a handful cardtypes have the ability to switch off the power completely. There is Kernel level support in Linux as of 2.6.34 <ref>[http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=150127]</ref> However user tools to actually use the feature are fairly primitive at this time. ==Caveats== * In an SLI configuration, cards can be of mixed manufacturers, card model names, BIOS revisions or clock speeds. However, they must be of the same GPU series (e.g. 8600, 8800) and GPU model name (e.g. GT, GTS, GTX).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.slizone.com/page/slizone_faq.html#c3 | title=SLI FAQs | accessdate=2008-12-04 | work=NVIDIA}}</ref> There are rare exceptions for "mixed SLI" configurations on some cards that only have a matching core codename (e.g. G70, G73, G80, etc.), but this is otherwise not possible, and only happens when two matched cards differ only very slightly, an example being a differing amount of video memory, stream processors, or clockspeed. In this case, the slower/lesser card becomes dominant, and the other card matches. Another exception is the GTS 250, which can SLI with the 9800 GTX+, as the GTS 250 GPU is a rebadged 9800 GTX+ GPU. * In cases where two cards are not identical, the fastest card – or the card with more memory - will run at the speed of the slower card or disable its additional memory. (Note that while the FAQ still claims different memory size support, the support has been removed since revision 100.xx of NVIDIA's Forceware driver suite.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.slizone.com/page/slizone_faq.html#c3 | title=SLI FAQs | accessdate=2007-05-05 | work=NVIDIA}}</ref>) * SLI doesn't always give a performance benefit – in some extreme cases, it can lower the [[frame rate]] due to the particulars of an application's coding.<ref>{{cite news | title=Performance Comparison Between Single Configurations And SLI Setups | work=[[Tom's Hardware]] | url=http://www.tomshardware.com/2005/12/02/vga_charts_viii/page20.html | first=Tino | last=Kreiss | coauthors=Töpelt, Bert, Schuhmann, Daniel | date=2005-12-02 | accessdate=2007-06-01}}</ref> This is also true for ATI's CrossFire, as the problem is inherent in multi-GPU systems. This is often witnessed when running an application at low resolutions. * In order to use SLI, a motherboard with an [[nForce4]], [[nForce 500]], [[nForce 600]] or [[nForce 700]] SLI chipset must be used, although with the use of hacks and older drivers, one can make SLI work on motherboards with [[Intel]], [[ATI]] and [[Acer Laboratories Incorporated|ULi]] chipsets. NVIDIA has stated that only their own chipsets can allow SLI to function optimally, and that they will not allow SLI to work on any other vendor's chipsets. Some early SLI systems used Intel's E7525 [[Xeon]] chipset, which caused problems when NVIDIA started locking out other vendor's chipsets as it limited them to an outdated driver set. In 2007, Intel has licensed NVIDIA's SLI technology for its [[Intel SkullTrail|SkullTrail]] platform, and select motherboards supporting the [[Intel X58]] (Tylersburg) chipset have unlocked SLI capabilities. Not all X58 motherboards support this technology, as NVIDIA offered it to motherboard manufacturers at the cost of $5 per motherboard sold.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.xbitlabs.com/news/mainboards/display/20081020235121_Mainboard_Makers_Set_to_Pay_NVIDIA_5_Per_Mainboard_for_SLI_License.html | title=Mainboard Makers Set to Pay NVIDIA $5 per Mainboard for SLI License | accessdate=2009-01-01}}</ref> * [[Vertical synchronization|Vsync]] + [[Triple buffering]] is not supported in some cases in SLI AFR mode. * Users having a Hybrid SLI setup must manually change modes between ''HybridPower'' and ''GeForce Boost'', while automatically changing mode will not be available until future updates become available. Hybrid SLI currently supports only single link DVI at 1920x1200 screen resolution.<ref>[http://www.bit-tech.net/hardware/2008/01/22/NVIDIA_hybrid_sli_preview_part_2/2 Bit-Tech interview] (page 2), retrieved January 23, 2008</ref> * When using SLI with [[Alternate Frame Rendering|AFR]], the subjective framerate can often be lower than the framerate reported by benchmarking applications, and may even be poorer than the framerate of its single-GPU equivalent. This phenomenon is known as [[micro stuttering]] and also applies to CrossFire since it's inherent to multi-GPU configurations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgameshardware.com/aid,631668 |title=Video proof: Micro stuttering may destroy the performance gains from current multi GPU technologies |author=Raffael Vötter |date=2008-02-08 |publisher=PC Games Hardware Online |accessdate=2009-11-03 }}</ref> ==See also== * [[Scan-Line Interleave]] by [[3Dfx]] * [[ATI CrossFire]] – [[ATI Technologies|ATI]]'s competing solution * [[MultiChrome]] * [[Micro stuttering]] ==References== {{More footnotes|date=June 2009}} {{Reflist|2}} ==External links== *[http://www.slizone.com NVIDIA's Official SLI Technology website] *[http://www.slizone.com/object/slizone2_game.html NVIDIA's SLI Zone: SLI-optimized games] *[http://www.NVIDIA.com/page/technology_vista_home.html NVIDIA's Windows Vista Capable GPUs] *Article "[http://www.bit-tech.net/hardware/2004/06/30/multi_gpu_tech/1.html Multiple Graphics Card Technology]" by Tim Smalley *Article "[http://www.hexus.net/content/item.php?item=916 NVIDIA's SLI: An Introduction]" by Ryszard Sommefeldt *Article "[http://theinquirer.net/?article=28839 Dell's Quad SLI: A Story in Pictures]" by Charlie Demerjian *Article "[http://hardocp.com/article.html?art=NzQ3 NVIDIA SLI Support - Getting Better]" by Brent Justice *[http://firingsquad.com/hardware/NVIDIA_quad_sli/default.asp NVIDIA's Quad SLI: Demystifying the rumors] by Brandon Bell *Article "[http://www.bit-tech.net/hardware/2006/05/01/quad_sli_geforce_7900_gx2/1.html Quad SLI: GeForce 7900 GX2]" by Tim Smalley *Article "[http://www.bit-tech.net/hardware/2006/08/09/quad_sli_part_deux_diy_build/1.html Quad SLI part deux: Build It Yourself]" by Tim Smalley *Article "[http://www.pcper.com/article.php?aid=222 NVIDIA and Havok bring SLI physics to life]." *Article "[http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/391 SLI vs. CrossFire]" by Gabriel Torres *[http://www.slizone.com/object/sli_cuda_learn.html NVIDIA SLI with CUDA] {{NVIDIA}} [[Category:Video cards]] [[Category:Nvidia]] [[ar:واجهة توصيل قابلة للتوسع]] [[bs:SLI]] [[cs:Scalable Link Interface]] [[de:Scalable Link Interface]] [[es:Scalable Link Interface]] [[et:Mastabeeritav ühendusliides]] [[fr:Scalable Link Interface]] [[ko:스케일러블 링크 인터페이스]] [[it:Scalable Link Interface]] [[hu:Scalable Link Interface]] [[nl:Scalable Link Interface]] [[ja:Scalable Link Interface]] [[no:SLI]] [[pl:SLI]] [[pt:Scalable Link Interface]] [[ru:NVIDIA SLI]] [[sr:SLI]] [[fi:Scalable Link Interface]] [[sv:Scalable Link Interface]] [[tr:SLI]] [[zh:NVIDIA SLI]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33259</id> <title>Scannerless Boolean Parser</title> <text>{{Infobox_Software | name = SBP | developer = [[Adam Megacz]] | <!-- currently no snapshot available --> <!-- latest_release_version = [[snapshot]] | latest release date = March 8, 2008 | --> platform = [[Java Virtual Machine]] | genre = [[Parser generator]] | license = [[BSD license]] | website = [http://research.cs.berkeley.edu/project/sbp/] | }} The '''Scannerless Boolean Parser''' is a [[free software]] [[scannerless parsing|scannerless]] [[GLR parser]] generator for [[boolean grammar]]s.
