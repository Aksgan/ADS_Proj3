By the sixth century the Hindus were far ahead of Europe in industrial chemistry; they were masters of calcination, distillation, sublimation, steaming, fixation, the production of light without heat, the mixing of anesthetic and soporific powders, and the preparation of metallic salts, compounds and alloys. The tempering of steel was brought in ancient India to a perfection unknown in Europe till our own times; King Porus is said to have selected, as a specially valuable gift from Alexander, not gold or silver, but thirty pounds of steel. The Moslems took much of this Hindu chemical science and industry to the Near East and Europe; the secret of manufacturing "Damascus" blades, for example, was taken by the Arabs from the Persians, and by the Persians from India.""}}</ref> The emergence of chemistry in Europe was primarily due to the recurrent incidence of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] and blights there during the so called [[Dark Ages]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} This gave rise to a need for medicines.

[[Paracelsus]] (1493&ndash;1541), for example, rejected the 4-elemental theory and with only a vague understanding of his chemicals and medicines, formed a hybrid of alchemy and science in what was to be called ''[[iatrochemistry]]''. Similarly, the influences of philosophers such as [[Francis Bacon|Sir Francis Bacon]] (1561&ndash;1626) and [[René Descartes]] (1596&ndash;1650), who demanded more rigor in mathematics and in removing bias from scientific observations, led to a [[scientific revolution]]. In chemistry, this began with [[Robert Boyle]] (1627&ndash;1691), who came up with an equation known as [[Boyle's Law]] about the characteristics of gaseous state.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/boyle_robert.shtml BBC - History - Robert Boyle (1627 - 1691)]</ref> Chemistry indeed came of age when [[Antoine Lavoisier]] (1743&ndash;1794), developed the theory of [[Conservation of mass]] in 1783; and the development of the [[Atomic Theory]] by [[John Dalton]] around 1800. The Law of Conservation of Mass resulted in the reformulation of chemistry based on this law{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} and the oxygen theory of combustion, which was largely based on the work of Lavoisier. Lavoisier's fundamental contributions to chemistry were a result of a conscious effort{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} to fit all experiments into the framework of a single theory. He established the consistent use of the chemical balance, used oxygen to overthrow the [[phlogiston theory]], and developed a new system of chemical nomenclature and made contribution to the modern metric system. Lavoisier also worked to translate the archaic and technical language of chemistry into something that could be easily understood by the largely uneducated masses, leading to an increased public interest in chemistry. All these advances in chemistry led to what is usually called the [[chemical revolution]]. The contributions of Lavoisier led to what is now called modern chemistry&mdash;the chemistry that is studied in educational institutions all over the world. It is because of these and other contributions that [[Antoine Lavoisier]] is often celebrated as the "[[People known as the father or mother of something|Father of Modern Chemistry]]".<ref>{{Cite book|title = Affinity, that Elusive Dream: A Genealogy of the Chemical Revolution | author = Mi Gyung Kim | publisher = MIT Press | year = 2003 |page = 440|isbn = 0262112736}}</ref> The later discovery of [[Friedrich Wöhler]] that many natural substances, [[organic compound]]s, can indeed be synthesized in a chemistry [[laboratory]] also helped the modern chemistry to mature from its infancy.<ref>{{Cite book| title = The Development of Modern Chemistry | author = Ihde, Aaron John | publisher = Courier Dover Publications | year = 1984 | page = 164 | isbn = 0486642356}}</ref> The [[discoveries of the chemical elements|discovery of the chemical elements]] has a long history from the days of alchemy and culminating in the discovery of the [[periodic table]] of the chemical elements by [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] (1834&ndash;1907)<ref>[http://chemistry.about.com/library/weekly/aa030303a.htm Timeline of Element Discovery] - About.com</ref> and later discoveries of some [[synthetic elements]]. ==Etymology== {{Main|Chemistry (etymology)}} The word ''chemistry'' comes from the earlier study of alchemy, which is a set of practices that encompasses elements of chemistry, metallurgy, philosophy, astrology, astronomy, mysticism and medicine. Alchemy in turn is derived from the [[Arabic]] word "كيمياء" meaning "value"; it is commonly thought of as the quest to turn lead or another common starting material into gold.<ref>[http://www.alchemylab.com/history_of_alchemy.htm Alchemy Lab: History of Alchemy]</ref> This linguistic relation between the pursuit of value and alchemy is thought to have [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] origins. Many believe that the Arabic word "alchemy" is derived from the word '''Chemi''' or '''Kimi''', which is the ancient name of [[Egypt]] in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]].<ref>Science and Civilisation in China, by Joseph Needham, page 47.
