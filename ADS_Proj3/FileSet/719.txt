It operates on signed [[integer]]s, [[rational numbers]], [[floating point]] numbers, [[complex numbers]], [[modular arithmetic|modular]] numbers, and univariate [[polynomial]]s. Its implementation [[programming language]] is [[C++]]. CLN uses [[object oriented]] techniques and [[operator overloading]] to achieve a natural [[algebra]]ic syntax: The sum ''x'' of two variables ''a'' and ''b'' is written as ''x''=''a''+''b'', as opposed to the function sum(&''x'',''a'',''b''). CLN uses [[Inheritance (computer science)|class inheritance]] to model the natural [[subset]]s of the available number types: E.g. the integer class is a subtype of the rational class, just as the integer numbers are a subset of the rational numbers. The complex numbers and all its subtypes behave exactly like the types of numbers known to the [[Common Lisp]] language, giving CLN another meaning: it becomes an abbreviation of ''Common Lisp Numbers''. Due to this, CLN can be and is used for implementations of Common Lisp, other interpreted languages, or [[computer algebra system]]s. The implementation is efficient. It can be configured to use the [[GNU Multi-Precision Library]] as kernel for speed-critical [[inner loop]]s and implements advanced algorithms like [[Schönhage-Strassen algorithm|Schönhage-Strassen multiplication]], [[binary splitting]] and others. All CLN objects are either immediate or [[Reference counting|reference counted]], providing for non-interruptive [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] with no burden on the main application. == External links == *[http://www.ginac.de/CLN/ CLN website] [[Category:Free software programmed in C++]] [[Category:Numerical software]] [[Category:Pi software]]</text> </page> <page> <id>6388</id> <title>Classful network</title> <text>A '''classful network''' is a network addressing architecture used in the [[Internet]] from 1981 until the introduction of [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] in 1993. The method divides the [[IP address|address]] space for Internet Protocol Version 4 ([[IPv4]]) into five address classes. Each class, coded in the first four bits of the address, defines either a different network size, i.e. number of [[Host (network)|hosts]] for [[unicast]] addresses (classes A, B, C), or a [[multicast]] network (class D). The fifth class (E) address range is reserved for future or experimental purposes. Since its discontinuation, remnants of classful network concepts remain in practice only in limited scope in the default configuration parameters of some network software and hardware components (e.g., default [[subnet mask]]), but the terms are often still heard in general discussions of network structure among network administrators. [[Image:Internet map in February 82.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Map of the prototype Internet in [[1982]], showing 8-bit-numbered networks (ovals) only, interconnected by [[router]]s (rectangles).]] ==Background== Originally, a 32-bit IPv4 address was logically subdivided into the ''network number'' field, the most-significant 8 bits of an address, which specified the particular network a host was attached to, and the local address, also called ''rest field'' (the rest of the address), which uniquely identifies a host connected to that network. This format was sufficient at a time when only a few large networks existed, such as the [[ARPANET]] which was assigned the network number 10, and before the wide proliferation of [[local area network]]s (LANs). As a consequence of this architecture, the address space supported only a low number (254) of independent networks, and it became clear very early on that this would not be enough. ==Introduction of address classes== Expansion of the network had to ensure compatibility with the existing address space and the [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) packet
