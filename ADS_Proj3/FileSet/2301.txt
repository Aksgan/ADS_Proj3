Steinberger accepted a faculty position at Columbia in 1950. The newly commissioned [[meson]] beam at [[Nevis Labs]] provided the tool for several important experiments. Measurements of the production cross section of pions on various nuclear targets showed that the pion has odd parity.<ref> {{cite journal |author=C. Chedester, P. Isaacs, A. Sachs and J.

The same target was used to observe the relative rare decay of neutral pions to a photon, an electron and a [[positron]]. A related experiment measured the mass difference between the charged and neutral pions based on the angular correlation between the neutral pions produced when the negative pion is captured by the proton in the hydrogen nucleus.<ref> {{cite journal |author=W.

An important characteristic of the [[weak interaction]] is its violation of [[parity symmetry]]. This characteristic was established through the measurement of the spins and parities of many [[hyperons]]. Steinberger and his collaborators contributed several such measurements using large (75 cm) liquid-hydrogen bubble chambers and separated hadron beams at Brookhaven. One example is the measurement of the invariant mass distribution of electron-positron pairs produced in the decay of [[Sigma baryon|Sigma-zero hyperons]] to [[Lambda baryon|Lambda-zero hyperons]].<ref> {{Cite journal |author=C.

Steinberger and [[Melvin Schwartz|Schwartz]] built large spark chambers at [[Nevis Lab]] and exposed them in 1961 to neutrinos produced in association with muons in the decays of charged pions and kaons. They used the [[Alternating Gradient Synchrotron]] (AGS) at Brookhaven, and obtained a number of convincing events in which muons were produced, but no electrons.<ref name="slac.stanford.edu"> {{cite journal |author=G.

Steinberger recognized that the phenomenological parameter epsilon (''ε'') which quantifies the degree of CP violation could be measured in interference phenomena (See CP violation). In collaboration with [[Carlo Rubbia]], he performed an experiment while on sabbatical at [[CERN]] during 1965 which demonstrated robustly the expected interference effect, and also measured precisely the difference in mass of the short-lived and long-lived neutral kaon masses.<ref> {{cite journal |author=C.

He constructed an experiment there utilizing multi-wire proportional chambers ([[MWPC]]), recently invented by [[Georges Charpak]]. The MWPC's, augmented by micro-electronic amplifiers, allowed much larger samples of events to be recorded. Several results for neutral kaons were obtained and published in the early 1970s, including the
