Rubin''' (1914- 1996) was an American [[systems engineer]] and [[inventor]], who was president of the [[Society for General Systems Research]] in 1968.<ref> [http://isss.org/bulletins/2003_GeneralSystemsBulletin_v32_no_member_list.pdf.

He received his formal education at [[Harvard University]] in communications engineering and applied mathematics, and graduated from Harvard College with a [[bachelor of science]] degree in [[electrical engineering]].<ref>"Milton D.

P.165.</ref> His daughter, Lise Diane Rubin, was born in 1950. Over the next 50 years, he worked for numerous engineering firms, where he served as manager of system engineering and consulting scientist. His career further included research into materials and components, and specialized in radar. In the 1940s he worked at the Raytheon Co. where he headed the Equipment Division. In 1954 he became consulting scientist, the highest professional level one can attain in the company.<ref>ProQuest Information and Learning Company (1954).

From the 1960s until the 1980s he worked at the [[Mitre Corporation]] in Bedford, Massachusetts. Rubin was been organizationally active in the [[Society for General Systems Research]]. For years he has been Secretary Treasurer and has been the Editor of the "General Systems Newsletter, quarterly", and in 1968 he was president of the Society for General Systems Research. In 1981 he received the IEEE-USA Award by the [[IEEE]]. <ref>[http://www.ieeeusa.org/volunteers/awards/pastrecipients/pachievement.html IEEE-USA Award], retrieved 25 April 2008.</ref> Milton D. Rubin of Newton died Saturday July 6th, 1996 at Clark House in Westwood. He was survived by his wife, Tillie Rubin, daughter, Lise Diane Rubin, grandson, Joel Benjamin, and granddaughter, Eva Weinstein. == Work == === General Systems === One of the main lines of thought in [[Systems science|General Systems]] according to Rubin in 1966 <ref name="MDR66"> Milton D. Rubin (1966), "General Systems and Systems Engineering", in: ''IEEE Transactions on Systems Science and Cybernetics'', Vol 2, Iss 1, Aug. 66 Pages:3-7.</ref> is the transfer of system concepts from one field to another. There has been fruitful application of such theoretical concepts from engineering to other fields such as biology. In his 1966 paper "General Systems and Systems Engineering" Rubin attempted "to apply concepts from biology to the practice of [[systems engineering]]. The relation of systems engineering to other fields is discussed, utilizing an intellectual framework based on the concepts of speciation and competition between species. The internal social structure of the profession and of individual organizations is considered, using the concept of competition within a species. Examples are drawn from biology to illustrate the points at issue".<ref name="MDR66"/> == Publications == Miltin has written and edited several books and articles.
