Using the metaphor of the [[sheet music|musical score]], as a form of declarative and conceptual notation of music, Rinehart likens Media Art to musical compositions that are able to maintain their original integrity while being realized by different instruments or in different arrangements, over evolving time periods; in this sense, scores are considered to be inherently variable. In Rinehart’s view, [[Media art]] (in which logical information is considered separate from physical hardware) is able to be ‘scored’ based on the information acquired from a document like the Variable Media Questionnaire to be realized by different media-equipment. Maintaining the notion of the musical score, the Media Art Notation System is derived as (and has as its underlying structure) an interpretation of computer programming languages, drawing primarily from [[Declarative programming|Digital Item Declaration Language]] ([[DIDL]]), a type of [[Extensible Markup Language]] (XML) that allows for greater, more granular descriptions of a multi-component [[Digital object identifier|digital object]]. MANS has three layers; the conceptual model of documentation, the preferred expression format (vocabulary) for the model (the interpretation of DIDL XML) and, its top layer, the score, which serves as a record of the work that is database-processable. It is hoped that by interweaving the ideas of a declarative language and a more procedural language, MANS is able to act as a backbone to the artwork by being specifically suggestive though not overly prescriptive of how to best delineate and then, later, reinterpret an artwork. == History of new media art preservation == ===Individual efforts=== Numerous contemporary art conservators have contributed individual efforts toward new media art preservation: *Carol Stringari of the Guggenheim in New York She took care of her collection with much care and effort which we now call it is beyond conservation. As a deputy director and chief conservator, she led her laser research of a monochromatic painting by Ad Reinhardt and project on conservation of the works of László Moholy-Nagy. She later won the CAA/Heritage Preservation Award for Distinction for Scholarship and Conservation for her work on Ad Reinhardt's technique.<ref>{{cite web|http://www.artdaily.com/section/news/index.asp?int_sec=11&int_new=28750&int_modo=1| title= Guggenheim's Carol Stringari Wins CAA/Heritage Preservation Award| accessdate= January 17, 2011}}</ref> *Pip Laurenson of the [[Tate Gallery]] in London Pip Laurenson, the Head of Time-based media conservation at Tate, is currently working to achieve her PhD in the care and management of time-based media works of art at University College London. *Jill Sterret of the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]]. Director of Collections & Conservation at SFMOMA, Sterret is now an avid collector and preserver of artworks made by contemporary artists. She also is committed to the vital collaborations between artists, curators, technical experts, registrars, and conservators that support contemporary art conservation practice. ===Consortium efforts=== The variable media concept was developed in 1998, first as a creative strategy Ippolito brought to the adversarial collaborations produced with artists Janet Cohen and Keith Frank, and later as a preservation strategy called the Variable Media Initiative that he applied to endangered artworks in the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]]'s collection. In 2002 the Guggenheim partnered with the [[Daniel Langlois Foundation]] for Art, Science and Technology in Montreal to form the [http://variablemedia.net Variable Media Network], a concerted effort to develop a museum-standard, best practice for the collection and preservation of [[new media art]]. Apart from Stringari and Ippolito, other key members of the Variable Media Network included [[Alain Depocas]], Director of the Centre for Research and Documentation, Daniel Langlois Foundation; and Caitlin Jones, former Daniel Langlois Variable Media Preservation Fellow at the Guggenheim Museum. Around this time similar investigations into the preservation of digital/media art were being led on the West Coast by Richard Rinehart, Digital Media Director and Adjunct Curator of Digital Art at the [[Berkeley Art Museum]]/Pacific Film Archive, who published an article on the subject, [http://switch.sjsu.edu/nextswitch/switch_engine/front/front.php?artc=233 The Straw that Broke the Museum's Back? Collecting and Preserving Digitial/Media Art for the Next Century], in 2000. Rinehart had also established Conceptual & Intermedia Arts Online (CIAO) [http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/about_bampfa/avantgarde.html] with Franklin Furnace, the New York based performance art-grants giving organization and archive/advocate of performance, 'ephemeral' or non-traditional art under the directorship of [[Martha Wilson]]. Members of the Variable Media Network and CIAO subsequently joined forces with other organizations, including [[Rhizome.org]], an affiliate of New York's [[New Museum of Contemporary Art]], for collective preservation endeavors such as Archiving the Avant Garde [http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/about_bampfa/avantgarde.html]. This broader coalition, operating under the rubric [http://forging-the-future.com Forging the Future], is managed by the [[Still Water]] lab at the University of Maine and offers free, open-source tools for new media preservation, including the 3rd-generation Variable Media Questionnaire. In 2002, Timothy Murray founded [http://goldsen.library.cornell.edu/ The Rose Goldsen Archive of New Media Art]. Named after the pioneering critic of the commercialization of mass media, the late Professor Rose Goldsen of Cornell University. The Archive hosts international art work produced on CD-Rom, DVD-Rom, video, digital interfaces, and the internet. Its collection of supporting materials includes unpublished manuscripts and designs, catalogues, monographs, and resource guides to new media art. The curatorial vision emphasizes digital interfaces and artistic experimentation by international, independent artists. Designed as an experimental center of research and creativity, the Goldsen Archive includes materials by individual artists and collaborates on conceptual experimentation and archival strategies with international curatorial and fellowship projects. Other important initiatives include [[DOCAM]], an international research alliance on the documentation and the conservation of the media arts heritage organized by the Daniel Langlois Foundation, and the International Network for the Conservation of Contemporary Art (INCCA), organized by the Netherlands Institute for Cultural Heritage
