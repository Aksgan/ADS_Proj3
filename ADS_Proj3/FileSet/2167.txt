continues the former Institute’s role as a designated professional body, under the [[Financial Services and Markets Act 2000]], which enables it to license firms that are managed or controlled by actuaries, allowing them to carry on certain limited regulated activities. An actuarial qualification from the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries consists of a combination of the completion of various examinations and courses. The examinations are split into four sections: core technical, core applications, specialist technical, and specialist applications. In addition to examinations and courses, it is required that the candidate both complete at least three years work as an actuary and to qualify as a Fellow.<ref name="Students">[http://www.actuaries.org.uk/students Actuarial Profession].</ref> ===Examinations=== An actuarial qualification from the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries consists of a combination of the completion of various examinations and courses.

These are usually sat first by a candidate and include the underlying mathematics involved in actuarial work as well as an introduction to financial and economic issues. These are also the most common exams for which candidates may get exemptions. The Core Applications section consists of a 6 hour written exam and two practical exams which focus on the application of concepts learned and a candidate's ability to communicate actuarial concepts to others. ====Specialist Examinations==== The Specialist Technical section is the first stage the candidate has a choice of which exams to take. The candidate choses two from the various actuarial specialist subjects i.e. Health and Care, Life Insurance, General Insurance, Pensions, Finance or Investments and further technical knowledge on said subjects is attained. Since the 2010 examinations, the General Insurance Specialist Technical paper ST3 was replaced by two subjects ST7 and ST8 <ref =name> How to Register as a Student a student, [http://www.actuaries.org.uk/students/pages/three-hour-exams The Actuarial Profession, Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, 2011-01-25]</ref>. The Specialist Applications section allows the candidate to choose one area for which they take the SA paper and attain full Fellowship; leading to many referring to this as the “Fellowship paper.” However, as the rules on the ordering of examinations were relaxed, this examination may be taken before taking some earlier examinations resulting in candidates qualifying on other papers. ===List of Examinations=== ====Core Technical Stage==== * CT1 - Financial Mathematics * CT2 - Finance and Financial Reporting * CT3 - Probability and Mathematical Statistics * CT4 - Models * CT5 - Contingencies * CT6 - Statistical Methods * CT7 - Business Economics * CT8 - Financial Economics * CT9 - Business Awareness Module ====Core Applications Stage==== * CA1 - Core Applications Concepts * CA2 - Modelling * CA3 - Communications ====Specialist Technical Stage==== * ST0 - Alternative Specialist Technical (not examined) * ST1 - Health and Care Specialist Technical * ST2 - Life Insurance Specialist Technical * ST3 - General Insurance Specialist Technical (no longer available) * ST4 - Pensions and other Benefits Specialist Technical * ST5 - Finance and Investment Specialist Technical A * ST6 - Finance and Investment Specialist Technical B * ST7 - General Insurance - Reserving and Capital Modelling Specialist Technical * ST8 - General Insurance - Pricing Specialist Technical * ST9 - Enterprise Risk Management Specialist Technical ====Specialist Applications Stage==== * SA0 - Research Dissertation Specialist Applications * SA1 - Health and Care Specialist Applications * SA2 - Life Insurance Specialist Applications * SA3 - General Insurance Specialist Applications * SA4 - Pensions and other Benefits Specialist Applications * SA5 - Finance Specialist Applications * SA6 - Investment Specialist Applications ====UK Practice Modules==== ''For students working in the UK only'' * P0 - Generic UK Practice Half Module * P1 - Health and Care * P2 - Life Insurance * P3 - General Insurance * P4 - Pensions * P5 - Finance * P6 - Investment ===University-based examinations=== A student may choose to complete an accredited [[actuarial science]] degree at an undergraduate or at a postgraduate level through a number of recognised universities. Successful students may offer proof of having covered the topics whilst at university and students may be granted exemptions from certain professional examinations from the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. Depending on the University, a different number of courses may be recognised for exemption. The examinations and the exemption pass level for the examinations is usually externalised by members of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. Naturally, the quality of the courses and lecturing at these universities are a determinant as to whether the course is recognised by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. Most universities offering [[actuarial science]] courses also require the student in addition to complete various other related topics, including statistics, mathematics, applied mathematics, economics and accounting for recognition of an actuarial degree. Upon completion of the university degree, students would then complete all remaining examinations through the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries to qualify as an [[actuary]] and become a Fellow of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries(FIA or FFA). ===Qualifications=== ====Certificate in Financial Mathematics==== Any candidate worldwide can take the CT1 Financial Mathematics exam without being a member of the Actuarial Profession and if they pass, will receive the Certificate in Financial Mathematics<ref =name> Certificate in financial mathematics, [http://www.actuaries.org.uk/students/pages/certificate-financial-mathematics The Actuarial Profession, Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, 2011-01-25]</ref>. ====Diploma in Actuarial
