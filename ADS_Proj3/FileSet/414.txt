1, n}(x).</math> ==Approximating continuous functions== Let ''&fnof;'' be a [[continuous function]] on the interval [0, 1]. Consider the Bernstein polynomial : <math>B_n(f)(x) = \sum_{\nu = 0}^n f\left( \frac{\nu}{n} \right) b_{\nu,n}(x).</math> It can be shown that : <math>\lim_{n \to \infty}{ B_n(f)(x) } = f(x) \,</math> [[uniform convergence|uniformly]] on the interval [0, 1]. This is a stronger statement than the proposition that the limit holds for each value of ''x'' separately; that would be [[pointwise convergence]] rather than [[uniform convergence]]. Specifically, the word ''uniformly'' signifies that : <math>\lim_{n \to \infty} \sup \left\{\, \left| f(x) - B_n(f)(x) \right| \,:\, 0 \leq x \leq 1 \,\right\} = 0.</math> Bernstein polynomials thus afford one way to prove the [[Stone&ndash;Weierstrass theorem#Weierstrass_approximation_theorem|Weierstrass approximation theorem]] that every real-valued continuous function on a real interval [''a'', ''b''] can be uniformly approximated by polynomial functions over '''R'''. A more general statement for a function with continuous k-th derivative is : <math>{\left\| B_n(f)^{(k)} \right\|}_\infty \le \frac{ (n)_k }{ n^k } \left\| f^{(k)} \right\|_\infty \text{ and } \left\| f^{(k)}- B_n(f)^{(k)} \right\|_\infty \to 0</math> where additionally : <math>\frac{ (n)_k }{ n^k } = \left( 1 - \frac{0}{n} \right) \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right) \cdots \left( 1 - \frac{k - 1}{n} \right)</math> is an [[eigenvalue]] of ''B''<sub>''n''</sub>; the corresponding eigenfunction is a polynomial of degree ''k''. ===Proof=== Suppose ''K'' is a [[random variable]] distributed as the number of successes in ''n'' independent [[Bernoulli trial]]s with probability ''x'' of success on each trial; in other words, ''K'' has a [[binomial distribution]] with parameters ''n'' and ''x''. Then we have the [[expected value]] E(''K''/''n'') = ''x''. By the [[law of large numbers|weak law of large numbers]] of [[probability theory]], : <math>\lim_{n \to \infty}{ P\left( \left| \frac{K}{n} - x \right|>\delta \right) } = 0</math> for every ''&delta;'' > 0. Moreover, this relation holds uniformly in ''x'', which can be seen from its proof via [[Chebyshev's inequality]], taking into account that the variance of ''K''/''n'', equal to ''x''(1-''x'')/''n'', is bounded from above by 1/(4''n'') irrespective of ''x''. Because ''&fnof;'', being continuous on a closed bounded interval, must be [[uniform continuity|uniformly continuous]] on that interval, one infers a statement of the form : <math>\lim_{n \to \infty}{ P\left( \left| f\left( \frac{K}{n} \right) - f\left( x \right) \right| > \varepsilon \right) } = 0</math> uniformly in ''x''. Taking into account that ''ƒ'' is bounded (on the given interval) one gets for the expectation : <math>\lim_{n \to \infty}{ E\left( \left| f\left( \frac{K}{n} \right) - f\left( x \right) \right| \right) } = 0</math> uniformly in ''x''. To this end one splits the sum for the expectation in two parts. On one part the difference does not exceed ε; this part cannot contribute more than ε. On the other part the difference exceeds ε, but does not exceed 2''M'', where ''M'' is an upper bound for |''ƒ''(x)|; this part cannot contribute more than 2''M'' times the small probability that the difference exceeds ε. Finally, one observes that the absolute value of the difference between expectations never exceeds the expectation of the absolute value of the difference, and that E(''&fnof;''(''K''/''n'')) is just the Bernstein polynomial ''B''<sub>''n''</sub>(''ƒ'', ''x'').

It describes interactions among firms (sellers) that set prices and their customers (buyers) that choose quantities at that price. The model rests on the following assumptions: * There are at least two firms producing [[wiktionary:Homogeneous|homogeneous]] (undifferentiated) products; * Firms do not cooperate; * Firms compete by setting prices simultaneously; * Consumers buy everything from a firm with a lower price. If all firms charge the same price, consumers randomly select among them. == Calculating the classic Bertrand model == *MC = Marginal cost *p<sub>1</sub> = firm 1’s price level *p<sub>2</sub> = firm 2’s price level *p<sub>M</sub> = monopoly price level * Firm 1's optimum price depends on where it believes firm 2 will set its prices. Pricing just below the other firm will obtain full market demand (D), though this is not optimal if the other firm is pricing below marginal cost as that would entail negative profits. In general terms, firm 1's [[best response]] function is p<sub>1</sub>’’(p<sub>2</sub>), this gives firm 1 optimal price for each price set by firm 2. * Diagram 1 shows firm 1’s reaction function p<sub>1</sub>’’(p<sub>2</sub>), with each firm's strategy on each axis. It shows that when P<sub>2</sub> is less than marginal cost (firm 2 pricing below MC) firm 1 prices at marginal cost, p<sub>1</sub>=MC. When firm 2 prices above MC but below monopoly prices, then firm 1 prices just below firm 2. When firm 2 prices above monopoly prices (P<sup>M</sup>) firm 1 prices at monopoly level, p<sub>1</sub>=p<sup>M</sup>. [[Image:economics_bertrand_diag1.png]] *Because firm 2 has the same marginal cost as firm 1, its reaction function is symmetrical with respect to the 45 degree line. Diagram 2 shows both reaction functions. [[Image:economics_bertrand_diag2.png]] *The result of the firms' strategies is a [[Nash equilibrium]], that is, a pair of strategies (prices in this case) where neither firm can increase profits by unilaterally changing price. This is given by the intersection of the reaction curves, Point N on the diagram. At this point p<sub>1</sub>=p<sub>1</sub>’’(p<sub>2</sub>), and p<sub>2</sub>=p<sub>2</sub>’’(p<sub>1</sub>).
