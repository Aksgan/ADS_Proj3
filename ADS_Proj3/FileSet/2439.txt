desktop machines. Chris also intended that Kororaa be used to quickly demonstrate the power of [[Gentoo Linux]] to users critical of 'compile times.' On November 7, 2007, Chris announced that he was discontinuing his work on the project, and that there would be no new versions of Kororaa. The introduction of the Kororaa XGL Live CD was intended to demonstrate the capabilities of [[Novell]]'s [[Xgl]] and [[Compiz]]. == Kororaa XGL Live CD== [[Image:Xgl cube.png|thumb|Screenshot of the Xgl abilities of the Kororaa Live CD]] In March 2006, a Kororaa based [[Live CD]] was released, preconfigured with [[Xgl]] capabilities. The live CD supports NVIDIA, ATI and Intel graphics cards, and the latest version (0.3) comes with both [[KDE]] and [[GNOME]]. == Kororaa XGL Live CD and the GPL == In May 2006 an unnamed kernel developer sent an email to Christopher Smart, Kororaa's leader, suggesting that packaging the proprietary [[NVIDIA]] and [[ATI Technologies|fglrx]] drivers was a violation of the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] as they take GPL code from the kernel and build it into a non-GPL kernel module, qualifying as a derived work. This caused Smart to temporarily remove the CD image from his website in August 2006 [http://kororaa.org/static.php?page=gpl]. Two months later, version (0.3) was released, and all proprietary drivers were removed by request. Because of this, only limited ATI and NVIDIA graphics card support was included. == Development ended == On November 7, 2007, Smart announced that development on Kororaa would be ended, and no further versions would be released;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kororaa.org/comments.php?y=07&m=11&entry=entry071107-225645|title=Kororaa Project - No more Kororaa|accessdate=9 November 2007|archivedate=9 November 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071109171217/http://kororaa.org/comments.php?y=07&m=11&entry=entry071107-225645}}</ref> reasons given were that * [[Sabayon Linux]] already serves a purpose as a binary Gentoo distribution * Gentoo already comes with a GUI installer * Compiz is already installed on most desktop distributions by default * Kororaa couldn't compete with other distributions which include non-free drivers by default. * the weight of the project was too much for a single developer. ==Version History== * Beta 2 R1, December 12, 2005 * XGL Live CD 0.1, March 8, 2006 * XGL Live CD 0.2, April 6, 2006 * XGL Live CD 0.3, October 4, 2006 ==References== <references /> == External links == * {{DistroWatch|kororaa|NAME=Kororaa}} {{Linux distributions}} [[Category:Discontinued Linux distributions]] [[Category:Gentoo Linux derivatives]] [[de:Kororaa]] [[es:Kororaa]] [[fr:Kororaa]] [[it:Kororaa]] [[pl:Kororaa]] [[ro:Kororaa]] [[zh:Kororaa]]</text> </page> <page> <id>20837</id> <title>Kraakdoos</title> <text>[[Image:Kraakdoos (Cracklebox).jpg|thumb|Kraakdoos.]] The '''Kraakdoos''' (or Cracklebox) is a [[custom-made instrument|custom made]] battery-powered [[noise music|noise]]-making [[electronic device]]. It is a small box with six metal contacts on top, which when pressed by fingers will generate all manner of unusual sounds and tones. The [[human body]] becomes a part of the circuit and determines the range of sounds possible — different people will generate different results. The concept was first conceived by [[Michel Waisvisz]] and Geert Hamelberg in the 1960s, and developed further in the 1970s when Waisvisz joined the [[STEIM]] foundation in [[Amsterdam, The Netherlands]]. The kraakdoos is a simple device, based around a single [[operational amplifier]] (one of the earliest models to be produced) and a few transistors, and can be easily constructed by someone with a basic understanding of electronics. == See also == * [[Circuit bending]] == External links == * [http://www.eam.se/kraakdoos/ DIY Kraakdoos / Crackle Box] — contains a [[schematic]] and sound examples. * [http://www.crackle.org/CrackleBox.htm The CrackleBox] — includes a history * {{Nl icon}} [http://www.logosfoundation.org/kursus/2005.html De Kraakdoos] * [http://www.steim.org/steim/index.php STEIM foundation] * [http://www.harsmedia.com/SoundBlog/Archief/00641.php#00641 Cracklebox Sinfonietta] - for 9 crackleboxes, double bass and soprinano saxophone, hommage to Michel Waisvisz * [http://freesound.iua.upf.edu/packsViewSingle.php?id=62 "Cracklebox" by tombola] — a range of sound examples from [[The Freesound Project]] [[Category:Electronic circuits]] [[Category:Custom-made instruments]] [[es:Caja de crujidos]] [[nl:Kraakdoos]]</text> </page> <page> <id>20842</id> <title>Kreislauf</title> <text>{{infobox record label | image = | founded = 2001 | founder = Andreas Buttweiler, Dirk Hartmann | country = [[Germany]] | location = [[Hamburg]] | genre = Ambient, Electro, Techno | url = http://kreislauf.org }} '''Kreislauf''' is a German [[netlabel]] and radio show focusing on quality [[electronic music|electronic]] [[dance music]] and [[ambient music]] in many flavours ([[house music|house]], [[techno music|techno]], [[breakbeat]], etc). == History == Kreislauf recommend and publish electronic music beyond commerce and drawers. The project was founded by Andreas Buttweiler and Thomas Hentrich in 1997 as an Ambient-Club in Mannheim/Germany. In the year 2000 they started their weekly radio-show "Kreislauf. FM" at the free radio-stadion Bermudafunk in Mannheim and Heidelberg, and since 2004 also at Tide 96.0 in Hamburg. The Label-Section was founded in 2001 by Dirk Hartmann (label-owner of Hörzu!) and Andreas Buttweiler, and become a netlabel in 2006.
