theories, such as [[system F]] is an example of the usefulness of categorical semantics. * [[Internal language]]s. This can be seen as a formalization and generalization of proof by [[diagram chasing]]. One defines a suitable internal language naming relevant constituents of a category, and then applies categorical semantics to turn assertions in a logic over the internal language into corresponding categorical statements. This has been most successful in the theory of [[topos]]es, where the internal language of a topos together with the semantics of intuitionistic higher-order logic in a topos enables one to reason about the objects and morphisms of a topos "as if they were sets and functions". This has been successful in dealing with toposes that have "sets" with properties incompatible with classical logic. A prime example is [[Dana Scott]]'s model of [[untyped lambda calculus]] in terms of objects that retract onto their own function space. Another is the Moggi-Hyland model of [[system F]] by an internal [[full subcategory]] of the [[effective topos]] of [[Martin Hyland]]. * [[Term-model construction]]s. In many cases, the categorical semantics of a logic provide a basis for establishing a correspondence between [[Theory_(mathematical_logic)|theories]] in the logic and instances of an appropriate kind of category. A classic example is the correspondence between theories of [[beta reduction|βη]]-[[equational logic]] over [[simply typed lambda calculus]] and [[cartesian closed categories]]. Categories arising from theories via term-model constructions can usually be characterized up to [[Equivalence_of_categories|equivalence]] by a suitable [[universal property]]. This has enabled proofs of [[Metalogic|meta-theoretical]] properties of some logics by means of an appropriate [[:Category:monoidal categories|categorical algebra]]<!--no good article-->. For instance, [[Peter J. Freyd|Freyd]] gave a proof of the existence and disjunction properties of [[intuitionistic logic]] this way. == Historical perspective == Categorical logic originated with [[William Lawvere|Bill Lawvere]]'s ''Functorial Semantics of Algebraic Theories'' (1963), and ''Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets'' (1964). Lawvere recognised the [[Grothendieck topos]], introduced in algebraic topology as a generalised space, as a generalisation of the category of sets (''Quantifiers and Sheaves'' (1970)). With Myles Tierney, Lawvere then developed the notion of [[elementary topos]], thus establishing the fruitful field of [[topos theory]], which provides a unified categorical treatment of the syntax and semantics of higher-order predicate logic. The resulting logic is formally intuitionistic. Andre Joyal is credited, in the term Kripke–Joyal semantics, with the observation that the sheaf models for predicate logic, provided by topos theory, generalise [[Kripke semantics]]. Joyal and others applied these models to study higher-order concepts such as the [[real number]]s in the intuitionistic setting. An analogous development was the link between the [[simply typed lambda calculus]] and [[cartesian closed category|cartesian-closed categories]] (Lawvere, Lambek, Scott), which provided a setting for the development of [[domain theory]]. Less expressive theories, from the mathematical logic viewpoint, have their own category theory counterparts. For example the concept of an [[algebraic theory]] leads to [[Gabriel–Ulmer duality]]. The view of categories as a generalisation unifying syntax and semantics has been productive in the study of logics and type theories for applications in computer science. The founders of elementary topos theory were [[Lawvere]] and Tierney. Lawvere's writings, sometimes couched in a philosophical jargon, isolated some of the basic concepts as [[adjoint functors]] (which he explained as 'objective' in a [[Hegelian]] sense, not without some justification). A [[subobject classifier]] is a strong property to ask of a category, since with cartesian closure and finite [[Limit (category theory)|limit]]s it gives a topos ([[axiom bashing]] shows how strong the assumption is). Lawvere's further work in the 1960s gave a theory of attributes, which in a sense is a [[subobject]] theory more in sympathy with type theory. Major influences subsequently have been [[intuitionistic type theory|Martin-Löf type theory]] from the direction of logic, [[type polymorphism]] and the [[calculus of constructions]] from functional programming, [[linear logic]] from [[proof theory]], [[game semantics]] and the projected [[synthetic domain theory]]. The abstract categorical idea of [[fibred category|fibration]] has been much applied. To go back historically, the major irony here is that in large-scale terms, [[intuitionistic logic]] had reappeared in mathematics, in a central place in the [[Bourbaki]]–[[Grothendieck]] program, a generation after the messy [[Hilbert]]–[[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|Brouwer]] controversy had ended, with Hilbert the apparent winner. Bourbaki, or more accurately [[Jean Dieudonné]], having laid claim to the legacy of Hilbert and the [[Göttingen school]] including [[Emmy Noether]], had revived intuitionistic logic's credibility (although Dieudonné himself found Intuitionistic Logic ludicrous), as the logic of an arbitrary topos, where classical logic was that of 'the' topos of sets. This was one consequence, certainly unanticipated, of [[Grothendieck's relative point of view]]; and not lost on [[Pierre Cartier (mathematician)|Pierre Cartier]], one of the broadest of the core group of French mathematicians around Bourbaki and [[IHES]]. Cartier was to give a [[Séminaire Bourbaki]] exposition of intuitionistic logic. In an even broader perspective, one might take category theory to be to the mathematics of the second half of the twentieth century, what [[measure theory]] was to the first half. It was [[Kolmogorov]] who applied measure theory to [[probability theory]], the first convincing (if not the only) axiomatic approach. Kolmogorov was also a pioneer writer in the early 1920s on the formulation of intuitionistic logic, in a style entirely supported by the later categorical logic approach (again, one of the formulations, not the only one; the [[realizability]] concept of [[Stephen Kleene]] is also a serious contender here). Another route to categorical logic would therefore have been through Kolmogorov, and this is one way to explain the protean [[Curry–Howard|Curry–Howard isomorphism]]. ==See also== * [[Background and genesis of topos theory]] ==References== '''Books and handbook chapters''' * Andrew M.
