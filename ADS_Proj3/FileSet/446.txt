to infer real [[copy number variation|copy number]] changes. Another type of data that requires novel informatics development is the analysis of [[lesion]]s found to be recurrent among many tumors <!-- this is specific enough, compared to general knowledge in previous paragraph, that it would be nice to have a source or example --> . ===Comparative genomics=== {{main|Comparative genomics}} The core of comparative genome analysis is the establishment of the correspondence between [[genes]] ([[orthology]] analysis) or other genomic features in different organisms. It is these intergenomic maps that make it possible to trace the evolutionary processes responsible for the divergence of two genomes. A multitude of evolutionary events acting at various organizational levels shape genome evolution. At the lowest level, point mutations affect individual nucleotides. At a higher level, large chromosomal segments undergo duplication, lateral transfer, inversion, transposition, deletion and insertion. Ultimately, whole genomes are involved in processes of hybridization, polyploidization and [[endosymbiosis]], often leading to rapid speciation. The complexity of genome evolution poses many exciting challenges to developers of mathematical models and algorithms, who have recourse to a spectra of algorithmic, statistical and mathematical techniques, ranging from exact, [[heuristics]], fixed parameter and [[approximation algorithms]] for problems based on parsimony models to [[Markov Chain Monte Carlo]] algorithms for [[Bayesian analysis]] of problems based on probabilistic models. Many of these studies are based on the homology detection and protein families computation. ===Modeling biological systems=== {{main|Computational systems biology}} Systems biology involves the use of [[computer simulation]]s of [[cell (biology)|cellular]] subsystems (such as the [[metabolic network|networks of metabolites]] and [[enzyme]]s which comprise [[metabolism]], [[signal transduction]] pathways and [[gene regulatory network]]s) to both analyze and visualize the complex connections of these cellular processes. [[Artificial life]] or virtual evolution attempts to understand evolutionary processes via the computer simulation of simple (artificial) life forms. ===High-throughput image analysis=== Computational technologies are used to accelerate or fully automate the processing, quantification and analysis of large amounts of high-information-content [[biomedical imagery]]. Modern image analysis systems augment an observer's ability to make measurements from a large or complex set of images, by improving [[accuracy]], [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]], or speed. A fully developed analysis system may completely replace the observer. Although these systems are not unique to biomedical imagery, biomedical imaging is becoming more important for both [[diagnostics]] and research. Some examples are: * high-throughput and high-fidelity quantification and sub-cellular localization ([[high-content screening]], cytohistopathology, [[Bioimage informatics]]) * [[morphometrics]] * clinical image analysis and visualization * determining the real-time air-flow patterns in breathing lungs of living animals * quantifying occlusion size in real-time imagery from the development of and recovery during arterial injury * making behavioral observations from extended video recordings of laboratory animals * infrared measurements for metabolic activity determination * inferring clone overlaps in [[Gene mapping|DNA mapping]], e.g. the [[Sulston score]] ===Structural Bioinformatic Approaches=== ====Prediction of protein structure==== {{main|Protein structure prediction}} Protein structure prediction is another important application of bioinformatics. The [[amino acid]] sequence of a protein, the so-called [[primary structure]], can be easily determined from the sequence on the gene that codes for it. In the vast majority of cases, this primary structure uniquely determines a structure in its native environment. (Of course, there are exceptions, such as the [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] - aka [[Mad Cow Disease]] - [[prion]].) Knowledge of this structure is vital in understanding the function of the protein. For lack of better terms, structural information is usually classified as one of ''[[secondary structure|secondary]]'', ''[[tertiary structure|tertiary]]'' and ''[[quaternary structure|quaternary]]'' structure. A viable general solution to such predictions remains an open problem. As of now, most efforts have been directed towards heuristics that work most of the time. One of the key ideas in bioinformatics is the notion of [[homology (biology)|homology]]. In the genomic branch of bioinformatics, homology is used to predict the function of a gene: if the sequence of gene ''A'', whose function is known, is homologous to the sequence of gene ''B,'' whose function is unknown, one could infer that B may share A's function. In the structural branch of bioinformatics, homology is used to determine which parts of a protein are important in structure formation and interaction with other proteins. In a technique called homology modeling, this information is used to predict the structure of a protein once the structure of a homologous protein is known. This currently remains the only way to predict protein structures reliably. One example of this is the similar protein homology between hemoglobin in humans and the hemoglobin in legumes ([[leghemoglobin]]). Both serve the same purpose of transporting oxygen in the organism. Though both of these proteins have completely different amino acid sequences, their protein structures are virtually identical, which reflects their near identical purposes. Other techniques for predicting protein structure include protein threading and ''de novo'' (from scratch) physics-based modeling. ''See also:'' [[structural motif]] and [[structural domain]]. ====Molecular Interaction==== Efficient software is available today for studying interactions among proteins, ligands and peptides. Types of interactions most often encountered in the field include - Protein-ligand (including drug), protein-protein and protein-peptide. Molecular dynamic simulation of movement of atoms about rotatable bonds is the fundamental principle behind computational algorithms, termed '''docking algorithms''' for studying molecular interactions. ''See also:'' [[protein-protein interaction prediction]]. =====Docking algorithms===== {{main|Protein-protein docking}} In the last two decades, tens of thousands of protein three-dimensional structures have been determined by [[X-ray crystallography]] and [[Protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] (protein NMR). One central question for the biological scientist is whether it is practical to predict possible protein-protein interactions only based on these 3D shapes, without doing [[protein-protein interaction]] experiments. A variety of methods have been developed to tackle the [[Protein-protein docking]] problem, though it seems that there is still much work to be done in this field. ==Software and tools== Software tools for bioinformatics range from simple command-line tools, to more complex graphical programs and standalone web-services available from various [[List of bioinformatics companies|bioinformatics companies]] or public institutions. ===Web services in bioinformatics=== [[SOAP]] and [[REST]]-based interfaces have been developed for a wide variety of bioinformatics applications allowing an application running on one
