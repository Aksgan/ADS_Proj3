used anatomically and physiologically to produce functions such as [[reflex]]es, [[sensory integration]], [[motor coordination]], [[circadian rhythm]]s, [[emotion|emotional responses]], [[learning]], and [[memory]]. In other words, they address how these neural circuits function and the mechanisms through which behaviors are generated. For example, systems level analysis addresses questions concerning specific sensory and motor modalities: how does [[Visual perception|vision]] work? How do [[songbirds]] learn new songs and [[bat]]s localize with [[ultrasound]]? How does the [[somatosensory system]] process tactile information? The related fields of [[neuroethology]] and [[neuropsychology]] address the question of how neural substrates underlie specific [[Ethology|animal]] and [[human behavior|human]] behaviors. [[Neuroendocrinology]] and [[psychoneuroimmunology]] examine interactions between the nervous system and the [[endocrinology|endocrine]] and [[immunology|immune]] systems, respectively. At the cognitive level, [[cognitive neuroscience]] addresses the questions of how [[mental process|psychological functions]] are produced by neural circuitry. The emergence of powerful new measurement techniques such as [[neuroimaging]] (e.g., [[fMRI]], [[Positron emission tomography|PET]], [[SPECT]]), [[electrophysiology]], and [[Human genome|human genetic analysis]] combined with sophisticated [[experimental techniques]] from [[cognitive psychology]] allows [[neuroscientist]]s and [[psychologist]]s to address abstract questions such as how human cognition and emotion are mapped to specific neural substrates. Neuroscience is also allied with the [[social sciences|social]] and [[behavioral sciences|behavioral]] sciences as well as nascent interdisciplinary fields such as [[neuroeconomics]], [[decision theory]], and [[social neuroscience]] to address complex questions about interactions of the brain with its environment. ==Neuroscience and medicine== [[Image:Structural.gif|right|thumb|250px|Parasagittal [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] of the head of a patient with benign familial [[macrocephaly]]]] [[Neurology]], [[psychiatry]], [[neurosurgery]], [[psychosurgery]], and [[neuropathology]] are medical specialties that specifically address the diseases of the nervous system. These terms also refer to clinical disciplines involving diagnosis and treatment of these diseases. Neurology works with diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems, such as [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) and [[stroke]], and their medical treatment while psychiatry focuses on [[Affect (psychology)|affective]], [[behavior]]al, [[cognition|cognitive]], and [[perception|perceptual]] disorders. Neuropathology focuses upon the classification and underlying pathogenic mechanisms of central and peripheral nervous system and muscle diseases, with an emphasis on morphologic, microscopic, and chemically observable alterations. Neurosurgery and psychosurgery work primarily with surgical treatment of diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems. The boundaries between these specialties have been blurring recently as they are all influenced by [[Research|basic research]] in neuroscience. Brain imaging also enables objective, biological insights into mental illness, which can lead to faster diagnosis, more accurate prognosis, and help assess patient progress over time.<ref>{{cite web|author=Lepage M|year=2010|title=Research at the Brain Imaging Centre|work=Douglas Mental Health University Institute|url=http://www.douglas.qc.ca/page/imagerie-cerebrale?locale=en}}</ref> [[Integrative neuroscience]] makes connections across these specialized areas of focus. ==Major branches== Modern neuroscience education and research activities can be very roughly categorized into the following major branches, based on the subject and scale of the system in examination as well as distinct experimental or curricular approaches. Individual neuroscientists, however, often work on questions that span several distinct subfields. {| class="wikitable" !Branch || Description |- | [[Behavioral neuroscience]] | Behavioral neuroscience (also known as biological psychology, biopsychology, or psychobiology) is the application of the principles of biology (viz., neurobiology) to the study of genetic, physiological, and developmental mechanisms of behavior in humans and non-human animals. |- | [[Cellular neuroscience]] | Cellular neuroscience is the study of neurons at a cellular level including morphology and physiological properties. |- | [[Cognitive neuroscience]] | Cognitive neuroscience is the study of biological substrates underlying cognition with a specific focus on the neural substrates of mental processes. |- | [[Computational neuroscience]] | Computational neuroscience is the study of brain function in terms of the information processing properties of the structures that make up the nervous system. |- | [[Developmental neuroscience]] | Developmental neuroscience studies the processes that generate, shape, and reshape the nervous system and seeks to describe the cellular basis of neural development to address underlying mechanisms. |- | [[Molecular neuroscience]] | Molecular Neuroscience is a branch of neuroscience that examines the biology of the nervous system with molecular biology, molecular genetics, protein chemistry, and related methodologies. |- | [[Neural engineering|Neuroengineering]] | Neuroengineering is a discipline within biomedical engineering that uses engineering techniques to understand, repair, replace, or enhance neural systems. |- | [[Neuroimaging]] | Neuroimaging includes the use of various techniques to either directly or indirectly image the structure and function of the brain. |- | [[Neuroinformatics]] | Neuroinformatics is a discipline within bioinformatics that conducts the organization of neuroscience data and application of computational models and analytical tools. |- | [[Neurolinguistics]] | Neurolinguistics is the study of the neural mechanisms in the human brain that control the comprehension, production, and acquisition of language. |- | [[Neurology]] and [[Psychiatry]] | Neurology is the medical specialty that works with disorders of the nervous system. Psychiatry is the medical specialty that works with the disorders of the mind&mdash;which include various affective, behavioral, cognitive, and perceptual disorders. |- | [[Systems neuroscience]] | Systems neuroscience is the study the function of neural circuits and systems. |} In 1990s, neuroscientist [[Jaak Panksepp]] coined the term "affective neuroscience" to emphasize that research of emotion should be a branch of the neurosciences, distinguishable from the nearby fields of cognitive neuroscience or behavioral neuroscience.<ref>{{cite book|author=Panksepp J|chapter=A role for "affective neuroscience" in understanding stress: the case of separation distress circuitry|editor=Puglisi-Allegra S, Oliverio A|isbn=0792306821|location=Dordrecht, Netherlands|pages=41&ndash;58|publisher=Kluwer Academic|title=Psychobiology of Stress|year=1990}}</ref> More recently, the social aspect of the emotional brain has been integrated in what is called "social-affective neuroscience" or simply social neuroscience. ==Future directions== {{Main|Unsolved problems in neuroscience}} At this time in neuroscience research, several major questions remained unsolved, especially in [[cognitive neuroscience]]. For example, neuroscientists have yet to fully explain the neural basis of [[neural correlates of consciousness|consciousness]], learning, memory, perception, sensation, and sleep. Several questions regarding the development and evolution of the brain remain unsolved.{{Which?|date=November 2010}} Researchers have also yet to fully delineate the neural bases of mental disorders such as addiction, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and psychotic disorders (e.g., schizophrenia). Neuroscientific research on [[Neuroscience of free will|free will]] is also in the early stages of understanding.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Free Will as an Open Scientific Problem|author=Balaguer M|year=2009|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262013543|location=Cambridge, MA}}</ref> Thus, neuroscientists are continuously collaborating with other scientists and researchers to
