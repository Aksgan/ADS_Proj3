to return to a given position among the [[star]]s ({{lang-la|sidus}}): 27.321661 days (27 d 7 h 43 min 11.5 s). This type of month has been observed among cultures in the Middle East, India, and China in the following way: they divided the sky into 27 or 28 [[lunar mansion]]s, one for each day of the month, identified by the prominent star(s) in them. === Tropical month === It is customary to specify positions of celestial bodies with respect to the vernal [[equinox]]. Because of [[precession]], this point moves back slowly along the [[ecliptic]]. Therefore it takes the Moon less time to return to an ecliptic longitude of zero than to the same point amidst the fixed stars: 27.321582 days (27 d 7 h 43 min 4.7 s). This slightly shorter period is known as ''tropical'' month; cf. the analogous [[tropical year]] of the [[Sun]]. === Anomalistic month === The [[Orbit of the Moon|Moon's orbit]] approximates an ellipse rather than a circle. However, the orientation (as well as the shape) of this orbit is not fixed. In particular, the position of the extreme points (the line of the [[Apsis|apsides]]: [[perigee]] and [[apogee]]), makes a full circle ([[lunar precession]]) in about nine years. It takes the Moon longer to return to the same apsis because it moved ahead during one revolution. This longer period is called the ''anomalistic'' month, and has an average length of 27.554551 days (27 d 13 h 18 min 33.2 s). The apparent diameter of the Moon varies with this period, and therefore this type has some relevance for the prediction of [[eclipse]]s (see [[Saros]]), whose extent, duration, and appearance (whether total or annular) depend on the exact apparent diameter of the Moon. The apparent diameter of the [[full moon]] varies with the [[full moon cycle]] which is the beat period of the synodic and anomalistic month, and also the period after which the apsides point to the Sun again. === Draconic month === Sometimes written 'draconitic' month<ref name="linton">{{cite book | last = Linton | first = Christopher M. | title = From Eudoxus to Einstein: a history of mathematical astronomy | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2004 | page = 7 | quote = In medieval times, the part of the Moon's orbit south of the ecliptic was known as the 'dragon' (which devoured the Moon during eclipses) and from this we get the terminology 'dragon's head' for the ascending node and 'dragon's tail' for the descending node. … The periods between successive nodes has, over time, been termed the dracontic, draconic and draconitic month, the words deriving from the Greek for 'dragon'. }}</ref>, and also called the nodical month. The orbit of the moon lies in a plane that is tilted with respect to the plane of the ecliptic: it has an [[inclination]] of about five degrees. The line of intersection of these planes defines two points on the celestial sphere: the [[ascending node]], when the moon's path crosses the ecliptic as the moon moves into the northern hemisphere, and [[descending node]] when the moon's path crosses the ecliptic as the moon moves into the southern hemisphere. The draconic or nodical month is the average interval between two successive transits of the moon through its ascending node. Because of the sun's gravitational pull on the moon, the moon's orbit gradually rotates westward on its axis, which means the nodes gradually rotate around the earth. As a result, the time it takes the moon to return to the same node is shorter than a sidereal month. It lasts 27.212220 days (27 d 5 h 5 min 35.8 s). The plane of the moon's orbit [[precession|precesses]] over a full circle in about 18.6 years. Because the moon's orbit is inclined with respect to the ecliptic, the sun, moon, and earth are in line only when the moon is at one of the nodes. Whenever this happens a solar or lunar [[eclipse]] is possible. The name "draconic" refers to a mythical dragon, said to live in the nodes and eat the sun or moon during an eclipse<ref name="linton" />. === Synodic month === This is the average period of the Moon's revolution with respect to the Sun. The synodic month is responsible for the Moon's [[lunar phase|phases]], because the Moon's appearance depends on the position of the Moon with respect to the Sun as seen from the Earth. While the moon is orbiting the Earth, the Earth is progressing in its orbit around the Sun. This means that after completing a sidereal month the Moon must move a little farther to reach the new position of the Earth with respect to the Sun. This longer period is called the ''synodic'' month ({{lang-el|σὺν ὁδῴ}}, ''sun hodō'', meaning "with the way [of the Sun]"). Because of perturbations in the orbits of the Earth and Moon, the actual time between [[lunation]]s may range from about 29.27 to about 29.83 days. The long-term average duration is 29.530589 days (29 d 12 h 44 min 2.9 s). The synodic month is used in the [[Metonic cycle]]. === Month lengths === Here is a list of the average length of the various astronomical lunar months.<ref>Derived from ELP2000-85: M.
