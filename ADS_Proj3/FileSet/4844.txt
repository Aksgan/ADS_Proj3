Airlines on 17 December 2005, after a virus originating from Winny affected the computer of a co-pilot. Arguably the biggest Winny-related leak however, is that of the Okayama Prefectural Police Force, whose computer leaked data on around 1,500 investigations. This information included sensitive data, such as the names of sex crime victims, and is the largest amount of information held by Japanese police to have ever leaked online. ==See also== *[[Anonymous P2P]] *[[Perfect Dark (P2P)|Perfect Dark]] *[[Share (P2P)|Share]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==Further reading== * {{Cite book|author=Kaneko Isamu|year=2005|title=The Technology of Winny(Winnyの技術 in Japanese)|pages=201|publisher=ASCII|isbn=4-7561-4548-5}} (Japanese) ==External links== {{External links|date=August 2010}} *{{ja icon}} [http://winny.cool.ne.jp/ Winny Cool] *has adult ads *{{ja icon}} [http://winny.info/ The Winny unofficial information] *{{en icon}} [http://winnyenglish.blogspot.com/ Winny in English] *{{ko icon}} [http://winnykorea.com/ WinnyKorea.com] *{{ko icon}} [http://winnyshare.com/ WinnyShare Community] *{{ko icon}} [http://club.nate.com/jsps/club/club_main.jsp?p_club_id=winny Nate Winny Club] *{{ja icon}} [http://internet.watch.impress.co.jp/static/column/jiken/2004/01/07/ Kyoto Pref.

Integral parts of Winqual are [[Windows Error Reporting]] (WER) and the ''Application Recovery'' API. Windows Error Reporting gives Winqual access to [[end-user]] crash and hang data of applications that fail in Windows platforms, from end-users who agree to report it. Microsoft requires that interested vendors obtain a [[VeriSign]] Class 3 Digital ID. This Digital ID is a special kind of Digital Certificate used by organizations to digitally sign code (a form of unique identification, also known as a code signing SSL certificate). <ref>[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/isv/bb190483.aspx Introducing Windows Error Reporting]</ref><ref>[http://www.idevelopsoftware.com/2008/03/winqual-registration-head-aches/ WinQual Registration Head Aches]</ref><ref>[http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=1032285 Microsoft Support Forum: WER with Thawte authenticode signed app]</ref><ref>[http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/08/10/449865.aspx The Old New Thing: How can a company get access to Windows Error Reporting data?]</ref><ref>[http://successfulsoftware.net/2008/02/27/the-great-digital-certificate-ripoff/ The great digital certificate ripoff?]</ref> Software and hardware manufacturers can link error signatures to Windows Error Reporting Responses.
