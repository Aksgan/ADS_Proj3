It is capable of performing, automatically and symbolically, such common procedures as simplification, substitution, differentiation, polynomial factorization, indefinite integration, direct and inverse Laplace transforms, the solution of linear differential equations with constant coefficients, the solution of simultaneous linear equations, and the inversion of matrices. It also supplies fairly elaborate bookkeeping facilities appropriate to its on-line operation. </blockquote> == Print publications == <div class="references-small"> * {{cite book | author = Engelman, Carl | title = MATHLAB: A Program for On-Line Assistance in Symbolic Computations | series = Proc. 1965 FJCC | publisher = Spartan Books, Washington, D.C | year = 1965 }} * {{cite book | author = Engelman, Carl | chapter = MATHLAB 68 | editor = A.J.H.

Used in the [[Pascal MicroEngine]], the original [[AlphaMicro]] system, and the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-11#The_LSI-11|LSI-11]] microcomputer, a cost-reduced and compact implementation of the DEC [[PDP-11]]. There were three types of chips in the chip-set: * CP1611 RALU - Register [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]] chip * CP1621 CON - Control chip * CP1631 MICROM - Mask-programmed [[microcode]] [[Read-only memory|ROM]] chip (512 &ndash; 22 bit words) The chips used a 3.3[[MHz]] [[clock signal#4-phase clock|four phase clock]] and four power supply voltages (+5V, +12V, -12V, and -5V). Internally the MCP-1600 was a (relatively fast) 8-bit processor that could be micro-programmed to emulate a 16-bit CPU. Up to four MICROMs were supported, but usually two or three could hold the needed microprogram for a processor. ==External links== * http://www.antiquetech.com/chips/CP1600.htm [[Category:Microprocessors]] [[ru:MCP-1600]]</text> </page> <page> <id>22884</id> <title>MCSim</title> <text>{{Infobox_Software | name = MCSim | logo = [[Image:mcsimlogo.png|100px]] | developer = [[GNU Project]] | latest_release_version = 5.4.0 | latest_release_date = {{release date|2011|01|18}} | programming language = [[C (programming language)|C]] | operating_system = [[Cross-platform]] | genre = [[Numerical Analysis]] | license = [[GNU General Public License]] | website = http://www.gnu.org/software/mcsim }} '''GNU MCSim''' is a suite of simulation software. It allows one to design one's own statistical or simulation models, perform [[Monte Carlo method| Monte Carlo]] simulations, and [[Bayesian inference]] through [[Markov chain]] models. ==Description== GNU MCSim is a simulation and statistical inference tool for algebraic or [[differential equation]] systems, optimized for performing Monte Carlo analysis. The software is intended to enable the user to perform easy to maintain environment. It comprises a model generator and a simulation engine: * The model generator facilitates structural model definition and maintenance, while keeping execution time short. The model is coded using a simple grammar, and the generator translates it into C code. Starting with version 5.3.0, models coded in [[SBML]] can also be used. * The simulation engine is a set of routines that are linked to the model in order to produce executable code. The result is that one can run simulations of the structural model under a variety of conditions. Internally, the software uses the [[GNU Scientific Library]] for its numerical calculations. ==History== The project began in 1991 in Berkeley when Don Maszle and Frederic Bois translated in C and reorganized a program that Bois had developed at Harvard for his PhD thesis. The primary motivation for the work was to be able to quickly develop and easily maintain [[PBPK]] models. However, the syntax was defined with enough generality that many algebraic and first-order ordinary [[differential equations]] can be solved. The capability to perform efficient [[Monte Carlo simulations]] was added early on, for the research needs of the group. The code was made freely available from a server at UC Berkeley. Discussions with Stuart Beal at [[University of California, San Francisco|UCSF]] School of Pharmacy, led the team to investigate the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques for PBPK models' [[Calibration (statistics)|calibration]]. The corresponding code was developed by Maszle, during a project in collaboration with [[Andrew Gelman]], then professor at [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] Statistics Department. Additional code written by Ken Revzan allowed the definition and Bayesian calibration of hierarchical (multilevel) statistical models. At the time of these developments (around 1996) those capabilities were unique for a freely distributed, easily accessible, efficient and quite versatile software. ===Released versions=== * 5.4.0 (18 January 2011) * 5.3.1 (03 March 2009) * 5.3.0 (12 January 2009) * 5.2 beta (29 January 2008) * 5.1beta (18 September 2006) * 5.0.0 (04 January 2005) * 4.2.0 (15 October 2001) * 4.1.0 (01 August 1997) * 4.0.0 (24 March 1997) * 3.6.0 * 3.3.2 ==Licensing== GNU MCSim is free software; you can
