[[Ericsson]] released Erlang as [[open source]] to ensure its independence from a single vendor and to increase awareness of the language. It contains: * an Erlang [[Interpreter (computing) | interpreter]]; * an Erlang [[compiler]]; * a protocol for communication between servers (nodes); * a [[Corba]] [[Object Request Broker]]; * a distributed database server ([[Mnesia]]) and * lots of libraries. Since it was released as open source in 1998, Erlang has been used by several companies worldwide, including [[Nortel Networks|Nortel]] and [[T-Mobile]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Who uses Erlang for product development?|work=Frequently asked questions about Erlang|url=http://www.erlang.org/faq/faq.html#AEN50|accessdate=2007-07-16|quote=''The largest user of Erlang is (surprise!) Ericsson. Ericsson use it to write software used in telecommunications systems. Many (dozens) projects have used it, a particularly large one is the extremely scalable AXD301 ATM switch.'' Other commercial users listed as part of the FAQ include: Nortel, Deutsche Flugsicherung (the German national [[air traffic control]] organisation), and T-Mobile.}}</ref>. Although Erlang was designed to fill a niche and has remained an obscure language for most of its existence, its popularity is growing due to demand for concurrent services<ref>{{cite web|title=Programming Erlang|url=http://www.ddj.com/linux-open-source/201001928?cid=RSSfeed_DDJ_OpenSource|accessdate=2008-12-13|quote=Virtually all language use shared state concurrency.

It will be easy for them to add language features to be like Erlang. It will take a long time for them to build such a high-quality VM and the mature libraries for concurrency and reliability. So, Erlang is poised for success. If you want to build a multicore application in the next few years, you should look at Erlang.}}</ref>. Projects using Erlang include [[ejabberd]] - an [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]] instant messaging server, [[Wings 3D]] - a 3D modeller, the [[Yaws (web server)|Yaws]] web server, Yahoo!

It is an [[XML]]-based (more precisely [[Extensible Application Markup Language|XAML]]-based) specification, based on a new print path and a [[color management|color-managed]] [[vector graphics|vector-based]] document format that supports [[Device Independence|device independence]] and [[resolution independence]]. OpenXPS was standardized as an [[open standard]] document format on June 16, 2009.<ref name="notes2self">{{Cite web | url=http://notes2self.net/archive/2009/06/17/openxps-openxml-paper-specification.aspx | title=OpenXPS - OpenXML Paper Specification | author=Steve McGibbon (Microsoft) | date=2009-06-17}}</ref> ==Development of the XML Paper Specification== In 2003 [[Global Graphics]] was chosen by [[Microsoft]] to provide consultancy and proof of concept development services on XPS and worked with the Windows development teams on the specification and reference architecture for the new format.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/technology/665662/global_graphics_xps_reference_rip_available_from_microsoft/index.html |title=Global Graphics XPS reference |publisher=Redorbit.com |date=2006-09-21 |accessdate=2009-12-10}}</ref> The XPS document format consists of structured XML markup that defines the layout of a document and the visual appearance of each page, along with rendering rules for distributing, archiving, rendering, processing and printing the documents. Notably, the markup language for XPS is a subset of [[XAML]], allowing it to incorporate [[vector graphics|vector-graphic]] elements in documents, using [[Extensible Application Markup Language|XAML]] to mark up the WPF primitives. The elements used are described in terms of paths and other geometrical primitives. An XPS file is in fact a [[Unicode | Unicoded]] [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] archive using the [[Open Packaging Conventions]], containing the files which make up the document. These include an XML markup file for each page, text, [[Odttf|embedded fonts]], raster images, 2D [[vector graphics]], as well as the [[digital rights management]] information. The contents of an XPS file can be examined simply by opening it in an application which supports ZIP files. ==Features== XPS specifies a set of document layout functionality for paged, printable documents. It also has support for features such as [[color gradient]]s, [[transparency (graphic)|transparencies]], [[CMYK]] [[color space]]s, [[Color calibration|printer calibration]], multiple-ink systems and print [[XML schema|schemas]]. XPS supports the [[Windows Color System]] [[color management]] technology for color conversion precision across devices and higher dynamic range. It also includes a software [[Raster image processor|raster image processor (RIP)]] which is downloadable separately.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/print/RRIP.mspx |title=Reference Raster Image Processor (RIP) |publisher=Microsoft.com |date=2007-01-09 |accessdate=2009-12-10}}</ref> The print subsystem also has support for [[Indexed color|named colors]], simplifying color definition for images transmitted to printers supporting those colors. XPS also supports [[HD Photo]] images natively
