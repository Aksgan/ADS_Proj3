Apple ran the first advertisement for the Apple II in the July 1977 edition of ''[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]]'' — a two page spread ad titled "Introducing the Apple II" and followed by a third page that was an order form. The first brochure, was entitled "Simplicity" and the copy in both the ad and brochure pioneered "demystifying" language intended to make the new idea of a home computer more "personal." The Apple II introduction ad was later run in the September 1977 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]''.<ref>[http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.pyproject=Macintosh&story=1984.txt&topic=Marketing&sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date]{{dead link|date=May 2010}}</ref> For the Apple IIc, Apple wanted an advertisement to demonstrate the power of the machine despite its small size; they ran a memorable television commercial featuring a high-rise office building in which they claimed with words and images that the IIc had all the power necessary to run a large building, suggesting that it had more than enough power for the home user. (This ad, along with the ''1984'' Macintosh ad, was featured in a Marketing telecourse run on PBS.<!-- Marketing is the name and the subject of the telecourse. -->) Apple later aired eight television commercials for the Apple II<small>GS</small>, emphasizing its benefits to education and students, along with some print ads.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theapplecollection.com/Collection/AppleMovies/movies9.html|title=Apple //gs Commercials Quicktime Movies @ The Apple Collection}}</ref> Towards the end of 1982, art director Brent Thomas and Steve Hayden came up with the idea of doing an [[advertising campaign]] based on the timely tagline "Why 1984 will not be like 1984". Chiat-Day shopped it around to a number of clients, including Apple, where it was proposed to be used for a print ad in [[the Wall Street Journal]] promoting the Apple II. However, Apple did not go for it, and the idea was filed away until the spring of 1983, when they met with the Macintosh marketing team to start working on the launch, which was scheduled for January 1984. The idea eventually became the famous ''[[1984 (advertisement)|1984]]'' commercial which aired during the third quarter at [[Super Bowl XVIII]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=1984.txt&topic=Marketing&sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date|title=Folklore.org: Macintosh Stories: 1984}}</ref> ==Clones== [[Image:Taiwanese Apple II clone Cosmo.jpg|thumb|The Jiama (嘉馬) SPS-109, a [[Republic of China|Taiwanese]] clone of the Apple II, looks almost identical to the Apple II and II+, including an identical [[computer case|case]], color and [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] layout. The only noticeable physical difference is the label above the keyboard.]] The Apple II was frequently cloned, both in the [[United States]] and abroad — similar cloning of the IBM PC later occurred. According to some sources (see below), more than 190 different models of [[List of Apple II clones|Apple II clones]] were manufactured. Many of these had "fruit" names (e.g. "Pineapple") to indicate to the initiated that they were Apple II clones. Well-known in the [[Soviet Bloc]] were the [[Agat computer|Agat]], an oversized Russian Apple II clone with a [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]] character set, and [[Bulgaria]]n [[Pravetz series 8]], a close Apple II replica with Cyrillic support. Basis, a German company, created the Basis 108,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=92 |title=The Museum |publisher=Old-Computers.Com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-25}}</ref> a clone for the Apple II that included both a 6502 processor and the Zilog Z80, allowing it to run the CP/M operating system as well as most Apple II software. This machine was unusual in that it was housed in a heavy cast aluminum chassis. The Basis 108 was equipped with built-in [[Centronics]] (parallel) and RS232c (serial) ports, as well as the standard six Apple II compatible slots. Unlike the Apple II it came with a detached full-stroke keyboard (AZERTY/QWERTY) of 100 keys plus 15 functions keys and separate numeric and editing keypads. A [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] (at the time part of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]) company named [[IRIS Computers]] (sub company of biggest electric company in Bosnia and [[Herzegovina]] and Yugoslavia ENERGOINVEST) has produced Apple II clones since the early 1980s. Their official brand name was IRIS 8. They were very expensive and hard to obtain and were produced primarily for usage in early computerized digital telephone systems and for education. Their usage in offices of the state companies, R&D labs and in the Yugoslav army was also reported. IRIS 8 had looks of early IBM PCs — separate central unit with cooling system and two 5.25-inch disks, monitor and keyboard. Compatibility with original Apple II was complete. Elite high schools in Yugoslavia and especially Bosnia and Herzegovina were equipped with clusters of 8, 16 or 32 IRIS 8 computers connected in local network administrated by IRIS 16 PC clone. The number of IRIS 8's produced could be as many as a couple of tens of thousands{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. An [[Australia]]n-produced clone of the Apple II was the [[Medfly computer|Medfly]], named after the [[Mediterranean fruit fly]] that attacks apples. The Medfly computer featured a faster processor, more memory, detached keyboard, lower and upper case characters and a built-in disk controller. Unitron, a Brazilian company, produced another clone, named ApII. Unitron used a copy of the Apple's ROM translated to Portuguese. The operating system was Apple's DOS 3.3 translated to Portuguese. During this period, it was illegal to import microcomputers in Brazil, and buying those (illegal) clones was the only way to have a microcomputer. Unitron stopped manufacturing the ApII a few years after the introduction of IBM PC clones in Brazil. The Ace clones from [[Franklin Computer Corporation]] are the best known and had the most lasting impact, as Franklin copied Apple's ROMs and software and freely admitted to doing so. Franklin's argument: a computer's ROM was simply a pattern of switches locked into a fixed position, and one cannot copyright a pattern of switches. Apple fought Franklin in court for about five years to get its clones off the market, and was ultimately successful when a court ruled that software stored in ROM was in fact copyrightable in the U.S. (See [[Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp.]]) Franklin later released non-infringing but less-compatible clones; these could run ProDOS and AppleWorks and had an Applesoft-like BASIC, but compatibility with other software was hit-or-miss. Apple also challenged [[VTech]]'s [[Laser 128]], an enhanced clone of
