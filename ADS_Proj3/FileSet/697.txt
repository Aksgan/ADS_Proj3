However, their approach was described in a monograph "Multilingual Text-to-Speech Synthesis: The Bell Labs Approach" (Springer, October 31, 1997, ISBN 978-0792380276), and the former employee who was responsible for the project, Chilin Shih (who now works at the University of Illinois), has some notes about her methods on her website.<ref>[https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/cls/www/ Home Page: Chilin Shih<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> ==Non-Windows systems== The above-mentioned Chinese speech synthesis systems (apart from the online demos) are available only for Windows. However, the [[spaced-interval repetition]] language-practice program Gradint includes code and instructions for using KeyTIP and SpeechPlus data on other operating systems, by reading the data directly or using the [[Wine (software)|WINE]] emulator. There are some reports<ref>[http://www.texttospeechblog.com/2007_02_01_archive.html Text To Speech Blog (www.TextToSpeechBlog.com): February 2007<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> that [[SAPI 5]]-based speech synthesizers can be run on recent versions of the [[Wine (software)|WINE]] emulator. Mac OS had Chinese speech synthesizers available up to version 9. This was removed in Mac OS X. From the release 10.5 (Leopard), the built-in VoiceOver application claims to support third-party Chinese voices,<ref>[http://www.apple.com/accessibility/voiceover/ Apple's VoiceOver page]</ref> but no Chinese voice is built in to the operating system and Apple does not provide any links to actual Mac OS X Chinese voice products. ==Notable approaches not yet taken== As of 2007, it appears that there have been no projects to synthesize Chinese by simulating the human vocal tract, as [[GNU Speech]] is doing for English.<ref>[http://www.gnu.org/software/gnuspeech/]</ref> Chinese is also not one of the languages being synthesized in the multilingual [[MBROLA]] project. ==See also== *[[Speech synthesis]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.iflytek.com/english/index.htm Anhui USTC iFlyTek Co., Ltd] homepage {{DEFAULTSORT:Chinese Speech Synthesis}} [[Category:Standard Chinese]] [[Category:Chinese language]] [[Category:Computational linguistics]] [[Category:Artificial intelligence applications]] [[Category:Speech synthesis]] [[it:Sintesi vocale cinese]]</text> </page> <page> <id>6116</id> <title>Chinese wall</title> <text>{{Other uses}} {{Unreferenced|date=July 2008}} In business, a '''Chinese wall''' or '''firewall''' is an information barrier implemented within a firm to separate and isolate persons who make investment decisions from persons who are privy to undisclosed material information which may influence those decisions. This is a way of avoiding [[conflict of interest]] problems. In general, all firms are required to develop, implement, and enforce reasonable policies and procedures to safeguard insider information and to ensure that no improper trading occurs. Although specific procedures are not mandated, adopted practices must be formalized in writing and be appropriate and sufficient. Procedures should address the following areas: [[education]] of [[employees]], containment of [[inside information]], [[restriction]] of [[Financial transaction|transaction]]s, and trading [[surveillance]]. == Popularization == The term was popularized{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} in the United States following the [[stock market]] [[crash of 1929]], when the U.S. government legislated information separation between [[investment bank]]ers and brokerage firms, in order to limit the conflict of interest between objective analysis of companies and the desire for successful [[initial public offering]]s. Rather than prohibiting one company from engaging in both businesses, the government permitted the implementation of Chinese wall procedures. ==Objection to use of the phrase== At least one California judge has taken offense to the phrase ''Chinese Wall.'' In ''Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. v. Superior Court'' 200 Cal.App.3d 272, 293-294, 245 ''Cal.Rptr.'' 873, 887-888 (1988), Presiding Justice Low wrote: {{quote| The term has an ethnic focus which many would consider a subtle form of linguistic discrimination. Certainly, the continued use of the term would be insensitive to the ethnic identity of the many persons of Chinese descent. Modern courts should not perpetuate the biases which creep into language from outmoded, and more primitive, ways of thought.}} Other alternative phrases include ''[[screen]]'' (''[[screening<ref>See Martin v MacDonald Estate (Gray) [1991] 1 WWR 705 at 715, as per Sopinka J.</ref>]]''), ''[[wikt:firewall|firewall]]'', ''[[cone of silence]]'', and ''ethical wall''. ''Screen'' or the verb ''to screen'' is the preferred term under the [[American Bar Association]] (ABA) Model Rules of Professional Conduct,<ref>Model Rules of Profesional Ethics. [http://www.abanet.org/cpr/mrpc/rule_1_0.html http://www.abanet.org/cpr/mrpc/rule_1_0.html]. The ABA Model Rules define ''screening'' as "the isolation of a lawyer from any participation in a matter through the timely imposition of procedures within a firm that are reasonably adequate under the circumstances to protect information that the isolated lawyer is obligated to protect under these Rules or other law."

American Bar Association. 2006.</ref> ==Finance== A Chinese wall is most commonly employed in [[investment bank]]s, between the corporate-advisory area and the brokering department in order to separate those giving corporate advice on takeovers from those advising clients about buying shares. The "wall" is thrown up to prevent leaks of corporate inside information, which could influence the advice given to clients making investments, and allow staff to take advantage of facts that are not yet known to the general public.<ref>http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chinesewall.asp</ref> In spite of Chinese walls, these conflicts of interest arose during the heyday of the "[[.com|dot-com]]" era, when research analysts published dishonest positive analysis on companies in which they, or related parties, owned shares (see [[Global Settlement]]). The U.S. government has since passed laws strengthening the Chinese wall concept (e.g. [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]]) with the desire to more carefully formalize and prevent such conflicts. Chinese walls are also used in the Corporate Finance departments of certain 'Big Four' accountancy firms. They are designed to insulate sensitive documentation from the wider firm in order to prevent conflicts of interest as described above. Due to the proximity of conflicting departments in big four firms, physical walls are often used.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} ==Journalism== The term is also used in [[journalism]] to describe the separation between the editorial and [[advertising]] arms of a media firm. The Chinese wall is regarded as breached for [[advertorial]] projects. ==Law== Chinese Walls are used in [[law firm]]s when one part of the firm, representing a party on a deal or [[litigation]], is
