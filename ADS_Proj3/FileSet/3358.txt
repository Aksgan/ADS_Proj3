picking up one year after the events that saw Optimus Prime's return to life. In the beginning of the series it generally shows Optimus Prime alive again. In the interim year, with the Decepticons not having been heard from, the Autobots had entered into an even closer relationship with Earth, and had begun the colonization of other worlds, the first of which was the planet Athenia, where Optimus Prime was stationed. It soon became apparent, however, that when Prime had released the energy of the Matrix to cure the Hate Plague, the consequences were more far-reaching than he had anticipated — without the energy of the Matrix to act as a balancing factor, Vector Sigma had become destabilized, and the Decepticons suddenly returned to exploit this, assaulting Cybertron in order to seize control of the mega-computer. Prime took a squad of troops to aid in the battle on the planet, and when the arrival of the Autobot [[Headmaster (Transformers)|Headmasters]] tipped the battle in their favor, Prime broke off from the main attack and headed down into the depths of the planet, planning on stabilizing Vector Sigma at any cost. Guided through the dangers of the planet's catacombs by the spirit of Alpha Trion while the other Autobots searched for the Matrix on Earth, Prime eventually arrived at the computer, only to find his way barred by [[Cyclonus]] and [[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]]. Hot Rod then arrived with the Matrix, with which Alpha Trion merged, re-energizing it and transforming Hot Rod back into Rodimus Prime; for the first time, the two Primes fought side-by-side and defeated Galvatron. Before Rodimus could implement the Matrix to stabilize Vector Sigma, however, Optimus Prime sacrificed himself to perform the task, merging with the computer and restoring its balance to save the planet — dying again only a few short episodes after his rebirth. Later Prime would make a final and permanent return in the Japanese Transformers continuity, Battlestars: Return of Convoy. This entry was only available in print form appearing in the Japanese publication, TV Magazine. === Beast Wars === Although the later storyline of Beast Wars would go on to depict Optimus Primal as a different character than Optimus Prime, the commercials and comic which shipped with the original Beast Wars toy versions of Optimus Primal and Megatron depicted them as new incarnations of Optimus Prime and Megatron. Primal as a bat, Megatron as a crocodile. [[Optimus Primal]], leader of the Maximal faction in the ''[[Beast Wars]]'' animated series and toy line, is not Optimus Prime — Primal is one of the Maximal descendants of the Autobots, who took the name to honor the Autobot leader. The same applies to the Megatron of this era. However, before the animated series began, Hasbro did actually envision Prime and Megatron as their beast counterparts — design elements such as Prime's mouth-plate (slitted to add an actual mouth for the animated series) suggest it, and the first mini-comic that came packaged with the toys makes it clear. However, once the animated series began, this had already been changed. Nonetheless, Optimus Prime and Megatron were a major reason the Beast Wars began. The ''Beast Wars'' were waged on prehistoric Earth, eventually leading to the discovery of the buried ''[[Ark (Transformers)|Ark]]''. [[Megatron (Beast Wars and Beast Machines)|Megatron]], following the original Megatron's instructions in a desperate gambit, decided to attempt to change history by killing Optimus Prime, who was still lying in ''The Ark'' in stasis lock. Megatron hoped that this would result in the Decepticons winning ''The Great War'' and eventually the rule of Cybertron by the Predacons, the descendants of the Decepticons. Megatron unleashed a full-power weapon blast at Optimus Prime's face, near-fatally injuring him. However, Optimus Primal proceeded to take Prime's spark into his body to protect it from surgical trauma while his injuries were repaired. The subsequent power increase caused by Prime's spark's connection to the Matrix augmented Primal into the large, transmetal "[[Optimus Primal|Optimal Optimus]]" form with three alternate modes (jet, land vehicle, and transmetal gorilla). Then, with the repairs complete, Prime's spark was restored, and he briefly activated before sinking back into normal stasis. When animating the scene in which Primal removes Prime's spark, Mainframe's animators consulted ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'' for reference on the interior of Prime's chest. However, not realizing the importance of the Matrix of Leadership, they rendered it as a container for Prime's spark. ''Beast Wars'' writers [[Larry DiTillio]] and [[Bob Forward]] have since claimed that in their view, Prime had not received the Matrix from Alpha Trion at this point, but a later comic produced for [[Botcon]] indicated that the Matrix was in fact stored in a secondary compartment, hidden behind Prime's spark. In this comic, the alien [[Vok]] used the Matrix, the [[Transmetal Driver]] and a control suit once piloted by the Predacon [[Quickstrike]] to create [[Primal Prime]]. === Beast Machines === A giant statue of Optimus Prime holding two [[Golden Disk]]s standing in front of the Cybertron Archives appeared on [[Cybertron]] in the ''[[Beast Machines]]'' series. The statue was destroyed by the [[Vehicon]]s in the episode ''Fires of the Past''. When show writer [[Bob Skir]] was asked what these two disks were he said that neither the statue nor disks were in the script, but he suggested that they were either the disks from [[Voyager 1]] and [[Voyager 2]] probes or that Optimus won them in the 2,395,989th Annual Cybertronian spelling bee. Later in the series Optimus Primal discovered the ancient city of [[Iacon]] deep within Cybertron where he was approached by a hologram statue of Optimus Prime, but it ended up being Megatron in disguise, who used the opportunity to steal Optimus Primal's access to the [[Vector Sigma#Beast Machines|Oracle]]. [[Obsidian (Transformers)|Obsidian]] also comments on how [[Optimus Primal]] is not as great a leader as Prime. == Books == Optimus Prime appeared in the following books: *The 1984 sticker and story book ''[[Return to Cybertron]]'' written by [[Suzanne Weyn]] and published by [[Marvel Books]]. *The 1984 sticker and story
