grammar for the analysis of structural derivation in Russian. That grammar relegated the data to four levels of representation, corresponding to: # ''Level 1'' - ‘real world' structuring # ''Level 2'' - syntacto-semantic structuring reflective of mental activity # ''Level 3'' - lexical code transposed from ''Level 2'' # ''Level 4'' - articulatory/orthographic code transposed from ''Level 3'' Lytle employed one of the junction operators (subjunction) as a formal device to impose the properties of a governing category upon existing structure to obtain ‘derived’ forms (e.g., ‘transform-ation’ - '''Noun * Verb'''). ==Early Literature== Early literature on JG was published in ''Junction Theory and Application'', the journal of the BYU ''Translation Sciences Institute'' (TSI), and/or the proceedings of the University’s ''Annual Linguistic Symposium''.<ref>This symposium was sponsored in the early ‘70s either by TSI or the ''Language Research Center'' and subsequently by the ''Deseret Language and Linguistics Society.''

Following these studies, it was concluded that the J-rules comprising the syntacto-semantic base of the model proffered a pool of structural possibilities from which all natural languages draw, but that none necessarily uses them all nor the same subset. ==Early NLP Application== During the early ‘70s, at the urging and under the auspices of the Department of Defense, Lytle and a team of colleagues conducted research at BYU in computer-assisted, human-interactive translation in which junction grammars were subjected to formalization<ref>Melby, Alan K. (1972). “A Formalization of Junction Grammar.” ''LINGUISTICS SYMPOSIUM: AUTOMATIC LANGUAGE PROCESSING'', 30–31 March 1972.

When positive results evinced proof of concept and a software prototype, funds from the private sector were invested to develop and test a one-to-many system based on the same translation model in expanded form - in particular, translations were synthesized from J-trees of English obtained via human interaction into Russian, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, and Chinese.<ref>Melby, Alan K. (1973) "Junction Grammar and Machine Translation." Paper read at the International Conference on Computational Linguistics held in Pisa, Italy.</ref> Just prior to his inauguration as president, Gerald Ford and an entourage of VIPS visited the development site to receive a briefing on the concept and progress of the work. At the conclusion of this endeavor, an alpha model of the software translated a book submitted for test purposes and yielded translations in the cited target languages. While significant post-editing was required, suggesting - among other improvements - that a second, language-specific interaction may well improve the design, the utility of computers as a useful translation aid, both in standardizing the use of terminology and expediting the overall translation process had been demonstrated.<ref>ALP Systems, a private corporation subsequently acquired rights from BYU to commercialize the technologies developed under its computer-interactive translation research programs. ALP Systems later offered translation services as ALPNET.</ref> [[File:Computer-translation Briefing for Gerald Ford.jpg|frame|alt=President Ford|left|Briefing for President Gerald Ford on the JG-based, one-to-many translation model. Eldon G. Lytle is at left.]] ==Junction Phonology== JG adherents soon observed that the structural particulars of ''adjunction, conjunction,'' and ''subjunction'' are relevant beyond conventional linguistic structuring. More specifically, they lend themselves to such diverse structural scenarios as spousal interaction, departmental interaction in institutions, and a host of other real-world phenomena. In response to this observation, Lytle developed a method of phonological representation based on phonemic operands and junction operators.<ref>Lytle, Eldon G. (1976). “Junction Grammar as a Base for Dynamic Phonological Representation.” ''LANGUAGE & LINGUISTICS SYMPOSIUM'', 22–23 March 1976.
