In this case the length of args is not allowed to be zero or less. ===== Non-nullable types ===== Spec# extends C# with non-nullable types that simply checks so the variables of nullable types that has been set as non-nullable are not <code>null</code>. If is <code>null</code> then an exception will be thrown. <source lang="csharp"> string! input </source> In use: <source lang="csharp"> public Test(string! input) { ... } </source> ===== Preconditions ===== Preconditions are checked before a method is executed. <source lang="csharp"> public Test(int i) requires i > 0; { this.i = i; } </source> ===== Postconditions ===== Postconditions are conditions that are ensured to be correct when a method has been executed. <source lang="csharp"> public void Increment() ensures i > 0; { i++; } </source> ===== Checked exceptions ===== Spec# adds checked exceptions like those in Java. <source lang="csharp"> public void DoSomething() throws SomeException; //SomeException : ICheckedException { ... } </source> ==See also== * [[C Sharp (programming language)]] * [[Visual C Sharp]] * [[.NET Framework]] * [[Mono (software)]] ==References== {{Reflist}} # <cite id="Archer">{{cite book | title=Inside C#| last=Archer| first=Tom| year=2001| publisher=Microsoft Press| isbn=0-7356-1288-9}}</cite> # <cite id="Spec#">[http://bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/archive/2005/08/09/3438.aspx Bart de Smet on Spec#]</cite> ==External links== *[http://www.microsoft.com/net/ Microsoft .NET Framework] *[http://en.csharp-online.net/CSharp_Language_Specification C# Language Specification (hyperlinked)] *[http://www.mono-project.com/ Mono project] {{DEFAULTSORT:C Sharp Syntax}} [[Category:C Sharp programming language family]] [[tr:C Sharp sözdizimi]]</text> </page> <page> <id>5290</id> <title>Cablefree</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=October 2010}} {{Infobox company| company_name = CableFree Solutions Ltd.| company_logo = [[Image:CableFree logo.png]] | company_type = [[Private company|Private]] | foundation = 1997| industry = [[Technology]]| location = [[London, United Kingdom]] | products = [[Computer networking|Networking]] | homepage = [http://www.cablefreesolutions.com/ www.cablefreesolutions.com] |}} '''CableFree Solutions''' '''Ltd.''' provides high-capacity wireless [[Ethernet]] and [[Time-division multiplexing|TDM]] wireless [[backhaul]] solutions to cellular network operators, IP service providers, WISPs, Government, Healthcare, Financial, Education, [[CCTV]] and Broadcast customers.

It is used primarily by [[architect]]s, but has tools for [[surveying|surveyor]]s and [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[civil engineering|civil]] and [[construction engineering|construction]] engineers. It was initially designed as a electronic [[drawing board]], using concepts and tools clearly related to a physical board.<ref>http://www.revitup.co.za/main/page_10862.php A competitor of Caddie uses "electronic drawing board" as a slur.</ref> Caddie requires a [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] [[dongle]].<ref>http://www.xt.co.za/Caddie_Overview.htm</ref> Without the dongle, the program can be used as a viewer and plot station for any [[.dwg|DWG]] drawings, but it can't save drawings after the 14 day evaluation has expired. Caddie works on [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]].<ref>http://caddiesoftware.com/caddiesoftware/hardware-requirements.html</ref><ref>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/Windows-7/en-us/Details.aspx?type=Software&p=Caddie%20Professional&v=Advanced%20Computer%20Solutions&uid=15&l=en&pf=3&pi=5&c=Graphics%20%26%20Printing&sc=Image%20Editing&os=32-bit</ref> == Version history == Caddie started life as student project called Michael Angelo in 1985.<ref>http://www.caddiesoftware.com/pdf/caddie14webinfo.pdf</ref> The first release version was called Caddie and fit on a single 360 k [[floppy disk]], and was designed for the [[IBM Personal Computer XT]]. Caddie was one of the first CAD tools that utilised microcomputers and did not require a [[mainframe computer]] with [[workstation]] access. Version 1 of Caddie was released in 1986, for [[MS-DOS]]. The first version for [[Microsoft Windows]] ([[16-bit]]) was released in September 1993. The [[32-bit]] Windows version was released in May 1997.<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/19981203075505/www.caddie.co.za/history.html</ref> Version 6 was available by 2000. In the same year, a lite version of Caddie was available, called Caddie Budget,<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20000303154429/www.caddie.co.uk/caddie.htm</ref> with the non-lite version being called Caddie Professional. Version 7 was available in 2001.<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20010630120314/www.caddie.co.uk/budget.htm</ref> Caddy Budget Architectural 7 retailed in the UK for £595 in 2003.<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20030324170034/www.caddie.co.uk/c7wbudget.pdf</ref> Version 9 was released in January 2003.<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20030207141222/http://www.caddie.co.uk/</ref> Caddie initially used its own proprietary file format CEX (Caddie Exchange format), but since version 10, Caddie's native format is the open format [[OpenDWG]].<ref>http://www.engineeringtalk.com/news/oen/oen105.html</ref><ref>http://www.microstationconnections.com/print_article.php?cpfeatureid=205</ref> Version 10 was released in March 2005.<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20050404231918/www.caddiesoftware.com/</ref> Version 11 was released in January 2007 and was the first version compatible with Windows Vista.<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20070927093747/www.caddiesoftware.com/</ref> Caddie 12 was released in September 2008.<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20080430133103/www.caddiesoftware.com/</ref> The latest version of Caddie is version 16, released in September 2010. There are four versions of the product, namely Caddie Professional (the full version), Caddie Budget (the lite version), Caddie Vio (for photo-realistic [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]], based on Lightworks<ref>http://www.lightworkdesign.com/news_archive/2008</ref>) and Caddie Educational, which is licensed to students even though it has all the functionality of Caddie Professional.<ref>http://caddiesoftware.com/caddiesoftware/products.html</ref> == Company history == Caddie was originally developed in [[South Africa]] in 1985, and it quickly established a significant presence in its home market. The product's position in South Africa began to erode in the 1990s following the lifting of [[Disinvestment from South Africa|economic sanctions against South Africa]], as other CAD packages entered that market. A Microsoft Windows version of Caddie was not released until 1993. In 1998, Caddie was acquired by the South African software development company Billcad Holdings.
