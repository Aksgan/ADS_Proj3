cost for the consumer market, finding good components and making sure they work compatibly with each other is a great challenge in workstation building. Because workstations are designed for high-end tasks such as weather forecasting, video rendering, and game design, it's taken for granted that these systems must be running under full-load, non-stop for several hours or even days without issue. Any off-the-shelf components can be used to build a workstation, but the lifespans of such components under such rigorous conditions are questionable. For this reason, almost no workstations are built by the customer themselves but rather purchased from a vendor such as [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[IBM]], [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]], [[Apple Inc|Apple]], or [[Dell]]. *Tight integration between the OS and the hardware: Workstation vendors both design the hardware and maintain the Unix operating system variant that runs on it. This allows for much more rigorous testing than is possible with an operating system such as Windows. Windows requires that 3rd party hardware vendors write compliant hardware drivers that are stable and reliable. Also, minor variation in hardware quality such as timing or build quality can affect the reliability of the overall machine. Workstation vendors are able to ensure both the quality of the hardware, and the stability of the operating system drivers by validating these things in-house, and this leads to a generally much more reliable and stable machine. These days, workstations have changed greatly. Since many of the components are now the same as those used in the consumer market, the price differential between the lower end workstation and consumer PCs may be narrower than it once was. For example, some low-end workstations use CISC based processors like the [[Intel]] [[Pentium 4]] or [[AMD]] [[Athlon 64]] as their CPUs. Higher-end workstations still use more sophisticated CPUs such as the Intel [[Xeon]], AMD [[Opteron]], [[IBM POWER]], or Sun's [[UltraSPARC]], and run a variant of [[Unix]], delivering a truly reliable workhorse for computing-intensive tasks. Indeed, it is perhaps in the area of the more sophisticated CPU where the true workstation may be found. Although both the consumer desktop and the workstation benefit from CPUs designed around the multicore concept (essentially, multiple processors on a die, of which the POWER4 was a pioneer of this technique), modern (as of 2008) workstations use multiple multicore CPUs, error correcting memory and much larger on-die caches. Such power and reliability are not normally required on a general desktop computer. IBM's POWER-based processor boards and the workstation-level Intel-based Xeon processor boards, for example, have multiple CPUs, more on-die cache and ECC memory, which are features more suited to demanding content-creation, engineering and scientific work than to general desktop computing. Some workstations are designed for use with only one specific application such as [[AutoCAD]], [[Avid]] [[Xpress Studio HD]], [[3D Studio Max]], etc. To ensure compatibility with the software, purchasers usually ask for a certificate from the software vendor. The certification process makes the workstation's price jump several notches but for professional purposes, reliability is more important than the initial purchase cost. ==History== [[Image:Xerox Alto.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Xerox Alto]] workstation, first to use a [[graphical user interface]] with mouse and origin of [[ethernet]].]] Perhaps the first computer that might qualify as a "workstation" was the [[IBM 1620]], a small scientific computer designed to be used interactively by a single person sitting at the console. It was introduced in 1959. One peculiar feature of the machine was that it lacked any actual arithmetic circuitry. To perform addition, it required a memory-resident table of decimal addition rules. This saved on the cost of logic circuitry, enabling IBM to make it inexpensive. The machine was code-named CADET, which some people waggishly claimed meant "Can't Add, Doesn't Even Try". Nonetheless, it rented initially for $1000 a month. In 1965, IBM introduced the [[IBM 1130]] scientific computer, which was meant as the successor to the 1620. Both of these systems came with the ability to run programs written in [[Fortran]] and other languages. Both the 1620 and the 1130 were built into roughly desk-sized cabinets. Both were available with add-on disk drives, printers, and both paper-tape and punched-card I/O. A console typewriter for direct interaction was standard on each. Early examples of workstations were generally dedicated [[minicomputer]]s; a system designed to support a number of users would instead be reserved exclusively for one person. A notable example was the [[PDP-8]] from [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], regarded to be the first commercial minicomputer. The [[Lisp machine]]s developed at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in the early 1970s pioneered some of the principles of the workstation computer, as they were high-performance, networked, single-user systems intended for heavily interactive use. Lisp Machines were commercialized beginning 1980 by companies like [[Symbolics]], [[Lisp Machines]], [[Texas Instruments]] (the [[TI Explorer]]) and [[Xerox]] (the [[Interlisp-D]] workstations). The first computer designed for single-users, with high-resolution graphics facilities (and so a workstation in the modern sense of the term) was the [[Xerox Alto]] developed at [[Xerox PARC]] in 1973. Other early workstations include the [[Three Rivers PERQ]] (1979) and the later [[Xerox Star]] (1981). In the early 1980s, with the advent of [[32-bit]] [[microprocessor]]s such as the [[Motorola 68000]], a number of new participants in this field appeared, including [[Apollo Computer]] and [[Sun Microsystems]], who created [[Unix]]-based workstations based on this processor. Meanwhile [[DARPA]]'s [[VLSI Project]] created several spinoff graphics products as well, notably the [[SGI 3130]], and [[Silicon Graphics]]' range of machines that followed. It was not uncommon to differentiate the target market for the products, with Sun and Apollo considered to be '''network workstations''', while the SGI machines were '''graphics workstations'''. As [[RISC]] microprocessors became available in the mid-1980s, these were adopted by many workstation vendors. Workstations tended to be very expensive, typically several times the cost of a standard PC and sometimes costing as much as a new [[automobile|car]]. However, minicomputers sometimes cost as much as a house. The high expense usually came from using costlier components that ran faster than those found at the local computer store, as well as the inclusion of
