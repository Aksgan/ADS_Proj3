Nevertheless Germany's [[List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions per capita|carbon dioxide emissions per capita]] are among the highest in the EU, although they are significantly lower than those of Australia, Canada, Saudi Arabia and the United States. Emissions from coal-burning utilities and industries contribute to air pollution. Acid rain, resulting from sulphur dioxide emissions, continues to damage German [[forest]]s. Pollution in the Baltic Sea from raw sewage and industrial effluents from rivers in former East Germany have been reduced. The government under Chancellor Schröder announced the intention to end the use of nuclear power for producing electricity. Germany is working to meet EU commitments to identify nature preservation areas in line with the EU's Flora, Fauna, and Habitat directive. Germany's last glaciers in the Alpine region are experiencing deglaciation. Natural hazards are river flooding in spring and stormy winds occurring in all regions. ==Politics== {{Main|Politics of Germany}} [[File:Politisches System des Bundes und der Länder in Deutschland.svg|thumb|230px|The political system of Germany is written down in the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law (Grundgesetz)]]. ]] Germany is a [[federal republic|federal]], [[parliamentary democratic|parliamentary]], [[representative democracy|representative]] [[democracy|democratic]] [[republic]]. The German political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1949 [[constitution|constitutional document]] known as the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|''Grundgesetz'']] ([[Basic Law]]). By calling the document ''Grundgesetz'', rather than ''Verfassung'' ([[constitution]]), the authors expressed the intention that it would be replaced by a proper constitution once Germany was reunited as one state. Amendments to the ''Grundgesetz'' generally require a two-thirds majority of both chambers of the [[parliament]]; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, and the rule of law are valid in perpetuity.<ref name="Art 79">{{cite web|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gg/art_79.html|title=Article 79 of the ''Grundgesetz''|work=Bundesministerium der Justiz|publisher=www.gesetze-im-internet.de|language=German|accessdate=2008-12-07}}</ref> Despite the initial intention, the ''Grundgesetz'' remained in effect after the [[German reunification]] in 1990, with only minor amendments. ===Government=== [[File:Christian Wulff 2008-04-17.jpg|thumb|left|[[Christian Wulff]] has been the [[President of Germany]] since June 2010. The head of state holds primarily representative powers.]] The [[President of Germany|President]], [[Christian Wulff]], is the [[head of state]] and invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers. He is elected by the ''[[Bundesversammlung (Germany)|Bundesversammlung]]'' (federal convention), an institution consisting of the members of the ''Bundestag'' and an equal number of state delegates. The second highest official in the [[German order of precedence]] is the ''Bundestagspräsident'' ([[President of the Bundestag|President of the ''Bundestag'']]), who is elected by the ''Bundestag'' and responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body. The third-highest official and the [[head of government]] is the Chancellor, who is appointed by the ''Bundespräsident'' after being elected by the ''Bundestag''. The Chancellor can be removed by a [[constructive vote of no confidence]] by the ''Bundestag'', where constructive implies that the ''Bundestag'' simultaneously has to elect a successor. [[File:Reichstag building Berlin view from west before sunset.jpg|thumb|290px|The [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] in Berlin is the site of the German parliament (Bundestag)]] The [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]]—currently [[Angela Merkel]]—is the [[head of government]] and exercises [[executive (government)|executive power]], similar to the role of a [[Prime Minister]] in other [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracies]]. Federal [[legislative power]] is vested in the parliament consisting of the ''[[Bundestag]]'' (Federal Diet) and ''[[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]'' (Federal Council), which together form a unique type of legislative body. The ''Bundestag'' is elected through [[direct election]]s, by [[proportional representation]] ([[mixed member proportional representation|mixed-member]]). The members of the ''Bundesrat'' represent the governments of the [[States of Germany|sixteen federated
