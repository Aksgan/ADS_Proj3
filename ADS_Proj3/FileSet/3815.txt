which is almost always a software component. Robotic telescopes operate under [[Closed-loop controller|closed loop]] or [[Open-loop controller|open loop]] principles. In an open loop system, a robotic telescope system points itself and collects its data without inspecting the results of its operations to ensure it is operating properly. An open loop telescope is sometimes said to be operating on faith, in that if something goes wrong, there is no way for the control system to detect it and compensate. A closed loop system has the capability to evaluate its operations through redundant inputs to detect errors. A common such input would be position encoders on the telescope's axes of motion, or the capability of evaluating the system's images to ensure it was pointed at the correct [[field of view]] when they were exposed. Most robotic telescopes are [[small telescope]]s. While large observatory instruments may be highly automated, few are operated without attendants. ==History of professional robotic telescopes== Robotic telescopes were first developed by [[astronomer]]s after [[electromechanical]] interfaces to [[computer]]s became common at [[observatory|observatories]]. Early examples were expensive, had limited capabilities, and included a large number of unique subsystems, both in hardware and software. This contributed to a lack of progress in the development of robotic telescopes early in their history. By the early 1980s, with the availability of cheap computers, several viable robotic telescope projects were conceived, and a few were developed. The 1985 book, ''Microcomputer Control of Telescopes'', by Mark Trueblood and Russell M. Genet, was a landmark engineering study in the field. One of this book's achievements was pointing out many reasons, some quite subtle, why telescopes could not be reliably pointed using only basic astronomical calculations. The concepts explored in this book share a common heritage with the telescope mount error modeling software called [[Tpoint]], which emerged from the first generation of large automated telescopes in the 1970s, notably the [[3.9m Anglo-Australian Telescope]]. Since the late 1980s, the [[University of Iowa]] has been in the forefront of robotic telescope development on the professional side. The [[Automated Telescope Facility]] (ATF), developed in the early 1990s, was located on the roof of the physics building at the University of Iowa in [[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City]]. They went on to complete the [[Iowa Robotic Observatory]], a robotic and remote telescope at the private [[Winer Observatory]] in 1997. This system successfully observed [[variable star]]s and contributed observations to dozens of [[scientific paper]]s. In May 2002, they completed the [[Rigel Telescope]]. The Rigel was a 0.37-meter (14.5-inch) F/14 built by [[Optical Mechanics, Inc.]] and controlled by the Talon program.<ref> http://www.sierrastars.com/gp/Rigel/RigelTelescope.aspx</ref> Each of these was a progression toward a more automated and utilitarian observatory. One of the largest current networks of robotic telescopes is [[RoboNet]], operated by a consortium of [[United Kingdom|UK]] universities. The [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research]] (LINEAR) Project is another example of a professional robotic telescope. LINEAR's competitors, the [[Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search]], [[Catalina Sky Survey]], [[Spacewatch]], and others, have also developed varying levels of automation. In 2002, the RAPid Telescopes for Optical Response (RAPTOR) project pushed the envelope of automated robotic astronomy by becoming the first fully autonomous closedâ€“loop robotic telescope. RAPTOR was designed in 2000 and began full deployment in 2002. Its first light on one of the wide field instruments was in late 2001, with the second wide field system coming online in early 2002. Closed loop operations began in 2002. Originally the goal of RAPTOR was to develop a system of ground-based telescopes that would reliably respond to satellite triggers and more importantly, identify transients in real-time and generate alerts with source locations to enable follow-up observations with other, larger, telescopes. It has achieved both of these goals quite successfully. Now RAPTOR has been re-tuned to be the key hardware element of the [http://www.thinkingtelescopes.lanl.gov/ Thinking Telescopes Technologies Project]. Its new mandate will be the monitoring of the night sky looking for interesting and anomalous behaviors in persistent sources using some of the most advanced robotic software ever deployed. The two wide field systems are a mosaic of CCD cameras. The mosaic covers and area of approximately 1500 square degrees to a depth of 12th magnitude. Centered in each wide field array is a single fovea system with a field of view of 4 degrees and depth of 16th magnitude. The wide field systems are separated by a 38km baseline. Supporting these wide field systems are two other operational telescopes. The first of these is a cataloging patrol instrument with a mosaic 16 square degree field of view down to 16 magnitude. The other system is a .4m OTA with a yielding a depth of 19-20th magnitude and a coverage of .35 degrees. Three additional systems are currently undergoing development and testing and deployment will be staged over the next two years. All of the systems are mounted on custom manufactured, fast-slewing mounts capable of reaching any point in the sky in 3 seconds. The RAPTOR System is located on site at Los Alamos National Laboratory (USA) and has been supported through the Laboratory's Directed Research and Development funds. In 2004, some professional robotic telescopes were characterized by a lack of design creativity and a reliance on [[closed source]] and [[proprietary software]]. The software is usually unique to the telescope it was designed for and cannot be used on any other system. Often, robotic telescope software developed at universities becomes impossible to maintain and ultimately [[Obsolescence|obsolete]] because the [[graduate student]]s who wrote it move on to new positions, and their institutions lose their knowledge. Large telescope consortia or government funded laboratories don't tend to have this same loss of developers as experienced by universities. Professional systems generally feature very high observing efficiency and reliability. There is also an increasing tendency to adopt ASCOM technology at a few professional facilities (see following section). The need for proprietary software is usually driven by the competition for research dollars between institutions. ==History of amateur robotic telescopes== In 2004, most robotic telescopes are in the hands of [[amateur astronomy|amateur astronomers]].
