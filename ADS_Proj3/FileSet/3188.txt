partials of a voice or "wanted noise", will be untouched. The region is typically defined by the location of the signal Instantaneous Frequency<ref>B. Boashash, "Estimating and Interpreting the Instantaneous Frequency of a Signal-Part I: Fundamentals", Proceedings of the IEEE, Vol. 80, No. 4, pp. 519-538, April 1992, doi:10.1109/5.135376</ref>, as most of the signal energy to be preserved is concentrated about it. Modern digital sound (and picture) recordings no longer need to worry about tape hiss so analog style noise reduction systems are not necessary. However, an interesting twist is that [[dither]] systems actually add noise to a signal to improve its quality. == In images == Images taken with both [[digital camera]]s and conventional [[film camera]]s will pick up noise from a variety of sources. Many further uses of these images require that the noise will be (partially) removed - for [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] purposes as in [[art]]istic work or [[marketing]], or for practical purposes such as [[computer vision]]. === Types === In [[salt and pepper noise]] (sparse light and dark disturbances), [[pixel]]s in the image are very different in color or intensity from their surrounding pixels; the defining characteristic is that the value of a noisy pixel bears no relation to the color of surrounding pixels. Generally this type of noise will only affect a small number of image pixels. When viewed, the image contains dark and white dots, hence the term salt and pepper noise. Typical sources include flecks of dust inside the camera and overheated or faulty [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] elements. In [[Gaussian noise]], each pixel in the image will be changed from its original value by a (usually) small amount. A histogram, a plot of the amount of distortion of a pixel value against the frequency with which it occurs, shows a [[normal distribution]] of noise. While other distributions are possible, the Gaussian (normal) distribution is usually a good model, due to the [[central limit theorem]] that says that the sum of different noises tends to approach a Gaussian distribution. In either case, the noises at different pixels can be either correlated or uncorrelated; in many cases, noise values at different pixels are modeled as being [[independent and identically distributed]], and hence uncorrelated. === Removal === ==== Tradeoffs ==== In selecting a noise reduction algorithm, one must weigh several factors: * the available computer power and time available: a digital camera must apply noise reduction in a fraction of a second using a tiny onboard CPU, while a desktop computer has much more power and time * whether sacrificing some real detail is acceptable if it allows more noise to be removed (how aggressively to decide whether variations in the image are noise or not) * the characteristics of the noise and the detail in the image, to better make those decisions ==== Chroma and luminance noise separation ==== In real-world photographs, the highest spatial-frequency detail consists mostly of variations in brightness ("luminance detail") rather than variations in hue ("chroma detail"). Since any noise reduction algorithm should attempt to remove noise without sacrificing real detail from the scene photographed, one risks a greater loss of detail from luminance noise reduction than chroma noise reduction simply because most scenes have little high frequency chroma detail to begin with. In addition, most people find chroma noise in images more objectionable than luminance noise; the colored blobs are considered "digital-looking" and unnatural, compared to the grainy appearance of luminance noise that some compare to film grain. For these two reasons, most photographic noise reduction algorithms split the image detail into chroma and luminance components and apply more noise reduction to the former; the in-camera noise reduction algorithm used by [[Nikon]]'s [[DSLR]]'s, in particular, is known for this.<ref>http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikond300/page18.asp</ref> Most dedicated noise-reduction computer software allows the user to control chroma and luminance noise reduction separately. ==== Linear smoothing filters ==== One method to remove noise is by [[convolution|convolving]] the original image with a mask that represents a [[low-pass filter]] or smoothing operation. For example, the Gaussian mask comprises elements determined by a [[Gaussian function]]. This convolution brings the value of each pixel into closer harmony with the values of its neighbors. In general, a smoothing filter sets each pixel to the average value, or a weighted average, of itself and its nearby neighbors; the Gaussian filter is just one possible set of weights. Smoothing filters tend to blur an image, because pixel intensity values that are significantly higher or lower than the surrounding neighborhood would "smear" across the area. Because of this blurring, linear filters are seldom used in practice for noise reduction; they are, however, often used as the basis for nonlinear noise reduction filters. ==== Anisotropic diffusion ==== {{Main|Anisotropic diffusion}} Another method for removing noise is to evolve the image under a smoothing [[partial differential equation]] similar to the [[heat equation]] which is called [[anisotropic diffusion]]. With a spatially constant diffusion coefficient, this is equivalent to the [[heat equation]] or linear Gaussian filtering, but with a diffusion coefficient designed to detect edges, the noise can be removed without blurring the edges of the image. ==== Nonlinear filters ==== A [[median filter]] is an example of a non-linear filter and, if properly designed, is very good at preserving image detail. To run a median filter: # consider each pixel in the image # sort the neighbouring pixels into order based upon their intensities # replace the original value of the pixel with the [[median]] value from the list A median filter is a rank-selection (RS) filter, a particularly harsh member of the family of rank-conditioned rank-selection (RCRS) filters;<ref>{{cite book | title = Fuzzy Neural Network Theory and Application | author = Puyin Liu and Hongxing Li | publisher = World Scientific | year = 2004 | isbn = 9812387862 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=6p8fCgT0QNMC&pg=PA13&dq=%22rank+conditioned+rank+selection%22&lr=&as_brr=3&sig=7dvBSM4GabWfrzeh6d2mItER6NY#PPA13,M1 }}</ref> a much milder member of that family, for example one that selects the closest of the neighboring values when a pixel's value is external in its neighborhood, and leaves it unchanged otherwise, is sometimes preferred, especially in photographic applications.
