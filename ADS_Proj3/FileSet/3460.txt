The Penrose diagram simply added to Kruskal and Szekeres' diagram the conformal crunching of the regions of flat space-time far from the hole. [[Image:PENROSE2.PNG|right|thumb|Penrose Diagrams of various black hole solutions]] While the basic [[space-like]] passage of a static black hole cannot be traversed, Penrose diagrams for rotating and/or electrically charged black holes reveal "inner event horizons" (lying in the future) and vertically oriented singularities, which open up what is known as a "[[time-like]] wormhole" allowing passage into future universes. In the case of the rotating hole, there is also a "negative gravity" universe entered through a ring-shaped singularity (still portrayed as a line in the diagram) that can be passed through if entering the hole close to its [[Coordinate axis|axis]] of rotation. With all of this hypothesis regarding wormholes, some scientists have pointed out that 1) This does not describe a typical black hole created from the collapse of a star (which cuts off the past-oriented "white hole" geometry and other universe). Such wormholes would only be possible if a "past singularity" (such as a remnant of the original [[Big Bang]] singularity that remained compact) continued erupting into the universe as time went on. 2) The radiation of orbiting, highly [[blue-shift]]ed light rays surrounding a black hole (called a '''"blue sheet"''') would make it impossible for anyone to pass through, and in fact might create another kind of singularity outside the hole! == See also == * [[Causality]] * [[Weyl transformation]] * [[Causal structure]] * [[Conformal cyclic cosmology]] ==References== *{{cite book | author=d'Inverno, Ray | title=Introducing Einstein's Relativity | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1992 | isbn=0-19-859686-3}} See ''Chapter 17'' (and various succeeding sections) for a very readable introduction to the concept of conformal infinity plus examples. *{{cite web | author=Frauendiener, Jörg | title=Conformal Infinity | work=Living Reviews in Relativity | url=http://relativity.livingreviews.org/Articles/lrr-2004-1/index.html | accessdate=February 2, 2004}} *{{cite journal | author=Carter, Brandon | title=Complete Analytic Extension of the Symmetry Axis of Kerr's Solution of Einstein's Equations | journal=Phys.
