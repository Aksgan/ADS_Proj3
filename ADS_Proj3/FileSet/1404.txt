However, this can damage certain Exif headers if changes are applied.<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Nikon also warn about Windows XP | url=http://www.dpreview.com/news/0112/01121402nikonxpwarnings.asp | publisher=Digital Photography Review | date=2001-12-14 | accessdate=2008-01-28}}</ref> As of the release of Service Pack 3, Windows XP still shows evidence of corrupting Exif tags when modifying JPG file properties via the file properties window.<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Should XPComment changes affect Exif Byte Order and File Mod Time? | url=http://www.webcitation.org/5nfrK96yR | publisher= | date=2010-02-15 | accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref> In Windows Mobile (Pocket PC), freeware XnView Pocket can display the Exif data. On [[Mac OS X]] 10.4 and above, this information may be viewed in the Finder by doing Get Info on a file and expanding the More Info section. On [[Unix]] systems using the [[GNOME]] [[desktop environment]], a subset of Exif data can be seen by right clicking the file in the [[Nautilus file manager]] and selecting properties. In [[KDE]], it can be seen by right clicking in the [[Dolphin (software)|Dolphin]] file manager, selecting "Properties" and then "Information".{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} It is also possible to view and edit Exif data in [[digiKam]] photo management program.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digikam.org/drupal/node/148 |title=digiKam has a new Kipi Plugin to edit pictures metadata |publisher=digikam.org |date=2006-10-17 |accessdate=2011-01-05 }}</ref> Most Unix image viewers give the full set of Exif data. There are many software tools available which allow both viewing and editing of Exif data. The [[Opanda IExif Viewer]] is a free stand-alone application for viewing Exif data and also a plug-in for [[Internet Explorer]] and [[Firefox]] on Windows platforms. [http://www.kiwiczech.net/index.php?menu=353&sub=4 EXIFeditor] is another free application that allows editing of EXIF information. It allows examination of detailed Exif data online by right clicking on an image.<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Opanda IExif is a professional Exif viewer for your D40, D40x & D60 Pictures | url=http://nikond40blog.blogspot.com/2008/02/opanda-iexif-is-professional-exif.html | publisher=Digital Photography Review | date=2008-02-19 | accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref> [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5673 FxIF] and [[Exif Viewer]] are multi-platform extensions for Firefox that display Exif data in the image properties dialog. This feature is native in the web browser [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], under image properties. Retrieval of detailed Exif data not usually displayed by other programs can be accomplished using [[ExifTool]] which runs in [[Perl]], and is available for all platforms. For AmigaOS/MorphOS, [[SView5]] as well as .NET covers a lot of the previously mentioned functionality. To deal with the privacy problems that Exif may pose to those who share their photographs with others, specialized [[metadata removal tool]]s which can remove Exif exist.<ref>For example [http://www.steelbytes.com/?mid=30 JPEG & PNG Stripper], [http://www.digitalconfidence.com/downloads.html BatchPurifier LITE], [http://www.rlvision.com/exif/about.asp Exif Tag Remover], and [http://www.superutils.com/products/exifcleaner/ ExifCleaner] </ref> == Example == [[Image:Konqueror Exif data.jpg|thumb|right|[[Konqueror]] screenshot showing Exif data]] The following table shows Exif data for a photo made with a typical digital camera.
