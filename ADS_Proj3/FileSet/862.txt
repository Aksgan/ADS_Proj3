'''Computational photography''' refers broadly to computational imaging techniques that enhance or extend the capabilities of [[digital photography]]. The output of these techniques is an ordinary photograph, but one that could not have been taken by a traditional [[camera]]. Its current definition, which stems from a 2004 course at Stanford University and a 2005 symposium at MIT (see links below), has evolved to cover a number of subject areas in [[computer graphics]], [[computer vision]], and applied [[optics]]. These areas are given below, organized according to a taxonomy proposed by [[Shree K. Nayar]]. Within each area is a list of techniques, and for each technique one or two representative papers or books are cited. Deliberately omitted from the taxonomy are [[image processing]] (see also [[digital image processing]]) techniques applied to traditionally captured images in order to produce better images. Examples of such techniques are [[image scaling]], dynamic range compression (i.e. [[tone mapping]]), [[color management]], image completion (a.k.a. inpainting or hole filling), [[image compression]], [[digital watermarking]], and artistic image effects. Also omitted are techniques that produce [[3D scanner|range data]], [[voxel|volume data]], [[3D model]]s, [[light field|4D light fields]], 4D, 6D, or 8D [[Bidirectional reflectance distribution function|BRDF]]s, or other high-dimensional image-based representations. ==Computational illumination== Controlling photographic illumination in a structured fashion, then processing the captured images, to create new images. The applications include image-based relighting, image enhancement, image deblurring, geometry/material recovery and so forth. ==Computational optics== Capture of optically coded images, followed by computational decoding to produce new images. [[Coded aperture]] imaging was mainly applied in astronomy or X-ray imaging to boost the image quality. Instead of a single pin-hole, a pinhole pattern is applied in imaging, and [[deconvolution]] is performed to recover the image. In [[coded exposure imaging]], the on/off state of the shutter is coded to modify the kernel of [[motion blur]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.media.mit.edu/~raskar/deblur/ |title=Coded Exposure Photography: Motion Deblurring using Fluttered Shutter |first1=Ramesh |last1=Raskar |first2=Amit |last2=Agrawal |first3=Jack |last3=Tumblin |year=2006 |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}</ref> In this way motion deblurring becomes a [[well-conditioned problem]]. Similarly, in a lens based coded aperture, the aperture can be modified by inserting a [[broadband mask]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.media.mit.edu/~raskar/Mask/ |title=Dappled Photography: Mask Enhanced Cameras for Heterodyned Light Fields and Coded Aperture Refocusing |first1=Ashok |last1=Veeraraghavan |first2=Ramesh |last2=Raskar |first3=Amit |last3=Agrawal |first4=Ankit |last4=Mohan |first5=Jack |last5=Tumblin |year=2007 |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}</ref> Thus, out of focus deblurring becomes a [[well-conditioned problem]]. The coded aperture can also improve the quality in light field acquisition using Hadamard transform optics. ==Computational processing== Processing of non-optically coded images to produce new images. ==Computational sensors== Detectors that combine sensing and processing, typically in hardware. ==Early work in computer vision== Although computational photography is a currently popular buzzword in computer graphics, many of its techniques first appeared in the computer vision literature, either under other names or within papers aimed at 3D shape analysis. ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.amazon.com/dp/1568813139/ ''Computational Photography'' (Raskar, R., Tumblin, J.,)], A.K.

It is often regarded as a subdiscipline of [[theoretical physics]] but some consider it an intermediate branch between theoretical and [[experimental physics]]. [[Physicist]]s often have a very precise mathematical theory describing how a system will behave. Unfortunately, it is often the case that solving the theory's equations [[ab initio]] in order to produce a useful prediction is not practical. This is especially true with [[quantum mechanics]], where only a handful of simple models admit closed-form, analytic solutions. In cases where the equations can only be solved approximately, computational methods are often used. == Applications of computational physics == Computation now represents an essential component of modern research in [[accelerator physics]], [[astrophysics]], [[fluid mechanics]], [[lattice field theory]]/[[lattice gauge theory]] (especially [[lattice QCD|lattice quantum chromodynamics]]), [[plasma physics]] (see [[plasma modeling]]), [[solid state physics]] and [[soft condensed matter]] physics. Computational solid state physics, for example, uses [[density functional theory]] to calculate properties of solids, a method similar to that used by chemists to study molecules. Many other more general numerical problems fall loosely under the domain of computational physics, although they could easily be considered{{by whom|date=November 2010}} pure [[mathematics]] or part of any number of applied areas. These include * Solving [[differential equation]]s * Evaluating [[integral]]s * Stochastic methods, especially [[Monte Carlo method]]s * Specialized [[partial differential equation]] methods, for example the [[finite difference]] method and the [[finite element method]] * The [[matrix eigenvalue problem]] &ndash; the problem of finding [[eigenvalue]]s of very large matrices, and their corresponding [[eigenvectors]] ([[eigenstates]] in [[quantum physics]]) * The [[pseudo-spectral method]] All these methods (and several others) are used to calculate physical properties of the modeled systems. Computational Physics also encompasses the tuning of the software/hardware structure to solve the problems (as the problems usually can be very large, in processing power need or in memory requests). ==See also== * [[Molecular dynamics]] * [[Computational fluid dynamics]] * [[Computational Magnetohydrodynamics]] * [[DCOMP]] Division of Computational Physics of the American Physical Society * [[List of publications in physics#Computational physics|Important publications in computational physics]] * [[Scientific computing|Computational Science]] * [[Mathematical physics]] * [[Open Source Physics]], computational physics libraries and pedagogical tools * [[Plasma modeling]] == External links == * [http://www.aps.org/units/dcomp/index.cfm APS DCOMP] * [http://www.iop.org/activity/groups/subject/comp/index.html IoP CPG (UK)] * [http://www.scidac.gov/physics/physics.html SciDAC: Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing] * [http://www.compadre.org/OSP/ Open Source Physics] * [http://www.obacs.com SCINET Scientific Software Framework] {{DEFAULTSORT:Computational Physics}} [[Category:Computational physics| ]] [[ar:فيزياء حاسوبية]] [[de:Computerphysik]] [[es:Física computacional]] [[fa:فیزیک محاسباتی]] [[fr:Physique numérique]] [[ko:계산물리학]] [[it:Fisica computazionale]] [[ja:計算物理学]] [[pl:Fizyka komputerowa]] [[pt:Física computacional]] [[sk:Počítačová fyzika]] [[fi:Laskennallinen fysiikka]] [[sv:Beräkningsfysik]] [[tr:Hesaplamalı fizik]] [[zh:计算物理学]]</text> </page> <page> <id>7447</id> <title>Computational theory of
