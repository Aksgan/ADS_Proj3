The robot has 28 [[degrees of freedom (engineering)|degrees of freedom]] and was provided cameras for eyes. ''Don Cuco'' is capable of reading [[musical score]]s and play the music on a [[piano]]. To perform such tasks the robot required the application of [[frame grabbing]], [[image processing]], [[pattern recognition]] and interpretation or [[analysis of scene]]. The design team of 30 faculty 20 students at UAP consisted of [[physicist]]s, [[physician]]s, [[electronic engineering|electronic engineer]]s, [[computer scientist]]s, [[musician]]s and designers who worked 20 hours daily for six months to complete the project. The brains of the robot are based on the [[ILA 9200]] microprocessor design in 1985 by scientists and engineers of [[Argentina]], [[Brasil]], [[Colombia]], [[Spain]] and Mexico. The [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU) was designed at the department of microelectronics of the UAP. The robot has been presented and has performed in Mexico, Spain and [[Latin America]] before millions of people. ==External links== *{{es icon}} [http://www.doncuco.buap.mx/ Official site] at the [[Universidad Autónoma de Puebla]]. *[http://gsd.ime.usp.br/sbcm/1995/papers/A_Pedroza.html Abstract of ''Musical Score Recognition of "Don Cuco El Guapo" Pianist Robot''].

He is also known for his "[[TV Typewriter]]" dumb terminal project, his book on technical entrepreneurship ''The Incredible Secret Money Machine,'' and his work on and advocacy of early [[print-on-demand]] technology. Lancaster's print-on-demand technique, with which he self-published several books, employed hand-tuned [[PostScript]] code sent to a [[laser printer]] through the game port of an [[Apple II]] rather than, as was common at the time, a [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] running [[PageMaker]]. He helped design and manufacture the Apple I keyboard. He held a radio amateur license (K3BYG) for a short time. He sells electronic surplus on Ebay and participates regularly in the Ebay seller's forums. ==Bibliography== * ''TTL Cookbook'' (Macmillan, May 1974).
