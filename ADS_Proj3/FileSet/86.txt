possible and consistent plans or goals must be considered. Kautz<ref>H. Kautz. "A formal theory of plan recognition". In PhD thesis, University of Rochester, 1987.</ref> provided a formal theory of plan recognition. He described plan recognition as a logical inference process of circumscription. All actions, plans are uniformly referred to as goals, and a recognizer's knowledge is represented by a set of first-order statements called event hierarchy encoded in first-order logic, which defines abstraction, decomposition and functional relationships between types of events. Kautz's general framework for plan recognition has an exponential time complexity in worst case, measured in the size of input hierarchy. Lesh and Etzioni<ref>N. Lesh and O. Etzioni. "A sound and fast goal recognizer". In ''Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence'', 1995.</ref> went one step further and presented methods in scaling up goal recognition to scale up his work computationally. In contrast to Kautz's approach where the plan library is explicitly represented, Lesh and Etzioni's approach enables automatic plan-library construction from domain primitives. Furthermore, they introduced compact representations and efficient algorithms for goal recognition on large plan libraries. Inconsistent plans and goals are repeatedly pruned when new actions arrive. Besides, they also presented methods for adapting a goal recognizer to handle individual idiosyncratic behavior given a sample of an individual's recent behavior. Pollack et al. described a direct argumentation model that can know about the relative strength of several kinds of arguments for belief and intention description. A serious problem of logic-based approaches is their inability or inherent infeasibility to represent uncertainty. They offer no mechanism for preferring one consistent approach to another and incapable of deciding whether one particular plan is more likely than another, as long as both of them can be consistent enough to explain the actions observed. There is also a lack of learning ability associated with logic based methods. ===Activity recognition through probabilistic reasoning=== Probability theory and statistical learning models are more recently applied in activity recognition to reason about actions, plans and goals. Plan recognition can be done as a process of reasoning under uncertainty, which is convincingly argued by Charniak and Goldman.<ref>E. Charniak and R.P. Goldman. "A Bayesian model of plan recognition". ''Artificial Intelligence'', 64:53–79, 1993.</ref> They argued that any model that does not incorporate some theory of uncertainty reasoning cannot be adequate. In the literature, there have been several approaches which explicitly represent uncertainty in reasoning about an agent's plans and goals. Using sensor data as input, Hodges and Pollack designed machine learning-based systems for identifying individuals as they perform routine daily activities such as making coffee.<ref>M.R. Hodges and M.E. Pollack. "An 'object-use fingerprint': The use of electronic sensors for human identification". In ''Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing'', 2007.</ref> Intel Research (Seattle) Lab and University of Washington at Seattle have done some important works on using sensors to detect human plans.<ref>Mike Perkowitz, Matthai Philipose, Donald J.

These uncertainties are modeled using a dynamic [[Bayesian network]] model by Yin et al.<ref>Jie Yin, Xiaoyong Chai and Qiang Yang, "High-level Goal Recognition in a Wireless LAN". In ''Proceedings of the Nineteenth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence'' (AAAI-04), San Jose, CA USA, July 2004. Pages 578-584</ref> A multiple goal model that can reason about user's interleaving goals is presented by Chai and Yang,<ref>Xiaoyong Chai and Qiang Yang, "Multiple-Goal Recognition From Low-level Signals". ''Proceedings of the Twentieth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence'' (AAAI 2005), Pittsburg, PA USA, July 2005. Pages 3-8.</ref> where a [[deterministic]] state transition model is applied. A better model that models the concurrent and interleaving activities in a probabilistic approach is proposed by Hu and Yang.<ref>Derek Hao Hu, Qiang Yang. "CIGAR: Concurrent and Interleaving Goal and Activity Recognition", to appear in AAAI 2008</ref> A user action discovery model is presented by Yin et al.,<ref>Jie Yin, Dou Shen, Qiang Yang and Ze-nian Li "Activity Recognition through Goal-Based Segmentation". ''Proceedings of the Twentieth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence'' (AAAI 2005), Pittsburg, PA USA, July 2005. Pages 28-33.</ref> where the Wi-Fi signals are segmented to produce possible actions. A fundamental problem in Wi-Fi-based activity recognition is to estimate the user locations. Two important issues are how to reduce the human labelling effort and how to cope with the changing signal profiles when the environment changes. Yin et al.<ref>Jie Yin, Qiang Yang and Lionel Ni.
