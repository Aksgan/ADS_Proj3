They are: #the shop floor or {{nihongo|[[gemba]]|現場}}. #the actual product or genbutsu. #the real facts and data or {{nihongo|genjitsu|現実}}. As part of the Toyota philosophy, [[Genchi Genbutsu|genchi genbutsu]] means "go to the actual place and see the actual thing" or "go see" for short. The philosophy of going to the source to confirm at the actual place (genchi or gemba) is a core element of Toyota's continuous improvement.

Some of the more well-known CGE models solved using GEMPACK<ref>Harrison, W.J. and K.R. Pearson (1996), 'Computing Solutions for Large General Equilibrium Models Using GEMPACK', Computational Economics, vol. 9, pp.83-127.</ref> are the [[GTAP]] model of world trade, and the MONASH, MMRF, ORANI-G and TERM models used at CoPS. All these models share a distinctive feature: they are formulated as a system of differential equations in percentage change form; however, this is not required by GEMPACK. ==Main features== A characteristic feature of CGE models is that an initial solution for the model can be readily constructed from a table of transaction values (such as an [[input-output analysis|input-output table]] or a [[social accounting matrix]]) that satisfies certain basic accounting restrictions. GEMPACK builds on this feature by formulating the CGE model as an [[initial value problem]] which is solved using standard techniques. The GEMPACK user specifies her model by constructing a text file listing model equations and variables, and showing how variables relate to value flows stored on an initial data file. GEMPACK translates this file into a computer program which solves the model, ie., computes how model variables might change in response to an external shock. The original equation system is linearized (reformulated as a system of [[first-order partial differential equation]]s). If most variables are expressed in terms of percentage changes (akin to [[Logarithmic derivative|log changes]]) the coefficients of the linearized system are usually very simple functions of database value flows. Computer algebra is used at this point to greatly reduce (by substitution) the size of the system. Then it is solved by multistep methods such as the [[Euler method]], [[midpoint method]] or Gragg's modified Midpoint method. These all require solution of a large [[system of linear equations]]; accomplished by [[sparse matrix]] techniques. [[Richardson extrapolation]] is used to improve accuracy. The final result is an accurate solution of the original non-linear equations. This linearized approach, originally devised to solve medium-sized CGE models on early computers, has since proved capable (on modern computers) of solving very large models. Additionally it has lent itself to some interesting extensions, such as: a [[Gaussian quadrature]] method<ref> DeVuyst, E.A. and P.V. Preckel (1997), 'Sensitivity Analysis Revisited: A Quadrature-Based Approach', Journal of Policy Modelling, 19(2) pp.175 -185.</ref> of estimating confidence intervals for model results from known distributions of shock or parameter values; a way to formulate inequality constraints or non-differentiable equations as [[Linear complementarity problem |complementarities]]<ref>Harrison, W.J., J.M. Horridge, K.R. Pearson and G. Wittwer (2004), "A Practical Method for Explicitly Modeling Quotas and Other Complementarities", Computational Economics, June 2004, Vol. 23(4), pp. 325-341.</ref>; and a technique<ref>Harrison, W.J., J.M. Horridge and K.R. Pearson (2000), "Decomposing Simulation Results with respect to Exogenous Shocks", Computational Economics, Vol 15(3), pp. 227-249.</ref> to decompose changes in model variables due to several shocks into components due to each individual shock. The underlying numerical approach is complemented by several [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] programs that: ease viewing of large multidimensional arrays often found in CGE databases; manage complex (e.g., multi-period) simulations; and allow interactive exploration and explanation of simulation results. ==See also== * [[RunGEM]]: a freeware solving component for Gempack * [[General Algebraic Modeling System|GAMS]]: another modeling system often used to solve CGE models. ==References== <references/> ==External links== * {{Official|http://www.monash.edu.au/policy/gempack.htm}} {{Computer algebra systems}} [[Category:Computer algebra systems]] [[Category:General equilibrium and disequilibrium]]</text> </page> <page> <id>14883</id> <title>Gemstone (database)</title> <text>{{Advert|date=October 2010}} {{Cleanup|date=January 2008}} {{Infobox programming language |name = GemStone Database Management System |paradigm = [[Application framework]] |year = 1991 |typing = |designer = |implementations = |dialects = |influenced_by = [[Smalltalk]], [[Object-oriented programming]] |influenced = [[Java EE]] }} '''GemStone''' is a proprietary [[application framework]] that was first available for [[Smalltalk]] as an [[object database]]. GemStone Systems was founded in 1982 as Servio Logic, and then became GemStone Systems, Inc in 1995. GemStone developed its first prototype in 1982, and shipped its first product in 1986. The engineering group resides in [[Beaverton, Oregon]]. Three of the original co-founding engineers, Bob Bretl, Allen Otis and Monty Williams, have been with the company since its inception. GemStone's owners pioneered implementing [[distributed computing]] in business systems{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}. Many information system features now associated with [[Java EE]] were implemented earlier in GemStone. GemStone and VisualWave were an early [[web application]] server platform (VisualWave and [[VisualWorks]] are now owned by [[Cincom]].) GemStone played an important sponsorship role in the Smalltalk Industry Council at the time when [[IBM]] was backing VisualAge Smalltalk (VA is now at [http://www.instantiations.com Instantiations]). After a major transition, GemStone for Smalltalk continues as "GemStone/S" and various [[C++]] and Java products for scalable, multi-tier [[distributed systems]]. GemStone Systems, Inc. now develops and markets GemFire, which is notable for CEP ([[complex event processing]]), [[Event Stream Processing]], data virtualization and distributed caching. Gemstone builds on the [[Smalltalk programming language]]. Although Gemstone isn't often mentioned in print, GemStone systems serve as mission-critical applications<ref>[http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.smalltalk/msg/9560a50c14522f13 Slovenian national gas operator has its billing system running on Smalltalk for 10 years]</ref> even though many computing industry business publications focus attention on other ecosystems and languages, such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]] or [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] for [[Microsoft .NET]] for new development. GemStone frameworks still see some interest for [[web service]]s and [[service-oriented architecture]]s. A recent revival of interest in Smalltalk has occurred as
