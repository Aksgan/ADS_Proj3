[[AMD]] publicly discloses its set of 64-bit extensions to IA-32, called [[x86-64]] (later branded AMD64). ;2000: IBM ships its first 64-bit [[z/Architecture]] [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]], the [[zSeries]] z900. z/Architecture is a 64-bit version of the 32-bit [[ESA/390]] architecture, a descendant of the 32-bit [[System/360]] architecture. ;2001: Intel finally ships its IA-64 processor line, after repeated delays in getting to market. Now branded [[Itanium]] and targeting high-end servers, sales fail to meet expectations. ;2003: AMD introduces its [[Opteron]] and [[Athlon 64]] processor lines, based on its AMD64 architecture which is the first x86-based 64-bit processor architecture. [[Apple Computer|Apple]] also ships the 64-bit "G5" [[PowerPC 970]] CPU produced by IBM. Intel maintains that its Itanium chips would remain its only 64-bit processors. ;2004: Intel, reacting to the market success of AMD, admits it has been developing a clone of the AMD64 extensions named IA-32e (later renamed EM64T, then yet again renamed to Intel 64). Intel ships updated versions of its [[Xeon]] and [[Pentium 4]] processor families supporting the new 64-bit instruction set. :[[VIA Technologies]] announces the [[VIA Isaiah|Isaiah]] 64-bit processor.<ref>{{cite web | title = VIA Unveils Details of Next-Generation Isaiah Processor Core | publisher = VIA Technologies, Inc. | url = http://www.via.com.tw/en/resources/pressroom/2004_archive/pr041005_fpf-isaiah.jsp | accessdate = 2007-07-18 }}</ref> ;2006: Sony, IBM, and Toshiba begin manufacturing of the 64-bit [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell processor]] for use in the [[PlayStation 3]], servers, workstations, and other appliances. ==64-bit operating system timeline== ;1985: [[Cray]] releases [[UNICOS]], the first 64-bit implementation of the [[Unix]] operating system.<ref>{{cite web|author=Stefan Berka |url=http://www.operating-system.org/betriebssystem/_english/bs-unicos.htm |title=Unicos Operating System |publisher=www.operating-system.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}</ref> ;1993: DEC releases the 64-bit [[OSF/1|DEC OSF/1 AXP]] [[Unix-like]] operating system (later renamed Tru64 UNIX) for its systems based on the [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] architecture. ;1995: DEC releases [[OpenVMS]] 7.0, the first full 64-bit version of OpenVMS for Alpha. ;1996: Support for the [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] [[R4000]] processor is added by [[Silicon Graphics]] to the [[IRIX]] [[operating system]] in release 6.2. ;1998: Sun releases [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris 7]], with full 64-bit [[UltraSPARC]] support. ;2000: IBM releases [[z/OS]], a 64-bit operating system descended from [[MVS]], for the new [[zSeries]] 64-bit mainframes; 64-bit [[Linux on zSeries]] follows the CPU release almost immediately. ;2001: [[NetBSD]] is the first operating system to run on the Intel Itanium processor at the processor's release. Further, Microsoft releases [[Windows XP 64-Bit Edition]], also for the Itanium's IA-64 architecture, although it was able to run [[32-bit application]]s through an execution layer. ;2003: Apple releases its [[Mac OS X 10.3]] "Panther" operating system which adds support for native 64-bit integer arithmetic on [[PowerPC 970]] processors.<ref name="ars-macosx">{{cite web|title=Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard: the Ars Technica review|url=http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2009/08/mac-os-x-10-6.ars/5|page=5|author=[[John Siracusa]]|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=2009-09-06}}</ref> Several [[Linux]] [[Linux distribution|distributions]] release with support for [[AMD64]].

On April 29, Apple releases [[Mac OS X 10.4]] "Tiger" which provides limited support for 64-bit command-line applications on machines with PowerPC 970 processors; later versions for Intel-based Macs supported 64-bit command-line applications on Macs with EM64T processors. On April 30, Microsoft releases [[Windows XP Professional x64 Edition]] for AMD64 and EM64T processors. ;2006: Microsoft releases [[Windows Vista]], including a 64-bit version for AMD64/EM64T processors that retains 32-bit compatibility. In the 64-bit version, all Windows applications and components are 64-bit, although many also have their 32-bit versions included for compatibility with plugins. ;2007: Apple releases [[Mac OS X 10.5]] "Leopard", which fully supports 64-bit applications on machines with PowerPC 970 or EM64T processors. ;2009: Apple releases [[Mac OS X 10.6]], "Snow Leopard," which is shipped with a 64-bit kernel for AMD64/Intel64 processors, although only certain recent models of Apple computers will run the 64-bit kernel by default. Most applications bundled with Mac OS X 10.6 are now also 64-bit.<ref name="ars-macosx"/> Microsoft releases [[Windows 7]], which, like Windows Vista, includes a full 64-bit version for AMD64/Intel 64 processors; most new computers are loaded by default with a 64-bit version. It also releases [[Windows Server 2008 R2]], which is the first 64-bit only operating system released by Microsoft. ==32- vs 64-bit== A change from a [[32-bit]] to a 64-bit architecture is a fundamental alteration, as most [[operating system]]s must be extensively modified to take advantage of the new architecture.{{Why?|date=November 2010}} Other
