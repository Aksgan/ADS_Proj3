played her – the black clubs, the gays, the straight – and very few records have that appeal. [...] However, she was unhappy with the whole damn thing, so I went in and sweetened up a lot of music for her, adding some guitars to 'Lucky Star', some voices, some magic. [...] I just wanted to do the best job I could do for her. When we would playback 'Holiday' or 'Lucky Star', you could see that she was overwhelmed by how great it all sounded. You wanted to help her, you know? As much as she could be a bitch, when you were in groove with her, it was very cool, very creative.|source=—John "Jellybean" Benitez talking about Madonna and the album.<ref name="rikky10"/><ref name="tara2">{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=77}}</ref> }} For the album, Madonna opted not to work with either Kamins or Bray, but chose [[Reggie Lucas]], a Warner Bros. producer. Bray decided to push her in the musical direction of [[pop music|pop]], and recorded the song "[[Burning Up]]" with her.<ref name="rikky10">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=10}}</ref> However, Madonna still did not have enough material to warrant a full album. The songs available were, "[[Lucky Star (song)|Lucky Star]]", a new version of "Ain't No Big Deal", "Think of Me" and "I Know It". Lucas brought another two songs to the project, "Physical Attraction" and "[[Borderline (song)|Borderline]]".<ref name="rikky10"/> As he recorded the tracks he deviated considerably from the original versions of the demos. One such altered song was "Lucky Star". The song was written by Madonna for Kamins, who previously promised to play the track at Danceteria.<ref name="cross1"/> However, the track was instead used by Madonna for the album, which she planned to call ''Lucky Star''.<ref name="cross1"/> She believed that "Lucky Star", along with "Borderline", were the perfect foundation for her album. Problems arose between her and Lucas during the recording of the songs. Madonna was unhappy with the way the final versions turned out. According to her, Lucas used too many instruments and did not consider her ideas for the songs.<ref name="tara1">{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=76}}</ref> This led to a dispute between the two and, after finishing the album, Lucas left the project without tailoring the songs to Madonna's specifications; hence she called [[John Benitez|John "Jellybean" Benitez]], a DJ at Funhouse disco, to remix the available tracks.<ref name="rikky10"/> In the meantime, due to a conflict of interest, Bray had sold "Ain't No Big Deal" to an act on another label, rendering it unavailable for Madonna's project.<ref name="rikky10"/> It was Benitez who discovered a new song, written by Curtis Hudson and [[Paizo Publishing|Lisa Stevens]] of the pop group Pure Energy.<ref name="cross1">{{harvnb|Cross|2007|p=26}}</ref> The song, titled "[[Holiday (Madonna song)|Holiday]]", had been turned down by [[Phyllis Hyman]] and [[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]], formerly of [[The Supremes]].<ref name="morton1">{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=158}}</ref> After vocals were recorded by Madonna, Benitez spent four days trying to enhance the commercial appeal of the track before the April 1983 deadline.<ref name="morton1"/><ref name="rikky10"/> Just before it was completed Madonna and Benitez took the tape over to their friend Fred Zarr's apartment in Brooklyn.<ref name="morton1"/> Zarr added a piano solo in the intermediate section of the track.<ref name="cross1"/> ==Composition== {{listen | title = "Borderline" | filename = BorderlineSample.ogg | description = A 30 second sample of "Borderline" with Madonna singing the [[Chorus effect|chorus]], her vocal ranging from F{{music|sharp}}<sub>3</sub> to B<sub>4</sub>, backed by instrumentation of Reggie Lucas. }} The overall sound of ''Madonna'' is dissonant, and is in the form of upbeat synthetic disco, utilising some of the new technology of the time, like the usage of [[LinnDrum|Linn drum machine]], [[Moog Taurus|Moog bass]] and the [[:File:OB-X keyboard.jpg|OB-X synthesizer]]. These equipments have already dated since, consequently the sound of the album comes off as harsh.<ref name="rikky11">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=11}}</ref> Madonna commented on her debut album: "The songs were pretty weak and I went to England during the recordings so I wasn't around... I wasn't in control. [...] I didn't realise how crucial it was for me to break out of the disco mold before I'd already finished the [first] album. I wish I could have got a little more variety there."<ref name="rikky11"/> The album starts with the song "Lucky Star", a medium-paced dance track, beginning with a sparkle of synth [[note]] and is followed by heavy beats of [[electronic drum]] and [[Clapping|handclaps]].<ref name="rikky11"/> A guitar is played in high [[Ostinato|riff]] and a bubbling [[bass (sound)|bass]] synth is produced to accompany the guitar sound.<ref name="rikky11"/> The song revolves around the "Starlight, starbright" [[hook (music)|hook]] for more than a minute, before going to the [[chorus effect|chorus]]. According to author Rikky Rooksby, the lyrics are repetitive and inane, revolving around the transparent ambiguity of the stars, and juxtaposition of the male character with being a heavenly body in the sky.<ref name="rikky11"/> "Borderline" is a sentimental track, talking about a love that is never quite fulfilled.<ref name="tara2"/> According to author Santiago Fouz-Hernández and his book ''Madonna's drowned worlds'', the lyrics of the song like "Something in way you love me won't let me be/I don't want to be your prisoner so baby won't you set me free" depicted a rebellion against male chauvinism.<ref name="fouz">{{harvnb|Fouz-Hernández|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=67}}</ref> Madonna used a refined and expressive voice to sing the song, backed by Lucas's instrumentations.<ref name="tara2"/> [[bass (instrument)|Bass]] player Anthony Jackson provided the synths for the song.<ref name="rikky11"/> The chords in the song were inspired by Seventies disco sound in Philadelphia as well as [[Elton John]]'s musical style during the mid-seventies.<ref name="rikky11"/> The chord sequences cite from [[Bachman–Turner Overdrive]]'s song "[[You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet]]" while the synth phases display her typical musical style.<ref name="rikky12">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=12}}</ref> The third track "Burning Up" has a starker arrangement, brought about by bass, [[Guitar|single guitar]] and [[drum machine]].<ref name="rikky12"/> The [[tom-tom drum]] beats used in the song were reminiscent to the records of singer [[Phil Collins]].<ref name="rikky12"/> It also incorporated electric guitars and the most state-of-the-art synthesizers of that time.<ref name="slant"/> The chorus is a repetition of the same three lines, while the [[Bridge (music)|bridge]] consists of a series of double entendres; the lyrics describing what Madonna is prepared to do for her lover, and that she is individualistic
