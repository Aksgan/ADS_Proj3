criteria. [[GPS tracking]] and [[GSM localization]] can be used to obtain the actual position of the travelling customer. ==Geo marketing software== [[Geolocation software]] is used to display data that can be linked to a geographic region or area. It can be used to: * Recommend nearby social events<ref name = "qr10"/>. * Determine where the customers are (on country, city, street or user level). * Determine who the customer is (on organisation or user level), or make a guess on it based on earlier encounters by tracking [[IP address]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ipinfodb.com/ip_location_api.php|publisher=IPInfoDB|author=IPInfoDB|title=IP location XML API|date=2010-04-18|accessdate=2010-04-18}}</ref>, credit card information, VOIP address, etc. * Visualize any data in a geographic context by linking it to a digital map. * Locate a web client's computer on a digital map. * Calculate summary information for specific areas. * Select customers within specific areas. * Select customers with a certain radius of a point. * Using micro-geographic segmentation select customers similar to a specific type in the rest of the country. Some of the software used includes MapInfo, ArcGIS (ESRI), RegioGraph (GfK), assorted open source like Mapwindow, DIVA (which while normally used for bio-diversity creates very visually pleasing density maps), GRASS (which works in Linux and Windows environments). Several other software are available. Indeed Google Earth provides an excellent set of images that are always useful. ==Some Applications for Geo== ===Different content by choice=== A typical example for different [[web content]] by choice in geo marketing and [[geo targeting]] is the FedEx website at FedEx.com where users have the choice to select their country location first and are then presented with different site or article content depending on their selection. ===Automated different content=== With automated different content in [[internet marketing]] and geomarketing the delivery of different content based on the geographical [[geolocation]] and other personal information is automated. ===Other=== * Solve problems regarding location of a new [[retail]] outlet * Map consumer demand trends to best distribute products and advertising. This links with trade zone management. * Scope digital advertising towards individual consumers. * Research consumer shopping patterns and observe traffic within shopping centers and between retail outlets. It also helps in visualisation of market research findings and help improve the overall planning ability of organisations. * Improve customer cooperation. ==See also== *[[Article marketing]] *[[Claritas Prizm]] *[[Content (media and publishing)]] *[[Digital marketing]] *[[GPS tracking]] *[[GSM localization]] *[[Internet marketing]] *[[Local advertising]] *[[Location-based service]] *[[Media transparency]] *[[Pricing]] *[[Targeted advertising]] *[[Variable pricing]] *[[Yield management]] *[[Web content]] <ref>http://www.amcham-egypt.org/publications/BusinessMonthly/December%2007/coverstory.asp</ref> ==References== {{reflist}} == External links == * [http://www.facebook.com/pages/Geomarketing/130611066973430?ref=ts The first Geomarketing community page on facebook] * [http://www.wired.com/news/infostructure/0,1377,64178,00.html Wired about Geolocation, dividing markets, price settings and privacy] * [http://www.geoapplab.com GeoAppLab: Geolocation marketing news and tips] {{Human geography}} [[Category:Electronic commerce]] [[Category:Marketing]] [[Category:International trade]] [[Category:Competition]] [[Category:Privacy]] [[Category:Network addressing]] [[Category:Business software]] [[Category:Geomarketing research]] [[de:Geomarketing]] [[es:Geomarketing]] [[fr:Géomarketing]] [[it:Geomarketing]] [[hu:Geomarketing]] [[nl:Geomarketing]] [[ja:ジオマーケティング]] [[pt:Geomarketing]] [[ru:Геомаркетинг]]</text> </page> <page> <id>15103</id> <title>Geoff Peterson</title> <text>{{Original research|date=January 2011}} {{infobox robot | name = Geoff Peterson | image = | imsize = | alt = | caption = | manufacturer = [[Grant Imahara]] | year_of_creation = 2010 | derived_from = | replaced_by = }} '''Geoff Peterson''' is the robot skeleton sidekick for ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'' on [[CBS]]. His debut appearance was on Monday, April 5, 2010. Geoff Peterson was designed and built by [[Grant Imahara]] of the [[Discovery Channel]] show ''[[Mythbusters]]''.<ref name="Myth Busters">{{cite web| url= http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/mythbusters/projects/4350887| title=Craig Ferguson's New Mythbuster Robot Sidekick: Exclusive Pics| date=2010-04-02| publisher= [[Popular Mechanics]]| accessdate=2010-07-29}}</ref> He has blue eyes, a metal [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]] and wears an over-sized brown suit. He also wears a [[Price is Right]] name tag that reads "Geoff", and a [[Comicon]] 2010 button on a lanyard. ==History== The idea of Geoff Peterson came from [[Craig Ferguson]]'s comedic complaining that his show suffered due to its lack of a band or sidekick. (He even used to talk to his "non-existent-sidekick" and then reply to himself, i.e. "Isn't that right non-existent-sidekick? That's right Craig".) This coupled with an expressed desire to have his own "[[Robot Skeleton Army]]", a reference to the cybernetic creatures from the ''[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]'' series of movies and the name of his legion of [[Twitter]] followers, led to the creation of a robot sidekick named Geoff, designed by Imahara. Actress and frequent Late Late Show guest [[Kristin Bell]] consistently expresses hostility towards Geoff, claiming that she had always wanted to be Ferguson's Late Late Show sidekick. This has since become a comical rivalry between the two both on and off the show; e.g. when Geoff was speaking to and interviewing the various stars of the film [[You Again]] at its red carpet premiere, Bell began chiding Peterson, one of the few moments off the Late Late Show where she expresses her disdain towards him. On December 8, 2010 [[Russell Brand]] was a guest on the show, where he jokingly poured water on Geoff and knocked the top of his head off. This made Craig noticeably frustrated but the show continued on anyway. Later on in the show Craig commented to Geoff "You shouldn't have pissed him off!" The episode finished with Craig cradling the top of Geoff's skull in his arms. ==Idea behind Peterson== Peterson is meant to parody the traditional "[[sidekick]]" role such as those played by [[Ed McMahon]], [[Paul Shaffer]], and [[Andy Richter]]. The idea of the "Robot Sidekick" evolved from the fact that [[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)|The Late Late Show]] has a minuscule budget, but also stems from Ferguson's oft-stated aim of deconstructing the conventions of the contemporary late-night chat shows in a surreal and satirical way. ==General Persona== Geoff's collection of pre-recorded comments are voiced noticeably sarcastically. The idea behind the comments is to add to [[Craig Ferguson]]'s comedic style of [[self-deprecation]]. ==Features== Peterson's mouth moves when he talks. His head turns side to side and his right arm can move up and down. Originally, his voice was a loud, obnoxious monotone with an English accent, voiced by Craig Ferguson, but this was changed after the first week. Now his voice sounds similar to that of [[George
