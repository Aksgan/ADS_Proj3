AMD has said that the ACP and TDP values of the processors will co-exist, and do not replace one another. All server products will see two power figures starting from the codenamed ''Barcelona'' server processor onwards. ==ACP compared to TDP== *40 Watt ACP - 60 Watt [[Thermal design power|TDP]]<ref>John Fruehe.

Avizo is developed by '''VSG - Visualization Sciences Group''' and was originally designed and developed by the Visualization and Data Analysis Group at Zuse-Institute Berlin (ZIB) under the name amira. Avizo was commercially released in November 2007. == Overview == [[Image:Avizo GUI.jpg|240px|thumbnail|right|Avizo Graphical user interface]] [[Image:Avizo-fire GUI.png|240px|thumbnail|right|Metallic foam quantification]] [[Image:3dReconstruct Mechanical Part.png|240px|thumbnail|right|3D image-based meshing for CFD/FEA analysis of a mechanical part]] [[Image:Avizo-earth GUI.jpg|240px|thumbnail|right|Geosciences data visualization]] Avizo is a [[software application]] which enables users to perform [[interactive visualization]] and computation on 3D data sets. The Avizo interface is modelled on the [[visual programming]]. Users manipulate data and module components, organized in an interactive graph representation (called Pool), or in a [[Tree view]]. Data and modules can be interactively connected together, and controlled with several parameters, creating a visual processing network whose output is displayed in a 3D viewer. With this interface, complex data can be interactively explored and analyzed by applying a controlled sequence of computation and display processes resulting into a meaningful visual representation and associated derived data. == Features== '''Data Import: ''' *2D and 3D image stack and volume data (acquired by a [[3D scanner]], [[optical microscope|light microscope]], [[electron microscope]]<ref>TOPOLOGY OF SPHEROIDIZED PEARLITE, by Yoshitaka Adachi (1) and Yuan Tsung Wang (1) - (1) National Institute for Materials Science, Tsukuba, Japan[http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=40&ved=0CEwQFjAJOB4&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.geocities.jp%2Fadachi_yst2%2FPRICM2010_adachi.pdf&rct=j&q=avizo%20fib&ei=S-Q6TYfFE42n8QPArJD6CA&usg=AFQjCNHjPov2daeqcMhCYEw0JzqRRY0hDg&cad=rja]</ref>, [[Focused_ion_beam|FIB]]<ref>FIB SEQUENTIAL SECTIONING AS A TOOL TO UNDERSTAND ENVIRONMENTAL MATERIALS DEGRADATION IN 3D 材料の環境劣化の3 次元的理解のための手法としての FIB シーケンシャルセクショニング法, by S.
