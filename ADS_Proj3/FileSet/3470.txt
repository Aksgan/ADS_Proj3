The term may be used as a [[noun]] or [[adjective]]. Thus, as illustrated, the line AB is the perpendicular to CD through the point B. By definition, a [[line (mathematics)|line]] is infinitely long, and strictly speaking AB and CD in this example represent [[line segment]]s of two infinitely long lines. Hence the line segment AB does not have to intersect line segment CD to be considered perpendicular lines, because if the line segments are extended out to infinity, they would still form congruent adjacent angles. If a line is perpendicular to another as shown, all of the angles created by their intersection are called ''right angles'' (right angles measure [[Pi|&pi;]]/2 [[radian]]s, or 90[[Degree (angle)|°]]). Conversely, any lines that meet to form right angles are perpendicular. In a coordinate plane, perpendicular lines have opposite reciprocal slopes. A horizontal line has slope equal to zero while the slope of a vertical line is described as undefined or sometimes ±infinity. Two lines that are perpendicular would be denoted as AB<math>\perp</math>CD ==Numerical criteria== ===In terms of slopes=== In a [[Cartesian coordinate system]], two straight lines <math>L</math> and <math>M</math> may be described by equations. :<math>L</math> : <math>y = ax + b</math> :<math>M</math> : <math>y = cx + d</math> as long as neither is vertical. Then <math>a</math> and <math>c</math> are the [[slopes]] of the two lines. The lines <math>L</math> and <math>M</math> are perpendicular if and only if the product of their slopes is -1, or if <math>ac=-1</math>. ==Construction of the perpendicular== [[Image:Perpendicular-construction.svg|right|thumb|Construction of the perpendicular (blue) to the line AB through the point P.]] To make the perpendicular to the line AB through the point P using [[compass and straightedge]], proceed as follows (see figure): * Step 1 (red): construct a [[circle]] with center at P to create points A' and B' on the line AB, which are [[equidistant]] from P. * Step 2 (green): construct circles centered at A' and B', both passing through P. Let Q be the other point of intersection of these two circles. * Step 3 (blue): connect P and Q to construct the desired perpendicular PQ. To prove that the PQ is perpendicular to AB, use the [[Congruence (geometry)#Congruence of triangles|SSS congruence theorem]] for triangles QPA' and QPB' to conclude that angles OPA' and OPB' are equal. Then use the [[Congruence (geometry)#Congruence of triangles|SAS congruence theorem]] for triangles OPA' and OPB' to conclude that angles POA and POB are equal. ==In relationship to parallel lines== [[Image:perpendicular transversal v3.svg|right|thumb|200px|Lines ''a'' and ''b'' are parallel, as shown by the tick marks, and are cut by the [[transversal line]] c.]] If two lines (''a'' and ''b'') are both perpendicular to a third line (''c''), all of the angles formed along the third line are right angles. Therefore, in [[Euclidean geometry]], any two lines that are both perpendicular to a third line are parallel to each other, because of the [[parallel postulate]]. Conversely, if one line is perpendicular to a second line, it is also perpendicular to any line parallel to that second line. In the figure at the right, all of the orange-shaded angles are congruent to each other and all of the green-shaded angles are congruent to each other, because [[vertical (angles)|vertical angles]] are congruent and alternate interior angles formed by a transversal cutting parallel lines are congruent. Therefore, if lines ''a'' and ''b'' are parallel, any of the following conclusions leads to all of the others: * One of the angles in the diagram is a right angle. * One of the orange-shaded angles is congruent to one of the green-shaded angles. * Line 'c' is perpendicular to line 'a'. * Line 'c' is perpendicular to line 'b'. ==Finding the perpendiculars of a function== ====Algebra==== In algebra, for any linear equation ''y=mx + b'', the perpendiculars will all have a slope of ''(-1/m)'', the opposite [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the original slope. It is helpful to memorize the slogan "to find the slope of a perpendicular line, flip the fraction and swap the sign." Recall that any integer ''a'' is itself over one, and can be written as ''(a/1)'' To find the perpendicular of a given line which also passes through a particular point (x, y), solve the equation y = (-1/m)x + b, substituting in the known values of m, x, and y to solve for b. ==Perpendicular symbol== The perpendicular symbol is <math>\perp</math> . For example, <math>AB \perp CD</math> indicates that line ''AB'' is perpendicular to line ''CD''. In the [[Unicode]] character set, the perpendicular sign has the ==See also== * [[Orthogonality]] * [[Perpendicular component]] (of a vector) * [[Surface normal]] * [[Parallel (geometry)]] ==External links== *[http://www.mathopenref.com/perpendicular.html Definition: perpendicular] With interactive animation *[http://www.mathopenref.com/constbisectline.html How to draw a perpendicular bisector of a line with compass and straight edge] Animated demonstration *[http://www.mathopenref.com/constperpendray.html How to draw a perpendicular at the endpoint of a ray with compass and straight edge] Animated demonstration [[Category:Geometry]] [[Category:Orientation]] [[ar:عمودي]] [[ast:Perpendicularidá]] [[bg:Перпендикуляр]] [[ca:Perpendicularitat]] [[cs:Kolmice]] [[de:Lot (Mathematik)]] [[es:Perpendicularidad]] [[eo:Perpendikularo]] [[eu:Elkarzut]] [[fr:Perpendicularité]] [[it:Perpendicolarità]] [[he:אנך]] [[ko:수직]] [[lt:Statmuo]] [[nl:Loodrecht (meetkunde)]] [[ja:垂直]] [[pl:Prostopadłość]] [[pt:Perpendicularidade]] [[ro:Perpendicularitate]] [[ru:Перпендикулярность]] [[sk:Kolmica]] [[sl:Pravokotnost]] [[fi:Kohtisuora]] [[sv:Vinkelrät]] [[th:ตั้งฉาก]] [[uk:Перпендикулярність]] [[zh-classical:垂直]] [[zh:垂直]]</text> </page> <page> <id>28882</id> <title>Perry R.
