A function defined as <math>f(x_1, ..., x_n) = ...</math> is linear if and only if each variable appears at most once on either side of the ''='', making <math>f(x) = g(x, y)</math> linear but not <math>f(x) = g(x, x)</math>. A function defined as <math>f(x_1, ..., x_n) = ...</math> is regular if the left hand side and right hand side have exactly the same variables, making <math>f(x, y) = g(y, x)</math> regular but not <math>f(x) = g(x, y)</math> or <math>f(x, y) = g(x)</math>. A grammar in which all composition functions are both linear and regular is called a Linear Context-free Rewriting System (LCFRS), a subset of the GCFGs with strictly less computational power than the GCFGs as a whole, which is weakly equivalent to multicomponent [[Tree adjoining grammar]]s. [[Head grammar]] is an example of an LCFRS that is strictly less powerful than the class of LCFRSs as a whole. ==References== <references/> {{Formal languages and grammars}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Generalized Context-Free Grammar}} [[Category:Formal languages]] [[Category:Grammar frameworks]]</text> </page> <page> <id>14969</id> <title>Generalized entropy index</title> <text>{{context|date=December 2010}} The '''generalized entropy index''' is a [[general formula]] for measuring redundancy in data. The redundancy can be viewed as inequality, lack of diversity, non-randomness, compressibility, or segregation in the data.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} The primary use is for [[Economic inequality|income inequality]].<ref>Ullah, Aman ; Giles, David E. A. (1998) ''Handbook of Applied Economic Statistics'', CRC Press. ISBN 0824701291 {{Page needed|date=December 2010}}</ref> It is equal to the definition of [[Redundancy (information theory)|redundancy in information theory]] that is based on [[Entropy (information theory)|Shannon entropy]] when α = 1 which is also called the [[Theil index]] (T<sub>T</sub>) in income inequality research. Completely "diverse" data has no redundancy so that GE=0, so that it increases in the opposite direction of a [[Diversity index]]. It increases with order rather than disorder, so it is a negated measure of entropy. == Formula == The formula is :<math>GE(\alpha) = \frac{1}{N \alpha ( \alpha - 1 )} \sum_{i=1}^N\left[ \left(\frac{y_i}{\overline{y}} \right)^\alpha - 1 \right], \quad \text{ for real values } \alpha \ne 0,1</math> :<math>GE(\alpha) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N\left[ \frac{y_i}{\overline{y}} \ln\left(\frac{y_i}{\overline{y}} \right)\right], \quad\quad \text{ for } \alpha =1</math> :<math>GE(\alpha) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \ln\left(\frac{\overline{y}}{y_i} \right), \quad \quad\quad \text{ for } \alpha = 0,</math> where <math>y_i</math> is the income for individual i that is part of N and α is the weight given to distances between incomes at different parts of the income distribution. Sometimes a different notation is used where α = β + 1. For lower values of α close to 0, GE is more sensitive to changes in the lower incomes and vice versa for values closer to 1. Theil's ''T<sub>T</sub>'' is α = 1 and Theil's ''T<sub>L</sub>'' (also called mean log deviation) is α = 0. When α = 2 the value is half the square of the [[coefficient of variation]]: :<math>GE(\alpha) = 1/2 (\sigma/\mu)^2 \quad \quad\quad \text{ for } \alpha = 2.</math> The generalized entropy index is a transformation of the [[Atkinson index]] where <math>\epsilon=1-\alpha</math>. The transformation is A=1-e^(-GE), so that the Atkinson index is a probability instead of entropy. When the <math>y_i</math> of <math>\alpha=1</math> is replaced with <math>1/y_i</math> (for example, income/person becomes persons/income) then <math>\alpha=1</math> is equivalent to <math>\alpha=0</math>. == See also == * [[Theil index]] * [[Atkinson index]] * [[Lorenz curve]] * [[Gini coefficent]] * [[Hoover index]] * [[Robin Hood index]] * [[Suits index]] * [[Income inequality metrics]] * [[Renyi entropy]] {{Refimprove|date=November 2010}} ==References== {{Reflist}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Generalized Entropy Index}} [[Category:Econometrics]] [[Category:Information theory]] [[Category:Economic indicators]] [[Category:Index numbers]] [[Category:Summary statistics]]</text> </page> <page> <id>14978</id> <title>Generalized map</title> <text>In mathematics, a '''generalized map''' is a [[topology|topological]] model which allows one to represent and to handle subdivided objects. This model was defined starting from [[combinatorial map]]s in order to represent non-orientable and open subdivisions, which is not possible with combinatorial maps. The main advantage of generalized map is the homogeneity of one-to-one mappings in any dimensions, which simplifies definitions and algorithms comparing to combinatorial maps. For this reason, generalized maps are sometimes used instead of combinatorial maps, even to represent orientable closed partitions. Like combinatorial maps, generalized maps are used as efficient data structure in image representation and processing, in geometrical modeling, they are related to [[simplicial set]] and to [[combinatorial topology]], and this is a [[boundary representation]] model (B-rep or BREP), i.e. it represents object by its boundaries. ==General definition== The definition of generalized map in any dimension is given in <ref>Lienhardt P., Topological models for boundary representation: a comparison with ''n''-dimensional generalized maps, ''Computer-Aided Design'', Vol. 23, no.1, pp. 59&ndash;82, 1991</ref> and <ref>Lienhardt P., ''N''-dimensional generalized combinatorial maps and cellular quasi-manifolds, ''International Journal on Computational Geometry and Applications'', Vol. 4, n° 3, pp. 275&ndash;324, 1994</ref>: A ''n''D generalized map (or ''n''G-map) is an (''n'' + 2)-tuple ''G'' = (''D'', ''α''<sub>0</sub>, ..., ''α''<sub>''n''</sub>) such that: * ''D'' is a finite set of darts; * ''α''<sub>0</sub>, ..., ''α''<sub>''n''</sub> are [[Involution (mathematics)|involutions]] on ''D''; * ''α''<sub>''i''</sub> o ''α''<sub>''j''</sub> is an involution if ''i'' + 2 ≤ ''j'' (''i'', ''j'' ∈ { 0, ,..., ''n'' }). An ''n''D generalized map represents the subdivision of an open or closed orientable or not ''n''D space. ==See also== * [[Boundary representation]] * [[Combinatorial map]] * [[Quad-edge data structure]] * [[Rotation system]] * [[Simplicial set]] * [[Winged edge]] ==References== <references /> [[Category:Algebraic topology]] [[Category:Topological graph theory]] [[Category:Computer graphics data structures|Data structures]] [[fr:Carte généralisée]]</text> </page> <page> <id>14988</id> <title>Generalized taxicab number</title> <text>{{unsolved|mathematics| Does there exist any number that can be expressed as a sum of 2 positive ''5''th powers in at least 2 different ways, i.e., ''a''<sup>5</sup> + ''b''<sup>5</sup> <nowiki>=</nowiki> ''c''<sup>5</sup> + ''d''<sup>5</sup>?}} In [[mathematics]], the '''generalized taxicab number''' ''Taxicab''(''k'', ''j'', ''n'') is the smallest number which can be expressed as the sum of ''j'' ''k''th positive powers in ''n'' different ways.
