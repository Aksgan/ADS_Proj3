sets it intersects. We continually do this until no sets are left, and we have a set packing of some size, although it may not be the maximum set packing. Although no algorithm can always produce results close to the maximum (see next section), on many practical inputs these heuristics do so. The NP-complete [[exact cover]] problem, on the other hand, requires every element to be contained in exactly one of the subsets. Finding such an exact cover at all, regardless of size, is an [[NP-complete]] problem. However, if we create a [[singleton set]] for each element of ''S'' and add these to the list, the resulting problem is about as easy as set packing. Karp originally showed set packing NP-complete via a reduction from the [[clique problem]]. There is a weighted version of the set cover problem in which each subset is assigned a real weight and it is this weight we wish to maximize. In our example above, we might weight the ambassadors according to the populations of their countries, so that our announcement will reach the most people possible. This seems to make the problem harder, but as we explain below, most known results for the general problem apply to the weighted problem as well. == Complexity == The set packing problem is not only NP-complete, but its optimization version (general maximum set packing problem ) has been proven as difficult to approximate as the [[maximum clique problem]]; in particular, it cannot be approximated within any constant factor. The best known algorithm approximates it within a factor of <math>O(\sqrt{|S|})</math>. The weighted variant can also be approximated this well. However, the problem does have a variant which is more tractable: if we assume no subset exceeds ''k''≥3 elements, the answer can be approximated within a factor of ''k''/2 + ε for any ε > 0; in particular, the problem with 3-element sets can be approximated within about 50%. In another more tractable variant, if no element occurs in more than ''k'' of the subsets, the answer can be approximated within a factor of ''k''. This is also true for the weighted version. == See also == * [[Matching (graph theory)|Matching]], [[3-dimensional matching]], and [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]] are special cases of set packing. A maximum-size matching can be found in polynomial time, but finding a largest 3-dimensional matching or a largest independent set is NP-hard. * [[Packing in a hypergraph]]. == Notes == {{reflist}} == References == * "[http://www.nist.gov/dads/HTML/setpacking.html set packing]".

In [[fiction]], '''setting''' includes the [[time]], [[location (geography)|location]], and everything in which a [[storytelling|story]] takes place, and initiates the main [[Theatrical scenery|backdrop]] and [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] for a story. Setting has been referred to as story world <ref>[[#Truby|Truby]], 2007, p. 145</ref> or '''[[Social environment|milieu]]''' to include a [[Context (language use)|context]] (especially [[society]]) beyond the immediate surroundings of the story. Elements of setting may include [[culture]], [[historical period]], [[geography]], and [[hour]]. Along with [[Plot (narrative) | plot]], [[Character (arts) | character]], [[Theme (literature) | theme]], and [[Style (fiction) | style]], setting is considered one of the fundamental components of [[fiction]].<ref>[[#Obstfeld|Obstfeld]], 2002, p. 1, 65, 115, 171.</ref> A setting is the time, place and social environment in which a story takes place. ==Role of setting== Setting is a key role in plot, as in man vs. nature or man vs. society stories. In some stories the setting becomes a character itself. <ref>[[#Rozelle|Rozelle]], 2005, p. 2.</ref> In such roles setting may be considered a [[plot device]] or [[literary device]]. The term "setting" is often used to refer to the social milieu in which the events of a novel occur.<ref>[[#Lodge|Lodge]], 1992, pps. 58-60.</ref> Novelist and novel-writing instructor [[Donna Levin]] has described how this social milieu shapes the characters’ values.<ref>[[#Levin|Levin]], 1992, pps.110-112.</ref> For example, the average citizen of Berkeley in the 1960s had very different attitudes towards authority, money, and pre-marital sex than those of the Antebellum South. ==Types of setting== Settings may take various forms: * [[Alternate history (fiction) | Alternate history]] * [[Campaign setting]] * [[Constructed world]] * [[Dystopia]] *
