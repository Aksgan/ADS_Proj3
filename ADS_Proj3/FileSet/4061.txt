concepts we rely on to give meaning to our lives, from our business models to the cycle of human life, including death itself. Understanding the Singularity will alter our perspective on the significance of our past and the ramifications for our future. To truly understand it inherently changes one's view of life in general and one's particular life. I regard someone who understands the Singularity and who has reflected on its implications for his or her own life as a “singularitarian.”<ref name="Kurzweil 2005"/>}} With the support of [[NASA]], [[Google]] and a broad range of [[technology forecasting|technology forecasters]] and [[technocapitalism|technocapitalists]], the [[Singularity University]] opened in June 2009 at the [[NASA Research Park]] in [[Silicon Valley]] with the goal of preparing the next generation of leaders to address the challenges of [[accelerating change]]. In July 2009, academics and technical experts, some of whom were Singularitarians, participated in a conference organized by the [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence]] (AAAI) to discuss the potential impact of [[robot]]s and computers and the impact of the hypothetical possibility that they could become self-sufficient and able to make their own decisions. They discussed the possibility and the extent to which computers and robots might be able to acquire any level of autonomy, and to what degree they could use such abilities to possibly pose any threat or hazard (i.e. [[cybernetic revolt]]). They noted that some machines have acquired various forms of semi-autonomy, including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons. They warned that some [[computer viruses]] can evade elimination and have achieved "cockroach intelligence." They asserted that self-awareness as depicted in [[science fiction]] is probably unlikely, but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls.<ref name="nytimes july09"> [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/science/26robot.html?_r=1&ref=todayspaper Scientists Worry Machines May Outsmart Man] By JOHN MARKOFF, NY Times, July 26, 2009. </ref> Some experts and academics have questioned the use of [[military robot|robots for military combat]], especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions.<ref> [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8182003.stm Call for debate on killer robots], By Jason Palmer, Science and technology reporter, BBC News, 8/3/09. </ref> The President of the AAAI has commissioned a study to look at this issue.<ref> [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/horvitz/AAAI_Presidential_Panel_2008-2009.htm AAAI Presidential Panel on Long-Term AI Futures 2008-2009 Study], Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, Accessed 7/26/09.</ref> Commenting on Singularity Summit 2010, Patrick Takahashi, director emeritus of the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute, wrote: {{quotation|[I]t was refreshing and invigorating for me to experience unbounded optimism at the Singularity Summit gathering in San Francisco this past weekend. Six hundred geeky, bright and mostly young participants sat in on two days of hope for the future. Many of us are familiar with the term singularity with respect to mathematics and space. However, when applied to humanity, as coined by Vernor Vinge in 1993 and popularized by Ray Kurzweil, exponential advancements in computing and biological sequencing could result in artificial intelligence becoming smarter than humans only in two decades. The overwhelming consensus was that singularity was the solution. This combination of fusion, cloning and artificial genius gifted with humanitarian traits offers not only hope, but certainty that we will not only survive, but thrive.<ref name="Takahashi 2010">{{cite paper| author = Takahashi, Patrick | title = The Singularity Summit 2010 | year = 2010 | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/patrick-takahashi/the-singularity-summit-20_b_685196.html2 | accessdate=2010-12-19}}</ref>}} ==Criticism== Often ridiculing the Singularity as "the [[Rapture]] of the [[Nerd]]s", some critics have dismissed Singularitarianism as [[technological utopianism]] turned into a [[new religious movement]].<ref name="Horgan 2008"/> Science journalist [[John Horgan (American journalist)|John Horgan]] wrote: {{quotation|'''Let's face it.''' The singularity is a religious rather than a scientific vision. The science-fiction writer Ken MacLeod has dubbed it ”the rapture for nerds,” an allusion to the end-time, when Jesus whisks the faithful to heaven and leaves us sinners behind. Such yearning for transcendence, whether spiritual or technological, is all too understandable. Both as individuals and as a species, we face deadly serious problems, including terrorism, nuclear proliferation, overpopulation, poverty, famine, environmental degradation, climate change, resource depletion, and AIDS. Engineers and scientists should be helping us face the world's problems and find solutions to them, rather than indulging in escapist, pseudoscientific fantasies like the singularity.<ref name="Horgan 2008"/>}} David Correia, a professor of [[science and technology studies]] at the University of New Mexico, warns that the interest in the Singularity by corporate and military interests provides a clue as to the direction and social implication of [[transhumanism|transhumanist]] technology: {{quotation|The singularity movement is encouraged and sponsored by a malevolent coterie of military and corporate interests in search of a technotranscendence that serves to reinforce inequality rather than the dream of human transcendence. Those who should be offering skepticism are blinded, it seems, by the truth claims and seemingly self-evident goodness of technoscience. But the singularity movement is far from progressive and the appealing possibility of technosolutions to our most intractable social and environmental issues masks frightening social and ecological implications ... The Singularity does not anticipate human liberation but offers the conditions of permanent capitalist social relations and the bioengineering of bourgeois values. The singularity movement is old-fashioned eugenics with better techniques passing itself off as pragmatic postmodernism.<ref name="Correia 2010"/>}} Alarmed by Singularitarian ambitions, some [[green anarchism|green anarchist]] militants have called for violent [[direct action]] to "stop the Singularity".<ref name="Green Anarchy 2005"/> A contributor to ''[[Green Anarchy]]'', an [[anarcho-primitivism|anti-civilization]] journal of theory and action, wrote: {{quotation|If it is evolutionary for some humans to use intelligence to design and manufacture 'superior' intelligent replacements -- sickening and killing humans alongside other species in the process -- then perhaps they must do their/God's work.

We find all apocalyptic priests and their followers -- bent on destroying us and the rest of the living, breathing 'natural' world -- abominations.
