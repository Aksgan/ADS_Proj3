These questions are framed in a way that if a team is not able to answer these questions and justify their decisions, it can be assumed that the process the team had followed for planning and tracking is considerably different [[Earned value management|Earned Value Analysis]]/[[Burn down chart]] or Burn up charts.<ref>[http://www.controlchaos.com/about/burndown.php]</ref> ==Quantitative Questions== #Can you define where your project is right now and where it should have been? #Was it at the right level of granularity? ##Was the reporting consistent with the level of planning? ##Was it consisitent with the length of the tasks in the iterations? (How frequently do you report the effort? For example, for a task that spans across two days, you might be reporting once instead of two times) ##How was the variance between the planned and earned value? How was it distributed? Consistently above or below? #Can you distinguish between changes requested by the user and changes requested by the team? #Can you distinguish between what was originally planned and what was achieved earned? #Did you use buffers? how did you handle it? did you plan using ideal hours or real hours? #Did you report ideal or did you report real hours? #How do you represent the existence of buffers in your planned value or burn down chart? #How did you accrue value at the end level of the effort? #What did you do with the tasks not completed during the planned iteration? #What did you do with unplanned activities and tasks? #How many times did you change the performance baseline based on the earned value? #Did each iteration start from zero or cumulative hours left or planned? #Who imposed the process in the team? Was it voluntary or monitored and directed by a planning member or team leader? #Comments. ==Qualitative questions== #How did you use the information provided by the technique? #Analyse the qualitative results and prepare a proposal ==Observations== #Should the team be exposed to the plans and estimates? ##School of thoughts - Some support sharing and others don't ##Analyse how people finish work? Based on which, reallocation is done. #The patterns how employees (on whom the estimates are imposed) try to spend time (more or less). ==References== <references/> {{DEFAULTSORT:Tracking Questionnaire}} [[Category:Software project management]]</text> </page> <page> <id>38023</id> <title>Tradigital art</title> <text>{{Refimprove|date=October 2008}} '''Tradigital art''' most commonly refers to [[art]] (including [[animation]]) that combines both traditional and computer-based techniques to implicate an image.<ref>[http://www.wordspy.com/words/tradigital.asp WordSpy entry] for ''tradigital''.</ref> It is related to [[digital art]], [[traditional art]], [[information art]], [[new media art]], [[video art]], [[interactive art]], and [[internet art]]. ==Background== [[Image:Unique.jpg|right|thumb|Unique Editions<br>top, left to right: Bonny Lhotka, Judith Moncrieff;<br>bottom, left to right: Dorothy Krause, Karin Schminke, Helen Golden]] Artist and teacher [[Judith Moncrieff]] first coined the term. In the early 1990s, while an instructor at the [[Pacific Northwest College of Art]], Moncrieff invented and taught a new digital medium called "Tradigital". The school held a competition between Moncrieff's students, who used the medium to electronically combine everything from photographs of costumes to stills from videotapes of performing dancers.<ref>Randy Gragg, "Art students get a crack at 'Nutcracker'," ''Portland Oregonian'', October 25, 1995.</ref><ref name="lisawrayart.com">Lisa Wray, [http://www.lisawrayart.com/index.htm ''Judith Montcrieff, Unique Editions and Tradigital Fine Art''].</ref> Moncrieff also referred to her business entity (formerly "Moncrieff Studios") as "Tradigital Imaging" around the same period. Moncrieff was one of five founding members of the digital art collective called "Unique Editions". These five artists—Helen Golden, Bonny Lhotka, Dorothy Krause<ref>William Zimmer, [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E5DD1339F93BA25751C0A960958260 "ART;A Family and Its Gallery Click on the Future"], ''The New York Times'', February 18, 1996.</ref>, Judith Moncrieff, and Karin Schminke—combined their expertise in traditional studio media and techniques with [[digital imaging]] to produce original fine art and editions. The artists met in June, 1994, at "Beyond the Digital Print", a workshop organized by Krause at [[Massachusetts College of Art and Design]] in Boston. The artists' varied backgrounds are evident in their mixed media approach to using the computer as an art-making tool. Although every image is conceived and executed at least in part on the computer, the range of work includes one of a kind paintings, collages, Polaroid and image transfers, monotypes and prints on such varied substrates as canvas, handmade paper, and embossed metal. Moncrieff used the term "Tradigital media" to describe this merging of traditional and digital tools and "tradigitalism" as a name for this emerging movement. Unique Editions also served as a research and public relations entity for exploring technologies and promoting digital art. The group forged links with hardware and software developers in an effort to provide feedback on their products from the artist's perspective. It served as a demonstration to the rest of the art world of the role of digital technologies in the artist's studio. Unique Editions became inactive in 1997; however, Golden and Moncrieff continued to work together under the name, "Tradigital Fine Art".<ref name="lisawrayart.com"/> Independently in the early 1990s, artist [[Lisa Wray]] was developing the fine art style she calls "Renaissance of Metaphysical Imagery". Prototypes were made for each work from color copies, color photos or film negatives made in her graphic arts darkroom. In 1990, she visited the only two places in the country with proprietary computer systems capable of assembling her prototypes: Raphael Digital Transparencies in Houston Texas, and Dodge Color Laboratories in Washington D.C. The first two prototypes, Brew of Life and Fantasy, were assembled by Dodge Color Laboratories on a Superset machine that was first developed by the Department of Defense. The final art
