Another rigorous 6,500-line formal proof was produced in 2005 by an international team of mathematicians using the [[Mizar system]]. Both the Mizar and the HOL Light proof rely on libraries of previously proved theorems, so these two sizes are not comparable. {{harvs|txt | last1=Sakamoto | first1=Nobuyuki | last2=Yokoyama | first2=Keita | title=The Jordan curve theorem and the Schönflies theorem in weak second-order arithmetic | doi=10.1007/s00153-007-0050-6 | id={{MathSciNet | id = 2321588}} | year=2007 | journal=Archive for Mathematical Logic | issn=0933-5846 | volume=46 | issue=5 | pages=465–480}} showed that the Jordan curve theorem is equivalent in proof-theoretic strength to the [[weak König's lemma]]. == See also == * [[Lakes of Wada]] == Notes == <references/> == References == *{{Citation | doi=10.1216/RMJ-1975-5-2-225 | last1=Berg | first1=Gordon O. | last2=Julian | first2=W. | last3=Mines | first3=R. | last4=Richman | first4=Fred | title=The constructive Jordan curve theorem | id={{MathSciNet | id = 0410701}} | year=1975 | journal=The Rocky Mountain Journal of Mathematics | issn=0035-7596 | volume=5 | pages=225–236}} *{{Citation | last1=Hales | first1=Thomas C. | author1-link=Thomas Callister Hales | title=The Jordan curve theorem, formally and informally | id={{MathSciNet | id = 2363054}} | year=2007a | journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly|The American Mathematical Monthly]] | issn=0002-9890 | volume=114 | issue=10 | pages=882–894}} *{{Citation | last1=Hales | first1=Thomas | author1-link=Thomas Callister Hales | title=Jordan's proof of the Jordan Curve theorem | url=http://mizar.org/trybulec65/4.pdf | year=2007b | journal=Studies in Logic, Grammar and Rhetoric | volume=10 | issue=23}} *{{Citation | last1=Jordan | first1=Camille | author1-link=Camille Jordan |title= Cours d'analyse | url=http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/jordan/jordan.pdf | year=1887|pages=587–594}} *{{Citation | doi=10.2307/2323369 | last1=Maehara | first1=Ryuji | title=The Jordan Curve Theorem Via the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2323369 | publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]] | id={{MR|0769530}} | year=1984 | journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly|The American Mathematical Monthly]] | issn=0002-9890 | volume=91 | issue=10 | pages=641–643}} *{{Citation | last1=Narens | first1=Louis | title=A nonstandard proof of the Jordan curve theorem | url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.pjm/1102971282 | id={{MathSciNet | id = 0276940}} | year=1971 | journal=[[Pacific Journal of Mathematics]] | issn=0030-8730 | volume=36 | pages=219–229}} *{{Citation | last1=Sakamoto | first1=Nobuyuki | last2=Yokoyama | first2=Keita | title=The Jordan curve theorem and the Schönflies theorem in weak second-order arithmetic | doi=10.1007/s00153-007-0050-6 | id={{MathSciNet | id = 2321588}} | year=2007 | journal=Archive for Mathematical Logic | issn=0933-5846 | volume=46 | issue=5 | pages=465–480}} *{{Citation | doi=10.2307/2324180 | last=Thomassen | first=Carsten | author-link=Carsten Thomassen | title=The Jordan–Schönflies theorem and the classification of surfaces | url=http://jstor.org/stable/2324180 |year=1992 | journal=American Mathematical Monthly | volume=99 | issue=2 | pages=116–130}} * {{Citation | last1=Veblen | first1=Oswald | author1-link=Oswald Veblen | title=Theory on Plane Curves in Non-Metrical Analysis Situs | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1986378 | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | location=Providence, R.I. | year=1905 | journal=[[Transactions of the American Mathematical Society]] | issn=0002-9947 | volume=6 | issue=1 | pages=83–98}} == External links == * {{eom|id=j/j054370|author=M.I.

He is known for his development of [[concept map]]ping in the 1970s. == Biography == Joseph Novak received an B.S. in Science and Mathematics in 1952 from the [[University of Minnesota]], an M.S. in Science Education in 1954 from the [[University of Minnesota]], and completed his graduate studies in Science Education & Biology at the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1958. Novak started teaching biology at [[Emporia State University|Kansas State Teachers College at Emporia]] from 1957 to 1959, and biology and teacher education courses at [[Purdue University]] from 1959 to 1967. From 1967 to 1995, he was Professor of Education and Biological sciences at [[Cornell University]]. Since 1998 he is also Visiting Senior Scientist, at the [[University of West Florida]], Institute for Human & Machine Cognition.
