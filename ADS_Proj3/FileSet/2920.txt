was that the Configuration Application Block was removed, and the blocks were updated to use .NET's improved [[Base Class Library|System.Configuration]] capabilities. This release also included significant improvements to the Logging Application Block, and much of the Security Application Block was removed due to similar capabilities provided in .NET Framework 2.0. The .NET 2.0 release of Enterprise Library contained the following Application Blocks: * Caching * Data Access * Cryptography * Exception Handling * Logging * Security ===Version 1.1=== Two releases of Enterprise Library were released for .NET Framework 1.1. The first was released in January 2005, followed by a minor maintenance release in June 2005. The .NET 1.1 releases of Enterprise Library contained the following Application Blocks: * Caching * Configuration * Cryptography * Data Access * Exception Handling * Logging and Instrumentation * Security ===Version 1.0=== == Future == Ron Jacobs, a Microsoft Evangelist, described the purpose of Enterprise Library as "filling in the gaps" of .NET development between releases of the framework. As the framework continues to advance, developers are demanding more productive development libraries. Microsoft continues to promote Enterprise Library for "Enterprise Development", and even many projects within Microsoft IT use it. == See also == * [[Unity Dependency Injection Container]] * [[Composite UI Application Block]] * [[Software factory|Software Factories]] == References and external links == * [http://www.codeplex.com/entlib Enterprise Library on CodePlex] * [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc467894.aspx Enterprise Library on MSDN] {{Microsoft APIs}} [[Category:Microsoft software factories]] [[Category:Enterprise application integration]] [[Category:Service-oriented architecture related products]] [[vi:Microsoft Enterprise Library]]</text> </page> <page> <id>24448</id> <title>Microsoft FUSE Labs</title> <text>'''Microsoft's Future Social Experiences (FUSE) Labs''' was started by [[Ray Ozzie]] and is run by [[Lili Cheng]].
