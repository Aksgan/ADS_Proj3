ONLY place entries here that are links to actual Wikipedia articles about notable social networking sites. External links, redlinks, substubs, non-notable sites or sites that are not social networking sites will be removed. If you have questions, use the talk page. Please try to keep entries in alphabetical order. Adding unnecessary links or text anywhere else will also be removed. Thanks. Please see "WP:WEB" for information on notability for websites on Wikipedia. Editors are encouraged to write the article first (See "WP:WTAF"). Do not even think of putting 'number of users' without providing a recent, CITED number (WITHOUT COMMAS). Wikipedia is an encyclopedia of fact not of guessed numbers, or numbers several years out of date. The number MUST match any number cited in the WP article on the site itself! It is not desirable for the site itself to be given as a source given such numbers may be artificially inflated. Please do not use {{ntsh}}, use {{nts}} with ***NO COMMAS*** for the user counts so they do not mess up sorting. Commas are automatically added. As an example to follow: | | {{nts|1000}} | {{nts|1234}} | {{nts|1000000}} | {{nts|1234567}} Non-numeric user counts should not need {{ntsh}}, as this creates wasted table-data-space, and slowed table-data-sorting, as an example to not follow: | {{ntsh|0}}Unknown | {{ntsh|1000}}Thousands | {{ntsh|1000000}}Millions Please only add a sortable table if it puts e.g. all "millions" above all "thousands". Refer to talk page for consensus on this Also, please make sure the numbers shown on the table are "registered users" not "visitors" When updating Alexa Traffic Ranks, it would be best to update as many Page Ranks as possible on the same day to avoid overlaps that have occurred on previous edits. Do Not Forget to update the retrieval date of the Alexa Traffic Rank citation. --> This is a '''list of''' major active '''[[Social network service|social networking]] [[websites]]''' and excludes dating websites (see [[List of online dating websites]]).
