Loyalists were excluded. The committees became the leaders of the American resistance to British actions, and largely determined the war effort at the state and local level. When the First Continental Congress decided to boycott British products, the colonial and local Committees took charge, examining merchant records and publishing the names of merchants who attempted to defy the boycott by importing British good. They promoted patriotism and home manufacturing, advising Americans to avoid luxuries, and lead a more simple life. The committees gradually extended their power over many aspects of American public life. They set up espionage networks to identify disloyal elements, displaced the royal officials, and helped topple the entire Imperial system in each colony. In late 1774 in early 1775, they supervised the elections of provincial conventions, which took over the actual operation of colonial government.<ref>Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation'' (6th ed. 2001) vol 1 pp 144-145</ref> In response to the ''Massachusetts Government Act'', Massachusetts and other colonies formed local governments called [[Provincial Congress]]es. In 1774, the [[First Continental Congress]] convened, consisting of representatives from each of the Provincial Congresses or their equivalents, to serve as a vehicle for deliberation and collective action. Standing [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committees of Safety]] were created by each Provincial Congress or equivalent for the enforcement of the resolutions by the Committee of Correspondence, Provincial Congress, and the Continental Congress. British colonies in North America that did not have government responsible to its people did not join the Continental Congress, but remained loyal to the Crown. These colonies included [[Quebec]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[History of Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], [[Bermuda]], [[West Florida]] and [[East Florida]]. ==Factions== The population of the Thirteen Colonies was far from homogeneous, particularly in their political views and attitudes. Loyalties and allegiances varied widely not only within regions and communities, but also within families and sometimes shifted during the course of the Revolution. ===King George III=== The war became a personal issue for the king, fueled by his growing belief that British leniency would be taken as weakness by the Americans. The king also sincerely believed he was defending Britain's constitution against usurpers, rather than opposing patriots fighting for their natural rights.<ref>Andrew Jackson O'Shaughnessy, "'If Others Will Not Be Active, I must Drive': George III and the American Revolution." ''Early American Studies'' 2004 2(1): pp 1-46. P. D. G. Thomas, "George III and the American Revolution." ''History'' 1985 70(228): 16-31, says the king played a minor role before 1775.</ref> ===Patriots=== {{Main|Patriot (American Revolution)}} {{See|Sons of Liberty}} At the time, revolutionaries were called "Patriots", "Whigs", "Congress-men", or "Americans". They included a full range of social and economic classes, but were unanimous regarding the need to defend the rights of Americans and uphold the principles of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] in terms of rejecting monarchy and aristocracy, while emphasizing civic virtue on the part of the citizens. ====Role of women==== [[File:Abigail Adams.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Abigail Adams|[[Abigail Adams]]]] {{Main|Women in the American Revolution}} Women contributed to the American Revolution in many ways, and were involved on both sides. While formal Revolutionary politics did not include women, ordinary domestic behaviors became charged with political significance as Patriot women confronted a war that permeated all aspects of political, civil, and domestic life. They participated by boycotting British goods, spying on the British, following armies as they marched, washing, cooking, and tending for soldiers, delivering secret messages, and in a few cases like [[Deborah Samson]] fighting disguised as men. Above all, they continued the agricultural work at home to feed the armies and their families.<ref name="Berkin, 2006 p. 59-60">Berkin, ''Revolutionary Mothers'' (2006) p. 59-60</ref> The boycott of British goods required the willing participation of American women.<ref>Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 41</ref> the boycotted items were largely household items such as tea and cloth. Women had to return to spinning and weaving—skills that had fallen into disuse. In 1769, the women of Boston produced 40,000 skeins of yarn, and 180 women in [[Middletown, Massachusetts]] wove {{convert|20522|yd|m|0}} of cloth.<ref name="Berkin, 2006 p. 59-60"/> A crisis of political loyalties could also disrupt the fabric of colonial America women’s social worlds: whether a man did or did not renounce his allegiance to the King could dissolve ties of class, family, and friendship, isolating women from former connections. A woman’s loyalty to her husband, once a private commitment, could become a political act, especially for women in America committed to men who remained loyal to the King. Legal divorce, usually rare, was granted to Patriot women whose husbands supported the King.<ref>Kerber, ''Women of the Republic'' (1997) chapters 4 and 6</ref><ref>Mary Beth Norton, ''Liberty's Daughters: The Revolutionary Experience of American Women'' (1980)</ref> ====Psychology and class ==== Looking back, John Adams concluded in 1818: :"The Revolution was effected before the war commenced. The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people....This radical change in the principles, opinions, sentiments, and affections of the people was the real American Revolution."<ref>John Ferling, ''Setting the World Ablaze: Washington, Adams, Jefferson, and the American Revolution'' (2002) p. 281</ref> To understand the Patriots historians have examined their hearts and minds, comparing their psychology with that of the [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]]. Historian [[Leonard Woods Labaree]] has identified eight characteristics of the Loyalists that made them essentially conservative; opposite traits characterized the Patriots.<ref name="Labaree, 1948 pp. 164-5">Labaree, ''Conservatism in Early American History'' (1948) pp. 164-5</ref> Loyalists were older, better established, and resisted innovation. They thought resistance to the Crown—which they insisted was the only legitimate government—was morally wrong, while the Patriots thought morality was on their side. Loyalists were alienated when the Patriots resorted to violence, such as burning houses and [[tarring and feathering]]. Loyalists wanted to take a centrist position and became angry when pressured by the Patriots to declare their opposition to the Crown. Many Loyalists, especially merchants in the port cities, maintained strong and long-standing relations with Britain (often with business and family links to other parts of the British Empire). Many Loyalists realized that independence was bound to come eventually but wanted
