cause for the turmoil erupting on the planet. All this fighting exists for once reason: Adamas, a man-made gem based on the early 21st century process of creating lab-produced diamonds. The history of the diamond is a well-known story of greed and monopoly. But around the early 21st centuries, this precious stone was revealed no longer for purposes of jewelry, but found a new value in the world of computing as it steadily came to replace the silicon based chips that had been the primary source driving the processor chips at the time. At the advent of the lab process for producing large quantities of diamonds for minimal cost, diamond chips rapidly surpassed silicon chips for their ability to run at speeds which produce temperatures hot enough to liquefy a silicon chip. This lasted for some time and the lab process eventually became altered several times over producing skewed variations that surpassed the properties of even a natural diamond hundred times over. Moore.s Law was maintained for centuries on this lab processing based development. But the developments of such high technology lead to many world wars. Naturally war only furthered the advancement of technology resulting in the creation of Mechs, giant intelligent war machines built for one purpose: to destroy at any cost. The creation of the Mech and the forecasting for future wars only fueled the advancement of computing power even further to the development of the latest gem, Adamas. Adamas has properties that would enable any system powered by it nearly unstoppable. Naturally such capabilities in the Mech war machines have every world power drooling. Before the Adamas creation process was finalized, several minor wars erupted between the major powers until only a few now remain. Though their supplies are limited and only a handful of Mechs survived the minor battles, they currently plot against each other for control with only one thing standing in their way. The lab process to create Adamas requires not only diamond but also relies on the newly discovered element, Eris, which can only be mined in the deepest canyons of the oceans. Only a few mines have survived the previous battles, but they may be enough to supply the creation of enough Adamas to build the Mech army necessary to rule the world. On the brink of war, the last remaining powers are scrambling to get their hands on those mines to supply their labs in creation of the strongest Mech armies ever before their opponents do. ===Dev Team=== * Dave Walker * Andrew Lusk * Dan Sledz * Don Schmidt ===Languages and tools=== * Client for contestants: [[C++]] * Server: [[C++]] ==2004 - MechMania X: "X"== [[Image:mmx logo.jpg|thumb|MMX logo]] * Sponsor: Michigan Economic Development Corporation * Website: http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2004/mechmania.php ===Story=== Important Message from the Fleet Received and Decoded War used to be simple. There was us and them, the heroes and the villains, no questions asked. That was, until the Betrayal. Our noble allies --- oh how bitter those words are now --- whose diplomats helped us secure a full century of global peace, whose scientists helped us learn to discover and harness renewable energy, whose doctors and researchers helped us eradicate the most horrific diseases. Yes, they, our great friends, with whom we ushered in a new Golden Age, became greedy. Rather than rule the world with us, they were determined to take it all for themselves. They lured our entire army to the open field, promising the destruction of all our combined arms. How foolish we were to be so trusting; the hundred quiet years had made us weak. Instead of the great moment of friendship and peace, a bloodbath ensued. We lost a full million in this single act of treachery. In a quick retaliatory attack, we made them pay equally dearly; every one of our blood debts was paid back in full. Thus began the War . . . It has continued as such, matched blow for blow. There is an uneasy calm about the world. Everyone knows things cannot continue this way. The populations of both our countries dwindle. Soon there will only be vagrants wandering the corpse-laden wastelands and deserted cities. But you knew all of this, of course. It is impossible to be alive today and be unaware of what has brought us to the brink of ruin. As one of only a handful of properly trained military officers remaining, our government has entrusted you with its most dangerous and risky task: win the battle for the open seas. If you succeed, you guarantee our enemies' utter annihilation and the glory of an impossible victory for yourself. If you fail, though, you will damn our people to enslavement and our way of life to destruction. It's simple, really: our major --- and only --- competitor for the naval sphere holds the opposing coast. All that stands between them and us are open water and a few strategic islands. Gain the islands, it's that easy. Prove that we are the only true sea captains in this world. To support you, the government has ordered all military-related industries to begin wartime production. Your resources will be unlimited. Unfortunately, we only have one shipyard available on this coast. So while you effectively control an infinite supply of submarines, aircraft carriers and destroyers, the production of these ships will take time. Time you don't have. The strategy we leave in your obviously capable hands. Will you seek a sleek armada of subs, destined to crush our opponents from beneath the surface or will you use the overpowering volleys of our gigantic destroyers to sink the enemy? The choice, and our people's fate, is yours. -- Fleet Admiral Nimitz IV ===Dev Team=== * Dave Walker * Andrew Lusk * Don Schmidt * Keenan Crane ===Languages and tools=== * Client for contestants: [[C++]] * Server: [[C++]] ==2005 - MechMania XI: "XI"== [[Image:mmxi logo.jpg|thumb|MMXI logo]] * Sponsor: [[Amazon.com]] * Website: http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2005/mechmania.php ===Story=== The Story So Farâ€¦ Since ancient times, man has waged
