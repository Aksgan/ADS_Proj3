& ITK Millennium. The 2k can operate in with a [[4:2:2]], 4:4:4 or 8:4:4 input in [[NTSC]] or [[Pal]]. In [[HDTV]] it can operate with [[4:2:2]], 4:4:4 input. Its features include: • Software ([[Red Hat]] [[Linux]] interface) that color grades all or combinations of SDTV 525/625, HDTV 1920x1080, 24P, 24SF, 720P in 4:2:2 or 4:4:4 and data on the same timeline. The optional Data will accommodate (through Hippi & HSDL I/Os) various formats and speeds from lower resolutions through 2048x1556 depending on the I/O. On Data an analog RGBHV monitoring output allows viewing of the otherwise invisible Data signal. <br /> • Features similar to DUI 888s, plus additional options including multiple Power Windows (up to nine), one or two areas of selective Defocus or Enhancement, and extended VSR capability with outboard Gallery reference storage computer which will store and retrieve irrespective of standard in use.<br /> • Built in HD to SD downconverter in some systems. Later 2Ks have “Plus” processing which includes significant improvements to the signal processing circuitry. Older “Non-Plus” models were upgradable. The Control Panels are physically the same as late model DUI’s with curved tops but have numerous different keycaps.<br /> • The control computer is either an SGI O2 with a custom SGI flat screen menu monitor (which requires special SGI Video Driver & Card) or in later model 2K’s this was replaced with an IBM Linux Computer which uses an XVGA flat screen monitor. <br /> • The O2 has a SD video input for VSRs but if a Linux is used a da Vinci Gallery is required to generate the VSR thumbnails. 2Ks are intended for use with the later generation of telecines including Spirit, URSA or similar, C-Reality, Rascal, Sony and ITK telecines. MK3 / FDL / Quadra types are not supported, Current USA 2Ks are supplied with an onboard TLC2 which will support 24/30 dual sync functionality for 24P operation. A TLC Assistant station comprising another IBM PC is available for dual operator installations. Alternatively a standalone TLC2 of the traditional type may be interfaced if required. In addition to telecine 2K’s may also be used for tape to tape, virtual telecine and DDR applications. For use with non-linear Storage/SAN sources a da Vinci “Splice” ise used ahead of the 2K to provide data management to/from DPX files (up to 2048x1556) to SD/HD/HSDL with an inbuilt DVE for XYZ sizing,rotation etc. with subsequent color correction in the conventional fashion through the 2K.<br /> Built with Resolve’s Transformer II, Splice has Resolve’s basic conform and I/O features, but enhanced to extend the life and capabilities of a 2K. Splices' features include:<br /> • Supports direct MXF and QuickTime playback for grading<br /> • Color grade RED Raw files in realtime<br /> • Conform from AAF or CMX edit data<br /> • Color grade 4k files<br /> • Non-linear conforming<br /> • Support for HSDL at 14.98 or 15 fps, with time code support for 24, 25 and 30 fps <br /> • Easily match scene-to-scene shots<br /> • Real time pan/tilt/zoom and rotate<br /> • Instant access to all shots<br /> • Grade in context in real-time<br /> • Resolve R-series compatible<br /> • Shots from multiple versions and alternate passes are laid off to tape within minutes<br /> • Export colorist’s notes to the editor in EDL format with full documentation of all alternate passes<br /> • Includes 2K ColorTrace grading management software to support the enhanced list management features of Splice 3.0 *'''Resolve''' is the next-generation color grading system from da Vinci and the first system to use GPUs to control color grading. Powered by da Vinci’s proprietary C.O.R.E. (CUDA Optimized Resolve Engine), Resolve delivers real time HD and up to 4k non-linear color grading, The da Vinci R-series is the first scalable color grading system offering multiple levels of acceleration, features and capabilities, providing colorists with exacting and intuitive color control over static or moving objects. The Resolve scales lower-resolution SD and DV formats to HD, 2k and 4k without compromising quality by using proprietary Transformer technology. da Vinci's first generation Resolves were CPU based, and include the RT and DI systems. In 2008, da Vinci built its first Resolve series (R-100, R-200, R-250, R-300, R-350, R-4K, R-3D) with NVIDIA GPUs, enabling super-computing image processing. The Resolve features include:<br /> • 4k, 2k, HD and SD interactive color grading in real time.<br /> • Digital PowerHouse: Grade digital film, including RED, on any of the R-series systems in their native raw formats.<br /> • Non-linear color grading allows you to quickly match and adjust similar scenes, regardless of where they occur in the program.<br /> • PowerMastering: Multiple resolution deliverables from a single master session enables you to grade in up to 2k using the R-series up to the R-350, and in 4k on the R-4K and output to 4k, 2k HD, SD 16:9, SD 4:3 and other media formats in real time. <br /> • SANs and leading storage systems connect the Resolve with the rest of a post-production facility.<br /> • Conform and grade native Avid MXF files then render back to Avid in source mode for parsing in the Avid environment.<br /> • Unlimited windows, layers and blurs create complex color grading enhancements and fixes in real time.<br /> • Real-time rotation and sizing to preserve the best possible image quality at any resolution.<br /> • Parallel and series node-based grading provides the maximum flexibility to apply complex grades to a scene.<br /> • Combine 4k, 2k, HD, SD and DV footage in the same timeline and utilize our proprietary Transformer technology to resize for a consistent look and output to the desired size and resolution.<br /> • Multi-point object tracking allows you to lock color decisions on moving objects within the scene.<br /> • Laying off to tape in C-mode with graded handles and source time code enables you to effectively interface with another finishing suite. == TLC == The TLC is a [[Linear
