X3D extension supports multi-stage and multi-texture render, it also supports shader with lightmap and normalmap. In 2010 X3D supports deferred rendering architecture. Now X3D can import SSAO, CSM and Realtime Environment Reflection/Lighting, but doesn’t need care much about polygon counts. The user can also use optimizations like BSP/QuadTree/OctTree or culling in the X3D scene. X3D also benefits from other open source standards like XML, DOM and XPath. The user can easily develop content tools like an exporter and editor which make content creation and optimizations tasks easy. ==Standardization== X3D defines several profiles (sets of components) for various levels of capability including X3D Core, X3D Interchange, X3D Interactive, X3D CADInterchange, X3D Immersive, and X3D Full. Browser makers can define their own component extensions prior to submitting them for standardisation by the [[Web3D Consortium]]. Formal review and approval is then performed by the International Organization for Standardization ([[ISO]]). Liaison and cooperation agreements are also in place between the [[Web3D Consortium]] and the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C), [[Open Geospatial Consortium]] (OGC), [[Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine]] (DICOM) and the [[Khronos Group]]. A subset of X3D is XMT-A, a variant of [[Extensible MPEG-4 Textual Format|XMT]], defined in [[MPEG-4]] [[MPEG-4 Part 11|Part 11]]. It was designed to provide a link between X3D and 3D content in MPEG-4 (BIFS). The abstract specification for X3D (ISO/IEC 19775) was first approved by the ISO in 2004. The XML and ClassicVRML encodings for X3D (ISO/IEC 19776) were first approved in 2005.<ref>[http://www.web3d.org/about/faq/#process-3 X3D FAQ – "What is the status of the X3D specification?"].

An X3D applet is a software program that runs within a web browser that displays content in 3D, using OpenGL 3D graphics technology to display X3D content in several different browsers (IE, Safari, Firefox) across several different operating systems<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.web3d.org/message_boards/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=2080&start=0|title=X3D applet|publisher=Members.shaw.ca|date=|accessdate=2010-02-23}}</ref>(Windows, Mac OS X, Linux). However, X3D has not received a wider ground of acceptance in other, more notable and proprietary software applications. In 2000s, many companies like Bitmanagement improved the quality level of virtual effects in X3D to quality level of [[DirectX]] 9.0c, but at the expense of using proprietary solutions. All main features like game modeling are already complete. They include multi-pass render with low level setting for Z-buffer, BlendOp, AlphaOp, Stencil<ref>[http://www.bitmanagement.com/developer/contact/examples/multitexture/drawgroup.html DrawGroup & DrawOp]</ref>, Multi-texture <ref>[http://www.web3d.org/x3d/specifications/ISO-IEC-19775-1.2-X3D-AbstractSpecification/Part01/components/texturing.html#Multitexturing Multitexturing]</ref>, Shader with HLSL and GLSL support<ref>[http://www.web3d.org/x3d/specifications/ISO-IEC-19775-1.2-X3D-AbstractSpecification/Part01/components/shaders.html Programmable shaders component]</ref>, real-time Render To Texture, Multi Render Target (MRT) and post-processing<ref>[http://www.bitmanagement.com/developer/contact/relnotes72.html#postprocessing Scene postprocessing support]</ref>. Many demos shows that X3D already supports lightmap, normalmap, SSAO, CSM and real-time environment reflection along with other virtual effects.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/user/m17design VRML X3D and Realtime Web3D]</ref> X3D strives to become the 3D standard for the Web, as integrated in the [[HTML5]] pages as other XML dialects ([[MathML]], [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]]) already are there. [[X3DOM]] is a proposed syntax model and its implementation as a script library<ref>[http://x3dom.org/ X3DOM JavaScript library]</ref> that demonstrates how this integration can be achieved without a browser plugin, using only [[WebGL]] and JavaScript.<ref>[http://www.web3d.org/x3d/wiki/index.php/X3D_and_HTML5#X3DOM_proposal X3D and HTML5: X3DOM proposal], Web3D wiki</ref> == Example == <source lang="xml"> <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE X3D PUBLIC "ISO//Web3D//DTD X3D 3.2//EN" "http://www.web3d.org/specifications/x3d-3.2.dtd"> <X3D profile="Interchange" version="3.2" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsd:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=" http://www.web3d.org/specifications/x3d-3.2.xsd "> <Scene> <Shape> <IndexedFaceSet coordIndex="0 1 2"> <Coordinate point="0 0 0 1 0 0 0.5 1 0"/> </IndexedFaceSet> </Shape> </Scene> </X3D> </source> ==Alternatives== *[[3DMLW]]: 3D Markup Language for Web *[[COLLADA]]: managed by the Khronos Group *[[O3D]]: developed by Google *[[Universal 3D|U3D]]: Ecma International standard ECMA-363 *[[VRML]]: precursor of X3D ==See also== *[[Active Worlds]] [[virtual reality]] multi-user 3D chat platform *[[Blaxxun]] [[virtual reality]] multi-user 3D chat platform *[[Flux (software)|Flux]], freely downloadable VRML/X3D editor/browser, released by authors of these standards *[[FreeWRL]], free Open Source VRML/X3D browser *[[List of vector graphics markup languages]] *[[MeshLab]] open source mesh processing system that can export VRML/X3D *[[Seamless3d]] free Open Source 3D modeling software *[[Open XML Paper Specification]] *[[OZ Virtual]] *[[Virtual tour]] *[[Web3D]] *[[Virtual Environment Software]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== {{Commons category|X3D}} <!--=======================({{No More Links}})=========================== |PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.
