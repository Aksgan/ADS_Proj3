to run DAs (and still does up to [[Mac OS 9]].x) for backward compatibility. The [[icon (computing)|icon]] for a desk accessory program under System 7 and later is roughly a reversed version of the application icon, with the writing hand on the left side instead of the right. A similar mechanism to allow small utility programs to run along with regular applications was also present in the operating system for the [[Apple IIGS]]. ==GEM== [[image:DA OpenGem.png|thumb|right|400px|The supplied Desk Accessories in [[OpenGEM]]]] [[Graphical Environment Manager|GEM]] resembled the Macintosh closely in many respects, and one of them was the presence of Desk Accessories, for the same reason - to allow multiple programs to be used in a system that only supported one full application at a time. From a programming point of view, Desk Accessories were implemented, like other GEM applications, as [[DOS executable|DOS .EXE files]], with names ending with .ACC (Accessory) rather than .APP (Application). Each .ACC file could support multiple accessories; all three of the standard GEM accessories (Calculator, Clock and Print Spooler) were provided by <code>CALCLOCK.ACC</code>. Installation was simply a matter of placing the .ACC in the correct directory - <code>\GEMBOOT</code> in earlier versions, and <code>\GEMAPPS\GEMSYS</code> in GEM/3 and later. Since each DA loaded reduced the amount of memory available for programs, one technique for temporarily increasing available space was to rename one or more .ACC files to have a different suffix (usually .ACX) and restart GEM. On the [[Amstrad]] [[PC-1512]], for example, the Snapshot accessory was shipped as <code>SNAPSHOT.ACX</code> and had to be renamed to .ACC if required. Desk Accessories continued to be supported in [[ViewMAX]], the [[DR-DOS]] file manager, which was supplied with almost unchanged versions of Calculator and Clock. ==PalmOS== For much the same reason as Desk Accessories were used in Mac OS and in GEM, namely to allow more than one simultaneous program on a system that did not support multitasking, the concept of Desk Accessories was extended to PalmOS by third-party developers. DA are applets launched by an application or hack serving as a DA launcher. The DA launcher may watch for keystrokes or other system events and pop up a pre-defined desk accessory. Many general purpose PalmOS launcher applications are capable of launching DAs as well. A Desk Accessory program is a Palm resource database of type 'DAcc', specified to include a single 'code' #1000 resource that contains the binary code implementing the Desk Accessory. Global or static variables are not available, but a DA can call user interface APIs. It is possible for a DA to have user interface resources in its database. The Desk Accessory launcher transfers execution to the first byte of the 'code' #1000 resource. DAs provide a modicum of multitasking. However, unlike in Mac OS and GEM, after the user is done working with the DA, it must be closed to return to the underlying application. It is possible to pop a DA up over another DA, though this might deplete stack space. ==References== * Andy Hertzfeld.

Amongst its features is a complete [[widget engine]] for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] as well as a desktop object system. User creations can be exported as .desktop files or as widgets. The program is distributed with [[Object Desktop]] as well as stand-alone. DesktopX was released by [[Alberto Riccio]] in 1999 as VDE ([[Verona]] Desktop Enhancer), and bought in 2000 by [[Stardock]]. Mini-applications created with it were called "object packs" but later rebranded as "widgets" to standardize the term. Most users used DesktopX to build alternative desktop environments. The mini-application creation ability was there from the start but did not gain widespread use until the release of ''DesktopX 2'' in 2003. Current versions run on [[Windows 2000]] and above. ==Overview== DesktopX supports the creation of three different types of widgets: *''objects''; loaded into a running DesktopX environment. *''widgets''; groups of objects packaged into executables that require DesktopX (equivalent to [[Yahoo! Widget Engine]] widgets). *''gadgets''; totally standalone widgets provided as applications. Objects may be controlled by [[Scripting programming language|script]]s written in either [[VBScript]] or [[JScript]], although they are not always required. Many common actions are provided for as in-built object functions, such as: * running a [[computer program|program]]. * displaying a [[menu (computing)|menu]] containing the contents of a [[folder]]. * emptying the ''Recycle Bin''. Similarly, animation, sound and variation depending on the object's state (for example, mouseover or clicking) can be modified without scripting. DesktopX [[plugin]]s also avoid the need for scripting common tasks, by offering extra functionality such as [[media player (application software)|media player]] displays and controls (currently available for [[iTunes]], [[Winamp]], [[CoolPlayer]], an internal version of [[Windows Media Player]] and Stardock's own ''ObjectMedia'') and access to [[Windows Management Instrumentation]]. As users often wish to have a uniform desktop style, a common practice is to create several widgets as a coherent ''theme''. A few popular artists sell themes in the [[WinCustomize]] [http://www.wincustomize.com/store/ store]. As of 2010 there are three main standalone divisions of DesktopX: *'''DesktopX Client''', which allows the use of desktops, objects and widgets. *'''DesktopX Standard''', which includes the ''DesktopX Builder'' that creates objects and widgets as well as desktops. *'''DesktopX Pro''', which allows the creation of gadgets that may be sold as separate applications or used to promote a website. DesktopX Standard may also be obtained as part of an [[Object Desktop]] subscription. Corporations may purchase '''DesktopX Enterprise''', allowing the creation of secure desktops. == Gadgets == In 2003, Stardock released DesktopX 2 Pro, which allowed developers to export their creations as stand-alone programs called "gadgets". This feature was enhanced with DesktopX
