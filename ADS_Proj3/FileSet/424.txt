this black box is the value defining the ratio between the incoming and the outgoing light energy for the given couple of angles. The content of the black box may be a mathematical formula which more or less accurately tries to model and approximate the actual surface behavior or an algorithm which produces the output based on discrete samples of measured data. This implies that the function is 4 (+1) dimensional (4 values for 2 3D angles + 1 optional for wave length of the light), which means that it cannot be simply represented by 2D and not even by a 3D graph. Each 2D or 3D graph, sometimes seen in the literature, shows only a slice of the function. * Some tend to use the term '''BSDF''' simply as a category name covering the whole family of BxDF functions. * The term '''BSDF''' is sometimes used in a slightly different context, for the function describing the amount of the scatter (not scattered light), scatter being simply a function of the incident light angle. An example to illustrate this context: for perfectly lambertian surface the BSDF(angle)=const. This approach is used for instance to verify the output quality by the manufacturers of the glossy surfaces. * Another recent usage of the term '''BSDF''' can be seen in some 3D packages, when vendors use it as a 'smart' category to encompass the simple well known cg algorithms like Phong, Blinn etc. ==Overview of the BxDF functions== [[Image:BSSDF01 400.svg|thumb|right|250px|BRDF vs. BSSRDF]] *'''BSDF''' ('''Bidirectional scattering distribution function''') is the most general function. *'''BSSRDF''' ('''Bidirectional surface scattering reflectance distribution function''' or '''B scattering surface RDF'''){{Ref|nicodemus_1977}}describes the relation between outgoing radiance and the incident flux, including the phenomena like [[subsurface scattering]] (SSS). *'''BRDF''' ('''[[Bidirectional reflectance distribution function]]''') is a simplified BSSRDF, assuming that light enters and leaves at the same point (''see the image on the right''). * '''BTDF''' ('''Bidirectional transmittance distribution function''') is similar to BRDF but for the opposite side of the surface.

It is capable of traversing difficult terrain at {{convert|4|mph|km/h}}, carrying {{convert|340|lb|kg}}, and climbing a 35 degree incline.<ref name="BD" /> Locomotion is controlled by an onboard computer that receives input from the robot's various sensors. Navigation and balance are also managed by the control system. == History == BigDog is funded by the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) in the hopes that it will be able to serve as a robotic [[mule|pack mule]] to accompany soldiers in terrain too rough for conventional vehicles. Instead of wheels or treads, BigDog uses four legs for movement, allowing it to move across surfaces that would defeat wheels. The legs contain a variety of sensors, including joint position and ground contact. BigDog also features a [[laser gyroscope]] and a [[stereo vision]] system. BigDog was featured in episodes of ''[[Web Junk 20]]'' and ''[[Hungry Beast]]'', and in articles in ''[[New Scientist]]'', ''[[Popular Science]]'', ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'', and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. On March 18, 2008, Boston Dynamics released video footage of a new generation of BigDog. The footage shows BigDog's ability to walk on icy terrain and recover its balance when kicked from the side.<ref>[http://www.bostondynamics.com/dist/BigDog.wmv Video of BigDog in action] from [[Boston Dynamics]]</ref> == Hardware == Big Dog is powered by a [[two-stroke]], [[single cylinder engine|one-cylinder]], 15-HP go-kart engine operating at over 9,000 RPM. The engine drives a [[hydraulic]] pump, which in turn drives the hydraulic leg [[actuator]]s. Each leg has four actuators (two for the hip joint, and one each for the knee and ankle joints), for a total of 16. Each actuator unit consists of a hydraulic cylinder, servovalve, position sensor, and force sensor. Onboard computing power is a ruggedized [[PC/104]] board stack with a [[Pentium 4]] class computer running [[QNX]].<ref name="BigDogSlides2008">{{cite web | url=http://www.bostondynamics.com/img/BigDog_Overview.pdf | title=BigDog Overview | date=November 22, 2008 |publisher=Boston Dynamics}}</ref> == See also == * [[Biorobotics]] * [[Legged Squad Support System]], the next phase of the Big Dog project == References == {{Reflist}} == External links == *[http://www.bostondynamics.com/robot_bigdog.html Boston Dynamics's BigDog page] *{{YouTube|W1czBcnX1Ww|Boston Dynamics Big Dog (new video March 2008)}} *[http://bigdogrobotvideos.com/ Collection of BigDog videos] [[Category:2005 introductions]] [[Category:Biomorphic robots]] [[Category:Military robots]] [[de:BigDog]] [[es:BigDog]] [[fr:BigDog]] [[it:BigDog]] [[ja:ビッグドッグ]] [[pt:BigDog]] [[ru:BigDog]] [[fi:BigDog]] [[sv:BigDog]] [[zh:波士顿机械狗]]</text> </page> <page> <id>3742</id> <title>BigQuery</title> <text>{{Infobox website | name = BigQuery | type = [[Infrastructure as a service]] | language = [[English language|English]] | current status = Active | url = [http://code.google.com/apis/bigquery/ code.google.com/apis/bigquery] | registration = Required | owner = [[Google]] | launch date = May 19, 2010 }} '''BigQuery''' for Developers is a [[Restful|RESTful]] [[web service]] that enables interactive analysis of massively large datasets working in conjunction with [[Google Storage]].
