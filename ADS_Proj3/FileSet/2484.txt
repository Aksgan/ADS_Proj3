connected to its neighbors by 6 lattice velocities, using for example the hexagonal FHP model. There can be either 0 or 1 particles at a lattice node moving in a lattice direction. After a time interval, each particle will move to the neighboring node in its direction, this process is called the propagation or streaming step. When there are more than one particles arriving at the same node from different directions, they collide and change their directions according to a set of collision rules. Suitable collision rules should conserve the particle number (mass), momentum, and energy before and after the collision. However, it was found that LGA suffers from several native defects: lack of [[Galilean invariance]], [[statistical noise]], exponential complexity for three-dimensional lattices, etc. The main motivation for the transition from LGA to LBM was the desire to remove the statistical noise by replacing the Boolean particle number in a lattice direction with its ensemble average, the so-called density distribution function. Accompanying this replacement, the discrete collision rule is also replaced by a continuous function known as the collision operator. In the LBM development, an important simplification is to approximate the collision operator with the [[Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook]] (BGK) relaxation term. This lattice BGK (LBGK) model makes simulations more efficient and allows flexibility of the transport coefficients. On the other hand, it has been shown that the LBM scheme can also be considered as a special discretized form of the continuous Boltzmann equation. From [[Chapman-Enskog theory]], one can recover the governing continuity and Navier-Stokes equations from the LBM algorithm. In addition, the pressure field is also directly available from the density distributions and hence there is no extra [[Poisson equation]] to be solved as in traditional CFD methods. ==Lattices and the DnQm classification== Lattice Boltzmann models can be operated on a number of different lattices, both cubic and triangular, and with or without rest particles in the discrete distribution function. A popular way of classifying the different methods by lattice is the DnQm scheme. Here "Dn" stands for "n dimensions" while "Qm" stands for "m speeds". For example, D3Q15 is a three-dimensional Lattice Boltzmann model on a cubic grid, with rest particles present. Each node has a crystal shape, and can deliver particles to each of the six neighboring nodes which share a surface, the eight neighboring nodes sharing a corner, and itself.<ref>Succi, p 68</ref> (The D3Q15 model does not contain particles moving to the twelve neighboring nodes which share an edge; adding those would create a "D3Q27" model.) Real quantities as space and time need to be converted to lattice units prior to simulation. Nondimensional quantities as the Reynolds number remain the same. ==Lattice units conversion== In most lattice Boltzmann simulations <math>\delta_x\,\!</math> is the basic unit for lattice spacing, so if the domain of length <math>L\,\!</math> has <math>N\,\!</math> lattice units along its entire length, the space unit is simply defined as <math>\delta_x=L/N\,\!</math>. Speeds in lattice Boltzmann simulations are typically given in terms of the speed of sound. The discrete time unit can therefore be given as <math>\delta_t = \frac{\delta_x}{C_s}\,\!</math>, where the denominator <math>C_s</math> is the physical speed of sound.<ref>Succi, Appendix D (p. 261-262)</ref> For small-scale flows (such as those seen in [[porous media]] mechanics), operating with the true speed of sound can lead to unacceptably short time steps. It is therefore common to raise the lattice [[Mach number]] to something much larger than the real Mach number, and compensating for this by raising the [[viscosity]] as well in order to preserve the [[Reynolds number]].<ref>Succi, chapter 8.3, p. 117-119</ref> ==Simulation of mixtures== Simulating multiphase/multicomponent flows has always been a challenge to conventional CFD because of the moving and deformable [[Interface (chemistry)|interfaces]]. More fundamentally, the interfaces between different [[Phase (matter)|phase]]s ([[liquid]] and [[vapor]]) or components (e.g., [[oil]] and [[water]]) originate from the specific interactions among fluid molecules. Therefore it is difficult to implement such microscopic interactions into the macroscopic Navier–Stokes equation. However, in LBM, the particulate kinetics provides a relatively easy and consistent way to incorporate the underlying microscopic interactions by modifying the collision operator. Several LBM multiphase/multicomponent models have been developed. Here phase separations are generated automatically from the particle dynamics and no special treatment is needed to manipulate the interfaces as in traditional CFD methods. Successful applications of multiphase/multicomponent LBM models can be found in various complex fluid systems, including interface instability, [[Liquid bubble|bubble]]/[[droplet]] dynamics, [[wetting]] on solid surfaces, interfacial slip, and droplet electrohydrodynamic deformations. ==Thermal Lattice-Boltzmann Method== Currently (2009), a thermal lattice-Boltzmann method (TLBM) falls into one of three categoris: the multi-speed approach.<ref>McNamara, G., Garcia, A., and Alder, B., "A hydrodynamically correct thermal lattice boltzmann model", Journal of Statistical Physics, vol. 87, no. 5, pp. 1111-1121, 1997.</ref> , the passive scalar approach.<ref>Shan, X., "Simulation of rayleigh-b'enard convection using a lattice boltzmann method", Physical Review E, vol. 55, pp. 2780-2788, The American Physical Society, 1997.</ref>, and the thermal energy distribution.<ref>He, X., Chen, S., and Doolen, G.D., "A novel thermal model for the lattice boltzmann method in incompressible limit", Journal of Computational Physics, vol. 146, pp. 282-300, 1998.</ref> ==Limitations== Despite the increasing popularity of LBM in simulating complex fluid systems, this novel approach has some limitations. At present, high-Mach number flows in [[aerodynamics]] are still difficult for LBM, and a consistent thermo-hydrodynamic scheme is absent. However, as with Navier–Stokes based CFD, LBM methods have been successfully coupled to thermal-specific solutions to enable heat transfer (solids-based conduction, convection and radiation) simulation capability. For multiphase/multicomponent models, the interface thickness is usually large and the density ratio across the interface is small when compared with real fluids. Recently this problem has been resolved by Yuan and Schaefer who improved on models by Shan and Chen, Swift, and He, Chen, and Zhang. They were able to reach density ratios of 1000:1 by simply changing the [[equation of state]]. Nevertheless, the wide applications and fast advancements of this method during the past twenty years have proven its potential in computational physics, including [[microfluidics]]: LBM demonstrates promising results in the area of high [[Knudsen number]] flows. ==Derivation of
