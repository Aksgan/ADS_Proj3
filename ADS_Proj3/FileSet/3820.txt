same game with different objects, to expanding into more weapons and rules. *Rock-paper-scissors is frequently played in a "best two out of three" match, and in many cases psych-outs, shouting, and trick gestures are performed to confuse or trick the other player into throwing an illegal toss resulting in a loss. Some players prefer to shout the name of a throw they do not intend to throw in order to misdirect and confuse their opponent. It generally applies that what is thrown is what is officially counted in the match. For instance, yelling Scissors or Paper, and actually throwing Rock. The rock is what is judged and tallied. During tournaments, players often prepare their sequence of three gestures prior to the tournament's commencement.<ref name="Lawrence Journal-World">Steve Vockrodt, [http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2007/apr/08/student_rivals_throw_down_rock_paper_scissors_tour/ "Student rivals throw down at rock, paper, scissors tournament"], ''[[Lawrence Journal-World]]'', April 8, 2007.

No even number of weapons can be made balanced, unless some pairs of weapons result in a draw; there will always be some weapons superior to others. An example of an unbalanced four-weapon game adds "[[dynamite]]" as a trump. Dynamite, expressed as the extended index finger or thumb, always defeats rock, but is defeated by scissors. The paper-dynamite relationship is disputed; using it as a trump generally implies that "dynamite shreds paper," but there are those who claim that the paper would supposedly smother the fuse. Because of this dispute (and the potential unfair advantage that would result), organized rock-paper-scissors contests never use dynamite. A game theory analysis would eliminate one of the four symbols for being a strategy strictly dominated, and the resulting game would be isomorphic to the original rock, paper, scissor (i.e., only a symbol's name would change).<ref>{{cite web | title = The Myth of Dynamite Exposed | url = http://www.worldrps.com/article4.html elephant kills human human kills ant and ant crawls up elephant nose and kills it | author = World RPS Society | accessdate = 2007-11-09 | year = 2002 }}</ref> {{multiple image | footer = Resolution and gesture diagrams for ''Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock'' | image1 = Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock en.svg | alt1 = Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock resolution diagram | width1 = {{#expr: (160 * 400 / 365) round 0}} | image2 = Pierre ciseaux feuille lézard spock.svg | alt2 = Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock gestures | width2 = 160 }} Similarly, the French game "pierre, papier, ciseaux, puits" (rock, paper, scissors, well) is unbalanced; both the rock and scissors fall in the well and lose to it, while paper covers both rock and well. This means two "weapons", well and paper, can defeat two moves, while the last two weapons can only defeat one of the other three choices. :''Main article: [[Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock]]'' One popular five-weapon expansion, claimed to have been invented by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla,<ref>{{cite web | title = Original Rock-Paper-Scissors-Spock-Lizard Page | url = http://www.samkass.com/theories/RPSSL.html | author = Sam Kass | accessdate = 2009-03-11 }}</ref> adds "[[Spock]]" and "[[lizard]]" to the standard three. "Spock" is signified with the Star Trek [[Vulcan salute]], while "lizard" is shown by forming the hand into a sock-puppet-like mouth. Spock smashes scissors and vaporizes rock; he is poisoned by lizard and disproved by paper. Lizard poisons Spock and eats paper; it is crushed by rock and decapitated by scissors.

As long as the number of moves is an odd number and that each move defeats exactly half of the other moves while being defeated by the other half, any combinations of moves will function as a game.

If counsel cannot agree on a neutral site, they shall meet on the front steps of the Sam M. Gibbons U.S. Courthouse, 801 North Florida Ave., Tampa, Florida 33602. Each lawyer shall be entitled to be accompanied by one paralegal who shall act as an attendant and witness. At that time and location, counsel shall engage in one game of "rock, paper, scissors."
