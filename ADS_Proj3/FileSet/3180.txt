sharing common features in all or most of the nitrogen fixing organisms in nature, have distinct characters and qualities differed from one diazotroph to another. Examples of nif genes structure and regulation in different diazotrophs: Klebsiella pneumoniae – a free living anaerobic nitrogen fixing bacteria. It contains a total of 20 nif genes located on the bacteria's chromosome in a 24kb region. nifH, nifK and nifD encode the nitrogenase's subunits, while nifE, nifN, nifU, nifS, nifV, nifW, nifX, nifB and nifQ encode proteins involved the assembly and incorporation of the Fe and Mo into the nitrogenase's subunits. nifF and nifJ encode proteins related to electron transfer taking place in the reduction process and nifA is a regulatory protein in-charge of regulating the nif genes expression. Regulation of the nif genes expression is done through nifA and nifL in the same way described in the previous chapter of the nif genes structure and regulation. (3,5) Nif genes structure in k. pneumoniae (5): Rhodospirillum rubrum – a free living anaerobic photosynthetic bacteria which in addition to the transcriptional control described before, regulates expression of the nif genes also in a metabolic way through a reversible ADP-ribosylation of a specific arginine residue in the nitrogenase complex. The ribosylation takes place when reduced nitrogen is present and it causes a barrier in the electron transfer flow and by so, inactivates nitrogenase's activity. The enzymes catalyzing the ribosylation are called DRAG and DRAT. (5,9) Rhodobacter capsulatus - free living anaerobic phototroph containing a transcriptional nif genes regulatory system. R. capsulatus regulates nif genes expression through nifA in the same manner described before, but it uses a different nifA activator called factor which initiates the RcNtrC. RcNtrC activates a different Expression of nifA and the- nif genes. (5,9). Rhizobia - a gram negative symbiotic nitrogen fixing bacteria. It usually forms symbiotic relationship with Legum species. In some Rhizobia, the nif genes are located on plasmids called the sym plasmids (sym = symbiosis) which contain genes related to nitrogen fixing and some housekeeping genes, while the chromosomes contain most of the housekeeping genes of the bacteria. Regulation of the nif genes expression is done in the transcription level inside the symbiotic plant.(5,9).

'''Nigel Holmes''' (1942) is a British [[graphic designer]] and theorist, who focuses on [[information graphics]] and [[information design]]. == Biography == Holmes received a MA in illustration from the [[Royal College of Art]] in 1966. From 1966 to 1977 he worked as a freelance illustrator and graphic designer in London, England for newspapers and magazines. From 1978 to 1994 he went to New York working for [[Time Magazine]] to design so called "explanation graphics" for the magazine. In that time he also continued other work as freelance designer, lecturer, and authored a book on "Wordless diagrams".<ref>Nigel Holmes introduction at www.understandingusa.com.

On each turn, a player must remove at least one object, and may remove any number of objects provided they all come from the same heap. Variants of Nim have been played since ancient times. The game is said to have originated in [[China]] (it closely resembles the Chinese game of "Jianshizi", or "picking stones"), but the origin is uncertain; the earliest European references to Nim are from the beginning of the 16th century. Its current name was coined by [[Charles L. Bouton]] of [[Harvard University]], who also developed the complete theory of the game in 1901, but the origins of the name were never fully explained. The name is probably derived from [[German language|German]] ''nimm'' meaning "take", or the obsolete English verb ''nim'' of the same meaning. It should also be noted that rotating the word ''NIM'' by 180 degrees results in ''WIN'' (see [[Ambigram]]). Nim is usually played as a ''[[misère]]'' game,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} in which the player to take the last object loses. Nim can also be played as a ''normal play'' game, which means that the person who makes the last move (i.e., who takes the last object) wins. This is called normal play because most games follow this convention, even though Nim usually does not. Normal play Nim (or more precisely the system of [[nimber]]s) is fundamental to the [[Sprague-Grundy theorem]], which essentially says that in normal play every [[impartial game]] is equivalent to a
