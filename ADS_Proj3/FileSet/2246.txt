is some real number that is, respectively, smaller than or larger than all its elements. An interval is said to be '''bounded''' if it is both left- and right-bounded; and is said to be '''unbounded''' otherwise. Intervals that are bounded at only one end are said to be '''half-bounded'''. The empty set is bounded, and the set of all reals is the only interval that is unbounded at both ends. Bounded intervals are also commonly known as '''finite intervals'''. Bounded intervals are [[bounded set]]s, in the sense that their [[diameter]] (which is equal to the [[absolute difference]] between the endpoints) is finite. The diameter may be called the '''length''', '''width''', '''measure''', or '''size''' of the interval. The size of unbounded intervals is usually defined as <math>+\infty</math>, and the size of the empty interval may be defined as 0 or left undefined. The '''centre''' of bounded interval with endpoints <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> is <math>(a+b)/2</math>, and its '''radius''' is the half-length <math>\left|a-b\right|/2</math>. These concepts are undefined for empty or unbounded intervals. An interval is said to be '''left-open''' if and only if it has no [[minimum]] (an element that is smaller than all other elements); '''right-open''' if it has no [[maximum]]; and '''open''' if it has both properties. The interval <math>[0,1) = \{x\,|\,0\leq x < 1\}</math>, for example, is left-closed and right-open. The empty set and the set of all reals are open intervals, while the set of non-negative reals, for example, is a right-open but not left-open interval. The open intervals coincide with the [[open set]]s of the real line in its standard [[point-set topology|topology]]. An interval is said to be '''left-closed''' if it has a minimum element, '''right-closed''' if it has a maximum, and simply '''closed''' if it has both. These definitions are usually extended to include the empty set and to the (left- or right-) unbounded intervals, so that the closed intervals coincide with [[closed set]]s in that topology. The '''interior''' of an interval <math>I</math> is the largest open interval that is contained in <math>I</math>; it is also the set of points in <math>I</math> which are not endpoints of <math>I</math>. The '''closure''' of <math>I</math> is the smallest closed interval that contains <math>I</math>; which is also the set <math>I</math> augmented with its finite endpoints. For any set <math>X</math> of real numbers, the '''interval enclosure''' or '''interval span''' of <math>X</math> is the unique interval that contains <math>X</math> and does not properly contain any other interval that also contains <math>X</math>. ==Classification of intervals== The intervals of real numbers can be classified into eleven different types, listed below; where <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> are real numbers, with <math>a < b</math>: : empty: <math>[b,a] = (a,a) = [a,a) = (a,a] = \{ \} = \emptyset</math> : degenerate: <math>[a,a] = \{a\}</math> : proper and bounded: :: open: <math>(a,b)=\{x\,|\,a<x<b\}</math> :: closed: <math>[a,b]=\{x\,|\,a\leq x\leq b\}</math> :: left-closed, right-open: <math>[a,b)=\{x\,|\,a\,\leq x<b\}</math> :: left-open, right-closed: <math>(a,b]=\{x\,|\,a<x\leq b\}</math> : left-bounded and right-unbounded: :: left-open: <math>(a,\infty)=\{x\,|\,x>a\}</math> :: left-closed: <math>[a,\infty)=\{x\,|\,x\geq a\}</math> : left-unbounded and right-bounded: :: right-open: <math>(-\infty,b)=\{x\,|\,x<b\}</math> :: right-closed: <math>(-\infty,b]=\{x\,|\,x\leq b\}</math> : unbounded at both ends: <math>(-\infty,\infty)=\R</math> ===Intervals of the extended real line=== In some contexts, an interval may be defined as a subset of the [[extended real number line|extended real numbers]], the set of all real numbers augmented with <math>-\infty</math> and <math>+\infty</math>. In this interpretation, the notations <math>[-\infty,b]</math>, <math>[-\infty,b)</math>, <math>[a,+\infty]</math>, and <math>(a,+\infty]</math> are all meaningful and distinct. In particular, <math>(-\infty,+\infty)</math> denotes the set of all ordinary real numbers, while <math>[-\infty,+\infty]</math> denotes the extended reals. This choice affects some of the above definitions and terminology. For instance, the interval <math>(-\infty,+\infty)=\R</math> is closed in the realm of ordinary reals, but not in the realm of the extended reals. ==Properties of intervals== The intervals are precisely the [[connectedness|connected]] subsets of <math>\R</math>. It follows that the image of an interval by any [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] function is also an interval. This is one formulation of the [[intermediate value theorem]]. The intervals are also the [[convex set|convex subset]]s of <math>\R</math>. The interval enclosure of a subset <math>X\subseteq \R</math> is also the [[convex hull]] of <math>X</math>. The intersection of any collection of intervals is always an interval. The union of two intervals is an interval if and only if they have a non-empty intersection or an open end-point of one interval is a closed end-point of the other (e.g., <math>(a,b) \cup [b,c] = (a,c]</math>). If <math>\R</math> is viewed as a [[metric space]], its [[open ball]]s are the open bounded sets <math>(a,b)</math>, and its [[closed ball]]s are the closed bounded sets <math>[a,b]</math>. Any element <math>x</math> of an interval <math>I</math> defines a partition of <math>I</math> into three disjoint intervals <math>I_1,I_2,I_3</math>: respectively, the elements of <math>I</math> that are less than <math>x</math>, the singleton <math>[x,x] = \{x\}</math>, and the elements that are greater than <math>x</math>. The parts <math>I_1</math> and <math>I_3</math> are both non-empty (and have non-empty interiors) if and only if <math>x</math> is in the interior of <math>I</math>. This is an interval version of the [[trichotomy (mathematics)|trichotomy principle]]. == Dyadic intervals == A ''dyadic interval'' is a bounded real interval whose endpoints are <math>\frac{j}{2^n}</math> and <math>\frac{j+1}{2^n}</math>, where <math>j</math> and <math>n</math> are integers. Depending on the context, either endpoint may or may not be included in the interval. Dyadic intervals have some nice properties, such as the following: * The length of a dyadic interval is always an integer power of two. * Every dyadic interval is contained in exactly one "parent" dyadic interval of twice the length. * Every dyadic interval is spanned by two "child" dyadic intervals of half the length. * If two dyadic intervals overlap, then one of them must be a subset of the other. The dyadic intervals thus have a structure very similar to an infinite [[binary tree]]. Dyadic intervals are relevant to several areas of numerical analysis, including [[adaptive mesh refinement]], [[multigrid methods]], and [[wavelet|wavelet analysis]]. ==Multi-dimensional intervals== In many contexts, an '''<math>n</math>-dimensional interval''' is defined as a subset of <math>\R^n</math> that is the [[Cartesian product]] of <math>n</math> intervals, <math>I = I_1\times I_2 \times \cdots \times I_n</math>, one on each [[coordinate]] axis. For <math>n=2</math>, this
