at a single point. == Properties == Quotient maps ''q'' : ''X'' &rarr; ''Y'' are characterized among surjective maps by the following property: if ''Z'' is any topological space and ''f'' : ''Y'' &rarr; ''Z'' is any function, then ''f'' is continuous if and only if ''f'' ∘ ''q'' is continuous. [[Image:QuotientSpace-01.png|center|Characteristic property of the quotient topology]] The quotient space ''X''/~ together with the quotient map ''q'' : ''X'' &rarr; ''X''/~ is characterized by the following [[universal property]]: if ''g'' : ''X'' &rarr; ''Z'' is a continuous map such that ''a''~''b'' implies ''g''(''a'')=''g''(''b'') for all ''a'' and ''b'' in ''X'', then there exists a unique continuous map ''f'' : ''X''/~ &rarr; ''Z'' such that ''g'' = ''f'' <small>O</small> ''q''. We say that ''g'' ''descends to the quotient''. The continuous maps defined on ''X''/~ are therefore precisely those maps which arise from continuous maps defined on ''X'' that respect the equivalence relation (in the sense that they send equivalent elements to the same image). This criterion is constantly used when studying quotient spaces. Given a continuous surjection ''f'' : ''X'' &rarr; ''Y'' it is useful to have criteria by which one can determine if ''f'' is a quotient map. Two sufficient criteria are that ''f'' be [[open map|open]] or [[closed map|closed]]. Note that these conditions are only [[sufficient condition|sufficient]], not [[necessary condition|necessary]]. It is easy to construct examples of quotient maps which are neither open nor closed. == Compatibility with other topological notions == * [[Separation axioms|Separation]] ** In general, quotient spaces are ill-behaved with respect to separation axioms. The separation properties of ''X'' need not be inherited by ''X''/~, and ''X''/~ may have separation properties not shared by ''X''. ** ''X''/~ is a [[T1 space]] if and only if every equivalence class of ~ is closed in ''X''. ** If the quotient map is [[open map|open]] then ''X''/~ is a [[Hausdorff space]] if and only if ~ is a closed subset of the [[product space]] ''X''&times;''X''. * [[Connectedness]] ** If a space is connected or [[path connected]], then so are all its quotient spaces. ** A quotient space of a [[simply connected]] or [[contractible]] space need not share those properties. * [[Compact space|Compactness]] ** If a space is compact, then so are all its quotient spaces. ** A quotient space of a [[locally compact]] space need not be locally compact. * [[Dimension]] ** The [[topological dimension]] of a quotient space can be more (as well as less) than the dimension of the original space; [[space-filling curve]]s provide such examples. ==See also== ===Topology=== *[[Topological space]] *[[Subspace (topology)]] *[[Product space]] *[[Disjoint union (topology)]] *[[Final topology]] *[[Mapping cone]] ===Algebra=== *[[Quotient group]] *[[Quotient space (linear algebra)]] *[[Quotient category]] *[[Mapping cone (homological algebra)]] ==References== *{{Cite book |first=Stephen |last=Willard |title=General Topology |year=1970 |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Reading, MA |isbn=0486434796 }} * {{planetmath reference|id=2930|title=Quotient space}} [[Category:Topology]] [[Category:General topology]] [[Category:Group actions]] [[de:Quotiententopologie]] [[es:Topología cociente]] [[fr:Topologie quotient]] [[it:Topologia quoziente]] [[he:מרחב מנה (טופולוגיה)]] [[nl:Quotiënttopologie]] [[ja:商位相空間]] [[pl:Topologia ilorazowa]] [[pt:Espaço topológico quociente]] [[ru:Факторпространство]] [[uk:Фактор-простір]] [[zh:商空间]]</text> </page> <page> <id>30933</id> <title>R-SMLT</title> <text>'''Routed-SMLT (R-SMLT)''' is a computer networking [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] designed by Nortel (now acquired by [[Avaya]]) as an enhancement to [[SMLT]] enabling the exchange of Layer 3 information between peer nodes in a Switch Cluster for unparalleled resiliency and simplicity for both L3 and L2. In many cases, core network convergence-times after a failure is dependent on the length of time a routing protocol requires to successfully converge (change or re-route traffic around the fault). Depending on the specific routing protocol, this convergence time can cause network interruptions ranging from seconds to minutes. The [[Avaya]] R-SMLT feature works with [[SMLT]], and [[DSMLT]] technologies to provide sub-second failover (normally less than 100 millisecond<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tolly.com/ts/2007/Nortel/ERSswitches/Tolly207171NortelERSwitchSMLT.pdf | title=Evaluation of Resilient Routing Switches for Real-Time Multimedia Traffic with Microsoft Live Communications Server 2005 and Nortel MCS 5100 | publisher=The Tolly Group}}</ref> so no outage is noticed by end users. This high speed recovery is required by many critical networks where outages can cause loss of life or very large monetary losses in critical networks. RSMLT routing topologies providing an active-active router concept to core [[SMLT]] networks. The protocol supports networks designed with [[SMLT]] or [[DSMLT]] triangles, squares, and [[SMLT]] or [[DSMLT]] full mesh topologies, with routing enabled on the core VLANs. R-SMLT takes care of packet forwarding in core router failures and works with any of the following protocol types: IP Unicast Static Routes, RIP1, RIP2, OSPF, BGP and IPX RIP. ==Patent== United States Patent 20050007951 ==Product Support== R-SMLT is supported on Nortel's Ethernet Routing Switch [[Nortel ERS 8600| ERS 8600]], ERS 8300 and [[MERS 8600]] products. ==See also== * [[Avaya]] * [[Avaya Government Solutions]] * [[Link aggregation]] * [[Multi-link trunking]] * [[Distributed Split Multi-Link Trunking]] * [[Split multi-link trunking]] * [[List of Nortel patents]] ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== {{Wiktionarypar|RSMLT}} {{commons cat|Nortel}} * [http://www.nortel.com/products/01/passport/8600_rss/collateral/nn107680-031804.pdf Designing a Resilient Network] * [http://www.nortel.com/products/01/passport/8600_rss/collateral/nn108460-060304.pdf Eliminate Single Points of Failure] NOTE: The above links no longer work {{Avaya}} [[Category:Avaya]] [[Category:Ethernet]] [[Category:Link protocols]] [[Category:Network architecture]] [[Category:Network protocols]] [[Category:Network topology]] [[Category:Nortel protocols]] [[Category:Routing protocols]] [[Category:Acronyms]] [[vi:Định tuyến-SMLT]]</text> </page> <page> <id>30938</id> <title>R.
