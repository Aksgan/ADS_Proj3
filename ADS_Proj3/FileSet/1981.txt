is suggested to have an effect on suppressing inflammatory cascades based on recent evidence.<ref name="Ann M"/> It is believed to modulate signals transmitted through TLRs, TLR3, 4, and 9 specifically. Mutation of it has resulted in [[Crohn's disease]]. Excessive T-helper 1 responses to resident flora in the gut are controlled by inhibiting the controlling influence of regulatory T cells and tolerance-inducing dendritic cells. Sleep timing depends upon a balance between homeostatic sleep propensity, the need for sleep as a function of the amount of time elapsed since the last adequate sleep episode, and [[circadian rhythm]]s that determine the ideal timing of a correctly structured and restorative sleep episode.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wyatt |first=James K. |coauthors=Ritz-De Cecco, Angela; Czeisler, Charles A.; Dijk, Derk-Jan |date=1 October 1999|title= Circadian temperature and melatonin rhythms, sleep, and neurobehavioral function in humans living on a 20-h day |journal=Am J Physiol |volume=277 |issue=4 |pages=R1152â€“R1163.

When the receptor senses a stimulus, it sends information to a '''control in the centre of it all metobolism center''', the component that sets the range at which a variable is maintained. The control center determines an appropriate response to the stimulus. In most homeostatic mechanisms the control center is the brain. The control center then sends signals to an effector, which can be muscles, organs or other structures that receive signals from the control center. After receiving the signal, a change occurs to correct the deviation by either enhancing it with [[positive feedback]] or depressing it with [[negative feedback]] <ref name=Marieb>Marieb, Elaine N. & Hoehn, Katja (2007). ''Human Anatomy & Physiology'' (Seventh ed.). San Francisco, CA: Pearson Benjamin Cummings.</ref> ====Positive feedback==== [[Image:Positive feedback bistable switch.svg|thumb|250px|Positive feedback is a mechanism by which an output is enhanced, such as protein levels. However, in order to avoid any fluctuation in the protein level, the mechanism is inhibited stochastically (I), therefore when the concentration of the activated protein (A) is past the threshold (<nowiki>[I]</nowiki>), the loop mechanism is activated and the concentration of A increases exponentially if ''d''<nowiki>[A]</nowiki>=k <nowiki>[A]</nowiki>]] [[Positive feedback]] mechanisms are designed to accelerate or enhance the output created by a stimulus that has already been activated. Unlike negative feedback mechanisms that initiate to maintain or regulate physiological functions within a set and narrow range, the positive feedback mechanisms are designed to push levels out of normal ranges. To achieve this purpose, a series of events initiates a cascading process that builds to increase the effect of the stimulus. This process can be beneficial but is rarely used by the body due to risks of the acceleration's becoming uncontrollable. One positive feedback example event in the body is blood [[platelet]] accumulation, which, in turn, causes [[blood clotting]] in response to a break or tear in the lining of blood vessels. Another example is the release of [[oxytocin]] to intensify the contractions that take place during childbirth.<ref name=Marieb/> ====Negative feedback==== Negative feedback mechanisms consist of reducing the output or activity of any organ or system back to its normal range of functioning. A good example of this is regulating [[blood pressure]]. [[Blood vessel]]s can sense resistance of blood flow against the walls when blood pressure increases. The blood vessels act as the receptors and they relay this message to the [[brain]]. The brain then sends a message to the [[heart]] and blood vessels, both of which are the effectors. The heart rate would decrease as the blood vessels increase in [[diameter]] (or [[vasodilation]]). This change would cause the blood pressure to fall back to its normal range. The opposite would happen when blood pressure decreases, and would cause [[vasoconstriction]]. Another important example is seen when the body is deprived of food. The body would then reset the metabolic set point to a lower than normal value. This would allow the body to continue to function, at a slower rate, even though the body is starving. Therefore, people who deprive themselves of food while trying to lose weight would find it easy to shed weight initially and much harder to lose more after. This is due to the body readjusting itself to a lower metabolic set point to allow the body to survive with its low supply of energy. Exercise can change this effect by increasing the metabolic demand. Another good example of negative feedback mechanism is temperature control. The [[hypothalamus]], which monitors the body temperature, is capable of determining even the slightest of variation of normal body temperature (37 degrees [[Celsius]]). Response to such variation could be stimulation of glands that produces sweat to reduce the temperature or signaling various muscles to shiver to increase body temperature. Both feedbacks are equally important for the healthy functioning of one's body. Complications can arise if any of the two feedbacks are affected or altered in any way. ===Homeostatic imbalance=== Many diseases are a result of disturbance of homeostasis, a condition known as homeostatic imbalance. As it ages, every organism will lose efficiency in its control systems. The inefficiencies gradually result in an unstable internal environment that increases the risk for illness. In addition, homeostatic imbalance is also responsible for the physical changes associated with aging. Even more serious than illness and other characteristics of aging is death. Heart failure has been seen where nominal negative feedback mechanisms become overwhelmed, and destructive positive feedback mechanisms then take over.<ref name=Marieb/> Diseases that result from a homeostatic imbalance include diabetes, [[dehydration]], hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, [[gout]], and any disease caused by a toxin present in the bloodstream. All of these conditions result from the presence of an increased amount of a particular substance. In ideal circumstances, homeostatic control mechanisms should prevent this imbalance from occurring, but, in some
