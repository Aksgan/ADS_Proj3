MA degrees are at NQF 7 and PhD degrees are at level NQF 8. Other countries, specifically South Africa, equate different NQF levels to degrees: for instance, a Masters degree in South Africa is at NQF 8, while a doctoral degree is at NQF 9. The reason for this difference in NQF levels is that South Africa requires students to undertake a fourth year, or an Honours degree, between their Bachelors and Masters degree. SAQA, the South African Qualifications Accreditation company, compares international degrees with local degrees before any international student continues their studies in that country. While the UK degree accreditation and classification system allows students to go straight from a three year Bachelors degree onto a Masters degree, South Africa does not do so, unless the student has proven research capabilities. South African Honours degrees prepare the students to undertake a research-specific degree (in terms of Masters), by spending an in-depth year (up to 5 modules) creating research proposals and undertaking a research project of limited scope. This prepares students for the research degrees later in their academic career. ==Progression to postgraduate study== Regulations governing the progression of undergraduate degree graduates to postgraduate programmes vary between universities, and are often flexible. A candidate for a postgraduate [[master's degree]] is usually required to have at least a 2:2 degree, although candidates with 2:1s are in a considerably stronger position to gain a place on a postgraduate course and to obtain funding. Some institutions specify a 2:1 minimum for certain types of master's program, such as for a [[Master of Research]] course.<ref>[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/gsprospectus/applying/entry.html Entrance requirements: Graduate Prospectus 2010â€“11], ''[[University of Cambridge]]'', September 2009</ref><ref>[https://lfylive.lse.ac.uk/lfy/tc/enquiries/enquiry.html?a=4&q=565 What are the entry requirements for graduate programmes at LSE?], ''[[London School of Economics]]''</ref> Candidates with a Third or ordinary degree are sometimes accepted, provided they have acquired satisfactory professional experience subsequent to graduation. A candidate for a [[doctorate|doctoral]] programme who does not hold a [[master's degree]] is nearly always required to have a First or 2:1. On the whole, postgraduate funding opportunities vary according to institution, field, entry requirements and candidate degree classification. The diverse range of opportunities available is such that in many cases a lower class of degree does not necessarily preclude candidates from postgraduate funding.

These degrees cannot be awarded separately. By tradition these graduates are addressed as 'doctor', the only example in the United Kingdom for people with bachelor's degrees. Unlike most undergraduate degrees, MBBS is not awarded in classes (i.e., there are no first, second or third class honours MBBS degrees). Individual degrees are marked as pass, fail or merit (which is the equivalent of a first in most other degrees, although the system varies between medical schools). Results of final examinations in fourth or fifth year split the year groups into one of four quartiles. These quartiles allocate base points for NHS job applications where the top quartile awards 40 points, decreasing by two points for the second quartiles and again for the third and fourth. Distinctions can be awarded for certain parts of the course to the best students (who will usually have several merits already). Honours are awarded at some institutions for exceptional performance throughout the course. The Bachelor of Medicine awarded in the UK is equivalent to the Doctor of Medicine (MD) in the US, Canada, etc. In contrast, the degree of Doctor of Medicine (MD) in the UK is a doctorate earned by research and thesis, similar to a PhD in most universities. About 5% of medical doctors in the UK hold both MBBS / MBBChB plus either an MD or a PhD. In some UK universities, because it is unsupervised, the MD is considered to be a higher doctorate. ==Undergraduate degree honours slang==<!-- This section is linked from [[Cockney rhyming slang]] --> A form of [[rhyming slang]] has developed from degree classes, usually using names of famous people.
