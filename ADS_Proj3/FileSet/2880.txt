Additionally, the Wireless Networking Group <ref>{{citeweb|title=Wireless Networking Group|url=http://www.crhc.illinois.edu/wireless/netx.html}}</ref> in the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] are developing a multichannel, multi-radio wireless mesh testbed, called Net-X as a proof of concept implementation of some of the multichannel protocols being developed in that group. The implementations are based on an architecture that allows some of the radios to switch channels to maintain network connectivity, and includes protocols for channel allocation and routing.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Wireless Networking Group|url=http://www.crhc.illinois.edu/wireless/papers/kyasanur2006Tech.pdf}}</ref> SMesh is an [[802.11]] multi-hop wireless mesh network developed by the Distributed System and Networks Lab at [[Johns Hopkins University]].<ref>{{citeweb|title=SMesh|url=http://smesh.org|publisher=smesh.org|accessdate=2008-02-23}}</ref> A fast [[handoff]] scheme allows mobile clients to roam in the network without interruption in connectivity, a feature suitable for real-time applications, such as [[VOIP|VoIP]]. Many mesh networks operate across multiple radio bands. For example [[Firetide]] and Wave Relay mesh networks have the option to communicate node to node on 5.2 GHz or 5.8 GHz, but communicate node to client on 2.4 GHz (802.11). This is accomplished using SDR ([[Software-defined radio|Software-Defined radio]].) The SolarMESH project examined the potential of powering 802.11-based mesh networks using solar power and rechargeable batteries.<ref>{{citeweb|title=SolarMesh |url=http://owl.mcmaster.ca/~todd/SolarMESH|publisher=mcmaster.ca|accessdate=2008-04-15}}</ref> Legacy 802.11 access points were found to be inadequate due to the requirement that are continuously powered.<ref>Terence D.

In IEEE Network, May/June 2008.</ref> The [[802.11s|IEEE 802.11s]] standardization efforts are considering power save options, but solar-powered applications might involve single radio nodes where relay-link power saving will be inapplicable. The WING project <ref>http://www.wing-project.org WING</ref> (sponsored by the Italian Ministry of University and Research and led by CREATE-NET and Technion) developed a set of novel algorithms and protocols for enabling wireless mesh networks as the standard access architecture for next generation Internet. Particular focus has been given to interference and traffic aware channel assignment, multi-radio/multi-interface support, and opportunistic scheduling and traffic aggregation in highly volatile environments. Recent standards for wired communications have also incorporated concepts from Mesh Networking. An examples is [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]], a standard that specifies a high-speed (up to 1 Gigabit/s) [[local area network]] using existing home wiring ([[Power line communication|power lines]], phone lines and [[Ethernet over coax|coaxial cables]]). In noisy environments such as power lines (where signals can be heavily attenuated and corrupted by noise) it's common that mutual visibility between devices in a network is not complete. In those situations, one of the nodes has to act as a relay and forward messages between those nodes that cannot communicate directly, effectively creating a mesh network. In G.hn, relaying is performed at the [[Data Link Layer]]. == See also == {{commonscat|Mesh network}} *[[OLSR]] *[[B.A.T.M.A.N.]] *[[Open Shortest Path First]] *[[Opportunity Driven Multiple Access|ODMA]] *[[Peer-to-peer]] *[[Game theory in communication networks]] *[[ZigBee]] *[[Optical mesh network]] === Mesh network applications === * [[Wireless mesh network]] * [[History of wireless mesh networking|Distinct radio node deployments of Wireless Mesh Networking]] * [[BioWeb]] * [[Wireless ad hoc network]] * [[Wireless community network]] * [[Mobile ad hoc network]] (MANET) * [[VANET|Vehicular ad-hoc network]] ** [[InVANET|Intelligent Vehicular AdHoc Network]] ===Mesh network devices=== * [[MeshBox]] * [[Meraki]] == Technical challenges == * [[Wizzy Digital Courier]] * [[Delay-tolerant networking]] ==References== {{reflist}} == External links == <!-- Only links to sites that provide actual information about mesh networking.

MOM allows application modules to be distributed over heterogeneous platforms, and reduces the complexity of developing applications that span multiple operating systems and network protocols by insulating the application developer from the details of the various operating system and network interfaces. APIs that extend across diverse platforms and networks are typically provided by MOM.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} MOM is a software that resides in both portions of client/server architecture and typically supports asynchronous calls between the client and server applications. MOM reduces the involvement of application developers with the complexity of the master-slave nature of the client/server mechanism. ==Origins== ===A requirements story=== The case of a large bank provides a good example of how middleware emerged as a [[business]] requirement: The bank had stored all its customer details on its large [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] since the 1960s. This mainframe remained in heavy use and underwent several upgrades. Although ground-breaking in its day, the mainframe's usefulness to the bank’s staff diminished as the bank introduced new, separate applications based on [[personal computer]]s (PCs), allowing the bank’s staff to offer customers new services that the mainframe could
