more of the fingerprints recovered from a crime scene had been identified as a result of laboratory-based techniques. ====Laboratory techniques==== Although there are hundreds of reported techniques for fingerprint detection, many of these are only of academic interest and there are only around 20 really effective methods which are currently in use in the more advanced fingerprint laboratories around the world. Some of these techniques, such as [[ninhydrin]], [[1,8-Diazafluoren-9-one|diazafluorenone]] and [[Evaporation (deposition)|vacuum metal deposition]], show great sensitivity and are used operationally. Some fingerprint reagents are specific, for example ninhydrin or diazafluorenone reacting with amino acids. Others such as [[ethyl cyanoacrylate]] polymerisation, work apparently by water-based catalysis and polymer growth. Vacuum metal deposition using gold and zinc has been shown to be non-specific, but can detect fat layers as thin as one molecule. More mundane methods, such as the application of fine powders, work by adhesion to sebaceous deposits and possibly aqueous deposits in the case of fresh fingerprints. The aqueous component of a fingerprint, whilst initially sometimes making up over 90% of the weight of the fingerprint, can evaporate quite quickly and may have mostly gone after 24 hours. Following work on the use of argon ion lasers for fingerprint detection,<ref>Dalrymple BE, Duff JM, Menzel ER. Inherent fingerprint luminescence – detection by laser. Journal of Forensic Sciences, 22(1), 1977, 106-115. See [[Brian E. Dalrymple|Dalrymple]].</ref> a wide range of fluorescence techniques have been introduced, primarily for the enhancement of chemically-developed fingerprints, although the inherent fluorescence of some latent fingerprints may also be detected. The most comprehensive manual of the operational methods of fingerprint enhancement is published by the UK Home Office Scientific Development Branch and is used widely around the world.<ref>[http://scienceandresearch.homeoffice.gov.uk/hosdb/fingerprints-footwear-marks/ comprehensive manual] of the operational methods of fingerprint development. Published by the UK Home Office Scientific Development Branch.</ref> ====Research==== The International Fingerprint Research Group (IFRG) which meets biennially, consists of members of the leading fingerprint research groups from Europe, the US, Canada, Australia and Israel and leads the way in the development, assessment and implementation of new techniques for operational fingerprint detection. One problem for the early twenty-first century is the fact that the organic component of any deposited material is readily destroyed by heat, such as occurs when a gun is fired or a terrorist bomb is detonated, when the temperature may reach as high as 500°C. Encouragingly, however, the non-volatile inorganic component of eccrine secretion has been shown to remain intact even when exposed to temperatures as high as 600°C. A technique has been developed that enables fingerprints to be visualised on metallic and electrically conductive surfaces without the need to develop the prints first.<ref>[http://www.swan.ac.uk/engineering/Research/MaterialsResearchCentre/ResearchAreas/CorrosionandCoatings/ Swansea University], Materials Research Centre, Professor Neil McMurray and Dr Geraint Williams.</ref> This technique involves the use of an instrument called a scanning Kelvin probe (SKP), which measures the voltage, or electrical potential, at pre-set intervals over the surface of an object on which a fingerprint may have been deposited. These measurements can then be mapped to produce an image of the fingerprint. A higher resolution image can be obtained by increasing the number of points sampled, but at the expense of the time taken for the process. A sampling frequency of 20 points per mm is high enough to visualise a fingerprint in sufficient detail for identification purposes and produces a voltage map in 2&ndash;3 hours. As of 2010, this technique had been shown to work effectively on a wide range of forensically important metal surfaces including iron, steel and aluminum. While initial experiments were performed on flat surfaces, the technique has been further developed to cope with irregular or curved surfaces, such as the warped cylindrical surface of fired cartridge cases. Research during 2010 at [[Swansea University]] has found that physically removing a fingerprint from a metal surface, for example by rubbing with a tissue, does not necessarily result in the loss of all fingerprint information from that surface. The reason for this is that the differences in potential that are the basis of the visualisation are caused by the interaction of inorganic salts in the fingerprint deposit and the metal surface and begin to occur as soon as the finger comes into contact with the metal, resulting in the formation of metal-ion complexes that cannot easily be removed. [[Image:fingerprint cartridge.jpg|frame|left|Cartridge case with an applied fingerprint]] [[Image:fingerprint surfer.jpg|frame|right|Scanning Kelvin Probe scan of the same cartridge case with the fingerprint clearly detected. The Kelvin probe can easily cope with the 3D curvature of the cartridge case increasing the versatility of the technique.]] Another problem for the early twenty-first century is that during crime scene investigations, a decision has to be made at an early stage whether to attempt to retrieve fingerprints through the use of developers or whether to swab surfaces in an attempt to salvage material for [[DNA profiling]]. The two processes are mutually incompatible, as fingerprint developers destroy material that could potentially be used for DNA analysis, and swabbing is likely to make fingerprint identification impossible. The application of the new scanning Kelvin probe (SKP) fingerprinting technique, which makes no physical contact with the fingerprint and does not require the use of developers, has the potential to allow fingerprints to be recorded whilst still leaving intact material that could subsequently be subjected to DNA analysis. A forensically usable prototype was under development at Swansea University during 2010, in research that was generating significant interest from the British [[Home Office]] and a number of different police forces across the UK, as well as internationally. The hope is that this instrument could eventually be manufactured in sufficiently large numbers to be widely used by forensic teams worldwide.<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4857114.stm | title = Fingerprints hide lifestyle clues | first = Mark | last = Ward | publisher = BBC |date = April 2006| accessdate = March 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url = http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,31100-1218342,00.html | title = Bombers Tracked By New Technique | publisher = SkyNews |date = April 2006| accessdate = March 2010 }}</ref> ===The disappearance of children's latent prints===
