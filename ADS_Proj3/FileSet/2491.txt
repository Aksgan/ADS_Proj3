set of link-time [[Module (programming)|module]] [[dependency (computer science)|dependencies]] to other modules. In other words, a layer is a group of reusable [[software componentry|component]]s that are [[reusability|reusable]] in similar circumstances. In programming languages, the layer distinction is often expressed as "import" dependencies between software modules. Layers are often arranged in a [[tree (data structure)|tree]]-form [[hierarchy]], with dependency relationships as links between the layers. Dependency relationships between layers are often either [[inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]], [[Object_composition|composition]] or [[Object_composition#Aggregation|aggregation]] relationships, but other kinds of dependencies can also be used. Layers is an [[Architectural pattern (computer science)|architectural pattern]] described in many books, for example Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture<ref>http://hillside.net/patterns/books/Siemens/abstracts.html Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture - A System of Patterns</ref> ==Notes== <references/> ==References== * [[John Lakos]] ''Large-scale C++ software design''.

LFT also listens for various TCP, UDP, and ICMP messages along the way to assist network managers in ascertaining per-protocol [[heuristic routing]] information, and can optionally retrieve various information about the networks it traverses. The operation of layer four traceroute is described in detail in several prominent security books<ref>Extreme Exploits: Advanced Defenses Against Hardcore Hacks (2005) McGraw-Hill ISBN 0-07-225955-8</ref><ref>The Tao of Network Security Monitoring (2004) Addison-Wesley ISBN 0-32-124677-2</ref>. ==Origins== The lft command first appeared in 1998 as 'fft'. Renamed as a result of confusion with [[Fast Fourier transform]]s, lft stands for 'layer four traceroute.' Results are often referred to as a 'layer four trace.' ==External links== * [http://pwhois.org/lft/index.who Layer Four Traceroute Project] == Sources == <references/> {{DEFAULTSORT:Layer Four Traceroute}} [[Category:Network analyzers]] [[de:Layer Four Traceroute]]</text> </page> <page> <id>21300</id> <title>Lazy (Deep Purple song)</title> <text>{{Song infobox | | Name = Lazy | Cover = | Artist = [[Deep Purple]] | Album = [[Machine Head (album)|Machine Head]] | Released = March 1972 | track_no = 6 | Recorded = December 6 - 21, 1971<br/>[[Montreux]], [[Switzerland]] | Genre = [[Hard rock]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[blues-rock]] | Length = 7:23 | Label = [[EMI]] (UK)<br>[[Warner Bros.

A live performance of the song can be found on the album ''[[Made in Japan (album)|Made in Japan]]'', released later the same year. The song starts out as an instrumental, [[keyboardist]] [[Jon Lord]] plays an overdriven [[Hammond organ]] intro, followed by the main riff and with the solo swapping between him and [[guitarist]] [[Ritchie Blackmore]]. [[Vocalist]] [[Ian Gillan]] comes in with the vocals later in the song. He also uses [[harmonica]] both on the studio version and live. At over 7 minutes long, it is the longest track on the album, and live versions were often extended past 10 minutes. The live version on ''[[Made in Japan (album)|Made in Japan]]'' features a theme from [[Hugo Alfv√©n]]'s "Swedish Rhapsody #1", played by Ritchie Blackmore as a part of his solo. Ritchie Blackmore would sometimes include the main riff from "Lazy" in live performances of the song "Man on the Silver Mountain" by [[Rainbow (band)|Rainbow]]. Gillan defined the song as [[rhythm and blues]]. Later live performances after the band's reunion in 1984 tended to be much shorter, cutting out the intro and one of the verses. However, more recent performances with [[Steve Morse]] have gone back to the original arrangement. Readers of Guitar World voted "Lazy" the 74th greatest guitar solo of all time.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://guitar.about.com/library/bl100greatestg.htm |title=Guitar World 100 Greatest Guitar Solos |work=about.com |accessdate=2010-03-25}}</ref> ==Personnel== *[[Ian Gillan]] - [[vocals]], [[harmonica]] *[[Ritchie Blackmore]] - [[electric guitar|guitar]] *[[Roger Glover]] - [[bass guitar|bass]] *[[Jon Lord]] - [[organ (music)|organ]] *[[Ian Paice]] - [[drum kit|drums]] ==References== {{reflist}} {{Deep Purple}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Lazy (Deep Purple Song)}} [[Category:Deep Purple songs]] [[Category:1972 songs]] [[Category:Songs written by Ritchie Blackmore]] [[Category:Songs written by Ian Gillan]] [[Category:Songs written by Roger Glover]] [[Category:Songs written by Jon Lord]] [[Category:Songs written by Ian Paice]] [[fi:Lazy]]</text> </page> <page> <id>21303</id> <title>Lazy (Suede song)</title> <text>{{Infobox single| | Name = Lazy | Cover = Lazy song.jpg | Artist = [[Suede (band)|Suede]] | from Album = [[Coming Up (album)|Coming Up]] | Released = April 7, 1997 | Format = [[CD]] | Recorded = [[1996]] | Genre = [[Britpop]] | Length = 3:19 | Label = [[Nude Records]] | Producer = [[Ed Buller]], Bruce Lampcov | Last single = "[[Saturday Night (Suede song)|Saturday Night]]"<br />(1997) | This single = "'''Lazy'''"<br />(1997) | Next single = "[[Filmstar (song)|Filmstar]]"<br />(1997) }} "'''Lazy'''" is the fourth single off the album ''[[Coming Up (album)|Coming Up]]'' by [[Suede (band)|Suede]], released on April 7, [[1997]] on [[Nude Records]].
