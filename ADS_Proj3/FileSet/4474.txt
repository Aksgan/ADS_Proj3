[[Hacker (computer security)|Hacking]] and [[system cracking]] appeared with the first [[electronics|electronic]] [[computer]]s. Below are some important events in the history of hacking and cracking. ==1930s== ===1932=== * Polish cryptologists: [[Marian Rejewski]], [[Henryk Zygalski]] and [[Jerzy Różycki]] broke the [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|Enigma machine]] code. ===1939=== * [[Alan Turing]], [[Gordon Welchman]] and [[Harold Keen]] worked together to develop the [[Bombe]] (on the basis of Rejewski's works on [[Bomba (cryptography)|Bomba]]). The [[Enigma machine]]'s use of a reliantly small key space makes it vulnerable to brute force and thus a violation of [http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/326.html CWE-326]. ==1960s== ===1965=== * William D. Mathews from MIT found a vulnerability in a [http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/23257 Multics CTSS running on a IBM 7094]. This flaw discloses the contents of the password file. The issue occurred when multiple instances of the system text editor were invoked, causing the editor to create temporary files with a constant name. This would inexplicably cause the contents of the system CTSS password file to display to any user logging into the system. ==1970s== ===1971=== * [[John Draper|John T. Draper]] (later nicknamed Captain Crunch), his friend [[Joybubbles|Joe Engressia]], and [[blue box]] [[phone phreaking]] hit the news with an [[Esquire Magazine]] feature story.<ref name="price">David Price: [http://www.counterpunch.org/price06302008.html Blind Whistling Phreaks and the FBI's Historical Reliance on Phone Tap Criminality] [[CounterPunch]], June 30, 2008</ref> ==1980s== ===1981=== * [[Chaos Computer Club]] forms in [[Germany]]. * '''The Warelords''' forms in The United States, founded by '''Black Bart''' (cracker of Dung Beetles in 1982) in St.
