into directory A. Modified files are left away. * Synchronize A -> B (custom): This is a custom mode to synchronize directory A into directory B mode in which all advanced options could be set up to the users need. * Synchronize B -> A (custom): This is a custom mode to synchronize directory B into directory A mode in which all advanced options could be set up to the users need. When synchronizing bi-directionally (two way), ''DirSync Pro'' detects synchronization conflicts. These conflicts may occur if a file is edited in both directories independently. ''DirSync Pro'' offers these options to solve the bi-directional synchronization conflict: * Copy the latest modified file to both directories. * Copy the largest modified file to both directories. * Rename and copy both files to both directories. * Do nothing and warn the user so he decide himself. [[Linux.com]] rated the application positively, saying that "it makes defining a bidirectional sync as simple as picking two directories".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.linux.com/feature/154149 |title=Bidirectional filesystem syncing - DirSync Pro vs. Unison |publisher=Linux.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-12}}</ref> Likewise, [[freshmeat]] calls it a "powerful, easy-to-configure tool to synchronize the contents of one directory with another".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://freshmeat.net/projects/dirsyncpro |title=DirSync Pro |publisher=freshmeat.net |date= |accessdate=2009-05-12}}</ref> ==External links== *[http://dirsyncpro.org/ DirSync Pro homepage] *[http://sourceforge.net/blog/get-that-syncing-feeling-with-dirsync-pro/ Get that syncing feeling with DirSync Pro] *[http://twitter.com/DirSyncPro DirSync Pro news on twitter] ==References== {{Reflist}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Dirsync Pro}} [[Category:Windows software]] [[Category:Linux archivers and compression-related utilities]] [[Category:Mac OS X software]] [[Category:File copy utility]] [[Category:Software programmed in Java]] [[Category:Free backup software]] {{Storage-software-stub}} [[fr:DirSync Pro]]</text> </page> <page> <id>10544</id> <title>Dirac (program)</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=January 2011}} '''Dirac''' (named after [[Paul Dirac]]) is a relativistic [[Ab initio quantum chemistry methods|ab initio]] [[quantum chemistry]] program. The full name is "Program for Atomic and Molecular Direct Iterative Relativistic All-electron Calculations", in short PAM Dirac. It is capable of calculating various molecular properties using the [[Hartree&ndash;Fock]], [[Møller&ndash;Plesset perturbation theory|MP2]], [[density functional theory]], [[configuration interaction]] and [[coupled cluster]] electronic structure theories. Dirac is one of the most successful general-purpose quantum chemistry packages that provides accurate description of relativistic effects in molecules, using the [[Dirac equation]] as its starting point.<ref>{{cite journal | author = M.

It provides a direct interface between [[application software|applications]] and the [[sound card]] drivers on Windows XP and earlier operating systems, enabling applications to produce sounds and music. Besides providing the essential service of passing audio data to the sound card, it provides many needed capabilities such as recording and mixing sound; adding effects to sound e.g. [[Reverberation|reverb]], [[Echo (phenomenon)|echo]], [[Flanging|flange]]; using hardware controlled buffers for extra speed; positioning sounds in 3D space ([[3D audio effect|3D audio spatialization]]), capturing sounds from a microphone or other input and controlling capture effects during audio capture. DirectSound also allows several applications to conveniently share access to the sound card at the same time. Its ability to play sound in 3D added a new dimension to games. It also provides the ability for games to modify a musical script in response to game events in real time, e.g. the beat of the music could quicken as the action heats up. After many years of development, today DirectSound is a very mature [[API]], and supplies many other useful capabilities, such as the ability to play multichannel sounds at high resolution. While DirectSound was designed to be used by games, a number of professional audio applications now take advantage of its diverse capabilities. ==DirectSound3D== '''DirectSound3D''' (DS3D) is an addition to Microsoft's [[DirectX]] system which is intended to standardize [[3D audio effect|3D audio]] under [[Microsoft Windows]], introduced with DirectX 3 in 1996. DirectSound3D allows software developers to write to a single standardized audio [[Application programming interface|API]] instead of writing code for each audio card manufacturer. In DirectX 5, DirectSound3D has the capability of having sound cards that use third party 3D audio algorithms accelerate DirectSound3D properly, through Microsoft-approved methods. This eliminates the need for separate 3D audio libraries. Starting with DirectX 8 onwards, DirectSound and DirectSound3D (DS3D) are together referred to as '''DirectX Audio'''. ==Windows Vista== Windows Vista features a completely re-written audio [[solution stack|stack]] based on the ''[[Universal Audio Architecture]]''. Because of the architectural changes in the redesigned audio stack, a direct path from DirectSound to the audio drivers does not exist<ref>{{cite web |url=http://techreport.com/articles.x/13874 |title=Techreport article on Vista-ready soundcards |accessdate=2008-12-23}}</ref>. DirectSound and other APIs such as [[MultiMedia Extensions|MME]] are emulated as [[Technical features new to Windows Vista#Audio stack architecture|WASAPI]]
