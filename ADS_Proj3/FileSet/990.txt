''W'''H'''OE'''H'''S'', a 2-5 female; and if ''AS'''W'''CR'''W''''', a 3-6 female. The method was called ''Netz'' (from ''Netzverfahren'', "net method"), or the [[Zygalski sheets|Zygalski sheet method]] as it used perforated sheets that he devised, although at Bletchley Park Zygalski's name was not used for security reasons. Some ten females from a day's messages were required for success. There was a set of 26 of these sheets for each of the six possible sequences ''wheel orders''. Each sheet was for the left (slowest-moving) rotor. The 26 by 26 matrices on the sheets represented the 676 possible starting positions of the middle and right rotors. The sheets were punched with holes in the positions that would allow a female to occur. The set of sheets for that day's messages would be appropriately positioned on top of each other in the [[Perforated sheets|perforated sheets apparatus]]. Rejewski wrote about how the device was operated: {{blockquote|When the sheets were superposed and moved in the proper sequence and the proper manner with respect to each other, in accordance with a strictly defined program, the number of visible apertures gradually decreased. And, if a sufficient quantity of data was available, there finally remained a single aperture, probably corresponding to the right case, that is, to the solution. From the position of the aperture one could calculate the order of the rotors, the setting of their rings, and, by comparing the letters of the cipher keys with the letters in the machine, likewise permutation S; in other words, the entire cipher key.<ref>[[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski]] (1984 e) p. 289</ref>}} ===Polish ''bomba''=== {{main|Bomba (cryptography)}} In about October 1938 [[Marian Rejewski]] invented an electro-mechanical device that was dubbed the [[bomba (cryptography)|''bomba kryptologiczna'']] or ''cryptologic bomb'' <ref>There are various accounts of the source of this name. One is that it originated from the characteristic muffled noise it produced when operating; alternative names puckishly given the device by Polish [[Biuro Szyfrów|Cipher Bureau]] personnel were ''washing machine'' and ''mangle''. Other alternative explanations are that it made a ticking noise, that a part was released to the floor when it was successful and even that it was thought up whilst eating a [[Bombe glacée]].</ref> Each machine contained six sets of Enigma rotors for the six positions of the repeated three-letter key. Like the Zygalski sheet method, the ''bomba'' relied on the occurrence of ''females'', but required only three instead of about ten for the sheet method. The ''bomby''<ref>''Bomby'' is the plural of ''bomba''.</ref> conducted exhaustive ([[Brute force attack|brute-force]]) analyses of the 17,576 rotor positions for each of the six ''wheel orders''. Rejewski has written about the device: {{blockquote|The bomb method, invented in the fall of 1938, consisted largely in the automation and acceleration of the process of reconstructing daily keys. Each cryptologic bomb (six were built in [[Warsaw]] for the [[Biuro Szyfrow|Cipher Bureau]] before September 1939) essentially constituted an electrically powered aggregate of six Enigmas. It took the place of about one hundred workers and shortened the time for obtaining a key to about two hours.<ref>[[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski]] (1984 e) p. 290</ref>}} On 15 December 1938, the German Army increased the complexity of Enigma enciphering. Previously only three rotors had been in use, now two additional rotors were introduced. This increased the number of possible ''wheel orders'' from six to 60.<ref name=Kozaczuk84p54>[[Władysław Kozaczuk|Kozaczuk]] (1984) p. 54</ref> Other Enigma users received the two new rotors at the same time. However, until 1 July 1939 the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (''S.D.''—the S.S. Security Service) continued to use its machines in the old way with a six-letter indicator.<ref name=Kozaczuk84p54/> The Cipher Bureau immediately exploited this discrepancy and by about the turn of the year had worked out the wirings of rotors IV and V. Rejewski wrote, in a 1979 critique of appendix 1, volume 1 (1979), of the official history of British Intelligence in the Second World War: {{blockquote|we quickly found the [wirings] within the [new rotors], but [their] introduction ... raised the number of possible sequences of [rotors] from 6 to 60 ... and hence also raised tenfold the work of finding the keys. Thus the change was not qualitative but quantitative. We would have had to markedly increase the personnel to operate the bombs, to produce the perforated sheets ... and to manipulate the sheets.<ref name=RejewskiHinsleyP80>[[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski]] (1982) p. 80</ref><ref>Also quoted in [[Władysław Kozaczuk|Kozaczuk]] (1984) p. 63</ref> }} Nevertheless, even with Rejewski's bomba and Zygalski's perforated sheets, the new indicator procedure and the increased number of rotors, posed some major problems.<ref>[[Władysław Kozaczuk|Kozaczuk]] (1984) pp. 54–55</ref> These were exacerbated when, on 1 January 1939, the Germans increased the number of plugboard connections from between five and eight to between seven and ten.<ref name=RejewskiAppxC242/> ==World War II== ===Italian naval Enigma=== During the [[Spanish Civil War]], Italy sided with [[Francisco Franco|Franco's]] [[Spanish Civil War#Nationalists|Nationalists]]. The [[Regia Marina|Italian Navy]] used a version of Enigma that did not have a plugboard. In April 1937<ref>[[Andrew Hodges|Hodges]] (1983) p. 176</ref> [[Dilly Knox|Dillwyn "Dilly" Knox]], a gifted British [[cryptanalyst]] veteran of [[World War I]] and the cryptanalytical activities of [[Room 40]], managed to break this cipher, using a technique that he called ''buttoning up'' to discover the rotor wirings<ref name=CarterButtoningUp>{{ Citation | last = Carter | first = Frank | title = Buttoning Up: A method for recovering the wiring of the rotors used in a non-stecker Enigma | url = http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/buttoningup.pdf | accessdate = 20 January 2009 }}</ref> and another that he called ''rodding'' to break messages.<ref name=CarterRodding>{{ Citation | last = Carter | first = Frank | title = Rodding | url = http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/rodding.pdf | accessdate = 20 January 2009 }}</ref> This relied heavily on [[Crib (cryptanalysis)|cribs]] and on a crossword-solver's expertise in Italian, as it yielded a limited number of spaced-out letters at a time. When in 1940 Dilly Knox wanted to establish whether the Italian Navy were still using the same system, he instructed his assistants to use rodding to see whether the crib ''PERX'' (''per'' being Italian for "for" and ''X'' being used to indicate a space between words) worked for the first part of
