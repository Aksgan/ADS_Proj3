/> The music department has a [[handbell]] team, which accompanied the choir's trip one year to Paris. They have also performed at St. Andrew's Church, Eastbourne. The school has a [[steel drum]] group.<br /> With East Sussex Music Service, the school offers tutoring in various musical instruments, to teach pupils during school time. As this service is outside the school, it is charged for. ===Sports Clubs and Teams=== Fencing, football, girls' football, basketball, table tennis and rugby. The school has been active in all of these sports. Teams from Bishop Bell have reached the National Finals in basketball several times over the last few years. ===Drama Productions=== The drama department, since 2006 and the employment of a drama teacher, Mrs. K. Farrier, has annually produced either a play or a musical. These have been [[Bugsy Malone]] (2006), [[The Thwarting of Baron Bolligrew]] (2007), [[Grease (musical)|Grease]] (2008), and [[Christmas Carol]] (2008). The productions have commonly taken place around Easter with two performances each from two casts. The productions have included help from the music, drama and dance departments, with the art department helping to design the set and pupils enlisted to organise and run props, sound and lighting. Grease received particularly bad review as the press labelled it the "single worst performance ever"{{citatation needed}}. ===Other Clubs=== Other clubs include a Philosophy club, revision classes to cater for most of the GCSE subjects, Science club, and a chess club. ==Facilities== A gymnasium, a library with Learning Support Center, dance room, sound-proofed music rooms, Internet Café, 30 classrooms, hall with stage and wings, science laboratories with equipment, several computer rooms. Each classroom is equipped with [[Interactive whiteboard]]s. The registration system is all computer-based. The Bishop Bell Café promotes healthy eating and has vending machines. {{schools in East Sussex}} <references/> [[Category:Mathematics and Computing Colleges in England]] [[Category:Comprehensive schools in East Sussex]]</text> </page> <page> <id>3967</id> <title>Bison occidentalis</title> <text>{{Taxobox | fossil_range = [[Pleistocene]] | regnum = [[Animal]]ia | phylum = [[Chordate|Chordata]] | classis = [[Mammal]]ia | ordo = [[Artiodactyla]] | familia = [[Bovidae]] | subfamilia = [[Bovinae]] | genus = ''[[Bison]]'' | species = '''''B. occidentalis''''' | binomial = ''Bison occidentalis'' | binomial_authority = Lucas, 1898 <ref>{{cite journal |title=Holocene ''Bison occidentalis'' from Iowa |author=Stephen Austin Hall |journal=[[Journal of Mammalogy]] |volume=53 |issue=3 |year=1972 |pages=604–606 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1379052}}</ref> }} '''''Bison occidentalis''''' is an [[extinct]] species of [[bison]] that lived in North America during the [[Pleistocene]]. It probably evolved from ''[[Bison priscus]]''. ''B. occidentalis'' was smaller and smaller horned than the steppe bison. Unlike any bison before it, its horns pointed upward, parallel to the plane of its face from nose to forehead, instead of pointing forward through that plane. Around 5,000 years ago, ''B. occidentalis'' was replaced by today's smaller ''[[Bison bison]]''. It has been theorized that ''B. occidentalis'' declined in numbers because of competition with other grass eaters of the [[megafauna]] epoch.<ref>{{cite book |title=American Bison: A Natural History |last=Lott |first=Dale F. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=0520233387 |pages= |url= }}</ref> ==References==<!-- CanJEarthSci45:827. --> {{reflist}} {{paleo-eventoedungulate-stub}} [[Category:Bison]] [[Category:Prehistoric bovids]] [[Category:Pleistocene mammals]] [[Category:Prehistoric mammals of North America]] [[Category:Holocene extinctions]] [[Category:Megafauna of North America]] [[Category:Fossil taxa described in 1898]] [[ar:بيسون آسيوي]] [[eu:Bison occidentalis]] [[ca:Bison occidentalis]]</text> </page> <page> <id>3968</id> <title>Bispectrum</title> <text>In [[mathematics]], in the area of [[statistical analysis]], the '''bispectrum''' is a statistic used to search for nonlinear interactions. The [[Fourier transform]] of the second-order [[cumulant]], i.e., the [[autocorrelation]] function, is the traditional [[power spectrum]]. The Fourier transform of ''C''<sub>3</sub>(''t''<sub>1</sub>, ''t''<sub>2</sub>) (third-order [[cumulant]]-generating function) is called the bispectrum or '''bispectral density'''. Applying the [[convolution theorem]] allows fast calculation of the bispectrum <math> B(f_1,f_2)=X^*(f_1+f_2).X(f_1).X(f_2)</math>. Bispectra fall in the category of ''higher-order spectra'', or ''polyspectra'' and provide supplementary information to the power spectrum. The third order polyspectrum (bispectrum) is the easiest to compute, and hence the most popular. A statistic defined analogously is the ''bispectral coherency'' or ''bicoherence''. Bispectrum and [[bicoherence]] may be applied to the case of non-linear interactions of a continuous spectrum of propagating waves in one dimension <ref>{{cite journal |author=Greb U, Rusbridge MG |title=The interpretation of the bispectrum and bicoherence for non-linear interactions of continuous spectra |journal=Plasma Phys.

It is intended to integrate features of [[Smalltalk]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], running as a variant of Smalltalk that runs atop any Java [[virtual machine]] conforming to [[Sun Microsystems]]' Java specification. There were no new developments with Bistro since 2002 <ref name="Official Homepage">[http://bistro.sourceforge.net/ Official project page at SourceForge]</ref>. Bistro duplicates the vast majority of the syntax and API for [[Smalltalk]], and introduces the package and import concepts from Java. [[Operator overloading|Overloaded operator]]s are available for certain operators; ''++'' and ''--'' are not available overloaded operators. The syntax for declaring a class's package and import clauses are: :'''package:''' my.package.subpackage; :'''import:''' my.package.MyClass; :'''import:''' my.package.*; One notable exclusion is the ability to import static methods from other classes. ==References== <references/> [[Category:Class-based programming languages]] [[Category:Dynamically typed
