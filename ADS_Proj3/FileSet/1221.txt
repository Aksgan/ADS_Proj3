for safety, testing, and redundancy. A mixture of Windows, [[Mac OSX]] (facilitated by the switch to the [[x86]] processor architecture), and [[Linux distribution|Linux OS]]s (such as Ubuntu) on the same computer can therefore be accommodated. On computers with a single hard disk multi-boot systems require multiple partitions on that hard disk. Each OS requires one or more special types of partitions whose [[file system]] may or may not be compatible with the those of other OSs on the hard disk. Tools to manipulate different types of filesystems may be specific for that type of filesystem. In general, Windows-based filesystem and partition tools have historically been used to manipulate partitions with Windows filesystems but not Linux or Mac OS X partitions. Linux-based partition managers can often (but not always) manage both Linux/Mac OS X and Windows partitions. A particular problem of multi-boot systems is the mutual incompatibility between the [[boot manager|bootloaders]] of different operating systems, which may compete with each other and independently overwrite important settings. When most computers boot up, an [[Master boot record|MBR]] is referenced by the BIOS. This record indicates the partition in which the bootloader to be initially run is located. Each operating system usually attempts to change the MBR so that it points to the partition of the particular bootloader program installed by that OS. In other words, when Windows loads, it changes the MBR to point to the Windows partition in which the Windows bootloader is stored. When Mac OS X loads, it changes the MBR to point to the Mac OS X partition in which the Mac OS X bootloader is stored. When a Linux OS is loaded, it changes the MBR to point to the Linux partition in which the Linux OS bootloader (Grub) is stored. Although all modern OSs include bootloaders that claim to be able to load other OSs as well as the primary OS, in practice this is not guaranteed. Subtle differences in file systems and ongoing changes to the various operating systems can eventually make the bootloaders of each OS unable to recognize the file systems of the competing OSs (and therefore prevent correct bootloading). One or more OSs may then appear to be "unbootable" on that computer. To rectify this, a new bootloader must be installed and configured and the MBR reset to point to the new bootloader. A popular way to circumvent this problem is to install a small, independent "boot" partition (must be a primary partition) in which one specific bootloader is permanently stored. The MBR is then permanently set to always refer to the partition of this primary bootloader (and is never allowed to be changed or to refer to the partition of any other bootloader). This primary bootloader (in the boot partition) loads no OS directly. It merely presents a menu of operating system choices, and when one is chosen, its only function is to chainload the particular secondary bootloader of whichever OS is selected. Each secondary bootloader resides in the partition of the OS to which it belongs, and is ''only used to load its native OS'' (not any other OS). By utilizing this scheme, incompatibilities between different bootloaders, file systems and operating systems are avoided.<ref>[http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Multiple_OS_Installation Ubuntuguide -- Multiple OS installation]</ref> == Partition recovery == When a partition is deleted, in general, only its partition table entry is removed from a table; and although the data is no longer accessible, some still remains on the disk until being overwritten. [[undeletion|Specialized recovery utilities]], (such as [[TestDisk]] and [[gpart]]), can locate ''lost'' file systems and recreate a partition table which includes entries for these recovered file systems. However, some disk utilities may also overwrite a number of beginning sectors of a partition they delete. For example, if Windows Disk Management (Windows 2000/XP, etc.) is used to delete a partition, it will overwrite the first sector (relative sector 0) of the partition before removing it. It may be possible to restore a [[File Allocation Table|FAT32]] or [[NTFS]] partition if a backup boot sector is available. == Compressed disks == Hard disks can be compressed to create additional space. In DOS and early Microsoft Windows, programs such as [[Stac Electronics|Stacker]] (DR-DOS except 6), SuperStor (DR-DOS 6), [[DoubleSpace]], or [[DriveSpace]] (Windows 95) were used. This compression was done by creating a very large file on the partition, then storing the disk's data in this file. At startup, device drivers opened this file and assigned it a separate letter. Frequently, to avoid confusion, the original partition and the compressed drive had their letters swapped, so that the compressed disk is C:, and the uncompressed area (often containing system files) is given a higher name. (SuperStor required a separate device driver to be loaded, DEVSWAP.COM). Versions of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] using the NT kernel, including the most recent versions, XP and Vista, contain intrinsic disk compression capability. The use of separate disk compression utilities has declined sharply. ==See also== {{wikibooks|Guide to Unix|Explanations/Partitioning Disks|Partitioning Disks}} * [[Apple Partition Map]] * [[Boot Camp (software)|Boot Camp]] * [[Booting]] * [[BSD disklabel]] ** [[Slice (disk)]] * [[Disk formatting]] * [[Extended boot record]] * [[File system]] * [[fstab]] * [[GUID Partition Table]] * [[ISO image]] * [[List of disk partitioning software]] * [[Logical volume management]] * [[Master boot record]] * [[RawWrite for Windows]] * [[ROM image]] * [[Volume (computing)]] ==References== <references/> == Further reading == * {{cite paper|url=http://www.jensolsson.se/downloads/AODPS/AODPS.html|title=The Alt-OS-Development Partition Specification (AODPS)|date=2002-11-02|author=St√©phane Martineau, Jens Olsson, Nick Roberts|version=0.4}} * {{cite paper|url=http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/partitions/partition_types-1.html|author=[[Andries Brouwer]]|title=List of partition identifiers for PCs|date=1995&ndash;2004}} * {{cite paper|url=http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/partitions/partition_tables.html|title=Minimal Partition Table Specification|date=1999-09-16|author=Andries Brouwer}} * {{cite paper|url=http://www.ranish.com/part/primer.htm|title=partitioning primer|date=1998-08-05|publisher=Ranish}} * {{cite paper|url=http://www.allensmith.net/Storage/HDDlimit/Address.htm|title=ATA (EIDE) Drive Capacity and Addressing|author=Allen Smith}} * {{cite paper|url=http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/storage/GPT-on-x64.mspx|author=Microsoft|date=2005-06-03|title=Using GPT Drives}} * {{kb|69912|MS-DOS Partitioning Summary}} == External links == <!--========================({{No More Links}})============================ | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.
