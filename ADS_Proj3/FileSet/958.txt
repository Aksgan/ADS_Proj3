The '''XT5h''' (''hybrid'') variant also includes support for [[Cray X2]] [[vector processor]] blades, and Cray XR1 blades which combine Opterons with [[FPGA]]-based Reconfigurable Processor Units (RPUs) provided by DRC Computer Corporation. The '''XT5m''' variant is a mid-ranged supercomputer with most of the features of the XT5, but having a 2-dimensional torus network topology and scalable to 6 cabinets. In the fall of 2008, Cray delivered a 1.3 petaflops XT5 system to [[National Center for Computational Sciences]] at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratories]]. This system, with over 150,000 processing cores, was dubbed "[[Jaguar (computer)|Jaguar]]" and was the second fastest system in the world for the [[LINPACK]] benchmark,<ref>[http://www.top500.org/lists/2008/11 TOP500 November 2008]</ref> the fastest system available for open science and the first system to exceed a [[FLOPS|petaflops]] sustained performance on a 64-bit scientific application.<ref>[http://www.nccs.gov/jaguar/ National Center for Computational Sciences: Jaguar]</ref> Jaguar underwent an upgrade to 224,256 cores in 2009, after which its performance jumped to 1.75 petaflops, taking it to the number one position in the 34th edition of the [[TOP500]] list in fall 2009.<ref>[http://www.top500.org/lists/2009/11 TOP500 November 2009]</ref> It remained number one in the June 2010 edition,<ref name=top500-2010-06>[http://www.top500.org/lists/2010/06 TOP500 June 2010]</ref> but in October 2010 was surpassed by the Chinese [[Tianhe-1A]], which achieved a performance of 2.57 petaflops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11644252|title=China claims supercomputer crown|publisher=BBC News Online|date=28 October 2010|accessdate=29 October 2010}}</ref> Another XT5 system, Kraken, with 99,072 cores and 0.83 petaflops, is currently at position number eight in the [[TOP500]] list as of November 2010.<ref name=top500-2010-06 /> ==References== <references/> ==External links== {{commonscat}} * [http://www.cray.com/products/XT.aspx Cray XT5 product page] * [http://investors.cray.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=98390&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1073071 Cray Introduces Next-Generation Supercomputers] * [http://www.cray.com/Products/XT5/Product/Software.aspx Cray Linux Environment] {{Cray computers}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Cray Xt5}} [[Category:Supercomputers]] {{super-compu-stub}} [[ar:كراي XT5]] [[es:Cray XT-5]] [[it:Cray XT5]]</text> </page> <page> <id>8396</id> <title>CreateDebate</title> <text>'''CreateDebate''' is a user-driven social debating [[website]] which serves to facilitate discourse on topics of users' choosing. CreateDebate combines [[social networking]] technologies with [[Debate|debating]] and [[voting]] in a social and [[Democracy|democratic]] nature. == Details == Users can create a debate about any topic they desire and can link the debate to any media found on the Internet, including text-based articles, images and videos. Users can search and discover debates relevant to their interests, and interact with other CreateDebate users who have common or disparate beliefs. The content on CreateDebate is driven entirely by the user base, and debates that receive the most amount of action become "Most Heated" and end up on the front page. CreateDebate users can cite evidence via links in their arguments from any source on the Internet. All content on CreateDebate is licensed under a [[Creative Commons licenses|Creative Commons license]], allowing for [[freedom of information]] share. == Functionality == The CreateDebate platform provides a structure that lets people see what the best arguments are within each debate, and which side of a debate is winning. People can create two kinds of debates and argue any topic they are passionate about. The CreateDebate community then votes "up" well-conceived arguments and votes "down" flawed logic. Over time, the best arguments rise to the top of the debate, which distills out the central points and most relevant factors. CreateDebate categorizes debates into various topics including: [[Politics]], [[Technology]], [[Shopping]], [[Religion]], [[Travel]], [[Science]], [[World]], [[Sports]], [[Business]], and [[Comedy]], although users can create debates about any topic they are interested in. The creator of the debate, or the Debate Moderator, chooses the title, information, category, and end date of the debate, and has the power to ban users from the debate. CreateDebate is a [[social network]] designed to help groups of people sort through issues, viewpoints, and opinions in an organized manner, so that better decisions can be made. Each user has a [[user profile]], which automatically builds itself over time. "Allies", "Enemies" and "Hostile" relationships are tracked and a news feed provides personalized updates. Debate and arguments activity is also automatically tracked so its easy to find new content. A points system keeps tabs on participation to allow users to identify the top debaters in a number of categories. The research feature allows people to pipe [[RSS]] content from the web into any debate. === Debate Types === There are currently two types of debates available for creation on the site; the 2-Sided Debate and the Perspective Debate. The 2-Sided Debate Consists of two different columns, each representing a viewpoint pertinent to the motion. These "sides" are expressed as the debate creator sees fit, but mostly fall into the categories ''Yes/Agree'' and ''No/Disagree'', relative to the motion. The default argument tags in a 2-sided debate are identical to the side the user posts their argument on, though new tags can be created at users' discretion. A Perspective style debate allows for limitless viewpoints and includes only one column for all arguments. In both types of debate, the Moderator can choose whether the debate will end at a specific point or continue indefinitely. == History == CreateDebate was started by CreateDebate, LLC of [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, VA]]. The private [[beta version]] of the site was launched on February 28, 2008 and the public beta of CreateDebate was introduced on April 29, 2008.<ref>http://mashable.com/2008/04/29/createdebate-argument-made-easy-the-startup-review/</ref><ref>http://www.sarahintampa.com/sarah/2008/05/13/like-to-argue-try-createdebate.html</ref><ref>http://www.centernetworks.com/startup-review-april-30</ref> CreateDebate was founded out of the [[Robert H.
