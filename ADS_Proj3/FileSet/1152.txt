nm to 900 nm, although its continuous spectrum is only from 180 nm to 370 nm. The spectrum intensity does not actually decrease from 250nm to 300nm as shown in the spectrum plot above. The decrease in the plot is due to decreased efficiency at low wavelengths of the photo detector used to measure the lamp intensity. Deuterium Lamp's continuous spectrum is useful as both a reference in UV radiometric work and to generate a signal in various photometric devices. ==Safety== Due to the high intensity of UV radiation emitted by the bulb, eye protection is suggested when using a deuterium bulb. Care must also be taken to avoid touching the bulb directly to avoid burns due to high [[operating temperature]]s. Touching the bulb directly even when cool can smudge the casing and therefore reduce output intensity. ==References== [http://www.photronlamp.com/.assets/deuterium_lamp.pdf Photron Deuterium Lamps] [http://www.photronlamp.com/deuterium-lamps-d2/ Deuterium Lamp Instrument Suitability] {{reflist}} {{ArtificialLightSources}} [[Category:Gas discharge lamps]] [[es:Lámpara de deuterio]] {{Technology-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>10128</id> <title>Devgems Data Modeler</title> <text>{{Multiple issues|advert =June 2009|notability =May 2009|refimprove =May 2009}} {{Infobox Software| name = Devgems Data Modeler | logo = | screenshot = | caption = Devgems Data Modeler | developer = Devgems | genre = | latest_release_version = 1.0 | latest_release_date = | operating_system = [[Windows 2000]], [[Windows XP|XP]] and [[Windows Vista|Vista]] | license = [[Proprietary software|Proprietary]] | website = [http://www.devgems.com www.devgems.com] | }} '''Devgems Data Modeler''' is a [[database design]] software targeting multiple database systems ([[MS SQL Server]], [[Firebird]], and others).

Originally intended to be introduced in the second half of 1998, Device Bay was never finalized and has long since been abandoned. The official website disappeared in mid-2001. Making use of new technologies at the time, such as USB and Firewire, Device Bay was intended to make adding and removing devices from the PC easier, through the use of plug-n-play. It allowed peripherals such as hard drives, CD/DVD-ROM drives, audio devices, and modems, to be added to the PC without having to open the case or even turn the PC off. Devices could also be removed from the PC while it was still turned on; this could also be done through software in the operating system. Another advantage of Device Bay was that it allowed certain devices to be swapped between a desktop and laptop computer. ==References== [http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/cn33197b.htm 404 Error] <!-- link above leads to 404 error.

Through its activities, the company aims to: * Promote best practices in [[Device Management|device management]] and security * Facilitate more effective and efficient use of information, communication and entertainment devices * Help major vendor stakeholder groups market their solutions and services * Help major user stakeholder groups make optimal purchasing decisions * Track and report on major developments in device management and related fields The company engages in a range of activities including: * Providing [http://www.devicemanagement.org '''news and information'''] on device management and related issues * Facilitating discussion forums and workshops * Matching providers of products and service with current and emerging market opportunities * Working with [[Standardization|standards bodies]] and other industry groups to communicate relevant market developments to key stakeholder groups One of the Forum’s major focuses is [[Handheld device|mobile device]] management - the management and [http://www.devicemanagement.org/content/view/66072/152/ '''security of mobile devices'''] such as smartphones and PDAs. Other areas of focus include assessing market developments that impact the requirements for device management and the application of device management technologies beyond telecoms, IT and entertainment. Sponsor Members of the Device Management Forum include Nokia, [[Nokia Siemens Networks]], [http://www.sicap.com/Communication.54.0.html Sicap], Synchronica, Mossec, [http://mobilethink.com '''Mobilethink'''] and Capricode. The Device Management Forum differs from other industry groups such as the [http://www.openmobilealliance.org '''Open Mobile Alliance'''] and the [http://tmforum.org '''Telemanagement Forum'''] in that it does not have standards making within its mandate. Instead, it collaborates with organisations such as the latter in order to achieve its objectives.
