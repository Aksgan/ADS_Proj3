<page> <id>36944</id> <title>Technology forecasting</title> <text>{{citations missing|date=December 2008}} {{cleanup-tone|date=December 2008}} Is [[forecasting]] the future characteristics of useful technological [[machine]]s, [[procedure]]s or [[wikt:technique|techniques]]. ==Important aspects== Primarily, a technological [[forecast]] deals with the characteristics of [[technology]], such as levels of technical performance, like speed of a military aircraft, the power in watts of a particular future engine, the accuracy or precision of a [[measuring instrument]], the number of [[transistors]] in a chip in the year 2015, etc. The forecast does not have to state how these characteristics will be achieved. Secondly, technological forecasting usually deals with only useful machines, procedures or techniques. This is to exclude from the domain of technological forecasting those commodities, services or techniques intended for luxury or amusement. ==Rational and explicit methods== The whole purpose of the recitation of alternatives, is to show that there really is no alternative to forecasting. If a decisionmaker has several alternatives open to him, he will choose among them on the basis of which provides him with the most desirable outcome. Thus his decision is inevitably based on a forecast. His only choice is whether the forecast is obtained by rational and explicit methods, or by intuitive means. The virtues of the use of rational methods are as follows: #They can be taught and learned, #They can be described and explained, #They provide a procedure followable by anyone who has absorbed the necessary training, and in some cases, #These methods are even guaranteed to produce the same forecast regardless of who uses them. The virtue of the use of [[explicit]] methods is that they can be reviewed by others, and can be checked for consistency. Furthermore, the forecast can be reviewed at any subsequent time. Technology forecasting is not imagination. ==Methods of technology forecasting== Commonly adopted methods of technology forecasting include the [[Delphi method]], [[forecast by analogy]], [[growth curve]]s and [[extrapolation]]. Normative methods of technology forecasting &mdash; like the [[relevance tree]]s, [[morphological model]]s, and [[mission flow diagram]]s &mdash; are also commonly used. ==Combining forecasts== Studies of past forecasts have shown that one of the most frequent reasons why a forecast goes wrong is that the forecaster ignores related fields. A given technical approach may fail to achieve the level of capability forecast for it, because it is superseded by another technical approach which the forecaster ignored. Another problem is that of inconsistency between forecasts. Because of these problems, it is often necessary to combine forecasts of different technologies. Therefore rather than to try to select the one method which is most appropriate, it may be better to try to combine the forecasts obtained by different methods. If this is done, the strengths of one method may help compensate for the weaknesses of another. ===Reasons for combining forecasts=== The primary reason for combining forecasts of the same technology is to attempt to offset the weaknesses of one forecasting method with the strengths of another. In addition, the use of more than one forecasting method often gives the forecaster more insight into the processes at work which are responsible for the growth of the technology being forecast. ===Trend curve and growth curves=== A frequently used combination is that of growth curves and a trend curve for some technology. Here we see a succession of growth curves, each describing the level of functional capability achieved by a specific technical approach. An overall trend curve is also shown, fitted to those items of historical data which represent the currently superior approach. The use of growth curves and a trend curve in combination allows the forecaster to draw some conclusions about the future growth of a technology which might not be possible, were either method used alone. With growth curves alone, the forecaster could not say anything about the time at which a given technical approach is likely to be
