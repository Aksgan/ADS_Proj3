"Ergonomic field studies in a nuclear power plant control room". In: ''Progress in Nuclear Energy'', 48, pp. 51-69</ref> states, this is because “…operators use verbal exchanges to produce continuous, redundant and recursive interactions to successfully construct and maintain individual and mutual awareness…”. The immediacy and proximity of trusted team members makes it possible for this to occur. The co-evolution of technology and organizations brings with it an expanding array of new possibilities for novel interaction. Responsible autonomy could become more distributed along with the team(s) themselves. The key to responsible autonomy seems to be to design an organization possessing the characteristics of small groups whilst preventing the ‘silo-thinking’ and ‘stovepipe’ neologisms of contemporary management theory. In order to preserve “…intact the loyalties on which the small group [depend]…the system as a whole [needs to contain] its bad in a way that [does] not destroy its good”.<ref name="ET51p6-9"/> In practice <ref>A. Rice (1958). ''Productivity and social organisation: The Ahmedabad experiment''. London: Tavistock.</ref> this requires groups to be responsible for their own internal regulation and supervision, with the primary task of relating the group to the wider system falling explicitly to a group leader. This principle, therefore, describes a strategy for removing more traditional command hierarchies. ===Adaptability=== Carvajal <ref>R. Carvajal (1983). "Systemic netfields: the systems’ paradigm crises. Part I". In: ''Human Relations'' 36(3), pp.227-246.</ref> states that “the rate at which uncertainty overwhelms an organisation is related more to its internal structure than to the amount of environmental uncertainty”. Sitter in 1997 offered two solutions for organisations confronted, like the military, with an environment of increased (and increasing) complexity: “The first option is to restore the fit with the external complexity by an increasing internal complexity. ...This usually means the creation of more staff functions or the enlargement of staff-functions and/or the investment in vertical information systems”.<ref>Sitter, L. U., Hertog, J. F. & Dankbaar, B., ''From complex organizations with simple jobs to simple organizations with complex jobs'', in: Human Relations, 50(5), 497-536, 1997. p. 498</ref>. Vertical information systems are often confused for 'network enabled capability' systems (NEC) but an important distinction needs to be made, which Sitter et al. propose as their second option: “…the organisation tries to deal with the external complexity by ‘reducing’ the internal control and coordination needs. ...This option might be called the strategy of ‘simple organisations and complex jobs’”. This all contributes to a number of unique advantages. Firstly is the issue of ‘human redundancy’<ref>D.M. Clark (2005). "Human redundancy in complex, hazardous systems: A theoretical framework". In: ''Safety Science''. Vol 43. pp. 655-677.</ref> in which “groups of this kind were free to set their own targets, so that aspiration levels with respect to production could be adjusted to the age and stamina of the individuals concerned”.<ref name="ET51p6-9"/> Human redundancy speaks towards the flexibility, ubiquity and pervasiveness of resources within NEC. The second issue is that of [[complexity]]. Complexity lies at the heart of many organisational contexts (there are numerous organizational paradigms that struggle to cope with it). Trist and Bamforth (1951) could have been writing about these with the following passage: “A very large variety of unfavourable and changing environmental conditions is encountered ... many of which are impossible to predict. Others, though predictable, are impossible to alter.”<ref name="ET51p20-21">[[Eric Trist]] & K. Bamforth (1951). ''Some social and psychological consequences of the longwall method of coal getting'', in: Human Relations, 4, pp.3-38. p.20-21.</ref> Many type of organisations are clearly motivated by the appealing ‘industrial age’, rational principles of ‘factory production’, a particular approach to dealing with complexity: “In the factory a comparatively high degree of control can be exercised over the complex and moving ‘figure’ of a production sequence, since it is possible to maintain the ‘ground’ in a comparatively passive and constant state”.<ref name="ET51p20-21"/> On the other hand, many activities are constantly faced with the possibility of “untoward activity in the ‘ground’” of the ‘figure-ground’ relationship”<ref name="ET51p20-21"/> The central problem, one that appears to be at the nub of many problems that 'classic' organisations have with complexity, is that “The instability of the ‘ground’ limits the applicability […] of methods derived from the factory”.<ref name="ET51p20-21"/> In Classic organisations problems with the moving ‘figure’ and moving ‘ground’ often become magnified through a much larger social space, one in which there is a far greater extent of hierarchical task interdependence.<ref name="ET51p20-21"/> For this reason, the semi-autonomous group, and its ability to make a much more fine grained response to the ‘ground’ situation, can be regarded as ‘agile’. Added to which, local problems that do arise need not propagate throughout the entire system (to affect the workload and quality of work of many others) because a complex organization doing simple tasks has been replaced by a simpler organization doing more complex tasks. The agility and internal regulation of the group allows problems to be solved locally without propagation through a larger social space, thus increasing tempo. ===Whole tasks=== Another concept in sociotechnical theory is the ‘whole task’. A whole task “has the advantage of placing responsibility for the […] task squarely on the shoulders of a single, small, face-to-face group which experiences the entire cycle of operations within the compass of its membership.”<ref name="ET51p6-9"/> The Sociotechnical embodiment of this principle is the notion of minimal critical specification. This principle states that, “While it may be necessary to be quite precise about what has to be done, it is rarely necessary to be precise about how it is done” <ref>A. Cherns (1976). "The principles of sociotechnical design". In: ''Human Relations''. Vol 29(8), pp.783-792. p.786</ref>. This is no more illustrated by the antithetical example of ‘working to rule’ and the virtual collapse of any system that is subject to the intentional withdrawal of human adaptation to situations and contexts. The key factor in minimally critically specifying tasks is the responsible autonomy of the group to decide, based on local conditions, how best to undertake the task in a flexible adaptive manner. This principle is isomorphic with ideas like Effects Based Operations (EBO). EBO
