conjunction with a relatively simple [[GUI|user interface]]. Its simplicity <ref>[http://www.maclife.com/article/cheetah_3d MacLife Review]</ref> is what makes it stand apart from other programs. It was initially released in 2003 <ref>[http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/21398&vid=125105&mode=info Versiontracker.com]</ref>, and is available as a [[Universal binary]] for [[Mac OS X]] <ref>[http://www.macworld.com/article/49508/2006/02/cheetah3d.html MacWorld.com]</ref>. A single user license is $149 [[United States dollar|US]]. A free demo version is available, without the ability to save or export models. ==Features== Cheetah3D is aimed primarily at amateur artists, and so focuses on providing features for creating simple 3D scenes. Its selection of features is narrow but focused to add in its usefulness and simplicity. For example, it supports a variety of geometric primitives, including [[polygon]] meshes and [[Bezier curve]]s. Its features also allow for [[box modeling]] with [[subdivision surfaces]] In addition, it has some simple animation support, including spline-based camera paths and targeted objects. It also supports skeletal deformations, morph targets, and [[subdivision surfaces]], making its character animation effective. The program also has advanced rendering settings, which allow for [[antialiasing]], [[Ray tracing (graphics)|raytraced]] shadows, [[depth of field]], [[High dynamic range imaging|HDRI]], [[ambient occlusion]], [[Caustic (optics)|caustics]] lighting, soft shadowing and photon-mapped caustics. The program uses many of the common 3D file formats, including 3ds, obj, sia, and FBX. Media produced by the program can also be used in [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]], which is a game development tool. Cheetah3D 5.0 was released on 8 October 2009<ref>[http://www.cheetah3d.com/news.php cheetah3d.com/news]</ref>. Added features include a node-based material system, an improved render engine, new modelling tools such as a bevel tool and a bend modifier, and Collada file format support. This version requires at least [[Mac OS X v10.4]], but is also compatible with [[Mac OS X v10.5]] and [[Mac OS X v10.6]]<ref>[http://www.macnn.com/articles/09/09/07/cheetah.3d.update.supports.snow.leopard/ MacNN.com]</ref>. == References == <references/> == External links == *[http://www.cheetah3d.de Official Web Site] *[http://www.cheetah3d.de/forums Cheetah 3D Forums] *[http://unity3d.com Unity 3D] {{DEFAULTSORT:Cheetah3d}} [[Category:3D graphics software]] [[Category:Animation software]] [[Category:Mac OS X-only software]] {{mac-software-stub}} [[ja:Cheetah3D]] [[pt:Cheetah 3D]]</text> </page> <page> <id>6015</id> <title>Chef (software)</title> <text> {{Primary sources|date=July 2009}} {{Infobox software |name = Chef |logo = |screenshot = |caption = |collapsible = |author = [[Opscode]] |developer = |released = |latest release version = 0.9.8 |latest release date = August 5, 2010 |latest preview version = |latest preview date = |frequently updated = |programming language = [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] |operating system = [[GNU/Linux]], [[Unix-like]], [[Windows]] |platform = |size = |language = |status = |genre = [[Configuration management]] |license = [[Apache license]] |website = http://www.opscode.com/chef/ }} '''Chef''' is a configuration management tool written in [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]].

The system was first launched in March 2007 in a beta release form and transitioned to release in March 2008. ChemSpider has expanded the generic support of a chemistry database to include support of the [[Wikipedia]] chemical structure collection via their WiChempedia implementation. ChemSpider was acquired by the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] in May, 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rsc.org/AboutUs/News/PressReleases/2009/ChemSpider.asp|title=RSC acquires ChemSpider |date=11 May 2009|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|accessdate=2009-05-11}}</ref> ==Database== The database contains more than 20 million unique [[molecule]]s from the following sources * '''A-L''': [[EPA DSSTox]], [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), Human Metabolome Database, [[Journal of Heterocyclic Chemistry]], [[KEGG]], [[KUMGM]], [[LeadScope]], [[LipidMAPS]] * '''M-N''': [[Marinlit]], [[MDPI]], [[MICAD]], [[MLSMR]], [[MMDB]], [[MOLI]], [[MTDP]], [[Nanogen]], [[Nature Chemical Biology]], [[NCGC]], [[NIAID]], [[NIH/NLM]], [[NINDS Approved Drug Screening Program]], [[NIST]], [[NIST Chemistry WebBook]], [[NMMLSC]], [[NMRShiftDB]] * '''P-S''': [[PANACHE]], [[PCMD]], [[PDSP]], [[Peptides]], [[Prous Science Drugs of the Future]], [[QSAR]], [[R&D Chemicals]], [[San Diego Center for Chemical Genomics]], [[SGCOxCompounds]], [[SGCStoCompounds]], [[SMID]], [[Specs]], [[Structural Genomics Consortium]], [[SureChem]], [[Synthon-Lab]] * '''T-Z''': [[Thomson Pharma]], [[Total TOSLab Building-Blocks]], [[UM-BBD]], [[UPCMLD]], [[UsefulChem]], [[Web of Science]], [[xPharm]], [[ZINC]] The database can be updated with user contributions including chemical structure deposition, spectra deposition and user curation. ==Searching== A number of available search modules are provided * The ''standard search'' allows [[query]]ing for systematic names, trade names and synonyms and registry numbers * The ''advanced search'' allows interactive searching by chemical structure, chemical substructure, using also molecular formula and [[molecular weight]] range, [[Chemical Abstracts Service|CAS]] numbers, suppliers, etc. The search can be used to widen or restrict already found results. * The ''literature search'' allows text-based searching of almost 1/2 million Chemistry Open Access articles from a dozen different sources including the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]], [[IUPAC]], the [[Journal of Biological Chemistry]], the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]], the [[International Union of Crystallography]] and a number of other publishers. ==Chemistry document mark-up== The ChemSpider database has been used in combination with [[text mining]] as the basis of [[markup language|chemistry document markup]].

The result is an integrated system between chemistry documents and information look-up via ChemSpider into over 150 data sources. ==Commercial versus free== The ChemSpider service is owned by the Royal Society of Chemistry, and its services are offered free of charge. Search hits include both free information and pointers into commercial databases that may require a subscription for access.
