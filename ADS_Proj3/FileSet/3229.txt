name ZENworks was chosen to suggest that network administrators can remove the obstacles and frustrations that prevent users from effortlessly accessing the resources on the network. [Theoretically,] zero effort is required from users. }} </ref> The "Novell Application Launcher" service and executable program-names with the .nal file extension persist. Damon Janis, a Senior Software Engineer at Novell, first conceived of NAL in 1994. The original concept was to use the NetWare Directory as a central repository for [[user object]]s. Novell presented a prototype named "UserNet" at the Novell Brainshare conference in 1994. Soon after the idea of expanding UserNet to include application objects was born. A team of software engineers (Damon Janis, Matt Brooks, and Calvin Gaisford) designed and developed the first production version of NAL, released in late 1995. NAL was well received by the network administrator community and its use and adoption quickly grew. The new name, "ZENworks", first appeared as "Z.E.N.works" in 1998 with ZENworks 1.0<ref> Compare {{cite news | title = Novell Z.E.N. enlightens desktops | first = Ben | last = Heskett | url = http://news.cnet.com/Novell-Z.E.N.-enlightens-desktops/2100-1001_3-208045.html | newspaper = [[CNET News]] | date = 1998-02-11 | accessdate = 2010-08-03 | quote = The company [...] will release an open beta version of its Z.E.N.works (Zero Effort Networks) software suite next month [...], with final shipment due in the second quarter. }} </ref> and with ZENworks Starter Pack - a limited version of ZENworks 1.0 that came bundled with [[NetWare]] 5.0 (1998). Novell added server-management functionality, and the product grew into a suite consisting of: * "ZENworks for Desktops" (ZfD) * "ZENworks for Servers" (ZfS) Novell has continued to add components to the suite, which it sells under the consolidated name "ZENworks Suite". == Capabilities == The ZENworks suite comprises nine packages, available individually. * '''Desktop Management''' (or '''ZDM''' â€” for "ZENworks Desktop Management") allows administrators to install software on, configure, put a hard-disk image on, inventory and remotely troubleshoot Windows-based workstations and laptops from a central location, through use of policy-driven automation. ** Software packages installed via Desktop Management can have self-healing features and can install themselves on demand. ** Desktop Management also supports [[Microsoft Installer|MSI]] packages and [[Group Policy|Group Policies]], despite the common misconception that systems administrators need [[Active Directory|Microsoft Active Directory]] and a Windows server to gain the full benefit of these technologies. ** The Application Explorer utility (<code>nalview.exe</code>) provides a Novell Application Launcher (NAL) view to link applications into Microsoft Windows desktop displays. ** A Zenworks implementation on a desktop machine may include: *** <code>nalagent.exe</code> *** <code>nalntsrv.exe</code> (runs the [[Windows service | NT service]]) *** <code>zenrem32.exe</code> (allows remote users to manage a machine) ** Desktop Management software can operate both inside and outside firewalls. * '''Personality Migration''' consists of a modified version of the DesktopDNA currently owned by [[Computer Associates]]. Administrators can use it to migrate documents and settings from one Windows-based computer to another, regardless of the version of Windows running on either machine. * '''Software Packaging''' comprises a special edition of [[Macrovision]]'s AdminStudio software, which allows administrators to create MSI (installer) packages for distribution. * '''Data Management''', a version of Novell's [[iFolder]] software, allows users to synchronise data in a specified local folder (an iFolder folder on a Windows workstation with iFolder client software installed) with an iFolder server. Users can access iFolder data on the server from within the local network and via the [[Internet]] using iFolder server web interface. (Novell significantly extended iFolder functionality in iFolder 3.0, adding support for Linux workstations and many other features.) * '''Patch Management''' provides automated patch management, allowing administrators to mitigate patch-related security threats by automating the collection, analysis, and delivery of patches throughout an enterprise network. Patch Management includes a subscription to the world's largest repository {{Fact|date=October 2008}} of fully automated patches spanning Windows and many Linux and Unix platforms. Patch deployment takes place rapidly and accurately with wizard-based tools and the ability to continuously monitor to ensure that computers stay patched over time. * '''Linux Management''' initially leveraged the [[Red Carpet (software)|Red Carpet]] software package (ZENworks Linux Management versions up to 6.6.2) which manages [[RPM Package Manager|RPM]] packages installed on [[Linux]] workstations and servers. After a complete rewrite (version 7 and upwards), the tool extended its functionality from Software Management to Asset Management, Policy Enforcement, and System Imaging. {{As of|2008}}, Linux Management handles software installation, updates, and rollbacks with varying degrees of reliability. Novell provides updates with bug-fixes and security patches on [[RPM Package Manager| RPM]]s distributed with its commercial ([[SUSE Linux distributions| SUSE]]) Linux products. * '''Server Management''' allows remotely-located administrators to update, configure and troubleshoot Windows, NetWare, and Linux servers through the use of policy-driven automation. * '''Handheld Management''' allows administrators to remotely update, configure, and inventory [[Palm OS|Palm]], [[Windows CE]], [[PocketPC]] and [[Research In Motion|RIM]] [[BlackBerry]] devices. * '''Asset Management''' handles hardware and software inventories. == Systems supported and required == === Managed platforms and devices === * Desktop Management ** Windows 7 ** Windows Vista ** Windows XP ** Windows 2000 Professional SP4 ** Windows 98 SE * Server Management ** NetWare 5.1, NetWare 6 and NetWare 6.5 ** Novell Open Enterprise Server ** Windows 2000, 2003, 2008 ** SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 8, 9, 10, 11 ** Red Hat Server 2.1 ** Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS 3 and 4 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES 3 and 4 ** Solaris 9 * Linux Management ** Novell Linux Desktop SP1, x86, x86-64 formerly EM64T ** Novell Open Enterprise Server, x86 ** SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 9 SP1 x86, x86-64 formerly EM64T ** SUSE Linux Professional 9.3, x86, x86-64 formerly EM64T ** Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.0 AS, ES, WS and x86 * Handheld Management ** Palm OS 3.5 and later on Palm devices ** Windows CE 2.11 and later including Pocket PC devices ** BlackBerry 850/857 devices using the DataTAC network and BlackBerry 950/957 devices using the Mobitex network ** Synchronized devices, through a Windows 95 and later desktop, or via TCP/IP to the ZENworks
