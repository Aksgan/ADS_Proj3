[http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/Ancient-Africa/mad_ancient_egyptpapyrus.html#berlin] ==1st millennium BC== * 800 BC — [[Baudhayana]], author of the Baudhayana [[Sulba Sutras|Sulba Sutra]], a [[Vedic Sanskrit]] geometric text, contains [[quadratic equations]], and calculates the [[square root]] of 2 correct to five decimal places * ca. 600 BC — the other [[Vedic civilization|Vedic]] “[[Sulba Sutras]]” (“rule of chords” in [[Sanskrit]]) use [[Pythagorean triples]], contain of a number of geometrical proofs, and approximate [[pi|π]] at 3.16 * 5th century BC — [[Hippocrates of Chios]] utilizes [[Lune (mathematics)|lunes]] in an attempt to [[squaring the circle|square the circle]] * 5th century BC — [[Apastamba]], author of the Apastamba [[Sulba Sutras|Sulba Sutra]], another [[Vedic Sanskrit]] geometric text, makes an attempt at [[squaring the circle]] and also calculates the [[square root]] of 2 correct to five decimal places * 530 BC — [[Pythagoras]] studies propositional [[geometry]] and vibrating lyre strings; his group also discover the [[irrational number|irrationality]] of the [[square root]] of [[two]], * 370 BC — [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] states the [[method of exhaustion]] for [[area]] determination * 300 BC — [[Euclid]] in his ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' studies [[geometry]] as an [[axiomatic system]], proves the [[infinity|infinitude]] of [[prime number]]s and presents the [[Euclidean algorithm]]; he states the law of reflection in ''Catoptrics'', and he proves the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] * 260 BC — [[Archimedes]] [[method of exhaustion|proved]] that the value of [[pi|π]] lies between 3 + 1/7 (approx. 3.1429) and 3 + 10/71 (approx. 3.1408), that the area of a circle was equal to π multiplied by the square of the radius of the circle and that the area enclosed by a parabola and a straight line is 4/3 multiplied by the area of a triangle with equal base and height. He also gave a very accurate estimate of the value of the square root of 3. * 225 BC — [[Apollonius of Perga]] writes ''On [[Conic section|Conic Sections]]'' and names the [[ellipse]], [[parabola]], and [[hyperbola]], * 150 BC — [[Jainism|Jain]] mathematicians in [[History of India|India]] write the “Sthananga Sutra”, which contains work on the theory of numbers, arithmetical operations, [[geometry]], operations with [[fractions]], simple equations, [[cubic equations]], quartic equations, and [[permutations]] and [[combinations]] * 140 BC — [[Hipparchus]] develops the bases of [[trigonometry]]. ==1st millennium== * 1st century — [[Heron of Alexandria]], the earliest fleeting reference to square roots of negative numbers. * 250 — [[Diophantus]] uses symbols for unknown numbers in terms of syncopated [[algebra]], and writes ''[[Arithmetica]]'', one of the earliest treatises on algebra * ca. 340 — [[Pappus of Alexandria]] states his [[Pappus's hexagon theorem|hexagon theorem]] and his [[Pappus's centroid theorem|centroid theorem]] * 500 — [[Aryabhata]] writes the “Aryabhata-Siddhanta”, which first introduces the trigonometric functions and methods of calculating their approximate numerical values. It defines the concepts of [[sine]] and [[cosine]], and also contains the [[Aryabhata's sine table|earliest tables of sine]] and cosine values (in 3.75-degree intervals from 0 to 90 degrees) * 600s — [[Bhaskara I]] gives a rational approximation of the sine function * 7th century — [[Brahmagupta]] invents the method of solving indeterminate equations of the second degree and is the first to use algebra to solve astronomical problems. He also develops methods for calculations of the motions and places of various planets, their rising and setting, conjunctions, and the calculation of eclipses of the sun and the moon * 628 — [[Brahmagupta]] writes the ''[[Brahmasphutasiddhanta|Brahmasphuta-siddhanta]]'', where zero is clearly explained, and where the modern [[place-value]] [[Indian numerals|Indian numeral]] system is fully developed. It also gives rules for manipulating both [[negative and positive numbers]], methods for computing [[square roots]], methods of solving [[linear equation|linear]] and [[quadratic equation]]s, and rules for summing [[series (mathematics)|series]], [[Brahmagupta's identity]], and the [[Brahmagupta theorem]] * 700s{{dn}} — [[Virasena]] gives explicit rules for the [[Fibonacci sequence]], gives the derivation of the [[volume]] of a [[frustum]] using an [[infinite]] procedure, and also deals with the [[logarithm]] to [[base 2]] and knows its laws * 700s{{dn}} — [[Shridhara]] gives the rule for finding the volume of a sphere and also the formula for solving quadratic equations * 820 — [[Al-Khwarizmi]] — [[Persian people|Persian]] mathematician, father of algebra, writes the ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing|Al-Jabr]]'', later transliterated as ''[[Algebra]]'', which introduces systematic algebraic techniques for solving [[linear equation|linear]] and [[quadratic equation]]s. Translations of his book on [[arithmetic]] will introduce the [[Arabic numerals|Hindu-Arabic]] [[decimal number system]] to the Western world in the 12th century. The term ''[[algorithm]]'' is also named after him. * 820 — [[Al-Mahani]] conceived the idea of reducing [[Geometry|geometrical]] problems such as [[doubling the cube]] to problems in algebra. * 895 — [[Thabit ibn Qurra]]: the only surviving fragment of his original work contains a chapter on the solution and properties of [[cubic equation]]s. He also generalized the [[Pythagorean theorem]], and discovered the [[Thabit number|theorem]] by which pairs of [[amicable number]]s can be found, (i.e., two numbers such that each is the sum of the proper
