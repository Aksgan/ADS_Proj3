The enabling technology for disintermediation has been the Internet that gave rise to several new [[crowdsourcing]]-based business models, such as employment portals (connect employees and employers), auction portals (connect buyers and sellers), and peer-to-peer lending platforms (connect borrowers and lenders). ===Reliance on social networks=== {{Main|Social network}} Many peer-to-peer lending companies leverage existing communities and pre-existing [[interpersonal relationships]] with the idea that borrowers are less likely to default to the members of their own communities. The risk associated with lending is minimized either through mutual (community) support of the borrower or, as occurs in some instances, through forms of social pressure. The peer-to-peer lending firms either act as middlemen between friends and family to assist with calculating repayment terms, or connect anonymous borrowers and lenders based on similarities in their geographic location, educational and professional background, and connectedness within a given social network. ==Models== Various models and variations of person-to-person lending services have evolved based on different combinations of the following main parameter settings: * Direct vs. indirect lending * Secured vs. unsecured lending * Prior familiarity of lenders and borrowers * Services offered ===Direct vs. indirect lending=== ====Direct lending==== In this model, the lender lends money to one specific borrower based on his/her credit rating; the risk of capital and interest for the lender is that the borrower could default on the loan. Lenders have mitigated this risk by investing small amounts into a large number of loans so that only a small amount of money is loaned to any one person. See also [[Direct_loan|direct loans]]. ====Indirect lending==== In this model (also known as 'pooled lending'), the lender lends the money to several borrowers with similar credit ratings; the risk of capital and interest for the lender is defaulters in the pool. The risk of capital and interest of the lender is reduced considerably because the impact of any one default is made trivial in light of the timely payment of the vast majority of the notes outstanding; both many-to-one or one-to-many credit structures may be involved. This model is very similar to the traditional bank model and does not allow the lenders to select individual borrowers. See also [[pooled investment]]. ===Secured vs. unsecured lending=== ====Secured lending==== In this model, the lender gives money to the borrower against the strength of the collateral given by the borrower. For loans that are originated in the United States it is common to file a [[UCC-1]] form. Each state has a different form. See also [[asset-based lending]]. ====Unsecured lending==== In this model, the lender gives money to the borrower based on the credit rating of the borrower. The lender runs the risk of the capital and interest in case of failure on the part of the borrower. Two variants have evolved in this space. See also [[Direct_loan#Unsecured|unsecured loans]]. ===Prior familiarity of lenders and borrowers=== ====Unfamiliar lenders and borrowers==== In this model (also known as 'marketplace lending'), the lenders and borrowers are previously unacquainted or do not have a prior personal loan agreement. The system enables individual lenders to locate individual borrowers and vice-versa and connects them through an auction-like process in which the lender willing to provide the lowest interest rate "wins" the borrower's loan. The marketplace process may include other intermediaries who package and resell the loans, but the loans are ultimately sold to individuals or pools of individuals. ====Familiar lenders and borrowers==== In ths model (also known as 'family and friend lending'), the lender lends money to a borrower based on their pre-existing personal, family, or business relationship. The model forgoes an auction-like process and concentrates on formalizing and servicing a personal loan. Lenders can charge below market rates to assist the borrower and mitigate risk. Loans can be made to buy homes, personal needs, school, travel
