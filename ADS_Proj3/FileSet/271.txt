(1996), author [[Paul Dickson]] cites a long list of aptronyms originally compiled by Professor Lewis P. Lipsitt, of [[Brown University]]. A sampling from the list: *''James Bugg'', [[pest control|exterminator]] *''Dan Druff'', [[barber]] *''Rev. James R. God'', [[minister of religion|minister]] of the [[Congaree Baptist Church]] in [[Gadsden, South Carolina]] and current minister of Bible Baptist Church in New Bloomfield, Pennsylvania. *''Priscilla Flattery'', [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] [[publicist]] *''[[William Headline]]'', [[Washington, D.C.]] bureau chief for [[CNN]] *''C.

The former [[Archbishop]] of [[Manila]], [[Jaime Sin|Jaime L. Sin]] known as "[[Cardinal Sin]]," is a notable example. [[Lance Armstrong]] became a seven-time Tour de France champion because of leg, not arm, strength. Dickson's book also lists a Rev. Richard Sinner of [[Fargo, North Dakota]]. There was a Roman Catholic Archbishop of Liverpool called Derek Worlock. The British barrister [[Christmas Humphreys]] was not only born on 15 February rather than 25 December, but was known as a [[theosophist]] and later [[Buddhist]]. Actress [[Tuesday Weld]] was born on a Friday. [[Gene Weingarten]] of the [[Washington Post]] has called these "inaptonyms"[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2006/07/11/DI2006071100616.html] Place names can also be aptronyms, perhaps unintentionally, such as the former [[Liberty Jail]], so called because of its location in [[Liberty, Missouri]], [[USA]]. ==Other issues== Aptronyms may be called "aptonyms" by other writers. San Francisco columnist Herb Caen used the term "namephreaks". [[Washington Post]] columnist [[Bob Levey]] prefers the term PFLNs, or Perfect Fit Last Names. There does not yet seem to be a standard terminology for this linguistic curiosity. ==See also== * [[Nominative determinism]] * [[-onym]] ==References== * {{cite encyclopedia |year=2008 |title =aptronym |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/30911/aptronym |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |edition=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |accessdate=2008-07-19 |location= |id= }} * Dickson, Paul.

He was voiced by [[Richard Cansino]] (US), who did an impersonation of [[Sylvester Stallone]] as Rocky, and [[Kenji Nomura]] (Japan). ==Description== [[Image:Hwood.jpg|thumb|left|Human Spirit of Wood]] '''Arbormon''' is the Legendary Warrior of Wood, using the power of [[AncientTroiamon]]. His Beast Hybrid form is '''[[List of Hybrid Digimon#Petaldramon|Petaldramon]]'''. A wooden android Digimon modeled after a [[Karakuri]] puppet, Arbormon is notorious for seemingly randomly giving advice for a good life (this personality trait was not retained in the dubbed version). Arbormon's primary traits are sloth and gluttony, having spent most of the series either trying to find something to eat or sleeping. However, he is fiercely loyal to his allies and his primary goal in fighting the [[DigiDestined]] was to avenge [[Grumblemon]] having his Beast Spirit lost. Arbormon was capable of Slide Evolving to Petaldramon. Ultimately, he fought the DigiDestined on his own and was defeated, whereupon his Beast Spirit was absorbed by [[Kouji Minamoto|Lobomon]]. Immediately afterwards, [[Kouichi Kimura|Duskmon]] appeared and destroyed Arbormon, stating that, without his Beast Spirit, there was really no use for him. After his death, Arbormon's Human Spirit was absorbed by Duskmon. Later on when Koji took the Spirits of Darkness, he also took Arbormon's Spirit (though it wasn't shown clearly). Arbormon's spirits were later transferred into [[Takuya Kanbara|Takuya]]'s D-Tector so he could Hyper Spirit Evolve to EmperorGreymon. A purified Arbormon later appeared at the Village Of Beginnings to help the other legendary warriors fight [[Crusadermon]] and [[Dynasmon]]. '''<u>Attacks</u>''' * '''Roundhouse Punt/Power Pummel''' (''Machinegun Dance''): His legs and arms spin while attached to ropes when he uses them to punch/kick his opponents from long distances. * '''Blockade Seed:''' Fires a seed-like bomb from his mouth which on contact opens up to release several vines that bind up the enemy and drains them of energy.
