Video tapes copied from [[DVD]]s encoded with APS become garbled and unwatchable. The process works by adding pulses to analog video signals to negatively impact the [[automatic gain control|AGC]] circuit of a recording device. In digital devices changes to the analog [[video signal]] are created by a chip that converts the digital video to analog within the device. In [[DVD player]]s trigger bits are created during [[DVD authoring]] to inform the APS that it should be applied to DVD players analog outputs or analog video outputs on a [[personal computer|PC]] while playing back a protected DVD-Video disc. In [[set top box]]es trigger bits are incorporated into [[Conditional Access Entitlement Control Message]]s (ECM) in the stream delivered to the STB. In VHS alterations to the analog video signal are added in a [[Macrovision]]-provided “processor box” used by duplicators. APS can be also signaled digitally, in the [[CGMS-A]] bit field sent in the [[vertical blanking interval]]. ==Sources== *Smart Computing Dictionary Entry, ''Analog Protection System'' (2005). http://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/dictionary/detail.asp?guid=&searchtype=1&DicID=15636&RefType=Dictionary *Macrovision, ''Analog Protection System: A Presentation to the Analog Reconversion Discussion Group'' (2003). http://www.eff.org/IP/DMCA/Macrovision_v_321Studios/20030320_Macrovision_APS.pdf [[Category:Digital rights management]] [[Category:DVD]]</text> </page> <page> <id>1787</id> <title>Analogical models</title> <text>'''Analogical models''' are a method of representing a phenomenon of the world, often called the ‘target system’ by another, more understandable or analysable system. They are also called '''dynamical analogies'''. == Explanation == [[Analogy|Analogizing]] is the process of representing information about a particular subject (the analogue or source system) by another particular subject (the target system). A simple type of analogy is one that is based on shared properties (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy). Analogical models, also called "analog" or "analogue" models, therefore seek the analog systems that share properties with the target system as a means of representing the world. It is often practicable to construct source systems that are smaller and/or faster than the target system so that one can deduce ''[[a priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]]'' [[knowledge]] of target system behaviour. Analog devices are therefore those in which may differ in substance or structure but share properties of dynamic behaviour (Truit and Rogers, p. 1-3). {{cquote|dynamical analogies establish the analogies between electrical, mechanical, acoustical, magnetic and electronic systems}} (Olson 1958, p. 2). For example, in analog electronic circuits, one can use [[voltage]] to represent an arithmetic quantity; [[operational amplifier]]s might then represent the arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).Through the process of [[calibration]] these smaller/bigger, slower/faster systems are scaled up or down so that they match the functioning of the target system, and are therefore called analogs of the target system. Once the calibration has taken place, modellers speak of a ''one-to-one correspondence in behaviour'' between the primary system and its analog. Thus the behaviour of two systems can be determined by experimenting with one. <!--This doesn't seem right. Is the "model" the "target system" or the "analogue/source system"? It seems that Stanford encyclopedia and Wikipedia do not mesh!--> == Creating an analogical model == Many different instruments and systems can be used to create an analogical model. A mechanical device can be used to represent mathematical calculations. For instance, the [[Phillips Hydraulic Computer]] used the flow of water to model economic systems (the target system); electronic circuits can be used to represent both physiological and ecological systems. When a model is run on either an analog or digital computer this is known as the process of [[simulation]]. <!--EXAMPLES WE NEED EXAMPLES!! --> ==Mechanical analogies== <!--Needs to be filled--> {{Empty section|date=July 2010}} ==Hydraulic analogy== * In an [[hydraulic]] analogy, a [[water integrator]] might be used to perform the mathematical operation of [[Integral|integration]]. ==Physiological analogies== *[[Francis Crick]] used the study of the [[visual system]] as a proxy for the study of [[awareness]]. ==Formal analogies== <!--Needs to be filled--> *"The same [[equation]]s have the same [[solution]]s." -- [[Richard Feynman]] **For example, the inverse-square laws of [[gravitation]] and [[electromagnetism]] can be described by analogous equations on a geometrical basis, almost without regard to the physical details about [[mass]]es and [[charge (physics)|charges]]. *[[Recursion]] requires a similarity within a situation; for example, [[Archimedes]] used the [[myriad]] to count the [[The Sand Reckoner|number of grains of sand on a beach]] by using the concept of myriad myriads. == Dynamical analogies == Arising from his pioneering work in the field of acoustical engineering research, in 1958 (pp. 27–29) Dr. [[Harry F. Olson]] published a book of [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamical]] analogies that includes a table of equivalent elements in different systems such as electrical, acoustical, and mechanical systems. He claimed that the analogies presented would aid in solving various problems of dynamical systems and would help the analysis describing the performance of such systems. ===Table of equivalents=== {|class="wikitable" |- !!!Electrical!!!!!!Mechanical Rectilineal!!!!!!Mechanical Rotational!!!!Acoustical!!Economic |- !Quantity!!Symbol!!Dimension!!Quantity!!Symbol!!Dimension!!Quantity!!Symbol!!Dimension | |- !Current |i||||Linear velocity||||||||||||||| |- !emf |e||<math> \frac{Lq}{t^2} </math>|| |- !Electrical resistance |r<sub>e</sub>||||Mechanical resistance|||||||||||||||Resistance to consume |- !Electrical Capacitance |C<sub>E</sub>||t<sup>2</sup>/L||Compliance||||||||||||||Savings(Credit) |- !Energy |W<sub>E</sub>||Lq<sup>2</sup>t<sup>-2,</sup>||.||||||||||||||Output |- !Power |P<sub>E</sub>||Power|||||||||||||||||Production(Consumption) |- |} ==Electronic circuit analogies== === Hydraulic Analog === A fluid or [[Hydraulic analogy]] of an electric circuit attempts to explain circuitry in terms of plumbing, where water represents the mobile sea of charge within metals, where pressure difference is analogy for [[Voltage]], and where water's flow rate is an analogy for [[Electric current]]. === Analogue computers === Electronic circuits were used to model and simulate engineering systems such as aeroplanes and nuclear power plants before digital computers became widely available with fast enough turn over times to be practically
