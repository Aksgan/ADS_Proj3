exchangeable over communication links among users. The separate worlds of consumer electronics (e.g., stereo sets, VCRs, televisions) and computers are partially merging. Computer and print worlds are expected to cross-assimilate each other. *'''High-[[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] interaction'''. The rate at which humans and machines interact is expected to increase substantially due to the changes in speed, computer graphics, new media, and new input/output devices. This can lead to some qualitatively different interfaces, such as [[virtual reality]] or computational video. *'''Large and thin [[displays]]'''. New display technologies are finally maturing, enabling very large displays and displays that are thin, lightweight, and low in power consumption. This is having large effects on portability and will likely enable the development of paper-like, pen-based computer interaction systems very different in feel from desktop workstations of the present. *'''Information Utilities'''. Public information utilities (such as home banking and shopping) and specialized industry services (e.g., weather for pilots) are expected to proliferate. The rate of proliferation can accelerate with the introduction of high-bandwidth interaction and the improvement in quality of interfaces. ==Academic conferences== {{Linkfarm|date=January 2011}} One of the top academic conferences for new research in human-computer interaction, especially within [[computer science]], is the annually held [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]'s [[CHI (conference)|Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems]], usually referred to by its short name CHI (pronounced ''kai'', or ''khai''). CHI is organized by [http://www.acm.org/sigchi/ ACM SIGCHI] Special Interest Group on Computer–Human Interaction. CHI is a large, highly competitive conference, with thousands of attendants, and is quite broad in scope. There are also dozens of other smaller, regional or specialized HCI-related conferences held around the world each year, the most important of which include (see also [http://www.confsearch.org/confsearch/faces/pages/topic.jsp?topic=hci&sortMode=1&graphicView=true]): ====Special purpose==== * [http://www.sigaccess.org/ ASSETS]: ACM International Conference on Computers and Accessibility * [http://www.cscw2011.org/ CSCW]: ACM conference on [[Computer Supported Cooperative Work]]. * [http://www.dis2010.org/ DIS]: ACM conference on Designing Interactive Systems. * [http://www.ecscw.org/ ECSCW]: European Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work.
