The AQMG serves as the focal point on air pollution modeling techniques for other EPA headquarters staff, EPA regional Offices, and State and local environmental agencies. It coordinates with the EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) on the development of new models and techniques, as well as wider issues of atmospheric research. Finally, the AQMG conducts modeling analyses to support the policy and regulatory decisions of the EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS). The AQMG is located in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. ==Projects maintained by the AQMG== The AQMG maintains the following specific projects: * Air Quality Analyses to Support Modeling * [http://www.epa.gov/scram001/guidanceindex.htm Air Quality Modeling Guidelines] * Dispersion Modeling Computer Codes * [http://www.epa.gov/scram001/dispersionindex.htm Dispersion Modeling] * Emissions Inventories For Regional Modeling * Guidance on Modeling for New NAAQS & Regional Haze * Meteorological Data Guidance and Modeling * [http://www.epa.gov/scram001/guidance_clearinghouse.htm Model Clearinghouse] * [http://www.epa.gov/asmdnerl/CMAQ/index.html Models-3/Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ)] * Models3 Applications Team, Outreach and Training Coordination * Multimedia Modeling * PM Data Analysis and PM Modeling * [http://www.epa.gov/scram001/dispersion_prefrec.htm Preferred/Recommended Models] [http://www.epa.gov/scram001/dispersion_alt.htm Alternative Models] [http://www.epa.gov/scram001/dispersion_screening.htm Screening Models] * Regional Ozone Modeling * Roadway Intersection Modeling * [http://www.epa.gov./scram001/ Support Center For Regulatory Air Models (SCRAM)] * Urban Ozone Modeling * Visibility and Regional Haze Modeling ==See also== *[[Accidental release source terms]] *[[Bibliography of atmospheric dispersion modeling]] *[[Environment Agency#The Air Quality Modelling and Assessment Unit .28AQMAU.29|Air Quality Modelling and Assessment Unit (AQMAU)]] *[[Air Resources Laboratory]] *[[AP 42 Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors]] *[[Atmospheric dispersion modeling]] *[[Atmospheric Studies Group]] *[[:Category:Air dispersion modeling]] *[[List of atmospheric dispersion models]] *[[Met Office]] *[[UK Atmospheric Dispersion Modelling Liaison Committee]] *[[UK Dispersion Modelling Bureau]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==Further reading== *{{cite book | author=Turner, D.B. | title=Workbook of atmospheric dispersion estimates: an introduction to dispersion modeling| edition=2nd Edition| publisher=CRC Press | year=1994 | isbn=1-56670-023-X }} [http://www.crcpress.com/shopping_cart/products/product_detail.asp?sku=L1023&parent_id=&pc= www.crcpress.com] *{{cite book | author=Beychok, M.R. | title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]| edition=4th Edition| publisher=self-published | year=2005 | isbn=0-9644588-0-2}} [http://www.air-dispersion.com www.air-dispersion.com] ==External links== * [http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/environment/serv4.html UK Dispersion Modelling Bureau web site] * [http://www.admlc.org.uk/index.htm UK ADMLC web site] * [http://www.arl.noaa.gov/ Air Resources Laboratory (ARL)] * [http://www.epa.gov/oar/oaqps/organization/aqad/aqmg.html Air Quality Modeling Group] * [http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/ Met Office web site] * [http://www.air-dispersion.com/feature.html Error propagation in air dispersion modeling] [[Category:Air dispersion modeling]] [[Category:Air pollution in the United States]] [[Category:United States Environmental Protection Agency]]</text> </page> <page> <id>1262</id> <title>Air cooling</title> <text>[[File:Cooler Master V8.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A [[Cooler Master]] V8 has a lot of [[heatpipe]]s.]] '''Air cooling''' is a method of dissipating [[heat]]. It works by making the object to be cooled have a larger surface area or have an increased flow of air over its surface, or both. An example of the former is to add [[heatsink |fin]]s to the surface of the object, either by making them integral or by attaching them tightly to the object's surface (to ensure efficient heat transfer). In the case of the latter it is done by using a [[fan (mechanical)|fan]] blowing [[air]] into or onto the object one wants to cool. In many cases the addition of fins adds to the total surface area making a [[heatsink]] that makes for greater efficiency in cooling. In
