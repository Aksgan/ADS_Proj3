An agency of psychic effect which exists and takes form on the pre-physical realms of existence, which acts in accord with the Intent of its creator(s).<ref> {{cite web | last = | first = | title = The World Mind Society Library | url=http://www.eoni.com/~visionquest/library/glossary.html | accessdate = 2007-02-26 }}</ref> *A living spiritual being created by humans.

They are created by everyone every moment (in some formulations they are everyone every moment); and they possess wills of their own. ==Thoughtforms and Annie Besant== [[Thought Forms]] is a book by [[Annie Besant]] and [[C.W. Leadbeater]] that studies the nature and power of [[thought]]s (ISBN 0-8356-0008-4). It states that thoughts have two effects: "a radiating [[oscillation|vibration]] and a floating form". Thought forms are divided into three classes: *That which takes the image of the thinker. *That which takes the image of some [[material]] [[Object (philosophy)|object]]. *That which takes a form entirely its own, expressing its inherent qualities in the [[matter]] which it draws round it. The effect of [[music]], [[emotions]], and [[colors]] on thought forms is also studied in the book. The effect of the music of [[Mendelssohn]] (No. 9 of his "Songs without words"), [[Gounod]] (Soldiers Chorus from "Faust") and [[Richard Wagner]] (Overture to "The Meistersingers") is studied. The music of Wagner produced a "marvellous mountain-range" on the thought forms. ==Thoughtform in popular culture== {{Trivia|date=February 2008}} Many authors and artists have since used tulpas in their works, both in the context of fiction and in writing about mysticism. Horror author [[Clive Barker]], for example, envisioned his famous "[[Candyman (slasher)|Candy Man]]" killer to be nothing more than a myth gone terribly awry in his original story. ===Television=== * In the ''[[The X-Files|X-Files]]'' episode ''[[The X-Files (season 6)#Arcadia|Arcadia]]'' (6X13), the president of the homeowners' association for an exclusive gated community uses a tulpa to enforce the neighborhood rules; those who repeatedly violate the guidelines meet a grisly fate at its hands. * The ''[[Supernatural (TV series)|Supernatural]]'' episode ''Hell House'' (1.17) features a haunted house in which the resident malevolent spirit turns out to be a tulpa, created when the beliefs of thousands of website visitors are focused through a Tibetan [[Sigil (magic)|sigil]] painted on one wall of the house. * In the ''[[So Weird]]'' episode ''PK (or Tulpa)''. Fi meets a little boy who is troublesome and it is caused because of a Tulpa he creates. He thinks it is an [[imaginary friend]] but Fi tells him it's some type of energy he created and helps him solve it. * In ''Tears of Kali'' by [[Andreas Marschall]], an entity becomes an evil murderer that can't be controlled. *In ''[[Paranoia Agent]]'', the character [[Characters from Paranoia Agent#Li.27l Slugger|Lil' Slugger]] (Shonen Bat) is revealed to have materialized thanks to the growing hysteria caused when [[Tsukiko Sagi]] claimed he attacked her. *''The Tulpa'' is a [[Canadian]] [[short film]].<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0466498/ The Tulpa (2005)]</ref> ===Literature=== * In ''Nightingale's Lament'' by [[Simon R. Green|Simon Green]], a tulpa in the image of John Taylor's client is sent after him at one point, tracking him by a hair the client left on his jacket; it disappears when the hair is destroyed. * In ''Every Which Way But Dead'' by [[Kim Harrison]], 'Tulpa' is the focus word used to create a three-dimensional circle in the main character, Rachel Morgan's imagination, and is used to hold an overflow of power. * In ''[[American Gods]]'' by [[Neil Gaiman]], various deity-like beings are created through cultural belief, a certain society's perception of, say, Odin, creating a form of that god particular to that society. * In ''[[It (novel)|It]]'' by [[Stephen King]], the eponymous entity's various manifestations are given form and power by the belief of the townspeople. *In ''Outcast'' by [[Lynne Ewing]], the main character, Kyle, is confronted and pestered by a tulpa of his own creation, that convinces him that he is his lost twin brother. *In [[Grant Morrison]]’s [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] [[limited series]] ''[[Fantastic Four: 1234]]'' (2002) [[Reed Richards]] muses on a fictitious journey to [[Tibet]] where, with the help of [[Bön]] priest, he creates a Tulpa, a “thoughtform”. After Richards names it ‘Victor’ the Tulpa takes on a life of its own, becoming Richards’ opposite number. This was an alternative, fantastical, origin for Richards’ arch enemy [[Dr Doom]] (aka Victor Von Doom). *According to the book ''The Teachings of Don Juan Matus'', a Mexican shaman by the name of [[Don Juan Matus]], who had taught his student [[Carlos Castaneda]], the books author, about the true nature of the physical universe and how intense concentration can summon, [[apport]], and even materialize objects out of thin air. It was said that [[Carlos Castaneda]] was able to materialize a living squirrel on the palm of Don Juan's hand based on the latter's instruction.<ref>The Teachings of Don Juan Matus</ref> Many of his claims have been disputed by members of the [[Anthropology|anthropological]] profession.<ref>[http://peyote.com/carlos-castaneda/academia.html PEYOTE'S HALLUCINATIONS SPAWN REAL-LIFE ACADEMIC FEUD]</ref> * In ''Secrets & Mysteries of the World'' by [[Sylvia Browne]], chapter 7: Tulpas, explains brief story of old Tulpas and new Tulpas from England. * In ''The Mothman Prophecies'' by John A.
