He completed his Bachelor's and Master's degrees in [[electrical engineering]] in 1962. Continuing his studies at MIT, he finished his Ph.D. in electrical engineering in 1964; his advisors were [[Claude Shannon]], [[Robert G. Gallager]], [[Peter Elias]] and [[John Wozencraft]]. Berlekamp taught at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] from 1964 until 1966, when he became a researcher at [[Bell Labs]]. In 1971, Berlekamp returned to Berkeley, where, as of 2010, he is a Professor of the Graduate School.<ref name=44a /><ref name=ucb /><ref name=43a>[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22678 Contributors], ''IEEE Transactions on Information Theory'' '''20''', #3 (May 1974), p. 408.</ref> As of 2008, he was the only member of the mathematics faculty who did not possess a degree in mathematics. Berlekamp is one of the inventors of the Welch-Berlekamp and [[Berlekamp-Massey algorithm]]s, which are used to implement [[Reed-Solomon error correction]]. In the mid-1980s, he was president of [[Cyclotomics, Inc.]], a corporation which developed error-correcting code technology.<ref name=44a /> With [[John Horton Conway]] and [[Richard K. Guy]], he co-authored ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]'', leading to his recognition as one of the founders of [[combinatorial game theory]]. He has studied various games, including Fox and Geese and other [[fox games]], [[dots and boxes]], and, especially, [[go (game)|Go]]. With [[David Wolfe (mathematician)|David Wolfe]], Berlekamp co-authored the book ''Mathematical Go'', which describes methods for analyzing certain classes of Go endgames. Outside of mathematics and computer science, Berlekamp has also experienced tremendous success in [[money management]]. In 1986, on behalf of [[Axcom Trading Advisors]], a futures trading company, Berlekamp began information-theoretic studies of commodity and financial futures. In 1989, Berlekamp owned the largest interest in Axcom. After the firm's futures trading algorithms were rewritten, Axcom's flagship fund had a return (in 1990) of 55%, net of all management fees and transaction costs. Today, this fund is known as the [[Medallion Fund]] and is managed by [[James Harris Simons]] and his [[Renaissance Technologies]] Corporation.<ref>[http://math.berkeley.edu/~berlek/fineng.html Financial Engineering], Elwyn Berlekamp's Home Page.

The Elxsi processor was an [[Emitter Coupled Logic]] (ECL) design that featured a 50 nanosecond clock, a 25 nanosecond backpanel bus, [[IEEE floating point]] arithmetic and a [[64-bit]] architecture. It allowed multiple processors to communicate over a common bus called the Gigabus. The [[operating system]] was a message based operating system called [[EMBOS]]. The Elxsi [[CPU]] was a [[microcode]]d design, allowing custom instructions to be coded into microcode. == History == Elxsi was founded in 1979 by Joe Rizzi who had been a manager at [[Intersil]]. Much of the architecture of the Elxsi machine was designed by former Stanford University professors Len Shar and Balasubrimanian Kumar. Another key contributor to the design was Harold (Mac) McFarland, who was also a key designer on the team that created the [[PDP-11]]. George Taylor (on the [[IEEE]] standard committee and a student of Cal Berkeley Professor [[William Kahan]]) provided a key design for the IEEE floating point unit. Elxsi was bought out by [[Gene Amdahl]] with money that was left over from the Trilogy venture. Venture investors in Elxsi included [[Tata Group]] (India)
