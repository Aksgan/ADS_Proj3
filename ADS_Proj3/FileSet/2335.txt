At Battelle, and later at Virginia and George Mason universities, he developed the sociotechnology of Interpretive Structural Management and the rules of Interactive Management (the precursor of [[Structured dialogic design]]). He has been elected President of the Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and of the [[International Society for the Systems Sciences]] (formerly called the Society for General Systems Research). He served as Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics from 1968 to 1971, and as founding Editor-in-Chief of the Pergamon journal ''Systems Research'', during the period 1981-1990. Warfield is a member of the Academic Committee of the International Encyclopedia of Systems and Cybernetics. He is a Life Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and holds that organization's Centennial Medal. He is a member of the Association for Integrative Studies. In 2006 John N. Warfield was awarded the Joseph G. Wohl Award for Career Achievement at the 2006 annual meeting of the IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society. This is the highest award given by the society, and is not awarded every year. He was awarded for his contributions to systems engineering concepts, methodology, design, education and management. Warfield was also awarded the IEEE Third Millennium Medal. == Publications == Warfield is the author of eight books and about 100 papers.<ref> [http://www.gwu.edu/~asc/warfield/publications.html LIST OF PUBLICATIONS]: Complete list of publications of John N.

Paraskevopoulos</title> <text>'''John Stefanos Paraskevopoulos''' (June 20, 1889 &ndash; March 15, 1951) was a Greek/South African [[astronomer]]. He was born in [[Piraeus]], [[Greece]] and graduated from the [[University of Athens]]. He served in the Greek army during the [[Balkan Wars]] and [[World War I]]. In 1919, he went to America for two years, spending part of that time working at [[Yerkes Observatory]] where he met and married Dorothy W. Block. In 1921, he returned to Athens where he became head of the [[Athens Observatory]]. He left this post due to a lack of funding and went to [[Arequipa]], [[Peru]] to work at Boyden Station, a branch of [[Harvard Observatory]], with a view to finding a more suitable location for it. The decision was made to move Boyden Station to [[South Africa]] due to better weather conditions, and Paraskevopoulos served there as director of [[Boyden Observatory]] in [[South Africa]] from 1927 to 1951. He co-discovered a couple of [[comet]]s. The crater [[Paraskevopoulos (crater)|Paraskevopoulos]] on the [[Moon]] is named after him. ==External links== ===Obituaries=== * [http://adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/JRASC/0045//0000126.000.html JRASC '''45''' (1951) 126] (one paragraph) * [http://adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/MNRAS/0112//0000277.000.html MNRAS '''112''' (1952) 277] * ''Nature'' '''167''' (1951) 753 * [http://adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/Obs../0071//0000088.000.html Obs '''71''' (1951) 88] (one line) * [http://adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/PASP./0063//0000212.000.html PASP '''63''' (1951) 212] (one paragraph) * ''Sky and Telescope'' '''10''' (1951) 169 {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME = Paraskevopoulos, John Stefanos | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH = June 20, 1889 | PLACE OF BIRTH = | DATE OF DEATH = March 15, 1951 | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Paraskevopoulos, John Stefanos}} [[Category:1889 births]] [[Category:1951 deaths]] [[Category:People from Attica]] [[Category:Harvard University staff]] [[Category:University of Athens alumni]] [[Category:Greek astronomers]] [[Category:South African astronomers]] [[Category:20th-century astronomers]] {{Euro-astronomer-stub}} {{Greece-scientist-stub}} {{SouthAfrica-scientist-stub}} [[de:John Stefanos Paraskevopoulos]] [[es:John S.
