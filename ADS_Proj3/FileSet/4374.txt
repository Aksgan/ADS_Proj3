supplanted by a successor approach. With the trend curve alone, the forecaster could not say anything about the ability of a specific technical approach to meet the projected trend, or about the need to look for a successor approach. Thus the need for combining forecasts. ===Identification of consistent deviations=== Another frequently used combination of forecasts is that of the trend curve and one or more analogies. We customarily consider the scatter of data points about a trend curve to be due to random influences which we can neither control nor even measure. However, consistent deviations may represent something other than just random influences. Where such consistent deviations are identified, we may have an opportunity to apply an analogy. Typical events which bring about deviations from a trend are wars and depressions. Thus the purpose of combining analogies with a trend forecast is to predict deviations from the trend deviations which are associated with or caused by external events or influences. As with other uses of analogy, it is important to determine the extent to which the analogy between the event used as the basis for the forecast, and the historical model event, satisfies the criteria for a valid analogy. ===Forecasts of different technologies=== Combining forecasts of different technologies may be even more important than combining the forecasts of the same technology. One reason for this is the fact that technologies may interact or be interrelated in some fashion. Another reason for this is that of consistency in an overall picture or scenario. One of the simplest examples of interacting trends is the projection to absurdity, i.e. simply projecting the given data indefinitely without getting any specific result. For instance, if one simply projects recent rates of growth of world population, one arrives at some fantastic conclusions about the density of population in a particular place by various dates in the next millennium. Some other trends which can confidently be expected to not continue indefinitely are: #Annual production of scientific papers. #Number of automobiles per capita. #[[Watt-hour|Kilowatt hours]] of electricity generated annually. Another instance of interacting trends was in the case of the number of scientists in the U.S. growing faster than the overall population. Since 1940s through the 1960s, science as an activity in the United States grew exponentially. The number of dollars spent on R&D was growing faster than the GNP (in the 1960s). If projected indefinitely, these two curves would give the result that eventually every person in the U.S. would be working as a scientist and the entire GNP would be devoted to R&D alone, which are however absurd conclusions. Thus it is clear that the scientific discipline of technology forecasting is not mere trend extrapolation but also involves combining forecasts. ==Uses in manufacturing== Almost all modern manufacturing firms utilize the services of a technological forecaster. Nevertheless, there are a number of alternatives to the rational and explicit forecasting of technology, such as 'no forecast', 'anything can happen' (i.e. relying on pure chance), 'window-blind forecasting', 'genius forecasting' and boasting of a 'glorious past' (i.e. adopting the same old techniques). Thus technological forecasting is not mere astrology or palmistry, but a scientific and well defined procedure adopted by a technological forecaster or a consultancy for the forecasting of a particular technology. Even though technological forecasting is a scientific discipline, some experts are of the view that "the only certainty of a particular forecast is that it is wrong to some degree." ==Leading Forecasting Institutes== *[[TechCast Project]] *[[Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence]] *[[Future of Humanity Institute]] ==See also== *[[Delphi method]] *[[Forecasting]] *[[Futurology]] *[[List of emerging technologies]] *[[Optimism bias]] *[[Reference class forecasting]] *[[Strategic Foresight]] *[[Technology Scouting]] *[[Technology roadmap]] ==References== * Klopfenstein, Bruce K.
