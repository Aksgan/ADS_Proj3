generally recognized that there is no absolute truth but nevertheless that there are objectively valid laws and principles". : In that respect, "a scientifically or rationally valid statement means that the power of reason is applied to all the available data of observation without any of them being suppressed or falsified for the sake of a desired result". The history of science is "a history of inadequate and incomplete statements, and every new insight makes possible the recognition of the inadequacies of previous propositions and offers a springboard for creating a more adequate formulation." : As a result "the history of thought is the history of an ever-increasing approximation to the truth. Scientific knowledge is not absolute but optimal; it contains the optimum of truth attainable in a given historical period." Fromm furthermore notes that "different cultures have emphasized various aspects of the truth" and that increasing interaction between cultures allows for these aspects to reconcile and integrate, increasing further the approximation to the truth. ====Foucault==== Truth, for [[Michel Foucault]], is problematic when any attempt is made to see truth as an "objective" quality. He prefers not to use the term truth itself but "Regimes of Truth". In his historical investigations he found truth to be something that was itself a part of, or embedded within, a given power structure. Thus Foucault's view shares much in common with the concepts of [[Truth#Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]. Truth for Foucault is also something that shifts through various [[episteme]] throughout history.<ref>Foucault, M. "The Order of Things", London: Vintage Books, 1970 (1966)</ref> ====Baudrillard==== [[Jean Baudrillard]] considered truth to be largely simulated, that is pretending to have something, as opposed to dissimulation, pretending to not have something. He took his cue from [[iconoclasm|iconoclast]]s who he claims knew that images of God demonstrated the fact that God did not exist.<ref name = "Baudrillard">Jean Baudrillard. Simulacra and Simulation. Michigan: Michigan University Press, 1994.</ref> Baudrillard wrote in "Precession of the Simulacra": ::The [[simulacrum]] is never that which conceals the truth—it is the truth which conceals that there is none. The simulacrum is true. ::—Ecclesiastes<ref>Baudrillard, Jean. [http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Baudrillard/Baudrillard_Simulacra.html "Simulacra and Simulations", in ''Selected Writings''], ed.

"Baudrillard attributes this quote to Ecclesiastes. However, the quote is a fabrication (see Jean Baudrillard. Cool Memories III, 1991-95. London: Verso, 1997). Editor’s note: In Fragments: Conversations With François L’Yvonnet. New York: Routledge, 2004:11, Baudrillard acknowledges this 'Borges-like' fabrication."

One must remember that though such examples seem extreme, such extremity is an important part of Baudrillard's theory. For a less extreme example, consider how movies usually end with the bad being punished, humiliated, or otherwise failing, thus affirming for viewers the concept that the good end happily and the bad unhappily, a narrative which implies that the status quo and institutionalised power structures are largely legitimate.<ref name = "Baudrillard"/> ====Ratzinger==== Philosopher and theologian [[Joseph Ratzinger]], before his election as [[Benedict XVI]], commented upon the relationship of truth with [[tolerance]],<ref name=TT>Ratzinger, ''Truth and Tolerance: Christian Belief And World Religions'', Ignatius Press, 2004</ref> [[conscience]],<ref>Ratzinger, [http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/RATZCONS.HTM Truth and Conscience], 10th Workshop for Bishops, [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], 1991</ref> [[liberty|freedom]],<ref>Ratzinger, [http://www.ewtn.com/library/THEOLOGY/TRUEFREE.htm Truth and Freedom], [[Communio|Communio: International Catholic Review]], Spring 1996</ref> and [[religion]].<ref name=TT/> For him, "beyond all particular questions, the real problem lies in the question of truth."<ref name=TT/> Ratzinger refers to achievements of the [[natural science]]s as evidence that human reason has the power to know reality and arrive at truth. He also argues that "the modern self-limitation of reason" rooted in [[Immanuel Kant]]'s philosophy, which views itself incapable of knowing religion and the [[human science]]s such as [[ethics]], leads to dangerous pathologies of religion and pathologies of science.<ref name=TT/><ref name="Benedict">Benedict XVI, [http://www.zenit.org/article-16955?l=english Address at the University of Regensburg 2006]</ref> He thinks that this self-limitation, which "amputates" the mind's capacity to answer fundamental questions such as man's origin and purpose, dishonors reason and is contradictory to the modern acclamation of science, whose basis is the power of reason.<ref name=TT/><ref name="Benedict" /> In his book ''Truth and Tolerance'', Ratzinger argued that truth and [[love]] are identical.
