drives]], although they can also be used for front-end [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] ports, I/O bays, [[card reader]]s, [[Computer fan|fans]], tool storage, and other uses. Some computers have a small [[system monitor]] LCD display mounted in a drive bay. When installing a drive in a bay, it is usually secured with 4 screws that hold the drive in the bay, although toolless fasteners are becoming more common. Then, any necessary power, data transfer, and other cables are routed into and connected to the rear of the drive. The drive bay is usually just big enough for the drive to fit inside. 3.5" bays are most often used today for mounting hard drives, and 5.25" bays remain standard equipment for mounting [[CD]] and [[DVD]] drives. ==See also== *[[Device Bay]] ==References== {{reflist}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Drive Bay}} [[Category:Computer peripherals]] [[it:Drive bay]]</text> </page> <page> <id>11107</id> <title>DroidIn</title> <text>{{Notable|date=December 2010}} {{Infobox software | name = DroidIn | title = | logo = <!-- [[File: ]] --> | screenshot = <!-- [[File: ]] --> | caption = | collapsible = | author = | developer = Bostone Consulting | released = 8 May 2010 | discontinued = | latest release version = 2.1.5 | latest release date = 8 November 2010 | latest preview version = | latest preview date = <!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD|df=yes/no}} --> | frequently updated = <!-- DO NOT include this parameter unless you know what it does --> | programming language = [[Java (software platform)|Java]] | operating system = [[Google Android|Android]] | platform = Android Mobile Phones | size = | language = English | status = | genre = social network | license = [[adware]] or paid | website = [http://droidin.net DroidIn.net] }} '''DroidIn''' is an application running oon the [[Google Android|Android]] [[operating system]].
