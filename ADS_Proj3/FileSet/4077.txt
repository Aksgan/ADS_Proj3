SlimDX can be used from any [[Computer language|language]] under the .NET runtime (an advantage of the [[Common Language Runtime|CLR]]). SlimDX can be used to develop [[multimedia]] and interactive [[Application software|applications]] (e.g. [[Computer games|games]]). Enabling high performance graphical representation and enabling the programmer to make use of modern graphical hardware while working inside the .NET framework. SlimDX was first publicly revealed in [[Software release life cycle#Beta|beta]] form on June 30, 2007. Since then it has grown at a rapid pace and now covers most multimedia APIs provided by Microsoft. As of the June 2008 release, it is no longer in beta and is considered [[Software release life cycle#Stable or unstable|stable]].

The company is a subsidiary of [[Echostar Corporation|EchoStar Corporation]] (purchased in the fall of 2007 [http://www.slingmedia.com/get/pr-slingmodem-cable.html]) and is based in San Mateo, California. Their flagship product, the [[Slingbox]], debuted on the US market on July 1, 2005. ==History== Blake and Jason Krikorian, brothers from [[San Francisco]] and devoted [[San Francisco Giants]] fans, envisioned the concept of the Slingbox during the 2002 [[Major League Baseball]] season. Traveling far from home, they faced missing the best games of the season, and sought a solution. The Slingbox was born. On September 24, 2007, [[Echostar Corporation|EchoStar]] announced an agreement to acquire Sling Media for approximately $380 million USD<ref>[http://www.slingmedia.com/get/pr-echostar-slingmedia.html Announcement of acquisition by EchoStar on Sling Media website]</ref>. ===Growth=== Beginning with the colossal refrigerator-like prototype placeshifter for baseball games, the Slingbox soon evolved into the sleek form we see today, designed by [[Yves Behar]], capable of 'slinging' any video source. This design was later replaced by the second and third generation products designed by [[NewDealDesign]] in San Francisco. ===Criticism and controversy=== Early in its history, Slingbox caused widespread speculation of its possible legal implications. High on the list of issues cited by critics, is the ability to provide a loophole around proximity control, potentially allowing people outside the approved viewing area for events, especially sports, in which distribution traditionally has been restricted by time and region. These concerns have yet to impact Sling Media, however, as the Slingbox has evolved into a family of products designed for compatibility with specific video connections and consumer needs. ==Products== The original Slingbox, now referred to as the Slingbox Classic, connects to any standard audio and/or video signal, and streams the video and audio to a computer over a high-speed broadband internet connection. Then the flagship of the Sling Media line of products, it was released July 1, 2005, garnering significant media attention. The so-called "foil-wrapped chocolate bar" appearance made a statement, but many felt the design made the Slingbox stand out, and not in a good way. Improvement came with the introduction of the second-generation line of Sling Media products, the AV, Tuner, and Pro. While the Slingbox AV became a simplified unit with [[s-video]] and [[Composite video|composite]] inputs only, the Slingbox Tuner provided service for the other end of the spectrum, with only a single [[Coaxial cable|coaxial]] input for use by basic cable and antenna-only applications. The Slingbox Pro introduced a four input design, combining the capabilities of the AV and Tuner units while also allowing for the connection of high definition sources with the use of an accessory cable adding [[Component video#YPbPr analog component video|component]] and [[TOSLINK|digital audio]] inputs. Along with a line of accessories, including the SlingLink [[Power line communication#Home networking (broadband)|power line network]] interface and additional software for mobile devices, Sling Media's products became more diverse in order to appeal to consumers in the electronics market. ==Advertising== *Television Ads: "Sharkbait", "Gorman", "Kruk and Kuip"[San Francisco Giants Broadcasters] *Radio Ads: featured by Howard Stern, WEEI-AM 850 Boston, Jim Rome, Rod Brooks, and KKFN-AM 950 Denver. *Print Ads: "80 lb.
