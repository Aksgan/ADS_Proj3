He nevertheless clung to the importance of the idea of confession, something he engaged in several times throughout his life, where he confessed to friends and family that he had lied, or had said or done something that meant he had not been true to himself. He wrote in his diaries about having made a major confession to his oldest sister, Hermine, while he was at the ''Realschule''; Monk writes that it may have been about his loss of faith. He also discussed it with Gretl, his other sister, who directed him to [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]''. Schopenhauer's [[idealism]] is a version of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s: that the world of the senses is mere appearance, and the ethical will the only reality, a view that Wittgenstein adopted until he abandoned it when he began to study [[Gottlob Frege]] and logic, just before he went to Cambridge, though Monk writes he returned to it in the ''Tractatus'', where his views on idealism and [[Philosophical realism|realism]] collided.<ref>Monk, pp. 18–19.</ref> ===Influence of Otto Weininger=== [[File:OttoWeiningerspring1903.jpg|left|thumb|130px|[[Otto Weininger]] (1880&ndash;1903): Wittgenstein was greatly influenced by his suicide.]] During Wittgenstein's first term at the ''Realschule'', on 3 October 1903, the Viennese philosopher [[Otto Weininger]] rented the room in the house at Schwarzspanierstrasse 15, Vienna, that Beethoven had died in, and shot himself. His book ''Geschlecht und Charakter'' (Sex and Character) had been published to mostly terrible reviews a few months earlier, but it had received a great review from [[August Strindberg]]; that and his suicide turned Weininger into a cult figure, and someone Wittgenstein came to admire. Monk writes that Wittgenstein was ashamed that he had not also killed himself, seeing Weininger's suicide as an ethical deed in a rotten world&mdash;a world that Weininger saw composed of superficial anarchy and a materialist interpretation of history, where there are no great philosophers or artists, and where genius is a form of madness&mdash;and recommended to everyone that they read Weininger's book.<ref name=Monk19>Monk, pp. 19–26.</ref> Weininger&mdash;who like Wittgenstein was gay and had Jewish roots&mdash;argued that the concepts male and female exist only as [[Platonic realism|Platonic forms]], and that the essence of woman is sexual. Whereas men are basically rational, women operate only at the level of their emotions and sexual organs; Jews are similar, saturated with femininity, with no sense of right and wrong, and no soul. Wittgenstein saw in this argument the answers to issues he had been struggling with. Weininger argues that man must choose between his masculine and feminine sides, consciousness and unconsciousness, Platonic love and sexuality. Love and sexual desire stand in contradiction, and the love between a woman and a man is therefore doomed to misery or immorality. The only life worth living is the spiritual one&mdash;to live as a woman or a Jew means one has no right to live at all; the choice is genius or death. Monk
