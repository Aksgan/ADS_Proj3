to travel long distances, and so Postman claims "the local and the timeless ... lost their central position in newspapers, eclipsed by the dazzle of distance and speed ... Wars, crimes, crashes, fires, floods &mdash; much of it the social and political equivalent of Adelaide's whooping coughs &mdash; became the content of what people called 'the news of the day'" (pp. 66-67). A low '''information-action ratio''', therefore, refers to the helplessness people confront when faced with decontextualized information. Someone may know Adelaide has the whooping cough, but what could anyone do about it? Postman said that this kind of access to decontextualized information "made the relationship between information and action both abstract and remote." Information consumers were "faced with the problem of a diminished social and political potency." == References == *[http://www.frostbytes.com/~jimf/informing.html ''Informing Ourselves To Death''] *[http://www.neilpostman.org/ The Neil Postman Information Page] [[Category:Information theory]]</text> </page> <page> <id>18258</id> <title>Information Card Foundation</title> <text>In June 2008, industry leaders including [[Equifax]], [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], [[Novell]], [[Oracle Corporation]], [[PayPal]] and others created the '''Information Card Foundation''' in order to advance the use of the [[Information Card]] metaphor as a key component of an open, interoperable, royalty-free, user-centric identity layer spanning both the enterprise and the Internet. ==See also== * [[Information Card]] * [[I-Card]] == References == * [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/24/technology/24card.html?_r=2&ref=business&oref=slogin&oref=slogin Technology Leaders Favor Online ID Card Over Passwords] - New York Times article 24-Jun-08 announcing the Information Card Foundation * [http://informationcard.net/files/ICFPressRelease6-24-08.pdf Press Release] - Announcement of the Information Card Foundation * [http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9102578 Heavy Hitters Collaborate on Promoting Digital-ID Tech] - ComputerWorld Article covering ICF announcement. == External links == * [http://informationcard.net Information Card Foundation Website] [[Category:Identity management systems]] [[Category:Identity management]] {{compu-soft-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>18283</id> <title>Information Systems Audit and Control Association</title> <text>[[Image:Isaca-logo.png|Organization logo|right|thumb|200 px]] '''ISACA''' is an international professional association that deals with IT Governance.

In 1969, Stuart Tyrnauer, employed by the (then) Douglas Aircraft Company, incorporated the entity as the EDP Auditors Association, serving as its founding Chairman for the first three years. In 1976 the association formed an education foundation to undertake large-scale research efforts to expand the knowledge and value of the IT governance and control field. ==Current status== ISACA currently serves more than 86,000 constituents (members and professionals holding ISACA certifications) in more than 160 countries. The job titles of members are such as IS auditor, consultant, educator, IS security professional, regulator, [[chief information officer]] and [[internal audit]]or. They work in nearly all industry categories. There is a network of ISACA chapters with 170 chapters established in over 160 countries. Chapters provide education, resource sharing, advocacy, networking and other benefits. ==Major publications== * [[Technical standard|Standards]], Guidelines and Procedures for [[information system]] auditing<ref>Standards, Guidelines and Procedures for information system auditing: http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/Standards/Documents/ALL-IT-Standards-Guidelines-and-Tools.pdf</ref><ref>Some ISACA standards in different languages: http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/Standards/Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx</ref>(Guideline co-developed with the [[International Federation of Accountants]]) * [[COBIT]] * [[Val IT]] (Getting best value from IT investments) * [[Risk IT]] * Information System Control Journal ==Certification== * [[Certified Information Systems Auditor]] (CISA) * [[Certified Information Security Manager]] (CISM) * [[Certified in the Governance of Enterprise IT]] (CGEIT) * Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC) ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.isaca.org/ ISACA official webpage] {{DEFAULTSORT:Information Systems Audit And Control Association}} [[Category:Computer-related organizations]] [[Category:Computer security organizations]] [[Category:Auditing]] [[Category:Organizations established in 1967]] [[Category:Professional accountancy bodies]] [[de:Information Systems Audit and Control Association]] [[fr:Information Systems Audit and Control Association]] [[id:ISACA]] [[he:האיגוד הישראלי לביקורת ואבטחת מערכות מידע]] [[nl:Information Systems Audit and Control Association]] [[ja:ISACA]] [[pl:ISACA]] [[pt:Information Systems Audit and Control Association]] [[ru:ISACA]]</text> </page> <page> <id>18298</id> <title>Information and Computation</title> <text>{{Primary sources|date=January 2010}} {{italictitle}} {{Infobox journal | title = Information and Computation | cover = [[File:Journalcover_Ic.gif]] | editor = [[Albert R.
