====Specialist==== The "Specialist" was the first DIY computer which was published in a magazine other than ''Radio''<!-- <<This clause is awkward; it was both the first one published in that magazine and the first one published in any magazine other than Radio (according to the previous article) -->; it was published in ''Modelist-Konstructor'', a DIY magazine which was not exclusively focused on electronics. The computer was named the Specialist, and the magazine detailing its specifications was published in 1987, although it was developed by one hobbyist two years earlier. It was much more advanced than previous DIY computers, because it had a higher [[graphical resolution]] (384x256) and a "transparent" video system, which did not slow down the CPU when both the CPU and the video system tried to access the [[RAM]] simultaneously. It gained limited popularity with hobbyists, though some factories produced DIY kits (Lik for example). ====UT-88==== ''Yunij Technik'' (''Young Engineer'') magazine released details for one DIY home computer, the UT-88, which was published in 1988. It was a step back to the Micro-80 conception but was much simpler and used very widespread elements, which made it available for less skilled hobbyists. It was divided to few blocks, starting from single board microcomputer with LED display and HEX keyboard, and later adding more RAM, TV interface, and complete keyboard. ====Orion-128==== The Orion-128 was the last DIY computer published in ''Radio'' magazine and the last [[i8080]]-based DIY computer in Russia. It used the same concepts as the Specialist and had similar specifications, with both advances and flaws. It gained more popularity because it was supported by a more popular magazine, though it was never produced by factories in any form. Much of the software for the Orion-128 was ported by hobbyists from the Specialist and the [[ZX Spectrum]]. ====Vector-06C==== One of the last Soviet-designed, 8-bit home computers was the [[Vector-06C]] with an i8080 CPU clone @3 MHz, which is still used by some enthusiasts.{{Who|date=September 2010}} It had color graphics (16 colors) with programmable palette, few resolutions. Some games were ported from MSX and ZX Spectrum computers (converting original code from Z80 to 8080 and replacing graphics output code). ==East German computers== {| class="wikitable" |- | [[Image:Robotron A 5120.jpg|150px|thumb|none|Robotron [[A 5120]] office computer, ''1982'']] | [[Image:KC85-4.jpg|150px|thumb|none|[[KC 85|KC 85/4]] home computer, ''1987'']] | [[Image:Robotron-KC87-2.jpg|150px|thumb|none|[[Robotron KC 87]] home computer, ''1987'']] | [[Image:A7100EC1834.jpg|150px|thumb|none|Robotron [[A 7100]] and [[EC 1834]] (XT-compatible) personal computer, ''1986'']] | [[Image:Robotron K1840.jpg|150px|thumb|none|Robotron RVS [[K 1840]] (SM 1710), DEC [[VAX-11]]/780 Clone, ''1988'', recorded in the Technical Collections Dresden]] | [[Image:K1822 prototyp.jpg|150px|thumb|none|Prototype of Robotron RVS [[K 1820]] (SM 1720), DEC [[MicroVAX]] II Clone, ''1990'', recorded in the Technical Collections Dresden]] |} ===VEB Robotron and ESER=== In [[East Germany]] (''German Democratic Republic''), the main manufacturer of computer hardware was [[VEB Robotron]]. They were involved in the [[ESER]] (''ES EVM'') and SKR (''SM EVM'') development of a standard across [[Comecon]] countries. ===VEB Kombinat Mikroelektronik=== Another important [[Kombinat]] beneath Robotron was the [[Kombinat Mikroelektronik Erfurt]]. It manufactured [[integrated circuit]]s - e.g. [[microprocessors]] [[U880]] ([[Z80]]-clone), [[U80601]] ([[80286]]-clone) and [[U80701]] ([[MicroVAX 78032]]-clone) - and also some series of home computers (KC85/2-KC85/4). ==Polish computers== {| class="wikitable" |- | [[Image:XYZ.jpg|150px|thumb|none|[[XYZ]], ''1958'']] | [[Image:Odra 1305 jednostka centralna.jpg|150px|thumb|none|Odra No. 1305, ''1974'']] | [[Image:Automat obrachunkowy MERA 302.jpg|150px|thumb|none|[[MERA 302]], ''1974'']] |} ===Odra=== Some of the earliest computers created in Poland were the first [[Odra (computer)|Odra computers]]. They were manufactured in [[Wrocław]], (the brand name comes from the [[Odra River]] that flows through the city of Wrocław) and exported to other communist countries. The production started in 1959–1960; the computers were built at the Elwro manufacturing plant, which was bought by Siemens and immediately closed in 1989. The last series of Odra computers, the Odra 1300, consisted of three models: the Odra 1304, 1305, and the 1325. Although the hardware was developed by Polish teams, the software for the above machines was provided by the British company [[International Computers Limited|ICL]] (that is, the Odra was ICL 1900 compatible). ===K-202=== [[K-202]] was computer built by [[Jacek Karpiński]]. It was faster and cheaper than the most of the world's production at this time, but the production was shunned because of political reasons - it was not compatible with the [[ES EVM]] standard. ===Mazovia=== Mazovia was a Polish clone of [[IBM PC/XT]]. ==Bulgarian computers== In the 1980s [[Bulgaria]] manufactured computers according to an agreement within the [[COMECON]]: * Mainframes: IZOT series and [[ES EVM]] series (abbreviation from Edinnaya Sistema Elektronno Vichislitelnih Machin, or Unified Computer System — created in 1969 by USSR, Bulgaria, Hungary, GDR, Poland and Czechoslovakia). * Personal computers: IMKO, [[Pravetz series 8|Pravetz-82/8M/8A/8E/8C/8D]] — an 8-bit machine, based on Bulgarian-made [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] variants, IZOT 1030 — based on East German-made U880 (a Z80A clone), Pravetz-16/16A/16H/286 (16-bit) — based on Bulgarian clones of 8086/186/286. For example, the Pravetz-8M featured two processors (primary: Bulgarian-made clone of [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]], designated [[SM630]] at 1.018 MHz, secondary: Z80A at 4 MHz), 64KB DRAM and 16KB EPROM. The largest computer factory was some 60 km from [[Sofia]], in [[Pravetz]]. Another big facility was the plant "Electronika" in Sofia. Smaller plants throughout the country produced monitors and peripherals, notably DZU (Diskovi Zapametyavashti Ustroistva — Disk Memory Devices) — [[Stara Zagora]] made hard disks for mainframes and personal computers. At its peak, Bulgaria supplied 40 percent of the computers in [[COMECON]]. The electronics industry employed 300,000 workers, and it generated 8 billion rubles a year (US$13.3 billion). Since the democratic changes in 1989 and the subsequent chaotic political and economic conditions, the once blooming Bulgarian computer industry almost completely disintegrated. ==See also== * [[History of computer hardware in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] * [[History of computing hardware]] * [[List of Soviet computer systems]] * [[List of Soviet hardware engineers]] * [[BESM]] * [[HRS-100]] — a [[hybrid computer]] jointly designed by engineers from [[USSR]] and [[Mihajlo Pupin Institute]] and deployed in [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in 1971. ==References== {{Reflist|2}} ==External links== *[http://www.rk86.com/frolov/ Soviet calculators and computers collection by Sergei Frolov] *[http://www.sigcis.org/?q=node/85/ Pioneers of Soviet Computing] *[http://www.15kop.ru/en/ Museum of Soviet Arcade Machines]
