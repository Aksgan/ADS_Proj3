Instead of [[FPGA]]s ([[field-programmable gate array]]s) having single bit configurable logic blocks (CLBs), rDPAs have multiple bits wide (for instance, 32 bit path width) reconfigurable datapath units ([[rDPU]]s). A '''Reconfigurable datapath array''' or '''rDPA''' is a [[semiconductor]] device containing reconfigurable data path units ('''[[rDPU]]''') and programmable interconnects. Each rDPU can be configured to perform an individual function. These rDPUs and interconnects can be programmed after the manufacturing process by the customer/designer (hence the term "reconfigurable") so that the rDPA can perform whatever complex computation is needed. Because rDPUs are multiple bits wide (for instance, 32 bits), we talk about coarse-grained reconfigurability - in contrast to [[FPGA]]s with single-bit wide configurable logic blocks, called fine-gained reconfigurable. rDPAs are structurally programmed from [[configware]] sources, compiled into pipe networks to be mapped onto the rDPA. rDPAs are not instruction-stream-driven and have no instruction fetch at run time. rDPUs do not have a program counter. The term '''reconfigurable datapath array''' or '''rDPA''' has been coined by Rainer Kress in 1993 when having been at [[University of Kaiserslautern|TU Kaiserslautern]]. ==See also== * [[Configware]] * [[Morphware]] * [[IPFlex]] * [[Field-programmable gate array]] ==External links== * [http://morphware.net/ The Morphware Page] * [http://configware.org/ The Configware Page] * [http://kressarray.de/ KressArray homepage] [[Category:Digital circuits]] [[Category:Reconfigurable computing]]</text> </page> <page> <id>31507</id> <title>Record linkage</title> <text>'''Record linkage''' (RL)<!-- <s>also known as '''deduplication'''</s>,--> refers to the task of finding entries that refer to the same [[entity]] in two or more files. Record linkage is an appropriate technique when you have to join data sets that do not have a unique [[Relational model|database key]] in common. A data set that has undergone record linkage is said to be linked. Record linkage is a useful tool when performing [[data mining]] tasks, where the data originated from different sources or different organizations. Most commonly, performing RL on datasets involves joining records of persons based on name, since no [[National identification number]] or similar is recorded in the data. In mathematical [[graph theory]], record linkage can be seen as a technique of resolving [[bipartite graph]]s. ==Naming conventions== Record linkage is the term used by statisticians, epidemiologists and historians among others. Commercial mail and database applications refer to it as "merge/purge processing" or "list washing". [[computer science|Computer scientists]] often refer to it as "data matching" or as the "object identity problem". Other names used to describe the same concept include "entity resolution", "entity disambiguation", "duplicate detection", "record matching", "instance identification", "deduplication", "coreference resolution", "reference reconciliation" and "database hardening". This confusion of terminology has led to few cross-references between these research communities.<ref>[http://datamining.anu.edu.au/linkage.html Cristen, P & T: Febrl - Freely extensible biomedical record linkage (Manual, release 0.3) p.9]</ref><ref> {{cite journal | first = Ahmed | last = Elmagarmid | coauthors = Panagiotis G.

The most straightforward is a ''rules-based'' approach, in which reasonable rules are developed and then refined as common exceptions are found. The advantage to this approach is that it is possible to get a good deal of accuracy without needing a lot of labeled data to train or test the rules on. The disadvantage is that to obtain very high accuracy, more and more exceptions and special cases would need to be handled, and eventually the list of rules gets too complex to
