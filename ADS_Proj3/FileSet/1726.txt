and scientific users of the Standard Positioning Service. In general, GPS receivers are composed of an antenna, tuned to the frequencies transmitted by the satellites, receiver-processors, and a highly stable clock (often a [[crystal oscillator]]). They may also include a display for providing location and speed information to the user. A receiver is often described by its number of channels: this signifies how many satellites it can monitor simultaneously. Originally limited to four or five, this has progressively increased over the years so that, {{As of|2007|lc=on}}, receivers typically have between 12 and 20 channels.<ref>Though there are many receiver manufacturers, they almost all use one of the chipsets produced for this purpose. An example: {{cite web |url=http://gpstekreviews.com/2007/04/14/gps-receiver-chip-performance-survey/ |title=GPS Receiver Chip Performance Survey |publisher=GPS Technology Reviews}}</ref> [[Image:j32 1 small.jpg|thumb|left|A typical [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] GPS receiver module measuring 15Ã—17 mm.]] GPS receivers may include an input for differential corrections, using the [[RTCM]] SC-104 format. This is typically in the form of an [[RS-232]] port at 4,800 bit/s speed. Data is actually sent at a much lower rate, which limits the accuracy of the signal sent using RTCM. Receivers with internal DGPS receivers can outperform those using external RTCM data. {{As of |2006}}, even low-cost units commonly include [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS) receivers. [[Image:M10214 20071003 3764.jpg|thumb|right|A typical GPS receiver with integrated antenna.]] Many GPS receivers can relay position data to a PC or other device using the [[NMEA 0183]] protocol. Although this protocol is officially defined by the National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nmea.org/pub/index.html |title=Publications and Standards from the National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) |publisher=National Marine Electronics Association |accessdate=2008-06-27}}</ref> references to this protocol have been compiled from public records, allowing open source tools like [[gpsd]] to read the protocol without violating [[intellectual property]] laws. Other proprietary protocols exist as well, such as the [[SiRF]] and [[MediaTek|MTK]] protocols. Receivers can interface with other devices using methods including a serial connection, [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]], or [[Bluetooth]]. {{Further|[[GPS navigation device]]}} == Applications == While originally a military project, GPS is considered a ''dual-use'' technology, meaning it has significant military and civilian applications. GPS has become a widely deployed and useful tool for commerce, scientific uses, tracking, and surveillance. GPS's accurate time facilitates everyday activities such as banking, mobile phone operations, and even the control of power grids by allowing well synchronized hand-off switching. Farmers, surveyors, geologists, and countless others perform their work more efficiently, safely, economically, and accurately.<ref name=gps.gov/> === Civilian === {{See also|GNSS applications|GPS navigation device}} [[File:GPS roof antenna dsc06160.jpg|thumb|right|This [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] is mounted on the roof of a hut containing a scientific experiment needing precise timing.]] Many civilian applications use one or more of GPS's three basic components: absolute location, relative movement, and time transfer. * [[Cellular telephony]]: Clock synchronization enables time transfer, which is critical for synchronizing its spreading codes with other base stations to facilitate inter-cell handoff and support hybrid GPS/cellular position detection for [[E911#Wireless enhanced 911|mobile emergency calls]] and other applications. The first [[Mobile GPS navigation|handsets with integrated GPS]] launched in the late 1990s. The U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) mandated the feature in either the handset or in the towers (for use in triangulation) in 2002 so emergency services could locate 911 callers. Third-party software developers later gained access to GPS APIs from [[Nextel]] upon launch, followed by [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]] in 2006, and [[Verizon]] soon thereafter. * [[Disaster relief]]/[[emergency service]]s: Depend upon GPS for location and timing capabilities. * [[Geofence|Geofencing]]: [[Vehicle tracking system]]s, [[Handheld tracker|person tracking systems]], and [[Positioning Animals Worldwide|pet tracking]] systems use GPS to locate a vehicle, person, or pet. These devices attach to the vehicle, person, or the pet collar. The application provides 24/7 tracking and mobile or Internet updates should the trackee leave a designated area.<ref name="Spotlight">{{cite web|url=http://www.spotlightgps.com/ |title=Spotlight GPS pet locator |publisher=Spotlightgps.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-15}}</ref> * [[Geotagging]]: Applying location coordinates to digital objects such as photographs and other documents for purposes such as creating map overlays. * [[GPS Aircraft Tracking]] * [[GPS tour]]s: Location determines what content to display; for instance, information about an approaching point of interest. * [[Cartography|Map-making]]: Both civilian and military cartographers use GPS extensively. * [[Navigation]]: Navigators value digitally precise velocity and orientation measurements. * [[Phasor measurement unit| Phasor measurement units]]: GPS enables highly accurate timestamping of power system measurements, making it possible to compute [[phasor (sine waves)|phasors]]. * [[Recreation]]: For example, [[geocaching]], [[geodashing]], [[GPS drawing]] and [[waymarking]]. * [[Surveying]]: Surveyors use absolute locations to make maps and determine property boundaries. * [[Tectonics]]: GPS enables direct fault motion measurement in [[earthquakes]]. <!--*GPS enables researchers to explore Earth's [[environment]] including the atmosphere, ionosphere and gravity field. how???--> <!-- Compared to a few years ago, GPS technology for handsets has matured considerably, offering much better performance in terms of sensitivity, power consumption, size and price. What is more, the OMA SUPL A-GPS standard has enabled lower cost deployment of A-GPS services that ensure a better and more consistent user experience necessary for the mass consumer market. The SUPL A-GPS standard allows network operators or handset manufacturers to deploy assistance services that reduce the time to first fix, lowers the power consumption, and enhances the sensitivity of the GPS receiver. The SUPL standard uses User Plane communication channels such as SMS and GPRS to transport the aiding data, as opposed to the control plane channels in networks, thereby reducing the load on the networks, as well as complexity and cost of service deployment. New business models have also become possible, ranging from hosted services for operators that want to minimize capital investments, to services deployed by handset vendors for end-users that cannot get similar services from their network operator yet. The major handset software platforms and operating systems are evolving, ensuring easier integration of GPS functionality for handset manufacturers and more powerful features for application developers. Along with the improving performance of handsets, in terms of screen size, processing power and memory size, current handsets thus provide much better platforms for location-enabled applications and services than before. The GPS value-chain was reshaped considerably in
