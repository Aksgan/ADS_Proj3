manufactured by [[Genesi]]. ==EFIKA 5200B== It is based on a 400 MHz [[Freescale]] [[PowerPC 5000#MPC52xx|MPC5200B]] [[System-on-a-Chip|SoC-processor]] and includes 44-pin 2.5" [[AT Attachment|IDE]], [[USB]], [[RS-232|serial port]], stereo audio in/out, 100 Mbit/s [[Ethernet]], 33/66 MHz [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] port and 128 MB [[Double data rate|DDR]] [[RAM]]. EFIKA uses an [[Open Firmware]] based [[Common Hardware Reference Platform|CHRP]] compliant [[firmware]] with a special [[x86 architecture|x86]]/[[BIOS]] [[emulator]] providing support for standard [[Video card|graphics cards]] on an [[Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP]] riser slot. The [[motherboard]] has a non-standard [[PC motherboard|form factor]], 118 mm x 153 mm x 38 mm small. Due to its small size, [[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive|RoHS compliance]] and energy efficient nature (drawing less than 20 W with a harddrive and a graphics card, typically less than 10 W during most usage scenarios), the EFIKA is considered very environmentally friendly. An EFIKA computer can run a variety of [[operating system]]s among [[Linux]] ([[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]], [[openSUSE]], [[Debian]] and [[CRUX|CRUX PPC]]), [[MorphOS]], [[OpenSolaris]] and [[QNX]]. It is sometimes called "EFIKA 5K2", since it uses the [[PowerPC e300|PowerPC e300 core]] based [[PowerPC 5000#MPC52xx|MPC5200B]] processor. On 10 September 2007, Genesi announced that they are developing a new version of the EFIKA based on the [[PowerPC 5000#MPC51xx|Freescale MPC5121e]],<ref>"[http://www.genesi-usa.com/press.php?date=20070910 Le Roi est Mort. Vive le Roi!]" September 10, 2007. Retrieved on February 2, 2008.</ref> which will feature on-board [[PowerVR]] MBX video and an additional 200 MHz fully-programmable RISC core, although it still has the same e300 core running at 400 MHz. ==EFIKA MX== In August 2009 [http://www.genesi-usa.com/products/efika/] a new EFIKA board was launched, EFIKA MX, with [[ARM architecture|ARM]] based CPU: * Freescale i.MX515 (ARM), 800 MHz * [[GPU]] 2D and 3D, [[OpenGL ES]] 2.0 & [[OpenVG]] 1.1 support * DDR2 512 MB RAM, up to 200MHz * [[WiFi]] (802.11 b/g/n) * Max power consumption: 15 watt The Efika MX comes in two models; the Open Client (desktop) and the Smartbook (laptop).

The main differences are: * [[Real time operating system|Real-time]] guarantees (each API call is quick, but more importantly, time-bound) * Multiple threads inside the kernel as well as outside * Pluggable [[Memory model (computing)|memory models]], allowing better support for later generations of [[ARM architecture|ARM]] [[instruction set]]. * A "nanokernel" which provides the most basic OS facilities upon which other "personality layers" can be built The user-side interface of EKA2 is almost completely compatible with [[EKA1]] - though EKA1 has not been used since [[Symbian OS]] v8.1 (which was superseded in 2005) The main advantage of EKA2 was its ability to run full telephone [[protocol stack|signalling stacks]]. Previously, on Symbian phones, these had to run on a separate CPU. Such signalling stacks are extremely complex and rewriting them to work natively on Symbian OS is typically not an option. EKA2 therefore allows "personality layers" to emulate the basic primitives of other operating systems, thus allowing existing signalling stacks to run largely unchanged. Real-time guarantees are a pre-requisite of signalling stacks, and also help with multimedia tasks. However, as with any real-time operating system, a full analysis of all threads is required before any real-time guarantees can be offered to anything except the highest-priority thread. (Higher priority threads may prevent lower-priority threads from running). Any multimedia task is likely to involve graphics, storage and/or networking activity, all of which are more likely to disrupt the stream than the kernel is. Inside the kernel, EKA1 only allowed a single thread (plus a 'null' [[idle thread]]). EKA2 allows many threads. This makes it much easier to write device drivers that involve complex state machines, such as those for [[memory stick]]s or [[USB]]. Interrupts are handled with an [[Interrupt Service Routine]], which may request an Immediate Deferred Function Call (called as soon as the interrupts are processed), or a Deferred Function Call, which is queued to run on a kernel thread. Either may in turn communicate with user-side threads. Power management in EKA2 was largely unchanged from EKA1. The exact scheme varies between phones, but generally the null thread puts the CPU and peripherals to sleep, after having requested a wake-up whenever the next timer is due to expire. EKA2 runs on [[ARM architecture|ARM]] CPUs and the "WINS" emulator. (Unofficial ports exist for other CPUs). On the emulator, EKA2 provides somewhat better emulation than EKA1, in particular for the <tt>RProcess</tt> APIs which Symbian OS uses to represent [[Process (computing)|processes]]. In EKA1 they didn't work at all on the emulator, which runs as a single Windows process. Much of the credit for EKA2 goes to
