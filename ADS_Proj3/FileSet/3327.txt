2009}} Note that interlibrary loan may take a day or weeks depending on the loaning library and whether they will scan and email, or mail the article. Open Access online, by contrast is faster, often immediate, making it more suitable than interlibrary loan for high paced research. Due to the benefits of open access, many governments are considering whether or not to mandate open access to publicly funded research. However, some organizations representing publishers, such as the DC Principles group in the United States, feel that such mandates are an unwarranted governmental intrusion in the publishing marketplace. Lobbying on both sides is fierce, both for pro-OA and contra-OA. In developing nations, open access archiving and publishing acquires a unique importance. Scientists, health care professionals, and institutions in developing nations often do not have the capital necessary to access scholarly literature, although schemes exist to give them access for little or no cost. Among the most important is [[HINARI]],<ref>[http://www.who.int/hinari/en/ World Health Organization] Health InterNetwork Access to Research Initiative</ref> the Health InterNetwork Access to Research Initiative, sponsored by the [[World Health Organization]]. HINARI, however, also has restrictions. For example, individual researchers may not register as users unless their institution has access,<ref name=WHOeligibility>[http://www.who.int/hinari/eligibility/en/ World Health Organization]: Eligibility</ref> and several countries that one might expect to have access do not have access at all (not even "low-cost" access) (e.g. South Africa).<ref name=WHOeligibility/> Many open access projects involve international collaboration. For example the [[SciELO]] (Scientific Electronic Library Online),<ref>[http://www.scielo.org/index.php?lang=en SciELO - Scientific Electronic Library Online]</ref> is a comprehensive approach to full open access journal publishing, involving a number of [[Latin America]]n countries. Bioline International, a [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to helping publishers in developing countries is a collaboration of people in the UK, Canada, and Brazil; the Bioline International Software is used around the world. [[Research Papers in Economics]] (RePEc), is a collaborative effort of over 100 volunteers in 45 countries. The [[Public Knowledge Project]] in [[Canada]] developed the [[open source]] publishing software [[Open Journal Systems]] (OJS), which is now in use around the world, for example by the [[African Journals Online]]<ref>[http://www.ajol.info/ AJOL - African Journals Online :: African Research, Journals, Medical Research]</ref> group, and one of the most active development groups is Portuguese. A 2004 study of open access publishing by Kristin Antelman found that in philosophy, political science, electrical and electronic engineering and mathematics, open access papers had a greater research impact.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/acrl/publications/crljournal/2004/sep/antelman.pdf| title = Do Open-Access Articles Have a Greater Research Impact? | publisher = College & Research Libraries 65(5) | date = September 2004 | pages =372â€“382| author = Kristin Antelman}} and summarized by [http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/acrl/publications/crlnews/2006/dec/scholarlycom.cfm C&RL News]</ref> ==Libraries and librarians== Many [[librarian]]s have been vocal and active advocates of open access. These librarians believe that open access promises to remove both the ''price barriers'' and the ''permission barriers'' that undermine library efforts to provide access to the journal literature<ref>[http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/acrl.htm Peter Suber, "Introduction to Open Access for Librarians"]</ref>, see also the [[Serials crisis]]. Many library associations have either signed major open access declarations, or created their own. For example, the [[Canadian Library Association]] endorsed a Resolution on Open Access in June 2005.<ref>[https://mx2.arl.org/Lists/SPARC-OAForum/Message/2017.html SPARC-OAForum@arl.org]</ref> Librarians also educate faculty, administrators, and others about the benefits of open access. For example, the [[Association of College and Research Libraries]] of the [[American Library Association]] has developed a Scholarly Communications Toolkit.<ref>[http://www.ala.org/ala/acrl/acrlissues/scholarlycomm/scholarlycommunicationtoolkit/toolkit.htm ALA] Scholarly Communication Toolkit</ref> The [[Association of Research Libraries]] has documented the need for increased access to scholarly information, and was a leading founder of the [[Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition]] (SPARC).<ref>[http://www.arl.org/sparc/index.html Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition]</ref> There is question, however, as to the extent to which Open Access will solve the serials crisis. In a [[Nature]] Web Focus forum, [http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/accessdebate/34.html The Pros and Cons of Open Access], Kate Worlock discusses whether Open Access is truly the answer to the crisis, or if it is simply an ends to a means in a world with shrinking library budgets. The argument from the publisher is that while the cost of publications have "undisputedly [sic] risen more sharply than the library budgets," the library budget is too small of a portion of the university's (in this example)overall budget at roughly 2% <ref>Worlock, K. (2004). The pros and cons of Open Access. http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/accessdebate/34.html, Nature</ref>. At most universities, the library houses the institutional repository, which provides free access to scholarly work of the university's faculty. Some open access advocates believe that institutional repositories will play a very important role in responding to open access mandates from funders<ref>[http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/369-guid.html How To Integrate University and Funder Open Access Mandates]</ref>. The Canadian Association of Research Libraries has a program<ref>[http://www.carl-abrc.ca/projects/institutional_repositories/institutional_repositories-e.html CARL - Online Resource Portal]</ref> to develop institutional repositories at all Canadian university libraries. An increasing number of libraries provide hosting services for open access journals. A recent survey by the Association of Research Libraries <ref>[http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2008/04/more-on-libraries-as-oa-publishers.html Peter Suber, Open Access News]</ref> found that 65% of surveyed libraries either are involved in journal publishing, or are planning to become involved in the very near future. ==History== The roots of the concept of open access can be found in the distant past, from the very beginnings of publishing, re-emerging with every [[innovation]] in publishing technology. The [[printing press]] allowed the written word to be printed and distributed, thereby extending [[literacy]] to the population at large. Moving from [[vellum]] to paper made it possible to [[Printing|print]] more cheaply. The [[invention]] of the [[Mail|postal]] system provided a means of widespread [[distribution (business)|distribution]]. The beginnings of the scholarly journal were a way of expanding low-cost access to scholarly findings. Many individuals anticipated the open access concept long before modern low-cost distribution methods. One early proponent was the physicist [[Leo Szilard]]. To help stem the flood of low-quality publications, he jokingly suggested in the [[1940]]s that at the beginning of his career each [[scientist]] should be issued with 100 vouchers to pay for his papers. The [[Common Knowledge]] project was an attempt to share information for the good of all, the brainchild of [[Brower Murphy]], formerly of The
