Bennett (computer scientist)</title> <text>'''Charles H. Bennett''' is an [[IBM Fellow]] at [[IBM Research]]. Bennett's recent work at IBM has concentrated on a re-examination of the physical basis of information, applying [[quantum physics]] to the problems surrounding information exchange. He has played a major role in elucidating the interconnections between physics and information, particularly in the realm of [[quantum computation]], but also in [[cellular automata]] and [[reversible computing]]. He discovered, with [[Gilles Brassard]], the concept of [[quantum cryptography]] and is one of the founding fathers of modern [[quantum information theory]]. Born in 1943 in New York City, he earned a B.S. in Chemistry from [[Brandeis University]] in 1964, and received his PhD from [[Harvard]] in 1970 for molecular dynamics studies (computer simulation of molecular motion) under [[David Turnbull]] and [[Berni Alder]]. For the next two years he continued this research under the late [[Aneesur Rahman]] at [[Argonne Laboratory]]. After joining IBM Research in 1972, he built on the work of IBM's [[Rolf Landauer]] to show that general-purpose computation can be performed by a logically and thermodynamically reversible apparatus; and in 1982 he proposed a re-interpretation of [[Maxwell's demon]], attributing its inability to break the second law to the [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] cost of destroying, rather than acquiring, information. He also published an important paper on the estimation of free energy differences between two systems, the [[Bennett acceptance ratio]] method. In collaboration with [[Gilles Brassard]] of the [[Université de Montréal]] he developed a practical system of [[quantum cryptography]], known as [[BB84]], which allows secure communication between parties who share no secret information initially, based on the uncertainty principle. With the help of [[John A. Smolin|John Smolin]], he built the world's first working demonstration of quantum cryptography in 1989. His other research interests include [[algorithmic information theory]], in which the concepts of information and randomness are developed in terms of the input/output relation of universal computers, and the analogous use of universal computers to define the intrinsic complexity or "logical depth" of a physical state as the time required by a universal computer to simulate the evolution of the state from a random initial state. In 1993 Bennett and Brassard, in collaboration with others, discovered "[[quantum teleportation]]", an effect in which the complete information in an unknown quantum state is decomposed into purely classical information and purely non-classical Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen ([[EPR paradox]]) correlations, sent through two separate channels, and later reassembled in a new location to produce an exact replica of the original [[quantum state]] that was destroyed in the sending process. In 1995-7, working with [[John A. Smolin|Smolin]], [[William Wootters|Wootters]], IBM's [[David P. DiVincenzo|DiVincenzo]], and other collaborators, he introduced several techniques for faithful transmission of classical and quantum information through noisy channels, part of the larger and recently very active field of quantum information and computation theory. Bennett is a Fellow of the American Physical Society and a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He was awarded the 2008 [[Harvey Prize]] by the [[Technion]]<ref>[http://www.admin.technion.ac.il/harvey/winners.html LIST OF HARVEY PRIZE WINNERS]</ref> and the 2006 Rank Prize in opto-electronics. == References == {{reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.research.ibm.com/people/b/bennetc/ Charles Bennett's page at IBM site] * [http://www.research.ibm.com/people/b/bennetc/chbbib.htm List of publications] {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME = Bennett, Charles H. | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH = | PLACE OF BIRTH = | DATE OF DEATH = | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Bennett, Charles H.}} [[Category:1943 births]] [[Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:Brandeis University alumni]] [[Category:Harvard University alumni]] [[Category:IBM Fellows]] [[Category:Cellular automatists]] [[Category:People from New York City]] [[Category:Fellows of the American Physical Society]] [[Category:American computer scientists]] [[de:Charles H.
