By the end of the summer in 1995, Smarthome.com had a full-functioning e-basket and [[search engine]], which it continues to build upon today. The company currently has about 100 employees and offers more than 5,000 items for the customized [[automation]] of the home via their website, catalog and retail store in Irvine, CA. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smarthome.com/corporatefactsheet.html |title=Corporate Fact Sheet |publisher=Smarthome.com |accessdate=2008-10-07 }}</ref>.
