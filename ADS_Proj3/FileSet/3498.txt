a [[slang]] term coined to describe the activity of a [[subculture]] of people who study, experiment with, or explore telecommunication systems, such as equipment and systems connected to public telephone networks. As telephone networks have become computerized, phreaking has become closely linked with [[hacker (computer security)|computer hacking]].<ref>Sterling 2002: 39</ref> This is sometimes called the H/P culture (with ''H'' standing for ''hacking'' and ''P'' standing for ''phreaking''). The term ''phreak'' is a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''[[telephone|phone]]'' and ''[[freak]]'', and may also refer to the use of various audio [[frequencies]] to manipulate a phone system. ''Phreak'', ''phreaker'', or ''phone phreak'' are names used for and by individuals who participate in phreaking. A large percentage of the phone Phreaks were blind.<ref>http://home.c2i.net/nirgendwo/cdne/ch4web.htm Underground Hackers Chapter 4</ref><ref>http://www.webcrunchers.com/crunch/stories/first_visit.html Webcrunchers</ref> Because identities were usually masked, an exact percentage cannot be calculated. ==History== ===Switch hook and tone dialer=== Possibly one of the first phreaking methods was switch-hooking. It is considered softcore{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} because it has almost negligible toll fraud potential. Nevertheless it allows placing calls from a phone where the rotary dial or keypad has been disabled by a key lock or other means to prevent unuthorized calls from that phone. It is done by rapidly pressing and releasing the switch hook to open and close the subscriber circuit, simulating the pulses generated by the rotary dial. Even most current telephone exchanges support this method{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}, as they need to be backward compatible with old subscriber hardware. By rapidly clicking the hook for a variable number of times at roughly 5 to 10 clicks per second, and then keeping intervals of roughly one second, the caller can dial numbers as if they were using the rotary dial. The pulse counter in the exchange counts the pulses or clicks and interprets them in two possible ways. Depending on continent and country, one click with a following interval can be either "one" or "zero" and subsequent clicks before the interval are additively counted. This renders ten consecutive clicks being either "zero" or "nine", respectively. Some exchanges allow using additional clicks for special controls, but numbers 0-9 now fall in one of these two standards. One special code, "flash", is a very short single click, possible but hard to simulate. Back in the day of rotary dial, very often technically identical phone sets were marketed in multiple areas of the world, only with plugs matched by country and the dials being bezeled with the local standard numbers. Such key-locked telephones, if wired to a modern DTMF capable exchange, can also be exploited by a tone dialer that generates the DTMF tones used by modern keypad units. These signals are now very uniformly standardized worldwide, and along with rotary dialing, they are almost all that is left of in-band signaling. It is notable that the two methods can be combined: Even if the exchange does not support DTMF, the key lock can be circumvented by switch-hooking, and the tone dialer can be then used to operate automated DTMF controlled services that can't be used with rotary dial. ===2600 hertz=== {{Main|2600 hertz}} The precise origins of phone phreaking are unknown, although it is believed{{Who|date=November 2008}} that phreak-like experimentation began with widespread deployment of automatic [[telephone switch|switches]] on the telephone networks. In the United States, [[AT&T]] began introducing automatic switches for long distance and certain forms of [[trunking]] carriers in the mid-to-late 1950s. With the introduction of these switches, the general population began, for the first time, to interact with computing power on a large scale. Phreaking can be viewed as an extension of this, where individuals interested in computers and technology, yet unable to further that interest for a variety of reasons, turned to the only available option: the computer controlled telephone network.{{Or|date=March 2010}} AT&T's fully automatic switches use [[tone dialing]], a form of [[in-band signaling]], and include some tones which are for internal telephone company use. One internal use tone is a tone of [[2600 Hz]] which causes a telephone switch to think the call was over, and could be exploited to provide free long-distance and international calls.<ref name="robson"/><!-- Sterling also has a description of this somewhere --> The tone was discovered in approximately 1957,<ref name="robson"/> by [[Joybubbles|Joe Engressia]], a blind seven-year old boy. Engressia was skilled with [[absolute pitch|perfect pitch]], and discovered that whistling the [[piano key frequencies|fourth E above middle C]] (a frequency of 2600 Hz) would stop a dialed phone recording. Unaware of what he had done, Engressia called the phone company and asked why the recordings had stopped. This was the beginning of his love of exploring the telephone system.<ref name="robson">{{cite web|url=http://www.robson.org/gary/writing/phreaking.html |first=Gary D. |last=Robson |publisher=[[Blacklisted! 411]] |date=April 2004 |title=The Origins of Phreaking |accessdate=2008-06-21 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080822231359/http://www.robson.org/gary/writing/phreaking.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-08-22}}</ref> Other early phreaks, such as "Bill from New York", began to develop a rudimentary understanding of how phone networks worked. Bill discovered that a [[recorder]] he owned could also play the tone at 2600 Hz with the same effect. [[John Draper]] discovered through his friendship with Engressia that the free whistles given out in [[Cap'n Crunch]] cereal boxes also produced a 2600 Hz tone when blown (providing his nickname, "Captain Crunch"). This allowed control of phone systems that worked on [[single frequency]] (SF) controls. One could sound a long whistle to reset the line, followed by groups of whistles (a short tone for a "1", two for a "2", etc.) to dial numbers. ===Multi frequency=== {{Main|Multi-frequency}} While Single Frequency worked on certain phone routes, the most common signaling on the then long distance network was [[Multi-frequency|Multi-Frequency]] Controls. The slang term for these tones and their use was "Marty Freeman." The specific frequencies required were unknown until 1964, when [[Bell System]]s published the information in the [[Bell System Technical Journal]] in an article describing the methods and frequencies used for inter-office signalling. The journal was intended for the company's engineers; however, it found its way to various college campuses across the United States. With this one article, the Bell System accidentally
