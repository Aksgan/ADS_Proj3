The book, published in 1929, is a revision of the [[Gifford Lectures]] he gave in 1927-28. Process philosophy lays the groundwork for a [[paradigm]] of [[subjectivity]], which Whitehead calls a "completed metaphysical language." (p. 18){{quotation|We diverge from [[Descartes]] by holding that what he has described as primary ''attributes'' of physical bodies, are really the forms of internal relationships ''between'' actual occasions.

Process capability indices measure how much [[Common-cause and special-cause|"natural variation"]] a process experiences relative to its specification limits and allows different processes to be compared with respect to how well an organization controls them. If the upper and lower [[Specification (technical standard)|specification]] limits of the process are USL and LSL, the target process mean is T, the estimated mean of the process is <MATH>\hat{\mu}</MATH> and the estimated variability of the process (expressed as a [[standard deviation]]) is <MATH>\hat{\sigma}</MATH>, then commonly-accepted process capability indices include: {| class="wikitable" !
