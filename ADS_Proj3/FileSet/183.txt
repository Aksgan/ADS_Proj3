which had announced grand plans for it. However, in 2000, Gateway sold the Amiga brand without having released any products. The current owner of the trademark, [[Amiga, Inc.]], licensed the rights to make hardware using the Amiga brand to a UK computer vendor Eyetech Group, Ltd. selling the [[AmigaOne]] via an international dealer network. The AmigaOne is a [[PowerPC]] computer to run [[AmigaOS 4]]. In October 2009, Hyperion was granted an exclusive, perpetual, worldwide right to AmigaOS 3.1 in order to use, develop, modify, commercialize, distribute and market [[AmigaOS 4|AmigaOS 4.x]] in any form, on any medium and for any current or future hardware platform under the exclusive trademark “AmigaOS”. == Hardware == At its core, the Amiga has a custom chipset consisting of several [[coprocessor]]s, which handle audio, video and [[direct memory access]] independently of the [[Central Processing Unit]] (CPU). This architecture freed up the Amiga's processor for other tasks and gave the Amiga a performance edge over its competitors, particularly in terms of video-intensive applications and games. === Central processing unit === <!-- Removed image: [[Image:Motorola PowerPC 604e 233MHz.jpg|75px|thumb|right|<small>[[PowerPC]] processor.</small>]] --> The [[Motorola]] [[Motorola 68000 family|68000]] series of microprocessors was used in all Amiga models from Commodore. While the 68000 family has a [[32-bit]] design, the 68000 used in several early models is generally referred to as 16-bit.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/oneamiga1.html | title = The One for 16-bit Games | accessdate = 2007-07-17 | first = Gareth | last = Knight | work = Amiga History Guide }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://amigareviews.classicgaming.gamespy.com/s_snippe.htm | title = Amiga Reviews: Zzap 16-Bit Gaming|accessdate =2008-05-23}}</ref> The 68000 has a [[16-bit]] external [[data bus]] so must transfer 32 bits of data in two consecutive steps, a technique called [[multiplexing]] — all this is transparent to the software, which was 32-bit from the beginning. The 68000 could address 16 MB of physical memory. Later Amiga models featured full 32-bit CPUs with a larger address space and [[instruction pipeline]] facilities. Commodore's design choice to remain with the 68000 architecture ensured that code was backward-compatible across the Amiga line. CPU upgrades were offered by both Commodore and third-party manufacturers. Most Amiga models can be upgraded either by direct CPU replacement or through expansion boards. Such boards often featured faster and higher capacity memory interfaces and [[hard disk drive|hard disk]] controllers. Towards the end of Commodore's time in charge of Amiga development there were suggestions that Commodore intended to move away from the 68000 series to higher performance [[Reduced instruction set computing|RISC]] processors, such as the [[PowerPC]].<ref name=Haynie >{{cite web |url=http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/haynie3drisc.html |title=CBM's Plans for the RISC-Chipset |author=Dave Haynie |date=1995.01.24 |quote=The initial schedule of 18 months was for the Hombre game machine hardware.

Despite this, third-party manufacturers designed upgrades featuring a combination of 68000 series and PowerPC processors along with a PowerPC native [[Kernel (computing)|micro-kernel]] and software.<ref>The Big Book of Amiga Hardware [http://amigahardware.mariomisic.de/cgi-bin/showhardware.cgi?HARDID=154 AmigaHardware.MarioMisic.de], [http://amigahardware.mariomisic.de/cgi-bin/showhardware.cgi?HARDID=225 AmigaHardware.MarioMisic.de]</ref> Later Amiga clones, such as the AmigaOne featured PowerPC processors only. === Custom chipset === The custom chipset at the core of the Amiga design appeared in three distinct generations, with a large degree of backward-compatibility. The [[Original Chip Set]] (OCS) appeared with the launch of the A1000. OCS was eventually followed by the modestly improved [[Enhanced Chip Set]] (ECS) in 1990 and finally by the 32-bit [[Advanced Graphics Architecture]] (AGA) in 1992. Each chipset consists of several [[coprocessors]] which handle [[raster graphics]], digital audio, [[direct memory access]] and communication between various peripherals (e.g., CPU, memory and floppy disks). In addition, some models featured auxiliary [[Amiga custom chips|custom chip]]s which performed tasks, such as, [[SCSI]] control and display de-interlacing. ==== Graphics ==== [[Image:HAM6example.png|thumb|right|A 4096 color [[Amiga Hold-and-Modify|HAM]] picture created with [[Photon Paint]] in 1989.]] All Amiga systems can display full-screen animated graphics with 32, 64 ([[Amiga Halfbrite mode|EHB Mode]]) or 4096 colors ([[Amiga Hold-and-Modify|HAM Mode]]). Models with the AGA chipset (A1200 and A4000) also have 128, 256 and 262144 ([[Amiga Hold-and-Modify|HAM Mode]]) color modes and a palette expanded from 4096 to [[Color depth#Truecolor|16.8 million colors]]. <!-- Something about retargetable graphic hardware here --> The Amiga chipset can ''[[genlock]]'' — adjust its own screen refresh timing to match an NTSC or PAL video signal. When combined with setting transparency, this allows an Amiga to overlay an external video source with graphics. This ability made the Amiga popular for many applications, and provides the ability to do [[Character generator|character generation]] and [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects far more cheaply than earlier systems. Some frequent users of this ability included wedding videographers, TV stations and their weather forecasting divisions (for weather graphics and radar), advertising channels, music video production, and 'desktop video'. The [[NewTek]] [[Video Toaster]] was made possible by the genlock ability of the Amiga. In 1988 the release of the Amiga A2024<ref>[http://www.amiga-hardware.com/showhardware.cgi?HARDID=863 Commodore: A2024]</ref> [[monochrome]] monitor gave Amiga a choice of various high-resolution graphic modes when used with compatible graphic cards. Previous versions only supported PAL or NTSC display resolutions. ==== Sound ==== The sound chip, named Paula, supports four sound channels (two for the left speaker and two for the right) with 8-bit resolution for each channel and a 6-bit volume control per channel. The analog output is connected to a low-pass filter, which filters out high-frequency aliases when the Amiga is using a lower sampling rate (see [[Nyquist limit]]). The brightness of the Amiga's power LED is used to indicate the status of the Amiga’s low-pass filter. The filter is active when the LED is at normal brightness, and deactivated when dimmed (or off on older A500 Amigas). On Amiga 1000 (and very first Amiga 500 and Amiga 2000 model), the power LED had no relation to the filter's status, a wire needed to be manually soldered between pins on the sound chip to disable
