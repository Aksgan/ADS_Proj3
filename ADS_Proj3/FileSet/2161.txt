The INSPIRE Directive entered into force on May 15, 2007. INSPIRE is based on the infrastructures for spatial information established and operated by the 27 Member States of the [[European Union]].<ref>[http://europa.eu/abc/european_countries/index_en.htm 27 Member States of the European Union]</ref> The Directive addresses 34 spatial data themes<ref>[http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/2/list/7 INSPIRE 34 spatial data themes]</ref> needed for environmental applications. To ensure that the spatial data infrastructures of the Member States are compatible and usable in a Community and transboundary context, the INSPIRE Directive requires that additional legislation or common Implementing Rules (IR) are adopted for a number of specific areas (Metadata, Interoperability of spatial data sets and services, Network Services, Data and Service Sharing and Monitoring and Reporting). These are published either as Commission Regulations.<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/droit_communautaire/droit_communautaire.htm#1.3.2 Commission Regulations]</ref> or as Decisions.<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/droit_communautaire/droit_communautaire.htm#1.3.4 Decisions]</ref> The Commission is assisted in the process of adopting such rules by a regulatory committee, INSPIRE Committee, composed of representatives of the Member States and chaired by a representative of the Commission (this is known as the Comitology procedure).<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regcomitology/index.cfm?do=FAQ.FAQ#1 Comitology]</ref> == INSPIRE Legislation == *[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:L:2007:108:SOM:EN:HTML INSPIRE Directive 14.03.2007] *[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32008R1205:EN:NOT INSPIRE Metadata Regulation 03.12.2008] *[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ%3AL%3A2009%3A148%3ASOM%3AEN%3AHTML Commission Decision regarding INSPIRE monitoring and reporting 05.06.2009] *[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ%3AL%3A2009%3A274%3ASOM%3AEN%3AHTML Regulation on INSPIRE Network Services 19.10.2009] *[http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/documents/Metadata/INSPIRE_corrigendum_metadata.pdf Corrigendum to INSPIRE Metadata Regulation 15.12.2009] *[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:083:0008:0009:EN:PDF Regulation on INSPIRE Data and Service Sharing 29.03.2010] *[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:323:0011:0102:EN:PDF COMMISSION REGULATION implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards interoperability of spatial data sets and services 10.12.2010] *[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:323:0001:0010:EN:PDF Commission Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 976/2009 as regards download services and transformation service 10.12.2010] == INSPIRE Geoportal == The INSPIRE Directive also envisages the creation of an INSPIRE Geoportal. A prototype INSPIRE Geoportal<ref>[http://www.inspire-geoportal.eu/ prototype INSPIRE Geoportal]</ref> is being developed at the [[Directorate-General of the Joint Research Centre (European Commission)|Joint Research Centre]], which allows for discovery and viewing of spatial data sets and services. Its aim is to identify issues related to its implementation and accessing distributed INSPIRE services, to help towards the development of the operational geoportal. == INSPIRE Conference == The INSPIRE Conference 2011<ref>[http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/events/conferences/inspire_2011/ EC.europa.eu]</ref> will take place from 27 June to 1 July 2011 in Edinburgh, Scotland. == INSPIRE Forum == INSPIRE Forum:<ref>[http://inspire-forum.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ EC.europa.eu]</ref> A Web 2.0 site for the exchange of information on INSPIRE and related initiatives. == Related initiatives == *INSPIRE is one of three related initiatives that are the subject of the GIGAS (''[[GEOSS]], [[INSPIRE]] and [[GMES]] an Action in Support'') harmonization project under the auspices of the [[EU]] [[7th Framework Programme]].<ref>[http://www.thegigasforum.eu/project/project.html The GIGAS Forum]</ref> == Notes == {{Reflist}} == See also == * [[Geoinformation]] * [[Spatial data infrastructure]] == External links == * [http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ INSPIRE website] * [http://inspire-forum.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ INSPIRE Forum] * [http://www.inspire-geoportal.eu/ INSPIRE Geoportal] * [http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/events/conferences/inspire_2010/callforpapers.cfm INSPIRE Conference 2010] [[Category:Geographic information systems]] [[Category:Spatial Data Infrastructure]] [[Category:European Union and science and technology]] [[Category:Science and technology in Europe]] [[Category:European research networks]] {{eu-stub}} [[cs:Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community]] [[da:INSPIRE]] [[de:Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community]] [[fr:Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community]] [[it:INSPIRE]] [[no:INSPIRE]] [[pl:Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community]] [[ro:INSPIRE]]</text> </page> <page> <id>18419</id> <title>Initialization on demand holder idiom</title> <text>In [[software engineering]], the '''Initialization on Demand Holder''' idiom ([[design pattern (computer science)|design pattern]]) is a [[lazy initialization|lazy-loaded]] [[Singleton pattern|singleton]]. The idiom can be implemented in both single-threaded/serial and concurrent environments, but care must be taken to correctly implement the idiom under concurrent conditions. == Example Java Implementation == This implementation is a well-performing and concurrent implementation valid in all versions of Java. The original implementation from Bill Pugh (see links below), based on the earlier work of Steve Quirk, has been modified to reduce the scope of <tt>LazyHolder.INSTANCE</tt> to private and to make the field final. <source lang="java"> public class Something { private Something() { } private static class LazyHolder { private static final Something INSTANCE = new Something(); } public static final Something getInstance() { return LazyHolder.INSTANCE; } } </source> === How it works === The implementation relies on the well-specified initialization phase of execution within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM); see section [http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/execution.html#44557 12.4 of Java Language Specification] (JLS) for details. When the class <tt>Something</tt> is loaded by the JVM, the class goes through initialization. Since the class does not have any static variables to initialize, the initialization completes trivially. The static class definition <tt>LazyHolder</tt> within it is ''not'' initialized until the JVM determines that <tt>LazyHolder</tt> must be executed. The static class <tt>LazyHolder</tt> is only executed when the static method <tt>getInstance</tt> is invoked on the class <tt>Something</tt>, and the first time this happens the JVM will load and initialize the <tt>LazyHolder</tt> class. The initialization of the <tt>LazyHolder</tt> class results in static variable <tt>INSTANCE</tt> being initialized by executing the (private) constructor for the outer class <tt>Something</tt>. Since the class initialization phase is guaranteed by the JLS to be serial, i.e., non-concurrent, no further synchronization is required in the static <tt>getInstance</tt> method during loading and initialization. And since the initialization phase writes the static variable <tt>INSTANCE</tt> in a serial operation, all subsequent concurrent invocations
