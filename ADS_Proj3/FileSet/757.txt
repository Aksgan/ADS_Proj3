like ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' and cartoons like [[Looney Tunes]] and [[Tom & Jerry (MGM)|Tom & Jerry]] have been shown internationally and almost non stop on television channels. Hereby particular film scenes have become well known even to people who hadn't seen these films on their original cinematic release. The same applies for television shows like ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' which have been repeated so often over the decades that certain episodes and scenes have become classics. When newsreels in the cinema gradually made place for television [[news broadcasting]] it became a habit for mass audiences to watch the daily news on television. Worldwide this led to a new kind of collective memory where various news events could be shown much quicker than with the cinema [[News Reel]]s. Therefore certain filmed news stories could be shown on the same day they happened and even live during the broadcast itself. Millions of people have viewed the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] in 1963, the landing of [[Apollo 11]] in 1969, the Wedding of [[Prince Charles]] and [[Princess Diana]] (1981) and the [[11 September 2001 attacks]] on their television. In fact, certain questions like ''"What were you doing when.... happened?"'', usually referring to a large, heavily mediatized event, have become a very important question in the history of the development of the collective memory. Many people can remember what they were doing when certain internationally big media events occurred and these type of questions are usually used as a sort of [[milestone]] in individual people's life. For example, ''"What were you doing when you heard that [[John Lennon]] was shot?"''. And due to television repeats these moments could be relived even long after the actual event happened. The introduction of [[video store]]s and [[video recorder]]s in the 1980s, the [[Internet]] in the 1990s and the [[DVD player]] and [[Youtube]] in the 2000s even increased the opportunity to view and check out famous and infamous movie and TV scenes. Thanks to all these innovations certain scenes have become part of audiences' collective memory. This makes it easy for journalists, comedians, advertisers, politicians, etc. to make references to these scenes, knowing that a large audience will recognise and understand them without further explanation. For example, when president [[Ronald Reagan]] concluded a speech on March 13, 1985 against the increase of taxes he said ''"Make my day"''. Most people in the audience and TV viewers understood the reference to the [[Clint Eastwood]] film ''[[Sudden Impact]]'' and laughed and cheered as a consequence of that. The dance moves from [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (music video)|music video for "Thriller"]]'' have been repeatedly shown on TV so much that they are instantly recognizable and therefore imitated frequently for comedic effect in films, TV shows, commercials, etc. Whenever a comedy show or film features a scene where someone is killed or threatened in a [[shower]] most people understand it's a parody of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. Various cartoons from [[Bugs Bunny]] to ''[[Shrek]]'' have spoofed famous [[fairy tales]], knowing that everybody is familiar with the original stories and will immediately laugh at every deviation. The roar of movie monster [[Godzilla]] and [[Johnny Weissmuller]]'s [[Tarzan yell]] have become instantly recognizable and easy to put into a context, even without the images. Numerous TV shows and films such as ''[[The Simpsons]], [[Family Guy]], [[Scary Movie]], the [[Shrek]] films, '', and the films of [[Mel Brooks]], have referenced, parodied, imitated and recreated these famous scenes, often to the point of [[overkill]]. Certain observers, like [[Kenneth Tynan]] in a quote from his diaries from October 19, 1975 have noted that due to the heavy rotation and repeats of all these famous film scenes, often even without their original context, they have become of the cultural consciousness. He wrote: ''"Nobody took into account the tremendous impact that would be made by the fact that films are permanent and easily accessible from childhood onward. As the sheer number of films piles up, their influence will increase, until we have a civilization entirely molded by cinematic values and behavior patterns."'' (Quoted from TYNAN, Kenneth, ''The Diaries of Kenneth Tynan'', Bloomsbury, 2001, page 66). The influence of television scenes on collective memory has been noticeable with children who are able to quote lines and songs from commercials, films and TV shows they have watched regularly. Some young children who have watched a large amount of television have been known to react in an unnatural way to certain situations, comparable with [[overacting]], because they recreate scenes they remember seeing in similar situations on television. There have been cases reported of people who've compared their own life too much with the romanticized, idealized life depicted in films and television series. They try to recreate the happy families, perfect love relationships,... they remember seeing on television or in movies. Not all scenes who were once collective memory are remembered as well today. Certain TV shows, commercials and films that were popular in one decade are shown less frequently on television in the next. So certain scenes don't rest in the collective memory of the next generation. Many references in old [[Bugs Bunny]] cartoons to [[Hollywood]] stars and radio shows who were famous in the 1940s, are almost obscure now to modern viewers. On the other hand certain scenes have remained in the collective memory, due to being so constantly repeated in other media and are well known even for people not familiar with the original film. For example: even people who never saw the film ''[[King Kong]]'' know there's a scene where the big gorilla climbs the [[Empire State Building]] with a human girl in his hand. This is yet another negative evolution of the multireferential films and TV shows. Younger audiences, unfamiliar with the original subject being referenced in a contemporary film or TV series, do not recognize the reference and assume that, for instance a [[Twilight Zone]] plot reference in [[The Simpsons]] has been thought up by the creators of [[The
