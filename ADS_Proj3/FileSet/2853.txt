It is a common [[failure mode]], and may be contrasted with [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]], [[Creep (deformation)|creep]], [[rupture]], or [[stress relaxation]]. The terms are used in [[forensic engineering]] and [[structural engineering]] when analysing product failure. Failure may occur because either the product is weaker than expected owing to a [[stress concentration]], or the applied load is greater than expected and exceeds the normal [[tensile strength]], [[shear strength]] or [[compressive strength]] of the product. ==Examples== {{Mechanical_failure_modes}} Examples include the many components which fail in [[car crash]]es, [[train crash]]es, and [[airplane crash]]es as a result of [[impact (mechanics)|impact]] loading. The problem for the investigator is to determine which failures have been caused by the crash, and which may have caused the crash. It usually involves examining the broken parts for signs of [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] crack growth or other damage to the part which cannot be attributed to the crash itself. For very large [[structural failure]]s such as the collapse of bridges, it is necessarily a long and tedious process of sifting the broken parts. ==See also== * [[Forensic engineering]] * [[Stress analysis]] * [[Structural engineering]] ==References== <references/> * ''Strength of Materials'', 3rd edition, Krieger Publishing Company, 1976, by Timoshenko S.,ISBN 0-88275-420-3 * ''Forensic Materials Engineering: Case Studies'' by Peter Rhys Lewis, Colin Gagg, Ken Reynolds, CRC Press (2004).

It is a guarantee by the transferring [[financial institution]] that the signature is genuine and the financial institution accepts [[legal liability|liability]] for any forgery. Signature guarantees protect [[shareholder]]s by preventing unauthorized transfers and possible [[investor]] losses. They also limit the liability of the [[transfer agent]] who accepts the certificates. Different institutions have different policies as to what type of identification they require to provide the guarantee and whether they charge a fee for such service (usually nominal if any.) Most institutions will not guarantee a signature of someone who has not already been their customer. A medallion signature guarantee is not the same as an acknowledgment by a [[notary public]], in the sense that a "signature guarantee" is a certification by the institution that the signature is authentic, and an acknowledgment is a certification by a notary public attesting that the signer signed a document voluntarily. == References == {{no footnotes|date=November 2009}} * {{cite web| url=http://www.sec.gov/answers/sigguar.htm | title=Signature Guarantees: Preventing the Unauthorized Transfer of Securities | publisher=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission| accessdate=2009-11-17 }} *{{cite web| url= http://www.state.gov/s/l/22700.htm | title=U.S. Department of State telegram to all U.S. diplomatic and consular posts abroad concerning medallion stamp guarantees| date=May 21, 2001| work=Digest of International Law| publisher=U.S. State Department| accessdate=2009-11-17}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Medallion Signature Guarantee}} [[Category:Securities]] [[Category:Personal identification]] {{econ-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>23909</id> <title>MediaMosa</title> <text>{{notability|Products|date=November 2010}} {{Orphan|date=November 2010}} '''MediaMosa''' is a [[robust]], [[flexible]] and highly [[scalable]] [[media management platform]]. It is already helping deliver rich content to [[educational organisations]] across the [[Netherlands]]. MediaMosa is software to build a Full Featured, Webservice Oriented Media Management and Distribution platform. With MediaMosa you can build a state-of-the-art, scalable Middleware Media Distribution Platform which facilitates access to, and usage of (shared) storage capacity, metadata databases, transcoding- and streaming servers. A MediaMosa platform offers functionality for searching, playing, uploading, transcoding, as well as a fine granularity media access control system towards its users. MediaMosa is based on the Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture and is designed to support content streaming applications by providing a back-end-, audio- and video-infrastructure. The main features of a MediaMosa platform are: * Delivery platform for audio, video (and in fact any other content) * Streaming of any format (e.g. Flash, H.264 MPEG-4 and WindowsMedia) * Transcoding based on FFmpeg * Flexible Metadata Element Sets * Access management functions on Media * Enhanced Still functions * Open Source under GPLv2 license MediaMosa is a free and open software package developed by [[Madcap_bv|Madcap]]. It is based on the [[Drupal]] CMS and supports the use of several other Open Source software such as
