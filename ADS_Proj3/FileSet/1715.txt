[[Twitter]] and emerged out of a wide variety of data storage problems. Gizzard operates as a [[middleware]] networking service that runs on the [[Java Virtual Machine]]. It manages [[Partition (database)|partitioning]] data across arbitrary backend datastores, that allows it to be accessed efficiently.<ref>http://engineering.twitter.com/2010/04/introducing-gizzard-framework-for.html</ref><ref>http://www.socialtimes.com/2010/04/twitter-open-sources-new-distributed-database-solution-gizzard/</ref> The partitioning rules are stored in a forwarding table that maps key ranges to partitions. Each partition manages its own [[Replication (computer science)|replication]] through a declarative replication [[tree]]. Gizzard handles both physical and logical shards. Physical shards point to a physical database backend whereas logical shards are trees of other shards.<ref>http://thechangelog.com/post/502232871/gizzard-twitter-just-sharded</ref> In addition Gizzard also supports [[Data migration|migrations]] and gracefully handles failures. The system is made eventually consistent by requiring that all write operations are [[idempotent]] and [[Commutativity|commutative]]. As operations fail they are retried at a later time.

She was Uganda's first woman to be the country's wildlife veterinary officer and was the star of the BBC documentary, Gladys the African Vet. In 2009 she won the [[Whitley Awards (UK)|Whitley Gold Award]] for her conservation work. ==Early life and studies== Interested in animals since the age of 12 while growing up in [[Kampala]], Kalema-Zikusoka started a wildlife club at her school and organized trips to [[Queen Elizabeth National Park]].[http://ctph.org/about_meet_staff_ctph.php], [http://www.whitleyaward.org/display.php?id=150] Her professional studies began when she won a scholarship to study at the [[University of London]] Royal Veterinary College.[http://www.whitleyaward.org/display.php?id=150] ==Personal life== Kalema-Zikusoka is married to Lawrence Zikusoka, a technology entrepreneur and one of the co-founders of Conservation Through Public Health. They have two children. ==Professional accomplishments== When Kalema-Zikusoka was 25, she was appointed to be the veterinary officer for the Ugandan Wildlife Service, which later merged with Uganda's national parks to become the [[Uganda Wildlife Authority]].[http://www.bigwavetv.com/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&cntnt01articleid=20&cntnt01origid=58&cntnt01returnid=57] She was first woman to hold that position.[http://www.whitleyaward.org/display.php?id=150] She pioneered the first wildlife translocations to restock Uganda's national parks following years of poaching during Uganda's civil wars. As part of her veterinary research, she identified parasite transmission from humans to mountain gorillas as a significant risk factor for gorillas.[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15338419] Following her demonstration of pathways for human diseases to harm or kill gorillas, Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka, Lawrence Zikusoka, and Stephen Rubanga then founded [[Conservation Through Public Health]] in order to improve both human and ecological health in Africa.[http://ctph.org/about_meet_staff_ctph.php] CTPH is a non-profit organization based in Uganda and the USA that conducts programs that protect gorillas and other wildlife from human and livestock disease risk; that reduce human and livestock diseases in the vicinity of wildlife; that increase the local use of family planning; and that use Information/Communication Technology both to help local development and to educate people about the environment.[http://ctph.org/about_method_ctph.php] Kalema-Zikusoka is the CEO of the organization. ==Honors, Awards, and Other Recognitions== Kalema-Zikusoka has received a number of honors, awards, and other public recognitions of her [[Environmentalism|environmental]] and [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] work. In 2009, she won the Whitley Gold Award, the top prize awarded in what has been considered the "[[Whitley Awards (UK)|Green Oscars]]".[http://www.whitleyaward.org/display.php?id=150]. In 2008, the [[San Diego Zoo]] gave her its Conservation-in-Action Award. [http://www.sandiegozoo.org/invite/zoonooz_article.pdf] In 2007, [[Seed Magazine]] named her one of their eight Revolutionary Minds in Science.[http://www.worldwildlife.org/efn/pdfs/efn%20news%20April%202008.pdf] In 2006, Kalema-Zikusoka was elected to an [[Ashoka: Innovators for the Public|Ashoka Fellowship]].[http://www.ashoka.org/node/3965] Kalema-Zikusoka was profiled in the BBC documentary, Gladys the African Vet.[http://www.bigwavetv.com/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&cntnt01articleid=20&cntnt01origid=58&cntnt01returnid=57] She has also been featured in documentaries in National Geographic, Animal Planet, MNet and Uganda Television.[http://ctph.org/about_meet_staff_ctph.php] She was chosen among nine international environmental leaders to write a letter to the next US President in [[Sierra Club]] Magazine, November/December 2008 issue. ==Selected publications== Kalema G. 1994.
