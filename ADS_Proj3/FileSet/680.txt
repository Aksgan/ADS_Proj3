number of services are made available online. These include the conversion of chemical names to [[chemical structure]]s, the generation of [[SMILES]] and [[InChI]] strings as well as the prediction of many physicochemical parameters and integration to a web service allowing NMR prediction. The organization is working with RSC to develop a [[hash table]] resolver for InChIKeys, shorter hashed forms of InChIs. ==See also== * [[eMolecules]] * [[NIST]] * [[PubChem]] * [[DrugBank]] * [[ChEBI]] * [[ChEMBL]] * [[List of software for molecular mechanics modeling|Software for molecular modeling]] == References == <references/> ==Further reading== {{morefootnotes|date=December 2010}} *''[[Chemical & Engineering News]]'', '''85'''(24), June 11, 2007. *{{cite journal |journal=Chemistry International |author=Antony Williams |title=ChemSpider and Its Expanding Web: Building a Structure-Centric Community for Chemists |date=Jan-Feb 2008 |volume=30 |issue=1 |url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/ci/2008/3001/ic_chemspider.html }} *{{cite journal |journal=Current Opinion in Drug Discovery & Development |author=Antony Williams |title=Public Chemical Compound Databases |date=Apr - May 2008 |volume=11 |issue=3 }} *{{cite journal |journal=Current Drug Metabolism |author=Sean Ekins, Manisha Iyer, Matthew D.

The chemical library can consist in simple terms of a series of stored chemicals. Each chemical has associated information stored in some kind of database with information such as the [[chemical structure]], purity, quantity, and physiochemical characteristics of the compound. == Purpose == In [[drug discovery]] [[high-throughput screening]], it is desirable to screen a [[drug target]] against a selection of chemicals that try to take advantage of as much of the appropriate [[chemical space]] as possible. The [[chemical space]] of all possible [[chemical structure]]s is extraordinarily large. Most stored chemical libraries do not typically have a fully represented or sampled chemical space mostly because of storage and cost concerns. However, since many molecular interactions cannot be predicted, the wider the chemical space that is sampled by the chemical library, the better the chance that [[high-throughput screening]] will find an "hit" -- a chemical with an appropriate interaction in a biological model that might be developed into a drug. An example of a chemical library in drug discovery would be a series of chemicals known to inhibit kinases, or in industrial processes, a series of catalysts known to polymerize resins. ==Generation of chemical libraries== Chemical libraries are usually generated for a specific goals and larger chemical libraries could be made of several groups of smaller libraries stored in the same location. In the [[drug discovery]] process for instance, a wide range of organic chemicals are needed to test against models of disease in [[high-throughput screening]]. Therefore, most of the chemical synthesis needed to generate chemical libraries in [[drug discovery]] is based on [[organic chemistry]]. A company that is interested in screening for [[kinase]] inhibitors in [[cancer]] may limit their chemical libraries and synthesis to just those types of chemicals known to have affinity for [[ATP binding site]]s or [[allosteric]] sites. Generally, however, most chemical libraries focus on large groups of varied [[organic chemical series]] where an [[organic chemist]] can make many variations on the same [[molecular scaffold]] or [[molecular backbone]]. Sometimes chemicals can be purchased from outside vendors as well and included into an internal chemical library. ==Design and optimization of chemical libraries== Chemical libraries are usually designed by chemists and [[chemoinformatics]]
