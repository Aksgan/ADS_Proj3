appeal to logic when writing to persuade using the appeal known as [[logos]]. This appeal is manifested in the supporting statements for the writer’s claim. In most cases, a successful appeal to logos requires tangible evidence, e.g., a quote from acknowledged written material. The writer will appeal to the rationality of the audience. Possibly the most important appeal for persuasive writers is the appeal to emotions or [[pathos]]. “A successful pathetic appeal will put the audience in a suitable mood by addressing their knowledge of or feelings about the subject” (Mendelson). This can be a very effective way to win over an audience! Most persuasive writing techniques use an effective combination of all three appeals. ==Traditional structure== Here are the traditional parts of persuasive writing that can be used to strengthen an argument. While these do not have to be followed exactly or in this order, they are helpful in forming the structure in persuasive writing. * [[Exordium (rhetoric)|Exordium]], or introduction * Narration, or background statement of the facts * Partition, or forecast of the topics to be presented * Conformation, or the confirmation of the piece. In contemporary English classes, this would be called the body of the text. * Refutation, or discussion of alternatives * Peroration, or a conclusion. It’s often helpful to tie the conclusion back to the introduction in order to strengthen your claim. * Rhetorical Questions, to get the reader thinking. ==You attitude== {{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}} "You attitude" is a technique in persuasive writing. especially in business writing, which produces goodwill and influences people favourably. It emphasises the reader's interest. It is an attitude of mind involving developing the view on a topic from the reader's point of view ('you') instead of the writer's ('me'). To use 'You attitude' in persuasive writing, the author should focus on what they want the reader to perceive from their content, minimise their own feelings, refer to the readers' requests, and use active voice. {{wikibooks|How to write an essay}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Persuasive Writing}} [[Category:Debating]] [[Category:Writing]]</text> </page> <page> <id>28935</id> <title>Peruvian Spider Monkey</title> <text>{{Taxobox | name = Peruvian Spider Monkey<ref name=msw3>{{MSW3 Groves|pages=150|id=12100395}}</ref> | status = EN | status_system = iucn3.1 | status_ref = <ref name=iucn>{{IUCN2008|assessors=Wallace, R.B., Mittermeier, R.A., Cornejo, F. & Boubli, J.-P.|year=2008|id=41547|title=Ateles chamek|downloaded=08 November 2008}} Database entry includes a brief justification of why this species is endangered.</ref> | regnum = [[Animal]]ia | phylum = [[Chordate|Chordata]] | classis = [[Mammal]]ia | ordo = [[Primate]]s | familia = [[Atelidae]] | genus = ''[[Ateles]]'' | species = '''''A. chamek''''' | binomial = ''Ateles chamek'' | binomial_authority = ([[Alexander von Humboldt|Humboldt]], 1812) | range_map = Peruvian Spider Monkey area.png | range_map_caption = Peruvian Spider Monkey range }} The Peruvian Spider monkey (Ateles ''chamek'') is a subspecies of black spider monkey that lives not only in [[Peru]], but also in [[Brazil]] and [[Bolivia]]. At two feet (0.6 m) long, they are relatively large among species of monkey, and their strong, prehensile tails can be up to three feet (1 m) long. Unlike many species of monkey, they have virtually no thumb. Peruvian spider monkeys live in groups of up to a dozen individuals called bands. They prefer to eat fleshy fruit, and this leads them to move among habitats, but they also eat small animals, insects and leaves based on availability. Females separate from the band to give birth, typically in the fall. Ateles ''chamek'' are independent at about 10 months, with a lifespan of about 20 years. ==Characteristics== Ateles ''chamek'' weighs up to 20 pounds (9 kg.)<ref> Haugaasen, T., and Peres, C.

Its body can be 24 inches (0.7 m) long and the tail can be 36 inches (1 m)long. It has four elongated fingers and virtually no thumb, which is typical for spider monkeys but unusual for other monkeys. It can move easily through the trees and it uses its tail like an extra limb. It has an agility that can only be compared to the gibbon of Asia. It has a life span of up to 20 years.<ref> Spider Monkeys, Great Book of the Animal Kingdom, Crescent Books, Inc., ISBN 0517088010 pp. 378-379 </ref> ==Distribution == The range of the Peruvian Spider monkey is not limited to Peru but also includes Bolivia and Brazil. <ref> Iwanaga, S., Ferrari S.F., 2002.
