of [[Unicron]], the Chaos-Bringer sent something back in his stead — a nearly dead Optimus Prime from that universe, who warned the Transformers of Unicron's coming into their universe before dying. == Devil's Due Publishing == Optimus Prime would also be a major character in [[Devil's Due Publishing]]'s various G.I. Joe meets the Transformers series. Little is known about this Prime's early years, save that he survived an assassination attempt by [[Bludgeon (Transformers)|Bludgeon]] soon after receiving the Matrix. From this point the traditional ''[[Ark (Transformers)|Ark]]'' storyline would leave the Transformers crashed on Earth. However, here they were not reactivated of their own accord: ''The Ark'' was discovered by the terrorist organization [[Cobra Command|Cobra]], and all the Transformers inside were reformatted into Cobra vehicles remotely controlled by the Televipers. Prime was turned into a Cobra Sentry Missile System tank (a 1985 [[Sears]] store exclusive red repaint of the HISS tank).<ref>[http://www.yojoe.com/vehicles/85/sms/ Sentry Missile System] - YOJOE.COM</ref> After an attack on a U.N. summit in Washington D.C. he was, however, able to get a message to [[Wheeljack]], alerting G.I. Joe to where the Cobra base was hidden. Subsequently he and the other captive Autobots (and Decepticons) broke free, and he battled and defeated his enemy Megatron. The Transformers then returned to Cybertron in a second Ark Class vessel, but not before gifting their human allies with a surprising technological boon: The ability to build and use [[mecha]] based on Transformers technology. Sadly, Prime's homecoming was not all he had hoped for: the Decepticon [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]] had taken control of the planet. Prime and the other Transformers were forced to go underground, waging a guerrilla war against the Decepticons. Around this time Cobra would attempt to steal Teletran-3, but their attempt to teleport directly into the chamber would set off a catastrophic malfunction, one that threatened to crack open time itself. Optimus Prime and the [[Stunticon]]s were amongst those who found themselves sent back in time. He was reformatted into a 1920s semi-truck. He was eventually rescued by [[Roadblock (G.I. Joe)|Roadblock]], [[Beach Head]] and the [[Baroness (G.I. Joe)|Baroness]] and helped to capture the Stunticons. In the wake of this incident the Transformers managed to reclaim much of Cybertron. Mindful of the dangers of allowing humans like Cobra access to Cybertronian technology, Prime sent [[Perceptor]], [[Grimlock]], [[Arcee]] and [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]] on a mission to Earth. As it turned out Prime's fears were well founded: the U.S. government had used parts from Megatron to create [[Serpentor|Serpent O.R.]], a cyborg designed to be a perfect weapon. A raid by Cobra allowed it to escape and gather an army of Decepticons on Cybertron, killing [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]] in the process. Despite the grief of losing Bumblebee, Prime continued on and rallied his comrades to do the same. Attacking the Autobot capital city, Serpentor's forces proved overwhelming, and Prime voluntarily to surrender to ensure the Decepticons would cease fire. Realizing Serpentor wanted the [[Autobot Matrix of Leadership]], Prime broke free as Serpentor was distracted, but was unable to kill him, promptly being attacked and beaten near death by [[Razorclaw]] and [[Stunticon|Motormaster]]. He was subsequently forced to watch as Serpentor opened the Matrix. The result was not what anyone expected — Serpentor was not only reformatted into a Transformers-size mechanoid but was shown the futility of the fighting by the Matrix. At this point [[Cobra Commander]] was able to take control of Serpentor's body, only being defeated by [[Hawk (G.I. Joe)|Hawk]] opening the Matrix, transforming him into a great leader and rendering Cobra Commander comatose. As the Joes prepared to head home, Prime promised to record the Hawk-led humans' future. Prime appeared again in the fourth crossover "Black Horizon". With the Matrix afflicted Hawk receiving dire visions of a new threat, Prime journeyed to Earth personally, taking Hawk and [[Flint (G.I. Joe)|Flint]] to Tibet to discover the source of the problem — only to encounter Bludgeon once again. The two battled, with Prime only being saved by Hawk's intervention. Fighting their way into a secret city beneath the [[Himalaya]]s, the trio realized the extent of the threat — the impending destruction of humanity by [[Unicron]], and the world being taken over by [[Cobra-La]]. However at that point they were discovered by Bludgeon and a group of Cobra-La troops. Prime defeated Bludgeon, although the warrior plummeted to his death despite Prime's best efforts. Prime, Hawk and Joe Colton (the original G.I. Joe) then gatecrashed the Cobra-La ceremony to sacrifice Firewall to Unicron in Prime's truck mode. Prime was then mobbed by Cobra-La warriors, and pinned down by a monstrous insectoid creature. Prime demolished them in time to save Hawk from [[Golobulus]]. With Cobra-La arrested by G.I. Joe, Prime checked his troops would recover — and then sat down to watch TV with [[Eject (Transformers)|Eject]] and Firewall. In the third series both Prime and Serpentor indicate that the Matrix had transformed Prime from "''a simple archivist''" into a great warrior, indicating that the history of this incarnation of Prime is roughly in line with that of the Dreamwave version. == IDW Publishing == When [[IDW Publishing]] received the comic rights to ''The Transformers'', author Simon Furman was hired to oversee the line. Furman decided that the Generation 1 continuity "was in need of ... a contemporary restart" so that the comic could retain a modern audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/features/112210635439697.htm |title=Transformers from IDW with Simon Furman: Interviews & Features Archive - Comics Bulletin |publisher=Silverbulletcomicbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref> Furman's revised continuity establishes Optimus Prime as the present-day leader of an Autobot army spread across the galaxy in small units, waging a covert war against teams of Decepticon infiltrators over resource-rich worlds. The ''[[The Transformers: Stormbringer|Stormbringer]]'' miniseries explains that the Transformer homeworld of Cybertron is a dead planet, ravaged by an ancient cataclysm caused by the Autobot-Decepticon War, one which forced Prime to ally with his arch-rival [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]] to eventually halt. In the series, the interference of [[Jetfire]] and the [[Technobots]] in a plot organized by the Decepticon [[Bludgeon (Transformers)|Bludgeon]] alerts Prime to the possibility that the Cybertronian
