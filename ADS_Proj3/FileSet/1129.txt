pole is the point of <math> j </math> passing through the origin of frame <math>i</math>. The '''acceleration''' matrix can be defined as the sum of the time derivative of the velocity plus the velocity squared :<math> H_{i,j(k)}=\dot{W}_{i,j(k)}+W_{i,j(k)}^2 </math> The velocity and the acceleration in frame <math> i </math> of a point of body <math> j </math> can be evaluated as :<math>\dot{P} = W_{i,j} P </math> :<math>\ddot{P} = H_{i,j} P </math> It is also possible to prove that :<math>\dot{M}_{i,j} = W_{i,j(i)} M_{i,j} </math> :<math>\ddot{M}_{i,j} = H_{i,j(i)} M_{i,j} </math> Velocity and acceleration matrices add up according to the following rules :<math> W_{i,k}= W_{i,j} + W_{j,k} </math> :<math> H_{i,k}= H_{i,j} + H_{j,k} + 2W_{i,j} W_{j,k}</math> in other words the absolute velocity is the sum of the drag plus the relative velocity; for the acceleration the Coriolis' term is also present. The components of velocity and acceleration matrices are expressed in an arbitrary frame <math>k</math> and transform from one frame to another by the following rule :<math> W_{(h)}=M_{h,k} W_{(k)} M_{k,h} </math> :<math> H_{(h)}=M_{h,k} H_{(k)} M_{k,h} </math> ===Dynamics=== For the dynamics 3 further matrices are necessary to describe the inertia <math> J </math>, the linear and angular momentum <math> \Gamma </math>, and the forces and torques <math> \Phi </math> applied to a body. Inertia <math> J </math>: :<math> J=\left[ \begin{array}{ccc|c} I_{xx} & I_{xy} & I_{xz} & x_g m \\ I_{xy} & I_{yy} & I_{yz} & y_g m \\ I_{xz} & I_{yz} & I_{zz} & z_g m \\ \hline x_g m & y_g m & z_g m & m \end{array}\right] </math> where <math> m </math> is the mass, <math> x_g,\, y_g,\, z_g </math> represent the position of the center of mass, and the terms <math> I_{xx},\,I_{xy},\ldots</math> represent inertia and are defined as :<math> I_{xx} =\int\int x^2 dm </math> :<math> I_{xy} =\int\int xy dm </math> :<math> I_{xz} =\ldots </math> :<math> \ldots </math> Action matrix <math>\Phi</math>, containing force <math> f </math> and torque <math> t </math>: :<math> \Phi = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc|c} 0 & -t_z & t_y & f_x \\ t_z & 0 & -t_x & f_y \\ -t_y & t_x & 0 & f_z \\ \hline -f_x & -f_y & -f_z & 0 \end{array}\right]</math> Momentum matrix <math>\Gamma</math>, containing linear <math> \rho </math> and angular <math> \gamma </math> momentum :<math> \Phi = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc|c} 0 & -\gamma_z & \gamma_y & \rho_x \\ \gamma_z & 0 & -\gamma_x & \rho_y \\ -\gamma_y & \gamma_x & 0 & \rho_z \\ \hline -\rho_x & -\rho_y & -\rho_z & 0 \end{array}\right]</math> the all the matrices are represented with the vector components in a certain frame <math>k</math>. Transformation of the components from frame <math> k </math> to frame <math> h </math> follows to rule : <math> J_{(h)}= M_{h,k} J_{(k)} M_{h,k}^T </math> : <math> \Gamma_{(h)}= M_{h,k} \Gamma_{(k)} M_{h,k}^T </math> : <math> \Phi_{(h)}= M_{h,k} \Phi_{(k)} M_{h,k}^T </math> The matrices described allow the writing of the dynamic equations in a concise way. Newton's law: : <math> \Phi = H J - J H^t </math> Momentum: : <math> \Gamma = W J - J W^t </math> The first of these equations express the Newton's law and is the equivalent of the vector equation <math> f = m a </math> (force equal mass times acceleration) plus <math> t = J \dot{\omega} + \omega \times J \omega </math> (angular acceleration in function of inertia and angular velocity); the second equation permits the evaluation of the linear and angular momentum when velocity and inertia are known. ==See also== * [[Robotics conventions]] * J.

It is estimated that members of the DLA are responsible for over 80 per cent of the dental laboratory services in the UK. == Origin == The DLA began as a division of the Surgical Instrument Manufacturers Association, later becoming a separate entity. The first meeting of the DLA Council took place in London in 1961. The first Secretary was John Wrench and administration was provided by a firm of accountants called Hughes Allan. In 1977 Trevor Roadley, a [[Nottingham]] dental laboratory owner was appointed as Secretary. Operating initially at his laboratory and then in the DLA's first premises, Roadley gradually built up the range of member services and heightened the standing of the association. The DLA moved to larger premises in Nottingham in 1986, a converted chapel that was being used as a dental laboratory. At this stage the DLA had approximately 400 members. In 1987 Bill Courtney took over as Secretary. Like Trevor before him, Bill was a dental laboratory owner and member of the DLA Council. By now the DLA was a recognised and respected member of the dental world and regularly met with organisations such as the [[General Dental Council]], [[Orthodontic Technicians Association]], [[British Dental Association]] and the [[Department of Health]]. These close relationships continue to this day and the DLA has
