Budd gained his Bachelor's degree in mathematics at [[Cambridge University]] where he was [[senior wrangler]]. He went on to a D.Phil. from Oxford University, studying numerical methods for nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations under the supervision of John Norbury. He spent three years as a fellow of [[St John's College, Oxford]] working in numerical analysis at the Oxford University Computing Laboratory and as a fellow sponsored by the [[Central Electricity Generating Board|CEGB]] developing numerical methods for third-order [[partial differential equation]]s. He went on to a permanent post as a lecturer in numerical analysis at the [[University of Bristol]] before gaining a position as Professor of Applied Mathematics at the [[University of Bath]] in 1995. His research interests involve the analysis, application and numerical analysis of the solution of nonlinear differential equations with a particular emphasis on problems which arise in industry. His recent work has been in geometric integration which aims to develop numerical methods which reproduce qualitative structures in differential equations. He is co-director of the interdisciplinary Centre for Nonlinear Mechanics at the [[University of Bath]] and is active in promoting interdisciplinary collaboration both nationally and internationally. Budd is a passionate populariser of mathematics, reflected in his appointment as Chair of Mathematics of the [[Royal Institution]] of Great Britain in 2000. He works on a number of projects with schools and has written a book, "Mathematics Galore", based on his series of popular talks. He has also made numerous guest appearances on national radio and television, such as on the BBC's The One Show [http://acoustics2005.bath.ac.uk/news/archive/2009/3/4/chrisbudd-oneshow.html] and popular science panel comedy game show It's Only a Theory [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00nf014]. He won the [[Leslie Fox Prize for Numerical Analysis]] in 1991. In 1999 he was one of ten scientists
