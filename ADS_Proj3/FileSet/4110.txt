or required for one or more people to perform a given task. This information can then be used for many purposes, such as [[personnel selection]] and [[training]], tool or equipment design, [[procedure]] design (e.g., design of [[checklist]]s or [[decision support systems]]) and [[automation]]. ===Work design=== [[Work design]] or job design in organizational development is the application of sociotechnical systems principles and techniques to the humanization of work. The aims of work design to improved job satisfaction, to improved through-put, to improved quality and to reduced employee problems, e.g., grievances, absenteeism. ==See also== {{Portal|Systems science}} * [[List of management topics]] * [[Complex systems]] * [[Cybernetics]] * [[Feedback]] * [[Human factors]] * [[Social network]] * [[Sociology]] * [[Systems theory]] * [[Systems science]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==Further reading== * Kenyon B.

The key to distinguishing Socratic questioning from questioning per se is that Socratic questioning is systematic, disciplined, and deep, and usually focuses on foundational concepts, principles, theories, issues, or problems. Socratic questioning is referred to in [[teaching]], and has gained currency in as a concept in [[education]] particularly in the past two decades.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} According to Paul and Elder (The Art of Socratic Questioning, 2006), teachers, students, or indeed anyone interested in probing thinking at a deep level can and should construct Socratic questions and engage in [[Socratic dialogue]]. When teachers use Socratic questioning in teaching, their purpose may be to probe student thinking, to determine the extent of student knowledge on a given topic, issue or subject, to model Socratic questioning for students, or to help students analyze a concept or line of reasoning. Students should learn the discipline of Socratic questioning so that they begin to use it in reasoning through complex issues, in understanding and assessing the thinking of others, and in following-out the implications of what they, and others think. In teaching, then, teachers can use Socratic questioning for at least two purposes: # To deeply probe student thinking, to help students begin to distinguish what they know or understand from what they do not know or understand (and to help them develop intellectual humility in the process). # To foster students' abilities to ask Socratic questions, to help students acquire the powerful tools of Socratic dialogue, so that they can use these tools in everyday life (in questioning themselves and others). To this end, teachers can model the questioning strategies they want students to emulate and employ. Moreover, teachers need to directly teach students how to construct and ask deep questions. Beyond that, students need practice to improve their questioning abilities. Socratic questioning illuminates the importance of questioning in learning (indeed [[Socrates]] himself thought that questioning was the only defensible form of teaching). It illuminates the difference between systematic and fragmented thinking. It teaches us to dig beneath the surface of our ideas. It teaches us the value of developing questioning minds in cultivating deep learning. Stephen Cox and Andy Griffith, UK based educational trainers, argue that integrating Socratic questioning techniques in the classroom is essential to developing active, independent learners. They identify 6 categories of questions: <ref>Cox and Griffith 'Outstanding Teaching' http://osiriseducational.co.uk/outstandingteaching/news/questions-questions-questions/</ref> '''1. Getting Students to clarify their thinking''' e.g. 'Why do you say that?', 'Could you explain further?' '''2.''' '''Challenging students about assumptions''' e.g. 'Is this always the case?', 'Why do you think that this assumption holds here?' '''3.''' '''Evidence as a basis for argument''' e.g. 'Why do you say that?', 'Is there reason to doubt this evidence?' '''4.''' '''Alternative viewpoints and perspectives''' e.g. 'What is the counter argument for?', 'Can/did anyone see this another way?' '''5.''' '''Implications and consequences''' e.g. 'But if what happened, what else would result?', 'How does...affect...?' '''6.''' '''Question the question''' e.g.'Why do you think that I asked that question?', 'Why was that question important?', 'Which of your questions turned out to be the most useful?' The art of Socratic questioning is intimately connected with [[critical thinking]] because the art of questioning is important to excellence of thought. What the word "Socratic" adds to the art of questioning is systematicity, depth, and an abiding interest in assessing
