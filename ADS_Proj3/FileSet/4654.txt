The book considers how the brain and genes evolved into their present condition over the course of thousands and millions of years. It was published by [[McGraw Hill]]. The book argues that the earlier [[ape]] brain had evolved “mindmakers” and that the human [[mind]] arose when these were “rewired” by [[symbols]]. This new “mindware” was created by the [[prefrontal cortex]] in combination with [[neural plasticity]]. This “Symbolic capacity is the ‘missing link’ that changed the ape brain into a human and made mindware possible, allowing symbols to structure the brain”.<ref name=" Winkelman">Winkelman, M. (2003).

But in the last 120,000 years [[Behavioral modernity| humans have changed]] from hunter-gatherers to [[High_technology#High-tech_society|hi-tech]] citizens. The book seeks to answer why and how. #'''Neurons Unlimited:''' The brain is neurally plastic ('''NP''') – [[evolution]] left open the function of human neurons. The capacity of its neurons to engage in [[imagination]] extends its potential to think and feel. #'''Superbrain:''' The prefrontal cortex ('''PC''') is the brain's "[[conducting|conductor]]". It directs using inner representations as prompts which organize the brain's "orchestra" of neural “talents”. #'''Mind-Engine:''' Cognition depends upon [[brain waves]] that [[neural binding|bind]] through [[Brainwave_synchronization|synchronization]] of diverse [[Brodmann_area|brain areas]] into mental unity. The prefrontal cortex controls this unification of the brain. #'''Neural Revolution:''' The large sized human [[Brain_size|brain]] has extensive "blank" cortex available for processing nonevolved skills. But acquiring such skills requires that the brain’s [[neural networks]] get “trained”—which the prefrontal cortex does by acting as a “cortical catalyst”. #'''Machiavellian Neurons:''' Humans like other [[apes]] live in [[social groups]] that [[Fission-fusion_society|split and reform]]. Humans are novel in their ability to decouple these [[Social_Solidarity|social]] and [[attachment theory| personal bonds]] from direct sensory contact. The human brain does this by carrying around its social group as an "inner troop within our heads". #'''The Troop within Our Heads:''' Humans think they are [[free will|free]]-- but this troop within their heads rules human thoughts, feelings and actions. Due to it humans feel [[guilt]], [[shame]], [[pride]] and [[self-consciousness]]. #'''Our Living Concern:''' Underlying human experience are mindmakers. One such mindmaker is the [[anterior cingulate]] as it creates attention to what is done. It underlies not only [[social consciousness]], but [[pain]], and a sense of reality. #'''Doing the Right Thing:''' Our sense of [[Morality|right and wrong]] arises from our origins as social apes. Morality is a byproduct of the troop within our heads that is created by the [[orbitofrontal cortex]] mindmaker. This limits human freedom by preventing [[psychopaths|psychopathic]]-like actions. #'''Where Memories are Made:''' The human sense of [[Identity_(social_science)|identity]] arises from the need of the brain to experience a past linked to the present. Here, the mindmaker is the [[hippocampus]]. It underlies [[memory]] and the sense of continuity of [[Self (psychology)|self]], other and place. #'''What Are We?:''' Mindmakers are not [[consciousness]] but they make it possible. They become the consciousness of "I" and "[[free will|will]]" by embodiment. The human brain embodies not only its body extension, but its “troop within its head” and the inner orchestration done by its prefrontal cortex. #'''Of Human Bonding:''' The change that turned apes into humans was the ability to decouple social and personal bonds from everyday contact. This allowed new kinds of bonds such as those of [[marriage]], [[Affinal_kin|in-law kin]], [[culture]] and [[religion]]. #'''The Symbolic Brain:''' [[Symbols]] enabled this decoupling of bonds. Symbols are cognitive stand-ins -- a [[wedding ring]] stands in for a [[marriage]] bond. The prefrontal cortex generates symbols. This enabled hunter-gatherer genes to develop new forms of social life including that of modern people. #'''[[Lucy_(Australopithecus)|Lucy]] and [[Kanzi]]:''' The symbol making potential of the prefrontal cortex arose to enable [[extended family]] bonds across the African [[savannah]]. “Gifted environments” also arose created by adults so young brains could be helped to learn and enrich their minds with symbols. #'''The Runaway Species:''' [[Homo]] brains expanded to be good [[parents]]. Successful brains selected partners with brains with which they could best raise children. A [[Fisherian runaway|runaway selection]] resulted between brain size, [[Sexual_selection|mate selection]] and skilled parenting. #'''The Billion-Hour Journey:''' That modern people are not hunter-gatherers is due to mindware – the mind expanding systems of symbols – that evolved in the last 120,000 years. The process started slow, but then “[[bootstrapping|bootstrapped]]” itself and accelerated. It now underlies the thoughts and feelings of modern huma #'''Third Millennium Brain:''' The rewriting of the brain's potentials that started in the
