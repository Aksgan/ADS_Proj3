A sample of British households was drawn and first interviewed in 1991. The members of these original households have since been followed and annually interviewed. The resulting data base is very popular among social scientists for quantitative analyses of social and economic change. One of the most important precursors of the BHPS is the [[Panel Study of Income Dynamics]] (PSID), established in the 60s at the [[University of Michigan]], Ann Arbor (USA). As a [[panel study|panel survey]] it is a form of [[longitudinal study]]. Since 2008, the BHPS has been integrated into the [[UKHLS]]. BHPS data are integrated into the [[European Community Household Panel]] and the [[Cross National Equivalent File]] (CNEF) which contains panel data from Australia, Canada, Germany, Great Britain and the United States. == See also== *[[Canadian Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics]] (SLID) *[[German Socio-Economic Panel]] (SOEP) *[[Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey]] (HILDA) *[[Panel Study of Income Dynamics]] (PSID) *[[Survey_on_Household_Income_and_Wealth]] (SHIW) == External links == *[http://www.iser.essex.ac.uk/ulsc/bhps/ Official website of the BHPS] *[http://www.esds.ac.uk/longitudinal/access/bhps/L33196.asp Access BHPS data via ESDS Longitudinal] {{socio-stub}} [[Category:Economic data]] [[Category:Social statistics data]] [[Category:University of Essex]] [[Category:Panel
