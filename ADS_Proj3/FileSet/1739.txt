locally finite if every point has a neighbourhood which has nonempty intersection with only [[finite set|finite]]ly many of the subsets. See also '''countably locally finite''', '''[[point finite]]'''. ;Locally metrizable'''/'''Locally metrisable: A space is locally metrizable if every point has a metrizable neighbourhood. ;[[Locally path-connected]]: A space is [[locally path-connected]] if every point has a local base consisting of path-connected neighbourhoods. A locally path-connected space is connected [[if and only if]] it is path-connected. ;Locally simply connected: A space is locally simply connected if every point has a local base consisting of simply connected neighbourhoods. ;[[Loop (topology)|Loop]]: If ''x'' is a point in a space ''X'', a [[loop (topology)|loop]] at ''x'' in ''X'' (or a loop in ''X'' with basepoint ''x'') is a path ''f'' in ''X'', such that ''f''(0) = ''f''(1) = ''x''. Equivalently, a loop in ''X'' is a continuous map from the [[unit circle]] ''S''<sup>1</sup> into ''X''. == M == ;[[Meagre set|Meagre]]: If ''X'' is a space and ''A'' is a subset of ''X'', then ''A'' is meagre in ''X'' (or of '''first category''' in ''X'') if it is the [[countable]] union of nowhere dense sets. If ''A'' is not meagre in ''X'', ''A'' is of '''second category''' in ''X''. ;Metric: See '''[[Metric space]]'''. ;Metric invariant: A metric invariant is a property which is preserved under isometric isomorphism. ;[[Metric map]]: If ''X'' and ''Y'' are metric spaces with metrics ''d''<sub>''X''</sub> and ''d''<sub>''Y''</sub> respectively, then a [[metric map]] is a function ''f'' from ''X'' to ''Y'', such that for any points ''x'' and ''y'' in ''X'', ''d''<sub>''Y''</sub>(''f''(''x''), ''f''(''y'')) ≤ ''d''<sub>''X''</sub>(''x'', ''y''). A metric map is [[metric map|strictly metric]] if the above inequality is strict for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''X''. ;[[Metric space]]: A [[metric space]] (''M'', ''d'') is a set ''M'' equipped with a function ''d'' : ''M'' &times; ''M'' → [[real number|'''R''']] satisfying the following axioms for all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in ''M'': :# ''d''(''x'', ''y'') ≥ 0 :# ''d''(''x'', ''x'') = 0 :# if ''d''(''x'', ''y'') = 0 then ''x'' = ''y'' (''identity of indiscernibles'') :# ''d''(''x'', ''y'') = ''d''(''y'', ''x'') (''symmetry'') :# ''d''(''x'', ''z'') ≤ ''d''(''x'', ''y'') + ''d''(''y'', ''z'') (''[[triangle inequality]]'') :The function ''d'' is a '''metric''' on ''M'', and ''d''(''x'', ''y'') is the '''distance''' between ''x'' and ''y''. The collection of all open balls of ''M'' is a base for a topology on ''M''; this is the topology on ''M'' induced by ''d''. Every metric space is Hausdorff and paracompact (and hence normal and Tychonoff). Every metric space is first-countable. ;[[Metrizable]]'''/'''Metrisable: A space is [[metrizable]] if it is homeomorphic to a metric space. Every metrizable space is Hausdorff and paracompact (and hence normal and Tychonoff). Every metrizable space is first-countable. ;Monolith: Every non-empty ultra-connected compact space ''X'' has a largest proper open subset; this subset is called a '''monolith'''. == N == ;[[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|Neighbourhood]]'''/'''Neighborhood: A neighbourhood of a point ''x'' is a set containing an open set which in turn contains the point ''x''. More generally, a neighbourhood of a set ''S'' is a set containing an open set which in turn contains the set ''S''. A neighbourhood of a point ''x'' is thus a neighbourhood of the [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] set {''x''}. (Note that under this definition, the neighbourhood itself need not be open. Many authors require that neighbourhoods be open; be careful to note conventions.) ;[[Local base|Neighbourhood base]]/basis: See '''[[Local base]]'''. ;Neighbourhood system for a point ''x'': A [[neighbourhood system]] at a point ''x'' in a space is the collection of all neighbourhoods of ''x''. ;[[Net (mathematics)|Net]]: A [[net (mathematics)|net]] in a space ''X'' is a map from a [[directed set]] ''A'' to ''X''. A net from ''A'' to ''X'' is usually denoted (''x''<sub>α</sub>), where α is an [[index set|index variable]] ranging over ''A''. Every [[sequence]] is a net, taking ''A'' to be the directed set of [[natural number]]s with the usual ordering. ;[[Normal space|Normal]]: A space is [[normal space|normal]] if any two disjoint closed sets have disjoint neighbourhoods. Every normal space admits a partition of unity. ;[[T4 space|Normal Hausdorff]]: A [[T4 space|normal Hausdorff]] space (or [[T4 space|'''T<sub>4</sub>''' space]]) is a normal T<sub>1</sub> space. (A normal space is Hausdorff [[if and only if]] it is T<sub>1</sub>, so the terminology is consistent.) Every normal Hausdorff space is Tychonoff. ;[[Nowhere dense set|Nowhere dense]]: A [[nowhere dense set]] is a set whose closure has empty interior. == O == ; [[Open cover]]: An [[open cover]] is a cover consisting of open sets. ; Open ball: If (''M'', ''d'') is a metric space, an open ball is a set of the form ''B''(''x''; ''r'') := {''y'' in ''M'' : ''d''(''x'', ''y'') < ''r''}, where ''x'' is in ''M'' and ''r'' is a [[positive number|positive]] [[real number]], the '''radius''' of the ball. An open ball of radius ''r'' is an '''open ''r''-ball'''. Every open ball is an open set in the topology on ''M'' induced by ''d''. ; Open condition: See '''open property'''. ; [[Open set]]: An [[open set]] is a member of the topology. ; [[Open map|Open function]]: A function from one space to another is [[open map|open]] if the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of every open set is open. ; Open property: A property of points in a [[topological space]] is said to be "open" if those points which possess it form an [[open set]]. Such conditions often take a common form, and that form can be said to be an ''open condition''; for example, in [[metric space]]s, one defines an open ball as above, and says that "strict inequality is an open condition". == P ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Closure (topology)]] --> ;[[Paracompact space|Paracompact]]: A space is [[paracompact space|paracompact]] if every open cover has a locally finite open refinement. Paracompact Hausdorff spaces are normal. ;[[Partition of unity]]: A partition of unity of a space ''X'' is a set of continuous functions from ''X'' to [0, 1] such that any point has a neighbourhood where all but a [[finite set|finite]] number of the functions are identically zero, and the sum of all the functions
