Commodore [[Amiga]], and later in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] for multiple platforms (RatQuest 20th Year Edition, 2002). Shortly after he began using computers, Schenck took a job as a designer at the [[Diablo Canyon Power Plant]]. There he earned a significant wage for designing pipe supports while continuing to develop as an artist in his time outside work. ==''Cold Iron''== A major commercial project for Schenck in the mid-1980s was the layout, design, and art of the songbook ''Cold Iron'', in which [[Leslie Fish]] sets Rudyard Kipling's poems to music. The book was published by Off-Centaur Publications in 1983 and 1987. Schenck also did art for the ''Centaur Pillow Book'', which contained erotic illustrations of fantastic creatures. ==Commodore 64== Schenck's involvement with computers grew when he obtained a Commodore 64. His involvement with the gaming community became very deep very quickly, and is displayed in various ways, including his Emily Patella comic for [http://infodoc.plover.net/nzt/NZT8.1.pdf the New Zork Times of Spring 1989]. He wrote several utility programs for the 64, including software for selecting the appropriate strings for a celtic [[harp]]. He also experimented with computer graphics on this system, producing his earliest computer art. Among his experiements were designs for software which would display graphically stunning banner pages at key points in adventure games that Schenck designed, comparable to the cut scenes of later software. The C64 was not the most crude computer medium Brad has worked with. The [[IBM-PC]]'s [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] graphics were significantly less sophisticated, yet Brad managed to create stunning images for this system for the game Mind-Roll by [[Epyx]]. ==Harp design and manufacture== Schenck turned his hand to the making of celtic harps for several years in the late 1980s. He learned the craft under the tutelage of [[Jay Witcher]], who also taught other famous harp makers such as [[Chris Caswell]] the craft. His harps were known for their excellent sound and beautiful decoration, but Schenck decided to leave the business as too much of the work was rote manufacturing that did not allow him to express himself artistically as much as he hoped to do. ==Amiga== The introduction of the Amiga provided an affordable computer platform with which Schenck was able to express himself artistically. Schenck used an Amiga 500 to develop [[Demo (computer programming)|demo]]s for the Amiga Killer Demo Contest. He won the contest for three years running, obtaining better hardware with which to work as well as opportunities to apply his art to computer games for a number of different developers. ==''The Labyrinth of Time''== After a number of successful projects Schenck sought to gain the control over a project that recalled his role playing game roots on the computer, ''[[The Labyrinth of Time]]''. He formed company Terra Nova Development with veteran programmer Michal Todarovic. The game was published by [[Electronic Arts]] and received moderate success, though it earned little revenue for the partners of Terra Nova Development. It is considered a classic today, both for its story line and for Schenck's art, and has been ported to current systems and re-released by Wyrmkeep Entertainment. ==Thousand Oaks Library Mural== Schenck painted a mural for the children's area of the public library in [[Thousand Oaks, California]]. It features characters from many famous children's books done in Schenck's distinctive style, wound into a single expansive composition which features images of children entering the piece at floor level. The unveiling of the mural featured a performance by Schenck's friend, musician [[Patrick Ball]]. ==Computer graphics work== Schenck has gone on to do further computer graphics work, including ''Star Trek: Starfleet Command III'', ''Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II'', ''Dinotopia'', ''I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream'', ''Return to Zork'' and ''Spirit of Excalibur''. ==Current work== Schenck has retired from computer graphics and has decided to return to producing print media, using computer tools with traditional methods. His favored theme is presently retro-futuristic. This theme can be seen in much of his prior work as well, such as the scenes of ''The Labyrinth of Time'' that are placed in the future. His current project is the development of a comic book using this theme, titled ''Empire State Patrol''. Much of Schenck's present and prior work can be seen on his personal website. ==See also== *[[The Labyrinth of Time]] *[[I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream (video game)]] *[[Retro-futurism]] *[[Cinemaware]] *[[The Three Stooges (video game)]] ==External links== *[http://www.webomator.com/bws/ Brad Schenck homepage] *[http://www.wyrmkeep.com/ Current publishers of The Labyrinth of Time] *[http://graphicdesignbasics.com/2006/interview-with-bradley-schenck.html An interview with Bradley W.
