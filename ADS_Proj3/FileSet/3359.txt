[[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]] survived the crash of the [[Ark (Transformers)|Ark]] on Earth, reformatted himself into a new form and now leads [[Ramjet (Transformers)|Ramjet]], [[Skywarp]], [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]], [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]] and the [[Constructicons]]. Optimus Prime has also returned to Earth commanding [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]], [[Cliffjumper]], [[Grimlock]], [[Jetfire]], [[Mirage (Transformers)|Mirage]] and [[Rodimus]] (formerly Hot Rod). In ''Crossing Over'' when the Cybertronians [[Skyfall (Transformers)|Skyfall]] and [[Landquake]] arrive on Earth unexpectedly Megatron attempts to destroy them, but Optimus Prime and his Autobots are able to drive Megatron away. == Convention comics == During Simon Furman's "Alignment", a text story available through the British Transformers convention called "Transforce", it is mentioned Prime fell during what was intended to be the final conflict with the Decepticons at Pinea Omicron, long after the events of the ''Generation 2'' comic book. He managed to defeat Galvatron II but in doing so was damaged such that Grimlock had to engage a stasis field around him to save his flickering Spark, making Prime a "living war monument". Though Prime's ultimate fate is unknown, in a story entitled "The Last Days of Optimus Prime", also from Transforce, Prime laments the new Transformers age without war and it seems he passes on to a Transformers [[afterlife]] referred to as "J'nwan". However the story is vague and may be a metaphor for Prime rejoining the Matrix as his time had come. In this realm, he was approached by the [[Predacon (Transformers)|Predacon]] [[Sandstorm (Transformers)|Sandstorm]], who tried to plead for the help of Prime and the other legendary Transformers in dealing with a [[Unicron]]/Predacon hybrid named Shokaract. Prime refused, but later led a group of Transformers (including Megatron, [[Grimlock]] and [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]]) to distract the creature while [[Primus (Transformers)|Primus]] dealt the killing blow. == Dreamwave Productions == In the 21st century reimagining of the original continuity by [[Dreamwave]] Productions, Optimus Prime started life as Optronix (Orion to his friends), a data archivist. After taking note of a battle in which the Autobot leader [[Sentinel Prime]] had been killed by [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]], he was summoned to the Council of Elders and informed that the Matrix had chosen him to be the next leader of the Autobots. He received the [[Matrix of Leadership|Autobot Matrix of Leadership]] shortly thereafter, and almost arranged for the Autobot evacuation of Cybertron, intending to leave the Decepticons to their own devices, until a battle with Megatron beneath the planet's surface, accompanied by visions from the Matrix, stirred him on to fight for the safety of his homeworld. It is interesting to note that in this reimagining, Optimus actually ''was'' physically changed in appearance and size by the Matrix during the events of the first volume of ''War Within''. Some time into his role as leader, Prime disappeared in a spacebridge experiment along with Megatron, but returned some time later, having spent a period of time on [[Quintessa]]. Events during this period have gone unrecorded as a result of Dreamwave's closure. The actual events of the Autobots and Decepticon coming to Earth were never printed by Dreamwave comics, but flashbacks of the events were seen which suggest evenkening of the Transformers on Earth, the Autobots allied with humankind and eventually defeated the Decepticons at the turn of the century. They planned to return to Cybertron aboard the newly constructed ''[[Ark (Transformers)|Ark II]]'', but the ship was destroyed as part of a military conspiracy to take control of the Transformers. However, a [[terrorist organization]] run by the enigmatic Lazarus was able to seize control of several of the Transformers that fell back to Earth, while the U.S. military located Prime's body. Before his departure, Prime had entrusted a small portion of the Matrix to [[Spike Witwicky]], who was forced by the product chief, General Hallo, to use it to reactivate Prime. Functional again, Prime used the Matrix to reactivate more of his fallen comrades, and then faced off against Megatron in [[San Francisco]]. Following this, Prime began to experience subconscious urgings, leading both the Autobots and the Decepticons to the Arctic Circle, where [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]] arrived to greet them â€” and arrest them as war criminals. Shockwave had succeeded in ending the war on Cybertron, but Prime soon fell in with a rebel Autobot group that had discovered Shockwave had greater agenda. Rallying Transformers across Cybertron to the cause, Prime faced Shockwave in battle but was defeated and had the Matrix ripped from him and used to activate Vector Sigma. Before Shockwave could make full use of the mega-computer's data, however, [[Ultra Magnus]] (in this continuity, Prime's brother) arrived and bested him. The injuries Prime took in this conflicted necessitated a prolonged restoration period in stasis but Dreamwave's closure meant that Prime never appeared in their pages again. Art from unreleased issues later showed Optimus Prime awakening from the cryo regeneration chamber and freeing Alpha Trion from Shockwave's lab. Prime would make one further surprise appearance in Dreamwave's ''Transformers: Armada'' comic series, although it would not be the Prime of the Dreamwave first series. When [[Optimus Prime (Unicron Trilogy)|the Optimus Prime of the ''Armada'' universe]] disappeared, pulled into another dimension by the power
