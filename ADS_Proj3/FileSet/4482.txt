It is based on, and is a variation of, the [[Nisan-years]]. Tishri-years is often called the Jewish Civil Calendar, in contrast to [[Nisan-years]], which is often called the Jewish [[Nisan-years|Religious Calendar]]. Tishri-years is similar to, and sometimes equivalent to, the [[Macedonian years]] practices by the Hellenistic empires (332-30 BC). They are all lunisolar years beginning from Autumn, but could differ by a month. While the [[Nisan-years]] begin the year from the Spring season, around the [[Vernal Equinox]]/[[Spring Equinox]] (Gregorian March 20/21), the Tishri-years begin the years from the Autumn season, around the [[Autumn Equinox]] (Gregorian September 22/23). The [[New Years Day]] of the Tishri-years is called ''Rosh Hashanah'' ("Head of the Year"); it begins the [[Fall Feasts]] of Israel. Tishri 1, however, is not determined directly by its relationship to the [[Autumn Equinox]]. It depends on the determination of Nisan 1, which is the day after the [[New Moon]] closest to the [[Spring Equinox]] (within fifteen days before or after). Tishri 1 is the first day of the seventh month. Although the month number is always counted from Nisan, in the Tishri-years, the year begins and ends with Tishri 1.<ref>Jack Finegan, Handbook of Biblical Chronology, rev ed.

Although meterological conditions may cause a few days of delay for each [[Rosh Codesh]] ("Head of the Month"), over all the erros will cancel each other, and the calendar system remained accurate. After the fourth century AD, [[Hillel II]] fixed the [[Jewish Talmudic Calendar]] by a mathermatical algorithm, in order for Jews all around the world to observe the feasts accordingto the same calendar. This caused the Jewish calendar to gradually depart from the actual seasons, due to the accumulated errors.<ref>A. O. Scheffler and P. P. Scheffler, Calmaster2000: Dates, Holidays, Astronomical Events (Pittsburgh, PA: Zephyr Services).</ref> The origin of the Tishri-years tradition can be traced to King [[David]], who was ordained the king of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] (the two southern tribes) on Tishri 1, 1010 BC, before he was ordained the king of Israel (the ten northern tribes) on Nisan 1, 1002 BC. It seemed that [[David]] still used the [[Nisan-years]] in chronicling his years, but King [[Solomon]] made it a national calendar commemorating his great father. And after the split of the kingdom in 931/930 BC, the northern kingdom [[Israel]] continued using [[Nisan-years]], while the southern kingdom
