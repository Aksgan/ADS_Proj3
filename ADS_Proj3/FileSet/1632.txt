Users have the ability to customize their avatar in many ways, including skin tone, eye style and color, hair style and color, gender and attire. Numerous clothing items and accessories for avatars can be purchased from a range of [[Non-player character|NPC]]-run stores using the site [[virtual currency|currencies]], Gaia Gold and Gaia Cash. Avatars appear next to posts in the forums and profile comments (the post itself encapsulated in a "speech bubble"), and in Gaia Towns and other environments the avatar appears as a movable character that can travel from place to place, interacting with the environment (catching bugs, shaking trees and rocks for gold, digging for buried treasure, collecting trash and flowers etc.) and other users. [[Image:Gaia-Avatar.jpg|thumb|An example of a Gaia Avatar.]] ==Forums== Forums are the public message boards. There is a large variety of different forums in which a user can post in, such as forums discussing topics regarding the Gaia community and [[NPC]] story lines, day-to-day regular conversation and lifestyle discussions, various types of [[Role playing|role play]], general entertainment, featured games on Gaia, and artist discussions. There are also forums for users to buy and sell items, as well as a forum for user-run businesses, e.g. art commissions, and thread-bumping services. Users may make threads in almost every forum per each forum's guidelines. ==Economy== ===Currency=== The [[virtual currency|currency]] used in Gaia is known as "Gaia Gold", commonly referred to as '''gold'''. Gold is regularly distributed to users as they browse around the website, post in the forums, play games, and participate in other various events and contests; the site also rewards users every day with random gold or items from the Daily Chance. In July 2007, Gaia released another virtual currency called '''Gaia Cash''', which can be purchased with real money; $1 USD is equivalent to 100 Gaia cash. Gaia Cash cards can be bought at [[Rite Aid]], [[Wal-Mart]], [[Target]] stores, [[7-11]], [[Speedway SuperAmerica]], and [[GameStop]]. Gaia Cash cards are offered in $10 and $25 amounts. On June 21, 2010 [[7-11]] stopped stocking the $10 Gaia Cash cards.<ref name="Where in the World
