The son of [[Louis Dudek]], he was made a Dawson Scholar of that university (an honorary title) and directs the mobile robotics laboratory there. He was awarded a James McGill chair in 2008. According to his biography, he has written over 150 refereed articles on computer vision and robotics {{As of|2005|lc=on}}, and is co-author (with Michael Jenkin) of the book ''Computational Principles of Mobile Robotics'' which is used to teach robotics at a number of universities. His lab among the first in Canada to deal substantively and specifically with issues concerning mobile robotic systems. Prof. Dudek has an [[Erd&#337;s number]] of 3, having co-authored a paper with [[Sue Whitesides]]. ==Research== His research deals with sensing for robots and has included theoretical work on the complexity of robot localization and the development of underwater and amphibious robots. He has worked on the use of topological maps and the complexity of topological mapping, an abstract idealized form of robotics problem. He has also looked at robot position estimation using photographic data, and the automated detection of interesting images. With his colleagues he produced the first formal proof of the complexity of global robot locaization in a metric environment (i.e how hard it is, in the worst possible case, for a robot to determine its position if it totally lost). Gregory has a wide range of research interests that all have the common theme of robotics. He works students in the Mobile Robotics Lab
