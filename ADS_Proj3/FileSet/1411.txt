<math>ARA(w) =-\frac{u''(w)}{u'(w)}</math> The Arrow&ndash;Pratt measure of relative risk aversion is: : <math>RRA(w) =-\frac{wu''(w)}{u'(w)}</math> Special classes of utility functions are the CRRA ([[constant relative risk aversion]]) functions, where RRA(x) is constant, and the CARA ([[constant absolute risk aversion]]) functions, where ARA(w) is constant. They are often used in economics for simplification. A decision that maximizes expected utility also maximizes the probability of the decision's consequences being preferable to some uncertain threshold (Castagnoli and LiCalzi,1996; Bordley and LiCalzi,2000;Bordley and Kirkwood, ). In the absence of uncertainty about the threshold, expected utility maximization simplifies to maximizing the probability of achieving some fixed target. If the uncertainty is uniformly distributed, then expected utility maximization becomes expected value maximization. Intermediate cases lead to increasing risk-aversion above some fixed threshold and increasing risk-seeking below a fixed threshold. {{further|[[Risk aversion]]}} ===Examples of von Neumann-Morgenstern utility functions=== The utility function <math>u(w)=\log(w)</math> was originally suggested by Bernoulli (see above). It has relative risk aversion constant and equal to one, and is still sometimes assumed in economic analyses. The utility function <math> u(w)= -e^{-aw}</math> exhibits constant absolute risk aversion, and for this reason is often avoided, although it has the advantage of offering substantial mathematical tractability when asset returns are normally distributed. Note that, as per the affine transformation property alluded to above, the utility function <math>K-e^{-aw}</math> gives exactly the same preferences orderings as does <math>-e^{-aw}</math>; thus it is irrelevant that the values of <math>-e^{-aw}</math> and its expected value are always negative: what matters for preference ordering is which of two gambles gives the higher expected utility, not the numerical values of those expected utilities. The class of constant relative risk aversion utility functions contains three categories. Bernoulli's utility function :<math> u(w) = \log(w)</math> has relative risk aversion equal to unity. The functions :<math> u(w) = w^{\alpha}</math> for <math>\alpha \in (0,1)</math> have relative risk aversion equal to <math>1-\alpha</math>. And the functions :<math> u(w) = -w^{\alpha}</math> for <math>\alpha < 0</math> also have relative risk aversion equal to <math>1-\alpha</math>. See also [[Risk aversion#Absolute risk aversion|the discussion]] of utility functions having hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA). ===Measuring risk in the expected utility context=== Often people refer to "risk" in the sense of a potentially quantifiable entity. In the context of [[modern portfolio theory|mean-variance analysis]], [[variance]] is used as a risk measure for portfolio return; however, this is only valid if returns are [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] or otherwise [[elliptical distribution|jointly elliptically distributed]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2296336 |author=Borch, K. |title=A note on uncertainty and indifference curves |url=http://jstor.org/stable/2296336 |journal=Review of Economic Studies |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=1–4 |year=1969 |month=January }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0022-0531(83)90129-1 |author=Chamberlain, G. |title=A characterization of the distributions that imply mean-variance utility functions |journal=Journal of Economic Theory |volume=29 |pages=185–201 |year=1983}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2328079 |author=Owen, J., Rabinovitch, R. |title=On the class of elliptical distributions and their applications to the theory of portfolio choice |url=http://jstor.org/stable/2328079 |journal=Journal of Finance |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=745–752 |year=1983}}</ref> However, D.

Let utility of wealth be given by <math> u(w)= w-be^{-aw}</math> for individual-specific positive parameters ''a'' and ''b''. Then expected utility is given by :<math> \begin{align} \operatorname{E}[u(w)]&=\operatorname{E}[w]-b\operatorname{E}[e^{-aw}]\\ &=\operatorname{E}[w]-b\operatorname{E}[e^{-a\operatorname{E}[w]-a(w-\operatorname{E}[w])}]\\ &=\operatorname{E}[w]-be^{-a\operatorname{E}[w]}\operatorname{E}[e^{-a(w-\operatorname{E}[w])}]\\ &= \text{Expected wealth} - b \cdot e^{-a\cdot \text{Expected wealth}}\cdot \text{Risk}. \end{align} </math> Thus the risk measure is <math>\operatorname{E}(e^{-a(w-\operatorname{E}w)})</math>, which differs between two individuals if they have different values of the parameter <math>a</math>, allowing different people to disagree about the degree of risk associated with any given portfolio. ==Behavioral decision science: Deviations from expected utility theory== Like any [[mathematical model]], expected utility theory is an abstraction and simplification of reality. The mathematical correctness of expected utility theory and the salience of its primitive concepts do not guarantee that expected utility theory is a reliable guide to human behavior or optimal practice. Similarly, the mathematical correctness and practical salience of classical mechanics does not imply that engineers may build bridges and dams without errors; indeed, civil engineering projects result in structural failures in dams and bridges in roughly five percent of cases{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}. The mathematical clarity of expected utility theory has helped scientists design experiments to test its adequacy, and to distinguish systematic departures from its predictions. ===Conservatism in updating beliefs=== It is well established that humans find logic hard, mathematics harder, and probability even more challenging{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. Therefore, it is unsurprising that psychologists have discovered systematic violations of probability calculations and behavior by humans{{Opinion|date=June 2010}}. In updating probability distributions using evidence, a standard method uses [[conditional probability]], namely the [[Bayes's rule|rule of Bayes]]. Some experiments on [[belief revision]] have suggested that humans change their beliefs faster when using Bayesian methods than when using informal judgment.<ref>Subjects changed their beliefs faster by conditioning on evidence (Bayes's theorem) than by using informal reasoning, according to a classic study by the psychologist Ward Edwards: {{ cite book| author=Edwards, Ward| chapter=Conservatism in Human Information Processing|editor=Kleinmuntz, B| title=Formal Representation of Human Judgment|publisher=Wiley|year=1968}} {{ cite book| author=Edwards, Ward| chapter=Conservatism in Human Information Processing (excerpted)|editor=[[Daniel Kahneman]], [[Paul Slovic]] and [[Amos Tversky]]| title=Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1982}} <br /> {{ cite book| last1=Phillips|first1=L.D.|last2=Edwards|first2=W.|chapter=Chapter 6: Conservatism in a simple probability inference task (''Journal of Experimental Psychology'' (1966) 72: 346-354) |title=A Science of Decision Making:The Legacy of Ward Edwards| author=Edwards, Ward| editor=Jie W.
