Babies will be released, the remainder of future retail styles will be produced under the new line, in which collectors can purchase their Beanies and use a scratch-off code to go online and play with their new pet in a virtual world, much akin to other collectibles like [[Neopets]] and [[Webkinz]]. ===Tags=== The tags on Beanie Babies are considered a very important part when assessing their orverall value. It is widely believed by collectors that a Beanie without a tag or a damaged tag loses up to half of its value. Every Beanie Baby has least two factory made tags: a [[swing tag]] (also known as a "hang tag", "ear tag" or "name tag") which includes the beanies name, date of birth and a small story. There is also the [[tush tag]] (usually attached to the Beanie's rear end). Both tags have gone through many changes over time; these changes have become known as "generations". There are currently 15 generations of swing tags and 13 generations of tush tags. Additionally, there are also extra tags for certain regions that include things like safety information to comply with the Canadian [[Stuffed Articles Act]] or the [[CE Mark]] requirements in [[Europe]]. A few tag "generations" have become particularly noteworthy. Most Beanie Babies with first, second, or third generation hang tags have held their value (or in the case of some harder to find styles, increased in value), while fourth and fifth generation hang tags indicate Beanies that were available during the Beanie fad. ===Beanie Babies 2.0=== In an attempt to beat out the Webkinz craze,{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} in early 2008, Ty decided it was time for Beanie Babies to go online. This new version of Beanie Babies was called [[Beanie Babies 2.0]]. The purchase of a Beanie Baby 2.0 provided its owner with a code to access a Beanie Babies interactive website. ===Rarity=== {{Unreferenced section|date=January 2008}} During the Beanie Baby craze, the rarest general issue beanie, according to the Winter 2000 edition of ''Ty Beanie Babies'', published by Collectors Value Guide, was considered to be the dark blue variation of "Peanut" the elephant. [[List of Beanie Babies#P|Peanut]] was available well into 1998 in a lighter hue, but the dark blue version that was only made accidentally in 1995 rose in value because of its scarcity. "Nana the monkey" was considered the second rarest Beanie Baby; because only a few early 3rd gen tags use that name instead of Bongo. The early wingless version of "Quackers" the [[duck]], "Chilly" the [[polar bear]], the earlier versions of "Nip" and "Zip" the cats, "Peking" the [[panda bear]]; "Teddy" the bear (Especially the cranberry coloured one) and "Humphrey" the [[camel]] also command high prices. Some special edition Beanies, such as the #1 Bear or the Billionaire bears (which are only available as gifts to Ty employees), are hard to come across and highly valued. Earlier editions of common Beanie Babies (particularly with first or second generation hang tags) are often sought-after by collectors. Particular hang tag variations in mint condition continue to make record prices on [[eBay]]. In the hysteria of the late 90s, the bears were perceived to be the most sought-after beanies, and often carried inflated price tags - however, many of the popular bears have since turned out to be fairly common.<ref>{{cite news|title= Beanie Move Giving Rise To Skepticism|work= New York Times|date=1999-09-02|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/02/business/beanie-move-giving-rise-to-skepticism.html?scp=5&sq=beanie%20bears&st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-12 | first=Dana | last=Canedy}}</ref> As of 2010, the overwhelming majority of Beanie Babies end up in large lots that sell for $2 or less per plush beanbag.<ref>{{cite news|title=8 nearly worthless collectibles|work=MSN|url=http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/SavingandDebt/SaveMoney/8-completely-worthless-collectibles.aspx?cp-documentid=26131547}}</ref> ==Notable Beanie Babies== ===Garcia the bear=== '''Garcia''' the bear was released in January 1996 and retired in May 1997. He is a [[tie-dye]]d bear that seems to be a tribute to [[Jerry Garcia]] of [[The Grateful Dead]]. A group of differently colored dancing bears, originally artwork from the back of an album cover, was one of the band's many iconic images. The guitarist and the bear share a birthday, but the bear was supposedly "born" the year that Jerry died (Aug 9, 1995). The fast retirement for this Beanie Baby was due to an alleged lawsuit that the Garcia family filed against the Ty company, claiming that the name "Garcia" was used without permission from the family. In cooperation with the lawsuit, Garcia was retired and a similar bear named '''Peace''' was released. The bright colors on Garcia the bear made him one of the most popular Beanie Baby styles. Many people enjoy trying to find different colors on Garcia and community of tie-dye collectors <ref>[http://magazine.peacebears.com/ Peace Mania Magazine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> continue to make the bear's value unpredictable. ===Princess the bear=== [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] died on August 31, 1997. Warner announced the Beanie Baby Princess on October 29, 1997 in honor of Princess Diana.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/05/magazine/sunday-july-5-1998-crime-a-world-gone-beanie-mad.html?scp=2&sq=beanie%20bears&st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=SUNDAY, JULY 5, 1998: CRIME; A World Gone Beanie Mad! | date=1998-07-05}}</ref> Warner said that all proceeds would be donated to the Diana, [[Princess of Wales Memorial Fund]]. The Princess Diana Beanie Baby was sent to vendors to distribute in the second week of December 1997. Some vendors had to wait until February 1998. Only 12 Beanie Baby Princesses were released to each vendor initially, but this changed due to strong demand. On the other hand, '''Princess''' bears are dark purple. She has a symbol on the right side of her chest which is a rose with white petals on it. '''Princess'''' rear end tag which says her name is special, because it is in a cursive-like font. Some '''Princess''' bears have a heart on their tag protector, if any. ===Decade the bear=== [[File:Decadethebear.JPG|thumb|right|180px|'''Decade''' the bear]] '''Decade''' the bear was made in honor of Beanie Babies' tenth anniversary. Decade bears were made in white, royal blue, red, purple, orange, hot pink, green, gold, brown, and light blue. Most '''Decade''' bears have silver sparkles on their bodies. ==Counterfeit Beanie Babies== Counterfeit Beanie Babies began to surface in 1997. Early on, cheap knock-offs and fakes of
