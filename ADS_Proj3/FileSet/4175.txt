When ''v'' is zero, ''γ'' is equal to one, giving rise to the famous {{nowrap|''E'' {{=}} ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}} formula for [[mass-energy equivalence]]. Since the ''γ'' factor approaches infinity as ''v'' approaches ''c'', it would take an infinite amount of energy to accelerate an object with mass to the speed of light. The speed of light is the upper limit for the speeds of objects with positive rest mass.<ref> {{cite web |last=Fowler |first=M |date=March 2008 |title=Notes on Special Relativity |url=http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/252/SpecRelNotes.pdf |page=56 |publisher=[[University of Virginia]] |accessdate=2010-05-07 }}</ref> [[File:Relativity of Simultaneity.svg|thumb|right|Event A precedes B in the red frame, is simultaneous with B in the green frame, and follows B in the blue frame.|alt=Three pairs of coordinate axes are depicted with the same origin A; in the green frame, the x axis is horizontal and the ct axis is vertical; in the red frame, the x′ axis is slightly skewed upwards, and the ct′ axis slightly skewed rightwards, relative to the green axes; in the blue frame, the x′′ axis is somewhat skewed downwards, and the ct′′ axis somewhat skewed leftwards, relative to the green axes.

One argument for this follows from the counter-intuitive implication of special relativity known as the [[relativity of simultaneity]]. If the spatial distance between two events A and B is greater than the time interval between them multiplied by ''c'' then there are frames of reference in which A precedes B, others in which B precedes A, and others in which they are simultaneous. As a result, if something were travelling faster than ''c'' relative to an inertial frame of reference, it would be travelling backwards in time relative to another frame, and [[causality (physics)|causality]] would be violated.{{#tag:ref|It is thought that the [[Scharnhorst effect]] does allow signals to travel slightly faster than ''c'', but the special conditions in which this effect can occur prevent one from using this effect to violate causality.<ref> {{cite journal |last=Liberati |first=S |last2=Sonego |first2=S |last3=Visser |first3=M |year=2002 |title=Faster-than-c signals, special relativity, and causality |journal=[[Annals of Physics]] |volume=298 |pages=167–85 |doi=10.1006/aphy.2002.6233 |id={{arxiv|gr-qc/0107091}} }}</ref>|group="Note"}}<ref name="Taylor_p74"> {{Cite book |last=Taylor |first=EF |last2=Wheeler |first2=JA |year=1992 |title=Spacetime Physics |pages=74–5 |publisher=[[W.

However, the only physical entities that are moving are the laser and its emitted light, which travels at the speed ''c'' from the laser to the various positions of the spot. Similarly, a shadow projected onto a distant object can be made to move faster than ''c'', after a delay in time.<ref> {{cite news |last=Wertheim |first=M |title=The Shadow Goes |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/20/opinion/20wertheim.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=%27the%20shadow%20goes%27&st=cse&oref=slogin |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2009-08-21 |date=2007-06-20 }}</ref> In neither case does any matter, energy, or information travel faster than light.<ref name=Gibbs> {{cite web |last=Gibbs |first=P |year=1997 |title=Is Faster-Than-Light Travel or Communication Possible? |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SpeedOfLight/FTL.html |publisher=[[University of California, Riverside]] |work=Usenet Physics FAQ |accessdate=2008-08-20 |archivedate=2009-11-17 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lLRguF0I }}</ref> The rate of change in the distance between two objects in a frame of reference with respect to which both are moving (their [[Faster-than-light#Closing speeds|closing speed]]) may have a value in excess of ''c''.

An example involves the [[quantum state]]s of two particles that can be [[quantum entanglement|entangled]]. Until either of the particles is observed, they exist in a [[quantum superposition|superposition]] of two quantum states. If the particles are separated and one particle's quantum state is observed, the other particle's quantum state is determined instantaneously (i.e., faster than light could travel from one particle to the other).
