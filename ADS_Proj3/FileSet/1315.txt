most purposes, simplifying analysis (see the [[common base]] article for an example). [[Negative feedback]] is often applied deliberately to tailor amplifier behavior. Some feedback, which may be positive or negative, is unavoidable and often undesirable, introduced, for example, by [[parasitic element (electrical networks)|parasitic elements]] such as the inherent capacitance between input and output of a device such as a transistor and capacitative coupling due to external wiring. Excessive frequency-dependent positive feedback may cause what is supposed to be an amplifier to become an [[oscillator]]. Linear unilateral and bilateral amplifiers can be represented as [[two-port network]]s. === Inverting or non-inverting === Another way to classify amps is the phase relationship of the input signal to the output signal. An '''inverting''' amplifier produces an output 180 degrees out of phase with the input signal (that is, a polarity inversion or mirror image of the input as seen on an [[oscilloscope]]). A '''non-inverting''' amplifier maintains the phase of the input signal waveforms. An '''[[emitter follower]]''' is a type of non-inverting amplifier, indicating that the signal at the emitter of a transistor is following (that is, matching with unity gain but perhaps an offset) the input signal. This description can apply to a single stage of an amplifier, or to a complete amplifier system. === Function === Other amplifiers may be classified by their function or output characteristics. These functional descriptions usually apply to complete amplifier systems or sub-systems and rarely to individual stages. *A '''servo amplifier''' indicates an integrated [[feedback loop]] to actively control the output at some desired level. A '''DC [[Servomechanism|servo]]''' indicates use at frequencies down to DC levels, where the rapid fluctuations of an audio or RF signal do not occur. These are often used in mechanical actuators, or devices such as [[DC motor]]s that must maintain a constant speed or [[torque]]. An '''AC servo''' amp can do this for some ac motors. *A '''linear''' amplifier responds to different frequency components independently, and does not generate [[harmonic distortion]] or [[Intermodulation]] distortion (well, hardly any). A '''nonlinear''' amplifier does generate distortion (e.g. the output is a current to a lamp that must be either fully on or off, but the input is continuously variable; or the amplifier is used in an [[analog computer]] where a special transfer function, such as logarithmic, is desired; or a following [[tuned circuit]] will remove the harmonics generated by a non-linear RF amplifier). *A '''wideband''' amplifier has a precise amplification factor over a wide range of frequencies, and is often used to boost signals for relay in communications systems. A '''narrowband''' amp is made to amplify only a specific narrow range of frequencies, to the exclusion of other frequencies. *An '''RF''' amplifier refers to an amplifier designed for use in the [[radio frequency]] range of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], and is often used to increase the sensitivity of a [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]] or the output power of a [[transmitter]]. *An '''[[audio amplifier]]''' is designed for use in [[sound reproduction|reproducing audio]] frequencies. This category subdivides into small signal amplification, and power amps which are optimised for driving [[loudspeaker|speaker]]s, sometimes with multiple amps grouped together as separate or bridgeable channels to accommodate different audio reproduction requirements. Frequently used terms within audio amplifiers include: ** [[preamplifier]] (preamp), that may include [[phono]] or [[phonograph|gramophone]] preamp with [[equalization]] for [[RIAA]] [[LP album|LP]] recordings, or [[tape head]] preamps with [[CCIR]] equalisation filters; they may include [[filter]]s or [[tone control]] circuitry. ** [[power amplifier]] (normally assumed to drive [[loudspeakers]]), [[headphone]] amplifiers, and [[Public_address#Amplifiers|public address amplifiers]]. ** [[stereo]] amplifiers imply two channels of output (left and right), although the term simply means "solid" sound (referring to three-dimensional) - so [[quadraphonic]] stereo was used for amplifiers with 4 channels; 5.1 and 7.1 systems refer to [[Home theatre system]]s with 5 or 7 normal spacial channels, plus a subwoofer channel (that is not very directional). *[[Buffer amplifiers]], that may include [[emitter follower]]s, provide a high [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] input for a device (perhaps another amplifier, or perhaps an energy-hungry load such as lights) that would otherwise draw too much current from the source. [[Line driver]]s are a type of buffer intended to feed long or interference-prone interconnect cables, possibly with [[differential]] outputs if driving [[twisted pair]]s of cables. *A special type of amplifier is widely used in instruments and for signal processing, among many other varied uses. These are known as '''[[operational amplifiers]]''' or '''op-amps'''. This is because this type of amplifier is used in circuits that perform mathematical algorithmic functions, or "operations" on input signals to obtain specific types of output signals. A typical modern op-amp has differential inputs (one "inverting", one "non-inverting") and one output. An idealised op-amp has the following characteristics: **Infinite input impedance (so as to not load circuitry it is sampling as a control input) **Zero output impedance **Infinite gain **Zero propagation delay :The performance of an op-amp with these characteristics would be entirely defined by the (usually passive) components forming a negative feedback loop around it, that is, ''the amplifier itself has no effect on the output''. :Today, op-amps are usually provided as integrated circuits, rather than constructed from discrete components. All real-world op-amps fall short of the idealised specification above â€“ but some modern components have remarkable performance and come close in some respects. === Interstage coupling method === {{See also|multistage amplifiers}} Amplifiers are sometimes classified by the coupling method of the signal at the input, output, or between stages. Different types of these include: ;Resistive-capacitive (RC) coupled amplifier, using a network of resistors and capacitors :By design these amplifiers cannot amplify DC signals as the capacitors block the DC component of the input signal. RC-coupled amplifiers were used very often in circuits with vacuum tubes or discrete transistors. In the days of the integrated circuit a few more transistors on a chip are much cheaper and smaller than a capacitor. ;Inductive-capacitive (LC) coupled amplifier, using a network of inductors and capacitors :This kind of amplifier is most often used in selective radio-frequency circuits. ;[[Transformer]] coupled amplifier, using a transformer to match
