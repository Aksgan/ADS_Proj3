Women@SCS has initiated programs, such as the Big/Little Sister program for undergraduates, the invited Speaker Series for graduates, as well as dinners and other social and academic events. Women@SCS also sponsors outreach projects such as "Is there a [[robot]] in your future?" workshop for middle school girls. In general, the committee strives to promote a healthy and supportive community atmosphere. == Gates and Hillman Centers == [[Image:CMU Gates Hillman Complex.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gates and Hillman Centers]] The Gates Center for Computer Science and the Hillman Center for Future-Generation Technologies are home to much of the School of Computer Science. The $98 million complex was opened in 2009.<ref name=hill>[http://www.cmu.edu/news/archive/2008/February/feb20_hillmangift.shtml Henry L.

It also houses 12 classrooms, including a 250-seat auditorium.<ref name=gatesblog /> Additionally, the Gates Center connects to the Purnell Center, which houses the School of Drama, via the [[Randy Pausch]] Memorial Footbridge. The bridge represents Professor Pausch's own devotion to linking computer science and entertainment, as he was a co-founder of Carnegie Mellon's Entertainment Technology Center.<ref name=footbridge>[http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/s_528186.html Professor diagnosed with cancer offers his final words for the CMU community], ''Pittsburgh Tribune-Review''.</ref> Mack Scogin Merril Elam Architects of [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] were the lead architects.<ref name=hill /> The centers were designed to achieve at least a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Silver rating.<ref name=gatesblog>[http://gatescenter.blog.cs.cmu.edu/overview/ SCS Complex Information and Blog » Overview], gatescenter.blog.cs.cmu.edu.</ref> == Traditions == {{Main|Carnegie Mellon University traditions}} * Carnegie Mellon's '''Mobot Races''', now in their 14th year, are hosted by the School of Computer Science during every [[Carnegie_Mellon_University_traditions#Spring_Carnival|Spring Carnival]] celebration. The Mobots (short for [[mobile robot]]s) follow a slalom course painted in the sidewalk outside of Wean Hall. The Mobot Races used to include a MoboJoust competition, but it has not been held since 2002<ref name=mobot2>[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mobot/winners.shtml Winners Gallery], www.cs.cmu.edu/~mobot/.</ref> to avoid damaging the Mobots.<ref name=mobot>[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mobot/ Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science 14th Annual Mobot Races], www.cs.cmu.edu/~mobot/.</ref> * '''SCS Day''' is a yearly celebration of computer science that started in 2003.

The Grand Challenge is a competition for [[driverless car]]s sponsored by [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA). Tartan Racing is led by Carnegie Mellon roboticist [[Red Whittaker|William L. "Red" Whittaker]].<ref name=racing>[http://www.tartanracing.org/team.html Tartan Racing @ Carnegie Mellon], tartanracing.org.</ref> In 2007, Tartan Racing won the [[DARPA Grand Challenge (2007)|DARPA Urban Challenge]], in which 11 autonomous ground vehicles raced over urban roadways. In the challenge, team vehicles were required to obey all [[California]] driving laws, share the road with other drivers and robotic cars, and complete the course in under six hours. Tartan Racing won the $2 million cash prize with Boss, a reworked 2007 [[Chevy
