as is practical to operate. PC-LISP runs well in DOS emulators and on modern Windows versions. Because PC-LISP implements Franz LISP, it is a dynamically scoped predecessor to modern [[Common Lisp]]. This is therefore an historically important implementation. ==Example== [[Image:Pclisp.jpg|thumb|PC-LISP 2.11 (1986) session.]] The session is running the following code which demonstrates [[dynamic scoping]] in Franz LISP. Note that PC-LISP does not implement the <code>let</code> special form that [[Emacs Lisp]] provides for local variables. Instead, all variables are what an [[ALGOL]]-based language would call "global". The first dialect of Lisp to incorporate ALGOL scoping rules (called [[lexical scoping]]) was [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] although the [[Common Lisp]] language also added this feature. <pre> ;; Demonstration of dynamic scoping ;; This is a "global" variable (setq myglobal "this is my global variable") ;; Another global variable (setq yourglobal "this is my global variable") ;; a function which prints the symbols (defun dosomething (mine yours) (princ " * Mine is - ") (princ mine) (princ "\n") (princ " * Yours is - ") (princ yours) (princ "\n")) ;; override the symbols (defun nolocals () (setq mine "I have set mine to a new value") (setq yours "I have set mine to a new value") (dosomething mine yours)) (defun main () ;; define two symbols (setq mine myglobal) (setq yours yourglobal) ;; print them (princ "calling dosomething\n") (dosomething mine yours) (princ "calling nolocals\n") (nolocals) (princ "calling dosomething again\n") (dosomething mine yours)) </pre> ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== * [http://cd.textfiles.com/swinnund/disk2/EXLIS/EDUCATE/EDU_M_Z.LIP List of files] which includes: "PCLISP.ZIP 62745 02-23-86 a near franz lisp (with documentation)" [[Category:Lisp programming language family]] [[Category:Discontinued development tools]]</text> </page> <page> <id>28026</id> <title>PCLinuxOS</title> <text>{{Infobox OS | name = PCLinuxOS | logo = [[Image:PCLinuxOS logo.svg|100px|PCLinuxOS Logo]] | screenshot = [[Image:Pclos20092.jpg|250px]] | caption = PCLinuxOS 2009.2 | developer = Bill Reynolds ("Texstar") | released = October 2003 | latest_release_version = 2010.10 | latest_release_date = {{release date and age|2010|10|28}} | family = [[Unix-like]] | source_model = [[Open source]] | working_state = Current | | kernel_type = [[Monolithic kernel|Monolithic]] | ui = [[KDE Plasma Workspaces|KDE Plasma Desktop]] | license = Various | website = [http://www.pclinuxos.com/ PCLinuxOS] }} '''PCLinuxOS''', often shortened to '''PCLOS''', is a [[GNU/Linux distribution]], with [[KDE Plasma Desktop]] as its default user interface. It is a primarily [[free software]] [[operating system]] for personal computers aimed at ease of use. It is partially considered as a [[rolling release]]. ==History== {{Confusing|date=November 2009}} The precursor to PCLinuxOS was a set of [[RPM Package Manager|RPM packages]] created to improve successive versions of Mandrake Linux (now [[Mandriva Linux]]). These packages were created by Bill Reynolds, a packager better known as ''Texstar''.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | title = DistroWatch.com: Top Ten Distributions - An overview of today's top distributions | url=http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major | accessdate = 2007-07-03 }}</ref> From 2000 to 2003, Texstar maintained his repository of RPM packages in parallel with the [http://www.pclinuxonline.com/ PCLinuxOnline] site. In an interview, Reynolds said he started PCLinuxOS "to provide an outlet for [his] crazy desire to package [[source code]] without having to deal with egos, arrogance and politics."<ref name="Linuxblog">{{cite web|url=http://linux-blog.org/index.php?/archives/91-Experiment-Interview-with-Texstar-of-PCLinuxOS.html|title=Experiment: Interview with Texstar of PCLinuxOS - Yet Another Linux Blog|date=8 June 2005|publisher=linux-blog.org|accessdate=2007-07-03}}</ref> In October 2003, Texstar created a [[Fork (software)|fork]] of Mandrake Linux 9.2. Working closely with [http://livecd.berlios.de/ The Live CD Project], Texstar has since developed that fork independently into a full-fledged distribution. The initial releases were successively numbered as "previews": p5, p7, p8 up to p81a, then p9, p91, p92, and p93. ==Release history== Almost all{{Clarify|date=January 2010}} major releases have been accompanied by new boot-up and login screens, along with some changes in icon sets, and login sounds. {| class="wikitable" |----- ! | Version ! | Date |- | 2010.12 || December 19, 2010 |- | 2010.10 || October 28, 2010 |- | 2010.7 || July 5, 2010 |- | 2010.1 || May 5, 2010 |- | 2010 || April 19, 2010 |- | 2009.2 || June 30, 2009 |- | 2009.1 || March 11, 2009 |- | 2008 "MiniMe" || January 7, 2008 |- | P.94 "2007" || May 21, 2007 |- | P.93a "Big Daddy" || August 21, 2006 |- | P.93a "Junior" || August 9, 2006 |- | P.93a "MiniMe" || August 4, 2006 |- | P.93 "MiniMe" || April 21, 2006 |- | P.92 || November 21, 2005 |- | P.91 || July 7, 2005 |- |Original Release || October 2003 |} ===PCLinuxOS 2007=== With the advent of PCLinuxOS 2007, PCLinuxOS was rebased on Mandriva Linux 2007. This implied a shift to a more modern code, which required a complete reinstall to this version. The new version featured a new look, and built-in 3D effects. A new logo was also designed for the new version, and was incorporated into the boot screen. A new login screen was designed, entitled "Dark". The final/official PCLinuxOS 2007 version was released on 2007-05-21. ===PCLinuxOS 2009=== The last version of the main Live CD, PCLinuxOS 2009.2, was released on June 30, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://distrowatch.com/?newsid=05560|title=Distribution Release: PCLinuxOS 2009.2|date=2009-06-30|accessdate=2009-07-31}}</ref> Improvements include bug fixes, new backgrounds, sounds, start-up screen, and quicker start-up times. It will be the last PCLinuxOS live CD to ship with [[K Desktop Environment 3]], and the last of the PCLinuxOS 2007 backward compatible series. Remasters of PCLinuxOS, featuring the Xfce (Phoenix), LXDE (PCLinuxOS-LXDE), and Gnome (PCLinuxOS-Gnome) desktops were also made available. ===PCLinuxOS 2010=== The 2010 version of the Live CD was released on April 19, 2010<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxcritic.com/pclinuxos-2010-review/|title=Distribution Review: PCLinuxOS 2010}}</ref>. It includes the new KDE SC 4.4.2, a new graphical theme and a new version of the Linux Kernel (Kernel 2.6.32.11). It is also the first PCLinuxOS Live CD to include the ext4 file system support. This version requires a complete reinstall of the operating system. While a version of PCLinuxOS that features the [[GNOME]] desktop environment was introduced in 2008, the 2010 version is the first one to not only offer the [[KDE]] and [[GNOME]] versions, but also versions with [[Xfce]], [[LXDE]], [[Enlightenment (window manager)|Enlightenment]], and [[Openbox]]. Version 2010.1 was released on May 5, 2010. Changes made since last version: the Kernel
