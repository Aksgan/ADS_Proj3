(System Administrators). As a result of this certification, Federal civilian and military personnel will be permitted to take the school’s certified graduate courses under government sponsorship, and the school is authorized to issue certificates to students who complete such courses. Individuals may apply to take one or more certified information security courses as non-degree students. This program is available online or on-campus. * Information System Security * Administration of Information Security ===Master of Science Degree Programs=== The M.S. requires 36 credit hours. It may be completed in 12–18 months. Several of the M.S. programs offer concentrations or graduate certificate options which may require additional courses. Terms are 12 weeks long, and there are four terms each year. They start in September, January, April, and June. The school’s M.S. students may apply for early admission into the Ph.D. program, which provides the opportunity to earn the doctorate in a shorter time. * M.S. in Computer Information Systems (optional concentration in information security) * M.S. in Computer Science * M.S. in Computing Technology in Education (optional concentration in information security) * M.S. in Information Security * M.S. in Information Technology (concentrations in software development, information system security, educational technology, information security management, and information technology management) * M.S. in Management Information Systems (optional concentration in information security) ===Doctoral Degree Programs=== Depending on the program, Ph.D. students may take one of two formats: cluster or institute. Cluster students, while taking courses, attend four cluster sessions per year, held quarterly over an extended weekend (Friday, Saturday, and half-day Sunday) at the university. Cluster terms start in September and March. Institute students, while taking courses, attend week long sessions at the university twice a year at the start of each term. Institute terms start in January and July. All Ph.D. terms are five months long. Clusters and institutes bring together students and faculty members for participation in courses, seminars, and dissertation counseling. Between meetings, students work on assignments and projects, and participate in online activities that facilitate frequent interaction with the faculty and with other students. * Ph.D. in Computer Information Systems (optional concentration in information security) * Ph.D. in Computer Science * Ph.D. in Computing Technology in Education * Ph.D. in Information Systems (optional concentration in information science or information security) ==Student organizations== ===[http://www.scis.nova.edu/Masters/Director/student_organizations/ieee_student_branch/index.html/ NSU IEEE student chapter ]=== IEEE, the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers]], Inc. ("eye-triple-E" ) helps advance global prosperity by promoting the engineering process of creating, developing, integrating, sharing, and applying knowledge about electrical and information technologies and sciences for the benefit of humanity and the profession. The IEEE promotes the engineering process of creating, developing, integrating, sharing, and applying knowledge about electro and information technologies and sciences for the benefit of humanity and the profession. Joining IEEE as a student is one of the best financial decisions you will make. IEEE Student Membership includes all the benefits that a regular, full-paying member enjoys, at a fraction of the cost. Through its technical publishing, conferences, and consensus-based standards activities, the IEEE produces 30 percent of the world's published literature in electrical engineering, computers and control technology, holds annually more than 300 major conferences, and has nearly 900 active standards with 700 under development. ===[http://www.scis.nova.edu/Masters/Director/student_organizations/acm_student_branch/index.html/ NSU ACM student chapter]=== ACM, the [[Association for Computing Machinery]], is an international scientific and educational organization dedicated to advancing the arts, sciences, and applications of information technology. ACM is the world's oldest and largest educational and scientific computing society. Since 1947 ACM has provided a vital forum for the exchange of information, ideas, and discoveries. ACM is a major force in advancing the skills of information technology professionals and students worldwide. Today, its 75,000 members and the public turn to the ACM for the industry's leading Portal to Computing Literature, authoritative publications, and pioneering conferences, providing leadership for the 21st century. ===[http://www.scis.nova.edu/Masters/Director/student_organizations/upe/index.html/ NSU Upsilon Pi Epsilon]=== [[Upsilon Pi Epsilon]] is an honorary society whose membership consists of outstanding graduate students in Computing Sciences and Computer Information Systems. UPE was first organized at [[Texas A&M University]], [[College Station, Texas]], in 1967. The international organization now consists of chapters in various colleges and universities in North America and overseas. The mission of UPE is to recognize academic excellence at both the undergraduate and graduate levels in the Computing and Information Disciplines. UPE is a member of the Association of College Honor Societies (ACHS). UPE is the only existing international honor society in the Computing and Information Disciplines. It has received endorsements from the two largest computer organizations in the world, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the IEEE Computer Society (IEEE-CS). ==[http://infosec.nova.edu/ National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education]== In March 2005, the U.S. [[National Security Agency]] and the [[Department of Homeland Security]] designated Nova Southeastern University a [http://www.nsa.gov/ia/academia/caemap.cfm?MenuID=10.1.1.2/ National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education] for the academic years 2005-2008. Official letters of notification from NSA were sent to NSU’s President [[Ray Ferrero]], Florida’s Governor [[Jeb Bush]], Florida Members of Congress, and appropriate Congressional Committees. NSA’s goal in establishing centers of academic excellence is to reduce vulnerability in our national information infrastructure by promoting higher education in [[information assurance]] and producing more professionals with IA expertise in various disciplines. This designation applies to the entire university, although the degrees under this program are graduate degrees that are primarily issued through the Graduate School of Computer and Information Sciences. <br> Benefits and features of the program are: # Prestige: national recognition for NSU in information assurance/security # NSU will be expected to serve as a regional center of expertise in IA # NSU students will be eligible for scholarships and grants under two programs: <br />DoD Information Assurance Scholarship Program <br />Federal Cyber Service Scholarship for Service Program (SFS) # Eligibility of NSU faculty/staff for grants and contracts from NSA and DoD At the date of NSU’s designation, NSA has established 55 such national centers of excellence in the U.S. The only other university with that distinction in Florida is [[Florida
