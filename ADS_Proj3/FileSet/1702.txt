in Germany, behind only the [[Wind power in the United States|United States]].]] Germany is the world's fifth largest consumer of energy, and two-thirds of its primary energy was imported in 2002. In the same year, Germany was Europe's largest consumer of electricity, totaling 512.9 terawatt-hours. Government policy promotes energy conservation and the development of [[renewable energy]] sources, such as solar, [[wind power|wind]], [[biomass]], hydroelectric, and [[geothermal power|geothermal]] energy. As a result of energy-saving measures, [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] has been improving since the beginning of the 1970s. The government has set the goal of meeting half the country's energy demands from renewable sources by 2050. In 2000, the government and the [[Nuclear power in Germany|German nuclear power industry]] agreed to phase out all [[nuclear power plant]]s by 2021.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4295389.stm Germany split over green energy], BBC. Retrieved 13 April 2007.</ref> Renewable energy still plays a more modest role in energy consumption. In 2006, energy consumption was met by the following sources: oil (36%); coal, including lignite (24%); natural gas (23%); nuclear (13%); hydro and wind power (1%); and other (4%). However, the share of renewable energy in electricity supply has been rapidly increasing, reaching 14% in 2007. The German government has set a new target to increase this share to 27% by 2020. ===Technology=== {{Main|German inventors and discoverers}} [[File:Fächertextur.jpg|thumb|left|[[Liquid crystal]] visualized by a polarizing microscope.
