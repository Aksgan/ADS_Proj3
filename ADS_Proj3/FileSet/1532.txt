Note the large spike in total compute power after March 22, when the [[PlayStation 3]] client was released.]] Shortly after breaking the 200,000 active CPU count on September 20, 2005, the Folding@home project celebrated its fifth anniversary on October 1, 2005. Interest and participation in the project has grown steadily since its launch. The number of active devices participating in the project increased substantially after receiving much publicity during the launch of their high performance clients for both [[ATi]] [[Video Card|graphics cards]] and the PlayStation 3, and again following the launch of the high performance client for [[Nvidia|nVidia]] graphics cards. As of April 9, 2009 the peak speed of the project overall has reached over 5.0 native [[petaflop|PFLOPS]] (8.1 x86 PFLOPS<ref name="Folding@home FLOP FAQ">[http://folding.stanford.edu/English/FAQ-flops Folding@home FLOP FAQ]</ref>) from around 400,000 active machines, and the project has received computational results from over 4.51 million devices since it first started.<ref name="osstats"/> ===Google & Folding@home=== There used to be cooperation between Folding@home and [[Google]] Labs in the form of [[Google Compute|Google Toolbar]]. Google Compute supported Folding@home during its early stage â€” when Folding@home had about 10,000 active CPUs. At that time, a boost of 20,000 machines was very significant. Today the project has a large number of active CPUs and the number of new clients joining Google Compute was very low (most people opted for the Folding@home client instead), it is available [http://toolbar.google.com/dc/aboutdc.html here] (must access in IE with old version of Google Toolbar). The Google Compute clients also had certain limits: they could only run the TINKER core and had limited naming and team options. Folding@home is no longer supported on Google Toolbar, and even the old Google Toolbar client will not work.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://forum.folding-community.org/fpost151025.html | title = What is the state of Google Compute client? | accessdate = 2006-11-12 | format = Blog | work = Folding@home support forum | publisher = Stanford University }}</ref> ===Genome@home=== Folding@home absorbed the [[Genome@home]] project on March 8, 2004. The work which was started by the Genome@home project has since been completed using the Folding@home network (the work units without deadlines), and no new work is being distributed by this project. All donators were encouraged to download the Folding@home client (the F@h 4.xx client had a Genome@home option), and once the Genome@home work was complete these clients were asked to donate their processing power to the Folding@home project instead. ===PetaFLOPS milestones=== {| align="right" border="1" class="wikitable" style="margin-left:5px" |- !
