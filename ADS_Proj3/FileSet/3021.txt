a home entertainment release. Some titles therefore have different FSK certificates for the cinematic release and for the DVD release. Usually, the [[Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft|FSK]] applies stricter rules to the home releases and therefore sometimes the distributors have to release a tamed down version. After 10 years, films may be resubmitted to the FSK for re-rating. Older films which have gained a ''FSK 18'' certificate during the '50s or '60s often gain a much lower certificate now, due to a more liberal approach the FSK now takes in issuing ratings. However, due to the cost involved in resubmitting a film, it is common practice to keep the old certificate for the cinematic release and only submit bonus materials or extended scenes for classification. This leads to the seemingly paradoxical result of extended, and more violent versions of previously rated films gaining a lower certificate than the original version. Further to the above restrictions, it is also illegal to supply a film with an ''FSK 18'', ''Keine Jugendfreigabe'' or ''SPIO/JK'' certificate, including those not on the index, without definitive means to supply proof of age. This severely limits distribution of films with these certificates, and thus it is extremely common for distributors to supply a cut version with a lower certificate so that the film can be distributed by mail order or Internet. Almost all major online distributors have declined to distribute ''FSK 18'' or ''Keine Jugendfreigabe'' films due to the legal difficulties in the past. Shopping centers, malls have been selling films with this certificate since 2002. Amazon Germany started selling titles with this certification in November 2006. Many smaller online retailers provide an FSK 18 section which may be accessed only by sending a scanned copy of the buyer's identification card or providing the ID card's number (which includes the date of birth encrypted). The legality of this practice, however, is as yet untested. In September 2006, Amazon.de became the first major retailer to provide FSK 18 rated films, by making use of an ID checking service offered by the [[Deutsche Post|German postal service]]. Before 2003, state prosecutors were able to confiscate FSK18 titles to put them on the index or ban them completely. Thus, many sellers were put off from selling these titles in the first place and instead sold the cut versions that usually carried the FSK16-tag. Under the new law of 2003, however, movies with an FSK18 certificate can no longer be confiscated or put on the index. The FSK may refuse to give an FSK18-tag because it deems the material too violent and/or sexually charged to even grant it an FSK-18 certificate. The distributor must then resubmit a cut version or refer it to the ''Juristenkommission'' for a certificate attesting that the film does not violate applicable law. ==Greece== Any movies that will be shown in Greek movie theatres, whether local or foreign, must be classified. There are four ratings for movies shown in Greece and they are: * '''K''' - Suitable film for everyone, including children. The film does not contain violence, drug abuse, or sexual content. * '''K-13''' - Suitable film for children over the age of 13. The film may contain mild violence and adult themes. * '''K-17''' - Suitable film for adults over the age of 17. The film may contain violence, drug abuse, and mild pornographic scenes. An [[Identity document|ID card]] certifying the age is required in all Greek cinemas and DVD rental shops in order to get a cinema ticket or rent a DVD of a "K-17" rated film. This category is legally restricted. * '''E''' - Exempt ==Hong Kong== {{Main|Hong Kong motion picture rating system}} An official government agency issues ratings for any movie that will be shown in Hong Kong movie theatres, instead of a private institution. They are: *'''I''' — suitable for all ages (circle sign) *'''IIA''' — some content is unsuitable for children; parental guidance suggested (square sign) *'''IIB''' — some content is unsuitable for children and young persons; parental guidance suggested (square sign) *'''III''' — for aged 18 and above only (triangle sign) Of the four levels, Levels I, IIA, and IIB are unrestricted. Only Level III is a restricted category. Ticket sellers in movie theatres have a legal right to check the identity of a person who wishes to watch a Level III film to ensure legal compliance. == Hungary == Hungarian ratings are decided by the Rating Committee of the National Office of Film<ref>http://www.ortt.hu/belso_oldal.php?belso_id=55</ref>: *'''KN''' - suitable for all (category I.) *'''12''' - parental guidance suggested for children under 12. (category II.) *'''16''' - not suitable for children under 16. (category III.) *'''18''' - not suitable for people under 18. (category IV.) *'''X''' - only for adults (category V.) Before 2004, there was '''14''' instead of '''12''', and there wasn't any fifth category. ==Iceland== [[Image:Leyfdollum.jpg|75px|thumb|left|SmáÍs movie rating labele]] '''Kvikmyndaeftirlit Ríkisins''' was started in 1932 and ran until 1997. That year the name changed into '''Kvikmyndaskoðun''' and ran until 2006. Since 1997 the board does not edit movies. The old rating system from Kvikmyndaeftirlit Ríkisins and Kvikmyndaskoðun is still valid and is as follows: * '''L''': Suitable for all * '''LH''': Not suitable for very young viewers (video only) replaced by '''7''' * '''10''': Passed only for children 10 and older (theatrical only) replaced by '''7''' * '''12''': Passed only for children 12 and older * '''14''': Passed only for children 14 and older (theatrical only) * '''16''': Passed only for children 16 and older * '''AB''': Banned (1932–1997) replaced by '''18''' From July 1, 2006 Kvikmyndaskoðun was closed and Smáís has taken over the responsibility of rating systems in Iceland. Simultaneously, a new rating system started and is as following: * '''L''': Suitable for all * '''7''': Passed only for 7 and older * '''12''': Passed only for 12 and older * '''14''': Passed only for 14 and older * '''16''': Passed only for 16 and older * '''18''': Passed only for 18 and older Certain films that have been rated
