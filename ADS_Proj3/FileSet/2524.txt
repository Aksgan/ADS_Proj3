points will serve to ensure that all EC-Council certified professionals maintain and further their knowledge. Professionals will need to meet the requirements of the ECE to avoid revocation of certification. Members holding the L|PT designation will be required to re-certify under this program every three years for a minimum of 120 credits (20 credits per year).

The first chapters deal with the common questions of the distinctions between [[life|living]] and inanimate objects. Asimov then explains in a step by step manner about the physical world first through slow, but interesting chapters. He writes about the effect and major role of the [[evolution]] and advance of [[man]] by [[fire]] and heat, he tells about [[thermodynamics]] (and its laws), he recollects the thoughts of previous scientists, and their painstaking works, and finally, the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] and [[radiation]], which has revolutionised physics and [[technology]]. An explanation of [[electricity]] and basic [[chemistry]] laws and features are also included. The physical section ends here, and continues into biology. He now continues on with special chemistry, and leaves behind physics. From this, the book leads into the functions of [[enzyme]]s, [[amino acid]]s, [[biological cell|cells]], the body as a whole, and the process of the cells and [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]s to work together to become one. ==Publication== *''Life and Energy'' (1962) ISBN 0380009420 [[Category:1962 books]] [[Category:Books by Isaac Asimov]] [[Category:Science books]] {{science-book-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>21620</id> <title>Life cycle of a relational database</title> <text>{{multiple issues|unreferenced=December 2009|rewrite=May 2009|copyedit=September 2010}} The '''life cycle of a relational database''' is the cycle of development and changes that a [[relational database]] goes through during the course of its life. The cycle typically consists of several stages. There is a possibility that the [[database]] designer/developer can go back to any of the previous stages. This represents an admission that a full understanding of a problem and its solution is likely to evolve as the various stages of design and implementation proceed. The typical eleven stages involved in the life cycle of a relational database are as follows: ==Process== # The designer must try to obtain as complete as possible an understanding of the real world problem that is going to be helped by the introduction of a database. This understanding of the nature of the problem and the constraints and outline feasible solutions is often performed using some systems analysis methodology. # The entity relationship diagram is drawn, and this diagram in its modified form serves as an essential part of the logical schema. Attributes of the entity types so produced are then added. [[Primary key|Primary]] and [[Foreign key|foreign]] keys are specified. # [[Database normalization|Normalization]] is used to check the [[entity-relationship model]]. Some splitting and even recombination of entity types may result from normalization and the entity relationship model will have to be updated accordingly. The entity relationship model and the [[Table (database)|table]] definitions resulting from normalization should be consistent. # Set of Table(s) definition for the required schema is finalized. # The database tables are created. Primary, Foreign keys, database constraints and [[database integrity]] rules are specified at this stage. # At this stage, the file organization is performed. File organization is the way the database relations are to be stored on the storage medium. The file organization is decided on the basis of maximum speed of access, the type of access required and storage space considerations. There are two factors to consider; firstly how the records are to be physically mapped onto the storage medium, and secondly which indexes are to be used and if so, which fields (attributes, columns) are to be indexed. Indexes are designed to increase the speed of access to required records. Views can also be defined at this stage. Views are used to limit access to parts of database only, when used in conjunction with access privileges. Views also make programming simpler. # The designer will be able to design the required [[Query|queries]] at this stage. The designer should have a good idea of the main types of query and [[report]]s the database will have to accommodate. # At this stage, application screens are designed. The application screens are used to capture the input [[information]] that will be kept in the database. Screen design is partially determined by the data items that must be input and output by particular applications and partially in [[human-computer interface]] terms. When designing screens, special consideration is given to the suggestions given by the application [[end user]]s. There are published standards which can be exactly followed for screens design or organization can develop their own screen design standards as per their requirements. # Report design is another area where input from users is paramount. They will specify
