The authors mistakenly portray [[Frank J. Tipler|Frank Tipler's]] [[Final anthropic principle]] and this "quantum immortality" as significant aspects of controversy surrounding [[Hugh Everett]]'s work. Keith Lynch recalls that Everett took great delight in paradoxes such as the [[unexpected hanging paradox|unexpected hanging]]. Everett didn't mention quantum suicide or quantum immortality in writing, but his work was intended as a solution to the paradoxes of quantum mechanics. Lynch said "Everett firmly believed that his many-worlds theory guaranteed him immortality: His consciousness, he argued, is bound at each branching to follow whatever path does not lead to death",<ref>See Eugene Shikhovtsev's Biography of Everett: [http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/everett/everett.html#e23 Keith Lynch remembers 1979–1980]</ref> Tegmark explains, however, that life and death situations don't normally hinge upon a sequence of binary quantum events like those in the thought experiment.<ref name="mit_edu"/> ==The quantum suicide thought experiment== Unlike the [[Schrödinger's cat]] thought experiment which used poison gas and a radioactive decay trigger, this version involves a lethal weapon and a device that measures the [[spin (physics)|spin value]] of photons. Every 10 seconds, the spin value of a fresh photon is measured. Conditioned upon that quantum bit, the weapon is either deployed, killing the experimenter, or it makes an audible "click" and the experimenter survives. The theories are distinctive from the point of view of the experimenter only; their predictions are otherwise identical. The probability of surviving the first iteration of the experiment is 50%, under both interpretations, as given by the squared norm of the wavefunction. At the start of the second iteration, if the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] is true, the wavefunction has already collapsed, so if the experimenter is already dead, there's a 0% chance of survival. However, if the [[many-worlds interpretation]] is true, a superposition of the live experimenter ''necessarily'' exists, regardless of how many iterations or how improbable the outcome. Barring [[life after death]], it's not possible for the experimenter to experience having been killed, thus the only possible experience is one of having survived every iteration. ==Max Tegmark's work== In response to questions about "subjective immortality," [[Max Tegmark]] made some brief comments: He acknowledged the argument that "everyone will be immortal" should follow if a survivor outcome is possible for all life-threatening events. The flaw in that argument, he suggests, is that dying is rarely a binary event; it is a progressive process. The quantum suicide thought experiment attempts to isolate all possible outcomes for the
