can also be problem, as users can add links to sites hosting malicious code. For example, a German Wikipedia article about the [[Blaster Worm]] was edited to include a hyperlink to a website that would infect the user's computer.<ref name=Legal/> A countermeasure is the use of software that prevents users from saving an edit that contains a link to a site listed on a [[blacklist]] of malware sites.<ref>[[meta:Spam blacklist/About|Meta.wikimeda.org]]</ref> Wiki software must also block JavaScript or other kinds of scripting that the attacker may attempt to insert directly into the page during editing sessions. [[Edit war]]s can also occur as users repetitively revert a page to the version they favor. Some wiki software allows an administrator to stop such edit wars by locking a page from further editing until a decision has been made on what version of the page would be most appropriate.<ref name=Legal/> Some wikis are in a better position than others to control behavior due to governance structures existing outside the wiki. For instance, a college teacher can create incentives for students to behave themselves on a class wiki he administers, by limiting editing to logged-in users and pointing out that all contributions can be traced back to the contributors. Bad behavior can then be dealt with in accordance with university policies.<ref name=Augar/> ==Wiki communities== Many wiki [[communities]] are private, particularly within [[Company|enterprises]]. They are often used as [[internal documentation]] for in-house systems and applications. Some companies use wikis to allow customers to help produce software documentation.<ref>{{citation|title=Wikis for Collaborative Software Documentation|author=C Müller, L Birn|url=http://i-know.tugraz.at/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/47_wikis-for-collaborative-software-documentation.pdf|publisher=Proceedings of I-KNOW ’06|date=September 6–8, 2006}}</ref> A study of corporate wiki users found that they could be divided into "synthesizers" and "adders" of content. Synthesizers' frequency of contribution was affected more by their impact on other wiki users, while adders' contribution frequency was affected more by being able to accomplish their immediate work.<ref>{{citation|title=Corporate wiki users: results of a survey|author=A Majchrzak, C Wagner, D Yates|publisher=Symposium on Wikis|year=2006|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1149472}}</ref> In 2005, the Gartner Group, noting the increasing popularity of wikis, estimated that they would become mainstream collaboration tools in at least 50% of companies by 2009.<ref>{{citation|unused_data=DUPLICATE DATA: date=23 November 2006|title=Email is so five minutes ago|date=November 28, 2005|publisher=Business Week Online}}</ref> Wikis have also been used in the academic community for sharing and dissemination of information across institutional and international boundaries.<ref>{{citation|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1142215.1142259|title=New Interfaces For Musical Expression|isbn=2-84426-314-3|author=MM Wanderley, D Birnbaum, J Malloch|year=2006|publisher=IRCAM — Centre Pompidou}}</ref> In those settings, they have been found useful for collaboration on [[grant writing]], [[strategic planning]], departmental documentation, and committee work.<ref>{{citation|title=Putting Wikis to Work in Libraries|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a901841555&db=all|author=Nancy T.

Examples include the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s [[Intellipedia]], designed to share and collect [[intelligence]], [[dKospedia]], which was used by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] to assist with review of documents pertaining to internment of detainees in [[Guantánamo Bay]]; and the wiki of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]], used to post court rules and allow practitioners to comment and ask questions. The [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] uses a wiki to allow the public to collaborate on finding [[prior art]] relevant to examination of pending patent applications. [[Queens]], [[New York]] has used a wiki to allow citizens to collaborate on the design and planning of a local park. [[Cornell Law School]] founded a wiki-based legal dictionary called [[Wex (wiki)|Wex]], whose growth has been hampered by restrictions on who can edit.<ref name=Noveck>{{citation|title=Wikipedia and the Future of Legal Education|author=Noveck, Beth Simone|publisher=Journal of Legal Education|volume=57}}</ref> There also exist WikiNodes which are pages on wikis that describe related wikis. They are usually organized as neighbors and delegates. A ''neighbor'' wiki is simply a wiki that may discuss similar content or may otherwise be of interest. A ''delegate'' wiki is a wiki that agrees to have certain content delegated to that wiki. One way of finding a wiki on a specific subject is to follow the wiki-node network from wiki to wiki; another is to take a Wiki "bus tour", for example: {{srlink|Wikipedia:TourBusStop|Wikipedia's Tour Bus Stop}}. [[Domain Name System|Domain names]] containing "wiki" are growing in popularity to support specific niches. The English Wikipedia has the largest user base among wikis on the [[World Wide Web]]<ref>{{Citation|url=http://s23.org/wikistats/largest_html.php?sort=users_desc&th=8000&lines=500|title=WikiStats by S23|accessdate=2007-04-07|publisher=S23Wiki|date=2008-04-03}}</ref> and ranks in the top 10 among all Web sites in terms of traffic.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.alexa.com/site/ds/top_sites?ts_mode=global&lang=none|title=Alexa Web Search – Top 500|accessdate=2008-04-15|publisher=[[Alexa Internet]]}}</ref> Other large wikis include the WikiWikiWeb, [[Memory Alpha]], [[Wikitravel]], World66 and [[Susning.nu]], a Swedish-language knowledge base. Medical and health-related wiki examples include [[Ganfyd]], an online collaborative medical reference that is edited by medical professionals and invited non-medical experts.<ref name=BMC>{{citation|title=Wikis, blogs and podcasts: a new generation of Web-based tools for virtual collaborative clinical practice and education|doi=10.1186/1472-6920-6-41|pmc=1564136|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6920/6/41/|journal=BMC medical education|volume=6|pmid=16911779|page=41|publisher=BMC Medical Education|year=2006|author=MNK Boulos, I Maramba, S Wheeler}}</ref> The four basic types of users who participate in wikis are reader, author, wiki administrator and web administrator. The web administrator is responsible for installation and maintenance of the wiki engine and the container web server. The wiki administrator maintains wiki content and is provided additional functions pertaining to pages (e.g. page protection and deletion), and can adjust users' access rights by, for instance, blocking them from editing.<ref>{{citation|title=Analysis of the use of Wiki-based collaborations in enhancing student learning|author=Cubric, Marija|publisher=University of Hertfordshire|year=2007|url=https://uhra.herts.ac.uk/dspace/handle/2299/3672}}</ref> A study of several hundred wikis showed that a relatively high number of administrators for a given content size is likely to reduce growth; that access controls restricting editing to registered users tends to reduce growth; that a lack of such access controls tends to fuel new user registration; and that higher administration ratios (i.e. admins/user) have no significant effect on content or population growth.<ref>{{citation|title=Measuring wiki viability.
