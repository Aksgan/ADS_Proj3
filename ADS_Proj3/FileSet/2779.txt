have to interface with many enterprise [[business software]] systems ([[Product Lifecycle Management|PLM]], [[Enterprise Asset Management|EAM]], [[Enterprise Resource Planning|ERP]], [[Supply Chain Management|SCM]], [[Customer Relationship Management|CRM]]). One of the functions of such software is the configuration of [[bill of materials|bills of materials]] or BOMs, taking the component parts list from engineering (eBOM) and manufacturing (mBOM) and updating it from “as delivered” through “as maintained” to “as used”. Another function is project planning [[logistics]], for example identifying the [[Critical path method|critical path]] on the list of tasks to be carried out (inspection, diagnosis, locate/order parts and service) to calculate turnaround times (TAT). Other tasks that software can perform: *Planning operations, *Managing execution of events, *Management of assets (parts, tools and equipment inventories), *Knowledge-base data on: **Maintenance service history, **Serial numbered parts, **Reliability data: [[Mean time between failures|MTBF]], MTTB (mean time to breakdown), MTBR (mean time between removals), **Maintenance and repair documentation and best practices, **Warranty/guarantee documents. Many of these tasks are addressed in [[Computerized Maintenance Management System]]s (CMMS). Data standards have been developed around these activities, most notably [[EAMXML]] and [[MIMOSA]]. ==MRO goods== MRO goods are typically defined as any goods used in the creation of a product but not in the final product itself. Examples include: * the machinery used to make a product * [[spare part]]s for the machinery that creates the product, and * items used to maintain the facility in which the product is made. ==See also== {{Commons category|Maintenance}} {{Wiktionary|repair|revamping}} *[[Auto maintenance]] *[[Logistics center]] *[[Product Lifecycle Management]] *[[Reliability centered maintenance]] *[[Reliability engineering]] *[[Scheduled maintenance]] *[[Unscheduled maintenance]] *[[User reengineering]] ==References== {{Reflist}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Maintenance, Repair And Operations}} [[Category:Reliability engineering]] [[Category:Product lifecycle management]] [[Category:Mechanical engineering]] [[Category:Maintenance]] [[ar:صيانة]] [[cs:Údržba]] [[de:Instandhaltung]] [[es:Mantenimiento]] [[fa:عملیات تعمیر و نگهداری]] [[fr:Maintenance]] [[hi:रखरखाव, मरम्मत, और संचालन]] [[hr:Održavanje]] [[it:Manutenzione]] [[pl:Remont]] [[ru:Ремонт зданий и сооружений]] [[sv:Reparation]] [[th:การบำรุงรักษา]] [[uk:Ремонт]]</text> </page> <page> <id>23315</id> <title>Maintenance testing</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}} '''Maintenance testing''' is that testing which is performed to either identify equipment problems, diagnose equipment problems or to confirm that repair measures have been effective. It can be performed at either the system level (e.g., the [[HVAC]] system), the equipment level (e.g., the blower in a HVAC line), or the component level (e.g., a control chip in the control box for the blower in the HVAC line). ==Technical basis for testing== Maintenance testing uses system performance requirements as the basis for identifying the appropriate ==In-service inspection and testing== One level of maintenance testing is the [[Inspection|in-service inspection]] or inspection, which typically is a test or series of tests performed on a frequency established by the manufacturer based on prior experience with the system/equipment/component or upon engineering analysis of the probable failure rate for the equipment. Typical examples of inspections and tests include: * Periodic [[vehicle inspection]]s mandated by regulatory authorities for features important to [[environmental protection]] (e.g., exhaust emissions) or for [[safety]] (e.g., brake and signal lights). *Periodic inspections of [[nuclear power plant]] equipment important to the safe operation of the facility. Such inspections include a range of tests such as **Leak-rate tests for containment structures (the reactor boundary, the containment vessel, etc.). **Calibration tests to assure shutdown systems will activate on over-power or over-temperature conditions. * The medical [[physical examination]] or clinical examination can be considered diagnostic testing of in-service inspection for the human body *Performance tests such as [[turbine shaft]] vibration tests to identify wear and plan maintenance are a form of diagnostic testing. ==Evaluation and trending of test results== A good testing program will maintain a record of test results and maintenance actions taken. These data will be evaluated for trends and serve as the basis for decisions on appropriate testing frequency, need to replace or upgrade equipment and performance improvement opportunities. ==Types of maintenance for which testing can be used== Maintenance falls into the following four categories: * [[Preventive maintenance]] &mdash; Changes to the existing system so as to reduce the risk of failure while operating. * [[Corrective maintenance]] &mdash; Correcting problems that arise while using the system. * [[Perfective maintenance]] &mdash; Enhancements (modifications) to improve the safety, reliability, efficiency or cost-effectiveness of operation. * [[Adaptive maintenance]] &mdash; Adaptations to address requirements that crop up due to changes in the environment or new regulations. ==See also== *[[User Reengineering (products)]] *[[auto mechanic]] *[[engine repair]] *[[Preventive maintenance]] *[[reliability engineering]] *[[Product Lifecycle Management]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Maintenance Testing}} [[Category:Maintenance]]</text> </page> <page> <id>23316</id> <title>Maintenance window</title> <text>{{Unreferenced stub|auto=yes|date=December 2009}} In [[Information Technology]] and [[Desktop Management]], a '''maintenance window''' is a period of time designated in advance by the technical staff, during which [[preventive maintenance]] that could cause disruption of service may be performed. == High availability services == For a [[high-availability]] service, such as an [[Internet hosting service]] or [[Internet service provider]], the purpose of stating a time period in advance is to allow clients of the service to prepare for possible disruption or prepare for any major changes to the functioning of the service. This type of disclosure is typically guaranteed as part of a [[service level agreement]]. High-availability maintenance windows are often planned for a time where activity is at its lowest so as to cause minimal disruption to customers, though which also require unusual work schedules for the employees. An ISP for example may schedule a maintenance window for Sunday from 1 AM to 5 AM. == Managed business computers == In schools and businesses with more than approximately 50-200 desktop computers, the [[Information Technology]] staff may use management software to automatically install software updates during off-hours when the school or business is closed or at low activity. Such scheduled updates can include [[Windows Update]]s, antivirus definition updates, software version upgrades for [[Sun Java]], [[Adobe Reader]], [[Adobe Flash]], [[Apple QuickTime]], and so forth. By performing these updates in the middle of the night, the computers are not slowed down by trying to do these updates randomly in the middle of the day when employees are trying to do their job. Where disk protection software such as [[Faronics]] [[Deep Freeze (software)|Deep Freeze]] is used, protective services such as a scheduled system scan at every reboot can be turned off,
