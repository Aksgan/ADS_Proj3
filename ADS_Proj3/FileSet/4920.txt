This allows users to not only enable their consumer electronics but their [[home automation|home automated devices]] as well<ref>[http://www.z-wave.com/modules/AboutZ-Wave/ Z-wave]</ref>. ==Z-wave== '''Z-wave''' is a low power RF wireless solution to home electronics that uses mesh networking technology<ref>[http://www.zen-sys.com/modules/Zensys/ Zensys]</ref>. It is a technology that allows users to send signals at a sub-gigahertz level that avoids any interference from normal obstructions such as a router<ref>[http://www.z-wave.com/modules/AboutZ-Wave/ Z-wave]</ref>. The normal maximum range is 300 ft. for a single device however depending on the number of Z-wave enabled devices the range is endless since this technology works by relaying the commands through any of the Z-wave enabled devices (ie light switches, remotes, thermostats, etc.) until it reaches its destination<ref>[http://www.z-wave.com/modules/AboutZ-Wave/ Z-wave]</ref>. Users also can check the status of the Z-wave enabled device, and receive confirmation that the device has received the user's commands<ref>[http://www.zwaveworld.com/zwavedemo.php Z-wave World]</ref>. ==Universal Remote Control== '''Universal Remote Control (URC)''' is a remote control that can be programmed to operate many consumer electronics such as a user's TV, DVD Player, home theater systems, speakers, projectors, cable boxes, DVRs, DSS receivers, etc. Therefore a user can have one remote for all their electronics at home (depending if the URC is 16-in-1, 8-in-1, 2-in-1, etc.) == References == <!--- See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically --> {{Reflist}} == External links == * [http://www.remotec.com.hk/zaspx/product_content.aspx?aboutno=9&subaboutno=9&main=t Remotec Technology Ltd.] <!--- Categories ---> {{DEFAULTSORT:Z-Urc}} [[Category:Home automation]] [[Category:Consumer electronics]] [[Category:Wireless networking]] [[Category:Remote control]] [[Category:Assistive technology]]</text> </page> <page> <id>40957</id> <title>Z-matrix (chemistry)</title> <text>{{dablink|For the [[mathematics|mathematical]] meaning of this term see [[Z-matrix (mathematics)]].}} In [[chemistry]], the '''Z-matrix''' is a way to represent a system built of [[atoms]]. A Z-matrix is also known as an '''internal coordinate representation'''. It provides a description of each atom in a molecule in terms of its [[atomic number]], [[Chemical bond|bond]] length, [[bond angle]], and [[dihedral angle]], the so-called '''internal coordinates''', although it is not always the case that a Z-matrix will give information regarding bonding since the matrix itself is based on a series of vectors describing atomic orientations in space. However, it is convenient to write a Z-matrix in terms of bond lengths, angles, and dihedrals since this will preserve the actual bonding characteristics. The name arises because the Z-matrix assigns the second atom along the Z-axis from the first atom, which is at the origin. Z-matrices can be converted to [[cartesian coordinates]] and back, as the information content is identical. While the transform is conceptually straight forward, algorithms of doing the conversion vary significantly in speed, numerical precision and parallelism<ref> Jerod Parsons, J. Bradley Holmes, J. Maurice Rojas, Jerry Tsai, Charlie E. M. Strauss: [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.83.8235&rep=rep1&type=pdf Practical conversion from torsion space to Cartesian space for in silico protein synthesis]. Journal of Computational Chemistry 26(10): 1063-1068 (2005)</ref>. These matter because macromolecular chains, such as polymers, proteins, and DNA, can have thousands of connected atoms and atoms consecutively distant along the chain that may be close in Cartesian space (and thus small round-off errors can accumulate to large force-field errors.) They are used for creating input geometries for molecular systems in many [[molecular modelling]] and [[computational chemistry]] programs. A skillful choice of internal coordinates can make the interpretation of results straightforward. Also, since Z-matrices can contain molecular connectivity information (but do not always contain this information), quantum chemical calculations such as geometry [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] may be performed faster, because an educated guess is available for an initial [[Hessian matrix|Hessian]] matrix, and more natural internal coordinates are used rather than Cartesian coordinates. The Z-matrix representation is often preferred, because this allows symmetry to be enforced upon the molecule (or parts thereof) by setting certain angles as constant. == Example == The [[methane]] molecule can be described by the following cartesian coordinates (in [[Ångström]]s): C 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 H 0.000000 0.000000 1.089000 H 1.026719 0.000000 -0.363000 H -0.513360 -0.889165 -0.363000 H -0.513360 0.889165 -0.363000 The corresponding Z-matrix, which starts from the carbon atom, could look like this: C H 1 1.089000 H 1 1.089000 2 109.4710 H 1 1.089000 2 109.4710 3 120.0000 H 1 1.089000 2 109.4710 3 -120.0000 ==External links== *[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/110495804/abstract Comparison of algorithms for conversion of internal to cartesian coordinates] *[http://bioshell.chem.uw.edu.pl/api/de/dab/a00319.html#_details Java implementation of the NERF conversion algorithm] *[http://www.shodor.org/chemviz/zmatrices/babel.html Z-Matrix to Cartesian Coordinate Conversion Page] *[http://search.cpan.org/~itub/PerlMol-0.35_00.ppm/lib/Chemistry/InternalCoords/Builder.pm Chemistry::InternalCoords::Builder] &mdash; [[Perl]] module to build a Z-matrix from cartesian coordinates. ==References== <references/> [[Category:Molecular modelling]] [[Category:Computational chemistry]] [[ru:Z-матрица]] [[uk:Z-матриця]]</text> </page> <page> <id>40974</id> <title>ZINC database</title> <text>The '''ZINC database''' is a curated collection of commercially available [[chemical compounds]] prepared especially for [[virtual screening]].
