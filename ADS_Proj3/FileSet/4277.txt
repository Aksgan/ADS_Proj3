When kids are taught to cross text they often overdo it to a point the original text can no longer be read. It is important to know the original minuend and be able to reconstruct the original subtraction assignment. ==Notes== #This is a simplified, informal algorithm. In some cases a different procedure is called for or simpler one can be used. #This is a generalization of a common practice of many people, including early-grade students. For example, when facing a subtraction problem such as '''1001 − 567''', teachers have reported that some third-grade students had solved it by doing '''999 − 567 + 2'''. Indeed, a 20th-century system of mathematics known as [[Bharati Krishna Tirtha's Vedic mathematics]] includes this special case as one of its sixteen sutras (principles). ==Footnotes and references== {{reflist}} [[Category:Arithmetic]] '''SUBTRACTION WITHOUT BORROWING – BY ADDITION METHOD''' '''PROBLEM: TO SUBTRACT A SMALLER NUMBER (Subtrahend) FROM A LARGER NUMBER (Minuend)''' '''RULES:''' 1. Take a large number, for e.g. 5674561 (Minuend) and take another Smaller Number, for e.g. 79562 (Subtrahend), see below: 5674561 – 79562 which if we use a calculator will give us = 5594999 as the answer. 2. Now, to do this by my “Addition” method, we mentally 'generate' a "New Number" and write all digits of the subtrahend, so that the digits written add up to “9” on all corresponding digits of the subtrahend, exactly in the same place without changing the placement of the value of each corresponding digit, i.e., the unit value under Unit value, the Tens under Tens, Hundreds under Hundreds,,,and so on as the case maybe, as mentioned below: 7 9 5 6 2 (subtrahend) + 2 0 4 3 7 (We call this the ‘New Number’) So that all equal to = 9 9 9 9 9 3. Now we take the “New Number” from above and place it exactly under the Large Minuend, like below: 5 ''''6'''' 7 4 5 6 1 (Minuend) 2 0 4 3 ''''7'''' (“New Number” from the above) 4. Now we simply add (+) “1” to the last digit (Units digit) of the "New Number", which is ''''7'''' & subtract (-) “1” from the “next” corresponding digit of the Minuend, which is larger in value in relation to the highest value placement of the “New Number”, which is ''''6'''', so that they now appear as below: 5 ('''6''' – 1 = 5) 7 4 5 6 1 2 0 4 3 ('''7''' +1 = 8) OR, as below: 5 5 7 4 5 6 1 2 0 4 3 8 5. Now by simply “ADDING” the above numbers, we shall always get the correct result, to the original numbers, if Minuend & Subtrahend were subtracted by the conventional method of borrowing, which we learnt in school,,,Don’t believe me, then see it for yourself as below: 5 5 7 4 5 6 1 ADD (+) 2 0 4 3 8 You Get = 5 5 9 4 9 9 9 --- which is the ANSWER Also, where the number of digits are the same on both Minuend & Subtrahend, the (-) "1" of Rule 4 (as mentioned above) on the Minuend will automatically be on the very first digit of the Minuend from left, i.e. the Highest value in terms of placement. See below, as another e.g. : 6. Lets say the Minuend is 76584 and the Subtrahend
