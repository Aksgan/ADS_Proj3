of dropping batter onto a griddle (a ''girdle'' in Northumberland or in [[Scots language|Scots]]). They can be served with jam and cream or just with butter. In [[Scotland]] pancakes are generally served at [[Tea (meal)#United_Kingdom|teatime]]. '''Welsh pancakes''' (known as ''crempog'', ''ffroes'' and other names) vary considerably. Some are very much like American pancakes, others may be made with yeast (called ''crempog furum'') or oatmeal (although this is also true of American pancakes) and some are like Scotch pancakes.<ref>Freeman, Bobby ''First catch your peacock: her classic guide to Welsh food '' Y Lolfa; New edition edition (30 October 2006) ISBN 978-0-86243-315-4 pp.195-196 [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-gwkXuzJOPQC&pg=PA195&dq=Welsh+pancakes&ei=UpmUS47wOYPkzASfzPi2CA&cd=1#v=onepage&q=Welsh%20pancakes&f=false Google Books] </ref><ref>Tibbit, Sara Minwell ''Baking in Wales'' National Museums and Galleries of Wales (December 1991) ISBN 978-0-7200-0346-8 p.13 [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xDWTcNpAgcwC&pg=PA13&dq=Welsh+pancakes&lr=&ei=ApqUS8SqK5H4yATWpsTgCg&cd=15#v=onepage&q=Welsh%20pancakes&f=false Google Books]</ref> '''[[Crumpets]]''' and '''pikelets''' are sometimes considered a variety of pancake. ===North America=== [[File:Banana on pancake.jpg|left|thumb|North Americans sometimes garnish pancakes with fruits like banana.]] [[File:Chocolate chip raspberry pancakes from bennington vermont.JPG|right|thumb|Raspberry chocolate chip pancakes from [[Vermont]].]] [[File:Silver dollar pancakes.JPG|right|thumb|Stacks of "silver dollar" pancakes.]] American or Canadian pancakes (sometimes called '''hotcakes''', '''griddlecakes''', or '''flapjacks''') are pancakes which contain a [[raising agent]] such as [[baking powder]]; proportions of eggs, flour, and milk or [[buttermilk]] create a thick batter. Many recipes remind the reader that the ingredients should be mixed until they are just combined, even if lumps remain, as the lumps will smoothen out during the cooking process.<ref>Example: [http://www.cookingforengineers.com/recipe/47/Basic-Pancakes Cookingforengineerse.com]</ref><ref>Example: [[wikiHow:Make-Pancakes|Wiki page on how to make pancakes]]</ref> Sugar and spices such as [[cinnamon]], vanilla and [[nutmeg]] are sometimes added. The pancakes can be made sweet or savory by adding ingredients such as [[blueberry|blueberries]], strawberries, cheese, bacon, bananas, apples or chocolate chips to the batter. This batter is ladled or poured onto a hot surface, and spreads to form a circle about ¼ or ⅓ inch (1 cm) thick. The raising agent causes bubbles to rise to the uncooked side, before the pancake is flipped. These pancakes, very light in texture, are usually served at breakfast topped with [[maple syrup]], [[butter]], [[peanut butter]], [[jelly]], [[jam]], [[chocolate]], [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[ketchup]], [[fruit]] and/or [[honey]]. Some places also serve pancakes with whipped cream. In the [[Southern United States]], cane syrup and [[molasses]] have also been common toppings. Some pancake recipes call for [[yogurt]] to give the pancakes a semi-thick, relatively moist consistency.

Flapjacks are often served in a stack with syrup and butter, which can be accompanied by bacon. The terms pancake and flapjack are often confused and today in the US are nearly [[synonymous]]. The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] records the word flapjack as being used as early as the beginning of the 17th century, referring to a flat tart or pan-cake.

A '''silver dollar pancake''' refers to a pancake about two to three inches (5 to 7 cm) in diameter, or just a bit bigger than the pre-1979 [[Dollar coin (United States)|silver dollar coins in the United States]], for which they are named. It is usually made by frying a small spoonful of the same batter as any other pancake. One serving is usually five to ten silver dollar pancakes. '''German Pancakes''' or '''[[Dutch baby pancake]]s''' served in American pancake houses are bowl-shaped. They are eaten with lemons and powdered sugar, jam, or caramelized apples, as well as fritters. '''[[Mexico|Mexican]] hotcakes''' are similar to US pancakes. Hotcakes are often made with cornmeal — as well as, or instead of wheat flour. Hotcakes are popular breakfast items at restaurants throughout the country, and are often sold by street vendors in cities and during the local celebrations of towns through the day; the vendors sell a single hotcake topped with different sauces such as [[condensed milk]], fruit jam or a sweet goat milk spread called "[[cajeta]]". '''[[Guatemalan]] pancakes''' are called Panqueques. They are made with the same ingredients as US pancakes. The toppings are usually fruits and honey. They are a very popular breakfast meal in Guatemala. Depending on where you are in the country, the "Panqueque" can be thin
