The perceived attractiveness of their skin pattern contributes to their popularity with both reptile keepers and the leather industry. The pattern is similar in colour, but different in actual pattern to the [[African Rock Python]] (''[[Python sebae]]''), sometimes resulting in confusion of the two species outside of their natural habitats.

Photo by Lori Oberhofer, [[National Park Service]].]] [[Image:NAS Static US SF FLGVWDMZ014485631722126.png|thumb|United States range]] The captive breeding of Burmese Pythons in the Americas has led to some rather serious problems. People who grow tired of their pythons, or whose pythons have grown too large to be kept in their houses, have been known to release their pets into the wild rather than have them re-homed or even humanely euthanized. This has been particularly problematic in [[Florida]], along with possible zoo and household escapees from [[Hurricane Andrew]], where a large number of pythons have made their way to the [[Everglades]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1958657_1958656_1958659,00.html | work=Time | title=Top 10 Invasive Species | date=2010-02-02 | accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref> They have thrived there, begun to reproduce prolifically, and become an [[invasive species]]. Over 1330 (US Natural Park Service website - Dec 31 2009<ref>http://www.nps.gov/ever/naturescience/burmesepython.htm</ref>) have been captured in the Everglades. Since they have been known to eat endangered birds and alligators, these snakes present a new danger to an already fragile ecosystem. In February 2008, USGS scientists published a projected range map for the US, based on average climate data of the snake's home range and [[global warming]] projections, which predicted that these snakes could eventually migrate to and flourish in as much as a third of the continental [[United States]] by the end of the 21st century.<ref name="USGS">[[U.S. Department of the Interior]], [[U.S. Geological Survey]] (2008-02-20).
