inventory levels, which is an on-going process as the business needs shift and react to the widerenvironment. Inventory management involves a retailer seeking to acquire and maintain a proper merchandise assortment while ordering, shipping, handling, and related costs are kept in check. Systems and processes that identify inventory requirements, set targets, provide replenishment techniques and report actual and projected inventory status. Handles all functions related to the tracking and management of material. This would include the monitoring of material moved into and out of stockroom locations and the reconciling of the inventory balances. Also may include [[ABC analysis]], lot tracking, cycle counting support etc. Management of the inventories, with the primary objective of determining/controlling stock levels within the physical distribution function to balance the need for product availability against the need for minimizing stock holding and handling costs. See [[inventory proportionality]]. ==Business inventory== === The reasons for keeping stock === There are three basic reasons for keeping an inventory: #Time - The time lags present in the supply chain, from supplier to user at every stage, requires that you maintain certain amounts of inventory to use in this "lead time." #Uncertainty - Inventories are maintained as buffers to meet uncertainties in demand, supply and movements of goods. #Economies of scale - Ideal condition of "one unit at a time at a place where a user needs it, when he needs it" principle tends to incur lots of costs in terms of logistics. So bulk buying, movement and storing brings in economies of scale, thus inventory. All these stock reasons can apply to any owner or product stage. * '''Buffer stock''' is held in individual workstations against the possibility that the upstream workstation may be a little delayed in long setup or change over time. This stock is then used while that changeover is happening. This stock can be eliminated by tools like [[SMED]]. These classifications apply along the whole [[Supply chain]], not just within a facility or plant. Where these stocks contain the same or similar items, it is often the work practice to hold all these stocks mixed together before or after the sub-process to which they relate. This 'reduces' costs. Because they are mixed up together there is no visual reminder to operators of the adjacent sub-processes or [[line management]] of the stock, which is due to a particular cause and should be a particular individual's responsibility with inevitable consequences. Some plants have centralized stock holding across sub-processes, which makes the situation even more acute. === Special terms used in dealing with inventory === * ''[[Stock Keeping Unit]]'' (SKU) is a unique combination of all the components that are assembled into the purchasable item. Therefore, any change in the packaging or product is a new SKU. This level of detailed specification assists in managing inventory. * ''Stockout'' means running out of the inventory of an SKU.<ref>Financial dictionary, formerly at http://www.specialinvestor.com/terms/1072.html, Special Investor</ref> * "[[New old stock]]" (sometimes abbreviated NOS) is a term used in business to refer to merchandise being offered for sale that was manufactured long ago but that has never been used. Such merchandise may not be produced anymore, and the new old stock may represent the only market source of a particular item at the present time. ===Typology=== #Buffer/safety stock #Cycle stock (Used in batch processes, it is the available inventory, excluding buffer stock) #De-coupling (Buffer stock that is held by both the supplier and the user) #Anticipation stock (Building up extra stock for periods of increased demand - e.g. ice cream for summer) #Pipeline stock (Goods still in transit or in the process of distribution - have left the factory but not arrived at the customer yet) ===Inventory examples=== While [[accountant]]s often discuss inventory in terms of goods for sale, organizations - [[manufacturer]]s, [[service provider|service-provider]]s and [[not-for-profit]]s - also have inventories (fixtures, furniture, supplies, ...) that they do not intend to sell. Manufacturers', [[distribution (business)|distributor]]s', and wholesalers' inventory tends to cluster in [[warehouse]]s. [[Retailer]]s' inventory may exist in a warehouse or in a [[Retailing#Shops and stores|shop]] or store accessible to [[customers]]. Inventories not intended for sale to customers or to [[consumer|client]]s may be held in any premises an organization uses. Stock ties up cash and, if uncontrolled, it will be impossible to know the actual level of stocks and therefore impossible to control them. While the reasons for holding stock were covered earlier, most manufacturing organizations usually divide their "goods for sale" inventory into: * [[Raw materials]] - materials and components scheduled for use in making a product. * [[Work in process]], WIP - materials and components that have begun their transformation to finished goods. * [[Finished goods]] - goods ready for sale to customers. * Goods for resale - returned goods that are salable. For example: ====Manufacturing==== A canned food manufacturer's materials inventory includes the ingredients to form the foods to be canned, empty cans and their lids (or coils of steel or aluminum for constructing those components), labels, and anything else (solder, glue, ...) that will form part of a finished can. The firm's work in process includes those materials from the time of release to the work floor until they become complete and ready for sale to wholesale or retail customers. This may be vats of prepared food, filled cans not yet labeled or sub-assemblies of food components. It may also include finished cans that are not yet packaged into cartons or pallets. Its finished good inventory consists of all the filled and labeled cans of food in its warehouse that it has manufactured and wishes to sell to food distributors (wholesalers), to grocery stores (retailers), and even perhaps to consumers through arrangements like [[factory outlet|factory store]]s and outlet centers. Examples of case studies are very revealing, and consistently show that the improvement of inventory management has two parts: the capability of the organisation to manage inventory, and the way in which it chooses to do so. For example, a company may wish to install a complex inventory system, but unless
