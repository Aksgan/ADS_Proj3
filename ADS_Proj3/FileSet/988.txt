</ref> However, the way that Enigma was used by the Germans, with the exception of their Navy, meant that, if the settings for one day (or whatever period was represented by each row of the setting sheet) were established, the rest of the messages for that network on that day could quickly be deciphered.<ref>[[Jack Copeland|Copeland]] (2004) p. 250</ref> The security of Enigma ciphers did have fundamental weaknesses that proved helpful to cryptanalysts. #A letter could never be [[encrypt]]ed to itself <ref>Mahon (1945) p. 3</ref>(with the exception of the early models A and B, which lacked a reflector). This property was of great help in using ''[[Known-plaintext attack|cribs]]''—short sections of plaintext thought to be somewhere in the ciphertext—and could be used to eliminate a crib in a particular position. For a possible location, if any letter in the crib matched a letter in the ciphertext at the same position, the location could be ruled out; at Britain's [[Government Code and Cipher School]] (GCCS) at [[Bletchley Park]], this was termed a ''crash''.<ref>Mahon (1945) p. 16</ref> It was this feature that the British [[mathematician]] and [[logic]]ian [[Alan Turing]] would exploit in designing the British [[bombe]]. #The plugboard connections were reciprocal, so that if A was plugged to N, then N likewise became A. It was this property that led mathematician [[Gordon Welchman]] at Bletchley Park to propose that a ''diagonal board'' be introduced into the bombe, substantially reducing the number of incorrect rotor settings that the bombes found.<ref>[[Gordon Welchman|Welchman]] (1984) pp. 301-7</ref> #The notches in the ''alphabet rings'' of rotors I to V were in different positions, which helped cryptanalysts to work out the ''wheel order'' by observing when the middle rotor was turned over by the right-hand rotor.<ref> [[Friedrich L.

On 1 September 1932, a 27-year-old Polish mathematician, [[Marian Rejewski]], joined the Bureau along with two fellow [[Poznań University]] mathematics graduates, [[Henryk Zygalski]] and [[Jerzy Różycki]].<ref>[[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski]]; [[Richard Woytak|Woytak]] (1984) p. 231 </ref> Their first task had to be the solving of the logical structure of the military Enigma, which differed from the commercial version that they had seen. [[Image:MR 1932 small.jpg|thumb|[[Marian Rejewski]] about 1932, when he first broke [[Enigma machine|Enigma]]]] In December 1932, the [[Polish Cipher Bureau]] received from Captain [[Gustave Bertrand]] of French Military Intelligence two German documents and two pages of Enigma daily keys (for September and October of that year)<ref>[[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski]]; [[Richard Woytak|Woytak]] (1984) p. 256</ref> which had been obtained by the French from an agent who worked at Germany's Cipher Office in Berlin, [[Hans Thilo-Schmidt]]. The documents were ''Instructions for Using the Enigma Cipher Machine'' and ''Keying Instructions for the Enigma Cipher Machine''. This material enabled Rejewski to achieve "one of the most important breakthroughs in [[cryptology|cryptologic]] history"<ref>[[David Kahn (writer)|David Kahn]] (1996) p. 974 </ref> by using elementary [[group theory]] to solve the Enigma wiring independently of the plugboard connections.<ref>Wilcox (2001) p. 5</ref><ref>[[Andrew Hodges|Hodges]] (1983) p. 170</ref> Marian Rejewski later recalled that the table of keys was {{blockquote|a great help to me, because thanks to [them] the number of unknowns in the equations was reduced, and I was able to solve [the] equations, and... as I was sitting there writing, the internal connections just came out in the form... of letters or numbers, I don't recall [which]—the internal connections ['wiring'] for the first [rotor], the one... on the far right, which always... revolved at every depression of a key.<ref>[[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski]]; [[Richard Woytak|Woytak]] (1984) p. 233</ref>}}and that{{blockquote|it was very important that the months [covered in the daily-key tables] happened to be September and October, in other words, periods that belonged to two different quarters [of the year. This is] because... the key consisted of several elements [and] one element of the key was changed only once a quarter. Namely, the order of the [rotors].... [A]t that time they were changed once a quarter. [S]ince September and October belonged to two different quarters, in September and October the orders of the [rotors] were different. [With] the method that I had been using to find the [wiring] in a [rotor]... I could only solve the [far] right-hand [rotor], the one that revolved one place every time [a key was pressed]. The point is that, thanks to the keys for September, I could solve the [rotor] that was in the far right-hand position in September. And since I also had the keys for October, using the same method I was later able to find the [wiring] in the [rotor] that was at the [far] right in October. [T]he third [rotor] and... the [reflector] now weren't so difficult... I managed to find them by other methods.<ref>[[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski]]; [[Richard Woytak|Woytak]] (1984) p. 234</ref>}} A crucial inspired guess on Rejewski's part was that the connections between the keyboard and the entry ring were in alphabetical order, rather than in the order of the keys on a German typewriter keyboard: QWERTZUIO... — the order that was used in the commercial Enigma. Britain's [[Dilly Knox]] was astonished when he learned, in July 1939, that the entry-ring order was so simple.<ref>[[Jack Copeland|Copeland]] (2004) p. 234</ref><ref>[[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski]] (1984 d) p. 257 citing {{ Citation | last = Fitzgerald | first = Penelope | author-link = Penelope Fitzgerald | year = 1977 | title = The Knox Brothers | publication-place = London | publisher = Macmillan | isbn = 1-58243-095-0 }}</ref> Having worked out the logical structure of the military Enigma, Rejewski had replicas made, which he called [[Polish Enigma doubles|'Enigma doubles']].
