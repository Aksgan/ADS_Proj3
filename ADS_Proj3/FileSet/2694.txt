and Poldi, as she was known, had nine children in all. There were four girls: Hermine, [[Margaret Stonborough-Wittgenstein|Margaret]] (Gretl)&mdash;who was analysed by [[Sigmund Freud]] in the early 1930s&mdash;Helene, and a fourth daughter who died as a baby; and five boys: Johannes (Hans), Kurt, Rudolf (Rudi), and Paul, who became a concert pianist despite losing an arm in the war, and for whom [[Maurice Ravel]] wrote his ''Piano Concerto for the Left Hand''. Ludwig was the youngest of the family.<ref name=Bartley16>Bartley, William Warren. ''Wittgenstein''. Open Court, 1994, p. 16, first published 1973.</ref> The children were baptized as Catholics, and raised in an exceptionally intense environment. The family sat at the center of Vienna's cultural life, with [[Bruno Walter]] describing life at Palais Wittgenstein as an "all-pervading atmosphere of humanity and culture."<ref>Monk, p. 8.</ref> Karl was a leading patron of the arts, commissioning works by [[Auguste Rodin]] and financing the city's exhibition hall and art gallery, the [[Secession hall (Austria)|Secession Building]]. [[Gustav Klimt]] painted Wittgenstein's sister for her wedding portrait, and [[Johannes Brahms]] and [[Gustav Mahler]] gave regular concerts in the family's numerous music rooms, though [[Alexander Waugh]] writes that the firstborn, Hermine, was so nervous of Brahms that, when once invited to sit with him at dinner, she spent most of the evening vomiting in one of the bathrooms.<ref>Waugh, p. 9.</ref> ===Brothers' suicides=== [[File:The Wittgensteins 1890.jpg|thumb|180px|left|From left, Helene, Rudi, Hermine, Ludwig (the baby), [[Margaret Stonborough-Wittgenstein|Gretl]], [[Paul Wittgenstein|Paul]], Hans, and Kurt, around 1890]] Karl's aim was to turn his sons into captains of industry. [[Ray Monk]] writes that they were not sent to school lest they acquire bad habits, but were educated at home to prepare them for work in Karl's business empire.<ref name=Monk11>Monk, p. 11ff.</ref> Instead, three of them committed suicide, Paul became a concert pianist, and Wittgenstein a philosopher after a brief period as an engineer.<ref name=Kenny>Kenny, Anthony.

He tells a story about Paul practicing one day on one of the family's seven grand pianos. He leapt up and shouted at Wittgenstein in the next room: "I cannot play when you are in the house, as I feel your scepticism seeping towards me from under the door!"<ref name=Gottlieb>Gottlieb, Anthony.

Alexander Waugh writes that the boy's first word was "Oedipus". At the age of four, Waugh writes, Hans could identify the [[Doppler effect]] in a passing siren as a quarter-tone drop in pitch, and at five started crying "Wrong! Wrong!" when two brass bands in a carnival played the same tune in different keys. He was hailed as a musical genius, and was probably homosexual; he died in mysterious circumstances in May 1902, when he ran away to America then disappeared from a boat in [[Chesapeake Bay]], likely a suicide.<ref>Waugh, pp. 24–26. *Also see Monk, p. 11ff.</ref> Exactly a year later, aged 22 and studying chemistry at the Berlin Academy, his brother Rudi walked into a bar on the Brandenburgstrasse, asked the pianist to play Thomas Koschat's "Verlassen, verlassen, verlassen bin ich," then mixed himself a drink of milk and [[potassium cyanide]], dying in agony. He left several suicide notes, one to his parents that said he was grieving over the death of a friend, and another that referred to his "perverted disposition." It was reported at the time that he had sought advice from the [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee]], an organization that was campaigning against [[Paragraph 175]] of the German Criminal Code, which from 1871 until 1969 forbade homosexual sex. His father forbade the family from ever mentioning his name again.<ref>Waugh, pp. 21–22. *For the primary source, see Hirschfield, Magnus.

Paul also considered suicide, as did Wittgenstein.<ref name=Gottlieb/> He told a friend, [[David Pinsent]], that when Bertrand Russell first encouraged him in his philosophy in January 1912, it had ended nine years of loneliness and wanting to die, though Russell was so worried about his state of mind that he predicted Wittgenstein would kill himself by February 1914.<ref>Monk, p. 41. *McGuinness, Brian.
