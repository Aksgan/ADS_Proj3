usage whereby different threads can run different Brook programs concurrently (this allows a multi-GPU setup to be maxed out) and [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]] and [[OpenMP]] support for the CPU backend (this allows near maximal usage of modern CPUs). Later versions might include [[Brook+]], a version supporting integer and double precision processing for AMD GPUs, possibly with scatter support. ==Performance Comparison== A like for like comparison between desktop CPUs and GPGPUs is problematic because of algorithmic & structural differences. For example, a 2.66 GHz [[Intel Core 2 Duo]] can perform a maximum of 25 [[FLOPS|GFLOPs]] (25 billion single precision floating point operations per second) if optimally using SSE and streaming memory access so the prefetcher works perfectly. However, traditionally (due to shader program length limits) most GPGPU kernels tend to perform relatively small amounts of work on large amounts of data in parallel, so the big problem with directly executing GPGPU algorithms on desktop CPUs is vastly lower memory bandwidth as generally speaking the CPU spends most of its time waiting on RAM. As an example, dual channel PC2-6400 DDR2 RAM can throughput about 11Gb/sec which is around 1.5 GFLOPs maximum given that there is a total of 3 GFLOPs total bandwidth and one must both read and write. As a result, if memory bandwidth constrained, Brook's CPU backend won't exceed 2 GFLOPs. In practice, it's even lower than that most especially for anything other than float4 which is the only data type which can be SSE accelerated. On an [[Radeon R600|ATI HD 2900 XT]] (740 MHz core 1000 MHz memory), Brook can perform a maximum of 410 GFLOPs via its DX9 backend. OpenGL is currently (due to driver and [[Cg (programming language)|Cg]] compiler limitations) much less efficient as a GPGPU backend and Brook can only manage 210 GFLOPs via OpenGL. On paper, this looks like around twenty times faster than the CPU, but as just explained it isn't as easy as that. GPUs currently have major branch and read/write access penalties so expect a reasonable maximum of one third of the peak maximum in real world code - this still leaves that ATI card at around 125 GFLOPs some five times faster than the Intel Core 2 Duo. However this discounts the important part of transferring the data to be processed to and from the GPU. With a [[PCI Express]] 1.0 x8 interface, the memory of an ATI HD 2900 XT can be written to at about 730Mb/sec and read from at about 311Mb/sec which is significantly slower than normal PC memory. For large datasets, this can greatly diminish the speed increase of using a GPU over a well-tuned CPU implementation. Of course, as GPUs become faster far more quickly than CPUs and the PCI Express interface improves, it will make more sense to offload large processing to GPUs. ==Applications and games that use BrookGPU== * ''[[Folding@home]]'' ==See also== {{Portal|Free software}} *[[GPGPU]] *[[CUDA]] *[[Close to Metal]] *[[OpenCL]] *[[Lib Sh]] *[[Intel Ct]] ==External links== *[http://graphics.stanford.edu/projects/brookgpu/ Official BrookGPU website] - Stanford University's BrookGPU website *[http://www.sf.net/projects/brook/ Link to download BrookGPU package] *[http://www.gpgpu.org/ GPGPU] General Purpose computation using GPUs, a common use of BrookGPU. *[http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/brookgpu/ Paper and Presentation on "Brook for GPUs: Stream Computing on Graphics Hardware" for SIGGRAPH 2004 by Ian Buck et al.] *[http://ati.amd.com/technology/streamcomputing/AMD-Brookplus.pdf] AMD Brook+ Presentation (.pdf).

The Buckingham potential describes the repulsive [[exchange repulsion]] that originates from the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] by a more realistic exponential function of distance, in contrast to the inverse twelfth power used by the [[Lennard-Jones potential]]. However, since the Buckingham potential is finite even at very small distances, it runs the risk of an unphysical "Buckingham catastrophe" at short range when used in simulations of charged systems; this occurs when the electrostatic attraction artifactually overcomes the repulsive barrier. The [[Lennard-Jones potential]] is also quicker to compute, and is more frequently used in [[molecular dynamics]] and other simulations. ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.sklogwiki.org/SklogWiki/index.php/Buckingham_potential Buckingham potential] on [http://www.sklogwiki.org/SklogWiki/index.php/Main_Page SklogWiki] [[category: Theoretical chemistry]] [[category: Computational chemistry]] [[Category:Thermodynamics]] [[Category:Chemical bonding]] [[Category:Intermolecular forces]] [[Category:Potential]]</text> </page> <page> <id>4665</id> <title>Buddhist studies</title> <text>{{Buddhism}} '''Buddhist studies''', also known as '''[[Buddhology]]''' (although the latter term is sometimes reserved for the study of [[Buddhas]] rather than that of Buddhism as a whole), is the [[academic]] study of [[Buddhism]]. The term applies especially to the modern academic field, which is a subset of [[Religious Studies]], and is distinct from [[Buddhist philosophy]] or Buddhist theology. As with Religious Studies in general, scholars of Buddhist Studies represent a variety of disciplines including [[history]], [[anthropology]], and [[philosophy]]. In contrast to the study of [[Judaism]] or [[Christianity]], the field of Buddhist Studies has been dominated by "outsiders" to Buddhist cultures and traditions. However, [[Japan]]ese universities have also made major contributions, as have Asian immigrants to Western countries, and Western converts to Buddhism. ==Relationship to contemporary Buddhism== Charles Prebish, a scholar-practitioner, describes the academics who are also Buddhist practitioner as fulfilling a crucial traditional role that has gone otherwise unfilled in countries that are not traditionally Buddhist: <blockquote>Throughout much of Buddhism’s history, Buddhist scholarship and practice have been two very distinct vocations in a highly polarized tradition. Not surprisingly, stories reflecting the study/practice dichotomy in Buddhism are abundant in both the primary and secondary literature on the subject. Walpola Rahula’s History of Buddhism in Ceylon provides a good summary of the issue. During the first century B.C.E., in response to a concern over the possible loss of the Tripitaka during a severe famine, a question arose: What is the basis of the Teaching
