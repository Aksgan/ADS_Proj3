to know which modal logics are sound and complete with respect to a class of Kripke frames, and to determine also which class that is. For any class ''C'' of Kripke frames, Thm(''C'') is a [[normal modal logic]] (in particular, theorems of the minimal normal modal logic, ''K'', are valid in every Kripke model). However, the converse does not hold in general. There are Kripke incomplete normal modal logics, which is not a problem, because most of the modal systems studied are complete of classes of frames described by simple conditions. A normal modal logic ''L'' '''corresponds''' to a class of frames ''C'', if ''C'' = Mod(''L''). In other words, ''C'' is the largest class of frames such that ''L'' is sound wrt ''C''. It follows that ''L'' is Kripke complete if and only if it is complete of its corresponding class. Consider the schema '''T''' : <math>\Box A\to A</math>. '''T''' is valid in any [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] frame <math>\langle W,R\rangle</math>: if <math>w\Vdash \Box A</math>, then <math>w\Vdash A</math> since ''w'' ''R'' ''w''. On the other hand, a frame which validates '''T''' has to be reflexive: fix ''w'' ∈ ''W'', and define satisfaction of a propositional variable ''p'' as follows: <math>u\Vdash p</math> if and only if ''w'' ''R'' ''u''. Then <math>w\Vdash \Box p</math>, thus <math>w\Vdash p</math> by '''T''', which means ''w'' ''R'' ''w'' using the definition of <math>\Vdash</math>. '''T''' corresponds to the class of reflexive Kripke frames. It is often much easier to characterize the corresponding class of ''L'' than to prove its completeness, thus correspondence serves as a guide to completeness proofs. Correspondence is also used to show ''incompleteness'' of modal logics: suppose ''L''<sub>1</sub> ⊆ ''L''<sub>2</sub> are normal modal logics that correspond to the same class of frames, but ''L''<sub>1</sub> does not prove all theorems of ''L''<sub>2</sub>. Then ''L''<sub>1</sub> is Kripke incomplete. For example, the schema <math>\Box(A\equiv\Box A)\to\Box A</math> generates an incomplete logic, as it corresponds to the same class of frames as '''GL''' (viz. transitive and converse well-founded frames), but does not prove the '''GL'''-tautology <math>\Box A\to\Box\Box A</math>. The table below is a list of common modal axioms together with their corresponding classes.

Canonical Kripke models play a role similar to the [[Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra]] construction in algebraic semantics. A set of formulas is ''L''-''consistent'' if no contradiction can be derived from them using the axioms of ''L'', and Modus Ponens. A ''maximal L-consistent set'' (an ''L''-''MCS'' for short) is an ''L''-consistent set which has no proper ''L''-consistent superset. The '''canonical model''' of ''L'' is a Kripke model <math>\langle W,R,\Vdash\rangle</math>, where ''W'' is the set of all ''L''-''MCS'', and the relations ''R'' and <math>\Vdash</math> are as follows: : <math>X\;R\;Y</math> if and only if for every formula <math>A</math>, if <math>\Box A\in X</math> then <math>A\in Y</math>, : <math>X\Vdash A</math> if and only if <math>A\in X</math>. The canonical model is a model of ''L'', as every ''L''-''MCS'' contains all theorems of ''L''. By [[Zorn's lemma]], each ''L''-consistent set is contained in an ''L''-''MCS'', in particular every formula unprovable in ''L'' has a counterexample in the canonical model. The main application of canonical models are completeness proofs. Properties of the canonical model of '''K''' immediately imply completeness of '''K''' with respect to the class of all Kripke frames. This argument does ''not'' work for arbitrary ''L'', because there is no guarantee that the underlying ''frame'' of the canonical model satisfies the frame conditions of ''L''. We say that a formula or a set ''X'' of formulas is
