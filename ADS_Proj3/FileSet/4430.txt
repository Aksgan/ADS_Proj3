This little book became one of the scientific classics of the 20th century and it is very important not only for [[psychopathology]], but also for modern linguistics, semantics and philosophy. Studying the various deviations from the stereotypes of everyday behavior, strange defects and malfunctions, as well as seemingly random errors, the author concludes that they indicate the underlying pathology of the psyche, the symptoms of [[psychoneurosis]]. This is how Freud introduces his book: :''During the year 1898 I published a short essay On the Psychic Mechanism of Forgetfulness. I shall now repeat its contents and take it as a starting-point for further discussion. I have there undertaken a psychologic analysis of a common case of temporary forgetfulness of proper names, and from a pregnant example of my own observation I have reached the conclusion that this frequent and practically unimportant occurrence of a failure of a psychic function — of memory — admits an explanation which goes beyond the customary utilization of this phenomenon. If an average psychologist should be asked to explain how it happens that we often fail to recall a name which we are sure we know, he would probably content himself with the answer that proper names are more apt to be forgotten than any other content of memory. He might give plausible reasons for this “forgetting preference” for proper names, but he would not assume any deep determinant for the process.'' Freud believed that various deviations from the stereotypes of everyday conduct - seemingly unintended reservation, forgetting words, random movements and actions - are a manifestation of unconscious thoughts and impulses. Explaining "wrong actions" with the help of psychoanalysis, just as the [[interpretation of dreams]], can be effectively used for diagnosis and therapy. Considering the numerous cases of such deviations, he concludes that the boundary between the normal and abnormal human psyche is unstable and that we are all a bit neurotic. Such symptoms are able to disrupt eating, sexual relations, regular work, and communication with others. This is the conclusion Freud makes at the end of the book: :''The unconscious, at all events, knows no time limit. The most important as well as the most peculiar character of psychic fixation consists in the fact that all impressions are on the one hand retained in the same form as they were received, and also in the forms that they have assumed in their further development. This state of affairs cannot be elucidated by any comparison from any other sphere. By virtue of this theory every former state of the memory content may thus be restored, even though all original relations have long been replaced by newer ones.'' ==References== "Sigmund Freud", [[Richard Wollheim]] , Publisher: [[Cambridge University Press]] (March 23, 1981), ISBN 978-0521283854 {{DEFAULTSORT:Psychopathology of Everyday Life, The}} [[Category:Books by Sigmund Freud]] [[Category:1901 books]] [[Category:Psychology books]] [[bg:Психопатология на всекидневния живот]] [[de:Zur Psychopathologie des Alltagslebens]] [[es:Psicopatología de la vida cotidiana]] [[fr:Psychopathologie de la vie quotidienne]] [[ru:Психопатология повседневной жизни]]</text> </page> <page> <id>37441</id> <title>The Ragged Edge of Science</title> <text>{{Infobox Book | <!-- See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels]] or [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Books]] --> | name = The Ragged Edge of Science | title_orig = | translator = | image = [[Image:Ragged edge of science.jpg|200px]] | image_caption = Dust-jacket for ''The Ragged Edge of Science'' | author = [[L.
