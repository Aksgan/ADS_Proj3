theory to explain this phenomenon is that development is less necessary in tropical regions - "you can lie in a hammock and pick bananas,"{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} as opposed to the need to invent agriculture and economy in order to prosper and survive. This explanation, while convenient, may not be sufficiently complex to truly explain the equatorial paradox. It is noteworthy that the equatorial paradox only emerged from the [[Modern Era]] onwards, with more highly developed cultures and economies being present in the [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] regions than outside it. In the context of a statistical analysis, the paradox is probably more a consequence of subjugation and [[colonization]]. The latter all but arrested economical and infrastructural development, except as needed to fulfil the colonial power's aims. Climatic Determinism was intensely studied by [[Ellsworth Huntington]]. ===Urban=== Environmental determinism has been adopted by the urban design field to describe the effects the built environment may have on behaviour. This is the basis of the concept of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) which attempts to modify disruptive behaviours through appropriate design of the physical environment. This concept is also the basis of active space which tries to encourage activity through the design of a space. == See also == * [[Environmental sociology]] * [[Cultural ecology]] * [[Cultural materialism (anthropology)]] * [[Sociocultural evolution]] * [[Ecological anthropology]] * [[Social determinism]] * [[Biological determinism]] * [[Cultural determinism]] * [[Technological determinism]] * [[Determinism]] * [[Biological determination (sociology)]] ==References== {{Reflist}} {{Determinism}} {{Geography topics}} [[Category:Determinism]] [[Category:Human geography]] [[Category:Sociological theories]] [[Category:History of geography]] [[be:Геаграфічны дэтэрмінізм]] [[de:Geodeterminismus]] [[hr:Okolinski determinizam]] [[id:Determinisme lingkungan]] [[pl:Determinizm środowiskowy]] [[pt:Determinismo geográfico]] [[ru:Географический детерминизм]] [[sk:Environmentálny determinizmus]] [[sl:Okoljski determinizem]] [[sv:Geografisk determinism]] [[uk:Географічний детермінізм]] [[zh:環境決定論]]</text> </page> <page> <id>12320</id> <title>Environmental enrichment (neural)</title> <text>[[Image:Rat coming out cage.jpg ‎|right|thumb|350px| A rodent is not stimulated by the environment in a wire cage, and this affects its brain negatively, particularly the complexity of its synaptic connections]] '''Environmental enrichment''' concerns how the [[brain]] is affected by the stimulation of its [[information processing]] provided by its surroundings (including the opportunity to interact socially). Brains in richer, more stimulating environments, have increased numbers of [[Synaptogenesis|synapses]], and the [[dendrites|dendrite arbors]] upon which they reside are more complex. This effect happens particularly during [[neurodevelopment]], but also to a lesser degree in adulthood. With extra synapses there is also increased synapse activity and so increased size and number of [[glial]] energy support cells. Capillary [[capillary|vasculation]] also is greater to provide the neurons and glial cells with extra energy. The [[neuropil]] (neurons, glial cells, capillaries, combined together) expands making the cortex thicker. There may also exist (at least in rodents) more [[neurogenesis|neurons]]. Research in nonhuman animals finds that more stimulating environment could aid the treatment and recovery of a diverse variety of brain related dysfunctions, including [[Alzheimer’s disease]] and those connected to [[aging]], whereas a lack of stimulation might impair cognitive development. Research upon humans suggests that lack of stimulation (deprivation—such as in old-style orphanages) delays and impairs cognitive development. Research also finds that higher levels of education (which is both cognitively stimulating in itself, and associates with people engaging in more challenging cognitive activities) results in greater resilience ([[cognitive reserve]]) to the effects of aging and dementia. ==Early research== [[Donald O. Hebb]] in 1947 found that rats raised as pets performed better on problem solving tests than rats raised in cages.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hebb DO |title=The effects of early experience on problem solving at maturity |journal=American Psychologist |volume=2 |pages=306–7 |year=1947}}</ref> His research, however, did not investigate the brain nor use standardized impoverished and enriched environments. Research doing this first was started in 1960 by [[Mark Rosenzweig]] who compared single rats in normal cages, and those placed in ones with toys, ladders, tunnels, running wheels in groups. This found that growing up in enriched environents affected enzyme [[cholinesterase]] activity.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/h0045402 |author=Krech D, Rosenzweig MR, Bennett EL |title=Effects of environmental complexity and training on brain chemistry |journal=J Comp Physiol Psychol |volume=53 |pages=509–19 |year=1960 |month=December |pmid=13754181 }}</ref> This work led in 1962 to the discovery that environmental enrichment increased [[cerebral cortex]] volume.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/h0041137 |author=Rosenzweig MR, Krech D, Bennett EL, Diamond MC |title=Effects of environmental complexity and training on brain chemistry and anatomy: a replication and extension |journal=J Comp Physiol Psychol |volume=55 |pages=429–37 |year=1962 |month=August |pmid=14494091 }}</ref> In 1964, it was found that this was due to increased cerebral cortex thickness and greater [[synapse]] and [[glial]] numbers.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/2041161a0 |author=Altman J, Das GD |title=Autoradiographic Examination of the Effects of Enriched Environment on the Rate of Glial Multiplication in the Adult Rat Brain |journal=Nature |volume=204 |pages=1161–3 |year=1964 |month=December |pmid=14264369 }}</ref><ref name="DiamondKrech">{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/cne.901230110 |author=Diamond MC, Krech D, Rosenzweig MR |title=The Effects of an Enriched Environment on the Histology of the Rat Cerebral Cortex |journal=J.
