is at least one element ''d'' of the domain such that &phi;(''d'') is satisfied. Strictly speaking, a substitution instance such as the formula &phi;(''d'') mentioned above is not a formula in the original formal language of &phi;, because ''d'' is an element of the domain. There are two ways of handling this technical issue. The first is to pass to a larger language in which each element of the domain is named by a constant symbol. The second is to add to the interpretation a function that assigns each variable to an element of the domain. Then the T-schema can quantify over variations of the original interpretation in which this variable assignment function is changed, instead of quantifying over substitution instances. Some authors also admit [[propositional variable]]s in first-order logic, which must then also be interpreted. A propositional variable can stand on its own as an atomic formula. The interpretation of a propositional variable is one of the two truth values ''true'' and ''false.''<ref>{{Citation | last = Mates | first = Benson | title = Elementary Logic, Second Edition | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | date = 1972 | location = New York | pages = p. 56 | isbn = 019501491X }}</ref> Because the first-order interpretations described here are defined in set theory, they do not associate each predicate symbol with a property <ref>The extension of a property (also called an attribute) is a set of individuals, so a property is a unary relation.

In other words, these first-order interpretations are [[Extensional definition|extensional]] <ref>see also [[Extension (predicate logic)]]</ref> not [[Intensional definition|intensional]]. === Example of a first-order interpretation === An example of interpretation <math>\mathcal{I}</math> of the language '''L''' described above is as follows. * Domain: A chess set * Individual constants: a: The white King b: The black Queen c: The white Kings's pawn * F(x): x is a piece * G(x): x is a pawn * H(x): x is black * I(x): x is white * J(x, y): x can capture y In the interpretation <math>\mathcal{I}</math> of L: * the following are true sentences: F(a), G(c), H(b), I(a) J(b, c), * the following are false sentences: J(a, c), G(a). === Non-empty domain requirement === As stated above, a first-order interpretation is usually required to specify a nonempty set as the domain of discourse. The reason for this requirement is to guarantee that equivalences such as ::<math>(\phi \lor \exists x \psi) \leftrightarrow \exists x (\phi \lor \psi)</math>, where ''x'' is not a free variable of φ, are logically valid. This equivalence holds in every interpretation with a nonempty domain, but does not always hold when empty domains are permitted. For example, the equivalence :<math>[\forall y (y = y) \lor \exists x ( x = x)] \equiv \exists x [ \forall y ( y = y) \lor x = x]</math> fails in any structure with an empty domain. Thus the proof theory of first-order logic becomes more complicated when empty structures are permitted. However, the gain in allowing them is negligible, as both the intended interpretations and the interesting interpretations of the theories people study have non-empty domains.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Hailperin | first1=Theodore | title=Quantification theory and empty individual-domains | id={{MathSciNet | id = 0057820}} | year=1953 | journal=The Journal of Symbolic Logic | volume=18 | pages=197–200 | doi=10.2307/2267402 | url=http://jstor.org/stable/2267402 | issue=3 | publisher=Association for Symbolic Logic}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | last1=Quine | first1=W.

Thus it is acceptable for relation symbols to be interpreted as being identically false. However, the interpretation of a function symbol must always assign a well-defined and total function to the symbol. === Interpreting equality === The equality relation is often treated specially in first order logic and other predicate logics. There are two general approaches. The first approach is to treat equality as no different than any other binary relation. In this case, if an equality symbol is included in the signature, it is usually necessary to add various axioms about equality to axiom systems (for example, the substitution axiom saying that if ''a'' = ''b'' and ''R''(''a'') holds then ''R''(''b'') holds as well). This approach to equality is most useful when studying signatures that do not include the equality relation, such as the signature for [[set theory]] or the signature for [[second-order arithmetic]] in which there is only an equality relation for numbers, but not an equality relation for set of numbers. The second approach is to treat the equality relation symbol as a logical constant that must be interpreted by the real equality relation in any interpretation. An interpretation that interprets equality this way is known as a '''normal model''', so this second approach is the same as only studying interpretations that happen to be normal models. The advantage of this approach is that the axioms related to equality are automatically satisfied by every normal model, and so they do not need to be explicitly included in first-order theories when equality is treated this way. This second approach is sometimes called '''first order logic with equality''', but many authors adopt it for the general study of first-order logic without comment. There are a few other reasons to restrict study of first-order logic to normal models. First, it is known that any first-order interpretation in which equality is interpreted by an [[equivalence relation]] and satisfies the substitution axioms for equality can be cut down to an [[elementary substructure|elementarily equivalent]] interpretation on a subset of the original domain. Thus there is little additional generality in studying non-normal models. Second, if
