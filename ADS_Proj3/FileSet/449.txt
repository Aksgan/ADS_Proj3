students, researchers and professionals to meet and collaborate on research themes of mutual interest. BioLogue's focus areas include [[translational research]], biomarkers, [[Medical imaging|imaging]], [[clinical research]] and [[biobanks]]. The overall aim of activities is to facilitate the development of novel medicines and related health care products, and to make them available to patients. The consortium is integrated with the university collaboration, Danish Pharma Consortium, and it has activities at both national and international levels, e.g. International Science Partnering Missions (e.g. Israel, United Kingdom, The Netherlands, USA) and European Technology Platform Initiatives. BioLogue was founded in 2005, and it is hosted by [[University of Copenhagen]]. ==References== * Nordic-Baltic Expatriates Forum [http://www.nordexpat.eu] * Medicon Valley [http://www.mediconvalley.com/Networks/Other%20networks/BioLogue] * Healthy Growth [http://www.oresundfood.org/?page=focusareas&focusarea=1208274677&theme=1223976240] * BioLogue Information - [http://www.biologue.ku.dk/Newsletter/BioLogue_Information_200903_v1.2.pdf] ==See also== * [[Lund University]] * [[University of Copenhagen]] * [[Technical University of Denmark]] ==External links== * [http://www.biologue.org BioLogue] * [http://danskbiotek.customers.composite.net/ DANSK BIOTEK] * [http://www.lifdk.dk/ The Danish Association of the Pharmaceutical Industry] * [http://www.dkma.dk Danish Medicines Agency] * [http://www.regionh.dk Capital Region of Denmark] * [http://www.ssi.dk/default.asp Statens Serum Institut] * [http://www.copenhagenttc.dk/ Copenhagen Tech Transfer Consortium] * [http://www.dctb.org/ Danish Centre for Translational Breast Cancer Research] * [http://www.copcap.dk Copenhagen Capacity] * [http://en.fi.dk EuroCenter, The Danish Agency for Science, Technology and Innovation] * [http://www.mediconvalley.com Medicon Valley] * [http://www.mva.org Medicon Valley Alliance] * [http://www.biosys.sk Biosys Innovation Network on Bioinformatics and Systems Biology] * [http://www.scanbalt.org ScanBalt] [[Category:Biotechnology]] [[Category:Biological databases]] [[Category:High-technology business districts]] [[Category:Science and technology in Denmark]] [[Category:Science and technology in Sweden]] [[Category:Science and technology in Europe]] [[Category:Pharmaceutical industry]] [[Category:European Union and science and technology]] [[Category:Seventh Framework Programme projects]] [[Category:Medical research]] [[Category:Clinical research]] [[Category:Human experimentation]] [[Category:Research ethics]] {{health-stub}} [[ar:بيولوجو]] [[da:Biologue]]</text> </page> <page> <id>3923</id> <title>Biomolecular Object Network Databank</title> <text>The '''Biomolecular Object Network Databank''' ('''BOND''') is a [[bioinformatics]] [[databank]] containing information on [[small molecule]] and [[protein sequence]]s, structures and interactions.

On December 14, 2005 Unleashed Informatics Limited acquired the commercial rights to The Blueprint Initiative [[intellectual property]]. This included rights to the protein interaction database BIND, the small molecule interaction database SMID, as well as the data warehouse SeqHound. Unleashed Informatics is a data management service provider and is overseeing the management and curation of The Blueprint Initiative under the guidance of Dr. Hogue.<ref>[http://www.blueprint.org Blueprint.org]</ref> ==Construction== BOND integrates the original Blueprint Initiative databases as well as other databases, such as [[Genbank]], combined with many tools required to analyze these data. Annotation links for sequences, including taxon identifiers, redundant sequences, [[Gene Ontology]] descriptions, [[Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man]] identifiers, [[conserved domains]], data base cross-references, LocusLink Identifiers and complete genomes are also available. Bond facilitates cross-database queries and is an [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] resource which integrates interaction and sequence data. <ref name= "BOND">[http://bond.unleashedinformatics.com BOND at Unleashed Informatics]</ref> ==Small Molecule Interaction Database (SMID)== The [[Small Molecule]] Interaction Database is a database containing protein domain-small molecule interactions. It uses a domain-based approach to identify domain families, found in the Conserved Domain Database ([[CDD]]), which interact with a query small molecule. The CDD from [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|NCBI]] amalgamates data from several different sources; [[Protein FAMilies]] (PFAM), [[Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool]] (SMART), [[Cluster of Orthologous Genes]] (COGs), and NCBI’s own curated sequences. The data in SMID is derived from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a database of known protein crystal structures. SMID can be queried by entering a protein GI, domain identifier, PDB ID or SMID ID. The results of a search provide small molecule, protein, and domain information for each interaction identified in the database. Interactions with non-biological contacts are normally screened out by default. SMID-BLAST is a tool developed to annotate known small-molecule binding sites as well as to predict binding sites in proteins whose [[crystal structures]] have not yet been determined. The prediction is based on extrapolation of known interactions, found in the PDB, to interactions between an uncrystallized protein with a small molecule of interest. SMID-BLAST was validated against a test set of known small molecule interactions from the PDB. It was shown to be an accurate predictor of protein-small molecule interactions; 60% of predicted interactions identically matched the PDB annotated binding site, and of these 73% had greater than 80% of the binding residues of the protein correctly identified. Hogue, C et al. estimated that 45% of predictions that were not observed in the PDB data do in fact represent true positives. <ref>Snyder, K, ''et al.''.

BMC Bioinformatics 7: 152 (2006)</ref> ==Biomolecular Interaction Network Database (BIND)== ===Introduction=== The idea of a database to document all known molecular interactions was originally put forth by [[Tony Pawson]] in the 1990’s and was later developed by scientists at the [[University of Toronto]] in collaboration with the [[University of British Columbia]]. The development of the Biomolecular Interaction Network Database (BIND) has been supported by grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research ([[CIHR]]), Genome Canada, the Canadian Foundation for Innovation and the Ontario Research and Development Fund. BIND was originally designed to be a constantly growing depository for information regarding biomolecular interactions, molecular complexes and pathways. As [[proteomics]] is a rapidly advancing field, there is a need to have information from scientific journals readily available to researchers. BIND facilitates the understanding of molecular interactions and pathways involved in cellular processes and will eventually give scientists a better understanding of developmental processes and disease pathogenesis The major goals of the BIND project are: to create a public proteomics resource that is available to all; to create a platform to enable [[datamining]] from other sources (PreBIND); to create a platform capable of presenting visualizations of complex molecular interactions. From the beginning, BIND has been [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] and software can
