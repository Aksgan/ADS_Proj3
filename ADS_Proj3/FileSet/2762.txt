starts by pointing out that Whitaker "virtually equates mental illness with schizophrenia; depression and other psychiatric disorders are mentioned only parenthetically." Van Gijn summarizes the pre-1950 coverage of the book without much commentary, but then criticizes the rest of the book. Specifically, he questions Whitaker's assertion that Kraepelin's schizophrenia patients in fact suffered from [[encephalitis lethargica]]. With regard to antipsychotic medication, van Gijn notes that "Although there may be truth in the notion that dosages of antipsychotic drugs in the United States are higher than necessary, the author weakens his position by issuing continuous and unrelenting condemnations (for instance, “The [[Nuremberg Code]] doesn't apply here”), despite a dearth of evidence to support them." Van Gijn then describes Whitaker's attack on the [[dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia]] as "simplistic reasoning," and concludes that "Although [Whitaker] is widely read on the subject, the facts are largely arranged to suit his prejudice, especially in the chapters on drug treatment. American psychiatric institutions may have their failings in the current management of patients with schizophrenia, but they deserve better critics."<ref>{{cite doi|10.1056/NEJM200206273462620}}</ref> In a rejoinder to Goldman's review, physician Nathaniel S. Lehrman disagrees with Goldman, and writes that "Whitaker is right," and goes on to agree with the main points in the book, namely that [[antipsychotic]] drugs cause [[brain damage]], that despite "psychiatrically produced misconceptions," they "do not fix any known brain abnormality nor do they put brain chemistry back into balance. What they do is alter brain functions in a manner that diminishes certain characteristic symptoms." Lehrman then writes that all the data accumulated on the neurobiology of schizophrenia "has hardly helped patient care."<ref>{{cite news|author=Lehrman, Nathaniel S., MD|title=Reply to Dr. Larry S.

For problems with multiple input variables and one output, each input is applied to one Adaline. For similar problems with multiple outputs, madalines in parallel can be used. The madaline network is useful for problems which involve prediction based on multiple inputs, such as weather forecasting (Input variables: barometric pressure, difference in pressure. Output variables: rain, cloudy, sunny). '' A MADALINE (many Adaline) network is created by combining a number of Adalines. The network of ADALINES can span many layers. The use of Multiple Adalines help counter the problem of non linear separability. For example, the MADALINE network with two units exhibits the capability to solve the XOR problem. == References == * [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/763/907/00023872.pdf Paper co-authored by Widrow about MII] [[Category:Neural networks]] {{compsci-stub}} [[uk:Madaline]]</text> </page> <page> <id>23219</id> <title>Madonna (album)</title> <text>{{italic title}} {{Infobox album | <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Albums --> | Name = Madonna | Type = [[Album]] | Artist = [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] | Cover = MadonnaTheFirstAlbum1983AlbumCover.jpg | Border = yes | Alt = Sepia image of a young blond female.
