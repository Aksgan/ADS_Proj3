claims and threats against many of the major names in the computer industry, including [[IBM]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Microsoft]], [[Novell]], [[Silicon Graphics]], [[Sun Microsystems]] and [[Red Hat]]. By mid [[2004]], five major lawsuits had been filed * ''[[SCO v. IBM]]'' * ''[[Red Hat v. SCO]]'' * ''[[SCO v. Novell]]'' (not directly related to Linux, the suit has more to do with Unix copyrights) * ''[[SCO v. DaimlerChrysler]]'' * ''[[SCO-Linux controversies#SCO v. AutoZone|SCO v. AutoZone]]'' In cases SCO publicly implied that a number of other parties have committed copyright infringement, including not only Linux developers but also Linux users. ===UNIX SVRx=== SCO's claims are derived from several contracts that may have transferred UNIX System V Release 4 intellectual property assets. The UNIX IP rights originated with [[Unix System Laboratories]] (USL), a division of [[AT&T]]. In 1993, USL sold all UNIX rights and assets to [[Novell]], including copyrights, trademarks, and active licensing contracts. Some of these rights and assets, plus additional assets derived from Novell's development work, were then sold to the [[Santa Cruz Operation]] in [[1995]]. The Santa Cruz Operation had developed and was selling a PC-based UNIX until 2000, when it then resold its UNIX assets to Caldera, which later changed its name to [[SCO Group]]. Through this chain of sales, SCO claims to be the "owner of UNIX". The validity of these claims is hotly contested by others. SCO claims copyright to all UNIX code developed by USL, referred to as [[UNIX System V|SVRx]], and licensing contracts originating with AT&T, saying that these are inherited through the same chain of sales. The primary document SCO presents as evidence of these claims is the "Asset Purchase Agreement",<ref>[http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/SCONovellAssetAg.pdf in the original] or [http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=2003111023050367&query=asset+purchase+agreement transcribed]</ref> defining the sale between Novell and the Santa Cruz Operation. SCO says that this includes all copyrights to the UNIX code base and contractual rights to the licensing base. The other parties disagree. ====UNIX copyrights ownership==== The status of copyrights from USL is murky, since UNIX code is a compilation of elements with different copyright histories. Some code was released without copyright notice before the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] made copyright automatic. This code may be in the [[public domain]] and not subject to copyright claims. Other code is affected by the ''[[USL v. BSDi]]'' case, and is covered by the [[BSD License]]. [[Groklaw]] uncovered an old settlement made between Unix System Laboratories (USL) and The University of California in the case of [[USL v. BSDi]].<ref>[http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/USLsettlement.pdf The full settlement available from Groklaw's website]</ref> This settlement ended a copyright infringement suit against the University for making [[BSD]] [[source code]] freely available that USL felt infringed their copyrights. The university filed a counter suit, saying that USL had taken BSD source code and put it in UNIX without properly acknowledging the university's copyright. This settlement muddies the question of SCO's ownership of major parts of the UNIX source code. This uncertainty is particularly significant in regard to SCO's claims against Linux, which uses some BSD code. Novell challenges SCO's interpretation of the purchase agreement. In response to a letter SCO sent to 1500 companies on May 12, 2003,<ref>[http://www.novell.com/licensing/indemnity/pdf/5_12_03_sco-n.pdf May 12, 2003 letter to Novell Chairman and CEO Jack Messman] hosted by Novell.</ref> Novell exchanged a series of letters<ref>[http://www.novell.com/licensing/indemnity/legal.html Novell's Unique Legal Rights<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> with SCO beginning in May 2003, claiming that the copyrights for the core UNIX System V were not included in the asset purchase agreement and are retained by Novell. In October 2003, Novell registered those copyrights with the US Copyright Office. In response to these challenges from Novell, SCO filed a "[[slander of title]]" suit against Novell, ''[[SCO v. Novell]]''. This claimed that Novell was interfering with their business activities by clouding the ownership of UNIX copyrights. SCO's claim for special damages was dismissed on June 9, 2004 for "failure to specifically plead special damages."<ref>[http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/Novell-29.pdf Judge Kimbal's Order available from Groklaw's website]</ref> However, SCO was given 30 days "to amend its complaint to more specifically plead special damages". In the same ruling, the judge expressed doubt that the Asset Purchase Agreement transferred the relevant copyrights.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} SCO filed an amended complaint. In late July, 2005, Novell filed an answer to SCO's complaint, denying all of its accusations. Novell also filed its own Slander of Title counter-lawsuit against SCO. Novell has also filed claims for numerous breaches of the APA (Asset Purchase Agreement) between Novell and the [[Santa Cruz Operation]]. Under the APA, Santa Cruz (and later SCO after SCO purchased Santa Cruz Operation's Unix Business) was given the right to market and sell Unixware as a product, retaining 100% of all revenues. Santa Cruz Operation (and later SCO) also was given the responsibility of administering Unix SVR4 license agreements on behalf of Novell. When money was paid for licensing, SCO was to turn over 100% of the revenue to Novell, and then Novell would return 5% as an Administration Fee. Novell claims that SCO signed Unix SVR4 licensing agreements with Microsoft and Sun Microsystems, as well as with numerous Linux End Users for Unix IP allegedly in the Linux Kernel, and then refused to turn the money over to Novell. Novell is suing for 100% of the revenue, claiming SCO is not entitled to the 5% administration fee since they breached their contract with Novell. Novell's counterclaims proposed asking the court to put appropriate funds from SCO into escrow until the case is resolved, since SCO's cash is diminishing quickly. Novell also retained the right to audit SCO's Unix Licensing Business under the APA. Novell claims that SCO has not turned over vital information about the Microsoft, Sun and Linux End User License Agreements, despite repeated demands by Novell for them to do so. Novell, in another claim that is part of their counter suit, is asking the court to compel SCO to allow Novell to perform this audit of SCO's Unix Business. On August 10, 2007 Judge Dale Kimball, hearing the SCO v. Novell case, ruled that "...the court concludes that Novell is
