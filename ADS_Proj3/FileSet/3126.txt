The Navier–Stokes equations result from the following assumptions on the deviatoric stress tensor <math>\scriptstyle \mathbb{T}</math>:<ref name=Batchelor_142_148>Batchelor (1967) pp. 142–148.</ref> *the deviatoric stress vanishes for a fluid at rest, and – by [[Galilean invariance]] – also does not depend directly on the flow velocity itself, but only on spatial derivatives of the flow velocity *in the Navier–Stokes equations, the deviatoric stress is expressed as the product of the tensor gradient <math>\scriptstyle \nabla\mathbf{v}</math> of the flow velocity with a viscosity tensor <math>\scriptstyle \mathbb{A}</math>, i.e. : <math>\mathbb{T} = \mathbb{A} \left( \nabla\mathbf{v} \right)</math> *the fluid is assumed to be [[isotropic]], as valid for gases and simple liquids, and consequently <math>\scriptstyle \mathbb{A}</math> is an isotropic tensor; furthermore, since the deviatoric stress tensor is symmetric, it turns out that it can be expressed in terms of two scalar [[dynamic viscosity|dynamic viscosities]] ''μ'' and ''μ''”: <math>\mathbb{T} = 2 \mu \mathbb{E} + \mu'' \Delta \mathbb{I},</math> where <math>\mathbb{E}=\tfrac12 \left( \nabla\mathbf{v} \right) + \tfrac12 \left( \nabla\mathbf{v} \right)^\text{T}</math> is the rate-of-strain tensor and <math>\Delta = \nabla\cdot\mathbf{v}</math> is the rate of expansion of the flow *the deviatoric stress tensor has zero [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]], so for a three-dimensional flow 2''μ'' + 3''μ''” = 0 As a result, in the Navier–Stokes equations the deviatoric stress tensor has the following form:<ref name=Batchelor_142_148/> :<math>\mathbb{T} = 2 \mu \left( \mathbb{E} - \tfrac13 \Delta \mathbb{I} \right),</math> with the quantity between brackets the non-isotropic part of the rate-of-strain tensor <math>\scriptstyle \mathbb{E}.</math> The dynamic viscosity ''μ'' does not need to be constant – in general it depends on conditions like temperature and pressure, and in [[turbulence]] modelling the concept of [[eddy viscosity]] is used to approximate the average deviatoric stress. The pressure ''p'' is modelled by use of an [[equation of state]].<ref>Batchelor (1967) p. 165.</ref> For the special case of an incompressible flow, the pressure constrains the flow in such a way that the volume of [[fluid element]]s is constant: [[isochoric process|isochoric flow]] resulting in a [[solenoidal]] velocity field with <math>\scriptstyle \nabla\cdot\mathbf{v}=0.</math><ref>Batchelor (1967) p. 75.</ref> ===Other forces=== The vector field <math>\scriptstyle \mathbf{f}</math> represents [[body force]]s. Typically these consist of only [[gravity]] forces, but may include other types(such as electromagnetic forces). In a non-inertial coordinate system, other "forces" such as that associated with [[Fictitious force|rotating coordinates]] may be inserted. Often, these forces may be represented as the gradient of some scalar quantity. Gravity in the ''z'' direction, for example, is the gradient of <math>-\rho g z</math>. Since pressure shows up only as a gradient, this implies that solving a problem without any such body force can be mended to include the body force by modifying pressure. ===Other equations=== The Navier–Stokes equations are strictly a statement of the conservation of momentum. In order to fully describe fluid flow, more information is needed (how much depends on the assumptions made), this may include boundary data ([[no-slip condition|no-slip]], [[capillary surface]], etc.), the conservation of mass, the conservation of energy, and/or an [[equation of state]]. Regardless of the flow assumptions, a statement of the [[conservation of mass]] is generally necessary. This is achieved through the mass [[continuity equation]], given in its most general form as: :<math>\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) = 0</math> or, using the [[substantive derivative]]: :<math>\frac{D\rho}{Dt} + \rho (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v}) = 0.</math> ==Incompressible flow of Newtonian fluids== A simplification of the resulting flow equations is obtained when considering an [[incompressible flow]] of a [[Newtonian fluid]]. The assumption of incompressibility rules out the possibility of [[sound]] or [[shock wave]]s to occur; so this simplification is invalid if these phenomena are important. The incompressible flow assumption typically holds well even when dealing with a "compressible" fluid — such as air at room temperature — at low [[Mach number]]s (even when flowing up to about Mach 0.3). Taking the incompressible flow assumption into account and assuming constant viscosity, the Navier–Stokes equations will read, in vector form:<ref name="Ach">See Acheson (1990).</ref> :<math>\rho \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v}\right) = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{f}.</math> Here '''f''' represents "other" [[body force]]s (forces per unit volume), such as [[gravity]] or [[centrifugal force]]. The [[shear stress]] term <math>\scriptstyle \nabla \mathbb{T}</math> becomes the useful quantity <math>\scriptstyle \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v}</math> (<math>\scriptstyle \nabla^2</math> is the [[vector Laplacian]]) when the fluid is assumed incompressible, homogeneous and Newtonian, where <math>\scriptstyle \mu</math> is the (constant) dynamic viscosity.<ref>Batchelor (1967) pp. 21 & 147.</ref> It's well worth observing the meaning of each term (compare to the [[Cauchy momentum equation]]): :<math> \overbrace{\rho \Big( \underbrace{\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t}}_{ \begin{smallmatrix} \text{Unsteady}\\ \text{acceleration} \end{smallmatrix}} + \underbrace{\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v}}_{ \begin{smallmatrix} \text{Convective} \\ \text{acceleration} \end{smallmatrix}}\Big)}^{\text{Inertia (per volume)}} = \overbrace{\underbrace{-\nabla p}_{ \begin{smallmatrix} \text{Pressure} \\ \text{gradient} \end{smallmatrix}} + \underbrace{\mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v}}_{\text{Viscosity}}}^{\text{Divergence of stress}} + \underbrace{\mathbf{f}}_{ \begin{smallmatrix} \text{Other} \\ \text{body} \\ \text{forces} \end{smallmatrix}}. </math> Note that only the convective terms are nonlinear for incompressible Newtonian flow. The convective acceleration is an acceleration caused by a (possibly steady) change in velocity over ''position'', for example the speeding up of fluid entering a converging [[nozzle]]. Though individual fluid particles are being accelerated and thus are under unsteady motion, the flow field (a velocity distribution) will not necessarily be time dependent. Another important observation is that the viscosity is represented by the [[vector Laplacian]] of the velocity field (interpreted here as the difference between the velocity at a point and the mean velocity in a small volume around). This implies that Newtonian viscosity is '''diffusion of momentum''', this works in much the same way as the [[diffusion]] of heat seen in the [[heat equation]] (which also involves the Laplacian). If temperature effects are also neglected, the only "other" equation (apart from
