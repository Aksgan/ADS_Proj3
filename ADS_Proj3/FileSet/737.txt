Fictional cloaking devices have been used as [[plot device]]s in various media for many years, but developments in scientific research show that real-world cloaking devices can obscure objects from at least one [[wavelength]] of EM emissions. Scientists already use artificial materials called [[metamaterial]]s to bend light around an object.<ref>Issue 3(on sale through August 2008) of Discovery Channel Magazine, section Going Where No One Has Gone Before, Gary Sledge, Discovery Channel Magazine Issue 3, ISSN 1793572-5</ref> ==Conceptual origins== Cloaking devices were first introduced and used by the [[Romulan]]s in [[Star Trek: The Original Series|the original ''Star Trek'']] episode "[[Balance of Terror]]", where it was used as an analog for a submarine diving (the episode was partly inspired by the film ''[[Run Silent, Run Deep]]''). During a later episode, "[[The Enterprise Incident]]", the term "cloaking device" was first coined by writer [[D.C. Fontana]]. Cloaking devices have also been used in many other science-fiction settings and games, including <!-- Please don't add more pop culture examples of cloaking devices. This article is about the real-world development, not a crufty list of every game they've ever appeared in! Just because another article links here doesn't mean a link to that article must exist. -->[[Doctor Who]], [[Star Wars]], [[Stargate]], [[Predator (film)|Predator]], [[Halo: Combat Evolved]], [[Metal Gear Solid]], and [[StarCraft]]. When cloaking devices are used in games, they typically come with a drawback for balance, such as requiring a limited energy source to power them, or failing when the player initiates an attack while cloaked. ==Scientific experimentation== An operational, [[non-fiction]]al cloaking device might be an extension of the basic technologies used by stealth aircraft, such as radar-absorbing dark paint, optical camouflage, cooling the outer surface to minimize electromagnetic emissions (usually [[infrared]]), or other techniques to minimize other EM emissions, and to minimize particle emissions from the object. The use of certain devices to jam and confuse remote sensing devices would greatly aid in this process, but are more properly referred to as "[[active camouflage]]". Alternatively, metamaterials provide the theoretical possibility of making electromagnetic radiation appear to pass freely through the 'cloaked' object.<ref>{{cite journal|author= Robert F. Service and Adrian Cho |title= Strange New Tricks With Light |journal=Science|pages= 1622 |volume= 330 |date= 17 December 2010}}</ref> ===Metamaterial research=== {{main|Metamaterial cloaking}} Optical [[metamaterial]]s have featured in several recent proposals for invisibility schemes. "Metamaterials" refers to materials that owe their refractive properties to the way they are structured, rather than the substances that compose them. Using [[transformation optics]] it is possible to design the optical parameters of a "cloak" so that it guides light around some region, rendering it invisible over a certain band of wavelengths. These spatially varying optical parameters do not correspond to any natural material, but may be implemented using [[metamaterials]]. There several [[theories of cloaking]], giving rise to different types of invisibility. ===Active camouflage=== {{main|Active camouflage}} '''[[Active camouflage]]''' (or '''adaptive camouflage''') is a group of [[camouflage]] technologies which would allow an object (usually [[military]] in nature) to blend into its surroundings by use of panels or coatings capable of changing color or luminosity. Active camouflage can be seen as having the potential to become the perfection of the art of camouflaging things from visual detection. '''Optical camouflage''' is a kind of active camouflage in which one wears a fabric which has an image of the scene directly behind the wearer projected onto it, so that the wearer appears invisible. The drawback to this system is that, when the cloaked wearer moves, a visible distortion is often generated as the 'fabric' catches up with the object's motion. The concept exists for now only in theory and in proof-of-concept prototypes, although many experts consider it technically feasible. It has been reported that the British Army has tested an invisible tank.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-490669/Army-tests-James-Bond-style-tank-invisible.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Army tests James Bond style tank that is 'invisible' | date=2007-10-30}}</ref><ref>[http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7008995661]</ref> ===Plasma stealth=== {{Main|Plasma stealth}} [[plasma (physics)|Plasma]] at certain density ranges absorbs certain bandwidths of broadband waves, potentially rendering an object invisible.
