The equivalent office in [[Scotland]] is the ''[[Registers of Scotland]]''. ==Purpose== Like [[land registration]] organisations in other countries, the Land Registry guarantees [[Title (property)|title]] to registered estates and interests in land. It records the ownership rights of [[Freehold (English law)|freehold]] properties, and [[leasehold]] properties where the lease has been granted for a term exceeding seven years. The definition of land can include the buildings situated upon the land, particularly where parts of buildings at different levels (such as flats) are in different ownership. It is also possible to register the ownership of the mines and minerals which lie within the ground as well as airspace above property where this is in separate ownership. The Land Registry receives no government funding, being required to ensure that its income covers expenditure, and finances itself from registration and search fees. It provides online access to its database of ''titles'' (ownership and ''charges'' or interests by other parties) and most ''plans'' (maps). The Land Registry is currently encouraging property owners whose property is not registered to make voluntary applications for registration. Although there are over 20,000,000 registered properties in England and Wales, only just over half of the land mass is registered. Much of this land is rural property in the hands of large institutional landowners such as the Church of England, educational institutions and the Crown. Registration of land under the [[Land Registration Act 2002]] affords property owners some protection against squatters as well as avoiding the need to produce old documents each time a property changes hands. ==Offices== There are 24 Land Registry offices throughout [[England]] and [[Wales]]. They are responsible for the registration of land transactions, alongside the head office in [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]], [[London]], the Information Systems department in [[Plymouth]] and the Land Charges department attached to the Plymouth office. The 24 offices, each responsible for a distinct geographical area, are at [[Birkenhead]], [[Coventry]], [[Croydon]], [[Durham]], [[Fylde]], [[Gloucester]], [[Kingston upon Hull]], [[Leicester]], [[Nottingham]], [[Peterborough]], [[Plymouth]], [[Portsmouth]], [[Stevenage]], [[Swansea]] (covering all of [[Wales]]), [[Telford]], [[Tunbridge Wells]], [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]] and [[York]]. In 2006, as a result of a review of office accommodation, the Land Registry announced the closure of several offices. In each of the five towns or cities where there are two offices at present, those offices have or will [[merge]]. The Harrow office is held under a lease that expires in 2010, and the York office's lease expires in [[2015]]: these leases will not be renewed. All affected staff are being encouraged to transfer to an alternative office. A further urgent review of staffing levels and overall office space (described as the Accelerated Transformation Programme) began in 2009. The economic recession, and the resultant slump in the property and mortgage markets, meant that the Land Registry's basic work in connection with simple remortgages and straightforward house sales dried up to the point where it made a financial loss for the first time in its history. The Land Registry's Board of Directors announced proposals to close five offices, namely those at Portsmouth, Tunbridge Wells, Croydon, Stevenage and Peterborough. The closures were planned to take place in two stages, beginning in February [[2011]], and will run alongside other measures that could mean the loss of over 2,000 jobs.<ref>[http://www1.landregistry.gov.uk/assets/library/documents/ATP_Consultation_Doc_V1.0_221009_Issued.pdf] Land Registry 'Accelerated Transformation Programme' Consultation Document.</ref> The consultation process required by the office closure programme resulted in some changes between the original proposal and the final course of action. The offices in Croydon and Peterborough are to remain, while the closure of Tunbridge Wells and Stevenage will continue as planned, albeit brought forward to June 2011. The current office in Portsmouth ''will'' close in
