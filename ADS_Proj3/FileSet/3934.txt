the rim, on the upper part of the seal will be the words 'City of Portland, Oregon.' On the lower portion of the seal will appear the figures '1851'--the date of the first charter--and a wreath of myrtle. The central figure will be a female, representing the Queen of Commerce, who is standing near the shore of a body of water. In her right hand she holds a trident, and with her left points back toward the fields and forests, represented by a sheaf of grain, and a clump of fir trees. Mount Hood appears beyond the forest in the far-off distance. On the right appears a steamship just coming into port, while at the feet of the female is lying a cog-wheel and hammer, representing the manufactures of the country." Portland's landmark statue ''[[Portlandia]]'' is based on the figure of Commerce in the seal. ==See also== *[[Flag of Portland, Oregon]] ==External links== *[http://www.portlandonline.com/auditor/index.cfm?a=jbha&c=cheid City Seal] (history and description, from PortlandOnline.com) {{heraldry-stub}} [[Category:Portland, Oregon]] [[Category:Seals (insignia)|Portland, Oregon, Seal of]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33512</id> <title>Seal of the Vice President of the Philippines</title> <text>{{Infobox coat of arms | name = Seal of the Vice President of the Philippines | image = VPSealPhil.png | image_width = 200 | middle = | middle_width = | middle_caption = | lesser = | lesser_width = | lesser_caption = | image2 = | image2_width = | image2_caption = | armiger = [[Vice President of the Philippines]] | year_adopted = 1947 (current definition from 2004) | crest = | torse = | shield = A circular white shield with an eight-rayed golden-yellow Philippine sun at the center.

Its design was prescribed by [http://www.ops.gov.ph/records/eo_no310.htm Executive Order No. 310 of 2004], and is similar in design to the [[Seal of the President of the Philippines]]. ==Description and Symbolism== The seal is composed of the coat-of-arms of the Vice President, which, according to [http://www.ops.gov.ph/records/eo_no310.htm Executive Order No. 310 of 2004] consists of: {{cquote|A circular white shield with an eight-rayed golden-yellow Philippine sun at the center.

The upper [[Arc (geometry)|arc]] of the white circle contains the words <small>SAGISAG NG PANGALAWANG PANGULO NG PILIPINAS</SMALL> ("Seal of the Vice President of the Philippines") in white letters. The bottom of the outer rim is marked with one five-pointed white star. ==History== The seal was first designed in 1947 via Executive Order No. 38 signed by President [[Manuel Roxas]], in which the presidential flag and seal was created. It indicated that the vice presidential coat of arms will follow the pattern of the presidential coat of arms, except that the sun and sealion will be blue to create a distinction compared to the latter <ref name="mlq3">[http://www.quezon.ph/2005/05/29/executive-order-no-310/ Executive Order No. 310], Manuel L. Quezon III</ref>. After President [[Elpidio Quirino]] amended Roxas' order, he changed the design of the coat of arms, and ordered that it will be identical to the president's, but without the ring of stars <ref name="mlq3"/>. This version of the coat of arms and seal was used until the position of vice president was abolished by martial law in 1972 and its subsequent non-inclusion in the original text of the 1973 Constitution. After the position was restored in 1986, a literal reading of Quirino's order caused confusion on what the design of the vice presidential coat of arms and seal should be.<ref name="mlq3"/> Thus, the government adopted the seal with a similar design compared to the president's with a blue background but no amulet of stars and it is surrounded by text contains the words <small>SEAL OF THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINES</SMALL>. To remove the confusion and to create a distinction between the presidential and vice presidential coat of arms and seal, President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] signed Executive Order 310 of 2004, defining the design of both position's coat of arms, seal and flag. == Evolution of the Vice Presidential Seal == <center> <gallery> File:VPSealPhil 1980s.png|The design of the seal when the position was restored in 1986.
