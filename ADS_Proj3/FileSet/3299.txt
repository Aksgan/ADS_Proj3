Due to the strong relationship to [[informatics (academic field)|informatics]] this program belongs more to the category [[cheminformatics]] than to [[molecular modelling]]. It is available for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Unix]], and [[Mac OS]]. It is distributed under the [[GNU GPL]]. The project's stated goal is: "Open Babel is a community-driven scientific project assisting both users and developers as a cross-platform program and library designed to support molecular modeling, chemistry, and many related areas, including interconversion of file formats and data." ==History== OpenBabel and [[JOELib]] were derived from the [[OELib]] [[Cheminformatics]] library. In turn, [[OELib]] was based on ideas in the original chemistry program Babel and an unreleased [[object-oriented]] library called "OBabel." ==Major features== * chemical expert system * interconversion of many [[chemical file format]]s * substructure search (based on [[Simplified molecular input line entry specification|SMARTS]]) * fingerprint calculation * wrappers for [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Perl]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]/[[Mono (software)|Mono]]<ref>http://openbabel.org/</ref> ==See also== {{Portal|Free software}} * [[Avogadro (software)|Avogadro]] - molecular builder and editor based on OpenBabel * [[Ghemical]] - [[molecular mechanics]] program based on OpenBabel * [[JOELib]] - Java version of OpenBabel/[[OELib]] * [[XDrawChem]] - 2D drawing program based on OpenBabel * [[List of software for molecular mechanics modeling|Software for molecular modeling]] * [[Blue Obelisk]] ==Notes== {{Reflist|2}} ==References== * ''The Blue Obelisk-Interoperability in Chemical Informatics'', Rajarshi Guha, Michael T.

The OpenCard Framework was originally defined by the OpenCard Consortium, but mainly driven by IBM and Gemplus. The work ended with version 1.2 of the specification and a reference implementation by IBM. The consortium split up and left the OpenCard Framework in a dormant state. The website was still available until 2007 and is now shut down. The original code was transferred the a project on SourceForge, but never actively maintained. == Architecture == * ''CardTerminals'' are smart card reader [[Device driver |drivers]]. They can be native ([[Shared object|.so]], [[Dynamic library|.dll]]) using [[Java Native Interface|JNI]] or they can use the javax.comm or gnu.io API. The distribution provides a bridge with [[PC/SC]] drivers. * ''CardServices'' are high-level interfaces to the applications hiding the [[ISO/IEC 7816]]-3 and -4 complexity. Available CardServices are : PassThruCardService, MFCFileAccess, BasicEMVAppletAccess, VOPCardService, ... == Books == * Uwe Hansmann, Martin S.
