It is designed to protect data by providing [[encryption]] for entire [[Volume (computing)|volume]]s. By default it uses the [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] encryption algorithm in [[Block cipher modes of operation#Cipher-block_chaining_.28CBC.29|CBC]] mode with a 128 bit key, combined with the ''Elephant'' diffuser for additional disk encryption specific security not provided by AES.<ref name="FAQ">{{cite web |url = http://technet2.microsoft.com/WindowsVista/en/library/58358421-a7f5-4c97-ab41-2bcc61a58a701033.mspx#BKMK_Form |title = Windows BitLocker Drive Encryption Frequently Asked Questions |publisher = Microsoft |accessdate = 2007-09-05 }}</ref><ref>{{cite paper|author=Niels Fergusson|title=AES-CBC + Elephant Diffuser: A Disk Encryption Algorithm for Windows Vista|accessdate=2008-02-22|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|date=August 2006|url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/2/3/0238acaf-d3bf-4a6d-b3d6-0a0be4bbb36e/BitLockerCipher200608.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> BitLocker is available only in the Enterprise and Ultimate editions of Windows Vista and Windows 7.<ref name="FAQ">{{cite web | url = http://technet2.microsoft.com/WindowsVista/en/library/58358421-a7f5-4c97-ab41-2bcc61a58a701033.mspx#BKMK_Vista | title = Windows BitLocker Drive Encryption Frequently Asked Questions | accessdate = 2007-09-05 | publisher = Microsoft }}</ref> Users of other versions of Windows that don't include BitLocker could use a 3rd party encryption program to satisfy the need for full drive encryption (see [[Comparison of disk encryption software]]). In the [[Software_release_life_cycle#RTM|RTM]] release of Windows Vista, only the operating system volume could be encrypted using the GUI and encrypting other volumes required using [[Windows Management Instrumentation|WMI]]-based scripts included in Windows Vista in the <tt>%Windir%\System32</tt> folder. <ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|date=2008-02-19|accessdate=2008-02-22|title=Bitlocker Drive Encryption Provider|url=http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa376409(VS.85).aspx}}</ref> An example of how to use the WMI interface is in the script <tt>manage-bde.wsf</tt>, that can be used to set up and manage BitLocker from the command line.

The key used for the disk encryption is sealed (encrypted) by the TPM chip and will only be released to the OS loader code if the early boot files appear to be unmodified. The pre-OS components of BitLocker achieve this by implementing a Static Root of Trust Measurement—a methodology specified by the [[Trusted Computing Group]]. This mode is vulnerable to a [[cold boot attack]], as it allows a powered-down machine to be [[booting|booted]] by an attacker. *'''User authentication mode''': This mode requires that the user provide some authentication to the pre-boot environment in the form of a pre-boot [[Personal identification number|PIN]]. This mode is vulnerable to a [[bootkit]] attack. *'''USB Key Mode''': The user must insert a USB device that contains a startup key into the computer to be able to boot the protected OS. Note that this mode requires that the BIOS on the protected machine supports the reading of USB devices in the pre-OS environment. This mode is also vulnerable to a bootkit attack.

A volume may or may not be an entire [[hard disk drive|drive]], and can span one or more physical drives. Also, when enabled TPM/Bitlocker can ensure the integrity of the trusted boot path (e.g. BIOS, boot sector, etc.), in order to prevent most offline physical attacks, boot sector malware, etc. In order for BitLocker to operate, the hard disk requires at least two [[NTFS]]-formatted [[volume (computing)|volumes]]: one for the [[operating system]] (usually C:) and another with a minimum size of 100MB from which the operating system [[booting|boots]]. BitLocker requires the [[bootstrapping (computing)|boot]] volume to remain unencrypted—on Windows Vista this volume must be assigned a drive letter, while on Windows 7 it does not. Unlike previous versions of Windows, Vista's "diskpart" command-line tool includes the ability to shrink the size of an NTFS volume so that the system volume for BitLocker can be created from already-allocated space. A tool called the "Bitlocker Drive Preparation Tool" is also available from Microsoft that allows an existing volume on Windows Vista to be shrunk to make room for a new boot volume, and for the necessary [[Bootstrapping (computing)|bootstrapping]] files to be transferred to it;<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|title=Description of the BitLocker Drive Preparation Tool|date=2007-09-07|accessdate=2008-02-22|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/930063}}</ref> Windows 7 creates the secondary boot volume by default, even if Bitlocker is not used initially. Once an alternate boot partition has been created, the TPM module needs to be initialized (assuming that this feature is being used), after which the required disk encryption key protection mechanisms such as TPM, PIN or USB
