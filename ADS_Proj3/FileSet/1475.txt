Ferranti Computer Department in [[Gorton|West Gorton]] [[Manchester]] had originally been set up as an industrial partner of [[Manchester University]]'s pioneering computer research lab, commercializing their [[Manchester Mark 1]] and several follow-on designs. During the 1950s, under the direction of Brian Pollard, the Gorton labs also researched magnetic amplifiers. Like most teams, they decided to abandon them when transistors improved.<ref name=s/> One member of the lab, Ken Johnson, proposed a new type of transistor-based logic that followed the same conventions as the magnetic amplifiers, namely that binary logic was based on known currents instead of voltages.<ref name=s/> Like the magnetic amplifiers, Johnson's "Neuron" design could be used to control several different inputs. Better yet, the system often required only one transistor per logic element, whereas conventional voltage-based logic would require two or more.<ref name=s/> Although transistors were falling in price they were still expensive, so a Neuron based machine might offer similar performance at a much lower price than a machine based on traditional transistor logic. The team decided to test the Neuron design by building a small machine known as "Newt",<ref name=h>Hall</ref> short for "Neuron test". This machine was so successful that the lab decided to expand the testbed into a complete computer. The result was the [[Ferranti Sirius|Sirius]], which was announced on 19 May 1959 with claims that it was the smallest and most economically priced computer in the European market.<ref>Barbara Ainsworth, [http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/CCS/res/res44.htm#f "The Ferranti Sirius at Monash University"], ''Computer Resurrection'', Number 44 (Autumn 2008)</ref> Several sales followed. ====Orion 1==== With the success of Sirius, the team turned its attention to a much larger design. Since many of the costs of a complete computer system are fixed - power supplies, printers, etc. - a more complex computer with more internal circuitry would have more of its cost associated with the circuits themselves. For this reason, a larger machine made of Neurons would have an increased price advantage over transistorized offerings. Pollard decided that such a machine would be a strong counterpart to the high-end [[Atlas Computer (Manchester)|Atlas]], and would form the basis for Ferranti's sales for the next five years. Looking for a launch customer, Ferranti signed up [[Prudential plc|Prudential Assurance]] with the promise to deliver the machine in 1960. However, these plans quickly went awry. The Neuron proved unable to be adapted to the larger physical size of the Orion. Keeping the current levels steady over the longer wire runs was extremely difficult, and efforts to cure the problems resulted in lengthy delays.<ref name=s/> The first Orion was eventually delivered, but was over a year late and unit cost was more than expected, limiting its sales. Between 1962 and 1964 the Computing Division lost $7.5 million, largely as a result of the Orion.<ref name=v254>Ball & Vardalas, [http://books.google.com/books?id=CrzgS5SoMzcC&pg=PA254&lpg=PA254 pg. 254]</ref> ====Orion 2==== During the Orion's gestation it appeared there was a real possibility the new system might not work at all. Engineers at other Ferranti departments, notably the former Lily Hill House in [[Bracknell]], started raising increasingly vocal concerns about the effort.<ref name=h/> Several members from Bracknell approached Gordon Scarrott and tried to convince him that Orion should be developed using an all-transistor design. They recommended using the "Griblons" circuits developed by Maurice Gribble at Ferranti's [[Wythenshawe]] plant, which they had used to successfully implement their [[Ferranti Argus|Argus]] computer for the [[Bristol Bloodhound]] missile system.<ref name-g>Gribble</ref> Their efforts failed, they turned to Pollard to overrule Scarrott, which led to a series of increasingly acrimonious exchanges. After their last attempt on 5 November 1958, they decided to go directly to [[Sebastian de Ferranti]], but this effort also failed. Pollard resigned about a month later and his position was taken over by Peter Hall. Braunholtz later expressed his frustration that they didn't write to him directly, and the matter sat for several years while Orion continued to run into delays. In September 1961 Prudential was threatening to cancel their order, and by chance, Braunholtz at that moment sent a [[telegram]] to Hall expressing his continuing concerns. Hall immediately invited Braunholtz to talk about his ideas, and several days later the Bracknell team was working full out on what would become the Orion 2. By the end of October the basic design was complete, and the team started looking for a transistor logic design to use for implementation. Although Braunholtz had suggested using the Griblons, the Bracknell group also invited a team of engineers from [[Ferranti-Packard|Ferranti Canada]] to discuss their recent successes with their "Gemini" design, which was used in their [[ReserVec]] system. On November 2 the Bracknell team decided to adopt the Gemini circuitry for Orion 2.<ref name=g>See "SOME KEY DATES", ''Group''</ref><ref>Maurice Gribble claims that his design was used for the basis of both the Orion 2 and the FP-6000. However, Ball and Vardalas state that the design was Canadian and quote one of the engineers to that end.([http://books.google.com/books?id=CrzgS5SoMzcC&pg=PA254 pg. 254])</ref> Parts arrived from many Ferranti divisions over the next year, and the machine was officially switched on by Peter Hunt on 7 January 1963.<ref name=g/> The first Orion 2 was delivered to [[Prudential plc|Prudential]] on 1 December 1964, running at about five times the speed of the Orion 1. Prudential bought a second machine for the processing of industrial branch policies. Another system was sold to the South African Mutual Life Assurance Society in Cape Town where it was used for updating insurance policies. A fourth was sold to Beecham Group to upgrade its Orion 1 system.<ref name=sys>''System''</ref> The original prototype was kept by ICT and used for software development by the Nebula Compiler team. By this point, however, Ferranti was already well on the road to selling all of its business computing divisions to ICT. As part of their [[due diligence]] process, ICT studied both the Orion 2 and the FP-6000. Ferranti's own engineers concluded that "There are certain facets of the system we do not like. However, were we to begin designing now a machine in the same price/performance range as the FP6000, we would have in some
