a technical writer, under the pen name of Intel (1956), claimed the Biefeld–Brown effect was the primary theory tested by the aerospace firms in the 1950s, although it should be noted that "Intel" is an unreliable witness in this respect. It has remained a constant theme in the [[UFO]] field, and has recently been a topic of some discussion in this field under the name [[ionocraft|lifter]]s. There appears to be a general understanding that the lifters require a working fluid, air specifically ([[ion wind]]), and that they do not demonstrate new physics. This was demonstrated on the American television show [[Mythbusters]], when the hosts were unable to reproduce the lifting effect with the device operated inside of a vacuum chamber. ====Gravitoelectric coupling==== The Russian researcher [[Eugene Podkletnov]] claims to have discovered experimenting with [[superconductor]]s in 1995, that a fast rotating superconductor reduces the gravitational effect. Many studies have attempted to reproduce Podkletnov's experiment, always to no results.<ref>Li, N., Noever, D., Robertson, T., Koczor, R., and Brantley, W., "Static Test for a Gravitational Force Coupled to Type II YBCO Superconductors," Physica C, 281, 260-267, (1997).</ref><ref>Woods, C., Cooke, S., Helme, J., and Caldwell, C., "Gravity Modification by High Temperature Superconductors," Joint Propulsion Conference, AIAA 2001-3363, (2001).</ref><ref>Hathaway, G., Cleveland, B., and Bao, Y., "Gravity Modification Experiment using a Rotating Superconducting Disc and Radio Frequency Fields," Physica C, 385, 488-500, (2003).</ref><ref>Tajmar, M., and de Matos, C.J., "Gravitomagnetic Field of a Rotating Superconductor and of a Rotating Superfluid," Physica C, 385(4), 551-554, (2003).</ref> In 1989, [[Ning Li]], of the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] theoretically demonstrated how a time dependent magnetic field could cause the spins of the lattice ions in a superconductor to generate detectable [[gravitomagnetic]] and gravitoelectric fields.

They report no indication of any effect within the measurement accuracy of the experiment. Given the conditions of the experiment, the Canterbury group conclude that if any such 'Tajmar' effect exists, it is at least 22 times smaller than predicted by Tajmar in 2006.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.ringlaser.org.nz/papers/SuperFrameDragging2007.pdf | year = 2007 | month = July | title = Experiment to Detect Frame Dragging in a Lead Superconductor | accessdate = 2007-10-19 | first1 = R.D. | last1 = Graham | first2 = R.B. | last2 = Hurst | first3 = R.J. | last3 = Thirkettle | first4 = C.H. | last4 = Rowe | first5 = P.H. | last5 = Butler }} (Submitted to Physica C)</ref> However, the last sentence of their paper states: "Our experimental results do not have the sensitivity to either confirm or refute these recent results [from 2007]".<ref>M.

While visually impressive, gravitation itself functions normally in such devices. Various alleged anti-gravity devices may in reality work by [[electromagnetism]]. *A [[tidal force]] causes objects to move along diverging paths near a massive body (such as a [[planet]] or [[star]]), producing effects that seem like repulsion or disruptive forces when observed locally. This is not anti-gravity. In Newtonian mechanics, the tidal force is the effect of the larger object's gravitational force being different at the differing locations of the diverging bodies. Equivalently, in Einsteinian gravity, the tidal force is the effect of the diverging bodies following different paths in the negatively [[curvature|curved]] spacetime around the larger body. *Large amounts of normal matter can be used to produce a gravitational field that compensates for the effects of another gravitational field, though the entire assembly will still be attracted to the source of the larger field. Physicist [[Robert Forward|Robert L. Forward]] proposed using lumps of [[degenerate matter]] to locally compensate for the tidal forces near a [[neutron star]]. *[[Ionocraft]], or sometimes referred to as "Lifters" have been claimed to defy gravity, but in fact they use accelerated ions which have been stripped from the air around them to produce thrust. The thrust produced by one of these toys is not enough to lift its own power supply. Specifically, a special type of [[electrohydrodynamic thruster]] uses the [[Biefeld–Brown effect]] to hover. *[[Muscle Pass]], magical technique. ==See also== *[[Gravitational interaction of antimatter]] *[[Gravitational induction]] *[[Artificial gravity]] *[[Burkhard Heim]] *[[Exotic matter]] *[[Heim Theory]] *[[Searl Effect Generator]] *[[Hutchison effect]] *[[Dean drive]] *The [[spindizzy]] drive in the [[science fiction]] novels of [[James Blish]] *[[Electrostatic levitation]] *[[Magnetic levitation]] *[[Casimir effect]] *[[Apergy]] *[[Viktor Grebennikov]] *[[Clinostat]] ==References== {{reflist|2}} {{refbegin}} *Cady, W.
