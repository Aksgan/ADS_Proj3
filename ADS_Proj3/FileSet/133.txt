In 1997, he went to United States to start his doctoral studies. In 2001, he received the PhD degree in Computer and Information Science from [[Temple University]] in Philadelphia. Dr Lazarevic has an experience in both academic and industrial environment. He works as a Senior Research Scientist at [http://www.utrc.utc.com United Technologies Research Center], in Connecticut and as a Research Associate at the Army High Performance Computing Research Center at [http://www.it.umn.edu/ Institute of Technology], [[University of Minnesota]].

Since early 2005, he worked as "Über Tech Lead" for [[Google]], Inc. in [[Mountain View, California]]. He holds a [[Laurea]] in [[Electrical Engineering]] from [[Bologna University]] (1980); he is the author of ''[[Python in a Nutshell]]'', co-editor of the ''[[Python Cookbook]]'', and has written other (mostly Python-related) materials. Martelli won the 2002 Activators' Choice Award, and the 2006 Frank Willison award for outstanding contributions to the [[Python (programming language)|Python]] community. Before joining Google, Martelli spent a year designing chips with [[Texas Instruments]]; 8 years with [[IBM Research]], gradually shifting from hardware to software, and winning three Outstanding Technical Achievement Awards; 12 as Senior Software Consultant at [[think3, Inc.]], developing libraries, network protocols, GUI engines, event frameworks, and web access frontends; and 3 more as a freelance consultant, working mostly for [[Open End AB]], a Python-centered software house (formerly known as [[Strakt AB]]) located in [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]]. He has taught courses on programming, development methods, [[object-oriented design]], and numerical computing, at [[University of Ferrara|Ferrara University]] and other schools. According to Martelli's self-evaluation, his proudest achievement is the articles that appeared in [[The Bridge World]] (January/February 2000), which were hailed as giant steps towards solving issues that had haunted [[Contract bridge|contract-bridge]] theoreticians for decades. Martelli was also the keynote speaker for the 2008 [[SciPy]] Conference. He is also noted for coining the phrase [[Duck typing]]. == Bibliography == * {{cite book | last=Martelli | first=Alex | title=Python in a Nutshell | publisher=O'Reilly Media | month=July | year=2006 | isbn=0-596-10046-9 }} * {{cite book | last=Martelli | first=Alex | coauthors=David Ascher, Anna Ravenscroft | title=Python Cookbook | publisher=O'Reilly Media | month=March | year=2005 | isbn=0-596-00797-3 }} == External resources == * Much of Martelli's writing can be found at his [http://www.aleax.it/ personal home page]. * [http://youtube.com/watch?v=g7V89K8QfgQ Introductory Lecture on Python] * [http://stackoverflow.com/users/95810/alex-martelli Stack Overflow profile] ''Note:'' This article is based on autobiographical material at http://www.aleax.it/bio.txt, released as GFDL. {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME = Martelli, Alex | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH = 1955 | PLACE OF BIRTH = | DATE OF DEATH = | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Martelli, Alex}} [[Category:1955 births]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:Google employees]] [[Category:Italian computer scientists]] [[Category:People from Bologna]]</text> </page> <page> <id>1379</id> <title>Alexander Brudno</title> <text>'''Alexander Brudno''' ('''Aleksandr L'vovich Brudno''') ({{lang-ru|Александр Львович Брудно}}) (January 10, 1918-December 1, 2009) was a [[Russians|Russian]] [[Jews|Jewish]] [[computer science|computer scientist]], best known for fully describing the [[alpha-beta pruning|alpha-beta]] (α-β) [[search algorithm]].<ref name="Marsland"/> Since 1991 he lived in Israel. ==Biography== Brudno developed the "mathematics/machine interface" for the [http://www.computer-museum.ru/english/m2.htm M-2] computer constructed in 1952 at the Krzhizhanovskii laboratory of the Institute of Energy of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in the [[Soviet Union]].<ref name="LY"/><ref name="M-2"/> He was a great friend of [[Alexander Kronrod]].
