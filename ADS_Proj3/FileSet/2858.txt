abdomen,ultrasound is particularly sensitive on imaging of biliary tract,urinary tract and female reproductive organs(ovary,fallopian tubes).As for example,diagnosis of gall stone by dilatation of common bile duct and stone in common bile duct . With the ability to visualize important structures in great detail, 3D visualization methods are a valuable resource for the diagnosis and surgical treatment of many pathologies. It was a key resource for the famous, but ultimately unsuccessful attempt by Singaporean surgeons to separate Iranian twins [[Ladan and Laleh Bijani]] in 2003. The 3D equipment was used previously for similar operations with great success. Other proposed or developed techniques include: * [[Diffuse optical tomography]] * [[Elastography]] * [[Electrical impedance tomography]] * [[Optoacoustic imaging]] * [[Ophthalmology]] ** [[A-scan]] ** [[B-scan]] ** [[Corneal topography]] ** [[Optical coherence tomography]] ** [[Scanning laser ophthalmoscopy]] Some of these techniques are still at a research stage and not yet used in clinical routines. ===Compression of medical images=== Medical imaging techniques produce very large amounts of data, especially from CT, MRI and PET modalities. As a result, storage and communications of electronic image data are prohibitive without the use of compression. [[JPEG 2000]] is the state-of-the-art image compression [[DICOM]] standard for storage and transmission of medical images. The cost and feasibility of accessing large image data sets over low or various bandwidths are further addressed by use of another DICOM standard, called [[JPIP]], to enable efficient streaming of the [[JPEG 2000]] compressed image data. === Non-diagnostic imaging === [[Neuroimaging]] has also been used in experimental circumstances to allow people (especially disabled persons) to control outside devices, acting as a [[brain computer interface]]. === Archiving and recording === Used primarily in [[ultrasound]] imaging, capturing the image a medical imaging device is required for archiving and [[telemedicine]] applications. In most scenarios, a [[frame grabber]] is used in order to capture the video signal from the medical device and relay it to a computer for further processing and operations.<ref>[http://www.epiphan.com/solutions_new/?arid=16 Treating Medical Ailments in Real Time]</ref> === Open source software for medical image analysis === Several [[open source]] software packages are available for performing analysis of medical images: * [[ImageJ]] * [[3DSlicer|3D Slicer]] * [[Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit|ITK]] * [[OsiriX]] * [[GemIdent]] * [[MicroDicom]] * [[FreeSurfer]] * [http://spl.utko.feec.vutbr.cz/en/component/content/article/21-zpracovani-medicinskych-signalu/46-image-processing-extension-for-rapidminer-5 Rapidminer Image Processing Extenison] - open-source tool, which combines image processing with data-mining === Use in pharmaceutical clinical trials === Medical imaging has become a major tool in clinical trials since it enables rapid diagnosis with visualization and quantitative assessment. A typical [[clinical trial]] goes through multiple phases and can take up to eight years. [[Clinical endpoint]]s or outcomes are used to determine whether the therapy is safe and effective. Once a patient reaches the endpoint, he/she is generally excluded from further experimental interaction. Trials that rely solely on [[clinical endpoint]]s are very costly as they have long durations and tend to need large number of patients. In contrast to clinical endpoints, [[surrogate endpoint]]s have been shown to cut down the time required to confirm whether a drug has clinical benefits. Imaging [[biomarkers]] (a characteristic that is objectively measured by an imaging technique, which is used as an indicator of pharmacological response to a therapy) and surrogate endpoints have shown to facilitate the use of small group sizes, obtaining quick results with good statistical power.<ref name=hajnal>Hajnal, J. V., Hawkes, D. J., & Hill, D. L. (2001). Medical [[Image Registration]]. CRC Press.</ref> Imaging is able to reveal subtle change that is indicative of the progression of therapy that may be missed out by more subjective, traditional approaches. Statistical bias is reduced as the findings are evaluated without any direct patient contact. For example, measurement of [[tumour]] shrinkage is a commonly used surrogate endpoint in solid tumour response evaluation. This allows for faster and more objective assessment of the effects of anticancer drugs. In evaluating the extent of [[Alzheimer’s disease]], it is still prevalent to use behavioural and [[cognitive tests]]. [[MRI]] scans on the entire brain can accurately pinpoint hippocampal atrophy rate while PET scans is able to measure the brain’s metabolic activity by measuring regional glucose metabolism.<ref name=hajnal/> An imaging-based trial will usually be made up of three components: # A realistic imaging protocol. The protocol is an outline that standardizes (as far as practically possible) the way in which the images are acquired using the various modalities ([[Positron emission tomography|PET]], [[SPECT]], [[Computed tomography|CT]], [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]). It covers the specifics in which images are to be stored, processed and evaluated. # An imaging centre that is responsible for collecting the images, perform quality control and provide tools for data storage, distribution and analysis. It is important for images acquired at different time points are displayed in a standardised format to maintain the reliability of the evaluation. Certain specialised imaging contract research organizations provide to end medical imaging services, from protocol design and site management through to data quality assurance and image analysis. # Clinical sites that recruit patients to generate the images to send back to the imaging centre. == See also == {{Col-begin}} {{Col-1-of-3}} * [[Preclinical imaging]] * [[Cardiac PET]] * [[Biomedical informatics]] * [[Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine]] * [[Digital mammography]] * [[EMMI]] European Master in Molecular Imaging * [[eMix]] * [[Fotofinder]] * [[Full-body scan]] * [[VoluMedic]] {{Col-2-of-3}} * [[Magnetic field imaging]] * [[Medical examination]] * [[Medical radiography]] * [[Medical test]] * [[Neuroimaging]] * [[Non-invasive (medical)]] * [[PACS (medical imaging)|PACS]] * [[JPEG 2000]] compression * [[JPIP]] streaming {{Col-3-of-3}} * [[Pneumoencephalogram]] * [[Radiology information system]] * [[Segmentation (image processing)]] * [[Signal-to-noise ratio]] * [[Society for Imaging Science and Technology]] * [[Tomogram]] * [[Virtopsy]] {{Col-end}} ==References == {{reflist}} == Further reading == * {{cite book|title=Digital Image Processing: An Algorithmic Introduction using Java|editor1-first=Wilhelm|editor1-last=Burger|editor2-first=Mark James|editor2-last=Burge|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|year=2008|series=Texts in Computer Science series|issn=1868-0941|doi=10.1007/978-1-84628-968-2|isbn=978-1-84628-379-6}} * {{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Diagnostic Imaging|editor-last=Baert|editor-first=Albert L.|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]]|location=[[Berlin]]|year=2008|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-35280-8|isbn=978-3-540-35278-5}} * [[Tony F.
