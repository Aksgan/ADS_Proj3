to its mean than the standardized value of x is to its mean. ==Definitions for bivariate distribution with identical marginal distributions== ===Restrictive definition=== Let ''X''<sub>1</sub>, ''X''<sub>2</sub> be [[random variable]]s with identical [[marginal distribution]]s with [[expected value|mean]] ''μ''. In this formalization, the [[joint distribution|bivariate distribution]] of ''X''<sub>1</sub> and ''X''<sub>2</sub> is said to exhibit '''regression toward the mean''' if, for every number ''c'' > ''μ'', we have :''&mu;'' ≤ E[''X''<sub>2</sub> | ''X''<sub>1</sub> = ''c''] < ''c'', with the reverse inequalities holding for ''c'' < ''μ''.<ref name=Samuels>Samuels (1991)</ref><ref name=Schmittlein>Schmittlein (1989)</ref> The following is an informal description of the above definition. Consider a population of [[Widget (economics)|widgets]]. Each widget has two numbers, ''X''<sub>1</sub> and ''X''<sub>2</sub> (say, its left span (''X''<sub>1</sub> ) and right span (''X''<sub>2</sub>)). Suppose that the probability distributions of ''X''<sub>1</sub> and ''X''<sub>2</sub> in the population are identical, and that the means of ''X''<sub>1</sub> and ''X''<sub>2</sub> are both ''μ''. We now take a random widget from the population, and denote its ''X''<sub>1</sub> value by ''c''. (Note that ''c'' may be greater than, equal to, or smaller than ''μ''.) We have no access to the value of this widget's ''X''<sub>2</sub> yet. Let ''d'' denote the expected value of ''X''<sub>2</sub> of this particular widget. (''i.e.'' Let ''d'' denote the average value of ''X''<sub>2</sub> of all widgets in the population with ''X''<sub>1</sub>=''c''.) If the following condition is true: :Whatever the value ''c'' is, ''d'' lies between ''&mu;'' and ''c'' (''i.e.'' ''d'' is closer to ''&mu;'' than ''c '' is), then we say that ''X''<sub>1</sub> and ''X''<sub>2</sub> show '''regression toward the mean'''. This definition accords closely with the current common usage, evolved from Galton's original usage, of the term "regression toward the mean." It is "restrictive" in the sense that not every bivariate distribution with identical marginal distributions exhibits regression toward the mean (under this definition).<ref name=Schmittlein>Schmittlein (1989)</ref> ====Theorem==== If a pair (''X'', ''Y'') of random variables follows a [[bivariate normal distribution]], then the conditional mean E(''Y''|''X'') is a linear function of ''X''. The [[correlation coefficient]] ''r'' between ''X'' and ''Y'', along with the marginal means and variances of ''X'' and ''Y'', determines this linear relationship: :<math> \frac{E(Y|X)-EY}{\sigma_y} = r\frac{X-EX}{\sigma_x}, </math> where ''EX'' and ''EY'' are the expected values of ''X'' and ''Y'', respectively, and σ<sub>''x''</sub> and σ<sub>''y''</sub> are the standard deviations of ''X'' and ''Y'', respectively. Hence the conditional expected value of ''Y'', given that ''X'' is ''t'' [[standard deviation]]s above its mean (and that includes the case where it's below its mean, when ''t'' < 0), is ''rt'' standard deviations above the mean of ''Y''. Since |''r''| ≤ 1, ''Y'' is no farther from the mean than ''X'' is, as measured in the number of standard deviations.<ref name=Chernick>[http://books.google.com/books?id=QRwuz6yA97oC&pg=PA272&dq=%22bivariate+normal+distribution%22+%22regression+toward+the+mean%22&ei=TkxvSqiiI47okATC-bHwDg Chernick & Friis (2003)]</ref>. Hence, if 0 ≤ r < 1, then (''X'',''Y'') shows regression toward the mean (by this definition). ===General definition=== The following definition of ''reversion toward the mean'' has been proposed by Samuels as an alternative to the more restrictive definition of ''regression toward the mean'' above.<ref name=Samuels>Samuels (1991)</ref> Let ''X''<sub>1</sub>, ''X''<sub>2</sub> be [[random variable]]s with identical [[marginal distribution]]s with [[expected value|mean]] ''μ''. In this formalization, the [[joint distribution|bivariate distribution]] of ''X''<sub>1</sub> and ''X''<sub>2</sub> is said to exhibit '''reversion toward the mean''' if, for every number ''c'', we have :''&mu;'' ≤ E[''X''<sub>2</sub> | ''X''<sub>1</sub> > ''c''] < E[''X''<sub>1</sub> | ''X''<sub>1</sub> > ''c''], and :''&mu;'' ≥ E[''X''<sub>2</sub> | ''X''<sub>1</sub> < ''c''] > E[''X''<sub>1</sub> | ''X''<sub>1</sub> < ''c''] This definition is "general" in the sense that every bivariate distribution with identical marginal distributions exhibits ''reversion toward the mean''. ==See also== {{Portal|Statistics}} *[[Internal validity]] ==Notes== {{Reflist|2}} ==References== * {{Cite journal | author = J.M.
