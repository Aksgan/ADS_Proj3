Bokowski, Chapters 1-4.</ref> <ref>Because matroids and oriented matroids are abstractions of other mathematical abstractions, nearly all the relevant books are written for mathematical scientists rather than for the general public. For learning about oriented matroids, a good preparation is to study the textbook on [[linear optimization]] by Nering and Tucker, which is infused with oriented-matroid ideas, and then to proceed to Ziegler's lectures on polytopes.</ref> All oriented matroids have an underlying [[matroid]]. Thus, results on ordinary matroids can be applied to oriented matroids. However, the [[conversion (logic)|converse]] is false; some matroids cannot become an oriented matroid by ''orienting'' an underlying structure (e.g., circuits or independent sets).<ref>Björner et alia, Chapter 7.9.</ref> The distinction between matroids and
