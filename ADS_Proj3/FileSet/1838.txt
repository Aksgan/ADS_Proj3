data from the collector can print out summaries that pinpoint missed checkpoints or patrols without the operator having to review all the data collected. Devices can be subject to misuse or heavy wear and tear, to ensure that these devices protect themselves from the working environment the higher end devices have built in microwave, g-force and voltage detection.<ref>[http://www.tomst.com/WinKontrol/manual/en/anti-vandal.htm The PES 'AntiVandal system'], Tomas Haase. Accessed November 1, 2009.</ref> In the analog age, the equivalent device used for the same purpose was the watchclock.<ref>[http://www.watchclocks.org/ The Detex Watchman's Clock Album], Philip Haselton. Accessed May 24, 2007.</ref> Watchclocks often had a paper or light cardboard disk placed inside for each 24-hour period. The user would carry the clock to each checkpoint where a numbered key could be found (typically chained in place to ensure that the user was physically visiting each point). That key would then be inserted into the clock where it would make an imprint in the disk. At the end of the shift or 24-hour period an authorized person (usually someone in a supervisory position above the patroller) would unlock the watchclock and retrieve the disk. In [[Closed-circuit television|Closed Circuit Television Systems]], a tour is a feature allowing the user to monitor video from multiple locations on one screen sequentially on a continuous basis. == Criticisms == {{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}} Though widely used throughout the security industry, these systems are best used in situations that require regular checks for fire, atmospheric conditions and/or malfunctions that could possibly endanger workers and/or assets. Regular patrols by security personnel offer predictability and therefore improve the criminal's chance of committing a crime. For routes which have significant outdoor exposure [[GPS]] units have proven to be a far more effective means of tracking security and law enforcement patrol behavior. Unfortunately GPS systems do not function in the most vulnerable areas such as indoors, underground or within floors of a building. So, systems using assisted GPS have been developed. ==References== {{Reflist}} [[Category:Automatic identification and data capture]] [[Category:Crime prevention]] [[Category:Recorders]] [[Category:Security engineering]]</text> </page> <page> <id>15929</id> <title>Guidance system</title> <text>A '''guidance system''' is a device or group of devices used to [[navigation|navigate]] a [[ship]], [[aircraft]], [[missile]], [[rocket]], [[satellite]], or other craft. Typically, this refers to a system that navigates without direct or continuous human control. Systems that are intended to have a high degree of human interaction are usually referred to as a [[navigation system]]. One of the earliest examples of a true guidance system is that used in the German [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]] during [[World War II]]. This system consisted of a simple [[gyroscope]] to maintain heading, an airspeed sensor to estimate flight time, an altimeter to maintain altitude, and other redundant systems. A guidance system has three major sub-sections: Inputs, Processing, and Outputs. The input section includes [[sensor]]s, [[Course (navigation)|course]] data, [[radio]] and satellite links, and other information sources. The processing section, composed of one or more [[Central processing unit|CPUs]], integrates this data and determines what actions, if any, are necessary to maintain or achieve a proper [[heading]]. This is then fed to the outputs which can directly affect the system's course. The outputs may control [[speed]] by interacting with devices such as [[turbines]], and [[fuel pump]]s, or they may more directly alter course by actuating [[aileron]]s, [[rudder]]s, or other devices. ==History== Inertial navigation systems were originally developed for [[rocket]]s. American rocket pioneer [[Robert Goddard (scientist)|Robert Goddard]] experimented with rudimentary [[gyroscope|gyroscopic]] systems. Dr. Goddard's systems were of great interest to contemporary German pioneers including [[Wernher von Braun]]. The systems entered more widespread use with the advent of [[spacecraft]], [[guided missile]]s, and commercial [[airliner]]s. US guidance history centers around 2 distinct communities. One driven out of [[Caltech]] and NASA JPL, the other from the German scientists that developed the early [[V-2 rocket#Technical details|V2 rocket guidance]] and MIT. The GN&C system for V2 provided many innovations and was the most sophisticated military weapon in 1942 using self contained closed loop guidance. Early V2s leveraged 2 gyroscopes and lateral accelerometer with a simple analog computer to adjust the azimuth for the rocket in flight. Analog computer signals were used to drive 4 external rudders on the tail fins for flight control. Von Braun engineered the surrender of 500 of his top rocket scientists, along with plans and test vehicles, to the Americans. They arrived in Fort Bliss, Texas in 1945 and were subsequently moved to Huntsville, Al in 1950 (aka Redstone arsenal).<ref>http://history.nasa.gov/sputnik/braun.html</ref><ref>http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/vonbraun/photo/50s.html</ref> Von Braun's passion was interplanetary space flight. However his tremendous leadership skills and experience with the V-2 program made him invaluable to the US military.<ref>http://www.astronautix.com/astros/vonbraun.htm</ref> In 1955 the Redstone team was selected to put America's first satellite into orbit putting this group at the center of both military and commercial space. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory traces its history from the 1930s, when Caltech professor [[Theodore von Karman]] conducted pioneering work in rocket propulsion. Funded by Army Ordnance in 1942, JPL's early efforts would eventually involve technologies beyond those of aerodynamics and propellant chemistry. The result of the Army Ordnance effort was JPL's answer to the German V-2 missile, named Corporal, first launched in May 1947. On December 3, 1958, two months after the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was created by Congress, JPL was transferred from Army jurisdiction to that of this new civilian space agency. This shift was due to the creation of a military focused group derived from the German V2 team. Hence, beginning in 1958, NASA JPL and the Caltech crew became focused primarily on unmanned flight and shifted away from military applications with a few exceptions. The community surrounding JPL drove tremendous innovation in telecommunication, interplanetary exploration and earth monitoring (among other areas).<ref>http://ethics.jpl.nasa.gov/welcome.html</ref> In the early 1950s, the US government wanted to insulate itself against over dependency on the Germany team for military applications. Among the areas that were domestically "developed" was missile guidance. In the early 1950s the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory (later to become the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, Inc.) was chosen by the Air Force Western Development Division to provide a
