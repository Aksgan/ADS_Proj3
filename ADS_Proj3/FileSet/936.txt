is in the ‘out of bounds’ area, which should lead to control being passed to the Abort element in order to take action to bring the future data points back into control. During the analysis of the system operation using the CFA Loop, the abort mechanism should have been clearly identified so that when the system goes out of bounds during operation, the alternate control should have been activated and the alternate action should be no surprise to the system designers. The benefit of using control charts is due to its ability to report dynamic conditions of a system in operation. By data point 2, we should be able to see that if the data follows the trend set by the previous data points, the data will go out of control at some point. This ability to see the trend allows for the chart user to take early action to ensure that the system stays in control or to monitor automated abort processes used to bring the system back into control. <References/> [[Category:Systems analysis]]</text> </page> <page> <id>8036</id> <title>Control and Indicating Equipment</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=February 2009}} {{Wikify|date=November 2009}} '''Control and Indicating Equipment''' is equipment for receiving, processing, controlling, indicating and initiating the onward transmission of information as used in [[fire alarm system]]s. The fire detection and fire alarm system Subcommittee of ISO/TC 21, Equipment for fire protection and fire fighting, had oversight for development of five Standards covering detectors, control and indicating equipment. ISO 7240-2:3003 specifies requirements, test methods and performance criteria for control and indicating equipment (c.i.e.) for use in fire detection and fire alarm systems installed in buildings. The Australian [[CSIRO]] under the Active Fire Protection Equipment Scheme sets the technical specifications and standards for lead acid batteries in Control and Indicating Equipment. The United Kingdom Loss Prevention Council sets requirements for the design and testing of control and indicating equipment (CIE) for use with intruder alarm and hold-up alarm systems. It covers two grades of CIE (Grade A and Grade B). Shuichi Murao was granted United States [http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6239697.html Patent 6239697] on May 29, 2001 for a Fire alarm system for use in Control and Indicating Equipment. ==External links== *[http://www.sai-global.com/newsroom/tgs/2002-08/fire/fire.htm Australia fires up a quiet ISO Subcommittee] [[Category:Fire detection and alarm]] {{Tech-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>8038</id> <title>Control banding</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=February 2009}} '''Control banding''' is a qualitative or semi-quantitative [[risk assessment]] and [[risk management|management]] approach to promoting [[occupational health and safety]]. It is intended to minimize worker exposures to hazardous chemicals and other risk factors in the workplace and to help small businesses by providing an easy-to-understand, practical approach to controlling hazardous exposures at work. The principle of control banding was first applied to dangerous chemicals, chemical mixtures, and fumes. The control banding process emphasizes the controls needed to prevent hazardous substances from causing harm to people at work. The greater the potential for harm, the greater the degree of control needed to manage the situation and make the risk “acceptable.” <ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ctrlbanding/ |title=NIOSH Control Banding |accessdate=2007-10-15|publisher=United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health}}</ref> A single ''control'' technology or strategy is matched with a single ''band'', or range of exposures (e.g. 1-10 milligrams per cubic meter) for a particular class of chemicals (e.g. skin irritants, reproductive hazards). Here is an example of four control bands developed for [[inhalation]] hazards. {| class="wikitable" |- ! Band no. ! Hazard Group ! Exposure Concentration ! Control Strategy |- | 1 | Skin and eye irritants | <1–10 mg/m<sup>3</sup> dust, or >50 to 500 [[Parts per million|ppm]] [[vapor]] | General [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] and good [[industrial hygiene]] practices. |- | 2 | Harmful on single exposure | >0.1 to 1 mg/m<sup>3</sup> dust or >5 to 550 ppm vapor | Local exhaust ventilation |- | 3 | Severely irritating and corrosive | >0.01 to 0.1 mg/m<sup>3</sup> dust or <0.5 to 5 ppm vapor | Process enclosure, an engineering control |- | 4 | Very toxic on single exposure, reproductive hazard, sensitizer | <0.01 mg/m<sup>3</sup> dust or <0.5 ppm vapor | Seek expert advice |} In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) has developed a comprehensive control banding model called ''COSHH Essentials'' ([[COSHH]] stands for ''control of substances hazardous to health.)'' The use of control banding strategies has become very popular in the pharmaceutical industry<ref>{{cite web |author=Naumann, B. |title=Control Banding in the Pharmaceutical Industry |url=http://www.aioh.org.au/downloads/documents/ControlBandingBNaumann.pdf |work= |publisher= |date= |accessdate=October 16, 2009}}</ref> where early stage development compounds may have little or no toxicology data. ==Limitations of Control Banding== Control banding is not without limitations and still requires professional knowledge and experience to verify that the control measures specified have been properly installed, maintained, and used. Controls should be validated prior to use by either using substance specific industrial hygiene methods or performing surrogate monitoring. ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ctrlbanding/ NIOSH Safety and Health Topic: Control Banding] * [http://www.coshh-essentials.org.uk/ ''COSHH Essentials''] * [http://www.ioha.net/controlbanding.html/ International Occupational Hygiene Association (IOHA): Control Banding] * [http://www.baua.de/cae/servlet/contentblob/674200/publicationFile/48355/workplace-control-scheme.pdf BAuA: Easy-to-use control scheme for hazardous substances (EMKG)] * [http://www.reach-clp-helpdesk.de/reach/en/Exposure/Exposure.html BAuA: EMKG-Expo-Tool for Exposure Assessment (Workers)] * [https://www.stoffenmanager.nl/ Stoffenmanager] [[Category:Hazard analysis]]</text> </page> <page> <id>8049</id> <title>Control panel (Mac OS)</title> <text>{{See also|System Preferences}} {{unreferenced|date=June 2010}} {{Unreferenced stub|auto=yes|date=December 2009}} Under [[Mac OS 9]] and earlier, a '''control panel''' is a small [[application software|application]] which enabled the user to modify [[software]] and [[hardware]] settings such as the sound volume and desktop pattern. Control panels differ from [[Extension (Mac OS)|extensions]] in that they allow the user to specify options, whereas extensions provide the user with no interface for setting preferences. In many software distributions Extensions provided the functionality and the corresponding Control Panel provided all the configuration options. ==History== The original control panels in the earliest [[Mac OS]] were all combined into one small [[Desk Accessory]]. [[Susan Kare]] designed the [[User interface|interface]] for the original control panel, and tried to make it as user-friendly as possible. This design was used until [[System 6]] when separate control panel files ("cdev"s) were added, accessible solely through the control panel. With the debut of [[System 7]] the control panels were separated into individual
