Library Corporation. Brower and [[Common Knowledge]] are recognised in the Library Microcomputer Hall of Fame.<ref>[http://www.wiredlibrarian.com/wln/wlnhalloffame.htm WLN: Library Microcomputer Hall of Fame]</ref> The modern [[Open Access movement]] (as a [[social movement]]) traces its history at least back to the 1960s, but became much more prominent in the 1990s with the advent of the [[Digital Age]]. With the spread of the [[Internet]] and the ability to copy and distribute electronic data at no cost, the arguments for open access gained new importance. Probably the earliest book publisher to provide open access was the [[National Academies Press]], publisher for the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], [[Institute of Medicine]], and other arms of the [[National Academies]]. They have provided free online full-text editions of their books alongside priced, printed editions since 1994, and assert that the online editions promote sales of the print editions. As of June 2006 they had more than 3,600 books up online for browsing, searching, and reading. An explosion of interest and activity in open access journals has occurred since the 1990s, largely due to the widespread availability of [[Internet]] access. It is now possible to publish a scholarly article and ''also'' make it instantly accessible anywhere in the world where there are [[computers]] and Internet connections. The fixed cost of producing the article is separable from the minimal marginal cost of the online distribution. These new possibilities emerged at a time when the traditional, print-based scholarly journals system was in a crisis. The number of journals and articles produced has been increasing at a steady rate; however the average cost per journal has been rising at a rate far above [[inflation]] for decades, and budgets at academic libraries have remained fairly static. The result was decreased access - ironically, just when technology has made almost unlimited access a very real possibility, for the first time. [[Libraries]] and [[librarian]]s have played an important part in the open access movement, initially by alerting faculty and administrators to the serials crisis. The Association of Research Libraries developed the [[Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition]] (SPARC), in 1997, an alliance of academic and research libraries and other organizations, to address the crisis and develop and promote alternatives, such as open access. The first online-only, free-access journals (eventually to be called "open access journals") began appearing in the late 1980s. Among them was ''[[Bryn Mawr Classical Review]]''<ref>[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/ The Bryn Mawr Classical Review]</ref>, ''Postmodern Culture''<ref>[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/postmodern_culture/ Project MUSE - Postmodern Culture]</ref> and ''Psycoloquy''<ref>[http://psycprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/ Welcome to PsycPrints]</ref>. The first free scientific online archive was arXiv.org, started in 1991, initially a preprint service for physicists, initiated by [[Paul Ginsparg]]. Self-archiving has become the norm in physics, with some sub-areas of physics, such as high-energy physics, having a 100% self-archiving rate. The prior existence of a "preprint culture" in high-energy physics is one major reason why arXiv has been successful.<ref>[http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0102004 [physics/0102004&#93; Predecessors of preprint servers]</ref> arXiv now includes papers from related disciplines, such as computer science and mathematics, but computer scientists mostly self-archive on their own websites and have been doing so for even longer than physicists. ([[Citeseer]] is a computer science archive that harvests, [[Google]]-style, from distributed computer science websites and [[institutional repository|institutional repositories]] and contains almost twice as many papers as arxiv.) arXiv now includes postprints as well as preprints.<ref>[http://www.eprints.org/openaccess/self-faq/#What-is-Eprint Self-Archiving FAQ]</ref> The two major physics publishers ([[American Physical Society]] and [[Institute of Physics]] Publishing have reported that arXiv has had no effect on journal subscriptions in physics; even though the articles are freely available, usually before publication, physicists value their journals and continue to support them.<ref>[http://www.iop.org/ Institute of Physics - Home of the Institute of Physics]</ref>) <ref>[http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/11006/ Open access self-archiving: An Introduction - ECS EPrints Repository]</ref> The [[inventor]]s of the [[Internet]] and the [[World Wide Web|Web]] -- computer scientistsâ€”had been self-archiving on their own [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] sites and then their websites since even earlier than the physicists, as was revealed when [[Citeseer]] began harvesting their papers in the late 1990s. The 1994 "[[Subversive Proposal]]"<ref>[http://www.arl.org/scomm/subversive/sub01.html Association of Research Libraries :: Scholarly Journals at the Crossroads: A Subversive Proposal for Electronic Publishing]</ref> was to extend [[self-archiving]] to all other disciplines; from it arose [[CogPrints]] (1997) and eventually the [[Open Archives Initiative|OAI]]-compliant generic [[GNU]] [[Eprints.org]] software in 2000.<ref>[http://www.dlib.org/dlib/october00/10inbrief.html#HARNAD D-Lib - In Brief (October 2000)]</ref> In 1997, the U.S. [[National Library of Medicine]] (NLM) made [[Medline]], the most comprehensive index to medical literature on the planet, freely available in the form of [[PubMed]]. Usage of this database increased a hundredfold when it became free, strongly suggesting that prior limits on usage were impacted by lack of access. While indexes are not the main focus of the open access movement, free Medline is important in that it opened up a whole new form of use of [[scientific literature]] - by the public, not just professionals. In 1998, the [[American Scientist Open Access Forum]]<ref>[http://amsci-forum.amsci.org/archives/American-Scientist-Open-Access-Forum.html Archives Of American-Scientist-Open-Access-Forum@Listserver.Sigmaxi.Org]</ref> was launched (and first called the "September98 Forum"). The ''Journal of Medical Internet Research'' (''JMIR'')<ref>[http://www.jmir.org/ JMIR Home]</ref>,one of the first Open Access journals in medicine, was created in 1998, publishing its first issue in 1999. In 1999, [[Harold Varmus]] of the [[NIH]] proposed a journal called [http://www.nih.gov/about/director/pubmedcentral/ebiomedarch.htm E-biomed], intended as an open access electronic publishing platform combining a [[preprint]] server with peer-reviewed articles. E-biomed later saw light in a revised form<ref>[http://www.nih.gov/about/director/pubmedcentral/pubmedcentral.htm PubMed Central: An NIH-Operated Site for Electronic Distribution of Life Sciences Research Reports]</ref> as [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/[[PubMed Central]], a [[postprint]] archive. It was also in 1999 that the [[Open Archives Initiative]] and its [[OAI-PMH]] protocol for metadata harvesting was launched in order to make online archives interoperable. In 2000, [[BioMed Central]], a for-profit open access publisher, was launched by the then Current Science Group (the founder of the ''Current Opinion'' series, and now known as the Science Navigation Group) <ref>[http://www.biomedcentral.com/info/about/pr-releases#bn00 BioMed Central | about us | Press releases<]</ref>. In some ways, BioMed Central resembles [[Harold Varmus]]' original E-biomed proposal more closely than does [[PubMed Central]] <ref>[http://www.infotoday.com/it/jan05/poynder.shtml Interview with Vitek Tracz: Essential for Science]</ref>. BioMed Central now publishes over 170 journals <ref>[http://www.biomedcentral.com/info/authors/journaloverview
