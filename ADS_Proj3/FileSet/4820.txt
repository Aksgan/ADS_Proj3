in order to identify problems that are both difficult to detect and difficult to test for. ==Tools== The [[Static Driver Verifier]] (SDV) is capable of performing very deep validation of code paths across functions and even through calls into WDM. SDV can find driver problems that span multiple function calls and even multiple operations. SDV is designed to be run when the driver is nearing completion. SDV analyzes only C files, C++ is not supported. [[PREFast for Drivers]] (PFD) performs rather shallow analysis of driver operations. PFD can check for buffer overruns and other common programming errors likewise a number of driver specific problems. Because its scope of operation is within a single function, PFD's run time is much shorter than SDV. Therefore, PFD can be used throughout the driver development process. PREFast scans each function as isolated unit, it does not do inter-procedural analysis.

Protecting core system files mitigates problems such as [[DLL hell]] with programs and the operating system. Windows 2000, [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Server 2003]] include WFP under the name of ''Windows File Protection''; [[Windows Me]] includes it as ''System File Protection''. == Operation == With Windows File Protection active, replacing or deleting a system file that has no [[File locking|file lock]] to prevent it getting overwritten causes Windows to immediately and silently restore the original copy of the file. The original version of the file is restored from a cached folder which contains backup copies of these files. The [[Windows NT]] family uses the cached folder <tt>%WinDir%\System32\Dllcache</tt>. [[Windows Me]] caches its entire set of compressed cabinet setup files and stores them in the <tt>%Systemroot%\Options\Install</tt> folder. WFP covers all files which the operating system installs (such as <tt>DLL</tt>, <tt>EXE</tt>, <tt>SYS</tt>, <tt>OCX</tt> etc.), protecting them from deletion or from replacement by older versions. The [[digital signature]]s of these files are checked using [[code signing]] and the signature catalog files stored in the <tt>%Systemroot%\system32\catRoot\{F750E6C3-38EE-11D1-85E5-00C04FC295EE}</tt> folder. Only certain operating system components such as the ''Package Installer'' (Update.exe) or [[Windows Installer]] (Msiexec.exe) can replace these files. Changes made using any other methods in order to replace these files are reverted and the files are silently restored from the cache. If Windows File Protection cannot automatically find the file in the cached folder, it searches the network path or prompts the user for the Windows installation disc to restore the appropriate version of the file. WFP integrates with the [[System File Checker]] (<code>sfc.exe</code>) utility. [[Windows Vista]] does not include Windows File Protection, but it includes [[Windows Resource Protection]] which protects files using [[Access control list|ACLs]]. Windows Resource Protection aims to protect core [[Windows registry|registry]] keys and values and prevent potentially damaging system configuration changes, besides operating system files. Note that the non-use of ACLs in Windows File Protection was a design choice: Not only did it allow operation on non-NTFS systems, but it prevented those same "bad" installers from failing completely from a file access error. == See also == * [[Windows Resource Protection]] * [[System File Checker]] * [[Access Control List]] * [[Security Identifier]] == External links == * [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/222193 Overview of Windows File Protection] * [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/222473 Registry settings for Windows File Protection] * [http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/archive/wfp.mspx Whitepaper on Windows File Protection] * [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/253571 Overview of System File Protection (Windows Me)] * [http://www.bitsum.com/aboutwfp.asp Hacking Windows File Protection] {{Windows Components}} [[Category:Microsoft Windows]] [[Category:Windows administration]] [[Category:Windows components]] [[Category:Windows 2000]] [[ru:Windows File Protection]]</text> </page> <page> <id>40278</id> <title>Windows Home Server</title> <text>{{Primary sources|date=August 2008}} {{Infobox OS version | name = Windows Home Server | family = Microsoft Windows | logo = Windows Home Server logo.svg | screenshot = Windows home serverr.png | caption = Screenshot of the Windows Home Server Desktop | developer = Microsoft | website = http://www.microsoft.com/windowshomeserver/ | source_model = [[Closed source]] / [[Shared source]] | license = Microsoft [[EULA]] | kernel_type = [[Hybrid kernel|Hybrid]] | first_release_date = RTM: 16 July 2007<br>Retail: 7 November 2007 | power_pack_version = Power Pack 3 | release_version = 6.0.2423.0 (Power Pack 3)<ref name="The Windows Blog">{{cite web | url=http://windowsteamblog.com/blogs/windowshomeserver/archive/2009/11/24/power-pack-3-instructions-for-users-running-pre-release-versions.aspx | title=Power Pack 3 instructions for users running pre-release versions | publisher=The Windows Blog | date=2009-11-24 | accessdate=2009-11-24 }}</ref> | release_date = 24 November 2009<ref>{{cite web | url=http://windowsteamblog.com/blogs/windowshomeserver/archive/2009/11/19/windows-home-server-power-pack-3-available-november-24th-includes-enhancements-for-windows-7-based-computers.aspx | title=Windows Home Server Power Pack 3 available November 24th includes enhancements for Windows 7-based computers | publisher=The Windows Blog | date= 2009-11-19 | accessdate=2009-11-28 }}</ref> |date=January 2009 | support_status = Mainstream support until 8 January 2013<ref>{{cite web | url=http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/?p1=12624 | title=Windows Home Server Support Lifecycle | publisher= Microsoft | accessdate=2010-02-08}}</ref>}}<!-- approximate date of template insertion for dating hidden maintenance categories --> '''Windows Home Server''', code-named ''Quattro'', is a [[home server]] [[operating system]] from [[Microsoft]].
