it to monitor and interact with its environment. It has infrared and stereo sound sensors on its head, and touch sensors on its chin, tail, and mouthies allowing for more fun and interactive play. == Autonomous behaviors == It has four different modes of behavior or moods: hunting, cautious, playful, and free-roam. In hunting mode, it will react to sharp sounds and progressively focus its attention more intensely on repeated sounds coming from the same direction. In cautious mode, it will react oppositely and move away from sounds it hears. In playful mode, it will react to sounds in a more whimsical fashion but neither approaching nor avoiding them. In free-roam mode, it will explore its environment, avoiding obstacles and stopping occasionally to listen for loud sounds to investigate. The Raptor does not walk well on carpet and cannot be programmed. == Flexible behaviors == When one touches one of Roboraptor's touch sensors, its reaction will vary depending on its mood. Touching its face when it is hunting will make it react angrily and most likely attempt to "attack" the person touching it. But if it is feeling playful, it will nuzzle the person's hand and then "attack", using its jaws. == Laser targeting == Early versions of the Roboraptor could also follow a laser-like target pointed on the ground. This could be used this to lead it around a room under direct control. However, this feature was removed from later units. == Mini Roboraptor == There is also a smaller version of Roboraptor available. However, it does not have a remote control or different modes of behavior. It is not an autonomous robot so much as it is a wind-up toy, though the smaller version does actually run on batteries. It is a smaller, cheaper, less functional Roboraptor. It walks at a single pace and it has a 'trigger' to make its mouth move, but it does not have any other sensors. == External links == *[http://www.wowwee.com/en/products/toys/robots/robotics/robocreatures/roboraptor Official WowWee Roboraptor Site] *[http://www.wowwee.com/en/support/roboraptor Roboraptor Tech Specs] *[http://www.wowwee.com/static/support/roboraptor/manuals/Roboraptor_Manual.pdf Roboraptor manual (PDF)] *[http://www.robocommunity.com RoboCommunity] - The official WowWee Robotics user community *[http://www.robocommunity.com/article/10110/ Evolution of the Roboraptor] {{WowWee Robots}} [[Category:Toy brands]] [[Category:Toys of the 2000s]] [[Category:Entertainment robots]] [[Category:Biomorphic robots]] [[Category: Robotic dinosaurs]] [[fr:Roboraptor]] [[pt:Roboraptor]]</text> </page> <page> <id>32283</id> <title>RobotWar</title> <text>{{Infobox software | name = RobotWar | logo = | screenshot = [[Image:robotwar.png|RobotWar screenshot]] | caption = The robot "Maniac" has been shot by the robot "Bottom" in this screen capture.

This game, along with the companion program '''''RobotWrite''''', was originally developed in the [[TUTOR (programming language)|TUTOR programming language]] language on the [[PLATO system]] in the 1970s. Later the game was commercialized and adapted for the [[Apple II family]] of computers and published by [[Muse Software]] in 1981. The premise was that in the distant future of 2002, war was declared hazardous to human health, and now countries settled their differences in a battle arena full of combat [[robot]]s. As the manual stated, "The task set before you is: to program a robot, that no other robot can destroy!" The main activity of the game was to write a [[computer program]] that would operate a (simulated) robot. The player could then select multiple robots who would do battle in an arena until only one was left standing. The robots did not have direct knowledge of the location or velocity of any of the other robots; they could only use radar pulses to deduce distance, and perhaps use clever [[computer programming|programming]] techniques to deduce velocity. No physical dexterity was required or even relevant in ''RobotWar''; there was no way for the player to actually take part in the battle. ==Robot programming== The robots' language was similar to [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]]. There were 34 [[processor register|registers]] that could be used as variables or for the robots' [[I/O]] functions. An example program from the game manual follows: SCAN AIM + 5 TO AIM ; MOVE GUN AIM TO RADAR ; SEND RADAR PULSE LOOP IF RADAR < 0 GOSUB FIRE ; TEST RADAR GOTO SCAN FIRE 0 - RADAR TO SHOT ; FIRE THE GUN ENDSUB The robot with this program would sweep its radar in a circle, firing off radar pulses, and when it detected another robot in this way, would fire a projectile, set to explode at the correct distance as estimated by the radar pulse. This particular robot would stand still throughout the entire battle, as it never assigned any number to its movement registers. In a way, ''RobotWar'' was a [[multiplayer]] game, in that different people could program their robots, then copy all the robots' [[source code]] to the same floppy disk and load all the robots to fight in the arena. The game was sold in [[cassette tape]] and [[floppy disk]] versions. ==Related works== ''[[RoboWar]]'' is a similar game that was released later on the [[Macintosh]], and is now available for both [[Mac OS]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. ''[[Crobots]]'' is a related game that uses a simplified version of the 'C' programming language to program the robots. In Crobots the game arena is displayed as simple ASCII graphics. ''[[MindRover]]'' is a recent implementation of concepts taken from ''RobotWar'' and ''[[Robot Odyssey]]'', which allows users to design more customized and advanced robots. ''[[RoboCode]]'' the idea of RobotWar implemented in Java (opensource) and still supported since 2001. ==Reception== In its first issue, [[Computer Gaming World]] praised the
