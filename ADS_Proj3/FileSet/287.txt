many points that are periodic points of {{math|<var>F</var>}}. <BR> (b) There is a point {{math|<var>P</var>}} ∈ '''P'''<sup>N</sup> such that {{math|<var>C</var>}} contains infinitely many points in the orbit {{math|<var>O<sub>F</sub></var>}}( {{math|<var>P</var>}}). <BR> Then {{math|<var>C</var>}} is periodic for {{math|<var>F</var>}} in the sense that there is some iterate {{math|<var>F</var>}}<sup>({{math|<var>k</var>}})</sup> of {{math|<var>F</var>}} that maps {{math|<var>C</var>}} to itself. ==''p''-adic dynamics== The field of [[p-adic dynamics|{{math|<var>p</var>}}-adic (or nonarchimedean) dynamics]] is the study of classical dynamical questions over a field {{math|<var>K</var>}} that is complete with respect to a nonarchimedean absolute value. Examples of such fields are the field of {{math|<var>p</var>}}-adic rationals '''Q'''<sub>{{math|<var>p</var>}}</sub> and the completion of its algebraic closure '''C'''<sub>{{math|<var>p</var>}}</sub>. The metric on {{math|<var>K</var>}} and the standard definition of equicontinuity leads to the usual definition of the [[Fatou set|Fatou]] and [[Julia set]]s of a rational map {{math|<var>F</var>}}({{math|<var>x</var>}}) ∈ {{math|<var>K</var>}}({{math|<var>x</var>}}). There are many similarities between the complex and the nonarchimedean theories, but also many differences. A striking difference is that in the nonarchimedean setting, the Fatou set is always nonempty, but the Julia set may be empty. This is the reverse of what is true over the complex numbers. Nonarchimedean dynamics has been extended to [[Berkovich space]],<ref> R. Rumely and M. Baker, [http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0407433 Analysis and dynamics on the Berkovich projective line], ArXiv preprint, 150 pages. </ref> which is a compact connected space that contains the totally disconnected non-locally compact field '''C'''<sub>{{math|<var>p</var>}}</sub>. ==Generalizations== There are natural generalizations of arithmetic dynamics in which '''Q''' and '''Q'''<sub>{{math|<var>p</var>}}</sub> are replaced by number fields and their {{math|<var>p</var>}}-adic completions. Another natural generalization is to replace self-maps of '''P'''<sup>1</sup> or '''P'''<sup>{{math|<var>N</var>}}</sup> with self-maps (morphisms) {{math|<var>V</var>}} → {{math|<var>V</var>}} of other affine or [[projective variety|projective varieties]]. ==Other areas in which number theory and dynamics interact== There are many other problems of a number theoretic nature that appear in the setting of dynamical systems, including: * dynamics over [[finite field]]s. * dynamics over [[Global field|function fields]] such as '''C'''({{math|<var>x</var>}}). * iteration of formal and {{math|<var>p</var>}}-adic [[power series]]. * dynamics on [[Lie group]]s. * arithmetic properties of dynamically defined [[moduli space]]s. * [[equidistribution]]<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=a4XE8QWc1GUC Equidistribution in number theory, an introduction], Andrew Granville, Zeév Rudnick Springer, 2007, ISBN 9781402054037</ref> and invariant [[Measure (mathematics)|measures]], especially on {{math|<var>p</var>}}-adic spaces. * dynamics on [[Drinfeld module]]s. * number-theoretic iteration problems that are not described by rational maps on varieties, for example, the [[Collatz problem]].

Its [[audio processing]] solutions are applied in the sectors of [[Consumer Electronics]] and [[Car audio]]. Arkamys was founded in [[Paris]] in 1998. The company initially used its patented sound [[spatialisation]] process to [[remaster]] movies and DVDs for the professional entertainment industry. Today its audio enhancement software is implemented in consumer electronic products, such as [[mobile phones]] and [[mp3 players]], as well as [[portable media players]] and car radios. ==History== ===1998 - 2004=== Arkamys was set up to exploit the internationally patented sound spatialisation process invented by one of Arkamys co-founders. The Arkamys technology is based on a process which allows the spatialisation of an existing [[audio signal]] ([[Monophonic sound|mono]], [[stereo]], [[5.1]]) and thereby aims to create a more realistic listening experience. The spatialisation process is initially used to remaster cinematic masterpieces such as [[Subway (film)|Subway]] by [[Luc Besson]] (remastered in 2001) for the cinema and [[DVD]] industries. Arkamys saw rapid growth and chose to settle down at [[Château d'Hérouville]], a recording studio where stars like [[Elton John]], [[The Bee Gees]] and [[Pink Floyd]] recorded their music. The Château’s main hall was used for the audio tuning and the tapes were afterwards remastered in order to transform a monophonic or stereophonic sound into a [[surround sound|multichannel sound]]. Numerous movies were modernised with the help of Arkamys’ spatialisation process among theses for instance [[Peau d'Âne]] (Donkey Skin), a film inspired by the work of [[Jean Cocteau]], but also [[Bagdad Café]], [[Dirty Dancing]], [[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]] as well as the series Le Gendarme with [[Louis de Funes]]. ===2004 - Present time=== In 2004, Arkamys re-orientates its business activities transforming from a service company that remasters movies into a supplier to the Consumer Electronics industry, specialising in car audio, mobile phones and media players. Therefore, the digital processing [[algorithms]] had to be adapted to the limited processor capacity of mobile devices and auto radios. First customers were media player manufacturer Archos and the airline company [[Air France]] that chose Arkamys to optimize audio restitution over headphones on their Business Class flights. A major [[licensing]] deal was closed in 2008 when [[Renault]] announced to equip most of its [[Mégane]] line-up with Arkamys technology.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.3dsoundbyarkamys.com/|title=Video: Introducing to the 3d Sound by arkamys at Paris motor show|accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref> ===Key Events=== * 1998: Founded in Paris, France * 1998: First sound spatialisation patent * 1998-2004: Studio [[postproduction]], entertainment & broadcast: hundred DVDs and music
