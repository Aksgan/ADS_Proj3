use a red inked stamp that contains the notary's full name and the words "notary public". It is also common for the seal or stamp to include the notary's chosen logo or symbol. In South Australia and [[Scotland]], it is acceptable for a notary to use the letters "NP" after their name. Thus a South Australian notary may have "John Smith LLB NP" or similar on his business card or letterhead. Australian notaries do not hold "commissions" which can expire. Generally, once appointed they are authorized to act as a notary for life and can only be "struck off" the Roll of Notaries for proven misconduct. In certain States, for example, New South Wales, they cease to be qualified to continue as a Notary once they cease to hold a practising certificate as a legal practitioner. All Australian jurisdictions also have [[Justice of the Peace|Justices of the Peace]] (JP) or Commissioners for Affidavits who can witness affidavits or statutory declarations and certify documents. However they can only do so if the relevant affidavit, statutory declaration or copy document is to be used only in Australia rather than in a foreign country, with the possible exception of a few Commonwealth countries not including the [[United Kingdom]] or New Zealand except for very limited purposes. Justices of the Peace (JPs) are (usually) laypersons who have minimal, if any, training (depending on the jurisdiction) but are of proven good character. Therefore a US notary resembles an Australian JP rather than an Australian notary. ===Canada=== Canadian notaries public are very much like their American counterparts, generally restricted to administering oaths, witnessing signatures on affidavits and statutory declarations, providing acknowledgements, certifying true copies, and so forth. ====Nova Scotia==== In [[Nova Scotia]] the position is known as a Commissioner of Oaths, and is regulated by provincial Notaries and Commissioners Act. Individuals hold a commission granted to them by the Minister of Justice. "A Commissioner of Oaths is deemed to be an officer of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. Commissioners take declarations concerning any matter to come before a court in the Province." <ref>http://www.gov.ns.ca/just/legal_services/commissioner_oaths.asp</ref>. Additionally, individuals with other specific qualifications, such as being a current [[Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly|MLA]], commissioned officer of the [[RCMP]] or [[Canadian Forces]] make act as if explicitly being a Commissioner of Oaths. ====British Columbia==== In [[British Columbia]], a notary public is more like a British or Australian notary (see supra). Appointments are for life and made through the Society of Notaries Public of British Columbia.<ref>The Society of Notaries Public of BC, "Education", ''BC Notaries: A Trusted Tradition'' (2009): [http://www.notaries.bc.ca/images/stories/PDF/Education/Becoming%20a%Notary%20Brochure.pdf].</ref> Furthermore, BC notaries exercise far greater power, able to dispense legal advice and draft public instruments including: * '''Notarization''' ** notarizations/attestations of signatures, affidavits, statutory declarations, certified true copies, letters of invitation for foreign travel, authorization of minor child travel, execution/authentications of international documents, passport application documentation, proof of identity for travel purposes * '''Real estate law''' ** home purchase/sale; business purchase/sale; [[mortgages]] and [[refinancing]]; residential, commercial, & manufactures home transfer of title; restrictive covenants & builder's liens * '''Wills & estate planning''' ** preparation and searches of last wills and [[testaments]], living wills, health care directives, representation agreements, [[power of attorney]] * '''[[Contract law]]''' ** preparation of contracts and agreements, commercial lease and assignments * [[easements]] and [[right of way]] * insurance loss declarations * marine bills of sale & mortgages * marine protestations * personal property security agreements * purchaser's side for foreclosures * subdivisions & statutory building schemes * zoning applications ====Quebec==== In [[Quebec]], there are no notaries public, only ''notaires'', or civil-law notaries. As full lawyers, they perform functions similar to those of British Columbian notaries, though in Quebec, the notarial profession encompasses even more areas of practice.<ref>[http://www.cdnq.org/en/notariesInQuebec/essence.html] A general overview of the notarial profession in Quebec: taken from the website of the Chambre des Notaires du Quebec.</ref> To become a notary in Quebec, a candidate must hold a Bachelor's degree in civil law, after which would follow a one-year Master's in notarial law,<ref>[http://www.cdnq.org/] The main page for the Chambre des Notaires du Quebec.</ref> and a traineeship (called a "stage") before being written on the Rolls and able to practice. ===Iran=== Notary Public is a trained lawyer that should pass some special exams to be able to open his office and start his work. Persian meaning of this word is "سردفتر" means head of the office and his assistant called "دفتریار". Both these persons should have Bachelor degree in law or Master degree in civil-law. ===Republic of Ireland=== The office of notary public is one of great antiquity and historical significance. It is unclear, however, when or where the first public notary was formally appointed. One of the earliest references to a notary dates back to the time of Cicero (106 – 43BC), the famed Roman orator and statesmen, who, it is claimed, employed persons skilled in the art of writing to record or ‘note’ his speeches. After the abdication in 476 AD of Romulus Augustus, the last emperor of Rome, the papacy became the de facto ruler of Rome. When Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne emperor of the Holy Roman Empire in 800AD the empire encompassed the entire heartland of Western Europe, stretching from the Danube to the Pyrenees and from Rome to the North Sea. Ecclesiastical notaries were by then part of the papal household and were known to deal with both ecclesiastical and civil matters. At this time it had become the practice of kings, princes and rulers in communion with the Holy See to seek various dispensations, privileges and faculties which were at the gift of the papacy. One such faculty concerned the appointment of notaries.The Pope, for administrative convenience, frequently delegated the power to appoint public notaries to religious (usually Archbishops) and temporal leaders throughout the Holy Roman Empire. In England, the power to create notaries was vested in and exercised by the Archbishop of Canterbury under papal and imperial authority. In Ireland, public notaries were at various times appointed by the Archbishop of Canterbury and
