Both Symantec and McAfee shares fell by 0.5 percent and 1.3 percent respectively. Daniel Ives, an analyst with [[FBR Capital Markets]] said Microsoft Security Essentials would be a "long-term competitive threat", though near-term impact would be negligible.<ref name="Reuters" /> Finally, on 2 October 2009, Avast Software a.s. (developer of [[avast!]]) commented that it has an ambivalent view towards Microsoft Security Essentials. "MSE is not the silver bullet but it is also not the bad sequel to One Care that some claim," said Vincent Steckler, Avast Software CEO.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://blog.avast.com/2009/10/02/and-what-about-microsoft-security-essentials%E2%80%94mse/ |title = And what about Microsoft Security Essentials—MSE? |work = avast! blog |publisher = Avast Software a.s |first = Vincent |last = Steckler |date = 2 October 2009 |accessdate = 20 September 2010 }}</ref> ===Reviews=== [[File:Notification.png|framed|right|A pop-up notification stating malware was found.]] The public beta received several positive reviews, citing its low resource usage, straightforward [[user interface]], and [[price point]].<ref name="PCMag">{{cite web |last = Rubenking |first = Neil J. |url = http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2348998,00.asp |title = Microsoft Security Essentials beta |publisher = [[PC Magazine]] |date = 18 June 2009 |accessdate = 10 July 2009 }}</ref><ref name="PCWorld">{{cite web |last=Mediati |first=Nick |url= http://www.pcworld.com/article/167249/microsoft_security_essentials_basic_automatic_protection.html |title=Microsoft Security Essentials: Basic, Automatic Protection |publisher=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] |date=24 June 2009 |accessdate=10 July 2009 }}</ref><ref name="Krebs">{{cite web |last=Krebs |first=Brian |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/06/microsoft_debuts_free_antiviru.html |title=Microsoft Debuts Free Antivirus Software Beta |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |date=24 June 2009 |accessdate=10 July 2009 }}</ref><ref name="SatishSays" >{{cite web |last=Angad |first=Ulhas M. |url=http://www.satishsays.com/2009/10/17/microsoft-security-essentials-anti-virusreview/ |title=Microsoft Security Essentials Review |publisher=Satishsays.com |date = 17 October 2009 |accessdate=8 October 2009 }}</ref> Brian Krebs of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' found Microsoft Security Essentials used only 4 [[megabytes]] of [[RAM]] during testing, even during scans. A "quick scan" took about 10 minutes, and a "full scan" about 45 minutes on an installation of [[Windows 7]].<ref name="Krebs" /> [[Ars Technica]] reviewed it positively, citing its organized interface, low resource usage, and its status as [[freeware]].<ref name="Ars Technica">{{cite web |last=Protalinski |first=Emil |url=http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2009/09/first-look-microsoft-security-essentials-impresses.ars |title=First look: Microsoft Security Essentials impresses |publisher=[[Ars Technica]] |date=29 September 2009 |accessdate=30 September 2009 }}</ref> ''[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]'' noted its "clear-cut" and "cleanly designed" tabbed [[user interface]]. At the top of the main tab, the security status is clearly shown. The other three tabs allow users to manually update Microsoft Security Essentials, review its history, and change program settings. However, PC World found some of the settings to be cryptic and confusing. Settings, such as what to do when malware is found, default to "Microsoft Security Essentials' recommended action". There is no explanation of the recommended action except in the help file. The editor was also confused because Microsoft Security Essentials does not mention it automatically updates itself within the interface; some may believe they must manually update Microsoft Security Essentials through the "Update" tab.<ref name="PCWorld" /> However, this was included in the final release. ''[[PC Magazine]]'' cited Microsoft Security Essentials's small installation package (about 7 MB, depending on the operating system) and its speedy installation. On the downside, the full installation occupied about 110 MB of disk space, and the initial update took 5 to 15 minutes. The editor also noted the fact Microsoft Security Essentials sets [[Windows Update]] into its fully automatic mode, which automatically downloads and installs updates although it can then be turned off again through the control panel. Installation succeeded on 12 malware-infected systems. Some full scans took over an hour on infected systems; however, a scan on a clean system took 35 minutes.<ref name="PCMag" /> Although the Beta release of Microsoft Security Essentials did poorly in PC Magazine tests, the [[Software release life cycle#General availability|official final release]] did significantly better in AV-Test.org tests. According to Neil Rubenking, a PC Magazine author, in an on-demand scan test that he conducted in June 2009, Microsoft Security Essentials Beta found 89 percent of all malware samples: It found only 30 percent of commercial keyloggers, 67 percent of [[rootkits]] and only half of [[scareware]] samples. The suite's real-time protection found 83 percent of all malware samples and blocked the majority of them: In this test, Microsoft Security Essentials found 40 percent of the commercial keyloggers and 78 percent of the rootkits.<ref name="PCMag" /> Later on October that year, AV-Test.org conducted a series of trials on the officially released version of the product in which Microsoft Security Essentials detected and caught 98.44 percent of 545,034 [[computer virus]]es, [[computer worms]] and [[Trojan horse (computing)|software Trojan horses]] as well as 90.95 percent of 14,222 [[spyware]] and [[adware]] samples. It also detected and eliminated all 25 tested rootkits. Microsoft Security Essentials generated no [[false-positive]] at all.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-10366232-83.html |title = Security Essentials fares well in AV-Test trial |newspaper = [[CNET Networks#CNET News|CNET News]] |publisher = [[CBS Interactive]] |date = 2 October 2009 |accessdate = 24 July 2010 |last = Whitney |first = Lance }}</ref> On 7 January 2010, Microsoft Security Essentials won the [[PC Advisor]]'s ''Best Free Software'' award.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/index.cfm?newsid=3209444 |title = Microsoft wins PC Advisor's Best Free Software award — PC Advisor Awards 2010: winners announced |publisher = [[PC Advisor]] |date = 7 January 2010 |accessdate = 1 August 2010 }}</ref> ==Rogue antivirus software== In February 2010, a [[rogue security software]] package calling itself "Security Essentials 2010" appeared on the Internet.
