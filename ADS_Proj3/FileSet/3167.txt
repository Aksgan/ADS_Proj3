its other aspects that defy traditional conservation--including hybrid, contextual, or 'live' qualities--has provoked investigation into new strategies for preserving [[conceptual art]], [[performance art|performance]], [[installation art]], [[video art]], and even to a limited extent [[painting]] and [[sculpture]]. ==Relationship to other preservation efforts== The catchall term sometimes applied to such genres, ''variable media'', suggests that it is possible to recapture the experience of these works independently of the specific physical material and equipment used to display them in a given exhibition or performance. As the nature of multi-media artworks calls for the development of new standards, techniques, and [[metadata]] within preservation strategies, the idea that certain artworks incorporating an array of media elements could be variable opens up the possibility for experimental standards of preservation and reinterpretation. Nevertheless, many new media preservationists work to integrate new preservation strategies with existing documentation techniques and [[metadata]] standards. This effort is made in order to remain compatible with previous frameworks and models on how to archive, store and maintain variable media objects in a standardized repository utilizing a systematized vocabulary, such as the [[Open Archival Information System]] model. While some of this research parallels and exploits progress made in the practice of [[Digital preservation]] and [[Web archiving]], the preservation of new media art offers special challenges and opportunities. Whereas scientific data and legal records may be easily [[#Migration|migrated]] from one platform to another without losing their essential function, artworks are often sensitive to the look and feel of the media in which they are embedded. On the other hand, artists who are invited to help imagine a long-term plan for their work often respond with creative solutions. == Preservation strategies == ===Storage=== The acquisition and storage of the physical media-equipment, such as DVD players or computers, used in multi-media or digital artworks has proven a short-term tactic at best, as hardware can quickly become obsolete or can ‘stale’ in storage. Storage is also notoriously bad at capturing the contextual and live aspects of works such as [[Internet art]] and [[performance art]]. Variations on storage include: * '''Refreshing''' The periodic transfer of an audiovisual or digital file from one cassette or disk to another device of identical format. * '''Restoration''' The cleaning or repair of an existing artifact or file, especially when the new version supersedes or replaces the original. * '''Networked storage''' The use of computers linked by a persistent data loop to keep critical files in circulation or as multiple copies cloned on multiple hard drives. ===Migration=== To migrate a work of art is to upgrade its format from an aged medium to a more current one, such as from VHS to DVD, accepting that some changes in quality may occur while still maintaining the integrity of the original. This strategy assumes that preserving the content or information of an artwork, despite its change in media, trumps concerns over fidelity to the original look and feel. ===Emulation=== The process of simulating an older operating system (or by extension, other supporting infrastructure) on a newer software or hardware platform is called [[emulator|emulation]]. As in migration, the impetus behind emulation is to keep a work alive though its original media may become obsolete; unlike migration, however, emulation of computer-based art preserves the original code underlying the artwork. Emulation software is currently in various stages of development and efficiency. ==== ''Seeing Double'': an emulation testbed ==== In 2004, the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]], in conjunction with the [[Daniel Langlois Foundation]], held an exhibition entitled [http://www.variablemedia.net/e/seeingdouble/ Seeing Double: Emulation in Theory and Practice] as a trial of emulation. In the exhibition, artworks operating on their original physical media were displayed alongside versions emulated on newer physical media. The exhibition was organized with the participation of computer researcher and emulation specialist, [[Jeff Rothenberg]]. In 1998, Rothenberg had published [http://www.clir.org/PUBS/reports/rothenberg/contents.html "Avoiding Technological Quicksand: Finding a Viable Technical Foundation for Digital Preservation"]. ===Reinterpretation=== The most powerful, but also most risky, preservation strategy for new media art is to reinterpret the work each time it is re-created. Reinterpretation may require rewriting code for a completely different platform, following site-specific instructions regarding installation, or recasting a work in a contemporary medium with the metaphoric value of an outdated medium. Reinterpretation is a dangerous technique when not warranted by the artist, but it may be the only way to re-create performed, installed, or networked art designed to vary with context. ==Preservation tools== ===Variable Media Questionnaire=== First developed in 2000 by [[Jon Ippolito]], associate curator at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]], the Variable Media Questionnaire [http://www.variablemedia.net/e/welcome.html] is an interactive form linked to a larger database, which is designed to capture behavioral information about digital, performative, and other variable media artworks upon their acquisition by a museum. The goal is to specifically define ‘what it is’ and ‘what is needed’ when the museum is acquiring a work of this kind. The goal of the Questionnaire is to assist artists and museum professionals in understanding which attributes of an artwork may change and how best to make those changes when future re-creations necessitate them. Based on the premise that some aspects of an artwork's logic or presentation can be considered independently from the physical context and equipment used to display that artwork, the Questionnaire captures information about the following ''behaviors'' or medium-independent aspects: * '''Contained''' Covers glazing; coating; support/structure/mounting; frame; acceptable change in surface. * '''Installed''' Covers space; boundary; access; lighting; sound; security; base/s; distribution of elements; display equipment for inert elements; architectural placement; equipment visibility. * '''Performed''' Covers props; set; costumes; performers; number of performers; format of instructions; instructions apply to…; documentation of new performances; audience location; boundary; synchronization of performance. * '''Interactive''' Covers user input; interaction mechanism; maintenance. * '''Reproduced''' Covers relationship to artist master; location of master; status of master; acceptable fabricators and vendors; acceptable submasters or exhibition copy; permission to create submaster; fate of exhibition copy; permission to compress/digitize. * '''Duplicable''' Covers [[inert]] material; physical attributes of inert material; authorized fabricators and vendors; materials duplicated according to…; electronic equipment and hardware;
