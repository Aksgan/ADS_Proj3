London]], in or near [[Gower Street]] in September 1968. Subsequent meetings were often held at the offices of Lansdown’s architectural practice (he became the Secretary with Sutcliffe the Chairman and Mallen, Treasurer.)<ref>Alan Sutcliffe, interview with Catherine Mason, January 17, 2003</ref> The Computer Arts Society was founded to encourage the creative use of computers and to allow the exchange of information in this area. It was recognised that this was an area where there had been increasing activity, but with little formal publication of methods and results and little communication between artists in different fields (music, visual, performing arts, and so on).<ref>J D Lomax, (ed.), ''Computers in the Creative Arts'', Manchester: National Computing Centre Ltd, 1973) p.9.</ref> == Early activities == At this time Sutcliffe was a programmer at [[International Computers Limited]] (ICL) in [[Bracknell]], [[Berkshire]] with the official title of Manager of New Series Branch. His area of expertise and responsibility covered what today is called research and development of software. He has commented that ICL was always supportive of his outside artistic endeavours, offering for example, allocation of time on the mainframes, which he undertook mostly outside of peak hours. As the Bracknell branch of ICL did not initially have a mainframe computer, Sutcliffe would occasionally travel to the [[Putney]], London branch. This was located across the River Thames from EMS and this facilitated his collaboration with Zinovieff. Sutcliffe brought the paper tape of a music program he had written at ICL to Zinovieff to “realise” and thus began their collaboration, with Sutcliffe assisting the Studio by writing software for the synthesizers they produced. Zinovieff is recognised as having revolutionised electronic and avant-garde music and EMS was used by [[Harrison Birtwistle|Sir Harrison Birtwistle]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen|Stockhausen]] and [[Pink Floyd]] among others.<ref>''Portrait of Peter Zinovieff'', BBC Radio 4, Producer: Adam Fowler, (aired June 14, 2004).</ref> CAS supported practitioners through a network of meetings, conferences, practical courses, social events, exhibitions and occasionally, through funding. It ran code-writing workshops, held several important exhibitions, co-operated with the [[Scottish Arts Council]] at the [[Edinburgh Festival]] and produced a bulletin. PAGE was initially published from April 1969 until 1985 and was named after the concept of paging (the use of disk memory as a virtual store which had been introduced on the [[Ferranti]] [[Atlas Computer (Manchester)|Atlas]] Computer). It featured major British and international computer artists and hosted some fundamental discussions as to the aims and nature of computer art. Its first editor was [[Gustav Metzger]] (who named the journal),<ref>Alan Sutcliffe, interview with Catherine Mason, January 17, 2003.</ref> thereby establishing from the beginning an association with the avant-garde. Metzger was ‘excited’ to discover CAS and ‘people coming together’ as he had ‘felt quite isolated.’<ref>Gustav Metzger, interview with Catherine Mason, July 11, 2003.</ref> As early as 1961, Metzger had stated that ‘…the artist may collaborate with scientists, engineers.’ As many members were outside of London or overseas, PAGE was an important disseminator of information. CAS had international input early on in its history. A Dutch Branch (CASH) was formed in 1970 in Amsterdam and CAS US, formed in 1971 was based in the Mathematics Department of [[Eastern Michigan University]]. An early issue was devoted to the American branch activities and included ‘A proposal and manifesto’ by [[Stan Vanderbeek]], pioneer of light shows and computer animation.<ref>''Culture: Intercom and Expanded Cinema'', ''PAGE'' 30, 1973.</ref> By 1970, the CAS membership list listed three hundred and seventy-seven members in seventeen countries, including fifteen libraries and institutional members.<ref>CAS membership list April 1970 in the CAS Archive.</ref> During the early years of its existence, the Society acquired a large number of works by pioneers in the field, including [[Manuel Barbadillo]], [[Charles Csuri]], [[Herbert W. Franke]], [[Edward Ihnatowicz]], [[Ken Knowlton]], [[Manfred Mohr]], [[Georg Nees]], [[Frieder Nake]], [[Lillian Schwartz]] and [[Alan Sutcliffe]]. The artworks, and the archives of the Society itself, were acquired by the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in 2007.<ref>''Page'', No.63, 2007, pp.1–3.</ref> Works by Sutcliffe are also held by the [[Kunsthalle Bremen]], which included them in an exhibition entitled ''Ex machina: early computer graphics up to 1979''.<ref>Herzogenrath, W. & Nierhoff-Wielk, B., eds.

The Act (codified as {{USC|18|1030}}) governs cases with a compelling federal interest, where computers of the federal government or certain financial institutions are involved, where the crime itself is interstate in nature, or where computers are used in interstate and foreign commerce. It was amended in 1988, 1994, 1996, in 2001 by the [[USA PATRIOT Act]], 2002, and in 2008 by the [[Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act]]. Subsection (b) of the act punishes anyone who not just commits or attempts to commit an offense under the Act, but also those who conspire to do so. ==Protected computers== The CFAA defines “protected computers” under {{USC|18|1030(e)(2)}} to mean a computer: * exclusively for the use of a financial
