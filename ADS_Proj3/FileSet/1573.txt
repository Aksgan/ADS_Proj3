This is seen as important since people who receive free software, but who are not aware that it is free software, will later accept a non-free replacement or will add software which is not free software.<ref>{{cite web |title=Transcript of Stallman speaking at WSIS |url=http://fsfe.org/en/fellows/ciaran/ciaran_s_free_software_notes/transcript_of_rms_at_wsis_on_is_free_open_source_software_the_answer#wsis--importance-of-awareness |publisher=[[Ciarán O'Riordan]] }}</ref> == Legislation == A lot of lobbying work has been done against [[software patent]]s and expansions of copyright law.

After this [[Eric Raymond]] and [[Bruce Perens]], founded [[Open Source Initiative]] OSI, which promotes the term "[[open-source software]]" as an [[alternative term for free software]].

Some users believe that a compromise term encompassing both aspects is ideal, to promote both the user's freedom with the software and also to promote the perceived superiority of an open source development model. === Stallman and Torvalds === The two most prominent people attached to the movement, [[Richard Stallman]] and [[Linus Torvalds]], have deep philosophical differences.{{clarify|date=December 2010}} This has fueled many dramatic news articles, but has not prevented Stallman from using Torvalds' [[Linux kernel|kernel]] or Torvalds from using Stallman's [[GNU General Public License|license]] and [[GNU|operating system]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} == Measures of progress == [[Ohloh]], a [[web service]] founded in 2004 and launched in 2006, monitors the development activity in the [[free software community]], providing detailed [[Software metric|metrics]] and [[quantitative analysis|quantitative analyses]] on the growth and popularity of projects and [[programming language]]s. In January 2010, [[Global Graphics]] completed a survey [http://www.computerworlduk.com/toolbox/open-source/applications/news/index.cfm?newsid=18518] with 400 Chief Information Officers from organisations with over 1000 employees across the US and the UK that showed three quarters (76 per cent) of large organisations use free software across the enterprise with over half (51 per cent) planning to deploy more free software in 2010. == Criticism and controversy == === Is something impeding progress? === Some, such as [[Eric Raymond]], criticise the speed at which the free software movement is progressing, suggesting that temporary compromises should be made for long-term gains. Raymond argues that this could raise awareness of the software and thus increase the free software movement's influence on relevant standards and legislation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/world-domination/world-domination-201.html|title=ESR's "World Domination 201", on the need for more compromise by the free software movement}}</ref> Others, such as Richard Stallman, see the current level of compromise to be the bigger worry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/use-free-software.html|title=RMS on the progress of the movement and his worry about compromise}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.libervis.com/article/richard_stallman_on_world_domination_201|title=Richard Stallman on "World Domination 201"|quote=I cannot agree to that compromise, and my experience teaches me that it won't be temporary. ...
