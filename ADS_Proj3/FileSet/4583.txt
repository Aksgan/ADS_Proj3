name-bearing types. * '''Neotype''' &ndash; A specimen later selected to serve as the single type specimen when an original holotype has been lost or destroyed, or where the original author never cited a specimen. * '''[[Syntype]]''' &ndash; Any of two or more specimens listed in a species description where a holotype was not designated; historically, syntypes were often explicitly designated as such, and under the present [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|Code]] this is a requirement, but modern attempts to publish species description based on syntypes are generally frowned upon by practicing taxonomists, and most are gradually being replaced by [[lectotype]]s. Those that still exist are still considered name-bearing types. * '''[[Lectotype]]''' &ndash; A specimen later selected to serve as the single type specimen for species originally described from a set of syntypes. * '''[[Paralectotype]]''' &ndash; Any additional specimen from among a set of syntypes, after a lectotype has been designated from among them. These are not name-bearing types. * '''[[Hapantotype]]''' &ndash; A special case in [[Protistan]]s where the type consists of two or more specimens of "directly related individuals representing distinct stages in the life cycle"; these are collectively treated as a single entity, and [[lectotype]]s cannot be designated from among them. The various types listed above are necessary because many species were described one or two centuries ago, when a single type specimen, a holotype, was often not designated. Also, types were not always carefully preserved, and intervening events such as wars and fires have resulted in destruction of original type material. The validity of a species name often rests upon the availability of original type specimens; or, if the type cannot be found, or one has never existed, upon the clarity of the description. The '''[[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]]''' has only existed since 1961 when the first edition of the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|Code]] was published. The ICZN does not always demand a type specimen for the historical validity of a species, and many "type-less" species do exist, perhaps the most notable being ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. This example is instructive: the current edition of the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|Code]], Article 75.3, prohibits the designation of a [[neotype]] unless there is "an exceptional need" for "clarifying the taxonomic status" of a species; as the status and identity of ''H. sapiens'' is not questioned, there is no exceptional need for clarification, and "any such neotype designation is invalid" (Article 75.2). Recently some species have been described where the type specimen was released alive back into the wild, such as the [[Bulo Burti Boubou]] (a [[bushshrike]]), described as ''Laniarius liberatus'', in which the species description included DNA sequences from blood and feather samples. Assuming there is no future question as to the status of such a species, the absence of a type specimen does not invalidate the name, but it may be necessary in the future to designate a neotype for such a taxon, should any questions arise. However, in the case of the bushshrike, ornithologists have argued that the specimen was a rare and hitherto unknown [[morph (zoology)|color morph]] of a long-known species, using only the available blood and feather samples. While there is still some debate on the need to deposit actual killed individuals as type specimens, it can be observed that given proper vouchering and storage, tissue samples can be just as valuable even in case disputes about the validity of a species arise. There are many other permutations and variations on terms using the suffix "-type" (e.g., [[allotype]], [[cotype]], [[topotype]], [[generitype]], [[isotype]], [[isoneotype]], etc.) but these are not formally regulated by the Code, and a great many are obsolete and/or idiosyncratic. However, some of these categories can potentially apply to genuine type specimens, such as a neotype; e.g., isotypic/topotypic specimens are preferred to other specimens, when they are available at the time a neotype is chosen (because they are from the same time and/or place as the original type). The term '''fixation''' is used by the Code for the declaration of a name-bearing type, whether by original or subsequent designation. === Type species === {{Main|Type species}} Each genus must have a designated '''type species''' (the term "genotype" was once used for this but has been abandoned because the word has been co-opted for use in [[genetics]], and is much better known in that context). The description of a genus is usually based primarily on its type species, modified and expanded by the features of other included species. The generic name is permanently associated with the name-bearing type of its type species. Ideally, a type species best exemplifies the essential characteristics of the genus to which it belongs, but this is subjective and, ultimately, technically irrelevant, as it is not a requirement of the Code. If the type species proves, upon closer examination, to belong to a pre-existing genus (a common occurrence), then all of the constituent species must be either moved into the pre-existing genus, or disassociated from the original type species and given a new generic name; the old generic name passes into synonymy, and is abandoned, unless there is a pressing need to make an exception (decided case-by-case, via petition to the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]]). === Type genus === {{Main|Type genus}} A '''type genus''' is that genus from which the name of a [[Scientific classification|family]] or subfamily is formed. As with type species, the type genus is not necessarily the most representative, but is usually the earliest described, largest or best known genus. It is not uncommon for the name of a family to be based upon the name of a type genus that has passed into synonymy; the family name does not need to be changed in such a situation. == See also == * [[Nomen nudum]] * [[Nomen dubium]] == References ==<!-- Zootaxa1761:37. --> {{Reflist}} == External links ==<!-- Zootaxa 1761: 37 --> * ''ICZN Code'': [http://www.iczn.org/ International Code of Zoological Nomenclature], the official website * [http://filaman.uni-kiel.de/LarvalBase/Glossary/Glossary.cfm?TermEnglish=type%20species Fishbase] Glossary section. * [http://pages.unibas.ch/museum/microfossils/Colls_NMB/GENERALS/COMTYPES.HTML A compendium of terms] {{DEFAULTSORT:Type}} [[Category:Biology]] [[Category:Taxonomy]]
