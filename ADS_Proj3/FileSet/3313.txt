Intel platform. In addition to being a complete OpenStep implementation, the system was delivered with a complete set of NeXTSTEP libraries for backward compatibility. This was an easy thing to do in OpenStep due to library versioning, and OPENSTEP did not suffer in bloat because of it. ===OPENSTEP Solaris=== In addition to the OPENSTEP/Mach port for SPARC, Sun and NeXT developed an OpenStep compliant set of frameworks to run on Sun's [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] operating system. After developing OPENSTEP Solaris, Sun lost interest in OpenStep and shifted its attention toward Java. As a virtual machine development environment, Java served as a direct competitor to OpenStep. ===OPENSTEP Enterprise=== NeXT also delivered an implementation running on top of Windows NT 4.0 called '''OPENSTEP Enterprise''' (often abbreviated OSE). This was an unintentional demonstration on the true nature of the portability of programs created under the OpenStep specification. Programs for OPENSTEP/Mach could be ported to OSE with little difficulty. This allowed their existing customer base to continue using their tools and applications, but running them inside the Windows system which many of them were in the process of switching to. Never a clean match from the UI perspective—probably due to OPENSTEP's routing of window graphics through the Display Postscript server, which was also ported to Windows—OSE nevertheless managed to work fairly well and allowed OpenStep to exist for perhaps another year. OPENSTEP and OSE had two revisions (and one major one that was never released) before NeXT was purchased by Apple in 1997. ===Rhapsody, Mac OS X Server 1.0=== {{Main|Rhapsody (operating system)|Mac OS X|Mac OS X Server|Cocoa (API)}} After acquiring NeXT, Apple intended to ship [[Rhapsody (operating system)|Rhapsody]] as a reworked version of OPENSTEP/Mach for both the Mac and standard PCs. Rhapsody was OPENSTEP/Mach with a [[Copland (operating system)|Copland]] appearance from [[Mac OS 8]] and support for Java and Apple's own technologies, including ColorSync and QuickTime; it could be regarded as OPENSTEP 5. Two developer versions of Rhapsody were released, known as Developer Preview 1 and 2, these ran on both Intel and PowerPC hardware, though with lacking support for nonstandard hardware. [[Mac OS X Server 1.0]] was the first commercial release of this operating system, and was delivered exclusively for PowerPC Mac hardware. ===Mac OS X 10.0 and later=== After replacing the Display Postscript WindowServer with [[Quartz (graphics layer)|Quartz]], and responding to developers by including better backward compatibility for Mac OS applications through the addition of [[Carbon (API)|Carbon]], Apple released [[Mac OS X]] and [[Mac OS X Server]], starting at version 10.0. Mac OS X's primary programming environment is essentially OpenStep (with certain additions such as XML property lists and URL classes for Internet connections) with Mac OS X ports of the development libraries and tools, now called [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]]. However, Mac OS X diverges from the OpenStep specification to the point that it is now closer to NeXTSTEP as a product. Mac OS X 10.0 could be considered NeXTSTEP 5. (Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6.2), accordingly, would be NeXTSTEP 11.2) The claim is made that Mac OS X has since become the single most popular desktop Unix-like operating system in the world{{Citation needed|reason = Claims of the company itself aren't a trustworthy source.|date=November 2009}}, although Mac OS X is no longer an OpenStep compliant operating system. ===GNUstep=== {{Main|GNUstep}} GNUstep, a [[free software]] implementation of the [[NeXT]] libraries, began at the time of NeXTSTEP, predating OPENSTEP. While OPENSTEP and OSE were purchased by Apple, who effectively ended the commercial development of implementing OpenStep for other platforms, GNUstep is an ongoing open source project aiming to create a portable, [[free software]] implementation of the Cocoa/OPENSTEP libraries. GNUstep also features a fully functional development environment, reimplementations of some of the newer innovations from Mac OS X's [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]] framework, as well as its own extensions to the API. ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.gnustep.org/resources/OpenStepSpec/OpenStepSpec.html OpenStep Specification] *[http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/coll/116.1 SUNs Workshop OpenStep AnswerBook] *[http://rixstep.com/2/0/ The NeXTonian] *[http://nextcomputers.org NeXTComputers.org] {{NeXT Computer}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Openstep}} [[Category:Application programming interfaces]] [[Category:BSD]] [[Category:Mac OS X APIs]] [[de:OpenStep]] [[fr:OPENSTEP]] [[ko:오픈스텝]] [[ja:OPENSTEP]] [[pl:OpenStep]] [[pt:OpenStep]] [[ru:OpenStep]] [[sv:OPENSTEP]] [[zh:OpenStep]]</text> </page> <page> <id>27452</id> <title>OpenType</title> <text>{{Infobox file format | name = OpenType | icon = | logo = | screenshot = | caption = | extension = .otf, .ttf | mime = | type code = OTTO | uniform type = public.opentype-font | magic = | owner = [[Microsoft]] & [[Adobe Systems]] | released = <!-- {{Start date|YYYY|mm|dd|df=yes}} --> | latest release version = 1.6<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/typography/SpecificationsOverview.mspx |title=Microsoft typography - Specifications: overview |accessdate=2010-02-28}}</ref> | latest release date = <!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|mm|dd|df=yes}} --> | genre = [[typeface|Font file]] | container for = | contained by = | extended from = [[TrueType]], [[PostScript fonts]] | extended to = | standard = ISO/IEC 14496-22:2009 | free = | url = }} '''OpenType''' is a format for scalable [[computer font]]s. It was built on its predecessor [[TrueType]], retaining TrueType's basic structure and adding many intricate data structures for prescribing [[typography|typographic]] behavior. OpenType is a registered trademark of [[Microsoft Corporation]].<ref name="OFF-chiariglione" /> The specification germinated at Microsoft, with [[Adobe Systems]] also contributing by the time of the public announcement in 1996. The specification continues to be developed actively and is presently migrating to an open format. Because of wide availability and typographic flexibility, including provisions for handling the diverse behaviors of all the world's [[writing system]]s, OpenType fonts are used commonly today on the major computer platforms. ==History== OpenType is intended by Microsoft and Adobe to supersede both the [[TrueType]] and the [[Type 1 font|Type 1]] ("[[PostScript]]") font formats. TrueType was developed by [[Apple Computer]] and licensed to Microsoft, and PostScript and the Type 1 format were developed by Adobe. Needing a more expressive font format to handle fine typography and the complex behavior of many of the world's writing systems, the two companies combined the underlying technologies of both formats and added new extensions intended to address the limitations. OpenType's origins date to Microsoft's attempt to license Apple's advanced typography technology, "GX Typography" in the early 1990s. Those negotiations failed, motivating Microsoft to
