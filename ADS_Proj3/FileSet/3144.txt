a problem can be thought of a mental map of the logical dependencies among propositions. In other words, the knowledgebase amounts to a formal logical argument in the classical sense.<ref> Halpern, D.F. 1989. Thought and Knowledge, An Introduction to Critical Thinking. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. 517 p.</ref> == When logic meets graphics == [[Cognitive theory]] suggests that human beings have two fundamental modes of reasoning: logical (albeit however informally some folks may do that when left to their own devices) and spatial.<ref> Stillings, N.A., M.H. Feinstein, J.L. Garfield, [et al.]. 1991. Cognitive Science: An Introduction. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. 533 p.</ref> Interesting things happen when logic is implemented graphically. First, the knowledge of individual subject-matter experts engaged in [[knowledge engineering]] often is not fully integrated when dealing with complex problems, at least initially. Rather, this knowledge may exist in a somewhat more loosely organized state, a sort of knowledge soup with chunks of knowledge floating about in it. A common observation of knowledge engineers experienced in graphically designing [[knowledgebase]]s is that the process of constructing a graphic representation of problem-solving knowledge in a formal logical framework seems to be synergistic, with new insights into the expert’s knowledge emerging as the process unfolds. (At the moment, this assertion is largely anecdotal. Contributors to this article need to find a suitable way to document this point, because it is actually a rather important finding not simply limited to NetWeaver, but knowledge engineering more broadly). Second, synergies similar to those observed in organizing the reasoning of individual subject-matter experts also can occur in [[knowledge engineering]] projects that require the interaction of multiple disciplines. For example, many different kinds of specialists may be involved in evaluating the overall health of a watershed. Use of a formal logic system, with well defined syntax and semantics, allows specialists’ representation of their problem solving approach to be expressed in a common language, which in turn facilitates understanding of how all the various perspectives of the different specialists fit together. == About NetWeaver knowledgebases == A NetWeaver knowledgebase has been defined by the developers as a network of networks (Miller and Saunders 2002). Each network corresponds to a topic of interest in the problem being evaluated by the knowledgebase. NetWeaver knowledgebases are object-based. There are two basic types of objects: networks, and data links, each of which is represented in the logic structure by a programming object which has both state and behavior. The NetWeaver engine is a Windows dynamic link library (DLL) developed by Rules of Thumb, Inc. (North East, PA). NetWeaver Developer is an interface to the engine that is used for designing knowledgebases. === Logic networks === A knowledgebase represents knowledge about how to solve a problem in terms of the topics of interest in the problem domain, and relations among these topics. Each logic network in a NetWeaver knowledge base represents a proposition about the condition of some ecosystem state or process. * State - The key state variable of a logic network is its truth value which expresses the degree to which evidence from antecedent networks and data links support or refute the proposition. Logically, network A is said to be antecedent to network B if B depends upon A because network A must be evaluated before network B can be evaluated. * Behavior - The basic function of a network is to evaluate the truth of its proposition. NetWeaver networks have three basic behaviors related to this function: ** They query their antecedants to determine the latters' state. ** They evaluate their own state, given the state of their antecedants. ** They inform higher level networks that depend on them about their state. === Data links === A data link is an elementary dependency network with slightly modified behavior. * State - Like a network, a data link may evaluate to a truth value, given a data input. A data link may also hold a data value that is subsequently transformed by mathematical operations defined for a calculated data link. * Behavior: ** In NetWeaver Developer, data links prompt the user for data input. ** On receipt of data, data links evaluate their state, given the data input (simple data links), or pass the data value to a special data link that performs some transformation of input data (calculated data link). ** They inform higher level networks that depend on them about their state. === Truth values === The truth value is the basic state variable of networks and data links. It expresses an observation's degree of membership in a set. Evaluations of degree of set membership are quantified in the semantics of [[fuzzy logic]].<ref>Zadeh, L.A. 1965. Fuzzy sets.

Information Science 9: 43-80.</ref> Equivalently, think of the truth value metric as expressing the degree to which evidence supports the proposition of the network or data link; in EMDS, the symbology for maps displaying network truth values is based on the concept of strength of evidence. For additional discussion on this topic, see Interpretation of Truth Values. Data links are frequently used to read a datum and evaluate its degree of membership in a concept that is quantified in a fuzzy argument (an argument that quantifies fuzzy set membership). Thus, in a data link the argument is a mathematical statement of a proposition. Some simple examples include: * If the datum fully satisfies the argument, then the truth value of the data link is 1 (full support). * If the datum is fully contrary to the argument, then the truth value of the data link is -1
