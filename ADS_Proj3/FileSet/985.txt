This yielded [[military intelligence]] which, along with that from other decrypted [[Axis powers|Axis]] radio and [[teleprinter]] transmissions, was given the codename ''[[Ultra]]''. Enigma [[cryptanalysis]] contributed the majority of Ultra intelligence, which was considered by western Supreme Allied Commander [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to have been "decisive" to Allied victory in World War II.<ref>[[F.W.

The German Navy ''([[Reichsmarine]]'' and ''[[Kriegsmarine]])'' used better procedures than most. It was the poor operating procedures that allowed the cipher to be broken. The German plugboard-equipped Enigma that would become the [[Third Reich|Third Reich's]] principal [[cryptography|crypto-system]] was reconstructed—with the aid of French-supplied intelligence material that had been obtained from a German spy—by the [[Polish General Staff|Polish General Staff's]] [[Biuro Szyfrów|Cipher Bureau]] in December 1932. From then until the outbreak of [[World War II]], the Poles held a monopoly in decrypting German military Enigma ciphers. In July 1939, as war drew near, the Polish Cipher Bureau initiated the French and British into its Enigma-breaking techniques and technology at a conference held in [[Warsaw]]. From this beginning, the British [[Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School (GCCS)|Government Code and Cypher School]] at [[Bletchley Park]] built up an extensive cryptanalytic facility that used manual methods and machines — "[[Bombe]]s". The methods used to break Enigma messages relied heavily on the poor design and implementation of German security procedures. Initially, the decryption was mainly of ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' and a few Army messages, as the German Navy employed much more secure procedures for using Enigma. [[Alan Turing]], a [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] mathematician and logician, provided much of the original thinking that led to the design of the Bombes and the eventual breaking of naval Enigma. However, when the German Navy introduced for its [[U-boats]] an Enigma version with a fourth rotor, there was a prolonged period when those messages could not be decrypted. With the capture of relevant cipher keys and the use of much faster [[Bombe#US Navy Bombe|U.S. Navy Bombes]], regular, rapid reading of German naval messages resumed. {{EnigmaSeries}} ==General principles== {{main|Cryptanalysis}} The Enigma machines produced a [[Polyalphabetic cipher|polyalphabetic substitution cipher]]. The early monoalphabetic [[Substitution cipher|substitution ciphers]] had been superseded by polyalphabetic ones, such as the [[Vigenère cipher]] in the 16th century. They had been considered to be completely secure (''le chiffre indéchiffrable''—"the indecipherable cipher") until [[Charles Babbage]] showed that, like monoalphabetic ones, they could be broken by [[frequency analysis]].<ref>[[Simon Singh|Singh]] (1999) pp. 45-78</ref> During [[World War I]], inventors in several countries realized that a purely random key sequence, containing no repetitive pattern, would make a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, in principle, unbreakable.<ref>[[Simon Singh|Singh]] (1999) p. 116 </ref> This led to the development of [[rotor cipher machine]]s which alter each character in the [[plaintext]] to produce the [[ciphertext]], by means of a scrambler comprising a set of ''rotors'' (or ''wheels'') that alter the electrical path from character to character, between the input device (in Enigma, a keyboard) and the output device (in Enigma, a lampboard). This constant altering of the electrical pathway produces a very long period before the pattern—the [[Key (cryptography)|key sequence]] or [[substitution alphabet]]—repeats. Deciphering enciphered messages involves three stages.<ref>Churchhouse (2002) p. 4</ref> Firstly, there is the ''identification'' of the system in use, in this case Enigma. Secondly, ''breaking'' the system by establishing exactly how encryption takes place, and thirdly, ''setting'', which involves finding the way that the machine was set up for an individual message, ''i.e.'' the ''message key''. Although [[Kerckhoffs' principle]] states that a [[cryptosystem]] should be secure even when everything about the system except the key is known to the enemy, the internal wiring of machines such as Enigma has so many possibilities, that this second stage is a very important aspect of breaking them. ==The Enigma machines== {{main|Enigma machine}} [[Image:EnigmaMachineLabeled.jpg|thumb|The [[Enigma machine]] was used commercially from the early 1920s and was adopted by the militaries and governments of various
