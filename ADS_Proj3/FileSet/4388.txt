the "addictive online play" and commented on the "great variety of modes". They also loved the "classic Tetris gameplay" and thought it was "good value for your points." However they did mark it down as they thought the "Balance Board mode was a bit gimmicky."<ref>[http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/article.php?id=6212 The Official Nintendo Magazine Review]</ref> It was nominated for multiple Wii-specific awards by IGN in its 2008 video game awards, including Best WiiWare Game<ref name="ignwiiware">{{cite web |title=IGN Wii: Best WiiWare Game 2008 |url=http://bestof.ign.com/2008/wii/20.html |publisher=[[IGN]].com |accessdate=2008-12-19 |date=2008-12-18}}</ref> and Best Puzzle Game.<ref name="ignpuzzle">{{cite web |title=IGN Wii: Best Puzzle Game 2008 |url=http://bestof.ign.com/2008/wii/5.html |publisher=[[IGN]].com |accessdate=2008-12-19 |date=2008-12-18}}</ref> ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.tetrisparty.com/ ''Tetris Party'' website] {{puzzle-videogame-stub}} {{party-videogame-stub}} {{Tetris}} [[Category:2008 video games]] [[Category:Hudson Soft games]] [[Category:DSiWare games]] [[Category:WiiWare games]] [[Category:Tetris]] [[Category:Nintendo DS games]] [[Category:Wii Wi-Fi games]] [[Category:Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection games]] [[Category:Wii games]] [[Category:Wii Balance Board games]] [[fr:Tetris Party]] [[ja:テトリスパーティ]]</text> </page> <page> <id>37148</id> <title>Tetromino</title> <text>[[File:All 5 free tetrominoes.svg|thumb|200px|The 5 free tetrominoes]] A '''tetromino''', also called a tetramino or tetrimino<ref>Tetris Friends, Tetris Holding; http://www.tetrisfriends.com/help/tips_beginner.php#movingtetriminos</ref>, is a geometric shape composed of four [[square (geometry)|square]]s, connected [[orthogonality|orthogonally]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Golomb |first=Solomon W. |authorlink=Solomon W.

The corresponding [[polycube]], called a '''tetracube''', is a geometric shape composed of four [[cube]]s connected orthogonally. A popular use of tetrominoes is in the [[video game]] ''[[Tetris]]''. == The seven tetrominoes == Ordinarily, polyominoes are discussed in their ''[[Polyomino#Free, one-sided, and fixed polyominoes|free]]'' forms, which treat [[rotation (mathematics)|rotations]] and [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]s in two [[dimension]]s as [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]]. In that case, there are five unique tetrominoes. However, due to the overwhelming association of tetrominoes with ''Tetris'', which uses ''one-sided'' tetrominoes (making reflections distinct but all rotations congruent), people recognize seven distinct tetrominoes: * [[File:Tetromino I.svg|71px]] I (also called "stick", "straight", "long", "line"): four blocks in a straight line * [[File:Tetromino J.svg|54px]] J (also called "inverted L" or "Gamma"): a row of three blocks with one added below the right side. ** [[File:Tetromino L.svg|56px]] L (also called "gun"<ref name="tetris_is_hard">Demaine, Hohenberger, and Liben-Nowell. [http://www.cs.carleton.edu/faculty/dlibenno/papers/tetris/tetris-short.pdf Tetris Is Hard, Even to Approximate].</ref>): a row of three blocks with one added below the left side. This piece is a reflection of J but cannot be rotated into J in two dimensions; this is an example of [[chirality (mathematics)|chirality]]. However, in three [[dimension]]s, this piece is identical to J. * [[File:Tetromino O.svg|39px]] O (also called "square",<ref name="tetris_is_hard" /> "package", "block"): four blocks in a 2×2 square. * [[File:Tetromino S.svg|56px]] S (also called "inverted N", "reverse squiggly", "s-zigzag"): two stacked horizontal dominoes with the top one offset to the right ** [[File:Tetromino Z.svg|53px]] Z (also called "N", "skew", "snake",<ref name="tetris_is_hard" /> "squiggly", "z-zigzag"): two stacked horizontal dominoes with the top one offset to the left. The same symmetry properties as with L and J apply with S and Z. * [[File:Tetromino T.svg|54px]] T: a row of three blocks with one added below the center. The ''free tetrominoes'' additionally treat reflection (rotation in the third dimension) as equivalent. This eliminates J and Z, leaving five free tetrominoes: I, L, O, S (also called N or Z), and T. <!-- spells "I lost"? --> The ''fixed tetrominoes'' do not allow rotation or reflection. There are 2 distinct fixed I tetrominoes, four J, four L, one O, two S, four T, and two Z, for a total of 19 fixed tetrominoes. == Tiling the rectangle and filling the box with 2D pieces == [[File:Tetramino.png|thumb|The five free tetrominoes, top to bottom I, O, Z, T, L, marked with light and dark squares.]] Although a complete set of free tetrominoes has a total of 20 squares, and a complete set of one-sided tetrominoes has 28 squares, it is not possible to pack them into a rectangle, like [[hexomino]]es and unlike [[pentomino]]es. The proof is that a rectangle covered with a checkerboard pattern will have 10 or 14 each of light and dark squares, while a complete set of free tetrominoes (pictured) has 11 light squares and 9 dark squares, and a complete set of one-sided tetrominoes has 15 light squares and 13 dark squares. A [[Multiset|bag]] including two of each free tetromino, which has a total area of 40 squares, can fit in 4&times;10 and 5&times;8 cell rectangles. Likewise, two sets of one-sided tetrominoes can be fit to a rectangle in more than one way. The corresponding tetracubes can also fit in 2&times;4&times;5 and 2&times;2&times;10 boxes. 5&times;8 rectangle :[[File:Tetromino Tiling 5x8.svg|160px]] 4&times;10 rectangle :[[File:Tetromino Tiling 4x10.svg|200px]] 2&times;4&times;5 box <pre> layer 1 : layer 2 Z Z T t I : l T T T i L Z Z t I : l l l t i L z z t I : o o z z i L L O O I : o o O O i </pre> 2&times;2&times;10 box <pre> layer 1 : layer 2 L L L z z Z Z T O O : o o z z Z Z T T T l L I I I I t t t O O : o o i i i i t l l l </pre> == Etymology == The name "tetromino" is a combination of the [[prefix]] ''tetra-'' "four" (from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|τετρα-}}), and "[[domino]]". == Tetracubes == Each tetromino has a corresponding tetracube, which is the tetromino [[extrusion|extruded]] by one unit. Three more tetracubes are possible, all created by placing a unit cube on the bent [[Tromino|tricube]]: * [[File:Tetracube l-screw.svg|39px]] Left screw: unit cube placed on top of anticlockwise side. [[Chirality (mathematics)|Chiral]] in 3D. * [[File:Tetracube r-screw.svg|42px]] Right screw: unit cube placed on top of clockwise side. Chiral in 3D. * [[File:Tetracube branch.svg|41px]] Branch: unit cube placed on bend. Not chiral in 3D. However, going to three dimensions means that rotation is allowed in three dimensions. Thus, the two L-shaped pieces are now equivalent, as are the two S-shaped pieces. == Filling the box with 3D pieces == In 3D,
