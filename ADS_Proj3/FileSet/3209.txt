Air Research''' ({{lang-no|Norsk Institutt for luftforskning}}) or '''NILU''' is one of the leading specialized scientific laboratories in [[Europe]] researching issues related to [[air pollution]], [[climate change]] and health. NILU has a staff of scientists, engineers and technicians with specialized expertise for working on air pollution problems. The staff do more than two hundred projects annually for [[research council]]s, industries, international banks and local, national and international authorities and organizations. Its director since 2009 is [[Kari Nygaard]]. == Fields of work == NILU was founded in 1969 and the institute conducts environmental research with emphasis on the sources of [[air pollution]] and on [[Atmospheric dispersion modeling|air pollution dispersion]],<ref>{{cite book | author=Turner, D.B. | title=Workbook of atmospheric dispersion estimates: an introduction to dispersion modeling| edition=2nd Edition| publisher=CRC Press | year=1994 | isbn=1-56670-023-X }} [http://www.crcpress.com/shopping_cart/products/product_detail.asp?sku=L1023&parent_id=&pc= www.crcpress.com]</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Beychok, Milton R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th Edition|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}} [http://www.air-dispersion.com www.air-dispersion.com]</ref> transport, transformation and [[Deposition (Aerosol physics)|deposition]]. It is also involved in the assessment of the effects of [[pollution]] on [[ecosystem]]s, [[human health]] and materials. Integrated environmental assessments and optimal abatement strategy planning has been a field of priority during the last few years. [[Evaluation|Assessment]] of transboundary transport of [[air pollutant]]s, [[acid rain]] and global [[air quality]] are important tasks. NILU has the responsibility as a national research institution for air pollution in [[Norway]] and is also being used as an international air pollution expert by the [[World Bank]], the [[Asian Development Bank]] and the [[World Health Organization]]. NILU has developed an automatic [[surveillance]] program for [[air quality]] in cities and background areas. NILU have specialized in computerized automatic air pollution [[surveillance]], planning and optimal abatement strategy planning. This AirQUIS system is an air pollution management and planning system designed for managers and decision-makers. == Location == NILU's head office is at [[Kjeller]] on the outskirt of [[Oslo]] in Norway. A specialised office for [[Arctic]] related matters is an integrated part of the [[Polar Environmental Centre]] in [[Troms√∏]]. NILU also has offices in [[Abu Dhabi]] (the United Arab Emirates) and [[Katowice]] (NILU Polska). ==References== {{reflist}} ==See also== *[[Atmospheric dispersion modeling]] *[[List of atmospheric dispersion models]] *[[Czech Hydrometeorological Institute]] *[[Finnish Meteorological Institute]] *[[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] *[[National Environmental Research Institute of Denmark]] *[[Roadway air dispersion modeling]] *[[SMHI]] *[[TA Luft]] *[[UK Atmospheric Dispersion Modelling Liaison Committee]] *[[UK Dispersion Modelling Bureau]] *[[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research]] ==External links== *[http://www.nilu.no/index.cfm?lan_id=3 wwww.nilu.no (English edition)] *[http://www.airquis.com The AirQUIS system] {{coord missing|Norway}} [[Category:Air dispersion modeling]] [[Category:Air pollution]] [[Category:Research institutes in Norway]] [[Category:Foundations based in Norway]] [[Category:Skedsmo]] [[Category:Environmental research institutes]] [[no:Norsk institutt for luftforskning]] [[nn:Norsk institutt for luftforskning]]</text> </page> <page> <id>26698</id> <title>Notary public</title> <text>[[Image:NYS-Notary-Seal.jpg|thumb|An [[Embossing (paper)|emboss]]ed foil Notary Seal from the [[New York|State of New York]].]] A '''notary public''' (or '''notary''' or '''public notary''') is a public officer constituted by law to serve the public in non-contentious matters usually concerned with estates, deeds, powers-of-attorney, and foreign and international business. A notary's main functions are to administer [[oath]]s and affirmations, take [[affidavit]]s and [[statutory declaration]]s, [[witness]] and authenticate the execution of certain classes of documents, take acknowledgments of deeds and other conveyances, protest notes and bills of exchange, provide notice of foreign drafts, prepare marine protests in cases of damage, provide exemplifications and notarial copies, and perform certain other official acts depending on the [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]].<ref>"Notaries Public", ''Montgomery County, Alabama Probate Judge'': [http://www.mc-ala.org/Home/Elected%20Officials/Probate%20Judge/probate_notaries.html], retrieved on 20 January 2009.</ref> Any such act is known as a '''notarization'''. The term ''notary public'' only refers to [[common law|common-law]] notaries and should not be confused with [[Civil law notary|civil-law notaries]]. With the exceptions of [[Louisiana]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Quebec]], whose private law is based on [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]], and [[British Columbia]], whose notarial tradition stems from [[scrivener]] notary practice, a notary public in the rest of the [[United States]] and most of [[Canada]] has powers that are far more limited than those of civil-law or other common-law notaries, both of whom are qualified lawyers admitted to the bar: such notaries may be referred to as '''notaries-at-law''' or lawyer notaries. Therefore, at common law, notarial service is distinct from the [[practice of law]], and giving legal advice and preparing legal instruments is forbidden to '''lay notaries'''. ==Overview== Notaries are appointed by a government authority, such as a court or lieutenant governor, or by a regulating body often known as a Society or Faculty of Notaries Public. For a notary-at-law, an appointment is usually for life, but lay notaries are commissioned for a briefer term with the possibility of renewal. In most common-law countries, appointments and their number for a given notarial district are highly regulated. However, since the majority of American notaries are lay persons who provide officially required services, commission numbers are not regulated in America, which is part of the reason why there are far more notaries in the United States than in other countries (4.5 million<ref> {{cite web| url=http://www.nationalnotary.org/about/index.cfm?text=aboutHistory| authorlink=National Notary Association| title=History of the NNA| accessdate=9 July 2006}} </ref> vs. approx. 740 in [[England and Wales]]). Furthermore, all U.S. and some Canadian notarial functions are applied to domestic affairs and documents, and fully systematized attestations of signatures and acknowledgment of deeds are a universal requirement for document authentication. By contrast, outside North American common-law [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]s, notarial practice is restricted to international legal matters or where a foreign jurisdiction is involved,<ref>[http://www.warners-solicitors.co.uk/business-notary.html ''Notary'']. (2008). Kent, England: Warners Law LLP. Retrieved on 22 January 2009.</ref> and almost all notaries are also qualified lawyers. For the purposes of authentication, most countries require commercial or personal documents which originate from or are signed in another country to be notarized before they can be used or officially recorded or before they can have any legal effect. To these documents a notary affixes a '''notarial certificate''' which attests to the execution of the document, usually by the person who appears before the notary, known as an '''appearer''' or '''constituent''' (U.S.). In places where notaries-at-law are the norm, a notary may also draft legal instruments known as '''notarial [[Act (document)|acts]]''' which have probative value and executory force as would any lawyer's writing.
