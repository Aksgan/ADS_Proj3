first of the bombes.<ref name = MahonP22 /> However, the numerous possible rotor sequences, together with a paucity of usable cribs, made the methods used against the Army and Air Force Enigma messages of very limited value. Turing had devised a development of the [[Clock (cryptography)|clock method]] invented by the Polish cryptanalyst [[Jerzy Różycki]] at the end of 1939. This came to be known as "[[Banburismus]]". Turing said that at that stage "I was not sure that it would work in practice, and was not in fact sure until some days had actually broken".<ref>Mahon (1945) p. 14</ref> Banburismus used a statistical scoring system and large cards printed in Banbury (hence its name), to reduce the number of rotor sequences to be tried on the bombes. In practice the 336 possible rotors and sequences could be reduced to perhaps 18 to be run on the bombes.<ref>Alexander (''c''. 1945) "Background" Para. 42</ref> Knowledge of the bigrams was essential for Banburismus and building up the tables took a long time. This lack of visible progress led to [[Francis Birch (cryptographer)|Frank Birch]], head of the Naval Section to write on 21 August 1940 to [[Edward Travis]] Deputy Director of Bletchley Park: {{quote|"I'm worried about Naval Enigma. I've been worried for a long time, but haven't liked to say as much.... Turing and Twinn are like people waiting for a miracle, without believing in miracles....."<ref>Mahon (1945) p. 2</ref>}} Schemes for capturing Enigma material were conceived including, in September 1940, [[Operation Ruthless]] by Lieutenant Commander [[Ian Fleming]] (author of the [[James Bond]] novels). When this was cancelled, Birch told Fleming that "Turing and Twinn came to me like undertakers cheated of a nice corpse....".<ref>{{ Citation | last = Batey | first = Mavis | publication-date = 2008 | title = From Bletchley with Love | publication-place = Milton Keynes | publisher = Bletchley Park Trust | pages = 4–6 | isbn = 978-1-906723-04-0 }}</ref> A major advance came through [[Operation Claymore]], a [[British Commandos|commando]] raid on the [[Lofoten Islands]] on 4 March 1941. The German [[Naval trawler|armed trawler]] ''Krebs'' was captured, including the complete Enigma keys for February, but no bigram tables or K-book. However, the material was sufficient to reconstruct the bigram tables by "EINS-ing", and by late March they were almost complete.<ref>Mahon (1945) p. 26</ref> Banburismus then started to become extremely useful. Hut 8 was expanded and moved to 24-hour working, and a crib room was established. The story of Banburismus for the next two years was one of improving methods, of struggling to get sufficient staff, and of a steady growth in the relative and absolute importance of cribbing as the increasing numbers of bombes made the running of cribs ever faster.<ref>Alexander (''c''. 1946) Ch. III Para. 5</ref> Of value in this period were further "pinches" such as those from the [[German weather ship Lauenburg#The weather ships and Enigma|German weather ships]] ''München'' and ''Lauenburg'' and the submarines ''[[German submarine U-110 (1940)|U-110]]'' and ''[[German submarine U-559#The sinking of U-559|U-559]]''. Despite the introduction of the 4-rotor Enigma for Atlantic U-boats, the analysis of traffic enciphered with the 3-rotor Enigma proved of immense value to the Allied navies. Banburismus was used until July 1943, when it became more efficient to use the many more bombes that had become available. ====German Navy 4-rotor Enigma==== [[Image:Bletchley Park Naval Enigma IMG 3604.JPG|thumb|The German Navy 4-rotor [[Enigma machine]] (M4) which was introduced for U-boat traffic on 1 February 1942.]] On 1 February 1942, the Enigma messages to and from Atlantic U-boats which Bletchley Park called ''Shark'' became significantly different from the rest of the traffic which they called ''Dolphin''.<ref>Alexander (''c''. 1945) Ch. III Para. 20</ref> This was because a new Enigma version had been brought into use. It was a development of the 3-rotor Enigma with the reflector replaced by a thin rotor and a thin reflector. Eventually, there were two fourth-position rotors that were called Beta and Gamma and two thin reflectors, Bruno and Caesar which could be used in any combination. These rotors were not advanced by the rotor to their right, in the way that rotors I to VIII were. The introduction of the fourth rotor did not catch Bletchley Park by surprise, because captured material dated January 1941 had made reference to its development as an adaptation of the 3-rotor machine, with the fourth rotor wheel to be a reflector wheel.<ref>Mahon (1945) p. 62</ref> Indeed, because of operator errors, the wiring of the new fourth rotor had already been worked out. This major challenge could not be met by using existing methods and resources for a number of reasons. # The work on the Shark cipher would have to be independent of the continuing work on messages in the Dolphin cipher. # Breaking Shark on 3-rotor bombes would have taken 50 to 100 times as long as an average Air Force or Army job. # U-boat cribs at this time were extremely poor.<ref>Alexander (''c''. 1946) Ch. III Para. 21</ref> It seemed, therefore, that effective, fast, 4-rotor bombes were the only way forward. This was an immense problem and it gave a great deal of trouble. Work on a high speed machine had been started by [[Charles Wynn-Williams|Wynne-Williams]] of the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment|TRE]] late in 1941 and some nine months later [[Harold Keen]] of [[British Tabulating Machine Company|BTM]] started work independently. Early in 1942, Bletchley Park were a long way from possessing a high speed machine of any sort.<ref>Mahon (1945) p. 63</ref> Eventually, after a long period of being unable to decipher U-boat messages, a source of cribs was found. This was the ''Kurzsignalen'' (Short Signal Code) which was used in minimize the duration of transmissions, to reduce the risk of them being located by [[direction finding]] techniques. The messages were only 22 characters long and were used to report sightings of possible Allied targets.<ref>{{ Citation | last = Sale | first = Tony | author-link = Anthony Sale | title = The Breaking of German Naval Enigma: U Boat Contact Signals | series = Codes and
