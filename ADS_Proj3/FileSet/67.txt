speed; or respectively classified as the linear and nonlinear fields. Currently, the convective and pressure fluxes are formulated using the eigenvalues of the flux Jacobian matrices. The method was originally proposed by Liou and Steffen <ref>Liou, M.-S. and Steffen, C., “A New Flux Splitting Scheme,” J. Comput. Phys., Vol. 107, 23-39, 1993.</ref> for the typical compressible aerodynamic flows, and later substantially improved in <ref name="firstName">Liou, M.-S., “A Sequel to AUSM: AUSM+” J. Comput.

Scientific Computing, Vol. 18, 633-657, 1997.</ref> to yield a more accurate and robust version. To extend its capabilities, it has been further developed in <ref name="secondName">Liou, M.-S., “A Sequel to AUSM, Part II: AUSM+-up” J. Comput.

The main features are: *accurate capturing of shock and contact discontinuities *entropy-satisfying solution *positivity-preserving solution *algorithmic simplicity (not requiring explicit eigen-structure of the flux Jacobian matrices) and straightforward extension to additional conservation laws *free of “carbuncle” phenomena *uniform accuracy and convergence rate for all Mach numbers. Since the method does not specifically require eigenvectors, it is especially attractive for the system whose eigen-structure is not known explicitly, as the case of two-fluid equations for multiphase flow. ==Applications== The AUSM has been employed to solve a wide range of problems, low-Mach to [[hypersonic]] [[aerodynamics]], large eddy simulation and aero-acoustics<ref>Mary, I. and Sagaut, P., “Large Eddy Simulation of Flow Around an Airfoil Near Stall,” AIAA J., Vol. 40, 1139-1145, 2002.</ref><ref>Manoha, E., Redonnet, S., Terracol, M., and Guenanff, G., “Numerical Simulation of Aerodynamics Noise,” ECCOMAS 24–28 July 2004.</ref>, direct numerical simulation<ref>Billet, G. and Louedin, O., “Adaptive Limiters for Improving the Accuracy of the MUSCL Approach for Unsteady Flows,” J.
