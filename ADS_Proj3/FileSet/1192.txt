Fabbers make three-dimensional, solid objects that can be used as [[Physical model|model]]s, as [[prototype]]s, or as delivered products. They are widely used by [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]] for these purposes. Fabbers use a wide range of techniques to make products from a wide range of materials. The quality of these materials and the precision of fabrication can be a major constraint on functional applications.[http://www.ennex.com/~fabbers/intro.asp] Proposed [[nanofactory|nanofactories]] would be fabbers that employ arrays of nanoscale machines to assemble macroscopic products from molecular feedstocks. This level of control would enable production of high-performance materials that form structures of nearly perfect precision. The term "fabber" is also used to refer to hypothetical devices that would be capable of [[Universal assembler|Universal Fabrication]]. Given a sufficiently detailed set of plans, power and the correct raw feedstocks, a universal fabber could produce any manufacturable item, including a copy of itself. No proposed machine would be universal in the common sense of the word, since not all physical structures can be manufactured{{WTF}}. ==See also== * [[3D printing]] * [[Additive manufacturing]] * [[Desktop manufacturing]] * [[Direct digital manufacturing]] * [[Direct metal laser sintering]] * [[Fab lab]] * [[Fused deposition modeling]] * [[Instant manufacturing]], also known as "direct manufacturing" or "on-demand manufacturing" * [[Rapid manufacturing]] * [[Rapid prototyping]] * [[RepRap Project]] * [[Selective laser sintering]] * [[Solid freeform fabrication]] * [[Stereolithography]] ==External links== {{External links|date=August 2010}} *[http://www.l-vma.org The Low-Volume Manufacturers Association] Features, News & Profiles of Companies and Executives *[http://www.fabathome.org Fab@Home Personal Desktop Fabber Kit] *[http://www.ennex.com/~fabbers/intro.asp Commercial fabber's list] *[http://reprap.org The RepRap open-source self-replicating digital fabricator] *[http://www.phorecast.com/2008/04/13/phorecast-podcast-no-05-%e2%80%93-evan-malone-fabhome/ Podcast interview with Evan Malone about Fab@Home] April 2008. *[http://www.ennex.com/~fabbers/intro.asp Intro to fabbers] *[http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/002398.html worldchanging] *[http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2006/11/make_your_own_f.html Discussion at Make magazine's site] *[http://www.newscientisttech.com/article/dn10922-desktop-fabricator-may-kickstart-home-revolution.html New Scientist: Desktop Fabricator May Kickstart Home Revolution] *[http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_PSRGPGR economist story] *[http://quienentravuelve.blogspot.com/2007/08/fabbing-impresin-en-3d.html Fabbing · Impresión en 3D] {{Language icon|es|Spanish}} *[http://www.slideshare.net/fablablima/fab-lablima-35 Digital Fabrication: Computer Aided Machining and Cutting] {{DEFAULTSORT:Digital Fabricator}} [[Category:Fictional technology]] [[Category:Solid freeform fabrication]] {{tech-stub}} [[da:Digital fabrikator]] [[de:Digital Fabricator]] [[ml:ഡിജിറ്റൽ ഫാബ്രിക്കേറ്റർ]]</text> </page> <page> <id>10446</id> <title>Digital mammography</title> <text>'''Digital mammography''' is a specialized form of [[mammography]] that uses digital receptors and computers instead of [[x-ray]] film to help examine [[breast]] tissue for [[breast cancer]].<ref name=i2>http://www.imaginis.com/breast-health/digital-mammography-2</ref> The electrical signals can be read on computer screens, permitting more manipulation of images to theoretically allow [[radiologist]]s to more clearly view the results.<ref>http://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/info.cfm?pg=mammo</ref><ref name=i2/> Digital mammography may be "spot view", for breast [[biopsy]], or "full field" (FFDM) for [[Cancer screening|screening]].<ref name=i2/> While radiologists had hoped for more marked improvement, the effectiveness of digital mammography was found comparable to traditional x-ray methods in 2004, though there may be reduced radiation with the technique and it may lead to fewer retests.<ref name=i2/> Specifically, it performs no better than film for post-menopausal women, who represent more than three-quarters of women with breast cancer.<ref name=Sulik /> Digital mammography is a [[NASA spin-off]], utilizing technology developed for the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].<ref>http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/363454main_medical_flyer.pdf</ref> ==Prevalence== As of 2007, about 8% of American screening centers used digital mammography.

It can refer to [[discrete-time signal]]s that have a discrete number of levels, for example a [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampled]] and [[quantification|quantified]] analog signal, or to the continuous-time waveform signals in a [[digital]] system, representing a [[bit-stream]]. In the first case, a signal that is generated by means of a [[digital modulation]] method which is considered as converted to an analogue signal, while it is considered as a digital signal in the second case. ==Waveforms in digital systems== [[Image:S digital.PNG|framed|A digital signal waveform: (1) low level, (2) high level, (3) rising edge, and (4) falling edge.]] {{main|Digital}} In [[computer architecture]] and other [[digital]] systems, a [[waveform]] that switches between two voltage levels representing the two states of a [[Boolean logic|Boolean]] value (0 and 1) is referred to as a ''digital signal'', even though it is an analog voltage waveform, since it is interpreted in terms of only two levels. The [[clock signal]] is a special digital signal that is used to [[synchronization|synchronize]] digital circuits. The image shown can be considered the waveform of a clock signal. Logic changes are triggered either by the rising edge or the falling edge. The given diagram is an example of the practical pulse and therefore we have introduced two new terms that are: * Rising edge: the transition from a low voltage (level 1 in the diagram) to a high voltage (level 2). * Falling edge: the transition from a high voltage to a low one. Although in a highly simplified and idealised model of a digital circuit we may wish for these transitions to occur instantaneously, no real world circuit is purely resistive and therefore no circuit can instantly change voltage levels. This means that during a short, finite [[transition time]] the output may not
