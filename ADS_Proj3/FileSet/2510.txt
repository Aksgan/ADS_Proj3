H. Lehmer]], sometimes also referred to as the '''Park–Miller random number generator''', after S. K. Park and K. W. Miller, is a variant of [[linear congruential generator]] that operates in [[multiplicative group of integers modulo n]]. A general formula of a random number generator (RNG) of this type is: : <math>X_{k+1} = g \cdot X_k~~\bmod~~n</math> where the modulus ''n'' is a [[prime number]] or a power of a prime number, the multiplier ''g'' is an element of high [[multiplicative order]] modulo ''n'' (e.g., a [[primitive root modulo n]]), and the seed ''X''{{sub|0}} is [[co-prime]] to ''n''. == Parameters in common use == In 1988, Park and Miller<ref>{{cite journal | author=S.

The [[GNU Scientific Library]] includes several random number generators of the Lehmer form, including MINSTD, RANF, and the infamous [[IBM]] random number generator [[RANDU]].<ref name="gnu" /> == Relation to LCG == While the Lehmer RNG can be viewed as a particular case of the [[linear congruential generator]] with ''c''=0, it is a special case that implies certain restrictions and properties. In particular, for the Lehmer RNG, the initial seed ''X''{{sub|0}} must be [[coprime]] to the modulus ''n'' that is not required for LCGs in general. The choice of the modulus ''n'' and the multiplier ''g'' is also more restrictive for the Lehmer RNG. In contrast to LCG, the maximum period of the Lehmer RNG equals ''n''−1 and it is such when ''n'' is prime and ''g'' is a primitive root modulo ''n''. On the other hand, the [[discrete logarithm]]s (to base ''g'' or any primitive root modulo ''n'') of ''X{{sub|k}}'' in <math>\mathbb{Z}_n</math> represent linear congruential sequence modulo [[Euler totient]] <math>\phi(n)</math>. == Sample C99 code == Using [[ISO C|C]] code, the Lehmer generator using the "popular pair" of parameters mentioned above can be written as follows: <source lang="c"> uint32_t lcg_rand(uint32_t a) { return ((uint64_t)a * 279470273UL) % 4294967291UL; } </source> As the product of two 32 bit integers may overflow, the cast to uint64_t is necessary. == References == {{reflist|2}} * {{cite journal |author=Lehmer, D.
