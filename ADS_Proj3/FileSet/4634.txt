over twenty buildings, which set the tone for the campus up until its expansion in the 1950s and 1960s. The structures forming the “classical core” of the campus were built in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] Classical style, and include [[Hearst Greek Theatre]], [[Hearst Memorial Mining Building]], [[Doe Memorial Library]], California Hall, [[Wheeler Hall]], (Old) Le Conte Hall, Gilman Hall, Haviland Hall, Wellman Hall, [[Sather Gate]], and the {{convert|307|ft|m|0|sing=on}} [[Sather Tower]] (nicknamed "the Campanile" after its architectural inspiration, [[St Mark's Campanile]] in Venice). Buildings he regarded as temporary, nonacademic, or not particularly "serious" were designed in shingle or [[Gothic architecture|Collegiate Gothic]] styles; examples of these are North Gate Hall, Dwinelle Annex, and Stephens Hall. Many of Howard's designs are recognized [[California Historical Landmark]]s and are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Built in 1873 in a [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] Second-Empire-style, [[South Hall (UC Berkeley)|South Hall]] is the oldest university building in California. It, and the [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]-designed [[Piedmont Avenue (Berkeley)|Piedmont Avenue]] east of the main campus, are the only remnants from the original University of California before John Galen Howard's buildings were constructed. Other architects whose work can be found in the campus and surrounding area are [[Bernard Maybeck]]<ref name=mccoy>{{cite book | first =Esther | authorlink =Esther McCoy | title =Five California Architects | publisher =Reinhold Publishing Corporation |year=1960 | location =New York | page =6 | id =ASIN B000I3Z52W | unused_data =HELLO PPL last =McCoy}}</ref> (best known for the [[Palace of Fine Arts]] in San Francisco), Maybeck's student [[Julia Morgan]] (Hearst Women's Gymnasium), [[Charles Willard Moore]] ([[Haas School of Business]]) and [[Joseph Esherick]] (Wurster Hall). ===Natural features=== [[Image:Strawberry Creek near Dwinelle Hall.jpg|thumb|[[Strawberry Creek]], as seen between Dwinelle Hall and Lower Sproul Plaza.]] Flowing into the main campus are two branches of [[Strawberry Creek]]. The south fork enters a culvert upstream of the recreational complex at the mouth of Strawberry Canyon and passes beneath [[California Memorial Stadium]] before appearing again in Faculty Glade. It then runs through the center of the campus before disappearing underground at the west end of campus. The north fork appears just east of [[University House, Berkeley|University House]] and runs through the glade north of the Valley Life Sciences Building, the original site of the Campus Arboretum. Trees in the area date from the founding of the University in the 1870s. The campus, itself, contains numerous wooded areas; including: [[Founders' Rock]], Faculty Glade, Grinnell Natural Area, and the [[Eucalyptus]] Grove, which is both the tallest stand of such trees in the world and the tallest stand of hardwood trees in North America.<ref>[http://strawberrycreek.berkeley.edu/tour/08eucalyptus.html UC Berkeley Strawberry Creek<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The campus sits on the [[Hayward Fault]], which runs directly through [[California Memorial Stadium]].<ref> {{cite web |url=http://seismo.berkeley.edu/hayward/ucb_campus.html |title=Hayward Fault: UC Berkeley |publisher=seismo.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2008-04-13 |last= |first= }} </ref> There is ongoing construction to retrofit the stadium. The "treesit" protest revolved around the controversy of clearing away trees by the stadium to build the new Student Athlete High Performance Center. As the stadium sits directly on the fault, this raised campus concerns of the safety of student athletes in the event of an earthquake as they train in facilities under the stadium stands.<ref>[http://berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2007/08/29_stadium.shtml "Campus provides updates on Memorial Stadium Project and Student-Athlete High Performance Center"]</ref> ===Student housing=== {{Main|Housing at the University of California, Berkeley}} UC Berkeley's student housing accommodates a variety of personal and academic preferences and styles. Presently, the university offers two years of guaranteed housing for entering freshmen, and one year for entering transfer students. The immediately surrounding community offers apartments, Greek (fraternity and sorority) housing, and the [[Berkeley Student Cooperative]] (an organization of about twenty cooperatively run student homes). [[Image:Cunningham-Towle.jpg|thumb|left|Cunningham Hall and the newly built Towle Hall, part of the Unit 2 residence hall complex]]There are four residence hall complexes south of campus in the City of Berkeley: Units 1, 2, 3, and Clark Kerr. Units 1, 2 and 3 offer [[high-rise]] accommodations with common areas on every other floor. Dining commons and other central facilities are shared by the high-rises. Because of their communal design and location in the city, these residence halls tend to be the more social of the housing options. Units 1 and 2 also have many of the newest residence hall buildings, which are intended for continuing and transfer students.<ref>[http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2005/01/11_spring05.shtml 01.11.2005 - New residence halls, new students arrive for spring semester<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Just outside these complexes are the Channing-Bowditch and Ida Jackson apartments, also intended for older students.<ref>[http://www.housing.berkeley.edu/livingatcal/channing_bowditch.html housing.berkeley.edu]</ref><ref>[http://www.housing.berkeley.edu/livingatcal/jackson_house.html Jackson House]</ref> Farther away from campus is Clark Kerr, a residence hall complex that houses many student athletes and was once a school for the deaf and blind. This complex is considered the most spacious and luxurious accommodation south of campus. [[Image:Bowles.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bowles Hall]] at the 2003 Homecoming and Parents Weekend]]In the foothills, east of the central campus, there are three additional residence hall complexes: Foothill, Stern, and Bowles. Foothill is a co-ed suite-style hall reminiscent of a Swiss chalet. Just south of Foothill, overlooking the [[Hearst Greek Theatre]], is the all-girls traditional-style Stern Hall, which boasts an original mural by [[Diego Rivera]]. Because of their proximity to the [[UC Berkeley College of Engineering|College of Engineering]] and [[UC Berkeley College of Chemistry|College of Chemistry]], these residence halls often house science and engineering majors. They tend to be quieter than the [[Southside, Berkeley, California|southside]] complexes, but because of their location next to the theatre, often get free glimpses of concerts. [[Bowles Hall]], the oldest state-owned residence hall in California, is located immediately north of [[California Memorial Stadium]]. Dedicated in 1929 and on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], this all-men's residence hall has large quad-occupancy rooms and has the appearance of a castle. Family student housing consists of two main groups of housing: [[UC Village|University Village]] and Smyth-Fernwald. University Village is located three miles (5 km) north-west of campus in [[Albany, California]]. The demolition of older buildings and their subsequent replacement with new, more expensive apartment units has prompted student protests.
