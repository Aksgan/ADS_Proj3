It can typically be visualized as a "brief oscillation" like one might see recorded by a [[seismograph]] or [[heart monitor]]. Generally, wavelets are purposefully crafted to have specific properties that make them useful for [[signal processing]]. Wavelets can be combined, using a "shift, multiply and sum" technique called [[convolution]], with portions of an unknown signal to extract information from the unknown signal. For example, a wavelet could be created to have a frequency of [[Middle C]] and a short duration of roughly a [[32nd note]]. If this wavelet were to be convolved at periodic intervals with a signal created from the recording of a song, then the results of these convolutions would be useful for determining when the Middle C note was being played in the song. Mathematically, the wavelet will resonate if the unknown signal contains information of similar frequency - just as a tuning fork physically resonates with sound waves of its specific tuning frequency. This concept of resonance is at the core of many practical applications of wavelet theory. As wavelets are a mathematical tool they can be used to extract information from many different kinds of data, including - but certainly not limited to - audio signals and images. Sets of wavelets are generally needed to analyze data fully. A set of "complementary" wavelets will deconstruct data without gaps or overlap so that the deconstruction process is mathematically reversible. Thus, sets of complementary wavelets are useful in wavelet based compression/decompression algorithms where it is desirable to recover the original information with minimal loss. In formal terms, this representation is a [[wavelet series]] representation of a [[square-integrable function]] with respect to either a [[complete space|complete]], [[orthonormal]] set of [[basis function]]s, or an [[Completeness|overcomplete]] set or [[Frame of a vector space]], for the [[Hilbert space]] of square integrable functions. == Name == The word ''wavelet'' has been used for decades in digital signal processing and exploration geophysics.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ricker |first1=Norman |year=1953 |title=WAVELET CONTRACTION, WAVELET EXPANSION, AND THE CONTROL OF SEISMIC RESOLUTION |journal=Geophysics |volume= 18|issue= 4 |doi=10.1190/1.1437927}}</ref> The equivalent [[French language|French]] word ''ondelette'' meaning "small wave" was used by [[Jean Morlet|Morlet]] and [[Alex Grossman|Grossmann]] in the early 1980s. == Wavelet theory == Wavelet theory is applicable to several subjects. All wavelet transforms may be considered forms of [[time-frequency representation]] for [[continuous-time]] (analog) signals and so are related to [[harmonic analysis]]. Almost all practically useful discrete wavelet transforms use [[discrete-time]] [[filterbank]]s. These filter banks are called the wavelet and scaling coefficients in wavelets nomenclature. These filterbanks may contain either [[finite impulse response]] (FIR) or [[infinite impulse response]] (IIR) filters. The wavelets forming a [[continuous wavelet transform]] (CWT) are subject to the [[Fourier uncertainty principle|uncertainty principle]] of Fourier analysis respective sampling theory: Given a signal with some event in it, one cannot assign simultaneously an exact time and frequency response scale to that event. The product of the uncertainties of time and frequency response scale has a lower bound. Thus, in the [[scaleogram]] of a continuous wavelet transform of this signal, such an event marks an entire region in the time-scale plane, instead of just one point. Also, discrete wavelet bases may be considered in the context of other forms
