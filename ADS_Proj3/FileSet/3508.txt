be read-up using one single disk-read operation. This same method is used to write the record back to its correct "bucket". In its initial implementation, Pick records were limited to 32K bytes in total (when a 10MB hard disk cost [[United States dollar|US$]]5000), although this limit was removed in the 1980s. Files can retain an unlimited number of records, but retrieval efficiency is determined by the number of records relative to the number of buckets allocated to the file. Each file may be initially allocated as many buckets as required, although changing this extent later may (for some filetypes) require the file to be quiescent. All modern multi-value databases have a special file-type which changes extent dynamically as the file is used. These use a technique called linear hashing, whose cost is proportional to the change in file size, not (as in typical hashed files) the file size itself. All files start as a contiguous group of disk pages, and grow by linking additional "overflow" pages from unused disk space. Initial Pick implementations had no index structures as they were not deemed necessary. Around 1990, a [[B-tree]] indexing feature was added. This feature makes secondary key look-ups operate much like keyed inquiries of any other database system: requiring at least two disk reads (a key read then a data-record read). Files include a "dictionary" fork, and the items in the dictionary fork serve as definitions for the names and structure of the items in the data fork. The dictionary is optional, the system does not use the contents of the dictionary to ensure the integrity of the file as some other DBMS file-systems do; rather it is used only for the reporting tool. A Pick database has no [[data typing]] since all data is stored as characters, including numbers (which are stored as character decimal digits). Data [[integrity]], rather than being controlled by the system, is controlled by the applications and the discipline of the programmers. But, because a logical document in Pick is not fragmented (as it would be in SQL) intra-record integrity is automatic. In contrast to many [[SQL]] [[database system]]s, Pick allows for multiple, pre-computed field aliases. For example, a date field may have an alias definition for the format 12 Oct 1999, and another alias formatting that same date field like 10/12/99. File cross-connects or joins are handled as a synonym definition of the foreign key. A customer's data, such as name and address, are 'joined' from the customer file into the invoice file via a synonym definition of customer number in the invoice dictionary. Pick record structure favors a "denormalized" decomposition, where all of the data for an entity is stored in a single record, obviating the need to perform [[join]]s. Managing large, sparse data sets in this way can result in efficient use of storage space. ==History== Pick was originally implemented as the [[Generalized Information Retrieval Language System]] (GIRLS) on an [[IBM System/360]] in 1965 by Don Nelson and Dick Pick at [[TRW]] for use by the [[U.S. Army]] to control the inventory of [[Lockheed AH-56 Cheyenne|Cheyenne helicopter]] parts. Pick was subsequently commercially released in 1973 by [[Microdata Corporation]] (and their British distributor CMC) as the Reality Operating System now supplied by [[Northgate Information Solutions]]. Originally on the Microdata implementation, and subsequently implemented on all Pick systems, a [[BASIC]]-like language called Data/BASIC with numerous syntax extensions for [[computer terminal#Dumb terminal|smart terminal interface]] and database operations was the primary programming language for applications. A [[PROC procedure language]] was provided for executing [[scripting language|scripts]]. A [[SQL]]-style language called [[ENGLISH (programming language)|ENGLISH]] allowed database retrieval and reporting, but not updates (although later, the English command "REFORMAT" allowed updates on a batch basis). ENGLISH did not fully allow manipulating the 3-dimensional multivalued structure of data records. Nor did it directly provide common [[relational]] capabilities such as [[join (SQL)|join]]s. This was because powerful [[data dictionary]] redefinitions for a field allowed [[join (SQL)|join]]s via the execution of a calculated lookup in another file. The system included a [[spooler]]. A simple [[text editor]] for file-system records was provided, but the editor was only suitable for system maintenance, and could not lock records, so most applications were written with the other tools such as Batch, RPL, or the BASIC language so as to ensure data validation and allow [[record locking]]. Dick Pick had founded Pick & Associates, later renamed Pick Systems then Raining Data and currently called TigerLogic, and licensed what was now called "Pick" to a large variety of manufacturers and vendors who have produced different "flavors" of Pick. The database flavors sold by TigerLogic is now known as D3, mvBase, and mvEnterprise. Those sold by [[IBM]] under the "[[IBM U2|U2]]" umbrella are known as UniData and UniVerse. Dick Pick died of stroke complications in October 1994. Pick Systems was often tangled in licensing litigation, and relatively little effort was devoted to marketing and improving the software. Subsequent ports of Pick to other platforms generally offered the same tools and capabilities for many years, usually with relatively minor improvements and simply renamed (for example, Data/BASIC became Pick/BASIC and ENGLISH became [[Access query language|ACCESS]]). Licensees often developed proprietary variations and enhancements (for example, Microdata created their own input processor called ScreenPro). <!-- Major corporations using Pick in its various flavors include: * [[Standard & Poor's]], a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies * Blue Cross, RC Willey, EastAlco Aluminum, Norm Thompson, Takagi Tools, Stash Tea Company, Optiva, Sony, Johnson Controls, Adobe, Ball, CNN, Polynesian Cultural Ctr., PetCo, UCLA, Marriott International, Salant, Brooks Brothers, NSA, Nuskin, McGraw-Hill, NYC Public Library, Jayhawk Acceptance, Saul Ewing Remick, Federal Reserve Board, Lettuce Entertain You, HoneyBaked Ham, Eastex Crude, Snap-On Tools, Hughes Supply, Rooms to Go, L.A.
