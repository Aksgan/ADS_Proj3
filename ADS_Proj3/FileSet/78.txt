All primitive recursive functions are total and computable, but the Ackermann function illustrates that not all total computable functions are primitive recursive.

One common version, the two-argument '''Ackermann–Péter function''', is defined as follows for nonnegative integers ''m'' and ''n'': :<math> A(m, n) = \begin{cases} n+1 & \mbox{if } m = 0 \\ A(m-1, 1) & \mbox{if } m > 0 \mbox{ and } n = 0 \\ A(m-1, A(m, n-1)) & \mbox{if } m > 0 \mbox{ and } n > 0. \end{cases} </math> Its value grows rapidly, even for small inputs. For example ''A''(4,2) is an integer of 19,729 decimal digits.<ref>[http://www.kosara.net/thoughts/ackermann42.html Decimal expansion of A(4,2)] {{Wayback|url=http://www.kosara.net/thoughts/ackermann42.html|date =20080317104411}}</ref> ==History== In the late 1920s, the mathematicians [[Gabriel Sudan]] and [[Wilhelm Ackermann]], students of [[David Hilbert]], were studying the foundations of computation.

Sudan published the lesser-known [[Sudan function]], then shortly afterwards and independently, in 1928, Ackermann published his function <math>\phi\,\!</math>. Ackermann's three-argument function, <math>\phi(m, n, p)\,\!</math>, is defined such that for ''p'' = 0, 1, 2, it reproduces the basic operations of addition, multiplication, and exponentiation as :<math>\phi(m, n, 0) = m+n,\,\!</math> :<math>\phi(m, n, 1) = m\cdot n,\,\!</math> :<math>\phi(m, n, 2) = m^n,\,\!</math> and for ''p'' > 2 it extends these basic operations in a way that happens to be expressible in [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]] as :<math>\phi(m, n, p) = m\uparrow^{p - 1}(n + 1)\,\!</math>. (Aside from its historic role as a total-computable-but-not-primitive-recursive function, Ackermann's original function is seen to extend the basic arithmetic operations beyond exponentiation, although not as seamlessly as do variants of Ackermann's function that are specifically designed for that purpose — such as [[Reuben Goodstein|Goodstein's]] [[hyperoperation]] sequence.) In ''On the Infinite'', David Hilbert hypothesized that the Ackermann function was not primitive recursive, but it was Ackermann, Hilbert’s personal secretary and former student, who actually proved the hypothesis in his paper ''On Hilbert’s Construction of the Real Numbers''. ''On the Infinite'' was Hilbert’s most important paper on the foundations of mathematics, serving as the heart of [[Hilbert's program]] to secure the foundation of [[transfinite number]]s by basing them on finite methods.<ref name="Ack"/><ref>von Heijenoort.

However, the recursion is bounded because in each recursive application either ''m'' decreases, or ''m'' remains the same and ''n'' decreases. Each time that ''n'' reaches zero, ''m'' decreases, so ''m'' eventually reaches zero as well. (Expressed more technically, in each case the pair (''m'', ''n'') decreases in the [[lexicographic order]], which preserves the [[well-order]]ing of the non-negative integers.) However, when ''m'' decreases there is no upper
