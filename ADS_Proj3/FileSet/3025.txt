cut, a brutal religious drama that was similarly classified as '''prohibited''' in [[Sweden]], was heavily edited for viewership in 1985. The film, left largely unintelligible, garnered a negative response from the public, which led authorities to abandon their practice of tampering with films. Due in part to this reluctance, the possibility of having a film '''banned''' for public viewing in Malta is perhaps slightly greater than it is elsewhere, although changes in Maltese society, and the church's ever-diminishing loss of clout, have allowed, in this regard, for a tolerant environment that mirrors the practices of other European countries. ==Mexico== The General Directorate of Radio, Television and Cinematography (in Spanish, ''Dirección General de Radio, Televisión y Cinematografía'', or ''RTC''[http://www.rtc.gob.mx]) is the issuer of ratings for television programs (although only one channel in Mexico explicitly shows the classification on each program, [[XEIMT-TV]] in [[Mexico City]]) and motion pictures. The RTC is a dependency of the Department of State ([http://www.segob.gob.mx ''Secretaría de Gobernación'']). It has its own classification system, as follows: *'''AA''' Informative-only rating: Specially suited for the interests of children under 7. This rating is usually seen in conjunction with animated TV shows or movies aimed at children. TV shows and movies under this rating have little to no violence, offensive language, and/or drug abuse. Sexual content is limited to mild affection and/or platonic friendship. *'''A''' Informative-only rating: General Audience. Suited for persons ages 7–11. Minimum or no violence, sexual or drug use content. Examples: ''[[Julie & Julia]]'', ''[[Whale Rider]]'', ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen (2003 film)|Cheaper by the Dozen]]'' *'''B''' Informative-only rating: For children 12 or over. Parental guidance suggested. Minimum and specifically motivated non-extreme violence. Sex can be shown, so long as it's implied. Nudity might be present, but not in an erotic or degrading manner. Drug use can be referenced, but actual consumption and any scenes condoning or glorifying drug abuse are prohibited. Language may be dirty, but no verbal violence. Examples: ''[[Trick 'r Treat]]'', ''[[Carriers (film)|Carriers]]'', ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' *'''B-15''' Informative-only rating: For children 15 or over. More explicit content than '''B''' rating, but extreme violence, explicit sexual content, drug abuse (or scenes of drugs being glorified), and verbal violence is still prohibited. Examples: ''[[Amusement (film)|Amusement]]'', ''[[The Unborn (2009 film)|The Unborn]]'', ''[[My Bloody Valentine (film)|My Bloody Valentine]]'' *'''C''' Restrictive rating: For adults over 18. High degree of violence (including cruelty), sexual content, and/or drug abuse/references. Verbal violence and offensive language is permitted, but only for narrative purposes. Examples: ''[[Martyrs (film)|Martyrs]]'', ''[[Inside (2007 film)|Inside]]'', ''[[Silent Hill (film)|Silent Hill]]'' *'''D''' Restrictive rating: Adults-only. Commonly known as X-rated. May contain strong sexual situations, explicit language, and extreme violence. Examples: ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]'', ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (2006 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'', ''[[Demons (film)|Demons]]'' ==Netherlands== In the Netherlands, the [http://www.kijkwijzer.nl/changelanguage.php?l=/index.php? ''Kijkwijzer''] system is used, which is executed by the [[Netherlands Institute for the Classification of Audiovisual Media|NICAM]]. Unrestricted: *'''AL''' Suitable for all ages (in Dutch: '''A'''lle '''L'''eeftijden). *'''6''' Not recommended for children younger than 6 years. Replaced the older '''MG6''' ("'''M'''eekijken '''G'''ewenst"), where parental guidance was recommended for viewers younger than 6 years. *'''9''' Not recommended for children younger than 9 years. Now a standard rating. First used for ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' because of very frightening elements. Also used for ''[[De Scheepsjongens van Bontekoe]]''. *'''12''' Not recommended for children younger than 12 years; broadcasting is not allowed before 20:00 (8:00 p.m.). Restricted: *'''16''' Not recommended for children younger than 16 years; hence, according to [[Netherlands law#Criminal law|Wetboek van Strafrecht]] art. 240A, it is forbidden to admit such a person to a screening, or rent out, sell, or give the movie (DVD, video, computer file, etc.) to such a person; broadcasting is not allowed before 22:00 (10:00 p.m.). Mostly, these icons are used along with other symbols, displaying if a movie contains violence, sexual content, frightening scenes, drug or alcohol abuse, discrimination, or coarse language. ==New Zealand== {{Main|Office of Film and Literature Classification (New Zealand)}} [[Image:NzfilmratingS.PNG|thumb|right|New Zealand Ratings]] The ''Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993'' gives the [[Office of Film and Literature Classification (New Zealand)]] the power to classify publications into three categories: unrestricted, restricted, or "objectionable". With a few exceptions, films, videos, DVDs and restricted computer games must carry a label before being offered for supply or exhibited to the public. The currently available unrestricted ratings are: * <span style="background-color: #52ad36; color: black;"> '''G''' </span> Suitable for general audiences. * <span style="background-color: #ffed00; color: black;"> '''PG''' </span> Parental guidance may be needed for younger viewers. * <span style="background-color: #ffed00; color: black;"> '''M''' </span> Suitable for mature audiences 16 years and over. The most common restricted ratings are: * <span style="background-color: #ed1c19; color: white;"> '''R13''' </span> Restricted to persons 13 years and over. * <span style="background-color: #ed1c19; color: white;"> '''R16''' </span> Restricted to persons 16 years and over. * <span style="background-color: #ed1c19; color: white;"> '''R18''' </span> Restricted to persons 18 years and over. The least common restricted ratings are: * <span style="background-color: #ed1c19; color: white;"> '''R15''' </span> Restricted to persons 15 years and over. * <span style="background-color: #ed1c19; color: white;"> '''RP13''' </span> Children under age 13 not admitted unless accompanied by an adult. * <span style="background-color: #ed1c19; color: white;"> '''RP16''' </span> Children under age 16 not admitted unless accompanied by an adult. * <span style="background-color: #ed1c19; color: white;"> '''R''' </span> Restricted to a certain audience. Under New Zealand law it is possible for the New Zealand Film and Video Labelling Body to give an unrestricted rating to a film if it has been given an unrestricted rating by either the [[Australian Classification Board]] in Australia or, if the Australian Board has not reviewed it, the [[British Board of Film Classification]], and it is not likely to be restricted under New Zealand censorship law. If a film has received a restricted rating (of at least 15+) in either Australia or the UK it must be classified by the OFLC. The OFLC may restrict a film to a certain audience, either by age
