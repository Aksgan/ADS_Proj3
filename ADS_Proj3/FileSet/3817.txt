and [[Panasonic]] were formed in 1999 * Industrial Partnerships with [[ABB Group|ABB]] formed in 2006 * Assisted in the design and delivery of the Certified Robotic Arc Welder (CRAW) certification for the [[American Welding Society]] (AWS) in 2006 * Certified Robotic Welder Technician (CRWT) exam in development with the [[Canadian Welding Bureau]] (CWB) - Projected release early 2010 * Partnered with Embedded Training Companies (RoboticsWares & Robotech Labs) from India in 2010. * Currently working on Projects in Korea, China, Mexico and USA. == Industrial Robotic Certifications == The RCSA delivers [[certification exam]]s, manufacturer hands-on training programs, and products and services to provide members with the ability to keep current by updating their knowledge and / or certifying them with new skills. Recently the RCSA has crossed over from industrial to the robotics fields of Embedded, Unmanned Land/Air/Sea Vehicles, Autonomous and Vision robots. This cross over has already solidified partners in India now delivering certification to Embedded training and workshops being offered by several companies. ==Current Partners== * [[Panasonic]] * [[Motoman]] * Robar Training Specialists * Roboticwares * RoboTech Labs * [[Zaib Technologies Pvt.

Robotix is organised during [[Kshitij]], the annual techno-management festival of the institute. Participation is open to any college student. The event gives the contestants an opportunity to showcase their talent in the fields of mechanical robotics, autonomous robotics and programming. ==Robotix 2011== Robotix 2011 will be held from the 27th of January to the 30th of January, 2011. ===Manual Events=== ;R.A.F.T. The task is to build a manually controlled robot or a group of robots which can navigate a raft on water and retrieve people (in our case, balls) from flood affected areas (platforms) and bring them to safety(Victory zone). ;Pirate Bay The event challenges you to design a manually controlled robot that is capable of handling far more variables than a regular terrestrial bot. The pirate-bot is required to dig out buried treasure and rescue fellow pirates. ===Autonomous Events=== ;The Fugitives A very innovative and challenging event, that requires participants to build at most four autonomous robots that may communicate and collaborate to detect and corner fugitive bots! ;Ballista Build an autonomous robot that can shoot ping-pong balls into a basket from different locations. The bot with better accuracy and range wins! ;Robocop An Image-Processing based event that requires your bot to have an on-board image processing system to identify and knock-out statuettes of a certain colour. ===Online Event=== ;The Negotiators Submit a computer program online, that can negotiate with opponents in order to complete a configuration of blocks on a virtual arena. ==History== Robotix started off in the year 2001, under IDEON, the old name of Kshitij. It was the brainchild of Kunal Sinha, Saurabh Prasad and Varun Rai (class of 2002, IIT Kharagpur). It started as an in-house event for the students of IIT Kharagpur. 8 teams turned up in the inaugural year. IDEON became Kshitij in 2003. Currently, Robotix is organised under the umbrella of Kshitij. The participation has increased over the years, with 220 teams turning up for Robotix 2006, 546 teams for Robotix 2007, over a 1000 teams for Robotix 2008, and Robotix 2009 managing to better all its predecessors. Robotix celebrated its ten years in 2010 with an array of the most challenging problem statements ever. The difficulty level was arguably the best this country has seen till date. The quality of participation too, was at its best ever. ==Events== The events pit participants' robots against each other in an arena. Events are either of solo-run type or one-on-one type. In a solo-run event, the bot is given free run in the arena, and then evaluated on various marking criteria like time taken, task completed and efficiency etc. In a one-on-one event(usually employed in knockout rounds), two or more teams fight against each other. There is a direct competition between the two teams and only one team makes it through to the next round. Events during Robotix are conducted under three categories â€” mechanical, autonomous and programming(usually online). ===Manual events=== In a manual event, the robot is manually controlled by the participant with the help of a remote control. The remote system may be either wired or unwired. The robot then has to perform the specified task. The event may be held as a solo run type or a one-on-one type. ===Autonomous events=== In autonomous events, robots are independent and participants are not allowed to control them in any way during their run. These robots usually use programmed micro controllers that lend the robots all their decision making powers. Here too, the event maybe solo-run or one-on-one type. ===Programming events=== Participants are required to write program codes in these events in order to solve the problem that has been posed. Usually, online participation is allowed in programming events.
