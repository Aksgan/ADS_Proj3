become parallel, capacitors become inductors, and so on.<ref>Taylor & Huang, pp.378–379</ref> Circuit diagrams using the mobility analogy more closely match the mechanical [[Topology (electronics)|arrangement]] of the circuit, making it more intuitive from a mechanical engineering standpoint.<ref>Eargle, pp.4–5.</ref> In addition to their application to electromechanical systems, these analogies are widely used to aid analysis in acoustics.<ref>Talbot-Smith, pp.1.86–1.98, for instance.</ref> Any mechanical component will unavoidably possess both mass and stiffness. This translates in electrical terms to an LC circuit, that is, a circuit consisting of an inductor and a capacitor, hence mechanical components are resonators and are often used as such. It is still possible to represent inductors and capacitors as individual lumped elements in a mechanical implementation by minimising (but never quite eliminating) the unwanted property. Capacitors may be made of thin, long rods, that is, the mass is minimised and the compliance is maximised. Inductors, on the other hand, may be made of short, wide pieces which maximise the mass in comparison to the compliance of the piece.<ref name=Norton1>Norton, p.1.</ref> Mechanical parts act as a [[transmission line]] for mechanical vibrations. If the [[wavelength]] is short in comparison to the part then a [[lumped element model]] as described above is no longer adequate and a [[distributed element model]] must be used instead. The mechanical distributed elements are entirely analogous to electrical distributed elements and the mechanical filter designer can use the methods of electrical [[distributed element filter]] design.<ref name=Norton1/> ==History== ===Harmonic telegraph=== Mechanical filter design was developed by applying the discoveries made in electrical filter theory to mechanics. However, a very early example (1870s) of acoustic filtering was the "[[harmonic telegraph]]", which arose precisely because electrical resonance was poorly understood but [[mechanical resonance]] (in particular, [[acoustic resonance]]) was very familiar to engineers. This situation was not to last for long; [[electrical resonance]] had been known to science for some time before this, and it was not long before engineers started to produce all-electric designs for filters. In its time, though, the harmonic telegraph was of some importance. The idea was to combine several telegraph signals on one telegraph line by what would now be called [[frequency division multiplexing]] thus saving enormously on line installation costs. The [[Telegraph key|key]] of each operator activated a vibrating electromechanical reed which converted this vibration into an electrical signal. Filtering at the receiving operator was achieved by a similar reed tuned to precisely the same frequency, which would only vibrate and produce a sound from transmissions by the operator with the identical tuning.<ref name=Lund24>Lundheim, p.24.</ref><ref name=Blanch425>Blanchard, p.425.</ref> Versions of the harmonic telegraph were developed by [[Elisha Gray]], [[Alexander Graham Bell]], [[Ernest Mercadier]]<ref group=n>[[:fr:Ernest Mercadier|Ernest Mercadier]] article in French Wikipedia</ref> and others. Its ability to act as a sound [[transducer]] to and from the electrical domain was to inspire the invention of the telephone.<ref name=Lund24/><ref name=Blanch425/> ===Mechanical equivalent circuits=== Once the basics of electrical network analysis began to be established, it was not long before the ideas of [[complex impedance]] and [[filter design]] theories were carried over into mechanics by analogy. [[Arthur E. Kennelly|Kennelly]], who was also responsible for introducing complex impedance, and [[Arthur Gordon Webster|Webster]] were the first to extend the concept of impedance into mechanical systems in 1920.<ref name="Hunt, p.66">Hunt, p.66.</ref> Mechanical admittance and the associated mobility analogy came much later and are due to Firestone in 1932.<ref>Hunt, p.110.</ref><ref>Pierce, p.321 cites<br />F. A. Firestone, "A new analogy between mechanical and electrical systems", ''Journal of the Acoustical Society of America'', '''vol.4''', pp.249–267 (1932–1933).</ref> It was not enough to just develop a mechanical analogy. This could be applied to problems that were entirely in the mechanical domain, but for mechanical filters with an electrical application it is necessary to include the transducer in the analogy as well. [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] in 1907 was the first to describe a transducer as a pair of [[linear algebra]]ic equations relating electrical variables (voltage and current) to mechanical variables (force and velocity).<ref>Pierce, p.200 cites<br />H. Poincaré. "Study of telephonic reception", ''Eclairage Electrique'', '''vol.50''', pp.221–372, 1907.</ref> These equations can be expressed as a matrix relationship in much the same way as the [[impedance parameters|z-parameters]] of a [[two-port network]] in electrical theory, to which this is entirely analogous: :<math> \begin{bmatrix} V \\ F \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} z_{11} & z_{12} \\ z_{21} & z_{22} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} I \\ v \end{bmatrix} </math> where ''V'' and ''I'' represent the voltage and current respectively on the electrical side of the transducer. Wegel, in 1921, was the first to express these equations in terms of mechanical impedance as well as electrical impedance. The element <math> z_{22} \,</math> is the open circuit mechanical impedance, that is, the impedance presented by the mechanical side of the transducer when no current is entering the electrical side. The element <math> z_{11} \,</math>, conversely, is the clamped electrical impedance, that is, the impedance presented to the electrical side when the mechanical side is clamped and prevented from moving (velocity is zero). The remaining two elements, <math> z_{21} \,</math> and <math> z_{12} \,</math>, describe the transducer forward and reverse transfer functions respectively. Once these ideas were in place, engineers were able to extend electrical theory into the mechanical domain and analyse an electromechanical system as a unified whole.<ref name="Hunt, p.66"/><ref>Pierce, p.200 cites;<br />R.
