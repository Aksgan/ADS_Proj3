the truth or plausibility of things. Both critical thinking and Socratic questioning share a common end. Critical thinking provides the conceptual tools for understanding how the mind functions in its pursuit of meaning and truth; Socratic questioning employs those tools in framing questions essential to the pursuit of meaning and truth. The goal of critical thinking is to establish an additional level of thinking to our thinking, a powerful inner voice of reason, that monitors, assesses, and reconstitutes—in a more rational direction—our thinking, feeling, and action. Socratic discussion cultivates that inner voice through an explicit focus on self-directed, disciplined questioning. Socratic questioning has also been used in [[therapy]], most notably in [[cognitive therapy]] and [[Classical Adlerian psychotherapy]]. The purpose here is to help uncover the assumptions and evidence that underpin people's thoughts in respect of problems. Careful use of Socratic questioning enables a therapist to challenge a person's illogical thinking while maintaining an open position that respects the internal logic to even the most seemingly illogical thoughts. ==See also== * [[Socratic Method]] * [[Critical thinking]] * [[Intellectual virtue]] ==References== * Paul, R. and Elder, L.

More complex systems arising in [[biology]], [[medicine]], the [[humanities]], [[management science]]s, and similar fields often remained intractable to conventional mathematical and analytical methods. That said, it should be pointed out that simplicity and complexity of systems are relative, and many conventional mathematical models have been both challenging and very productive. Soft computing deals with imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth, and approximation to achieve tractability, robustness and low solution cost. Components of soft computing include: * [[Neural network]]s (NN) * [[Fuzzy system]]s (FS) * [[Evolutionary computation]] (EC), including: ** [[Evolutionary algorithm]]s ** [[Harmony search]] * [[Swarm intelligence]] * Ideas about [[probability]] including: ** [[Bayesian network]] * [[Chaos theory]] * [[Perceptron]] Generally speaking, soft computing techniques resemble biological processes more closely than traditional techniques, which are largely based on formal [[logical system]]s, such as [[sentential logic]] and [[predicate logic]], or rely heavily on computer-aided numerical analysis (as in [[finite element analysis]]). Soft computing techniques are intended to complement each other. Unlike hard computing schemes, which strive for exactness and full truth, soft computing techniques exploit the given tolerance of imprecision, partial truth, and uncertainty for a particular problem. Another common contrast comes from the observation that [[inductive reasoning]] plays a larger role in soft computing than in hard computing. ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.softcomputing.es/en/home.php EUROPEAN CENTRE FOR SOFT COMPUTING] * [http://www.helsinki.fi/~niskanen/bisc.html BISC SIG IN PHILOSOPHY OF SOFT COMPUTING] [[Category:Scientific modeling]] [[Category:Artificial intelligence]] [[Category:Semantic Web]] [[Category:Soft computing]] [[es:Soft Computing]] [[fa:محاسبات نرم]] [[it:Soft computing]] [[hu:Lágy számítási modell]] [[ms:Komputeran lembut]] [[nl:Soft computing]] [[ru:Мягкие вычисления]] [[ja:ソフトコンピューティング]] [[zh:软计算]]</text> </page> <page> <id>34905</id> <title>Soft error</title> <text>In [[electronics]] and [[computing]], a '''soft error''' is an [[error]] is a signal or datum which is wrong. Errors may be caused by a [[defect]], usually understood either to be a mistake in design or construction, or a broken component. A soft error is also a signal or datum which is wrong, but is not assumed to imply such a mistake or breakage. After observing a soft error, there is no implication that the system is any less reliable than before. If detected, a soft error may be corrected by rewriting correct data in place of erroneous data. Highly reliable systems use [[error correction]] to correct soft errors on the fly. However, in many systems, it may be impossible to determine the correct data, or even to discover that an error is present at all. In addition, before the correction can occur, the system may have [[crash (computing)|crashed]], in which case the recovery procedure must include a [[Reboot (computer)|reboot]]. Soft errors involve changes to data &mdash; the [[electrons]] in a storage circuit, for example &mdash; but not changes to the physical circuit itself, the [[atoms]]. If the data is rewritten, the circuit will work perfectly again. Soft errors can occur on transmission lines, in digital logic, analog circuits, magnetic storage, and elsewhere, but are most commonly known in semiconductor storage. Soft errors should not be confused with [[Software bug|software programming errors]]. ==Critical charge== Whether a circuit experiences a soft error depends on the energy of the incoming particle, the geometry of the impact, the location of the strike, and the design of the logic circuit. Logic circuits with higher [[capacitance]] and higher logic voltages are less likely to suffer an error. This combination of capacitance and voltage is described by the '''critical [[electric charge|charge]]''' parameter, '''Q<sub>crit</sub>''', the minimum electron charge disturbance needed to change the logic level. A higher Q<sub>crit</sub> means fewer soft errors. Unfortunately, a higher Q<sub>crit</sub> also means a slower logic gate and a higher power dissipation. Reduction in chip feature size and supply voltage, desirable for many reasons, decreases Q<sub>crit</sub>. Thus, the importance of soft errors increases as chip technology advances. In a logic circuit, Q<sub>crit</sub> is defined as the minimum amount of induced charge required at a circuit node to cause a voltage pulse to propagate from that node to the output and be of sufficient duration and magnitude to be reliably latched. Since a logic circuit contains many nodes that may be struck, and each node may be of unique capacitance and distance from output, Q<sub>crit</sub> is typically characterized on a per-node basis.
