and [[music|audio]] systems including [[amplifiers]] and [[loudspeaker|speakers]] as well as [[telescopes]]). When Ryo was 10-years-old, he bought a [[ukulele]] and, at 14, he got his first [[acoustic guitar]]. The album Midnight Blue by [[Kenny Burrell]] and [[Stanley Turrentine]] inspired Ryo to study [[jazz]]. In high school he began hanging out at coffee-houses that featured live music, formed a jazz ensemble and built an [[electric organ]] that served as a primitive [[synthesizer]]. By the time he was 16, his band was playing professionally in cabarets and strip joints. Although he continued to play music regularly, he attended Nippon University, majored in [[quantum physics]] and earned his [[Bachelor of Science]] Degree. Although he has failed to prove his main interest and intuitive belief at that time, which is to prove that speed ([[propagation]]) of [[gravity]] must be much greater than [[speed of light]]. He also did some teaching and contest judging at the [[Yamaha]] musical instrument manufacturer's jazz school. Additionally he worked as a [[sound engineer]] for Japanese [[Victor Records]] and [[BGM]]/[[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] Music where he learned [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] and [[editing]]. ===Early career in Japan (1969–1973)=== He recorded his first solo album for [[Polydor Records]] when he was 22. Although he continued to perform with his jazz group, and at a young age was voted the #3 [[jazz guitarist]] in a Japanese jazz [[Opinion poll|poll]], Ryo spent most of the next three years working as [[studio musician]] on everything from advertising jingles to pop songs including countless radio and TV appearances. He recorded his second album for [[Toshiba]] when he was 24. He played with [[B.B. King]] at a blues festival and also met [[George Benson]] (they jammed for five hours at Ryo's house). He also has recorded and worked with notable Japanese Jazz legends such as drummer Takeshi Inomata and Sound limits, saxophonist Jiro Inagaki and Soul Mates, saxophonist Keiichiro Ebisawa, saxophonist Seiichi Nakamura, pianist Masahiko Sato ([[:ja:佐藤允彦|佐藤允彦]]), saxophonist Hidehiko Matsumoto ([[:ja:松本英彦|松本英彦]]) and many others. ===Developments in New York City (1973–2002)=== ====1973–1979 (as guitarist)==== [[Image:Ryo-gil.jpg|frame|right|Ryo Kawasaki with [[Gil Evans]] at Sweet Basil in New York City,1982]] [[Image:David Williams, Elvin Jones and Ryo Kawasaki.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Ryo Kawasaki with [[Elvin Jones]] in Rochester, N.Y. 1976]] In 1973, Kawasaki arrived in New York. A friend picked him up at the airport and offered him an immediate gig with [[Joe Lee Wilson]] playing at the [[Lincoln Center]] as part of the [[Newport Jazz Festival]]. Soon Ryo was jamming regularly as part of the jazz community's "loft scene", and was invited to play with [[Bobbi Humphrey]]. A few months later, Ryo walked up to his apartment and found a stranger waiting for him at his front door. It was [[Gil Evans]] and he invited Ryo to join The Gil Evans Orchestra ([[David Sanborn]], [[Howard Johnson (jazz musician)|Howard Johnson]], [[Tom Malone (musician)|Tom Malone]], [[Lew Soloff]]) which was then working on a jazz recording of [[Jimi Hendrix]] compositions. Hendrix had dreamed up the concept with Evans, but Jimi died a week before the project started in 1970. Kawasaki also played on another Gil Evans album on RCA, There Comes a Time, with [[Tony Williams]] on [[Drum kit|drums]]. Ryo rehearsed for a month with the third edition of Tony Williams' Lifetime with trio format with bassist [[Doug Rauch]] working with [[Carlos Santana]] at that time, but Tony left to spend a year in Europe before the band got the chance to perform in public. Kawasaki followed in the footsteps of [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]], [[Gábor Szabó]] and [[Larry Coryell]] by becoming the [[guitarist]] in the [[Chico Hamilton]] Band, playing on a U.S. tour and working on various film scores that Chico recorded in [[Hollywood]]. Ryo made his debut U.S. album, Juice, in 1976 for [[RCA]] and was one of the first Japanese jazz artists to sign with a major label in the States. Sidemen on the project included [[Tom Coster]] ([[Carlos Santana]]) and [[Sam Morrison]] ([[Miles Davis]]). Kawasaki followed that recording with two more albums, ''Prism'' and ''Eight Mile Road'', for the Japanese [[record label|label]] East Wind. He also joined the [[Elvin Jones]] Band for a year-long tour of North and South America and Europe. By 1978, Kawasaki was tired of touring with other bands and returned to his own projects. He explored [[Music of India]], learned [[ragas]] and recorded an Audio Fidelity album, Ring Toss, that combined eastern and western music. With [[Dave Liebman]] he recorded Nature's Revenge for the German [[MPS]] [[label]] and they toured Europe. Ryo also toured European jazz festivals with [[Joanne Brackeen]] as piano – guitar duo, and they recorded a pair of albums—AFT and Trinkets and Things—for Timeless Records in Holland. In Japan, [[Sony]]'s Open Sky label signed Ryo for three albums—Mirror of my Mind, Little Tree and Live—the latter, recorded in a Tokyo club, was one of the first all-digital recordings. Notable musicians participated on those recordings are : [[Michael Brecker]], [[Harvey Mason]], [[Leon Pendarvis]], [[Azar Lawrence]], [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]], [[Lincoln Goines]], [[Badal Roy]], [[Nana Vasconcelos]], [[Buddy Williams]], [[Larry Willis]] and [[Alex Blake]] to name a few. He also recorded an album called ''Sapporo'' for Swiss label America Sound in 1980 while touring Switzerland and Germany. ====1979–1990 (as inventor and programmer)==== Kawasaki invented his own [[guitar synthesizer]] in 1979, and used it to perform numerous solo shows at [[planetarium]]s from 1980 to 1983. He also formed the jazz-rock group The Golden Dragon and performed concerts regularly in the 80s. [[Fostex]] developed the first quarter- inch-tape, eight-track recorder and asked Ryo to be the first artist to use it. He recorded the album Ryo in 1981 for [[Philips Records]] and gained notoriety for creating all the music himself. He played only a nylon-string acoustic guitar with all his backing tracks created on his guitar synthesizer including the entire original [[orchestration]] of [[Joaquin Rodrigo]]'s well known [[Concierto de Aranjuez]] – [[Tempo#Basic_tempo_markings|Adagio]] movement. He did another similar recording, Lucky Lady, the next year. When the [[Commodore 64]] computer came out with a sound-chip in it, Kawasaki became fascinated by the possibilities. He learned
