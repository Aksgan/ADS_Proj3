the University of Illinois. ORDVAC was completed the spring of 1951 and checked out in the summer. In the fall it was delivered to the [[United States Army|US Army]]'s [[Aberdeen Proving Grounds]] and was checked out in roughly one week. As part of the contract, funds were provided to the University of Illinois to build a second identical computer known as ILLIAC I. ==ILLIAC I== [[ILLIAC I]] was built at the University of Illinois based on the same design as the [[ORDVAC]]. It was the first [[von Neumann architecture]] computer built and owned by an American university. It was put into service on September 22, 1952. ILLIAC I was built with 2,800 [[vacuum tube]]s and weighed about 5 tons. It had 5k of main memory and 64k Drum memory. By 1956 it had gained more computing power than all computers in [[Bell Labs]] combined. ILLIAC I was decommissioned in 1963 when ILLIAC II (see below) became operational. == ILLIAC II == The [[ILLIAC II]] was the first [[transistor computer|transistorized]] and [[Instruction pipeline|pipelined]] [[supercomputer]] built by the University of Illinois. At its inception in 1958 it was 100 times faster than competing machines of that day. It became operational in 1962, two years later than expected. ILLIAC II had 8192 words of [[core memory]], backed up by 65,536 words of storage on magnetic drums. The core memory access time was 1.8 to 2 µs. The magnetic drum access time was 7 µs. A "fast buffer" was also provided for storage of short loops and intermediate results (similar in concept to what is now called cache). The "fast buffer" access time was 0.25 µs. The word size was 52 bits. [[Floating-point]] numbers used a format with 7 bits of exponent (power of 4) and 45 bits of [[Significand|mantissa]]. Instructions were either 26 bits or 13 bits long, allowing packing of up to 4 instructions per memory word. In 1963 [[Donald B. Gillies]] used the ILLIAC II to find three [[Mersenne prime]]s, with 2917, 2993, and 3376 digits - the largest primes known at the time. {{nihongo|Hideo Aiso|[[:ja:相磯秀夫|相磯秀夫]]|extra= [[1932]]- }} from Japan participated in the development program and designed the [[arithmetic logic unit]] from September 1960.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2006-06-30|url=http://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/pioneer/aiso.html|title=Computer pioneer in Japan|publisher=Information Processing Society of Japan ([[:ja:情報処理学会|情報処理学会]])|accessdate=2008-12-22}}</ref> == ILLIAC III == The [[ILLIAC III]] was a fine-grained [[SIMD]] pattern recognition computer built by the University of Illinois in 1966. This ILLIAC's initial task was image processing of [[bubble chamber]] experiments used to detect nuclear particles. Later it was used on biological images. The machine was destroyed in a fire, caused by a Variac shorting on one of the wooden-top benches, in 1968. == ILLIAC IV == {{Main|ILLIAC IV}} The '''[[ILLIAC IV]]''' was one of the most infamous [[supercomputer]]s ever, one of the first attempts at a massively parallel computer. Key to the ILLIAC IV design was fairly high [[parallel computing|parallelism]] with up to 256 processors, used to allow the machine to work on large data sets in what would later be known as [[vector processor|vector processing]]. ILLIAC IV relied on first and early second generation semiconductor technology, resulting in physical board space resulting in pull out 'cards' that were on the order of two feet square. The power supplies for the machine were so large that it required designing a single tongue fork lift to remove and reinstall the power supply. The power supply buss bars on the machine spanned distances greater than three feet, and were octupus like in design. Thick copper, the busses were coated in epoxy that often cracked resulting in shorts and an array of other issues. The machine was built in quadrants, with the first quadrant delivered to the University of Illinois in the summer of 1972. The building in which the quadrants was built was designed such that the wall at the end of the building was built to be easily removed. The quadrant itself was built on a flat bed semi tractor trailer; when ready to deliver, the wall was removed, a truck backed down and connected to the trailer, driving away for delivery. It was all quite impressive. Successive quadrants were built and delivered, with the entire system finally ready for operation in 1976, after a decade of development. In addition to being massively parallel, by that time it was also massively late, massively over budget, and massively outperformed by existing commercial machines such as Cray-1. == CEDAR == [[CEDAR]] is a hierarchical shared-memory supercomputer completed in 1988. The development team was led by Professor [[David Kuck]]. This SMP (symmetric multiprocessing) system embodied advances in interconnection networks, control unit support of parallelism, optimizing compilers and parallel algorithms and applications. It is occasionally referred to as ILLIAC V. == ILLIAC VI == The [[ILLIAC VI]] is currently under construction at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. It is a 65K node communications supercomputer utilizing commodity DSPs as the computation nodes. It will be a fixed point workhorse capable of over 1.2 quadrillion multiply-accumulate operations per second and will have a bi-sectional bandwidth of over 4 terabytes per second. == Trusted ILLIAC == The [[Trusted ILLIAC]] was completed in 2006 at the [[University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign]]'s [[Coordinated Science Laboratory]] and [[Information Trust Institute]]. It is a 256 node Linux cluster, with each node having two processors. The [[Trusted ILLIAC]] nodes also contain onboard [[FPGA]]s to enable smart compilers and programming models, system assessment and validation, configurable trust mechanisms, automated fault management, on-line adaptation, and numerous other configurable trust frameworks. The nodes each have access to 8 GB memory on a 6.4 GB/s bus, and are connected via 8 GB/s PCI-Express to the FPGAs. A 2.5 GB/s InfiniBand network provides the internode connectivity. The system itself was constructed using the help and support of [[AMD]] and [[HP]]. ==See also== * [[MUSASINO-1]] * [[IAS Computer]] ==References== <references /> * {{cite news |author = Staff |url = http://www.oc.uiuc.edu/newsletter.pdf |title = Trusted ILLIAC Pushes the Limits of Trustworthy Computing |work = On Our Watch (volume 1, issue 1) |publisher = Office of the Chancellor,
