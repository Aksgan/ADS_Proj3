the fundamental issues and approaches for relational databases. In a now-famous paper (Maier, Mendelzon and Sagiv, TODS 1979), he introduced the [[chase (database theory)|chase]], a method for testing implication of data dependencies that is now of widespread use in the [[database theory]] literature. This work has been highly influential: it is used, directly or indirectly, on an everyday basis by people who design databases, and it is used in commercial systems to reason about the consistency and correctness of a data design. New applications of the chase in meta-data management and data exchange are still being discovered. In the 1980s, Mendelzon began an important line of work on graphical query languages. His work has been called prescient as it began before the [[World Wide Web]], and nonetheless established many of the scientific principles required for designing languages to query the Web. More recently, Mendelzon was a central figure in the work on view-based querying. Starting with the innovative LMSS95 paper (Levy, Mendelzon, Sagiv, and Srivastava, PODS 1995) that introduced the problem of answering queries using views, Alberto Mendelzon made several important contributions to the emerging area of view-based modeling and processing. His research was central to the development of many areas of database research such as database design, semantic [[query optimization]], graphical query languages, and querying web data. In addition, he also made important contributions to recursive query languages, on-line analytic processing, similarity-based queries, data warehouses and view maintenance, algorithms for computing web page reputations, and indexing of [[XML]] data. Mendelzon was an active member of both the [[database theory]] and [[database systems]] research communities. He served as the PC Chair for ACM [[PODS]] in 1991 and as General Chair in both 1997 and 1998. He served as PC Chair for [[VLDB]] in 1992, and as a member of the [[SIGMOD]] Executive Committee from 1998 to 2001. He was a member of the [[Royal Society of Canada]]. == ACM PODS Mendelzon Test-of-Time Award == The ACM PODS Alberto O. Mendelzon Test-of-Time Award was established in 2007 and was awarded for the first time in 2008. It is awarded every year to a paper or a small number of papers published in the PODS proceedings ten years prior that had the most impact in terms of research, methodology, or transfer to practice over the intervening decade<ref>Alberto O.

It acquired the Corel Catalyst software which was initially owned by Corel Corporation Limited, in a deal which saw Corel gain a stake of 24.9% equity interest in the newly formed company. On March 6 2008 Alchemy Software development merged with Translations.com a provider of software localisation and Globalization Management system technology . The headquarters of Alchemy Software Development Limited are located in Dublin. The company also has offices located in Japan, Germany and the USA. Catalyst 9.0 was released late 2010.<ref>http://www.alchemysoftware.ie/company/news/pr_001130.html</ref> ==Alchemy CATALYST 8.0== Alchemy CATALYST is a software localisation tool and was one of the first tools that contained integrated [[translation memory]] technology. The latest version of Alchemy CATALYST version 8.0 was released on the 14th of February 2009.Alchemy CATALYST 8.0 is an Object Oriented localization environment. <ref>http://www.alchemysoftware.ie/estore/order_catalyst_7.html</ref> ===Alchemy Experts=== Alchemy Experts are automation processes designed to omit repetitive tasks within the localisation process. The following are experts found in Alchemy Catalyst: # '''Validate Expert''': This expert detects,locates and fixes common errors that can occur in the localisation procedure such as incorrect spellings and truncated text.The Runtime Validate Expert which accompanies the Validate Expert in the Localizer Edition and Developer/Pro Editions allows the user to carry out this process while the software is running. # '''Pseudo-Translate Text''': This expert allows the user to pseudo-translate the [[translation]] which is the process of creating text that mimics a foreign language without the benefit of actual [[translation]] into another language.<ref>http://www.inter-locale.com/demos/pseudo.jsp</ref> # '''Visual Comparison Expert''': This is used to compare the changes in two application files and detect missing resources. # '''Leverage Expert''': This allows the user to reuse TM files using Alchemy CATALYST'S ezMatch [[translation memory]] technology. These files are stored in .ttk, .tmx and .tmx format. # '''Layout Manager''': The Layout Manager allows the user to automatically create localised layouts by resizing controls,dialogs and buttons ensuring that any text that has expanded during the [[translation]] process will fit appropriately on the user interface. # '''QuickShip Expert''': The Quickship Expert is used to distribute files to translators. It does this by placing all project TTK files, glossary files and user instructions into a compressed executable file known as a Quickship bundle. The QuickShip bundle which is sent to the translator extracts all constituent files and attaches any glossary files to the translators version of Alchemy CATALYST'S Translator/Lite which is then launched. <ref>http://www.alchemysoftware.ie/products/productline.html</ref> # '''Analysis Expert''': This expert allows the user to perform an analysis
