It is a specific version of a [[numerical control|CNC]]tool. CNC Routers come in many configurations including the small home style "desktop" CNC routers to the large "gantry" CNC routers used in boat making facilities. Although there are many configurations, most CNC routers have a few specific parts, a dedicated CNC controller, one or more spindle motors, AC inverters, and a table. CNC routers are generally available in 3 axis and 5 axis cnc router formats. The CNC router is run by a computer. Coordinates are uploaded into the machine controller from a separate program. CNC router owners will have two programs, one program to make designs and another to upload designs to the machine and run it. CNC routers can be controlled directly by manual programming, but the full potential of the machine can only be achieved if they are controlled from files created by [[CAD]]/[[Computer-aided manufacturing|CAM]] [[software]]. There are a number of domestic and international brands on the market, most of which are of high quality. Some of the CNC router brands are DMS Routers, FMT Routers, Quintax, CMS, CMT, Multicam, Thermwood. There are competitively priced machines which many small work-shop owners might find attractive. CNC Routers can be very useful when carrying out identical, repetitive jobs. A CNC router typically produces consistent and high quality work and improves factory productivity. A CNC router can reduce waste, frequency of errors and the time the finished product takes to get to market. For example, CNC routers can perform the tasks of many carpentry shop machines such as the [[panel saw]], the [[spindle moulder]], and the [[Tunnel boring machine|boring machine]]. It can also cut [[mortise and tenon|mortise]]s and [[tennon]]s. A CNC router gives more flexibility to the manufacturing process. It can be used in the production of many different items, such as: door [[Wood carving|carving]]s, interior and exterior decorations, wood panels, sign boards, wooden frames, [[molding (decorative)|molding]]s, musical instruments, furniture manufacturing and so on. In addition, the CNC router makes thermo-forming of plastics easier by automating the trimming process. CNC Routers help ensure part repeatability and helps factory output. ==External links== *[http://www.cncrouter.info CNC Router Information] {{DEFAULTSORT:Cnc Router}} [[Category:Woodworking machines]] [[Category:Wood carving]] {{Compu-hardware-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>5113</id> <title>CNEWS (magazine)</title> <text>{{Primarysources|date=December 2008}} Monthly '''C News''' is a leading ICT magazine of [[Bangladesh]].

Its existence was established by French [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/texteconsolide/PPEAU.htm loi n° 78-17], concerning [[computer]]s, [[Computer file|files]] and [[liberty|liberties]] (data privacy) and enacted into law on 6 January 1978. Since 2004, the CNIL has been presided over by [[Alex Türk]], a right-wing senator and former member of the [[Rassemblement pour la République|Rally for the Republic]] (RPR). ==History== [[SAFARI]] was an attempt by the [[France|French]] government to create a centralized [[Government database|database]] of personal data. On March 21 1974, an article in the newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'', "''SAFARI ou la chasse aux Français'' (SAFARI; or, Hunting Frenchmen) brought public attention to the project. The newly named Interior Minister [[Jacques Chirac]] had to face the public uproar. Nominated following the events of[[May'68]], Chirac succeeded [[Raymond Marcellin]], who had been forced to resign in the end of February 1974 after having attempted to place [[wiretap]]s in the offices of the ''[[Canard enchaîné]]'' weekly newspaper. The massive popular rejection of this project promoted the creation of the CNIL. At the beginning of 1980, when the CNIL began its main
