While she can listen in on messages between Alice and Bob, she cannot modify them. In [[quantum cryptography]], Eve may also represent the ''environment''. * '''Fran''', for [[Fran Allen]], Turing award winner * '''Gordon''', a [[government]] agent. * '''Isaac''', an [[Internet Service Provider]] (ISP). * '''Ivan''', an ''issuer'' (as in financial cryptography). * '''Justin''', or '''Julian''' from the ''justice'' system. * {{Anchor|Mallory}}'''Mallory''', a ''malicious attacker''; unlike Eve, Mallory can modify messages, substitute her own messages, replay old messages, and so on. The problem of securing a system against Mallory is much greater than against Eve. The names '''Marvin''', '''Mallet''', and [[Professor Moriarty|Moriarty]] can also be used for this role. * {{Anchor|Matilda}}'''Matilda''', a ''merchant'' (as in e-commerce or financial cryptography). * '''Oscar''', an ''[[Adversary (cryptography)|opponent]]'', is usually taken as equivalent to Mallory. * '''Pat''' or '''Peggy''', a ''prover'', and '''Victor''', a ''verifier'', often must interact in some way to show that the intended transaction has actually taken place. They are often found in [[zero-knowledge proof]]s. Another name pair sometimes used is '''Pat''' and '''Vanna''' (after the [[Pat Sajak|host]] and [[Vanna White|hostess]] on the ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' television show). * '''Plod''', a law enforcement officer from the children's fictional character [[Mr. Plod]], in the ''[[Noddy (character)|Noddy]]'' books by [[Enid Blyton]]. * '''Steve''', sometimes used in reference to [[Steganography]]. * '''Trent''', a ''trusted arbitrator'', is some kind of [[Trusted Third Party|neutral third party]], whose exact role varies with the protocol under discussion. * '''Trudy''', an intruder: another alternative to Mallory. * '''Vanna''' or '''Victor''': see '''Pat''' or '''Peggy''' above * '''Walter''', a ''[[Prison warden|warden]]'', may be needed to guard Alice and Bob in some respect, depending on the protocol being discussed. * '''Zoe''', often the last party to be involved in a [[cryptographic protocol]]. Although an [[interactive proof system]] is not quite a cryptographic protocol, it is sufficiently related to mention the cast of characters its literature features: * '''Arthur''' and '''Merlin''': In interactive proof systems, the prover has unbounded computational ability and is hence associated with [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]], the powerful [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]]. He claims the truth of a statement, and [[King Arthur|Arthur]], the wise king, questions him to verify the claim. These two characters also give the name for two [[complexity class]]es, namely [[MA (complexity)|MA]] and [[AM (complexity)|AM]]. A similar pair of characters is '''Paul''' and '''Carole'''. The characters were introduced in the solution of the [[Twenty Questions]] problem,<ref>{{citation |last1=Spencer|first1=Joel|author1-link=Joel Spencer | last2=Winkler|first2=Peter|author2-link=Peter Winkler | title=Three Thresholds for a Liar | url=http://math.dartmouth.edu/~pw/papers/3thresh.ps | journal=Combinatorics, Probability and Computing | year=1992 | volume=1 | pages=81–93}}</ref> where "Paul", who asked questions, stood for [[Paul Erdős]] and "Carole", who answered them, was an [[anagram]] of "oracle". They were further used in certain [[Combinatorial game theory|combinatorial games]] in the roles of Pusher and Chooser respectively, and have since been used in various roles.<ref>{{citation |last=Muthukrishnan|first=S. | title=Data Streams: Algorithms and Applications | isbn=9781933019147 | publisher=[http://books.google.com/books?id=415loiMd_c0C&pg=PA2&dq=%22paul+and+carole%22 Now Publishers] | year=2005 | url=http://algo.research.googlepages.com/eight.ps | page=3}}</ref> ==See also== * [[Dave and Sue]] * [[John Doe]] * [[George Spelvin]] * [[Metasyntactic variable]] ==Notes== <references /> ==References== * C.H.
