an open (complex) concept which has an aggregation type of relationship with two closed (complex) concepts and one standard concept. The two closed concepts are not expanded in this particular context. The following picture (figure 2.2.1) is the process-data diagram of the Plan sub-process. This picture shows the integration of the two models. The dotted arrows indicate which concepts are created or adjusted in the corresponding activities of the Plan sub-process. [[Image:Plan process data model.jpg]] Figure 2.2.1: Process-data model Plan sub-process ===Implementation=== The Implementation sub-process makes sure that all measures, as specified in the plans, are properly implemented. During the Implementation sub-process no (new) measures are defined nor changed. The definition or change of measures will take place in the Plan sub-process in cooperation with the Change Management Process. The activities that take place in the implementation sub-process are summed up in the following table (table 2.3.1). The table contains the name of the (sub) activity and a short definition of the activity. {| class="wikitable" ! Activities ! Sub-Activities ! Descriptions |- | rowspan=5 |Implement | Classifying and managing of IT applications | Process of formally grouping ''configuration items'' by type, e.g., software, hardware, documentation, environment, application. Process of formally identifying changes by type e.g., project scope change request, validation change request, infrastructure change request this process leads to ''asset classification and control documents''. |- | Implement personnel security | Here measures are adopted in order to give personnel safety and confidence and measures to prevent a crime/fraud. The process ends with ''personnel security''. |- | Implement security management | In this process specific security requirements and/or security rules that must be met are outlined and documented. The process ends with ''security policies''. |- | Implement access control | In this process specific access security requirements and/or access security rules that must be met are outlined and documented. The process ends with ''access control''. |- | Reporting | In this process the whole ''implement as planned process'' is documented in a specific way. This process ends with ''reports''. |} Table 2.3.1: (Sub) activities and descriptions Implementation sub-process ITIL Security Management The left side of figure 2.3.1 is the meta-process model of the Implementation phase. The four labels with a black shadow mean that these activities are closed concepts and they are not expanded in this context. It is also noticeable that there are no arrows connecting these four activities this means that these activities are unordered and the reporting will be carried out after the completion of al the four activities. During the implementation phase there are a number of concepts that are created and /or adjusted. See table 2.3.2 for an overview of the most common concepts and their description. {| class="wikitable" ! Concept !! Description |- | Implementation | Accomplished security management according to the security management plan. |- | Asset classification and control documents | A comprehensive inventory of assets with responsibility assigned to ensure that effective security protection is maintained. |- | Personnel security | Well defined job descriptions for all staff outlining security roles and responsibilities. |- | Security policies | Security policies are documents that outlines specific security requirements or security rules that must be met. |- | Access control | Network management to ensure that only those with the appropriate responsibility have access to information in the networks and the protection of the supporting infrastructure. |} Table 2.3.2: Concept and definition Implementation sub-process Security management The concepts created and/or adjusted are modeled using the meta-modeling technique. The right side of figure 2.3.1 is the meta-data model of the implementation sub-process. The implementation documents are an open concept and is expanded upon in this context. It consists of four closed concepts which are not expanded because they are irrelevant in this particular context. In order to make the relations between the two models clearer the integration of the two models are illustrated in figure 2.3.1. The dotted arrows running from the activities to the concepts illustrate which concepts are created/ adjusted in the corresponding activities. [[Image:Implementation process data model.jpg]] Figure 2.3.1: Process-data model Implementation sub-process ===Evaluation=== The evaluation of the implementation and the plans is very important. The evaluation is necessary to measure the success of the implementation and the Security plans. The evaluation is also very important for the clients (and possibly third parties). The results of the Evaluation sub-process are used to maintain the agreed measures and the implementation itself. Evaluation results can lead to new requirements and so lead to a [[Request for Change]]. The request for change is then defined and it is then send to the Change Management process. Mainly there are three sorts of evaluation; the Self assessment; internal audit, and external audit. The self assessment is mainly carried out in the organization of the processes. The internal audits are carried out by internal IT-auditors and the external audits are carried out by external independent IT-auditors. Besides, the evaluations already mentioned an evaluation based on the communicated security incidents will also take place. The most important activities for this evaluation are the security monitoring of IT-systems; verify if the security legislation and the implementation of the security plans are complied; trace and react to undesirable use of the IT-supplies. The activities that take place in the evaluation sub-process are summed up in the following table (Table 2.4.1). The table contains the name of the (sub) activity and a short definition of the activity. {| class="wikitable" ! Activities !! Sub-Activities !! Descriptions |- | rowspan=5 | Evaluate | Self assessment | In this process an examination of the implemented security agreements is done by the organization of the process itself. The result of this process is SELF ASSESSMENT DOCUMENTS. |- | Internal Audit | In this process an examination of the implemented security agreements is done by an internal EDP auditor. The result of this process is INTERNAL AUDIT. |- | External audit | In this process an examination of the implemented security agreements is done by an external
