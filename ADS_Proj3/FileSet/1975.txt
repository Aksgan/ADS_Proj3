"Cleopatra"),<ref>[http://www.electronichouse.com/article/an_avatar_is_born/C203/ Cleopatra]</ref>, [[e-Home Automation]], ... allows the control to happen from a single computer or television screen, and/or even from a smart phone (ie iPhone).<ref>[http://www.e-homeautomation.com E-home automation: centralised control, iPhone functionality]</ref> == Tasks == === HVAC === [[HVAC|Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC)]] solutions include temperature and [[humidity]] control. This is generally one of the most important aspects to a homeowner. An Internet-controlled [[thermostat]], for example, can both save money and help the environment, by allowing the homeowner to control the building's heating and air conditioning systems remotely. <!-- or you could just push down the temperature when you leave for vacation--> === Lighting === [[Lighting control system]]s can be used to control household electric lights. * Extinguish all the lights of the house * Replace manual switching with Automation of on and off signals for any or all lights * Regulation of electric illumination levels according to the level of ambient light available * Change the ambient colour of lighting via control of [[LED]]s or electronic dimmers Natural lighting control involves controlling window shades, LCD shades, draperies and awnings. === Audio and video === This category includes audio and video switching and distribution. Multiple audio or video sources can be selected and distributed to one or more rooms. === Security === Control and integration of [[security systems]]. With Home Automation, the consumer can select and watch [[cameras]] live from an Internet source to their home or business. Security cameras can be controlled, allowing the user to observe activity around a house or business right from a [[visual display unit|Monitor]] or [[touch panel]]. Security systems can include motion sensors that will detect any kind of unauthorized movement and notify the user through the security system or via cell phone. This category also includes control and distribution of security [[cameras]] (see [[surveillance]]). * Detection of possible [[intrusion]] ** [[sensor]]s of detection of movement ** sensors of magnetic contact of [[door]]/[[window]] ** sensors of glass breaking ** sensors of pressure changes * [[Simulation]] of presence. * Detection of fire, gas leaks, water leaks (see [[fire alarm]] and [[gas alarm]]) * Medical [[alert]]. Teleassistance. * Precise and safe closing of [[Window blind|blinds.]] === Intercoms === An [[intercom]] system allows communication via a [[microphone]] and [[loud speaker]] between multiple rooms. Integration of the [[intercom]] to the [[telephone]], or of the video door entry system to the television set, allowing the residents to view the door camera automatically. === Robotics === * Control of [[home robot]]s, using if necessary domotic [[electric beacon]]. * Home robot communication (i.e. using [[WiFi]]) with the domotic network and other home robots. === Other systems === [[File:Cat feeder.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A homemade Internet-enabled cat feeder.]] Using special hardware, almost any device can be monitored and controlled automatically or remotely, including: *[[Coffee pot]] *[[Garage door]] *Pet feeding and watering *[[Irrigation sprinkler|Plant watering]] *Pool pump(s) and heater, Hot tub and Spa *[[Sump Pump]] ==Costs== An automated home can be a very simple grouping of controls, or it can be heavily automated where any appliance that is plugged into electrical power is remotely controlled. Costs mainly include equipment, components, furniture, and custom installation.<ref name="Costs 2">{{cite web|url=http://www.totalavcontrol.co.uk |title=Home automation costs |publisher=Totalavcontrol.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-02-18}}</ref> Ongoing costs include electricity to run the control systems, maintenance costs for the control and networking systems, including troubleshooting, and eventual cost of upgrading as standards change. Increased complexity may also increase maintenance costs for networked devices. Learning to use a complex system effectively may take significant time and training. Control system security may be difficult and costly to maintain, especially if the control system extends beyond the home, for instance by wireless or by connection to the internet or other networks. == Smart Grid == Home automation technologies are viewed as integral additions to the [[Smart grid]]. The ability to control lighting, appliances, HVAC as well as [[Smart Grid]] applications (load shedding, demand response, real-time power usage and price reporting) <ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.insteonsmartgrid.com/About-Us.html|accessdate= 2009-11-20| title= About Us|publisher=InsteonSmartGrid.com}}</ref> will become vital as Smart Grid initiatives are rolled out.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} Green Automation is the term coined to describe energy management strategies in home automation when data from smart grids is combined with home automation systems to use resources either at there cheapest prices or most available. For example taking advantage of high solar panel out put in the middle of the day to run washing machines automatically. == Organizations == *[[CEDIA]] *[[Continental Automated Buildings Association]] *[[Digital Living Network Alliance]] *[[CENELEC]] *[[MIT]] [[AgeLab]] *[[SIMO TCI]] *[[Living Tomorrow]] *[http://www.neca.asn.au National Electrical and communications Association] *[http://www.copper.com.au/cdc Copper Development Center] *[http://www.smartwiredhouse.com.au Smart Wiring] == See also == {{Commons category}} *[[AMX LLC]] *[[Crestron]] *[[DASH7]] *[[Digital car]] *[[e-Home Automation]] *[[EnOcean]] *[[Floor plan]] and [[house navigation system]] *[[Gate operator]] *[[Home energy monitor]] *[[Home of the future]] *[[Home network]] *[[Information appliance]] *[[Nice]] *[[Touchscreen|Touchscreen/Touch panel]] *[[Xanadu Houses]] *[[Ubiquitous computing]] *[[Video commerce]] == References == <references/> == External links == *{{dmoz|Computers/Home_Automation/|Home Automation}} * [http://www.diy-ha.com Home Automation Guides] — Provides advice for DIY home automation projects, including weather sensing, furnace control, voice recognition, and surveillance * [http://www2.lse.ac.uk/media@lse/whosWho/AcademicStaff/LeslieHaddon/ShapeofThings.pdf ALAN CAWSON, LESLIE HADDON, IAN MILES PREST, ''The Shape of Things to Consume'' ] *[http://www.podtech.net/home/4863/a-tour-of-hps-smarthouse Virtual tour of HP SmartHome] {{DEFAULTSORT:Home Automation}} [[Category:Home automation|*]] [[Category:Building engineering]] [[ar:أتمتة المنزل]] [[ca:Domòtica]] [[de:Hausautomation]] [[es:Domótica]] [[eu:Domotika]] [[fr:Domotique]] [[gl:Domótica]] [[ko:스마트 홈]] [[hi:गृह स्वचालन]] [[it:Domotica]] [[he:בית חכם]] [[nl:Domotica]] [[ja:ホームオートメーション]] [[pl:Automatyka domowa]] [[pt:Domótica]] [[ro:Domotică]] [[sl:Pametni dom]] [[sr:Систем кућне аутоматике]] [[fi:Kotiautomaatio]] [[ta:வீட்டுத் தன்னியக்கம்]] [[vi:Nhà thông minh]]</text> </page> <page> <id>16892</id> <title>Homeland Security Digital Library</title> <text>{{orphan|date=September 2009}} {{noref|date=December 2010}} The '''Homeland Security Digital Library''' (HSDL) is a collection of documents related to [[homeland security]] policy, strategy, and organizational management of the [[United States]].
