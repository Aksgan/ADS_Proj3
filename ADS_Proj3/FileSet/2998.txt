Thus, some philosophers may hold that the [[universe]] is really just one thing, despite its many appearances and diversities; or theology may support the view that there is one God, with many manifestations in different religions. [[Hinduism]] is considered to be primary proponent of Monism. In the Hindu religion, [[Brahman]] (Devanāgarī: ब्रह्मन् bráhman) is the eternal, unchanging, infinite, immanent, and transcendent reality which is the Divine Ground of all matter, energy, time, space, being, and everything beyond in this Universe. The nature of Brahman is described as transpersonal, personal and impersonal by different philosophical schools and the Brahman religious belief is just seen as different paths to the one god. <ref>Brodd, Jefferey (2003).

Reality is some, one thing, but we cannot know what. * [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]]: Air. * [[Heraclitus]]: Fire (in that everything is in constant flux). * [[Parmenides]]: Being. Reality is an unmoving perfect sphere, unchanging, undivided. And post-Socrates: * Neopythagorians such as [[Apollonius of Tyana]] centered their cosmologies on the [[Monad (Greek philosophy)|Monad]] or One. * [[Stoics]], like [[Spinoza]] later, taught that there is only one substance, identified as God. * Middle Platonism under such works as [[Numenius of Apamea|Numenius]] express the Universe emanating from the Monad or One. * [[Neoplatonism]] is Monistic. [[Plotinus]] taught that there was an ineffable transcendent God, 'The One,' of which subsequent realities were emanations. From The One emanates the Divine Mind ([[Nous]]), the Cosmic Soul ([[Psyche (psychology)|Psyche]]), and the World ([[Cosmos]]). == Monism, pantheism, and panentheism == Following a long and still current tradition [[Huw Owen|H.P. Owen]] (1971: 65) claimed that : "[[Pantheist]]s are ‘monists’...they believe that there is only one Being, and that all other forms of reality are either modes (or appearances) of it or identical with it." Although almost all pantheists are monists, some pantheists may also be not-monists, but undeniably monists were the most famous pantheisms as that of [[Stoics]], [[Plotinus]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]]. Exclusive Monists believe that the universe, the "God" of naturalistic pantheism, simply does not exist. In addition, monists can be [[Deism|Deists]], [[Pandeism|Pandeists]], [[Theism|Theists]] or [[Panentheism|Panentheists]]; believing in a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] God that is omnipotent and all-pervading, and both transcendent and immanent. There are monist pantheists and panentheists in [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Hinduism]] (particularly in [[Advaita]] and [[Vishistadvaita]] respectively), [[Judaism]] (monistic panentheism is especially found in [[Kabbalah]] and [[Hasidic philosophy]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}), and in [[Islam]] (among the [[Sufis]], especially the [[Bektashi]]). While pantheism means all things are identical to God, pan''en''theism means ''God is in all things'', neither identical to, nor totally separate from all things. Such a concept, some may argue, is more compatible with God as personal while not barring a bridge between God and creation. Historical figures such as Paul Tillich have argued for such a concept within Christian theology, as has contemporary biblical scholar Marcus Borg and theologian Matthew Fox, an Episcopal priest. [[Creation Spirituality]]. == Monism in religious and spiritual systems == === Hinduism === Monism is found in the [[Nasadiya Sukta]] of the [[Rigveda]], which speaks of the [[Ekam|One]] being-non-being that 'breathed without breath'. The first system in Hinduism that unequivocally explicated [[absolute monism]] was the non-dualist philosophy of [[Advaita]] [[Vedanta]] as expounded by [[Adi Sankara|Shankara]]. In short, Advaita declares - All is [[Brahman]]. It is part of the six [[Hindu]] systems of [[philosophy]], based on the [[Upanishads]], and posits that the ultimate monad is a formless, ineffable divine ground of all being. [[Vishishtadvaita]], qualified monism, is from the school of [[Ramanuja]]. [[Shuddhadvaita]], in-essence monism, is the school of [[Vallabha]]. [[Dvaitadvaita]], differential monism, is a school founded by [[Nimbarka]]. [[Dvaita]], [[dualism]], is a school founded by [[Madhvacharya]] is probably the only Vedantic System which is opposed to all types of monism. It believes that God is eternally different from souls and matter in both form and essence. All [[Vaishnava]] schools are [[panentheistic]] and view the universe as part of [[Krishna]] or [[Narayana]], but see a plurality of souls and substances within [[Brahman]]. Monistic theism, which includes the concept of a personal God as a [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]], [[omnipotent]] [[Supreme Being]] who is both [[Immanence|immanent]] and [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], is prevalent within many other schools of Hinduism as well. The concept of [[Brahman]] explains the prevalence of Monism in Hinduism. According to Hinduism, Brahman is the eternal, unchanging, infinite, immanent, and transcendent reality which is the Divine Ground of all matter, energy, time, space, being, and everything beyond in this Universe.[1] The nature of Brahman is described as transpersonal, personal and impersonal by different philosophical schools.<ref>Brodd, Jefferey (2003).
