Despite releasing some conventional [[shareware]] and desktop [[application software|applications]], Signwave have also received attention and awards from arts organisations such as [[Transmediale]] and [[Ars Electronica]] for their [[software art|software artworks]]. Typically their software challenges the traditional notions of functionality and efficiency as key selling points of [[proprietary software]], instead focussing on the role of the [[author]]/[[artist]] as a creative role. When considering the role of the [[programmer]] in the production of software, their products can be seen in a new light: that of programming as a creative expression, and of proprietary software as an artefact or [[Work of art|artwork]]. This contentious issue is hotly debated, with people on both the 'arts' as well as the 'technology' sides of the argument denying the right of [[artist]] to the [[programmer]]. To date, Signwave have released two major software artworks, [[Autoshop]] (a parody of [[Adobe Photoshop]]), and [[Auto-Illustrator]] (a similar but more advanced parody of [[Adobe Illustrator]]), both artworks being purchasable online through the distribution of [[serial number]]s. This deliberate conflation of polemic extremes is typical of Signwave's practice, forcing a fresh consideration of the traditional values of both [[commerce]] and [[art]]. == External links == *[http://www.signwave.co.uk/ Signwave UK official web site] [[Category:Software companies of the United Kingdom]] [[Category:Computer art]] [[Category:Companies based in London]]</text> </page> <page> <id>34389</id> <title>Silicon Fen</title> <text>'''Silicon Fen''' (sometimes '''the Cambridge Cluster''') is the name given to the region around [[Cambridge]], [[England]], which is home to a large [[business cluster|cluster]] of [[high-tech]] [[business]]es, especially those related to [[software]], [[electronics]], and [[biotechnology]]. Many of these have connections with the [[University of Cambridge]], and the area is now one of the most important technology centres in [[Europe]]. It is called "Silicon Fen" by analogy with [[Silicon Valley]] in [[California]], because it lies at the south of [[The Fens|Fenland]]. ==Business growth== In 2004, 24% of all UK [[venture capital]] (9% of all the EU's) was received by Silicon Fen companies, according to the Cambridge Cluster Report 2004 produced by Library House and Grant Thornton. The so-called ''Cambridge phenomenon'', giving rise to start-up companies in a town previously only having a little light industry in the [[electrical engineering|electrical sector]], is usually dated to the founding of the [[Cambridge Science Park]] in 1970: this was an initiative of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] and moved away from a traditional low-development policy for Cambridge. The characteristic of Cambridge is small companies (as few as three people, in some cases) in sectors such as [[computer-aided design]]. Over time the number of companies has grown; it has not proved easy to count them, but recent estimates have placed the number anywhere between 1,000 and 3,500 companies.{{Fact|date=August 2008}} They are spread over an area defined perhaps by the CB [[postcode]] or 01223 [[telephone]] [[area code]], or more generously in an area bounded by [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]], [[Newmarket,
