industrial practitioners. </ref> [[Genichi Taguchi|Taguchi]]'s work includes three principal contributions to statistics: :*A specific [[loss function]] &mdash; see [[Taguchi loss function]]; :*The philosophy of ''off-line quality control''; and :*Innovations in the [[design of experiments]]. ==Loss functions== ===Loss functions in statistical theory=== Traditionally, statistical methods have relied on [[unbiased estimator|mean-unbiased estimators]] of [[treatment effect]]s: Under the conditions of the [[Gauss-Markov theorem]], [[least squares]] estimators have minimum variance among all mean-unbiased estimators. The emphasis on comparisons of means also draws (limiting) comfort from the [[law of large numbers]], according to which the [[sample mean]]s [[converge]] to the true mean. Fisher's textbook on the [[design of experiments]] emphasized comparisons of treatment means. [[Gauss]] proved that the [[sample mean|sample-mean]] minimizes the expected squared-error [[loss function|loss-function]] (while [[Laplace]] proved that a [[median]]-[[unbiased estimator]] minimizes the [[absolute value|absolute]]-error loss function). In [[statistical theory]], the central role of the loss function was renewed by the [[statistical decision theory]] of [[Abraham Wald]]. However, loss functions were avoided by [[Ronald A. Fisher]].<ref>In fact, Fisher labelled [[loss functions]] as being better suited for American businessmen and Soviet comisars than for empirical scientists (in Fisher's 1956 attack on Wald in the 1956 ''JRSS'').</ref> ===Taguchi's use of loss functions=== Taguchi knew [[statistical theory]] mainly from the followers of [[Ronald A. Fisher]], who also avoided [[loss function]]s. Reacting to Fisher's methods in the [[design of experiments]], Taguchi interpreted Fisher's methods as being adapted for seeking to improve the [[mean]] outcome of a [[wikt:process|process]]. Indeed, Fisher's work had been largely motivated by programmes to compare agricultural yields under different treatments and blocks, and such experiments were done as part of a long-term programme to improve harvests. However, Taguchi realised that in much industrial production, there is a need to produce an outcome ''on target'', for example, to [[machine]] a hole to a specified diameter, or to manufacture a [[electrochemical cell|cell]] to produce a given [[voltage]]. He also realised, as had [[Walter A. Shewhart]] and others before him, that excessive variation lay at the root of poor manufactured quality and that reacting to individual items inside and outside specification was counterproductive. He therefore argued that [[quality engineering]] should start with an understanding of [[quality costs]] in various situations. In much conventional [[industrial engineering]], the quality costs are simply represented by the number of items outside specification multiplied by the cost of rework or scrap. However, Taguchi insisted that manufacturers broaden their horizons to consider ''cost to society''. Though the short-term costs may simply be those of non-conformance, any item manufactured away from nominal would result in some loss to the customer or the wider community through early wear-out; difficulties in interfacing with other parts, themselves probably wide of nominal; or the need to build in safety margins. These losses are [[externalities]] and are usually ignored by manufacturers, which are more interested in their [[private cost]]s than [[social cost]]s. Such externalities prevent markets from operating efficiently, according to analyses of [[public economics]]. Taguchi argued that such losses would inevitably find their way back to the originating corporation (in an effect similar to the [[tragedy of the commons]]), and that by working to minimise them, manufacturers would enhance brand reputation, win markets and generate profits. Such losses are, of course, very small when an item is near to negligible. [[Donald J. Wheeler]] characterised the region within specification limits as where we ''deny that losses exist''. As we diverge from nominal, losses grow until the point where ''losses are too great to deny'' and the specification limit is drawn. All these losses are, as [[W. Edwards Deming]] would describe them, ''unknown and unknowable'', but Taguchi wanted to find a useful way of representing them statistically. Taguchi specified three situations: #Larger the better (for example, agricultural yield); #Smaller the better (for example, [[carbon dioxide]] emissions); and #On-target, minimum-variation (for example, a mating part in an assembly). The first two cases are represented by simple [[monotonic function|monotonic]] loss functions. In the third case, Taguchi adopted a squared-error loss function for several reasons: *It is the first "symmetric" term in the [[Taylor series]] expansion of [[real analytic]] loss-functions. *Total loss is measured by the [[variance]]. As variance is additive (for [[uncorrelated]] [[random variables]]), the total loss is an additive measurement of cost (for [[uncorrelated]] [[random variables]]). *The squared-error loss function is widely used in [[statistics]], following Gauss's use of the squared-error loss function in justifying the method of [[least squares]]. ===Reception of Taguchi's ideas by statisticians=== Though many of Taguchi's concerns and conclusions are welcomed by statisticians and [[economist]]s, some ideas have been especially criticized. For example, Taguchi's recommendation that industrial experiments maximise some ''[[signal-to-noise ratio]]'' (representing the magnitude of the [[Expected value|mean]] of a process compared to its variation) has been criticized widely. {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} ==Off-line quality control== ===Taguchi's rule for manufacturing=== Taguchi realized that the best opportunity to eliminate variation is during the design of a product and its manufacturing process. Consequently, he developed a strategy for quality engineering that can be used in both contexts. The process has three stages: #System design #Parameter design #Tolerance design ====System design==== This is design at the conceptual level, involving [[creativity]] and [[innovation]]. ====Parameter design==== Once the concept is established, the nominal values of the various dimensions and design parameters need to be set, the [[detail design]] phase of conventional engineering. Taguchi's radical insight was that the exact choice of values required is under-specified by the performance requirements of the system. In many circumstances, this allows the parameters to be chosen so as to minimise the effects on performance arising from variation in manufacture, environment and cumulative damage. This is sometimes called [[robustification]]. ====Tolerance design==== With a successfully completed ''parameter design'', and an understanding of the effect that the various parameters have on performance, resources can be focused on reducing and controlling variation in the critical few dimensions (see [[Pareto principle]]). ==Design of experiments== Taguchi developed his experimental theories independently. Taguchi read works following [[R. A. Fisher]] only in 1954. Taguchi's framework for [[design of experiments]] is [[idiosyncratic]] and often flawed,
