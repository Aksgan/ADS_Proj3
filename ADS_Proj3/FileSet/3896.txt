It is based on the popular{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] [[Linux distribution]] which is a Free and Open Source ([[FOSS]]) operating system and has pre-installed packages for the [[Arabic]] language. Sabily includes a set of packages that customizes Ubuntu. Ubuntu is easy to use for a novice user{{Citation needed|reliable|date=December 2010}},<ref>[https://help.ubuntu.com/9.10/switching/why-easy.html Ubuntu is easy to use]</ref> with the most-used Office, Internet, Graphics and Video applications already installed{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}. With Sabily, [[Muslim]] users have “out of the box” [[Islamic]] software and tools installed as well. Sabily includes [[Islamic]] software (prayer times tool, [[Quran]] study tool, [[Hijri]] calendar etc.) and has a custom design. The full version of Sabily comes with out of the box educational software, [[Codec|codecs]] for the most used media formats{{Citation needed|codecs for the most used media formats|date=December 2010}}.<ref>[http://www.sabily.org/website/en/sabily/content.html Sabily content]</ref> == Versions available == {{Inappropriate tone|date=June 2009}} Sabily is available as a Live DVD, which can be booted on the host computer without installation. Currently there are three versions existing: * Small version (967.96 MB): contains the main Sabily packages, including artwork and Islamic applications and Arabic support * Full version (1.55 GB): contains the same as the Small version plus multimedia, educational and miscellaneous packages (see the full list [http://www.sabily.org/website/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2&Itemid=9&lang=en here]) * Full version with recitations (3.3 GB): same as Full version plus Quran recitations provided by http://www.versebyversequran.com: Muhammad Siddeeq al-Minshawi, Huzify, Sa’ad al-Ghamadi and Mishary Rashed Alafasy.

SabreTalk was developed jointly by [[American Airlines]], [[Eastern Air Lines]] and [[IBM]]. SabreTalk programs are still running in the [[British Airways]] Flight Operations system ([[Flight Information and Control of Operations|FICO]]), although a commercially available automatic converter is being used to translate SabreTalk programs to [[C (programming language)|C]] programs. Both the Reservations and Operations Support System (OSS) of [[Delta Air Lines]] were developed using both SabreTalk and IBM 360 Assembler. Although development is currently restricted to [[C++]], the majority of Delta's programming platform remains in SabreTalk. Because of the translator<ref>S.

They need to have a fundamental knowledge of [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[physiology]], [[statistics]], [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[engineering mechanics]], [[industrial processes]], [[business]], [[communication]] and [[psychology]]. Professional safety studies include [[industrial hygiene]] and [[toxicology]], design of [[engineering hazard control]]s, [[fire protection]], [[ergonomics]], system and [[process safety]], [[system safety]], safety and health program management, [[accident investigation]] and analysis, [[product safety]], [[construction safety]], education and training methods, measurement of [[safety performance]], [[human behavior]], [[environmental safety and health]], and safety, health and [[environmental law]]s, regulations and standards. Many safety engineers have backgrounds or advanced study in other disciplines, such as management and business administration, engineering, [[system engineering]], [[requirements engineering]], [[reliability engineering]], [[maintenance]] , [[human factors]], operations, education, physical and [[social science]]s and other fields. Others have advanced study in safety. This extends their expertise beyond the basics of the safety engineering profession. ==Functions of a Safety Engineer== The major areas relating to the protection of people, property and the environment are: * Anticipate, identify and evaluate hazardous conditions and practices. * Develop hazard control designs, methods, procedures and programs. * Implement, administer and advise others on hazard control programs. * Measure, audit and evaluate the effectiveness of hazard control programs. * Draft a future safety plan and statement based on real time experiences and facts. ==Personality and
