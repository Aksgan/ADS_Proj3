Wijngaarden grammar]]s'' or ''2VW'' grammars. These have been successfully used to describe complicated languages, in particular, the syntax of the [[Algol 68]] [[programming language]]. However, it turns out that, even though affix values can only be manipulated with string concatenation, this formalism is [[Turing complete]]; hence, even the most basic questions about the language described by an arbitrary 2VW grammar are [[Undecidable language|undecidable]] in general. [[Extended Affix Grammar]]s, developed in the 1980s, are a more restricted version of the same idea. They were mainly applied to describe the grammar of natural language, e.g. English. Another possibility is to allow the values of affixes to be computed by code written in some programming language. Two basic approaches have been used: * In [[attribute grammar]]s, the affixes (called attributes) can take values from arbitrary domains (e.g. integer or real numbers, complex data structures) and arbitrary functions can be specified, written in a language of choice, to describe how affix values in rules are derived from each other. * In CDL (the [[Compiler Description Language]]) and its successor [[CDL2]], developed in the 1970s, fragments of source code (usually in [[assembly language]]) can be used in rules instead of normal right-hand sides, allowing primitives for input scanning and affix value computations to be expressed directly. Designed as a basis for practical [[compiler]] construction, this approach was used to write compilers, and other software, e.g. a [[text editor]]. == See also== *[[Extended Affix Grammar]] *[[Attribute grammar]] *[[Van Wijngaarden grammar]] == References == {{reflist}} [[Category:Formal languages]] [[Category:Compiler theory]] [[Category:Syntax]] [[Category:Grammar frameworks]]</text> </page> <page> <id>1186</id> <title>African Studies Quarterly</title> <text>{{italictitle}} {{Infobox Journal | title = African Studies Quarterly | cover = | discipline = [[African studies]] | language = | website = http://www.africa.ufl.edu/asq/prev.htm | open access = yes | link1 = | link1-name = | publisher = Center for African Studies, University of Florida | country = United States | abbreviation = | history = | frequency = Quarterly | ISSN = 1093-2658 | eISSN = | Jstor = | OCLC = | LCCN = }} '''''African Studies Quarterly''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] electronic [[academic journal]] published quarterly by the Center for African Studies at the [[University of Florida]] in [[Gainesville]], [[Florida|Florida, USA]].

Common aggregate functions include: * [[Average]]() * [[Counting|Count]]() * [[Maximum]]() * [[Median]]() * [[Minimum]]() * [[Mode (statistics)|Mode]]() * [[Sum]]() Aggregate functions are common in numerous [[programming languages]] such as [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], in [[spreadsheet]]s, and in [[relational algebra]]. ==SQL Aggregate Functions== SQL aggregate functions return a single value, calculated from values in a column. Useful aggregate functions: * AVG() - Returns the average value * COUNT() - Returns the number of rows * FIRST() - Returns the first value * LAST() - Returns the last value * MAX() - Returns the largest value * MIN() - Returns the smallest value * SUM() - Returns the sum ==See also== * [[Group by (SQL)]], SQL implementation ==References== <references/> {{DEFAULTSORT:Aggregate Function}} {{Compu-lang-stub}} [[Category:Subroutines]] [[ar:وظيفة كلية]] [[cs:Agregační funkce]] [[uk:Агрегатна функція]]</text> </page> <page> <id>1237</id> <title>Agitator (device)</title> <text>{{Unreferenced stub|date=December 2009}} {{Lead too short|date=March 2010}} An '''agitator''' is a [[device]] or [[mechanism]] to put something into [[Motion (physics)|motion]] by [[wikt:shaking|shaking]] or [[wikt:stirring|stirring]]. ==Manual agitator== * A [[Rock (geology)|rock]] can be a device used to agitate dirt and other solids from fabric in washing * [[Dishwasher#Manual dishwashers|Manual dishwashers]] * A [[stirring rod]] ==Washing machine agitator== [[Image:Washing machine agitator.JPG|thumb|Agitator for a laundromat washing machine.]] In a top load [[washing machine]] the agitator projects from the bottom of the wash basket and creates the wash action by rotating back and forth, rolling garments from the top of the load, down to the bottom, then back up again and due to that it seems so. There are several types of agitators with the most common are the "straight-vane" and "dual-action." The "straight-vane" is a one-part agitator with bottom and side fins that usually turns back and forth. The Dual-action is a two-part agitator that has bottom washer fins that moves back and forth and a spiral top that rotates clockwise to help guide the clothes to the bottom washer fins. The modern agitator, which is the dual action, was first made in [[Kenmore]] washing machines in the 1980s to present. These agitators are known by [[Kenmore]] as dual-rollover and triple-rollover action agitators. ==Magnetic agitator== This is a device formed by a little metallic bar (called the agitation bar) which is normally covered by a plastic layer, and by a sheet that has underneath it a rotatory magnet or a series of electromagnets arranged in a circular form to create a magnetic rotatory field. It is very common that the sheet has an arrangement of electric resistances that can heat some chemical solutions. Thus, during the operation of a typical magnetic agitator, the magnetic agitator bar is moved inside a container that can be a flask or a glass with some liquid inside that can be agitated. The container must be placed on the sheet, so that the magnetic field influences the agitation bar and makes it rotate. This allows it to mix
