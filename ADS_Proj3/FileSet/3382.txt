that might be categorized as instances of the ontology. Candidate phrases are proper nouns, identified by a standard [[part-of-speech tagging]] procedure. All candidate proper nouns and all candidate ontology concepts are introduced into linguistic patterns to derive hypothesis phrases. Then Google is queried for the hypothesis phrases through its Web service API. Finally the system sums up the query results to a total for each instance-concept pair and categorizes the candidate proper nouns into their highest rank concepts. The results are comparable to state of the art systems, whereas the approach is simpler and more intuitive to use to annotate the web.

Another key strength is that it is readily amenable to efficient massive parallelization, making it highly effective for very large systems.<ref>A. Stathopoulos, S. Öğüt, Y. Saad, J. R.

The code is freely available under the [[GNU GPL]]. Currently, its public version is 1.1. Some of the physical/chemical properties calculated by this code are: Kohn-Sham [[band structure]], atomic forces (including molecular dynamics capabilities), static [[electric susceptibility|susceptibility]], [[magnetic dipole moment]], and many additional molecular and solid state properties. ==See also== *[[Density functional theory]] *[[Quantum chemistry computer programs]] ==References== <references/> [[Category:Physics software]] [[Category:Density functional theory]] [[Category:Computational chemistry software]]</text> </page> <page> <id>27995</id> <title>PATRIC</title> <text>{{otheruses|Patric (disambiguation)}} [http://www.patricbrc.org PATRIC ]<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=17142235 |year=2007 |last1=Snyder |first1=EE |last2=Kampanya |first2=N |last3=Lu |first3=J |last4=Nordberg |first4=EK |last5=Karur |first5=HR |last6=Shukla |first6=M |last7=Soneja |first7=J |last8=Tian |first8=Y |last9=Xue |first9=T |title=PATRIC: The VBI PathoSystems Resource Integration Center |volume=35 |issue=Database issue |pages=401–6 |pmc=1669763 |journal=Nucleic acids research}}</ref>, the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center, is one of the four [[Bioinformatics Resource Centers]] (BRC) funded by the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, [[NIAID]] a component of the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), which is an agency of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]].

The correct term for the whole process is '''In-service Inspection & Testing of Electrical Equipment'''. When people work with electrical appliances, [[health and safety]] regulations state that the appliance must be safe, to prevent harm to the workers. Many types of
