A LAM may have interfaces up to 20 lobes. Functionally a LAM is like a [[Media Access Unit|multi-station access unit]] (MAU), but with a larger capacity: 20 nodes as opposed to 8 nodes for MAU. The LAM interface may use either IBM connectors or [[8P8C]] (RJ-45) [[modular connector|modular plugs]]. LAMs can be [[Daisy chain#Computer Engineering|daisy chained]] and connected to a HUB, known as Controlled Access Unit (CAU) in token ring terminology. Each CAU can handle up to 4 LAMs for a total of 80 lobes.

Communication takes place between a router and the first frame relay switch it's connected to. Information about [[keepalive]]s, global addressing, [[IP Multicast]] and the status of [[virtual circuits]] is commonly exchanged using LMI. There are three standards for LMI: ANSI's T1.617 Annex D standard; ITU-T's Q.933 Annex A standard; and the "Gang of Four" standard, named for the four companies that developed it: Cisco, DEC, StrataCom and NorTel (Northern Telecom).

In particular, different utilization distributions can be constructed from data pertaining to particular periods of a diurnal or seasonal cycle. Utilization distributions are constructed from data providing the location of an individual or several individuals in space at different points in time by associating a local distribution function with each point and then summing and normalizing these local distribution functions to obtain a distribution function that pertains to the data as a whole.<ref>Silverman BW.
