key are configured. The volume is then encrypted as a background task, something that can take a considerable amount of time with a large disk as every logical sector is read, encrypted and rewritten back to disk. Only once the whole volume has been encrypted are the keys protected, and the volume considered secure. BitLocker uses a low-level device driver to encrypt and decrypt all file operations, making interaction with the encrypted volume transparent to applications running on the platform. [[Encrypting File System]] may be used in conjunction with BitLocker to provide protection once the [[kernel (computer science)|operating system kernel]] is running. Protection of the files from processes/users within the operating system can only be performed using encryption software that operates within Windows, such as Encrypting File System. BitLocker and Encrypting File System therefore offer protection against different classes of attacks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-10878_11-6162949.html |title=Prevent data theft with Windows Vista's Encrypted File System (EFS) and BitLocker |author=George Ou |date=February 28, 2007 |accessdate=2008-06-16 |publisher=[[TechRepublic]] }}</ref> In [[Active Directory]] environments, BitLocker supports optional [[key escrow]] to [[Active Directory]], although a schema update may be required for this to work (i.e. if the Active Directory Directory Services are hosted on a Windows version previous to Windows Server 2008). Other systems like BitLocker can have their recovery key/password entry process [[Spoofing attack|spoofed]] by another bootmanager or OS install. Once the spoofed software captured the secret, it could be used to decrypt the VMK, which would then allow access to decrypt or modify any information on the user's BitLocker-encrypted hard disk. By configuring a [[Trusted Platform Module|TPM]] to protect the trusted [[booting|boot]] pathway, including the [[BIOS]] and [[boot sector]], this threat can be removed. ==Security concerns== According to Microsoft sources,<ref name="backdoor">{{cite web |url = http://blogs.msdn.com/si_team/archive/2006/03/02/542590.aspx |title = Back-door nonsense |work = System Integrity Team Blog |publisher = Microsoft |accessdate = 2006-06-19 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com/Microsoft-Vista-wont-get-a-backdoor/2100-1016_3-6046016.html|title=Microsoft: Vista won't get a backdoor|date=2006-03-03|accessdate=2008-05-01|publisher=[[CNet]]}}</ref> BitLocker does not contain an intentionally built-in [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]]; there is no way for law enforcement to have a guaranteed passage to the data on the user's drives that is provided by Microsoft.

Notwithstanding the claims of [[Niels Ferguson]] and others, Microsoft Services states in [http://thibault.rouat.com/security-doc/Windows/WIN7-BITLOCKER-EFS-RMS-Draft-V1.pdf Exploration of Windows 7, Advanced Forensics Topic (page 70)], "BitLocker has a number of 'Recovery' scenarios that we can exploit", and "BitLocker, at its core, is a password technology, we simply have to get the password...". The "Transparent operation mode" and "User authentication mode" of BitLocker use the TPM hardware to detect if there are unauthorized changes to the pre-boot environment, including the [[BIOS]] and [[Master boot record|MBR]].<ref name="TPM-operation">{{cite web |url = http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/issues/2007/06/BitLocker/ |title = Keys to Protecting Data with BitLocker Drive Encryption |work = TechNet Magazine |publisher = Microsoft |accessdate = 2007-08-21 }}</ref> If any unauthorized changes are detected, BitLocker requests a recovery [[key (cryptography)|key]] on a USB device, or a recovery password entered by hand. Either of these cryptographic secrets are used to decrypt the Volume Master Key (VMK) and allow the [[booting|bootup]] process to continue.<ref name="TPM-operation"/> Nevertheless, in February 2008, a group of security researchers published details of a so called "[[cold boot attack]]" that allows a Bitlocker-protected machine to be compromised by booting the machine off removable media, such as a [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] drive, into another operating system, then dumping the contents of pre-boot memory.<ref name="ColdBoot">{{cite paper|url=http://citp.princeton.edu/memory/|title=Lest We Remember: Cold Boot Attacks on Encryption Keys|author=J.

Use of a TPM module alone does not offer any protection, as the keys are held in memory while Windows is running, although [[two-factor authentication]], i.e. using TPM together with a PIN, offers better protection for machines that are not powered on when physical access to them is obtained. Similar full disk encryption mechanisms of other vendors and other operating systems, including [[Linux]] and [[Mac OS X]], are vulnerable to the same attack.<ref name="ColdBoot"/> The authors recommend that computers be powered down when not in physical control of the owner (rather than be left in a [[power management|"sleep"]] state) and that a password also be required to boot the machine. The Recovery Key ID number can be easily obtained according to the procedure outlined in the document "[http://thibault.rouat.com/security-doc/Windows/WIN7-BITLOCKER-EFS-RMS-Draft-V1.pdf Exploration of Windows 7, Advanced Forensics Topic (pages 58-69)]." ==See also== *[[Disk encryption]] *[[Full disk encryption]] *[[Comparison of disk encryption software]] *[[Disk encryption software]] *[[Features new to Windows Vista]] *[[List of Microsoft Windows components]] *[[Vista IO technologies]] *[[Next-Generation Secure Computing Base|NGSCB]] *[[FileVault]] ==References== {{Reflist|2}} ==External links== *[http://technet2.microsoft.com/WindowsVista/en/library/58358421-a7f5-4c97-ab41-2bcc61a58a701033.mspx BitLocker Drive Encryption Technical Overview] *[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=320b9aa9-47e8-44f9-b8d0-4d7d6a75add0&DisplayLang=en Download Bitlocker Drive Preparation Tool] *[http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/platform/hwsecurity/default.mspx Windows Hardware Developer Central BitLocker Hub Page] *[http://blogs.msdn.com/si_team/default.aspx System Integrity Team Blog] *[http://www.nvlabs.in/nodes/9 Bitlocker Bootkit] *[http://testlab.sit.fraunhofer.de/downloads/Publications/Attacking_the_BitLocker_Boot_Process_Trust2009.pdf Attacking the BitLocker Boot Process] {{Windows Components}} [[Category:Windows Server 2008]] [[Category:Windows Vista]] [[Category:Cryptographic software]] [[Category:Microsoft Windows security technology]] [[Category:Disk encryption]] [[Category:Windows 7]] [[de:BitLocker]] [[es:BitLocker Drive Encryption]] [[fr:BitLocker Drive Encryption]] [[ko:비트로커 드라이브 암호화]] [[id:BitLocker Drive Encryption]] [[it:BitLocker Drive Encryption]] [[ms:BitLocker Drive Encryption]] [[nl:BitLocker]] [[no:Bitlocker]] [[pl:BitLocker]] [[pt:BitLocker]] [[ru:BitLocker Drive Encryption]] [[fi:BitLocker]] [[tr:Windows BitLocker]] [[vi:Mã hóa BitLocker]]</text> </page> <page> <id>3995</id> <title>Bit cell</title> <text>A '''bit cell''' is the length of [[magnetic tape|tape]], the area of [[disk storage|disc]] surface, or
