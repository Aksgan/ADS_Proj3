</timeline></div> Prior to Steam, Valve had problems releasing updates for their online games, such as ''[[Counter-Strike]]'', wherein a patch would result in the disconnection of the larger part of the online user base for several days. They decided to make a platform which would update games automatically, and implement better [[anti-piracy]] and [[Cheating in online games#Anti-cheating methods and limitations|anti-cheat]] measures. Valve originally approached several companies—including [[Microsoft]], [[Yahoo!]], and [[RealNetworks]]—to build a client with these features, but all turned them down.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lee|first=James|title=The Last of the Independents?|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/the-last-of-the-independents-|publisher=GamesIndustry.biz|accessdate=2010-07-09}}</ref> Steam's development began at an uncertain date prior to 2002.

The Steam client was first made available for download in 2002 during the beta period for ''[[Counter-Strike]]'' 1.6. At that time, its primary function was streamlining the patch process common in online [[computer game]]s. Installation and use of Steam was mandatory for ''Counter-Strike'' 1.6 beta testers, but Steam remained an optional component. 80,000–300,000 gamers tested the system when it was in its beta period.<ref name="salon2002" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.broadbandreports.com/shownews/32475 |title=Steam Powered – Broadband distribution system to go live – dslreports.com |publisher=Broadbandreports.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-16}}</ref> The system and web site choked under the strain of thousands of users simultaneously attempting to play the latest version of Counter-Strike.<ref name="bbr1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.broadbandreports.com/shownews/32981 |title=Losing Steam – Broadband distribution's rocky road – dslreports.com |publisher=Broadbandreports.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-16}}</ref> In 2004, the [[World Opponent Network]] was shut down and replaced by Steam.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Around this time, Valve began negotiating contracts with several publishers and independent developers to release their products on Steam.

The title required activation via Steam in order to play the game. Later in the day of the launch, a significant number of buyers (both through Steam and retail) found themselves unable to play the game, due in part to a bottleneck of Valve's Steam system.
