Guggenheim Foundation]] until 1942. He returned to New York in 1945 after serving in the [[United States Coast Guard]] to study art and philosophy at [[Cornell University]], receiving his [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]] in January 1949, and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] in September 1951. He spent two years at the [[University of Michigan]] as a [[Research assistant]], in the Language and Symbolism Project, and as an Instructor, before taking a post as Instructor at [[Harvard University]], becoming an Assistant [[Professor]], in 1954. He remained at Harvard until 1959, taking two periods of leave; to study at [[Oxford University]] in 1955, and to teach at [[Princeton University]] in 1958. From 1959 until 1964 he was Assistant Professor at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. Between 1962&ndash;1963 he studied in Rome on a Guggenheim Fellowship. From 1964&ndash;1968 he was a [[Professor]] at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], and from 1968&ndash;1970 was a Professor at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] before settling at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] as William Rand Kenan Jr. Professor from 1970 until 1988 (Professor [[Emeritus]] until 2003.) The "Robert Paul Ziff Distinguished Professorship" was established at University of North Carolina in 1994. He died in 2003. ==Philosophical and other works== ===Articles=== Paul Ziff started publishing in graduate school in 1949, doing book reviews for ''[[The Philosophical Review]]''. He kept on publishing for 41 years, his last article appearing in 1990 in a special issue of the European journal ''Dialectica''. No doubt he was asked to contribute a paper to that issue since it was dedicated - both the issue and his paper - to the memory of his former teacher at [[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[Max Black]]. Ziff published six books, 38 articles, five discussions, and 14 reviews. His first four books were published by Cornell University Press; his last two were published by [[D. Reidel|Reidel]]. When he published with Cornell, it was one of the best university presses for philosophy. He moved to Reidel in the 1980s because their managing editor, [[Jaakko Hintikka]], offered to accept two of his book-length manuscripts and publish them as consecutive volumes in the Synthese Library series. Ziff’s articles appeared most often in ''The Philosophical Review'', ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', ''The Journal of Philosophy, Analysis, and Foundations of Language'' (which became ''Studies in Language'' sometime in the late 70s). He was invited to contribute to various conference proceedings and collections, and fifteen of his articles and discussions appeared in these - some of them high-profile collections in their area at the time, including [[Jerrold Katz|Katz]] and [[Jerry Fodor|Fodor]]'s ''The Structure of Language'' (1964) and [[Gilbert Harman|Harman]] and [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Davidson]]’s ''Semantics of Natural Language'' (1972). Most of Ziff’s articles (29) show up in his books. One that did not, "About Proper Names" from ''Mind'', was selected as one of the best philosophy articles of 1977 and reprinted in ''The Philosopher’s Annual''. Ziff published mainly in the areas of [[philosophy of language]], [[Aesthetics|philosophy of art]], [[philosophy of mind]], and [[epistemology]], but also had articles in [[philosophy of religion]] and [[ethics]]. He even had three about [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]’s views, and one about his own take on philosophy. "Art and the 'Object of Art'" was originally in ''Mind'' in 1951, and takes apart the claim, made by prominent philosophers in the 1930s-1950s, that "the painting is not
