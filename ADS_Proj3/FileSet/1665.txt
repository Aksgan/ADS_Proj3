square in two ways—one for each homomorphism. Thus, one can find two numbers ''x'' and ''y'', with ''x''<sup>2</sup> − ''y''<sup>2</sup> divisible by ''n'' and again with probability at least one half we get a factor of ''n'' by finding the [[greatest common divisor]] of ''n'' and ''x'' − ''y''. == Improving polynomial choice == The choice of polynomial can dramatically affect the time to complete the remainder of the algorithm. The method of choosing polynomials based on the expansion of ''n'' in base ''m'' shown above is suboptimal in many practical situations, leading to the development of better methods. One such method was suggested by Murphy and Brent;<ref>B. Murphy and R. P. Brent. "On quadratic polynomials for the number field sieve". ''Australian Computer Science Communications'' '''20''' (1998), pp. 199–213. [http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/work/richard.brent/pub/pub178.html]</ref> they introduce a two-part score for polynomials, based on the presence of roots modulo small primes and on the average value that the polynomial takes over the sieving area.

In 2007, [[Jason Papadopoulos]] developed a faster implementation of final processing as part of msieve, which is public-domain. Both implementations feature the ability to be distributed among several nodes in a cluster with a sufficiently fast interconnect. Polynomial selection is normally performed by [[GPL]] software written by Kleinjung, or by msieve, and lattice sieving by GPL software written by Franke and Kleinjung; these are distributed in GGNFS. * [[NFS@Home]] * [http://www.math.ttu.edu/~cmonico/software/ggnfs/ GGNFS] * [http://pgnfs.org/ pGNFS] * [https://sourceforge.net/projects/factor-by-gnfs/ factor by gnfs] * [https://gforge.inria.fr/scm/?group_id=2065 CADO-NFS] * [http://sourceforge.net/projects/msieve/ msieve], which contains excellent final-processing code, a good implementation of the polynomial selection which is very good for smaller numbers, and an implementation of the line sieve. * [http://kmgnfs.cti.gr kmGNFS] == See also == * [[Special number field sieve]] == References == {{reflist}} {{refbegin}} * [[Arjen Lenstra|Arjen K.

It means the ''general case'' situation, as opposed to some more special or coincidental cases that are possible. Its precise meaning differs in different settings. For example, generically, two lines in the plane intersect in a single point (they are not parallel or coincident). One also says "two generic lines intersect in a point", which is formalized by the notion of a [[generic point]]. Similarly, three generic points in the plane are not [[Line (geometry)|colinear]] – if three points are collinear (even stronger, if two coincide), this is a degenerate case. This notion is important in mathematics and its applications, because [[degeneracy (mathematics)|degenerate]] cases may require an exceptional treatment; for example, when stating general [[theorem]]s or giving precise statements thereof, and when writing [[computer program]]s. ==General linear position== A set of at least <math>d+1</math> points in <math>d</math>-'''[[dimension]]al''' [[Euclidean space]] is said to be in '''general linear position''' (or just '''general position''') if no [[hyperplane]] contains more than <math>d</math> points &mdash; ''i.e.'' the points do not satisfy any more linear relations than they must. A set containing <math>k</math> points for <math>k<d+1</math> is in general linear position if and only if no <math>(k-2)</math>-[[dimension]]al [[Flat (geometry)|flat]] contains all <math>k</math> points. A set of points in general linear position is also said to be ''affinely independent'' (this is the affine analog of [[linear independence]] of vectors, or more precisely of maximal rank), and <math>d+1</math> points in general linear position in affine ''d''-space are an [[affine basis]]. See [[affine transformation]] for more. Similarly, ''n'' vectors in an ''n''-dimensional vector space are linearly independent if and only if the points they define in [[projective space]] (of dimension <math>n-1</math>) are in general linear position. If a set of points is not in general linear position, it is called a [[degenerate case]] or degenerate configuration &mdash; they satisfy a linear relation that need not always hold. A fundamental application is that, in the plane, [[five points determine a conic]], as long as the points are in general linear position (no three are collinear). == More generally == This definition can be generalized further: one may speak of points in general position with respect to a fixed class of algebraic relations (e.g. [[conic section]]s). In [[algebraic geometry]] this kind of condition is frequently encountered, in that points should impose ''independent'' conditions on curves passing through them. For example, [[five points determine a conic]], but in general six points do not lie on a conic, so being in general position with respect to conics requires that no six points lie on a conic. General position is preserved under [[biregular]] maps – if image points satisfy a relation, then under a biregular map this relation may be pulled back to the original points. Significantly, the [[Veronese map]] is biregular; as points under the Veronese map corresponds to evaluating a degree ''d'' polynomial at that point, this formalizes the notion that points in general
