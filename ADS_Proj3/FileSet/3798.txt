rewriting the Lisp machine IDE for use on a more cost-effective and less moribund architecture. During this time period, Gabriel married his second wife, and had a daughter; he later divorced his second wife in 1993. Eventually Lucid's focus shifted (during the [[AI Winter]]) to an IDE for [[C++]]. A core component of the IDE was [[Richard Stallman]]’s version of [[Emacs]], [[GNU Emacs]]. GNU Emacs was not up to Lucid’s needs, however, and several Lucid programmers were assigned to help develop GNU Emacs. Friction arose between the programmers and Stallman over how to handle [[Graphic User Interface|GUI]] issues, and Lucid forked; thus they were primarily responsible for the birth of what would come to be called [[XEmacs]]. One of his hires was another notable programmer, [[Jamie Zawinski|Jamie W. Zawinski]]. After Gabriel left Lucid, Inc. for good, he became a Vice President of Development for [[Parc Place Systems]] (1994–1995), and then a consultant, for, among others, Aspen Smallworks, before joining [[Sun Microsystems]]. As a Distinguished Engineer at Sun,<ref>Bio from "Innovation Happens Elsewhere" http://dreamsongs.com/IHE/IHE-5.html#45823</ref> Gabriel was an influential contributor to the evolution of the open source software strategy, culminating in publication of the book "Innovation Happens Elsewhere".<ref>Acknowledgements from "Innovation Happens Elsewhere" http://dreamsongs.com/IHE/IHE-9.html#86401</ref> In 2007, he joined IBM Research as a Distinguished Engineer. In 1998 he received his MFA in Poetry from Warren Wilson College. He has published poems in a number of literary journals. His [[chapbook]], ''Drive On'', was published by Hollyridge Press in 2005. Gabriel is the recipient of [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]'s 1998 Fellows Award [http://fellows.acm.org/fellow_citation.cfm?id=3666336&srt=all] and the 2004 [[Allen Newell]] Award. The citation reads: “For innovations not only on fundamental issues in programming languages and software design but also on the interaction between computer science and other disciplines, notably architecture and poetry.” He was the conference chair of the 2007 [[OOPSLA]]. ==References== {{Reflist}} * {{cite book | last = Gabriel | first = Richard P. | authorlink = Richard P.

In 1996, along with [[Robert Curl]], also a professor of chemistry at Rice, and [[Harold Kroto]], a professor at the [[University of Sussex]], he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for the discovery of a new form of carbon, [[buckminsterfullerene]] ("buckyballs"). ==Early life== Smalley, the youngest of 4 siblings, was born in [[Akron, Ohio]], and grew up in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. Smalley attended [[Hope College]] before transferring to the [[University of Michigan]] where he received his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in 1965. Between his studies, he worked in industry, where he developed his unique managerial style. He received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from [[Princeton University]] in 1973. He completed postdoctoral work at the [[University of Chicago]], with [[Lennard Wharton]] and [[Donald Levy]], where he was a pioneer in the development of [[supersonic]] beam [[laser spectroscopy]]. ==Fullerenes and nanotechnology== Smalley's research in physical chemistry investigated formation of inorganic and semiconductor clusters using pulsed molecular beams and time of flight [[mass spectrometry]]. As a consequence of this expertise, Robert Curl introduced him to Harry Kroto in order to investigate a question about the constituents of astronomical dust. These are carbon rich grains expelled by old stars such as R Corona Borealis. The result of this collaboration
