SearchCRM.com, 19 January 2006.</ref> on development on the server and agent desktop side, but this is not mandatory and non-SOA development can be done and is normally the case. ==CCF Components== ===Agent Desktop=== The primary user interface for CCF is the agent desktop. This is a desktop-based [[user interface]] (UI) that presents data aggregated from various [[Line of business]] (LOB) & [[Operations support system|OSS]]/[[Business support system|BSS]] application front ends and presents them in a unified view. CCF does not include an Agent Desktop application, rather samples including source code are provided as part of the framework. ===Application Integration Framework (AIF)=== The AIF manages the loading of the applications, integration and event brokering. Through the use of adapters (see HAT below) applications can have custom integrations to account for both the technology of the hosted application as well as business processing. ===Hosted Application Toolkit (HAT)=== HAT allows for the separation of the business rules and the method used to integrate with the application. HAT uses Microsoft Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) to manage the business rules, Data Driven Adapters (DDAs) to manage the application directly, and Bindings written in XML to connect the two. CCF 2009 SP1 ships with 3 DDAs: Win32, Web, and Java (JDK 1.6). DDAs can be customized or extended for additional application types as needed. ==Releases== *Customer Care Framework 1.0: released early 2003 *Customer Care Framework 1.1: released 2004; uses [[.NET Framework 1.1]] *Customer Care Framework 1.2: released 2004; uses [[.NET Framework 1.1]] *Customer Care Framework 2.0: released 2005; uses [[.NET Framework 1.1]] *Customer Care Framework 2005 (version 2.5.0): released Jan 2006, uses [[.NET Framework 1.1]] *Customer Care Framework 2005 (QFE 1, version 2.5.1): released April 2006, uses [[.NET Framework 1.1]] *Customer Care Framework 2005 (QFE 2, version 2.5.2): released 2006, uses [[.NET Framework 1.1]] *Customer Care Framework 2005 (QFE 3, version 2.5.3): released August 2006, uses [[.NET Framework 1.1]] *Customer Care Framework 2005 for .NET Framework 2.0 (version 2.6): built on a modified 2.5.3 base; requires [[.NET Framework 2.0]].

One is [[Jacada WorkSpace]], which is a [[Java EE]]-based solution which is used to wrap applications and present a web UI to clients. [[OpenSpan]] produces a product using .Net that can integrate with CCF or operate standalone to integrate applications. OpenSpan also provides an IDE tool to create the integrations.<ref>[http://www.crm2day.com/content/t6_librarynews_1.php?news_id=123950]</ref> [[Cicero Software]] likewise produces an application integration product with an IDE. [[Corizon]] provides a platform for Enterprise Mashups that allows Composite applications to be created easily. Microsoft has a free product called [[Composite UI Application Block]] (CAB) which can be used to build composite applications. CAB is used within CCF. CAB does not provide telephone or call center specific integrations, but has tight integration with [[Microsoft Visual Studio|Visual Studio]] and many samples including one for call centers. CAB on its own doesn't offer session management and multi-channel capability although the sample code does have some session features. ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.microsoft.com/CCF Microsoft's CCF Website] * [http://www.microsoft.com/serviceproviders/ccf/ccf-resources.mspx Microsoft Centric WP's and stuff.] * [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa306213.aspx Customer Care Framework On MSDN] * [http://www.crm2day.com/news/crm/114212.php Microsoft delivers Customer Care Framework] * [http://www.crm-daily.com/story.xhtml?story_id=12300A89B140 Microsoft's Call Center app] * [http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/customercareframework/threads Microsoft's CCF discussion board] {{Microsoft APIs}} [[Category:Information technology management]] [[Category:Service-oriented architecture related products]] [[Category:Microsoft software factories]] [[it:Customer care framework]]</text> </page> <page> <id>24443</id> <title>Microsoft Direct3D</title> <text>{{cleanup|date=November 2010}} '''Direct3D''' is part of [[Microsoft]]'s [[DirectX]] [[application programming interface|API]]. Direct3D is only available for Microsoft's various [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[operating systems]] ([[Windows 95]] and above) and in the open source software [[Wine (software)|Wine]]. It is the base for the graphics API on the [[Xbox]] and [[Xbox 360]] console systems. Direct3D is used to render [[3D computer graphics|three dimensional graphics]] in applications where performance is important, such as games. Direct3D also allows applications to run fullscreen instead of embedded in a window, though they can still run in a window if programmed for that feature. Direct3D uses [[hardware acceleration]] if it is available on the [[graphics card]], allowing for hardware acceleration of the entire 3D rendering pipeline or even only partial acceleration. Direct3D exposes the advanced graphics capabilities of 3D graphics hardware, including [[z-buffering]], [[anti-aliasing]], [[Alpha compositing|alpha blending]], [[mipmap]]ping, atmospheric effects, and perspective-correct [[texture mapping]]. Integration with other DirectX technologies enables Direct3D to deliver such features as video mapping, hardware 3D rendering in 2D [[Video overlay|overlay]] planes, and even [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], providing the use of 2D and 3D graphics in interactive media titles. Direct3D is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] API. That is, it contains many commands for 3D rendering; however, since version 8, Direct3D has superseded the old [[DirectDraw]] framework and also taken responsibility for the rendering of [[2D computer graphics|2D graphics]].<ref>[http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx/sdk/readmepage/default.aspx Microsoft DirectX SDK Readme (October 2006)]</ref> Microsoft strives to continually update Direct3D to support the latest technology available on 3D graphics cards. Direct3D offers full vertex software emulation but no pixel software emulation for features not available in hardware. For example, if software programmed using Direct3D requires [[Shader#Pixel shaders|pixel shaders]] and the [[video card]] on the user's computer does not support that feature, Direct3D will not [[emulate]] it, although it will compute and render the polygons and textures of the 3D models, albeit at a
