TextMate 1.0 came out on 5 October 2004, after 5 months of development, followed by version 1.0.1 on 21 October 2004.<ref>David Hansson. “[http://macromates.com/blog/archives/2004/10/05/hello-world/ TextMate 1.0 is finally here!]”, ''TextMate Blog'', 5 October 2004.</ref><ref>Allan Odgaard. “[http://macromates.com/wiki/Profiles/AllanOdgaard Profiles/Allan Odgaard]” on the TextMate wiki, 20 November 2005.</ref><ref>David Hansson. “[http://macromates.com/blog/archives/2004/10/21/textmate-101-emerges-after-nine-betas/ TextMate 1.0.1 emerges after nine betas]”, ''TextMate Blog'', 21 October 2005.</ref> The release focused on implementing a small feature set well, and did not have a preference window or a toolbar, didn’t integrate [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]], and had no options for printing.<ref>Matt Willmore. “[http://maczealots.com/reviews/textmate/ TextMate 1.0.1 Review: A Checkmate for TextMate?]”, ''Maczealots.com'', 8 October 2004.</ref><ref>Michael “drunkenbatman” Bell. “[http://www.drunkenblog.com/drunkenblog-archives/000347.html TextMate: The Missing Editor for OS X]”, ''Drunkenblog'', 4 November 2004.</ref> At the beginning only a small number of programming languages were supported, as only a few “language bundles” had been created. Despite all that, some developers found this early and incomplete version of TextMate a welcome change to a market that was considered stagnated by the decade-long dominance of [[BBEdit]].<ref>Kimbro Staken. “[http://www.xmldatabases.org/WK/blog/2129_A_cool_new_text_editor_-_TextMate_-_Mac_OS_X.item A cool new text editor - TextMate - Mac OS X]”, ''Inspirational Technology'', 6 October 2004.</ref> TextMate 1.0.2 came out on 10 December 2004. In the series of TextMate 1.1 [[development stage#Beta|betas]], TextMate gained features: a preferences window with a GUI for creating and editing themes; a status bar with a symbol list; menus for choosing language and tab settings, and a “bundle editor” for editing language-specific customizations. On 6 January 2006, Odgaard released TextMate 1.5, the first “stable release” since 1.0.2.<ref> Allan Odgaard. “[http://macromates.com/blog/archives/2006/01/06/textmate-15/ TextMate 1.5]”, ''TextMate Blog'', 6 January 2006.</ref> Reviews were positive, and many reviewers who had previously criticised the program now endorsed it.<ref>Rui Carmo. “[http://the.taoofmac.com/space/blog/2006-01-08 Third Time’s The Charm]”, ''Tao of Mac'', 8 January 2006.</ref><!-- need some more references --> TextMate continued to develop through mid-2006. On 8 August 2006, TextMate was awarded the Apple Design Award for Best Developer Tool, at Apple’s [[Worldwide Developers Conference]] in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], to “raucous applause.”<ref>John Gruber. “[http://daringfireball.net/linked/2006/august#tue-08-textmate ADA: TextMate 1.5.2]”, ''Daring Fireball Linked List'', 8 August 2006.</ref> In February 2006, the TextMate blog expressed intentions for future directions, including improved project management, with a plug-in system to support remote file systems such as FTP, and [[revision control]] systems such as [[Subversion (software)|Subversion]].<ref>Allan Odgaard. “[http://macromates.com/blog/archives/2006/02/15/future-directions/ Future Directions]”, ''TextMate Blog'', 15 February 2006.</ref> Those changes, however, have been slow to materialize. Throughout 2007, the core application changed only minimally, though its “language bundles” continued to advance. In June 2009, TextMate 2 was announced to be in development and about 90 percent complete, but which features it will include wasn't disclosed.<ref>TextMate Blog: [http://blog.macromates.com/2009/working-on-it/ Working on It], 14 June 2009</ref> As of January, 2011 it has yet to be released. ==Features== === Nested scopes === TextMate allows users to create their own arbitrarily complex [[syntax highlighting]] modes by using a modified version of the Apple ASCII [[property list]] format to define language grammars. These grammars allow nesting rules to be defined using the [[Oniguruma]] [[regular expression]] library, and then assigned specific “scopes”: compound labels which identify them for coloration. Therefore, each point of a document is assigned one or more scopes, which define where in the document the point is, how it should be colored, and what the behavior of TextMate should be at that point. For instance, the title of one of the links in the “External links” section has the scope: <pre> text.html.mediawiki markup.list.mediawiki meta.link.inline.external.mediawiki string.other.link.title.external.mediawiki </pre> This scope tells us that we are looking at a link title within a link within a list within a MediaWiki document. TextMate themes can mark up any scope, at varying levels of precision. For instance, one theme may decide to color every constant (<code>constant.*</code>) identically, while another may decide that numerical constants (<code>constant.numeric.*</code>) should be colored differently than escaped characters (<code>constant.character.escape.*</code>). The nested scope syntax allows language authors and theme authors various levels of coverage, so that each one can choose to opt for simplicity or comprehensiveness, as desired. ===Snippets=== At their simplest, TextMate “[[snippet (programming)|snippets]]” are pieces of text which can be inserted into the document at the current location. More complicated behaviors are possible, based on a few useful generalizations of this idea. First, snippets can include one or more “tab stops”, which can be cycled through using the “tab” key. Second, the results of these tab stops can be dynamically changed in another portion of the snippet, as the user fills in the stop. Third, the snippets have access to TextMate environment variables such as current scope, current line number, or author name,
