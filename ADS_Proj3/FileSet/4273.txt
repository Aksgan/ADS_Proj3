by the user in case the phone is bought up. The handsets are often SIM-locked to ensure that the user does not use another operator, allowing the original operator to eventually recoup its subsidy. However, because the units can be unlocked for a small fee (and even the operators themselves offer this service), units can be bought cheaply, separated from the original SIM card and sold on for a profit, perhaps in other markets, perhaps as contract phone. This is known in the industry as ''box breaking'', and often harms the profits of the operator while allowing complicit sales staff and [[box breaker]]s to reap the rewards. Note that, if a prepaid handset breaks, the SIM card (representing the prepaid account value, plus user's address book, history, etc) can typically be moved to another prepaid handset if the phone-network is the same. That is, the account is tied to the portable SIM card, not the handset, on prepaid phones. This is useful because by 2010, prepaid handsets cost less than the value a user might have stored in an account. Mostly, GSM and 3G mobile handsets can easily be SIM-unlocked and used on any suitable network with any SIM card. A notable exception is the Apple [[Iphone|iPhone]], where in most markets Apple has gone to extreme lengths to lock-down their phones; thus they can only be used with the partner's network. This has led to a popular hack called the ''[[Jailbreak (iPhone)|jailbreak]]'', which allows custom software unapproved by Apple to run on the phone. Then software can be run to unlock the phone, which frees the iPhone from the partner network; thus any SIM card can be inserted. (Note that jailbreaking, in itself, does not unlock the phone, and has other uses as well.) Apple and the hackers are locked in a war of escalation - described by Apple CEO [[Steve Jobs]] as "a game of cat and mouse"<ref>http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9037398/Jobs_says_Apple_will_fight_iPhone_unlocking_hacks?intsrc=hm_list</ref> - with Apple constantly trying to close loopholes in their operating system, and the hackers finding new ways to jailbreak each version when it becomes avai<sup></sup>lable. In countries where the phones are not subsidised e.g. Italy and Belgium, all phones are unlocked. Where the phone is not locked to its SIM card, the users can easily switch networks by simply replacing the SIM card of one network with that of another while using only one phone. This is typical, for example, among users who may want to optimise their telecoms traffic by different tariffs to different friends on different networks. [[Dual SIM]] phones are now made by some mobile phone manufacturers, which save the user from carrying around a separate phone for every number. There are two types, the first, that allow one to switch between the SIMs, and the second, that allow both SIMs to be active simultaneously. == Operating systems == {{Expand section|date=December 2010}} SIM operating systems come in two main types: native and Java Card. Native SIMs are based on proprietary, vendor specific software whereas the Java Card SIMs are based on standards, particularly [[Java Card]] which is a subset of the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]] specifically targeted at embedded devices.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Java Card allows the SIM to contain programs that are hardware independent and interoperable. == Data == SIM cards store network-specific information used to authenticate and identify subscribers on the network. The most important of these are the [[#Integrated Circuit Card ID (ICC-ID)|ICC-ID]], [[IMSI]], Authentication Key (Ki), Local Area Identity (LAI) and Operator-Specific Emergency Number. The SIM also stores other carrier specific data such as the SMSC (Short Message Service Center) number, Service Provider Name (SPN), Service Dialing Numbers (SDN), Advice-Of-Charge parameters and Value Added Service (VAS) applications. (look to GSM 11.11) === Integrated circuit card identifier (ICC-ID) === Each SIM is internationally identified by its ICC-ID. ICC-IDs are stored in the SIM cards and are also engraved or printed on the SIM card body during a process called personalization. The ICC-ID is defined by the ITU-T recommendation E.118.<ref> ITU-T, ITU-T Recommendation E.118, The international telecommunication charge card, [http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.118 Revision history], [http://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&id=T-REC-E.118-200605-I!!PDF-E&type=items Revision "05/2006"] </ref> Its layout is based on [[ISO/IEC 7812]]. According to E.118 the number is up to 19 digits long including a single check digit calculated using the [[Luhn algorithm]]. However, the GSM Phase 1<ref> ETSI, ETSI Recommendation GSM 11.11, Specifications of the SIM-ME Interface, [http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/11_series/11.11/1111-3G0.ZIP Version 3.16.0] </ref> defined the ICC-ID length as 10 octets with operator-specific structure. The number is composed of the following subparts: ==== Issuer identification number (IIN) ==== Maximum of seven digits: * Major industry identifier (MII), 2 fixed digits, ''89'' for telecommunication purposes. * [[List of country calling codes|Country code]], 1-3 digits, as defined by [[ITU-T]] recommendation [[E.164]]. * Issuer identifier, 1-4 digits. ==== Individual account identification ==== * Individual account identification number. Its length is variable but every number under one IIN will have the same length. ==== Check digit ==== * Single digit calculated from the other digits using the [[Luhn algorithm]]. ==== Total size ==== With the GSM Phase 1 specification using 10 octets into which ICC-ID is stored as packed BCD, the data field has room for 20 digits. In practice this means that on GSM SIM cards there are 20 digit (19+1) and 19 digit (18+1) ICC-IDs in use, depending upon issuer. However one issuer uses always same size of ICC-IDs. To confuse matters more, SIM factories seem to have varying ways of delivering electronic copy of SIM personalization datasets. Some datasets are without the ICC-ID checksum digit, others are with the digit. === International mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) === SIM cards are identified on their individual operator networks by a unique [[IMSI]]. [[Mobile operators]] connect mobile phone calls and communicate with their market SIM cards using their IMSIs. The format is: * The first 3 digits represent the [[Mobile country code|Mobile Country Code (MCC)]]. * The next 2 or 3 digits represent the [[Mobile network code|Mobile Network Code (MNC)]]. 3 digit MNC codes are allowed by E.212 but are
