its objects. Imagine was a derivative of the software [[TurboSilver]], which was also for the Amiga and written by Impulse. The Windows version of the program was abandoned when Impulse dropped out of the 3D software market; but the Amiga version is now maintained and sold by [http://www.imaginefa.com CAD Technologies]. Since then the Windows and DOS versions has been made available in full along with other freely distributed addons and softwares like [[Organica]] at the fansite [http://www.imagine3d.org Imagine 3D] which also has a forum, gallery and downloads section. == External links == * [http://www.pygott.demon.co.uk/prog.htm Program for reading IOB files] * [http://aminet.net/pix/imagi Aminet Imagine traces] * [http://www.imagine3d.org Imagine 3D fan site] {{graphics-software-stub}} [[Category:3D graphics software]] [[Category:Amiga raytracers]] [[pl:Imagine 3D]]</text> </page> <page> <id>17970</id> <title>Imaging for Windows</title> <text>{{Infobox Windows component | name = Imaging for Windows | logo = | screenshot = | included_with = | replaces = | replaced_by = [[Windows Picture and Fax Viewer]] | related_components = | support_status = Discontinued }} '''Imaging for Windows''' from ''Global 360'' is [[document imaging]] software. Earlier versions of Imaging for Windows were included in Windows 95/98/Me/NT/2000. Global360 Imaging for Windows is the upgrade to this Imaging software, which was discontinued as of [[Windows XP]].<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308979]</ref> Its image viewing, editing and scanning functions are superseded by [[Windows Picture and Fax Viewer]] and [[Microsoft Paint]], both of which are based on [[GDI+]] in Windows XP. Unfortunately, the multi-page picture editing functions are gone with the Imaging software. Imaging for Windows was developed by [[Wang Laboratories|Wang]] (as in Windows 95/NT 4.0), was later absorbed by [[Kodak]] (as ''Eastman Software'', as in Windows 98/2000), then becoming ''eiStream Inc.'', and is now owned by Global 360. Version 4.0 was released in November 2008.<ref>[http://www.global360.com/products/imaging/]</ref> Imaging for Windows supports creating, annotating, viewing, and printing [[TIFF]], [[BMP file format|BMP]], and [[Microsoft Fax]] ''AWD'' image documents. Users can also view and print [[JPEG]] and [[PCX]]/[[DCX (file format)|DCX]] images. Imaging for Windows also provides the ability to develop software using [[ActiveX]] tools. Each copy includes the Kodak/Wang Imaging OCX (ActiveX) controls - ImgEdit, ImgAdmin, ImgThumb, ImgScan and ImgOCR controls are provided. ==References== <references/> {{DEFAULTSORT:Imaging For Windows}} [[Category:Information technology management]] [[Category:Image viewers]] [[Category:Discontinued Windows components]] [[it:Imaging per Windows]]</text> </page> <page> <id>17973</id> <title>Imaging spectrometer</title> <text>An '''imaging spectrometer''' is an instrument used in the field of [[imaging spectroscopy]] to acquire a spectrally-resolved image of an object or scene, often referred to as a [[datacube]] due to the three-dimensional representation of the data. Namely, two axes of the image corresponds to distance and the third to [[wavelength]]. The principle of operation is the same as that of the simple [[spectrometer]], but special care is taken to avoid [[optical aberration]]s for better image quality. Example imaging spectrometer types include: filtered camera, whiskbroom scanner, pushbroom scanner, integral field spectrograph (or related dimensional reformatting techniques), wedge imaging spectrometer, Fourier transform imaging spectrometer, [[computed tomography imaging spectrometer]] (CTIS), image replicating imaging spectrometer (IRIS), coded aperture snapshot spectral imager (CASSI), and image mapping spectrometer (IMS). * List of imaging spectrometer instruments: http://www.geo.unizh.ch/~schaep/research/apex/is_list.html * Home page of the AVIRIS imaging spectrometer: http://aviris.jpl.nasa.gov/ * Home page of the [[Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer|MODIS]] imaging spectrometer: http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/ * Computed tomographic imaging spectrometer (CTIS) research lab: http://www.optics.arizona.edu/detlab/ * Coded aperture snapshot spectral imager (CASSI) research lab: http://www.disp.duke.edu/projects/CASSI/index.ptml * Example of a commercial [[Fourier transform]] imaging spectrometer: http://www.hyper-cam.com/ * Home page of the near-infrared integral field imaging spectrograph at the [[Gemini Observatory|Gemini observatory]]: http://www.gemini.edu/sciops/instruments/nifs/NIFSIndex.html * Image mapping spectrometer (IMS) research lab: http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~tt3/index.html == See also == * [[Spectral imaging]] [[Category:Imaging]] [[Category:Spectrometers]] {{optics-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>17975</id> <title>Imc FAMOS</title> <text>{{orphan|date=January 2010}} {{DISPLAYTITLE:imc FAMOS}} {{Infobox Software| |name= imc FAMOS |Screenshot= |caption= |developer= imc Meßsysteme GmbH (integrated measurement & control), Berlin |latest_release_version= 6.0 |operating_system= [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] |genre= [[data acquisition]] |license= [[Proprietary software|Proprietary]] |language= German, English |website= [http://www.imcfamos.com imcfamos.com] }} '''FAMOS''' is a graphical data analysis program for evaluating and visually displaying measurement results. The program, whose name is an acronym for '''''F'''ast '''A'''nalysis And '''M'''onitoring '''O'''f '''S'''ignals'', was introduced in 1987 by the German company imc Meßsysteme GmbH (integrated measurement & control) in Berlin for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] 2.11. According to its manufacturer, FAMOS offers high speed display and processing of data sets of any size. == Import of a wide variety of data formats == FAMOS can import data from different file formats, e.g. [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]]-, [[Binary file|Binary]]-, [[ASCII]]- or [[Matlab]]-files. With a file assistant it is also possible to create different import filters. It is possible to present the data in different grafical ways. The information can be combined, labeled and processed. FAMOS is able to store data in a proprietary as well as in [[ASCII]] or [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] [[File format| format]]. == Data analysis == Imported data can be processed with a variety of mathematical operations, either manually or in automated procedures. FAMOS offers expansion modules for special operations such as electronic filters, for spectral analysis and for synchronized display of data and video sequences and for the [[Association for Standardisation of Automation and Measuring Systems|ASAM-ODS data model]]. It is also possible to play data back audibly with the PC sound card. == Documentation == By means of its "Report Generator", FAMOS enables creation of documentations / lab reports consisting of a variety of dialog elements and plots as well as graphics with controls which can be automatically hidden when printing. The reports generated can be subject to post-processing using various input data, and there are templates for partially or fully automated composition of reports. == literature (German language) == * 20 Jahre imc und ADDITIVE, sensor report 4/2008 * FAMOS 6.0 - Mehr als nur Signalanalyse, Physik Journal 6/2008 * Neue Software-Version für die Analyse von Messsignalen, ATZ 4/2008 * Signalanalyse für den Messtechniker, TECHNICA 23-24/2005 * Signalanalysesoftware mit neuen Funktionen, Maschinenmarkt 17/2008 * Wie ein Taschenrechner, MSR Magazin 11/2002 * FAMOS - Taschenrechner für die Meßtechnik, Addison-Wesley, 1997, ISBN 3-8273-1255-8 == External links == *[http://www.imcfamos.com - FAMOS website] {{DEFAULTSORT:Imc Famos}} [[Category:Science software]] [[Category:Physics software]] [[Category:Windows software]] [[Category:Data analysis software]] [[de:imc FAMOS]]</text> </page> <page> <id>17981</id> <title>Immaterialism</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}} {{Redirect|Immaterial|the song by Haircut
