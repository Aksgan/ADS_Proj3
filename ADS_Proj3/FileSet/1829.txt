The Grid Analysis and Display System (GrADS) is a software used in atmospheric sciences and climatology to display meteorological fields such as pressure, temperature, or wind speeds. It allows to read gridded meteorological data in different formats such as [[netCDF]] or [[GRIB]] and plot time series of displays from several identical datasets with differing times. It uses ''ctl'' mechanism to join differing time group datasets. ==See also== *[[Climate Data Analysis Tool]] ==External links== * http://grads.iges.org/grads/head.html [[Category:Free plotting software]] [[Category:Earth sciences graphics software]]</text> </page> <page> <id>15843</id> <title>Grid file</title> <text>In [[computer science]], a '''grid file''' or '''bucket grid''' is a [[point access method]] which splits a space into a non-periodic [[wikt:grid|grid]] where one or more cells of the grid refer to a small set of points. Grid files (a [[symmetric]] [[data structure]]) provide an efficient method of storing these indexes on disk to perform complex data lookups. It provides a grid of ''n''-dimensions where ''n'' represents how many keys can be used to reference a single point. Grid files do not contain any data themselves but instead contain references to the correct [[bucket (computing)|bucket]]. ==Uses== A '''grid file''' is usually used in cases where a single value can be referenced by multiple keys. A grid file began being used because "traditional file structures that provide multikey access to records, for example, inverted files, are extensions of file structures originally designed for single-key access. They manifest various deficiencies in particular for multikey access to highly dynamic files." <ref name="tgf">J. Neivergelt, H. Hinterberger ''The Grid File: An Adaptable, Symmetric Multikey File Structure''. Institut fur Informatik, ETH and K. C. Sevcik, 1984. Abstract, pp.1.</ref> In a traditional single dimensional data structure (e.g. [[Associative array|hash]]), a search on a single criterion is usually very simple but searching for a second criterion can be much more complex. Grid files represent a special kind of hashing, where the traditional hash is replaced by a grid directory. ==Examples== ===Consensus Database<ref>[[Donald Knuth]].

Section 6.4.3: Grid Files, pp.185.</ref>=== Consider a database containing data from a census. A single [[record (database)|record]] represents a single household, and all records are grouped into buckets. All records in a bucket can be indexed by either their city (which is the same for all records in the bucket), and the streets in that city whose names begin with the same letter. A grid file can be used to provide an efficient index for this structure, where records come in groupings of 26, each of them relating to street names in a city starting with one of the letters of the alphabet. This structure can be thought of as an [[array data structure|array]], [[table (database)|table]], or [[grid (spatial index)|grid]] with two dimensions which we will call the x and y axes. One may consider the x-axis to be the city and the y-axis to be each of the letters in the alphabet, or alternatively, the first letter of each street. Each record in this structure is known as a cell. Each cell will contain a [[Pointer (computing)|pointer]] to the appropriate bucket in the database where the actual data is stored. An extra cell, or record header, may be required to store the name of the city. Other cells grouped with it will only need to contain the pointer to their respective bucket, since the first cell corresponds to street names beginning with "A", the second to "B", and so on. The database can be further extended to contain a continent field
