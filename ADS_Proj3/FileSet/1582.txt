whether or not the reaction is allowed, and (2) which mechanism the reaction proceeds though. In the case of a [1,5] shift on pentadiene, the HOMO of the sigma bond (i.e. a constructive bond) and the LUMO of butadiene on the remaining 4 carbons is observed. Assuming the reaction happens suprafacially, the shift results with the HOMO of butadiene on the 4 carbons that are not involved in the sigma bond of the product. Since the pi system changed from the LUMO to the HOMO, this reaction is allowed (though it would not be allowed if the pi system went from LUMO to LUMO). To explain why the reaction happens suprafacially, first notice that the terminal orbitals are in the same phase. For there to be a constructive sigma bond formed after the shift, the reaction would have to be suprafacial. If the species shifted antarafacially then it would form an [[antibonding]] orbital and there would not be a constructive sigma shift. It is worth noting that in propene the shift would have to be antarafacial, but since the molecule is very small that twist is not possible and the reaction is not allowed. [[File:Pentadiene.jpg]] === Electrocyclic Reactions === An [[electrocyclic reaction]] is a percyclic reaction involving the net loss of a pi bond and creation of a sigma bond with formation of a ring. This reaction proceeds through either a [[conrotatory]] or [[disrotatory]] mechanism. In the conrotatory ring opening of cyclobutene, there are 2 electrons moving suprafacially (on the pi bond) and 2 moving antarafacially (on the sigma bond). This means there is one 4q+2 suprafacial system and no 4r antarafacial system; thus the conrotatory process is thermally allowed by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules. The HOMO of the sigma bond (i.e. a constructive bond) and the LUMO of the pi bond are important in the FMO theory consideration. If the ring opening uses a conrotatory process then the reaction results with the HOMO of butadiene. As in the previous examples the pi system moves from a LUMO species to a HOMO species, meaning this reaction is allowed.<ref name=fleming/> [[File:Cyclobutene ring opening.jpg]] == References == {{Reflist}} [[Category:Quantum chemistry]] [[pl:Teoria orbitali granicznych]] [[vi:Thuyết FMO]]</text> </page> <page> <id>14324</id> <title>Fujitsu iPAD</title> <text>[[File:Fujistu iPAD.jpg|right|thumb|The Fujitsu iPAD]] The '''Fujitsu iPAD''' is a lightweight [[Handheld computing|handheld device]] that was introduced by [[Fujitsu]], in 2002.

Historically, the earliest digital SLR models, such as the [[Kodak DCS 100]], also used a smaller sensor. ==Use of 35 mm film-camera lenses== If the lens mounts are compatible, many lenses, including manual-focus models, designed for 35 mm cameras can be mounted on the latest DSLR cameras. When a lens designed for a full-frame camera, whether film or digital, is mounted on a DSLR with a smaller sensor size, only the center of the lens’s [[image circle]] is captured. The edges are cropped off, which is equivalent to zooming in on the center section of the imaging area. The ratio of the size of the full-frame 35 mm format to the size of the smaller format is known as the “[[crop factor]]” or “focal-length multiplier″, and is typically in the range 1.3–2.0 for non-full-frame digital SLRs. ==Advantages and disadvantages of full-frame digital SLRs== [[Image:Dslr sensor comparison.jpg|thumb|300px|An APS-C format SLR (left) and a full-frame DSLR (right) show the difference in the size of the sensors.]] Full-frame DSLR cameras offer a number of advantages over their smaller-sensor counterparts. One advantage is that wide-angle lenses designed for full-frame 35 mm retain that same wide [[angle of view]]. On smaller-sensor DSLRs, wide-angle lenses have smaller angles of view equivalent to those of longer-focal-length lenses on 35 mm film cameras. For example, a 24 mm lens on a camera with a [[crop factor]] of 1.5 has a 62° diagonal angle of view, the same as that of a 36 mm lens on a 35 mm film camera. On a full-frame digital camera, the 24 mm lens has the same 84° angle of view as it would on a 35 mm film camera. If the same lens is used on both full-frame and cropped
