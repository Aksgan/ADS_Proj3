many suppliers. The so called human agent represents a user interacting with the system. The diagram contains the storages ''Orders'', ''Purchase Order'' and ''Product Catalog''. Storages are represented by curved shapes. Agents can read from storages, write to storages or modify the content of storages. The directions of the arrows indicate which operation is performed by an agent. In the diagram, the ''Supplier Manager'' can modify the content of the ''Product Catalog'', whereas the ''Order Processor'' can only read the content of the ''Product Catalog''. Agents communicate via channels. The direction of information flow is either indicated by arrows (not shown in the picture), by a request-response-symbol (e.g. between ''Supplier Manager'' and ''Supplier'') or omitted (e.g. between ''Order Processor'' and ''Supplier Manager''). === Dynamic Structure Diagram === Dynamic structures are derived from [[petri net]]s. :"They are used to express system behavior over time, depicting the actions performed by the agents. So they clarify how a system is working and how communication takes place between different agents." <ref name="fmc-modeling.org">[http://www.fmc-modeling.org/notation_reference/ fmc-modeling.org Notations Reference]</ref> === Value Range Structure Diagram === Value range structure diagrams (also known as FMC Entity Relationship Diagrams) can be compared with the [[Entity-relationship model]]. :"[They] are used to depict value range structures or topics as mathematical structures. Value range structures describe observable values at locations within the system whereas topic diagrams allow a much wider usage in order to cover all correlations between interesting points." <ref name="fmc-modeling.org"/> == References == <references/> *{{cite book | first= Andreas | last = Knoepfel | coauthors = Bernhard Groene, Peter Tabeling | year = 2005 | url = http://fmc-modeling.org/fmcbook/ | title = Fundamental Modeling Concepts - Effective Communication of IT Systems | publisher = Wiley | id = 0-470-02710-X }} == External links == * [http://www.fmc-modeling.org/ FMC Homepage] * [http://www.fmc-modeling.org/fmc_stencils/ FMC-Stencils for MS-Visio] * [http://www.fmc-modeling.org/intervista FMC-Coaching & Training] {{DEFAULTSORT:Fundamental Modeling Concepts}} [[Category:Data modeling]] [[Category:Data modeling languages]] [[Category:Specification languages]] [[de:Fundamental Modeling Concepts]]</text> </page> <page> <id>14406</id> <title>Fundamental theorem of algebra</title> <text>In [[mathematics]], the '''[[fundamental theorem]] of algebra''' states that every non-constant single-variable [[polynomial]] with [[complex number|complex]] [[coefficient]]s has at least one complex [[root of a function|root]]. Equivalently, the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[complex number]]s is [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]]. Sometimes, this theorem is stated as: every non-zero single-variable polynomial with complex coefficients has exactly as many complex roots as its degree, if each root is counted up to its [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]]. Although this at first appears to be a stronger statement, it is a direct consequence of the other form of the theorem, through the use of successive [[polynomial division]] by linear factors. In spite of its name, there is no purely algebraic proof of the theorem, since any proof must use the [[completeness (order theory)|completeness]] of the reals (or some other equivalent formulation of completeness), which is not an algebraic concept. Additionally, it is not fundamental for modern [[algebra]]; its name was given at a time in which algebra was mainly about solving polynomial equations with real or complex coefficients. ==History== Peter Rothe (Petrus Roth), in his book ''Arithmetica Philosophica'' (published in 1608), wrote that a polynomial equation of degree ''n'' (with real coefficients) ''may'' have ''n'' solutions. [[Albert Girard]], in his book ''L'invention nouvelle en l'Algèbre'' (published in 1629), asserted that a polynomial equation of degree ''n'' has ''n'' solutions, but he did not state that they had to be real numbers. Furthermore, he added that his assertion holds “unless the equation is incomplete”, by which he meant that no coefficient is equal to 0. However, when he explains in detail what he means, it is clear that he actually believes that his assertion is always true; for instance, he shows that the equation ''x''<sup>4</sup> = 4x − 3, although incomplete, has four solutions (counting multiplicities): 1 (twice), −1 + ''i''√<span style="text-decoration: overline">2</span>, and −1 − ''i''√<span style="text-decoration: overline">2</span>. As will be mentioned again below, it follows from the fundamental theorem of algebra that every non-constant polynomial with real coefficients can be written as a product of polynomials with real coefficients whose degree is either 1 or 2. However, in 1702 [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] said that no polynomial of the type ''x''<sup>4</sup> + ''a''<sup>4</sup> (with ''a'' real and distinct from 0) can be written in such a way. Later, [[Nicolaus I Bernoulli|Nikolaus Bernoulli]] made the same assertion concerning the polynomial ''x''<sup>4</sup> − 4''x''<sup>3</sup> + 2''x''<sup>2</sup> + 4''x'' + 4, but he got a letter from [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] in 1742<ref>See section ''Le rôle d'Euler'' in C. Gilain's article ''Sur l'histoire du théorème fondamental de l'algèbre: théorie des équations et calcul intégral''.</ref> in which he was told that his polynomial happened to be equal to :<math>(x^2-(2+\alpha)x+1+\sqrt{7}+\alpha)(x^2-(2-\alpha)x+1+\sqrt{7}-\alpha),</math> where α is the square root of 4 + 2√<span style="text-decoration: overline">7</span>. Also, Euler mentioned that :<math>x^4+a^4=(x^2+a\sqrt{2}\cdot x+a^2)(x^2-a\sqrt{2}\cdot x+a^2).\,</math> A first attempt at proving the theorem was made by [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] in 1746, but his proof was incomplete. Among other problems, it assumed implicitly a theorem (now known as [[Puiseux's theorem]]) which would not be proved until more than a century later, and furthermore the proof assumed the fundamental theorem of algebra. Other attempts were made by [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] (1749), de Foncenex (1759), [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] (1772), and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]] (1795). These last four attempts assumed implicitly Girard's assertion; to be more precise, the existence of solutions was assumed and all that remained to be proved was that their form was ''a'' + ''bi'' for some real numbers ''a'' and ''b''. In modern terms, Euler, de Foncenex, Lagrange, and Laplace were assuming the existence of a [[splitting field]] of the polynomial ''p''(''z''). At the end of the 18th century, two new proofs were published which did not assume the existence of roots. One of them, due to James Wood and mainly algebraic, was published in 1798 and it was totally ignored. Wood's proof had an algebraic gap.<ref>Concerning Wood's proof, see the article ''A forgotten paper on the fundamental theorem of algebra'', by Frank Smithies.</ref> The other one was published by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] in 1799 and it was mainly
