A module is a generalization of a [[Connected component (graph theory)|connected component]] of a graph. Unlike connected components, however, one module can be a proper subset of another. Modules therefore lead to a recursive (hierarchical) decomposition of the graph, instead of just a partition. For each undirected graph, this decomposition is unique. This notion can be generalized to other structures (for example directed graphs) and is useful to design efficient algorithms for the recognition of some graph classes, for finding transitive orientations of [[comparability graph]]s, for [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization problems]] on graphs, and for [[graph drawing]]. == Modules == As the notion of modules has been rediscovered in many areas, ''modules'' have also been called ''autonomous sets'', ''homogeneous sets'', ''intervals'', and ''partitive sets''. Perhaps the earliest reference to them, and the first description of modular quotients and the graph decomposition they give rise to appeared in ([[Tibor Gallai|Gallai]] 1967). A ''module'' of a graph is a generalization of a [[Connected component (graph theory)|connected component]]. A connected component has the property that it is a set ''X'' of vertices such that every member of ''X'' is a [[Neighbourhood (graph theory)|non-neighbor]] of every vertex not in ''X''. (It is a union of connected components if and only if it has this property.) More generally, ''X'' is a module if, for each vertex <math>v \not\in X</math>, either every member of ''X'' is a non-neighbor of ''v'' or every member of ''X'' is a neighbor of ''v''. Equivalently, ''X'' is a module if all members of ''X'' have the same set of neighbors among vertices not in ''X''. Contrary to the connected components, the modules of a graph are the same as the modules of its [[Complement graph|complement]], and modules can be "nested": one module can be a proper subset of another. Note that the set ''V'' of vertices of a graph, as are its one-element subsets and the empty set; these are called the '''trivial modules'''. A graph may or may not have other modules. A graph is called '''prime''' if all of its modules are trivial. Despite these differences, modules preserve a desirable property of connected components, which is that many properties of the subgraph ''G[X]'' [[Glossary_of_graph_theory#Subgraphs|induced]] by a connected component are independent of the rest of the graph. A similar phenomenon also applies to the subgraphs induced by modules. The modules of a graph are therefore of great algorithmic interest. A set of nested modules, of which the modular decomposition is an example, can be used to guide the recursive solution of many combinatorial problems on graphs, such as recognizing and transitively orienting [[comparability graph]]s, recognizing and finding permutation representations of [[permutation graph]]s, recognizing whether a graph is a [[cograph]] and finding a certificate of the answer to the question, recognizing [[interval graph]]s and finding interval representations for them, defining [[distance-hereditary graph]]s (Spinrad, 2003) and for [[graph drawing]] (Papadoupoulos, 2006). They play an important role in Lovasz's celebrated proof of the [[perfect graph theorem#Characterizations and the perfect graph theorems|perfect graph theorem]] (Golumbic, 1980). For recognizing distance-hereditary graphs and [[circle graph]]s, a further generalization of modular decomposition, called the [[split decomposition]], is especially useful (Spinrad, 2003). To avoid the possibility of ambiguity in the above definitions, we give the following formal definitions of modules. <math>G = (V,E)</math>. <math>M \subseteq V</math> is a '''module''' of <math>G</math> if: * the vertices of <math>M</math> cannot be distinguished by any vertex in <math>V \backslash M</math>, i.e. <math>\forall u,v \in M, \forall x\in V \backslash M</math>, either <math>x</math> is adjacent to both <math>u</math> and <math>v</math> or <math>x</math> is not adjacent to both <math>u</math> and <math>v</math>. * the vertices of <math>M</math> have the same set of outer neighbors, i.e. <math>\forall u,v \in M, \{x \in V \backslash M</math> adjac <math>\emptyset</math>, <math>V</math> and all the [[Singleton set|singletons]] <math>\{v\}</math> for <math>v \in V</math> are modules, and are called '''trivial modules'''. A graph is '''prime''' if all its modules are trivial. [[connected component (graph theory)|Connected components]] of a graph <math>G</math>, or of
