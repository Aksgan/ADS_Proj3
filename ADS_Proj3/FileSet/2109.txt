than the majority of existing technologies, using tiled textures, allow. Currently, the only game that utilizes MegaTexture based on the Tech 4 engine is ''[[Enemy Territory: Quake Wars]]''. ===Rendering techniques used in id Tech 4=== *[[Unified lighting and shadowing]] *[[Shadow volume]] *[[MegaTexture]] ===Scripting=== id Tech 4 has a comprehensive [[scripting language]] which can be used when creating [[Mod (computer gaming)|mods]], and is used in Doom 3 to control monsters, weapons, and map events. This scripting language is similar to C++.<ref>[http://www.iddevnet.com/doom3/script.php Making DOOM 3 Mods : Scripts]</ref> In addition to the main scripting language, idTech 4 also has another scripting language that is used for [[Graphical user interface|GUIs]] - both the menus and [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]], and also for GUIs embedded into the game world.<ref>[http://www.iddevnet.com/doom3/guis.php Making DOOM 3 Mods : GUIs]</ref> These in-game GUIs are sufficiently powerful that you can, for example, run another game such as Doom 1 within the game-world.<ref>[http://www.battleteam.net/tech/fis/ Fully Interactive Surfaces]</ref> Despite this additional level of scripting, it is also possible to create [[Mod (computer gaming)|mods]] using C++ to build native code.<ref>[http://www.iddevnet.com/doom3/code.php Making DOOM 3 Mods : The Code]</ref> ===Sound=== As a result of the agreement with Creative regarding the patent on shadow volumes, the id Tech 4 engine supports [[OpenAL]], including the [[Creative Technology]] specific [[Environmental audio extensions|EAX]] extensions. The work to include OpenAL support was done by Creative Technology, not by id themselves.<ref>[http://www.creative.com/soundblaster/products/gaming/article.asp?articleID=59801&categoryID=13]</ref> ===Networking=== Initially, the id Tech 4 engine was planned to have a [[peer-to-peer]] networking model, however this was changed to a more traditional [[client–server model]].<ref>[http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/articles/531/531027p1.html Doom 3 multiplayer networking info]</ref> This part of the engine works in a fundamentally similar way to the [[id Tech 3]] equivalent, however id Tech 4 exposes a lot more of the network protocol to mod developers.<ref>[http://www.iddevnet.com/doom3/code.php The Code - see Game Utility Files]</ref> Although [[Doom 3]] only supported 4 players, the id Tech 4 engine can be used with more players than this, with ''[[Quake 4]]'' and ''[[Enemy Territory: Quake Wars]]'' both supporting significantly more players. == Games using id Tech 4 == {{Refimprove|section|date=November 2010}} [[File:Prey-Wall-Walking.png|thumb|right|200px|''Prey'' utilized a modified version of id Tech 4 that allowed for effects such as portals, variable gravity, and wall walking]] Unlike the preceding and widely-used [[id Tech 3]] (''[[Quake III Arena]]'' engine) and [[id Tech 2]] (''[[Quake II]]'' engine), id Tech 4 has had less success in licensing to third parties. This is especially apparent in comparison to its closest competitor, [[Unreal Engine#Unreal Engine 2|Unreal Engine 2]]. The unexpected long development time going into id Tech 4 did not help, as between 2002–2004, id Software had no equivalent to Unreal Engine 2. Many who licensed Unreal Engine 2 were thus able to make the switch to [[Unreal Engine#Unreal Engine 3|Unreal Engine 3]] more easily. While id Tech 4 had taken a new direction with its dynamic [[per-pixel lighting]], this unconventional feature had steeper hardware requirements and was initially only useful in "spooky games" (until the [[MegaTexture]] addition), whereas an increasing number of developers preferred conventional engines that could render large outdoor areas. Also notable was id Tech 4's relative lack of downward scalability compared to competing FPS engines which would have limited its potential audience; the [[Source (game engine)|Source engine]] could still run on the older widespread DirectX 7 GPUs, albeit without shaders being used. ===List=== *''[[Doom 3]]'' (2004) – [[id Software]] *''[[Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil]]'' (2005) – [[Nerve Software]] *''[[Quake 4]]'' (2005) – [[Raven Software]] *''[[Prey (video game)|Prey]]'' (2006) – [[Human Head Studios]] *''[[Enemy Territory: Quake Wars]]'' (2007) – [[Splash Damage]] *''[[Wolfenstein (2009 video game)|Wolfenstein]]'' (2009) – [[Raven Software]] *''[[Brink (video game)|Brink]]'' (2011) – [[Splash Damage]] ==See also== *[[List of game engines]] *[[First person shooter engine]] *[[id Tech 5]] *[[id Tech 3]] ==References== {{reflist|1}} ==External links== *[http://iddevnet.com/ Official MOD support website for the id Tech 4] *[http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/index.php Technical Help Forum & Custom Content Creation] *[http://www.modwiki.net/wiki/Main_Page id Tech 4 reference material] *[http://www.moddb.com/engines/id-tech-4 id Tech 4's ModDB page containing mod listing, tutorials, and more] *[http://money.cnn.com/2004/08/12/commentary/game_over/column_gaming CNN - Life after "Doom"] *[http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/enemy-territory-quake-wars/681231p1.html Gamespy article from which some information on MegaTexture was derived] *[http://www.digit-life.com/articles2/doom3/doom3.html Article detailing some features of id Tech 4] {{Quake series}} {{Doom series}} [[Category:Quake]] [[Category:Doom (franchise)]] [[Category:Video game engines]] [[Category:Virtual reality]] [[Category:2004 introductions]] [[es:Id Tech 4]] [[fr:Id Tech 4]] [[it:Id Tech 4]] [[lt:Id Tech 4]] [[hu:Id Tech 4]] [[pl:Id Tech 4]] [[ru:Id Tech 4]] [[fi:Id Tech 4]] [[zh:Id Tech 4引擎]]</text> </page> <page> <id>17829</id> <title>Idea NXT</title> <text>{{Infobox block cipher | name = IDEA NXT (FOX) | image = [[Image:Foxround.png|280px|center]] | caption = Round function of | designers = [[Pascal Junod]], [[Serge Vaudenay]] | publish date = 2003 | derived from = [[IDEA (cipher)|IDEA]] | derived to = | key size = 0-256 bits | block size = 64 or 128 bits | structure = [[Lai-Massey scheme]] | rounds = 16 | cryptanalysis = [[Integral attack]] on 7 round NXT-64 with time complexity of 2<sup>237.4</sup> and on 5 round NXT-128 with time complexity of 2<sup>205.6</sup> by Wu Wenling, Zhang Wentao, and Feng Dengguo. }} In [[cryptography]], the '''IDEA NXT''' algorithm (previously known as '''FOX''') is a [[block cipher]] designed by [[Pascal Junod]] and [[Serge Vaudenay]] of [[EPFL]] ([[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]]). It was conceived between 2001 and 2003, the project was originally named '''FOX''' and was published in 2003. In May 2005 it was announced by MediaCrypt under the name '''IDEA NXT'''. IDEA NXT is the successor of the [[IDEA (cipher)|IDEA]] algorithm and it uses an extended ''Lai-Massey'' scheme known for its robustness to cryptanalysis. It was mandated by ''MediaCrypt'', a Swiss company owner of the distribution rights on IDEA and the patents of IDEA NXT. The IDEA NXT cipher is a family of different sub-ciphers with various blocks and keys size : Standard NXT64 (block of 64 bits, key of 128 bits, 16 rounds) and Standard NXT128 (block of 128 bits, key of 256 bits, 16 rounds). Variations of the Standard versions can be built (key of 0-256 bits, round numbers from 2-255). Also individual tables (sbox, permutation matrix) can be loaded, replacing the Standard table. Mediacrypt states that IDEA NXT has
