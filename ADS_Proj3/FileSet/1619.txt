It provides a convenient command line interface for solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible with [[MATLAB]]. It may also be used as a batch-oriented language. As part of the [[GNU Project]], it is [[free software]] under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]]. == History == The project was conceived around 1988. At first it was intended to be a companion to a chemical reactor design course. Real development was started by [[John W. Eaton]] in [[1992]]. The first alpha release dates back to January 4, 1993 and on February 17, 1994 version 1.0 was released. Version 3.0 was released on December 21, 2007. The program is named after [[Octave Levenspiel]], a former professor of the principal author who was known for his ability to perform quick [[back-of-the-envelope calculation]]s.<ref name="about">{{cite web | last = Eaton | first = John W | title = About Octave | url = http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/about.html | accessdate = 2009-06-28 }}</ref> ==Deployments == In addition to use on desktops for personal scientific computing, Octave is used in academia and industry. For example, Octave was used on a massive parallel computer at Pittsburgh supercomputing center to find vulnerability related to guessing social security numbers.<ref> [http://www.hpcwire.com/industry/government/Social-Security-Number-Vulnerability-Findings-Relied-on-Supercomputing-50292227.html HPC], July 8, 2009. </ref> == Technical details == * Octave is written in [[C++]] using [[Standard Template Library|STL]] libraries. * Octave uses an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] to execute the Octave scripting language. * Octave is extensible using dynamically loadable modules. * Octave interpreter works with [[gnuplot]] and [[Grace (plotting tool)|Grace]] software to create plots, graphs, and charts, and to save or print them. == Octave, the language == The Octave language is an interpreted programming language. It is a [[programming|structured programming]] language (similar to [[C (programming language)|C]]) and supports many common [[C standard library]] functions, and also certain [[POSIX|UNIX]] system calls and functions.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.network-theory.co.uk/docs/octave3/octave_269.html | title = GNU Octave - Controlling subprocesses | accessdate = Jan 28, 2009 | date = November 14, 2008 }}</ref> However, it does not support passing arguments by reference.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/octave/octave_105.html | title = GNU Octave | accessdate = Jan 28, 2009 }}</ref> Octave programs consist of a list of function calls or a [[script (computer programming)|script]]. The syntax is [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]-based and provides various functions for matrix operations. It is not [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]], but it does support various [[data structure]]s. <!--Candidate for expansion --> Its syntax is very similar to MATLAB, and careful programming of a script will allow it to run on both Octave and MATLAB.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/FAQ.html#MATLAB-compatibility | title = FAQ: MATLAB compatibility | accessdate = July 4, 2009 }}</ref> Because Octave is made available under the [[GNU General Public License]], it may be freely changed, copied and used.<ref name="about" /> The program runs under most [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s, as well as [[Mac OS X]] and [[Microsoft Windows]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/FAQ.html#Getting-Octave | title = FAQ: Getting Octave | accessdate = July 4, 2009 }}</ref> == Notable features == ===Command and variable name completion=== Typing a TAB character on the command line causes Octave to attempt to complete variable, function, and file names (similar to [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]]'s [[tab completion]]). Octave uses the text before the cursor as the initial portion of the name to complete. ===Command history=== When running interactively, Octave saves the commands typed in an internal buffer so that they can be recalled and edited. ===Data structures=== Octave includes a limited amount of support for organizing data in structures. For instance: <pre> octave:1> x.a = 1; x.b = [1, 2; 3, 4]; x.c = "string"; octave:2> x.a ans = 1 octave:3> x.b ans = 1 2 3 4 octave:4> x.c ans = string octave:5> x x = { a = 1 b = 1 2 3 4 c = string } </pre> ===Short-circuit boolean operators=== Octave's '&&' and '||' logical operators are evaluated in a [[Short-circuit evaluation|short-circuit]] fashion (like the corresponding operators in the [[C (programming language)|C]] language), in contrast to the element-by-element operators '&' and '|'. ===Increment and decrement operators=== Octave includes the C-like increment and decrement operators '++' and '--' in both their prefix and postfix forms. ===Unwind-protect=== Octave supports a limited form of exception handling modeled after the unwind-protect form of
