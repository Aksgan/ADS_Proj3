Evans Biography and Photograph Collection at the University of Utah]</ref> Evans attended the University of Utah and studied electrical engineering; he earned his doctorate degree in physics. Evans first worked at the [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix]] aviation electronics company, where he acted as project manager in 1955 to develop what some describe as an early [[personal computer]] that ran on an interpretive operating system. The [[Bendix G-15]] was a bulky unit about the size of a two door refrigerator. He stayed with the company just long enough to manage the G-16 project.<ref name="obit">[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02E6D91F3BF931A25753C1A96E958260&scp=27 David Evans, Pioneer in Computer Graphics, Dies at 74]</ref> Evans subsequently worked on the GENIE multi-user timesharing system while at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Evans was appointed a member of UC Berkeley's faculty. In addition, through his work at the Pentagon's [[Defense Advanced Research Project Agency|Advanced Research Project Agency]], he made key developments in the field of [[virtual memory]].<ref name="obit" /> His first important works with graphics also dates from that period, when he did several experiments on an [[IDIOM]] display hooked up to a [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]]-5. When he was building up the University of Utah department in 1968 he managed to convince [[Ivan Sutherland]] to come to [[Utah]], accepting the condition that they start a computer graphics company together. Evans retired from the company in 1994. Evans was a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). He served as a [[branch president]], a counselor in [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishoprics]] and [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stake presidencies]], and as a [[Scouting|scout master]] for a total of 27 years.<ref name = cn>''[[Church News]]'', October 26, 1996.</ref> Evans was award the [[Silver Beaver]] for his role in scouting.<ref>[http://partners.nytimes.com/library/tech/98/10/biztech/articles/12obit-evans.html ''New York Times'', obituary for Evans, Oct. 12, 1998]</ref> Evans married [[Joy F. Evans|Joy Frewin]]. They had ten children, only seven of which lived to adulthood. One of these is [[David F. Evans]], who became a [[general authority]] in the LDS Church. From 1984 to 1990, Joy Evans was a counselor in the general presidency of the [[Relief Society]] to [[Barbara W. Winder]]. At the time of his death in 1998 Evans had 39 living grandchildren and great grandchildren. In 1996, [[Brigham Young University]] established the David C. Evans Chair of Computer Engineering and Graphics. Evans was at the ceremony where the founding of a chair in his honor was announced, but due to his suffering from [[Alzheimer's disease]], did not make any remarks at the ceremony.<ref name = cn/> ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== {{Portal|Biography}} * {{Find a Grave|3659}} {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME = Evans, David C. | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH = | PLACE OF BIRTH = | DATE OF DEATH = | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Evans, David C.}} [[Category:American computer scientists]] [[Category:American Latter Day Saints]] [[Category:American educators]] [[Category:Computer graphics professionals]] [[Category:University of Utah faculty]] [[Category:University of Utah alumni]] [[Category:University of California, Berkeley faculty]] [[Category:1924 births]] [[Category:1998 deaths]]</text> </page> <page> <id>9548</id> <title>David Crane (programmer)</title> <text>'''David Crane''' (born in [[Nappanee, Indiana|Nappanee]], [[Indiana]], [[United States]]) is a [[Game designer|video game designer]] and [[game programmer|programmer]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Covert|first=Colin|title=Meet David Crane: Video Games Guru|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/hi-res/v1n2/davidcrane.php|work=Atari Magazine|publisher=Atari Magazine|accessdate=7 November 2010}}</ref> Crane started his programming career at [[Atari]], making games for the [[Atari 2600]]. After meeting co-worker [[Alan Miller (game designer)|Alan Miller]] in a tennis game, Miller told Crane about a plan he had to leave Atari and found a company that would give game designers more recognition. From this meeting, Crane left Atari in 1979 and co-founded [[Activision]], along with Miller, [[Jim Levy]], [[Bob Whitehead]], and [[Larry Kaplan]]. His games won many awards while he was at Activision. At Activision, he was best known as the designer of ''[[Pitfall!]]''.<ref name="wired_article">{{cite news|last=Kohler|first=Chris|title=Pitfall! creator David Crane named videogame pioneer|url=http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-01/27/pitfall!-creator-david-crane-named-videogame-pioneer|accessdate=7 November 2010|newspaper=Wired|date=27 January 2010}}</ref> Pitfall! was a huge hit, and maintained the top slot on the Billboard charts for 64 weeks and was named video game of the year in 1982.<ref name="devry">{{cite web|title=Alumnus Profile|url=http://www.alumni.devry.edu/news-events-alumni/profiles/david-crane.jsp|work=DeVry University|publisher=DeVry University|accessdate=7 November 2010}}</ref> Crane maintained that the Atari policy of relying on mangled adaptations of arcade games would result in a glut of cheap, unappealing games, which became one of the contributing factors to the [[Video Game Crash of 1983]]. He believed instead that tailoring new games to the strengths and weaknesses of the 2600 machine would have yielded positive results. The reasoning was that while the new games would have lacked the instant-promotion of an already-known name, word of mouth among video gamers, being a young and highly-social group, would have gradually made up for it if the game was good.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} In 1986, Crane left Activision to co-found [[Absolute Entertainment]] with [[Garry Kitchen]]. The two of them left mainly because of [[Jim Levy]]'s departure, and the way the newly appointed CEO of Activision, [[Bruce Davis (video game industry)|Bruce Davis]], treated video games more like commodities rather than creative products.
