any scales of the solution (such as [[Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations|Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes]] (RANS) methods). It also models the smallest (and most expensive <ref name="Pope_2000"/>) scales of the solution, rather than resolving them. This makes the computational cost for practical engineering systems with complex geometry or flow configurations, such as turbulent jets, pumps, vehicles, and landing gear, attainable using [[supercomputer|supercomputers]]. In contrast, [[direct numerical simulation]], which resolves every scale of the solution, is prohibitively expensive for nearly all systems with complex geometry or flow configurations. <!-- LES requires substantially less computational effort than [[direct numerical simulation]] (DNS), which resolves every turbulent length scale, but more effort than [[Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations]] (RANS) methods, which model all turbulent length scales. The computational demands also increase significantly in the vicinity of walls, and simulating such flows usually exceeds the limits of modern [[supercomputers]] today. For this reason, zonal approaches are often adopted, with RANS or other empirically-based models replacing LES in the wall region. The main advantage of LES over computationally cheaper RANS approaches is the increased level of detail it can deliver. While RANS methods provide time-averaged results that depend entirely upon the model used, LES is able to predict instantaneous flow characteristics and resolve turbulent flow structures that are independent of the model used. This is important, for example, in simulations involving chemical reactions, such as the [[combustion]] of fuel in an engine. While the averaged concentration of chemical species may be too low to trigger a reaction, instantaneously there can be localized areas of high concentration in which reactions will occur. LES also offers significantly more accurate results over RANS for flows involving [[flow separation]] or [[acoustics|acoustic]] prediction. --> == Filter Definition and Properties == {{Main|Filter (large eddy simulation)}} [[File:DNS Velocity Field.png|thumb|right|150px|A velocity field produced by a [[Direct numerical simulation|direct numerical simulation (DNS)]] of [[homogeneous isotropic turbulence|homogeneous decaying turbulence]].

The filtered field, denoted with a bar, is defined as:<ref name="Sagaut_2006">{{cite book |author=Sagaut, Pierre |title=Large Eddy Simulation for Incompressible Flows |publisher=Springer |year=2006 |edition=Third Edition |isbn=3540263446 }}</ref><ref name="Pope_2000">{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Pope |title=[http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521598869 Turbulent Flows] |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=9780521598866 }} </ref> :<math> \overline{\phi(\boldsymbol{x},t)} = \displaystyle{ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \phi(\boldsymbol{r},t^{\prime}) G(\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{r},t - t^{\prime}) dt^{\prime} d \boldsymbol{r} </math> where <math>G</math> is the filter convolution kernel. This can also be written as: :<math> \overline{\phi} = G \star \phi . </math> The filter kernel <math>G</math> has an associated cutoff length scale <math>\Delta</math> and cutoff time scale <math>\tau_{c}</math>. Scales smaller than these are eliminated from <math>\overline{\phi}</math>. Using the above filter definition, any field <math>\phi</math> may be split up into a filtered and sub-filtered (denoted with a prime) portion, as :<math> \phi = \bar{\phi} + \phi^{\prime} . </math> It is important to note that the [[Filter (large eddy simulation)|large eddy simulation filtering operation]] does not satisfy the properties of a [[Reynolds operator]]. == Filtered governing equations == The governing equations of LES are obtained by filtering the [[partial differential equations]] governing the flow field <math>\rho \boldsymbol{v}(\boldsymbol{x},t)</math>. There are differences between the incompressible and compressible LES governing equations, which lead to the definition of a new filtering operation. === Incompressible flow === For incompressible flow, the [[Continuity equation#Fluid dynamics|continuity equation]] and Navier-Stokes equations are filtered, yielding the filtered incompressible continuity equation, :<math> \frac{ \partial \overline{v_i} }{ \partial x_i } = 0 </math> and the filtered Navier-Stokes equations, :<math> \frac{ \partial \bar{u_i} }{ \partial t } + \frac{ \partial }{ \partial x_j } \left( \overline{ u_i u_j } \right) = - \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{ \partial \overline{p} }{ \partial x_i } + \nu \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} \left( \frac{ \partial \bar{u_i} }{ \partial x_j } + \frac{ \partial \bar{u_j} }{ \partial x_i } \right) = - \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{ \partial \overline{p} }{ \partial x_i } + 2 \nu \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} S_{ij}, </math> where <math>\bar{p}</math> is the filtered pressure field and <math>S_{ij}</math> is the rate-of-strain tensor. The [[nonlinear]] filtered advection term <math>\overline{u_i u_j}</math> is the chief cause of difficulty in LES modeling. It requires knowledge of the unfiltered velocity field, which is unknown, so it must be modeled. The analysis that follows illustrates the difficulty caused by the nonlinearity, namely, that it causes interaction between large and small scales, preventing separation of scales. The filtered advection term can be split up, following Leonard (1974),<ref name="Leonard_1974">{{cite journal |last=Leonard |first=A. |year=1974 |title=Energy cascade in large-eddy simulations of turbulent fluid flows |journal=Advances in Geophysics A |volume=18 |pages=237–248 |doi=10.1016/S0065-2687(08)60464-1}}</ref> as: :<math> \overline{u_i u_j} = \tau_{ij}^{r} + \overline{u}_i \overline{u}_j </math> where <math>\tau_{ij}^{r}</math> is the residual stress tensor, so that the filtered Navier Stokes equations become :<math> \frac{ \partial \bar{u_i} }{ \partial t } + \frac{ \partial }{ \partial x_j } \left( \overline{u}_i \overline{u}_j \right) = - \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{ \partial \overline{p} }{ \partial x_i } + 2 \nu \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} \bar{S}_{ij} - \frac{ \partial \tau_{ij}^{r} }{ \partial x_j } </math> with the residual stress tensor <math>\tau_{ij}^{r}</math> grouping all unclosed terms. Leonard decomposed this stress tensor as <math>\tau_{ij}^{r} = L_{ij} + C_{ij} + R_{ij}</math> and provided physical interpretations for each term. <math>L_{ij}</math>, the Leonard tensor, represents interactions among large scales, <math>R_{ij}</math>, the Reynolds stress-like term, represents interactions among the sub-filter scales (SFS), and <math>C_{ij}</math>, the Clark tensor, <ref name="Clark">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=R. |last2=Ferziger |first2=J. |last3=Reynolds |first3=W. |year=1979 |title=Evaluation of subgrid-scale models using an accurately simulated turbulent flow |journal=[[Journal of Fluid Mechanics]] |volume=91 |pages=1–16}}</ref> represents cross-scale interactions between large and small scales.<ref name="Leonard_1974"/> Modeling the unclosed term <math>\tau_{ij}^{r}</math> is the task of SFS models (also referred to as sub-grid scale, or SGS, models). This is made challenging by the fact that the sub-filter scale stress tensor <math>\tau_{ij}^{r}</math> must account for interactions among all scales, including filtered scales with unfiltered scales.
