the owner of the UNIX and UnixWare Copyrights".<ref name="doc377">[http://sco.tuxrocks.com/Docs/Novell/Novell-377.pdf Memorandum order and decision, document 377 in case 2:04CV139DAK], the court order on [[Groklaw]]</ref><ref name="novell379">[http://www.novell.com/prblogs/?p=379 Novell statement on todayâ€™s SCO ruling], Novell Open PR, 2007-08-10</ref> ====License administration standing==== The Novell to Santa Cruz Operation Asset Purchase Agreement also involved the administration of some 6000 standing licensing agreements between various UNIX users and the previous owners. These licensees include universities, software corporations and computer hardware companies. SCO's claimed ownership of the licenses has become an issue in three aspects of the SCO-Linux controversies. The first was the cancellation of IBM's license, the second was SCO's complaint against DaimlerChrysler (see ''[[SCO v. DaimlerChrysler]]''), and the third is the derivative works claim of the ''[[SCO v. IBM]]'' case. In May 2003, SCO canceled IBM's SVRx license to its version of UNIX, [[AIX operating system|AIX]]. This was based on SCO's claim of unrestricted ownership of the System V licensing contracts inherited from USL. IBM ignored the license cancellation, claiming that an amendment to the original license<ref>[http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20031107212034397 Groklaw - Amendment X as Text<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> made it "irrevocable." In addition, as part of the Purchase Agreement, Novell retained certain rights of control over the administration of the licenses which were sold, including rights to act on SCO's behalf in some cases. Novell exercised one of these rights by revoking SCO's cancellation of the IBM license. SCO disputed the validity of both of these actions, and amended its ''[[SCO v. IBM]]'' complaint to include copyright infringement, based on IBM's continued sale and use of AIX without a valid SVRx license. In December 2003, SCO demanded that all UNIX licensees certify some items, some related to the use of Linux, that were not provided for in the license agreement language. Since DaimlerChrysler failed to respond, SCO filed the ''[[SCO v. DaimlerChrysler]]'' suit in March 2004. All claims related to the certification demands were summarily dismissed by the court. ====Control of derivative works==== The third issue based on the UNIX licensees agreement is related to SCO's claims of control of derivative works. Many UNIX licensees have added features to the core UNIX SVRx system and those new features contain computer code not in the original SVRx code base. In most cases, software copyright is owned by the person or company that develops the code. SCO, however, claims that the original licensing agreements define this new code as a [[derivative work]]. They also claim that they have the right to control and restrict the use and distribution of that new code. These claims are the basis of ''[[SCO v. IBM]]''. SCO's initial complaint,<ref>[http://sco.tuxrocks.com/Docs/IBM/complaint3.06.03.html The SCO Group v<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> said that IBM violated the original licensing agreement by not maintaining confidentiality with the new code, developed and copyrighted by IBM, and releasing it to the Linux project. IBM claims that the license agreement (noted in the $Echo newsletter of April 1985)<ref>[http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20040211153230800 Groklaw - $ echo April 1985<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and subsequent licenses defines derivative works as the developer's property. This leaves IBM free to do as it wishes with its new code. In August 2004, IBM filed a motion for partial summary judgment. The motion stated that IBM has the right to do as it wishes with software not part of the original SVRx code. In February 2005, the motion was dismissed as premature, because discovery was not yet complete. IBM refiled this motion along with other summary judgment motions as noted below in September 2006.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}<!--WP:WEIGHT?--> ===SCO allegations of copyright and trade secret violations=== SCO claims that Linux infringes SCO's [[copyright]], [[trade secrets]], and contractual rights. This claim is fundamental to the [[SCOsource]] program, where SCO has demanded that Linux users obtain licenses from SCOsource to be properly licensed to use the code in question. Exactly which parts of Linux are involved remains unclear as many of their claims are still under seal in the ''[[SCO v. IBM]]'' lawsuit. SCO originally claimed in ''SCO v. IBM'' that IBM had violated trade secrets. But these alleged violations by IBM would not have involved Linux distributors or end users. SCO's trade secret claims were dropped by SCO in their amended complaint.<ref>[http://sco.tuxrocks.com/Docs/IBM/Doc-25.html The SCO Group v<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> SCO also claimed line-for-line literal copying of code from UNIX code files to Linux kernel files and obfuscated copying of code, but originally refused to publicly identify which code was in violation. SCO submitted to the court evidence of their claims under seal but much of it was excluded from the case after it was challenged by IBM as not meeting the specificity requirements to be included. These examples have fallen into two groups. The first are segments of files or whole files alleged to originate in UNIX SVRx code such as the [[errno.h]] header file. The second group are files and materials contributed by IBM that originated with IBM development work associated with AIX and [[Dynix]], IBM's two UNIX products. Each of these has a different set of issues. In order for copyright to be violated, several conditions must be met. First, the claimant must be able to show that they own the copyrights for the material in question. Second, all or a significant part of the source must be present in the infringing material. There must be enough similarity to show direct copying of material. ====SVRx code allegedly in Linux==== The issue of ownership of the SVRx code base was discussed [[SCO-Linux controversies#UNIX SVRx|above]]. Besides the unresolved issue of what was actually transferred from Novell to Santa Cruz Operation, there are also the portions of the SVRx code base that are covered by BSD copyrights or that are in the public domain. SCO's first public disclosure of what they claim is infringing code was at [[The SCO Group#History|SCO Forum]] in August 2003. The first, known as the [[Berkeley Packet Filter]], was distributed under the BSD License and is freely usable by anyone. The second example was related to memory allocation functions, also released
