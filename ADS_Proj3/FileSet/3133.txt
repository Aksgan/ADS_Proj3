Demon and Deporitaz== Cicierega created music from 1999 to 2002 under the name "Trapezoid", but changed it to "Deporitaz" (an [[anagram]] for the original title) when an [[Trapezoid (band)|existing band of the same name]] requested he rename it. Cicierega currently releases music and performs it live under the name of "'''Lemon Demon'''".<ref name=Globe>{{Cite document|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/06/22/hes_a_hit_with_internet_set/|title=He's a hit with Internet set|author=Emily Sweeney|publisher=Boston Globe|date=|unused_data=June 22, 2006|postscript=.}}</ref> He has released six Lemon Demon albums since 2003, selections from the first four of which have been made available for free download on the Lemon Demon website.<ref name="Lemon Demon's website">{{cite web|url=http://lemondemon.com|title=Lemon Demon's website}}</ref> His most recent album View-Monster, that was originally released in 2008, was released to [[iTunes]] in November 2009 becoming his first music available on the popular form of music downloading.<ref>[http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/view-monster/id342123548 View-Monster] (link requires [[iTunes]])</ref> '''Lemon Demon''' does, occasionally, perform live, mostly at local venues and events around the [[Boston Massachusetts]] area.

He has worked on videos with fellow Massachusetts internet film makers and friends Kevin James, Ryan Murphy, Max Pacheco and J.L. Carrozza. In 2008, Neil, Ryan and Kevin were commissioned to make a series of "[[webisodes]]" for [[Plymouth Rock Studios]]. The series, ''New Kids on the Rock'', is a [[tongue-in-cheek]] comedy about the trio's attempts to make webisodes for Plymouth Rock Studios. Several of Neil's short films have been featured on television shows such as [[G4 (TV channel)|G4]]'s ''[[Attack of the Show!]]'', [[The CW]]'s ''[[Online Nation]]'' and [[CBBC]]'s ''[[Chute! (television programme)|Chute!]]''. ==References== {{Reflist}} *[http://archive.salon.com/tech/log/2001/04/26/animation/ "All hail Neil Cicierega"] by Katharine Mieszkowski and Amy Standen, ''[[Salon.com]]'', 26 April 2001 *[http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/06/22/hes_a_hit_with_internet_set/ "He's a hit with Internet set"] by Emily Sweeney, ''[[Boston Globe]]'', 22 June 2006 ==External links== *[http://www.eviltrailmix.com/ EvilTrailMix.com], Neil Cicierega's personal website *[http://www.lemondemon.com/ Lemon Demon homepage] *[http://www.potterpuppetpals.com/ ''Potter Puppet Pals'' homepage] *[http://www.eviltrailmix.com/animutation/ Animutation homepage] *[http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=NeilCicierega Neil Cicierega's YouTube profile] *[http://www.hollywoodeasttv.com/profile/NewKidsOnTheRock ''New Kids on the Rock''] *[http://wiki.illemonati.com/Potter_Puppet_Pals ''PPP on unofficial Neil Cicierega's wiki.''] {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME = Cicierega, Neil | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH = August 24, 1986 | PLACE OF BIRTH = [[Boston, Massachusetts]], [[United States|U.S.]] | DATE OF DEATH = | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Cicierega, Neil}} <!-- Categories --> [[Category:1986 births]] [[Category:American alternative rock musicians]] [[Category:American amateur film directors]] [[Category:American Internet personalities]] [[Category:American puppeteers]] [[Category:Computer animation people]] [[Category:Crossover fiction]] [[Category:Flash artists]] [[Category:Flash cartoons]] [[Category:Internet culture]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:People from Plymouth County, Massachusetts]] [[Category:Keytarists]] [[Category:American people of Polish descent]] [[de:Neil Cicierega]] [[it:Neil Cicierega]] [[nl:Lemon Demon]] [[pt:Neil Cicierega]] [[fi:Neil Cicierega]] [[sv:Neil Cicierega]]</text> </page> <page> <id>26030</id> <title>Neil Weste</title> <text>'''Neil H. E. Weste''' (born 1951), is an Australian inventor and engineer, noted for having designed a 2-chip wireless LAN implementation and for authoring the textbook ''Principles of CMOS VLSI Design''. He has worked in many aspects of integrated-circuit design and was a co-founder of Radiata Communications. ==Life== Weste grew up in the [[Riverland|Riverland Region]] of South Australia. He received a BSc in Physics in 1974, a BE in 1976, and a Ph.D. in 1978, all from the [[University of Adelaide]]. Weste worked at a number American technology firms, including [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]], Microelectronics Center of North Carolina, [[Symbolics]], Agile Systems, and TLW. He was also at [[Duke University]] and the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]]. In 1995 he returned to Australia as a professor at [[Macquarie University]]. In 1997 he started Radiata Communications with David Skellern where the first 802.11a chip was designed. The company was acquired by [[Cisco Systems]] in 2001.<ref>http://www.tvp.com.au/portfolio/news/Emotiv-PR-March2007.pdf</ref> After the acquisition, Weste remained with Cisco for 2 years and then founded NHEW R&D, a technology-investment and consulting firm that he continues to manage. ==Inventions== Weste has 14 U.S. patents to his name, including a number of methods for doing wireless communication in CMOS integrated circuits. In 1998, Weste produced a CMOS chipset for the IEEE 802.11a wireless LAN. He did the conception, managed the project, and participated in the design. ==CMOS Textbook== Weste's textbook, ''Principles of CMOS VLSI Design'' (initially coauthored with [[Kamran Eshraghian]]<ref>Weste, Neil and Eshraghian, Kamran, ''Principles of CMOS VLSI Design - A Systems Perspective,'' Addison-Wesley, MA, 1985</ref><ref>Weste, Neil and Eshraghian, Kamran, ''Principles of CMOS VLSI Design - A Systems Perspective, 2nd Edition'' Addison-Wesley, MA, 1993</ref> but now coauthored with David Harris<ref>Weste, Neil and Harris, David, ''Principles of CMOS VLSI Design - A Circuits and Systems Perspective, 3rd Edition'' Addison-Wesley, MA, May 2004</ref><ref>Weste, Neil and Harris, David, ''Principles of CMOS VLSI Design - A Circuits and Systems Perspective, 4th Edition'' Addison-Wesley, MA, 2010</ref>) is a standard textbook in integrated-circuit design courses. It has been translated into Japanese, Greek, and Chinese. ==Other Publications== * Weste, N., "MULGA-An Interactive Symbolic Layout System for the Design of Integrated Circuits," in The Bell System Technical Journal, Vol. 60, No. 6, July-Aug. 1981, pp. 823–857. * Weste, N. and B.D.
