The number of subscribers has slowly been declining since the move to the web. However, ''GemStone'' still maintains a healthy playerbase, with a large group of players remaining active for years. There is at least one remaining player from ''GemStone ]['' and many others who have been playing for more than ten years. ==Awards and achievements== * 1998 Finalist, Online Game of the Year, Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences <ref>[http://www.interactive.org/awards/annual_awards.asp AIAS awards]</ref> * December 1996, AOL Members' Choice Award <ref>[http://www.washingtontechnology.com/print/12_23/13829-1.html Washington Technology 1998-03-05]</ref> ==GemStone IV - Shattered== In May of 2010, ''GemStone IV - Shattered'' was released by Simutronics. The new server is free of rules and any GM enforcement of policy besides bug abuse. Many players in this instance run scripts to advance their characters, and it provides a new and innovative approach to the game and player versus player (PvP) combat. Players enjoy an atmosphere of complete freedom, often highlighted by chaos due to the lack of PvP moderation by GameMasters. ==References== {{Reflist|colwidth=40em}} ==External links== * [http://www.play.net/gs4/ ''GemStone IV'' website] * [http://www.krakiipedia.org/ Krakiipedia, the Unofficial Free GemStone IV Encyclopedia] * [http://mudstats.com/Game/GemstoneIV.aspx GemStone IV Connected User Statistics] [[Category:MUD games]] [[Category:Virtual communities]] [[fi:GemStone IV]]</text> </page> <page> <id>14878</id> <title>Gemalto</title> <text>{{Primary sources|date=December 2009}} {{Infobox company | company_name = Gemalto N.V. | company_logo = [[Image:Gemalto.svg|210px]] | company_type = [[Naamloze vennootschap]] ({{Euronext|GTO}}) | foundation = 2006 | location = [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]] | key_people = Alex Mandl <small>([[Chairman]])</small>, Olivier Piou <small>([[chief executive officer|CEO]])</small> | industry = [[Electronics]] | products = [[Smart card]]s and related [[computer software|software]] and services, [[Credit card terminal|card terminals]] | origins = Merger of Gemplus and Axalto | revenue = [[Euro|€]]1.654 billion <small>(2009)</small><ref name="AR2009">{{cite web|url=http://www.gemalto.com/investors/download/gemalto_annual_report_2009.pdf|title=Annual Report 2009 |accessdate=2010-03-26|publisher=Gemalto|format=PDF}}</ref> | operating_income = €136.3 million <small>(2009)</small><ref name="AR2009" /> | net_income = €118.1 million <small>(2009)</small><ref name="AR2009" /> | num_employees = 10,000 <small>(2009)</small><ref name="AR2009" /> | homepage = [http://www.gemalto.com/ www.gemalto.com] | intl = yes }} '''Gemalto''' ({{Euronext|GTO}}) is an international digital security company, providing secure personal devices such as [[smart cards]] and tokens in addition to [[software applications]] and [[managed services]].

Axalto was a Schlumberger IPO spin-off in 2004. In April 2010, Gemalto completed the acquisition of internet banking security specialist Todos AB.<ref>[http://www.gemalto.com/php/pr_view.php?id=737 Gemalto acquired Todos]</ref> ===Axalto and Schlumberger=== [[Schlumberger]] began its [[chip card]] activities in February 1979 when it licensed and marketed certain chip card technologies developed and patented by Roland Moreno, who is generally credited with the invention of the chip card.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gemalto.com/investors/download/07-03-2006-prospectus.pdf|title=''Gemalto 2006 prospectus”|accessdate=1 November 2008}}</ref> Schlumberger developed the first telephone chip cards for [[France Telecom]] and the Swedish telecommunications operator [[Telia]] in the early 1980s. The company developed long-standing and close ties with telecommunications operators around the world and, as a result, played a role in industry-wide efforts to develop new digital mobile communication standards, particularly the [[GSM]] transmission standard (Global System for Mobile Communication). Schlumberger designed its first [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM]] (Subscriber Identity Module) card in the early 1990s for the launch of GSM in [[Europe]], and this led to the use of microprocessor card technology as an access and security solution for mobile telephony worldwide, in 3 billion handsets today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsmworld.com/news/statistics/index.shtml |title=”GSM World Statistics”|accessdate=1 November 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080822040039/http://www.gsmworld.com/news/statistics/index.shtml <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 22 August 2008}}</ref> In the early 1980s, the French banking sector decided to migrate from the magnetic stripe card-based payment system to a more modern and secure microprocessor card-based system. Schlumberger received its first contract in June 1981 to provide [[GIE Cartes Bancaires]], the French credit/debit card issuers’ association, with 5,000 microprocessor cards and 200 associated POS terminals. The microprocessor card-based payment system subsequently became standard in France and eventually led to a global standard known as [[EMV]], set up by Europay, MasterCard and Visa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gemalto.com/investors/agm/agm-2006-05-19/download/2005_annual_report.pdf|title=”Gemalto 2005 Annual Report”|accessdate=1 November 2008}}</ref> Today there are 730 million EMV cards in circulation. Schlumberger experienced strong internal and external growth since the launch of its chip card operations in the early 1980s through the 1990s and 2000s, both in terms of revenue and product portfolio, particularly with the substantial growth in GSM-based mobile telecommunications. Significant acquisitions of regional companies in card production and personalization included Cowells (United Kingdom), Malco (United States), Printer (Mexico) and Cardtech (Brazil). The acquisition of Solaic in 1996 and Bull-CP8 from Bull in 2001 allowed the company to strengthen its presence in the banking services in France and China. In 2003, Schlumberger created Axalto as a division to consolidate into one company all of its card and POS terminal activities, which until then had been managed by several subsidiaries and joint ventures of the Schlumberger group. Subsequently Axalto was successfully listed on the [[Euronext]] Paris market on May 18, 2004. ===Gemplus=== Gemplus started its operations in 1988 as a supplier of prepaid phonecards.
