on how well they "connect" the network. "Betweenness", "Closeness", and "Degree" are all measures of centrality. ;[[Centralization]]: The difference between the number of links for each node divided by maximum possible sum of differences. A centralized network will have many of its links dispersed around one or a few nodes, while a decentralized network is one in which there is little variation between the number of links each node possesses. * ;[[Closeness (graph theory)|Closeness]]: The degree an individual is near all other individuals in a network (directly or indirectly). It reflects the ability to access information through the "[[Grapevine (gossip)|grapevine]]" of network members. Thus, closeness is the inverse of the sum of the shortest distances between each individual and every other person in the network. (See also: [[Proxemics]]) The shortest path may also be known as the "geodesic distance". ;[[Clustering coefficient]]: A measure of the likelihood that two associates of a node are associates themselves. A higher clustering coefficient indicates a greater 'cliquishness'. ;Cohesion: The degree to which actors are connected directly to each other by [[Social cohesion|cohesive bonds]]. Groups are identified as ‘[[clique]]s’ if every individual is directly tied to every other individual, ‘[[social circle]]s’ if there is less stringency of direct contact, which is imprecise, or as [[Structural cohesion|structurally cohesive]] blocks if precision is wanted.<ref>[http://intersci.ss.uci.edu/wiki/index.php/Cohesive_blocking Cohesive.blocking] is the R program for computing structural cohesion according to the Moody-White (2003) algorithm. This wiki site provides numerous examples and a tutorial for use with R.</ref> ;[[Centrality#Degree_centrality|Degree]]: The count of the number of ties to other actors in the network. See also [[degree (graph theory)]]. ;(Individual-level) [[Dense graph|Density]]: The degree a respondent's ties know one another/ proportion of ties among an individual's nominees. Network or global-level density is the proportion of ties in a network relative to the total number possible (sparse versus dense networks). ;Flow betweenness centrality: The degree that a node contributes to sum of maximum flow between all pairs of nodes (not that node). ;[[Centrality#Eigenvector_centrality|Eigenvector centrality]]: A measure of the importance of a [[Vertex (graph theory)|node]] in a [[network (mathematics)|network]]. It assigns relative scores to all nodes in the network based on the principle that connections to nodes having a high score contribute more to the score of the node in question. ;Local bridge: An edge is a local bridge if its endpoints share no common neighbors. Unlike a bridge, a local bridge is contained in a cycle. ;Path length: The distances between pairs of nodes in the network. Average path-length is the average of these distances between all pairs of nodes. ;Prestige: In a directed graph prestige is the term used to describe a node's centrality. "Degree Prestige", "Proximity Prestige", and "Status Prestige" are all measures of Prestige. See also [[degree (graph theory)]]. ;Radiality: Degree an individual’s network reaches out into the network and provides novel information and influence. ;Reach: The degree any member of a network can reach other members of the network. ;[[Structural cohesion]]: The minimum number of members who, if removed from a group, would disconnect the group.<ref>Moody, James, and Douglas R. White (2003). "Structural Cohesion and Embeddedness: A Hierarchical Concept of Social Groups." ''American Sociological Review'' 68(1):103–127. [http://www2.asanet.org/journals/ASRFeb03MoodyWhite.pdf Online]: ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]] file).</ref> ;[[Equivalence relation|Structural equivalence]]: Refers to the extent to which nodes have a common set of linkages to other nodes in the system. The nodes don’t need to have any ties to each other to be structurally equivalent. ;Structural hole: Static holes that can be strategically filled by connecting one or more links to link together other points. Linked to ideas of [[social capital]]: if you link to two people who are not linked you can control their communication. ==Network analytic software== {{main|Social network analysis software}} Network analytic tools are used to represent the nodes (agents) and edges (relationships) in a network, and to analyze the network data. Like other software tools, the data can be saved in external files. Additional information comparing the various data input formats used by network analysis software packages is available at NetWiki. Network analysis tools allow researchers to investigate large networks like the Internet, disease transmission, etc. These tools provide mathematical functions that can be applied to the network model. ==Visualization of networks== Visual representation of social networks is important to understand the network data and convey the result of the analysis [http://www.cmu.edu/joss/content/articles/volume1/Freeman.html]. Many of the analytic software have modules for network visualization. Exploration of the data is done through displaying nodes and ties in various layouts, and attributing colors, size and other advanced properties to nodes. Typical representation of the network data are graphs in network layout (nodes and ties). These are not very easy-to-read and do not allow an intuitive interpretation. Various new methods have been developed in order to display network data in more intuitive format (e.g. [[Sociomapping]]). Especially when using social network analysis as a tool for facilitating change, different approaches of participatory network mapping have proven useful. Here participants / interviewers provide network data by actually mapping out the network (with pen and paper or digitally) during the data collection session. One benefit of this approach is that it allows researchers to collect qualitative data and ask clarifying questions while the network data is collected.<ref>Bernie Hogan, Juan-Antonio Carrasco and Barry Wellman, "Visualizing Personal Networks: Working with Participant-Aided Sociograms," ''Field Methods'' 19 (2), May 2007: 116-144.</ref> Examples of network mapping techniques are [[Net-Map Toolbox|Net-Map]] (pen-and-paper based) and [http://www.vennmaker.com/en/ VennMaker] (digital). ==Patents== [[File:Soc-net-paten-growth-chart.png|thumb|right|Number of US social network patent applications published per year and patents issued per year<ref>[http://ipwatchdog.com/2011/01/23/don%E2%80%99t-steal-my-avatar-challenges-of-social-networking-patents/id=14531/ Mark Nowotarski, "Don't Steal My Avatar!
