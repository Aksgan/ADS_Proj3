Within each [[subtree]], the node with the highest weight appears at the root. This can result in more efficient searching performance. Construction of such a tree is similar to that of a [[Treap]], but node weights are chosen randomly in the latter. [[Image:Weight_balanced_tree2.jpg|frame|Example of weight balanced tree]] ==The diagram== In the diagram to the right, the letters represent node ''values'' and the numbers represent node ''weights''. Values are used to order the tree, as in a general [[binary search tree]]. The weight may be thought of as a probability or activity count associated with the node. In the diagram, the root is G because its weight is the greatest in the tree. The left subtree begins with A because, out of all nodes with values that come before G, A has the highest weight. Similarly, N is the highest-weighted node that comes after G. ==Timing analysis== A weight balanced tree gives close to optimal values for the expected length of successful search calculations. From the above example we get ELOSS = depth(node A)*probability(node A) + depth(node C)*probability(node C) + ... ELOSS = 2*0.17 + 5*0.03 + 4*0.09 + 3*0.12 + 1*0.20 + 3*0.11 + 3*0.10 + 2*0.18 ELOSS = 2.4 This is the expected number of nodes that will be examined before finding the desired node. == See also == * [[Binary tree]] * [[AVL tree]] * [[B-tree]] * [[Binary space partitioning]] * [[Red-black tree]] * [[Treap]] == References == * [[Jean-Paul Tremblay and Grant A.

WFQ is a generalization of [[fair queuing]] (FQ). Both in WFQ and FQ, each data flow has a separate [[FIFO]] queue. In FQ, with a link data rate of <math>R</math>, at any given time the <math>N</math> active data flows (the ones with non-empty queues) are serviced simultaneously, each at an average data rate of <math>R/N</math>. Since each data flow has its own queue, an ill-behaved flow (who has sent larger packets or more packets per second than the others since it became active) will only punish itself and not other sessions. Contrary to FQ, WFQ allows different sessions to have different service shares. If <math>N</math> data flows currently are active, with weights <math>w_1, w_2 ... w_N,</math> data flow number <math>i</math> will achieve an average data rate of <math>\frac{Rw_i}{(w_1+w_2+...+w_N)}</math> It can be proven <ref>{{cite journal |title=Latency-rate servers: a general model for analysis of traffic scheduling algorithms | author=Stiliadis, D. and Varma, A. |journal=IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (TON) | volume=6 | issue=5 | pages=611–624 | date=1998 | publisher=IEEE Press Piscataway, NJ, USA |doi=10.1109/90.731196}}</ref> that when using a network with WFQ switches and a data flow that is [[leaky bucket]] constrained, an end-to-end delay bound can be guaranteed. By regulating the WFQ weights dynamically, WFQ can be utilized for controlling the [[quality of service]], for example to achieve guaranteed data rate. [[Proportional fairness]] can be achieved by setting the weights to <math>w_i=1/c_i</math>, where <math>c_i</math> is the cost per data bit of data flow <math>i</math>. For example in [[CDMA]] spread spectrum cellular networks, the cost may be the required energy (the interference level), and in [[channel allocation schemes|dynamic channel allocation]] systems, the cost may be the number of nearby base station sites that can not use the same frequency channel, in view to avoid co-channel interference. == References == {{reflist}} == See also == * [[Statistical multiplexing]] * Computing [[scheduling disciplines]] * [[Scheduling algorithm]] * [[Deficit round robin]] * [[Weighted round robin]] * [[Fair Queuing]] * [[Max-min fairness]] * [[Proportional fairness]] [[Category:Scheduling algorithms]] [[Category:Routing algorithms]] [[de:Weighted-Fair-Queuing]] [[es:Espera Equitativa Ponderada]] [[ru:Честная очередь с весовыми коэффициентами]]</text> </page> <page> <id>40005</id> <title>Weighted network</title> <text>{{Cleanup|date=April 2010}} A '''weighted network''' is a network where the ties among nodes have weights assigned to them. A [[Network (mathematics)|network]] is a system whose elements are somehow connected (Wasserman and Faust, 1994)<ref>Wasserman, S., Faust, K., 1994. Social Network Analysis: Methods and Applications. Cambridge University Press, New York, NY.</ref>. The elements of a system are represented as nodes (also known as actors or vertices) and the connections among interacting elements are known as ties, edges, arcs, or links. The nodes might be neurons, individuals, groups, organisations, airports, or even countries, whereas ties can take the form of friendship, communication, collaboration, alliance, flow, or trade, to name a few. In a number of real-world networks, not all ties in a network have the same capacity. In fact, ties are often associated with weights that differentiate them in terms of their strength, intensity or capacity (Barrat et al., 2004)<ref name="barrat04">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0400087101 | author = [[A.
