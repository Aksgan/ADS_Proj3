about [[1988]] HP 3000s using PA-RISC processors began shipping in volume and, by 1995, effectively displaced the older family of machines from use although, as with all technology shifts, there remained a significant residue of older machines in service. The PA-RISC based HP 3000's operating system was written primarily in Modcal, HP's extended version of [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]. Large portions of the earlier MPE V operating system, written in SPL, are still used as part of MPE XL and MPE/iX on PA-RISC. A few subsystems (e.g., TurboIMAGE) are written in PSPL (Portable SPL). A small portion of MPE XL and MPE/iX is written in PA-RISC assembly language. The 3000 series operating system was originally styled the [[Multi-Programming Executive]], MPE (later called MPE XL and then, after [[POSIX]] compliance was added in versions 5.0-5.5, MPE/iX). Early versions had a fairly primitive command line interpreter, with a three-level hierarchical file system, and utilities such as compilers would resemble "run fortran.pub.sys" rather than allowing programs to be run as keyword commands. People who used the HP 3000 would notice that machines were fairly reliable compared to other minicomputers of the time. Part of the tremendous success of the HP 3000 was due to the provision of, with brief exceptions included as part of the Fundamental Operating System (FOS), a vendor developed shallow network database management system ([[DBMS]]) called IMAGE (now called [[TurboIMAGE]]) that was reputedly inspired by (if not actually based upon) the TOTAL DBMS developed by [[Cincom|Cincom Systems, Inc.]] Including IMAGE with the server created an ecosystem of applications and development utilities that could rely upon IMAGE as a data repository in any HP 3000. Almost uniquely in computer history, it remains a feature of MPE that forward binary compatibility of executable programs is preserved across all systems and all versions of the operating system, regardless of hardware architecture. Programs that ran on the original Series II in 1973 can be reloaded from tape onto the last N-Series machines produced in 2003 and run today without recompiling. As the enterprise computing market shifted towards standardized [[Unix]] systems, which HP had also been promoting, in November 2001, Hewlett-Packard announced that its [[end-of-life (product)|end-of-life]] for the HP 3000 would be the end of 2006, and that no new systems would be sold after 2003. In early 2006, Hewlett-Packard announced that limited vendor support for the HP 3000 would be extended by two years for certain clients or geographic regions. In September 2007, HP once more extended its support for the systems, offering Mature Product Support without Sustaining Engineering (creation of software patches). This has been one of the longest lifetimes for a proprietary minicomputer system. The computers would outlast the highly regarded [[PDP-11]] and [[VAX]] series, although [[OpenVMS]] operating system is still being offered on [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]]- and [[IA-64]]-based systems as Hewlett Packard products. == Use of stack instead of registers == Most current computer instruction sets are based on a [[general purpose register]] model. The processor and memory architecture of the classic HP 3000 were based on a [[stack machine]] model, like HP's well-known line of [[Reverse Polish notation|RPN]] calculators. It was said to be inspired by the famous stack-based [[Burroughs large systems]]. Rather than having a small number of registers, for example only an AX and BX register in the case of the [[HP 1000]], operands would be pushed on the same stack used to store local variables and [[return address]]es. So rather than <pre>LOAD AX, 0X0001 LOAD BX, 0X0002 ADD AX, BX</pre> you would have <pre>LDI 1 LDI 2 ADD</pre> The 16-bit [[microcode]]d machines (Series I, II, III, 30, 33, 39, 40, 42, 44, 48, 52, 58, 64, 68, 70, 37, ...) implement a [[word-addressable|16-bit word addressed]], [[byte-addressable]], segmented, [[Harvard architecture|Harvard]], [[stack (data structure)|Stack]] [[Instruction Set]] Architecture (ISA). Most of the ~214 instructions are 16 bits wide. Stack operations pack 2 per 16-bit word and the remaining few are 32 bits wide.
