reservation of bandwidth, not to mention quality of service.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} However, this avoids the need for a separate DECT radio network. Other potential competitors for office installations include the [[Personal Handy-phone System]] (popular in Asia), and the use of private calls in a local [[microcell]] (using a cellular phone technology). ==Technical development and adoption== The DECT standard was developed by [[ETSI]] in several phases, the first of which took place between 1988 and 1992 when the first round of standards were published. These were the ETS 300-175 series in 9 parts defining the air interface, and ETS 300-176 defining how the units should be type approved. A technical report, ETR-178, was also published to explain the standard. Subsequent standards were developed and published by ETSI to cover interoperability profiles and standards for testing. Initially named "Digital European Cordless Telephone" at its launch by CEPT in November 1987, following a suggestion by Enrico Tosato of Italy, its name was soon changed to "Digital European Cordless Telecommunications" to reflect its broader range of application, including data services. In 1995, due to its more global usage, the name was changed from "European" to "Enhanced." It is an [[ETSI]] standard for digital [[portable phone]]s (cordless home telephones), commonly used for domestic or corporate purposes. It is recognised by the [[ITU]] as fulfilling the [[IMT-2000]] requirements and thus qualifies as a [[3G]] system. Within the IMT-2000 group of technologies, DECT is referred to as '''IMT-2000 Frequency Time''' ('''IMT-FT''') DECT was developed by ETSI but has since been adopted by many countries all over the world. The original DECT frequency band (1880 [[MHz]]–1900 MHz) is used in all countries in [[Europe]]. Outside Europe, it is used in most of [[Asia]], [[Australia]] and [[South America]]. In the [[United States]], the [[Federal Communications Commission]] in 2005 changed channelization and licensing costs in a nearby band (1920 MHz–1930 MHz, or 1.9 [[GHz]]), known as [[Unlicensed Personal Communications Services]] (UPCS), allowing DECT devices to be sold in the U.S. with only minimal changes. These channels are reserved exclusively for voice communication applications and therefore are less likely to experience interference from other wireless devices such as [[baby monitor]]s and [[wireless network]]s. ===Features=== Typical abilities of a domestic DECT [[Generic access profile|Generic Access Profile]] (GAP) system include: * Multiple handsets to one base station and one phone line socket. This allows several cordless telephones to be placed around the house, all operating from the same telephone jack. Additional handsets have a battery charger station which does not plug into the telephone system. Handsets can in many cases be used as [[intercom]]s, communicating between each other, and sometimes as [[walkie-talkie]]s, intercommunicating without telephone line connection. * Interference-free wireless operation to around 100 metres (109 yards) outdoors, much less indoors when separated by walls. Operates clearly in common congested domestic radio traffic situations, for instance, generally immune to interference from other DECT systems, [[Wi-Fi]] networks, [[video sender]]s, [[Bluetooth]] technology, baby monitors and other wireless devices. * Talk-time of several hours and standby time of several days on one battery charge. Some systems offer: * A longer range between the telephone and base station (usable further from the base) * Extended battery talk-time, sometimes up to 24 hours{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} ===Technical properties=== Some DECT properties:{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} * Audio codec: [[G.726]] * Net bit rate: 32 kbit/s * Frequency: 1880 MHz–1900 MHz in Europe, 1900 MHz-1920 MHz in China, 1910 MHz-1930 MHz in Latin America and 1920 MHz–1930 MHz in the US and Canada * Carriers: 10 (1,728 kHz spacing) in Europe, 5 (1,728 kHz spacing) in the US * Time slots: 2 x 12 (up and down stream) * Channel allocation: dynamic * Average transmission power: 10 mW (250 mW peak) in Europe, 4 mW (100 mW peak) in the US The DECT [[physical layer]] uses: *[[Frequency division multiple access]] (FDMA), *[[Time division multiple access]] (TDMA) and *[[Time division duplex]] (TDD) This means that the [[radio spectrum]] is divided into physical channels in two dimensions: frequency and time. The maximum allowed power for portable equipment as well as base stations is 250 mW. A portable device radiates an average of about 10 mW during a call as it is only using one of 24 time slots to transmit. The DECT [[media access control]] layer controls the physical layer and provides [[connection oriented]], [[connectionless]] and [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] services to the higher layers. The DECT [[data link layer]] uses LAPC (Link Access Protocol Control), a specially designed variant of the [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]] data link protocol called LAPD. They are based on [[HDLC]]. The DECT [[network layer]] always contains the following protocol entities: * Call Control (CC) * Mobility Management (MM) Optionally it may also contain others: * Call Independent Supplementary Services (CISS) * Connection Oriented Message Service (COMS) * Connectionless Message Service (CLMS) All these communicate through a Link Control Entity (LCE). The call control protocol is derived from [[ISDN]] [[DSS1]], which is a [[Q.931]] derived protocol. Many DECT-specific changes have been made.{{Specify|date=June 2010}} The mobility management protocol includes many elements similar to the GSM protocol, but also includes elements unique to DECT. Unlike the GSM protocol, the DECT network specifications do not define cross-linkages between the operation of the entities (e.g. Mobility Management and Call Control). The architecture presumes that such linkages will be designed into the interworking unit that connects the DECT access network to whatever mobility-enabled fixed network is involved. By keeping the entities separate, the handset is capable of responding to any combination of entity traffic, and this creates great flexibility in fixed nework design without breaking full interoperability. DECT [[Generic access profile|GAP]] is an interoperability profile for DECT. The intent is that two different products from different manufacturers that both conform not only to the DECT standard, but also to the GAP profile defined within the DECT standard, are able to interoperate for basic calling. The DECT standard includes full testing suites for GAP, and GAP products on the market from different manufacturers are in practice interoperable for
