the reporting standards for the TRI program. Several state [[attorney general]]s wrote to EPA asking that the standard not be altered. The proposed revisions came under fire from [[Eliot Spitzer]], then the Attorney General for [[State of New York|New York]], who said "Public disclosure has proven to be a strong incentive for polluters to reduce their use of toxic chemicals, this move by EPA appears to be yet another poorly considered notion to appease a few polluting constituents at the expense of a valuable program."<ref>{{cite news |title=States ask EPA to reconsider TRI changes |author=Geiselman, Bruce |newspaper=Waste & Recycling News |date= 2006-01-30 |url=http://www.wasterecyclingnews.com/arcshow.html?id=06013001402&query1=toxic&bool=AND&query2=release&maxfiles=25&start=0&year=2006 |accessdate= |issn=1091-6199 }}</ref> EPA originally proposed to reduce the required reporting frequency from every year to every other year. This drew intense criticism, and the idea was dropped. However, EPA went forward with another part of the plan that initially did not receive much attention. Companies were previously required to disclose any release over 2000 pounds (907 kg) on a more detailed "Form R" rather than the less detailed "Form A." With the new regulations, the minimum reporting requirements for Form R have been increased to 5000 pounds (2268 kg), thus reducing the amount of information available. Although this move was widely criticized by the public as well as many officials, EPA went ahead with the new rule anyway.<ref>OMB Watch (2007). [http://www.ombwatch.org/article/articleview/3670/1/474 "EPA Finalizes Rules for Toxics Release Inventory."] January 9, 2007. Vol. 8, No. 1.</ref> EPA claimed that the comments submitted opposed to the Form R requirements were invalid because nearly all the people who had commented did so on both the change in reporting frequency as well as the minimum amounts required for Form R. ==Accessing TRI data== The data in the Toxic Release Inventory is available to the public, but initially the system was difficult to access. In recent years, EPA and several other organizations have made the task much easier. '''Mapping Systems''' There are several tools for mapping the TRI data to particular locations. These tools also allow the user to view some of the information in the database. [[Image:benzene release 2007-8 lower 48 US.JPG|thumb|right|200px|'''TOXMAP''', A Map of benzene release 2007-8 lower 48 US]] *[[TOXMAP]] is a Geographic Information System (GIS) from the Division of Specialized Information Services [http://sis.nlm.nih.gov] of the [[United States National Library of Medicine]] (NLM) that uses maps of the United States to help users visually explore data from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s (EPA) Toxics Release Inventory and [[Superfund Basic Research Program]]s. TOXMAP is a resource funded by the US Federal Government. TOXMAP's chemical and environmental health information is taken from NLM's Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET) [http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov] and [[PubMed]], and from other authoritative sources.
