to delay the inevitable, fearful that revolution might lead to anarchy, tyranny or mob rule. In contrast, the prevailing attitude among Patriots, who made systematic efforts to use mob violence in a controlled manner, was a desire to seize the initiative.<ref>Hull et al, ''Choosing Sides'' (1978) pp. 344–66</ref><ref>Burrows and Wallace, ''The American Revolution'' (1972) pp. 167–305</ref> Labaree also writes that Loyalists were pessimists who lacked the confidence in the future displayed by the Patriots.<ref name="Labaree, 1948 pp. 164-5"/> Historians, such as [[J. Franklin Jameson]] in the early 20th century, examined the class composition of the Patriot cause, looking for evidence that there was a class war inside the revolution.<ref>J. Franklin Jameson, ''The American Revolution Considered as a Social Movement'' (1926); other historians pursuing the same line of thought included [[Charles Beard]], [[Carl Becker]] and [[Arthur Schlesinger, Sr.]].</ref> In the last 50 years, historians have largely abandoned that interpretation, emphasizing instead the high level of ideological unity.<ref>Wood, "Rhetoric and Reality in the American Revolution" (1966) pp. 3–32</ref> Just as there were rich and poor Loyalists, the Patriots were a 'mixed lot', with the richer and better educated more likely to become officers in the Army. Ideological demands always came first: the Patriots viewed independence as a means of freeing themselves from British oppression and taxation and, above all, reasserting what they considered to be their rights. Most yeomen farmers, craftsmen, and small merchants joined the Patriot cause as well, demanding more political equality. They were especially successful in the Pennsylvania but less so in New England, where John Adams attacked Thomas Paine's ''Common Sense'' for the "absurd democratical notions" it proposed.<ref>Nash (2005)</ref><ref>Resch (2006)</ref> ===Loyalists=== {{Main|Loyalist (American Revolution)}} While there is no way of knowing the actual numbers, historians have estimated that about 15–20% of the population remained loyal to the British Crown; these were known at the time as "Loyalists", "Tories", or "King's men". The Loyalists never controlled territory unless the British Army occupied it.<ref name="Calhoon, 1992 p. 235">Calhoon, ''Loyalism and Neutrality'' (1992) p. 235</ref> Loyalists were typically older, less willing to break with old loyalties, often connected to the [[Church of England]], and included many established merchants with business connections across the Empire, as well as royal officials such as Thomas Hutchinson of Boston. The revolution sometimes divided families; for example, the Franklins. [[William Franklin]], son of Benjamin Franklin and governor of the [[Province of New Jersey]] remained Loyal to the Crown throughout the war and never spoke to his father again. Recent immigrants who had not been fully Americanized were also inclined to support the King, such as recent Scottish settlers in the back country; among the more striking examples of this, see [[Flora MacDonald (Scottish Jacobite)|Flora MacDonald]].<ref name="Calhoon, 1992 p. 235"/> After the war, the great majority of the 450,000–500,000 Loyalists remained in America and resumed normal lives. Some, such as [[Samuel Seabury (1729–1796)|Samuel Seabury]], became prominent American leaders. Estimates vary, but about 62,000 Loyalists relocated to Canada, and others to Britain (7,000) or to Florida or the [[West Indies]] (9,000). This made up approximately 2% of the total population of the colonies.<ref name="Pole 1994">Greene and Pole (1994) chapters 20–22</ref> When Loyalists left the [[Southern United States|South]] in 1783, they took thousands of blacks with them as slaves to the British West Indies.<ref name="Pole 1994"/> ===Neutrals=== A minority of uncertain size tried to stay neutral in the war. Most kept a low profile. However, the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], especially in Pennsylvania, were the most important group that was outspoken for neutrality. As Patriots declared independence, the Quakers, who continued to do business with the British, were attacked as supporters of British rule, "contrivers and authors of seditious publications" critical of the revolutionary cause.<ref>Gottlieb 2005</ref> ==Other participants== ===Spain=== Spain did not officially recognize the U.S. but became an informal ally when it declared war on Britain on June 21, 1779. [[Bernardo de Gálvez y Madrid]], general of the Spanish forces in [[New Spain]] who also served as governor of Louisiana was sent to Florida at the head of an expedition of colonial troops to aid the American colonists in their rebellion against Britain <ref>Edward F. Butler, "Spain's Involvement in the American Revolutionary War" ''The SAR Magazine'' Vol. 104 No. 1</ref> The importance of Galvez's campaign from the American perspective was that he denied the British the opportunity of encircling the American rebels from the south, and kept open a vital conduit for supplies.<ref>Thompson, Buchanan Parker, ''Spain: Forgotten Ally of the American Revolution'' North Quincy, Mass.: Christopher Publishing House, 1976.</ref> ===France=== In early 1776, France set up a major program of aid to the Americans, and the Spanish secretly added funds. Each country spent one million "livres tournaises" to buy munitions. A [[dummy corporation]] run by [[Pierre Beaumarchais]] concealed their activities. Americans obtained some munitions through [[Holland]] as well as French and Spanish ports in the [[West Indies]].<ref>Jonathan Dull, ''A Diplomatic History of the American Revolution'' (1985) pp. 57–65</ref> ===Native Americans=== Most [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]] rejected pleas that they remain neutral and supported the King. The tribes that depended most heavily upon colonial trade tended to side with the revolutionaries, though political factors were important as well. The most prominent Native American leader siding with the King was [[Joseph Brant]] of the [[Mohawk nation]], who led frontier raids on isolated settlements in Pennsylvania and [[Province of New York|New York]] until an American army under [[John Sullivan]] secured New York in 1779, forcing the Loyalist Indians into Canada.<ref>Colin G. Calloway, ''The American Revolution in Indian Country: Crisis and Diversity in Native American Communities'' (1995)</ref> The great majority of the 200,000 Native Americans east of the Mississippi distrusted the colonists and supported the British cause.<ref>Greene and Pole (2004) chapters 19, 46 and 51; Colin G. Calloway, ''The American Revolution in Indian Country: Crisis and Diversity in Native American Communities'' (1995)</ref> Even though there was no major Native American participation during the war, the British provided funding and weapons to attack American outposts. Some Indians tried to remain
