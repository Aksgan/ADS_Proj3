The [[Battle of Lake Borgne]] is considered by many Americans to be a heroic failure. The Americans, vastly outnumbered, fought a large British assault on their five [[gunboat]]s, ultimately failing to achieve their objective but not before inflicting considerable damage on the British vessels and crews. U.S. commander [[Thomas ap Catesby Jones]] was later decorated for his bravery during the defense of his squadron. Some heroic failures are reckoned to have acted as a catalyst for a bigger war, in which the losers' aims were finally achieved. Such were for example [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry]], which helped to spark off the US Civil War, ending with the abolition of slavery which was Brown's aim. A similar role in Irish history is given to the [[Easter Rebellion]], which itself failed but helped touch off the eventually successful [[Irish War of Independence]]. The fierce defence of the 1849 [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] by [[Mazzini]] and [[Garibaldi]] was militarily hopeless but created a heroic myth which eventually facilitated the successful [[Unification of Italy]], eleven years later. The battle of [[Alamo]] which was lost by Texas forces became the focus of a heroic myth in American history. A similar role was given to the battle of [[Tel Hai]] in [[Zionist]]-[[Israel]]i myth. The Jewish rebels who embarked on the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] did not expect a victory over the manifestly overwhelming Nazi forces, but rather aimed from the start at a Heroic failure. The film ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' mentions two heroic failures to develop the [[Humphrey Bogart]] character Rick Blaine. <blockquote>'''[[Claude Rains|Captain Louis Renault]]:''' Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to know your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you [[Gunrunning|ran guns]] to [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Ethiopia]]. In 1936, you fought in [[Spanish Civil War|Spain]] on the [[Second Spanish Republic|Loyalist side]].<ref>http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Casablanca.pdf Casablanca script on imsdb.com; accessed 2007-03-01</ref></blockquote> The first reference is to the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]]. In September 1935 [[Italy]] invaded Ethiopia. Ethiopia lost, but opponents of [[colonialism]] and [[fascism]] supported their cause. The second reference describes the [[Spanish Civil War]] in which rebels led by [[Francisco Franco]] gained control of the country. "The Loyalist side" refers to supporters of the losing republic. Thus Rick has fought for the causes of freedom and democracy and earned an admirable (although losing) record. Similarly, while the Nationalist Chinese lost Shanghai (and many of their best troops) to the Japanese in the [[Battle of Shanghai]], the heroic stand by the Chinese showed the world (and the rest of China) that Chiang-Kai-shek's government was making a strong stand against Imperial Japan. Despite being a serious defeat, the Battle of Shanghai was a high mark for Chinese nationalism. Though the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forces of [[Robert E. Lee]] lost the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], much of the Southern United States still widely regards Lee as an icon of Southern heroism and gallantry. The [[Lost Cause]] school of Civil War historiography portrays the Confederacy as heroic and yet doomed to defeat due to the superior resources of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. A similar term, "successful failure", was used to describe the fate of [[Apollo 13]], a mission that failed to land on the Moon due to an equipment failure, and yet resulted in the survival and successful return of the astronauts involved despite difficult circumstances. The [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] in the early 20th century was another such example; having set out to cross [[Antarctica]] on foot, their ship became stuck in Antarctic ice for 22 months. Due to the heroism of expedition leader [[Ernest Shackleton]] and five crew members, who sailed 1500km in a small boat in search of help, not a single life was lost. Heroic failures may be celebrated in a humorous light: * Some cultures have a wry respect for those who persevere at a task despite their lack of skill. Examples of this category include: ** [[Florence Foster Jenkins]] ** [[William Topaz McGonagall]] ** [[Ed Wood]] ** [[William Hung]] ** [[Eddie 'the Eagle' Edwards]] *
