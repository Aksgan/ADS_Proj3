She and her three sisters were raised by their [[Single parent|single mother]]. Since an early age, Donna loved to tinker with things: from taking apart [[doorbell]]s to disassembling [[toaster]]s and other [[Electrical appliance|appliances]]. After graduating from [[high school]], she enrolled in the [[electrical engineering]] and [[computer science]] (EECS) program at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] where she overcame many obstacles to earn her undergraduate Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. She did graduate study in computer science at [[Carnegie-Mellon University]], where she earned her MS degree in 1983.<ref name="first"/><ref name="second"/> ==Career== While conducting research in [[applied science]] and [[artificial intelligence]] at Carnegie-Mellon University, Donna interned at [[Xerox Corporation]]'s [[Palo Alto Research Center]] and met the future founders of [[IntelliCorp]]. Donna was hired by IntelliCorp as a [[software engineer]] in 1986 to work on technology products that incorporated artificial intelligence. After spending four years at IntelliCorp, Donna took a break from work for two months to bike through [[Japan]]'s countryside. Upon her return, Donna was hired by Apple Computer in 1990 to serve as lead [[software engineering]] manager for the Newton PDA development project. While at Apple Computer, Donna was well-liked won praises for her managerial skills as well as technical contributions (she held various [[patent]]s for her work on the Newton PDA).<ref name="first"/><ref name="second"/> In 1996, Donna relocated to [[Boulder, Colorado]] and joined U.S. West Advanced Technologies as senior director of [[multimedia]] [[systems engineering]] and [[Systems development|development]]. While working on [[interactive television]] applications for the company's [[Fiber-optic communication|fiber-optic]] [[broadband]] network, Donna foresaw the potential of the [[internet]] and later launched her own company: Freshwater Software Inc., a provider of software solutions for maintaining and monitoring business-critical [[web application]]s. Freshwater Software grew rapidly from a tiny [[Startup company|start-up]] into a nationally recognized multi-million-dollar software provider which boasted [[Fortune 500]] clients like [[Alta Vista]], [[IBM]], [[Microsoft]], [[Go.com]], and [[Merrill Lynch]]. Freshwater Software was later purchased by Mercury Interactive Corp. of [[California]] for $147 million in 2001.<ref>[http://denver.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/2001/05/21/daily9.html Freshwater Software Sold].

Any networks which interconnect directly and therefore "peer around" the former core [[Tier 1 network]]s avoid those networks. The traffic between those networks therefore can be modeled in a toroidal shape, which then provides the reference to a donut.<ref name=DgoldDonut>{{cite web|url=http://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog27/presentations/golding.pdf|title=Dan Golding's Donut Peering Presentation}}</ref> Inherent to being a Tier 2 Internet provider, is having to pay for IP transit with Tier 1 providers. A way to keep costs down and increase the speed of internet traffic is for Tier 2 networks to peer directly with each other, creating a faster, more-direct path for traffic between the networks to travel. An example of this is to consider the traditional flow of traffic, via Tier 1 providers where there are generally at least 2 networks that the data must traverse in order to get to the final end-user. In the Tier 2 example, based on the Donut Peering model, the Broadband providerâ€™s end-user would access the network Provider by initiating an internet query ([[hop (networking)|hop]] 1), directly peering with the [[content provider]], bypassing the Tier 1 network hand-off and sends the data query directly to the Content provider (hop 2) which delivers it to the end- user. In this example the network connection does not touch the Tier 1 provider network. The data takes a more direct path, with less chance for increased [[packet loss]] or
