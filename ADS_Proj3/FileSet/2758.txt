If the former, that's not how wikimarkup does lists at all. --> Macsyma was written in [[Maclisp]], and was, in some cases, a key motivator for improving that dialect of [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] in the areas of numerical computing, efficient compilation and language design. Maclisp itself ran primarily on [[PDP-10|PDP-6 and PDP-10]] computers, but also on the [[Multics]] [[Operating system|OS]] and on the [[Lisp machine|Lisp Machine]] architectures. Macsyma was one of the largest, if not the largest, Lisp programs of the time. ===Commercialization=== In 1979, in response to a request from Richard Fateman, then a professor at [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]], MIT provided a temporary license for Macsyma code. This was almost immediately brought up on the new [[VAX-11/780]] computer using a dialect of Maclisp, [[Franz Lisp]], written by Fateman's group. MIT reluctantly licensed versions of VAX Macsyma from Berkeley to about 50 universities, starting with Caltech, under condition that the licenses would be revoked when negotiations for a proper license were complete. Indeed this happened when the negotiation with Symbolics (see below) was complete. Symbolics was reluctant to license the VAX product, since VAX constituted competitive hardware to their own Lisp Machines and therefore suppressed the VAX software for five years. UC Berkeley also brought up copies of Macsyma on [[Motorola 68000]]-based systems, most notably [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] workstations. Symbolics suppressed those as well. At the same time Fateman worked to change the (now revoked) temporary license for Macsyma into something more permanent. Ultimately, the [[United States Department of Energy]] imposed on MIT the requirement that they release a copy into the [[National Energy Software Center]] (NESC) library in 1982, while allowing MIT to assert restrictions in terms of high price and no redistribution. This was intended to protect the technology transfer to Symbolics. (Such restrictions have been since lifted, 2002 or so.) This so-called DOE Macsyma had been rewritten at MIT in a pre-[[Common Lisp]] dialect called [[NIL lisp]], incompletely implemented on [[OpenVMS|VAX/VMS]], an unpopular system in academia, where [[Berkeley Software Distribution|Berkeley VAX Unix]] was common. DOE Macsyma formed the basis for the much-later open source Maxima system. In 1981, Moses and Richard Pavelle, an MIT staffer and proponent of applying Macsyma to engineering and science, proposed to form a company to commercialize Macsyma. However, MIT policy prevented MIT personnel from profiting directly from MIT developments. In early 1982, Macsyma was licensed by MIT to [[Arthur D. Little]], Inc., which became the broker for Macsyma and soon licensed Macsyma to [[Symbolics]] in late 1982. It appears that Symbolics was not so much interested in the code as in keeping Macsyma out of the software catalog of its competitor in the Lisp Machine business, [[Lisp Machines|LMI]]. The business arrangement between Symbolics and Arthur D. Little required a royalty payment to ADL of 15% of Macsyma gross sales. This led to speculation on the desire of MIT and ADL to see MACSYMA prosper. The development of Macsyma continued at Symbolics despite the fact that it was seen as a diversion from the sales of [[Lisp machine]]s, which Symbolics considered to be their main business. Macsyma sales and the leveraged sales of Lisp Machines reached 10% of overall sales at Symbolics within two years. Despite resistance from many in Symbolics, Macsyma was released for [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] VAX computers and Sun workstations using Berkeley's [[Franz Lisp]] in 1986 and 1987. However, problems in Symbolics and within the Macsyma group led to the decline of Macsyma. In the first half of 1986, Macsyma revenues were lower than in the first half of 1985, in a growing industry. [[Stephen Wolfram|Wolfram]]'s SMP program and [[Maple (software)|Waterloo Maple]] were growing at this time, although MACSYMA was easily superior to these other packages in symbolic math. Pavelle ran the Macsyma division at Symbolics until early 1986. In the second half of 1986 [[Richard Petti]] became the manager of the Macsyma business. Macsyma cut headcount but expanded its sales force and marketing, and focused its developers more on features that customers asked for. (For example, the Grobner algorithm developed in the 1970s at MIT was not installed in a shipping Macsyma until 1987.) In 1987, Macsyma annual revenues roughly doubled. MACSYMA became more user friendly: documentation and on-line help were reorganized and expanded; some command names were changed to be more mnemonic. Petti argued to Symbolics management that Macsyma was a 'strategic business unit' that should be funded based on its performance and potential, not based on the prospects of the main workstation business. However, Symbolics cut the Macsyma headcount after this period of sharp growth; Symbolics tried to use Macsyma as a tiny cash cow to fund the losses of the workstation business that was 30 times its size. The greatest product weakness of Macsyma was its numerical analysis. Mastering symbolic math was a herculean task; but numerical capabilities were critical to get a piece of the much larger engineering and lower-end scientific markets. At MIT Macsyma had a link to the [[IMSL Numerical Libraries|IMSL]] (now [[Visual Numerics]]) numerical libraries, but this link was severed when Macsyma moved to Symbolics. Lisp developers at Symbolics generally believed that numerical analysis was an old technology that was not important for Lisp applications, so they declined to invest in it. [[Double precision]] arithmetic in Macsyma (on a [[IBM PC compatible|PC]] version) was about six times slower than Fortran. Also Macsyma's matrices were implemented as lists of lists, which cost another factor of perhaps 5-10 in speed for key algorithms. Macsyma did not have many of the basic algorithms of numerical linear algebra, such as [[LU decomposition]]. In 1987-88, the Macsyma group tried to build a PC Macsyma with [[Gold Hill Lisp]]. (Earlier, Symbolics had killed its own project to build a Lisp compiler for standard computers to avoid competing with Lisp machine sales. This was a controversial move that, by some accounts, was undertaken without approval of senior management. Symbolics also declined to cooperate with Sun to make Lisp available on Sun workstations
