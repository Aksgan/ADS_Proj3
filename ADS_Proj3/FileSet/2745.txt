processor. ==History== Apple CEO [[Steve Jobs]] first presented Tiger in his keynote presentation at the Worldwide Developers Conference on 28 June 2004, ten months before its commercial release in April 2005. Four months before that official release, several non-commercial, developer's releases of Tiger leaked onto the Internet via [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] file sharers. Apple sued these file sharers.<ref name="BBC-Tiger-sued">{{cite news|title=Apple sues 'Tiger' file sharers|work=BBC News| pages=|language=|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=2004-12-22|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4117465.stm|accessdate=2007-12-09|location=London}}</ref> On April, 12 2005, Apple announced Tiger's official, worldwide release would be April 29. All [[Apple Store (retail)|Apple Store]]s around the world held Tiger seminars, presentations and demos. On June 6, 2005 at the Worldwide Developers Conference in [[San Francisco]], Jobs reported that nearly two million copies had been sold in Tiger’s first six weeks of release, making it the most successful operating system release in Apple’s history. Jobs then disclosed that Mac OS X had been engineered from its inception to work with [[Intel]]’s [[X86|''x''86]] line of processors in addition to the [[PowerPC]], the CPU for which the operating system had always been publicly marketed. Apple concurrently announced its intent to release the first ''x''86-based computers in June 2006, [[Apple–Intel transition|and to move the rest of its computers to ''x''86 microprocessors]] by June 2007. On January 10, 2006, Apple presented its new [[iMac]] and [[MacBook Pro]] computers running on [[Intel Core|Intel Core Duo]] processors, and announced that the entire Apple product line would run on Intel processors by the end of 2006. Apple then released the [[Mac Pro]] and announced the new [[Xserve]] on August 8, completing the Intel transition in 210 days, roughly ten months ahead of the original schedule. Tiger is the first version of Mac OS X to be supplied on a DVD, although the DVD could originally be exchanged for CDs for $9.95. It is also the first (and so far only) version of Mac OS that would eventually have an update version number ending with a value greater than 9. ==New and changed features== ===End-user features=== Apple advertises that Tiger has 150+ features, including: *'''[[Spotlight (software)|Spotlight]]''' — Spotlight is a full-text and [[metadata (computing)|metadata]] search engine, which can search everything from [[Microsoft Word|Word]] documents to [[iCal]] calendars to [[vCard|Address Book cards]], as well as any text within [[Portable document format|PDF]] files. The feature is also used to build the concept of ''[[virtual folder|smart folders]]'' into the [[Macintosh Finder|Finder]]. Spotlight will index files as they are saved, so they can be quickly and easily found through a search-as-you-type box in the menu bar. As a side-effect, it adds hidden folders and indexing files to removable media like USB flash drives. *'''[[iChat|iChat AV]]''' — The new iChat AV 3.0 in Tiger supports up to four participants in a video conference and ten participants in an audio conference. It also now supports communication using the [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]] protocol. A XMPP server called ''iChat Server'' is included on Mac OS X Tiger Server. *'''[[Safari (web browser)|Safari RSS]]''' — The new Safari 2.0 [[web browser]] in Tiger features a built-in reader for [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] and [[Atom (standard)|Atom]] [[web syndication]] that can be accessed easily from an RSS button in the address bar of the web browser window. An updated version of Safari, included as part of the free Mac OS X v10.4.3 update, can also pass the [[Acid2]] web standards test. *'''[[Mail (application)|Mail 2]]''' — The new version of Mail.app [[email client]] included in Tiger featured an updated interface, "Smart Mailboxes" which utilize the Spotlight search system, parental controls, as well as several other features. [[File:Dashboard_Adding_Widget.png|thumb|right|200px|The Dashboard allows for miniature applications called "Widgets" to appear and disappear rapidly from the screen.]] *'''[[Dashboard (software)|Dashboard]]''' — The Dashboard is a new mini-applications layer based on [[HTML]], [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], and [[JavaScript]], which returns the [[desk accessories]] concept to the Mac OS. These accessories are known as [[Widget (computing)|widget]]s. It comes with several widgets such as Weather, World Clock, Unit Converter, and Dictionary/Thesaurus. More are available for free online. Its similarity to the [[Konfabulator]] application caused some criticism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/macosx-10-4.ars/17|title=Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger|pages=17|author=[[John Siracusa]]|date=28 April 2005|accessdate= 2006-06-11}}</ref> *'''[[Automator (software)|Automator]]''' — A scripting tool called ''Automator'' to link applications together to form complex automated workflows (written in [[AppleScript]], [[Cocoa (software)|Cocoa]], or both). Automator comes with a complete library of actions for several applications that can be used together to make a Workflow. *'''[[VoiceOver]]''' — VoiceOver is an accessibility interface that offers the user magnification options, keyboard control and spoken English descriptions of what is happening on screen. VoiceOver enables users with visual impairment the ability to use applications via spoken commands. It also allows a user to work collaboratively with other users on a single Mac by allowing multiple users give voice commands to scroll text, etc. VoiceOver is capable of reading aloud the contents of files including web pages, mail messages and word processing files. The complete keyboard navigation lets the user control the computer with the keyboard rather than mouse, a menu is displayed in a window showing all the available keyboard commands that can be used. *'''A complete built-in [[Dictionary]]/[[Thesaurus]]''' based on the ''[[New Oxford American Dictionary|New Oxford American Dictionary, Second Edition]]'', accessible through an application, Dictionary, a Dashboard widget, and as a system-wide command (see below). *'''[[.Mac]] syncing''' — Though this is not a new feature, .Mac syncing in Tiger is much improved over Panther. Syncing tasks in Tiger are now accomplished through the .Mac system preferences pane rather than the [[iSync]] application. *'''[[QuickTime]] 7''' — A new version of Apple’s multimedia software has support for the new [[H.264|H.264/AVC]] codec which offers better quality and scalability than other video [[codec]]s. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} This new codec is used by iChat AV for clearer video conferencing. New classes within Cocoa provide full access to QuickTime for Cocoa application developers. The new QuickTime 7 player application bundled with Tiger now includes more advanced audio and video controls as well as a more detailed Information dialog, and the new player has been rebuilt using Apple’s [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa API]] to take advantage of the
