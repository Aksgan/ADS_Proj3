glossary and style decisions section contains details editors and authors need to ensure the publication retains a consistent style and tone. If a spreadsheet is used for an editorial calendar, each section would be a tab. If paper is used to track publication, a page for each section in a file folder with notes about style decisions and glossary might work. Within each section of an editorial calendar, these elements might be tracked: * Story Title * Author * Publication Date * Media Outlet (e.g. Blog, Print Magazine, Email Newsletter) * Theme (or Section) * Priority * Status (e.g. Active or Inactive) There also might be columns to check off whether or not micro-content has been created, for example, story blurbs, sub headings, and search optimized descriptions for HTML links and tags. Or there might be columns to check off whether or not a legal review has been passed, images have been created for the story, or other parts of the actual publishing process. Finally, when using a spreadsheet for an editorial calendar, it is important to use the same column order and titles to track elements across tabs. For example, the first three columns in all tabs of a spreadsheet calendar might be Story Title, Author, and Publication Date. Ordering columns consistently makes it easy to copy and paste rows of entries from one spreadsheet tab to another without having to update the column order on a specific tab. ==Further reading== These resources describe the editorial calendar process in greater detail, as well as additional insights into how editorial calendars can be used effectively. * [http://www.reachcustomersonline.com/2010/08/20/09.16.39/ How to Create an Editorial Calendar to Publish Blogs, Facebook Fan Pages, Twitter, and Email Newsletters] - Exhaustive article on the topic with links to other articles, templates, and additional resources. * [http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/08/30/the-importance-of-consistency-using-editorial-calendars-and-style-guides/ Blogging For Web Designers: Editorial Calendars and Style Guides] - General overview from Smashing Magazine with strong emphasis on style guides * [http://www.contentmarketinginstitute.com/2010/08/content-marketing-editorial-calendar/ How to Put Together an Editorial Calendar for Content Marketing] - Covers editorial calendars from a marketing perspective * [http://www.savvyb2bmarketing.com/blog/entry/572231/save-time-stress-%E2%80%93-blog-editorial-calendar-template Save Time & Stress - Blog Editorial Calendar Template] * [http://aliciafarrell.com/more-than-words/2010/01/creating-an-editorial-calendar-for-a-blog/ Creating an Editorial Calendar for a Blog] * [http://www.andywibbels.com/build-your-blog%E2%80%99s-traffic-with-an-editorial-calendar/ Build Your Blog's Traffic with an Editorial Calendar] * [http://www.doshdosh.com/pattern-your-audience-with-editorial-calendars/ Pattern Your Audience: How Editorial Calendars Can Increase Your Readership] - Ideas about how to group content for regular publication. * [http://www.rodkirby.com/archives/1720 How to Create an Editorial Calendar for Your Blog] - Includes a video that shows how the author uses Google Calendar to track their editorial process. * [http://www.nonprofitmarketingguide.com/blog/2007/03/09/how-to-create-and-use-an-editorial-calendar/ How to Create and Use an Editorial Calendar] - Describes a paper-based method to creating an editorial calendar useful for individuals, small businesses, and small groups that publish content at a low volume.
