the progression of the game. While not accessible in ranked matches, custom matches can make use of user-defined "House Rules". Items which can be tweaked include the turn timer, how resource production works, rules for the thief/robber, and several others. In all types of matches, players can use graphical "ticklers" (or "emotes") to communicate thoughts or feelings, including love or hatred of the dice and/or other players. Similar devices, referred to as "Fooms", were previously available in the Hardwood series of Xbox Live Arcade games. These can be used as an alternative to voice chat (which is supported but not required) in order to, for example, encourage opponents to "sweeten a deal" or warn that they're too close to winning. The ticklers are used by AI players to indicate their "mood" in response to a player's actions; pleasing AIs will influence them to treat the player as an ally (though not to the point of jeopardizing their position), while angering them will serve to focus their negative attention. AI players will react to player-directed emotes towards them as well. == Downloadable content == Less than a week after the title's release, a separate theme pack ("Themes Pack 1") for 150 [[Microsoft Points|points]] ([[US$]]1.87) and picture pack ("Generals Picture Pack 1") for 100 points (US$1.25) were made available for download. On May 31, 2007 a "Mayfair" skin pack (to change the visual representation of the game to the United States version of the board game) was available for 150 points (US$1.87), as well another gamertag picture pack ("Generals Picture Pack 2") for 100 points (US$1.25).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2007/05/30/catan-pictures-and-skin-pack.aspx | title=Catan: Pictures and Skin Pack | publisher=MajorNelson.com | accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref> On June 13, 2007, a "Generals" AI expansion pack was released which added additional computer-controlled opponents, including [[Joan of Arc]], [[Hannibal]], and [[Tokugawa Ieyasu|Tokugawa]].

While those who enjoy slower-paced strategy games will likely find the title a good value, the pace won't appeal to players who demand more action. The user interface has been well received, with the trading interface receiving wide praise, although reviews note several negatives as well, including the title's lack of support for the [[Xbox Live Vision]] camera and the absence of a local multiplayer option. Additionally, the game uses a relatively small text font which may be hard to read on smaller televisions, although the developers have stated that the game uses separate fonts for high-definition and standard-definition displays. Contrary to published critical reviews, however, customer reaction has been strongly positive<ref name="Metacritic - Catan">{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/settlersofcatan?q=catan Metacritic | title=Metacritic - Catan | publisher=Metacritic | accessdate=2007-05-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/164026 | title=Thread: Catan for Xbox 360 out Wednesday | work=Boardgamegeek Forums | accessdate=2007-05-07}}</ref>, with the game debuting third in sales in its first week of availability<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2007/05/05/xbox-live-activity-for-week-of-4-30.aspx | title=Xbox Live's Major Nelson: Xbox Live Activity for week of 4/30 | publisher=MajorNelson.com | accessdate=2007-05-07}}</ref>.

Whereas the [[lambda calculus]] has only one function type ''A â†’ B'', a categorial grammar typically has more.{{Clarify|date=September 2009}}<!-- more what? see talk--> For example, a simple categorial grammar for English might have two function types ''B/A'' and ''A\B'', depending on whether the function takes its argument from the left or the right. Such a grammar would have only two rules: left and right function application. Such a grammar might have three basic categories (''N'',''NP'', and ''S''), putting [[count noun]]s in the category ''N'', [[adjective]]s in the category ''N/N'', [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]]s in the category ''NP/N'', names in the category ''NP'', verb phrases "VP" in the category ''NP\S'', intransitive [[verb]]s, which just function as verb phrases, in the category ''NP\S'', and transitive verbs in the category ''(NP\S)/NP''. Categorial grammars of this form (having only function application rules) are equivalent in generative capacity to [[context-free grammar]] and are thus often considered inadequate for theories of natural language syntax. Unlike CFGs, categorial grammars are [[lexicalized]], meaning that only a small number of (mostly language-independent) rules are employed, and all other syntactic phenomena derive from the lexical entries of specific words. Another appealing aspect of categorial grammars is that it is often easy to assign them a compositional semantics, by first assigning [[interpretation type]]s to all the basic categories, and then associating all the [[derived category|derived categories]] with
