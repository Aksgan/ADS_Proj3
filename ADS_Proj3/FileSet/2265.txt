under heat. # Easily obtainable and has at least one plausible innocent use by the holder. # Not a compound of several chemicals, as this would violate #7. From practical experience "6" and "9" were usually incompatible. [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] agents were trained not to risk their lives through reliance on insecure inks, most of which were of World War I vintage. In general, SOE used invisible inks as a back-up method of communication, for when more secure communication techniques were unavailable. The agency was known to supply special inks to its field agents, rather than have them depend upon improvisation from obtainable everyday chemicals. When agents were forced to improvise, they were to dilute their invisible ink as much as possible to reduce chances of detection.<ref>SOE Syllabus: Lessons in Ungentlemanly Warfare, World War II (Surrey: Public Record Office, 2001)</ref> == Screening letters for secret messages == Any invisible ink can be made visible by someone who is sufficiently determined, but the limitation is generally time available and the fact that one cannot apply hours of effort to every single piece of paper. Thus successful use of invisible ink depends on not arousing suspicion that invisible ink may be present. Telltale signs of invisible ink, such as pen scratches from a sharp pen, roughness or changed reflectivity of the paper (either more dull or more shiny, usually from using undiluted ink) can be obvious to a careful observer who simply makes use of strong light, a magnifying glass and their nose. Also, key words in the visible letter, such as 'red cabbage' or 'heat', in an odd context may alert a censor to the presence of invisible ink. Invisible ink should not be used with glossy or very smooth paper types, since the [[sizing]] of these papers prevents ink from being absorbed deep into the paper and it is easily visible, especially if the paper is examined under glancing light. There are, however, commercially available inks for non-porous surfaces that are only visible under ultraviolet light and are otherwise virtually invisible on such surfaces. Using either ultraviolet light or an iodine fume cupboard, messages can be quickly screened for invisible ink and also read without first permanently developing the invisible ink. Thus, if a censor uses this method to intercept messages, he may then let the letter be sent to the intended recipient who will be unaware that the secret message has already been intercepted by a third party. A "screening station" could theoretically involve visual and olfactory inspection, an examination under ultraviolet light and then the heating of all objects in an oven before finally trying exposure to iodine fumes. In theory, some invisible inks may even show up using a camera sensitive to the [[infrared|infrared light]] spectrum. == Invisible ink types == For practical reasons, the inks are listed here according to their method of development. It must be understood however that some inks - particularly those of organic origin or those consisting of a mixture of several chemicals - may be made visible by several methods. For example, invisible writing with soap water may be made visible either by heat, reaction with phenolphthalein, viewing under ultraviolet light, or by placing the page inside an iodine fume cupboard. === Inks developed by heat === Some of these are organic substances that oxidize when heated, which usually turns them brown. The most secure way to use any of the following substances for invisible ink is by dilution, usually with water, close to the point when they become difficult to develop. * Cola drink * Honey solution * Lemon, apple, orange or onion juice * Milk * Bodily fluids such as urine, semen, saliva or blood [[Blood plasma|serum]]. * Soap water * Sugar solution * Wine, or vinegar * [[Cobalt(II) chloride|Cobalt chloride]], which turns blue when heated and becomes invisible again after a while (if not overly heated) The writing is rendered visible by [[heating]] the paper, either on a [[radiator]], by [[ironing]] it, or by placing it in an [[oven]]. A 100-watt [[light bulb]] is less likely to damage the paper. === Inks developed by chemical reaction === In most cases, the substance changes color when mixed with an [[acid]] or [[base (chemistry)|base]]. * [[Phenolphthalein]], commonly used as a [[pH]] indicator, turns pink in the presence of a base such as [[ammonia|ammonia fumes]] or [[sodium carbonate]]. * [[Vinegar]], is revealed by [http://chemistry.about.com/library/weekly/aa012803a.htm red cabbage water]. Vinegar contains [[acetic acid]] that affects the pH indicator in red cabbage water. Vinegar may also be developed by heat, as above. * [[Ammonia]], developed by red cabbage water. * [[Copper sulfate]], developed by [[sodium iodide]], [[sodium carbonate]] [[ammonium hydroxide]] or [[potassium ferricyanide]]. * [[Lead(II) nitrate]], developed by [[sodium iodide]]. * [[Iron sulfate]], developed by [[sodium carbonate]] or [[potassium ferricyanate]]. * [[Cobalt(II) chloride|Cobalt chloride]], developed by [[potassium ferricyanide]]. * [[Iron sulfate]], developed by [[sodium sulfide]]. * [[Starch]], developed by [[iodine]] solution which turns starch dark blue and the paper light blue. * [[lemon|Lemon juice]], developed by [[iodine]] solution (ink turns white, paper turns light blue). * [[Sodium chloride]] (common table salt), developed by [[silver nitrate]]. === Inks visible under ultraviolet light === Some inks glow faintly ([[fluorescence|fluoresce]]) when under an [[ultraviolet]] lamp. This is a property of many substances, particularly organic substances and body fluids. Other inks work in a near opposite way by ''absorbing'' ultraviolet light but without fluoresceing. When these are used on [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] paper, the inked areas fluoresce less than the surrounding paper area when under an ultraviolet lamp. This is especially a property of inks with a yellow tint. Some UV-visible inks may be detected on a photocopy, due to the relatively strong ultraviolet component in light from the photocopier scanning head. Examples of inks revealed by ultraviolet light are: * [[laundry detergent]]s containing [[optical brightener]]s. * [[soap]]. * Body fluids, such as [[semen]], [[Blood plasma|serum]], [[saliva]], [[milk]]. === Inks which disturb the surface of paper === This includes virtually all invisible inks, but pure distilled water can also be
