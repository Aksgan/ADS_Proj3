which transaction, and a cycle means a deadlock. Aborting one transaction per cycle is sufficient to break the cycle. Transactions aborted due to deadlock resolution are executed again immediately. In a distributed environment an [[atomic commitment]] protocol, typically the [[Two-phase commit]] (2PC) protocol, is utilized for [[Atomicity (database systems)|atomicity]]. When recoverable data (data under transaction control) are partitioned among 2PC participants (i.e., each data object is controlled by a single 2PC participant), then distributed (global) deadlocks, deadlocks involving two or more participants in 2PC, are resolved automatically: When SS2PL is effectively utilized in a distributed environment, then global deadlocks due to locking generate voting-deadlocks in 2PC, and are resolved automatically by 2PC (see [[Commitment ordering]] (CO), in [[Commitment ordering#Exact characterization of voting-deadlocks by global cycles|Exact characterization of voting-deadlocks by global cycles]]; No reference except the CO articles is known to notice this). For the general case of 2PL, global deadlocks are similarly resolved automatically by the [[Synchronization (computer science)#Process synchronization|synchronization point]] protocol of phase-1 end in a distributed transaction (synchronization point is achieved by "voting" (notifying local phase-1 end), and being propagated to the participants in a distributed transaction the same way as a decision point in atomic commitment; in analogy to decision point in CO, a conflicting operation in 2PL cannot happen before phase-1 end synchronization point, with the same resulting voting-deadlock in the case of a global data-access deadlock; the voting-deadlock (which is also a locking based global deadlock) is automatically resolved by the protocol aborting some transaction involved, with a missing vote, typically using a [[Timeout (telecommunication)|timeout]]). '''Comment''': :When data are partitioned among the ''[[atomic commitment]] protocol'' (e.g., 2PC) participants, automatic ''global deadlock'' resolution has been overlooked in the database research literature, though deadlocks in such systems has been a quite intensive research area: ::*For CO and its special case SS2PL, the automatic resolution by the ''atomic commitment protocol'' has been noticed only in the CO articles. However, it has been noticed in practice that in many cases global deadlocks are very infrequently detected by the dedicated resolution mechanisms, less that could be expected ("Why do we see so few global deadlocks?"). The reason is probably the deadlocks that are automatically resolved and thus not handled and uncounted by the mechanisms; ::*For 2PL in general, the automatic resolution by the (mandatory) ''end-of-phase-one synchronization point protocol'' (which has same voting mechanism as atomic commitment protocol, and same missing vote handling upon voting deadlock, resulting in global deadlock resolution) has not been mentioned until today (2009). Practically only the special case SS2PL is utilized, where no end-of-phase-one synchronization is needed in addition to atomic commit protocol. :In a distributed environment where recoverable data are not partitioned among atomic commitment protocol participants, no such automatic resolution exists, and [[Deadlock#Distributed deadlock|distributed deadlocks]] need to be resolved by dedicated techniques. ==See also== *[[Serializability]] *[[Lock (computer science)]] ==References== *<cite id=Bern1987>[[Phil Bernstein|Philip A.

V. Quine]]'s paper '''''Two Dogmas of Empiricism''''', published in 1951, is one of the most celebrated papers of [[20th century philosophy|twentieth century philosophy]] in the [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] tradition. According to [[Harvard University|Harvard]] professor of philosophy [[Peter Godfrey-Smith]], this "paper [is] sometimes regarded as the most important in all of twentieth-century philosophy".<ref>[[Peter Godfrey-Smith]], ''Theory and Reality'', 2003, [[University of Chicago]], ISBN 0-226-30062-5, pages 30-33 (section 2.4 "Problems and Changes")</ref> The paper is an attack on two central parts of the [[logical positivism|logical positivists']] philosophy. One is the [[analytic-synthetic distinction]] between [[analytic proposition|analytic]] [[truth]]s and [[Synthetic proposition|synthetic]] truths, explained by Quine as truths grounded only in meanings and independent of facts, and truths grounded in facts. The other is [[reductionism]], the theory that each meaningful statement gets its [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] from some [[logic]]al construction of terms that refers exclusively to immediate experience. "Two Dogmas" is divided into six sections. The first four sections are focused on analyticity, the last two sections on reductionism. There, Quine turns the focus to the logical positivists' theory of meaning. He also presents his own [[holism|holistic]] theory of meaning. ==Analyticity and circularity== Most of Quine's argument against analyticity in the first four sections is focused on
