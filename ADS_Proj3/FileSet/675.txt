Prior to his current employment, he spent five years working for the [[National Security Agency]]. Miller demonstrated his hacks publicly on products manufactured by [[Apple Computer|Apple]]. In 2008 he won a $10,000 cash prize at the hacker conference [[Pwn2Own]] in [[Vancouver]] Canada for being the first to find a critical bug in the ultrathin [[MacBook Air]]—deploying an exploit in 2 minutes. The next year, he won $5,000 for cracking [[Safari_(web_browser)|Safari]] in under 10 seconds. In 2009 he also demonstrated an SMS processing vulnerability that allowed for complete compromise of the Apple [[iPhone]] and denial-of-service attacks on other phones. He holds a Ph.D. in mathematics from the [[University of Notre Dame]]. {{Portal|Computer security}} == External links == * [http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2010/0412/technology-apple-hackers-charlie-miller.html The Mac Hacker Strikes Again] * [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no11eIx0x6w Short video report from CanSecWest in Vancouver about MacBook Air Hack] * [http://cansecwest.com CanSecWest Conference Homepage] * [http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/industry/4286458.html?page=4 From: The Internet's Top 10 Most Controversial Figures of 2008] * [http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-10318972-245.html?part=rss&tag=feed&subj=News-Security Researchers who hack the Mac OS] * [http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/pwn2own-mac-hack,2254.html Tom's Hardware - Behind Pwn2Own: Exclusive Interview With Charlie Miller] {{DEFAULTSORT:Miller, Charlie}} [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:University of Notre Dame alumni]] [[Category:People associated with computer security]]</text> </page> <page> <id>5946</id> <title>Charlotte Froese Fischer</title> <text>[[Image:Cff.jpg|thumb|right]] Acad. Prof. Dr. '''Charlotte Froese Fischer''' PhD (b. 1929) is a Canadian-American applied mathematician and computer scientist who gained world recognition for the development and implementation of the Multi-configurational Hartree-Fock ([[MCHF]]) approach to atomic structure calculations and for her theoretical prediction concerning the existence of the negative calcium ion ([[Physical Review Letters]], vol. 59, pp. 2263-2266, 1987). For this last honor, she was elected to fellowship in the [[American Physical Society]]. <!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Charlotte-Froese-Fischer.png|thumb|400px|right|Charlotte Froese Fischer working with the EDSAC]] --> ==Early life== Charlotte Froese Fischer was born on September 21, 1929 in [[Nikolayevka]], [[Ukraine]] to parents of [[Mennonite]] descent. Her parents immigrated to [[Germany]] on the last train allowed to cross the border before its closure by [[Soviet]] authorities. After a few months in a [[refugee camp]], her family was allowed to immigrate to [[Canada]], where they eventually established themselves in [[Chilliwack, British Columbia|Chilliwack]], [[British Columbia]]. ==Education and research== She obtained both a B.A. degree, with honors in Mathematics and Chemistry, and an M.A. degree in Applied Mathematics from the [[University of British Columbia]] in 1952 and 1954, respectively. She then obtained her Ph.D. in applied mathematics and computing at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in 1957 pursuing coursework in quantum theory with [[P.A.M. Dirac]] and working under the supervision of [[Douglas Hartree]], whom she assisted in programming the first Electronic Digital Stored program Automatic Computer ([[EDSAC]]) for atomic structure calculations. She served on the mathematics faculty of the University of British Columbia from 1957 - 68 where she introduced numerical analysis and computer courses into the curriculum and was instrumental in the formation of the Computer Science Department. The years 1963 - 64 were spent by Froese Fischer at the [[Harvard College Observatory]], where she extended her research on atomic structure calculations. While at [[Harvard]], she was the first woman scientist to be awarded an [[Alfred P. Sloan]] Fellowship. Since then she has become internationally known for her software for atomic structure calculations and her research in atomic structure theory. In 1991 she became a Fellow of the [[American Physical Society]], in part for her contribution to the discovery of negative calcium. In 1995 she was elected a member of the Royal Physiographical Society of Lund and in 2004, as a foreign member of the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences. ==Contributions== She is the author of over 260 research articles on computational atomic theory, many of which became citation classics for their far-reaching impact in the area of atomic structure calculations. One of her largest efforts in the field is the recent calculation, in collaboration with [[Georgio Tachiev]] and [[Andrei Irimia]], of the complete lower spectra of the [[beryllium]]-like to [[argon]]-like isoelectronic sequences, amounting to the publication of data covering 400 journal pages and a total of over 150 ions (C Froese Fischer, G Tachiev (2004) Atomic Data Nucl Data Tables vol 87 pp 1-184 and C Froese Fischer, G Tachiev, A Irimia (2006) Atomic Data Nucl Data Tables vol 92 607-812) She is currently an emerita research professor of computer science at [[Vanderbilt University]] and a guest scientist of the Atomic Spectroscopy Laboratory at [[NIST]]. ==External links== *[http://www.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/~cff/cff.html Personal web page, includes all her scientific work: results, publications, software, etc...] *[http://www.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/~cff/Reminiscence_CFF.pdf Reminiscences at the end of the century: Biography of herself and a short biography of Douglas Hartree] *[http://physics.nist.gov/Divisions/Div842/Gp1/Staff/fischer.html Page of Charlotte Froese Fischer on the NIST website] {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME = Froese Fischer, Charlotte | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH = | PLACE OF BIRTH = | DATE OF DEATH = | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Froese Fischer, Charlotte}} [[Category:1929 births]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:Canadian computer scientists]] [[Category:Canadian physicists]] [[Category:Canadian chemists]] [[Category:Canadian mathematicians|Froese]] [[Category:Theoretical chemists]] [[Category:Academics in
