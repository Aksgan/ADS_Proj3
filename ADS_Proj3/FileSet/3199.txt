Due to possible impacts, the velocities of the mechanical system are even allowed to undergo jumps at certain time instants in order to fulfill the kinematical restrictions. Consider for example a rigid model of a ball which falls on the ground. Just before the impact between ball and ground, the ball has non-vanishing pre-impact velocity. At the impact time instant, the velocity must jump to a post-impact velocity which is at least zero, as else penetration would occur. Non-smooth mechanical models are often used in [[contact dynamics]]. == See also== *[[Contact dynamics]] *[[Unilateral contact]] ==References== {{Unreferenced|date=May 2008}} == Further reading == *Acary V., Brogliato, B.

The '''standard model of arithmetic''' consists of the set of standard natural numbers {0, 1, 2, …}. The elements of any model of Peano arithmetic are linearly ordered and possess an initial segment isomorphic to the standard natural numbers. A nonstandard model is one that has additional elements outside this initial segment. The existence of such models is due to [[Thoralf Skolem]] (1934). == Existence == There are several methods that can be used to prove the existence of non-standard models of arithmetic. === From the compactness theorem === The existence of non-standard models of arithmetic can be demonstrated by an application of the [[compactness theorem]]. To do this, a set of axioms P* is defined in a language including the language of Peano arithmetic together with a new constant symbol ''x''. The axioms consist of the axioms of Peano arithmetic P together with another infinite set of axioms: for each numeral ''n'', the axiom ''x'' > ''n'' is included. Any finite
