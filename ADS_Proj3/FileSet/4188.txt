The files are named by appending ''aa'', ''ab'', ''ac'', etc. to ''output filename''. If ''output filename'' is not given, the default filename of ''x'' is used, for example, ''xaa'', ''xab'', etc. When a hyphen (''-'') is used instead of ''input filename'', data is derived from [[standard input]]. To join the files back together again use the [[Cat (Unix)|<tt>cat</tt>]] command <source lang="bash"> cat xaa xab xac > filename </source> or <source lang="bash"> cat xa[a-c] > filename </source> Additional program options permit a maximum character count (instead of a line count), a maximum line length, how many incrementing characters in generated filenames, and whether to use letters or digits. ==Manual== *{{man|1|split||split a file into pieces}} {{unix-stub}} [[Category:Standard Unix programs]] [[Category:Unix SUS2008 utilities]] {{Unix commands}} [[el:Split (Unix)]] [[es:Split (Unix)]] [[fa:Split]] [[ko:Split (유닉스)]] [[it:Split (Unix)]] [[hu:Split (Unix)]] [[ja:Split]] [[pl:Split (Unix)]] [[pt:Split (Unix)]] [[ro:Split (Unix)]] [[ru:Split]] [[uk:Split]]</text> </page> <page> <id>35392</id> <title>Split (phylogenetics)</title> <text>[[File:Heterobranchia tree.png|thumb|Graph of [[neighbor-joining]] [[phylogenetic tree]] shows a clear split support (visualised by long parallel edges) for [[Acochlidiacea]] (in red color).

Moreover, when given several trees, the splits occurring in more than half of these trees give rise to a consensus tree, and the splits occurring in a smaller fraction of the trees generally give rise to a consensus [[Phylogenetic network|Split Network]]. == See also == [[SplitsTree]], a program for inferring phylogenetic (split) networks. == References == {{reflist}} [[Category:Phylogenetics]] [[Category:Trees (structure)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>35393</id> <title>Split Up (Decision Support System)</title> <text>{{orphan|date=December 2009}} {{Wikify|date=December 2009}} '''Split Up''' is an intelligent [[decision support system]], which makes predictions about the distribution of marital property following divorce in Australia. It is designed to assist [[judge]]s, registrars of the Family Court of Australia, [[mediation|mediators]] and [[lawyers]]. Split Up operates as a hybrid system, combining rule – based reasoning with [[neural network]] theory.<ref>Stranieri, A. and Zeleznikow, J., Split_Up: The use of an argument based knowledge representation to meet expectations of different users for [[discretion]]ary decision making,p.1 Research has shown that rule-based reasoning on its own is not ideal in discretionary fields of law.</ref> Rule based reasoning operates within strict parameters, in the form: IF < condition(s) > then <action>.<ref>Stranieri, A. and Zeleznikow, J., Split Up: An Intelligent Decision Support System Which Provides Advice Upon Property Division Following Divorce, International Journal of Law and Information Technology, Vol 6. No. 2, 1998, 190 – 213, p. 196 , p. 202</ref> Neural networks, by contrast, are considered to be better suited to generate decisions in uncertain domains, since they can be taught to weigh the factors considered by judicial decision makers from case data. Yet, they do not provide an explanation for the conclusions they reach. Split_up, with a view to overcome this flaw, uses argument structures proposed by [[Stephen Toulmin|Toulmin]] as the basis for representations from which [[explanation]]s can be generated.<ref>Stranieri,A. and Zeleznikow, J., The Split Up system: integrating neural network and rule based reasoning in the legal domain,p. 186</ref> ==Application== In Australian family law, a judge in determining the distribution of property will: 1. ''identify the assets of the marriage included in the common pool'' 2. ''establish what percentage of the common pool each party will receive'' 3. ''determine a final property order in line with the decisions made in 1. and 2.'' Split_Up implements step 1 and 2 : the common pool determination and the prediction of a percentage split. ====The common pool determination==== Since the determination of marital property is rule based, it is implemented using [[directed graph]]s.

Broadly, the contributions can be taken as financial or non-financial. The party who can demonstrate a larger contribution to the marital relationship will receive a larger proportion of the assets. The court may further look at each party's financial resources and future needs under section 75(2)of the [[Family Law Act 1975]]. These needs can include factors such as the inability to gain employment, the continued care of a child under 18 years of age or medical expenses. This means that different judges may and will reach different conclusions based on the same facts, since each judge assigns different relevant weights to each factor. Split_up determines the percentage split by using a combination of rule- based reasoning and [[neural networks]]. ====The percentage split determination==== In order to determine how judges weigh the different factors, 103 written judgements of commonplace cases were used to establish a database comprising 94 relevant factors for percentage split determination.<ref>ibid, p.273</ref> [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MiamiCaptionURL&_method=retrieve&_udi=B6V8S-42YFB2T-8&_image=fig3&_ba=3&_user=809099&_rdoc=1&_fmt=full&_orig=search&_cdi=5878&view=c&_acct=C000043939&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=809099&md5=71f056a7a20f64dbb357be6c7feb60e9 Figure 2: Hierarchy of relevant factors for percentage split determination] <ref>ibid, p. 271</ref> Figure 2 demonstrates that the factors relevant for a percentage split determination are: -''Past contributions of a husband relative to those of a wife'' -''The
