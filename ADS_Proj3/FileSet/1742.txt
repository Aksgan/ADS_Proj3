space ''X''. ;[[Tychonoff space|Tychonoff]]: A [[Tychonoff space]] (or '''completely regular Hausdorff''' space, '''completely T<sub>3</sub>''' space, '''T<sub>3.5</sub>''' space) is a completely regular T<sub>0</sub> space. (A completely regular space is Hausdorff [[if and only if]] it is T<sub>0</sub>, so the terminology is consistent.) Every Tychonoff space is regular Hausdorff. == U == ;Ultra-connected: A space is ultra-connected if no two non-empty closed sets are disjoint. Every ultra-connected space is path-connected. ;Ultrametric: A metric is an ultrametric if it satisfies the following stronger version of the triangle inequality: for all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in ''M'', ''d''(''x'', ''z'') ≤ max(''d''(''x'', ''y''), ''d''(''y'', ''z'')). ;[[Uniform isomorphism]]: If ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[uniform space]]s, a uniform isomorphism from ''X'' to ''Y'' is a bijective function ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' such that ''f'' and ''f''<sup>&minus;1</sup> are [[uniformly continuous]]. The spaces are then said to be uniformly isomorphic and share the same [[uniform properties]]. ;[[Uniformizable]]/Uniformisable: A space is uniformizable if it is homeomorphic to a uniform space. ;[[Uniform space]]: A [[uniform space]] is a set ''U'' equipped with a nonempty collection Φ of subsets of the [[Cartesian product]] ''X'' &times; ''X'' satisfying the following [[axiom]]s: :# if ''U'' is in Φ, then ''U'' contains { (''x'', ''x'') | ''x'' in ''X'' }. :# if ''U'' is in Φ, then { (''y'', ''x'') | (''x'', ''y'') in ''U'' } is also in Φ :# if ''U'' is in Φ and ''V'' is a subset of ''X'' &times; ''X'' which contains ''U'', then ''V'' is in Φ :# if ''U'' and ''V'' are in Φ, then ''U'' ∩ ''V'' is in Φ :# if ''U'' is in Φ, then there exists ''V'' in Φ such that, whenever (''x'', ''y'') and (''y'', ''z'') are in ''V'', then (''x'', ''z'') is in ''U''. :The elements of Φ are called '''entourages''', and Φ itself is called a '''uniform structure''' on ''U''. ;Uniform structure: See '''[[Uniform space]]'''. == W == ; [[Weak topology]]: The [[weak topology]] on a set, with respect to a collection of functions from that set into topological spaces, is the coarsest topology on the set which makes all the functions continuous. ; Weaker topology: See '''[[Coarser topology]]'''. Beware, some authors, especially [[mathematical analysis|analyst]]s, use the term '''stronger topology'''. ; Weakly countably compact: A space is weakly countably compact (or '''limit point compact''') if every [[infinite]] subset has a limit point. ; Weakly hereditary: A property of spaces is said to be weakly hereditary if whenever a space has that property, then so does every closed subspace of it. For example, compactness and the Lindelöf property are both weakly hereditary properties, although neither is hereditary. ; Weight: The [[weight of a space]] ''X'' is the smallest [[cardinal number]] κ such that ''X'' has a base of cardinal κ. (Note that such a cardinal number exists, because the entire topology forms a base, and because the class of cardinal numbers is [[well order|well-ordered]].) ; Well-connected: See '''Ultra-connected'''. (Some authors use this term strictly for ultra-connected compact spaces.) == Z == ;Zero-dimensional: A space is [[zero-dimensional]] if it has a base of clopen sets. ==External links== * [http://math.berkeley.edu/~apollo/topodefs.ps A glossary of definitions in topology] {{DEFAULTSORT:Glossary Of Topology}} [[Category:Properties of topological spaces]] [[Category:Glossaries on mathematics|Topology]] [[Category:Topology| ]] [[Category:General topology| ]] [[de:Topologie-Glossar]] [[es:Glosario de topología]] [[fr:Glossaire topologique]] [[ru:Словарь терминов общей топологии]] [[zh:拓撲學術語]]</text> </page> <page> <id>15430</id> <title>Glue language</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=March 2007}} A '''glue language''' is a [[programming language]] (usually a [[scripting language]]) used for connecting [[software component]]s together. Examples of glue languages: * [[Unix]] [[Shell script]]s ([[ksh]], [[csh]], [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]], [[Bourne shell|sh]] and others) * [[Windows NT]] type Shell scripts ([[CMD.exe]]) * Windows [[PowerShell]] * MS-DOS and Windows 95 type [[Batch files]] ([[Command.com]])]; usefulness as glue language enhanced by [[QBasic]] and [[DOSKey]] * OS/2 batch files and shell scripts * [[Kixtart]] * [[4NT]] * [[4DOS]] * [[4OS/2]] * [[Take Command (command line interpreter)|Take Command]] * [[Norton Utilities]] [[NDOS]] (a [[4DOS]] variant) * [[DCL]] * [[JCL]] * [[m4 (computer language)|m4]] * [[VBScript]] * [[JScript]] and [[JavaScript]] * [[AppleScript]] * [[Python (programming language)|Python]] * [[Ruby programming language|Ruby]] * [[Lua programming language|Lua]] * [[Tcl]] * [[Perl]] * [[PHP]] * [[Pure (programming language)|Pure]] * [[REXX]] * [[XSLT]] * Operating system desktop macro languages such as the Windows 3.11 Macro Recorder and various tools for Windows CE versions and implementations. Extended [[macro]] languages which are exposed to operating system components and those of other programmes including [[Visual Basic for Applications]], [[WordBasic]], [[LotusScript]], [[CorelScript]], [[PerfectScript]], Hummingbird Basic and QuickScript, [[SaxBasic]] and [[WinWrap Basic]] as well as other tools like [[awk]] can also be considered glue languages, as can any language implemented by an [[ActiveX]] WSH engine (VBScript, JScript and VBA by default in Windows and third-party engines including implementations of Rexx, Perl, Tcl, Python, XSLT, Ruby, Delphi, &c) A majority of applications can access and use operating system components via the [[object model]]s or its own functions. Other devices like programmable calculators may also have glue languages; for example the [[TI-92]] by factory default can be programmed by a Command Script language and a Basic variant known as [[TI-Basic]], and the [[HP-48]] series as well as all other HP calculators can be programmed in multiple on-board languages. Most scientific and other advanced calculators can be programmed, with keystroke macros and derivatives of Basic predominating and others inlcluding languages based on [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[assembly language]]; some programmers are working to implement some of the above glue languages such as Perl, Rexx, WInNT shell, Unix shell, DOS-Win95-OS/2 batch and others.
