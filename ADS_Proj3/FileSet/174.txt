Beginning in 1777, Congress repeatedly asked the states to provide money. But the states had no system of taxation either, and were little help. By 1780 Congress was making requisitions for specific supplies of corn, beef, pork and other necessities—an inefficient system that kept the army barely alive.<ref>Erna Risch, ''Supplying Washington's Army'' (1982)</ref><ref>E. Wayne Carp, ''To Starve the Army at Pleasure: Continental Army Administration and American Political Culture, 1775-1783'' (1990)</ref> Starting in 1776, the Congress sought to raise money by loans from wealthy individuals, promising to redeem the bonds after the war. The bonds were in fact redeemed and 1791 at face value, but the scheme raised little money because Americans had little specie, and many of the rich merchants were supporters of the Crown. Starting in 1776, the French secretly supplied the Americans with money, gunpowder, and munitions in order to weaken its arch enemy, Great Britain. When France officially entered the war in 1778, the subsidies continued, and the French government, as well as bankers in Paris and Amsterdam loaned large sums to the American war effort. These loans were repaid in full in the 1790s.<ref>E.

In all thirteen colonies, Patriots had overthrown their existing governments, closing courts and driving British governors, agents and supporters from their homes. They had elected conventions and "legislatures" that existed outside of any legal framework; new constitutions were used in each state to supersede royal charters. They declared they were states now, not colonies.<ref name = "Pole-ch29">Nevins (1927); Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 29</ref> On January 5, 1776, [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] ratified the first state constitution, six months before the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Then, in May 1776, Congress voted to suppress all forms of crown authority, to be replaced by locally created authority. Virginia, [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]], and New Jersey created their constitutions before July 4. [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] and [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]] simply took their existing [[royal charter]]s and deleted all references to the crown.<ref>Nevins (1927)</ref> The new states had to decide not only what form of government to create, they first had to decide how to select those who would craft the constitutions and how the resulting document would be ratified. In states where the wealthy exerted firm control over the process, such as [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]], Virginia, [[Delaware Colony|Delaware]], New York and Massachusetts, the results were constitutions that featured: * Substantial property qualifications for voting and even more substantial requirements for elected positions (though New York and Maryland lowered property qualifications);<ref name = "Pole-ch29"/> * [[Bicameral legislature]]s, with the upper house as a check on the lower; * Strong [[governor]]s, with veto power over the legislature and substantial appointment authority; * Few or no restraints on individuals holding multiple positions in government; * The continuation of [[Established church|state-established religion]]. [[File:Benjamin Rush Painting by Peale 1783.jpg|thumb|alt=Benjamin Rush, 1783|[[Benjamin Rush]], 1783]] In states where the less affluent had organized sufficiently to have significant power—especially Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New Hampshire—the resulting constitutions embodied * universal white manhood suffrage, or minimal property requirements for voting or holding office (New Jersey enfranchised some property owning widows, a step that it retracted 25 years later); * strong, [[Unicameralism|unicameral legislatures]]; * relatively weak governors, without veto powers, and little appointing authority; * prohibition against individuals holding multiple government posts; Whether conservatives or radicals held sway in a state did not mean that the side with less power accepted the result quietly. The radical provisions of Pennsylvania's constitution lasted only fourteen years. In 1790, conservatives gained power in the state legislature, called a new constitutional convention, and rewrote the constitution. The new constitution substantially reduced universal white-male suffrage, gave the governor veto power and patronage appointment authority, and added an upper house with substantial wealth qualifications to the unicameral legislature. Thomas Paine called it a constitution unworthy of America.<ref name="Wood, 1992"/> ==Independence and Union== [[File:Johannes Adam Simon Oertel Pulling Down the Statue of King George III, N.Y.C. ca. 1859.jpg|thumb|alt=Johannes Adam Simon Oertel.

[[Richard Henry Lee]] was instructed by the Virginia legislature to propose independence, and he did so on June 7, 1776. On the 11th a committee was created to draft a document explaining the justifications for separation from Britain. After
