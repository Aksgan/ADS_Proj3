the [[IBM 1401]]. After running it, the computer operator would return the card deck and any hardcopy printed output, typically to one of a set of alphabetically-labelled cubby holes, based on the programmer's last initial. [[Image:IBM1620SPSpunchcard.agr.jpg|thumb|left|Card formated for IBM 1620 [[assembly language]].]] Overnight and 24 hour turnaround times were not uncommon; however, on a lightly-used system, it was possible to make alterations and rerun a program in a few minutes. Between these extremes it was common to stand in line waiting to submit a deck. Dedicated programmers might stay up all hours to get a few quick turnarounds. Using this expensive equipment—mainframe computer usage was measured in seconds per job — was often charged to a user's account. Other operations, such as those using smaller computers like the [[IBM 650]], [[IBM 1620|1620]] and [[IBM 1130|1130]], were run as an '''open shop''', where programmers had use of the computer for a block of time. A keypunch was usually located nearby for quick corrections. This was all batch-mode processing, as opposed to interactive processing. {{clear}} ==References== *[[Unit record equipment#Unit record equipment in the computer age|Unit record equipment in the computer age]] *{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/fisk.pdf |title=Programming With Punched Cards:<br> A Programmer's Memories of Learning the Craft in 1973 |first=Dale |last=Fisk |year = Setting 1973; Written 2005 |accessdate = 2008-11-11 }} <br> Article about the programming culture that developed around use of the punched card, following Fisk's experience of "learning the craft" from people around him.

The main emphasis of the [[interdisciplinarity]] is placed on the application and use of computer-based but also mathematical techniques in sport science, aiming in this way at the support and advancement of theory and practice in sports.<ref>{{cite web|author=Daniel Link & Martin Lames|title=Sport Informatics – Historical Roots, Interdisciplinarity and Future Developments|year=2009}} IJCSS Volume 8 Edition 2, 68-87.</ref> The reason why [[computer science]] has become an important partner for sport science is mainly connected with “the fact that the use of data and media, the design of models, the analysis of systems etc. increasingly requires the support of suitable tools and concepts which are developed and available in computer science”.<ref>{{cite web|author=Arnold Baca|title=Computer science in sport: an overview of history, present fields and future applications (part I)|year=2006}} IJCSS Special Edition 2/2006, 25-35.</ref> [[:de:Sportinformatik]] == Historical background == Going back in history, computers in sports were used for the first time in the 1960s, when the main purpose was to accumulate sports information. [[Database]]s were created and expanded in order to launch documentation and dissemination of publications like articles or books that contain any kind of knowledge related to sports science. Until the mid 1970s also the first organization in this area called IASI (International Association for Sports Information) was formally established. Congresses and meetings were organized more often with the aim of standardization and rationalization of sports documentation. Since at that time this area was obviously less computer-oriented, specialists talk about sports information rather than sports informatics when mentioning the beginning of this field of science. Based on the progress of computer science and the invention of more powerful computer hardware in the 1970s, also the real history of computer science in sport began.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jürgen Perl|title=Computer science in sport: an overview of history, present fields and future applications (part II)|year=2006}} IJCSS Special Edition 2/2006, 36-46.</ref> This was as well the first time when this term was officially used and the initiation of a very important evolution in sports science. In the early stages of this area statistics on biomechanical data, like different kinds of forces or rates, played a major role. Scientists started to analyze sports games by collecting and looking at such values and features in order to interpret them. Later on, with the continuous improvement of computer hardware - in particular microprocessor speed – many new scientific and computing paradigms were introduced, which were also integrated in computer science in sport. Specific examples are [[Computer model|modelling]] as well as [[simulation]], but also [[pattern recognition]] and design. As another result of this development, the term 'computer science in sport' has been added in the encyclopedia of sports science in 2004. == Areas of research == The importance and strong influence of computer science as an interdisciplinary partner for sport and sport science is mainly proven by the research activities in computer science in sport. The following IT concepts are thereby of particular interest: * [[Data acquisition]] and [[data processing]] * Databases and [[expert system]]s * Modelling (mathematical, IT based, biomechanical, physiological) * Simulation (interactive, animation etc.) * Presentation Based on the fields from above, the main areas of research in computer science in sport include amongst others: * [[Training]] and coaching * [[Biomechanics]] * [[Sports equipment]] and technology * Computer-aided applications (software, hardware) in sports * [[Ubiquitous computing]] in sports * [[Multimedia]] and [[Internet]] * Documentation * Education == Research communities == A clear demonstration for the evolution and propagation towards computer science in sport is also the fact that nowadays people do research in this area all over the world. Since the 1990s many new national and international organizations regarding the topic of computer science in sport were established. These associations are regularly organizing congresses and workshops
