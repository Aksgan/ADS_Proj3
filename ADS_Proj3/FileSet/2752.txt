Hyper Stealth Robo's special attack is '''Burst Tempest'''. ===Transporters=== ; TMR-01WL Wing Liner Pilots: Rin Haruka, Kai Kitazawa The transport unit of the Red Wings. It carries Fire Robo and the Aider Robos to their chosen destinations. It resembles a giant monorail train in Vehicle mode. It is launched from the shooter lane in the front of the base. But when Rin and Kai manually activates its Robo Mode, it becomes '''Wing Liner Robo'''. This manual ativation is rather tiring. It is the tallest among the transporters when in Robo mode. ; TMR-02SG Siren Galley Pilots: Alice Beckham Blue Siren's Transport unit. It resembles an armored van in Vehicle mode. It is launched from the shooter lane in front of the base. But when Alice and either Susumu or Tsuyoshi manually activates its Robo Mode, it becomes '''Siren Galley Robo'''. This manual activation is rather tiring. ; TMR-03GD Gear Dump Pilots: Sayuri Suizenji, Ken Minami Yellow Gear's Transport unit. It is the shortest of all the transporters of the MRR. It is launched from the shooter lane in front of the base. It resembles a dump truck in Vehicle mode. But when Sayuri and Ken manually activates its Robo Mode, it becomes '''Gear Dump Robo'''. This manual activation is rather tiring. ; TMR-04MC Machine Commander The last transporter of the MRR, it is composed of 3 units: the TMR-04MC1 Red Commander, TMR-04MC2 Blue Commander and TMR-04MC3 Yellow Commander. A Leader Robo from each team goes inside their team's respective Commander and all 3 Commanders combines into Machine Commander. Machine Commander is launched from the Slinger Catapult in the back of the base. If necessary, the launch of Machine Commander, including the Slinger Catapult, can be operated manually, as shown in episode 32. This is very tiring for those operating the catapult. If needed, Machine Commander can change into Machine Commander Robo while it has a Leader Robo loaded in each Commander. The command for this is '''"Machine Commander! Leader Gattai Hajime!"''' (lit. '''"Machine Commander! Leader Combine begin!"'''). Machine Commander Robo can release the leaders contained within itself, although it is unknown how many can be released at a time. Machine Commander Robo can combine with V-Stealth Robo to become Machine Commander Robo V. His special attacks are '''Mighty Flash''' as Machine Commander Robo and '''Sprinkler Shield''' and '''Dual Tornado''' as Machine Commander Robo V. ===Disasters=== ; Gura Gorros These are units created by Kaiser-G to interfere Machine Robo Rescue's duties. After Kaiser-G is defeated, 3 of them were trained and assigned to Rin Haruka as the Gura Gorro Rescue Squad for International Hyper Rescue ; BL Fire Robo/Hyper BL Fire Robo The first of the BL Machine Robos created by the disasters. He is the black/violet version of Fire Robo who uses fire instead of water. The most popular among the BL Robos for he is usually seen fighting in the series, he was destroyed by Machine Commander Robo V. His special attack is '''Burning Storm'''. ; BL Police Robo/Hyper BL Police Robo Second of the BL Machine Robos and a black version of Police Robo. He was the last to be destroyed and by Machine Commander Robo. His special attack is '''Exhaust Bomber'''. ; BL Drill Robo/Hyper BL Drill Robo The last of the BL Machine Robos who is the brown/olive version version of Drill Robo. He was defeated by Stealth Robo using Jet Robo's parts. His special attack is '''Power Crusher'''. All three of the BL Machine Robos were in commanded by Col. Hazard with his black K-Boy. To have a BL Machine Robo change into Hyper Mode, Hazard uses the command '''"BL Hyper Mode! Gattai Kaishin!"''' (lit. '''"BL Hyper Mode! Commence fusion!"''') ===Guest Units=== ; Air Leon Appeared in the Two-Part Special, it was a special Mugenbine Machine Robo enlisted in the MRR. ==Theme songs== * Go! Go!

At its basic level, MT performs simple [[substitution]] of words in one natural language for words in another, but that alone usually cannot produce a good translation of a text, because recognition of whole phrases and their closest counterparts in the target language is needed. Solving this problem with [[corpus linguistics|corpus]] and [[statistics|statistical]] techniques is a rapidly growing field that is leading to better translations, handling differences in [[linguistic typology]], translation of [[idiom]]s, and the isolation of anomalies.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Current machine translation software often allows for customisation by domain or [[profession]] (such as [[meteorology|weather reports]]), improving output by limiting the scope of allowable substitutions. This technique is particularly effective in domains where formal or formulaic language is used. It follows that machine translation of government
