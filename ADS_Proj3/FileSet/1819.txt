The stripes on the shield were changed again, this time to "[[Pale (heraldry)|palewise]]" (vertical), and the eagle's wing position was changed to "displayed" (wingtips up) instead of "rising". Barton also wrote a more properly heraldic blazon.<ref name="statepub"/> The design was submitted to Congress on June 20, 1782 and was accepted the same day. Thomson included a page of explanatory notes, but no drawing was submitted. This remains the official definition of the Great Seal today.<ref name="statepub"/> [[File:WashingtonNegotiatingAuthorizationSept1782.jpg|thumb|First sealed document]] The first brass die was cut sometime between June and September, and placed in the State House in Philadelphia. It was first used by Thomson on September 16, 1782, to verify signatures on a document which authorized [[George Washington]] to negotiate an exchange of prisoners. Charles Thomson, as the Secretary of Congress, remained the keeper of the seal until the [[Federal government of the United States|Federal government]] was formed in 1789.<ref name="statepub"/> On July 24, 1789, President Washington asked Thomson to deliver the seal to the Department of Foreign Affairs in the person of Roger Alden, who kept it until the Department of State was created.<ref name="hunt1909"/> All subsequent Secretaries of State have been responsible for applying the Seal to diplomatic documents. On September 15, 1789, the [[United States Congress]] ordered that "that the seal heretofore used by the United States in Congress assembled, shall be, and hereby is declared to be, the seal of the United States."<ref name="ahcritic"/> ====Sources of elements==== The final design was a combination of elements provided by all three committees: *'''First committee''' **E Pluribus Unum **Eye of Providence in a triangle **1776 in Roman numerals *'''Second committee''' **Thirteen red and white stripes and blue chief on shield **Constellation of 13 stars, surrounded by clouds and glory **War and peace theme, including olive branch and (on first draft) arrows *'''Third committee''' **Eagle (though not a bald eagle) **Unfinished pyramid **Overall design of the reverse *'''Charles Thomson''' **Overall design of the obverse **Bald eagle **Annuit Cœptis **Novus Ordo Seclorum *'''William Barton''' **Vertical stripes on shield **Position of eagle's wings ==Seal dies== The metallic die of the obverse side of the Great Seal is what actually [[Embossing (paper)|embosses]] the design onto documents. These dies eventually wear down, requiring replacements to be made. The current die is the seventh engraving of the seal, and the actual design on the dies has evolved over time. ===First die=== [[File:US Great Seal 1782 drawing.png|thumb|150px|Drawing of die design]] The first die was made of brass, and measured 2 1/16 inches in diameter while being one half inch thick.<ref name="statepub"/> It was cut sometime between June and September, 1782 (i.e. between the design being accepted and its first use), although the exact date is not known.<ref name="totten">{{cite book | last=Totten | first=C.A.L. | authorlink=C.

There is no fruit on the olive branch, and the engraver added a border of [[acanthus (genus)|acanthus]] leaves.<ref name="statepub"/> Depicting an eagle with a [[Crest (bird)|crest]] is typical in heraldry, but is at odds with the official blazon of the seal which specifies a bald eagle (which have no crests). The blazon does not specify the arrangement of the stars (which were randomly placed in Thomson's sketch) nor the number of points; the engraver chose six-pointed stars (typical of English heraldry), and arranged them in a larger six-pointed star.<ref name="ahart">{{cite web|url=http://americanheraldry.org/pages/index.php?n=Official.USEmb|title= The Arms of the USA -- Artistic Expressions|last=McMillan|first=Joseph|publisher=americanheraldry.org|accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref> No drawing made by the engraver has ever been found, and it is not known if Thomson provided any.<ref name="statepub"/> This first die was used until 1841, and is now on display in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name="statepub"/> There was no die made of the reverse side of the seal (and in fact, one has never been made). The intended use was for pendant seals, which are discs of wax attached to the document by a cord or ribbon, and thus have two sides. However, the United States did not use pendant seals at the time, and there was no need for a die of the reverse.<ref name="statepub"/> According to Benson Lossing in 1856, who claimed to have a wax impression, Congress later ordered a version half the size to impress wax and paper.<ref name="lossing1856">{{cite journal | last = Lossing | first = Benson J. | authorlink = Benson John Lossing | title = Great Seal of the United States | journal = [[Harper's Magazine|Harper's New Monthly Magazine]] | volume = 13 | issue = 74 | pages = 184–5 | publisher = [[Harper & Brothers]] | location = [[New York City|New York]] | date = July 1856 | url = http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/moa-cgi?notisid=ABK4014-0013-24 | accessdate = }}</ref> More recent research has not been able to verify this claim, with no record of this seal being found.<ref>''The Eagle and the Shield'', p. 564</ref> [[File:1780sPresidentOfCongressSealDrawing.png|thumb|140px]] ===Continental Congress President's seal=== Shortly after the first die, the [[Congress of the Confederation]] ordered a smaller seal for the use of the [[President of the Continental Congress|President of the Congress]].
