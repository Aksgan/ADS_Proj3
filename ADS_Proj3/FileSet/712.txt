CSL styles currently available online at the [http://www.zotero.org/styles Zotero Style Repository]. In 2008 [[Mendeley]] appeared, becoming the second reference manager to use CSL. The versioned releases of CSL are CSL 0.8 (released March 21, 2009), CSL 0.8.1 (February 1, 2010) and CSL 1.0 (March 22, 2010). CSL 1.0, developed by D'Arcus, Frank Bennett and Rintze Zelle, represented a major overhaul of the CSL language, introducing many new features and improved project documentation. ==Software Support== [[Zotero]] 2.0.x and [[Mendeley]] versions prior to 0.9.8 support CSL 0.8.1, whereas Zotero 2.1 Beta and the latest Mendeley releases support CSL 1.0 by integrating the CSL 1.0-compatible JavaScript [http://bitbucket.org/fbennett/citeproc-js/wiki/Home citeproc-js] CSL processor. [http://code.haskell.org/citeproc-hs/ citeproc-hs] is a CSL 1.0-compatible CSL processor written in Haskell.

It has been replaced by [[CiteSeerX|CiteSeer<sup>''x''</sup>]]. It was created by researchers [[Steve Lawrence (computer scientist)|Steve Lawrence]], [[Kurt Bollacker]] and [[Lee Giles]] while they were at the [[NEC Research Institute]] (now [[NEC Corporation|NEC]] Labs), [[Princeton, New Jersey]], USA. CiteSeer's goal was to actively crawl and harvest academic and scientific documents on the web and use autonomous [[citation index]]ing to permit querying by citation or by document, ranking them by [[citation impact]]. After NEC, it was hosted as CiteSeer.IST on the [[World Wide Web]] at the College of Information Sciences and Technology, The [[Pennsylvania State University]], and had over 700,000 documents, primarily in the fields of [[computer science|computer]] and [[information science]] and engineering. CiteSeer freely provided [[Open Archives Initiative]] [[metadata]] of all indexed documents and links indexed documents when possible to other sources of metadata such as [[DBLP]] and the [[ACM Portal]]. CiteSeer's goal was to improve the dissemination and access of academic and scientific literature. As a non-profit service that can be freely used by anyone, it has been considered as part of the [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] movement that is attempting to change [[academic publishing|academic and scientific publishing]] to allow greater access to scientific literature. The name can be construed to have at least two explanations. As a pun, a 'sightseer' is a tourist who looks at the sights, so a 'cite seer' would be a researcher who looks at cited papers. Another is a 'seer' is a prophet and a 'cite seer' is a prophet of citations. CiteSeer has not been comprehensively updated since 2005 due to limitations in its architecture design. It had a representative sampling of research documents in computer and information science but is limited in coverage because it only has access to papers that are publicly available, usually at an author's homepage, or that are submitted by an author. The new version and design of CiteSeer can be found at the Next Generation CiteSeer, [[CiteSeerX|CiteSeer<sup>''x''</sup>]], website. CiteSeer-like engines and archives usually only harvest documents from publicly available websites and do not crawl publisher websites. As such authors whose documents are freely available are more likely to be represented in the index. ==Compared to DBLP== A comparison of [[Digital Bibliography & Library Project|DBLP]] references to actual papers in CiteSeer is somewhat like comparing apples to oranges. DBLP is a manually implemented bibliography gleaned from publisher websites. Consider the references in DBLP to well known authors such as [[Alex Pentland]] ([[MIT]]) or [[Ramesh Jain]] ([[University of California, Irvine|UCI]]) (DBLP listings for Alex Pentland - http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/p/Pentland:Alex.html or Ramesh Jain - http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/j/Jain:Ramesh.html). DBLP shows a regular number of publications (~9) each year in [[DBLP]] through 2007. Note that CiteSeer had only one of their publications after 2000. However, DBLP has not cached any of their actual publications but only links to them on publisher websites. In addition CiteSeer had technical reports and papers in other fields such as statistics that DBLP does not index. ==Recent developments== ===Other CiteSeer Engines=== The CiteSeer model had been extended to cover academic documents in business with [[SmealSearch]] and in e-business with [[eBizSearch]]. However, these were not maintained by their sponsors. A older version of both of these could be once found at [[BizSeer.IST]] but is no longer in service. For enhanced access and performance, similar versions of CiteSeer were supported at universities such as the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[University of Zürich]] and the [[National University of Singapore]]. However, these versions of CiteSeer proved difficult to maintain and are no longer available. Versions of CiteSeer have been or are available at the following links:<br> [http://citeseer.ittc.ku.edu Univ. of Kansas] [http://citeseer.csail.mit.edu MIT] [http://sherry.ifi.unizh.ch Univ. of Zurich] [http://citeseer.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs National Univ. of Singapore] Other Seer like search and repository systems have been built for chemistry, [[ChemXSeer|Chem<sub>X</sub>Seer]] and for archaeology, ArchSeer. Another has been built for robots.txt file search, [[BotSeer]]. All of these are built on the open source tool [[SeerSuite]] which uses the open source indexer [[Lucene]]. ===Next Generation CiteSeer (CiteSeer<sup>''x''</sup>)=== {{See|CiteSeerX}} The Next Generation CiteSeer project, CiteSeer<sup>''x''</sup>, funded by the National Science Foundation and initially by [[Microsoft Research]], enhanced CiteSeer both as a search engine and as a
