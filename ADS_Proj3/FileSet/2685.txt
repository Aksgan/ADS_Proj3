absolutely no doubt at all that a few, a very few, malcontents in MI5 . . . a lot of them like Peter Wright who were rightwing, malicious and had serious personal grudges – gave vent to these and spread damaging malicious stories about that Labour government."<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/oct/10/defence-of-the-realm-mi5 | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=The Defence of the Realm: The Authorized History of MI5 by Christopher Andrew | first=David | last=Leigh | date=10 October 2009 | accessdate=11 May 2010}}</ref> Mountbatten's role in the plotting remains unclear. At the very least he appears to have associated with people who were greatly concerned about the country in the 1970s and were prepared to consider acting against the Government. It also seems certain that he shared their concerns. However, even though the BBC documentary alleged that he had offered his services to the coup plotters, it cannot be confirmed that he actually would have led a coup had it come about. It is notable that any plots that were discussed never actually took place, perhaps because the number of people involved was so small that any chances of success were slim.{{Or|date=August 2010}} ==Personal life== ===Marriage=== [[Image:Louis and Edwina Mountbatten 01.jpg|thumb|200px|Louis and Edwina Mountbatten]] [[Image:The Earl Mountbatten of Burma at home Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|200px|Lord Mountbatten of Burma in 1976, by [[Allan Warren]].]] {{Refimprove|date=August 2010}} Mountbatten's nickname among family and friends was "Dickie," notable in that "Richard" was not among his given names. This was because his great-grandmother, [[Queen Victoria]], suggested the nickname of "Nicky", however it got mixed up with the many Nickys of the Russian Imperial Family ("Nicky" was particularly used to refer to [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], the last Tsar) so they changed it to Dickie. Mountbatten was married on 18 July 1922 to [[Edwina Mountbatten, Countess Mountbatten of Burma|Edwina Cynthia Annette Ashley]], daughter of [[Wilfrid William Ashley, 1st Baron Mount Temple|Wilfred William Ashley]], later 1st [[Baron Mount Temple]], himself a grandson of the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|7th Earl of Shaftesbury]]. She was the favourite granddaughter of the Edwardian magnate Sir [[Ernest Cassel]] and the principal heir to his fortune. There followed a glamorous honeymoon tour of European courts and America which famously included a visit with [[Douglas Fairbanks]], [[Mary Pickford]], and [[Charlie Chaplin]] in [[Hollywood]], Chaplin creating a widely seen home movie "Nice and Easy", featuring the talents of Fairbanks, Pickford, Chaplin, and the Mountbattens. They had two daughters: [[Patricia Mountbatten, 2nd Countess Mountbatten of Burma]] (born on 14 February 1924), and [[Lady Pamela Hicks|Lady Pamela Carmen Louise (Hicks)]] (born on 19 April 1929).{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The couple, in some ways, seemed incompatible from the beginning. Lord Mountbatten's obsession with being organised led him to keep a very close watch on Edwina and he demanded her constant attention. Having no real hobby or passions and living the lifestyle of royalty, Edwina spent most of her time partying with the British and Indian elite, going on cruises and secluding herself at the couple's country house on weekends. Even with growing unhappiness on both their parts, Louis refused to get a divorce fearing that it would hinder his climb up the military command chain. There were charges of infidelity against both. Edwina's numerous affairs led Louis to pursue a relationship with a French woman named Yola Letellier.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} From this point forward their marriage disintegrated into constant accusations and suspicions. Throughout the 1930s both readily admitted to numerous affairs. World War II gave Edwina the opportunity to focus on something other than Louis' infidelity. She joined the St. John's Ambulance Brigade as an administrator. This role gave Edwina the legacy of being a heroine{{Who|date=August 2010}} of the Partition Period because of her efforts to ease the pain and suffering of the people in the Punjab.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} It has been well documented that Edwina and India's first PM Jawaharlal Nehru became intimate friends after Indian Independence. During the summers, she would frequent the PM's house so she could lounge about on his veranda during the hot Delhi days. Personal correspondence between the two reveals a satisfying yet frustrating relationship. Edwina states in one of her letters "Nothing that we did or felt would ever be allowed to come between you and your work or me and mine -- because that would spoil everything."<ref>Bailey, Katherine, "India's Last Vicereine," ''British Heritage,'' Vol. 21, Issue 3, Apr/May 2000, pp. 16</ref> Despite this, it is still debated whether or not their relationship became physical. Both Mountbatten daughters have candidly acknowledged that their mother had a fiery temperament and was not always supportive of her husband when jealousy of his high profile overbore a sense of their having common cause. Lady Mountbatten died on 21 February 1960 at the age of 58 while in North Borneo inspecting medical facilities. Her death is thought to have been caused by a heart condition.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Until his assassination in 1979, Mountbatten kept a photograph of his cousin [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia (1899–1918)|Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia]], beside his bed in memory of the crush he once had upon her.<ref>King and Wilson (2003), p. 49</ref> ===Daughter as heir=== Since Mountbatten had no sons, when he was created Viscount on 23 August 1946, then Earl and Baron on 28 October 1947, the [[Letters Patent]] were drafted such that the titles would pass to the female line and its male issue. This was at his firm insistence: his relationship with his elder daughter had always been particularly close and it was his special wish that she succeed to the title in her own right. There was longstanding precedent for such remainders for military commanders: past examples included the [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|1st Viscount Nelson]] and the [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|1st Earl Roberts]]. ===Leisure interests=== Like many members of the royal family, Mountbatten was an aficionado of polo, and received U.S. patent 1,993,334 in 1931 for a polo stick.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1997/4/1997_4_10.shtml| title = Advanced Weaponry of the Stars| accessdate = 2009-12-24| publisher =
