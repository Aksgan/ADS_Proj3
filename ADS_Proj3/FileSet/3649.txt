In combination with the later applied learning method or as preprocessing step occurs a [[feature selection]] problem. A typical [[data mining]] based prediction uses e.g. [[support vector machine]]s, [[decision tree]]s, [[neural networks]] for [[inductive reasoning|inducing]] a predictive learning model. [[Molecule mining]] approaches, a special case of [[structured data mining]] approaches, apply a similarity matrix based prediction or an automatic fragmentation scheme into molecular substructures.
