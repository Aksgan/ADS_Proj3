are ascribed to it. Lemmata, POS, grammatical items and their combinations are searchable. Additionally, 6 million word forms are in the subcorpus with manually resolved [[homonymy]]. <!---A statistical program that resolves homonymy using the manually tagged corpus as a [[machine-learning tool]] is already constructed and the results will be made available online soon.---> The subcorpus with resolved morphological [[homonymy]] is also automatically [[stress (linguistics)|accent]]uated. The whole corpus has a searchable tagging concerning [[lexical semantics]] (LS), including morphosemantic POS subclasses (proper noun, reflexive pronoun etc.), LS characteristics proper (thematic class, causativity, evaluation), derivation (diminutive, adverb formed from adjective etc.). The RNC includes also the following subcorpora: *a [[treebank]] of [[syntax|syntactical]] dependencies (largely based on the [[Igor Mel'čuk]]'s [[Meaning-Text Theory]]) *an English<=>Russian and German=>Russian [[parallel corpus|parallel corpora]]; *a corpus of Russian [[poetry]], where the rhyming words and poetic [[Prosody (poetry)|prosody]] (including meter, stanzas etc.) is additionally tagged; *a corpus of Russian [[dialect]]s with specific dialect grammar tagging; *a corpus showing the history of Russian [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] *an educational subcorpus reflecting school standards. All the texts have tags bearing metatextual information - the author, his/her birth date, creation date, text size, text genres (general fiction, detective story, newspaper article etc.); all these categories are browsable and searchable separately. It is possible to define a user's subcorpus to search lemmata/POS-grammeme/semantic tags combinations only within this subset. The corpus will be made available off-line and distributed for non-commercial purposes, but currently due to some technical and/or copyright problems it is accessible only on-line. ==External links== * [http://ruscorpora.ru Russian National corpus] [[Category:Corpora]] [[Category:Russian language]] [[ru:Национальный корпус русского языка]]</text> </page> <page> <id>32623</id> <title>Rustic capitals</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}} [[Image:RomanVirgilFolio014rVergilPortrait.jpg|thumb|200px|Folio14 recto of the Vergilius Romanus contains an author portrait of [[Virgil]].]] '''Rustic capitals''' (in [[Latin]] ''capitalis rustica'') is an [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] script. As the term is negatively connotated supposing an opposition to the more 'civilized' form of the [[Roman square capitals]] [[Bernhard Bischoff]] prefers to call the script ''canonized capitals''. Rustic capitals are similar to [[Roman square capitals]], but are less rigid, influenced more by pen and ink writing on [[papyrus]] or [[parchment]] than the writing used for [[inscription]]s. The letters are thinner and more compressed, use many more curved lines than do square capitals, and have [[descender]]s extending below the baseline. The script was used between the 1st century and the 9th century, most often between the 4th and 6th centuries. After the 5th century, rustic capitals began to fall out of use, but they continued to be used as a display script in titles and headings, along with [[uncial]] as the script of the main text. About fifty manuscripts with rustic capitals survive, including four copies of works by [[Virgil]] (including the [[Vergilius Vaticanus]] and the [[Vergilius Romanus]]), one copy of a work by [[Terence]], and one of a work by [[Prudentius]]. The script was usually used for ''de luxe'' copies of pagan authors; the only works by Christian authors which use this script are those by Prudentius and [[Coelius Sedulius|Sedulius]]. ==See also== * [[Uncial script]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Rustic Capitals}} [[Category:Ancient Rome]] [[Category:Latin calligraphy]] [[Category:Palaeography]] [[Category:Greek New Testament uncials| ]] [[Category:Papyrology]] [[Category:Writing]] [[Category:Medieval scripts]] [[Category:Early Middle Ages]] [[de:Capitalis Rustica]] [[es:Capitalis rustica]] [[fr:Rustica (écriture)]] [[it:Capitale rustica]]</text> </page> <page> <id>32635</id> <title>Ryo Kawasaki</title> <text>{{Infobox musical artist |Name = Ryo Kawasaki |Img =Ryo_Kawasaki.jpg |Img_capt = Ryo Kawasaki, 1995 |Img_size = |Background = non_vocal_instrumentalist |Birth_name = [[:ja:川崎燎|川崎燎]] |Alias = |Born = {{Birth date and age|1947|2|25|mf=y}}<br />[[Kōenji]], Tokyo |Origin = |Instrument = [[guitar]]s, [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]] |Genre = [[Jazz fusion]] |Occupation = [[Guitarist]], [[Composer]], [[Audio Engineer]], [[Software Programmer]] |Years_active = 1967 - |Label = |Associated_acts = |URL = http://www.ryokawasaki.com/ |Current_members = |Past_members = }} '''Ryo Kawasaki''' ([[:ja:川崎燎|川崎燎]], Kawasaki Ryo) (born February 25, 1947) chose a career as a [[jazz fusion]] [[guitarist]] after spending some years studying as a scientist. During the 60s he played with various Japanese jazz groups and also formed his own bands. In the early 70s he came to [[New York]] where he settled and found steady work in very distinguished company, including the bands of [[Gil Evans]], [[Elvin Jones]], [[Chico Hamilton]], [[Ted Curson]] and [[Joanne Brackeen]]. In the mid-80s, Kawasaki drifted out of performing music in favour of writing music [[software]] [[Computer program|programmes]] for [[computers]]. He also produced several techno dance singles, forming his own company, Satellites Records, for their release. In 1991 he returned to jazz and proved to be as skilled and adept as ever on albums recorded for a Japanese [[label]] but marketed in the United States by his own company. Thanks to his long and wide experience, Kawasaki is able to switch with apparent ease between hard bop and jazz-rock. His playing is notable for its fluency and a sometimes hard-hitting style. ==Life== ===Early life (1947–1968)=== Ryo Kawasaki was born in [[Kōenji]], Tokyo while Japan was still struggling and recovering from the early post World War II period. His father Torao Kawasaki was a renowned and honored Japanese [[diplomat]] and worked for The [[Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] since 1919. Torao worked at several Japanese [[Consular]] and [[Embassies]] including San Francisco, [[Honolulu]], Fengtian (then capital of [[Manchu]], now [[Shenyang]] as city of China), [[Shanghai]] and [[Beijing]] while active as [[English teacher]] and [[translator]] for official diplomatic conferences. Ryo's mother Hiroko was also [[multilingual]] and spoke German, Russian, English, and Chinese aside from her native tongue Japanese. Hiroko grew up in [[Manchu]] and then met Torao in [[Shanghai]]. Torao was already 58 years of age when Ryo was born as an only child and these unique circumstances of Ryo's parents may already have hinted Ryo's later developments and wandering nature in international circuit as an artist. Kawasaki's entire life has been marked by his innate inquisitiveness and powers of invention, both in music and science. While his mother encouraged him to take [[piano]] and [[ballet]] lessons, he has decided taking voice lessons and [[solfege]] at age four and [[violin]] lessons at five, and was reading music before elementary school. As a grade scholar, he began a lifelong fascination with [[astronomy]] and [[electronics]] (he built his own radios, TVs
