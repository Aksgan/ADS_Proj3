of asymptote is related to procedures of curve tracing. An asymptote serves as a guide line that serves to show the behavior of the curve towards infinity.<ref>Frost, P.

Generically, by [[Bezout's theorem]], a curve will intersect its asymptote at exactly this number of other points, as the intersection at infinity is of multiplicity two. For a [[conic]], there are a pair of lines that do not intersect the conic at any complex point: these are the two asymptotes of the conic. A plane algebraic curve is defined by an equation of the form ''P''(''x'',''y'') = 0 where ''P'' is a polynomial of degree ''n'' :<math>P(x,y) = P_n(x,y) + P_{n-1}(x,y) + \cdots + P_1(x,y) + P_0</math> where ''P''<sub>''k''</sub> is [[homogeneous polynomial|homogeneous]] of degree ''k''. Vanishing of the linear factors of the highest degree term ''P''<sub>''n''</sub> defines the asymptotes of the curve: if {{nowrap|1=''P''<sub>''n''</sub>(''x'',''y'') = (''ax'' &minus; ''by'') ''Q''<sub>''n''&minus;1</sub>(''x'',''y'')}}, then the line :<math>ax-by = t_0</math> is an asymptote, where ''t''<sub>0</sub> is chosen so that the curve and line meet at infinity. Over the complex numbers, ''P''<sub>''n''</sub> splits into linear factors, each of which defines an asymptote. However, over the reals, not only may ''P''<sub>''n''</sub> fail to split, but also if a linear factor has multiplicity greater than one, the resulting asymptote may be entirely spurious. For example, the curve {{nowrap|1=''x''<sup>4</sup> + ''y''<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 0}} has no real points in the finite plane, but its highest order term gives the asymptote ''x'' = 0 with multiplicity 4. ==Other uses of the term== {{col-begin}} {{col-2}} The hyperbolas :<math>\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}=\pm 1</math> have asymptotes :<math>y=\pm\frac{b}{a}x.</math> The equation for the union of these two lines is :<math>\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}=0.</math> {{col-2}} Similarly, the [[hyperboloid]]s :<math>\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}-\frac{z^2}{c^2}=\pm 1</math> are said to have the ''asymptotic cone''<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=YMU0AAAAMAAJ L.P.

If &phi;<sub>''n''</sub> is a sequence of continuous functions on some domain, and if ''L'' is a (possibly infinite) limit point of the domain, then the sequence constitutes an '''asymptotic scale''' if for every ''n'', <math>\varphi_{n+1}(x) = o(\varphi_n(x)) \ (x \rightarrow L)</math>. If ''f'' is a continuous function on the domain of the asymptotic scale, then ''f'' has an asymptotic expansion of order ''N'' with respect to the scale as a formal series <math>\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n \varphi_{n}(x)</math> if :<math>f(x) - \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} a_n \varphi_{n}(x) = O(\varphi_{N}(x)) \ (x \rightarrow L)</math> or :<math>f(x) - \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} a_n \varphi_{n}(x) = o(\varphi_{N-1}(x)) \ (x \rightarrow L).</math> If one or the other holds for all ''N'', then we write :<math> f(x) \sim \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n \varphi_n(x) \ (x \rightarrow L).</math> See [[asymptotic analysis]] and [[big O notation]] for the notation. The most common type of asymptotic expansion is a power series in either positive or negative powers. Methods of generating such expansions include the [[Euler–Maclaurin summation formula]] and integral transforms such as the [[Laplace transform|Laplace]] and [[Mellin transform|Mellin]] transforms. Repeated integration by parts will often lead to an asymptotic expansion. Since a ''convergent'' [[Taylor series]] fits the definition of asymptotic expansion as well, the phrase "asymptotic series" usually implies a ''non-convergent'' series. Despite non-convergence, the asymptotic expansion is useful when truncated to a finite number of terms. Typically, the best approximation is given when the series is truncated at the smallest term. This way of optimally truncating an asymptotic expansion is known as superasymptotics.<ref>{{cite journal|first=John P.|last= Boyd|title= The Devil's Invention: Asymptotic, Superasymptotic and Hyperasymptotic Series |journal=Acta Applicandae Mathematicae|volume=56|issue=1|pages=1–98|year=1999|doi=10.1023/A:1006145903624}}</ref> The error is then typically of the form <math>\sim\exp\left(-\frac{c}{\epsilon}\right)</math> where <math>\epsilon</math> is the expansion parameter. The error is thus beyond all orders in the expansion parameter. It is possible to improve on the superasymptotic error, e.g. by employing resummation methods such as [[Borel resummation]] to the divergent tail. Such methods are often referred to as hyperasymptotic approximations. ==Examples of asymptotic expansions== * [[Gamma function]] ::<math>\frac{e^x}{x^x \sqrt{2\pi x}} \Gamma(x+1) \sim
