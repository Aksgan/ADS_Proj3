expertise required.<ref name="CISSP-Guide" /> Qualitative risk assessment can be performed in a shorter period of time and with less data. Qualitative risk assessments are typically performed through interviews of a sample of personnel from all relevant groups within an organization charged with the security of the asset being assessed. Qualitative risk assessments are descriptive versus measurable. Usually a qualitative classification is done followed by a quantitative evaluation of the highest risks to be compared to the costs of security measures. Risk estimation has as input the output of risk analysis and can be split in the following steps: * assessment of the consequences through the valuation of assets * assessment of the likelihood of the incident (through threat and vulnerability valuation) * assign values to the likelihood and consequence of the risks The output is the list of risks with value levels assigned. It can be documented in a [[risk register]] During risk estimation there are generally three values of a given asset, one for the loss of one of the CIA properties: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability.<ref name=BS7799>British Standard Institute "ISMSs-Part 3: Guidelines for information security risk management" BS 7799-3:2006</ref> ==== Risk evaluation ==== The risk evaluation process receives as input the output of risk analysis process. It compares each risk level against the risk acceptance criteria and prioritise the risk list with risk treatment indications. === NIST SP 800 30 framework === [[File:NIST SP 800-30 Figure 3-1.png|thumb|Risk assessment according NIST SP 800-30 Figure 3-1]] To determine the likelihood of a future adverse event, [[threat (computer)|threat]]s to an IT system must be in conjunction with the potential [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] and the [[security controls|controls]]in place for the IT system.<br /> [[Impact (security)|Impact]] refers to the magnitude of harm that could be caused by a threat’s exercise of vulnerability. The level of impact is governed by the potential mission impacts and produces a relative value for the IT assets and resources affected (e.g., the criticality sensitivity of the IT system components and data). The [[risk assessment]] methodology encompasses nine primary steps:<ref name=SP80030>[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-30/sp800-30.pdf NIST SP 800-30 Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems]</ref> * Step 1 System Characterization * Step 2 Threat Identification * Step 3 Vulnerability Identification * Step 4 Control Analysis * Step 5 Likelihood Determination * Step 6 Impact Analysis * Step 7 Risk Determination * Step 8 Control Recommendations * Step 9 Results Documentation == Risk mitigation == Risk mitigation, the second process according to SP 800-30, the third according to ISO 27005 of risk management, involves prioritizing, evaluating, and implementing the appropriate risk-reducing controls recommended from the risk assessment process. Because the elimination of all risk is usually impractical or close to impossible, it is the responsibility of senior management and functional and business managers to use the least-cost approach and implement the most appropriate controls to decrease mission risk to an acceptable level, with minimal adverse [[impact (security)|impact]]on the organization’s resources and mission. === ISO 27005 framework === The risk treatment process aim at selecting security measures to: * reduce * retain * avoid * transfer risk and produce a risk treatment plan, that is the output of the process with the residual risks subject to the acceptance of management. There are some list to select appropriate security measures,<ref name=ISO27001/> but is up to the single organization to choose the most appropriate one according to its business strategy, constraints of the environment and circumstances. The choice should be rational and documented. The importance of accepting a risk that is too costly to reduce is very high and led to the fact that risk acceptance is considered a separate process.<ref name=ISO27005/> Risk transfer apply were the risk has a very high [[impact (security)|impact]] but is not easy to reduce significantly the likelihood by means of security controls: the [[insurance]] premium should be compared against the mitigation costs, eventually evaluating some mixed strategy to partially treat the risk. Another option is to outsource the risk to somebody more efficient to manage the risk.<ref>Costas Lambrinoudakisa, Stefanos Gritzalisa, Petros Hatzopoulosb, Athanasios N.

For example, the choice of not storing sensitive information about customers can be an avoidance for the risk that customer data can be stolen. The ''residual risks'', i.e. the risk reaming after risk treatment decision have been taken, should be estimated to ensure that sufficient protection is achieved. If the residual risk is unacceptable, the risk treatment process should be iterated. === NIST SP 800 30 framework === [[File:NIST SP 800-30 Figure 4-2.png|thumb|Risk mitigation methodology flow chart from NIST SP 800-30 Figure 4-2]] [[File:NIST SP 800-30 Figure 4-1.png|thumb|Risk mitigation action point according to NIST SP 800-30 Figure 4-1]] Risk mitigation is a systematic methodology used by senior management to reduce mission risk.<ref name=SP80030/><br /> Risk mitigation can be achieved through any of the following risk mitigation options: * '''Risk Assumption'''. To accept the potential risk and continue operating the IT system or to implement controls to lower the risk to an acceptable level * '''Risk Avoidance'''. To avoid the risk by eliminating the risk cause and/or consequence (e.g., forgo certain functions of the system or shut down the system when risks are identified) * '''Risk Limitation'''. To limit the risk by implementing controls that minimize the adverse impact of a threat’s exercising a vulnerability (e.g., use of supporting, preventive, detective controls) * '''Risk Planning'''. To manage risk by developing a risk mitigation plan that prioritizes,implements, and maintains controls * ''' Research and Acknowledgement'''. To lower the risk of loss by acknowledging the vulnerability or flaw and researching controls to correct the vulnerability * '''Risk Transference'''. To transfer the risk by using other options to compensate for the loss, such as purchasing insurance. Address the greatest risks and strive for sufficient risk mitigation at the lowest cost, with
