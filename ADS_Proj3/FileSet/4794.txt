According to Alexa, the English [[subdomain]] (en.wikipedia.org; [[English Wikipedia]]) receives approximately 54% of Wikipedia's cumulative traffic, with the remaining split among the other languages (Japanese: 10%, German: 8%, Spanish: 5%, Russian: 4%, French: 4%, Italian: 3%).<ref name="AlexaStats" /> As of July 2008, the five largest language editions are (in order of article count) [[English Wikipedia|English]], [[German Wikipedia|German]], [[French Wikipedia|French]], [[Polish Wikipedia|Polish]], and [[Japanese Wikipedia]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Multilingual_statistics |title=Wikipedia:Multilingual statistics |publisher=English Wikipedia |accessdate=2007-12-23}}</ref> Since Wikipedia is web-based and therefore worldwide, contributors of a same language edition may use different dialects or may come from different countries (as is the case for the [[English Wikipedia|English edition]]). These differences may lead to some conflicts over [[American and British English spelling differences|spelling differences]], (e.g. ''color'' vs. ''colour'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Spelling|title= spelling | work = Manual of Style | publisher = Wikipedia |accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref> or points of view.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias|title=Countering systemic bias|accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref> Though the various language editions are held to global policies such as "neutral point of view," they diverge on some points of policy and practice, most notably on whether images that are not [[free content|licensed freely]] may be used under a claim of [[fair use]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fair_use |title=Fair use |publisher=Meta wiki |accessdate=2007-07-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Images_on_Wikipedia |title=Images on Wikipedia |accessdate=2007-07-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.research.ibm.com/visual/papers/viegas_hicss_visual_wikipedia.pdf |format=PDF|author=Fernanda B.

They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all of its projects (Wikipedia and others).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/|title=Meta-Wiki|accessdate=2009-03-24|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation}}</ref> For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Statistics|title=Meta-Wiki Statistics|accessdate=2008-03-24|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation}}</ref> and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should have.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have|title=List of articles every Wikipedia should have|accessdate=2008-03-24|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation}}</ref> The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, foodstuffs, and mathematics. As for the rest, it is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small towns in the United States might only be available in English. Translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions, in part because automated translation of articles is disallowed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Translations |title=Wikipedia: Translation |work=English Wikipedia |accessdate=2007-02-03}}</ref> Articles available in more than one language may offer "[[Interwiki links]]", which link to the counterpart articles in other editions. == Cultural significance == <!-- Every single cultural, media or Internet reference to Wikipedia does not need to be mentioned here and differentiation between what constitutes a matter of significance and what is run-of-the-mill is important when adding content here. --> [[File:Time Between Edits Graph Jul05-Present.png|thumb|Graph showing the number of days between every 10,000,000th edit.]] [[File:White Nerdy YOU SUCK cropped.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Wikipedia page on Atlantic Records being edited to read: "You suck!"|Wikipedia shown in [["Weird Al" Yankovic|Weird Al]]'s music video for his song "[[White & Nerdy]]."]] {{Main|Wikipedia in culture}} In addition to [[Logistic function|logistic growth]] in the number of its articles,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Modelling_Wikipedia%27s_growth |title=Wikipedia:Modelling Wikipedia's growth |accessdate=2007-12-22}}</ref> Wikipedia has steadily gained status as a general reference website since its inception in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comscore.com/press/release.asp?press=849 |title=694 Million People Currently Use the Internet Worldwide According To comScore Networks |date=2006-05-04 |publisher=comScore |accessdate=2007-12-16 |quote=Wikipedia has emerged as a site that continues to increase in popularity, both globally and in the U.S.|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080730011713/http://www.comscore.com/press/release.asp?press=849|archivedate=2008-07-30}}</ref> According to [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]] and [[comScore]], Wikipedia is among the ten most visited websites worldwide.<ref name="AlexaTop500">{{cite web|url=http://www.alexa.com/site/ds/top_sites?ts_mode=global&lang=none |title=Top 500 |publisher=[[Alexa Internet|Alexa]] |accessdate=2009-10-13 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comscore.com/press/data/top_worldwide_properties.asp |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080124110845/www.comscore.com/press/data/top_worldwide_properties.asp |archivedate=2008-01-15 |title=comScore Data |month=December | year=2007 |accessdate=2008-01-19}}</ref> The growth of Wikipedia has been fueled by its dominant position in Google search results;<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.hoover.org/publications/ednext/16111162.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080327230211/http://www.hoover.org/publications/ednext/16111162.html |archivedate=2008-03-27 |title=Wikipedia or Wickedpedia? |journal=Hoover Institution |first=Michael J |last= Petrilli |volume=8 |issue=2 |accessdate=2008-03-21}}</ref> about 50% of search engine traffic to Wikipedia comes from Google,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://weblogs.hitwise.com/leeann-prescott/2007/02/wikipedia_traffic_sources.html |title=Google Traffic To Wikipedia up 166% Year over Year |publisher=Hitwise |date=2007-02-16 |accessdate=2007-12-22}}</ref> a good portion of which is related to academic research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://weblogs.hitwise.com/leeann-prescott/2006/10/wikipedia_and_academic_researc.html |title=Wikipedia and Academic Research |publisher=Hitwise |date=2006-10-17 |accessdate=2008-02-06}}</ref> The number of readers of Wikipedia worldwide reached 365 million at the end of 2009.<ref name="365M"/> The [[Pew Research Center|Pew]] Internet and American Life project found that one third of US Internet users consulted Wikipedia.<ref>{{cite web|first=Lee |last=Rainie |coauthors=Bill Tancer |title=Wikipedia users |publisher=Pew Research Center |work=Pew Internet & American Life Project |date=2007-12-15 |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Wikipedia07.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080306031354/http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Wikipedia07.pdf |archivedate=2008-03-06 |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-12-15 |quote=36% of online American adults consult Wikipedia.
