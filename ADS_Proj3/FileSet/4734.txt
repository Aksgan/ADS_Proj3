| genre = 3D model format | container for = | contained by = | extended from = | extended to = | standard = | free = | url = }} '''OBJ''' (or .OBJ) is a geometry definition file format first developed by [[Wavefront Technologies]] for its [[The Advanced Visualizer|Advanced Visualizer]] animation package. The file format is open and has been adopted by other 3D graphics application vendors. For the most part it is a universally accepted format. The OBJ file format is a simple data-format that represents 3D geometry alone &mdash; namely, the position of each vertex, the UV position of each texture coordinate vertex, normals, and the faces that make each polygon defined as a list of vertices, and texture vertices. Vertices are stored in a counter-clockwise order by default, making explicit declaration of normals unnecessary. == File format == Lines beginning with a hash character (#) are comments. # this is a comment An OBJ file contains several types of definitions: # List of Vertices, with (x,y,z[,w]) coordinates, w is optional. v 0.123 0.234 0.345 1.0 v ... ... # Texture coordinates, in (u,v[,w]) coordinates, w is optional. vt 0.500 -1.352 [0.234] vt ... ... # Normals in (x,y,z) form; normals might not be [[Unit normal|unit]]. vn 0.707 0.000 0.707 vn ... ... # Face Definitions (see below) f 1 2 3 f 3/1 4/2 5/3 f 6/4/1 3/5/3 7/6/5 f ... ... === Face definitions === Faces are defined using lists of vertex, texture and normal indices. Polygons such as quadrilaterals can be defined by using more than three vertex/texture/normal indices. OBJ files also support free form curved surface objects such as [[NURB]] surfaces. There are several ways to define a face, but each face line definition starts with "f" character. ==== Vertex ==== A valid vertex index starts from 1 and match first vertex element of vertex list previously defined. Each face can contain more than three elements. f v1 v2 v3 v4 ... ==== Vertex/texture-coordinate ==== Each texture coordinate index must follow with no space the first slash. Texture coordinates index are optional. A valid texture coordinate index starts from 1 and match first texture coordinate element of texture coordinate list previously defined. Each face can contain more than three elements. f v1/vt1 v2/vt2 v3/vt3 ... ==== Vertex/texture-coordinate/normal ==== Each normal index must follow with no space the second slash. Normals index are optional. A valid normal index starts from 1 and match first normal element of normal list previously defined. Each face can contain more than three elements. f v1/vt1/vn1 v2/vt2/vn2 v3/vt3/vn3 ... ==== Vertex/normal ==== As texture coordinates are optional, one can define geometry without them, but one must put the normal index after second slash. f v1//vn1 v2//vn2 v3//vn3 ... === Referencing materials === Materials that describe the visual aspects of the polygons are stored in external .mtl files. The .mtl file may contain one or more named material definitions. mtllib [external .mtl file name] ... Named objects, polygon groups and material groups are specified via the following tags. o [object name] ... g [group name] ... usemtl [material name] ... The material name matches a named material definition in an external .mtl file. Each tag applies to all faces following, until another tag of the same type appears. The texture coordinate can be left out if the current material definition does not include a texture. f v1//vn1 v2//vn2 v3//vn3 ... Smooth shading across polygons is enabled by smoothing groups s 1 ... # Smooth shading can be disabled as well. s off ... More than one external MTL material file may be referenced from within the OBJ file. === Relative and absolute indices === OBJ files, due to their list structure, are able to reference vertices, normals, etc either by their absolute (1-indexed) list position, or relatively by using negative indices and counting backwards. However, not all software supports the latter approach, and conversely some software inherently writes only the latter form (due to the convenience of appending elements without needing to recalculate vertex offsets, etc), leading to occasional incompatibilities. ==Material template library== {{Infobox file format | name = MTL material format | icon = | logo = | screenshot = | caption = | extension = <tt>.mtl</tt> | mime = | type code = | uniform type = | magic = | owner = [[Wavefront Technologies]] | released = <!-- {{Start date|YYYY|mm|dd|df=yes}} --> | latest release version = | latest release date = <!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|mm|dd|df=yes}} --> | genre = 3D texture format | container for = | contained by = | extended from = | extended to = | standard = | free = | url = }} === Synopsis === In 3D [[Computer Graphics]], one of the most common geometry interchange file formats is the OBJ. The .MTL File Format is a companion file format that describes surface shading (material) properties of objects within one or more .OBJ files. A .OBJ file references one or more .MTL files (called "material libraries"), and from there, references one or more material descriptions by name. (This author believes that expanding "MTL" to "Material Template Library" is a post-construction, as "mtl" is common shorthand for "material," and there is nothing template-ey about the use of materials in mtl files.) === Introduction === The '''Material Template Library''' format (MTL) is a standard defined by [[Wavefront Technologies]] for [[ASCII]] files that define the light reflecting properties of a surface for the purposes of [[computer rendering]], and according to the [[Phong shading]] model. The standard has widespread support among different computer software packages, making it a useful format for interchange of materials. MTL files are commonly accompanied by and referenced from OBJ files that define geometry upon which the materials of the MTL file are mapped. The MTL format, although still widely used, is outdated and does not fully support later technologies such as specular maps and [[parallax mapping|parallax maps]]. However due to the open and intuitive nature of the format,
