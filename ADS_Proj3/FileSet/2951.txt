headed by [[Victor Glushkov]]. It stands for «Машина для Инженерных Расчётов» (Machine for Engineering Calculations). It was designed as a relatively small-scale computer for use in engineering and scientific applications. Among other innovations, it contained a hardware implementation of a high-level programming language capable of [[Symbolic computation|symbolic manipulations]] with [[fraction]]s, [[polynomial]]s, [[derivative]]s and [[integral]]s. Another innovative feature for that time was the [[user interface]] combining a keyboard with a monitor and [[light pen]] used for correcting texts and drawing on screen. It could be considered one of the first personal computers.

It was created by order by Miroslav, brother of [[Stefan Nemanja]], [[List of Serbian monarchs|Grand Prince of Rascia]]. The first to discover and study the manuscript were three Russian scholars: [[Vladimir Stasov]], [[Fyodor Buslayev]], and [[Nikodim Kondakov]]. A leaf of the book which Archbishop Porfiry Uspensky cut out of the book from the Hilandar Monastery library in 1845 was first shown at the exhibition in Kiev in 1874.<ref>[http://www.nlr.ru/eng/exib/Gospel/slav/20.html NLR.ru]</ref> The earliest facsimile edition appeared in [[Vienna]] in 1897. The book was traditionally preserved in the [[Hilandar]] Monastery on [[Mount Athos]], but, after passing through several hands during [[World War II]], it wound up at the collection of the [[National Museum of Serbia]] in [[Belgrade]]. The book was transcribed in [[Kotor]] (in today's [[Montenegro]]) between [[1186]] and [[1190]] from an earlier text. "Miroslav Gospels" were commissioned by [[Serbia]]n prince [[Miroslav of Hum]], ruler of today's [[Herzegovina]] (in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]). Most pages are by the unknown scribe from [[Zeta (state)|Zeta]], with the last few pages being by the scribe Gligorije from [[Raška (state)|Raška]].

Both the imposing length of and awesome erudition displayed in that work have understandably overshadowed his other literary achievements, many of which deserve to be noted in their own valuable capacities. ==Description== Shortly following Gibbon's death, his good friend and literary executor, [[John Holroyd, 1st Earl of Sheffield|John Lord Sheffield]] undertook to edit and in 1796 published the first (of three) edition(s) of the
