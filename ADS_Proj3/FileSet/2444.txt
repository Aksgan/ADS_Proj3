the air by the time Kripke first published, [[Saul Kripke]]'s work on modal logic is rightly regarded as ground-breaking. Most importantly, it was Kripke who proved the completeness theorems for modal logic, and Kripke who identified the weakest normal modal logic. Despite the seminal contribution of Kripke's work, many modal logicians{{Who|date=October 2009}} deprecate the term '''Kripke semantics''' as disrespectful of the important contributions these other pioneers made. The other most widely used term '''possible world semantics''' is deprecated as inappropriate when applied to modalities other than possibility and necessity, such as in epistemic or deontic logic. Instead they prefer the terms '''relational semantics''' or '''frame semantics'''. The use of "semantics" for "model theory" has been objected to as well{{Who|date=October 2009}}, on the grounds that it invites confusion with linguistic semantics: whether the apparatus of "possible worlds" that appears in models has anything to do with the [[linguistic meaning]] of modal constructions in natural language is a contentious issue. == Notes == <references/> ==See also== * [[Modal logic]] * [[Normal modal logic]] * [[Kripke structure]] * [[Two dimensionalism]] ==References== * Blackburn, P., M. de Rijke, and Y.

It is basically a [[Graph (mathematics)|graph]] whose nodes represent the reachable states of the system and whose edges represent state transitions. A labeling function maps each node to a set of properties that hold in the corresponding state. [[Temporal logic]]s are traditionally interpreted in terms of Kripke structures. ==Formal definition== Let <math>AP</math> be a set of ''atomic [[Propositional calculus|propositions]]'', i.e. boolean expressions over variables, constants and predicate symbols. A Kripke structure<ref>Clarke, Grumberg and Peled: "Model Checking", page 14. The MIT Press, 1999.</ref> is a [[n-tuple|4-tuple]] <math>M = (S,\; I,\; R,\; L)</math> consisting of * a [[finite set]] of states <math>S\;</math> * a set of initial states <math>I \subseteq S</math> * a transition relation <math>R \subseteq S \! \times \! S \;</math> where <math>\; \forall s \! \in \! S, \; \exist s^' \!\! \in \! S</math> such that <math> (s,s^') \in R</math> * a labeling (or ''interpretation'') function <math>L: S \rightarrow 2^{AP}</math> Since ''R'' is [[left-total]], it is always possible to construct an infinite path through the Kripke structure. Thus a [[deadlock]] state has a single outgoing edge back to itself. The labeling function ''L'' defines for each state ''s'' &isin; ''S'' the set ''L''(''s'') of all atomic propositions that are valid in ''s''. In a Kripke structure, the transition function should be complete, i.e each and every state should have transition away from it. ==See also== * [[Temporal logic]] * [[Model checking]] * [[Kripke semantics]] == References == {{reflist}} [[Category:Philosophical logic]] [[Category:Logic in computer science]] [[el:Δομή Κρίπκε]] [[fr:Structure de Kripke]] [[ko:크립키 구조]] [[ru:Модель Крипке]] [[sk:Kripkeho štruktúra]]</text> </page> <page> <id>20853</id> <title>Kronecker sum of discrete Laplacians</title> <text>In mathematics, the '''Kronecker sum of discrete Laplacians''', named after [[Leopold Kronecker]], is a discrete version of the [[separation of variables]] for the continuous [[Laplacian]] in a [[Cuboid#Rectangular_cuboid|rectangular cuboid]] domain. ==General form of the [[Kronecker_product#Kronecker_sum_and_exponentiation|Kronecker sum]] of discrete Laplacians== In a general situation of the [[separation of variables]] in the discrete case, the multidimensional [[Discrete Laplace operator|discrete Laplacian]] is a [[Kronecker_product#Kronecker_sum_and_exponentiation|Kronecker sum]] of 1D discrete Laplacians. ===Example: 2D [[Discrete Laplace operator|discrete Laplacian]] on a [[regular grid]] with the homogeneous [[Dirichlet boundary condition]]=== Mathematically, using the [[Kronecker_product#Kronecker_sum_and_exponentiation|Kronecker sum]]: :<math>L = \mathbf{D_{xx}}\oplus\mathbf{D_{yy}}=\mathbf{D_{xx}}\otimes\mathbf{I}+\mathbf{I}\otimes\mathbf{D_{yy}}, \,</math> where <math>\mathbf{D_{xx}} </math> and <math>\mathbf{D_{yy}} </math> are 1D discrete Laplacians in the ''x''- and ''y''-directions, correspondingly, and <math>\mathbf{I} </math> are the identities of appropriate sizes. Both <math>\mathbf{D_{xx}} </math> and <math>\mathbf{D_{yy}} </math> must correspond to the case of the homogeneous [[Dirichlet boundary condition]] at end points of the ''x''- and ''y''-intervals, in order to generate the 2D discrete Laplacian ''L'' corresponding to the homogeneous [[Dirichlet boundary condition]] everywhere on the boundary of the rectangular domain. Here is a sample [[OCTAVE]]/[[MATLAB]] code to compute ''L'' on the regular 10&times;15 2D grid: : nx = 10; % number of grid points in the x-direction; : ny = 15; % number of grid points in the y-direction; : ex = ones(nx,1); ; : Dxx = spdiags([ex -2*ex ex], [-1 0 1], nx, nx); %1D discrete Laplacian in the x-direction ; : ey = ones(ny,1); ' : Dyy = spdiags([ey, -2*ey ey], [-1 0 1], ny, ny); %1D discrete Laplacian in the y-direction ; : L = kron(speye(ny, ny), Dxx) + kron(Dyy, speye(nx, nx)) ; ==[[eigenvalue|Eigenvalues]] and [[eigenvector|eigenvectors]] of multidimensional [[Discrete Laplace operator|discrete Laplacian]] on a [[regular grid]]== Knowing all [[eigenvalue|eigenvalues]] and [[eigenvector|eigenvectors]] of the factors, all [[eigenvalue|eigenvalues]]
