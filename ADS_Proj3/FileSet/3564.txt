The idea of ''prestressing'' was, apparently, familiar to the ancient Rome architects; the tall attic wall of the [[Colosseum]] works as a [[press]] for the wall piers beneath. Tensional prestress appears to be a common property of biological structures, such as cells and the musculoskeletal system, as a natural (law-based) solution that provides form, mechanical stability, and emergence and flow of stimuli/information. [[Tensegrity]] is a possible biological architecture in which pretension is a key property. ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Construction]] [[Category:Structural engineering]] [[es:Estructura pretensada]]</text> </page> <page> <id>29904</id> <title>Prex</title> <text>{{Infobox OS | name = Prex | logo = | screenshot = | caption = | developer = | source_model = [[Open source]] | kernel_type = [[Microkernel]] | supported_platforms = [[x86 architecture|x86]], [[ARM architecture|ARM]], [[PowerPC]] | ui = | family = [[Real-time operating system]]s | released = | latest_release_version = | latest_release_date = | latest_test_version = 0.9.0 | latest_test_date = 1 Oct 2009 | marketing_target = | programmed_in = [[C (programming language)|C]] | prog_language = | language = | updatemodel = | package_manager = | working_state = | license = [[BSD license]] | website = [http://prex.sourceforge.net/ Prex] }} '''Prex''' is a [[Porting|portable]] [[32-bit]] [[embedded operating system|embedded]] [[real-time operating system|real-time]] [[microkernel]] [[operating system]].

Governments intend price ceilings to protect consumers from conditions that could make necessary commodities unattainable. However, a price ceiling can cause problems if imposed for a long period without controlled rationing. Price ceilings can produce negative results when the correct solution would have been to increase supply. Misuse occurs when a government misdiagnoses a price as too high when the real problem is that the [[supply (economics)|supply]] is too low. In a [[market economy]], or pure capitalist political/economic model, price ceilings do not exist. Students may incorrectly perceive a price ceiling as being on top of a supply and demand curve when in fact, an effective price ceiling is positioned below the equilibrium position on the graph. ==Effects of Price Ceilings== ===Binding Versus Non-Binding price ceilings=== A price ceiling can be set above or below the free-market equilibrium price. For a price ceiling to be effective, it must differ from the free market price. In the graph at right, the supply and demand curves intersect to determine the free-market quantity and price. The dashed line represents a price ceiling set above the free-market price, called a ''non-binding price ceiling''. In this case, the ceiling has no practical effect. The government has mandated a maximum price, but the market price is established well below that. In contrast, the solid green line is a price ceiling set below the free market price, called a ''binding price ceiling''. In this case, the price ceiling has a measurable impact on the market. ===Consequences of Binding Price Ceilings=== A price ceiling set below the free-market price has several effects. Suppliers find they can't charge what they had been. As a result, some suppliers drop out of the market. This reduces supply. Meanwhile, consumers find they can now buy the product for less, so quantity demanded increases. These two actions cause quantity demanded to exceed quantity supplied, which causes a [[shortage]]&mdash;unless rationing or other consumption controls are enforced. It can also lead to various forms of non-price competition so supply can meet demand. ====Reduction in quality==== To supply demand at the legal price, the most obvious approach is to lower costs. However, in most cases, lower costs means lower quality. During [[World War II]], for example, food sellers operating under ceilings reduced portion size and used less expensive ingredients (e.g., more fat, flour, etc.). It can also be seen in decreased maintenance of [[rent controll]]ed apartments.<ref>[http://www.palgrave.com/PDFs/0716799561.Pdf Price and Quantity Controls]</ref>. Some scholars, however, doubt that price ceilings necessarily drive quality down in the case of an [[oligopoly]]<ref>[http://extranet.vatt.fi/Iipf2002/members/papers/Hemmasi_Kemnitz.pdf See Hemmasi, Cyrus and Kemnitz, Alexander; '''Price Ceilings and Quality Competition''']</ref>. They argued that with few competing firms selling under a price ceiling, a company at the lower end of the market must find ways to achieve better quality without raising price. ====Black markets==== {{Unreferenced|date=April 2010}} If somebody cannot obtain needed goods because a price ceiling reduces the quantity, they may turn to the [[black market]]. Those who&mdash;by luck or good management&mdash;obtain goods in short supply can [[profit (accounting)|profit]] by illegally selling at a higher price than the free market allows. The black
