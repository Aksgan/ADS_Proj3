Also, any starting number is possible. For example the following sequence can be used to form an order 3 magic square according to the Siamese method (9 boxes): 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 (the magic sum gives 75, for all rows, columns and diagonals). {| class="wikitable" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center;width:6em;height:6em;table-layout:fixed;" ! colspan="3" | Order 3 |- | 40 || '''5''' || 30 |- | 15 || 25 || 35 |- | 20 || 45 || 10 |} ===Other starting points=== It is possible not to start the arithmetic progression from the middle of the top row, but then only the row and column sums will be identical and result in a magic sum, whereas the diagonal sums will differ. The result will thus not be a true magic square: {| class="wikitable" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center;width:6em;height:6em;table-layout:fixed;" ! colspan="3" | Order 3 |- | 500 || 700 || 300 |- | 900 || 200 || 400 |- | '''100''' || 600 || 800 |} ===Rotations and reflexions=== Numerous other magic squares can be deduced from the above by simple [[rotations]] and [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflections]]. ==Variations== A slightly more complicated variation of this method exists in which the first number is placed in the box just above the center box. The fundamental movement for filling the boxes remains '''up and right''' ('''↗'''), one step at a time. However, if a filled box is encountered, one moves vertically '''up two boxes''' instead, then continuing as before. {| class="wikitable" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center;width:10em;height:10em;table-layout:fixed;" ! colspan="5" | Order 5 |- | 23 || 6 || 19 || 2 || 15 |- | 10 || 18 || '''1''' || 14 || 22 |- | 17 || 5 || 13 || 21 || 9 |- | 4 || 12 || 25 || 8 || 16 |- | 11 || 24 || 7 || 20 || 3 |} Numerous variants can be obtained by simple rotations and reflections. The next square is equivalent to the above (a simple reflexion): the first number is placed in the box just below the center box. The fundamental movement for filling the boxes then becomes diagonally '''down and right''' ('''↘'''), one step at a time. If a filled box is encountered, one moves vertically '''down two boxes''' instead, then continuing as before.<ref>[http://dlxs.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=sea;idno=sea130;view=image;seq=259 ''A new historical relation of the kingdom of Siam'' p229]</ref> {| class="wikitable" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center;width:10em;height:10em;table-layout:fixed;" ! colspan="5" | Order 5 |- | 11 || 24 || 7 || 20 || 3 |- | 4 || 12 || 25 || 8 || 16 |- | 17 || 5 || 13 || 21 || 9 |- | 10 || 18 || '''1''' || 14 || 22 |- | 23 || 6 || 19 || 2 || 15 |} These variations, although not quite as simple as the basic Siamese method, are equivalent to the methods developed by earlier European scholars, [[Johann Faulhaber]] (1580&ndash;1635) and [[Claude Gaspard Bachet de Méziriac]] (1581&ndash;1638), and allowed to create magic squares similar to theirs.<ref>[http://dlxs.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=sea;idno=sea130;view=image;seq=259 ''A new historical relation of the kingdom of Siam'' p229]</ref><ref>''The Zen of Magic Squares, Circles, and Stars'' by Clifford A.

It was notable for being a ''[[Terminate and Stay Resident]]'' (TSR) program, which enabled it to load into [[RAM|memory]] then return the computer to the [[DOS]] [[command prompt]], allowing the user to load another application, but still activate SideKick using a [[hot key]] combination (by default: [[Ctrl]]-[[Alt key|Alt]]). This approach allowed instantaneous [[task switching]] in the otherwise-single-tasking DOS [[operating system]]. Although a [[text mode]] program, its window-based interface echoed that of the [[Apple Macintosh]], and anticipated the eventual look of [[Microsoft]] [[Windows 2.0]]. It featured a personal calendar, text editor (with [[WordStar]]-like command interface), calculator, [[ASCII chart]], and address book/phone dialer. According to the Borland [[IPO]] [[Prospectus (finance)|prospectus]], SideKick sold more than one million copies in its first three years. ==DOS versions== ===1.0=== [[Image:Sidekick-plus-1.0.png|thumb|250px|SideKick Plus 1.0 for DOS.]] Sidekick 1.0 included Calculator, Notepad, Appointment Calendar, Auto Dialer, ASCII Table and other tools. ===1.0 Plus=== Sidekick 1.0 Plus included a broader selection of calculators (Business, Scientific, Programmer, Formula), a 9-file Notepad
