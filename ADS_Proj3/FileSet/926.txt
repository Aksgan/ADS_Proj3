the use of criterion based assessment. There are two basic concepts behind constructive alignment: *Learners construct meaning from what they do to learn. This concept derives from [[cognitive psychology]] and [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] theory, and recognizes the importance of linking new material to concepts and experiences in the learner's [[memory]], and extrapolation to possible future scenarios via the abstraction of basic principles through reflection. *The teacher makes a deliberate alignment between the planned learning activities and the learning outcomes. This is a conscious effort to provide the learner with a clearly specified goal, a well designed learning activity or activities that are appropriate for the task, and well designed assessment criteria for giving feedback to the learner. ==References== {{refbegin}} *Biggs, J and Tang C.

They recognize that the damage done by privacy loss is typically not measurable, nor can it be undone, and that commercial organizations have little or no interest in taking unprofitable measures to drastically increase privacy of customers - indeed, their motivation is very often quite the opposite, to share data for commercial advantage, and to fail to officially recognize it as sensitive, so as to avoid legal liability for lapses of security that may occur. Consumer privacy concerns date back to the first commercial couriers and bankers, who in every culture took strong measures to protect customer privacy, but also in every culture tended to be subject to very harsh punitive measures for failures to keep a customer's information private. The [[Hippocratic Oath]] includes a requirement for doctors to avoid mentioning ills of patients to others, not only to protect them, but to protect their families - the same basic idea as modern consumer privacy law and regulation, which recognizes that innocent third parties can be harmed by the loss of control of sensitive information, and that therefore there is a responsibility beyond that to the 'customer' or 'client'. Today the [[ethical code]]s of most professions very clearly specify privacy measures beyond that for the 'consumer' of an arbitrary service. Those measures are discussed in other articles on [[medical privacy]], [[client confidentiality]] and [[national security]] - and to a degree in [[carceral state]] (where no privacy in any form nor limits on [[State (polity)|state]] oversight or data use exist). Modern consumer privacy law in a recognizable form originated in [[telecom regulation]], when it was recognized that a [[Telephone company|telco]], especially a [[monopoly]] (known in most nations as a [[PTT]]), had access to unprecedented levels of information about not only the direct customer's communications habits and correspondents, but also that of those who shared his or her household. It was also often the case that telephone operators could hear conversations, inadvertently or deliberately, and were required to dial the exact numbers. The data gathering required for billing began to become an obvious privacy risk as well. Accordingly, strong rules on operator behavior, customer confidentiality, records keeping and destruction were enforced on telcos in every country. Typically only police and military authorities had powers to 'wiretap' or see records. Even stricter requirements emerged for banks' electronic records - in some countries [[financial privacy]] is a major focus of the economy, and penalties for violating it are severe and criminal penalties applied. In [[Austria]] in the 1990s mere mention of a client's name in a semi-public social setting was enough to earn a junior bank executive a stiff jail sentence. Through the 1970s many other organizations in [[developed nation]]s began to acquire sensitive data, but there were few or no regulations in place to prevent them from sharing or abusing it. Customer trust and goodwill was generally thought to be sufficient in some nations, notably the [[United States]], to ensure protection of truly sensitive data. '[[Caveat emptor]]' applied. But in the 1980s much smaller organizations began to get access to computer hardware and software, and these simply did not have the procedures or personnel or expertise, nor less the time, to take rigorous measures to protect their customers. Meanwhile, via [[target marketing]] and [[rewards programs]], they were acquiring ever more data. Gradually, customer privacy measures alone proved insufficient to deal with the many hazards of corporate data sharing, corporate mergers, employee turnover, theft of hard drives or other data-carrying hardware from work. Talk began to turn to explicit regulation, especially in the [[European Union]], where each nation had laws that were incompatible, e.g. some restricted the collection, some the compilation, and some the dissemination of data, and it was possible to violate anyone's privacy within the EU simply by doing these things from different places in the [[European Common Market]] as it existed before 1992. Through the 1990s the proliferation of [[mobile telecom]] (which typically bills every call), the introduction of [[customer relationship management]] and the use of the [[Internet]] by the public in all [[developed nation]]s, brought the situation to a head, and most countries had to implement strong consumer privacy laws, usually over the objections of business. The [[European Union]] and [[New Zealand]] passed particularly strong laws that were used as a template for more limited laws in [[Australia]] and [[Canada]] and some states of the [[United States]] (where no federal law for consumer privacy exists, although there are requirements specific to banking and telecom privacy).
