Essentially it is a "dispatch" technique on procedures for integrating separately developed data-type (e.g., class) modules, based on the programmers manual setup of dynamic tables for procedure access. In modern object-oriented programming languages it is implemented as [[polymorphism in object-oriented programming|polymorphism]]. ==External links== *[http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-17.html#%_sec_2.4.3 SICP section 2.4.3 on data-directed programming] [[Category:Programming paradigms]] {{Compu-lang-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>9271</id> <title>DataAdapter</title> <text>{{orphan|date=March 2010}} In [[ADO.NET]], a '''DataAdapter''' functions as a bridge between a data source, and a disconnected data class, such as a DataSet.

DataEase was created in the early 1980s by software developers [[Arun Gupta]]<ref>[http://www.iw.com/magazine.php?inc=091500/9.15.00fastforward1.html Internet World Magazine - "An End To Web Coding: Toolmaker Aims For Discipline in App Engineering" by David F. Carr]</ref> and Joseph Busch. The first version of the software was released in 1981 by Software Solutions Inc. The principals sold the company to Sapphire International Corporation of the United Kingdom in 1991. Sapphire continues to develop and market the product. There are two distinct product arcs in DataEase' history: '''DataEase for DOS''' and '''DataEase for Windows'''. == DataEase for DOS == Originally called Datamaster <ref>[http://dataconsultancy.org/__oneclick_uploads/2008/12/dataeasehistory.pdf A Brief History of DataEase]</ref>, DataEase' early hallmark was the ease with which non-programmers found they could rapidly develop useful software applications. DataEase' design emphasized the visual design of screen forms and reports while hiding almost all of the arcane details such as properties of the underlying data structure. In addition, complex data management processes that would typically require a multitude of complex steps to complete with traditional programming tools were handled automatically and transparently as a user made changes to his/her application.<ref>[http://www.probertencyclopaedia.com/browse/GD.HTM The Probert Encyclopedia of Science & Technology entry for DataEase]</ref> For example, when editing an existing form, if the user removed a field, added another, indexed another and changed the data type of yet another, the necessary steps required to reflect those changes in the data structure underlying the form were automatically and non-destructively applied when the form was saved. Report writing was similarly streamlined. The user simply defined access to the desired data using a simple procedural language known as ''DataEase Query Language'' (DQL). A prompting script editor, which permitted any user to instantly create DQL script with no prior knowledge of DQL syntax remains one of DataEase' most overlooked and beneficial features. One was not required to memorize details about the application's components or DQL syntactical construction prior to writing a valid DQL script. === Sample DQL Script === For Employees with (Salary < 50000 and YearsOfService > 4 and LastReviewGrade > 85)<br /> List Records<br /> LastName in order;<br /> FirstName ;<br /> CurrentSalary : item sum ;<br /> CurrentSalary * data-entry EnterRaiseAmount : item sum .<br /> Modify Records<br /> CurrentSalary := CurrentSalary * data-entry EnterRaiseAmount . In addition to simplified definition of data forms, reports and procedures, DataEase for DOS provided facilities for defining an application's user access, navigational menus, multi-format importing of data from other sources, data exporting, data backup and restoration, system documentation and user help, backing up and restoring data and integrating external programs into the application. DataEase for DOS applications provided record-level locking meaning they could be accessed simultaneously by many other
