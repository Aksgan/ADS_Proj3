The FEM was completed and successfully tested at the [[NASA Langley Research Center]] in [[Hampton, Virginia]]. The motivation<ref>[http://members.cox.net/olaf/FEM/FEMhq.jpg FEM photos]</ref> for FEM arose from the merger of two concepts: the [[finite element method]] of [[structural analysis]] and the introduction of relatively low-cost [[microprocessors]]. In the finite element method, the behavior (stresses, strains and displacements resulting from load conditions) of large-scale structures is [[approximate|approximated]] by an FE model consisting of structural elements (members) connected at structural node points. Calculations on traditional computers are performed at each node point and results communicated to adjacent node points until the behavior of the entire structure is computed. On the Finite Element Machine, microprocessors located at each node point<ref>[http://members.cox.net/olaf/FEM/FEMidea.jpg FEM photos]</ref> perform these nodal computations in parallel. If there are more node points (N) than microprocessors (P), then each microprocessor performs N/P computations. The Finite Element Machine contained 32 processor boards<ref>[http://members.cox.net/olaf/FEM/FEMcpu.jpg FEM photos]</ref> each with a [[Texas Instruments TMS9900]] processor, 32 [[Input/Output]] (IO) boards and a TMS99/4 controller. The FEM was conceived and fabricated at NASA Langley Research Center<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/home/index.html NASA - NASA's Langley Research Center<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, [[Hampton, Virginia]]. The TI 9900 processor chip was selected by the NASA team as it was the [[TI99/4A#First domestic computer with a 16-bit processor|first 16-bit processor]] available on the market which until then was limited to less powerful [[8-bit]] processors. The FEM concept was successfully tested to solve beam bending equations on a Langley FEM [[prototype]] (4 IMSAI 8080s<ref>[http://oldcomputers.net/imsai8080.html IMSAI 8080 computer<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>) which led to full-scale FEM fabrication & testing<ref>[http://members.cox.net/olaf/FEM/FEMhw.jpg FEM photos]</ref> by the FEM hardware-software-applications team led by Dr. Olaf O. Storaasli<ref>[http://ft.ornl.gov/~olaf CSM: Computer Science and Mathematics Division<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> formerly of NASA (now at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]]). The first significant Finite Element Machine results are documented in: The Finite Element Machine: An experiment in parallel processing (NASA TM 84514) <ref>[http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?N=0&Ntk=AuthorList&Ntx=mode%20matchall&Ntt=storaasli%2Badams NASA] The Finite Element Machine: An experiment in parallel processing (NASA TM 84514)</ref><p> Based on the Finite Element Machine's success in demonstrating Parallel Computing viability, (alongside [[ILLIAC IV]] and [[Goodyear MPP]]), commercial parallel computers soon emerged on the market. NASA Langley subsequently purchased a Flex/32 Multicomputer (and later [[Intel iPSC]] and [[Intel Paragon]]) to continue parallel finite element [[algorithm]] [[R&D]]. In 1989, the parallel equation solver code, first prototyped on FEM, and tested on FLEX was ported to NASA's first Cray YMP via Force<ref>[http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA211391 The Force on the Flex: Global Parallelism and Portability<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> (Fortran for Concurrent Execution) to reduce the structural analysis computation time for the space shuttle Challenger Solid Rocket Booster resdesign with 54,870 equations from 14 hours to 6 seconds.

FPM models problems in [[continuum mechanics]]. The method solves not only fluid flows, but also problems with [[elastic deformation|elastic]] or [[plastic deformation]]s. More generally spoken, FPM considers all the viscous as well as elastic/plastic [[stress tensor]]s, and any mixture of it. ==Description== FPM is a [[meshfree method]]. The basis of the computations is a [[point cloud]], which represents the continuum or in other words a continuum domain (fluid or solid) is replaced by a discrete number of points, which are referred to as finite points. Each finite point carries all fluid information, like density, velocity, pressure, temperature. Finite points can move with fluid velocity (Lagrangian approach) or the flow information runs through the finite points if they are located constant in space (Eulerian approach). Also a mixture approach (Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian ALE) is possible. This is useful in case of using the Eulerian approach in combination with free surfaces or moving parts. Therefore, finite points themselves can be considered as geometrical grids of the fluid domain. The finite point density is prescribed by a smoothing length defined locally. FPM does not use a rigid neighbourhood list for a certain finite point as it is required in a mesh based method. All neighbours are
