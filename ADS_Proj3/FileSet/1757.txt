capture is important, because it prevents a large group of stones from being captured for instance, the player may play a ''ko threat''.<ref name="Ko"/> This is a move elsewhere on the board that threatens to make a large profit if the opponent does not respond. If the opponent does respond to the ko threat, the situation on the board has changed, and the prohibition on capturing the ko no longer applies. Thus the player who made the ko threat may now recapture the ko. Their opponent is then in the same situation and can either play a ko threat as well, or concede the ko by simply playing elsewhere. If a player concedes the ko, either because they do not think it important or because there are no moves left that could function as a ko threat, they have ''lost'' the ko, and their opponent may connect the ko. Instead of responding to a ko threat, a player may also choose to ''ignore'' the threat and connect the ko.<ref name="Ko"/> They thereby win the ko, but at a cost. The choice of when to respond to a threat and when to ignore it is a subtle one, which requires a player to consider many factors, including how much is gained by connecting, how much is lost by not responding, how many possible ko threats both players have remaining, what the optimal order of playing them is, and what the ''size''—points lost or gained—of each of the remaining threats is. Frequently, the winner of the ko fight does not connect the ko but instead captures one of the chains that constituted their opponent's side of the ko.<ref name="Ko"/> In some cases, this leads to another ko fight at a neighboring location. ==Strategy== {{main|Go strategy and tactics}} <div class="thumb tright"> <div class="thumbinner" style="width:266px; font-size: 100%;"> {{Goban|= 19 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |= 18 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |= 17 | | | | | | | | | | | |b|w|w|b| | | | |= 16 | | | |w| | | | | |x| | |w|b| |b| | | |= 15 | | | | | | | | | | | | | |b| | |b| | |= 14 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |w|w| | |= 13 | | |w| | | | | | | | | | |w| | | | | |= 12 | | | |b| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |= 11 | | |w|b| | | | | | | | | | | | |w| | |= 10 | | |w|b| | | | | |x| | | | | |b|b| | |= 9 | | |w| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |= 8 | | | |b| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |= 7 | | |w| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |= 6 | | | | |b| | | | | | | | | | | | | | |= 5 | | | |b| | |b| | | | | | | | | |b| | |= 4 | | |b|x| |w|w|w| |x| | | | | |x| | | |= 3 | | |b|w| | | | | | |w| | | | |b| | | |= 2 | | |w| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |= 1 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |= |14}} <div class="thumbcaption" style="font-size: 88%;"> Game 1 of the 2002 LG Cup final between Choe Myeong-hun (White) and [[Lee Sedol]] (Black) at the end of the opening stage; White has developed a great deal of potential territory, while Black has emphasized central influence. </div> </div> </div> Strategy deals with global influence, interaction between distant stones, keeping the whole board in mind during local fights, and other issues that involve the overall game. It is therefore possible to allow a tactical loss when it confers a strategic advantage. Go is not easy to play well. With each new level (rank) comes a deeper appreciation for the subtlety and nuances involved and for the insight of stronger players. The acquisition of major concepts of the game comes slowly. Novices often start by randomly placing stones on the board, as if it were a game of chance; they inevitably lose to experienced players who know how to create effective formations. An understanding of how stones connect for greater power develops, and then a few basic [[go opening theory|common opening sequences]] may be understood. Learning the ways of life and death helps in a fundamental way to develop one's strategic understanding of ''weak groups''. <ref name=LifeDeath group="nb">Whether or not a group is weak or strong refers to the ease with which it can be killed or made to live. See this [http://senseis.xmp.net/?BenjaminTeuber%2FGuideToBecomeStrong:v52 article] by Benjamin Teuber, amateur 6 dan, for some views on how important this is felt to be.</ref> It is necessary to play thousands of games before one can get close to one's ultimate potential skill level in Go. A player who both plays aggressively and can handle adversity is said to display ''[[kiai]]'', or fighting spirit, in the game. Familiarity with the board shows first the tactical importance of the edges, and then the efficiency of developing in the corners first, then sides, then center. The more advanced beginner understands that territory and influence are somewhat interchangeable—but there needs to be a balance. This intricate struggle of power and control makes
