telegrams. Although [[electric telegraph]]y made the system obsolete for military use, simplified [[semaphore]]s were still used for [[railway semaphore signal|railway signals]]. ==Historical background== At the time of construction of the [[Prussia]]n semaphore system, the technology had already been known for thirty years. It was based on earlier designs by [[Claude Chappe]] and his brother which were in use in [[France]] on many telegraph lines from 1794. Soon [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], and [[England]] also had working optical telegraph systems while couriers remained in use throughout Germany. The states that existed in German-speaking areas at the end of the 18th century were uninterested in a communications system that crossed multiple borders and the political conditions did not exist to put the necessary treaties and agreements in place among these states. Countries such as Sweden, England and France had the necessary centralized control for such a project, and they confronted political, military and economic challenges such as securing long coastlines, and controlling sea routes. They were therefore far more motivated to build an advanced communications network. Prussia was at that time the second largest German state in terms of area and it saw no structural or political necessity for the introduction of telegraphy after the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1814-1815. Plans for the construction of a first telegraph line were delayed by resistance from the conservative [[Prussian Army|Prussian military]], even when the usefulness of mobile telegraphy in war is taken into account. It was exactly this technology that was used with success by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and this at least awakened the interest of the Prussian military. However, Prussia was confronted with a fragile domestic political situation in its western provinces at the beginning of the 1830s. Nobles and liberals from the [[Rhine]] region were opposed to the administration in Berlin. They were strengthened in their movement for a national constitution by the [[July Revolution]] in France and the [[Belgian Revolution|revolution in Belgium]] in 1830. In this time of turmoil, urgent official messages traveled slowly by courier on horseback. This was unsatisfactory to the Prussian military, therefore, the proponents of a telegraph network could finally execute a plan for a line from Berlin to Koblenz via Cologne. The technical idea and the initiative to build the then longest telegraph line in central Europe came from the [[Geheimrat|Geheime Postrat]] Carl Philipp Heinrich Pistor. Pistor wrote a [[memorandum]] to the [[Prussian General Staff]] in December 1830 which laid out a draft proposal for a telegraph line within the Royal Prussian States. Pistor’s ideas were inspired by the Englishman [[Bernard L. Watson]] whose designs were based on the “Second Polygrammatic Telegraph” of [[William Pasley]]. The design went back to 1810 and consisted of a mast with six telegraph arms. Pistor took the six-arm principle and thoroughly reworked the mechanics of the construction. Further, his workshop developed the optical telescopes which were a necessary component of the system. The order for the construction of the system was finally given by an order of the [[German Imperial Military Cabinet|Prussian Cabinet]] on July 21, 1832. The Prussian system remained the only state-run optical telegraph system within German territory. There were also a couple of examples of privately-run systems. The first existed between 1837 and 1850 and was created by the [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] businessman Johann Ludwig Schmidt who operated it as a signal system for ships between the mouth of the [[Elbe]] at [[Cuxhaven]] and [[Port of Hamburg]]. From 1841, this system was run by [[Friedrich Clemens Gerke]], a pioneer in telegraphy for whom the modern [[Friedrich-Clemens-Gerke Tower|telecommunications tower]] in Cuxhaven is named. The second, also created by Schmidt was inaugurated in 1847. This system ran between [[Bremen]] and [[Bremerhaven]], but this second system was taken out of service by 1852 because a competing [[electric telegraph]] line that was placed into service at almost the same time. ==Construction and Function== As with later telegraph operations, the responsibility for the construction of the entire system fell to the Prussian Military. Major [[Franz August O'Etzel]] led the construction. O'Etzel studied in Berlin and Paris and trained as pharmacist. He knew the [[Rhineland]] as he had previously done survey work in the region. Along with the construction, O'Etzel also concerned himself with the necessary codes for transmitting messages. He wrote the [[codebook]]s for the line. Once construction was complete, he was given the title of “Director of the Royal Prussian Telegraph” and he oversaw the operations of the entire system. ===Route=== The line began with Station #1 at the old [[Berlin Observatory]] in Dorotheenstrasse. The construction of the first section – with fourteen stations – was completed by November 1832. The route ran via the Telegraphenberg in [[Potsdam]] across [[Brandenburg an der Havel]] to [[Magdeburg]]. The locations of the stations were chosen by O'Etzel himself. In choosing, he took into consideration of existing structures - for example the village church in [[Dahlem]]. He also had his team construct towers on existing tall buildings. In many places along the route, trees had to be felled or have their tops cut off in order to maintain the sight lines between stations. French telegraph operators had already recognized that signals were hard to recognize if they came from stations placed before certain backgrounds, while signals from stations against an open sky were much easier to recognize. For this reason, the Prussian stations were built on higher ground where necessary. Later, such places were often designated as “Telegrafenberg” as with [[Glidow]] (station #5) or station #13 southeast of [[Biederitz]]. Because the receipt and distribution of messages was intended only for dispatch stations at the beginning and end of the line, no great value was placed on connecting smaller localities and cities. Frequently, stations were placed away from settled areas. The last station of the first section was constructed on the tower of the [[Magdeburg#Other sights|Johannis-Kirche]] in [[Magdeburg]]. To hasten construction of the second and longer section between Magdeburg and Koblenz, the finance minister as well as the interior minister ordered all their subordinates to offer their total cooperation to
