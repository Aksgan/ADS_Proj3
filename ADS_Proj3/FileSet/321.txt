<page> <id>2738</id> <title>Audio Engineering Society</title> <text>Established in 1948, the '''Audio Engineering Society''' (AES) draws its membership from amongst engineers, scientists, other individuals with an interest or involvement in the [[professional audio]] industry. The membership largely comprises engineers developing devices or products for audio, as well as persons working in audio content production, but also includes acousticians, audiologists, academics, and other disciplines related to audio. The AES is the only world-wide professional society devoted exclusively to audio technology. The organisation develops, reviews and publishes engineering standards for the audio and related media industries, and produces the '''AES Conventions''', which are held twice a year alternating between Europe and the USA. The AES and individual regional or national "Sections" also hold AES Conferences on different topics during the year. The AES publishes a peer-reviewed journal, the ''Journal of the Audio Engineering Society'' (JAES). ==History== The idea of a society dedicated solely to audio engineering had been discussed for some time before the first meeting, but was first proposed in print in a letter by Frank E. Sherry, of Victoria, Texas, in the December 1947 issue of the magazine ''Audio Engineering''. A New York engineer, C.J. LeBel, then published a letter in response the following month asking for interested persons to contact him. What came to be the AES was formed at an organizational meeting at RCA Victor Studios in New York City on February 17, 1948. Its first membership meeting followed on March 11, drawing primarily from the area's broadcast and recording operations. The guest speaker at the first meeting was [[Harry F. Olson]], a prominent engineer and scientist at [[RCA]] and author of ''[[Acoustical Engineering]]''. From its New York beginnings the AES grew world-wide and as of 31 October 2010 comprised 14215 members, 4306 of whom are classified as students. ==AES Standards== The AES publishes a number of standards on the subject of both analog and digital audio recording, transmission, and/or reproduction. Notable standards include: * [[AES3]] (also commonly known as AES/EBU) for digital audio interconnection * [[AES10]] (also commonly known as MADI) for multichannel digital audio interconnection * [[AES11]] for digital audio synchronization * [[AES47]] for sending AES3 digital audio data over [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] networks. * [[AES48]] on interconnections; grounding and EMC practices; and shields of connectors in audio eqipment containing active circuitry. * [[AES53]] for assigning absolute times to the time markers provided by AES47. ==AES Gold Medal recipients== The AES Gold Medal is the Society's highest honor, and given in recognition of outstanding achievements, sustained over a period of years, in the field of Audio Engineering. The award was established in 1971; it was formerly known as the John H. Potts Memorial Award.<ref>[http://www.aes.org/awards/nominations/guidelines.cfm About the Audio Engineering Society.
