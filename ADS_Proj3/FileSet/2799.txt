Descent), each providing about a ton of force (10 [[kilonewton]]s) for about 4 seconds; * Three small solid rockets called TIRS (mounted so that they aim horizontally out the sides of the backshell) that provide a small horizontal kick to the backshell to help orient the backshell more vertically during the main RAD rocket burn. ====Composition==== Built by the [[Lockheed Martin]] Astronautics Co. in Denver, Colorado, the aeroshell is made of an aluminium honeycomb structure sandwiched between [[graphite-epoxy]] face sheets. The outside of the aeroshell is covered with a layer of [[phenol]]ic honeycomb. This honeycomb is filled with an [[ablation|ablative]] material (also called an "ablator"), that dissipates heat generated by atmospheric friction. The ablator itself is a unique blend of [[Cork (material)|cork]] [[wood]], [[binder]] and many tiny [[silica]] glass spheres. It was invented for the heat shields flown on the Viking Mars lander missions. A similar technology was used in the first US [[manned space mission]]s [[Mercury program|Mercury]], [[Gemini program|Gemini]] and [[Apollo program|Apollo]]. It was specially formulated to react chemically with the Martian atmosphere during entry and carry heat away, leaving a hot wake of gas behind the vehicle. The vehicle slowed from 19000 [[Kilometres per hour|km/h]] (about 12000 [[Miles per hour|mph]]) to about 1600 km/h (1000 mph) in about a minute, producing about 60 m/s² (6 [[g-force|''g'']]) of [[acceleration]] on the lander and rover. The backshell and heat shield are made of the same materials, but the heat shield has a thicker, 1/2 [[inch]] (12.7 mm), layer of the ablator. Instead of being painted, the backshell was covered with a very thin aluminized [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]] blanket to protect it from the cold of deep space. The blanket vaporized during entry into the Martian atmosphere. ===Parachute=== [[Image:Parachute1.jpg|thumb|right|Mars Exploration Rover's parachute test]] The parachute helped slow the spacecraft during entry, descent, and landing. It is located in the backshell.<ref name="nasa_expl_rover_mission">{{Cite web| url = http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/mission/spacecraft_edl_parachute.html | title = Mars Exploration Rover Mission: The Mission | publisher = nasa.gov | accessdate = September 2007}}</ref> ====Design==== The 2003 parachute design was part of a long-term Mars parachute technology development effort and is based on the designs and experience of the Viking and Pathfinder missions. The parachute for this mission is 40% larger than Pathfinder's because the largest load for the Mars Exploration Rover is 80 to 85 [[newton (units)|kilonewton]]s (kN) or 18,000 to {{convert|19000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} when the parachute fully inflates. By comparison, Pathfinder's inflation loads were approximately 35 kN (about 8,000 lbf). The parachute was designed and constructed in [[South Windsor, Connecticut]] by [[Pioneer Aerospace]], the company that also designed the parachute for the ''[[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]]'' mission.<ref name="nasa_expl_rover_mission"/> ====Composition==== The parachute is made of two durable, lightweight fabrics: [[polyester]] and [[nylon]]. A triple bridle made of [[Kevlar]] connects the parachute to the backshell. The amount of space available on the spacecraft for the parachute is so small that the parachute had to be pressure-packed. Before launch, a team tightly folded the 48 suspension lines, three bridle lines, and the parachute. The parachute team loaded the parachute in a special structure that then applied a heavy weight to the parachute package several times. Before placing the parachute into the backshell, the parachute was heat set to [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilize]] it.<ref name="nasa_expl_rover_mission"/> ====Connected systems==== [[Image:Rocket assisted descent.jpg|right|thumb|Descent is halted by [[retrorocket]]s and lander is dropped 10m (30 ft) to the surface in this computer generated impression.]] '''Zylon Bridles''': After the parachute was deployed at an altitude of about 10 km (6 miles) above the surface, the heatshield was released using 6 separation nuts and push-off springs. The lander then separated from the backshell and "rappelled" down a metal tape on a [[centrifugal brake|centrifugal braking system]] built into one of the lander petals. The slow descent down the metal tape placed the lander in position at the end of another bridle (tether), made of a nearly 20 m (65 ft) long braided [[Zylon]].<ref name="nasa_expl_rover_mission"/> Zylon is an advanced fiber material, similar to Kevlar, that is sewn in a webbing pattern (like shoelace material) to make it stronger. The Zylon bridle provides space for airbag deployment, distance from the solid rocket motor exhaust stream, and increased stability. The bridle incorporates an electrical harness that allows the firing of the solid rockets from the backshell as well as provides data from the backshell inertial measurement unit (which measures rate and tilt of the spacecraft) to the flight computer in the rover.<ref name="nasa_expl_rover_mission"/> '''Rocket assisted descent (RAD)''' motors: Because the atmospheric density of Mars is less than 1% of Earth's, the parachute alone could not slow down the Mars Exploration Rover enough to ensure a safe, low landing speed. The spacecraft descent was assisted by rockets that brought the spacecraft to a dead stop 10–15 m (30–50 ft) above the Martian surface.<ref name="nasa_expl_rover_mission"/> '''Radar altimeter unit''': A [[radar]] [[altimeter]] unit was used to determine the distance to the Martian surface. The radar's antenna is mounted at one of the lower corners of the lander tetrahedron. When the radar measurement showed the lander was the correct distance above the surface, the Zylon bridle was cut, releasing the lander from the parachute and backshell so that it was free and clear for landing. The radar data also enabled the timing sequence on airbag inflation and backshell RAD rocket firing.<ref name="nasa_expl_rover_mission"/> ===Airbags=== [[Image:Airbags.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's concept of inflated airbags]] [[Airbag]]s used in the Mars Exploration Rover mission are the same type that Mars Pathfinder used in 1997. They had to be strong enough to cushion the spacecraft if it landed on rocks or rough terrain and allow it to bounce across Mars' surface at freeway speeds after landing. The airbags had to be inflated seconds before touchdown and deflated once safely on the ground. The airbags were made of [[Vectran]], like those on Pathfinder. Vectran has almost twice the strength of other synthetic materials, such as Kevlar, and performs better in cold temperatures. Six 100 [[Denier (measure)|denier]] (10 mg/m) layers of Vectran protected one or two inner bladders of Vectran in 200 denier (20
