When comparing to the consumer storage, it has higher [[scalability]], higher [[Reliability engineering|reliability]], better [[fault tolerance]], and much higher initial price. From the [[salesperson]]'s point of view, the four main enterprise storage [[market]]s are: * [[computer storage|Online storage]] - large [[disk array]] solutions, minimizing [[access time]] to the data, and maximizing reliability; * [[Backup]] - off-line storage for data protection, with a smaller price per byte than online storage, but at a cost of higher average access time; often uses [[sequential access]] storage, such as [[tape library|tape libraries]]; * [[archive|Archiving]] - technically similar to [[backup]], but its purpose is long-term retention, management, and discovery of fixed-content data to meet regulatory compliance, litigation protection, and storage cost optimization objectives; * [[Disaster recovery]] solutions, used to protect the data from localized [[disaster]]s, usually being a vital part of broader [[business continuity plan]]. The enterprise storage industry includes conferences ([http://storagedecisions.techtarget.com/ Storage Decisions], [http://www.snwusa.com/ Storage Networking World], etc.), publications ([http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/ Storage Magazine], [http://infostor.com/ InfoStor], etc.), and companies ([[3PAR]], [[Atempo]], [[Iron Mountain Incorporated|Iron Mountain]], [[Isilon]], [[EMC Corporation|EMC]], [[DELL]], [[Hewlett Packard|HP]], [[Hitachi Data Systems]], [[IBM]], [[Microsoft]], [[NetApp]], [[Novell]], [[Open-E]], [[Pillar Data Systems]], [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Symantec]]/[[Veritas Software]], etc.). {{DEFAULTSORT:Enterprise Storage}} [[Category:Computer storage]] {{compu-storage-stub}} [[pt:Armazenamento corporativo]]</text> </page> <page> <id>12275</id> <title>Entitative graph</title> <text>An '''entitative [[graph (mathematics)|graph]]''' is an element of the [[graph theory|graphical]] [[syntax]] for [[logic]] that [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] developed under the name of '''qualitative logic''' beginning in the 1880's, taking the coverage of the [[formal system|formalism]] only as far as the [[propositional calculus|propositional or sentential]] aspects of logic are concerned. See 3.468, 4.434, and 4.564 in Peirce's ''Collected Papers''. The [[syntax]] is: *The blank page; *Single letters, phrases; *Objects (subgraphs) enclosed by a [[simple closed curve]] called a ''cut''. A cut can be empty. The [[semantics]] are: *The blank page denotes '''False'''; *Letters, phrases, subgraphs, and entire graphs can be '''True''' or '''False'''; *To surround objects with a cut is equivalent to Boolean [[Complement (mathematics)|complementation]]. Hence an empty cut denotes '''Truth'''; *All objects within a given cut are tacitly joined by [[disjunction]]. A "proof" manipulates a graph, using a short list of rules, until the graph is reduced to an empty cut or the blank page. A graph that can be so reduced is what is now called a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] (or the complement thereof). Graphs that cannot be simplified beyond a certain point are analogues of the [[satisfiable]] [[formula]]s of [[first-order logic]]. Peirce soon abandoned the entitative graphs for the [[existential graph]]s, whose sentential (''alpha'') part is [[dual]] to the entitative graphs. He developed the existential graphs until they became another formalism for what are now termed [[first-order logic]] and [[normal modal logic]]. The [[Laws of form|primary algebra]] of [[G. Spencer-Brown]] is isomorphic to the entitative graphs. ==References== * [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce, C.S.]], ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce]]'', Vols. 1–6, [[Charles Hartshorne]] and [[Paul Weiss (philosopher)|Paul Weiss]] (eds.), Vols. 7–8, Arthur W.
