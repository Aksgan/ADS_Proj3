home market inspired competitive [[home computer]]s such as the [[Commodore VIC-20|VIC-20]] (1980) and [[Commodore 64]] (1982, with estimated sales between 17 and 25 million units). Through their significantly lower price point, these models introduced the computer to several tens of millions more home users. The success of the Apple II in business spurred [[IBM]] to create the [[IBM PC]], which was then purchased by middle managers in all lines of business to run spreadsheet and word processing software, at first ported from Apple II versions; later, whole new application software dynasties would be founded on the PC. The popularity of these PCs and their [[IBM PC compatible|clones]] then transformed business again with [[local area network|LAN]] applications such as [[e-mail]] and later Internet applications such as [[Usenet]] and the [[World Wide Web|WWW]]. One valuable lesson from the Apple II was the importance of an open architecture to the success of a computer platform. The first Apple II's shipped with an ''Apple II Reference Manual'' containing a complete schematic of the entire computer's circuitry and a complete source listing of the "Monitor" ROM firmware that served as the machine's [[BIOS]] (later this guide had to be purchased separately, and in the case of the Apple II<small>GS</small>, the full technical documentation ran to several volumes). The Apple II's slots, allowing any peripheral card to take control of the bus and directly access memory, enabled an independent industry of card manufacturers who together created a flood of hardware products that let users build systems that were far more powerful and useful (at a lower cost) than any competing system, most of which were not nearly as expandable and were universally proprietary. Even the game port was unusually powerful and could be used for digital and analog input and output; one hacker ([[Don Lancaster]]) used it to drive a [[LaserWriter]] printer. Apple decided not to create an open architecture with the initial [[Macintosh]] models, and this is widely seen as having hobbled its success. It wasn't until the advent of the open architecture [[Macintosh II]] that the platform took off. However, the [[IBM PC]] provides an object lesson that success for the platform does not necessarily equate to success for the company that invented it. In the end, the IBM PC's off-the-shelf, open architecture allowed [[IBM PC compatible|clones]] to be manufactured by startup competitors such as [[Compaq]], [[Dell]] and [[Gateway Computers|Gateway]], leading to a [[Pyrrhic victory]] for IBM. In December 2004, IBM confirmed it had sold its personal computer division including all computer models and technology to [[Lenovo]] in the [[People's Republic of China]] for US$1.75 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6666170/|title=IBM sells PC business to China's Lenovo - Gadgets - MSNBC.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/3444981|title=IBM Sells PC Business to Lenovo}}</ref> ==Timeline of Apple II Family models== {{See also|Timeline of Apple II Family}} {{Timeline of Apple II Family models|headerextension==}} {{See also|Timeline of Apple Macintosh models|Timeline of Apple products}} ==See also== *[[List of Apple II application software]] *[[List of Apple II games]] *[[List of computer system emulators]] *[[List of Apple IIGS games|List of Apple II<small>GS</small> games]] *[[Apple II peripheral cards]] *[[Apple II graphics]] *[[Steve Wozniak]] *[[Jerry Manock]] *[[Apple Industrial Design Group]] *[[Juiced.GS]] — The last remaining Apple II publication *ReactiveMicro.com — Partnered with UltimateApple2 as the last remaining Apple II hardware production companies (cloned items) *[[List of publications and periodicals devoted to Apple II]] *[[Hayes Microcomputer Products]] *[[List of BBS software]] — For the Apple II and other machines ==References== {{reflist|2}} *{{cite news|last=Wozniak|first=Steve|authorlink=Steve Wozniak|title=System Description: The Apple II|work=[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]]|date=May 1977|url=http://oldcomputers.net/byteappleII.html}} ==External links== {{Commons category|Apple II}} *{{dmoz|Computers/Systems/Apple/Apple_II|Apple II}} *[http://www.apple2history.org/ Steven Weyhrich's Apple II History] *[http://www.apple2history.org/history/appy/ahc.html Apple II Timeline] Genealogy table from Steven Weyhrich's Apple II History *[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mressl/a2dp The Apple II Documentation Project] Documentation on the Apple II line and its peripherals *[http://www.a2central.com/ A2Central.com] - Apple II news and downloads *[http://www.oldcomputermuseum.com/apple_2plus.html Old computer museum - Apple II+] *[http://www.apple2.org/ Apple2.org] - The Apple II in Pictures and the Marinetti Open Source Project (TCP/IP Stack) *[http://www.gno.org/a2archive/ GNO Apple II Archive] - A public repository of software for the Apple II *[http://www.reactivemicro.com/ ReactiveMicro.com] - An Apple II hardware production company (cloned items) *[http://16sector.com/ 16Sector.com] Apple II hardware production - FocusDrive and SiriusRAM GS. *[http://www.syndicomm.com/apple2/gsoft/ GSoft BASIC] GSoft BASIC is Applesoft BASIC replacement for Apple IIGS computer *[http://bob-bishop.awardspace.com/softlist.html Software written by Apple-II pioneer, Bob Bishop] - (Including the ''very '''first''' four Hi-Res graphics games'' ever written for the Apple) *[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3527/a_history_of_gaming_platforms_the_.php Gamasutra on the Apple II] A History of Gaming Platforms: The Apple II by Bill Loguidice and Matt Barton *[http://www.8bit-museum.de/?page=docs/apple3b.htm PCB pictures of the Apple II] *[http://virtualgs.larwe.com/ Virtual GS] Apple IIGS programming site, for PC and Mac users running Apple IIGS emulation *[http://www.virtualapple.org/ Virtual Apple II] - Almost every Apple II and IIgs game ever made, ready to play in your browser *[http://pagesperso-orange.fr/gtello/a2e_e.htm WEB page of an Apple IIe user] Some cards detailed and programs to download. *[http://www.vintagemacworld.com/itt2020.html ITT 2020] licensed clone of Apple II *[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrB-z1-9Kz4 Old footage filmed in 1992] by Alfred DiBlasi of an Apple II visualizing music fed in through the cassette port *[http://www.revergestudios.com/reblog/index.php?n=ReCode.CALL-151 The Apple II disk controller bootstrapping routine] that fit in less than 256 bytes in ROM *[http://www.apple2online.com Apple2Online.com] Free public-access library of Apple II software, games, documentation, hardware photos, etc. *[https://ultimateapple2.com/ UltimateApple2.com] — Partnered with ReactiveMicro as Apple II hardware production companies (cloned items) *[http://ip.com/patent/US4136359 Microcomputer for use with video display] The first Apple patent applied for and second granted (to [[Stephen G.
