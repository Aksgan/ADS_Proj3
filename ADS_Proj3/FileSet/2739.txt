MUSCL stands for ''Monotone Upstream-centered Schemes for Conservation Laws'', and the term was introduced in a seminal paper by [[Bram van Leer]] (van Leer, 1979). In this paper he constructed the first ''high-order'', ''[[total variation diminishing]]'' (TVD) scheme where he obtained second order spatial accuracy. The idea is to replace the piecewise constant approximation of [[Godunov's scheme]] by reconstructed states, derived from cell-averaged states obtained from the previous time-step. For each cell, slope limited, reconstructed left and right states are obtained and used to calculate fluxes at the cell boundaries (edges). These fluxes can, in turn, be used as input to a ''[[Riemann solver]]'', following which the solutions are averaged and used to advance the solution in time. Alternatively, the fluxes can be used in ''Riemann-free-solver'' schemes, such as the ''Kurganov and Tadmor scheme'' outlined below. ==Linear reconstruction== [[Image:StepFirstOrdUpwind.png|thumb|1D advective equation <math>u_t+u_x=0</math>, with step wave propagating to the right.

Shows the analytical solution along with a simulation based upon a first order upwind spatial discretization scheme.]] We will consider the fundamentals of the MUSCL scheme by considering the following simple first-order, scalar, 1D system, which is assumed to have a wave propagating in the positive direction, :<math>u_t + F_x\left(u \right)=0 .</math> Where <math>u \ </math> represents a state variable and <math>F \ </math> represents a [[flux]] variable. The basic scheme of Godunov uses piecewise constant approximations for each cell, and results in a first-order upwind discretisation of the above problem with cell centres indexed as <math> i </math>. A semi-discrete scheme can be defined as follows, :<math>\frac{d u_i}{d t} + \frac{1}{\Delta x_i} \left[ F \left( u_{i + 1} \right) - F \left( u_{i} \right) \right] =0 </math>. This basic scheme is not able to handle shocks or sharp discontinuities as they tend to become smeared. An example of this effect is shown in the diagram opposite, which illustrates a 1D advective equation with a step wave propagating to the right. The simulation was carried out with a mesh of 200 cells and used a 4th order [[Runge-Kutta]] time integrator (RK4). To provide higher resolution of discontinuities, Godunov's scheme can be extended to use piecewise linear approximations of each cell, which results in a ''central difference'' scheme that is ''second-order'' accurate in space. The piecewise linear approximations are obtained from :<math> u \left( x \right) = u_{i} + \frac{\left( x - x_{i} \right) }{ \left( x_{i+1} - x_{i} \right)} \left( u_{i+1} - u_{i} \right) , x \in \left[ x_{i}, x_{i+1} \right]</math>. Thus, evaluating fluxes at the cell edges we get the following semi-discrete scheme :<math>\frac{d u_i}{d t} + \frac{1}{\Delta x_i} \left[ F \left( u_{i + \frac{1}{2}} \right) - F \left( u_{i - \frac{1}{2}} \right) \right] =0 </math>, [[Image:stepSecOrdCentralDifference.png|thumb|1D advective equation <math>u_t+u_x=0</math>, with step wave propagating to the right.

Shows the analytical solution along with a simulation based upon a second order, central difference spatial discretization scheme.]] where <math> u_{i + \frac{1}{2}} </math> and <math> u_{i - \frac{1}{2}} </math> are the piecewise approximate values of cell edge variables, i.e. :<math> u_{i + \frac{1}{2}} = 0.5 \left( u_{i} + u_{i + 1} \right) </math>, :<math> u_{i - \frac{1}{2}} = 0.5 \left( u_{i-1} + u_{i} \right) </math>. Although the above second-order scheme provides greater accuracy for smooth solutions, it is not a [[total variation diminishing]] (TVD) scheme and introduces spurious oscillations into the solution where discontinuities or shocks are present. An example of this effect is shown in the diagram opposite, which illustrates a 1D advective equation <math>\, u_t+u_x=0 </math>, with a step wave propagating to the right. This loss of accuracy is to be expected due to [[Godunov's theorem]]. The simulation was carried out with a mesh of 200 cells and used RK4 for time integration.
