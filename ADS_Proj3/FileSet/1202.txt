Session instances. DirectSound runs in emulation mode on the Microsoft software mixer. The emulator does not have hardware abstraction, so there is no hardware DirectSound acceleration, meaning hardware and software relying on DirectSound acceleration may have degraded performance. It's likely a supposed performance hit might not be noticeable, depending on the application and actual system hardware. In the case of hardware [[3D audio effect]]s played using DirectSound3D, they will not be playable. Third-party APIs such as [[Audio stream input output|ASIO]] and [[OpenAL]] are not affected by these architectural changes in Windows Vista. A solution for applications that wish to take advantage of hardware accelerated high-quality 3D positional audio is to use OpenAL. However, this only works if the manufacturer provides an OpenAL driver for their hardware.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.openal.org/openal_vista.html |title=OpenAL and Windows Vista |accessdate=2008-01-10}}</ref> As of 2007, a solution to re-enable hardware acceleration of DirectSound3D and Audio Effects, such as EAX, called ''Creative ALchemy'' was launched<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soundblaster.com/alchemy/ |title=Creative ALchemy website |accessdate=2008-12-23}}</ref>. Creative ALchemy intercepts calls to DirectSound3D and translates them into OpenAL calls to be processed by supported hardware such as [[Sound Blaster X-Fi]] and [[Sound Blaster Audigy]]. For software-based Creative audio solutions, ALchemy utilizes its built-in 3D audio engine without using OpenAL at all. [[Realtek]], a manufacturer of integrated [[Intel High Definition Audio|HD audio codecs]], has a product similar to ALchemy called 3D SoundBack. [[C-Media]], a manufacturer of PC [[sound card]] chipsets, also has a solution called Xear3D EX, although it works instead by intercepting DirectSound3D calls transparently in the background without any user intervention. ==XAudio 2== Because of [[Xbox 360]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] integration, Microsoft is actively pushing developers to migrate new applications to equivalent Xbox audio APIs such as XAudio and the [[Cross-platform Audio Creation Tool]] (XACT). XAudio is an Xbox-only API designed for digital signal processing, however, XAudio 2 is a cross-platform (Windows and Xbox) common low-level audio API, intended as the replacement for DirectSound.<ref>[http://download.microsoft.com/download/c/7/a/c7ab95ad-a23d-436a-9f06-faf06206c280/The%20Future%20of%20Audio%20on%20Windows%20and%20Xbox%20360.zip Game Developers Conference: Future of audio on Windows and Xbox]</ref> The RTM version of the XAudio 2 library is included in the March 2008 DirectX SDK.<ref>[http://connect.microsoft.com/XAudio2Beta The XAudio 2 Beta Program is being retired!]</ref> The target platforms include [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Vista]] and the Xbox 360. XAudio 2 provides low-level mixing and signal processing whereas high-level audio authoring and playback are available using XACT and 3D functions via the X3DAudio library. The XACT engine is a high-level audio [[programming library]] that operates through XAudio on the Xbox, as a DirectSound passthrough on [[Windows XP]], and directly on the low-level audio renderer in the [[Technical features new to Windows Vista#Audio|new audio stack]] on [[Windows Vista]]. X3DAudio is an abstracted math-driven spatialization helper library that can be replaced by custom 3D behaviors.<ref>[http://connect.microsoft.com/XAudio2Beta/content/content.aspx?ContentID=5127 XAudio 2 FAQ]</ref> Xaudio 2 has special emphasis on [[Audio signal processing|signal processing]] for high-level audio APIs such as XACT. Some of its features are: * Separation of sound data from “voice” * Submixing (arbitrary levels and routings) * Multi-rate processing * Per-voice filtering (built-in, in addition to programmable DSP effects) * Programmable voices * Effects processing, [[Sample rate conversion]] (SRC) * Software [[Digital Signal Processing|DSP]] * Enhanced [[surround sound]] (multichannel) and explicit multichannel [[Panning (audio)|panning]]/mapping dynamically to any speaker * Native compressed data support ** [[XMA (audio format)|XMA]] on [[Xbox 360]] ** [[ADPCM]] and xWMA ([[Windows Media Audio]] bitstream format in a lightweight wrapper) on Windows ** Extensible * 3D audio handled as a separate replaceable library: XAudio 2 takes multichannel speaker volumes and X3DAudio library transforms source/listener coordinates into speaker volumes and other synthesis parameters ==Windows CE== Although DirectSound support was available in Windows CE versions up to 4.2, it was removed starting 5.0 <ref>[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa446919.aspx Windows CE 5.0 removed functionality]</ref>. Windows CE 6.0 also does not support DirectSound, instead favoring that applications be rewritten to use the Waveform Audio API. == See also == *[[DirectX plugin]] *[[Cross-platform Audio Creation Tool]] *[[Technical features new to Windows Vista#Audio|Windows Vista audio architecture]] *[[DirectMusic]] *[[OpenAL]] ==References== {{reflist}} == External links == *[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee416960(v=VS.85).aspx MSDN DirectSound] *[http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article593.asp What's the deal with 3D sound under DirectX] *[http://forums.creative.com/creativelabs/board/message?board.id=Vista&message.id=1694 Audio in Windows Vista] *[http://connect.creativelabs.com/alchemy/default.aspx Creative ALchemy] {{Microsoft APIs}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Directsound}} [[Category:Application programming interfaces]] [[Category:Audio libraries]] [[Category:Music software plugin architectures]] [[Category:Microsoft Windows multimedia technology]] [[Category:DirectX|Sound DirectSound]] [[es:DirectSound]] [[fr:DirectSound]] [[ko:다이렉트사운드]] [[nl:DirectSound]] [[ja:DirectSound]] [[pl:DirectSound]] [[ru:DirectSound]] [[uk:DirectSound]] [[zh:DirectSound]]</text> </page> <page> <id>10562</id> <title>DirectX</title> <text>{{Infobox Windows component | name = DirectX | logo = DirectX logo.png | screenshot = | caption = | included_with = [[Windows 95]] OSR2<br/>[[Windows NT 4.0]]<br/>and all subsequent releases | replaces = | replaced_by = | related_components = }} '''Microsoft DirectX''' is a collection of [[application programming interface]]s (APIs) for handling tasks related to [[multimedia]], especially [[game programming]] and video, on [[Microsoft]] platforms. Originally, the names of these APIs all began with Direct, such as [[Direct3D]], [[DirectDraw]], [[DirectMusic]], [[DirectPlay]], [[DirectSound]], and so forth. The name Direct''X'' was coined as shorthand term for all of these APIs (the X standing in for the particular API names) and soon became the name of the collection. When Microsoft later set out to develop a gaming console, the X was used as the basis of the name [[Xbox]] to indicate that the console was based on DirectX technology.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb5037/is_200511/ai_n18254735/ The meaning of Xbox; Microsoft.(Xbox 360) | Economist (US), The]</ref> The X initial has been carried forward in the naming of APIs designed for the Xbox such as [[XInput]] and the [[Cross-platform Audio Creation Tool]] (XACT), while the DirectX pattern has been continued for Windows APIs such as [[Direct2D]] and [[DirectWrite]]. Direct3D (the 3D graphics API within DirectX) is widely used in the development of [[video game]]s for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox]], and Microsoft [[Xbox 360]]. Direct3D is also used by other software applications for visualization and graphics tasks such as CAD/CAM engineering. As Direct3D is the most widely publicized component of DirectX, it is common to see the names "DirectX" and "Direct3D" used interchangeably. The DirectX [[software development kit|software development kit (SDK)]] consists of [[runtime library|runtime libraries]] in redistributable binary form, along with accompanying documentation and [[header file|headers]] for use in coding. Originally, the runtimes were
