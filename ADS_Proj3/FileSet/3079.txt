is maintained separately by the English-language community, for convenience and for ease of introducing enhancements that are suited to the community. For example, ONScripter-EN supports switching between English and Japanese in-game, whilst language support in ONScripter must be determined at [[Compiler|compile-time]]. Also, to better manage the [[Software build|build system]] which was deemed cumbersome, build requirements have been tightened, limiting out-of-the-box building to [[POSIX]]-conformant platforms only. This engine has been used in a number of translations, such as the English versions of ''[[Narcissu]]'' and ''[[Tsukihime]]''. ===Proportional ONScripter=== '''PONScripter''' (abbreviation for "Proportional-OnScripter") is a [[Fork_(software_development)|fork]] of ONScripter-EN. Its stated goal is to provide an easy porting target for translation projects, with emphasis on Western languages.<ref name="PONS-EN Readme" /> PONScripter has made heavy modifications to the ONScripter-EN base code, and is deliberately backwards-incompatible. PONScripter was originally maintained by Peter "Haeleth" Jolly. Since September 2009, it is maintained by Mion of Sonozaki Futago-tachi, the [[Higurashi no Naku Koro ni]] translation group<ref>[http://onscripter.denpa.mobi/?page_id=26 Mion releases first alpha build. Checked 2009/09/26]</ref>. Unlike ONScripter, PONScripter natively supports [[UTF-8]] encoded script files, as well as a larger set of [[font]] types (such as [[Typeface#Proportion|proportional]] fonts, non-[[TrueType]] fonts, and non-[[Latin_alphabet|Latin]] fonts), which makes it possible to translate most NScripter-based [[visual novel]]s into any language other than English (for example, Cyrillic text is improperly displayed in ONScripter, and may crash the game). Another feature introduced by PONScripter is text formatting, such as bolding, italicising , underlining, striking out, colouring, size changing, and kerning. [[WinKiller Studio]], a [[Russia]]n visual novel translation group released ''[[Tokoyo no Hoshizora]]'' and ''[[Natsu no Hi no Resonance]]'' translations powered by PONScripter, and the unofficial ''[[Saya no Uta]]'' port from its original Nitro+ Engine. Known English-translated visual novels that use PONScripter are: *''[[Narcissu: Side 2nd]]''<ref>A mini-demo powered by PONScripter was available at Haeleth's Narcissu Side 2nd page, currently removed.</ref> *''[http://www.mangasos.com/dejavu/vn/projects-butterfly.html Ballad of an Evening Butterfly]'' *''[[Saya no Uta]]''<ref>Unofficial port incorporating TLWiki English localisation</ref> ==References== <references /> ==External links== *[http://www.nscripter.com/ Takahashi's Web]: Official NScripter website {{ja icon}} *[http://onscripter.unclemion.com/ Uncle Mion's ONScripter Corner]: Current active developer for ONScripter-EN and PONScripter *[http://wks.arai-kibou.ru/onscripter.php Сustom PONScriper & ONScripter-ANSI builds by WKS] {{ru icon}} Outdated / inactive: *{{wayback|url=http://ogapee.at.infoseek.co.jp/onscripter.html|title=The ONScripter Page|date=20071213021645}} {{ja icon}} *[http://dev.haeleth.net/onscripter/ Haeleth's ONScripter-En development site] *[http://nscripter.insani.org/index.html Insani's English support site for NScripter/ONScripter] {{DEFAULTSORT:Nscripter}} [[Category:Video game engines]] [[Category:NScripter games| NScripter]] [[Category:Visual novel engines]] {{Video game engines}} [[ko:NScripter]] [[ja:NScripter]] [[ru:NScripter]] [[zh:NScripter]]</text> </page> <page> <id>25714</id> <title>NYC Resistor</title> <text>{{Infobox computer underground | group_name = NYC Resistor | image = Nyc resistor.jpg | caption = | origin = [[New York]] | country = [[USA]] | status = active | years_active = 2008–present | category = [[Hacker (computer security)|Hacking]] | founders = See Founding Members below. | products = | affiliates = [[Metalab]], [[Chaos Computer Club]], [[Noisebridge]] and similar | website = [http://nycresistor.com NYC Resistor homepage] | }} '''NYC Resistor''' is a [[hackerspace]] in [[New York]], inspired by [[Chaos Computer Club]] and other hacker organizations. According the NYC Resistor's website, "NYC Resistor is a hacker collective with a shared space located in downtown Brooklyn. We meet regularly to share knowledge, hack on projects together, and build community."<ref>[http://www.nycresistor.com/about/ About page for NYCResistor.com]</ref> NYCResistor is an LLC. The Founding Members of NYCResistor are: * [[Bre Pettis]] - Instigator with video trigger finger. * George Shammas - Breaks things to fix them. * Zach Smith - Rapid-prototyper and self-replicater. * Eric Skiff - Gameboy musician and crowd control. * Nick Bilton - Hardware, Processing, Frontend/CSS Ninja. * Dave Clausen - Micro-hacker and structural engineer. * Raphael Abrams - Artist and keeper of the servos (Teuthis). * [[Diana Eng]] - Softronics, Fashion, Hardware. * Pat Gallagher - RPRT (Robotics) ==Membership== NYC Resistor encourages participation by anyone who feels they can contribute. Nonmembers are welcome to attend Craft Nights and other public events, as well as take part in classes on a variety of subjects. Visiting beyond this can be arranged on a case by case basis with current members. ==Physical Space== In February 2008 NYC Resistor took up residence at 397 Bridge Street in Brooklyn NY's [[MetroTech]] area. The 800+ sqft warehouse conversion houses, a small kitchen, several shop tables, an epilog laser cutter, and a small machine shop. Numerous electronics projects and personal tools litter shelves of members at the space. A drink mixing robot also has become a permanent fixture at the location. In March 2009 NYC Resistor acquired the neighboring warehouse space on the fifth floor of 397 bridge street and converted it to a machine shop. March 2010, NYC Resistor moved to a new, larger space on 3rd Avenue in [[Boerum Hill]] upstairs from [[Makerbot]]. ==In the news== '''The Wall Street Journal''' * [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125798004542744219.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_LEFTTopStories#project%3DSLIDESHOW08%26s%3DSB10001424052748704576204574529912395314736%26articleTabs%3Darticle Tinkering Makes Comeback Amid Crisis] '''The New York Times''' * [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/28/nyregion/thecity/28tink.html?_r=1 NYCResistor Featured in NY Times Dec 2008] * [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/fashion/03webparty.html?_r=2&ref=fashion&oref=slogin NYCResistor mentioned in Article About Ignite NYC] '''The NY Daily News''' * [http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/2009/06/22/2009-06-22_nyc_resistor_club_gives_robot_lovers_a_place_to_get_in_gear.html NYCResistor Featured in NY Daily News June 2009] '''The Washington Post''' * [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/18/AR2009041800112.html?wpisrc=newsletter&wpisrc=newsletter Mentioned in Hackerspaces article] '''The Irish Times''' * [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2008/1024/1224715113204.html Mentioned in Hackerspaces Article] '''NPR Takeaway Show''' * [http://www.thetakeaway.org/stories/2009/apr/14/hackers-play-around-next-generations-technology/ NPR Takeaway Show] '''The IEEE Spectrum''' * [http://spectrum.ieee.org/video?id=481 Members Nick Bilton, and Matt Joyce Interviewed by IEEE during Soldering Competition] '''Zeit''' * [http://www.zeit.de/online/2009/03/digital-hackerspaces?page=1 Zeit.de] '''Wired''' * [http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2009/03/hackerspaces.html DIY Freaks] '''Wired Blog''' * [http://blog.wired.com/geekdad/electronics/index.html Take it Apart Tuesdays Covered] * [http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/10/hackers-space-t.html Hacker Spaces Article] * [http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2007/11/the-microcontro.html MicroController Article] * [http://blog.wired.com/geekdad/2008/03/reprap-timelaps.html Rep-Rap covered, NYCR Mentioned] * [http://blog.wired.com/geekdad/2008/07/the-history-of.html History of CCC Blog Post Covered] * [http://blog.wired.com/geekdad/2008/04/hacker-collecti.html Wired Advertising Classes?] '''Various Blogs''' * [http://gawker.com/373890/hackers-get-nerd+tastic Rent Party, covered by Gawker.com] * [http://www.boingboing.net/2008/11/04/funny-gadget-the-ele.html Elect-o-meter project was covered in many news blogs] * [http://laughingsquid.com/nyc-resistor-a-electronics-hardware-hacker-space-in-brooklyn/ Laughing-Squid coverage] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.nycresistor.com/ Nycresistor.com] * [http://hackerspaces.org/ Hackerspaces.org] {{DEFAULTSORT:Nyc Resistor}} [[Category:Hacker groups]] [[Category:Computer clubs]] [[Category:Hackerspace]] {{technology-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>25723</id> <title>Nadal (surname)</title> <text>'''Nadal''' is a surname of [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Occitan]], and [[Venetian language|Venetian]]<ref>''Gens Labo Net'', surnames in Italy [http://www.gens.labo.net/it/cognomi/genera.html?cognome=NADAL&t=cognomi-prov]</ref><ref>''Cognomix'', surnames in Italy [http://www.cognomix.it/mappe-dei-cognomi-italiani.php?ricCognome=Nadal&ricDove=1&x=0&y=0]</ref> origin.
