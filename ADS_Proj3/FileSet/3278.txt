Walter" can be interpreted as: :''George IV wondered whether the x that... is identical to the y that....'' where "..." stands for some definite description such as "the clever fellow who wrote Ivanhoe" and ....stands for something like "the elegant gentleman seated next to the Princess". In the ''de re'' case, the above sentence can be interpreted as follows instead: :''the x that... is such that King George wondered whether x is identical to the y that....'' ===Fictional names=== Finally, Russell suggests that fictional names such as "[[Apollo]]" can be treated as abbreviated definite descriptions that refer to nothing. All propositions that contain names of such fictional entities are to be treated in the same manner as the negative existentials described above. ==Criticism== In his essay, "[[On Referring]]", [[P. F. Strawson]] criticized Russell's characterization of statements where the object doesn't exist such as "the present King of France" as being false. Such statements, Strawson held, is neither true nor false but, rather, absurd. Strawson believed that, contrary to Russell, use does determine the meaning of a sentence. To give the meaning of an expression is to "give general directions for its use."<ref name="Strawson 327">{{Cite journal | last = Strawson | first = P. F. | authorlink = P. F.

In normal use, the expression would be referring to one particular table. It is false, Strawson believed, to think, as Russell, that the phrase will only have meaning insofar as there is only one table and no more. The phrase has application in virtue of the fact that one table and no more is what is being referred to, and it is understood that the table it what is being referenced.<ref name="Strawson 332">{{Cite journal | last = Strawson | first = P.

The German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] revised this important work and re-published it in 1847. Throughout all Schopenhauer's later works he consistently refers his readers to this short treatise as the necessary beginning point for a full understanding of his entire system. == Background == ===Historical=== In January 1813, after suffering their disastrous defeat in Russia, the first remnants of [[Napoleon]]'s ''[[Grande Armée]]'' were arriving in Berlin. The sick and wounded quickly filled up the hospitals and the risk of an epidemic grew high. A patriotic, militaristic spirit inflamed the city and most of the populace, philosophers and students included, entertained the hope that the French yoke could be violently thrown off. All this rapidly became intolerable to Schopenhauer who ultimately fled the city, retreating to the small town of [[Rudolstadt]] near [[Weimar]]. It was here, from June to November of that year, while staying at an inn, that the work was composed. After submitting it as his doctoral dissertation he was awarded a PhD from the [[University of Jena]] in absentia. Private publication soon followed. "There were three reviews of it, commending it condescendingly. Scarcely more than one hundred copies were sold, the rest was remaindered and, a few years later, pulped."<ref>Safranski, pg. 156.</ref> Among the reasons for the cold reception of this original version is a) it lacked the author's later authoritative style and b) appeared decidedly unclear in its implications. A copy was sent to [[Goethe]] who responded by inviting the author to his home on a regular basis, ostensibly to discuss philosophy but in reality to recruit the young philosopher into work on his ''[[Theory of Colours (book)|Theory of Colors]]''. In 1847 Schopenhauer rewrote and enlarged the work, publishing a new edition. This is the version of the work that is read today. "There the lines of thought are firmly pursued, linking up with his main work; there a challenge is issued to philosophical tradition, and there is no curb on attacks against the philosophical
