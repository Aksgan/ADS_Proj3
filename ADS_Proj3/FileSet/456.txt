painting within the school. The old site was commemorated with the addition of a Science and Technology building across the road from the main site, which is named Bedewell. The two sites are joined by a [[skyway|skywalk]] which cost £800,000 in 2004, replacing an outdoor metal bridge which had been deemed impractical.<br /> There have been several [[ecclesiastical]] visits from Bishops and members of the Christian faith. The school has had visits from the [[Quicken Trust]], a Christian organisation which works with people in Kabubu, Africa. Bishop Bell has also had much cooperation with Schlenker Secondary school from [[Freetown]], [[Sierra Leone]], within which it helped to implement an IT center in March 2008.<ref name="schlenker">[http://www.bishopbell.e-sussex.sch.uk/Docs/contact/2007/2008/28%20Mar%202008.pdf Bishop Bell Weekly Newsletter], PDF Article on the school's cooperating with the Schlenker Anglican Secondary school in Sierra Leone.</ref> It was visited by [[Heather Mills McCartney]] in 2005 concerning global education targets. The Global Awareness Group has been visited by [[Nigel Waterson|Nigel Waterson MP]]. ===Future=== Bishop Bell plans to build a Sports Hall on the school field, and is in the process of raising the required £4 million. There have however been some setbacks, such as building a new staff room complete with tacky stain glass window showing Jesus getting owned. ==Acclaim== The school is relatively famous both within the county and regionally for having undergone a great improvement from when it was taken over by headmaster Mr. Terry Boatwright in 1995. This is evident in the vast increase in pupils achieving 5 A*-C grade GCSEs, which had risen for eleven consecutive years.<ref name="results">[http://www.eastbourneherald.co.uk/news/Schools-celebrate-GCSE-success.3142775.jp Eastbourne Herald GCSE results], Article on the school's 2007 results success.</ref> The current level is well above the national average for comprehensive schools.<ref name="testt">[http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=314982 Times Educational Supplement], Ofsted's top 41 improving secondary schools;</ref> This has been attributed to the Headmaster, Mr. Terry Boatwright.<ref name="test">[http://www.tes.co.uk/jobDetailsSilver_schoolInfo.aspx?ac=2698280&qry=&rslt=&cur=&UK=true Times Educational Supplement], This site includes information and acclaim of the school.</ref> ==Uniform== The uniform consists of a black blazer bearing the Bishop Bell mitre, a tie also bearing the mitre, to be worn with a white shirt (unbuttoned for the boys) and black trousers or skirt. The school is strict that the pupils wear black shoes with no high heels or trainers, except during physically active subjects (such as intercourse with mr pates), in which trainers are permitted. Instead of the blazer, shirt and tie combination, Year 11 is allowed to wear a specified colour of polo shirt, with a matching sweatshirt available. Small studs are permitted, and discreet make-up is allowed for Year 10 and 11. The staff has no strict uniform code, though the male staff are expected to wear a shirt and tie. ==Curriculum== The school educates students from Year 7 through to Year 11, after which they may continue their education within limited Post-16 positions in [[Information communication technology|ICT]] and the school nursery. The school offers pupils a range of voluntary and compulsory [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]] subjects which are taken from Year 9 to Year 11. This is a change from the previous academic year (2007–2008) in which the school started GCSEs at Year 10, with pupils deciding their subject choices the year before.<br /> The school educates all of its pupils in Citizenship and [[PSHE|Personal, Social and Health Education]]. English, Mathematics and Science, the core subjects, are taught to all students throughout the entirety of the pupils' education at the school. The arts and foreign languages are optional as GCSEs in the upper school. ===School day=== The regular day comprises five one-hour periods, with breaks at 11.15 and 1.40. Mondays are shorter than the rest by twenty minutes to allow for pupil mentoring meetings at the end of the day. Once every term (of which there are 6 in an academic year) there is an 'Academic Development Day' in which the school is divided up to partake in single subjects for the entire day. This time may be used to plan school trips, or sports days, or to complete coursework in the upper school. ===GCSEs=== The school offers the following GCSEs:<br /> [[English Language]] and [[English Literature]] (Compulsory); [[Mathematics]] (Compulsory); [[Statistics]]; [[Biology]], [[Chemistry]] and [[Physics]] (Triple science, optional); Double science (Two GCSEs); [[Art]] (Optional); [[Music]] (Optional); [[Drama]] (Optional); [[History]] (Optional); [[Geography]] (Optional); [[Information Communication Technology]] (Short course compulsory); [[Physical Education]] (Short course compulsory); [[Religious Studies]] (Short course compulsory); [[French language|French]]; [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. ==Extracurricular: Societies and Clubs== There have been many clubs and societies within Bishop Bell school, the details of which follow: ===School council=== Bishop Bell has a school council composed of members representing each year, who collaborate with members of each tutor group. The council has helped to secure vending machines, water dispensers, improve staff-pupil relations and generally provide the staff and the senior management with information regarding the pupils' viewpoints. ===Global Awareness Group=== This group has been active in many areas of modern ethical concern, including [[fairtrade]] goods and global education, for example the 'Send my friend to school' campaign and the subsequent 'My friend needs a teacher' campaign. The group is trying to make the school a 'fairtrade school'<ref name="fairtrade">[http://www.activeeast.org.uk/fteb/fortnight.html Fairtrade Eastbourne organisation], Visit of African cotton farmer to Bishop Bell school.</ref> by enforcing self-governed criteria intended to encourage fairtrade use within the school as well as encouraging the community by example.<br />The group has visited London with Nigel Waterson MP. <br />The group was active in the 'Send my friend to school' and 'Send my friend a teacher' campaigns. With the school they wrote to Dr. [[Angela Merkel]], German chancellor and chair of the G8 2007. ===Music Department=== The music department has been a part of a wide variety of clubs. The choir has performed in the [[Royal Albert Hall]], churches and cathedrals in both [[Strasbourg]] and [[Paris]] in France, and has submitted performances for various events in the [[Congress Theatre (Eastbourne)|Congress Theatre]]. The music department annually holds a Summer Concert, held at the school, wherein partake many performers from the department. The band plays, and many solo singers and instrumentalists have performed at this concert.<br
