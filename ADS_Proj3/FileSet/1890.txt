1945. He visited the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]] (NPL) in the [[United Kingdom]] for a year and worked on the [[Pilot ACE]] computer with [[Alan Turing]] and others. He was also involved with the [[EDVAC]] and [[SEAC]] computer projects. Huskey designed and managed the construction of the [[Standards Western Automatic Computer]] (SWAC) at the [[National Bureau of Standards]] in [[Los Angeles]] (1949–1953). He also designed the [[Bendix G15|G15]] computer for [[Bendix Aviation Corporation]], which could perhaps be considered as the first "personal" computer in the world. He had one at his home that is now in the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in [[Washington, DC]]. After five years at the National Bureau of Standards, Huskey joined the faculty of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1954 and then [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] from 1966. While at Berkeley, he supervised the research of pioneering programming language designer [[Niklaus Wirth]], who gained his PhD in 1963. He is now [[Professor Emeritus]] at the [[University of California]], after his retirement at the age of 70 in 1986. In 1994 he was inducted as a [[Fellow]] of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]. Huskey married Velma Roeth (died 1991) and had four children. He married Nancy Grindstaff in 1994 and now lives in [[Spartanburg]], [[South Carolina]]. ==Trivia== {{Trivia|date=August 2008}} Huskey appeared with a junk dealer as the third pair of contestants in an episode of [[Groucho Marx]]'s radio show "[[You Bet Your Life]]". He was described as the designer of an "[[electronic brain]]". They selected the "state category" and missed the final question when they failed to identify Iowa as the state North of Missouri.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otrcat.com/otr5/youbetyourlife500510no4932door(otrcat.com).mp3k |title=You Bet Your Life &#124; Old Time Radio |publisher=Otrcat.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-22}}</ref> ==See also== * Huskey, H.

He was the son of Lars Jonsson Nyqvist (b. 1847) and Katrina Eriksdotter (b. 1857). His parents had seven children: Elin Teresia, Astrid, Selma, Harry Theodor, Aemelie, Olga Maria, and Axel. He emigrated to the [[United States|USA]] in 1907. ==Education== He entered the [[University of North Dakota]] in 1912 and received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering in 1914 and 1915, respectively. He received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in physics at [[Yale University]] in 1917. ==Career== He worked at [[AT&T Corp.|AT&T]]'s Department of Development and Research from 1917 to 1934, and continued when it became [[Bell Laboratories|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] in that year, until his retirement in 1954. Nyquist received the [[IEEE Medal of Honor|IRE Medal of Honor]] in 1960 for "fundamental contributions to a quantitative understanding of thermal noise, data transmission and negative feedback." In October 1960 he was awarded the Stuart Ballantine Medal of the [[Franklin Institute]] "for his theoretical analyses and practical inventions in the field of communications systems during the past forty years including, particularly, his original work in the theories of telegraph transmission, thermal noise in electric conductors, and in the history of feedback systems." In 1969 he was awarded the [[National Academy of Engineering]]'s fourth Founder's Medal "in recognition of his many fundamental contributions to engineering." Nyquist lived in [[Pharr, Texas]] after his retirement, and died in [[Harlingen, Texas]] on April 4, 1976. == Technical contributions== As an engineer at Bell Laboratories, Nyquist did important work on thermal noise ("[[Johnson–Nyquist noise]]")<ref> H. Nyquist, "Thermal Agitation of Electric Charge in Conductors", Phys. Rev., Vol. 32, pp. 110-113, 1928</ref>, the stability of [[feedback]] [[amplifier]]s, telegraphy, [[fax|facsimile]], television, and other important communications problems. With [[Herbert E. Ives]], he helped to develop [[AT&T]]'s first facsimile machines that were made public in 1924. In 1932, he published a classical paper on stability of feedback amplifiers.<ref>H. Nyquist, "Regeneration theory", Bell System Technical Journal, vol. 11, pp. 126-147, 1932</ref> The [[Nyquist stability criterion]] can now be found in all textbooks on feedback control theory. His early theoretical work on determining the bandwidth requirements for transmitting information laid the foundations for later advances by [[Claude Shannon]], which led to the development of [[information theory]]. In particular, Nyquist determined
