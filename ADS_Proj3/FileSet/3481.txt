He is currently the Director of Research (formerly Director of Search Quality) at [[Google|Google Inc.]] ==Educational Background== He is a Fellow and Councilor of the [[American Association for Artificial Intelligence]] and co-author, with [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]], of ''[[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]]'', now the leading college text in the field. He previously was head of the Computational Sciences Division (now the [http://ti.arc.nasa.gov Intelligent Systems Division]) at [[NASA Ames Research Center]], where he oversaw a staff of 200 scientists performing NASA's research and development in autonomy and robotics, [[automated software engineering and data analysis]], [[neuroengineering]], [[collaborative systems research]], and [[simulation-based decision-making]]. Before that he was Chief Scientist at [[Junglee (company)|Junglee]], where he helped develop one of the first Internet comparison shopping services; Chief designer at [[Harlequin (software company)|Harlequin Inc.]]; and Senior Scientist at [[Sun Microsystems|Sun Microsystems Laboratories]]. Norvig received a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S]]. in [[Applied Mathematics]] from [[Brown University]] and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in Computer Science from the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He has been an Assistant Professor at the [[University of Southern California]] and a Research Faculty Member at Berkeley. He has over fifty publications in various areas of Computer Science, concentrating on [[Artificial intelligence]], [[Natural language processing]] and Software Engineering including the books ''[[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]]'', ''[[Paradigms of AI Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp]]'', ''[[Verbmobil: A Translation System for Face-to-Face Dialog]]'', and ''[[Intelligent Help Systems for UNIX]]''. ==Research== Norvig is also known for his "Gettysburg Powerpoint Presentation",<ref>http://www.norvig.com/Gettysburg/</ref> a satire about bad presentation practices using [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s famous [[Gettysburg Address]]. Norvig is one of the creators of [[JScheme]]. In 2006 he was inducted as a [[Fellow]] of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]].
