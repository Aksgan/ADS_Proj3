In 2004, the Commission ordered us to create new versions of Windows that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary Windows communications protocols in their own products. The Commission’s impact on product design may limit our ability to innovate in Windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the Windows platform, and increase our product development costs. The availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our own products which could result in decreased sales of our products.}} ==Related investigations== In May 2008, the EU announced it is going to investigate [[Microsoft Office]]'s [[OpenDocument]] format support.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSL2257119220080522 EU says to study Microsoft's open-source step]</ref> In January 2009, the European Commission announced it would investigate the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows operating systems from Microsoft, saying "Microsoft's tying of Internet Explorer to the Windows operating system harms competition between web browsers, undermines product innovation and ultimately reduces consumer choice."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7834792.stm Microsoft is accused by EU again]</ref><ref>[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/09/15&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en original EC statement]</ref> In response, Microsoft announced that it would not bundle Internet Explorer with [[Windows 7 E]], the version of Windows 7 to be sold in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://microsoftontheissues.com/cs/blogs/mscorp/archive/2009/06/11/working-to-fulfill-our-legal-obligations-in-europe-for-windows-7.aspx|title=Working to Fulfill our Legal Obligations in Europe for Windows 7|date=2009-06-11|publisher=[[Microsoft Corporation]]|accessdate=2009-07-15}}</ref><ref name="Win7PreOrder">{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/uk/windows/buy/offers/pre-order.aspx|title=Windows 7 Pre-Order Offer|publisher=[[Microsoft Corporation]]|accessdate=2009-07-15}}</ref><ref name="BBCNoIEWin7">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8096701.stm|title=No IE onboard Windows 7 in Europe|date=2009-06-12|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=2009-07-15}}</ref><ref name="ArsTechnicaNoIEWIn7">{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2009/06/windows-7-to-be-shipped-in-europe-sans-internet-explorer.ars|title=Windows 7 to be shipped in Europe without Internet Explorer|publisher=[[Ars Technica]]|accessdate=2009-07-15}}</ref><ref name="GuardianNoIEWin7">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2009/jun/12/windows-7-internet-explorer|title=European version of Windows 7 will not include browser|last=John|first=Bobbie|date=2009-06-12|publisher=[[guardian.co.uk]]|accessdate=2009-07-15 | location=London}}</ref><ref name="RegisterNoIEWin7">{{cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/07/14/windows_7_leak_ie8/|title=Windows 7 still baking in oven, insists Microsoft|last=Fiveash|first=Kelly|date=2009-07-14|publisher=[[The Register]]|accessdate=2009-07-15}}</ref> On December 16, 2009, the European Union agreed to allow competing browsers, with Microsoft providing a "[[ballot]] box" screen letting users choose one of twelve popular products listed in random order.<ref name="uproar">{{cite news|url=http://www.thesunnews.com/business/story/1219411.html|title=Microsoft, EU settle browser uproar|last=Chan|first=Sharon|work=[[Seattle Times]]|date=2009-12-17|accessdate=2009-12-17}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The twelve browsers were [[Avant (browser)|Avant]], [[Chrome (browser)|Chrome]], [[Firefox]], [[Flock (browser)|Flock]] [[GreenBrowser]], [[Internet Explorer]], [[K-Meleon]], [[Maxthon]], [[Opera_(web_browser)|Opera]], [[Safari (browser)|Safari]], [[Sleipnir (browser)|Sleipnir]], and [[Slim (browser)|Slim]].<ref>BBC, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8537763.stm Microsoft offers browser choices to Europeans], 1 March 2010</ref> which are accessible via [[BrowserChoice.eu]]. ==See also== * [[United States v.
