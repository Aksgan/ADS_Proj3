groups are adjacent and share liberties, the situation may reach a position when neither player wants to move first, because doing so would allow the opponent to capture; such situations therefore remain on the board.<ref group="nb">In game theoretical terms, seki positions are an example of a [[Nash equilibrium]].</ref> Sekis can occur in many ways. The simplest are: (1) each player has a group without eyes and they share two liberties, and (2) each player has a group with one eye and they share one more liberty. In the "Example of seki (mutual life)" diagram, the circled points are liberties shared by both a black and a white group. Neither player wants to play on a circled point, because doing so would allow the opponent to capture. All the other groups in this example, both black and white, are alive with at least two eyes. Sekis are unusual, but can result from an attempt by one player to invade and kill a nearly settled group of the other player.<ref name=EyesSeki/> ==History== {{main|History of Go}} ===Origin in China=== [[Image:Anonymous-Astana Graves Wei Qi Player.jpg|thumb|right|Woman Playing Go (Tang Dynasty ca. 744) Discovered at the [[Astana Graves]].]] The earliest written reference to the game is generally recognized as the historical annal ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]''<ref name=ZhuoZhuan>Potter 1985; Fairbairn 1995</ref> (c. 4th century BC),<ref name=chronology2>Brooks 2007</ref> referring to a historical event of 548 BC.

Today, in China, it is known as '''''weiqi''''' ({{zh|t=圍棋|s=围棋|p=wéiqí|w=wei ch'i}}), literally the "encirclement board game". Go was originally played on a 17×17 line grid, but a 19×19 grid became standard by the time of the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907).<ref>Fairbairn 1995</ref> Legends trace the origin of the game to [[Emperor of China|Chinese emperor]] [[Emperor Yao|Yao]] (2337–2258 BC), said to have had his counselor [[Shun (Chinese leader)|Shun]] design it for his unruly son, Danzhu to favorably influence him.<ref>{{cite book|last=Yang|first=Lihui|title=Handbook of Chinese mythology|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO Ltd|isbn=978-1576078068|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Wf40ofEMGzIC&pg=PA228&dq=Yao+is+said+to+have+invented+the+game+of+Weiqi&hl=en&ei=lAfVTIruBdO3hAfCuIjVBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&sqi=2&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false|coauthors=Deming An, Jessica Anderson Turner|page=228}}</ref> Other theories suggest that the game was derived from Chinese tribal warlords and generals, who used pieces of stone to map out attacking positions.<ref name=Origin>Masayoshi 2005; Lasker 1934</ref> In China, Go was perceived as the popular game of the [[aristocracy]], while [[Xiangqi]] (Chinese chess) was the game of the masses.

In Korea, the game is called '''''baduk''''' ([[hangul]]: {{lang|ko|바둑}}), and a variant of the game called [[Sunjang baduk]] was developed by the 16th century.

Although there are some mentions of the game in western literature from the 16th century forward, Go did not start to become popular in the West until the end of the 19th century, when German scientist [[Oskar Korschelt]] wrote a treatise on the game.<ref name=GoHistEU>{{citation | last = Pinckard | first = William | title = History and Philosophy of Go | year = 1992}} in Bozulich, 2001 pp. 23–25</ref> By the early 20th century, Go had spread throughout the [[German Empire|German]] and [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] empires. In 1905, [[Edward Lasker]] learned the game while in Berlin. When he moved to New York, Lasker founded the New York Go Club together with (amongst others) Arthur Smith, who had learned of the game while touring the East and had published the book ''The Game of Go'' in 1908.<ref name=agahbk95>{{Citation | url = http://www.usgo.org/archive/agahbk95.html | title = AGA 1995 Historical Book | publisher = American Go Association | accessdate = 2008-06-11 }}</ref> Lasker's book ''Go and Go-moku'' (1934) helped spread the
