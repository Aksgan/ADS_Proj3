reformat line justification as text was typed or deleted. Thus paragraphs had to be reformatted by command after edits and changes. But a command could be given to reformat the entire document after it had been edited or re-written. Many of these weaknesses were corrected with a new interface in WordStar 2000. Reformatting of paragraphs became automatic. Most of the mnemonics were made simpler so that ^RW would Remove a Word, ^RR would Remove the Right side of a line (right of the cursor), ^RS would Remove a Sentence, and so on. WordStar 2000 was also rare among word processing programs in that it permitted the user to mark (highlight) a block of text (with ^BB for Block Begin and ^BE for Block End) and leave it marked in place, and then go to a different section and copy it (with ^BC for Block Copy). Many users found it much easier to manipulate blocks with the block commands rather than the Microsoft Word system of highlighting with a mouse. The main problem with these improvements was that users of legacy WordStar (non-WordStar 2000) were quite happy with that interface and did not want to change to a new one. The WordStar interface left a large legacy. This includes modern cross-platform word processing software like [http://www.softmaker.com TextMaker] and many [[text editor]]s running under MS-DOS, [[Linux]], and other [[Unix|UNIX]] variants, which can emulate the ''WordStar keyboard commands'' using [[control key|Ctrl-key]] combinations. The popular [[Turbo Pascal]] compiler used WordStar keyboard commands in its [[integrated development environment|IDE]] editor. Modern word processing software like [http://www.writeandset.com/english/indxf.html Write&Set] not only use the WordStar interface, but have been based on WordStar DOS file formats, allowing WordStar users who no longer have a copy of the application to easily open and edit their files. There are WordStar keyboard command emulators and keymappings, both freeware and shareware, for current versions of [[Microsoft Office Word|Microsoft Word]]. Popular modern word processing software like [[WordPerfect]], [[StarOffice]] and Microsoft Word (with the proper filters) can open and save to WordStar documents, enabling users to move back and forth. [[File:Wordstar.gif|thumb|WordStar for DOS with main menu in upper part of screen, status line at top, and user text in bottom â…” of screen]] == Features == MailMerge was an add-on program (becoming integrated from WordStar 4 onwards) which facilitated the ''merge printing'' of bulk mailings, such as business letters to clients. Two files were required: a) a DAT file, being a list of recipients stored in a non-document, comma-delimited datafile, typically named ''Clients.dat''. Each subsequent line of text in the file would be dedicated to a particular client, with name and address details separated on the line dedicated to a client by commas, read left to right. For example: Mr, Michael, Smith, 7 Oakland Drive,... b) a master document containing the text of the letter, using standard paragraphs (aka [[boilerplate text]]) as required. These would be mixed and matched as needed, and where appropriate, paragraphs could be inserted through external reference to subordinate documents. The writer would deliberately place ampersand-defined fields into the master document, e.g. &TITLE&, &INITIAL&, &SURNAME&, &ADDRESS1&... as appropriate, to be substituted consecutively by the data items read from the DAT file along the particular client's address line during printing of their letter. Mass mailings could thereby be prepared with each letter copy ''individually'' addressed. Other add-on programs included SpellStar, a [[spell checker]] program, later incorporated as a direct part of the WordStar program; and DataStar, a program whose purpose was specifically to expedite creating of the data files used for merge printing. These were revolutionary features for personal computer users during the early-to-mid-1980s. A companion spreadsheet, CalcStar, was also produced using a somewhat WordStar-like interface; collectively, WordStar (word processing), DataStar (database management), and CalcStar (spreadsheet) composed the first-ever office suite of personal computer programs. As a product enhancement, in the late 1980s WordStar 5 came bundled with PC-Outline, a popular [[DOS]] [[outliner]] then available from Brown Bag Software, Inc., CA. PC-Outline text had to be exported to a WordStar-format file, as the programs were not developed to be internally compatible.<ref>http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue124/P198_1_REVIEWS_WORDSTAR_6.0.php</ref> WordStar identified files as either "document" or "nondocument," which led to some confusion among users. "Document" referred to WordStar word processing files containing embedded and hidden word processing and formatting commands. "Nondocument" files were pure [[ASCII]] text files containing no embedded formatting commands. Using WordStar in "Nondocument Mode" was essentially the same as using a traditional [[text editor]], but with more advanced text editing features than found in some mainframe-based editors. WordStar 5 introduced a document-mode "print preview" feature, allowing the user to inspect a [[WYSIWYG]] version of text, complete with inserted graphics, as it would appear on the printed page. [[File:Ws7 xp.PNG|thumb|WordStar 7 under Windows XP]] == Installation == Installation of early versions of WordStar, especially for CP/M, was very different from the approach of modern programs. While later editions had more-or-less comprehensive installation programs that allowed selection of printers and terminals from a menu, in the very early releases, each of the [[escape sequence]]s required for the terminal and printer had to be identified in the hardware documentation, then hand-entered into reserved locations in the program memory image. This was a fairly typical limitation of all CP/M programs of the time, since there was no mechanism to hide the complexities of the underlying hardware from the application program. Occasionally short machine-language programs had to be entered in a patch area in WordStar, to provide particular screen effects or cope with particular printers. Researching, testing, and proving out such installations was a time-consuming and knowledge-intensive process, making WordStar installation and customization a staple discussion of CP/M [[users' group]]s during that time. MS DOS versions of WordStar at least had standardized the screen display, but still had to be customized for different printers. == Running WordStar 3.x today == WordStar version 3.x used the MS-DOS [[File control block]] (FCB) interface, an early data structure for file input/output which was based closely on CP/M's file input/output functions. The provision of the FCB interface
