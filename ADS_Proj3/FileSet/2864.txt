Their work had been supported by [[United States Public Health Service|U.S. Public Health Services]] and the [[University of Colorado Denver|University of Colorado]]. Wright and Meyerdirk left the University to form Physionic Engineering Inc., which launched the first commercial hand-held articulated arm compound contact B-mode scanner in 1963. This was the start of the most popular design in the history of ultrasound scanners.<!-- --><ref>{{cite web | last = Woo | first = Joseph | title = A short History of the development of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology | publisher = ob-ultrasound.net | year = 2002 | url = http://www.ob-ultrasound.net/history1.html | accessdate = 2007-08-26 }}</ref> The first demonstration of color Doppler was by Geoff Stevenson, who was involved in the early developments and medical use of Doppler shifted ultrasonic energy.<!-- --><ref name="ObGyn-Doppler">{{cite web | title=Doppler Ultrasound History | publisher=www.obgyn.net | url=http://www.obgyn.net/displayarticle.asp?page=/us/feature/doppler_history/history_ultrasound | accessdate=2006-05-11}}</ref> ===Sweden=== Medical ultrasonography was used 1953 at [[Lund University]] by [[cardiology|cardiologist]] Inge Edler and [[Carl Hellmuth Hertz]], the son of [[Gustav Ludwig Hertz]], who was a graduate student at the department of [[nuclear physics]]. Edler had asked Hertz if it was possible to use [[radar]] to look into the body, but Hertz said this was impossible. However, he said, it might be possible to use ultrasonography. Hertz was familiar with using ultrasonic reflectoscopes for [[nondestructive testing|nondestructive materials testing]], and together they developed the idea of using this method in medicine. The first successful measurement of heart activity was made on October 29, 1953 using a device borrowed from the ship construction company [[Kockums]] in [[Malmö]]. On December 16 the same year, the method was used to generate an echo-encephalogram (ultrasonic probe of the [[brain]]). Edler and Hertz published their findings in 1954.<ref>Edler I, Hertz CH. ''The use of ultrasonic reflectoscope for the continuous recording of movements of heart walls.'' Kungl Fzsiogr Sallsk i Lund Forhandl. 1954;24:5. Reproduced in Clin Physiol Funct Imaging 2004;24:118-36. PMID 15165281.</ref> ===Scotland=== Parallel developments in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]] by Professor [[Ian Donald]] and colleagues at the [[Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital]] (GRMH) led to the first diagnostic applications of the technique. Donald was an [[obstetrics|obstetrician]] with a self-confessed "childish interest in machines, electronic and otherwise", who, having treated the wife of one of the company's directors, was invited to visit the Research Department of boilermakers Babcock & Wilcox at [[Renfrew]], where he used their industrial ultrasound equipment to conduct experiments on various morbid anatomical specimens and assess their ultrasonic characteristics. Together with the medical physicist Tom Brown and fellow obstetrician Dr John MacVicar, Donald refined the equipment to enable differentiation of pathology in live volunteer patients. These findings were reported in ''[[The Lancet]]'' on 7 June 1958<ref>Donald I, MacVicar J, Brown TG. ''Investigation of abdominal masses by pulsed ultrasound.'' [[The Lancet|Lancet]] 1958;1(7032):1188-95. PMID 13550965</ref> as "Investigation of Abdominal Masses by Pulsed Ultrasound" - possibly one of the most important papers ever published in the field of diagnostic [[medical imaging]]. At GRMH, Professor Donald and Dr James Willocks then refined their techniques to obstetric applications including foetal head measurement to assess the size and growth of the foetus. With the opening of the new Queen Mother's Hospital in [[Yorkhill]] in 1964, it became possible to improve these methods even further. Dr [[Stuart Campbell (Obstetrician and Gynaecologist)|Stuart Campbell]]'s pioneering work on foetal cephalometry led to it acquiring long-term status as the definitive method of study of foetal growth. As the technical quality of the scans was further developed, it soon became possible to study pregnancy from start to finish and diagnose its many complications such as multiple pregnancy, foetal abnormality and ''[[placenta praevia]]''. Diagnostic ultrasound has since been imported into practically every other area of medicine. ==See also== * [[Emergency ultrasound]] * [[3D ultrasound]] * [[Duplex ultrasonography]] * [[Doppler fetal monitor]] * [[European Master in Molecular Imaging]] * [[Global Library of Women's Medicine]] * [[Polybiography]] * [[Prenatal nutrition and birth weight]] ==References== {{Reflist|2}} ==External links== * [http://www.theradiologyblog.com/2009/09/what-is-ultrasound-imaging.html What is Ultrasound Imaging?] * [http://www.aium.org American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine] Professional Association * [http://www.ob-ultrasound.net/ingehertz.html About the discovery of medical ultrasonography] * [http://www.ob-ultrasound.net/history1.html History of medical sonography (ultrasound)] * [http://radiologyinfo.org/en/sitemap/modal-alias.cfm?modal=US Procedures in Ultrasound (Sonography)] for patients, from RadiologyInfo.org *[http://www.glowm.com/?p=glowm.cml/homelinks&linkid=101 The Global Library of Women's Medicine] Imaging in Obstetrics and Gynecology Link.
