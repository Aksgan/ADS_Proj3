that as many familiar results as possible will still be available. Typically ''elementary'' means that there is no [[quantifier|quantification]] over [[set (mathematics)|sets]], but only over elements. This limitation allows statements of the form "for any number x..." For example, the axiom that states "for any number ''x'', ''x'' + 0 = ''x''" would still apply. The same is true for quantification over several numbers, e.g., "for any numbers ''x'' and ''y'', ''xy'' = ''yx''." However, statements of the form "for any ''set'' ''S'' of numbers ..." may not carry over. This limitation on quantification is referred to as [[first-order logic]]. It is clear that the resulting extended number system cannot agree with the reals on all properties that can be expressed by quantification over sets, because the goal is to construct a nonarchimedean system, and the Archimedean principle can be expressed by quantification over sets. Similarly, the [[Complete metric space|completeness]] property cannot be expected to carry over, because the reals are the unique complete ordered field (up to isomorphism). We can distinguish three levels at which a nonarchimedean number system could have first-order properties compatible with those of the reals: # An ''[[ordered field]]'' obeys all the usual ''axioms'' of the real number system that can be stated in first-order logic. For example, the [[commutativity]] axiom ''x'' + ''y'' = ''y'' + ''x'' holds. # A ''[[real closed field]]'' has ''all'' the first-order properties of the real number system, regardless of whether they are usually taken as axiomatic, for statements involving the basic ordered-field relations +, * , and ≤. This is a stronger condition than obeying the ordered-field axioms. More specifically, one includes additional first-order properties, such as the existence of a root for every odd-degree polynomial. For example, every number must have a [[cube root]]. # The system could have all the first-order properties of the real number system for statements involving ''any'' relations (regardless of whether those relations can be expressed using +, *, and ≤). For example, there would have to be a [[sine]] function that is well defined for infinite inputs; the same is true for every real function. Systems in category 1, at the weak end of the spectrum, are relatively easy to construct, but do not allow a full treatment of classical analysis using infinitesimals in the spirit of Newton and Leibniz. For example, the [[transcendental functions]] are defined in terms of infinite limiting processes, and therefore there is typically no way to define them in first-order logic. Increasing the analytic strength of the system by passing to categories 2 and 3, we find that the flavor of the treatment tends to become less constructive, and it becomes more difficult to say anything concrete about the hierarchical structure of infinities and infinitesimals. ==Number systems that include infinitesimals== ===Formal series=== ==== Laurent series==== An example from category 1 above is the field of [[Laurent series]] with a finite number of negative-power terms. For example, the Laurent series consisting only of the constant term 1 is identified with the real number 1, and the series with only the linear term ''x'' is thought of as the simplest infinitesimal, from which the other infinitesimals are constructed. Dictionary ordering is used, which is equivalent to considering higher powers of ''x'' as negligible compared to lower powers. [[David O. Tall]]<ref>http://www.jonhoyle.com/MAAseaway/Infinitesimals.html</ref> refers to this system as the super-reals, not to be confused with the [[superreal number]] system of Dales and Woodin. Since a Taylor series evaluated with a Laurent series as its argument is still a Laurent series, the system can be used to do calculus on transcendental functions if they are analytic. These infinitesimals have different first-order properties than the reals because, for example, the basic infinitesimal ''x'' does not have a square root. ====The Levi-Civita field==== The [[Levi-Civita field]] is similar to the Laurent series, but is algebraically closed. For example, the basic infinitesimal x has a square root. This field is rich enough to allow a significant amount of analysis to be done, but its elements can still be represented on a computer in the same sense that real numbers can be represented in floating point. It has applications to numerical differentiation in cases that are intractable by symbolic differentiation or finite-difference methods.<ref>Khodr Shamseddine, "Analysis on the Levi-Civia Field: A Brief Overview," http://www.uwec.edu/surepam/media/RS-Overview.pdf</ref> ====Transseries==== The field of [[transseries]] is larger than the Levi-Civita field.<ref>G. A. Edgar, "Transseries for Beginners," http://www.math.ohio-state.edu/~edgar/preprints/trans_begin/</ref> An example of a transseries is: :<math>e^\sqrt{\ln\ln x}+\ln\ln x+\sum_{j=0}^\infty e^x x^{-j},</math> where for purposes of ordering ''x'' is considered to be infinite. ===Surreal numbers=== Conway's [[surreal numbers]] fall into category 2. They are a system that was designed to be as rich as possible in different sizes of numbers, but not necessarily for convenience in doing analysis. Certain transcendental functions can be carried over to the surreals, including logarithms and exponenentials, but most, e.g., the sine function, cannot. The existence of any particular surreal number, even one that has a direct counterpart in the reals, is not known a priori, and must be proved. === The hyperreal system === {{Main|Hyperreal number}} The most widespread technique for handling infinitesimals is the hyperreals, developed by [[Abraham Robinson]] in the 1960s. They fall into category 3 above, having been designed that way in order to allow all of classical analysis to be carried over from the reals. This property of being able to carry over all relations in a natural way is known as the [[transfer principle]], proved by [[Jerzy Łoś]] in 1955. For example, the transcendental function sin has a natural counterpart *sin that takes a hyperreal input and gives a hyperreal output, and similarly the set of natural numbers <math>\mathbb{N}</math> has a natural counterpart <math>^*\mathbb{N}</math>, which contains both finite and infinite integers. A proposition such as <math>\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \sin n\pi=0</math> carries over to the hyperreals as <math>\forall n \in {}^*\mathbb{N}, {}^*\!\!\sin n\pi=0</math> . === Superreals=== The [[superreal number]] system of Dales and Woodin is a generalization of the hyperreals. It is different from the super-real
