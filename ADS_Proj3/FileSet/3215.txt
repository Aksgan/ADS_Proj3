permitted to notarize a document anywhere in the state where their commission is issued. Some states simply issue a commission "at large" meaning no indication is made as to from what county the person's commission was issued, but some states do require the notary include the county of issue of their commission as part of the jurat, or where seals are required, to indicate the county of issue of their commission on the seal. Merely because a state requires indicating the county where the commission was issued does not necessarily mean that the notary is restricted to notarizing documents in that county, although some states may impose this as a requirement. Some states (Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, among others) allow a notary who is commissioned in a state bordering that state to also act as a notary in the state if the other allows the same. Thus someone who was commissioned in Montana could notarize documents in Wyoming and North Dakota, and a notary commissioned in Wyoming could notarize documents in Montana, a notary from Wyoming could not notarize documents from North Dakota (or the inverse) unless they had a commission from North Dakota or a state bordering North Dakota that also allowed North Dakota notaries to practice in that state as well. Notaries in the United States are much less closely regulated than notaries in most other [[common law|common-law]] countries, typically because U.S. notaries have no legal authority. In the United States, a lay notary may not offer [[law|legal]] advice or prepare documents - except in Louisiana and Puerto Rico - and cannot recommend how a person should sign a document or even what type of notarization is necessary, as these things would constitute unauthorized practice of law. In some states, a notary cannot even certify or attest a copy or facsimile. The most common notarial acts in the United States are the taking of '''acknowledgements''' and '''oaths'''. Many professions may require a person to double as a notary public, which is why US [[court reporters]] are often notaries as this enables them to swear in witnesses ([[deponent]]s) when they are taking [[deposition (law)|depositions]], and secretaries, bankers, and some lawyers are commonly notaries public. Despite their limited role, some American notaries may also perform a number of far-ranging acts not generally found anywhere else. Depending on the jurisdiction, they may: take depositions, certify any and all petitions (ME), witness third-party absentee ballots (ME), provide no-impediment marriage licenses, solemnize civil marriages (ME, FL, SC), witness the opening of a safe deposit box or safe and take an official inventory of its contents, take a renunciation of dower or inheritance (SC), and so on. ====Acknowledgment==== "An '''acknowledgment''' is a formal [oral] declaration before an authorized public officer. It is made by a person executing [signing] an instrument who states that it was his [or her] free act and deed." That is, the person signed it without undue influence and for the purposes detailed in it.<ref>Piombino, Alfred E. (1996). ''Notary Public Handbook: A Guide for Vermont''. n.p.: East Coast Press. 91.</ref> A '''certificate of acknowledgment''' is a written statement signed (and in some jurisdictions, sealed) by the notary or other authorized official that serves to prove that the acknowledgment occurred. The form of the certificate varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but will be similar to the following: <blockquote> Before me, the undersigned authority, on this ....... day of .........., personally appeared ................., to me well known to be the person who executed the foregoing instrument, and he/she acknowledged before me that he/she executed the same as his/her voluntary act and deed. </blockquote> ====Oath, affirmation, and jurat==== A '''jurat''' is the official written statement by a notary public that he or she has administered and witnessed an '''oath''' or '''affirmation''' for an [[oath of office]], or on an '''affidavit''' - that is, that a person has sworn to or affirmed the truth of information contained in a document, under penalty of perjury, whether that document is a lengthy deposition or a simple statement on an application form. The simplest form of jurat and the oath or affirmation administered by a notary are: <blockquote> *'''Jurat''': "Sworn (or affirmed) to before me this ........ day of ........, 20 ......" *'''Oath:''' "Do you solemnly swear that the contents of this affidavit subscribed by you is correct and true?" *'''Affirmation''' (for those opposed to swearing oaths): "Do you solemnly, sincerely, and truly declare and affirm that the statements made by you are true and correct?" </blockquote> ====Venue==== In the U.S., notarial acts normally include what is called a venue or caption, that is, an official listing of the place where a notarization occurred, usually in the form of the state and county and with the abbreviation "ss." (for Latin ''scilicet'', "to wit") normally referred to as a "subscript", often in these forms: {| |- |<pre> State of .......) )ss: County of.......) </pre> || <pre> State of ________ County of _______, to-wit: </pre> |- |} The venue is usually set forth at the beginning of the instrument or at the top of the notary’s certificate. If at the head of the document, it is usually referred to as a caption. In times gone by, the notary would indicate the street address at which the ceremony was performed, and this practice, though unusual today, is occasionally encountered. ====California==== The California Secretary of State, Notary Public & Special Filings Section, is responsible for appointing and commissioning qualified persons as notaries public for four-year terms.<ref>California Government Code [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&group=08001-09000&file=8200-8230 ''§8200''.]</ref> Prior to sitting for the notary [http://notaryeducation.sos.ca.gov/ exam], one must complete a mandatory six-hour [http://www.sos.ca.gov/business/notary/notary_cklist_complete_mandatory_education.htm course of study].
