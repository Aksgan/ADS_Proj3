The [[orthogonal group]] O(1,n) acts by norm-preserving transformations on [[Minkowski space]] <math>\mathbb{R}^{1,n}</math>, and it acts transitively on the two-sheet hyperboloid of norm 1 vectors. Timelike lines (i.e., those with positive-norm tangents) through the origin pass through antipodal points in the hyperboloid, so the space of such lines yields a model of hyperbolic n-space. The stabilizer of any particular line is isomorphic to the product of the orthogonal groups O(n) and O(1), where O(n) acts on the tangent space of a point in the hyperboloid, and O(1) reflects the line through the origin. Many of the elementary concepts in hyperbolic geometry can be described in linear algebraic terms: geodesic paths are described by intersections with planes through the origin, dihedral angles between hyperplanes can be described by inner products of normal vectors, and hyperbolic reflection groups can be given explicit matrix realizations. In small dimensions, there are exceptional isomorphisms of Lie groups that yield additional ways to consider symmetries of hyperbolic spaces. For example, in dimension 2, the isomorphisms <math>SO^+(1,2) \cong PSL_2(\mathbb{R}) \cong PSU(1,1)</math> allow one to interpret the upper half plane model as the quotient <math>SL_2(\mathbb{R})/SO(2)</math> and the Poincaré disc model as the quotient <math>SU(1,1)/U(1)</math>. In both cases, the symmetry groups act by fractional linear transformations, since both groups are the orientation-preserving stabilizers in <math>PGL_2(\mathbb{C})</math> of the respective subspaces of the Riemann sphere. The Cayley transformation not only takes one model of the hyperbolic plane to the other, but realizes the isomorphism of symmetry groups as conjugation in a larger group. In dimension 3, the fractional linear action of <math>PGL_2(\mathbb{C})</math> on the Riemann sphere is identified with the action on the conformal boundary of hyperbolic 3-space induced by the isomorphism <math>O^+(1,3) \cong PGL_2(\mathbb{C})</math>. This allows one to study isometries of hyperbolic 3-space by considering spectral properties of representative complex matrices. For example, parabolic transformations are conjugate to rigid translations in the upper half-space model, and they are exactly those transformations that can be represented by unipotent upper triangular matrices. ==Vectors== There is a notion of a [[vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] for hyperbolic geometry called a [[gyrovector]]. The difference between gyrovectors and euclidean vectors is that addition of gyrovectors is [[nonassociative]] and [[noncommutative]]. However this doesn't mean that A+(B+C) & (A+B)+C and A+B & B+A are totally unrelated. The exact relations are given by [[gyroassociativity]] and [[gyrocommutativity]] laws. == See also == {{div col|2}} * [[Elliptic geometry]] * [[Horocycle]] * [[Hyperbolic structure]] * [[Hyperboloid structure]] * [[Hjelmslev transformation]] * [[Hyperbolic manifold]] * [[Hyperbolic 3-manifold]] * [[Kleinian group]] * [[Poincaré metric]] * [[Pseudosphere]] * [[Khayyam–Saccheri quadrilateral]] * [[Spherical geometry]] * [[Systolic geometry]] {{div col end}} ==Notes== {{Reflist}} ==References== {{commonscat}} *{{aut|[[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|Coxeter, H.

[[Scientific American]], April 1999.</ref> A similar term is super-Turing computation. Hypercomputation may have the additional connotation of entertaining the possibility that such a device could be physically realizable. Some models have been proposed. ==History== A model more powerful than Turing machines was introduced by [[Alan Turing]] in his 1939 paper ''Systems of logic based on ordinals''. This paper investigated mathematical systems in which an [[Oracle machine|oracle]] was available, which could compute a single arbitrary (non-recursive) function from [[Natural number|naturals]] to naturals. He used this device to prove that even in those more powerful
