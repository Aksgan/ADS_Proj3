Originally a [[proprietary format]], PDF was officially released as an [[open standard]] on July 1, 2008, and published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] as ISO/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 32000-1:2008.<ref>{{cite web | last = Orion | first = Egan | title = PDF 1.7 is approved as ISO 32000 | work = [[The Inquirer]] | publisher = [[The Inquirer]] | date = 2007-12-05 | url = http://www.theinquirer.net/gb/inquirer/news/2007/12/05/pdf-approved-iso-32000 | accessdate = 2007-12-05 }}; {{cite web | url = http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2205065/pdf-takes-first-step-towards | title = Adobe wins backing for PDF 1.7 | publisher = vnunet.com }}</ref><ref name="iso-standard" /> The ISO 32000-1 allows use of some specifications, which are not standardized (e.g. Adobe XML Forms Architecture<ref name="gnupdf-fdf">{{cite web |url=http://gnupdf.org/Forms_Data_Format |title=Gnu PDF - PDF Knowledge - Forms Data Format |quote="Apparently Adobe introduced something newer called XFA (XML Forms Architecture) which doesn't seem standardized." |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref><ref name="acroforms-appligent">{{citation |url=http://www.appligent.com/files/faq-whatisthedifferencebetweenacroformaxfa/Acroforms%2BWhitePaper.pdf |title=A Quick Introduction to Acrobat Forms Technology |quote="Adobe's XFA Forms is a closed standard that competes with the fully open W3C Xforms standard." |date=2006-05-14 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref>). ISO 32000-1 does not specify methods for validating the conformance of PDF files or readers.<ref name="iso-standard" /> == History == PDF's adoption in the early days of the format's history was slow.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.prepressure.com/pdf/basics/history |title=The history of PDF|author=Laurens Leurs|accessdate=2007-09-19}}</ref> [[Adobe Acrobat]], Adobe's suite for reading and creating PDF files, was not freely available; early versions of PDF had no support for external hyperlinks, reducing its usefulness on the Internet; the larger size of a PDF document compared to plain text required longer download times over the slower [[modem]]s common at the time; and rendering PDF files was slow on the less powerful machines of the day. Additionally, there were competing formats such as [[Envoy (WordPerfect)|Envoy]], [[Common Ground Digital Paper]], Farallon Replica and even Adobe's own [[PostScript]] format (.ps); in those early years, PDF was popular mainly in [[desktop publishing]] [[workflow]]s. In 1995, AT&T Labs commenced work on another electronic document standard targeted at libraries and archives for preserving their books and documents, [[DjVu]]. This standard has evolved into the .djv/ .djvu format, which has had growing success and penetration in the online world for eBooks, catalogs, and image-sharing. Adobe soon started distributing its Acrobat Reader (now Adobe Reader) program at no cost, and continued supporting the original PDF, which eventually became the [[de facto standard]] for printable documents on the web (a standard [[web document]]). ===Adobe's PDF specifications=== Adobe changed the PDF specification several times and continues to develop new specifications with new versions of Adobe Acrobat. There have been nine versions of PDF with corresponding Acrobat releases:<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20071014010805/http://www.acrobatusers.com/blogs/leonardr/history-of-pdf-openness/ History of PDF Openness]</ref> * (1993) – PDF 1.0 / Acrobat 1.0 * (1994) – PDF 1.1 / Acrobat 2.0 * (1996) – PDF 1.2 / Acrobat 3.0 * (1999) – PDF 1.3 / Acrobat 4.0 * (2001) – PDF 1.4 / Acrobat 5.0 * (2003) – PDF 1.5 / Acrobat 6.0 * (2005) – PDF 1.6 / Acrobat 7.0 * (2006) – PDF 1.7 / Acrobat 8.0 * (2008) – PDF 1.7, Adobe Extension Level 3 / Acrobat 9.0 * (2009) – PDF 1.7, Adobe Extension Level 5 / Acrobat 9.1 The ISO standard ISO 32000-1:2008 is equivalent to Adobe's PDF 1.7. Adobe declared that it is not producing a PDF 1.8 Reference. The future versions of the PDF Specification will be produced by ISO technical committees. However, Adobe published documents specifying what extended features for PDF, beyond ISO 32000-1 (PDF 1.7), are supported in its newly released products. This makes use of the extensibility features of PDF as documented in ISO 32000-1 in Annex E. Adobe declared all extended features in ''Adobe Extension Level 3'' and ''5'' have been accepted for a new proposal of ISO 32000-2 (a.k.a. PDF 2.0).<ref name="pdf-ref">{{cite web |url=http://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference.html |title=Adobe Developer Connection: PDF Reference and Adobe Extensions to the PDF Specification |publisher=Adobe Systems Incorporated |accessdate=2010-12-13}}</ref> The specifications for PDF are backward inclusive. The PDF 1.7 specification includes all of the functionality previously documented in the Adobe PDF Specifications for versions 1.0 through 1.6. It should be noted that where Adobe removed certain features of PDF from their standard, they too are not contained in ISO 32000-1.<ref name="iso-standard" /> PDF documents conforming to ISO 32000-1 carry the PDF version number 1.7. Documents containing Adobe extended features still carry the PDF base version number 1.7 but also contain an indication of which extension was followed during document creation.<ref name="pdf-ref" /> ==== Adobe's versions ==== {|class="wikitable" style="width: 100%" |- !
