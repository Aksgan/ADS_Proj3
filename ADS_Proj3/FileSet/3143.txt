NetLogo comes bundled with a [http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/community/ large library of sample models] covering many domains in natural and social science. NetLogo was designed and authored by [[Uri Wilensky]], director of [[Northwestern University]]'s Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling. Development has been funded by the [[National Science Foundation]] and other foundations. ==Technical foundation== NetLogo is written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] and runs on the Java Virtual Machine. At its core is a hybrid interpreter/compiler that partially compiles user code to JVM bytecode. == References == *{{cite book | last = Gilbert | first = Nigel | coauthors = Klaus G.

It is used to access [[File server|file]], [[Print server|print]], [[Directory service|directory]], [[clock synchronization]], messaging, remote command execution and other network service functions. [[TCP/IP]] and [[IPX/SPX]] (obsoleted, [[technical support]] is provided only for [[Novell NetWare|NetWare]] platform) are the supported underlying protocols. [[TCP/IP]] implementations use [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]]/[[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] port 524 and rely on [[Service Location Protocol|SLP]] for name resolution. [[Novell eDirectory]] uses NCP for synchronizing data changes between the servers in a [[directory service]] tree. == Server-side implementations == * [[Novell Open Enterprise Server]] * [[Novell NetWare]] * [http://www.compu-art.de/mars_nwe/ mars_nwe], an open-source NetWare 3.x emulator for [[Linux]]. * File and Print Services for NetWare from [[Microsoft]] * various [[Network-attached storage|NAS]] devices == Client-side implementations == * [http://www.novell.com/products/clients/#vista Novell Client for Windows Vista] from Novell. * [http://www.novell.com/products/clients/windows/xp2000/overview.html Novell Client for Windows 2000/XP/2003] from Novell. * [http://www.novell.com/products/clients/windows/win9598/overview.html Novell Client for Windows 95/98] from Novell. * [http://www.novell.com/products/clients/linux/overview.html Novell Client for Linux] from Novell. * [http://www.novell.com/coolsolutions/tools/13555.html NetWare Clients for DOS] from Novell - no longer supported. * [http://www.prosofteng.com/products/netware_client_x.php NetWare Client for Mac OS X] from Prosoft Engineering. * [http://freshmeat.net/projects/ncpfs/ ncpfs], an open-source NCP client implementation for [[Linux]]. * Client Service for NetWare from [[Microsoft]]. == External links == * [http://www.novell.com/developer/ndk/netware_core_protocols.html NCP specification] without description of underlying Netware [[remote procedure call|RPC]] framework * [http://www.wireshark.org/docs/dfref/n/ncp.html Wireshark (an open source protocol analyzer) Documentation - Fields of the NCP packet] * [http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=printArticleBasic&articleId=9053138 Making Mac OS X play nicely with Novell] [[Category:Network file systems]] [[Category:Network protocols]] [[Category:Netware]] [[Category:Presentation layer protocols]] [[de:NetWare Core Protocol]] [[es:NetWare Core Protocol]] [[fr:NetWare Core Protocol]] [[it:NetWare Core Protocol]] [[pl:NetWare Core Protocol]] [[ru:NetWare Core Protocol]]</text> </page> <page> <id>26106</id> <title>NetWeaver Developer</title> <text>NetWeaver Developer is a [[knowledgebase]] development system. This article # gives a brief history of the system, # summarizes key features of the software, # is a bit of a primer, describing basic attributes of a NetWeaver knowledgebase, and # provides secondary references that independently document some of the NetWeaver applications developed since the late 1980s (see the [[#References]] section in this article, as well as applications documented for the [[EMDS]] system). First, though, a word about knowledgebases. While there are various ways of describing a [[knowledgebase]], perhaps one of the more central concepts is that a knowledgebase provides a formal specification for interpreting information.<ref>Walters, J.R., and N.R. Nielsen. 1988. Crafting Knowledge-based Systems. New York: John Wiley and Sons. 342 p.</ref> Formal in this context means that the specification is [[Ontology (information science)|ontologically committed]] <ref> Gruber, T.R. 1995. Toward principles for the design of ontologies used for knowledge sharing. International Journal of Human-Computer Studies 43:907-928.</ref> to the semantics and syntax prescribed by a knowledgebase processor (aka, an engine). == A brief history == NetWeaver was created in late 1991 as a response to ease knowledge engineering tasks by giving a graphical user interface to the ICKEE (IConic Knowledge Engineering Environment) inference engine developed at Penn State University by Bruce J. Miller and Michael C. Saunders. The first iterations were simply a visual representation of dependency networks stored in a LISP-like syntax. NetWeaver quickly evolved into an interactive interface where the visual environment was also capable of editing the dependency networks and saving them in the ICKEE file format. Eventually NetWeaver became "live" in the sense that it could evaluate the dependency networks in real time. == NetWeaver basics == A NetWeaver [[knowledgebase]] graphically represents a problem to be evaluated as networks of topics, each of which evaluates a proposition. The formal specification of each topic is graphically constructed, and composed of other topics (e.g., premises) related by logic operators such as and, or, not, etc. NetWeaver topics and operators return a continuous-valued ‘‘[[truth value]]’’,<ref> Miller, B.J., and M.C. Saunders. 2002. The NetWeaver Reference Manual. University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University. 61 p.</ref> that expresses the strength of evidence that the operator and its arguments provide to a topic or to another logic operator. The specification of an individual NetWeaver topic supports potentially complex reasoning because both topics and logic operators may be specified as arguments to an operator. Considered in its entirety, the complete knowledgebase specification for
