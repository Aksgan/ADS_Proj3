Selecting text, scrolling,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20050711.html |title=Scrolling and Scrollbars (Jakob Nielsen's Alertbox) |publisher=Useit.com |date=2005-07-11 |accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref> form control and right-clicking act differently than with a regular HTML webpage. Many such interface unexpectancies are fixable by the designer. Usability expert [[Jakob Nielsen (usability consultant)|Jakob Nielsen]] published an Alertbox in 2000 entitled, ''Flash: 99% Bad'' which listed issues like these.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20001029.html|title=Flash: 99% Bad|last=Nielsen|first=Jakob|date=2000-10-29 |accessdate=2009-02-21}}</ref> Some problems have been improved upon since Nielsen's complaints: * Text size can be controlled using full page zoom, found in many modern browsers. * It has been possible for authors to include alternative text in Flash since Flash Player 6. This [[Accessibility#Telecommunications and IT access|accessibility]] feature is compatible only with certain [[screen readers]] and only under Windows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skillsforaccess.org.uk/howto.php?id=101 |title=Provide text equivalents for graphics - in Flash |accessdate=2007-06-18 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |work=Skills for Access – How To |publisher= |pages= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> ===Performance=== * Any Flash player has to be able to animate on top of video renderings, which makes [[Hardware acceleration|hardware accelerated]] video rendering at least not as straightforward as with a purpose built [[Media player (application software)|multimedia player]].<ref>[http://blogs.adobe.com/penguin.swf/2010/01/solving_different_problems.html Solving Different Problems « Penguin.SWF].

Equivalent "Flash blocker" extensions also exist for many popular browsers: Firefox has [[NoScript]] and [[Flashblock]], and Opera versions since 10.5 feature native Flash blocking. Opera Turbo requires the user to click to play Flash content. Internet Explorer has Foxie, which contains a number of features, one of them also named Flashblock. WebKit-based browsers under Mac OS X, such as Apple's Safari, have ClickToFlash.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rentzsch.github.com/clicktoflash/|title=ClickToFlash|accessdate=2009-10-18}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> {{anchor|Security}} ==Flash client security== Flash's security record<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/support/security/#flashplayer|title=Security bulletins and advisories|accessdate=2010-03-27}}</ref> has caused several security experts to recommend to not install Flash or to block it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-10396326-245.html|title=Expert says Adobe Flash policy is risky|date=2009-11-12|accessdate=2010-03-27}}</ref> The [[United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team|US-CERT]] recommends to block Flash using [[NoScript]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/securing_browser/|title=Securing Your Web Browser|accessdate=2010-03-27}}</ref> [[Charlie Miller (security researcher)|Charlie Miller]] recommended "not to install Flash"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oneitsecurity.it/01/03/2010/interview-with-charlie-miller-pwn2own/|title=Pwn2Own 2010: interview with Charlie Miller|date=2010-03-01|accessdate=2010-03-27}}</ref> at the [[computer security conference]] [[CanSecWest]].

Flash cookies are not shared across [[Domain name|domains]]. An August 2009 study by the [[Social Science Research Network]] found that 50% of websites using Flash were also employing flash cookies, yet privacy policies rarely disclosed them, and user controls for privacy preferences were lacking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1446862|title=Soltani, Ashkan, Canty, Shannon, Mayo, Quentin, Thomas, Lauren and Hoofnagle, Chris Jay: Flash Cookies and Privacy|date=2009-08-10 |accessdate=2009-08-18}}</ref> Most browsers' cache and history suppress or delete functions do not affect Flash Player's writing Local Shared Objects to its own cache, and the user community is much less aware of the existence and function of Flash cookies than HTTP cookies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://epic.org/privacy/cookies/flash.html|title=Local Shared Objects -- "Flash Cookies"|publisher=Electronic Privacy Information Center|date=2005-07-21|accessdate=2010-03-08}}</ref> Thus, users having deleted HTTP cookies and purged browser history files and caches may believe that they have purged all tracking data from their computers when in fact Flash browsing history remains.
