[[René Descartes]] argued that if the speed of light were finite, the Sun, Earth, and Moon would be noticeably out of alignment during a [[lunar eclipse]]. Since such misalignment had not been observed, Descartes concluded the speed of light was infinite. Descartes speculated that if the speed of light were found to be finite, his whole system of philosophy might be demolished.<ref name=Statistics /> ===First measurement attempts=== In 1629, [[Isaac Beeckman]] proposed an experiment in which a person observes the flash of a cannon reflecting off a mirror about one mile (1.6 km) away. In 1638, [[Galileo Galilei]] proposed an experiment, with an apparent claim to having performed it some years earlier, to measure the speed of light by observing the delay between uncovering a lantern and its perception some distance away. He was unable to distinguish whether light travel was instantaneous or not, but concluded that if it weren't, it must nevertheless be extraordinarily rapid.<ref name=boyer> {{cite journal |last=Boyer |first=CB |year=1941 |title=Early Estimates of the Velocity of Light |journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]] |volume=33 |issue=1 |page=24 |doi=10.1086/358523 |ref=boyer-1941 }}</ref><ref name=2newsciences> {{Cite book |last=Galilei |first=G |year=1954 |origyear=1638 |title=Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=753&layout=html#a_2288356 |page=43 |others=Crew, H; de Salvio A (trans.) |publisher=[[Dover Publications]] |isbn=0486-60099-8 |ref=Reference-Galileo-1954 }}</ref> Galileo's experiment was carried out by the [[Accademia del Cimento]] of Florence, Italy, in 1667, with the lanterns separated by about one mile, but no delay was observed.
