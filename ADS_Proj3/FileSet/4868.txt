preparation for their use for drawing or writing. Animal [[hides]] also had potential for use as a material for writing or drawing, although the drawings and writings may have been decorative or to convey status or religious meaning. Among the barks of trees, [[birch bark]] is very well suited for use as a writing material and was so used both in Northern Europe and among native peoples in North America. Three other classes materials were sometimes used for writing: [[clay]], [[wax]], [[cloth]], and [[metal]]. The value of metal for useful implements may have made it less than useful for practical writing and drawing. The very hardness of many metals that made them useful also made it an inconvenient material for many kinds of writing. But foils or sheets of soft metals like lead were usable. Lead sheets were used for [[curse tablets]]. Cloth probably shared its mode of use with animal skins. Clay introduces the useful combination of extreme ease of making the inscription with the potential for rendering it fairly permanent. Unglazed pottery can readily accept inscription even after firing. Wax offers another novel combination of advantage: a reusable surface, easily inscribed and erased, and easy combination with materials like wood that give it durability. [[Stone tablets]], clay and wooden writing tablets, and [[Wax tablet|wax-covered wooden tablets]] are some of the first specialized configurations of materials in flat surfaces specifically for writing. Unglazed pottery shards were used almost as a kind of scratch paper, as [[ostraka]], for tax receipts and, in Athens, to record the individual nominations of Greek leaders for [[ostracism]]. The archaeological record contains either examples of these materials used for drawing or writing or it has indirect indications of their use for writing, drawing, or tallying. ==Common writing materials of the Middle Ages== In western civilisations, early use of [[papyrus]] was soon replaced by [[parchment]] made by treating animal hide. A wide variety of parchments from various animal skins, with different texture, quality and hue were widely used for codexes, religious and cultural texts. This was replaced by the advent and increasing access and availability of [[paper]]. In eastern civilisations such as [[India]], the principal writing media from the time of Christ were [[birch bark]] or ''bhurjapatra'' (Sanskrit) and [[palm leaf manuscript|dried palm leaves]]. The use of paper began only after the 10th century AD. However birch bark and palm leaf continue to be used even today on a limited scale in a rural milieu for the use of horoscopes, wedding invitations and other cultural uses. In China, the early material was animal bones, later silk, [[Bamboo and wooden slips (writing material)|bamboo and wooden slips]], until the 2nd century when [[paper]] was invented. ==History== Writing seems to have become more widespread with the invention of [[papyrus]] in Egypt. [[Parchment]], using sheepskins left after the wool was removed for cloth, was sometimes cheaper than papyrus, which had to be imported outside Egypt. With the invention of [[wood-pulp paper]], the cost of writing material began a steady decline. ==Printing== The dramatic increase in demand for paper associated with the [[printing press]] stimulated dramatic cost reduction efforts. Specialized materials developed for printing have also been made available for writing. The invention of the [[typewriter]] was a major step, making possible reliable production of legible written materials by organizations and individual writers. ==Electronic media== Electronic media have utilized the keyboard developed for the typewriter, electrical and electronic circuitry and storage devices, and the viewing screen developed for reading electronic signals to separate the medium for writing from the medium for reading. ==See also== {{Empty section|date=July 2010}} * [[Notebook]] ==References== {{Empty section|date=July 2010}} ==Further reading== * Harris, Roy (1985) ''The Origin of Writing''.

It focuses on one’s appraisal of the relationship between writing activity and writing outcome. Like [[reading motivation]] Writing motivation is said to be intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic writing motivation comes from within. It includes one's desire to make archive (documentation), to express emotions (emotional expression), to satisfy creation urge (creativity) and to develop mastery over writing (achievement). Extrinsic writing motivation is for satisfying others. It includes one's desire to write to be loved (affiliation), to be recognized by others (recognition) and to avoid punishment. Writing activity includes memory retrieval, goal setting, planning, problem solving and evaluation. ==Levels of Motivation== Motivation to write occurs at three levels: #Specific level – focusing on the processes between goal setting and writing sentences; #Intermediate level – focusing on the processes between goal setting and writing scenes; #General level – focusing on overall structure of a piece of writing; ==Strategies== ===Improve eye–hand coordination=== Improve eye–hand coordination in writing following writing skills, e.g. , clockwise and anti clockwise circling, angular writing, keeping symmetry and inter word spacing. ===Improve key processes=== Improve key processes of writing as #''Planning'' : Generate ideas and organize them into writing plan to satisfy writer’s goals; #''Sentence-generation process'': Turning the writing plan into the actual writing of sentences; #''Revision process'': Evaluating what has been written; In the planning stage, the writer organizes main goals and sub goals of writing to form a coherent writing plan. A good writer uses strategic knowledge in a flexible way. The structure of writing plan often changes during the writing period as new ideas come to the writer, or dissatisfaction grows with the original writing plan. If the plan proves inadequate, then the writing process grinds to a halt. The greatest difference between experts and non experts is in plan integration : experts goals were much better integrated. Two major strategies are used in the planning stage: the knowledge-telling strategy (writing down everything he or she knows about a topic) and the knowledge transferring strategy (asking
