help of [[Pierre Eugene du Simitiere]], an artist living in Philadelphia who would later also design the state seals of Delaware and New Jersey and start a museum of the Revolutionary War. Each of these men proposed a design for the seal. Franklin chose an allegorical scene from [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], described in his notes as "[[Moses]] standing on the Shore, and extending his Hand over the Sea, thereby causing the same to overwhelm [[Pharaoh]] who is sitting in an open Chariot, a Crown on his Head and a Sword in his Hand. Rays from a [[Pillar of Fire (theophany)|Pillar of Fire]] in the Clouds reaching to Moses, to express that he acts by Command of the Deity." Motto, "Rebellion to Tyrants is Obedience to God." Jefferson suggested a depiction of the [[Children of Israel]] in the wilderness, led by a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night for the front of the seal; and [[Hengist and Horsa|Hengest and Horsa]], the two brothers who were the legendary leaders of the first [[Anglo-Saxon]] settlers in [[Great Britain|Britain]], for the reverse side of the seal. Adams chose a painting known as the "Judgment of Hercules" where the young [[Hercules]] must choose to travel either on the flowery path of self-indulgence or the rugged, more difficult, uphill path of duty to others and honor to himself.<ref name="gsfirst">{{cite web|url=http://www.greatseal.com/committees/firstcomm/index.html |title= First Great Seal Committee – July/August 1776|publisher=greatseal.com|first= John D.|last=MacArthur|accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref> {{image stack|align=left|image_size=160|image2=Continental Currency One-Third-Dollar 17-Feb-76 rev.jpg|image1=Great Seal du Simitiere proposal sketch.jpg|image2_cap=du Simitiere's initial sketch, and Franklin's earlier design on a 1776 currency note}} In August, Du Simitière showed his design, which was more along conventional heraldic lines. The shield had six sections, each representing "the Countries from which these States have been peopled" (England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Germany, and Holland), surrounded by the initials of all thirteen states. The [[supporters]] were a female figure representing [[Liberty (goddess)|Liberty]] holding an anchor of hope and a spear with a [[Phrygian cap|cap]], and on the other side an American soldier holding a rifle and tomahawk.

The committee members chose Du Simitière's design, though it was changed to remove the anchor of hope and replace the soldier with [[Lady Justice]] holding a sword and a balance. Surrounding the main elements was the inscription "Seal of the United States of America MDCCLXXVI". For the reverse, Franklin's design of Moses parting the Red Sea was used. Congress was however not impressed, and on the same day ordered the report to "[[Table (parliamentary)|lie on the table]]", ending the work of the committee.<ref name="heraldica">{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/usa/usheroff.htm|title=Official Heraldry of the United States|accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref> [[File:GentlemansMagazine1737Vol7.jpg|120px|thumb|1737 ''Gentleman's Magazine'' title page]] While the designs in their entirety were not used, the E Pluribus Unum motto was chosen for the final seal, and the roman-numeral 1776 and Eye of Providence is used on the reverse. Jefferson also liked Franklin's motto so much, he ended up using it on his personal seal.<ref name="gsfirst"/> The motto was almost certainly taken from the title page of ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine|Gentleman's Magazine]]'', a monthly magazine published in London which had used it from its first edition in 1731, and was well known in the colonies.<ref name="statepub"/> The motto alluded to the magazine being a collection of articles obtained from other newspapers, and was used in most of its editions until 1833. The motto was taken in turn from ''Gentleman's Journal'', a similar magazine which ran briefly from 1692 to 1694. While variants turn up in other places (for example a poem often ascribed to [[Virgil]] called ''Moretum'' contains the phrase ''E Pluribus Unus''), this is the oldest known use of the exact phrase.<ref name="ahsource">{{cite web|url=http://americanheraldry.org/pages/index.php?n=Official.National|title=The Arms of the USA -- Blazon and Symbolism|accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref><ref name="tottenv2">{{cite book | last=Totten | first=C.A.L. | authorlink=C.
