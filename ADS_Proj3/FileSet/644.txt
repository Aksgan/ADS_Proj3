it takes N-1 messages for the election message to reach it, then N messages for it to get back its own UID, then other N messages to send everyone in the ring the elected message. This algorithm is not very fault tolerant. Fault tolerance can be increased If every process knows the whole topology, by introducing ACK messages and skipping faulty nodes on sending messages. == See also == *[[Leader election]] *[[Bully algorithm]] == References == {{reflist}} [[Category:Distributed algorithms]]</text> </page> <page> <id>5848</id> <title>Change-making problem</title> <text>The '''change-making problem''' addresses the following question: how can a given amount of money be made with the least number of coins of given denominations? It is a [[knapsack problem| knapsack type problem]], and has applications wider than just currency. ==Mathematical definition== Given a set of integer coin values {''w''<sub>1</sub>, ''w''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''w''<sub>''n''</sub>} where ''w''<sub>1</sub> = 1 and ''w''<sub>''j''</sub> < ''w''<sub>''j''+1</sub> for 1 &le; ''j'' &le; ''n'' &minus; 1, and a positive integer ''W'', find a set of non-negative integers {''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>} which minimize : <math>\sum_{j=1}^n x_j</math> subject to : <math>\sum_{j=1}^n w_j x_j = W.</math> ==Non currency examples== * how to make a [[nine dart finish]] ==Methods of solving== ===Dynamic programming=== Making a list of ways to make each amount from one upwards (an example of a [[dynamic programming]] method) ===Linear programming=== [[Linear_programming#Integer_unknowns | Integer Linear Programming]] is often a quick way to solve this kind of problem, but the time it will take to resolve the problem is not certain, and may be slow in some cases ===Greedy method=== In the US (and most other) coin systems, a [[greedy algorithm]] of picking the largest denomination of coin which is not greater than the remaining amount to be made will always produce the optimal result. This is not automatically the case, though: if the coin denominations were 1, 3 and 4, then to make 6, the greedy algorithm would choose three coins (4,1,1) whereas the optimal solution is two coins (3,3) ==External links== [http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.0400v1 discussion of coin denominations for which the greedy algorithm will produce optimal results] ==See also== * [[List of knapsack problems]] * [[Coin problem]] [[Category:Number theory]] [[Category:Recreational mathematics]] [[Category:Combinatorial optimization]] [[fr:Problème du rendu de monnaie]] [[pl:Problem wydawania reszty]]</text> </page> <page> <id>5849</id> <title>Change Advisory Board</title> <text>The Change advisory board (CAB) delivers support to the [[Change Management]] team by approving requested changes and assisting in the assessment and prioritization of changes. This body is generally made up of IT and Business representatives that include: the Change Manager, User managers and groups, technical experts, possible third parties and customers (if required).<ref>[http://itsm.certification.info/cab.html The ITSM Encyclopedia]</ref> The CAB members should selectively be chosen to ensure that the requested changes are thoroughly checked and assessed from both a technical and business perspective. The considered change will dictate the required personnel to convene in a CAB meeting. These entities are not required to meet face-to-face on each requested change, but rather use electronic support and communication tools as a medium. It is however advised that a quarterly meeting is scheduled to review outstanding changes, sign-off on approved changes and discuss any future major changes. A CAB offers multiple perspectives necessary to ensure proper decision making. For example, a decision made solely by IT may fail to recognize the concerns of accounting. The CAB is tasked with reviewing and prioritizing requested changes, monitoring the change process and providing managerial feedback. A CAB is an integral part of a defined change management process designed to balance the need for change with the need to minimize inherent risks. For example, the CAB is responsible for oversight of all changes in the production environment. As such, it has requests coming in from management, customers, users and IT. Plus the changes may involve hardware, software, configuration settings, patches, etc. This is defined as part of the Change Control Process within [[ITIL]]. The CAB concept can also be used outside of the IT world as the Change Process at a high level can be applied to any system. ==See also== * [[Information Technology Infrastructure Library|Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL)]] ==References== {{Reflist}} [[Category:Management]] {{software-eng-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>5854</id> <title>Change deafness</title> <text>{{orphan|date=October 2010}} '''Change deafness''' relates to the inability to detect changes between two voices during the allocation of attention.

Typically these machines are used to provide coins in exchange for paper currency, in which case they are also often known as '''bill changers'''. In the [[United States|US]], these devices are typically seen in the vicinity of machines that will not accept paper currency. This can be in a parking facility that has [[parking meter]]s, in [[laundromat]]s, or near [[vending machine]]s that lack [[bill validator]]s and don't accept paper currency. Before the advent of ''coinless'' [[slot machine]]s, [[casino]]s would sometimes have change machines that would accept paper currency and return coins or tokens that could be used in the machines. A similar arrangement has often been found at [[video arcade]]s. In some cases a machine may subtract a small amount (e.g. 5 cents) as a [[Fee|surcharge]] for the transaction. ==References== {{refs}} ==See also== * [[Automated cash handling]] * [[Manual fare collection#Coin dispenser]] * [[Money changer]] [[Category:Currency]] [[Category:Vending machines]] {{tech-stub}} {{money-stub}} [[ja:両替機]]</text> </page> <page> <id>5861</id> <title>Changelog</title> <text>{{selfref|For information on Wikipedia changelogs, see [[Help:Page history]].}} {{oneref|date=September 2010}} A '''changelog''' is a log or record of changes made to a project, such as a [[website]] or software project, usually including such records as bug fixes, new features, etc. Most [[open source]] projects include a changelog as one of the top level files in their distribution.
