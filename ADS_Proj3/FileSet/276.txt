Metals serve a wide variety of uses in the built landscape, including structural features, such as nails and trusses, as well as decorative features, such as doorknobs and cladding. Some metals discovered by early civilizations are still in use today. Scientific study has brought a greater understanding of the performance and limits of the various types of metals used in buildings. ==Metal Types== ===Lead=== The low melting point of lead permitted its use on a wide scale throughout human history. Water pipes were frequently constructed of lead, until its health hazards were publicized in the late 19th century. Lead has been a popular roofing material for centuries, being used for roofing, flashing, gutters, downspouts, and conductor heads. Lead was best suited for low-pitched roofs, as steep roofs experienced creep. Lead roofs in regions with large temperature fluctuations, such as the mid-Atlantic states, experienced deterioration from constant expansion and contraction, called fatigue. Beginning in the 19th century, a roofing material called “terne” or “terneplate” was used, consisting of sheet iron or sheet steel coated with a lead-tin alloy. It is frequently confused with tinplate. <ref>Gayle, Margot and Waite, John G. ''Metals in America's Historic Buildings: Uses and Preservation Treatments'', 1980, pages 8-11</ref> Lead was also frequently used for window cames, for use in skylights and stained glass. It was also used for small pieces of sculpture and garden ornamentation. Finally, lead was frequently added to paint, with red lead used as an anti-corrosive pigment for iron, and white lead used as paint for wooden houses. Lead-based paint was one of the most durable materials developed as a protective exterior coating. The use of lead paint has been restricted on most buildings, due to concerns of lead poisoning. ===Tin=== The principal architectural uses of tin fall into two categories: the alloying of tin with other metals such as copper to form bronze, and the coating of tin on harder metals, such as tinplated iron or steel. Architectural bronzes usually contain about 90% copper and 10% tin, although the content may vary widely. The term “tin ceiling” is a misnomer, as these decorative sheets were never tinned; they were almost always painted sheet iron or steel. Tinplate was a type of architectural material consisting of sheet iron coated with tin. “Tin roofs,” a type of tinplate, was originally used for armor but eventually as a roofing material. Tinplate was also used for decoration, such as ornamental windows and door lintels. Although tinplate is still available today for roofing and flashing, it is generally considered expensive since the initial cost is more than that for common modern roofing types such as asphalt shingles or built-up roofs. However, since a well-maintained tinplate roof typically lasts several times longer than either of these types of roofing, it is more economical when the cost is prorated over the longer lifespan. <ref>Gayle, Margot and Waite, John G. ''Metals in America's Historic Buildings: Uses and Preservation Treatments'', 1980, pages 12-13</ref> ===Zinc=== Pure zinc was used for roofing in Belgium, France and Germany, where it replaced more expensive copper and lead in roofing. Starting in the 1820s, Belgian sheet zinc was imported in America, used by builders in New York City and elsewhere. Pure zinc is subject to creep at ordinary temperatures. Zinc-coated metals were first patented in 1837, separately by M. Sorel in France and H. W. Crawford in England. The methods employed a “hot dipping” process to coat sheet iron with zinc. By 1839 “galvanized” sheet iron roofing was being used in New York City. The Merchant's Exchange in Manhattan was one of the first buildings to have both a galvanized roof and galvanized gutters. Some galvanized sheet roofing was pressed with designs, a mode very popular in the Victorian era. <ref>Gayle, Margot and Waite, John G. ''Metals in America's Historic Buildings: Uses and Preservation Treatments'', 1980, pages 15-21</ref> Zinc was also cast for sculptures and decorative elements in Germany as early as 1832. Decorative architectural elements were frequently cast in zinc, since it molded readily, was inexpensive compared to stone, and could be painted to imitate more expensive metals. Zinc oxide paints were nontoxic and resistant to pollution. They became commercially successful and readily available in America in about 1850 and used widely starting around the 1870s. They had the added benefit of being good inhibitors against rust on iron and steel. During the early decades of the 20th century, the use of pure zinc roofing and ornament decreased in use in the United States. It is now back on the upswing and gaining popularity in its pure form (99.95%)for building materials. Zinc is still used in alloys such as brass and nickel silver, and in the electroplating of steel as well. Today, galvanized steel and pure zinc material, usually Double Locked Standing Seam panels, are used for roofing a variety of buildings. Creep has been reduced by the introduction of titanium in most architectural zinc available in North America. Galvanized nails and sheet metal ducts are also common. ===Copper and Copper Alloys=== The “cupric” metals include copper and its alloys, especially bronze,
