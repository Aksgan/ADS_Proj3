neighbor. ===Trilinear filtering=== [[Trilinear filtering]] is a remedy to a common artifact seen in mipmapped bilinearly filtered images: an abrupt and very noticeable change in quality at boundaries where the renderer switches from one mipmap level to the next. Trilinear filtering solves this by doing a texture lookup and bilinear filtering on the ''two'' closest mipmap levels (one higher and one lower quality), and then [[Linear interpolation|linearly interpolating]] the results. This results in a smooth degradation of texture quality as distance from the viewer increases, rather than a series of sudden drops. Of course, closer than Level 0 there is only one mipmap level available, and the algorithm reverts to bilinear filtering. ===Anisotropic filtering=== [[Anisotropic filtering]] is the highest quality filtering available in current consumer 3D [[graphics processing unit|graphics cards]]. It evolved because both bilinear and trilinear filtering sample a square from the texture, which is only correct if the viewer is looking at the texture head-on. This results in blurriness when the textured surface is at an oblique angle - a very common case is the floor as it recedes into the distance. Anisotropic filtering corrects this by sampling in the correct [[trapezoid]] shape according to view angle. The resulting samples are then trilinearly filtered to generate the final color. ==See also== * [[Texture atlas]] [[Category:Texture filtering| ]] [[ar:ترشيح (رسوميات حاسوب)]] [[lt:Tekstūros filtravimas]] [[ja:テクスチャフィルタリング]]</text> </page> <page> <id>37205</id> <title>The Anatomy of Dependence</title> <text>{{Infobox Book | name = The Anatomy of Dependence | title_orig = 甘えの構造 | translator = [[John Bester]] | image = | image_caption = | author = [[Takeo Doi]] | illustrator = | cover_artist = | country = [[Japan]] | language = [[Japanese language|Japanese]] | series = | subject = Dependence, Japanese national characteristics, ''[[amae]]'' | genre = | publisher = [[Kodansha International]] | pub_date = [[1971 in books|1971]] | english_pub_date = [[1973 in books|1973]] | media_type = | pages = 170 | isbn = 0-87011-181-7 | dewey= 150/.19/5 | congress= BF575.D34 D6413 | oclc = 756181 | preceded_by = | followed_by = }} {{nihongo|'''''The Anatomy of Dependence'''''|甘えの構造|''Amae no kōzō''}} is a non-fiction book written by [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[psychoanalyst]] [[Takeo Doi]]. It was originally published in Japanese in 1971, and an English translation by [[John Bester]] was later published in 1973. The book describes at length Doi's concept of ''[[amae]]'', which he describes as a uniquely Japanese need to be in good favor with, and be able to depend on, the people around oneself. He likens this to behaving childishly in the assumption that parents will indulge you (Doi 2001:16), and claims that the ideal relationship is that of the parent-child, and all other relationships should strive for this degree of closeness (Doi 2001:39). ==Criticism== Doi's work has been criticized as being anecdotal and full of inaccuracies.

Philosophically, Medicinally, Historically, Opened and Cut Up'') is a book by [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]], first published in 1621. == Overview == Burton's book consists mostly of a collection of opinions of a multitude of writers, grouped under quaint and old-fashioned divisions; in a solemn tone Burton endeavoured to prove indisputable facts by weighty quotations.<ref name="FerriarGravity"/> The subjects discussed and determined by Burton ranged from the doctrines of religion to military discipline, from inland navigation to the morality of dancing-schools.<ref name="FerriarGravity"/> On its surface, the book is presented as a [[medicine|medical]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} textbook in which Burton applies his vast and varied learning,{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} in the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] manner, to the subject of [[melancholia]] (which includes what is now termed [[clinical depression]]). Though presented as a medical text, ''The Anatomy of Melancholy'' is as much a ''[[sui generis]]'' work of literature as it is a scientific or philosophical text, and Burton addresses far more than his stated subject. In fact, the ''Anatomy'' uses melancholy as the lens through which all human emotion and thought may be scrutinized, and virtually the entire contents of a 17th-century library are marshalled into service of this goal.<ref name="theguardian1">{{cite news |title=The Book to End All Books|author=Nicholas Lezard|date=1 August 2001|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=15 April 2007 |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/print/0,3858,4240799-99939,00.html}}</ref> In his satirical preface to the reader, Burton's ''persona'' Democritus Junior explains, "I write of melancholy by being busy to avoid melancholy." The ''Anatomy'' is a wide-ranging document, containing digressions and commentary. Whatever its strengths as a medical text or as a historical document, it is the ''Anatomy'''s vast breadth &mdash; addressing topics such as digestion, goblins, the geography of America, and others<ref name="theguardian1" /> &mdash; and the particularly characteristic voice of its author that are most commonly cited by its admirers as the main sources of its appeal. Both satirical and serious in tone, the ''Anatomy'' is "vitalized by (Burton's) pervading humour",<ref>Émile Legouis, A History of English Literature (1926)</ref> and Burton's digressive and inclusive style, often verging on a [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream of consciousness]], consistently informs and animates the text. == Publication == An obsessive rewriter of his work, Burton published five revised and expanded editions of ''The Anatomy of Melancholy'' during his
