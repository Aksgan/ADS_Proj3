In essence, the modeling must be in accordance with the [[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure|VDI]] Guidelines 3782 Parts 1 and 2, 3783 Part 8, 3784 Part 2, and 3945 Part 3.<ref name="VDI">[http://www.vdi.de/vdi/english/index.php The VDI web site]</ref> For those who are interested, the full text of the TA Luft is available on the Internet. <ref name="TA Luft"/> ==AUSTAL2000== [[AUSTAL2000]] is an [[atmospheric dispersion modeling|atmospheric dispersion model]] for simulating the dispersion of air pollutants in the ambient [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. It was developed by Ingenieurbüro Janicke<ref name="Janicke">[http://www.janicke.de/htm/e_home.htm Web site of Ingenieurbüro Janicke]</ref> in Dunum, Germany under contract to the Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety. Although not named in the TA Luft, it is the reference dispersion model accepted as being in compliance with the requirements of Annex 3 of the TA Luft and the pertinent VDI Guidelines. It simulates the dispersion of air pollutants by utilizing a [[random walk]] process ([[Air pollution dispersion terminology|Lagrangian simulation model]]) and it has capabilities for [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|building effects]], complex terrain, [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|pollutant plume]] depletion by [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|wet or dry deposition]], and first order chemical reactions. It is available for download on the Internet free of cost.<ref name="AustalDownload">[http://www.austal2000.de/ Austal2000 download web site (in German)]</ref> Austal2000G is a similar model for simulating the dispersion of odours and it was also developed by Ingenieurbüro Janicke. The development of Austal 2000G was financed by three German states: Niedersachsen, Nordrhein-Westfalen and Baden Württenberg. ==Further reading== For those who are unfamiliar with air pollution dispersion modelling and would like to learn more about the subject, it is suggested that either one of the following books be read: *{{cite book | author=Turner, D.B. | title=Workbook of atmospheric dispersion estimates: an introduction to dispersion modeling| edition=2nd Edition| publisher=CRC Press | year=1994 | isbn=1-56670-023-X }} [http://www.crcpress.com/shopping_cart/products/product_detail.asp?sku=L1023&parent_id=&pc= www.crcpress.com] *{{cite book | author=Beychok, M.R. | title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]| edition=4th Edition| publisher=self-published | year=2005 | isbn=0-9644588-0-2}} [http://www.air-dispersion.com www.air-dispersion.com] ==See also== *[[Bibliography of atmospheric dispersion modeling]] *[[Air Quality Modeling Group]] *[[Air Resources Laboratory]] *[[AP 42 Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors]] *[[Atmospheric dispersion modeling]] *[[List of atmospheric dispersion models]] *[[UK Atmospheric Dispersion Modelling Liaison Committee]] *[[UK Dispersion Modelling Bureau]] ==External links== * [http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/environment/serv4.html UK Dispersion Modelling Bureau web site] * [http://www.admlc.org.uk/index.htm UK ADMLC web site] * [http://www.arl.noaa.gov/ Air Resources Laboratory (ARL)] * [http://www.epa.gov/oar/oaqps/organization/aqad/aqmg.html Air Quality Modeling Group] * [http://www.air-dispersion.com/feature.html Error propagation in air dispersion modeling] ==References== <references/> [[Category:Air dispersion modeling]] [[Category:Air pollution]] [[Category:Executive branch of the German Government]] [[de:Technische Anleitung zur Reinhaltung der Luft]]</text> </page> <page> <id>36627</id> <title>TBIL</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=February 2009}} '''TBIL''' is an abbreviation for '''Tiny BASIC Interpreter Language'''.

It evolved from [[ARPANET]], which was the world's first [[wide area network]] and a predecessor of the [[Internet]]. The [[TCP/IP]] Model is sometimes called the ''Internet Model'' or the ''[[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] Model. The TCP/IP model, or [[Internet Protocol Suite]], describes a set of general design guidelines and implementations of specific networking protocols to enable computers to communicate over a [[Computer network|network]]. TCP/IP provides end-to-end connectivity specifying how data should be formatted, addressed, transmitted, [[routing|routed]] and received at the destination. Protocols exist for a variety of different types of communication services between computers. TCP/IP, sometimes referred to as the ''Internet model'', has four [[abstraction layer]]s as defined in RFC 1122. This layer architecture is often compared with the seven-layer [[OSI Reference Model]]; using terms such as ''Internet reference model'', incorrectly, however, because it is descriptive while the OSI Reference Model was intended to be prescriptive, hence being a reference model. The TCP/IP model and related protocols are maintained by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF). {{IPstack}} ==Key architectural principles== An early architectural document, RFC 1122, emphasizes architectural principles over layering.<ref>[ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc1958.txt Architectural Principles of the Internet], RFC 1958, B. Carpenter, June 1996</ref> * [[End-to-end principle|End-to-End Principle]]: This principle has evolved over time. Its original expression put the maintenance of state and overall intelligence at the edges, and assumed the Internet that connected the edges retained no state and concentrated on speed and simplicity. Real-world needs for firewalls, network address translators, web content caches and the like have forced changes in this principle.<ref>[http://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy558/papers/Rethinking_2001.pdf Rethinking the design of the Internet: The end to end arguments vs. the brave new world], Marjory S. Blumenthal, David D. Clark, August 2001</ref> * [[Robustness Principle]]: "In general, an implementation must be conservative in its sending behavior, and liberal in its receiving behavior. That is, it must be careful to send well-formed datagrams, but must accept any datagram that it can interpret (e.g., not object to technical errors where the meaning is still clear)." <ref>[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0791.txt?number=791 p.23 INTERNET PROTOCOL DARPA INTERNET PROGRAM PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION September 1981 Jon Postel Editor]</ref> "The second part of the principle is almost as important: software on other hosts may contain deficiencies that make it unwise to exploit legal but obscure protocol features." <ref>[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122#page-12 Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Communication Layers p.13 October 1989 R. Braden, Editor]</ref> Even when the layers are examined, the assorted architectural documents—there is no single architectural model such as ISO 7498, the OSI reference model—have fewer and less rigidly-defined layers than the OSI model, and thus provide an easier fit for real-world protocols. In point of fact, one frequently referenced document, RFC 1958, does not contain a stack of layers. The lack of emphasis on layering is a strong difference between the IETF and OSI approaches. It only refers
