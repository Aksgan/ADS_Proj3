The latter would then be tailored to perform a specific task, such as image processing or pattern matching, as quickly as a dedicated piece of hardware. Once the task was done, the hardware could be adjusted to do some other task. This resulted in a hybrid computer structure combining the flexibility of software with the speed of hardware; unfortunately this idea was far ahead of its time in needed electronic technology. In the 1980s and 1990s there was a renaissance in this area of research with many proposed reconfigurable architectures developed in industry and academia,<ref name="Bobda2007">C.

The world's first commercial reconfigurable computer, the Algotronix CHS2X4, was completed in 1991. It was not a commercial success, but was promising enough that [[Xilinx]] (the inventor of the [[FPGA|Field-Programmable Gate Array]], FPGA) bought the technology and hired the Algotronix staff.<ref>[http://www.algotronix.com/people/tom/album.html Algotronix History]</ref> == Current systems == The reconfigurable computers can be categorized in two classes of architectures: hybrid computer and fully [[FPGA]] based computers. Both architectures are designed to transport the benefits of reconfigurable logic to large scale computing. They can be used in traditional CPU cluster computers and network infra structures. The hybrid computer combine a single or a couple of reconfigurable logic chip, FPGAs, with a standard microprocessor [[CPU]] by exchanging e.g. one CPU of a multi CPU board with a FPGA, also known as [[hybrid-core computing]], or adding a [[Conventional PCI|PCI]] or [[PCI Express]] based FPGA expansion card to the computer. Simplified, they are [[Von Neumann architecture|Von-Neumann]] based architectures with an integrated FPGA accelerator. This architectural compromise results in an reduced scalability of hybrid computers and raises their power consumption. They have the same bottlenecks as all von Neumann based architectures have nevertheless it enables users to get an acceleration of their algorithm without losing their standard CPU based environment. A relatively new class are the fully FPGA based computers. This class usually contains no CPUs or uses the CPUs only as interface to the network environment. Their benefit is to transport the energy efficiency and scalability of FPGAs fully without compromise to their users. Depending on the Architecture of the interconnection between the FPGAs these machines are fully scalable even across single machine borders. Their bus system and overall architecture eliminate the bottlenecks of the von Neumann architecture. ;Examples for hybrid computers Known examples for hybrid computers are the [[Cray XD1|XD1]]. A machine designed by OctigaBay. Cray supercomputer company (not affiliated with SRC Computers) acquired OctigaBay and its reconfigurable computing platform, which Cray marketed as the [[Cray XD1|XD1]] until recently. [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]] sells the [[Reconfigurable Application-Specific Computing|RASC]] platform with their [[Altix]] series of supercomputers.<ref>[http://www.sgi.com/products/rasc/ RASC]</ref> [[SRC Computers, Inc.]] has developed a family of reconfigurable computers based on their IMPLICIT+EXPLICIT architecture and MAP processor. A current example of hybrid-core computers is [[Convey Computer]] Corporation's HC-1, which has both an Intel x86 processor and a Xilinx FPGA coprocessor. Another example is [[CompactRIO]] from [[National Instruments]]. ;Examples for fully FPGA based computers There are a several academic projects who tried to create fully FPGA based computers for several markets. One is the [http://www.sciengines.com/copacobana/ COPACOBANA] the Cost Optimized Codebreaker and Analyzer. A spin-off company [http://www.sciengines.com SciEngines] of the COPACOBANA-Project of the Universities of Bochum and Kiel in Germany currently sells the fourth generation of fully FPGA based computers, COPACOBANA RIVYERA (Reconfigure Versatally your raw architecture). ===Programming of reconfigurable computers=== The FPGA reconfiguration can be accomplished either via the traditional [[hardware description language]]s (HDLs), which can be generated directly or by using electronic design automation ("EDA") or electronic system level ("ESL") tools, employing high level languages like the graphical tool [[Starbridge Viva]] or [[C (programming language)|C]]-based languages like for example [[Impulse C]] from [[Impulse Accelerated Technologies]], [[SystemC]], [[Language for Instruction Set Architecture|LISA]], [[Handel-C]] from [[Celoxica]], [[DIME-C]] from [[Nallatech]], [http://www.c-to-verilog.com C-to-Verilog.com] or Mitrion-C from [[Mitrionics]], or graphical programming languages like [[LabVIEW]]. === Mitrionics === [[Mitrionics]] has developed a SDK that enables software written using a single assignment language to be compiled and executed on FPGA-based computers. The Mitrion-C software language and Mitrion processor enable software developers to write and execute applications on FPGA-based computers in the same manner as with other computing technologies, such as graphical processing units (“GPUs”), cell-based processors, parallel processing units (“PPUs”), multi-core CPUs, and traditional single-core CPU clusters. === SRC === SRC has developed a ''"Carte"'' compiler that takes an existing high-level languages like [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[Fortran]], and with a few modifications, compiles them for execution on both the FPGA and microprocessor. According to SRC literature{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}, "...application algorithms are written in a high-level language such as C or Fortran. Carte extracts the maximum parallelism from the code and generates pipelined hardware logic that is instantiated in the MAP. It also generates all the required interface code to manage the movement of data to and from the MAP and to coordinate the microprocessor with the logic running in the MAP." (note that SRC also allows a traditional HDL flow to be used). The SRC systems communicate via the SNAP memory interface, and/or the (optional) Hi-Bar switch. === National Instruments
