Critics of the bill complained that it was introduced hastily and was poorly thought out. [[Intention (criminal)|Intention]], they said, was often difficult to prove, and that the bill inadequately differentiated "joyriding" crackers like Gold and Schifreen from serious computer criminals. The Act has nonetheless become a model from which several other countries, including Canada and the [[Republic of Ireland]], have drawn inspiration when subsequently drafting their own information security laws. ==''R v Gold & Schifreen''== [[Robert Schifreen]] and Stephen Gold, using conventional [[home computer]]s and [[modem]]s in late 1984 and early 1985, gained unauthorised access to [[BT Group plc|British Telecom]]'s [[Prestel]] interactive [[viewdata]] service. While at a trade show, Schifreen by doing what latterly became known as [[Shoulder surfing (computer security)|shoulder surfing]], had observed the password of a Prestel engineer: the username was 22222222 and the password was 1234. This later gave rise to subsequent accusations that BT had not taken security seriously. Armed with this information, the pair explored the system, even gaining access to the personal message box of [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]]. Unknown to Schifreen and Gold, the Prestel computer network operated on a distributed basis and was intended to act as a hot standby in the event of the UK going to war - in the event that the primary UK military computers were down, the Prestel network could be used to control and launch the UK's nuclear missiles. Following discussions with GCHQ and MI6, it was decided to investigate Schifreen and Gold's activities, notwithstanding that, as freelancers for Micronet, a joint venture between BT and a major publishing house, the pair had informed their superiors of their discovery. Following interventions from GCHQ, Prestel installed monitors on both of the pair's modem connections and, acting on the information obtained, decided it was in the best interests of national security to arrest them. After some months of deliberation, it was decided to
