bring forward my two main objections to this view. A love that does not discriminate seems to me to forfeit a part of its own value, by doing an injustice to its object; and secondly, not all men are worthy of love."<ref name="freud"/> "Man has become, so to speak, a God with artificial limbs."<ref name="freud"/> (29) "Human life in common is only made possible when a majority comes together which is stronger than any separate individual and which remains united against all separate individuals. The power of this community is then set up as 'right' in opposition to the power of the individual, which is condemned as brute force."<ref name="freud"/> "The fateful question for the human species seems to me to be whether and to what extent their cultural development will succeed in mastering the disturbance of their communal life by the human instinct of aggression and self-destruction. It may be that in this respect precisely the present time deserves a special interest. Men have gained control over the forces of nature to such an extent that with their help they would no difficulty in exterminating one another to the last man. They know this, and hence comes a large part of their current unrest, their unhappiness and their mood of anxiety. And now it is to be expected that the other of the two 'Heavenly Powers', eternal Eros, will make an effort to assert himself in the struggle with his equally immortal adversary. But who can foresee with what success and with what result?"

The cksum command reads the file or files specified as arguments, or [[Standard streams|standard input]] if no arguments are provided, and calculates a checksum value, [[cyclic redundancy check]] (CRC) and the [[byte]] count. The checksum, number of bytes, and file name are written to [[Standard streams|standard output]]. The cksum command can be used to verify the equality of two files on different computers, such as a copy made over noisy transmission lines.<ref>[http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/cksum-invocation.html GNU cksum manual page available with most Unix-like distributions; invoked via man cksum]</ref>. (If the files are on the same computer, equality can be verified with the [[cmp (Unix)|cmp]] command.) The comparison made by the cksum command is not [[Cryptography|cryptographically]] secure. However, it is unlikely that an accidentally damaged file will produce the same checksum as the original file. == Interoperability == The standard cksum command, as found on most UNIX-like OS (including GNU/Linux, *BSD, Mac OS X, and Solaris) uses a CRC algorithm based on the [[ethernet]] standard frame check and is therefore interoperable between implementations. This is in contrast to the [[Sum (Unix)|sum command]], which is not as interoperable. On [[Tru64]] operating systems, the cksum command returns a different CRC value, unless the [[environment variable]] <code>CMD_ENV</code> is set to “<code>xpg4</code>”. == Syntax == <source lang="bash"> cksum [ File ... ] </source> ==Usage example== <source lang="bash"> $ cksum test.txt 4038471504 75 test.txt $ </source> "4038471504" represents the checksum value.

The term evolved to distinguish such systems from the microscopic "[[assembler (nanotechnology)|assemblers]]" that [[nanotechnology]] may make possible. They are also sometimes called "Auxons", from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''auxein'' which means "to grow", or "[[von Neumann machine]]s" after [[John von Neumann]], who first rigorously studied the idea. This last term ("von Neumann machine") is less specific and also refers to a completely unrelated computer architecture proposed by von Neumann, so its use is discouraged where accuracy is important. Von Neumann himself used the term [[Universal Constructor]]. The term ''clanking replicator'' was used by Drexler<ref name=EoC>{{cite web| url=http://www.e-drexler.com/d/06/00/EOC/EOC_Chapter_4.html#section01of03| title=Engines of Abundance (Chapter 4) Clanking Replicators| work=Engines of Creation| first=K. Eric| last=Drexler| year=1986}}</ref>, is informal and is rarely used by others in popular or technical discussions. ==Basic concept== A [[self-replicating machine]] would need to have the capacity to gather energy and [[raw material]]s, process the raw materials into finished components, and then assemble them into a copy of itself. It is unlikely that this would all be contained within a single [[wiktionary:monolith|monolithic]] structure, but would rather be a group of cooperating machines or an [[automatic factory|automated factory]] that is capable of manufacturing all of the machines that make it up. The factory could produce mining [[robot]]s to collect raw materials, construction robots to put new machines together, and repair robots to maintain itself against wear and tear, all without human intervention or direction. The advantage of such a system lies in its ability to expand its own capacity rapidly and without additional human effort; in essence, the initial investment required to construct the first clanking replicator would have an arbitrarily large payoff with no additional labor cost, with future returns discounted by their [[present value]]. Such a [[machine]] violates no [[physical law]]s, and we
