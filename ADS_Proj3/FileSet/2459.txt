State University]]'s [[CYCLONE]] computer (a derivative of the [[Illiac]]) to play simple, recognizable tunes through an amplified speaker that had been attached to the system originally for administrative and diagnostic purposes. A recording of an interview with Stuart and his [[computer music]] was broadcast nationally on the [[NBC]] [[radio network]] program [[Monitor (NBC Radio)|Monitor]] on February 10, 1962. In a subsequent interview with the ''Harold Journal'', [[Navel Hunsaker]], head of the [[Utah State University]] mathematics department, said of Stuart, "He always was a whiz with calculators." From the late 1970s, Stuart mentored [[John Carlsen]], who later contributed to the rapid growth of PC sound-card maker [[Media Vision]] and to [[SigmaTel]]. ===Control Data=== In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Stuart worked for [[Control Data Corporation]] (CDC) -- where [[Seymour Cray]] designed the [[CDC 6600]], the first commercial supercomputer. ===Zytrex=== In the 1980s, Stuart worked for [[Zytrex]], which manufactured CMOS [[Programmable Array Logic|PAL]] [[programmable logic devices]] (PLDs). ===Real-time clocks=== Stuart conceived installing battery-operated [[real-time clock]]s into computers, for which he received royalties until nearly 2000. Stuart jokingly admits contributing to the [[Year 2000 problem]]. ==Preserving computer history== Stuart owns the first [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-11]] to enter California and often visits the [[Computer History Museum]] in [[Mountain View, California]]. ==See also== * [[computer audio]] * [[E-mu Systems]] * [[Robert Moog]] ==External links== * [http://www.zyvra.org/lafarr LaFarr Stuart's Home Page] {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME =Stuart, LaFarr | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH =July 6, 1934 | PLACE OF BIRTH =[[Clarkston, Utah]], [[United States|U.S.A.]] | DATE OF DEATH = | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Stuart, LaFarr}} [[Category:1934 births]] [[Category:American computer programmers]] [[Category:Control Data Corporation]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:People from Cache County, Utah]] [[Category:Computer real-time clocks]]</text> </page> <page> <id>21036</id> <title>LabVantage Solutions</title> <text>{{orphan|date=January 2010}} '''LabVantage Solutions, Inc.''' is a [[laboratory information management system]] (LIMS) provider based in [[Bridgewater Township, New Jersey|Bridgewater]], [[New Jersey]].

The significance of this merger is that it heavily impacts the LIMS market. With LabVantage product SAPPHIRE's most advanced technology and SQL*LIMS business's most experienced and globalized personnel, this combination thrusts the new LabVantage to become the number 1 LIMS provider in the industry. The purchase immediately opened LabVantage's market to all continents except Antarctica, giving the company the most global coverage in the LIMS industry throughout the world today.

Some are bench-top for dispensing the labels while others include the application of the label to the item (such as a package). Label dispensers are designed with varying sizes and features which are often specific to the type of label they can dispense and to the degree of automation desired. The labels are applied by either manual application or automatic application. Automatic application are basically of two types, tamp on or wipe on. ==Use== Label dispensers have many uses. Imagine how many items you purchase have labels, almost everything. Those labels were either applied by a machine or by hand, and most likely were peeled from the backing paper using some sort of label dispenser. Some of the more popular are [[bulk mailing]], [[manufacturing]], [[packaging]], [[food and beverage]], [[fast food]], photo labs, and more. ==Manual label dispenser== Patents on Manual [[label]] dispensers go back to the 1920s. They are designed for light-duty use. They are operated by hand and are not automated, but still assist in the process of removing [[label]]s from their liners. Many manual [[label]] dispensers can dispense multiple rolls at once. Operation is performed by pulling the liner/backing paper around a plate or bar which causes the [[label]] to peel away from the backing paper. This happens because the backing paper is usually thinner than the [[label]] itself and is also underneath. When the liner is forced around a tight radius the [[label]] lifts away and protrudes through the front or top of the dispenser. ==Semi-automatic label dispenser== Electric Semi-automatic label dispensers were first patented in the early 1970s. They were originally designed for multiple-row address labels for [[bulk mailing]] houses. On average a good mailing house employee could apply approximately 500 labels per hour to envelopes. The label dispenser increased this to over 2,000 per hour. These dispensers advance individual or multiple-row labels and remove them from their lining similar to a manual dispenser, but instead of manually pulling on the liner, label advancement occurs when a trigger on the dispenser detects the absence of a label, such as when the operator removes the label. The sensor then closes the circuit and engages the
