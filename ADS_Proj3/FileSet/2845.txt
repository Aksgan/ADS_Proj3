war with each other in pursuit of land, resources, and superiority over fellow man. Swords and magic are commonplace and with each passing year comes sharper swords and more potent magic. Fighters, archers, and wizards lay siege to enemy castles where citizens hide in fear. The entire world was engulfed in constant warfare. In an effort to put an end to the wars, King Kamin, ruler of the most prosperous country in the land, commissioned his subjects to create a weapon of terrible destruction. The weapon was to be named "Mech", the ancient word for peace. It was the king's intent to use the weapon to force the other kingdoms towards a period of peace and prosperity. However, peace always comes at great cost. The king was betrayed by his subjects and the plans for the weapon were leaked to enemy lands. Before King Kamin was able to put an end to the fighting, his enemies built mechs of their own. However, they did not intend to use mechs for the benefit of mankind. The weapon intended to bring peace instead brought death, famine and destruction across the land. Cities were set a flame by the terrible power of the mech. Farmland was razed and kingdoms crumbled. Each passing year brought more destruction. Over ten years have passed since the start of the war. Mechs are no longer in production. Armies have been diminished and war funds are being used to fund the rebuilding of kingdoms. However, the war is not yet over! Reconnaissance spies have spotted an abandoned mech on the outskirts of your kingdom while surveying an enemy kingdom. The king has ordered your troops to capture the abandoned mech and sneak it in to the enemy's castle. Assault the enemy castle and use the mech to burn your way to victory! Peace is finally at hand, but who will be the one to restore it? ===Languages and tools=== * Client for contestants: [[C++]] * Server: [[C++]] ==2006 - MechMania XII: "Pier to Pier Piracy"== <!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Mm_2006_shirt_front.png|thumb|2006 T-Shirt Front|{{deletable image-caption|1=Friday, 15 August 2008}}]] --> [[Image:mm 2006 debug 1.png|thumb|2006 Debug visualizer]] [[Image:mm 2006 debug 2.png|thumb|2006 Debug visualizer]] * Sponsor: [[Morgan Stanley]] * Website: http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2006/mechmania.php ===Gameplay=== * A turn based tactical vector based naval combat ===Story=== Flipper[1] the dolphin is at war with his evil sister Flapper[2]. Flapper read about [[Flapper|her namesakes from the 1920's]] on the Internet, and has since taken to wearing a dress and a wig. Flipper thinks it's stupid because clothes and hair just slow you down while swimming, but Flapper insists "It's all the rage, the guys at the [[HavenCo|Sealand data center]] love it!" To prove his point to the High Court of Bickering, Flipper must collect all the Wikipedia archive CDs he can (the discs were created by spoiled rich children, so they're all CD-RWs, making it easy for him to replace the article on [[Flappers]] with a simple redirect to [[Dolphin]]). Unfortunately, Flipper lost one of his namesake limbs to a freak motorboat accident off the coast of Bermuda a few years back (don't ask), so he has called upon you and your crew of software pirates to aid in his quest. (Oh, and if you find a burned copy of [[Iron Maiden|Iron Orca]]'s "[[Killers (Iron Maiden album)|Killer Whale]]," Flipper wouldn't mind adding it to his collection, but don't mention that to the judge.) To make things a little more interesting, Flapper has also hired her own team of software pirates to recapture Wikipedia archive CDs from you (she intends to remove any references to lack of clothing and hair from the Dolphin article), and moreover seize Flipper's CD collection to prove that he is a music thief, with bad taste at that (Flipper begs to differ on the latter point). Thus begins the pier to pier piracy… [1] Flipper was so named because their dad loves playing pinball. [2] Flapper was named after the "FLAPON\r\n\r\n" command in AIM's [[TOC protocol]] because their mom loves chatting with penguins online ("They're such great software developers! We, as dolphins, have a lot to learn from them."). ===Dev Team=== *Jacob Lee *Jason Roth *Joe Re *Sameer Sundresh (story author) ===Languages and tools=== * Client for contestants: [[C++]] * 3D 'spiff' visualizer: [[C++]] with [[OGRE3D]] * 2D 'debug' visualizer: [[Python (programming language)|Python]] with [[pyGame]] * Server: [[Python (programming language)|Python]] ===Winners=== The winner for the 2006 competition was team NOOP from University of Missouri-Rolla which consists of Raymond Myers, Charles Huber, and James Jolly. ==2007 - MechMania XIII: "Dance Like You Want To Win"== [[Image:Mm13 screenshot 1.jpg|thumb|2007 visualizer]] * Tagline: "Let's Dance" * Sponsor: [[Google]] * Website: http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2007/mechmania.aspx ===Gameplay=== A turn based tactical grid based land combat, with dancing. ===Story=== The 13th installment will be released on October 13, 2007 ===Dev Team=== *Andres Tack *David Majnemer *Dennis Griffith *Jacob Lee *Joe Re *Casey Lewis *Vijay Ramesh ===Languages and tools=== * Client for contestants: [[C++]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]] * 2D visualizer: [[Python (programming language)|Python]] via [[pyGame]] * Server: [[Python (programming language)|Python]] ===Winners=== The winner for the 2007 competition was team Robot Pirate Ninjas of /dev/null of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. ==Recurring themes== * Mechs * [[Quad laser]], a la "No one can defeat the quad laser" humour as many competitions' top3 teams use strategies employing unit stacking or combining techniques.
