context-sensitivity between types. *''Junction theory anticipates that the various interfaces between tracts and their respective coding grammars will correspond to linguistic R&D now subsumed under distinct titles and demonstrate the utility of dealing with them as the integral components of a larger unified model.'' For example, the 'sememic' data of J-trees lacks the ambiguity and imprecision of lexical strings and is therefore an attractive candidate for use in rational forms of mental modeling. The construction of algorithms to encode this data type as lexical strings forces the analyst to confront the subtleties of morphology (e.g., word-building) and the logic of similarity and difference associated with the principles of semiotics. By way of further illustration: The data type developed for the 'lexical coding space' (tract) of the JG model at its inception served readily as input to the coding algorithms required for voice synthesis (as described above). The overall perspective which emerged in this case was a trace from phonemic representation, to phonetic representation, to the computerized generation of wave forms simulating voice. ''In sum, junction theory argues for the utility of operating from the perspective of a comprehensive, unified model with interlocking components - at least to the extent that the 'big picture' comes into focus.'' ==Cross-Fertilization== Some theoreticians have suggested that it would be productive to merge certain features of junction grammar with other models. Millett and Lonsdale, in fact, have proposed an expansion of Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) to create junction trees.<ref>Millet, Ronald and Lonsdale, Deryle (2005). “Expanding Tree Adjoining Grammar to Create Junction Grammar Trees.” ''Proceedings of the Seventh International Workshop on Tree Adjoining Grammar and Related Formalisms'', pg. 162-170; BC, Canada: Simon Fraser University.

Inasmuch as the addition of modules entails addition of data types and their dictionaries, reference was made in the literature to such future expansion as a function of `orders of specificity,' with each module or significant rule refinement ascending to a higher order, as it were.<ref>Lytle,Eldon G., “The Evolution of Junction Grammar” (1977). ''Translation Sciences Institute, '' Brigham Young University, September 1975, with minor revisions in April 1976, and October, 1977. See `Orders of Specificity.’[http://www.junction-grammar.com/html/the_evolution_of_junction_gram.htm]</ref> ===`LANGUAGE, THOUGHT, and REALITY'=== JG had - through its use of non-verbal data types - tacitly implemented Whorf’s expanded definition of language from its inception. To wit: <blockquote>...The linguistic order embraces all symbolism, all symbolic process, all process of reference and of logic...<ref>Carroll, John B., editor (1998) ''Language, Thought, and Reality: Selected Writings of Benjamin Lee Whorf.'' THE MIT PRESS, pg. 248-49.</ref></blockquote> At that point where formal development of the module for ''Level 1'' (the `real’ world) was contemplated, it became apparent that JG was graduating from a model managing the connection between MIND and EXPRESSION as a matter of linkage between familiar and readily representable data types (e.g., between the sememic data of the ‘mind tract’ and those required for the 'vocal tract') ... to a model which must now also make explicit the connection between MIND and REALITY in a general way among a profusion of data types systematically written upon by MIND in the ‘cold and dreary’ world itself. The fact of the matter was that even though ''Level 1'' had been occupying space in the schematic from its inception, with the exception of voice synthesis, no ‘order of specificity’ had as yet been implemented in JG to formalize the linkage between sememic data and forms of physical reality. [[File:WhorfFullModel.png|frame|alt=JG Upgrade Model|left|Graphic depicting Benjamin Whorf's Full Conceptual Model of Language.]] That the linkage existed was simply a matter of observation: Each time an instruction was given and carried out, for example, the structuring specified by the instruction was realized in the physical media to which the terms of the language referred. Ditto for the relation between recipes and cakes, blueprints and houses, constitutions and governments, etc. In each case, the linguistic relations became real, with the referents to which they applied representing themselves - a circumstance referred to in the parlance of JG as ''reflexive symbolism''. As the ramifications of this scenario were examined, it became apparent that the emergent ‘JG Upgrade Model’ was now making direct contact with Benjamin Whorf’s full conceptual model, which saw structuring in the world at large as a ''physical'' extension of the language in MIND, while writing and speech - by way of comparison - were ''rational'' extensions of language in MIND. To quote Whorf: <blockquote> All that I have to say on the subject that may be new is of the PREMONITION IN LANGUAGE of the unknown, vaster world - that world of which the physical is but a surface or skin, and yet which we ARE IN, and BELONG TO ... Speech is the best show man puts on ... But we suspect the watching Gods perceive that the order in which his amazing set of tricks builds up to a great climax has been stolen - from the Universe! <ref>Carroll (1998), pg. 252</ref> </blockquote> Here then was the explanation for the relevance of JG’s fundamental constituent relations to external relationships and the reason why Lytle had been able to represent articulatory structuring with junction operations. There is indeed a linguistic linkage between MIND and REALITY ... and hence, theoretically, a 'linguistic' description for every structured phenomenon. This, perhaps, portends the ultimate ascent of linguistic science to a level of prominence previously envisioned only by Whorf. (We resume discussion of this eventuality below.) ===MIND over MATTER=== While not always making the role of language explicit in the process, MIND as the well-spring of creation and control had also been articulated by such luminaries as Sir James Jeans: <blockquote>Today there is a wide measure of agreement, which
