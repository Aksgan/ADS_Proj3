before by broken lines. In this game, if nature selects t1 as player 1's type, the game played will be like the very first game described, except that player 2 does not know it (and the very fact that this cuts through his information sets disqualify it from [[subgame]] status). There is one ''separating'' [[perfect Bayesian equilibrium]]; i.e. an equilibrium in which different types do different things. If both types play the same action (pooling), an equilibrium cannot be sustained. If both play ''D'', player 2 can only form the belief that he is on either node in the information set with probability 1/2 (because this is the chance of seeing either type). Player 2 maximises his payoff by playing ''D' ''. However, if he plays ''D' '', type 2 would prefer to play ''U''. This cannot be an equilibrium. If both types play ''U'', player 2 again forms the belief that he is at either node with probability 1/2. In this case player 2 plays ''D' '', but then type 1 prefers to play ''D''. If type 1 plays ''U'' and type 2 plays ''D'', player 2 will play ''D' '' whatever action he observes, but then type 1 prefers ''D''. The only equilibrium hence is with type 1 playing ''D'', type 2 playing ''U'' and player 2 playing ''U' '' if he observes ''D'' and randomising if he observes ''U''. Through his actions, player 1 has [[signaling games|signalled]] his type to player 2. == Axiomatic formulation == Game theory is known to be a mathematical theory. It is possible to carry out an axiomatic formulation of the above-stated game tree structure. Formally, a finite game in extensive form is a structure <math> \Gamma = \langle\mathcal{K}, \mathbf{H}, [ (\mathbf{H}_i)_{i \in \mathcal{I} } ], \{ A(H) \}_{H \in \mathbf{H} } ], a , \rho, u \rangle</math> where: * <math>\mathcal{K} = \langle V, v^0, T, p\rangle</math> is a finite tree with a set of nodes <math> V </math>, a unique initial node <math>v^0 \in V</math>, a set of terminal nodes <math>T \subset V</math> (let <math>D = V \setminus T</math> be a set of decision nodes) and an immediate predecessor function <math> p: V \rightarrow D </math> on which the rules of the game are represented, * <math>\mathbf{H}</math> is a partition of <math>D</math> called an information partition, * <math> A(H) </math> is a set of actions available for each information set <math>H \in \mathbf{H}</math> which forms a partition on the set of all actions <math>\mathcal{A}</math>. * <math>a: V \setminus \{ v^0 \} \rightarrow \mathcal{A}</math> is an action partition corresponding each edge <math>v</math> to a single action <math>a(v)</math>, fulfilling: <math> \forall v \in \forall H \in \mathbf{H} </math>, restriction <math>a_v: s(v) \rightarrow A(H)</math> of <math>a</math> on <math>s(v)</math> is a bijection. * <math>\mathcal{I} = \{ 1, ..., I \} </math> is a finite set of players, <math>0</math> is (a special player called) nature, and <math> (\mathbf{H}_i)_{i \in I \cup \{ 0 \} }</math> is a player partition of information set <math>\mathbf{H}</math>. Let <math>\iota(v) = \iota(H)</math> be a single player that makes a move at node <math>v \in H</math>. * <math>\rho = \{ \rho_H: A(H) \rightarrow [0, 1] | H \in \mathbf{H}_0 \}</math> is a family of probabilities of the actions of nature, and * <math>u = (u_i)_{i \in \mathcal{I}}: T \rightarrow \Re^\mathcal{I}</math> is a payoff profile function. ==References== * [[Melvin Dresher|Dresher M.]] (1961).

The term comes from the concept of an [[Binary_operation#External_binary_operations|external binary operation]] which is a binary operation that draws from some ''external set''. To be more specific, a '''left external binary operation''' on ''S'' over ''R'' is a function <math>f : R \times S \rightarrow S</math> and a '''right external binary operation''' on ''S'' over ''R'' is a function <math>f : S \times R \rightarrow S</math> where ''S'' is the set the operation is defined on, and ''R'' is the external set (the set the operation is defined ''over''). == Generalizations == The ''external'' concept is a generalization rather than a specialization, and as such, it is different from many terms in mathematics. A similar but opposite concept is that of an ''internal binary function'' from ''R'' to ''S'', defined as a function <math>f : R \times R \rightarrow S</math>. Internal binary functions are like binary functions, but are a form of specialization, so they only accept a subset of the domains of binary functions. Here we list these terms with the [[Function_(mathematics)|function]] [[Method signature|signatures]] they imply, along with some examples: * <math>f : Q \times R \rightarrow S</math> ([[binary function]]) **
