This was introduced by the Bell System in the 1970s, following a 1976 FCC order. Since then, it has gained popularity worldwide, and is a de facto international standard. ===Europe=== Outside of the US, Interconnection or "Interconnect regimes" also take into account the associated commercial arrangements. As an example of the use of commercial arrangements, the focus by the EU has been on "encouraging" incumbents to offer bundles of network features that will enable competitors to provide services that compete directly with the incumbent. Further the interconnect regime decided upon by the regulator has a major impact on the development/rate of growth of market segments. According to Source8 (an EU based consultancy) two examples from the UK of this are: * The decision about revenue sharing on local rate numbers was a contributory factor in the explosive growth in dial internet. * The asynchronous reciprocity that exists between fixed and mobile termination rates. ==See also== * [[Customer-premises equipment]] * [[Demarc extension]] * [[Demarcation point]] * [[Forced-access regulation]] * [[Registered jack]] * [[Terminal equipment]] * [[Termination rates]] === US regulation === * [[:Category:United States federal communications legislation]] * [[Communications Act of 1934]] * [[Hush-A-Phone v.

Originally the term interdisciplinary is applied within education and training pedagogies to describe studies that use methods and insights of several established disciplines or traditional fields of study. Interdisciplinarity involves researchers, students, and teachers in the goals of connecting and integrating several academic schools of thought, professions, or technologies - along with their specific perspectives - in the pursuit of a common task. The [[epidemiology]] of [[AIDS]] or [[global warming]] require understanding of diverse disciplines to solve neglected problems. "Interdisciplinary" may be applied where the subject is felt to have been neglected or even misrepresented in the traditional disciplinary structure of research institutions, for example, [[women's studies]] or ethnic area studies. The [[adjective]] interdisciplinary is most often used in educational circles when researchers from two or more disciplines pool their approaches and modify them so that they are better suited to the problem at hand, including the case of the team-taught course where students are required to understand a given subject in terms of multiple traditional disciplines. For example, the subject of [[land use]] may appear differently when examined by different disciplines, for instance, [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[economics]], [[geography]], and [[politics]]. ==Development== Although interdisciplinary and interdisciplinarity are frequently viewed as twentieth century terms, the concept has historical antecedents, most notably [[Greek philosophy]]. <ref name="ausburg"> Ausburg, Tanya. ''Becoming Interdisciplinary: An Introduction to Interdisciplinary Studies.'' 2nd edition. New York: Kendall/Hunt Publishing, 2006.</ref> [[Julie Thompson Klein]] attests that "the roots of the concepts lie in a number of ideas that resonate through modern discourse—the ideas of a unified science, general knowledge, synthesis and the integration of knowledge" <ref> Klein, Julie Thompson. ''Interdisciplinarity: History, Theory, and Practice.'' Detroit: Wayne State University, 1990. </ref> while Giles Gunn says that [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[historians]] and [[dramatists]] took elements from other realms of knowledge (such as [[medicine]] or [[philosophy]]) to further understand their own material. <ref> Gunn, Giles. "Interdisciplinary Studies." Gibaldi, J., ed. ''Introduction to Scholarship in Modern Language and Literatures.'' New York: Modern Language Association, 1992. pp 239-240. </ref> Interdisciplinary programs sometimes arise from a shared conviction that the traditional disciplines are unable or unwilling to address an important problem. For example, social science disciplines such as [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]] paid little attention to the social analysis of [[technology]] throughout most of the twentieth century. As a result, many social scientists with interests in technology have joined [[science and technology studies]] programs, which are typically staffed by scholars drawn from numerous disciplines. They may also arise from new research developments, such as [[nanotechnology]], which cannot be addressed without combining the approaches of two or more disciplines. Examples include [[quantum information processing]], an amalgamation of [[quantum physics]] and [[computer science]], and [[bioinformatics]], combining [[molecular biology]] with computer science. Some institutions of higher education offer accredited degree programs in Interdisciplinary Studies. Norfolk State University, a historically black institution located in Norfolk, VA, is one such example of this. At another level interdisciplinarity is seen as a remedy to the harmful effects of excessive specialization. On some views, however, interdisciplinarity is entirely indebted to those who specialize in one field of study—that is, without specialists, interdisciplinarians would have no information and no leading experts to consult. Others place the focus of interdisciplinarity on the need to transcend disciplines, viewing excessive specialization as problematic both epistemologically and politically. When interdisciplinary collaboration or research results in new solutions to problems, much information is given back to the various disciplines involved. Therefore, both disciplinarians and interdisciplinarians may be seen in complementary relation to one another. JaCorey Royal was an excellent academic adventurer in the field of interdisciplinarity. ==Barriers== Because most participants in interdisciplinary ventures were trained in traditional disciplines, they must learn to appreciate differing perspectives and methods. For example, a discipline that places more emphasis on quantitative "rigor" may produce practitioners who think of themselves (and their discipline) as "more scientific" than others; in turn, colleagues in "softer" disciplines may associate quantitative approaches with an inability to grasp the broader dimensions of a problem. An interdisciplinary program may not succeed if its members remain stuck in their disciplines (and in disciplinary attitudes). From the disciplinary perspective, much interdisciplinary work may be seen as "soft," lacking in rigor, or ideologically motivated; these beliefs place barriers in the career paths of those who choose interdisciplinary work. For example, interdisciplinary grant applications are
