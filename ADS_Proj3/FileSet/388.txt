optimized for cell phones, as well as QR Codes and Data Matrix codes which can be read quickly and accurately with or without auto-focus. These open up a number of applications for consumers: * Movies: DVD/VHS movie catalogs * Music: CD catalogs, play MP3 when scanned * Book catalogs * Groceries, nutrition information, making shopping lists when the last of an item is used, etc. * Personal Property inventory (for insurance and other purposes) * Calling cards: 2D barcodes can store contact information for importing. * Brick and mortar shopping: Portable scanners can be used to record items of interest for looking up online at home. * Coupon management: weeding expired coupons. * Personal finance. Receipts can be tagged with a barcode label and the barcode scanned into personal finance software when entering. Later, scanned receipt images can then be automatically associated with the appropriate entries. Later, the bar codes can be used to rapidly weed out paper copies not required to be retained for tax or asset inventory purposes. * If retailers put barcodes on receipts that allowed downloading an electronic copy or encoded the entire receipt in a 2D barcode, consumers could easily import data into personal finance, property inventory, and grocery management software. Receipts scanned on a scanner could be automatically identified and associated with the appropriate entries in finance and property inventory software. A number of enterprise applications using cell phones are appearing: * Access control (ex. ticket validation at venues), inventory reporting (ex. tracking deliveries), asset tracking (ex. anti-counterfeiting).<ref name="Barcode reading apps for enterprise" >Barcode reading apps for enterprise, codeREADr.com, 2010.</ref> ZXing Barcode Scanner, an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] platform application, is one example of a barcode reader that has been optimized to work with a cellphone camera. Big in Japan's ShopSavvy and Occipital's RedLaser, among others, are examples of barcode reader apps for the [[iPhone]] optimized to work with a cellphone camera. There are also a few other [[iPhone]] apps, which integrates barcode scanner into Google shopping web site. === Housing types === The reader packaging can be distinguished as follows : ;Handheld scanner: with a handle and typically a trigger button for switching on the light source. ;Pen scanner (or wand scanner): a pen-shaped scanner that is swiped. ;Stationary scanner: wall- or table-mounted scanners that the barcode is passed under or beside. These are commonly found at the checkout counters of [[supermarket]]s and other [[retailer]]s. ;Fixed-position scanner: an industrial barcode reader used to identify products during manufacture or logistics. Often used on conveyor tracks to identify cartons or pallets which need to be routed to another process or shipping location. Another application joins [[holographic]] scanners with a [[checkweigher]] to read bar codes of any orientation or placement, and weighs the package. Systems like this are used in factory and farm automation for [[quality management]] and shipping. ;PDA scanner (or Auto-ID PDA): a [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] with a built-in barcode reader or attached barcode scanner. ;Automatic reader: a back office equipment to read barcoded documents at high speed (50,000/hour). ;Cordless scanner (or Wireless scanner): a cordless barcode scanner is operated by a battery fitted inside it and is not connected to the electricity mains == Methods of connection == === Early serial interfaces === Early barcode scanners, of all formats, almost universally used the then-common [[RS232]] serial interface. This was an electrically simple means of connection and the software to access it is also relatively simple, although needing to be written for specific computers and their serial ports. === Proprietary interfaces === There are a few other less common interfaces. These were used in large [[Point of sale|EPOS]] systems with dedicated hardware, rather than attaching to existing commodity computers. In some of these interfaces, the scanning device returned a "raw" signal proportional to the intensities seen while scanning the barcode. This was then decoded by the host device. In some cases the scanning device would convert the symbology of the barcode to one that could be recognized by the host device, such as [[Code 39]]. === Keyboard wedges === [[Image:Ps-2-ports.jpg|thumb|right|[[PS/2 connector|PS/2]] keyboard and mouse ports]] With the popularity of the [[Personal computer|PC]] and its standard keyboard interface, it became ever easier to connect physical hardware to a PC and so there was commercial demand similarly to reduce the complexity of the associated software. "Keyboard wedge" hardware plugged between the PC and its normal keyboard, with characters from the barcode scanner appearing exactly as if they had been typed at the keyboard. This made the addition of simple barcode reading abilities to existing programs very easy, without any need to change them, although it did require some care by the user and could be restrictive in the content of the barcodes that could be handled. ===USB=== Later barcode readers began to use [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] connectors rather than the keyboard port, as this became a more convenient hardware option. To retain the easy integration with existing programs, a device driver called a "software wedge" could be used, to emulate the keyboard-impersonating behaviour of the old "keyboard wedge" hardware. In many cases a choice of USB interface types ([[USB HID|HID]], CDC) are provided. Some have [[Powered USB]]. === Wireless networking === Modern handheld barcode readers are operated in [[wireless network]]s according to [[IEEE 802.11g]] (WLAN) or [[IEEE 802.15.3]] ([[Bluetooth]]). However, such configuration limits the time of operation from [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] or [[rechargeable battery]] and required recharging at least after a shift of operation. == Resolution == The scanner resolution is measured by the size of the dot of light emitted by the reader. If this dot of light is wider than any bar or space in the bar code, then it will overlap two elements (two spaces or two bars) and it may produce wrong output. On the other hand, if a too small dot of light is used, then it can misinterpret any spot on the bar code making the final output wrong. The most commonly used dimension is 13 [[Thou (unit of length)|mils]] (0.33 [[millimetre|mm]]),
