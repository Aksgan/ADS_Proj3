but contains much that is of enormous value. He made a number of innovations. ===Outer arrays=== Taguchi's designs aimed to allow greater understanding of variation than did many of the traditional designs from the [[analysis of variance]] (following Fisher). Taguchi contended that conventional [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] is inadequate here as there is no way of obtaining a [[simple random sample|random sample]] of future conditions.<ref>Similar truisms about the [[problem of induction]] had been voiced by [[David Hume|Hume]] and (more recently) by [[W. Edwards Deming]] in his discussion of [[analytic studies]].</ref> In Fisher's [[design of experiments]] and [[analysis of variance]], experiments aim to reduce the influence of [[Randomized_block_design#Blocking_to_.22remove.22_the_effect_of_nuisance_factors|nuisance factor]]s to allow comparisons of the mean treatment-effects. Variation becomes even more central in Taguchi's thinking. Taguchi proposed extending each experiment with an "outer array" (possibly an [[orthogonal array]]); the "outer array" should simulate the random environment in which the product would function. This is an example of [[Nonprobability sampling|judgmental sampling]]. Many quality specialists have been using "outer arrays". Later innovations in outer arrays resulted in "compounded noise." This involves combining a few noise factors to create two levels in the outer array: First, noise factors that drive output lower, and second, noise factors that drive output higher. "Compounded noise" simulates the extremes of noise variation but uses fewer experimental runs than would previous Taguchi designs. ===Management of interactions=== ====Interactions, as treated by Taguchi==== Many of the orthogonal arrays that Taguchi has advocated are [[saturated array]]s, allowing no scope for estimation of interactions. This is a continuing topic of controversy. However, this is only true for "control factors" or factors in the "inner array". By combining an inner array of control factors with an outer array of "noise factors", Taguchi's approach provides "full information" on control-by-noise interactions, it is claimed. Taguchi argues that such interactions have the greatest importance in achieving a design that is robust to noise factor variation. The Taguchi approach provides more complete interaction information than typical fractional factorial designs, its adherents claim. *Followers of Taguchi argue that the designs offer rapid results and that [[interaction (statistics)|interaction]]s can be eliminated by proper choice of quality characteristics. That notwithstanding, a "confirmation experiment" offers protection against any residual interactions. If the quality characteristic represents the energy transformation of the system, then the "likelihood" of control factor-by-control factor interactions is greatly reduced, since "energy" is "additive".<!-- NEEDS EDITING. Citations are needed. Likelihood?? Additive energy?? Also, it is inappropriate to reference followers qua followers for substantive arguments.--> ====Inefficencies of Taguchi's designs==== * Interactions are part of the [[real world]]. In Taguchi's arrays, interactions are [[confounding|confounded]] and difficult to resolve. Statisticians in [[response surface methodology]] (RSM) advocate the "sequential assembly" of [[response surface methodology|designs]]: In the RSM approach, a [[screening]] design is followed by a "follow-up design" that resolves only the confounded interactions judged worth resolution. A second follow-up design may be added (time and resources allowing) to explore possible [[Higher-order statistics|high-order]] univariate effects of the remaining variables, as high-order univariate effects are less likely in variables already eliminated for having no linear effect. With the economy of [[screening]] designs and the flexibility of follow-up designs, sequential designs have great [[efficiency (statistics)|statistical efficiency]]. The sequential designs of [[response surface methodology]] require far fewer experimental runs than would a sequence of Taguchi's designs.<ref> Statisticians have developed designs that enable experiments to use fewer replications (or experimental runs), enabling savings over Taguchi's proposed designs: * {{cite book |author=[http://stats.lse.ac.uk/atkinson/ Atkinson, A.

His emphasis on ''loss to society'', techniques for investigating variation in experiments, and his overall strategy of system, parameter and tolerance design have been influential in improving manufactured quality worldwide<ref> Ben-Gal I.(2005), “On the Use of Data Compression Measures to Assess Robust Designs”, IEEE Trans. on Reliability, Vol. 54, no. 3, 381-388. Available at: http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~bengal/Journal%20Paper.pdf</ref>. Although some of the statistical aspects of the Taguchi methods are disputable, there is no dispute that they are widely applied to various processes. A quick search in related journals, as well as the World Wide Web, reveals that the method is being successfully implemented in diverse areas,such as the design of VLSI; optimization of
