Instead, the customer requests a withdrawal transaction from the machine, which prints a receipt. The customer then takes this receipt to a nearby sales clerk, who then exchanges it for cash from the till.<ref>[http://www.atmscrip.com/what_is_scrip.html What is Scrip ATM]</ref> A [[Teller Assist Unit]] may also share many of the same components as an ATM (including a vault), but they are distinct in that they are designed to be operated solely by trained personnel and not the general public, they do not integrate directly into interbank networks, and are usually controlled by a computer that is not directly integrated into the overall construction of the unit. ==Health== January 2011, scientists in England has proved that Automated Teller Machines 'as dirty as a public toilets'.

Techterms.Com. Accessed 2010-May-10.</ref>, allowing the user to [[Image scanning|scan]], and thereby [[photocopying|copy]], [[printing|print]], or [[fax]], multiple-page documents without having to manually replace each page. On most copiers, you have a choice of scanning on the flatbed or platen (the "glass") or through a document feeder. The vast majority of fax machines have an ADF, allowing the unattended sending of multi-page faxes. Due to the ubiquity of ADF in fax machines, some fax machine owners use the fax machine as a scanner, faxing multi-page documents to themselves. Document feeders are described by speed, in pages per minute or ppm, and capacity, usually in a range from 10 sheets to 200. There are two kinds of document feeders capable of two-sided (duplex) scanning: a '''reversing automatic document feeder''' or '''RADF''' scans one side of a page, then flips it and scans the other side. A '''duplexing automatic document feeder''' or '''DADF''' scans both sides in one pass. The advantage of the DADF is faster speed for two-sided originals. RADFs and DADFs are rated in images per minute (IPM), the number of sides they can scan each minute. ==References== {{reflist}} ==See also== *[[Duplex printing]] {{Compu-hardware-stub}} [[Category:Office equipment]] [[de:Automatischer Vorlagenwechsler]] [[ru:ADF]]</text> </page> <page> <id>2916</id> <title>Automatic system recovery</title> <text>{{Wikify|date=December 2010}} {{Orphan|date=February 2009}} '''Automatic system recovery''' is a device or process that detects a computer failure and attempts recovery.
