the case of less symmetric molecules the molecular term symbol contains the symbol of the [[group representation]] to which the molecular electronic state belongs. It has the general form: :<math>{}^{2S+1}\!\Lambda^{(+/-)}_{\Omega,(g/u)}</math> where * ''S'' is the total [[spin quantum number]] * &Lambda; is the projection of the orbital angular momentum along the internuclear axis * &Omega; is the projection of the total angular momentum along the internuclear axis * ''u''/''g'' is the parity * +/&minus; is the reflection symmetry along an arbitrary plane containing the internuclear axis ==&Lambda; quantum number== For atoms, we use ''S'', ''L'', ''J'' and ''M<sub>J</sub>'' to characterize a given [[quantum state|state]]. In linear molecules, however, the lack of spherical symmetry destroys the relationship <math>[\hat\mathbf L^2, \hat H]=0</math>, so ''L'' ceases to be a [[good quantum number]]. A new set of [[operator (physics)|operators]] have to be used instead: <math>\{\hat \mathbf S^2, \hat\mathbf{S}_z, \hat\mathbf{L}_z, \hat\mathbf{J}_z=\hat\mathbf{S}_z + \hat\mathbf{L}_z\}</math>, where the ''z''-axis is defined along the internuclear axis of the molecule. Since these [[commutative operation|operators commute]] with each other and with the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] on the limit of negligible spin-orbit coupling, their [[eigenvalue]]s may be used to describe a molecule state through the quantum numbers ''S'', ''M<sub>S</sub>'', ''M<sub>L</sub>'' and ''M<sub>J</sub>''. The cylindrical symmetry of a linear molecule ensures that positive and negative values of a given [[magnetic quantum number|''m<sub>l</sub>'']] for an [[electron]] in a [[molecular orbital]] will be [[degeneracy (mathematics)|degenerate]] in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. Different molecular orbitals are classified with a new quantum number, &lambda;, defined as :&lambda; = |''m<sub>l</sub>''| Following the spectroscopic notation pattern, molecular orbitals are designated by a smallcase Greek letter: for &lambda; = 0, 1, 2, 3,... orbitals are called &sigma;, &pi;, &delta;, &phi;... respectively. Now, the total ''z''-projection of ''L'' can be defined as :<math>M_L=\sum_i {m_l}_i.</math> As states with positive and negative values of ''M<sub>L</sub>'' are degenerate, we define :&Lambda; = |''M<sub>L</sub>''|, and a capital Greek letter is used to refer to each value: &Lambda; = 0, 1, 2, 3... are coded as &Sigma;, &Pi;, &Delta;, &Phi;... respectively. The molecular term symbol is then defined as :<sup>2''S''+1</sup>&Lambda; and the number of electron degenerate states (under the absence of spin-orbit coupling) corresponding to this term symbol is given by: * (2''S''+1)&times;2 if &Lambda; is not 0 * (2''S''+1) if &Lambda; is 0. ==&Omega; and spin-orbit coupling== Spin-orbit coupling lifts the degeneracy of the electronic states. This is because the ''z''-component of spin interacts with the ''z''-component of the orbital angular momentum, generating a total electronic angular momentum along the molecule axis '''J'''<sub>z</sub>. This is characterized by the ''M<sub>J</sub>'' quantum number, where :''M<sub>J</sub>'' = ''M<sub>S</sub>'' + ''M<sub>L</sub>''. Again, positive and negative values of ''M<sub>J</sub>'' are degenerate, so the pairs (''M<sub>L</sub>'', ''M<sub>S</sub>'') and (&minus;''M<sub>L</sub>'', &minus;''M<sub>S</sub>'') are degenerate: {(1, 1/2), (&minus;1, &minus;1/2)}, and {(1, &minus;1/2), (&minus;1, 1/2)} represent two different degenerate states. These pairs are grouped together with the quantum number &Omega;, which is defined as the sum of the pair of values (''M<sub>L</sub>'', ''M<sub>S</sub>'') for which ''M<sub>L</sub>'' is positive. Sometimes the equation :&Omega; = &Lambda; + ''M<sub>S</sub>'' is used (often &Sigma; is used instead of ''M<sub>S</sub>''). Note that although this gives correct values for &Omega; it could be misleading, as obtained values do not correspond to states indicated by a given pair of values (''M<sub>L</sub>'',''M<sub>S</sub>''). For example, a state with (&minus;1, &minus;1/2) would give an &Omega; value of &Omega; = |&minus;1| + (&minus;1/2) = &minus;1/2, which is wrong. Choosing the pair of values with ''M<sub>L</sub>'' positive will give a &Omega; = 3/2 for that state. With this, a '''level''' is given by :<math>{}^{2S+1}\Lambda_{\Omega}</math> Note that &Omega; can have negative values and subscripts ''r'' and ''i'' represent regular (normal) and inverted multiplets, respectively.<ref>p. 337, ''Molecular Spectra and Molecular Structure, Vol I - Spectra of Diatomic Molecules'', G. Herzberg, Reprint of Second Edition w/corrections, Malabar, Florida: Krieger Publishing Company, 1989. ISBN 0-89464-268-5</ref> For a <sup>4</sup>&Pi; term there are four degenerate (''M<sub>L</sub>'', ''M<sub>S</sub>'') pairs: {(1, 3/2), (&minus;1, &minus;3/2)}, {(1, 1/2), (&minus;1, &minus;1/2)}, {(1, &minus;1/2), (&minus;1, 1/2)}, {(1, &minus;3/2), (&minus;1, 3/2)}. These correspond to &Omega; values of 5/2, 3/2, 1/2 and &minus;1/2, respectively. Approximating the spin-orbit Hamiltonian to first order [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]], the energy level is given by :''E'' = ''A'' ''M<sub>L</sub>'' ''M<sub>S</sub>'' where ''A'' is the spin-orbit constant. For <sup>4</sup>&Pi; the &Omega; values 5/2, 3/2, 1/2 and &minus;1/2 correspond to energies of 3''A''/2, ''A''/2, &minus;''A''/2 and &minus;3''A''/2. Despite of having the same magnitude, levels of &Omega; = ±1/2 have different energies associated, so they are not degenerate. With that convention, states with different energies are given different &Omega; values. For states with positive values of ''A'' (which are said to be ''regular''), increasing values of &Omega; correspond to increasing values of energies; on the other hand, with ''A'' negative (said to be ''inverted'') the energy order is reversed. Including higher order effects can lead to a spin-orbital levels or energy that do not even follow the increasing value of &Omega;. When &Lambda; = 0 there is no spin-orbit splitting to first order in perturbation theory, as the associated energy is zero. So for a given ''S'', all of its ''M<sub>S</sub>'' values are degenerate. This degeneracy is lifted when spin-orbit interaction is treated to higher order in perturbation theory, but still states with same |''M<sub>S</sub>''| are degenerate in a non-rotating molecule. We can speak of a <sup>5</sup>&Sigma;<sub>2</sub> substate, a <sup>5</sup>&Sigma;<sub>1</sub> substate or a <sup>5</sup>&Sigma;<sub>0</sub> substate. Except for the case &Omega; = 0, these substates have a degeneracy of 2. ==Reflection through a plane containing the internuclear axis== There are an infinite number of planes containing the internuclear axis and hence there are an infinite number of possible reflexions. For any of these planes, molecular terms with &Lambda; > 0 always have a state which is symmetric with respect to this reflection and one state that is antisymmetric. Rather than labelling those situations as, e.g., <sup>2</sup>&Pi;<sup>±</sup>, the ± is omitted. For the &Sigma; states, however, this two-fold degeneracy disappears, and all &Sigma; states are either symmetric under any plane containing the internuclear axis, or antisymmetric. These two situations
