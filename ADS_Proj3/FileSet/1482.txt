of politeness from the owners of the FidoNet systems involved in the mail's transfer. It was common, however, for system operators to reserve the right to review the content of mail that passed through their system. Netmail allowed for the "attachment" of a single file to every message. This led to a series of "piggyback" protocols that built additional features onto FidoNet by passing information back and forth as file attachments. These included the automated distribution of files, and transmission of data for inter-BBS games. By far the most commonly-used of these piggyback protocols was '''Echomail''', public discussions similar to [[Usenet]] newsgroups in nature. Echomail was supported by a variety of software that collected up new messages from the local BBSes' public forums (the ''scanner''), compressed it using [[.arc|ARC]] or [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]], attached the resulting archive to a Netmail message, and sent that message to a selected system. On receiving such a message, identified because it was addressed to a particular "user", the reverse process was used to extract the messages, and a ''tosser'' put them back into the new system's forums. Echomail was so popular that for many users, Echomail ''was'' the FidoNet. Private person-to-person Netmail was relatively rare. ===Geographic structure=== FidoNet is politically organized into a tree structure, with different parts of the tree electing their respective coordinators. The FidoNet hierarchy consists of Zones, Regions, Networks, Nodes and Points broken down more-or-less geographically. The highest level is the Zone, which is largely continent-based: * Zone 1 is [[North America]] * Zone 2 is [[Europe]], Former [[Soviet Union]] Countries, and [[Israel]] * Zone 3 is [[Australasia]] * Zone 4 is [[Latin America]] (except [[Puerto Rico]]) * Zone 5 is [[Africa]] * Zone 6 is [[Asia]] (excluding Israel and the Asian parts of Russia, which are listed in Zone 2) -- On 26 July 2007 Zone 6 was removed, and all remaining nodes were moved to Zone 3.<ref>{{Citation | last = Shenkenberger | first = Carol | editor-last = Felten | editor-first = Bj‚Äùrn | date = 26 July 2007 | publication-date = 30 July 2007 | title = Removal of Zone 6 | periodical = FIDONEWS | volume =24 | issue= 31 | page = 2 | url = http://www.fidotel.com/public/fidonews/archive/2007/FIDO2431.htm | accessdate = 2010-10-08 | quote =With sadness I have removed the last entry for Zone6 as of this writing.

Zones 7-4095 are used for "othernets"; groupings of nodes which use Fido-compatible software to carry their own independent message areas without being in any way controlled by FidoNet's political structure. Using un-used zone numbers would ensure that each network would have a unique set of addresses, avoiding potential routing conflicts and ambiguities for systems that belonged to more than one network. ===FidoNet addresses=== FidoNet addresses explicitly consist of a '''Zone''' number, a '''Network''' number (or region number), and a '''Node''' number. They are written in the form <tt>Zone:Network/Node</tt>{{sfn|Schuyler|1992|loc=Section 4.0}}. The FidoNet structure also allows for semantic designation of region, host, and hub status for particular nodes, but this status is not directly indicated by the main address. For example, consider a node located in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], [[United States|USA]] with an assigned node number is 918, located in Zone 1 (North America), Region 19, and Network 170. The full FidoNet address for this system would be <tt>1:170/918</tt>. The ''region'' was used for administrative purposes, and was only part of the address if the node was listed directly underneath the Regional Coordinator, rather than one of the networks that were used to divide the region further. FidoNet policy requires that each FidoNet system maintain a ''nodelist'' of every other member system. Information on each node includes the name of the system or BBS, the name of the node operator, the geographic location, the telephone number, and software capabilities. The nodelist is updated weekly, to avoid unwanted calls to nodes that had shut down, with their phone numbers possibly having been reassigned for voice use by the respective telephone company. To accomplish regular updates, coordinators of each network maintain the list of systems in their local areas. The lists are forwarded back to the International Coordinator via automated systems on a regular basis. The International Coordinator would then compile a new nodelist, and generate the [[diff|list of changes]] (nodediff) to be distributed for node operators to apply to their existing nodelist. ===Routing of FidoNet mail=== In a theoretical situation, a node would normally forward messages to a ''hub''. The hub, acting as a distribution point for mail, might then send the message to the Net Coordinator. From there it may be sent through a Regional Coordinator, or to some other system specifically set up for the function. Mail to other zones might be sent through a Zone Gate. For example, a FidoNet message might follow the path: *1:170/918 ''(node)'' to 1:170/900 ''(hub)'' to 1:170/0 ''(net coordinator)'' to 1:19/0 ''(region coordinator)'' to 1:1/0 ''(zone coordinator)''. From there, it was distributed 'down stream' to the destination node(s). Originally there was no specific relationship between network numbers and the regions they reside in. In some areas of FidoNet, most notably in Zone 2, the relationship between region number and network number are entwined. For example, 2:201/329 is in Net 201 which is in Region 20 while 2:2410/330 is in Net 2410 which is in Region 24. Zone 2 also relates the node number to the hub number if the network is large enough to contain any hubs. This effect may be seen in the nodelist by looking at the structure of Net 2410 where node 2:2410/330 is listed under Hub 300. This is not the case in other zones. In Zone 1, things are much different. Zone 1 was the starting point and when Zones and Regions were formed, the existing nets were divided up regionally with no set formula.
