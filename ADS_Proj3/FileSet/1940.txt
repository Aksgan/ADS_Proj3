the Power Mac G5, based on [[IBM]]'s [[PowerPC 970|G5 processor]]. Apple claims this was the first 64-bit computer sold to the general public, but in fact that title actually goes to the [[AMD]] [[Opteron]] line (Opteron processors were however marketed more directly to the enterprise for use in rackmount servers and in workstations). Both 64-bit CPUs were pre-dated by the 64-bit [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] architecture, although the Alpha was aimed more at servers and workstations and not at the "general public." The Power Mac G5 was also used by Virginia Tech to build its prototype [[System X (computing)|System X]] supercomputing cluster, which at the time garnered the prestigious recognition of the third fastest supercomputer in the world. It cost only US$5.2 million to build, far less than the previous #3 and other ranking supercomputers. Apple's Xserves were soon updated to use the G5 as well. They replaced the Power Mac G5 machines as the main building block of [[Virginia Tech]]'s [[System X (computing)|System X]], which was ranked in November 2004 as the world's seventh fastest [[supercomputer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.top500.org/lists/plists.php?Y=2004&M=11 |title= TOP500 List for November 2004|publisher= top500.org|accessdate= 2006-05-04}}</ref> A new iMac based on the G5 processor was unveiled August 31, 2004 and was made available in mid-September. This model dispensed with the base altogether, placing the CPU and the rest of the computing hardware behind the flat-panel screen, which is suspended from a streamlined aluminium foot. This new iMac, dubbed the [[iMac G5]], is the world's thinnest desktop computer, measuring in at around two inches (around 5 centimeters). 2004, however, was a turning point for Apple. After creating a sizable financial base to work with, the company began experimenting with new parts from new suppliers. As a result Apple was able to produce new designs so quickly over a short amount of time, with the release of the iPod Video, then the iPod Classic, and eventually the iPod touch and iPhone. Each Apple product thus far has been under equally high demand. Through the 1990s, personal computers based on Microsoft's Windows operating system began to gain a much larger percentage of new computer users than Apple. As a result, Apple fell from controlling 20% of the total personal computer market to 5% by the end of the decade. The company was struggling financially under then-CEO [[Gil Amelio]] when on August 6, 1997 Microsoft bought a US$150 million non-voting share of the company as a result of a court settlement with Apple. Perhaps more significantly, Microsoft simultaneously announced its continued support for Mac versions of its office suite, Microsoft Office, and soon created a [[Macintosh Business Unit]]. This reversed the earlier trend within Microsoft that resulted in poor Mac versions of their software and has resulted in several award-winning releases. However, Apple's market share continued to decline, reaching 3% by 2004.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Initially, the [[Apple Store]]s were only opened in the United States, but in late 2003, Apple opened its first Apple Store abroad, in [[Tokyo]]'s [[Ginza]] district. Ginza was followed by a store in [[Osaka, Osaka|Osaka]], Japan in August 2004. In 2005, Apple opened stores in [[Nagoya, Aichi|Nagoya]], the [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] district of [[Tokyo]], [[Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka]], and [[Sendai, Miyagi|Sendai]]. Another store was opened in [[Sapporo, Hokkaidō|Sapporo]] in 2006. Apple's first European store opened in [[London]] in November 2004, and is currently the largest store. A store in the [[Bull Ring, Birmingham|Bullring]] shopping centre in [[Birmingham]] opened in April 2005, and the [[Bluewater Shopping Centre|Bluewater]] shopping centre in [[Kent]] opened in July 2005. Apple opened its first store in Canada in the middle of 2005 at the [[Yorkdale Shopping Centre]] in [[North York, Ontario|North York]], [[Toronto]]. Later on in 2005 Apple opened the [[Meadowhall]] Store in [[Sheffield]] and the [[Trafford Centre]] Store in [[Manchester]] (UK). Recent additions in the London area include the [[Brent Cross]] Apple Store (January 2006) and the Apple Store in [[Westfield London|Westfield]] in Shepherd's Bush (September 2008). Also, in an effort to court a broader market, Apple opened several "mini" stores in October 2004 in attempt to capture markets where demand does not necessarily dictate a full scale store. The first of these stores was opened at Stanford Shopping Center in [[Palo Alto, California]]. These stores follow in the footsteps of the successful Apple products: iPod mini and Mac mini. These stores are only one half the square footage of the smallest "normal" store and thus can be placed in several smaller markets. On April 29, 2005, Apple released [[Mac OS X v10.4]] "Tiger" to the general public. Apple's wildly successful PowerBook and iBook products relied on Apple's previous generation G4 architecture which were produced by [[Freescale Semiconductor]], a spin off from Motorola. Engineers at IBM had minimal success in making their PowerPC G5 processor consume less power and run cooler but not enough to run in iBook or PowerBook formats. As of the week of October 24, 2005. Apple released the Power Mac G5 Dual that features a Dual-Core processor. This processor contains two cores in one rather than have two separate processors. Apple has also developed the Power Mac G5 Quad that uses two of the Dual-Core processors for enhanced workstation power and performance. The new Power Mac G5 Dual cores run individually at 2.0 GHz or 2.3 GHz. The Power Mac G5 Quad cores run individually at 2.5 GHz and all variations have a graphics processor that has 256-bit memory bandwidth.<ref>{{cite web|last= Gibson|first= Brad|authorlink= |coauthors= |date= September 1, 2004|url= http://www.macobserver.com/article/2004/09/01.4.shtml|title= Apple Expo - Apple Exec: No G5 Laptop "Anytime Soon"|work= |pages= |publisher= macobserver.com|accessdate= May 4, 2006}}</ref> ===The Intel transition=== {{Main|Apple–Intel transition}} {{Out of date|date=January 2009}} In a keynote address on June 6, 2005, Steve Jobs officially announced that Apple will begin producing Intel-based Macintosh computers beginning in 2006.<ref>{{cite press release|date= June 6, 2005|url= http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/jun/06intel.html|title= Apple to Use Intel Microprocessors Beginning in 2006|publisher= [[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate= 2006-05-04}}</ref> Jobs confirmed [[Mac rumors community|rumors]] that the company had secretly been producing versions of its current operating system [[Mac OS X]] for both PowerPC and Intel processors over the past 5 years,
