inconsistencies that are otherwise hard to see. === Project estimation === When estimating project times, it should be remembered that programming products (which can be sold to paying customers) and [[Operating system|programming system]]s are both three times as hard to write as [[application program|in-house program]]s.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0201835959 Mythical Man Month] Figure 1.1, Page 13</ref> It should be kept in mind how much of the work week will actually be spent on technical issues, as opposed to administrative or other non-technical tasks, such as meetings. === Communication === To avoid disaster, all the teams working on a project should remain in contact with each other in as many ways as possible — e-mail, phone, meetings, memos etc. Instead of assuming something, the implementer should instead ask the architects to clarify their intent on a feature he is implementing, before proceeding with an assumption that might very well be completely incorrect. The architects are responsible for formulating a group picture of the project and communicating it to the others. === The surgical team === Much as a surgical team during surgery is led by one surgeon performing the most critical work himself while directing his team to assist with or overtake less critical parts, it seems reasonable to have a "good" programmer develop critical system components while the rest of a team provides what is needed at the right time. Additionally, Brooks muses that "good" programmers are generally five to ten times as productive as mediocre ones. See also [http://www.dfpug.de/loseblattsammlung/online/workshop/design_patterns/sonstiges.htm Organization and Team Patterns]. === Code freeze and system versioning === Software is invisible. Therefore, many things only become apparent once a certain amount of work has been done on a new system, allowing a user to experience it. This experience will yield insights, which will change a user's needs or the perception of the user's needs. The system should, therefore, be changed to fulfill the changed requirements of the user. This can only occur up to a certain point, otherwise the system may never be completed. At a certain date, no more changes should be allowed to the system and the code should be frozen. All requests for changes should be delayed until the ''next'' version of the system. === Specialized tools === Instead of every programmer having his own special set of tools, each team should have a designated tool-maker who may create tools that are highly customized for the job that team is doing, ''e.g.'', a code generator tool that creates code based on a specification. In addition, system-wide tools should be built by a common tools team, overseen by the project manager. === Lowering software development costs === There are two techniques for lowering software development costs that Brooks writes about: * Implementers may be hired only after the architecture of the system has been completed (a step that may take several months, during which time prematurely-hired implementers may have nothing to do). * Another technique Brooks mentions is not to develop software at all, but to simply buy it "off the shelf" when possible. == Bibliography == * {{cite book | title = The Mythical Man-Month | last = Brooks | first = Fred P. | authorlink = Fred Brooks | authormask = 1 | publisher = Addison-Wesley | year = 1975 | isbn = 0-201-00650-2 | ref = Brooks, Mythical Man-Month }} * {{cite book | work = The Mythical Man Month | edition = Anniversary Edition with four new chapters | chapter = Chap. 17 | title = 'No Silver Bullet' Refired | last = Brooks | first = Fred P. | authorlink = Fred Brooks | authormask = 1 | publisher = Addison-Wesley | year = 1995 | isbn = 0-201-83595-9 | ref = Brooks, Mythical Man-Month, Silver Bullet Refired }} == References == {{reflist}} == External links == {{wikiquote|Fred Brooks}} * [http://www.cs.unc.edu/~brooks/ Frederick P.

It was unique in that it provided libraries of clip-art and templates through a simple interface to build signs, posters and banners with household [[dot-matrix printer]]s. Over the years the software has been updated to accommodate changing file formats and printer technologies. The original version was for the [[Apple II family|Apple II]] and created signs, cards, banners, and letterheads. Designed by David Balsam and programmed by Martin Kahn, it became one of the most popular Apple II titles of all time. Versions for the [[IBM PC]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 8-bit computers]] followed, as did a variant for the [[Apple IIGS|Apple II<small>GS</small>]]. These versions were published in Europe by [[Ariolasoft]]. ==The Print Shop Companion== '''The Print Shop Companion''', developed by Roland Gustafsson and released in 1985, added a calendar feature, an updated graphic editor, font and border editors, and a "Creature Maker" game, as well as an expanded library of fonts, borders, and graphics. Initially, to use the new fonts and borders in The Print Shop, Companion had to modify the original program; subsequent releases of The Print Shop included built-in support for Companion. In 1986 the first [[Apple
