is 6 orders of magnitude smaller and does not contribute to soft errors (Baumann ''et al.'', 1995)<ref>R. Baumann, T. Hossain, S. Murata, H. Kitagawa, Boron compounds as a dominant source of alpha particles in semiconductor devices, IRPS Proceedings, pp. 297-302, 1995.</ref> Boron has been used in [[Borophosphosilicate glass|BPSG]], the insulator in the interconnection layers of integrated circuits, particularly in the lowest one. The inclusion of boron lowers the melt temperature of the glass providing better reflow and planarization characteristics. In this application the glass is formulated with a boron content of 4% to 5% by weight. Naturally occurring boron is 20% B-10 with the remainder the B-11 isotope. Soft errors are caused by the high level of B-10 in this critical lower layer of some older integrated circuit processes. Boron-11, used at low concentrations as a p-type dopant, does not contribute to soft errors. Integrated circuit manufacturers eliminated borated dielectrics by the 150 nm process node, largely due to this problem. In critical designs, depleted boron—consisting almost entirely of Boron-11 is used, to avoid this effect and therefore to reduce the soft error rate. Boron-11 is a by-product of the [[nuclear power|nuclear industry]]. For applications in medical electronic devices this soft error mechanism may be extremely important. Neutrons are produced during high energy cancer radiation therapy using photon beam energies above 10 MV. These neutrons are moderated as they are scattered from the equipment and walls in the treatment room resulting in a thermal neutron flux that is about 40x10<sup>6</sup> higher than the normal environmental neutron flux. This high thermal neutron flux will generally result in a very high rate of soft errors and consequent circuit upset (Wilkinson ''et al.'', 2005)<ref>J. Wilkinson, C. Bounds, T. Brown, B.J. Gerbi, J. Peltier, Cancer radiotherapy equipment as a cause of soft errors in electronic equipment, IEEE Trans Device and Materials Reliability, Vol. 5, No. 3, pp. 449-51, Apr. 2005</ref>, (Franco ''et al.'', 2005)<ref>Franco, L., Gómez, F., Iglesias, A., Pardo, J., Pazos, A., Pena, J., Zapata, M., SEUs on commercial SRAM induced by low energy neutrons produced at a clinical linac facility, RADECS Proceedings, Sept. 2005</ref>. ===Other causes=== Soft errors can also be caused by [[random noise]] or [[signal integrity]] problems, such as inductive or capacitive [[crosstalk]]. However, in general, these sources represent a small contribution to the overall soft error rate when compared to radiation effects. ==Designing around soft errors== === Soft error mitigation=== A designer can attempt to minimize the rate of soft errors by judicious device design, choosing the right semiconductor, package and substrate materials, and the right device geometry. Often, however, this is limited by the need to reduce device size and voltage, to increase operating speed and to reduce power dissipation. The susceptibility of devices to upsets is described in the industry using the [[JEDEC]] [[JESD-89]] standard. One technique that can be used to reduce the soft error rate in digital circuits is called [[radiation hardening]]. This involves increasing the capacitance at selected circuit nodes in order to increase its effective Q<sub>crit</sub> value. This reduces the range of particle energies to which the logic value of the node can be upset. Radiation hardening is often accomplished by increasing the size of transistors who share a drain/source region at the node. Since the area and power overhead of radiation hardening can be restrictive to design, the technique is often applied selectively to nodes which are predicted to have the highest probability of resulting in soft errors if struck. Tools and models that can predict which nodes are most vulnerable are the subject of past and current research in the area of soft errors. ===Correcting soft errors=== {{main|ECC memory}} Designers can choose to accept that soft errors will occur, and design systems with appropriate error detection and correction to recover gracefully. Typically, a semiconductor memory design might use [[forward error correction]], incorporating redundant data into each [[word]] to create an [[error correcting code]]. Alternatively, [[roll-back error correction]] can be used, detecting the soft error with an [[error-detecting code]] such as [[error detection and correction#Parity schemes|parity]], and rewriting correct data from another source. This technique is often used for [[write-through]] [[cache]] memories. Soft errors in [[logic circuits]] are sometimes detected and corrected using the techniques of [[fault tolerant]] design. These often include the use of redundant circuitry or computation of data, and typically come at the cost of circuit area, decreased performance, and/or higher power consumption. The concept of [[triple modular redundancy]] (TMR) can be employed to ensure very high soft-error reliability in logic circuits. In this technique, three identical copies of a circuit compute on the same data in parallel and outputs are fed into [[majority voting logic]], returning the value that occurred in at least two of three cases. In this way, the failure of one circuit due to soft error is discarded assuming the other two circuits operated correctly. In practice, however, few designers can afford the greater than 200% circuit area and power overhead required, so it is usually only selectively applied. Another common concept to correct soft errors in logic circuits is temporal (or time) redundancy, in which one circuit operates on the same data multiple times and compares subsequent evaluations for consistency. This approach, however, often incurs performance overhead, area overhead (if copies of latches are used to store data), and power overhead, though is considerably more area-efficient than modular redundancy. Traditionally, [[Dynamic random access memory|DRAM]] has had the most attention in the quest to reduce, or work-around soft errors, due to the fact that DRAM has comprised the majority-share of susceptible device surface area in desktop, and server computer systems (ref. the prevalence of ECC RAM in server computers). Hard figures for DRAM susceptibility are hard to come by, and vary considerably across designs, fabrication processes, and manufacturers. 1980s technology 256 kilobit DRAMS could have clusters of five or six bits flip from a single [[alpha particle]]. Modern DRAMs have much smaller feature sizes, so the deposition of a similar amount of charge could easily
