W. Winnicott]] in 1960. Winnicott 'contrasts a basic True Self with a False Self, the latter a self-protective mechanism....The true self feeling involves a sense of all out personal aliveness...feeling ''real'' '.<ref>[[Salman Akhtar]], ''Good Feelings'' (London 2009) p. 128</ref> 'Winnicott conceives of a "false self" that an infant develops in despairing defence against the trauma of inadequate maternal care; the analytic task is to give the "true self", which can feel and is cowering behind the "false self", which cannot, the strength to emerge'.<ref>Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988) p. 135</ref> == Before Winnicott== There was much in psychoanalytic theory on which Winnicott could draw for his concept of the False Self. [[Helene Deutsch]] had described the "as if" personalities who have 'succeeded in substituting "pseudo contacts" of manifold kinds for a real feeling contact with other people: they behave "as if" they have feeling contacts with people'.<ref>Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 445</ref> Winnicott's own analyst, [[Joan Riviere]], had memorably explored the concept of the masquerade - of 'the mask of the narcissist..."the trait of ''deceptiveness'', the mask, which conceals this subtle reservation of all control under intellectual rationalizations, or under feigned compliance and superficial politeness"'.<ref>Mary Jacobus, ''The Poetics of Psychoanalysis: In the Wake of Klein'' (Oxford 2005) p. 37</ref> [[Freud]] himself, with his late theory of 'the ego as constituted in its nucleus by a series of alienating identifications',<ref>Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 128</ref> had produced a theory of 'the Ego, which does bear some comparison with the False Self'.<ref>Adam Phillips, ''Winnicott'' (Harvard 1988) p. 136</ref> ==Winnicott== Despite its many antecedents, it would be wrong to underestimate the quiet conceptual revolution offered by Winnicott's 1960 article, which offered a fresh and compelling, clinically-rooted picture of the human mind. For Winnicott, in the False Self, 'Other people's expectations can become of overriding importance, overlaying or contradicting the original sense of self, the one connected to the very roots of one's being'.<ref>Winnicott, quoted in Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others'' (London 1994) p. 241</ref> The danger is that 'through this False Self, the infant builds up a false set of relationships, and by means of introjections even attains a show of being real'.<ref>Winnicott, quoted in Klein, p. 365</ref> The result can be a 'child whose potential aliveness and creativity has gone unnoticed...concealing an empty, barren internal world behind a mask of independence'.<ref>Rosalind Minsky, ''Psychoanalysis and Gender'' (London 1996) p. 119-20</ref> Yet at the same time the 'Winnicottian False Self is the ultimate defence against the unthinkable "exploitation of the True Self, which would result in its annihilation"'.<ref>Mary Jacobus, ''The Poetics of Psychoanalysis'' (Oxford 2005) p. 160</ref> By contrast, the True Self is rooted in, and '"does no more than collect together the details of the experience of aliveness" - this means the body's life-sustaining functions, "including the heart's action and breathing"'.<ref>Winnicott, in Jacobus, p. 160</ref> Out of this the baby creates the experience of [[reality]]: a sense that '"Life is worth the trouble of living". In the baby's nonverbal gesture which '... expresses a spontaneous [[instinct]]',<ref>D. W. Winnicott, "Ego Distortion in Terms of True and False Self ', in ''The Maturational Process and the Facilitating Environment'' (London 1965) p. 121</ref> the true self potential can be communicated to, and affirmed by, the motherer. 'The False Self in its pathological guise prevents and inhibits what Winnicott calls the "spontaneous gesture" of the True Self. Compliance and imitation are the costly results'.<ref>Jacobus, p. 160</ref> Some would indeed consider that 'the idea of ''compliance'' is central to Winnicott's theory of the false self',<ref>Minsky, p. 118</ref> and add, paradoxically, that 'concern for an object is easily a compliant act'.<ref>Adam Phillips, ''On Kissing, Tickling and Being Bored'' (London 1994) p. 30</ref> Where the motherer is not responsive to the baby's spontaneity, where instead 'a mother's expectations are too insistent, they can eventually result in compliant behaviour and an impaired autonomy',<ref>Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1990) p. 160</ref> as the baby has 'to manage a prematurely important object....The False Self enacts a kind of dissociated regard or recognition of the object; the object is taken seriously, is shown concern, but not by a person'.<ref>Phillips, p. 31</ref> It has been suggested that 'in pathology, Winnicott's distinction between "true and false selves" corresponds to [[Michael Balint|Balint]]'s "basic fault" and to [[Ronald Fairbairn|Fairbairn]]'s "compromised ego"'.<ref>J. H. Padel, "Freudianism: Later Developmemts", in Richard Gregory ed., ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind'' (Oxford 1987) p. 273</ref> ==Further Developments== The last half-century have seen Winnicott's ideas extended and applied in a variety of contexts, both in psychoanalysis and beyond. ===Kohut=== It has been suggested that '[[Heinz Kohut|Kohut]] offers essentially the same program' as Winnicott in his descriptions of 'the narcissistic disorders in which he specializes....Like Winnicott's "false-self" patients, these patients develop a shoddy armor (of a "defensive" or "compensatory" character) around their maimed inner core'.<ref>Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988) p. 136</ref> Kohut himself 'has noted that his work "overlaps" with Winnicott's investigations', and others have 'regarded Kohut's contribution to psychoanalysis to be an extension of Winnicott's work'.<ref>Eugene M. DeRobertis, ''Humanizing Child Development Theories'' (2008) p. 38</ref> Thus Kohut emphasises that 'to be...the maintenance of even the diseased remnants of the self is preferable to not being, that is, to accept the takeover of another's personality rather than his actively elicited responsiveness'.<ref>Heinz Kohut, ''How Does Analysis Cure?'' (London 1984) p. 142</ref> Similarly, he stressed that 'there is a decisive difference between the support of selfobjects that are sought after and chosen by a self in harmony with its innermost ideals...and the abandoning of oneself to a foreign self, through which one gains borrowed cohesion at the price of genuine
