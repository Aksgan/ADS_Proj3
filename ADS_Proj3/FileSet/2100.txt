with and supporting the organization's mission * Operations - effective and efficient use of resources * Financial Reporting - reliability of operational and financial reporting * Compliance - compliance with applicable laws and regulations According to [[Risk It]] framework by [[ISACA]],<ref name=riskit>The Risk IT Framework by ISACA, ISBN 978-1-60420-111-6</ref> IT risk is transversal to all four categories. The IT risk should be managed in the framework of Enterprise risk management: [[Risk appetite]] and Risk sensitivity of the whole enterprise should guide the IT risk management process. ERM should provide the context and business objectives to IT risk management == Risk management methodology == [[File:The Risk Management Process.png|thumb|ENISA: The Risk Management Process, according to ISO Standard 13335]] The term [[methodology]] means an organized set of principles and rules that drive action in a particular field of knowledge.<ref name=Vacca1/> A methodology does not describe specific methods; nevertheless it does specify several processes that need to be followed. These processes constitute a generic framework. They may be broken down in sub-processes, they may be combined, or their sequence may change. However any risk management exercise must carry out these processes in one form or another, The following table compare the processes foreseen by three leading standards.<ref name=Vacca1/> [[ISACA]] [[Risk IT]] framework is more recent.

Effective risk management must be totally integrated into the [[Systems Development Life Cycle]].<ref name=SP80030/> Information [[Risk analysis (engineering)|risk analysis]] conducted on applications, computer installations, networks and systems under development should be undertaken using structured methodologies.<ref name=SOGP>[https://www.isfsecuritystandard.com Standard of Good Practice by Information Security Forum (ISF) Section SM3.4 Information risk analysis methodologies]</ref> == Context establishment == This step is the first step in [[ISO]] [[ISO/IEC 27005]] framework. Most of the elementary activities are foreseen as the first sub process of Risk assessment according to [[NIST]] SP 800-30. This step implies the acquisition of all relevant information about the organization and the determination of the basic criteria, purpose, scope and boundaries of risk management activities and the organization in charge of risk management activities. The purpose is usually the compliance with legal requirements and provide evidence of due diligence supporting an [[ISMS]] that can be certified. The scope can be a incident reporting plan, a [[business continuity plan]]. Another area of application can be the certification of a product. Criteria include the risk evaluation, risk acceptance and impact evaluation criteria. These are conditioned by:<ref name=ISO27005>ISO/IEC, "Information technology -- Security techniques-Information security risk management" ISO/IEC FIDIS 27005:2008</ref> * legal and regulatory requirements * the strategic value for the business of information processes * [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]] expectations * negative consequences for the reputation of the organization Establishing the scope and boundaries, the organization should be studied: its mission, its values, its structure; its strategy, its locations and cultural environment. The constraints (budgetary, cultural, political, technical) of the organization are to be collected and documented as guide for next steps. === Organization for security management === The set up of the organization in charge of risk management is foreseen as partially fulfilling the requirement to provide the resources needed to establish, implement, operate, monitor, review, maintain and improve an ISMS.<ref name=ISO27001>ISO/IEC 27001</ref> The main roles inside this organization are:<ref name=SP80030/> * Senior Management * [[Chief information officer]] (CIO) * System and Information owners * the business and functional managers * the [[ISSO (IT)|Information System Security Officer]] (ISSO) or [[Chief information security officer]] (CISO) * IT Security Practitioners * Security Awareness Trainers == Risk assessment == [[File:Octave like.jpg|thumb|ENISA: Risk assessment inside risk management]] Risk Management is a recurrent activity that deals with the analysis, planning, implementation, control and monitoring of implemented measurements and the enforced security policy. On the contrary, Risk Assessment is executed at discrete time points (e.g. once a year, on demand, etc.) and â€“ until the performance of the next assessment - provides a temporary view of assessed risks and while parameterizing the entire Risk Management process. This view of the relationship of Risk Management to Risk Assessment is depicted in figure as adopted from OCTAVE.<ref name=ENISAFULL/> Risk assessment is often conducted in more than one iteration,
