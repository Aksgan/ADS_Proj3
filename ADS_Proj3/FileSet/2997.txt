in California in 1848]]. This causes inflation, as the value of gold goes down. However, if the rate of [[gold mining]] cannot keep up with the growth of the economy, gold becomes relatively more valuable, and prices (denominated in gold) will drop, causing deflation. Deflation was the more typical situation for over a [[century]] when gold and paper money backed by gold were used as money in the 18th and 19th centuries. Modern day monetary systems are based on fiat money and are no longer tied to the value of gold. The control of the amount of money in the economy is known as monetary policy. Monetary policy is the process by which a [[government]], central bank, or [[monetary authority]] manages the [[money supply]] to achieve specific goals. Usually the goal of monetary policy is to accommodate [[economic growth]] in an environment of stable prices. For example, it is clearly stated in the [[Federal Reserve Act]] that the [[Board of Governors]] and the [[Federal Open Market Committee]] should seek “to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.”<ref>The Federal Reserve. [http://www.federalreserve.gov/pf/pdf/pf_2.pdf 'Monetary Policy and the Economy".] ([[PDF]]) ''Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System'', (2005-07-05). Retrieved 2007-05-15.</ref> A failed monetary policy can have significant detrimental effects on an economy and the society that depends on it. These include [[hyperinflation]], [[stagflation]], [[recession]], high [[unemployment]], shortages of imported goods, inability to export goods, and even total monetary collapse and the adoption of a much less efficient barter economy. This happened in Russia, for instance, after the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|fall of the Soviet Union]]. Governments and central banks have taken both regulatory and [[free market]] approaches to monetary policy. Some of the tools used to control the money supply include: * changing the [[interest rate]] at which the central bank loans money to (or borrows money from) the commercial banks * currency purchases or sales * increasing or lowering [[Government debt|government borrowing]] * increasing or lowering [[government spending]] * manipulation of [[exchange rate]]s * raising or lowering bank reserve requirements * regulation or prohibition of [[Private currency|private currencies]] * taxation or tax breaks on imports or exports of capital into a country In the US, the [[Federal Reserve]] is responsible for controlling the money supply, while in the [[Euro area]] the respective institution is the [[European Central Bank]]. Other central banks with significant impact on global finances are the [[Bank of Japan]], [[People's Bank of China]] and the [[Bank of England]]. For many years much of monetary policy was influenced by an [[Economics|economic theory]] known as monetarism. [[Monetarism]] is an economic theory which argues that management of the money supply should be the primary means of regulating economic activity. The stability of the demand for money prior to the 1980s was a key finding of [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Anna Schwartz]]<ref>{{cite book |author=Milton Friedman, Anna Jacobson Schwartz, |title=Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |location=Princeton, N.J |year=1971 |pages= |isbn=0-691-00354-8 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> supported by the work of [[David Laidler]],<ref>{{cite book |author=David Laidler, |title=Money and Macroeconomics: The Selected Essays of David Laidler (Economists of the Twentieth Century) |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |location= |year=1997 |pages= |isbn=1-85898-596-X |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> and many others. The nature of the demand for money changed during the 1980s owing to technical, institutional, and legal factors and the influence of monetarism has since decreased. == See also == {{wikiquote}} {{Wiktionary}} {{Commons}} * [[Coin of account]] * [[Currency market]] * [[Electronic money]] * [[Labor-time voucher]] * [[Leper colony money]] * [[Local Exchange Trading Systems]] * [[Money bag]] * [[Non-market economics]] * [[Numismatics]] — Collection and study of money * [[Orders of magnitude (currency)]] * [[Seignorage]] * [[Slang terms for money]] * [[World currency]] == References == {{reflist|2}} {{Economics}} [[Category:Money| ]] [[Category:Monetary economics]] [[Category:Economic anthropology]] [[af:Geld]] [[am:ገንዘብ]] [[ar:مال]] [[an:Diners]] [[ast:Dineru]] [[gn:Viru]] [[ay:Qullqi]] [[az:Pul]] [[bn:অর্থ (টাকা)]] [[zh-min-nan:Chîⁿ]] [[be:Грошы]] [[be-x-old:Грошы]] [[bs:Novac]] [[br:Arc'hant]] [[bg:Пари]] [[ca:Diner]] [[cv:Укçа]] [[ceb:Kwarta]] [[cs:Peníze]] [[cy:Arian (economeg)]] [[da:Penge]] [[de:Geld]] [[nv:Béeso]] [[et:Raha]] [[el:Χρήμα]] [[myv:Ярмакт]] [[es:Dinero]] [[eo:Mono]] [[eu:Diru]] [[fa:پول]] [[hif:Paisa]] [[fr:Monnaie]] [[gd:Ruith-airgid]] [[gl:Diñeiro]] [[gan:錢]] [[hak:Kîm-tshièn]] [[ko:돈]] [[hy:Փող]] [[hi:पैसा]] [[hr:Novac]] [[io:Pekunio]] [[id:Uang]] [[ia:Moneta]] [[is:Peningar]] [[it:Denaro]] [[he:כסף (אמצעי תשלום)]] [[jv:Dhuwit]] [[kn:ಹಣ]] [[krc:Ачха]] [[ka:ფული]] [[kk:Ақша]] [[rw:Ifaranga]] [[sw:Pesa]] [[ht:Lajan]] [[ku:Pere]] [[lo:ເງິນ]] [[la:Pecunia]] [[lv:Nauda]] [[lb:Geld]] [[lt:Pinigai]] [[hu:Pénz]] [[mk:Пари]] [[mg:Vola]] [[ml:പണം]] [[arz:فلوس]] [[ms:Wang]] [[mwl:Denheiro]] [[mdf:Ярмакт]] [[mn:Мөнгө]] [[my:ငွေကြေး]] [[nl:Geld]] [[nds-nl:Gèld]] [[ne:मुद्रा]] [[new:ध्यबा]] [[ja:貨幣]] [[no:Penger]] [[nn:Pengar]] [[oc:Moneda]] [[pnb:پیسے]] [[ps:پیسې]] [[tpi:Mani]] [[pl:Pieniądz]] [[pt:Dinheiro]] [[ro:Ban (monedă)]] [[ru:Деньги]] [[rue:Пінязї]] [[sah:Харчы]] [[sco:Siller]] [[sq:Paraja]] [[scn:Dinaru (munita antica)]] [[si:මුදල්]] [[simple:Money]] [[sk:Peniaze]] [[sl:Denar]] [[so:Lacagta]] [[sr:Новац]] [[sh:Novac]] [[fi:Raha]] [[sv:Pengar]] [[tl:Salapi]] [[ta:பணம்]] [[th:เงินตรา]] [[chr:ᎠᏕᎳ]] [[tr:Para]] [[uk:Гроші]] [[ur:زر]] [[vi:Tiền]] [[fiu-vro:Raha]] [[wa:Cwårs]] [[war:Kwarta]] [[wo:Koppar]] [[wuu:钞票]] [[yi:געלט]] [[zh-yue:錢]] [[diq:Pere]] [[bat-smg:Piningā]] [[zh:貨幣]]</text> </page> <page> <id>25008</id> <title>Moni Naor</title> <text>{{Infobox Scientist | name = Moni Naor | image = Replace_this_image_male.svg | image_width = 150px | caption = Moni Naor | birth_date = | birth_place = | death_date = | death_place = | residence = | citizenship = Israeli | nationality = | ethnicity = | field = [[Computer Science]], [[Cryptography]] | work_institution = [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] | alma_mater = Ph.D. [[University of California, Berkeley]] [[1989]] | doctoral_advisor = [[Manuel Blum]] | doctoral_students = Danny Harnik <br> Tzvika Hartman <br> Yehuda Lindell <br> Kobbi Nissim <br> Benny Pinkas <br> [[Omer Reingold]] <br> Alon Rosen <br> Udi Wieder <br> Avishai Wool | known_for = | author_abbreviation_bot = | author_abbreviation_zoo = | prizes = | religion = | footnotes = }} '''Moni Naor''' ({{lang-he|מוני נאור}}) is an [[Israelis|Israeli]] [[computer scientist]], currently a professor at the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]]. Naor received his Ph.D. in [[1989]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. His adviser was [[Manuel Blum]]. He works in various fields of [[computer science]], mainly the foundations of [[cryptography]]. He is especially notable for creating [[Malleability (cryptography)|non-malleable cryptography]], [[Visual cryptography]] (with [[Adi Shamir]]), and suggesting various methods for verifying that users of a computer system are human (leading to the notion of [[CAPTCHA]]). His brother [[Seffi Naor]] is also a computer scientist. He was named an [[International Association for Cryptologic Research|IACR]] fellow in 2008. == Sources == * [http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~naor/ Moni Naor's website at the Weizmann Institute] * [http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~naor/PAPERS/human.pdf Verification of a
