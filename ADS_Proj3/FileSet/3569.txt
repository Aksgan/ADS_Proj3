It is a quantum field theory of a set of non-interacting particles, the '''primons'''; it is called a [[gas]] or a ''free model'' because the particles are non-interacting. The idea of the primon gas is attributed to [[Bernard Julia]] <ref>Bernard L. Julia, Statistical theory of numbers, in Number Theory and Physics, eds. J. M. Luck, P. Moussa, and M. Waldschmidt, Springer Proceedings in ''Physics'', Vol. '''47''', Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1990, pp. 276-293. </ref> ==The model== Consider a simple [[quantum Hamiltonian]] ''H'' having [[eigenstate]]s <math>|p\rangle</math> labelled by the [[prime number]]s ''p'', and having energies proportional to log ''p''. That is, :<math>H|p\rangle = E_p |p\rangle</math> with :<math>E_p=E_0 \log p \, </math> The [[second quantization|second-quantized]] version of this Hamiltonian converts states into particles, the '''primons'''. A multi-particle state is given by the numbers <math>k_p</math> of primons in the single-particle states <math>p</math>: :<math>|n\rangle = |k_2, k_3, k_5, k_7, k_{11} \ldots, k_p \ldots\rangle</math> This corresponds to the factorization of <math>n</math> into primes: :<math>n = 2^{k_2} \cdot 3^{k_3} \cdot 5^{k_5} \cdot 7^{k_7} \cdot 11^{k_{11}} \ldots p^{k_p} \ldots</math> The labelling by the integer ''n'' is unique, since every number has a unique factorization into primes. The energy of such a multi-particle state is clearly :<math>E(n) = \sum_p k_p E_p = E_0 \cdot \sum_p k_p \log p = E_0 \log n</math> The statistical mechanics [[partition function (mathematics)|partition function]] ''Z'' is given by the [[Riemann zeta function]]: :<math>Z(T) := \sum_{n=1}^\infty \exp \left(\frac{-E(n)}{k_B T}\right) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \exp \left(\frac{-E_0 \log n}{k_B T}\right) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s} = \zeta (s) </math> with ''s'' = ''E''<sub>0</sub>/''k''<sub>B</sub>''T'' where ''k''<sub>B</sub> is [[Boltzmann's constant]] and ''T'' is the absolute [[temperature]]. The divergence of the zeta function at ''s'' = 1 corresponds to the divergence of the partition function at a [[Hagedorn temperature]] of ''T''<sub>H</sub> = ''E''<sub>0</sub>/''k''<sub>B</sub>. ==The supersymmetric model== The above second-quantized model takes the particles to be [[boson]]s. If the particles are taken to be [[fermion]]s, then the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] prohibits multi-particle states which include squares of primes. By the [[spin-statistics theorem]], field states with an even number of particles are bosons, while those with an odd number of particles are fermions. The fermion operator [[(-1)^F|(&minus;1)<sup>F</sup>]] has a very concrete realization in this model as the [[Möbius function]] <math>\mu(n)</math>, in that the Mobius function is positive for bosons, negative for fermions, and zero on exclusion-principle-prohibited states. ==More complex models== The connections between number theory and quantum field theory can be somewhat further extended into connections between [[topological field theory]] and [[K-theory]], where, corresponding to the example above, the [[spectrum of a ring]] takes the role of the spectrum of energy eigenvalues, the [[prime ideal]]s take the role of the prime numbers, the [[group representation]]s take the role of integers, [[group character]]s taking the place the [[Dirichlet character]]s, and so on. ==References== <references/> * [[John Baez]], [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week199.html This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics, Week 199] [[Category:Number theory]] [[Category:Quantum field theory]] [[de:Primonengas]]</text> </page> <page> <id>29935</id> <title>Primou</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=February 2009}} '''PRIMOU''' is an enhancement of the '''PRIMO''' software program developed at the Genome Center at [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas]] to choose [[primer (molecular biology)|primers]] and to calculate their annealing temperature according to the base stacking method.

[[Category:Type theory]] {{type-theory-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>29950</id> <title>Principle of compositionality</title> <text>In [[mathematics]], [[semantics]], and [[philosophy of language]], the '''Principle of Compositionality''' is the principle that the meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its constituent expressions and the rules used to combine them. This principle is also called '''Frege's Principle''', because [[Gottlob Frege]] is widely credited for the first modern formulation of it. However, the idea appears already among [[India]]n philosophers of grammar such as [[Yaska|Yāska]], and also in [[Plato]]'s work such as in ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]''. The principle of compositionality states that in a meaningful sentence, if the [[lexical]] parts are taken out of the sentence, what remains will be the rules of composition. Take, for example, the sentence "Socrates was a man". Once the meaningful lexical items are taken away - "Socrates" and "man" - what is left is the pseudo-sentence, "S was a M". The task becomes a matter of describing what the connection is between S and M. It is frequently taken to mean that every operation of the syntax should be associated with an operation of the semantics that acts on the meanings of the constituents combined by the syntactic operation. As a guideline for constructing semantic theories, this is generally taken, as in the influential work on the philosophy of language by [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], to mean that every construct of the [[syntax]] should be associated by a clause of the [[T-schema]] with an operator in the [[semantics]] that specifies how the meaning of the whole expression is built from constituents combined by the syntactic rule. In some general mathematical theories (especially those in the tradition of [[Montague grammar]]) this guideline is taken to mean that the interpretation of a language is essentially given by a [[homomorphism]] between an algebra of syntactic representations and an
