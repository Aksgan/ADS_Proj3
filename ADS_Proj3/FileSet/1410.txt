to account for [[risk aversion]], where the [[risk premium]] is higher for low-probability events than the difference between the payout level of a particular outcome and its [[expected value]]. Bernoulli's paper was the first formalization of [[marginal utility]], which has broad application in economics in addition to expected utility theory. He used this concept to formalize the idea that the same amount of additional money was less useful to an already-wealthy person than it would be to a poor person. == Infinite expected value &mdash; St. Petersburg paradox== {{Main|St. Petersburg paradox}} The [[St. Petersburg paradox]] (named after the journal in which Bernoulli's paper was published) arises when there is no upper bound on the potential rewards from very low probability events. Because some probability distribution functions have an infinite [[expected value]], an expected-wealth maximizing person would pay an infinite amount to take this gamble. In real life, people do not do this. Bernoulli proposed a solution to this paradox in his paper: the utility function used in real life means that the expected utility of the gamble is finite, even if its expected value is infinite. (Thus he hypothesized diminishing [[marginal utility]] of increasingly larger amounts of money.) It has also been resolved differently by other economists by proposing that very low probability events are neglected, by taking into account the finite resources of the participants, or by noting that one simply cannot buy that which is not sold (and that sellers would not produce a lottery whose expected loss to them were unacceptable). ==von Neumann–Morgenstern formulation== {{Main|Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem}} ===The von Neumann-Morgenstern axioms=== There are four axioms<ref>Neumann, John von, and Morgenstern, Oskar, ''Theory of Games and Economic Behavior'', Princeton, NJ, Princeton University Press, 1944, second ed. 1947, third ed. 1953.</ref> of the expected utility theory that define a ''rational'' decision maker. They are completeness, transitivity, independence and continuity. Completeness assumes that an individual has well defined preferences and can decide between two alternatives. Axiom (Completeness): For every A and B either <math>A <B</math> , <math>A > B</math> or <math>A = B</math> (this means: A is worse than B, better, or equally good) holds. Transitivity assumes that, as an individual decides according to the completeness axiom, the individual also decides consistently. Axiom (Transitivity): For every A, B and C with <math>A \geq B</math> and <math> B \geq C</math> we must have <math> A \geq C</math>. Independence also pertains to well-defined preferences and assumes that two gambles mixed with a third one maintain the same preference order as when the two are presented independently of the third one. The independence axiom is the most controversial one. Axiom (Independence): Let A, B, and C be three lotteries with <math>A \geq B</math>, and let <math>t \in (0, 1]</math>; then <math>tA+(1-t)C \geq t B+(1-t)C</math> . Continuity assumes that when there are three lotteries (A, B and C) and the individual prefers A to B and B to C, then there should be a possible combination of A and C in which the individual is then indifferent between this mix and the lottery B. Axiom (Continuity): Let A, B and C be lotteries with <math>A>B>C</math>; then there exists a probability p such that B is equally good as <math>pA+(1-p)C</math>. If all these axioms are satisfied, then the individual is said to be rational and the preferences can be represented by a utility function. In other words: if an individual always chooses his/her most preferred alternative available, then the individual will choose one gamble over another if and only if there is a utility function such that the expected utility of one exceeds that of the other. The expected utility of any gamble may be expressed as a linear combination of the utilities of the outcomes,with the weights being the respective probabilities. Utility functions are also normally continuous functions. Such utility functions are also referred to as von Neumann–Morgenstern (vNM) utility functions. This is a central theme of the expected utility hypothesis in which an individual chooses not the highest expected value, but rather the highest expected utility. The expected utility maximizing individual makes decisions rationally based on the axioms of the theory. The von Neumann–Morgenstern formulation is important in the application of [[set theory]] to economics because it was developed shortly after the Hicks-Allen "[[Ordinal utility|ordinal]] revolution" of the 1930s, and it revived the idea of [[cardinal utility]] in economic theory.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Note, however, that while in this context the ''utility function'' is cardinal, in that implied behavior would be altered by a non-linear monotonic transformation of utility, the ''expected utilty function'' is ordinal because any monotonic increasing transformation of it gives the same behavior. ===Risk aversion=== The expected utility theory implies that rational individuals act as though they were maximizing expected utility, and allows for the fact that many individuals are [[risk averse]],{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} meaning that the individual would refuse a fair gamble (a fair gamble has an expected value of zero). Risk aversion implies that their utility functions are concave and show diminishing marginal wealth utility. The [[risk attitude]] is directly related to the curvature of the utility function: risk neutral individuals have linear utility functions, while risk seeking individuals have convex utility functions and risk averse individuals have concave utility functions. The degree of risk aversion can be measured by the curvature of the utility function. Since the risk attitudes are unchanged under [[affine transformation]]s of ''u'', the first derivative ''u''' <!-- u' = u prime, this is not a typo--> is not an adequate measure of the risk aversion of a utility function. Instead, it needs to be normalized.
