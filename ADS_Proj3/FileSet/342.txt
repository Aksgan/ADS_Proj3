during what is called "stand-in" time, where the bank's cash dispensing network is unable to access databases that contain account information (possibly for database maintenance). In order to give customers access to cash, customers may be allowed to withdraw cash up to a certain amount that may be less than their usual daily withdrawal limit, but may still exceed the amount of available money in their account, which could result in fraud.<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/4.html Kennison v Daire [1986&#93; HCA 4; (1986) 160 CLR 129 (20 February 1986) ] [[AustLII|Australasian Legal Information Institute]]</ref> ===Card fraud=== [[Image:ATM lineup on ground.jpg|thumb|right|ATM lineup]] [[Image:ATM Masalli.jpg|thumb|right|180 px|A big queue at an ATM in [[Masalli]], [[Azerbaijan]].]] In an attempt to prevent criminals from [[shoulder surfing (computer security)|shoulder surfing]] the customer's [[Personal identification number|PIN]]s, some banks draw privacy areas on the floor. For a low-tech form of fraud, the easiest is to simply steal a customer's card. A later variant of this approach is to trap the card inside of the ATM's card reader with a device often referred to as a [[Lebanese loop]]. When the customer gets frustrated by not getting the card back and walks away from the machine, the criminal is able to remove the card and withdraw cash from the customer's account. Another simple form of fraud involves attempting to get the customer's bank to issue a new card and stealing it from their mail.<ref>[http://venus.soci.niu.edu/~cudigest/phracks/phrack-08 Fun with Automatic Tellers] [[Phrack Magazine]] Volume One, Issue Eight</ref> [[Image:Tamper warning on ATM in London.jpg|thumb|left|Some ATMs may put up warning messages to customers to not use them when it detects possible [[Tampering (crime)|tampering]]]] The concept and various methods of copying the contents of an ATM card's magnetic stripe on to a duplicate card to access other people's financial information was well known in the hacking communities by late 1990.<ref>[http://www.skepticfiles.org/hacker/phrack32.htm "Automatic Teller Machine Cards"], [[Phrack Magazine]], Phrack Classic Volume Three, Issue 32</ref> In 1996 Andrew Stone, a computer security consultant from Hampshire in the UK, was convicted of stealing more than £1 million (at the time equivalent to US$1.6 million) by pointing high definition video cameras at ATMs from a considerable distance, and by recording the card numbers, expiry dates, etc. from the embossed detail on the ATM cards along with video footage of the PINs being entered. After getting all the information from the videotapes, he was able to produce clone cards which not only allowed him to withdraw the full daily limit for each account, but also allowed him to sidestep withdrawal limits by using multiple copied cards. In court, it was shown that he could withdraw as much as £10,000 per hour by using this method. Stone was sentenced to five years and six months in prison.<ref>[http://itnow.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/38/6/17 Seeking after the truth in computer evidence: any proof of ATM fraud?] [[Oxford Journals]] ITNOW</ref> By contrast, a newer high-tech method of operating sometimes called '''card skimming''' or '''card cloning''' involves the installation of a magnetic card reader over the real ATM's card slot and the use of a wireless surveillance camera or a modified digital camera to observe the user's PIN. Card data is then cloned onto a second card and the criminal attempts a standard cash withdrawal. The availability of low-cost commodity wireless cameras and card readers has made it a relatively simple form of fraud, with comparatively low risk to the fraudsters.<ref>[http://www.snopes.com/crime/warnings/atmcamera.asp Snopes.com] [[Snopes]]</ref> In an attempt to stop these practices, countermeasures against card cloning have been developed by the banking industry, in particular by the use of [[smart card]]s which cannot easily be copied or spoofed by unauthenticated devices, and by attempting to make the outside of their ATMs [[tamper-evident|tamper evident]]. Older chip-card security systems include the French [[Carte Bleue]], [[Visa Cash]], [[Mondex]], [[Blue from American Express]]<ref>[http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/56/wth.html What the Hell Do Smart Cards Do?] Fast Company</ref> and [[EMV 96|EMV '96 or EMV 3.11]]. The most actively developed form of smart card security in the industry today is known as [[EMV 2000|EMV 2000 or EMV 4.x]]. [[EMV]] is widely used in the UK ([[Chip and PIN]]) and other parts of Europe, but when it is not available in a specific area, ATMs must fallback to using the easy–to–copy magnetic stripe to perform transactions. This fallback behaviour can be exploited.<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/2006/05/19/stories/2006051920380300.htm Four more held in fake credit card racket case] [[The Hindu]]</ref> However the fallback option has been removed by several UK banks, meaning if the chip is not read, the transaction will be declined. In February 2009, a group of criminals used counterfeit ATM cards to steal $9 million from 130 ATMs in 49 cities around the world all within a time period of 30 minutes.<ref>[http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/02/atm/ Global ATM Caper Nets Hackers $9 Million in One Day], Wired.com, February 3, 2009</ref> Card cloning and [[Skimming (credit card fraud)|skimming]] can be detected by the implementation of magnetic card reader heads and firmware that can read a signature embedded in all magnetic stripes during the card production process. This signature known as a "MagnePrint" or "BluPrint" can be used in conjunction with common two factor authentication schemes utilized in ATM, debit/retail point-of-sale and prepaid card applications.<ref>[http://www.magneprint.com/ Magneprint.com]</ref><ref>[http://veritechsecurity.com/default.aspx Veritechsecurity.com]</ref> Another ATM fraud issue is ATM card theft which includes credit card trapping and debit card trapping at ATMs. Originating in South America this type of ATM fraud has spread globally. Although somewhat replaced in terms of volume by ATM skimming incidents, a re-emergence of card trapping has been noticed in regions such as Europe where EMV Chip and PIN cards have increased in circulation.<ref>[http://www.atmsecurity.com/articles/atm-fraud/atm-security-issues-atm-fraud-issues-by-geography.html ATMsecurity.com]</ref> ==Related devices== A [[Talking ATM]] is a type of ATM that provides audible instructions so that persons who cannot read an ATM screen can independently use the machine. All audible information is delivered privately through a standard [[headphone jack]] on the face of the machine. Alternatively, some banks such as the [[Nordea]] and [[Swedbank]] use a built-in external speaker which may be invoked by pressing the talk button on the keypad. Information is delivered to the customer either through pre-recorded [[sound]] files or via text-to-speech [[speech synthesis]].
