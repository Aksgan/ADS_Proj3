Dial boxes were common input tools in the first years of interactive 3D graphics and they were available for [[Silicon Graphics]] (SGI) or [[Sun Microsystems]] and sold with their [[workstation]]s. Currently they have been replaced by standard [[computer mouse]] interaction techniques. Standard dial box has 8 dials mounted on a plate. The plate is set upright with the help of a stand and usually located next to the computer screen for convenient access. The connection to a computer is made via the serial port ([[RS-232]]). One of the fields of application for dial boxes was [[molecular graphics]]. ==Dial box models== At least two different models of dial boxes were sold with the SGI brand. DLS80-1022 (SGI part number 9980992) was made by [[Danaher Corporation|Danaher controls]], has 8 large dials and a single [[D-subminiature|DE-9]] connector which contains both the power and data pins. The connection to the computer serial port the dial box power supply is made with a special DE-9 â€“ DE-9, [[DIN connector|DIN-5]] splitter cable. Essentially the same dial box was also sold as the [[Sun Microsystems]] DLS80-1012, part number 370-1223-01. The Japanese made SGI SN-921 (type number 9780804) has somewhat smaller dials. It has a separate 5 V power supply connector in addition to the DE-9 serial connector, but it also needs a serial cable with a custom [[pinout]] [http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Comp/comp.sys.sgi.hardware/2006-03/msg00053.html]. <gallery> File:Sgi dialbox sn-921 front.jpg|SGI dial box model SN-921, type no. 9780804 File:Sgi dialbox sn-921 back.jpg|SGI dial box model SN-921, type no. 9780804 File:SGI dialbox DLS80-1022 front.jpg|SGI dial box model DLS80-1022, part no. 9980992 File:SGI dialbox DLS80-1022 back.jpg|SGI dial box model DLS80-1022, part no. 9980992 </gallery> ==External links== * [http://sbgrid.org/downloads/Configure_Dials_for_OS_X.pdf Configuring SGI Dials for OSX] * [http://sourceforge.net/projects/dialbox/ Xorg input driver for SGI dial box] * [http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~emsley/coot/mbox-2004-2005/att-0547/eventio.py Python code for reading values from a dial box] * [http://www.meadow.net/pinouts.html#sgidbox SGI dial box cable pinout] [[Category:Computer peripherals]] [[Category:Molecular modelling]] {{Compu-hardware-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>10206</id> <title>Diamondback (comics)</title> <text>'''Diamondback''' is the name of four [[Character (arts)|fictional]] characters appearing in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. ==Publication history== {{Expand section|date=April 2010}} Diamondback (Rachel Leighton) first appeared in ''[[Captain America]]'' #310 (October 1985), written by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and illustrated by [[Paul Neary]]. ==Fictional character biography== ===Willis Stryker=== The first Diamondback was a foe of [[Luke Cage]].
