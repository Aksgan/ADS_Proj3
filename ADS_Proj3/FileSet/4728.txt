keyboard as the PC-240. They had a maximum of 4 megabytes of RAM and came with VGA screens as standard. They were generally supplied with MS-DOS, and Windows 3.0. The 350-16 had an interesting bug where, occasionally, the machine would just freeze entirely and not even boot up if turned off and on at the mains. Although it would power on, the BIOS just didn't start. The solution was to turn on the machine at the mains and hold down the power button for 30 seconds, at which point it would normally start. It was suggested that this was due to an under-valued capacitor in the power circuit. This problem appeared to be resolved in the 350-40, which had a different [[PSU]] In 1992 Wang marketed a PC-compatible based on the Intel [[80386SX]] processor, which they called the Alliance 750CD. It was clocked at 25 MHz and had a socket for an [[80387]] math coprocessor. It came with 2 megabytes of installed RAM, and was expandable to 16 megabytes using [[SIMM]] memory cards (a Wang invention <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ll.georgetown.edu/federal/judicial/fed/opinions/95opinions/95-1276.html | title = Wang v. Mitsubishi | accessdate = Mar 14, 2010}}</ref> that became an industry standard). It had a 1.44 megabyte floppy disk drive, an internal 80 megabyte hard disk, and a CD-ROM drive. Five expansion slots were built-in. It came with MS-DOS and Windows 3.1 operating systems. <!-- this para on Alliance 750CD is from personal experience; I'm looking at it right now! --> In 1994, in the UK, Wang released a slimline [[80486]] based PC. These were entirely standard IBM compatible PCs, with standard PC/AT keyboards. The only unusual feature was that the BIOS memory and clock were maintained by a block of 4x [[AA batteries]]. They were originally installed with a 33 MHz [[80486DX]], but could be upgraded to 66 MHz with a [[80486DX2]] and even 100 MHz by using a "PowerLeap" overclocked [[80486DX2]]. They shipped with MSDOS 5.0 and Windows 3.11 as standard. ===The Wang Laptop Computer=== {{Empty section|date=May 2008}} ===Wang Freestyle=== '''Wang Freestyle'''<ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CMN/is_n3_v27/ai_8245288 Wang Freestyle at The University of Southern California in 1990]</ref><ref>[http://www.ascilite.org.au/aset-archives/confs/olnt90/foks.html Open Learning and New Technology] - Proceedings of a conference conducted by the [[Australian Society for Educational Technology]] WA Chapter at Curtin University of Technology, Perth, Western Australia, on 29â€“30 June 1990.

The product was not a success in anything except marketing terms. The article at [[University of Southern California]] (USC) shows the symptoms of the failure: <blockquote>''The $1.2 million USC system includes a VS 7150 mid-range computer; 30 image workstations, 25 with Freestyle capabilities; a laser printer; five endorsers; and five document scanners. Initial storage for document images is eight gigabytes of magnetic disk storage.''</blockquote> Only 25 of the stations were Freestyle stations. The system was so costly, even in the context of a Wang Integrated Imaging System, that Freestyle was only affordable for highly specialized or very senior staff. Apart from USC, unusual in that it was deployed at clerical level, it was sold as a C-Level<ref>C-Level refers to "Chief level" officers in an organization</ref> tool for C grades to communicate with other C Grades. This reduced the marketplace immediately from the mass market where the system would have been effective.<ref>Assume 10 C-level officers per [[Fortune 1000]] organization.

Word processing was not actually the mainstay of Wang's business by the time desktop computers began to gain in popularity. Although Wang manufactured desktops, its main business by the 1980s was its VS line of mini-computer and "midframe" systems. The market for these mini-computers was ultimately conquered by enhanced micro-computers like the [[Apple Macintosh]] and the "[[Wintel]]" PC on one end and [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]], [[IBM]] and [[Hewlett-Packard]] servers on the other end. Wang would be only one of a large number of New England-based computer companies that would falter in the late 1980s and 1990s. Dr. Wang's insistence that his son, [[Fred Wang]], succeed him contributed to the company's failure. Fred Wang was a business school graduate, "but by almost any definition," wrote Charles C. Kenney, "unsuited for the job in which his father had placed him." His assignment, first as head of research and development, then as president of the company, led to resignations by key R&D and business personnel. One turning point occurred when Fred Wang was head of R&D. On October 4, 1983, Wang Laboratories announced fourteen major hardware and software products, and promised dates of delivery. The announcement was well received, but even at the time there were warning signs. According to [[Datamation]], Wang announced "[[wikt:everything but the kitchen sink|everything but the kitchen sink]]. And if you could attach the kitchen sink to a personal computer they would announce that too."<ref>Stein, Charles (1986): "A High-Tech David Faltered as Goliath," ''The Boston Globe,'' November 27, 1989, Business section, p. 1: "if you could attach the kitchen sink, they would announce that too ..."</ref> Very few of the products were close to completion and many of them had not even been started. All were delivered late and some were never delivered at all. In retrospect this was referred to as the "[[vaporware]] announcement" and it hurt the credibility of Fred Wang and Wang Laboratories. In 1986 Fred Wang, then 36 years old, was installed
