It was founded in 1954 and is dedicated to the advancement of the theory and practice of [[control theory|systems and control]] in engineering. ==History== The history of the ''IEEE Control Systems Society'' goes back to one of the merged societies forming the IEEE: the [[Institute of Radio Engineers]] (IRE) organised the first meeting of the '''IRE Professional Group on Automatic Control''' on October 19, 1954.<ref name=CSS_history>{{cite web|url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/IEEE_Control_Systems_Society_History |title=IEEE Global History Network - IEEE Control Systems Society History |publisher=IEEE |accessdate={{Start date|2010|12|28}}}}</ref> ==Selected publications== * IEEE Control Systems Magazine, Dennis Bernstein, editor-in-chief * IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, Christos Cassandras, editor-in-chief * [[IEEE Transactions on Control Systems and Technology]], Thomas Parisini, editor-in-chief * E-letter on Systems, Control, and Signal Processing, [[Magnus B.

IF-MAP provides a common interface between the Metadata Access Point (MAP), a database server acting as a clearinghouse for information about security events and objects, and other elements of the TNC architecture.[http://www.computer.org/portal/web/computingnow/archive/news065] The IF-MAP protocol defines a publish/subscribe/search mechanism with a set of identifiers and data types. ==History== The IF-MAP protocol was first published by the TCG on April 28, 2008. Originally, the IF-MAP specification was developed to support data sharing across various vendor’s devices and applications for network security.[http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/042808-interop-tcg.html] The standard has also been adopted for additional use cases of data-sharing including physical security.[http://www.securitymagazine.com/Articles/Online_Exclusives/BNP_GUID_9-5-2006_A_10000000000000886666] Version 2.0 of the IF-MAP spec was published on September 13, 2010. The 2.0 version separated the base protocol from the metadata definitions that standardize how different types of information are represented. The goal in separating the base protocol from the metadata definitions within the standard was to allow the standard to be adopted across other technologies, such [[cloud computing]],[http://opencloudconsortium.org/2010/02/22/if-map-based-intercloud-testbed] [[Industrial Control Systems]],[http://www.automation.com/content/securing-scada-and-control-networks] [[smart grid]], to leverage their existing data models within the MAP framework.[https://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/091310-trusted-computing-group-cloud-security.html] ==IF-MAP Community== IF-MAP.com is the meeting place for IF-MAP Community.

It enables Windows to make direct file system calls bypassing MS-DOS methods and use native [[32-bit file access]] for both local and network devices. IFSHLP first shipped with [[Windows 3.1x#Windows for Workgroups 3.11|Windows for Workgroups 3.11]] and was also used in [[Windows 9x]]. The purpose of the IFS Helper is to ensure that no 3rd-party drivers intercept [[MS-DOS API|INT 21H]] calls; to achieve this, the IFSHLP.SYS is insured to be the first in the driver chain that intercepts DOS file access. If no other real-mode drivers are installed, IFSHLP will report that to the IFS Manager (IFSMGR.VXD in Windows 9x) and 32-bit file access will be enabled. {{DEFAULTSORT:Ifshlp.Sys}} [[Category:Microsoft Windows]] {{Windows-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>17530</id> <title>IFSP</title> <text>'''IFSP''' ({{lang-de|Interface sternförmig parallel}}, {{lang-ru|Интерфейс радиальный параллельный (ИРПР)}}), radial parallel interface, was a [[Parallel port|parallel]] [[Interface (computer science)|interface]] similar to [[Centronics]] but incompatible, as it had different signal polarities and handshake protocol.
