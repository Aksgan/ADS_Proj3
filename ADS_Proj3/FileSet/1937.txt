focused on a computer that would change the world. While the Apple III was another iteration of the text-based computer, this new machine would feature a completely different interface and introduce the words ''[[Mouse (computing)|mouse]]'', ''[[Icon (computing)|icon]]'', and ''[[Desktop metaphor|desktop]]'' into the [[lexicon]] of the computing public. In return for the right to buy US$1,000,000 of pre-[[IPO]] stock, Xerox granted Apple Computer three days access to the PARC facilities. After visiting PARC, they came away with new ideas that would complete the foundation for Apple Computer's first [[GUI]] computer, the [[Apple Lisa]].<ref>[http://www.mac-history.net/the-history-of-the-apple-macintosh/rich-neighbour-with-open-doors-apple-and-xerox-parc Rich Neighbor with Open Doors – Apple and Xerox PARC]</ref><ref>[http://vectronicsappleworld.com/macintosh/creation.html Apple Lore: The creation of the Macintosh]</ref><ref>[http://library.stanford.edu/mac/parc.html The Xerox PARC Visit]</ref><ref>[http://www.fool.com/news/foth/2000/foth000918.htm How Xerox Forfeited the PC War]</ref> (Popular folklore states that "Lisa" was Steve Jobs' first daughter; Apple maintains it means Locally Integrated Software Architecture.){{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Apple Computer's engineers did not come up with the LISA interface overnight. In fact, the first iteration of the soon-ubiquitous [[WIMP (computing)|WIMP]] interface was a poorly-drawn picture of a floppy disk. It was only after months of usability testing and work that Apple settled on the LISA interface of windows and icons. The Lisa was introduced in 1983 at a cost of US$9,995. Because of the high price, it failed to penetrate the market, however it was a useful proof of concept. ===The release of the Macintosh and the 1984 commercial=== {{Main|Macintosh}} The [[Macintosh 128k]] was announced to the press in October 1983, followed by an 18-page brochure included with various magazines in December.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digibarn.com/collections/ads/apple-mac/index.htm|title=Apple Macintosh 18 Page Brochure|publisher=DigiBarn Computer Museum|accessdate=2006-04-24}}</ref> Its debut, however, was announced by a single national broadcast of the now famous US$1.5 million television commercial, "[[1984 (television commercial)|1984]]".

For a special post-election edition of ''[[Newsweek]]'' in November 1984, Apple spent more than US$2.5 million to buy all 39 of the advertising pages in the issue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guidebookgallery.org/ads/magazines/macos/macos10-newsweek|title=1984 ''Newsweek'' Macintosh ads|publisher=GUIdebook, [[Newsweek]]|accessdate=2006-04-24}}</ref> Apple also ran a “Test Drive a Macintosh” promotion, in which potential buyers with a credit card could take home a Macintosh for 24 hours and return it to a dealer afterwards. While 200,000 people participated, dealers disliked the promotion, the supply of computers was insufficient for demand, and many were returned in such a bad shape that they could no longer be sold. This marketing campaign caused CEO [[John Sculley]] to raise the price from US$1,995 to US$2,495 (adjusting for inflation, about US$5,000 in 2007).<ref name="Worst Business">{{cite web|url=http://www.osnews.com/story/16036/Apples-Worst-Business-Decisions/|title=Apple's Worst Business Decisions|author=Hormby, Thomas|publisher=OS News|accessdate=2007-12-24|date=2006-10-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl|title=Inflation Calculator|publisher=[[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]|accessdate=2007-12-18}}</ref> Two days after the 1984 ad aired, the Macintosh went on sale. It came bundled with two applications designed to show off its interface: [[MacWrite]] and [[MacPaint]]. Although the Mac garnered an immediate, enthusiastic following, it was too radical for some, who labeled it a mere "[[toy]]". Because the machine was entirely designed around the GUI, existing text-mode and [[command line interface|command-driven applications]] had to be redesigned and the programming code rewritten; this was a challenging undertaking that many [[software developer]]s shied away from, and resulted in an initial lack of software for the new system. In April 1984 [[Microsoft]]'s [[MultiPlan]] migrated over from [[MS-DOS]], followed by [[Microsoft Word]] in January 1985.<ref name = "hotwyu">{{cite web|url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/applehis/appl1984.htm|title=Chronology of Apple Computer Personal Computers|author=Polsson, Ken|accessdate=2007-11-18}}</ref> In 1985, [[Lotus Software]] introduced [[Lotus Jazz]] after the success of [[Lotus 1-2-3]] for the [[IBM PC]], although it was largely a flop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvorak.org/blog/?page_id=8241|title=Whatever Happened to Lotus Jazz?|author=Dvorak, John|accessdate=2007-01-21|date=2006-11-26|publisher=Dvorak Uncensored}}</ref> Apple introduced [[Macintosh Office]] the same year with the [[Lemmings (television commercial)|lemmings ad]], infamous for insulting potential customers.

This was due to its introduction of [[desktop publishing]] (and later [[computer animation]]) through Apple's partnership with [[Adobe Systems]] which introduced the [[laser printer]] and [[Adobe PageMaker]]. Indeed, the Macintosh would become known as the de-facto platform for many industries including cinema, music, advertising, publishing and the arts. While it did briefly license some of its own designs, Apple did not allow other computer makers to "clone" the Mac until the 1990s, long after [[Microsoft]] dominated the marketplace with its broad licensing program. By then, it was too late for Apple to reclaim its lost market share and the [[Macintosh clone]]s achieved limited success before being axed after Steve Jobs returned to [[Apple Computer]] in 1997.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} ====1985: Jobs leaves Apple==== After an internal power struggle the board of directors sided with Sculley and Jobs was asked to resign. Jobs then co-founded the [[visual effects]] house, [[Pixar]]. He also went on to found [[NeXT]] Inc., a computer company that built machines with futuristic designs and ran the UNIX-derived [[NEXTSTEP|NeXTstep]] operating system. NeXTSTEP would eventually be developed into Mac OS X. While not a commercial success due in part to its high price, the NeXT computer would introduce important concepts to the history of the personal
