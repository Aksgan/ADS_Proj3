[[In Which We Serve]] is a 1942 British patriotic war film directed by [[David Lean]] and [[Noël Coward]], and inspired by the sinking of [[HMS Kelly]], under Mountbatten's command. Coward was a personal friend of Mountbatten, and copied some of speeches into the film. Mountbatten is portrayed in the CBC miniseries "Dieppe", based on the book "Unauthorized Action" by historian Brian Loring-Villa, which explores his controversial role in planning and approving the famous Allied commando raid in August 1942. [[Patric Knowles]] played Mountbatten in a brief appearance in the 1968 war film [[The Devil's Brigade]]. Mountbatten was portrayed by Peter Harlowe in [[Richard Attenborough|Sir Richard Attenborough]]'s 1982 epic ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]''. In 1986, [[ITV]] produced and aired ''Lord Mountbatten: The Last Viceroy'', starring Nichol Williamson and Janet Suzman as Lord and Lady Mountbatten. Its focus was on the India years and hinted at Lady Mountbatten's relationship with Nehru. In the US it aired on [[Masterpiece Theatre]]. Lord Mountbatten (played by [[Christopher Owen]]) appears in the 2008 film ''[[The Bank Job]]'', telling the story of a [[Baker Street robbery|government-approved bank robbery]] in the 1970s. In a covert rendezvous at [[Paddington station]], Mountbatten is portrayed as the representative of the British government and gives the robbers documents guaranteeing immunity from prosecution, in exchange for naked photographs of Princess Margaret, potentially embarrassing to the Royal Family. Mountbatten quips "I haven't had this much excitement since the war".<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1720472,00.html | work=Time | date=7 March 2008 | accessdate=11 May 2010 | first=Richard | last=Schickel}}</ref> Lord Mountbatten was played by [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] in the 2008 television film ''[[In Love with Barbara]]'', a biopic of the romantic novelist [[Barbara Cartland]] which was shown on [[BBC Four]] in the UK. Mountbatten was due to feature in the recently cancelled film ''Indian Summer'' which was to cover his time as Viceroy of India, and potentially the affair between his wife and Nehru. It was to be loosely based on the book ''[[Indian Summer: The Secret history of the end of an empire]]'' by [[Alex von Tunzelmann]].<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article4213430.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Indian Summer story of the Mountbattens | first=Ed | last=Caesar | date=29 June 2008 | accessdate=11 May 2010}}</ref> ===Other significant legacies=== [[The Mountbatten School]] was opened in his name in 1969 on land that originally formed part of the Broadlands Estate in Whitenap, [[Romsey]]. The School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences at [[Heriot-Watt University]], Edinburgh is named after him. The Mountbatten Centre for International Studies at the [[University of Southampton]] is also named after him. Mountbatten took great pride in enhancing intercultural understanding and in 1984, with his eldest daughter as the patron, the [[Mountbatten internship programme|Mountbatten Internship Programme]]<ref>http://www.mountbatten.org, Mountbatten Internship Programme-Official Site</ref> was developed to allow young adults the opportunity to enhance their intercultural appreciation and experience by spending time abroad. In his song [[Post World War Two Blues]], published on the LP [[Past, Present and Future]] from 1973, singer and songwriter [[Al Stewart]] has a reference to Mountbatten's controversy with Winston Churchill about India. {{ahnentafel top|width=100%}} {{ahnentafel-compact5 |style=font-size: 90%; line-height: 110%; |border=1 |boxstyle=padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0; |boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc; |boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9; |boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc; |boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc; |boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe; |1= 1.
