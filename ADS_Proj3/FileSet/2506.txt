either included or excluded, no closed form solution exists. As a result, methods which try to find a LTS solution through a problem sift through combinations of the data, attempting to find the ''k'' subset which yields the lowest sum of squared residuals. Methods exist for low ''n'' which will find the exact solution, however as ''n'' rises, the number of combinations grows rapidly, thus yielding methods which attempt to find approximate (but generally sufficient) solutions. == References == * Rousseeuw, P.

Lee Giles''' is the David Reese Professor at the College of Information Sciences and Technology at the [[Pennsylvania State University]]. He is also Professor of Computer Science and Engineering, Professor of Supply Chain and Information Systems, and Director of the Intelligent Systems Research Laboratory. His graduate degrees are from the University of Michigan and the University of Arizona and his undergraduate degrees are from Rhodes College and the University of Tennessee. His academic genealogy includes two Nobel laureates and prominent mathematicians.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/bio.shtml | title=Biography Page| year=2010 | accessdate=2010-10-28}}</ref> ==Research== He has been associated with [[Princeton University]], the [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Columbia University]], the [[University of Pisa]], the [[University of Trento]] and the [[University of Maryland, College Park]]. Previous positions were at NEC Research Institute (now NEC Labs), Princeton, NJ; [[Air Force Research Laboratory]]; and the [[United States Naval Research Laboratory]]. He is best known for his work on the creation of novel scientific and academic search engines and digital libraries. His research interests are in intelligent web and cyberinfrastructure tools, search engines and information retrieval, digital libraries, web services, knowledge and information management and extraction, machine learning, and information and data mining. In these areas he has over 300 publications with some in [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']], [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] and the [[PNAS|''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'']]. His research is well cited with an h-index of 49 according to Google Scholar and over 10,000 total citations as evidenced in CiteSeerX, ISI and the [[Google Scholar]]. He is a Fellow of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM),<ref>{{cite web | url=http://fellows.acm.org/fellow_citation.cfm?id=5219597&srt=alpha&alpha=G | title=C Lee Giles | work=ACM Fellows | publisher=ACM | year=2006 | accessdate=2010-01-23 | quote=For contributions to information processing and web analysis.}}</ref> [[IEEE]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ieee.org/web/membership/fellows/Alphabetical/gfellows.html#Gh | title=Fellows - G | work=IEEE Fellows | publisher=IEEE | accessdate=2010-01-23 | quote=C.

This work also showed that the web had significantly matured and had a diversity of material and resources. With [[Steve Lawrence (computer scientist)|Steve Lawrence]] and [[Kurt Bollacker]], Giles was responsible for the creation in 1997 of automatic citation indexing and [[CiteSeer]], a public academic search engine and digital library for Computer and Information Science. Under his direction [[CiteSeer]] was moved to and is being maintained at the Pennsylvania State University. CiteSeer has been replaced by the Next Generation CiteSeer, [[CiteSeerX]]. He is the director of the Next Generation CiteSeer project, [[CiteSeerX]], also at the [[Pennsylvania State University]]. In addition, he was responsible for the creation of an academic business search engine and digital library, [[BizSeer]] (previously known as SmealSearch). With [[Isaac Councill]], he created automatic [[acknowledgement index]]ing, permitting for the first time the automatic search and indexing of acknowledged entities in scholarly and research documents. His recent research in collaboration with Professors Prasenjit Mitra, Karl Mueller, Barbara Garrison and James Kubicki has resulted in the development of a search engine and data portal for chemistry, Chem<sub>x</sub>Seer, [[ChemXSeer]]. With Yang Sun, a novel search engine, [[BotSeer]], was designed that searches and indexes robots.txt files on web sites. The Next Generation CiteSeer, CiteSeer<sup>x</sup>, came on line in February, 2008, with over one million articles indexed and now with active crawling is approaching 2 million. These new services are based on [[SeerSuite]], a package of open sources tools for searching and indexing academic documents and data. ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== *[http://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/ C.
