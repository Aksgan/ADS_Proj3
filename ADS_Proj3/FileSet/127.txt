The Akiko chip performs '[[Packed pixel|chunky]]' to '[[Planar (computer graphics)|planar]]' graphics conversion in hardware. The Amiga's native display is a planar display which is simple and efficient to manipulate for routines like scrolling. However, chunky displays are faster and more efficient for 3D graphics manipulation. Akiko allows this conversion to be performed in hardware instead of relying on software conversion which would otherwise slow the system down. The conversion works by writing 32 chunky pixels to Akiko's registers and reading back eight 32-bit words of converted planar data which can then be copied to the display buffer. Akiko is also responsible for implementing some of the control logic for the CD32's [[CD-ROM]] controller, as well as for controlling the serial ('AUX') port <ref>{{cite web|title=The Big Book of Amiga Hardware - Custom Chips: Akiko|url=http://bboah.amiga-resistance.info/cgi-bin/showhardware_en.cgi?HARDID=1449}}</ref>. ==References== <references/> {{Compu-hardware-stub}} {{Amiga hardware}} [[Category:Amiga]] [[Category:Graphics chips]]</text> </page> <page> <id>1336</id> <title>Albatros (joystick)</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=February 2009}} {{primarysources|date=November 2006}} '''Albatros''' is the name of a [[joystick]] produced by Alberici S.p.a. It was sold in the 1980s on the Italian market. The joystick had six [[microswitch]]es, four for the lever and two for the buttons, together with an audible feedback. A first series was produced with a slim [[frustum]] [[cone (geometry)|cone]] lever. The second production featured a sphere on the top of a larger lever. ==External links== * [http://www.alberici.it Alberici S.p.A. site] [[Category:Joysticks]] {{videogame-hardware-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>1337</id> <title>Albert F. Case, Jr.</title> <text>'''Albert F. Case, Jr.''' (born March 2, 1955) is an American [[software engineer]] and one of the leaders in the development of [[Computer-Aided Software Engineering]] (CASE) technologies and system development methodologies. == Biography == Case is a graduate of the [[State University of New York]] at Buffalo. He began his software development career in 1972 and worked in a variety of IT-related capacities, including director of Management Information Systems for [[Ryder System]] and co-founder of Maximus Systems, Inc., developers of the Maximus code generator. In 1982, Case joined start-up [[Nastec Corporation]], a Southfield, Mich. based software development company. In 1989, Case left Nastec Corporation to join [[Gartner]], Inc. (then GartnerGroup),<ref>[http://www.Gartner.com/]</ref> the world's leading IT industry research and advisory firm, where he spent the next 13 years as a thought-leading industry analyst, speaker, writer and business executive. After 13 years, Case left Gartner to become an independent consulting executive and entrepreneur, with the goal of applying GST and "organizational engineering" in the laboratory of live businesses. Case served as a board member for Sky Capital Holdings, a New York-based investment bank; interim president and CEO of DuoCash Corporation, an innovative payment processing services company; and still serves as chairman of the board of ''eNucleus, Inc''<ref>[http://www.enucleus.com eNucleus]</ref> (ENUI.OB) a global technology-based business process outsourcing firm; and president and CEO of Turbodyne Technologies, Inc. (TRBD.OB).<ref>[http://www.turbodyne.com/ Turbodyne Technologies, Inc.]</ref> As an entrepreneur, Case is a co-founder and managing director of a variety of start up firms including content/commerce management software providers InfoTollgate.com <ref>[http://www.infotollgate.com/ InfoTollgate.com]</ref> (hosted content/commerce management systems) and Turnpike Software, LLC,<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060408000649/www.infotollgate.com/home/index.php Turnpike Software, LLC]</ref> the content management software development company (with his partner Dr. N. [[Adam Rin]], former Bachman CASE tool and Gartner alumnus). He is also publisher and co-founder of IT procurement advisor TechSpend, LLC<ref>[http://www.techspend.com/ TechSpend, LLC]</ref> (with Gartner alumnus Vinnie Mirchandani). He is also the Research Fellow and principal analyst with ES Research Group, Inc.,<ref>[http://www.esresearch.com/ ES Research Group, Inc.]</ref> which specializes in helping companies identify, select, implement and measure sales performance improvement programs. == Work == Case of the leaders in the development of [[Computer-Aided Software Engineering]] (CASE) technologies and system development methodologies. He also was a major contributor to the ''Spectrum System Development Methodology'', from John D. Toellner Associates, developing the Structured Analysis and Structured Design design tips. === Computer-Aided Software Engineering === Nastec Corporation both coined the acronym CASE for [[Computer-Aided Software Engineering]] and launched the ''DesignAid'' analysis and design tool and the ''LifeCycle Manager'' project configuration and management system. For six years, Case served as Nastec's Vice President for Professional Services and Product Management. Case, and his associate [[Vaughn Frick]] developed a second generation structured analysis and design technique based on the Yourdon/Demarco/Constantine Structured Analysis/Structured Design technique. Frick, while working with Case at Nastec Corporation on the development of the PC-based DesignAid product, was the first to specify and teach a comprehensive technique for transforming a structured analysis specification into a structured design. The revolutionary approach propelled Nastec Corporation into the leadership
