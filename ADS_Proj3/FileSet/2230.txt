multiple languages. The websites typically include historical background information and general information about the organization itself. Only some of the websites address the enemy or citizens of a country currently under attack by terrorists. The terrorists hope weaken public support within countries and in some cases will threaten attacks if the government fails to do as they ask.<ref name="Weimann 2004: 12"/></blockquote> ===Disinformation=== The use of disinformation by terrorist groups is often used to incite fear and panic by sending threats, airing videos of brutal executions, creating psychological attacks through the use of threats of cyber-terrorism. Disinformation may also be used to divert attention from an impending attack by releasing details of a hoax attack so that governmental and law enforcement agencies are side-tracked. However, this may not be wholly effective given the nature of current security climates; that is upon receiving information on a potential attack, the security level on all spectrums across a whole country is increased i.e. from black to black special or similar. ==References== {{Reflist}} ==Further reading== *Weinberg et al.

It is sometimes also called a 'board' or 'forum'. It may contain several categories, consisting of sub-forums, threads and individual posts. |accessdate = 2008-09-01}}</ref> They differ from [[chat rooms]] in that messages are at least temporarily archived. Also, depending on the access level of a user and/or the forum set-up, a posted message might need to be approved by a moderator before it becomes visible. Forums have their own language; e.g. A single conversation is called a 'thread'. A forum is hierarchical or tree-like in structure: forum - subforum - topic - thread{{clarify|what kind of topic contains a thread?|date=January 2011}} - reply. Depending on the forum set-up, users can be anonymous or have to register with the forum and then subsequently [[login|log in]] in order to post messages. Usually you do not have to log in to read existing messages. ==History== The modern forum originated from [[bulletin board]]s, and are a technological evolution of the dialup [[bulletin board system]].<ref name="bbsref">{{cite web|url=http://www.videojug.com/expertanswer/internet-communities-and-forums-2/what-is-an-internet-forum |title=What is an "Internet forum"?

Later developments emulated the different newsgroups or individual lists, providing more than one forum, dedicated to a particular topic.<ref name="bbsref"/> Internet forums are prevalent in several [[Developed country|developed countries]]. In terms of countable posts, Japan is far in the lead with over two million posts per day on their largest forum, [[2channel]]. China also has many millions of posts on forums such as [[Tianya Club]]. Forums perform a function similar to that of dial-up [[bulletin board system]]s and [[Usenet]] networks that were first created starting in the late 1970s.<ref name="bbsref"/> Early web-based forums date back as far as 1994, with the WIT<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/WIT/ |title=WIT - WWW Interactive Talk |accessdate=1995-05 |publisher=W3 Consortium}}</ref> project from W3 Consortium and starting from this time, many alternatives were created.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.forum-software.org/forum-software-timeline-from-1994-to-today |title=Forum Software Timeline 1994 - 2010 |accessdate=2010-12-24 |publisher=Forum Software Reviews}}</ref> A sense of [[virtual community]] often develops around forums that have regular users. [[Technology]], [[computer game]]s and/or [[video game]]s, [[sport]]s, [[music]], [[fashion]], [[religion]], and [[politics]] are popular areas for forum themes, but there are forums for a huge number of topics.
