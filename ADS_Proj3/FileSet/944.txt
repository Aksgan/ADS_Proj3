The rising interest in IT governance is partly due to compliance initiatives, for instance [[Sarbanes-Oxley]] in the USA and [[Basel II]] in Europe, but more so because of the need for greater accountability for decision-making around the use of IT in the best interest of all stakeholders. A characteristic theme of IT governance discussions is that the IT capability is directly related to the investment choices taken by top management that have long term consequences for various stakeholders. The traditional involvement of board-level executives in IT issues was to defer all key decisions to the company's IT professionals. IT governance implies a system in which all stakeholders, including the board, executive management, customers, and staff have clear accountability for their respective responsibilities in the decision making processes affecting IT. This prevents IT or business leaders from independently making decisions about IT without retaining responsibility for their actions and the impact they have on supporting the achievement of strategic objectives. ==Definitions== There are narrower and broader definitions of IT governance. Weill and Ross focus on "''Specifying the decision rights and accountability framework to encourage desirable behaviour in the use of IT."<ref>Weill, P. & Ross, J. W., 2004, ''IT Governance: How Top Performers Manage IT Decision Rights for Superior Results''", Harvard Business School Press, Boston.</ref> In contrast, the IT Governance Institute expands the definition to include foundational mechanisms: "''… the leadership and organisational structures and processes that ensure that the organisation’s IT sustains and extends the organisation’s strategies and objectives.''" <ref>IT Governance Institute 2003, "Board Briefing on IT Governance, 2nd Edition". Retrieved January 18, 2006 from http://www.isaca.org/Content/ContentGroups/ITGI3/Resources1/Board_Briefing_on_IT_Governance/26904_Board_Briefing_final.pdf</ref> Van Grembergen and De Haes (2009) focus on enterprise governance of IT and define this as "an integral part of corporate governance and addresses the definition and implementation of processes, structures and relational mechanisms in the organization that enable both business and IT people to execute their responsibilities in support of business/IT alignment and the creation of business value from IT enabled investments". While [[AS8015]], the Australian Standard for Corporate Governance of ICT, defines Corporate Governance of ICT as "''The system by which the current and future use of ICT is directed and controlled. It involves evaluating and directing the plans for the use of ICT to support the organisation and monitoring this use to achieve plans. It includes the strategy and policies for using ICT within an organisation.''" ==Background== The discipline of information technology [[governance]] first emerged in 1993 as a derivitive of corporate governance and deals primarily with the connection between strategic objectives and [[IT management]] of an [[organization]]. It highlights the importance of IT related matters in contemporary organizations and states that strategic IT decisions should be owned by the corporate board, rather than by the [[chief information officer]] or other IT managers. <!-- rejigged the para above, very slightly - concerned about confusion between governance and portfolio/programme management --> The primary goals for information technology governance are to (1) assure that the [[investments]] in IT generate [[business value]], and (2) mitigate the risks that are associated with IT. This can be done by implementing an [[organizational structure]] with well-defined roles for the responsibility of [[information]], [[business process]]es, [[application software|applications]], [[infrastructure]], etc. Accountability is the key concern of IT governance. After the widely reported collapse of [[Enron]] in 2000 and the alleged problems within [[Arthur Andersen]] and [[WorldCom]], the duties and responsibilities of auditors and the boards of directors for public and privately held corporations were questioned. As a response to this, and to attempt to prevent similar problems from happening again, the US [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] was written to stress the importance of business control and auditing. Although not directly related to IT governance, Sarbanes-Oxley and Basel-II in Europe have influenced the development of information technology governance since the early 2000s. Following Corporate collapses in Australia around the same time, working groups were established to develop standards for Corporate Governance. A series of Australian Standards for Corporate Governance were published in 2003, these were: * Good Governance Principles (AS8000) * Fraud and Corruption Control (AS8001) * Organisational Codes of Conduct (AS8002) * Corporate Social Responsibility (AS8003) * Whistle Blower protection programs (AS8004) AS8015 Corporate Governance of ICT was published in January 2005. It was fast-track adopted as ISO/IEC 38500 in May 2008.[http://www.itsmf.nl/imagesfile/PRESENTATIES%20JC%2008%20tbv%20publicatie/Christophe%20Feltus%20Introduction%20to%20ISO%2038500%20v1_0.pdf Introduction to ISO 38500] ==Problems with IT governance== Is IT governance different from IT management and IT controls? The problem with IT governance is that often it is confused with good management practices and IT control frameworks. [[ISO 38500]] has helped clarify IT governance by describing it as the [[management system]] used by directors. In other words, IT governance is about the stewardship of IT resources on behalf of the [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] who expect a return from their investment. The directors responsible for this stewardship will look to the
