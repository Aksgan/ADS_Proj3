It was founded in 1994 by a group of [[Internet service provider]]s. LINX is a founder member of [http://www.euro-ix.net EURO-IX], a Europe-wide alliance of Internet Exchanges. It is currently the [[List of Internet exchange points by size|third largest]] neutral IXP in Europe in terms of average throughput . LINX is a not-for-profit organisation ([[Company Limited by Guarantee]]). [[Internet service provider]]s join LINX as members and sign a [[memorandum of understanding]]. Members collectively 'own' the company and all members have a [[Single transfer voting|single vote]] at [[Annual general meeting|AGMs]] and EGMs in matters relating to finances, constitution, and what activities LINX may carry out. Members also periodically elect the LINX non-executive board of directors. Members meet at regular LINX meetings to discuss technical, corporate governance, and regulatory matters. LINX has a mandate to not actively compete with its members. ==Technology== LINX operates two physically separate networks or [[network switch|switching platforms]] on different [[Computer architecture|architecture]]s using equipment from different manufacturers ([[Extreme Networks]] and [[Brocade Communications Systems]], formerly [[Foundry Networks]]). These networks are deployed over ten locations, each connected by multiple [[10 Gigabit Ethernet]] connections over [[Optical fiber|fibre]] networks. The ten locations are: * [[Telehouse|Telehouse North]] * [[Telehouse|Telehouse East]] * [[TelecityGroup|TeleCity Harbour Exchange]] (8/9 - ex TeleCity) * [[TelecityGroup|TeleCity Millharbour]] * [[TelecityGroup|TeleCity Harbour Exchange]] (6/7 - ex Redbus) * [[TelecityGroup|TeleCity Sovereign House]] * [[TelecityGroup|TeleCity Meridian Gate]] (Memaco House) * [[TelecityGroup|TeleCity Powergate]] * [[Equinix]] London-4 * [[Interxion]] London City Connecting is also possible from remote locations via the 'LINX from Anywhere' scheme via a range of layer 2 service/MPLS carriers. Redundancy of the network is managed using rapid-failover protection mechanisms such as Foundry Metro Ring Protocol (MRP) and Extreme [[Ethernet Automatic Protection System]] (EAPS). These restore connectivity within tenths of a second in the event of the loss of a network segment. In addition to the main peering infrastructure, LINX provides managed private interconnections (via [[Single-mode optical fiber|Single Mode Fibre]]) between LINX members, and works with a number of fibre carriers to provide rapid connection between LINX members for private circuits. These PI circuits may be used for any purpose but are mainly intended for Private Peering arrangements between members. Private Peering is sometimes more appropriate for managing large flows of traffic between ISPs and/or Content Providers. ==Regulatory== LINX provides its members with an important Regulatory and Public Affairs service, and liaises where appropriate with many third parties including the [[Internet Watch Foundation]], [[Ofcom]], the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]], the [[Information Commissioner]], and other government departments in matters such as content regulation, telecoms regulation, privacy and data protection, [[e-mail spam]], online fraud/[[phishing]], law enforcement, counter-terrorism, and other regulatory matters in the UK and Europe affecting the Internet industry. The regulatory function of LINX is mainly to represent the member [[Internet service provider|ISPs]] (as a group) to these third parties, respond to consultations, and report to and consult with the LINX members regarding any developments that may affect their business or operations. LINX also produce Best Current Practice (BCP) documents for LINX members. These BCPs are developed in consultation with LINX members and other experts. Examples include a Best Current Practice for dealing with e-Mail spam and web sites that are linked to in spam messages. Members can use these BCPs when developing their own policies, but they are not obliged to do so. In August 2004, LINX announced its BCP to members to take action against spammer-run websites, as well as websites advertised through spam. The plan also includes a crackdown on sites selling spammer tools, such as email address lists.<ref>http://www.theregister.com/2004/08/18/isp_war_on_spam/</ref> LINX can also provide a dispute resolution service between members where appropriate. ==Other activities== LINX also carries on a number of non-core activities (NCAPs) from time to time, for example the LINX Accredited Internet Technician (LAIT) training programme. Other services provided include a time service using [[atomic clock]]s, as well as hosting for other "Good of the Internet" services including various Internet statistics projects, numerous [[Name server|secondary name servers]] for various [[ccTLD]] domains, and instances of the F, K and I [[root nameserver]]s. ==See also== Some other Internet exchange points in London: * [[London Internet Providers Exchange]] (LIPEX) * [[LoNAP|London Network Access Point]] (LONAP) * [[Packet Exchange]] (Formerly XchangePoint) * [[Redbus Internet Exchange]] (RBIEX) LINX hosts a number of meetings where network operators can exchange information: see [[List of Internet Network Operators' Groups]] for a list of other organizations holding similar meetings. ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== * [https://www.linx.net/ Official Website] * [https://www.linx.net/pubtools/looking-glass.html Looking glass] * [https://www.linx.net/govern/mou.html LINX Memorandum of Understanding] * [http://publicaffairs.linx.net/ LINX Public Affairs] * [http://www.euro-ix.net/ EURO-IX] * [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3700290.stm LINX overtakes US as biggest data hub] * [http://www.vatanist.com vatanist] * [http://www.indirbea.com full indir] {{Telecommunications industry in the United Kingdom}} [[Category:Internet exchange points]] [[Category:Internet architecture]] [[Category:Network access]] [[Category:Telecommunications in the United Kingdom]] [[Category:Internet in the United Kingdom]] [[Category:Media and communications in Tower Hamlets]] [[cs:London Internet Exchange]] [[nl:London Internet Exchange]] [[ru:LINX]]</text> </page> <page> <id>22606</id> <title>Long-term experiment</title> <text>{{Multiple issues | citations missing = June 2009 | cleanup = June 2009 | confusing = June 2009 | context = June 2009 | introrewrite = June 2009 | refimprove = June 2009 | restructure = June 2009 | rewrite = June 2009 | expert=Science|date=June 2009}} A long term [[experiment]] is an experimental procedure that runs through a long period of time, in order to test a [[hypothesis]] or observe a phenomenon that takes place at an extremely slow rate. Several agricultural [[field experiment]]s have run for more than 100 years, but much shorter experiments may qualify as "long-term" in other disciplines. An [[experiment]] is "a
