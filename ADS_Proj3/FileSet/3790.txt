Four of the most common rhetorical modes and their purpose are [[Expository writing|exposition]], [[argumentation]], [[description]], and [[narrative|narration]]. ==Exposition== The purpose of [[Exposition (literary technique)| exposition]] (or expository writing) is to explain and analyze information by presenting an idea, relevant evidence, and appropriate discussion. Examples include: *[[Business letter]]s *[[How-to|How-to essays, such as recipes and other instructions]] *[[Article (publishing)|News stories]] *[[Personal letter]]s *[[News release|Press releases]] *[[Research report|Reports]] *[[Scientific report]]s *[[Term paper]]s *[[Textbook]]s *[[Will (law)|Wills]] *[[Encyclopedia|Encyclopedia articles]] ==Argumentation== The purpose of argumentation (also called ''[[persuasive writing]]'') is to prove the validity of an idea, or point of view, by presenting sound reasoning, discussion, and argument that thoroughly convince the reader. Persuasive writing is a type of argumentation with the additional aim to urge the reader to take some form of action. Examples include: *[[Copywriting|Advertising Copy]] *[[review|Critical review]] *[[Editorial]]s *[[Job evaluation]] *[[Job application]] letter *[[Letter of recommendation]] *[[Letter to the editor|Letters to the editor]] *[[Résumé]]s ==Description== The purpose of description is to re-create, invent, or visually present a person, place, event, or action so that the reader can picture that which is being described. Descriptive writing can be found in the other rhetorical modes. Examples include: *[[Personal journal|Journal writing]] *[[Poetry]] ==Narration== The purpose of narration is to tell a story or narrate an event or series of events. This writing mode frequently uses the tools of descriptive writing. Narration is an especially useful tool for sequencing or putting details and information into some kind of logical order, usually chronological. Working with narration helps us see clear sequences separate from all other mental functions. Examples include: *[[Anecdote]]s *[[Autobiography]] *[[Biography]] *[[Novel]]s *[[Oral history]] *[[Short story]] ===Fiction-writing modes=== Each [[fiction-writing mode]] has its own purposes and conventions. Agent and author Evan Marshall identifies five fiction-writing modes: action, summary, dialogue, feelings/thoughts, and background {{Harvard citation | Marshall | 1988 | pp = 143–165}}. Author and writing-instructor [[Jessica Page Morrell]] lists six delivery modes for fiction-writing: action, exposition, description, dialogue, summary, and transition {{Harvard citation | Morrell | 2006 | p = 127}}. Author [[Peter Selgin]] refers to ''methods'', including action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, scene, and description {{Harvard citation | Selgin | 2007 | p = 38}}. Currently, there is no consensus within the writing community regarding the number and composition of fiction-writing modes and their uses.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.helium.com/items/197336-fiction-writing-modes-and-how-to-use-them | title = Fiction-writing modes and how to use them | last = Klaassen | first = M | accessdate = 2009-04-30 | publisher = [[Helium.com]] }}</ref> ==See also== *[[Exposition (literary technique)]] *[[Expository writing]] *[[Fiction writing]] *[[Fiction-writing modes]] *[[Literature]] *[[Writing]] ==Footnotes== {{reflist}} == References== * {{cite book |author=Rosakis LE |title=Complete Idiot's Guide to Grammar and Style 2E (The Complete Idiot's Guide) |publisher=Alpha |location=Indianapolis, IN |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=1-59257-115-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}} *{{cite book |title = The Marshall Plan for Novel Writing |first = E |last = Marshall |publisher = Writer's Digest Books |location = Cincinnati, OH |year = 1998 |pages = 143–165 |isbn = 1582970629 }} *{{cite book |title = Between the Lines: Master the Subtle Elements of Fiction Writing |first = JP |last = Morrell |publisher = Writer's Digest Books |location = Cincinnati, OH |year = 2006 |pages = 127 |isbn = 9781582973937 }} *{{cite book |first = P |last = Selgin |title = By Cunning & Craft: Sound Advice and Practical Wisdom for fiction writers |publisher = Writer's Digest Books |location = Cincinnati, OH |year = 2007 |pages = 38 |isbn = 9781582974910 }} {{Narrative modes}} [[Category:Grammar]] [[Category:Narratology]] [[Category:Writing]] [[Category:Rhetoric|Modes]] [[id:Karangan]]</text> </page> <page> <id>32022</id> <title>Rhizome (philosophy)</title> <text>{{refimprove|article|date=October 2008}} [[File:Gilles_Deleuze_in_1987.jpg.png|thumb|right|180px|[[Gilles Deleuze]]]] [[File:Félix_Guattari.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Félix Guattari]]]] '''Rhizome''' is a philosophical concept developed by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] in their ''[[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]'' (1972–1980) project. It is what Deleuze calls an "image of thought", based on the [[rhizome|botanical rhizome]], that apprehends [[Multiplicity (philosophy)|multiplicities]]. ==Rhizome as a mode of knowledge and model for society== [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] use the term "rhizome" to describe theory and research that allows for multiple, non-hierarchical entry and exit points in data representation and interpretation. In ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'', they oppose it to an [[arborescent]] conception of knowledge, which works with [[dualism|dualist]] categories and binary choices. A rhizome works with horizontal and trans-species connections, while an arborescent model works with vertical and linear connections. Their use of the "orchid and the wasp" is taken from the biological concept of [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], in which two different species interact together to form a [[multiplicity (philosophy)|multiplicity]] (i.e. a unity that is multiple in itself). [[Horizontal gene transfer]] would also be a good illustration. As a model for culture, the rhizome resists the organizational structure of the root-tree system which charts causality along chronological lines and looks for the originary source of "things" and looks towards the pinnacle or conclusion of those "things." A rhizome, on the other hand, "ceaselessly established connections between semiotic chains, organizations of power, and circumstances relative to the arts, sciences, and social struggles." Rather than narrativize history and culture, the rhizome presents history and culture as a map or wide array of attractions and influences with no specific origin or genesis, for a "rhizome has no beginning or end; it is always in the
