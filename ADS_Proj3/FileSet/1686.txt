It facilitates [[RAID5]] functionality without the need of a hardware RAID controller. geom_raid5 allows storage of large amounts of data to be protected against disk failure, while providing good throughput performance. Like other FreeBSD storage modules, geom_raid5 utilizes the [[GEOM]] framework. It is built as a kernel loadable module (KLD) which allows it to run inside the FreeBSD kernel. The module can be compiled on FreeBSD release 5 and newer releases. geom_raid5 is also incorporated into [[FreeNAS]], an Operating System dedicated to [[NAS|Network Attached Storage]]. Its author, Arne Woerner, has released the software under the BSD license, making geom_raid5 [[Open Source Initiative|OSI]]-compliant [[open source]] software. == Comparing to other Software RAID5 solutions == '''geom_raid5''' distinguishes itself by providing both advanced features and high performance. While the theoretical maximum write speed is ''<speed of slowest disk> · (<number of disks> - 1)'', the latest version is able to achieve about 80% of that theoretical maximum. This is in huge contrast with other software RAID5 solutions{{Fact|date=May 2008}} which sometimes achieve less than 10% of that throughput combined with significantly higher [[CPU]] utilization. The reason for this huge difference lies in geom_raid5's design. In order to write data to a RAID5 volume, data must often first be read in order to calculate the parity information that protects against data loss in case of a single disk failure. Using request combining a full stripe block can be 'collected' so a read is no longer required. This means the harddrive heads do not need to change position every time but can write data contiguously, theoretically at full speed. Of course, this only works with sequential transfers and sometimes even then the filesystem does not write contiguously. But using request combining, geom_raid5 manages to outperform any software RAID5 solution to date, capable of reaching write-speeds associated with hardware RAID5 on budget-level [[x86]] hardware. Currently the module is being finalized. When a stable version is released the author will release further information about its design and disclose benchmarks. In particular, benchmarks showing geom_raid5 performance versus [[ZFS]]'s [[RAID-Z]] are long awaited by users. ==Variants== Various incarnations of geom raid5 exist which trade off speed for memory usage. * geom_raid5 The most stable version but slower than the other variants in certain cases * geom_raid5 TNG Uses more memory to deliver better transfer rates * geom_raid5 PP Memory usage and speed is in between the TNG and PP. Uses less memory than TNG but is slower. Uses more memory than the original geom_raid5 driver and is faster. It is also claimed that PP's code best being the cleanest of the three ==External links== * [[FreeBSD]] [[perforce]]: [http://perforce.freebsd.org/depotTreeBrowser.cgi?FSPC=//depot/user/riddick repository for '''geom_raid5'''] * geom_raid5 sources: http://www.wgboome.de/geom_raid5.html [[Category:RAID]] [[Category:FreeBSD]]</text> </page> <page> <id>15128</id> <title>Geometric analysis</title> <text>'''Geometric analysis''' is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] discipline at the interface of [[differential geometry]] and [[differential equations]]. It includes both the use of geometrical methods in the study of [[partial differential equation]]s (when it is also known as "geometric PDE"), and the application of the theory of partial differential equations to geometry. It incorporates problems involving curves and surfaces, or domains with curved boundaries, but also the study of [[Riemannian manifold]]s in arbitrary dimension. The [[calculus of variations]] is sometimes regarded as part of geometric analysis, because differential equations arising from [[variational principle]]s have a strong geometric content. Geometric analysis also includes [[global analysis]], which concerns the study of differential equations on manifolds, and the relationship between differential equations and [[topology]]. ==References== *{{cite book|title=Riemannian geometry and Geometric Analysis |first=Jürgen|last=Jost |edition=4th edition|year=2005|publisher=Springer|isbn= 978-3540259077}} *{{cite book|title=Groups and Geometric Analysis (Integral Geometry, Invariant Differential Operators and Spherical Functions) |first=Sigurdur|last=Helgason|authorlink=Sigurdur Helgason (mathematician)|edition=2nd edition|year=2000|publisher=American Mathematical Society|isbn= 978-0821826737}} *{{cite book|title=Geometric Analysis on Symmetric Spaces |first=Sigurdur|last=Helgason |edition=2nd edition|year=2008|publisher=American Mathematical Society|isbn= 978-0821845301}} [[Category:Mathematical analysis]] {{mathanalysis-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>15147</id> <title>Geometry of interaction</title> <text>The '''Geometry of Interaction''' (GoI) was introduced by [[Jean-Yves Girard]] shortly after his work on [[Linear Logic]]. In [[Linear Logic]] proofs can be seen as some kind of networks instead of the flat tree structure of [[Sequent calculus]]. To distinguish the real [[Proof net]]s from all the possible networks, Girard devised a criterium involving trips in the network. Trips can in fact be seen as some kind of [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]]{{Clarify|date=December 2010}} acting on the proof. Drawing from this observation, Girard described directly this operator from the proof and has given a formula, the so-called ''Execution formula'', encoding the process of [[cut elimination]] at the level of
