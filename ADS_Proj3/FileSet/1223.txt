a display list can be defined as a CPU-driven series of writes to certain display-mode, color-control, or other visual effect registers in the video device, rather than a series of rendering commands. Thus, one must create the displayed image using some other rendering process either before or while the display list is operating. In many cases, the image is also modified or re-rendered between [[film frame|frames]], often with the display list turned off during this time. The image is then displayed in various ways depending on the exact way in which the display list is implemented. Examples of display lists on these older machines might include effects such as the Amiga's [[Hold-and-Modify|HAM]] modes, Commodore 64/128's [http://www.studiostyle.sk/dmagic/gallery/gfxmodes.htm FLI] mode, or [[Rainbow Processing]] on the ZX Spectrum. Many hardcopy devices also make use of display lists to avoid the necessity of a frame buffer. As an example, a high-resolution [[PostScript]] printer printing A4 pages at 600 [[Dots per inch|dpi]] would need in excess of a gigabyte of [[RAM]] for its [[framebuffer]]. By converting the PostScript or other [[page description language]] input into a series of graphics commands, the contents of a page can usually be represented in a more modest amount of memory. The commands can then be scan converted (or [[Rasterisation|rasterized]]) into pixels and fed to the printer engine a few scan lines at a time.

It is the reciprocal of [[Quality factor]], which represents the quality of oscillation. For example, [[electric power]] is dissipated in all [[dielectric]] materials, usually in the form of [[heat]]. In a [[capacitor]] made of a dielectric placed between conductors, the typical [[lumped element model]] includes a lossless ideal capacitor in series with a resistor termed the [[equivalent series resistance]] (ESR) as shown below.<ref>http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/sciences/physics/electromagnetism/electrostatics/Capacitors/Applications/BasicConsiderations/BasicConsiderations.htm</ref> The ESR represents losses in the capacitor. In a good capacitor the ESR is very small, and in a poor capacitor the ESR is large. Note that the ESR is ''not'' simply the resistance that would be measured across a capacitor by an [[ohmmeter]]. The ESR is a derived quantity with physical origins in both the dielectric's conduction electrons and dipole relaxation phenomena. In a dielectric only one of either the conduction electrons or the dipole relaxation typically dominates loss.<ref>S. Ramo, J.R. Whinnery, and T. Van Duzer, ''Fields and Waves in Communication Electronics'', 3rd ed., (John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1994). ISBN 0-471-58551-3</ref> For the case of the conduction electrons being the dominant loss, then <math> ESR = \frac {\sigma} {\varepsilon \omega^2 C} </math> , where : <math> \sigma </math> is the dielectric's bulk [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]], : <math> \omega </math> is the [[angular frequency]] of the AC current ''i'', : <math> \varepsilon </math> is the lossless [[permittivity]] of the dielectric, and : <math> C </math> is the lossless capacitance. [[Image:Loss tangent phasors 1.svg|frame|A real capacitor has a lumped element model of a lossless ideal capacitor in series with an equivalent series resistance (ESR). The loss tangent is defined by the angle between the capacitor's impedance vector and the negative reactive axis.]] If the capacitor is used in an [[alternating current|AC]] circuit, the dissipation factor due to the non-ideal capacitor is expressed as the ratio of the [[Electrical resistance|resistive]] power loss in the ESR to the [[Reactance (electronics)|reactive]] power oscillating in the capacitor, or <math> DF = \frac {i^2 ESR} {i^2 |X_{c}|} = \omega C \cdot ESR = \frac {\sigma} {\varepsilon \omega} = 1 / Q </math> . When representing the electrical circuit parameters as vectors in a [[Complex number|complex]] plane, known as [[Phasor (sine waves)|phasors]], a capacitor's dissipation factor is equal to the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangent]] of the angle between the capacitor's impedance vector and the negative reactive axis, as shown in the diagram to the right. This gives rise to the parameter known as the [[loss tangent]] ''δ'' where <math>\tan \delta = \frac {ESR} {|X_{c}|} = DF </math> . Since the ''DF'' in a good capacitor is usually small, ''δ'' ~ ''DF'', and ''DF'' is often expressed as a percentage. ''DF'' approximates to the [[power factor]] when <math>ESR</math> is far less than <math>Xc</math>, which is usually the case. ''DF'' will vary depending on the dielectric material and the frequency of the electrical signals. In low [[dielectric constant]] ([[low-k]]), temperature compensating ceramics, ''DF'' of 0.1% to 0.2% is typical. In high dielectric constant ceramics, ''DF'' can be 1% to 2%. However, lower ''DF'' is usually an indication of quality capacitors when comparing similar dielectric material. ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Electromagnetism]] [[Category:Electrical engineering]] [[Category:Dynamical systems]] [[de:Verlustfaktor]] [[ko:유전정접]] [[ja:誘電正接]] [[fi:Häviökerroin]]</text> </page> <page> <id>10751</id> <title>Distortion problem</title> <text>In [[functional analysis]], a branch of mathematics, the '''distortion problem''' is to determine by how much one can [[distortion (mathematics)|distort]] the unit sphere in a given [[Banach space]] using an equivalent norm. Specifically, a Banach space ''X'' is called &lambda;-distortable if there exists an equivalent norm |''x''| on ''X'' such that, for all infinite-dimensional subspaces ''Y'' in ''X'', :<math>\sup_{y_1,y_2\in Y, \|y_i\|=1} \frac{|y_1|}{|y_2|} \ge \lambda</math> (see [[distortion (mathematics)]]). Note that every Banach space is trivially 1-distortable. A Banach space is called distortable if it is &lambda;-distortable for some &lambda; > 1. Distortability first emerged as an important property of Banach spaces in the 1960s, where it was studied by {{harvtxt|James|1964}} and {{harvtxt|Milman|1971}}. Milman showed that if ''X'' is a Banach space that does not contain an isomorphic copy of ''c''<sub>0</sub> or ℓ<sup>''p''</sup> for some {{nowrap|1 &le; ''p'' < &infin;}} (see [[sequence space]]), then some infinite-dimensional subspace of ''X'' is distortable. So the distortion problem is now primarily of interest on the spaces ℓ<sup>''p''</sup>, all of which are [[separable metric space|separable]]. In separable spaces, distortability is equivalent to the ostensibly more general question of whether or not every real-valued [[Lipschitz function]] <math> f </math> defined on the sphere in ''X'' stabilizes on the sphere of an infinite dimensional subspace, i.e., whether there
