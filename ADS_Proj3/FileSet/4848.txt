In a typical zero-knowledge proof of a statement, the prover will use a '''witness''' for the statement as input to the protocol, and the verifier will learn nothing other than the truth of the statement. In a WIP, this zero-knowledge condition is weakened, and the only guarantee is that the verifier will not be able to distinguish between provers that use different witnesses. In particular, the protocol may leak information about the set of all witnesses, or even leak the witness that was used when there is only one possible witness. Witness-indistinguishable proof systems were first introduced by Feige and Shamir<ref>Uriel Feige, Adi Shamir. [http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/100216.100272 Witness Indistinguishable and Witness Hiding Protocols]. In ''Proceedings of 22nd STOC'', p.416-426. ACM Press, 1990.</ref>. Unlike zero-knowledge proofs, they remain secure when multiple proofs are being performed concurrently. ==References== <references/> [[Category:Cryptographic protocols]] [[Category:Theory of cryptography]]</text> </page> <page> <id>40423</id> <title>Wits and Wagers (video game)</title> <text>{{Infobox VG| title = Wits and Wagers |image = [[File:Witsandwagescover.jpg]] |developer= Hidden Path Entertainment |publisher= [[Microsoft Game Studios]] |released = May 7, {{vgy|2008}} |genre = [[Trivia]]/[[Party game]] |modes = [[Single player]], [[Multiplayer game|Multiplayer]] |ratings = {{vgratings|ESRB=Everyone}} |platforms = [[Xbox 360]] ([[Xbox Live Arcade|XBLA]]) |media = Download |input = [[Gamepad]], [[Big Button Controller]] }} [[Image:Witsandwagers xbla.jpg|left|thumb|Typical gameplay screenshot.]] '''''Wits and Wagers''''' is an [[Xbox Live Arcade]] title based on the award winning [[Wits and Wagers|Wits and Wagers board game]].<ref name="tiqal">{{cite web| author= | title=Spring Fever is in the Air – Xbox LIVE Arcade Adds New Arcade Hits and Gives You a Sneak Peek at Upcoming Titles | publisher=Microsoft Gamerscore Blog | date=2008-03-17 | accessdate=2008-03-17 | url=http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2008/03/17/arcadepricesdownandtocome.aspx }}</ref> The title was released on May 7, 2008 for 800 [[Microsoft Points]].

In these methods the idea is to find <math>\min_x f(\mathbf{x})</math> for some [[smooth function|smooth]] <math>f:\mathbb R^n\to\mathbb R</math>. Each step often involves approximately solving the subproblem <math>\min_{\alpha} f(\mathbf{x}_k + \alpha \mathbf{p}_k)</math> where <math>\mathbf{x}_k</math> is the current best guess, <math>\mathbf{p}_k \in \mathbb R^n</math> is a search direction, and <math>\alpha \in \mathbb R</math> is the step length. Then inexact line searches provide an efficient way of computing an acceptable step length <math>\alpha</math> that reduces the [[objective function]] 'sufficiently', rather than minimizing the objective function over <math>\alpha\in\mathbb R^+</math> exactly. A line search algorithm can use Wolfe conditions as a requirement for any guessed <math>\alpha</math>, before finding a new search direction <math>\mathbf{p}_k</math>. Denote a univariate function <math>\phi</math> restricted to the direction <math>\mathbf{p}_k</math> as <math>\phi(\alpha)=f(\mathbf{x}_k+\alpha\mathbf{p}_k)</math>. A step length <math>\alpha_k</math> is said to satisfy the ''Wolfe conditions'' if the following two inequalities hold: :i) <math>f(\mathbf{x}_k+\alpha_k\mathbf{p}_k)\leq f(\mathbf{x}_k)+c_1\alpha_k\mathbf{p}_k^{\mathrm T}\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)</math>, :ii) <math>\mathbf{p}_k^{\mathrm T}\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k+\alpha_k\mathbf{p}_k)\geq c_2\mathbf{p}_k^{\mathrm T}\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)</math>, with <math>0<c_1<c_2<1</math>. (In examining condition (ii), recall that to ensure that <math>\mathbf{p}_k</math> is a descent direction, we have <math>\mathbf{p}_k^{\mathrm T}\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k) < 0 </math>.) <math>c_1</math> is usually chosen to quite small while <math>c_2</math> is much larger; Nocedal gives example values of <math>c_1=10^{-4}</math> and <math>c_2=0.9</math> for Newton or quasi-Newton methods and <math>c_2=0.1</math> for the nonlinear [[conjugate gradient method]]. Inequality i) is known as the '''Armijo rule''' <ref>{{cite journal | last = Armijo | first = Larry | year = 1966 | title = Minimization of functions having Lipschitz continuous first partial derivatives | journal = Pacific J. Math. | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–3 | url = http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.pjm/1102995080}}</ref> and ii) as the '''curvature condition'''; i) ensures that the step length <math>\alpha_k</math> decreases <math>f</math> 'sufficiently', and ii) ensures that the slope has been reduced sufficiently. The Wolfe conditions, however, can result in a value for the step length that is not close to a minimizer of <math>\phi</math>. If we modify the curvature condition to the following, :iia) <math>\big|\mathbf{p}_k^{\mathrm T}\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k+\alpha_k\mathbf{p}_k)\big|\leq c_2\big|\mathbf{p}_k^{\mathrm T}\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\big|</math> then i) and iia) together form the so-called '''strong Wolfe conditions''', and force <math>\alpha_k</math> to lie close to a [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]] of <math>\phi</math>. The principal reason for imposing the Wolfe conditions in an optimization algorithm where <math> x_{k+1} = x_k + \alpha p_k </math> is to ensure convergence of the gradient to zero. In particular, if the cosine of the angle between <math>p_k</math> and the gradient, :: <math> \cos \theta_k = \frac {\nabla f(x_k)^{\mathrm T}p_k }{\| \nabla f(x_k)\| \|p_k\| } </math> is bounded away from zero and the i) and ii) hold, then <math>
