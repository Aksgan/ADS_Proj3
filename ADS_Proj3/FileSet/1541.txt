EHO Food Hygiene certification is required to prepare and distribute food. While there is no specified expiry date of such a qualification the changes in legislation it is suggested to update every five years. '''[[Shelf life|Best before]]''' indicates a future date beyond which the food product ''may'' lose quality in terms of taste or texture amongst others, but does not imply any serious health problems if food is consumed beyond this date (within reasonable limits). '''Use by''' indicates a legal date beyond which it is not permissible to sell a food product (usually one that deteriorates fairly rapidly after production) due to the potential serious nature of consumption of pathogens. Leeway is sometimes provided by producers in stating '''display until''' dates so that products are not at their limit of safe consumption on the actual date stated (this latter is voluntary and not subject to regulatory control). This allows for the variability in production, storage and display methods. ===United States=== With the exception of infant formula and baby foods which must be withdrawn by their expiration date, Federal law does not require expiration dates. For all other foods, except dairy products in some states, freshness dating is strictly voluntary on the part of manufacturers. In response to consumer demand, perishable foods are typically labeled with a '''Sell by''' date.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homecooking.about.com/library/weekly/aa102102a.htm|title= Expiration, Use-by, and Sell-by Dates, Part 1: Expiration dating is not federally required on all products}}</ref> It is up to the consumer to decide how long after the Sell by date a package is usable. Other common dating statements are '''Best if used by''', '''Use-by date''', '''Expiration date''', '''Guaranteed fresh <date>''', and '''Pack date'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homecooking.about.com/library/weekly/aa102102b.htm|title= Expiration, Use-by, and Sell-by Dates, Part 2: Deciphering food expiration codes can be tricky.}}</ref> ===Australia and New Zealand=== Guide to Food Labelling and Other Information Requirements: This guide provides background information on the general labelling requirements in the Code. The information in this guide applies both to food for retail sale and to food for catering purposes. Foods for catering purposes means those foods for use in restaurants, canteens, schools, caterers or self-catering institutions, where food is offered for immediate consumption. Labelling and information requirements in the new Code apply both to food sold or prepared for sale in Australia and New Zealand and food imported into Australia and New Zealand.

These include better education of consumers on how to use, transport, and store fresh food products, but also by enhancing the use by and sell by dates by adding to the package smart indicators such as TTIs (Time Temperature Indicators). These show through a visible color change whether the product is still fresh. TTIs are already in use by retailers and food producers in France ([[Monoprix]] and [[Carrefour]]), Switzerland (Kneuss), and other countries in western Europe.<ref>[http://www.onvu.com/_en/media_highlights.asp?25729ddc-6b63-48c7-8341-38dddd59b5fd Highlights].
