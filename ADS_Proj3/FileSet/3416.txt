because it does not contain any odd-length cycles, but it is said to be '''bipancyclic''' if it contains cycles of all even lengths from 4 to ''n''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Schmeichel|Mitchem|1982}}.</ref> ==Planar graphs== A [[maximal element|maximal]] [[outerplanar graph]] is a graph formed by a [[simple polygon]] in the plane by [[polygon triangulation|triangulating]] its interior. Every maximal outerplanar graph is pancyclic, as can be shown by induction. The outer face of the graph is an ''n''-vertex cycle, and removing any triangle connected to the rest of the graph by only one edge (a leaf of the tree that forms the [[dual graph]] of the triangulation) forms a maximal outerplanar graph on one fewer vertex, that by induction has cycles of all the remaining lengths. With more care in choosing which triangle to remove, the same argument shows more strongly that every maximal outerplanar graph is node-pancyclic.<ref>{{harvtxt|Li|Corneil|Mendelsohn|2000}}, Proposition 2.5.</ref> A maximal [[planar graph]] is a planar graph in which all faces, even the outer face, are triangles. A maximal planar graph is node-pancyclic if and only if it has a Hamiltonian cycle:<ref>{{harvtxt|Helden|2007}}, Corollary 3.78.</ref> if it is not Hamiltonian, it is certainly not pancyclic, and if it is Hamiltonian, then the interior of the Hamiltonian cycle forms a maximal outerplanar graph on the same nodes, to which the previous argument for maximal planar graphs can be applied.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bernhart|Kainen|1979}}.</ref> For instance, the illustration shows the pancyclicity of the graph of an [[octahedron]], a Hamiltonian maximal planar graph with six vertices. More strongly, by the same argument, if a maximal planar graph has a cycle of length ''k'', it has cycles of all smaller lengths.<ref>{{harvtxt|Hakimi|Schmeichel|1979}}.</ref> [[Halin graph]]s are the planar graphs formed from a planar drawing of a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] that has no degree-two vertices, by adding a cycle to the drawing that connects all the leaves of the tree. Halin graphs are not necessarily pancyclic, but they are '''almost pancyclic''' in the sense that there is at most one missing cycle length. The length of the missing cycle is necessarily even. If none of the interior vertices of a Halin graph has degree three, then it is necessarily pancyclic.<ref>{{harvtxt|Skowrońska|1985}}.</ref> {{harvtxt|Bondy|1971}} observed that many classical conditions for the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle were also sufficient conditions for a graph to be pancyclic, and on this basis conjectured that every 4-connected planar graph is pancyclic. However, {{harvtxt|Malkevitch|1971}} found a family of counterexamples. ==Tournaments== A [[Tournament (graph theory)|tournament]] is a directed graph with one directed edge between each pair of vertices. Intuitively, a tournament can be used to model a [[round-robin tournament|round-robin sports competition]], by drawing an edge from the winner to the loser of each game in the competition. A tournament is called [[strongly connected graph|strongly connected]] or strong if and only if it cannot be partitioned into two subsets ''L'' and ''W'' of losers and winners, such that every competitor in ''W'' beats every competitor in ''L''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Harary|Moser|1966}}, Corollary 5b.</ref> Every strong tournament is pancyclic<ref>{{harvtxt|Harary|Moser|1966}}, Theorem 7.</ref> and node-pancyclic.<ref>{{harvtxt|Moon|1966}}, Theorem 1.</ref> If a tournament is [[regular graph|regular]] (each competitor has the same number of wins and losses as each other competitor) then it is also edge-pancyclic;<ref>{{harvtxt|Alspach|1967}}.</ref> however, a strong tournament with four vertices cannot be edge-pancyclic. ==Graphs with many edges== [[Mantel's theorem]] states that any ''n''-vertex undirected graph with at least ''n''<sup>2</sup>/4 edges, and no multiple edges or self-loops, either contains a triangle or it is the [[complete bipartite graph]] ''K''<sub>''n''/2,''n''/2</sub>. This theorem can be strengthened: any undirected graph with at least ''n''<sup>2</sup>/4 edges is either pancyclic or ''K''<sub>''n''/2,''n''/2</sub>.<ref name="b71"/> There exist ''n''-vertex Hamiltonian directed graphs with ''n''(''n'' + 1)/2 &minus; 3 edges that are not pancyclic, but every Hamiltonian directed graph with at least ''n''(''n'' + 1)/2 &minus; 1 edges is pancyclic. Additionally, every ''n''-vertex strongly connected graph in which each edge has degree at least ''n'' (counting incoming and outgoing edges together) is either pancyclic or it is a complete bipartite graph.<ref>{{harvtxt|Häggkvist|Thomassen|1976}}.</ref> ==Computational complexity== It is [[NP-complete]] to test whether a graph is pancyclic, even for the special case of [[k-vertex-connected graph|3-connected]] [[cubic graph]]s, and it is also NP-complete to test whether a graph is node-pancyclic, even for the special case of [[polyhedral graph]]s.<ref>{{harvtxt|Li|Corneil|Mendelsohn|2000}}, Theorems 2.3 and 2.4.</ref> ==History== Pancyclicity was first investigated in the context of tournaments by {{harvtxt|Harary|Moser|1966}}, {{harvtxt|Moon|1966}}, and {{harvtxt|Alspach|1967}}. The concept of pancyclicity was named and extended to undirected graphs by {{harvtxt|Bondy|1971}}. ==Notes== {{reflist|2}} ==References== {{refbegin|2}} *{{citation | last = Alspach | first = Brian | issue = 2 | journal = Canadian Mathematical Bulletin | pages = 283–286 | title = Cycles of each length in regular tournaments | url = http://cms.math.ca/cmb/v10/p283 | volume = 10 | year = 1967}}. *{{citation | last1 = Bernhart | first1 = Frank | last2 = Kainen | first2 = Paul C. | doi = 10.1016/0095-8956(79)90021-2 | issue = 3 | journal = [[Journal of Combinatorial Theory]], Series B | pages = 320–331 | title = The book thickness of a graph | volume = 27 | year = 1979}}. *{{citation | last = Bondy | first = J.
