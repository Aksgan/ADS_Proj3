techniques at the molecular, cellular, behavioral, and cognitive levels in brain sciences. Students learn to use cutting-edge experimental techniques ranging from molecular neuroscience to brain imaging technologies including [[EEG]], [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]], high-resolution structural [[MRI]], and [[functional MRI]]. Some of the Ph.D. Graduates are John Jeka, Tom Holroyd, Fred Carver and Walter B.

Scientists currently in the CMB (16 core members) include those interested in a wide range of fundamental questions about how minds are organized. We address these questions using interdisciplinary approaches from social science (anthropology, economics, linguistics, philosophy and psychology), biological science (behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, physiology), engineering science (biomedical and electrical engineering, computer science), and medical science (neurology, psychiatry and medical imaging). The research mission of the CMB includes investigation of a variety of fundamental issues aimed at answering the fundamental question: How does the mind arise from the biology of the brain? Scientists in the CMB study attention, awareness, cognitive control, language, memory, multisensory integration, music cognition, social cognition, and visual cognition from cognitive neuroscience and developmental perspectives in healthy infants and adults, and in special patient populations. The Center for Mind and Brain is located adjacent to the University of California, Davis campus at 267 Cousteau Place (main building) and 202 Cousteau Place (CMB and Developmental Psychology Annex). The CMB and Developmental Psychology Annex includes over {{convert|30000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. of custom designed laboratories, offices and shared facilities that currently houses 16 faculty laboratories. == External links == # {{cite web |title=Homepage |work= UCD Center for Mind and Brain |url=http://mindbrain.ucdavis.edu/ }} {{UC_Davis}} {{Coord|38|33|8|N|121|42|39|W|type:landmark_region:US-CA|display=title}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Center For Mind And Brain}} [[Category:University of California, Davis]] [[Category:Neuroscience research centers]] [[Category:Cognitive science research institutes]] [[Category:Research institutes in the United States]]</text> </page> <page> <id>5737</id> <title>Central Bureau</title> <text>The '''Central Bureau''' was one of two Allied [[Signals intelligence|Sigint]] organisations in the South West Pacific area (SWPA) during WWII. Central Bureau was attached to the HQ of the Allied Commander of the South West Pacific area, [[Douglas MacArthur]]. The other unit was the joint [[Royal Australian Navy|RAN]]/[[United States Navy|USN]] [[Fleet Radio Unit]], [[Melbourne]] ([[FRUMEL]]), which was subordinate to the Commander of the USN [[United States Seventh Fleet|7th Fleet]]. Central Bureau's role was to research and [[Cryptanalysis|decrypt]] intercepted IJA (land and air) traffic and work in close co-operation with other SIGINT centres in the USA, United Kingdom and India [[File:CentralBureau.jpg|thumb|Plaque at 21 Henry St, [[Ascot, Queensland]]]] ==Background== General Douglas MacArthur had his own signals intelligence unit, Station 6, while he was in command in the [[Philippines]] before the War started, and was not fully dependent on the U.S. Navy for that type of information. However, most of the signals intelligence he received was from the Navy unit, [[Station CAST]], originally at Cavite in the [[U.S. Naval Station Sangley Point|Manila Navy Yard]], and evacuated to [[Corregidor]] after Japanese successes. Prior to the war, it had to be sent by courier, which caused some delay and annoyance. General Douglas MacArthur escaped from Corregidor in the Philippines in a PT boat to Mindanao and flew to Australia from Del Monte on a [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]]. He made his way to Melbourne, arriving there on 22 March 1942. The Signals Intelligence units operating in Australia at the time of MacArthur's arrival in Melbourne were as follows: * No. 4 Australian Special Wireless Section at Park Orchards near Ringwood in Melbourne * A small Diplomatic and Press intercept section at Park Orchards * A Diplomatic cryptographic and intelligence section at Victoria Barracks, Melbourne * Some British Army Signals personnel from the [[Far East Combined Bureau]] who had escaped from Java * A small [[Royal Australian Air Force|RAAF]] Intercept section in Darwin * A small RAN intercept and Direction Finding (D/F) organisation * A small RAN cryptographic and intelligence section at the Navy Office in Melbourne and, eventually, after evacuation from Corredigor by submarine, * the personnel of Station CAST, the US Navy SIGNIT group in the Far East One of his first decisions when he arrived in Melbourne was to expand the SIGINT operations already existing in Australia. Some personnel of the United States Navy crypto group in the Philippines, evacuated in early January [[1942]], was operating in Melbourne. They were responsible for channeling all SIGINT information to [[OP-20-G]] in Washington. MacArthur was not happy to depend on the Navy's discretion in handling his SIGINT requirements. He felt he had experienced problems with such an arrangement when he was in [[Manila]]. MacArthur's Intelligence Officer (G-2) was Major General [[Charles A. Willoughby]]. Brigadier-General S. B. Akin, MacArthur's Chief Signals Officer held discussions with Major-General Colin Simpson. They agreed that a Research and Control Centre to handle Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) was needed. MacArthur subsequently issued orders for the formation of two complementary groups: * An Intercept Organisation known initially as No. 5 Wireless Section * A Research and Control Centre known as the Central Bureau. ==Central Bureau's origins== Central Bureau was a joint American-Australian SIGINT organisation, established on 15 April 1942 under the command of Major General S. B. Akin with headquarters based in [[Melbourne]]. General MacArthur advised Washington of his decision in a dispatch on 1 April 1942. He described the role of the group as "the interception and cryptanalyzing of Japanese intelligence". A small group from Australian Naval Intelligence, led
