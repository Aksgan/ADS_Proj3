Institutions were determined to have a special focus with concentrations of at least 80 percent of undergraduate and graduate degrees. In some cases this percentage criterion was relaxed if an institution identified a special focus on the College Board’s Annual Survey of Colleges, or if an institution’s only accreditation was from a body related to the special focus categories." <ref name=BasicTechnical /> *Theological seminaries, Bible colleges, and other faith-related institutions (Spec/Faith) (314) *Medical schools and medical centers (Spec/Medical) (57) *Other health profession schools (Spec/Health) (129) *Schools of engineering (Spec/Engg) (8) *Other technology-related schools (Spec/Tech) (57) *Schools of business and management (Spec/Bus) (64) *Schools of art, music, and design (Spec/Arts) (106) *Schools of law (Spec/Law) (32) *Other special-focus institutions (Spec/Oth) (39) ===Tribal Colleges=== Tribal colleges are members of the [[American Indian Higher Education Consortium]]. *[[Tribal colleges and universities]] (Tribal) (32) ===Not classified=== There were 26 institutions not classified within the Basic Classification. ==Undergraduate Instructional Program== The Undergraduate Instructional Program classification combines (a) the ratio of Arts and sciences and professional fields (as defined in the [http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2002165 Classification of Instructional Programs] (CIP)) and (b) the coexistence of programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels (again using the CIP).<ref name=UIPTechnical>The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005).
