Dvorak]]. [[Ascend Communications]] was their primary sponsor, but a other businesses both inside and outside the computing industry also assumed sponsorship. The awards were given from 1992 through 1997. Although a 1998 ballot was published, finalists were never revealed and the awards were never presented. The abrupt end to the awards has never been officially explained.{{fact|date=December 2010}} [[John C.
