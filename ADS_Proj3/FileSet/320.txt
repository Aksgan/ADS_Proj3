buyer's expected utility ''U'' as a function of his/her bid price ''p'' is equal to the [[consumer surplus]] that the buyer will receive conditional on winning <math>(v - p)</math>, multiplied by the likelihood that he or she is going to be the buyer with the highest bid price. That likelihood is given by the probability that this buyer's bid price ''p'' exceeds the other buyer's bid price ''B'' (expressed as a function of the other buyer's value <math>v_o</math>). Express this probability as <math>Pr\{p > B(v_o)\}</math>. Then, <math>U(p) = (v - p) Pr\{p > B(v_o)\}</math>. Assume that each buyer's equilibrium bid price is monotonically increasing in that buyer's value; this implies that the bid function ''B'' has an [[inverse function]]. Let ''Y'' be the inverse of ''B'': <math>Y=B^{-1}</math>. Then <math>U(p) = (v - p) Pr\{Y(p) > v_o\}</math>. Since <math>v_o</math> is distributed <math>F(v_o)</math>, <math>Pr\{Y(p) > v_o\} = F(Y(p)) = Y(p)</math>, which implies <math>U(p) = (v - p)Y(p)</math>. A bid price p maximizes U if U'(p) = 0. Differentiating U with respect to ''p'' and setting to zero, <math>\,U'(p) = -Y(p) + (v - p)Y'(p) = 0</math>. Since the buyers are symmetric, in equilibrium it must be the case that <math>p = B(v)</math> or (equivalently) <math>Y(p) = v</math>. Therefore <math>\,-Y(p) + (Y(p) - p)Y'(p) = 0</math>. A solution <math>\hat Y</math> of this differential equation is an inverse Nash equilibrium strategy of this game. At this point, one may conjecture that the (unique) solution is the linear function <math>\,\hat Y(p) = ap</math> and <math>\,\hat Y'(p) = a</math> for some real number ''a''. Substituting into <math>\,U'(p) = 0</math>, <math>-ap + (ap - p)a = 0</math> or <math>-p + (a - 1)p = 0</math>. Solving for ''a'' yields <math>\hat a = 2</math>. Therefore <math>\hat Y(p) = 2p</math> satisfies <math>\,U'(p) = 0</math>. <math>\hat Y(p) = \hat a p</math> implies <math>\hat Y(p)/\hat a = p</math>, or <math>v/\hat a = \hat B(v)</math>. Thus, the (unique) Nash equilibrium strategy bidding function of this game is established as <math>\hat B(v) = v/2</math>, at least within the set of invertible bidding functions. Lebrun (1996)<ref>Lebrun, Bernard (1996) "Existence of an equilibrium in first price auctions," Economic Theory, Vol. 7 No. 3, pp. 421-443.</ref> provides a more general proof that an equilibrium exists in a first-price auction when the random valuations of the bidders are independent of each other. ==Revenue Equivalence== One of the major findings of Auction Theory is the celebrated Revenue Equivalence Theorem (first proved by Vickrey in 1961 and generalized 20 years later by Myerson, and independently by Riley and Samuelson.), which states that any allocation mechanism/auction in which (i) the bidder with the highest type/signal/value always wins, (ii) the bidder with the lowest possible type/value/signal expects zero surplus, (iii) all bidders are risk neutral and (iv) all bidders are drawn from a strictly increasing and atomless distribution will lead to the same revenue for the seller (and player i of type v can expect the same surplus across auction types). <ref name=McAffeeandMcMillan>{{cite_journal |last=McAfee|first=, R Preston |coauthors=& [[John McMillan (economist)|John McMillan]]. |year=1987 |title=Auctions and Bidding |journal=Journal of Economic Literature |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages= }}</ref> ==Winner's curse== The [[winner's curse]] is a phenomenon which can occur in ''common value'' settings—when the actual values to the different bidders are unknown but correlated, and the bidders make bidding decisions based on estimated values. In such cases, the winner will tend to be the bidder with the highest estimate, and that winner will frequently have bid too much for the auctioned item. In an equilibrium of such a game, the winner's curse does not occur because the bidders account for the bias in their bidding strategies. Nonetheless, models of such auctions can help identify the winner's curse. ==JEL Classification== In the [[JEL classification codes|Journal of Economic Literature Classification System]] C7 is the classification for Game Theory and D44 is the classification for Auctions.<ref name="JEL">{{cite web | title = Journal of Economic Literature Classification System | publisher = American Economic Association | url = http://aea-web.org/journal/jel_class_system.html | accessdate = 2008-06-25}} (D: Microeconomics, D4: Market Structure and Pricing, D44: Auctions)</ref> ==Footnotes== <references/> ==Further reading== * Cassady, R.
