Some desktop printers also support direct PDF printing, which can interpret PDF data without external help. Currently, all PDF capable printers also support PostScript, but most PostScript printers do not support direct PDF printing.

Portable computers, by their nature, are [[microcomputer]]s. Portable computers, because of their size, are also commonly known as 'Lunchbox' or 'Luggable' computers. They can also be called a 'Portable Workstation' or 'Portable PC'. The principal advantage of a portable computer versus a '''[[laptop]]''' or other '''[[mobile computing|mobile computer]]''' is the use of standard [[Motherboard|motherboards]] or [[backplane]]s providing plug-in slots for add-in cards. This allows mission specific cards such as test, A/D, or communication protocol (IEEE-488, 1553) to be installed. Portable computers also provide for more disk storage by using standard 3-1/2" drives and providing for multiple drives. ==History== [[Xerox NoteTaker]], developed in 1976 at [[Xerox PARC]], was the precursor to portable computers, though it remained a prototype and did not enter production. The first portable computer was manufactured in 1979 by GM Research<ref>[http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/accession/X1243.96 Computer History Museum]</ref>, a small company in Santa Monica, California. The machine which was designed and patented ([http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=4&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=%22portable+computer+enclosure%22.TI.&OS=TTL/%22portable+computer+enclosure%22&RS=TTL/%22portable+computer+enclosure%22 US Patent No. 4,294,496]) by James Murez. It was called the Micro Star and later changed the name to The Small One. Although Xerox claims to have designed the first such system, the machine by Murez predated anything on the market or that had been documented in any publication at the time - hence the patent was issued. As early as 1979 the U.S. Government was contracting to purchase these machines. Other major customers included Sandia Labs, General Dynamics, BBN (featured on the cover of their annual report in 1980 as the C.A.T. system) and several dozen private individuals and companies around the world. In 1979, Osborn viewed the
