Previous 3D games like ''[[Quake III Arena]]'', used separate lighting models for determining how a light would illuminate a character or a [[level (video gaming)|map]]. Lighting and [[shadow]] information for maps would be static, pre-generated and stored, whereas lighting and shadowing information for characters would be determined at run-time. ''Doom 3'' uses a unified model that generates the lighting and shadows for everything at run-time. This means that any lights will affect the whole scene and not only certain parts. This may include [[self-shadowing]] via [[shadow volume]]s, where characters can cast shadows on themselves (for example, the shadow cast by the [[Marine (military)|marine]]'s [[chin]] onto his [[neck]]). == See also == * [[Shadow volume]], a technique for dynamic shadows used in ''Doom 3'' [[Category:Doom (franchise)]] [[Category:Shading]] [[Category:Video game graphics]] [[it:Unified lighting and shadowing]]</text> </page> <page> <id>38800</id> <title>Uniform Driver Interface</title> <text>The '''Uniform Driver Interface''' ('''UDI''') is a defunct project developed by several companies to define a portable interface for [[device driver]]s. The Uniform Driver Interface (UDI) allowed device drivers to be portable across both hardware platforms and [[operating system]]s without any changes to the driver source. With the participation of multiple OS, platform and device hardware vendors, UDI was intended to be the first interface which was likely to achieve such portability on a wide scale. UDI provided an encapsulating environment for drivers with well-defined interfaces which isolated drivers from OS policies and from platform and I/O bus dependencies. In principle, this allowed driver development to be totally independent of OS development. In addition, the UDI architecture was intended to insulate drivers from platform specifics such as byte-ordering, [[Direct memory access|DMA]] implications, multi-processing, interrupt implementations and I/O bus topologies. While UDI could potentially benefit open source operating systems such as [[Linux]] and [[FreeBSD|*BSD]] by providing more driver support from companies, some [[open source]]/[[free software]] advocates feared that UDI would cause a proliferation of closed source drivers and a reduction in open source support by companies, undermining the purpose of the free software and open source movements. [[Richard Stallman]] (the leader of the [[free software movement]]) has claimed that the project does not benefit the free software movement.

Since then 47 States, the [[District of Columbia]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] have adopted it into their own laws. Its overarching purpose is to bring into line the differing State laws over such areas as retention of paper records ([[cheque|checks]] in particular), and the validity of electronic signatures, thereby supporting the validity of electronic contracts as a viable medium of agreement. ==NCCUSL== The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws has worked for the uniformity of state laws since 1892. It is a non-profit unincorporated association, composed of state commissions on uniform laws from each state, the District of Columbia, the [[Commonwealth of Puerto Rico]], and the U.S. Virgin Islands. A list of states that have accepted UETA can be found at [http://www.ncsl.org/programs/lis/CIP/ueta-statutes.htm The National Conference of State Legislatures] and at the [http://www.nccusl.org/Update/uniformact_factsheets/uniformacts-fs-ueta.asp NCCUSL website]. While three states have not adopted UETA, they do have laws recognizing electronic signatures ([[Illinois]], [[New York]], and [[Washington state|Washington]])<ref name="ib1">[http://www.isaacbowman.com/uniform-electronic-transactions-act-ueta ESIGN Laws of The Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA)]; O.C.G.A. Section 12-10-1 et. seq. (codification of Georgia's 2009 enactment of the UETA)</ref>. Before adoption of this Act, most states required banks to retain physical copies of all checks they process. Obviously, keeping these checks in electronic form only would vastly simplify storage and access concerns for banks. UETA aims to rectify this by streamlining and unifying these to laws to allow for electronic retention. In much the same fashion, UETA addresses the need to retain paper copies of other records and contracts, effectively giving legally binding status to electronic documents and signatures. ==Break down of the law== ;Definitions are given in Section 2 namely <ref name="ib2">[http://www.isaacbowman.com/uniform-electronic-transactions-act-ueta ESIGN Laws of The Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA)]</ref>: :''(7)
