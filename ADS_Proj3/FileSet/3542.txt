security, or digitally signed for authentication. The standard security provided by Acrobat PDF consists of two different methods and two different passwords, "user password" and "owner password". A PDF document may be protected by password to open ('user' password) and the document may also specify operations that should be restricted even when the document is decrypted: printing, copying text and graphics out of the document, modifying the document, or adding or modifying text notes and [[Acroforms|AcroForm]] fields (using 'owner' password). However, all operations (except the document open password protection, if applicable) which are restricted by "owner" or "user" passwords are trivially circumvented by many commonly available "PDF cracking" software and even freely online,<ref>[http://freemypdf.com/ FreeMyPDF - A website that removes PDF "user password" restrictions]</ref> and if circumvented these restrictions no longer let the author control what can and cannot be done with the pdf file once distributed. This warning is also displayed when applying such restrictions using Adobe Acrobat software to create or edit PDF files. Even without removing the password, most freeware or open source PDF readers will ignore the [[digital rights management]] "protections" and will allow the user to print or make copy of excerpts of the text as if the document were not limited by password protection. ==== Usage rights ==== Beginning with PDF 1.5, Usage rights (UR) signatures are used to enable additional interactive features that are not available by default in a particular PDF viewer application. The signature is used to validate that the permissions have been granted by a bonafide granting authority. For example, it can be used to allow a user:<ref name="iso32000" /> * to save the PDF document along with modified form and/or annotation data * import form data files in FDF, XFDF and text (CSV/TSV) formats * export form data files in FDF and XFDF formats * submit form data * instantiate new pages from named page templates * apply a [[digital]] [[signature]] to existing [[digital signature]] form field * create, delete, modify, copy, import, export annotations For example, Adobe Systems grants permissions to enable additional features in Adobe Reader, using public-key [[cryptography]]. Adobe Reader will verify that the signature uses a [[Public key certificate|certificate]] from an Adobe-[[authorize]]d certificate authority. The PDF 1.5 specification declares that other PDF viewer applications are free to use this same mechanism for their own purposes.<ref name="iso32000" /> === File attachments === {{Expand section|date=August 2008}} PDF files can have document-level and page-level file attachments, which the reader can access and open or save to their local filesystem. PDF attachments can be added to existing PDF files for example using [http://www.pdfhacks.com/pdftk/ pdftk]. Adobe Reader provides support for attachments, and [[poppler (software)|poppler]] based readers like [[Evince]] or [[Okular]] also have some support for document-level attachments. === Metadata === PDF files can contain two types of metadata.<ref>[http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf Adobe PDF reference version 1.7], section 10.2</ref> The first is the Document Information Dictionary, a set of key/value fields such as author, title, subject, creation and update dates. This is stored in the optional Info trailer of the file. A small set of fields is defined, and can be extended with additional text values if required. Later, in PDF 1.4, support was added for the Metadata Streams, using the [[Extensible Metadata Platform]] (XMP) to add XML standards-based extensible metadata as used in other file formats. This allows metadata to be attached to any stream in the document, such as information about embedded illustrations, as well as the whole document (attaching to the document catalog), using an extensible schema. === Subsets === Proper subsets of PDF have been, or are being, standardized under [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] for several constituencies: * [[PDF/X]] for the printing and graphic arts as ISO 15930 (working in ISO TC130) * [[PDF/A]] for archiving in corporate/government/library/etc environments as ISO 19005 (work done in ISO TC171) * [[PDF/E]] for exchange of engineering drawings (work done in ISO TC171) * [[PDF/UA]] for universally accessible PDF files A [[PDF/H]] variant (PDF for Healthcare) is being developed.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Best Practices Guide Addresses Exchange of Healthcare Information |url=http://www.aiim.org/ResourceCenter/AIIMNews/PressReleases/article.aspx?ID=34318 |date=2006-10-20 |accessdate=2007-03-09 |author=AIIM}}</ref> However, it may consist more of a set of "best practices" than of a specific format or subset. === Mars === :''See also: [[Page description markup language]]'' Adobe is exploring an XML-based next-generation PDF [[code name]]d Mars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gcn.com/blogs/tech/42740.html|title=Adobe plunges PDF into XML|publisher=Government Computer News|date=2006-12-07|accessdate=2008-01-12|first=Joab|last=Jackson}}</ref> Information about the Mars file format is published by Adobe at http://www.adobe.com/go/mars and also [http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Mars http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Mars]. The format of graphic elements of Mars is sometimes described simply as "[[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]]",{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} but according to the version 0.8 draft specification of November 2007 (§3 Mars SVG Support) the format is actually merely similar to SVG: it contains both additions to and subtractions from SVG, so it is in general neither viewable by nor creatable with standard SVG tools: some things will look noticeably different between SVG viewers and Mars viewers. == Technical issues == === Accessibility === PDF files can be created specifically to be accessible for disabled people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webaim.org/techniques/acrobat/ |title=PDF Accessibility |publisher=WebAIM |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alistapart.com/articles/pdf_accessibility |title=Facts and Opinions About PDF Accessibility |author=Joe Clark |date=2005-08-22 |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://wac.osu.edu/pdf/ |title=Accessibility and PDF documents |publisher=Web Accessibility Center |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/accessibility/accessible_pdf.shtml |title=PDF Accessibility Standards v1.2 |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://www.csus.edu/training/handouts/workshops/creating_accessible_pdfs.pdf |format=PDF |title=PDF Accessibility |publisher=California State University |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref> Current PDF file formats can include tags ([[XML]]), text equivalents, captions, audio descriptions, et cetera.
