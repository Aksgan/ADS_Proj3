Balanced accounting was in use by 3000–2350 BCE, and a [[sexagesimal number system]] was in use 2350–2000 BCE.</ref> [[Counting rods]] is one example. The [[abacus]] was early used for arithmetic tasks. What we now call the [[Roman abacus]] was used in [[Babylonia]] as early as 2400 BC. Since then, many other forms of reckoning boards or tables have been invented. In a medieval European [[counting house]], a checkered cloth would be placed on a table, and markers moved around on it according to certain rules, as an aid to calculating sums of money. Several [[analog computer]]s were constructed in ancient and medieval times to perform astronomical calculations. These include the [[Antikythera mechanism]] and the [[astrolabe]] from [[ancient Greece]] (c. 150–100 BC), which are generally regarded as the earliest known mechanical analog computers.<ref>{{harvnb|Lazos|1994}}</ref> Other early versions of mechanical devices used to perform one or another type of calculations include the [[planisphere]] and other mechanical computing devices invented by [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī]] (c. AD 1000); the [[equatorium]] and universal latitude-independent astrolabe by [[Abū Ishāq Ibrāhīm al-Zarqālī]] (c. AD 1015); the astronomical analog computers of other medieval [[Islamic astronomy|Muslim astronomers]] and engineers; and the [[astronomical clock]] [[Clock tower|tower]] of [[Su Song]] (c. AD 1090) during the [[Song Dynasty]].
