A '''ticket punch''' (or '''control nippers''') is a hand tool for permanently marking admission tickets and similar items of paper or card stock. It makes a [[perforation]] and a corresponding [[Chad (paper)|chad]]. A ticket punch resembles a [[hole punch]], differing in that the ticket punch has a longer jaw (or "reach") and the option of having a distinctive die shape. A ticket punch resembles a [[needle punch]] in that it makes a distinctive pattern in the item punched, but differs in that it makes a chad. ==Uses== [[Image:Fahrkarte St Gallen Ravensburg.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Railway passenger ticket punched multiple times, with at least 4 different die shapes: triangle, oval, and two sizes of tear drop]] Ticket punches are widely used to mark railway passenger tickets, particularly if it is important when and where the ticket was punched. Ticket punches were widely used in [[orienteering]] but have been replaced by [[needle punch]]es (see [[Control point (orienteering)|control point in Orienteering]]). Ticket punches also have decorative uses, involving both their perforations and their chads. Available die shapes include many geometric shapes, silhouettes of objects or animals. Die shapes for company logos and other proprietary images can be manufactured by special arrangement. These are used to punch decorative holes in the margins of pieces of paper, and to make small [[confetti]].

The NSA Cyber Defense Tiger Team (Red Cell) is a tiger team that was created by the [[National Security Agency]]<ref>[http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/speeches_testimonies/nsa_videos/cyber_defense_2008.shtml NSA.gov]</ref> 2. Many Tiger Teams are informally constituted through managerial edicts. One of these was set up in NASA circa 1966 to solve the "Apollo Navigation Problem" and it makes an interesting story. The motivation was the discovery that current technology was unable to navigate [[Apollo program|Apollo]] at the level of precision mandated by the mission planners. Tests using radio tracking data from unmanned Lunar Orbiter spacecraft to evaluate circumlunar Apollo navigation were revealing errors of 2000 meters instead of the 200 that the mission required to safely land Apollo when descending from its lunar orbit. For example, Apollo astronauts were practicing landings in safe areas using the simulators at Houston. A tenfold increase in this error-bound implied a hundredfold increase in the target area, which then included unacceptably dangerous terrain. The mission was seriously at risk. This was a navigation problem and so five Tiger Teams were set up to find and correct the problem, one at each NASA center, from CalTech [[JPL]] in the west to Goddard SFC ([[GSFC]]) in the east. The Russians via [[Luna 10]] were also well aware of this problem. There was an intentionally competitive aspect to this strategy, which was "won" by JPL in the spring of 1968 when it was shown that the problem was caused by the unexpectedly large local gravity anomalies on the moon arising from large ringed maria, mountain ranges and craters on the moon. This also led to the construction of the first detailed gravimetric map of a body other than the earth and the discovery of the lunar mass concentrations [[Mass concentration (astronomy)|(Mascons)]].<ref>Paul Muller and William Sjogren (1968). "Mascons: lunar mass concentrations". Science 161 (3842): 680–684. doi:10.1126/science.161.3842.680.

The method is closely related to the [[Linear combination of atomic orbitals molecular orbital method|LCAO method]] used in chemistry. Tight binding models are applied to a wide variety of solids. The model gives good qualitative results in many cases and can be combined with other models that give better results where the tight binding model fails. Though the tight binding model is a one-electron model, the model also provides a basis for more advanced calculations like the calculation of [[surface states]] and application to various kinds of [[many-body problem]] and [[quasiparticle]] calculations. ==Introduction== The name '''"tight binding"''' of this [[Electronic band structure|electronic band structure model]] suggests that this [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical model]] describes the properties of tightly bound electrons in solids. The [[Electron|electrons]] in this model should be tightly bound to the [[atom]] to which they belong and they should have limited interaction with [[Quantum state|states]] and potentials on surrounding atoms of the solid. As a result the [[wave function]] of the electron will be rather similar to the [[atomic orbital]] of the free atom where it belongs to. The energy of the electron will also be rather close to the '''[[ionization energy]]''' of the electron in the free atom or ion because the interaction with potentials and states on neighboring atoms is limited.
