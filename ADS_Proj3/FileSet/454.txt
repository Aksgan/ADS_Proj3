This indicates an [[Error#Telecommunication|error]] in the [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of the signal. [[T-carrier]] and [[E-carrier]] signals are transmitted using a scheme called bipolar encoding, a.k.a. [[Alternate Mark Inversion]] (AMI), where a ONE is represented by a pulse, and a ZERO is represented by no pulse. Pulses (which represent ones) always alternate in polarity, so that if, for example two positive pulses are received in succession, the receiver knows that
