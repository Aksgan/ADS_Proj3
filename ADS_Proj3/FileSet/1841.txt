of [[philosophical logic]], the term '''gunk''' applies to any whole whose parts all have further proper parts. That is, a gunky object is not made of indivisible ''atoms''. In contrast, an ''atomic'' individual is entirely decomposable into atoms. If point-sized objects are always simple, then a gunky object does not have any point-sized parts. By usual accounts of gunk, such as [[Alfred Tarski]]'s in 1929, three-dimensional gunky objects also do not have other degenerate parts shaped like one-dimensional curves or two-dimensional surfaces. (See also ''[[Whitehead's point-free geometry]]''.) Gunk is an important test case for accounts of the composition of material objects: for instance, Ted Sider has challenged [[Peter van Inwagen]]'s account of composition because it is inconsistent with the possibility of gunk. Sider's argument also applies to a simpler view than van Inwagen's: mereological ''nihilism'', the view that only material simples exist. If nihilism is necessarily true, then gunk is impossible. But, as Sider argues, because gunk is both conceivable and possible, nihilism is false, or at best a contingent truth. Gunk has also played an important role in the history of [[topology]] (Zimmerman 1996a) and in recent debates concerning change, contact, and the structure of physical [[space]]. The composition of space and the composition of material objects are related by ''receptacles'' - regions of space that could harbour a material object. (The term receptacles was coined by Richard Cartwright (Cartwright 1975).) It seems reasonable to assume that if space is gunky, a receptacle is gunky and then a material object is possibly gunky. The term was first used by [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] in his work ''Parts of Classes'' (1991) and "Nominalistic Set Theory" (1970). Dean W. Zimmerman defends the possibility of atomless gunk (1996b).

He received a [[Bachelor's degree|BA]] from [[Harvard University|Harvard]] (1975) and an [[Master's degree|MS]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from [[MIT]] in [[Computer Science]] (1977, 1980). He then worked as an [[assistant professor]] of computer science at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and a compiler implementer at [[Tartan Laboratories]]. Next he joined the [[supercomputer]] company [[Thinking Machines]], where he helped to define and promote a parallel version of [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] called [[*Lisp]] (Star Lisp). In 1994, Steele joined [[Sun Microsystems]] and was invited by [[Bill Joy]] to become a member of the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] team after the language had been designed, since he had a track record of writing good specifications for existing languages. He was named a Sun Fellow in 2003. ==Works== While at MIT, Steele published more than two dozen papers with [[Gerald Jay Sussman]] on the subject of the Lisp language and its implementation (the [[Lambda Papers]]). One of their most notable contributions was the design of the programming language [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]]. Steele also designed the original command set of [[Emacs]] and was the first to port [[TeX]] (from [[WAITS]] to [[Incompatible Timesharing System|ITS]]). He has published papers on other subjects, including compilers, parallel processing, and constraint languages. One song he composed has been published in ''Communications of the Association for Computing Machinery'' ([[Communications of the ACM|CACM]]) ("The Telnet Song," April 1984, a parody of the behavior of a series of [[PDP-10]] [[TELNET]] implementations written by [[Mark Crispin]]). Steele has served on accredited standards committees [[ECMA]] TC39 ([[ECMAScript]], for which he was editor of the first edition), [[X3J11]] (the [[C (programming language)|C]] language), and [[X3J3]] (Fortran) and is currently chairman of [[X3J13]] (Common Lisp). He was also a member of the [[IEEE]] working group that produced the IEEE Standard for the Scheme Programming Language, IEEE Std 1178-1990. He represents Sun Microsystems in the High Performance Fortran Forum, which produced the [[High Performance Fortran]] specification in May, 1993. In addition to specifications of the Java programming language, Steele's work at Sun Microsystems has included research
