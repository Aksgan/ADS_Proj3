their equipment. [[WOSA/XFS]], now known as [[CEN/XFS|CEN XFS (or simply XFS)]], provides a common [[API]] for accessing and manipulating the various devices of an ATM. [[J/XFS]] is a Java implementation of the CEN XFS API.<ref>[http://jxfs.net/ J/XFS homepage]</ref> While the perceived benefit of XFS is similar to the Java's [[Write once run anywhere|"Write once, run anywhere"]] mantra, often different ATM hardware vendors have different interpretations of the XFS standard. The result of these differences in interpretation means that ATM applications typically use a [[middleware]] to even out the differences between various platforms. With the onset of Windows operating systems and XFS on ATM's, the software applications have the ability to become more intelligent. This has created a new breed of ATM applications commonly referred to as programmable applications. These types of applications allows for an entirely new host of applications in which the ATM terminal can do more than only communicate with the ATM switch. It is now empowered to connected to other content servers and [[video banking]] systems. Notable ATM software that operates on XFS platforms include Triton PRISM, [[Diebold]] Agilis EmPower, [[NCR Corporation|NCR]] [[NCR Corporation|APTRA Edge]], CR2 BankWorld, KAL Kalignite, Phoenix Interactive VISTAatm, and [[Wincor Nixdorf]] [[Wincor Nixdorf|ProTopas]]. With the move of ATMs to industry-standard computing environments, concern has risen about the integrity of the ATM's software stack.<ref>[http://www.technewsworld.com/story/32350.html "Windows Cash-Machine Worm Generates Concern"] www.technewsworld.com, Jay Lyman, 12/09/03</ref> ==Security== [[Image:49024-SOS-ATM.JPG|thumb|right|A Triton brand ATM with a dip style card reader and a triple DES keypad]] [[Security]], as it relates to ATMs, has several dimensions. ATMs also provide a practical demonstration of a number of security systems and concepts operating together and how various security concerns are dealt with. ===Physical=== [[Image:Procash stolen 1.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Wincor Nixdorf]] Procash 2100xe Frontload that was opened with an [[angle grinder]]]] Early ATM security focused on making the ATMs invulnerable to physical attack; they were effectively safes with dispenser mechanisms. A number of attacks on ATMs resulted, with thieves attempting to steal entire ATMs by [[ram-raiding]].<ref>[http://www.atmmarketplace.com/article.php?id=6736 "An end to ram raids?"]</ref> Since late 1990s, criminal groups operating in Japan improved ram-raiding by stealing and using a truck loaded with a heavy construction machinery to effectively demolish or uproot an entire ATM and any housing to steal its cash.<ref>[http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/internet/inimr-ri.nsf/en/gr114141e.html "STAT-USA Market Research Reports - ATM Thefts"] US [[Economics and Statistics Administration]] report summary via [[Industry Canada]]</ref> Another attack method, [[plofkraak]], is to seal all openings of the ATM with [[silicone]] and fill the vault with a combustible gas or to place an explosive inside, attached, or near the ATM.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,,2-7-1442_2356341,00.html |title=ATM bombings up 3000% |accessdate=2008-07-29 |date=2008-07-12 |publisher=News24}}</ref> This gas or explosive is ignited and the vault is opened or distorted by the force of the resulting explosion and the criminals can break in. Modern ATM physical security, per other modern money-handling security, concentrates on denying the use of the money inside the machine to a thief, by means of techniques such as [[dye marker]]s and [[smoke canister]]s. A common method is to simply rob the staff filling the machine with money. To avoid this, the schedule for filling them is kept secret, varying and random. The money is often kept in cassettes, which will dye the money if incorrectly opened. ===Transactional secrecy and integrity=== The security of ATM transactions relies mostly on the integrity of the secure [[cryptoprocessor]]: the ATM often uses commodity components that are not considered to be "[[trusted system]]s". Encryption of personal information, required by law in many jurisdictions, is used to prevent fraud. Sensitive data in ATM transactions are usually [[encryption|encrypted]] with [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]], but transaction processors now usually require the use of [[Triple DES]].<ref>[http://www.atmmarketplace.com/research.htm?article_id=25059&pavilion=126&step=story "Getting Triple DES compliant"] www.atmmarketplace.com</ref> Remote Key Loading techniques may be used to ensure the secrecy of the initialization of the encryption keys in the ATM. [[Message Authentication Code]] (MAC) or [[Partial MAC]] may also be used to ensure messages have not been tampered with while in transit between the ATM and the financial network. ===Customer identity integrity=== [[Image:Japanese ATM Palm Scanner.jpg|thumb|right|A [[The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ|BTMU]] ATM with a [[palm scanner]] (to the right of the screen)]] There have also been a number of incidents of fraud by [[Man-in-the-middle attack]]s, where criminals have attached fake keypads or card readers to existing machines. These have then been used to record customers' PINs and bank card information in order to gain unauthorized access to their accounts. Various ATM manufacturers have put in place countermeasures to protect the equipment they manufacture from these threats.<ref>[http://www.atmmarketplace.com/article.php?id=7000&na=1 "The No. 1 ATM security concern"] www.atmmarketplace.com</ref><ref>{{PDFlink|[http://buy.cuna.org/download/diebold_fraudpaper.pdf "ATM Fraud And Security White Paper"]|126 KB}} a [[Diebold]] report via [[Credit Union National Association]]</ref> Alternate methods to verify cardholder identities have been tested and deployed in some countries, such as finger and palm vein patterns,<ref>[http://www.ibia.org/biometrics/industrynews_view.asp?id=30 "Japan Seeks To Standardize Biometric ID Method For ATMs"] [[IBIA|International Biometric Industry Association]]</ref> [[Iris recognition|iris]], and [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]] technologies. However, recently, cheaper mass production equipment has been developed and is being installed in machines globally that detect the presence of foreign objects on the front of ATMs, current tests have shown 99% detection success for all types of [[Skimming (credit card fraud)|skimming]] devices.<ref>[http://www.ibia.org/biometrics/industrynews_view.asp?id=103 "Cards: Biometrics Stalled Amid The Hype"] IBIA|International Biometric Industry Association</ref> {{Clear}} ===Device operation integrity=== [[Image:Worn ATM.jpg|thumb|ATMs that are exposed to the outside must be vandal and weather resistant.]] Openings on the customer-side of ATMs are often covered by mechanical shutters to prevent tampering with the mechanisms when they are not in use. Alarm sensors are placed inside the ATM and in ATM servicing areas to alert their operators when doors have been opened by unauthorized personnel. Rules are usually set by the government or ATM operating body that dictate what happens when integrity systems fail. Depending on the jurisdiction, a bank may or may not be liable when an attempt is made to dispense a customer's money from an ATM and the money either gets outside of the ATM's vault, or was exposed in a non-secure fashion, or they are unable to determine the state of the money after
