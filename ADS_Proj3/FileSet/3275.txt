their match percentage, as well as other features, such as age, religion, and location. Some features are not searchable, such as weight. The site also uses a "Quickmatch" feature, which displays user images and information, but not user names, and contacts a member via email if they were "4 or 5-starred". The site notifies a user if both parties gave 4 or 5 stars, in addition to "mutual burns", when both parties give one stars. Users who receive high ratings may be notified by email that they are in the "top half of OkCupid's users." This email states that they "will now see more attractive people in [their] match results", but A-List users can search by star rating as well.<ref>"Attractive User" email</ref> ==History== OkCupid is a service of Humor Rainbow, Inc. OkCupidâ€™s founders (Chris Coyne, [[Christian Rudder]], Sam Yagan and Max Krohn) were students at [[Harvard University]] when they gained recognition for their creation of TheSpark and, later, [[SparkNotes]]. Among other things, TheSpark.com featured a number of humorous self-quizzes and personality tests, including the four-variable [[Myers-Briggs]] style Match Test. SparkMatch debuted as a beta experiment of allowing registered users who had taken the Match Test to search for and contact each other based on their Match Test types. The popularity of SparkMatch took off and it was launched as its own site, later being renamed OkCupid. The current OkCupid Dating Persona Test is still largely identical, in question and text blurb content and order, to the original Match Test. In 2001, they sold SparkMatch to [[Barnes & Noble]], and began work on OkCupid.<ref>[http://www.okcupid.com/about-us.html OkCupid.com: About Us<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 2007, OkCupid launched Crazy Blind Date.<ref name=CrazyBlindDate>[http://www.crazyblinddate.com CrazyBlindDate.com]</ref><ref name=crazyblinddate-okcupid>[http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/06/meet-potential-lovers-over-a-drink-with-crazyblinddate Meet Potential Lovers Over a Drink with CrazyBlindDate - TechCrunch, Nov 06, 2006]</ref> In 2008, OkCupid spun off its test-design portion under the name Hello Quizzy (HQ),<ref name="HQ"/> while keeping it indelibly linked to OkCupid and reserving existent OkCupid users' names on HQ.<ref name=HQ>[http://HelloQuizzy.com Hello Quizzy]</ref> Since August 2009, OkCupid has included an "A-list" account option that provides additional services for a monthly fee.<ref name="OkCupid A-list">[http://www.okcupid.com/upgrade?cf=noads OkCupid.com]</ref> ==See also== * [[List of online dating websites]] * [[Online dating service]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.okcupid.com OkCupid.com] * [http://loveandradio.org/2010/07/love-in-bits/ Interview with OkCupid co-creator Christian Rudder] on alt.NPR's Love & Radio * [http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2007/09/05/digital_man Feature on OkCupid co-creator Sam Yagan], Boston ''Globe'', September 5, 2007 * [http://recomparison.com/comparisons/100526/plenty-of-fish-vs-okcupid-what-is-the-difference/ Difference between OKCupid and Plenty of Fish] * [http://www.onlinepersonalswatch.com/news/2009/09/sam-yagan-ceo-of-okcupid.html Interview with Sam Yagan, CEO of OkCupid], Online Personals Watch, September 2009 {{DEFAULTSORT:Okcupid}} [[Category:Online dating]] [[Category:Social network services]] [[Category:Virtual communities]] [[Category:Multilingual websites]] [[Category:Internet properties established in 2004]] [[de:OkCupid]] [[ru:OkCupid]]</text> </page> <page> <id>27158</id> <title>Old Street Roundabout</title> <text>{{for|the actual London street|Old Street}} {{Cleanup|date=June 2009}} [[File:Old Street Landmark.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Urban sculpture / advertising hording in the centre of Old Street roundabout.
