so we already use <math>\{x_i\}</math> in the place of the control points. If we substitute the solution for <math>f</math>, <math>E_{tps}</math> becomes: :<math> E_{tps}(d,c) = \|Y - Xd - \Phi c\|^2 + \lambda \textrm{trace}(c^T\Phi c) </math> where <math>Y</math> and <math>X</math> are just concatenated versions of the point coordinates <math>y_i</math> and <math>x_i</math>, and <math>\Phi</math> is a <math>(K\times K)</math> matrix formed from the <math>\phi (\|x_i - x_j\|)</math>. Each row of each newly formed matrix comes from one of the original vectors. The matrix <math>\Phi</math> represents the TPS kernel. Loosely speaking, the TPS kernel contains the information about the point-set's internal structural relationships. When it is combined with the warping coefficients <math>c</math>, a non-rigid warping is generated. A nice property of the TPS is that it can always be decomposed into a global affine and a local non-affine component. Consequently, the TPS smoothness term is solely dependent on the non-affine components. This is a desirable property, especially when compared to other splines, since the global pose parameters included in the affine transformation are not penalized. ===Solution=== The separation of the affine and non-affine warping space is done through a [[QR decomposition]] (Wahba,1990). :<math> X = [Q_1 | Q_2] \left( \begin{array}{cc} R \\ 0 \end{array} \right) </math> where Q1 and Q2 are <math>K \times (D+1)</math> and <math>K \times (K-D-1)</math> orthonormal matrices, respectively. The matrix <math>R</math> is upper triangular. With the QR decomposition in place, we have :<math> E_{tps}(\gamma,d) = \|Q_2^T Y - Q_2^T\Phi Q_2 \gamma\|^2 + \|Q_1^T Y -Rd - Q_1^T\Phi Q_2 \gamma\|^2 + \lambda \textrm{trace}( \gamma^T Q_2^T \Phi Q_2 \gamma) </math> where <math>\gamma </math> is a <math>(K-D-1)\times (D+1)</math> matrix. Setting <math>c=Q_2\gamma</math> (which in turn implies that <math>X^T c = 0</math>) enables us to cleanly separate the first term in last third equation into a non-affine term and an affine term (first and second terms last equation respectively). The least-squares energy function in the last equation can be first minimized w.r.t <math>\gamma</math> and then w.r.t. <math>d</math>. By applying [[Tikhonov regularization]] we have :<math> \hat{c} = Q_2(Q_2^T\Phi Q_2 + \lambda I_{(k-D-1)})^{-1}Q_2^T Y </math> :<math> \hat{d} = R^{-1}Q_1^T (Y - \Phi \hat{c}) </math> The minimum value of the TPS energy function obtained at the optimum <math>(\hat{c},\hat{d})</math> is :<math> E_{bending} = \lambda\,\textrm{trace}[Q_2(Q_2^T\Phi Q_2 + \lambda I_{(k-D-1)})^{-1}Q_2^T Y Y^T] </math> ==Application== TPS has been widely used as the non-rigid transformation model in image alignment and shape matching. The popularity of TPS comes from a number of advantages: (1) the interpolation is smooth with derivatives of any order; (2) the model has no free parameters that need manual tuning; (3) it has closed-form solutions for both warping and parameter estimation; and (4) there is a physical explanation for its energy function. ==References== *Haili Chui: Non-Rigid Point Matching: Algorithms, Extensions and Applications.

Ltd., a subsidiary company of [[Haansoft Corporation]], is an [[office suite]] written in [[Java (Sun)|Java]] that runs on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]], and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] platforms. ThinkFree Office includes a [[word processor]] (Write), a [[spreadsheet]] (Calc), a presentation program (Show), and a [[WYSIWYG]] HTML and blog editor (Note). ThinkFree Office reads and writes to [[Microsoft Office]] file formats (.doc, .xls, and .ppt). ThinkFree Office has a [[look and feel]] similar to the prevalent Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint, providing a degree of familiarity to users of those applications. == ThinkFree Online == ThinkFree Online is a web-based edition that runs Write, Calc, Show and Note in a browser using a mix of [[Java applet]] and [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] technologies. It is free to use for a 30 day trial period, except for users in Australia and New Zealand<ref>*Comer, Stuart. [http://www.itwire.com/content/view/15189/127/ "ThinkFree?

A way around this is to click on the already have account button at the start page and then click sign up. Each user is allotted 1 GB of online storage space for saving documents. ThinkFree Online lets users collaborate on documents with others, publish to a blog or the web. ThinkFree Online also keeps a version history per document of the changes that are made. The Java applet version, or Power Edit mode, exists for all three applications, and appears to be an applet port of the original desktop versions written in Java. [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]]-based Quick Edit mode (offered for Write and Show only) can run without the need of starting up an applet. Also, ThinkFree Online supports a synchronization manager utility to keep documents on the desktop, online and mobile workspaces automatically updated. ==ThinkFree
