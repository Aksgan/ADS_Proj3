A less common fantasy involves transformation into a robot. In these ways it is similar to [[agalmatophilia]], which involves attraction to or transformation into [[statue]]s or [[mannequin]]s.<ref name="asfr" /> Robot fetishism can be viewed as a form of erotic [[anthropomorphism]].<ref name="asfr" /> When transformation or roleplaying is involved it can be thought of as a form of [[erotic objectification]].<ref name="asfr" /><ref name="metro">"Let's mech love", by Lisa Scott, [[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|''Metro daily paper'']], 7 February 2007 [http://www.metro.co.uk/metrosexual/article.html?in_article_id=36440 (web page)]</ref> ==A.S.F.R.== By its enthusiasts, robot fetishism is more commonly referred to by the initials ASFR. This initialism stems from the now defunct [[newsgroup]] ''alt.sex.fetish.robots''. Many devotees of this fetish refer to themselves as [[technosexual]],<ref name="metro" /><ref name="bizarre">"Acting Like a Sex Machine", by Kate Hodges, [[Bizarre (magazine)|''Bizarre Magazine'']], October 2004</ref> or as "ASFRians".<ref name="asfr" /> ASFR can be divided into two distinct but sometimes overlapping types of fantasies.<ref name="metro" /><ref name="bizarre" /><ref name="ddiss">"Deviant Desires: Incredibly Strange Sex", by [[Katharine Gates]], Juno Books (October 1999), ISBN 1-890451-03-7 [http://www.deviantdesires.com/map/robots.html (web page)]</ref> The first of these is simply a desire to have a ready-made [[android (robot)|android]] partner. This partner can be desired for sex, companionship, or any combination of the two. The main distinguishing feature of this fantasy is that the android is a completely artificial construct, often manufactured solely to fulfil the wishes of its owner. This type of fantasy or situation is referred to as '''built'''.<ref name="asfr" /><ref name="bizarre" /><ref name="sextv">"Remote Control: Romancing the Robot" (clip only), ''[[SexTV]]'' documentary episode featuring interviews with members of the ASFR community [http://www.sextelevision.net/videoplayer/?segmentID=401&n=1 (streaming video)]</ref> The second type of fantasy prevalent within ASFR is referred to as '''transformation'''. This involves a human who has been either willingly or unwillingly turned into an android. That person can be either oneself or one's partner, or both. It is usually the process of transformation (through whatever means it is achieved) that is the focus of this fantasy.<ref name="asfr" /><ref name="bizarre" /><ref name="sextv" /> Many people in the ASFR community prefer either one or the other.<ref name="metro" /><ref name="bizarre" /><ref name="sextv" /> In some cases this preference is very strong, and people can be as equally repelled by one type as they are attracted to the other. In other cases, there is as much appreciation for built as there is for transformation.<ref name="ddiss" /> A recent informal survey of ASFR community members found that three fifths prefer built while the remainder prefer transformation or some combination of both.<ref name="fc">"Transformation vs. Built Poll", Fembot Central Message Board, Sept. 26, 2006 [http://www.fembotcentral.com/viewtopic.php?t=4722 (web page)]</ref> [[File:Nova BanzaiBaby01.jpg|left|thumb|200px|An example of ASFR art.]] The aspects of this fetish that are most appreciated by members of the ASFR community are greatly varied. For some, things like robotic appearance, motion, or sound are important for arousal.<ref name="metro" /> For others, these are not, and a completely life-like android that appears to be human is desired.<ref name="ddiss" /> This holds true for other aspects, such as [[sentience]] or [[self-awareness]]. The ability of the android to remove parts of its skin or other bodily appendages in order to reveal its circuitry is quite pleasing to some, but distasteful to others.<ref name="ddiss" /> There is a further divide between those who prefer an android to appear human-like and those who would prefer a more mechanical looking robot, i.e. with a metallic surface. As realistic androids and humanoid robots do not currently exist in a form readily available to the consumer,<ref name="metro" /> this fetish can only be acted upon in a limited number of ways. Primarily this is done through fantasy, involving either [[Masturbation|self stimulation]] or [[sexual roleplaying]] with a partner.<ref name="ddiss" /> ASFR art is therefore important to aid in the reinforcement of imagination.<ref name="asfr" /> Art with ASFR content includes but is not limited to [[science fiction]] movies, television shows, novels, short stories, illustrations, [[Digital image editing|manipulated photographs]], songs and even television commercials.<ref name="exotic">"Wrong Turns Down The Sex-Info-Highway 5.07", by Martine Duplessis, ''Exotic Magazine'', 1996 [http://www.xmag.com/archives/5-07-jan98/sexhiway.html (web page)]</ref> Such works are sought after by technosexuals since economically viable androids are not yet available. Realistic [[sex doll]]s such as the [[RealDoll]] remain the only concrete way to fully explore this fetish. However, recent developments in robotics and [[artificial intelligence]], such as those seen in the [[Actroid]] or [[EveR-1]] can only lead to the production of more advanced synthetic partners.<ref name="asfr" /><ref name="metro" /> It is also worth noting that some ASFRians do not wish to use synthetic partners at all, and instead would prefer human partners to participate in forms of fantasy play.<ref name="ddiss" /> ==See also== {{Portal|Robotics}} {{MultiCol}} * [[Actroid]] * [[Agalmatophilia]] * [[Android (robot)|Android]] * [[Doll fetish]] * [[Gynoid]] * [[Humanoid robot]] {{ColBreak}} * [[RealDoll]] * [[Sex doll]] * [[Sexual objectification]] * [[Transformation fetish]] * [[Uncanny valley]] {{EndMultiCol}} ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.p-synd.com/winterrose/technosexuality.html The Technosexuality, Pygmalionist & Mind Control Fetish FAQ 3.0] * [http://www.nat.org/sexbots.pdf Sexually Interactive Autonomous Robots (Friedman and Kubat, M.I.T.)] * [http://sexuality.about.com/od/sexandtechnology/a/david_levy.htm Interview with David Levy, author of ''Robots Unlimited: Life in a Virtual Age''] {{Paraphilia}} {{Sex fetish}} {{Use dmy dates|date=September 2010}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Robot Fetishism}} [[Category:Robotics]] [[Category:Sexual fetishism]] [[Category:Paraphilias]] [[gl:Androidismo]] [[lt:Robotų fetišizmas]] [[simple:Robosexuality]]</text> </page> <page> <id>32306</id> <title>Robot learning</title> <text>'''Robot learning''' is a subset of [[machine learning]] and [[robotics]]. Usually "robot learning" refers to learning to perform tasks such as [[obstacle avoidance]], [[Control engineering|control]] and various other motion-related tasks. While [[machine learning]] is frequently used by [[computer vision]] algorithms employed in the context of robotics, these applications are usually not referred to as "robot learning" Robot learning can be closely related to [[adaptive control]] and [[reinforcement learning]]. == See also == * [[Machine Learning]] * [[Robotics]] * [[Cognitive robotics]] *
