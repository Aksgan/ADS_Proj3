be approximately eliminated by this between receiver differencing. This double difference is: :<math>\begin{align} \Delta^r(\Delta^s(\phi_{1,1,1}))\,&=\,\Delta^r(\phi_{1,2,1} - \phi_{1,1,1}) &=\,\Delta^r(\phi_{1,2,1}) - \Delta^r(\phi_{1,1,1}) &=\,(\phi_{2,2,1} - \phi_{1,2,1}) - (\phi_{2,1,1} - \phi_{1,1,1}) \end{align}</math> Triple differencing can be performed by taking the difference of double differencing performed at time <math>\ \ t_2 </math> with that performed at time <math>\ \ t_1 </math>.<ref>[http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/636.htm Triple differencing]</ref> This will eliminate the ambiguity associated with the integral number of wave lengths in carrier phase provided this ambiguity does not change with time. Thus the triple difference result has eliminated all or practically all clock bias errors and the integer ambiguity. Also errors associated with atmospheric delay and satellite ephemeris have been significantly reduced. This triple difference is: :<math>\ \Delta^t(\Delta^r(\Delta^s(\phi_{1,1,1}))) </math> Triple difference results can be used to estimate unknown variables. For example if the position of receiver 1 is known but the position of receiver 2 unknown, it may be possible to estimate the position of receiver 2 using numerical root finding and [[least squares]]. Triple difference results for three independent time pairs quite possibly will be sufficient to solve for the three components of position of receiver 2. This may require the use of a numerical procedure such as one of those found in the chapter on root finding and nonlinear sets of equations in Numerical Recipes.<ref name="NR">Press (1986), p. 959.</ref> To use such a numerical method, an initial approximation of the position of receiver 2 is required. This initial value could probably be provided by a position approximation based on the navigation message and the intersection of sphere surfaces. Although multidimensional numerical root finding can have problems, this disadvantage may be overcome with this good initial estimate. This procedure using three time pairs and a fairly good initial value followed by iteration will result in one observed triple difference result for receiver 2 position. Greater accuracy may be obtained by processing triple difference results for additional sets of three independent time pairs. This will result in an over determined system with multiple solutions. To get estimates for an over determined system, least squares can be used. The least squares procedure determines the position of receiver 2 which best fits the observed triple difference results for receiver 2 positions under the criterion of minimizing the sum of the squares. == See also == * [[Error analysis for the Global Positioning System]] == Notes == {{reflist}} == References == * {{cite book | author=Press, Flannery, Tekolsky, and Vetterling | year=1986 | title=Numerical Recipes, The Art of Scientific Computing | publisher=Cambridge University Press}} == External links == {{commons|Global Positioning System}} * [http://www.gps.gov/ GPS.gov]—General public education website created by the U.S. Government * U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manual: [http://www.usace.army.mil/publications/eng-manuals/em1110-1-1003/toc.htm NAVSTAR HTML] and [http://www.usace.army.mil/publications/eng-manuals/em1110-1-1003/entire.pdf PDF (22.6 MB, 328 pages)] * [http://pnt.gov/public/docs/2008/spsps2008.pdf GPS SPS Performance Standard]—The official Standard Positioning Service specification (2008 version). * [http://gps.afspc.af.mil/gpsoc/documents/GPS_Signal_Spec.pdf GPS SPS Performance Standard]—The official Standard Positioning Service specification (2001 version). * [http://gps.afspc.af.mil/gpsoc/documents/PPS_PS_Signed_Final_23_Feb_07.pdf GPS PPS Performance Standard]—The official Precise Positioning Service specification. {{Satellite navigation systems}} {{TimeSig}} {{Systems}} {{Orienteering|type=collapsed}} [[Category:Aerospace engineering]] [[Category:Avionics]] [[Category:Command and control]] [[Category:Geodesy]] [[Category:Geographical technology]] [[Category:GPS| ]] [[Category:Missile guidance]] [[Category:Navigation]] [[Category:Navigational equipment]] [[Category:Nuclear command and control]] [[Category:Radio navigation]] [[Category:Surveying]] [[Category:Technology systems]] [[Category:Weapon guidance]] [[Category:Wireless locating]] [[Category:Satellite navigation systems]]</text> </page> <page> <id>14653</id> <title>GQM</title> <text>'''GQM''', the [[acronym]] for "goal, question, metric", is an approach to [[software metric]]s <ref>{{cite web | last = Basili | first = Victor | coauthors = Gianluigi Caldiera, H.

Weiss. Dr. Weiss' work was inspired by the work of Albert Endres at IBM Germany. GQM defines a [[measurement]] model on three levels: ; Conceptual level (goal) : A [[Goal (management)|goal]] is defined for an object for a variety of reasons, with respect to various models of quality, from various points of view and relative to a particular environment. ; Operational level (question) : A set of questions is used to define models of the object of study and then focuses on that object to characterize the assessment or achievement of a specific goal. ; Quantitative level (metric) : A set of metrics, based on the models, is associated with every question in order to answer it in a measurable way. The open literature typically describes GQM in terms of a six-step process where the first three steps are about using business goals to drive the identification of the right metrics and the last three steps are about gathering the measurement data and making effective use of the measurement results to drive [[decision making]] and improvements. Basili described his six-step GQM process as follows: # Develop a set of corporate, division and project business goals and associated measurement goals for [[productivity]] and [[Quality (business)|quality]] # Generate questions (based on models) that define those goals as completely as possible in a quantifiable way # Specify the measures needed to be collected to answer those questions and track process and product conformance to the goals # Develop mechanisms for data collection # Collect, validate and analyze the data in real time to provide feedback to projects for [[corrective action]] # Analyze the data in a post mortem fashion to assess conformance to the goals and to make recommendations for future improvements GQM templates are a structured way of specifying goals <ref>{{cite book | last = Van Solingen | first = Rini | coauthors = Egon Berghout | title = The Goal/Question/Metric Method | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill Education]] | year = 1999 | isbn = 0077095537 | url =http://www.iteva.rug.nl/gqm/GQM%20Guide%20non%20printable.pdf }}</ref>.
