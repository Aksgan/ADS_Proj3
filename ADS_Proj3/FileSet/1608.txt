GIMP is available on many popular operating systems, even so, some variants of GIMP exist for OS-specific modifications. The GIMP website only offers source code downloads; executable version of GIMP are made available by other sources. * ''[[GIMPshop]]'' is a derivative of GIMP that re-arranges the user interface to mimic [[Adobe Photoshop]]. This is achieved by modifying menus and user interface items. GIMPshop is released on Mac OS X, GNU/Linux, Microsoft Windows, and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]]. The project is stagnant and has not been updated since 2006. * ''[[GimPhoto]]'' has a similar aim to GIMPshop, but has been made using a more recent version of GIMP.<ref> {{cite web |author=zenith |title=GimPhoto - free Photoshop alternative for photo and image editor |url=http://www.gimphoto.com/ |publisher=gimphoto.com |accessdate=2 July 2009}} </ref> GimPhoto is targeted toward photographers who have previously used Adobe Photoshop. It is available for both Microsoft Windows and GNU/Linux. * ''GIMP Visual Studio'' (''GIMPVS'') is a derivative of GIMP and GTK+ that is compiled using Microsoft compilers. GIMPVS aims to provide a stable GIMP for artists using Microsoft Windows and allowing developers to program with GTK+ and GIMP using Microsoft Visual Studio.<ref> {{cite web |author=Pierre RF Barthe |title=GIMPVS: GIMP On Windows For Artists And Developers |url=http://gimp-vs.sourceforge.net/ |date=2007-2008 |publisher=GIMP-VS team |accessdate=2 July 2009}} </ref> * ''GIMP Portable'' is a portable version of GIMP that can be installed on a USB hard drive such that brushes and presets are the same from one computer to the next. GIMP Portable is only portable between different computers running Microsoft Windows (XP or later).<ref> {{cite web |author=John T.

It has all the features of the default GIMP distribution. GIMP.app has a version using X11, and a version native to the Mac, but the latter is considered experimental.<ref> {{cite web |title=GIMP.app |url=http://gimp-app.sourceforge.net/ |publisher=GIMP.app team |accessdate=2 July 2009}} </ref> * ''osx-gimp'' provides a [[Macintosh|Mac]] [[PowerPC]]-native beta build of GIMP 2.2.14. It uses GTK+ built for Quartz. It is mostly functional, but support is limited for the Quartz back-end of GTK+.<ref> {{cite web |title=Native GIMP for Mac OS X |url=http://osx-gimp.sourceforge.net/ |publisher=osx-gimp.sourceforge.net/ |accessdate=2 July 2009}} </ref> * ''[[Seashore (software)|Seashore]]'' is a program derived from GIMP running in native Mac OS X. The program is currently in beta and includes a subset of the tools and features in GIMP. * ''[[CinePaint]]'', formerly "Film Gimp", is a [[fork (software development)|fork]] of GIMP version 1.0.4, used for frame-by-frame retouching of feature film. The present version supports up to 32-bit IEEE-floating point [[color depth]] per channel. CinePaint supports color management and [[high dynamic range imaging|HDR]]. CinePaint is used primarily within the [[film industry]] due mainly to its support of high-fidelity image formats{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}.

GAP can save animations in several formats including [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] and AVI.<ref> {{cite web |author=Jakub Steiner |title=Advanced Animations Tutorial |url=http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/Advanced_Animations/ |work=GIMP user manual |publisher=the GIMP documentation team |accessdate=2 July 2009}} </ref> The animation function relies on GIMP's layering capability. Animations are created by placing each image on its own layer (in other words, treating each layer as an animation cel), then then placing and rotating the layers within time constraints. The resulting project can be saved as an animated GIF or encoded video file. GAP also provides programmed layer transitions, timing, and move paths, allowing the creation of sophisticated animations. * ''GIMP Paint Studio'' (''GPS'') is a collection of brushes and accompanying tool presets for GIMP aimed at artists and graphic designers. It speeds up repetitive tasks and allows tool settings to be saved between sessions.<ref name="gps-google-code"> {{cite web |author=christophe|title=The Gimp + GPS (gimp paint studio) |url=http://code.google.com/p/gps-gimp-paint-studio/ |publisher=code.google.com |accessdate=2 July 2009}} </ref> * ''[[Instrumented GIMP]]'' was created at the [[University of Waterloo]] to track and report user interaction with the program to generate statistics about how GIMP is used. ==Mascot== [[File:GIMPLogo.png|thumb|Wilber, the [[mascot]] of GIMP]] The official [[mascot]] of GIMP, Wilber was created by Tuomas Kuosmanen (''tigert'') at some point before 25 September 1997; since then Wilber has received additional accessories from other GIMP developers.<ref name="gimp-linking"> [http://www.gimp.org/about/linking.html GIMP - linking to us].
