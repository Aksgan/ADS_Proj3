Formally, a [[Markov partition]] is used to provide a [[finite cover]] for the smooth system; each set of the cover is associated with a single symbol, and the sequences of symbols result as a trajectory of the system moves from one of the covering sets to another. == History == The idea goes back to [[Jacques Hadamard]]'s 1898 paper on the [[geodesic]]s on [[surface]]s of negative [[curvature]]. It was applied by [[Marston Morse]] in 1921 to the construction of a nonperiodic recurrent geodesic. Related work was done by [[Emil Artin]] in 1924 (for the system now called [[Artin billiard]]), P. J. Myrberg, [[Paul Koebe]], [[Jakob Nielsen (mathematician)|Jakob Nielsen]], [[G. A. Hedlund]]. The first formal treatment was developed by Morse and Hedlund in their 1938 paper. [[George Birkhoff]], Norman Levinson and M. L. Cartwright–[[J. E. Littlewood]] have applied similar methods to qualitative analysis of nonautonomous second order differential equations. [[Claude Shannon]] used symbolic sequences and [[shift of finite type|shifts of finite type]] in his 1948 paper ''[[A mathematical theory of communication]]'' that gave birth to [[information theory]]. The theory was further advanced in the 1960s and 1970s, notably, in the works of [[Steve Smale]] and his school, and of [[Yakov Sinai]] and the Soviet school of [[ergodic theory]]. A spectacular application of the methods of symbolic dynamics is [[Sharkovskii's theorem]] about [[periodic orbit]]s of a continuous map of an interval into itself (1964). ==Examples== Concepts such as [[heteroclinic orbit]]s and [[homoclinic orbit]]s have a particularly simple representation in symbolic dynamics. == Applications == Symbolic dynamics originated as a method to study general dynamical systems; now its techniques and ideas have found significant applications in [[data storage device|data storage]] and [[data transmission|transmission]], [[linear algebra]], the motions of the planets and many other areas. The distinct feature in symbolic dynamics is that time is measured in ''[[discrete time|discrete]]'' intervals. So at each time interval the system is in a particular ''state''. Each state is associated with a symbol and the evolution of the system is described by an infinite [[sequence]] of symbols &mdash; represented effectively as [[String (computer science)|strings]]. If the system states are not inherently discrete, then the [[state vector]] must be discretized, so as to get a [[coarse-grained]] description of the system. ==See also== * [[Measure-preserving dynamical system]] * [[Shift space]] * [[Shift of finite type]] == Further reading == *{{Cite book | last = Hao | first = Bailin | authorlink = Bailin Hao | coauthors = | title = Elementary Symbolic Dynamics and Chaos in Dissipative Systems | publisher = [[World Scientific]] | date = 1989 | location = | pages = | url = http://power.itp.ac.cn/~hao/ | doi = | id = | isbn =9971-50-682-3 }} * Bruce Kitchens, ''Symbolic dynamics.
