for search''', allows website owners to place Google search boxes on their websites. When a user searches the Internet or the website with the search box, Google shares 51% of the advertising revenue it makes from those searches with the website owner.<ref name="10QJul10"/> However the publisher is paid only if the advertisements on the page are clicked; AdSense does not pay publishers for mere searches. ===AdSense for mobile content=== AdSense for mobile content allows publishers to generate earnings from their [[mobile website]]s using targeted Google advertisements. Just like AdSense for content, Google matches advertisements to the content of a website — in this case, a mobile website. ===AdSense for domains=== Adsense for domains allows advertisements to be placed on domain names that have not been developed. This offers domain name owners a way to monetize domain names that are otherwise dormant. Adsense for domains is currently being offered to some users, with plans to make it available to all in stages. On December 12, 2008, ''[[TechCrunch]]'' reported that AdSense for Domains is available for all US publishers.<ref>[http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/12/adsense-for-domains-now-available-for-all-us-publishers/ AdSense For Domains Now Available For All US Publishers], Robin Wauters, Dec 12, 2008, TechCrunch</ref> ===AdSense for video=== AdSense for video allows publishers with video content to generate revenue using ad placements from Google's extensive [[Advertising network]] including popular [[Youtube]] videos.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-05-03/google-s-youtube-boosts-display-advertisers-10-fold-update1-.html | title = Google’s YouTube Boosts Display Advertisers 10-Fold (Update1) | author = Brian Womack | publisher = Bloomberg Businessweek | date = 2010-05-03 | accessdate = 2010-05-03}}</ref> ==XHTML compatibility== As of September 2007, the [[HTML]] code for the AdSense search box does not validate as [[XHTML]], and does not follow modern principles of website design because of its use of * non-standard [[HTML tag|end tags]], such as <code></img></code> and <code></input></code>, * the [[HTML#Attributes|attribute]] <code>checked</code> rather than <code>checked="checked"</code>, * presentational attributes other than <code>id</code>, <code>class</code>, or <code>style</code> — for example, <code>bgcolor</code> and <code>align</code>, * a table structure for purely presentational (i.e., non-tabular) purposes,<sup>1</sup> and * the <code>font</code> tag.<sup>2</sup> <small>1: using a table structure for unintended purposes is strongly discouraged by the [[W3C]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/tables.html|title=Tables|author=W3C|accessdate=2009-10-06}}</ref> but nevertheless does not cause a document to fail validation — there is currently no algorithmic method of determining whether a table is used "correctly" (for displaying tabular data or for displaying elements, that get proportionally wider or narrower when browser window resizes in width without active client side scripting).<br /> 2: the <code>font</code> tag is deprecated but does not fail validation in any XHTML standard{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}.</small> Additionally, the AdSense advertisement units use the JavaScript method <code>document.write()</code>, which does not work correctly when rendered with the <code>application/xhtml+xml</code> [[MIME type]]. The units also use the <code>[[iframe]]</code> HTML tag, which is not validated correctly with the ''XHTML 1.0 Strict'' or ''XHTML 1.0 Transitional'' [[Xhtml#DOCTYPEs|DOCTYPEs]]. The terms of the AdSense program forbid its [[affiliates]] from modifying the code, thus preventing these participants from having valid XHTML websites. However, a workaround has been found by creating a separate HTML webpage containing only the AdSense advertisement units, and then importing this page into an XHTML webpage with an <code>object</code> tag.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cssplay.co.uk/menu/adsense.html|title=Adding AdSense to application/xhtml+xml pages|author=Stu Nicholls|accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref> This workaround appears to be accepted by Google.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200409/content_negotiation_adsense_and_comments/ | title=Content negotiation, AdSense, and comments | author=Roger Johansson | date=2004-09-01| accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref> ==How AdSense works== * The webmaster inserts the AdSense JavaScript code into a webpage. * Each time this page is visited, the JavaScript code uses inlined [[JSON]] to display content fetched from Google's servers. * For [[:Contextual advertising|contextual advertisements]], Google's servers use a [[cache]] of the page to determine a set of high-value [[Keyword (Internet search)|keywords]]. If keywords have been cached already, advertisements are served for those keywords based on the AdWords bidding system.

To protect against this type of fraud, AdSense customers can specify the pages on which advertisements should be shown. AdSense then ignores clicks from pages other than those specified. ==Abuse== Some webmasters create websites tailored to lure searchers from Google and other engines onto their AdSense website to make money from clicks. These "zombie" websites often contain nothing but a large amount of interconnected, automated content (e.g., a directory with content from the [[Open Directory Project]], or [[scraper site|scraper websites]] relying on RSS feeds for content). Possibly the most popular form of such "AdSense farms" are [[splog]]s (spam blogs), which are centered around known high-paying keywords. Many of these websites use content from other websites, such as [[Wikipedia]], to attract visitors. These and related approaches are considered to be search engine [[Spam (electronic)|spam]] and can be reported to Google. {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} A [[Scraper site#Made for AdSense|Made for AdSense]] (MFA) website or webpage has little or no content, but is filled with advertisements so that users have no choice but to click on advertisements.
