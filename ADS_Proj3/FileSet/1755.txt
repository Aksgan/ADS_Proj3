the best player of his generation was given the prestigious title [[Meijin]] (master) and the post of [[Godokoro]] (minister of Go). Of special note are the players who were dubbed [[Kisei]] (Go Sage).

Top players from this period often played newspaper-sponsored matches of 2–10 games.<ref name=newspaper>{{Citation | url = http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/orient/go/history/newspaper.html | title = History of Newspaper Go | last = Fairbairn | first = John | accessdate = 2007-06-14}}</ref> Of special note are [[Go Seigen]] (Chinese: Wu Qingyuan), who scored an impressive 80% in these matches,<ref>{{Citation | publisher = GoBase.org | url = http://gobase.org/games/china/misc/disks/matches.html | title = Go Seigen: Match Player | accessdate = June 14, 2007}}</ref> and [[Minoru Kitani]], who dominated matches in the early 1930s.<ref>{{Citation | last = Fairbairn | first = John | url = http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/orient/go/history/newspaper.html#kitani | title = Kitani's Streak | accessdate = 2007-06-14}}</ref> These two players are also recognized for their groundbreaking work on new [[Go opening theory|opening theory]] ([[Shinfuseki]]).<ref name=ShinFuseki>{{Citation | url = http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/orient/go/history/kubomatsu.html | first = John | last = Fairbairn | title = Kubomatsu's central thesis | accessdate = 2008-01-17 }}</ref> For much of the 20th century, Go continued to be dominated by players trained in Japan. Notable names included [[Eio Sakata]], [[Rin Kaiho]] (born in China), [[Masao Kato]], [[Koichi Kobayashi]] and [[Cho Chikun]] (born Cho Ch'i-hun, South Korea).<ref>{{Citation | publisher = GoBase.org | url = http://gobase.org/games/jp/ | title = List of Japanese titles, prizemoney and winners | accessdate = 2008-06-11}}</ref> Top Chinese and Korean talents often moved to Japan, because the level of play there was high and funding was more lavish. One of the first Korean players to do so was [[Cho Namchul]], who studied in the [[Kitani Dojo]] 1937–1944. After his return to Korea, the [[Hanguk Kiwon]] (Korea Baduk Association) was formed and caused the level of play in South Korea to rise significantly in the second half of the 20th century.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.usgo.org/news/index.php?%23_id=102 | title = KBA Founder Cho Nam Chul passes | first = Janice | last = Kim | publisher = American Go Association | accessdate = 2008-06-11}}</ref> In China, the game declined during the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966–1976) but quickly recovered in the last quarter of the 20th century, bringing Chinese players, such as [[Nie Weiping]] and [[Ma Xiaochun]], on par with their Japanese and Korean counterparts.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.societies.cam.ac.uk/cugos/tesuji/weiqi_chinese_culture.html | title = Weiqi in Chinese Culture | last = Matthews | first = Charles | accessdate = 2007-06-04}}</ref> [[Image:Changho-Dinerchtein.jpg|thumb|right|Korean player [[Lee Chang-ho]], considered by many to be the best player of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, plays against Russian player [[Alexandre Dinerchtein]], seven-time European Champion and one of the few Western players to reach [[Go professional|professional]] status.]] With the advent of major international titles from 1989 onward, it became possible to compare the level of players from different countries more accurately. Korean players such as [[Lee Chang-ho]], [[Cho Hunhyun]], [[Lee Sedol]] and [[Yoo Changhyuk]] dominated international Go and won an impressive number of titles.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = GoBase.org | url = http://gobase.org/games/nn/ | title = List of International titles, prizemoney and winners | accessdate = 2008-06-11}}</ref> Several Chinese players also rose to the top in international Go, most notably [[Ma Xiaochun]], [[Chang Hao]] and [[Gu Li]]. {{As of|2008}}, Japan lags behind in the international Go scene. Historically, as with most sports and games, more men than women have played Go. Special tournaments for women exist, but until recently, men and women did not compete together at the highest levels; however, the creation of new, open tournaments and the rise of strong female players, most notably [[Rui Naiwei]], have in recent years highlighted the strength and competitiveness of emerging female players.<ref>{{citation | first = Peter | last = Shotwell | title = Go!

Larger issues, not limited to only part of the board, are referred to as ''strategy'', and are covered in their own section. ===Capturing tactics=== There are several tactical constructs aimed at capturing stones.<ref>Kim 1994 pp.
