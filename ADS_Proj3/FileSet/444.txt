Assembly of the [[human genome]] is one of the greatest achievements of bioinformatics.]] '''Bioinformatics''' is the application of [[statistics]] and [[computer science]] to the field of [[molecular biology]]. The term ''bioinformatics'' was coined by [[Paulien Hogeweg]] and Ben Hesper in 1978 for the study of informatic processes in biotic systems<ref>Hogeweg, P. (1978). Simulating the growth of cellular forms. Simulation 31, 90-96; Hogeweg, P. and Hesper, B. (1978) Interactive instruction on population interactions. Comput Biol Med 8:319-27.</ref>. Its primary use since at least the late 1980s has been in genomics and genetics, particularly in those areas of genomics involving large-scale [[DNA sequencing]]. Bioinformatics now entails the creation and advancement of databases, algorithms, computational and statistical techniques and theory to solve formal and practical problems arising from the management and analysis of biological data. Over the past few decades rapid developments in genomic and other molecular research technologies and developments in information technologies have combined to produce a tremendous amount of information related to molecular biology. It is the name given to these mathematical and computing approaches used to glean understanding of biological processes. Common activities in bioinformatics include mapping and analyzing [[DNA]] and protein sequences, aligning different DNA and protein sequences to compare them and creating and viewing 3-D models of protein structures. The primary goal of bioinformatics is to increase the understanding of biological processes. What sets it apart from other approaches, however, is its focus on developing and applying computationally intensive techniques (e.g., [[pattern recognition]], [[data mining]], [[machine learning]] algorithms, and [[Biological Data Visualization|visualization]]) to achieve this goal. Major research efforts in the field include [[sequence alignment]], [[gene finding]], [[genome assembly]], [[drug design]], [[drug discovery]], [[protein structural alignment|protein structure alignment]], [[protein structure prediction]], prediction of [[gene expression]] and [[protein-protein interactions]], [[genome-wide association studies]] and the modeling of [[evolution]]. ==Introduction== Bioinformatics was applied in the creation and maintenance of a database to store biological information at the beginning of the "genomic revolution", such as nucleotide and amino acid sequences. Development of this type of database involved not only design issues but the development of complex interfaces whereby researchers could both access existing data as well as submit new or revised data. In order to study how normal cellular activities are altered in different disease states, the biological data must be combined to form a comprehensive picture of these activities. Therefore, the field of bioinformatics has evolved such that the most pressing task now involves the analysis and interpretation of various types of data, including nucleotide and amino acid sequences, protein domains, and protein structures. The actual process of analyzing and interpreting data is referred to as computational biology. Important sub-disciplines within bioinformatics and computational biology include: * the development and implementation of tools that enable efficient access to, and use and management of, various types of information. * the development of new algorithms (mathematical formulas) and statistics with which to assess relationships among members of large data sets, such as methods to locate a gene within a sequence, predict protein structure and/or function, and cluster protein sequences into families of related sequences. There are two fundamental ways of modelling a Biological system (e.g. living cell) both coming under Bioinformatic approaches. *Static **Sequences - Proteins, Nucleic acids and Peptides **Structures - Proteins, Nucleic acids, Ligands (including metabolites and drugs) and Peptides **Interaction data among the above entities including microarray data and Networks of proteins, metabolites *Dynamic **Systems Biology comes under this category including reaction fluxes and variable concentrations of metabolites **Multi-Agent Based modelling approaches capturing cellular events such as signalling, transcription and reaction dynamics A broad sub-category under bioinformatics is [[structural bioinformatics]]. ==Major research areas== ===Sequence analysis=== {{main|Sequence alignment|Sequence database}} Since the [[Phi X 174|Phage Φ-X174]] was [[sequencing|sequenced]] in 1977<ref name="pmid870828">{{cite journal |author=Sanger F, Air GM, Barrell BG, Brown NL, Coulson AR, Fiddes CA, Hutchison CA, Slocombe PM, Smith M |title=Nucleotide sequence of bacteriophage phi X174 DNA |journal=Nature |volume=265 |issue=5596 |pages=687–95 |year=1977 |month=February |pmid=870828 |doi= |url=}}</ref>, the [[DNA sequence]]s of thousands of organisms have been decoded and stored in databases. This sequence information is analyzed to determine genes that encode [[polypeptides]] ([[proteins]]), RNA genes, regulatory sequences, structural motifs, and repetitive sequences. A comparison of genes within a [[species]] or between different species can show similarities between protein functions, or relations between species (the use of [[molecular systematics]] to construct [[phylogenetic tree]]s). With the growing amount of data, it long ago became impractical to analyze DNA sequences manually. Today, [[computer program]]s such as [[BLAST]] are used daily to search sequences from more than 260 000 organisms, containing over 190 billion [[nucleotides]]<ref name="pmid18073190">{{cite journal |author=Benson DA, Karsch-Mizrachi I, Lipman DJ, Ostell J, Wheeler DL |title=GenBank |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=36 |issue=Database issue |pages=D25–30 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18073190 |pmc=2238942 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkm929 |url=}}</ref>. These programs can compensate for mutations (exchanged, deleted or inserted bases) in the DNA sequence, in order to identify sequences that are related, but not identical. A variant of this [[sequence alignment]] is used in the sequencing process itself. The so-called [[shotgun sequencing]] technique (which was used, for example, by [[The Institute for Genomic Research]] to sequence the first bacterial genome, ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]''<ref name="pmid7542800">{{cite journal |author=Fleischmann RD, Adams MD, White O, Clayton RA, Kirkness EF, Kerlavage AR, Bult CJ, Tomb JF, Dougherty BA, Merrick JM |title=Whole-genome random sequencing and assembly of Haemophilus influenzae Rd |journal=Science |volume=269 |issue=5223 |pages=496–512 |year=1995 |month=July |pmid=7542800 |doi= |url=}}</ref>) does not produce entire chromosomes, but instead generates the sequences of many thousands of small DNA fragments (ranging from 35 to 900 nucleotides long, depending on the sequencing technology). The ends of these fragments overlap and, when aligned properly by a genome assembly program, can be used to reconstruct the complete genome. Shotgun sequencing yields sequence data quickly, but the task of assembling the fragments can be quite complicated for larger genomes. For a genome as large as the [[human genome]], it may take
