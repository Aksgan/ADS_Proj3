Although this was its primary business for years, its place in videogame folklore was cemented by its ambitious and ultimately ill-fated plans to release its own [[video game console]], the '''Konix Multisystem'''. ==Background== The '''Konix Multisystem''' began life in 1988 as an advanced Konix peripheral design intended to build on the success of the company's range of joysticks. The design, codenamed Slipstream, resembled a dashboard-style games controller, and could be configured with a steering wheel, a flight yoke, and motorbike handles. It promised advanced features such as [[Haptic technology|force feedback]], hitherto unheard of in home gaming. However, it soon became apparent that the Slipstream project had the potential to be much more than a peripheral. Konix turned to their sister company Creative Devices Ltd, a computer hardware developer, to design a gaming computer to be put inside the controller to make it a stand-alone console in its own right. It was shortly after this development began that Konix founder and chairman Wyn Holloway came across a magazine article that described the work of a British group of computer hardware designers whose latest design was looking for a home.<ref name="hist">{{cite|author=Graeme Kidd & Simon Goodwin|title=February 1989 issue of ACE Magazine|publisher=[[Future Publishing]]}}</ref> The article in question, published in issue 10 of [[ACE (games magazine)|ACE Magazine]] in July 1988, featured [[Flare Technology]], a group of computer hardware designers who, having split from [[Sinclair Research|Sinclair]], had built on their work on Sinclair's aborted [[Loki (computer)|Loki]] project to create a system known as Flare One. Flare's [[prototype]] system was [[Zilog Z80|Z80]] based but featured four custom [[Integrated circuit|chips]] to give it the power to compete with peers such as the [[Commodore Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]]. The 1MB machine (128k of ROM, 128k of video RAM, 768k of system RAM) promised graphics with 256 colours on-screen simultaneously, could handle 3 million pixels per second, output 8 channel stereo and had a blitter chip that allowed vertical and horizontal hardware scrolling.<ref>{{cite|author=Steve Cooke|title=July 1988 issue of ACE Magazine|publisher=Future Publishing}}</ref> Flare were specifically aiming their machine at the gaming market, eschewing such features as 80 column text display (considered the requisite for business applications such as [[word processing]]) in favour of faster graphics handling. This meant that in spite of its modest [[8-bit]] [[CPU]] the system compared well against the [[16-bit]] machines in the market at the time. It could move sprites and block graphics faster than an Atari ST, and in 256 colours under conditions when the ST would only show 16 colours. It could also draw lines 3 times faster than an Amiga and even handle the maths of 3D models faster than the [[32-bit]] [[Acorn Archimedes]]. In spite of these specifications and bearing in mind their target gaming market, Flare aimed to retail their machine for around £200, half of what the Amiga and ST were selling for. However they lacked the resources to put it into mass production.<ref>{{cite|author=Andy Wilton|title=August 1988 issue of ACE Magazine|publisher=Future Publishing}}</ref> ==Development== Holloway approached Flare and proposed a merger of their respective technologies to create an innovative new kind of gaming console with the computer hardware built into the main controller and in July 1988 a partnership was formed.<ref name="hist" /> Development work was carried out by Flare, with assistance from British games programmer [[Jeff Minter]]. Konix wanted the machine to use a 16-bit processor, so the Z80 was removed and replaced with an [[8086]] processor. They also demanded that the colour palette be expanded to 4096 colours, the same as that of the Amiga. To reduce manufacturing costs, the Flare One's four custom chips were integrated into one large chip. In order to keep the cost of software down, it was decided that the software media would be 3.5” [[floppy disc]]s rather than ROM cartridges used universally by consoles up to that time. The embryonic console was revealed to the computing press at a toy fair held at [[Earl's Court]] in February 1989. It boasted market leading performance, [[MIDI]] support and revolutionary peripherals including a [[light gun]] with [[recoil]] action and the Power Chair, a [[Electric motor|motorised]] seat designed to ape in the home what “sit-in” arcade games such as [[After burner]] and [[Out Run]] delivered in the [[Video arcade|arcades]] using [[hydraulics]]. Another innovative feature was the ability to link 2 MultiSystems together to allow for head-to-head two player gaming.<ref name="specs">{{cite|author=Richard Monteiro|title=March 1989 issue of ACE Magazine|publisher=Future Publishing}}</ref> Release was slated for August that year.<ref name="hist" /> ==Specifications== *CPU: 16-bit 8086 processor (running at 6 MHz)<ref name="specs" /> *Co-processor: [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] processor *RAM: 256KB (in later versions upgraded to 512K) *Graphics: **Custom [[blitter]] **4096 colour palette **Resolutions: ***256x200 (256 colours) ***512x200 (16 colours) ***256x200 (16 colours) *Sound:
