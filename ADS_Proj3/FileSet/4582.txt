a microscope. A tiny 'plant' on a [[microscope slide]] makes for a poor type: the microscope slide may be lost or damaged, or it may be very difficult to find the 'plant' in question among whatever else is on the microscope slide. An illustration makes for a much more reliable type (Art 37.5 of the ''Vienna Code'', 2006). Note that a type only fixes a name to a single representative of the taxon. A type does not determine the circumscription (therefore a taxon is independent of its type species or specimen) of the taxon. For example, the common [[dandelion]] is a controversial taxon: some botanists consider it to consist of over a hundred species, although most botanists regard it to be a single species. The type of the name ''Taraxacum officinale'' is the same whether the circumscription of the species includes all those small species (''Taraxacum officinale'' is a 'big' species) or whether the circumscription is limited to only one small species among the other hundred (''Taraxacum officinale'' is a 'small' species). In this case the name ''Taraxacum officinale'' is the same and the type of the name is the same, but the extent of what the name actually applies to varies strongly. Setting the circumscription of a taxon is done by a taxonomist in a publication. Miscellaneous notes: # Usually, only a species or an [[infraspecific taxon]] can have a type of its own. For a new taxon (published on or after 1 January 1958) at these ranks a type should not be an illustration. # A genus (almost always) has the same type as that of one of its species. Because the mere name of the species is considered equivalent to that species' type, this species is frequently called the ''[[type species]]'', a phrase that has no standing under the ''[[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature|ICBN]]''. # A family has the same type as that of one of its genera (that is, almost always the type of a species). The term [[type genus]] for the same reason "type species" is. # The ''ICBN'' provides a listing of the various kinds of type in [http://www.bgbm.fu-berlin.de/iapt/nomenclature/code/SaintLouis/0013Ch2Sec2a009.htm Art 9], the most important of which is the [[holotype]]. Note that the word "type" appears in botanical literature as a part of several terms that have no status under the ''ICBN'': for example a clonotype, an [[herbarium]] specimen vegetatively propagated from (and thus a [[Cloning|clone]] of) the same plant from which a type specimen was made that is used for documenting the type collection. == Types in zoology == In [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|zoological nomenclature]], the '''type''' of a species (or subspecies) is a specimen (or series of specimens), the type of a genus (or subgenus) is a species, and the type of a suprageneric taxon (e.g., family, etc.) is a genus. Names higher than superfamily rank do not have types. A "[[name-bearing type]]" "provides the objective standard of reference whereby the application of the name of a nominal taxon can be determined." === Definitions === * A '''type specimen''' is a vernacular term (not a formally defined term) typically used for an individual or fossil that is any of the various name-bearing types for a [[species]]. For example, the type specimen for the species ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]'' was the specimen "Neanderthal-1" discovered by [[Johann Karl Fuhlrott]] in 1856 at Feldhofer in the Neander Valley in Germany, consisting of a [[skullcap]], thigh bones, part of a pelvis, some ribs, and some arm and shoulder bones. There may be more than one type specimen, but there is (at least in modern times) only one [[holotype]]. * A '''type species''' is the nominal species that is the name-bearing type of a nominal [[genus]] or [[subgenus]]. * A '''type genus''' is the nominal genus that is the name-bearing type of a nominal family-group taxon. * The '''type series''' are all those specimens included by the author in a taxon's formal description, unless the author explicitly or implicitly excludes them as part of the series. === Use of types === Although in reality biologists may examine many specimens (when available) of a new taxon before writing an official published species description, nonetheless, under the formal rules for naming species (the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]), a single '''type''' must be designated, as part of the published description. When a single specimen is clearly designated in the original description, this specimen is known as the '''[[holotype]]''' of that species. The holotype is typically placed in a major museum, or similar well-known public collection, so that it is freely available for later examination by other biologists. Type illustrations have also been used by zoologists, as in the case of the [[Réunion Parakeet‎]], which is only known from historical illustrations and descriptions.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hume|first1=Julian Pender|title=Reappraisal of the parrots (Aves: Psittacidae) from the Mascarene Islands, with comments on their ecology, morphology, and affinities|url=http://julianhume.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Hume-Mascarene-Parrots.pdf|journal=Zootaxa|date=25 June 2007|accessdate=13 January 2011|ISSN=1175-5334|issue=1513|pages=1–76}}</ref>{{rp|24}} A type description must include a '''diagnosis''' (typically, a discussion of similarities to and differences from closely related species), and an indication of where the type specimen or specimens are deposited for examination. The geographical location where a type specimen was originally found is known as its '''{{visible anchor|type locality}}'''. In the case of parasites, the term '''type host''' (or '''symbiotype''') is used to indicate the host organism from which the type specimen was obtained.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/3283335|title=Designation and Curatorial Management of Type Host Specimens (Symbiotypes) for New Parasite Species|url=http://jstor.org/stable/3283335|author= Jennifer K.

Ensuring that types are kept in good condition and made available for examination by taxonomists are two important functions of such collections. And, while there is only one ''holotype'' designated, there can be other "type" specimens, the following of which are formally defined: * '''[[Paratype]]''' &ndash; Any additional specimen other than the holotype, listed in the type series, where the original description designated a holotype. These are not
