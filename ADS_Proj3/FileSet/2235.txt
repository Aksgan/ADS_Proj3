John will know Tom got the message. Tom knows John got the message. But, both Tom and John have no clue that Gordon got the message as well.</ref> Private messages are generally used for personal conversations. They can also be used with tripcodesâ€”a message is addressed to a public trip and can be picked up by typing in the tripcode. ===Attachment=== An attachment can be almost any file. When someone attaches a file to a post they are uploading the file to the forums' server. Forums usually have very strict limit on what can be attached and what cannot (among which the size of the files in question). Attachments can be part of a thread, social group, etc. ===BBCode and HTML=== {{Main|BBCode}} [[HTML|HyperText Markup Language]] (HTML) is sometimes allowed but usually its use is discouraged or when allowed it is extensively filtered. Modern bulletin board systems will have it disabled altogether or allow only Administrators use it, as allowing it on any Normal User level is considered a security risk due to a high rate of [[XSS]] vulnerabilities. When HTML is disabled [[BBCode|Bulletin Board Code]] (BBCode) is the most common preferred alternative. BBCode usually consists of a tag, similar to HTML only instead of <code><</code> and <code>></code> the tagname is enclosed within square brackets (meaning: <code>[</code> and <code>]</code>). Commonly <code>[i]</code> is used for [[italic type]], <code>[b]</code> is used for [[Emphasis (typography)|bold]], <code>[u]</code> for [[underline]], <code>[color="value"]</code> for color and <code>[list]</code> for lists, as well as <code>[img]</code> for images and <code>[url]</code> for links. The following example BBCode: <code>[b]This[/b] is [i]clever[/i] [b] [i]text[/i] [/b]</code> when the post is viewed the code is rendered to HTML and will appear as: '''This''' is ''clever'' '''''text'''''. Many forum packages offer a way to create Custom BBCodes, or BBcodes that are not built into the package, where the Administrator of the Board can create complex BBCodes to allow the use of javascript or iframe functions in posts, for example embedding a YouTube or Google Video complete with viewer directly into a post. ===Emoticon=== {{Main|Emoticon}} [[Emoticon]] or ''smiley'' is a symbol or combination of symbols used to convey emotional content in written or message form. Forums implement a system through which some of the text representations of an emoticons (e.g. <code>XD</code>, <code>:p</code>) are rendered as a small image. Depending on part the world the forum's topic originates (since most forums are international) smilies can be replaced by other forms of similar graphics, an example would be [[kaoani]] (e.g. <code>*(^O^)*</code>, <code>(^-^)b</code>). ===Poll=== Most forums implement an [[opinion poll]] system for threads. Most implementations allow for single-choice or multi-choice (sometimes limited to a certain number) when selecting options as well as private or public display of voters. Polls can be set to expire after a certain date or in some cases after a number of days from its creation. Members vote in a poll and a statistic is displayed graphically. ===RSS and ATOM=== {{Main|Web feed}} [[RSS]] and [[ATOM]] feeds allow a minimalistic means of subscribing to the forum. Common implementations only allow RSS feeds listing the last few threads updated for the forum index and the last posts in a thread. ===Other forum features=== An ''ignore list'' allows members to hide posts of other members that they do not want to see or have a problem with. In most implementations they are referred to as ''foe list'' or ''ignore list''. Usually the posts are not hidden, but minimized with only a small bar indicating a post from the user on the ''ignore list'' is there.<ref name="vBFAQDTU" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phpbb.com/community/faq.php?#f61 |title=PhpBB FAQ: How can I add / remove users to my Friends or Foes list? |publisher=PhpBB.com |accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref> Almost all internet forums include a ''member list'', which allows display of all forum members, with integrated search feature. Some forums will not list members with 0 posts, even if they have activated their accounts. Many forums allow users to give themselves an ''avatar''. An avatar is a image that appears beside all of a user's posts, in order to make the user more recognizable. The user may upload the image to the forum database, or may provide a link to an image on a separate website. Each forum has limits on the height, width, and data size of avatars that may be used; if the user tries to use an avatar that is too big, it may be scaled down or rejected. Similarly, most forums allow users to define a ''signature'' (sometimes called a ''sig''), which is a block of text, possibly with BBCode, which appears at the bottom of all of the user's posts. There is a character limit on signatures, though it may be so high that it is rarely hit. Often the forum's moderators impose manual rules on signatures to prevent them from being obnoxious (for example, being extremely long or having flashing images), and issue warnings or bans to users who break these rules. Like avatars, signatures may improve the recognizability of a poster. They may also allow the user to attach information to all of their posts, such as proclaiming support for a cause, noting facts about themselves, or quoting humorous things that have previously been said on the forum. Common on forums, a ''subscription'' is a form of automated notification integrated into the software of most forums. It usually notifies either by email or on the site when the member returns. The option to subscribe is available for every thread while logged in. Subscriptions work with ''read marking'', namely the property of ''unread'' which is given to the content never served to the user by the software. Recent development in some popular implementations of forum software has brought ''social network features and functionality''. Such features include personal galleries, pages as well as a social network like [[Online chat|chat]] systems. Most forum software is now fully customizable with "hacks" or "modifications" readily available to customize your forum to yours and your members needs. ==Comparison with other Web applications== One significant difference between forums and [[electronic mailing list]]s is
