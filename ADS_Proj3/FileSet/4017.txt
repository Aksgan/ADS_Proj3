it uses software or hardware floating point (code using hardware floating point is actually slower because the hardware doesn't support it, so those instructions cause an exception which then has to be handled by the kernel, with noticeable overhead). == Non-Linux OSes == There is a port of [[OpenBSD]] for several Zaurus models.<ref>[http://www.openbsd.org/zaurus.html OpenBSD/zaurus]</ref> The port is available on the SL-C3000, SL-C3100, and SL-C3200 with development continuing in order to expand support to the C860 and C1000. This port of OpenBSD does not however replace the original operating system entirely, nor is it made available as a ROM image, instead it uses the original Linux install as a bootloader and installs the same as OpenBSD would on any other platform. There is also a [[NetBSD]] port is in development, based on the work from OpenBSD.<ref>NetBSD/zaurus boots into multi-user mode now: [http://mail-index.netbsd.org/port-arm/2006/11/19/0000.html dmesg].</ref> == Software == [[Image:Zaurus SL-C1000 screen with browser window.jpg|thumb|160px|right|SL-C1000 screen with [[NetFront]] Browser on Qtopia desktop (converted to English)]] With the switch to the Linux operating system the Zaurus became capable of running variations of a wide variety of proprietary and [[open source]] software, including web and [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] servers, [[database]]s, and [[compiler]]s. Developers have created several replacement Linux distributions for the Zaurus, the main ones being Software provided by [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] includes basic [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] packages such as a datebook, addressbook, and todo list. These [[Platform-independent model|PIM]] applications are fairly unsophisticated, and a number of individuals and groups have developed alternatives. One popular - and free - alternative that runs on the [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] ROM and [[OpenZaurus]] as well as Windows and [[Linux]] is the [http://pim.kde.org/ KDE PIM/Platform-independent] set of applications. KDE PIM/PI is based on [[Platform-independent model|PIM]] applications from the [[KDE]] desktop suite for [[Linux]]. KDE PIM/PI includes KOrganizer/Platform-independent (or [[KOPI]]), KAddressbook/Platform-independent (or KAPI), K-OpieMail/pi (or OMPI), K-Phone/pi (kppi) and [[PwM/PI]], a password manager with strong encryption. In addition to standard PDA applications there are many programs available that are more commonly associated with desktop and laptop computers. Among these are a selection of office programs, web browsers, media applications and many others. ==Notes and references== <!--See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref(erences/)> tags--> {{reflist}} == External links == {{commonscat}} === General resources === * [http://www.ezaurus.com/ Official Japan Zaurus Site] * {{dmoz|Computers/Systems/Handhelds/Sharp/Zaurus}} * [http://www.oesf.org/ OESF] Unofficial wiki and [http://www.oesf.org/forum/ forums] for all the models and [[Read-only memory|ROM]]s * [http://www.tyrannozaurus.com/ tyrannozaurus.com] Zaurus related blogs, wiki and forums * [http://www.retsiemuab.de/wiki2zaurus wiki2zaurus], Download all of Wikipedia for use on the Zaurus * [http://repair4pda.org/disassembly_sharp.html Repair4PDA (Sharp Zaurus)] - Repair, upgrade and take apart instructions. * [http://www.zaurus.org.uk Zaurus.org.uk] - a site aimed at UK owners but of general interest, with pictures of disassembled 6000 and information about [http://www.opentom.org OpenTom]. * [http://www.zaurusian.net Zaurusian] - Korean Zaurus user community site. * [http://www.linuxontour.de Linuxontour] Zaurus community (German) * [http://www.zauripedia.de Zauripedia] Zaurus Wiki (German) === Application software === * [http://www.killefiz.de/zaurus/ Zaurus Software Index (archive only - reborn as elsi (below))] * [http://www.elsix.org/index.php elsi - embedded linux software index] * [http://www.safedee.com/ SafeDee Password Safe or Password Manager for the Zaurus] * [http://www.zaurus-archiv.de Zaurus-Archive] Zaurus Software Archive (German) === ROMs and distributions === * [http://my-zaurus.narod.ru/cacko.html Cacko alternative ROM] * [http://www.pdaxrom.org/ pdaXrom alternative ROM] * [http://www.openzaurus.org OpenZaurus], an open-source alternative to the [[Read-only memory|ROM]] distributed with the Zaurus * [http://www.angstrom-distribution.org Ångström], the successor to OpenZaurus * [http://www.hentges.net/misc/openzaurus/index.shtml Hentges ROM], a preconfigured OpenZaurus-ROM * [[Debian]]: (see also the [http://www.debian.org/ports/arm Debian ARM port]) ** http://www.eleves.ens.fr/home/leurent/zaurus.html ** http://people.debian.org/~mdz/zaurus/ ** http://pocketworkstation.org/ * [[Gentoo Linux]]: http://gentooforzaurus.opensistemas.com * [[OpenBSD]]: http://www.openbsd.org/zaurus.html * [[Mac OS|Mac]]-like: [http://www.quantum-step.com/wiki.php?page=About QuantumSTEP] * [http://www.thekompany.com/embedded/rom/ TheKompany.rom] [http://www.zaurususergroup.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=UpDownload&file=index&req=viewsdownload&sid=31] * [http://www.elsix.org/index.php?w=project&p=Watapon_5600 Watapon 5600] * [http://www.timekiller.org/zynergy/ Zynergy] {{Linux devices}} [[Category:Personal digital assistants]] [[Category:Linux-based devices]] [[Category:Embedded Linux]] [[Category:Sharp products|Zaurus]] [[Category:Qt (toolkit)]] [[ca:Sharp Zaurus]] [[de:Zaurus]] [[es:Sharp Zaurus]] [[fr:Zaurus]] [[it:Zaurus]] [[ja:ザウルス]] [[pl:Zaurus]] [[pt:Sharp Zaurus]] [[ru:Zaurus]] [[simple:Zaurus]] [[sv:Zaurus]]</text> </page> <page> <id>34186</id> <title>SheerVideo</title> <text>{{Advert|article|date=August 2010}} '''SheerVideo''' is a family of proprietary [[lossless]] [[video codec]]s developed by BitJazz Inc. to enable capture, editing, playback, and archival of professional-quality lossless video formats in [[Real-time computer graphics|real time]] on low-power inexpensive hardware such as laptop computers and video cameras. As tested on a standard set of Kodak images used in image compression research, SheerVideo's average [[compression ratio]] is over 2:1 for real-world footage. Because SheerVideo generally runs faster than a computer system's data throughput speed, this compression power means that SheerVideo runs more than twice as fast as uncompressed data while taking less than half the storage space. == History == SheerVideo was initially developed by Andreas Wittenstein at BitJazz Inc. in July 2002 by trimming all the fat from BitJazz's slower but more powerful codec, PhotoJazz. == Details == Currently, SheerVideo contains specific codecs for real-time lossless encoding and decoding of [[RGB]][A] data (for digitized film and [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]) as well as [[YCbCr|Y'CbCr]][A] data (for video); with or without an [[Alpha channel|alpha]] (A) channel for compositing; at a precision of 10 or 8 bits per channel; fully sampled (4:4:4) or 2:1 chroma-subsampled (4:2:2); and [[progressive-scan]] (p) or [[interlaced]] (i): :* Sheer RGB[A] 10bf i|p :* Sheer RGB[A] 8bf i|p :* Sheer Y'CbCr[A] 10bv 4:4:4[:4] i|p :* Sheer Y'CbCr[A] 8bv 4:4:4[:4] i|p :* Sheer Y'CbCr[A] 10bv 4:2:2[:4] i|p :* Sheer Y'CbCr[A] 8bv 4:2:2[:4] i|p A unique feature of SheerVideo is the '''Synchromy''' lossless color-conversion engine which lets it convert between RGB and Y'CbCr color spaces with zero loss, or, when the output format lacks sufficient precision, with the maximum theoretically possible accuracy. This feature is useful for applying CGI tools to video footage, applying video tools to CGI and digitized film, and compositing video material with CGI and digitized film material. With the help of Synchromy, each of the specific Sheer codecs can input and output all supported uncompressed pixel formats - currently a couple dozen. The trade-off for this accuracy is that compression and decompression paths requiring color-space conversion are generally slower than real-time. In addition, there is a generic Sheer codec which automatically chooses the appropriate Sheer format for the source pixel format: :* Sheer For backwards compatibility, SheerVideo QT also retains a
