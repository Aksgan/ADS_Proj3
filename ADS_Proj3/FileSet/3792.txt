which not only the vowels but also the onsets of the rhyming syllables are identical, as in ''gun'' and ''begun''. Punning rhymes such are "bare" and "bear" are also identical rhymes. The rhyme may of course extend even farther back than the last stressed vowel. If it extends all the way to the beginning of the line, so that there are two lines that sound identical, then it is called a "holorhyme" ("For I scream/For ice cream"). ====Eye rhyme==== {{main|Eye rhyme}} Though not strictly rhymes, eye rhymes or sight rhymes refer to similarity in spelling but not in sound, as with ''cough'', ''bough'', or ''love'', ''move''. These are not rhymes in the strict sense, but often were in earlier language periods. ====Mind rhyme==== {{main|Mind Rhyme}} 'Mind Rhyme is a kind of substitution rhyme similar to [[rhyming slang]], but it is less generally codified and is “heard” only when generated by a specific verse context. For instance, “this sugar is neat / and tastes so sour.” If a reader or listener thinks of the word “sweet” instead of “sour”, then a mind rhyme has occurred. ===Classification by position=== The preceding classification has been based on the nature of the rhyme; but we may also classify rhymes according to their position in the verse: * '''tail rhyme''' (also called '''end rhyme''' or '''rime couée'''): a rhyme in the final syllable(s) of a verse (the most common kind) * When a word at the end of the line rhymes with a word in the interior of the line, it is called an [[internal rhyme]]. * Holorhyme has already been mentioned, by which not just two individual words, but two entire lines rhyme. A [[rhyme scheme]] is the pattern of rhyming lines in a poem. [[Internal rhyme]] is rhyme which occurs within a single [[Line (poetry)|line of verse]]. ==History== The earliest surviving evidence of rhyming is the Chinese [[Shi Jing]] (ca. 10th century BC). Rhyme is not used either in the poems of classical antiquity or in the [[Bible]], but is prominent in the [[Qur'an]] and other Arabic works. In Europe, the practice arose only with [[Late Antiquity]], continuing the [[homoioteleuton]] of rhetorics. According to some archaic sources, [[Early Irish literature|Irish literature]] introduced the rhyme to Early Medieval Europe, though this is a disputed claim;<ref>"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08116a.htm Article about early Irish literature by prof. Douglas Hyde in The Catholic Encyclopedia]"</ref> in the 7th century we find the Irish had brought the art of rhyming verses to a high pitch of perfection. The [[leonine verse]] is notable for introducing rhyme into High Medieval literature in the 12th century. From the 12th to the 20th centuries, European poetry is dominated through rhyme ==Rhyme in various languages== ===English=== :''See [[English poetry]]'' [[Old English poetry]] is mostly [[alliterative verse]]. One of the earliest rhyming poems in English is [[The Rhyming Poem]]. Some words in English, such as "[[Orange (word)|orange]]", are commonly regarded as having no rhyme. Although a clever poet can get around this (for example, by obliquely rhyming "orange" with combinations of words like "door hinge" or with <!--POV: far-fetched--> lesser-known words like "[[Blorenge]]", a hill in Wales), it is generally easier to move the word out of rhyming position or replace it with a [[synonym]] ("orange" could become "amber"). One view of rhyme in English is from [[John Milton]]'s preface to ''[[Paradise Lost]]'': :The Measure is ''English'' Heroic Verse without Rime, as that of ''Homer'' in ''Greek'', and of ''Virgil'' in ''Latin''; Rime being no necessary Adjunct or true Ornament of Poem or good Verse, in longer Works especially, but the Invention of a barbarous Age, to set off wretched matter and lame Meeter; grac't indeed since by the use of some famous modern Poets, carried away by Custom...<!--carefully proofread --> A more tempered view is taken by [[W. H. Auden]] in [[The Dyer's Hand]]: :Rhymes, meters, stanza forms, etc., are like servants. If the master is fair enough to win their affection and firm enough to command their respect, the result is an orderly happy household. If he is too tyrannical, they give notice; if he lacks authority, they become slovenly, impertinent, drunk and dishonest. Forced or clumsy rhyme is often a key ingredient of [[doggerel]]. ===French===<!-- This section is linked from [[Meter (poetry)]] --> In [[French poetry]], unlike in English, it is common to have "identical rhymes", in which not only the vowels of the final syllables of the lines rhyme, but their onset consonants ("consonnes d'appui") as well. To the ear of someone accustomed to English verse, this often sounds like a very weak rhyme. For example, an English perfect rhyme of homophones, ''flour'' and ''flower'', would seem weak, whereas a French rhyme of homophones ''doigt'' and ''doit'' is not only acceptable but quite common. Rhymes are sometimes classified into the categories "rime pauvre" ("poor rhyme"), "rime suffisante" ("sufficient rhyme"), "rime riche" ("rich rhyme") and "rime richissime" ("very rich rhyme"), according to the number of rhyming sounds in the two words or in the parts of the two verses. For example to rhyme "parla" with "sauta" would be a poor rhyme (the words have only the vowel in common), to rhyme "pas" with "bras" a sufficient rhyme (with the vowel and the silent consonant in common), and "tante" with "attente" a rich rhyme (with the vowel, the onset consonant, and the coda consonant with its mute "e" in common). Authorities disagree, however, on exactly where to place the boundaries between the categories. ''[[Holorime]]'' is an extreme example of ''rime richissime'' spanning an entire verse. [[Alphonse Allais]] was a notable exponent of holorime. Here is an example of a holorime couplet from Victor Hugo: :''Gall, amant de la Reine, alla (tour magnanime)'' :''Gallamment de l'Arène à la Tour Magne, à Nîmes.'' :Gallus, the Queen's lover, went (a magnanimous gesture) :Gallantly from the Arena to the Great Tower, at Nîmes. Classical French rhyme only differs from English rhyme in its different treatment of onset consonants. It also treats coda consonants in a peculiarly French way. French spelling
