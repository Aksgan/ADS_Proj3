It is mainly used for abbreviating a system command, or for adding default arguments to a regularly used command. An alias will last for the life of the shell session. Regularly used aliases can be set from the shell's configuration file (''~/.cshrc'' or the systemwide ''/etc/csh.cshrc'' for csh, or ''~/.bashrc'' or the systemwide ''/etc/bashrc'' or ''/etc/bash.bashrc'' for bash) so that they will be available upon the start of the corresponding shell session. The alias commands may either be written in the config file directly or [[source (command)|source]]d from a separate file, typically named .alias (or .alias-bash, .alias-csh, etc., if multiple shells may be used). ==Creating aliases== Aliases can be created by supplying name/value pairs as arguments for the alias command. An example of the [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]] shell syntax is: alias copy="cp" The corresponding syntax in the [[C shell]] or [[tcsh]] shell is: alias copy "cp" This alias means that when the command <code>copy</code> is read in the shell, it will be replaced with <code>cp</code> and that command will be executed instead. In the 4DOS/4NT shell the following syntax is used to define <code>cp</code> as an alias for the 4DOS <code>copy</code> command: alias cp copy To create a new alias in Windows PowerShell, the <code>new</code> verb can be used with the <code>alias</code> cmdlet: new-alias ci copy-item This creates a new alias called <code>ci</code> that will be replaced with the <code>copy-item</code> cmdlet when executed. ==History== In Unix, aliases were introduced in the [[C shell]] and thus survive in descendent shells such as [[tcsh]] and [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]]. C shell aliases were strictly limited to one line in a shell language where all complex constructs required more, but still useful for creating simple shortcut commands. Aliases were absent from the [[Bourne shell]], which had the more powerful facility of functions. The alias concept was imported into [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bourne Again Shell]] (bash) and the [[Korn shell]] (ksh). Shells such as these, that support both functions and aliases, recommend using functions where possible. Cases where aliases are necessary include the use of chained aliases (bash and ksh). ==Viewing currently defined aliases== To view defined aliases the following commands can be used: alias # Used without arguments; displays a list of all current aliases alias -p # Analogous to the above; not available in 4DOS/4NT and PowerShell alias ''myAlias'' # Displays the command for a defined alias ==Overriding aliases== In Unix shells, if an alias exists for a command, it is possible to override the alias by surrounding the command with
