has a head normal form, then normal order reduction will eventually reach it. In contrast, applicative order reduction may not terminate, even when the term has a normal form. For example, using applicative order reduction, the following sequence of reductions is possible: :<math> (\mathbf{\lambda} x . z) ((\lambda w. w w w) (\lambda w. w w w)) </math> :<math> \rightarrow (\lambda x . z) ((\lambda w. w w w) (\lambda w. w w w) (\lambda w. w w w))</math> :<math> \rightarrow (\lambda x . z) ((\lambda w. w w w) (\lambda w. w w w) (\lambda w. w w w) (\lambda w. w w w))</math> :<math> \rightarrow (\lambda x . z) ((\lambda w. w w w) (\lambda w. w w w) (\lambda w. w w w) (\lambda w. w w w) (\lambda w. w w w))</math> :<math>\ldots</math> But using normal-order reduction, the same starting point reduces quickly to normal form: :<math> (\mathbf{\lambda} x . z) ((\lambda w. w w w) (\lambda w. w w w)) </math> :<math> \rightarrow z </math> Sinot's [[director string]]s is one method by which the computational complexity of beta reduction can be optimized. ==See also== * [[Lambda calculus]] * [[Normal form]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Beta Normal Form}} [[Category:Lambda calculus]] [[zh:Beta范式]]</text> </page> <page> <id>3691</id> <title>Bhawani Shankar Chowdhry</title> <text>{{Infobox scientist |box_width = 270px |name = Bhawani Shankar Chowdhry |image = bhawanishankarchowdhry.jpg |image_size = |alt = |caption =Bhawani Shankar Chowdhry Receiving South Asia Star Award, 2008 |birth_date ={{birth year and age|1959|1|1}} |birth_place =[[Kantio]], West Pakistan |death_place = |residence =[[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]], [[Sindh|Sindh province]] |citizenship = [[Pakistan]] |nationality = [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]] |ethnicity = |fields = [[Electronics Engineering]] |workplaces =[[Mehran University of Engineering and Technology]] (MUET)<br>[[University of Southampton]] |alma_mater =[[Mehran University of Engineering and Technology]]<br>[[University of Southampton]] |doctoral_advisor = |academic_advisors = |doctoral_students = |notable_students = |known_for = |author_abbrev_bot = |author_abbrev_zoo = |influences = |influenced =[[Stephen Hawking]] |awards =[[Pride of Performance|Pride of Performance Award]] |religion = |signature = <!--(filename only)--> |signature_alt = |footnotes = }} '''[[Dr.]] [[Prof.]] Bhawani Shankar chowdhry''' ({{lang-ur|'''بھوانی شنکر چوڈري'''}}) (born January 1, 1959),<ref>http://www.tarabhawan.com/index.htm</ref> is a [[Pakistan]]i renowned ICT Professional and an electronics engineer. He is the current Director of Institute of Information and Communication Technologies and Chairman Department of Electronics and Bio Medical Engineering at the [[Mehran University of Engineering and Technology]] Jamashoro,<ref>http://www.muet.edu.pk</ref> [[Sindh]], Pakistan. ==Education== Born in Pakistan to a [[Hindu]] family, Shankar did [[Bachelor of Engineering|B.E.]] in Electronic Engineering with [[First Class Honours]] from [[Mehran University of Engineering and Technology]], [[Jamshoro]] (MUET) in 1983. At the same time, he was appointed as a Lecturer in electronics engineering program in MUET and did his [[Master of Engineering|M.Eng.]] in [[electrical engineering]] in 1987. In 1987, he was awarded Merit Scholarship by [[Ministry of Science and Technology (Pakistan)|Ministry of Science and Technology]] of [[Government of Pakistan]] to gain [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] from [[United Kingdom]]. ==Academic career== He completed his Doctrate degree in 1990 from Electronics and Computer Science Department at the [[University of Southampton]] and reluctantly returned to Pakistan under the contract. He joined his [[alma mater]] as an [[associate professor]] and was directly promoted as an Assistant Professor in 1990. In 1991, Bhawani planned and organized a mega event “''TECHNO-91''” to promote science and technology in Pakistan. In 1993, the university had appointed him as a Chairman of the Electronics Engineering Department. He has been serving as a [[chairman]] since past 16 years and during his chairmanship he also established two new departments viz-a-viz Telecommunication Engineering and Biomedical Engineering. ==Writings and Publications== In year 2007-08 he has completed one year Postdoctoral Fellowship Sponsored by [[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan|HEC]] from one of the world’s best Institution, the School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, UK. His [[research]] work in the area of [[Wireless Sensor Networks]] has resulted into a number of publications and he has the honour of becoming one of the editors of the book “Wireless Networks, Information Processing and Systems”, CCIS 20, recently published by [[Springer-Verlag]], [[Germany]]. During his Postdoctoral Fellowship, he was also honoured by World Federation of Engineering Organization (WFEO) France as a Member of Committee on Information Technology (CIC). ==Fellowships== In addition he became a Member of Editorial Board, World Academy of Science Engineering and Technology, and Associate Editor of International Journal of Social Network Mining (IJSNM), Inderscience Publishers, USA. Upon return from UK, after completion of Postdoctoral Fellowship, he was appointed as a Director, Institute of Information and Communication Technologies (IICT). Recently he has been visiting ALBORG Univ [[Denmark]] on one month fully funded visit in capacity of a MUET Lead person of [[Erasmus Mundus]] external cooperation Window Project: Mobility of Life. Under this project, 19 students of BEng / ME/ PhD , and faculty members has got chance to come to 8 European Universities under fully funded [[scholarship]] from 6months to one year.

His father Kishanchand was Primary teacher. He had early education from Govt school Kantio. He was very hardworking and talented boy in his class. He did his [[Matriculation]] examination from Govt High School [[Kunri]], [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]]. After which he had Intermediate from Shah Latif College [[Mirpurkhas]].In 1977, he got admission in [[Electronics Engineering]] at [[Mehran University of Engineering and Technology]]. He got married to Tarawati of his Maheshwari Community in Feb 1978 when he was student of First year Engineering. He has 02 daughters. His first child was born in 1981 named Geeta. She became Doctor and married to Engr Kishor Kumar Chandani. His second daughter became [[engineer]] and later on she did Masters in Business [[Information technology|IT]] from [[UK]]. She got married with Mr Santosh Kumar Dhirani. prof Chowdhry has travelled to more than 20 countries.
