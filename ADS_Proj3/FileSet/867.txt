it should be considered. However, there is no sense to increase the complexity of models introducing trust evidences if, later, they have to be used in an environment where it is not possible to exploit their capabilities. The aggregation of more Trust and reputation evidences is useful in a computational model but it can increase its complexity and so it is difficult to find a general solution. Several models are extremely dependent on the characteristics of the environment and a possible solution could be the use of adaptive mechanisms that can modify how to combine different sources of information in a given environment. A lot of trust and reputation definitions have been presented and there are several works that help to give a precise and distinct meaning of both concepts.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = McKnight D.H., Chervany N.L. | title = The meanings of trust.

Nowadays, game theory is the predominant paradigm considered to design computational trust and reputation models. In all likelihood, this theory is taken into account because a significant number of economists and computer scientists, with a strong background in game theory and artificial intelligence techniques, are working in multi-agent and e-commerce contexts. Game theoretical models produce good results but, when the complexity of the agents, in terms of social relations and interaction increases, become too restrictive. The exploration of new possibilities should be considered and, for example, there should be an aggregation between cognitive approaches with game theoretical ones. Apart from that, more trust evidences should be considered and [[trust metric]]s more sensitive to time,<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Longo L. | title = Security Through Collaboration in Global Computing: a Computational Trust Model Based on Temporal Factors to Evaluate Trustworthiness of Virtual Identities | publisher = Master Degree, Insubria University | year = 2007}}</ref><ref> {{Cite journal | author = D.

This [[medical imaging]] technique uses [[laser]] energy in the near infrared region of the spectra, to detect [[angiogenesis]] in the breast tissue. It is optical molecular imaging for [[hemoglobin]] both oxygenated and deoxygenated. The technology uses laser in the same way [[computed tomography]] uses X-Rays, these beams travel through tissue and suffer attenuation. A laser detector measures the intensity drop and the data is collected as the laser detector moves across the breast creating a tomography image. CTLM images show hemoglobin distribution in a tissue and can detect areas of Angiogenesis surrounding malignant tumors, that stimulate this angiogenesis to obtain nutrients for growth. == References == * [http://www.imds.com/products/ctlm/ CTLM-section on Imaging Diagnostic Systems website] * [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=%22computed+tomography+laser+mammography%22&btnG=Search CTLM on Google Scholar] * [http://nersp.nerdc.ufl.edu/~nikos/Downloads/SPIE_Opt_Mammo.pdf Grable R.J. and others.

A common application of such systems is the maintenance of computers, either hardware or software, themselves. It can also apply to the maintenance of other complex systems that require periodic maintenance, such as reminding operators that preventive maintenance is due or even predicting when such maintenance should be performed based on recorded past experience. ==Computer aided configuration== The first computer-aided maintenance software came from [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] in the 1980s to configure [[VAX]] computers. The software was built using the techniques of [[artificial intelligence]] [[expert system]]s, because the problem of configuring a VAX required expert knowledge. During the research,
