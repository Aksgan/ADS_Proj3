2007 as several specialist GPS technology developers were acquired by wireless chipset vendors. These transactions are likely to enhance the possibilities to meet handset manufacturers’ demand for integrated connectivity solutions that include GPS at ever lower price points to enable true mass market deployment. Sales of GPS-enabled GSM/WCDMA handsets grew to about 24.5 million units in 2007 according to independent analyst firm Berg Insight. Although the number is very small in comparison with the 150 million GPS-enabled CDMA handsets sold, the number is growing rapidly. Berg Insight estimates that shipments of GPS-enabled GSM/WCDMA handsets will grow to 370 million units in 2012, the equivalent of more than 26 percent of all GSM/WCDMA handsets sold that year. Including CDMA handsets, GPS-enabled handsets sales are estimated to reach about 560 million, or 35 percent of total handset shipments in 2012. --> ==== Restrictions on civilian use ==== The U.S. Government controls the export of some civilian receivers. All GPS receivers capable of functioning above {{km to mi|18}} altitude and {{convert|515|m/s|knot}}<ref> Arms Control Association.[http://www.armscontrol.org/documents/mtcr Missile Technology Control Regime]. Retrieved May 17, 2006.</ref> are classified as [[United States Munitions List|munitions]] (weapons) for which [[U.S. State Department]] [[export license]]s are required. These limits attempt to prevent use of a receiver in a [[ballistic missile]]. They would not prevent use in a [[cruise missile]] because their altitudes and speeds are similar to those of ordinary aircraft. This rule applies even to otherwise purely civilian units that only receive the L1 frequency and the C/A (Clear/Acquisition) code and cannot correct for Selective Availability (SA), etc. Disabling operation above these limits exempts the receiver from classification as a munition. Vendor interpretations differ. The rule targets operation given the combination of altitude and speed, while some receivers stop operating even when stationary. This has caused problems with some amateur radio balloon launches that regularly reach {{km to mi|30}}. === Military === As of 2009, military applications of GPS include: * Navigation: GPS allows soldiers to find objectives, even in the dark or in unfamiliar territory, and to coordinate troop and supply movement. In the US armed forces, commanders use the ''Commanders Digital Assistant'' and lower ranks use the ''Soldier Digital Assistant''.<ref> [http://web.archive.org/web/20071201034857/http://peosoldier.army.mil/factsheets/SWAR_LW_DBCS.pdf Commanders Digital Assistant explanation and photo]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://peosoldier.army.mil/factsheets/SWAR_LW_CDA.pdf |title=Latest version Commanders Digital Assistant |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2009-10-13}}</ref><ref> [http://web.archive.org/web/20080610092154/http://www.army-technology.com/contractors/computers/lago/lago6.html Soldier Digital Assistant explanation and photo]</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Sinha |first=Vandana |url=http://gcn.com/articles/2003/07/24/soldiers-take-digital-assistants-to-war.aspx |title=Commanders and Soldiers' GPS-receivers |publisher=Gcn.com |date=2003-07-24 |accessdate=2009-10-13}}</ref> * Target tracking: Various military weapons systems use GPS to track potential ground and air targets before flagging them as hostile.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} These weapon systems pass target coordinates to [[precision-guided munition]]s to allow them to engage targets accurately.

These signals are transmitted on two separate carrier frequencies that are common to all satellites in the network. Two different encodings are used, a public encoding that enables lower resolution navigation, and an encrypted encoding used by the U.S. military. === Message format === :{| class="wikitable" style="float:right; margin:0 0 0.5em 1em;" border="1" |+ {{nowrap|GPS message format}} !

Each complete message is composed of 30-second [[Frame (networking)|frame]]s, distinct groupings of 1,500 bits of information. Each frame is further subdivided into 5 subframes of length 6 seconds and with 300 bits each. Each subframe contains 10 words of 30 bits with length 0.6 seconds each. Each 30 second frame begins precisely on the minute or half minute as indicated by the atomic clock on each satellite.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gpsinformation.net/gpssignal.htm |title=Satellite message format |publisher=Gpsinformation.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-15}}</ref> The first part of the message encodes the week number and the time within the week,<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Woessner, Anja Koehne |url=http://www.kowoma.de/en/gps/data_composition.htm |title=time-of-week |publisher=Kowoma.de |date= |accessdate=2010-10-15}}</ref> as well as the data about the health of the satellite.
