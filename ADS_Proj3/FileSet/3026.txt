or by purpose. The Office can assign any age restriction, but R13, R16 and R18 are most commonly used, with R15 used less often. Persons under the age restriction may not see the film under any circumstance, even with parental consent. However, the Office may assign an RP rating (i.e. RP13 or RP16) which allows children under the age of classification to see the film with an accompanying parent or adult guardian. The Office may also restrict a film to a certain purpose, in which case the R rating is used. The film is considered objectionable unless the conditions of the restriction are met. This may mean that a film is limited to viewing for study or research purposes, theatrical release, or for screening at film festivals. For instance, the film ''[[Irréversible]]'' is classified R18, but with additional restrictions limiting it to "the purposes of theatrical exhibition or study in tertiary institutions only". ==Nigeria== The [http://www.nfvcb.gov.ng National Film and Video Censors Board] classifies films, videos, DVDs, and VCDs. The categories are: * '''G''': General admittance. * '''PG''': Parental Guidance suggested. * '''12''': Suitable for children aged 12 years and older. * '''12A''': Same as 12, but younger children can be admitted if accompanied. * '''15''': Suitable for children aged 15 years and older. * '''18''': Suitable for people aged 18 years and older. * '''RE''': Restricted Exhibition: can be shown only subject to certain restrictions. ==Norway== In [[Norway]] all movies have to be registered by the [[Norwegian Media Authority]] (''Medietilsynet'', formerly ''Filmtilsynet''), a government agency, to be exhibited commercially. Though if distributors wish, they can just register the movie with the agency without any need for approval, but the distributor is then obligated not to admit anyone under the age of 18. The distributor is also responsible that the movie does not violate Norwegian law (only applies to movies with "degrading hardcore sexual content"). Movies are rated using the following classifications: * '''A''' (all ages) * '''7''' * '''11''' * '''15''' * '''18''' Films rated 7, 11 or 15 may also be seen by children accompanied by a parent or adult guardian if the child has turned 4, 8 or 11 years, respectively. In addition to the ratings, the board indicates if a movie is suitable for children, families, youths or adults. A film may be given a rating even though it is intended for an older age group, e.g. an "A" film might be intended for adults if it does not contain material unsuitable for young children. The Norwegian Media Authority have a somewhat greater tolerance for bad language and suggestive content than certain other countries, therefore films rated PG-13 in USA, might be given '7+' or the 'Suitable for all' rating. Examples are ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'' or ''[[Step Up (film)|Step Up]]''. The board also indicates if a rating is "hard". A "hard" 11/15 rating is usually indicated by the text "not advised for children/youths under 11/15" ("frarådes barn/ungdom under 11/15 år"), however this does not affect if children under the given age are allowed to see the film if accompanied. In 2000 a Board of Appeal was established. Prior to this the ratings board could choose to reclassify a film. ==Peru== The motion picture rating system for movies shown in Peruvian movie theatres are: * '''Apt''' General audiences. All ages are admitted. * '''14''' Intense violence and language. No children under 14 admitted without the company of an adult. * '''18''' Extreme graphic violence, language and drug abuse. This rating also extends to pornography films. No children under 18 admitted without the company of an adult. ==Philippines== {{Main|Movie and Television Review and Classification Board}} In the [[Philippines]], motion pictures are rated by the [[Movie and Television Review and Classification Board]], a special agency of the [[President of the Philippines|Office of the President]]. Television programs are also subject to the same ratings classification system. There are five ratings currently in use: * '''GP''' - General patronage * '''PG-13''' - Children under 13 not admitted unless accompanied by an adult * '''R''' (''deprecated'') - Strictly for persons over 17 (until early 2000s when the rating was split into two brackets) ** '''R-13''' - Strictly for children over 13 only ** '''R-18''' - Strictly for viewers over 18 only * '''X''' - Not for public viewing ==Poland== [[Image:Polish tv rating system.svg|50px|thumb|right|Polish television rating certificates.]] Ratings in Poland are not set by any board or advisory body, but it rather depends on distribution company, cinema or television station. In case of television, the supervisory body - [[Krajowa Rada Radiofonii i Telewizji]] (KRRiT, The National Council of Radio Broadcasting and Television) can impose fines upon those responsible for improper rating of a broadcast, or lack of it. * Rating for movies shown in cinemas: ** '''BO ''(Bez ograniczeń)''''' - Suitable for everyone ** '''7''' - Suitable for children 7 years and older (this rating is not considered 'official', and it's used by some cinemas. Other variations include '6', '8', '9' or '10') ** '''12''' - Suitable for children 12 years and older ** '''15''' - Suitable for children 15 years and older ** '''18''' - Only for adults ** '''21''' - Only for adults, contains graphic and "unnecessary" violence; only a few movies have been rated 21 (namely ''[[Irréversible]]'', ''[[Dobermann (film)|Le Dobermann]], ''[[Caligula]]'' and ''[[Baise-moi|Baise-Moi]]''). * Ratings for programmes and movies shown on television: ** '''Green circle''' - for everyone ** '''Yellow triangle''' - age intimate in triangle ''(7, 12, 16)'' ** '''Red circle''' - for adults ''(18 years)'' ==Portugal== Movies are rated in [[Portugal]] by the [http://www.cce.org.pt/ Comissão de Classificação de Espectáculos] of the [[Ministry of Culture (Portugal)|Ministry of Culture]]. In cinemas the ratings are mandatory whereas for video releases they're merely advisory. The categories are the following: * '''M/4''' Suitable for all audiences (however, in cinemas the minimum age for admission is 4). This is used mostly for movies and videos that are particularly recommended for young children. (Examples: [[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]], [[Chicken Run]], [[Happy Feet]]) * '''M/6''' Passed for
