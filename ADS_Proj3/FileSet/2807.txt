Lead designer [[Dave Ellis (game designer)|Dave Ellis]] said "...development time and platform limitations didn’t permit our DS developers to pursue that option, so the DS version was ultimately limited to Wi-Fi and online play with other DS players." The PSP and PC versions allow players to use the same matchmaking system, and the game's code is linked so that if one platform is patched, the other must be as well.<ref name="vcdiary2" /> Players with a PC can download and use the online component of the game for free.<ref name="fpdownload">{{cite web|url=http://www.fileplanet.com/174419/170000/fileinfo/Marvel:-Trading-Card-Game-(Online-Client)|title=Marvel: Trading Card Game v1.1|publisher=FilePlanet|accessdate=2009-03-28}}</ref> [[File:MTCGStory.jpg|left|thumb|A [[Cut scene|cutscene]] from the [[Single-player video game|single-player]] campaign, depicting the [[X-Men]] [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]].]] The plot in the single-player mode of ''Marvel Trading Card Game'' was composed by Marvel writer [[John Layman]], and the [[Cut scene|cutscenes]] were drawn by comic artists like [[Keron Grant]] and [[Pat Olliffe]].<ref name="mcannounce">{{cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/news/vgstories.415.Marvel_TCG_for_PSP|title=Marvel Trading Card Game for PSP out now|date=2007-02-27|publisher=Marvel Comics|accessdate=2009-03-28}}</ref> Early in the development process, the design team had considered portraying the player's avatar as a character within the game's story, but this idea was eventually discarded, and the game does not explain the player's role. The plot, which revolves around the group of robotic enemies of the X-Men known as Sentinels, was created because in real life, competitive play in the Marvel card game community was focused on Sentinel decks around the time of ''Marvel Trading Card Game's'' development. Around 300 separate decks were created by the design team for the single-player mode, and AI opponents use a more challenging deck if they are played against more than once.<ref name="vcdiary2" /> The game contains over 1,100 cards,<ref name="vcdiary" /> and includes cards from select expansion sets in the physical version, like the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[Fantastic Four]]. PC and PSP owners can download the X-Men expansion set online for free. Over four hundred characters are represented, with over a hundred as specific entries in the story mode.<ref name="mcint" /> Artwork for cards was provided by artists such as [[Alex Garner]] and [[Adam Kubert]].<ref name="gspote3" /> Whenever a player completes a chapter in the story mode, they are awarded a five-card booster pack.<ref name="vcdiary2" /> The game includes a deck editor that allows players to create and modify decks as they see fit.<ref name="mcint" /> ''Marvel Trading Card Game'' was released for the PSP on February 27, 2007 in [[North America]], June 8 in [[Europe]], and July 6 in [[Australia]].<ref name="gfaqspsp">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/psp/data/932927.html|title=Marvel Trading Card Game Release Information for PSP|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2009-03-28}}</ref> The DS version was released on May 22 in North America, July 25 in Europe, and on August 3 in Australia.<ref name="gfaqsds">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/ds/data/932928.html|title=Marvel Trading Card Game Release Information for DS|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2009-03-28}}</ref> The PC version was released on June 8 in Europe and July 3 in North America, and included a [[Special edition|limited edition]].<ref name="gfaqspc">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/computer/doswin/data/932926.html|title=Marvel Trading Card Game Release Information for PC|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2009-03-28}}</ref> ===Online community=== Online matchmaking and the card store were opened in tandem with the PSP version's North American release.<ref name="ignship">{{cite web|url=http://games.ign.com/articles/768/768281p1.html|title=Konami Ships Marvel Trading Card Game|date=2007-02-27|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2009-03-28}}</ref> PC players used the same services when their version was released.<ref name="ignopens">{{cite web|url=http://psp.ign.com/objects/766/766618_articles.html|title=Marvel Opens Trading|last=Goldstein|first=Hilary|date=2007-02-27|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2009-03-28}}</ref> The matchmaking service, the website, store, and other online features were maintained by [[Agora Games]],<ref name="jraybug">{{cite web|url=http://www.marveltcgonline.com/web/news/list%3Fpage=3|title=News - JRay on bug issues|last=Ray|first=Jason|date=2007-04-30|publisher=Marvel Trading Card Game Online|accessdate=2009-03-28}}</ref> a gaming company that specializes in online communities.<ref name="agora">{{cite web|url=http://www.agoragames.com/about|title=Agora Games - About|publisher=Agora Games|accessdate=2009-03-28}}</ref> Konami offered players sanctioned tournaments and downloadable card packs.<ref name="ignship" /> On March 12, 2008, Konami announced that it was closing down the website's forums and the online store.
