This definition is vague, and can allow several different devices to be called Media Servers. It may be a simple [[Network-attached storage]], a [[Home theater PC]] (HTPC) running [[Windows XP editions#Media Center Edition|Windows XP Media Center Edition]], [[MediaPortal]] or [[MythTV]], or a commercial [[web server]] that hosts media for a large web site. In a home setting, a media server acts as an aggregator of information: [[video]], [[Sound recording|audio]], [[photos]], [[books]], etc. These different types of media (whether they originated on [[DVD]], [[compact disc|CD]], [[digital camera]], or in physical form) are stored on the media server's [[hard drive]]. Access to these is then available from a central location. It may also be used to run special applications that allow the user(s) to access the media from a remote location via the internet. ==Hardware== The only requirement for a media server is a method of storing media and a network connection with enough bandwidth to allow access to that media. Depending on the uses and applications that it runs, a media server may require large amounts of [[RAM]], or a powerful, [[multicore]] [[CPU]]. A [[RAID]] may be used to create a large amount of storage, though it is generally not necessary in a home media server to use a [[RAID]] that gives a performance increase because current home network transfer speeds are slower than that of most current [[hard drive]]s. However, a [[Standard_RAID_levels#RAID_1|RAID]] configuration may be used to prevent loss of the media files due to disk failure as well. Many Media servers also have the ability to capture the media. This is done with specialized hardware such as TV tuner cards. Analog TV tuner cards can capture video from analog broadcast TV and output from cable/satellite set top boxes. This analog video then needs to be encoded in digital format to be stored on the Media server. This encoding can be done with software running on the Media server computer or by hardware on the TV tuner card. Digital TV tuner cards take input from broadcast digital TV. In the USA, the ATSC standard is used. In most of the rest of the world, DVB-T is the accepted standard. Since these transmissions are already digital, they do not need to be encoded. ==HTPC packages with server capabilities== * [[Cisco Video Portal]] / [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps6682/index.html] * [[GB-PVR]] * [http://www.gallm.com/ Got All Media] * [[LinuxMCE]] * [[MediaPortal]] / [http://wiki.team-mediaportal.com/TV-Engine_0.3 MediaPortal TV Server] * [[MythTV]] * [[Orb (software)|Orb]] * [[XBMC Media Center]] * [[Xtream Media Servers]] / [http://www.xtreammediaservers.com] == TV tuner hardware == * [http://www.vistaview.tv/ Vista View] Saber Cards.

These machines are often high-spec home computers with increased [[RAM]] or hard drive technologies such as [[RAID]] arrays or [[solid-state drive]]s. They are then supplied with software which allows the control and manipulation of video content, much like [[VJ]] software. One of the primary functions of these machines is to allow current show control technologies to control the playback of video content. Thus, a media server system may include inputs for [[DMX512-A]], [[MIDI]] or similar control protocols. ==Media Servers in Telephony== In the world of telephony, a media server is the computing component that processes the audio and/or video streams associated with telephone calls or connections. Conference services are a particular example of how media servers can be used, as a special 'engine' is needed to mix audio streams together so that conference participants can hear all of the other participants. Conferencing servers may also need other specialized functions like "loudest talker" detection, or [[Transcode|transcoding]] of audio streams, and also interpreting [[DTMF]] tones used to navigate menus. For video processing, it may be needed to change video streams, for example transcode from one video codec to another or rescale (transrate) a picture from one size to another. This media processing functions are the core responsibility of a media server. With telephony networks moving more towards [[VoIP]] technology, and using [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP), the idea of media servers has started to gain some traction. Typically, an application (the 'application server') has the controlling logic, and controls a remote media server (or multiple servers) over an [[Internet protocol|IP]] connection, possibly using SIP. Protocols such as Netann, [[MSCML]] and [[MSML]] have been created for this way of working, and a new protocol, [[MediaCTRL]] is under development at the [[IETF]]. The [[IP Multimedia Subsystem]] (IMS), the blueprint for next generation networks, defines a component called the MRF (Media Resource Function), which is a kind of media server. In the case of IMS, the 'controlling logic' is provided by the MRFC (MRF controller), which, along with layers above constitutes an 'application server'. Although the MRF has been associated largely with the legacy telecom H.248 protocol (see [[H.248|Gateway Control Protocol]]), it is claimed that SIP-based protocols like MediaCTRL will ultimately prevail. ==See also== * [[Digital Living Network Alliance]] * [[Digital media receiver]] * [[UPnP AV
