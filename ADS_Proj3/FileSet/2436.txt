Each account is done as a separate and single unit; * slight [[Customer relationship management|contact management]] opportunities; * no connection and interaction between tasks and [[Milestone|milestones]] (events) in the [[Gantt chart]] (planning screen); * slight connection and [[Interaction|interaction]] tools between the main planning [[Workspace|workspace]] (macro-level) and current and detailed activity workspace (micro-level) within a project. === Advantages === * light mobile versions of the web-application for [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iPad]] and [[iPhone]]; * task status control via e-mail; * compliance of the pricing policy with the abilities of the target audience (small business), i.e. no relation between monthly cost of the web-service and the number of projects being created, as well as participants being invited <ref name="KC1">[http://mashable.com/2010/02/11/kommandcore/ KommandCore Combines Project Management With GTD], paragraph 3.</ref>, while the full functionality is provided. == References == <references /> == External links == * [http://www.tie50.net/TiE50Awards/TiE50_Finalists.asp?StartALPH=K Tie50 Awards Finalists], Recognizing World's Most Entreprising Technology Startups, Silicon Valley, Santa Clara, CA 95054 * [http://unified-communications.tmcnet.com/news/2009/12/14/4531514.htm All the Rage of Lively Management] * [http://www.killerstartups.com/Web-App-Tools/kommandcore-com-an-enhanced-way-to-manage-projects An Enhanced Way To Manage Projects] * [http://www.flickr.com/photos/kommandcore/5184582176/ Infographics - subjective comparison of functioning logic by some project management services] * [http://mashable.com/2010/02/11/kommandcore/ KommandCore Combines Project Management With GTD] Mashable * [http://kommandcore.com/vision.html «Some Essays about Management», V.Salnikov, D.Galiullin, 2009] (Product philosophy) * [http://www.web2null.de/kommandcore KommandCore: Projektmanagement] (de) * [http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/horizontal-communication.html Definition for horizontal communication] (Business Dictionary) == See also == * [[Agile software development]] * [[Comparison of project management software]] * [[Cloud computing]] * [[Groupware]] * [[Issue management]] * [[Project management]] * [[Project portfolio management]] * [[Risk management]] * [[Project planning]] * [[Project Management Institute]] {{computer-stub}} [[Category:Project management software]] [[Category:Internet properties established in 2008]] [[Category:Information technology]] [[ru:Kommandcore]]</text> </page> <page> <id>20813</id> <title>Konami Justifier</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=November 2006}} [[Image:Konami justifiers.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Photograph from 2007 depicting the blue and pink Justifiers made for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the green one made for the PlayStation.]] The '''Konami Justifier''' was a [[light gun]] used in numerous [[video arcade]] and [[home console]] games developed and/or published by [[Konami]] and [[Sega]]. Konami manufactured variations of the gun for the [[Sega Genesis]], [[Sega CD]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Nintendo]], and [[PlayStation]] consoles. The gun was similar in appearance to a [[Colt Python]]. During the early 1990s, it was controversial in that it was realistic and used in equally realistic, violent video games. It was used as an example in the United States of America (US) congressional hearings of 1992 to 1993. The Sega and Nintendo versions include a blue revolver looking gun that connects to the console and a rare pink Justifier of similar design that plugs into either blue gun rather than into the console. The Sony version of the lightgun (Sony ID: SLEH-00005, SLUH-00017) is green in color and only works in the first controller slots on the original design of the PlayStation 2. The Sony version was the first light gun on the PlayStation, the second being the [[GunCon]], which was designed by [[Namco]]. ==Arcade games== {{Expand list|date=August 2008}} * ''[[Lethal Enforcers]]'' (1992) * ''[[Lethal Enforcers II: Gunfighters]] ==Console games== {{Expand list|date=August 2008}} ===Sega Genesis=== *''[[Lethal Enforcers]]'' *''[[Lethal Enforcers II: Gunfighters]]'' ===Sega CD=== *''Lethal Enforcers'' *''Lethal Enforcers II: Gunfighters'' *''[[Snatcher]]'' *''[[Mad Dog McCree]]'' *''[[Mad Dog II: The Lost Gold]]'' *''[[Who Shot Johnny Rock]]'' ===Super Nintendo Entertainment System=== *''Lethal Enforcers'' *''Lethal Enforcers II: Gun Fighters'' (Canceled) ===PlayStation=== * ''[[Area 51 (arcade game)|Area 51]]'' * ''[[Crypt Killer]]''
