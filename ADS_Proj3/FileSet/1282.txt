It provides a search platform for those interested in [[Spatial development]] Analysis, [[Planning]] and [[policy]] but especially [[Strategic]] Spatial Planning in a [[Europe]]an context. In the context of the contemporary devolution processes and the growing application of the [[European Spatial Development Perspective]] in planning practice and policy in many [[European countries]], ESPRID provides a range of online resources. The [[database]] has been developed for [[researchers]] and [[policy-makers]] concerned with Strategic [[Spatial Planning]] in a [[Europe]]an context. It contains material from [[academic]] books and journals, policy reports, plans and policy statements, databases and websites, and also includes information on relevant [[experts]]. One of its targets is to aid those involved in [[Interreg]] programmes and those developing spatial strategies across [[Europe]]. == See also == * [[European Spatial Development Planning|ESDP-Network]] * [[European Research Networks]] * [[Spatial planning]] * [[Strategic planning]] * [[Global Urban Research Unit]] * [[The Globalized City]] ==References== {{Reflist}} == External links== * [http://www.esprid.org European Spatial Planning Research and Information Database] * [http://www.apl.ncl.ac.uk School of Architecture, Planning and Landscape] The home of ESPRID [[Category:Databases]] [[Category:Social sciences literature]] [[Category:Urban planning by region]] [[Category:Research projects]] [[Category:Newcastle University]]</text> </page> <page> <id>11505</id> <title>ESSH Client</title> <text>{{lowercase}} '''eSSH Client''' is a multi task client that supports many different protocols, such as [[Secure Shell|SSH]], [[FTP over SSH|SFTP]], [[FTP]], [[FTPS]], [[Secure copy|SCP]], and RExec. It also supports FTP over SSL. eSSH Client has a rich [[GUI]] design that allows multiple access channels at the same time, and has an internal window design that allows all the connections to be viewed from within a main window. It also has a tabbed Secure Shell window with named sessions. eSSH Client supports proxies, [[SOCKS4]] and [[SOCKS5]], port forwarding, [[X11]] forwarding, encryption management, password and public key authentication, key pair generation, profile management, host key management, different screen emulations for secure shell, and an easy to use GUI. eSSH Client also has an integrated editor that allows to securely edit files on a remote server. it allows docking of a secure shell window to the editor for ease of use. This software is available in [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Japan]] only.

The ETA10 was announced in 1986, with the first deliveries made in early 1987. The system was an evolution of the [[CDC Cyber#Cyber 200 series|CDC Cyber 205]], which can trace its origins back to the [[CDC STAR-100]]. ==Historical development== CDC had a strong history of creating powerful mainframe computers, with an emphasis on the scientific computing customer base. One of the most famous computer architects to emerge from CDC was [[Seymour Cray]]. While he went on to form his own company, [[Cray Research]], work continued at CDC in developing high-end mainframe computers ([[supercomputer]]s)&mdash;led by another famous architect, Neil Lincoln. As Cray competed against CDC, it became apparent to top management that it needed to decrease the development time for the next generation computer&mdash;thus a new approach was considered for the follow-on to the Cyber 205. After being spun off from CDC in September 1983, ETA had the goal of producing a supercomputer with a cycle time under 10ns. To accomplish this goal, several innovations were made by ETA. Among these
