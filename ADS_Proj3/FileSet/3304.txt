soft page break markings, table header markings, presentation navigation markings, alternative text and captions, and specifically stating that spreadsheets may be embedded in presentations. Peter Korn (an accessibility expert) reviewed version 1.1 “to satisfy myself that all of our accessibility concerns have been addressed”, and declared “I am so satisfied.”<ref>http://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/office/email/archives/200607/msg00089.html</ref><ref>http://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/office-accessibility/download.php/19301/ODF-v1.1-draft7_a11y_requirements_review.odt</ref> ===Implementations=== [[Peter Korn]] gave an in-depth report<ref>{{Cite web | title = Massachusetts, Open Document, and Accessibility | publisher = Sun | date = 2005-11-13 | url = http://blogs.sun.com/korn/date/20051113 | accessdate = 2007-02-02 }}</ref> on OpenDocument accessibility. He noted that there are many kinds of impairments, including visual (minor, major, or blind), physical (minor, major with vocal control, major without vocal control), auditory, and [[cognitive]]. He then noted that the situation varies, depending on the specific disability. For a vast number of disabilities, there are no known problems, though. * OpenOffice.org is expected to work well with existing solutions in MS Windows' [[on-screen keyboard]]s (etc.) when driven by single-[[switch access]], [[head-mouse]], and [[eye-gaze]] systems. On Unix-like systems, [[GNOME]]'s “On-screen Keyboard” goes far beyond Microsoft Windows' capabilities, because it can use the [http://projects.gnome.org/accessibility/ GNOME accessibility project] architecture. Also available on both Linux and Windows systems is [[Dasher]], a [[GPL]]ed text-entry alternative for head-mouse and eye-gaze users (35+ word-per-minute typing speeds using nothing but [[Eye movement (sensory)|eye movement]] are possible). * If those with disabilities are already using Microsoft Office, then a [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] enabling them to load and save OpenDocument files using Microsoft Office may give them the same capabilities they already have (assuming the opening/saving cycle is accessible). So from that perspective, OpenDocument is at least as accessible as Microsoft Office. The primary problem is that Microsoft Windows does not have a real accessibility infrastructure compared to UNIX-like systems with [[GNOME]], the [[Java platform]], or [[Mac OS X]]. * For users using alternatives to Microsoft Office there may be problems, not necessarily due to the ODF file format but rather due to the lower investment to date by assistive technology vendors on these platforms, though there is ongoing work. For example, [[IBM]] has stated that its “Workplace productivity tools available through Workplace Managed Client including word processing, spreadsheet and presentation editors are currently planned to be fully accessible on a Windows platform by 2007. Additionally, these productivity tools are currently planned to be fully accessible on a Linux platform by 2008” (Sutor, November 10, 2005). It is important to note that since OpenDocument is an [[Open Standard]] file format, there is no need for everyone to use the same program to read and write OpenDocument files; someone with a disability is free to use whatever program works best for them. ==See also== * [[Comparison of OpenDocument software]] * [[Network effect]] * [[Open format]] * [[Office suite]] * [[Office Open XML]] ==References== {{Reflist|3}} {{Refbegin}} * Korn, Peter (November 13, 2005). * [http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/korn/20051113 Massachusetts, Open Document, and Accessibility] * Parris, D.C.

OpenDrive allows users to manage their content stored in the cloud by using website, drive or desktop applications. Third party applications or websites can access or manage users' files through [[Application programming interface|API]]. ==History== OpenDrive, which started as a virtual drive in 2008 during past few years became a multiplatform solution for online storage, syncing, backup and cloud content management. OpenDrive’s strategy is not only to be a online storage, backup and syncing software, but also a centralized solution with integration of storage, apps and services such as tasks, social networks, project management within single interface to create uniform experience accessible from anywhere. Beyond the unique services like selling files, advertising files, a file search engine, direct hotlinking, an API, as well as its virtual drive and virtual desktop applications, OpenDrive provides sharing, syncing, online editing, file collaboration, file versioning and other features to allow the user manage cloud content smarter and faster than ever before. ==Link to Website== https://www.opendrive.com/ [[Category:File hosting]] [[Category:Cloud computing]] [[Category:Online backup services]] [[Category:Cloud storage]]</text> </page> <page> <id>27361</id> <title>OpenEXR</title> <text>{{Cleanup|date=July 2008}} '''OpenEXR''' is a [[high dynamic range imaging]] [[image file format]], released as an [[open standard]] along with a set of software tools created by [[Industrial Light and Magic]] (ILM), released under a [[free software license]] similar to the [[BSD license]]. It is notable for supporting 16-bits-per-channel [[floating point]] values ([[half precision]]), with a sign bit, five bits of exponent, and a ten-bit [[Significand|mantissa]]. This allows a dynamic range of over thirty [[f-stop|stop]]s of exposure. Both [[Lossless data compression|lossless]] and [[Lossy data compression|lossy compression]] of high dynamic range data is also supported.<ref name="technical_introduction">[http://www.openexr.com/TechnicalIntroduction.pdf Technical introduction: Data Compression]</ref> == OpenEXR Overview == For a full technical introduction of OpenEXR, see the Technical Introduction available on the OpenEXR.org website.<ref name="technical_introduction"/> OpenEXR, or simply EXR for short, is a deep raster format developed by ILM and very broadly used in the computer-graphics industry, both visual effects and animation. OpenEXR's multi-resolution and arbitrary channel format makes it appealing for compositing. OpenEXR alleviates several painful elements of the compositing process. Since it can
