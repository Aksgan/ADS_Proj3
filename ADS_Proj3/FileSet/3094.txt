Its purpose is to facilitate access to data and information on the biological resources of the [[United States]], utilizing government agencies, academic institutions, non-government organizations, and private industry. The NBII coordinates the research output of the biological community into information systems that are easily accessed, by providing organization and a structure that is based on standards. The structure is essentially invisible to the end user of the information, but is vitally important to those wishing to participate by making data available through the system, or becoming partners in the development of new tools, models, and applications. <ref name= "Schiller"> Schiller, Nicholas (March 2007) "Internet Reviews: National Biological Information Infrastructure" ''[[College & Research Libraries News]]'' 68(3): p. 191</ref> The end-user aspect of the NBII is its Web portal which provides access to information, publications, and data from the various data sources "in a seamless, unified portal."<ref name= "Schiller"/> ==History== The NBII is an outgrowth of a 1993 [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] report titled "A Biological Survey for the Nation"<ref>[http://books.nap.edu/html/bio/ National Research Council (1993) ''A Biological Survey for the Nation'' National Academy of Sciences, Washington, DC], ISBN 0-309-04984-0</ref>, which recommended that the [[United States Department of the Interior]] oversee the development of a National Biotic Resource Information System to coordinate information about biodiversity and ecosystems. The report found that such information was "vital to a wide range of scientific, educational, and government uses," but that, unfortunately, most of the information existed in forms that were not easily used. It envisioned a system of distributed databases designed to make the existing information more accessible. The report also suggested that new ways to collect and distribute data and information should be developed. It did mention networking, but not the Internet. .<ref name="Sepic">Sepic, Ron and Kase, Kate (2002) "The National Biological Information Infrastructure as an E-Government tool" ''Government Information Quarterly'' 19(4): pp. 407-24</ref> As a first step, in 1994, [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] signed Executive Order 12906, "Coordinating Geographic Data Acquisition and Access: the [[National Spatial Data Infrastructure]]".<ref>[http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/eo12906.htm "Coordinating Geographic Data Acquisition and Access: the [[National Spatial Data Infrastructure]]" Presidential Executive Order 12906 (April 11, 1994)]</ref> National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) deals with the acquisition, processing, storage, and distribution of geospatial (geographically referenced) data. In conjunction with this, but without a presidential order, former Secretary of the Interior [[Bruce Babbitt]] renamed the national biotic resource information system as the National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII). In 1996 the Office of Management and Budget [[Circular A-130]], the document which directs the management of federal information resources in the United States, was amended to include the NBII. Funding and support for the NBII did not develop as quickly as the scientific community hoped, and in 1998, the [[PCAST|President's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology]] released a report "Teaming With Life: Investing in Science to Understand and Use America's Living Capital"<ref>[http://www.ostp.gov/Environment/html/teamingcover.html Presidentâ€™s Committee of Advisors for Science and Technology (March 1998) ''Teaming With Life: Investing in Science to Understand and Use America's Living Capital'' Office of Science and Technology Policy, Washington, DC], [http://worldcat.org/oclc/38836916 OCLC 38836916]</ref> which urged that current information technology be applied to the management of science information, and reiterated the findings of the 1993 report. In 2001 money was finally appropriated for the development of the system of NBII networked nodes, though far below the level recommended in the report. In implementing this system, the USGS is designing each aspect of the system to focus on a narrowly defined scope (often geographic) or purpose.<ref>[http://www.nbii.gov/images/uploaded/8496_1165171745477_NBII-Overview-wMap.pdf "A Closer Look at the NBII and NBII Nodes" ''National Biological Information Infrastructure'']</ref> For example, the ''Southwest Information Node'' focuses on desert ecosystems.<ref>Frame, Michael T. (2002) "Information Science and Technology Developments Within the National Biological Information Infrastructure" ''Science & Technology Libraries'' 23(4): p. 59</ref> ==International Initiatives== The NBII is involved with a range of international initiatives including: # "[[Global Biodiversity Information Facility]]" (GBIF) # "[[Inter-American Biodiversity Information Network]]" (IABIN) # "[[Invasive Species Information Network for the Americas]]" (I3N) # "[[Pollinators Thematic Network: A Network for Pollinator Information and Expertise in the Western Hemisphere]]" (PTN), primarily an IABIN initiative. # "[[Global Invasive Species Information Network]]" # "[[FishBase for the Americas]]: Improving Access to Western Hemisphere Fisheries" is a partnership of [[FishBase]], the [[Inter-American Biodiversity Information Network]] (IABIN) and the NBII Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (FAR) Node. ==Reviews== Early on researchers found the NBII coordination less than expected. The NBII navigation buttons on the ''Invasive Species'' databases had confusing topic labels especially when compared with the National Agricultural Library labels. <ref name="Case">Case, Susan B. (February 2002) "Internet reviews: Invasivespecies.gov" ''College & Research Libraries News'' 63(2): p. 133</ref> The switching back and forth between the portal and the databases was "a tedious exercise indeed."<ref name="Case"/> Nonetheless, the Federation of Government Information Processing Councils awarded the NBII a 2002 Award for Outstanding Intergovernmental Technology Solutions.<ref name="Sepic"/> Due to the extensive amount and array of resources and data available, users may need to both browse and search to locate specific information of interest.
