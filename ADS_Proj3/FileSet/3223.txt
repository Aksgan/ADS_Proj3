Novell superseded NetWare with [[Novell Open Enterprise Server|Open Enterprise Server]] (OES) from 2005. The latest version of NetWare is v6.5 Support Pack 8, which is identical to OES 2 SP1, NetWare Kernel. == History == NetWare evolved from a very simple concept: file sharing instead of disk sharing. In 1983 when the first versions of NetWare originated, all other competing products were based on the concept of providing shared direct disk access. Novell's alternative approach was validated by [[IBM]] in 1984, which helped promote the NetWare product. Novell NetWare shared disk-space in the form of NetWare ''volumes'', comparable to DOS volumes. Clients running [[MS-DOS]] would run a special [[terminate and stay resident]] (TSR) program that allowed them to ''map'' a local drive letter to a NetWare volume. Clients had to log in to a server in order to be allowed to map volumes, and access could be restricted according to the login name. Similarly, they could connect to shared printers on the dedicated server, and print as if the printer was connected locally. At the end of the 1990s, with [[Internet]] connectivity booming, the Internet's [[TCP/IP]] protocol became dominant on [[local area network|LAN]]s. Novell had introduced limited TCP/IP support in NetWare v3.x (circa 1992) and v4.x (circa 1995), consisting mainly of FTP services and UNIX-style LPR/LPD printing (available in NetWare v3.x), and a Novell-developed webserver (in NetWare v4.x). Native TCP/IP support for the client file and print services normally associated with NetWare was introduced in NetWare v5.0 (released in 1998). During the early-to-mid 1980s [[Microsoft]] introduced their own LAN system in [[LAN Manager]], based on the competing [[NetBIOS Frames protocol|NBF]] protocol. Early attempts to muscle in on NetWare failed, but this changed with the inclusion of improved networking support in [[Windows for Workgroups]], and then the hugely successful [[Windows NT]] and [[Windows 95]]. NT, in particular, offered services similar to those offered by NetWare, but on a system that could also be used on a desktop, and connected directly to other Windows desktops where NBF was now almost universal. === The rise of NetWare === The popular use and growth of Novell NetWare began in 1985 with the simultaneous release of NetWare 286 2.0a and the [[Intel 80286]] 16-bit processor. The 80286 CPU featured a new 16-bit protected mode that provided access to up to 16 MB RAM as well as new mechanisms to aid multi-tasking. (Prior to the 80286, PC CPU servers used the Intel [[8086]]/[[8088]] 8/16-bit processors, which were limited to an address space of 1MB with not more than 640 KB of directly addressable RAM.) The combination of a higher 16 MB RAM limit, 80286 processor feature utilization, and 256 MB NetWare volume size limit (compared to the 32 MB that MS-DOS allowed at that time) allowed the building of reliable, cost-effective server-based local area networks for the first time. The 16 MB RAM limit was especially important, since it made enough RAM available for disk caching to significantly improve performance. This became the key to Novell's performance while also allowing larger networks to be built. In another significant innovation, NetWare 286 was hardware-independent, unlike competing server systems from 3Com. Novell servers could be assembled using any brand system with an Intel 80286 or higher CPU, any [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]], [[Run Length Limited|RLL]], [[Enhanced Small Disk Interface|ESDI]], or [[SCSI]] hard drive and any 8- or 16-bit network adapter for which Netware drivers were available. Novell also designed a compact and simple DOS-client software program that allowed DOS stations to connect to a server and access the shared-server hard drive. While the NetWare server file system introduced a new, proprietary file-system design, it looked like a standard DOS volume to the workstation, ensuring compatibility with all existing DOS programs. === Early years === NetWare originated from consulting work by [[SuperSet]] Software, a group founded by the friends [[Drew Major]], Dale Neibaur, Kyle Powell and later Mark Hurst. This work stemmed from their classwork at [[Brigham Young University]] in [[Provo, Utah]], starting in October [[1981]]. In [[1983]], [[Raymond Noorda]] engaged{{Clarify|date=May 2010}} the work by the SuperSet team. The team was originally assigned to create a [[CP/M]] [[disk sharing]] system to help network the CP/M hardware that Novell sold at the time. The team was privately convinced that CP/M was a doomed platform and instead came up with a successful file-sharing system for the newly introduced IBM-compatible [[Personal computer|PC]]. They also wrote an application called [[Snipes]] - a text-mode game - and used it to test the new network and demonstrate its capabilities. Snipes was the first network application ever written for a commercial personal computer, and it is recognized as one of the precursors of many popular multiplayer games such as ''[[Doom (video game)|Doom]]'' and ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]''.<ref>[http://www.textmodegames.com/download/snipes.html Text Mode Games - Snipes]</ref> This [[network operating system]] (NOS) was later called Novell NetWare. NetWare was based on the [[NetWare Core Protocol]] (NCP), which is a packet-based protocol that enables a client to send requests to and receive replies from a NetWare server. Initially NCP was directly tied to the [[IPX/SPX]] protocol, and NetWare communicated natively using only IPX/SPX. The first product to bear the NetWare name was released in 1983. It was called Netware 68 (aka [[Novell S-Net|S-Net]]); it ran on the [[Motorola]] [[68000]] processor on a proprietary Novell-built file server and used a star [[network topology]]. This was soon joined by NetWare 86 V4.x, which was written for the [[Intel 8086]]. This was replaced in 1985 with Advanced NetWare 86 version 1.0a which allowed more than one server on the same network. In 1986, after the [[Intel 80286]] processor became available, Novell released Advanced NetWare 286 V1.0a and subsequently V2.0B (that used IPX
