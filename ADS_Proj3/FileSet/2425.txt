It has a wide range of features, similar to those of [[Kismet (software)|Kismet]] (its [[Linux]]/[[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] namesake). The program is geared toward network security professionals, and is not as novice-friendly as similar applications.

KisMAC will scan for networks passively on supported cards - including Apple's [[Apple AirPort|AirPort]], and [[AirPort Extreme]], and many third-party cards, and actively on any card supported by Mac OS X itself. Cracking of [[Wired Equivalent Privacy|WEP]] and [[Wi-Fi Protected Access|WPA]] keys, both by [[brute force attack|brute force]], and exploiting flaws such as weak scheduling and badly generated keys is supported when a card capable of monitor mode is used, and packet reinjection can be done with a supported card ([[Prism2]] and some [[Ralink]] cards). [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] mapping can be performed when an [[NMEA]] compatible GPS receiver is attached.<ref>{{citeweb|title=gpsd â€” a GPS service daemon|url=http://gpsd.berlios.de GPSd|publisher=berlios.de|accessdate=2008-02-22}}</ref> Data can also be saved in pcap format and loaded into programs such as [[Wireshark]]. ==KisMAC Features== * Reveals hidden / cloaked / closed SSIDs * Shows logged in clients (with MAC Addresses, IP addresses and signal strengths) * Mapping and GPS support * Can draw area maps of network coverage * PCAP import and export * Support for 802.11b/g * Different attacks against encrypted networks * Deauthentication attacks * AppleScript-able * Kismet drone support (capture from a Kismet drone) ==KisMAC and Germany== The project was created and led by [[Michael Rossberg]] until July 27, 2007, when he removed himself from the project due to changes in German law (specifically, [[Strafgesetzbuch|StGB]] Section 202c) that "prohibits the production and distribution of security software".<ref>{{citeweb|title=Germany says goodbye KisMAC!|url=http://www.kismac.de|publisher=kismac.de|accessdate=2008-02-22}}</ref> On this date, project lead was passed on to [[Geoffrey Kruse]], maintainer of KisMAC since 2003, and active developer since 2001. KisMAC is actively being developed. Primary development, and the relocated KisMAC web site are now based in the [[United States]]. The KisMAC project can be found at http://kismac-ng.org/ . As of August 6, 2007, the former homepage now denounces the new German law. ==See also== {{Portal|Free Software}} * [[Aircrack-ng]] * [[iStumbler]] * [[Kismet (software)|Kismet]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== *[http://kismac-ng.org/ Current homepage] *[http://trac.kismac-ng.org/wiki/Downloads Binaries of latest versions] *[http://trac.kismac-ng.org/wiki/NewbieGuide/ KisMAC Newbie Guide] *[http://kismac.de/ Former homepage] *[http://svn.kismac-ng.org/kmng/ KisMAC Svn] [[Category:Wireless networking]] [[Category:Mac OS X-only free software]] [[Category:Mac OS X software]] [[Category:Network analyzers]] [[el:KisMAC]] [[fr:KisMAC]] [[pt:KisMAC]] [[sv:Kismac]]</text> </page> <page> <id>20711</id> <title>Kismet (software)</title> <text>{{Infobox software | name = Kismet | screenshot = [[Image:Kismet-2.7.1-screenshot.gif|250px]] | caption = Kismet 2.7.1 | developer = Mike Kershaw (dragorn) | latest release version = Kismet-2010-07-R1 | latest release date = {{release date|2010|07|13}} | operating system = [[Cross-platform]] | programming language = [[C++]] | genre = [[Packet Sniffer]] | license = [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] | website = http://www.kismetwireless.net/ }} '''Kismet''' is a [[network detector]], [[packet sniffer]], and [[Intrusion-detection system|intrusion detection system]] for [[802.11]] [[wireless LAN]]s. Kismet will work with any wireless card which supports [[Monitor mode|raw monitoring mode]], and can sniff [[802.11a]], [[802.11b]], [[802.11g]], and [[802.11n]] traffic. The program runs under [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD]], [[OpenBSD]], and [[Mac OS X]]. The client can also run on [[Microsoft Windows]], although, aside from external drones{{Clarify|date=November 2010}}, there's only one supported wireless hardware available as packet source. Distributed under the [[GNU General Public License]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kismetwireless.net/documentation.shtml|title=Kismet Readme|publisher=kismetwireless.net|accessdate=2008-02-22}}</ref> Kismet is [[free software]]. ==Features== Kismet is unlike most other wireless network detectors in that it works passively. This means that without sending any loggable packets, it is able to detect the presence of both [[wireless access point]]s and wireless clients, and associate them with each other. [[Image:Kismet Key.png|thumb|right|An explanation of the headings displayed in Kismet.]] Kismet also includes basic wireless [[Intrusion-detection system|IDS]] features such as detecting ''active'' wireless sniffing programs including [[NetStumbler]], as well as a number of wireless network attacks. Kismet has the ability to log all sniffed packets and save them in a [[tcpdump]]/[[Wireshark]] or [[Airsnort]] compatible fileformat. Kismet also captures PPI headers. Kismet also has the ability to detect default or "not configured" networks, probe requests, and determine what levels of wireless encryptions is used on a given access point. To find as many networks as possible, kismet supports channelhopping. This means that it constantly changes from channel to channel non-sequentially, in a user-defined sequence with a default value that leaves big holes between channels (for example 1-6-11-2-7-12-3-8-13-4-9-14-5-10). The advantage with this method is that it will capture more packets because adjacent channels overlap. Kismet also supports logging of the geographical coordinates of the network if the input from a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receiver is additionally available. == Server / Drone / Client infrastructure == Kismet has three separate parts. A ''drone'' can be used to collect packets, and then pass them on to a ''server'' for interpretation. A server can either be used in conjunction with a drone, or on its own, interpreting packet data, and extrapolating wireless information, and organizing it. The ''client'' communicates with the server and displays the information the server collects. ==Plugins== With the updating of Kismet to -ng, Kismet now supports a wide variety of scanning plugins including [[Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications]], Bluetooth, and others. ==See also== {{Portal|Free software}} * [[KisMAC]] (for Mac OS X) ==References== {{Reflist|2}} ==External links== * [http://www.kismetwireless.net/ Official Website] * [http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/tutorials/article.php/3595531 Introduction to Kismet] * [http://blogs.iium.edu.my/jaiz/2010/01/19/the-best-of-top-ten-packet-sniffer-2010/ The best of Top Ten Packet Sniffer 2010] {{DEFAULTSORT:Kismet (Software)}} [[Category:Network analyzers]] [[Category:Wireless networking]] [[de:Kismet (Sniffer)]] [[el:Kismet]] [[es:Kismet]] [[fr:Kismet (programme)]] [[it:Kismet (software)]] [[ja:Kismet]] [[pl:Kismet (program)]] [[pt:Kismet]] [[ru:Kismet]] [[sv:Kismet (datorprogram)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>20719</id> <title>Kiwibox</title> <text>{{orphan|date=December 2009}} {{Infobox Website | name = Kiwibox | favicon = | logo = [[File:kiwibox logo.gif]] | screenshot = | caption = | url = [http://www.kiwibox.com/ www.kiwibox.com] | type = [[social network service]] | registration = Yes | owner = Kiwibox.com, Inc. | launch date = 1999 | current status = Active }} '''Kiwibox.com'''
