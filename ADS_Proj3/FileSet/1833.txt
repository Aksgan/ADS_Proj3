The entry existed in the very earliest forms of the Jargon File, dating from the early 1980s. A typical tech usage from the ''Linux Bible, 2005'' characterizes the [[Unix]] [[software development]] philosophy as "one that can make your life a lot simpler once you grok the idea". The book ''[[Perl Best Practices]]'' defines "grok" as understanding a portion of computer code in a profound way. It goes on to suggest that to "re-grok" code is to reload the intricacies of that portion of code into one's memory after some time has passed and all the details of it are no longer remembered. In that sense, to "grok" means to load everything into memory for immediate use. It is analogous to the way a processor [[cache]]s memory for short term use, but the only implication by this reference was that it was something that a human (or maybe a martian) would do. ===Mainstream usage=== {{trivia|date=October 2010}} In their book ''The Fourth Turning'', [[Strauss and Howe|William Strauss and Neil Howe]] write of [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996 Presidential candidate]] [[Bob Dole]] as "not a person who could grok values in the now-dominant [[Baby boomer|Boomer]] tongue". In a 1987 ''[[Life In Hell]]'' strip titled "What I Learned In School", a character representing ''[[The Simpsons]]'' creator [[Matt Groening]] is depicted being [[wikt:dress down|dressed down]] by an unseen "hip" [[college]] [[professor]]: "Mr. Gru-nink, I'm getting bad vibes from you.

Songwriter Stephin Merritt uses "grok" in the song "Swinging London", from the 1994 Magnetic Fields album "Holiday" - "you couldn't grok my race car but you dug the roadside blur".{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} In an episode of ''[[Night Court]]'', Judge Harry Stone asks what "grok" is. Bailiff Bull Shannon responds that it is "[a] sudden flash of insight derived from a profound empathetic experience."{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} In Episode 67 "The Secret Life of Ricky Stratton" of the 1985 television show ''[[Silver Spoons]]'', Rickie calls chatting on a BBS "grokking".{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} In episode 12 of season 2 of the Spectacular Spider-Man, Spider-Man refers to his spider-sense saying, "can't grok where the next..." In the song "Friends", by [[The Police]], the lyrics state that the singer will "grok your essence".{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The phrase "grok your essence" is also referenced in the science fiction role playing game, Fallout 2.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In the straight-to-DVD [[Futurama]] outing [[Into the Wild Green Yonder]] Number 9 of the Legion of Madfellows says their group has "been grokking some super weird junk" from the life force [[Ch'i]]. The Legion of Madfellows are a group of (crazy, homeless) mindreaders that defend the universe.

It is run and edited by [[Pamela Jones]] and complements her [[Groklaw]] website, which acts as a focus for legal news of interest to the Free and Open Source Software communities, including in particular [[SCO Group]]'s [[SCO v. IBM|litigation]] against [[IBM]] and others and its attacks on [[Linux]]. The purpose of the website is to collect comprehensive information on the many commercial and non-commercial releases of UNIX and UNIX-like code, so as to reduce or eliminate the scope for superficially plausible but ultimately invalid [[copyright]], [[patent]] and [[trade secret]] claims against Linux or other free and open source software. The antecedents of Grokline are the SCO legal actions, Groklaw, and Eric Levenez' Unix History chart, which shows the technical relationship between different UNIX releases as a family tree. The logic underlying the site is that pooled community information can: * Assist in establishing as a fact the open nature of UNIX code, or * Identify UNIX code which is not open source, to assist in guarding against its inclusion in open source code offerings. In December 2005, Grokline was taken off-line while Groklaw's volunteer administrators worked to separate the patent software used by Grokline, which does not belong to Groklaw, from the Grokline software, which Groklaw owns.<ref>In this [http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060205142052312#c405499 comment] on Groklaw, Pamela Jones explains why Grokline is currently off-line.
