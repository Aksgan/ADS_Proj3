to create, run, monitor and terminate [[virtual machine]]s. The VMM provides services that manage memory, processes, interrupts and protection faults. The VMM works with virtual devices (loadable kernel modules, which consist mostly of 32-bit ring 0 or kernel mode code, but may include other types of code, such as a 16-bit real mode initialisation segment) to allow those virtual devices to intercept interrupts and faults to control the access that an application has to hardware devices and installed software. Both the VMM and virtual device drivers run in a single, 32-bit, flat model address space at privilege level 0 (also called ring 0). The VMM provides multi-threaded, [[preemptive multitasking]]. It runs multiple applications simultaneously by sharing CPU ([[central processing unit]]) time between the threads in which the applications and virtual machines run. The VMM is also responsible for creating MS-DOS environments for system processes and Windows applications that still need to run in MS-DOS mode. It is the replacement for Win386 in Windows 3.x, and the file vmm32.vxd is a compressed archive containing most of the core VxD, including VMM.vxd itself and ifsmgr.vxd (which facilitates file system access without the need to call the real mode file system code of the DOS kernel). ===Software Support=== ====File Systems==== Windows 9x does not natively support [[NTFS]] or [[High Performance File System|HPFS]], but there are third-party solutions which allow Windows 9x to have read-only access to NTFS volumes. Early versions of Windows 95 did not support [[FAT32]]. Like [[Windows for Workgroups 3.11]], Windows 9x provides support for [[32-bit file access]], and unlike Windows 3.x, Windows 9x has support for the VFAT file system, allowing [[long filename|file names]] with a maximum of 255 characters instead of having [[8.3 filename]]s. ====Event Logging and Tracing==== Also, there is no support for [[Tracing (software)|event logging and tracing]] or [[Windows Error Reporting|error reporting]] which the Windows NT family of operating systems has, although software like [[Norton CrashGuard]] can be used to achieve similar capabilities on Windows 9x. ====Security==== {{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}} Windows 9x is designed as a single-user system. Thus, the security model is much less effective than the one in Windows NT. One reason for this is the [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] [[file system]]s (including FAT12/16/32), which are the only ones that Windows 9x supports officially, though Windows NT also supports FAT 12 and 16 (but not 32) and Windows 9x can be extended to read and write NTFS volumes using third-party [[Installable File System]] drivers. FAT systems have very limited security; every user that has access to a FAT drive also has access to all files on that drive. The FAT file systems provide no [[access control list]]s and [[Encrypting File System|file-system level encryption]] like [[NTFS]].<ref>[http://www.theeldergeek.com/ntfs_or_fat32_file_system.htm FAT32 or NTFS: Making the choice - Theeldergeek.com]</ref> Some operating systems that were available at the same time as Windows 9x are either [[multi-user]] or have multiple user accounts with different access privileges, which allows important system files (such as the kernel image) to be immutable under most user accounts. In contrast, while Windows 95 and later operating systems offer the option of having profiles for multiple users, they have no concept of access privileges, making them roughly equivalent to a single-user, single-account operating system; this means that all [[Process (computing)|processes]] can modify all files on the system that aren't open, in addition to being able to modify the boot sector and perform other low-level hard drive modifications. This enables viruses and other clandestinely installed software to integrate themselves with the operating system in a way that is difficult for ordinary users to detect or undo. The profile support in the Windows 9x family is meant for convenience only; unless some registry keys are modified, the system can be accessed by pressing "Cancel" at login, even if all profiles have a password. Windows 95's default login dialog box also allows new user profiles to be created without having to log in first. Users and software can render the operating system unable to function by deleting or overwriting important system files from the hard disk. Users and software are also free to change configuration files in such a way that the operating system is unable to boot or properly function. Installation software often replaced and deleted system files without properly checking if the file was still in use or of a newer version. This created a phenomenon often referred to as [[DLL hell]]. Windows Me introduced [[System File Protection]] and [[System Restore]] to handle common problems caused by this issue. [[DOS]]'s [[FAT]] and [[FAT32]] [[filesystems|filesystem]] inhereited by Windows 9x have neither file protection nor [[file permissions]] of [[NTFS]]. ====Network Sharing==== Windows 9x offers share-level access control security for file and printer sharing as well as user-level access control if a Windows NT based operating system is available on the network.<ref>[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc768179.aspx Chapter 9 - Security: Windows 98 Resource Kit]</ref> In contrast, Windows NT-based operating systems offer only user-level access control but integrated with the operating system's own user account security mechanism. ===Hardware Support=== ====Drivers==== [[Device driver]]s in Windows 9x can be virtual device drivers or (starting with Windows 98) WDM drivers. VxDs usually have the [[filename extension]] <tt>.vxd</tt> or <tt>.386</tt>, whereas WDM compatible drivers usually use the extension <tt>[[.sys]]</tt>. The 32-bit VxD message server (msgsrv32) is a program that is able to load virtual device drivers (VxDs) at startup and then handle communication with the drivers. Additionally, the message server performs several background functions, including loading the Windows shell (such as [[Explorer.exe]] or [[Progman.exe]]).<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=138708 Function of the Windows 32-Bit message server - Microsoft Help and Support]</ref> Another type of device drivers are <tt>.DRV</tt> drivers. These drivers are loaded in user-mode, and are commonly used to control devices such as multimedia devices. To provide access to these devices, a [[dynamic link library]] is required (such as MMSYSTEM.DLL). Drivers written for Windows 9x/Windows Me are loaded into the same address space as the kernel. This means that drivers can by accident or design overwrite critical sections of the operating system. Doing this can lead to
