was so superior to pre-relational systems that it was copied, based on pre-launch papers presented at conferences, by [[Larry Ellison]] in his [[Oracle Database]], which actually reached market before [[SQL/DS]] — due to the then-already proprietary status of the original name, SEQUEL had been renamed [[SQL]]. Codd continued to develop and extend his relational model, sometimes in collaboration with [[Christopher J. Date|Chris Date]]. One of the [[Database normalization|normalized forms]], the [[Boyce-Codd normal form]], is named after him. [[Codd's theorem]], a result proven in his seminal work on the relational model, equates the expressive power of [[relational algebra]] and [[relational calculus]] (which, in essence, is equivalent to [[first-order logic]]). As the relational model started to become fashionable in the early 1980s, Codd fought a sometimes bitter campaign to prevent the term being misused by database vendors who had merely added a relational veneer to older technology. As part of this campaign, he published his [[Codd's 12 rules|12 rules]] to define what constituted a relational database. This made his position in [[IBM]] increasingly difficult, so he left to form his own consulting company with [[Chris Date]] and others. Edgar Codd coined the term ''[[OLAP]]'' and wrote the twelve laws of online analytical processing, although these were never truly accepted after it came out that his white paper on the subject was paid for by a software vendor. His last work, a book named ''The Relational Model for Database Management, version 2'', was not so well received {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}. On the other hand, his extension of the ideas in the relational model to cover database design issues, in his [[Relational Model/Tasmania|RM/T]], have proved important {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}. Codd also contributed knowledge in the area of [[cellular automata]].<ref name=Codd68>{{cite book|author = Codd, Edgar F.|title=Cellular Automata|publisher=Academic Press, New York|year=1968}}</ref> In 2004, [[SIGMOD]] renamed its highest prize to the [[SIGMOD Edgar F.

This is a labeling for ''simple graphs'', namely ones in which no two distinct edges connect the same two distinct vertices, no edge connects a vertex to itself, and the graph is connected. Edge-graceful labelings were first introduced by S. Lo in his seminal paper<ref>On Edge-Graceful labelings of graphs</ref>. == Definition == Given a graph ''G'', we denote the set of edges by ''E''(''G'') and the vertices by ''V''(''G''). Let q be the cardinality of ''E''(''G'') and ''p'' be that of ''V''(''G''). Once a labeling of the edges is given, a vertex ''u'' of the graph is labeled by the sum of the labels of the edges incident to it, modulo ''p''. Or, in symbols, the induced labeling on the vertex ''u'' is given by :<math>V(u)=\Sigma E(e) \mod |V(G)|</math> where ''V''(''u'') is the label for the vertex and ''E''(''e'') is the assigned value of an edge incident to ''u''. The problem is to find a labeling for the edges such that all the labels from 1 to ''q'' are used once and the induced labels on the vertices run from 0 to ''p'' − 1. In other words, the resulting set for labels of the edges should be <math>\{1,2 \dots q\}</math> and <math>\{0,1 \dots p-1\}</math> for the vertices. A graph ''G'' is said to be edge-graceful if it admits an edge-graceful labeling. == Examples == === Paths === Consider a [[path (graph theory)|path]] with two vertices, ''P''<sub>2</sub>. Here the only possibility is to label the only edge in the graph 1. The induces labeling on the two vertices are both 1. So ''P''<sub>2</sub> is not edge-graceful. Appending an edge and a vertex to ''P''<sub>2</sub> gives ''P''<sub>3</sub>, the path with three vertices. Denote the vertices by ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>2</sub>, and ''v''<sub>3</sub>. Label the two edges in the following way: the
