link that name to the person's profile page, if such a page exists. *'''Cite the work's title or name (if applicable)''', if such a thing exists. If the work is being published on the Internet, it is nice to link the name or title directly to the original work. *'''Cite the specific CC license the work is under (optional)'''. If the work is being published on the Internet, it is nice if the license citation links to the license on the CC website. *'''Mention if the work is a derivative work or adaptation''', in addition to the above, one needs to identify that their work is a derivative work i.e., “This is a Finnish translation of [original work] by [author].” or “Screenplay based on [original work] by [author].” == Applicable works == Work licensed under a Creative Commons License is governed by applicable copyright law.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/au/legalcode |title=Creative Commons Legal Code |date=January 9, 2008 |publisher=[[Creative Commons]] |accessdate=February 22, 2010}}</ref> This allows Creative Commons licenses to be applied to all work falling under copyright, including: books, plays, movies, music, articles, photographs, blogs, and websites. Creative Commons does not recommend the use of Creative Commons licenses for software.<ref>[http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ#Can_I_use_a_Creative_Commons_license_for_software.3F Creative Commons FAQ: Can I use a Creative Commons license for software?]</ref> However, application of a Creative Commons license may not modify the rights allowed by fair use or fair dealing or exert restrictions which violate copyright exceptions. Furthermore, Creative Commons Licenses are non-exclusive and non-revocable. Any work or copies of the work obtained under a Creative Commons license may continue to be used under that license. In the case of works protected by multiple Creative Common Licenses, the user may choose either. ==Other licenses== A number of additional licenses have been introduced, which are more specialized: *[[Sampling (music)|Sampling]] licenses, with two options: **'''Sampling Plus''': parts of the work can be copied and modified for any purpose other than advertising, and the entire work can be copied for noncommercial purposes<ref>{{cite web |url=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/sampling+/1.0/ |title=Sampling Plus 1.0 |date=November 13, 2009 |publisher=[[Creative Commons]] |accessdate=February 22, 2010}}</ref> **'''Noncommercial Sampling Plus''': the whole work or parts of the work can be copied and modified for noncommercial purposes<ref>{{cite web |url=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/nc-sampling+/1.0/ |title=Creative Commons — NonCommercial Sampling Plus 1.0|date=November 13, 2009 |publisher=[[Creative Commons]] |accessdate=February 22, 2010}}</ref> == Retired licenses == Due to either disuse or criticism, a number of previously offered Creative Commons licenses have since been retired<ref>{{cite web |url=http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7520 |title=Retiring standalone DevNations and one Sampling license |accessdate= July 5, 2007 |publisher=[[Creative Commons]] |date=June 4, 2007 |first=Lawrence |last=Lessig |authorlink=Lawrence Lessig}}</ref>, and are no longer recommended for new works. The retired licenses include all licenses lacking the Attribution element<ref name="retiredlicenses"/> other than CC0, as well as two licenses not allowing at least non-commercial verbatim distribution worldwide: *'''Sampling''': parts of the work can be used for any purpose other than advertising, but the whole work cannot be copied or modified *'''DevNations''': a [[Developing nation|Developing Nation]]s license, which only applies to countries deemed by the [[World Bank]] as a "non-high-income economy". Full copyright restrictions apply to people in other countries. == Public domain tools == Besides licenses, Creative Commons also offers a way to release material into the [[public domain]] through '''CC0'''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://creativecommons.org/choose/zero |title=CC0 |publisher=[[Creative Commons]] |accessdate=February 22, 2010}}</ref>, a legal tool for waiving as many rights as legally possible, worldwide. Development of CC0 began in 2007<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/7919 |title=Creative Commons Launches CC0 and CC+ Programs |date=December 17, 2007 |publisher=[[Creative Commons]] |accessdate=February 22, 2010}}</ref> and the tool was released in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2009/01/report-from-cc-board-meeting.html |title=Report from CC board meeting |first=Gavin |last=Baker |work=Open Access News |date=January 16, 2009 |accessdate=February 22, 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/13304 Expanding the Public Domain: Part Zero]</ref> In 2010, Creative Commons announced its Public Domain Mark,<ref>[http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/22940 Marking and Tagging the Public Domain: An Invitation to Comment]</ref> a tool for labeling works already in the public domain. Together, CC0 and the Public Domain Mark replace the ''Public Domain Dedication and Certification'', <ref>{{cite web |url=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/ |title=Copyright-Only Dedication (based on United States law) or Public Domain Certification |date=August 20. 2009 |publisher=[[Creative Commons]] |accessdate=February 22, 2010}}</ref> which took a U.S.-centric approach and co-mingled distinct operations. == Partial list of projects that release contents under Creative Commons licenses == *[[Association for Progressive Communications]] (cc-by-sa) *[[ccMixter]] (mostly cc-by-nc) *[[Citizendium]] (cc-by-sa) *[[The Freesound Project]] (Sampling Plus) *[[Identi.ca]] (cc-by) *[[knol]] (mostly, cc-by-sa or cc-by-nc-sa) *[[Mushroom Observer]] (cc-by-sa or cc-by-nc-sa) *[[Open Game Art]] (CC-By and -SA 3.0 without NC, CC0) *[[Wikia]] (cc-by-sa, since June 2009) *[[Wikipedia]] (cc-by-sa, since June 2009) *[[Wikitravel]] (cc-by-sa) == See also == {{Portal|Free software}} * [[BSD license]] * [[Copyleft]] * [[Copyright]] * [[Creative Commons]] * [[Creative Commons jurisdiction ports]] * [[Free content]] * [[Free software license]] * [[GNU General Public License]] * [[Model release]].
