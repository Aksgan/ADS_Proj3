These examples show viewers how Delcam users have revolutionised their businesses with the company’s comprehensive software solutions. As well as illustrating the diversity of Delcam’s user base across the world, the testimonials may also inspire viewers to explore new business opportunities with the software. Existing Delcam users can benefit from product videos showing the latest developments in the software and highlighting tips and tricks to further improve their productivity. Content can be viewed online or downloaded to be played on a range of media players. Viewers can share videos with friends and colleagues directly from Delcam TV. Delcam TV also supports the Apple iPhone and iPod platforms, ensuring content is easily accessible for users on the move. As might be expected from the world’s leading specialist supplier of CAM software, many of the videos feature different aspects of machining. New material from Delcam’s machine tool partners will soon be added to demonstrate to users how Delcam’s software solutions can increase the productivity and quality of their equipment. "More and more of our prospective customers are using the internet to gather information on different CADCAM systems,” explained Delcam’s Multimedia Manager, Fabio De Rosa. "We believe that our new TV channel will provide even more evidence of the need for companies to consider Delcam software when they are looking at improving their CADCAM system.” ==Boris== Delcam's logo incorporates a computer-modelled spider named Boris. This was produced as an experiment to render hairs in Delcam's CAD software in 1984. Upon seeing a machined version at a show, the [[Managing Director]] Hugh Humphreys decided to take it home and use it within the company's logo.<ref>http://www.delcam.com/general/about/boris.asp Boris' History</ref> ==References== {{reflist|2}} ==External links== *[http://www.delcam.com Official Delcam Site] *[http://www.americanmachinist.com/304/GlobalSearch/Article/False/80481/ The history of Boris, Delcam's logo] *[http://www.delcam.tv Delcam TV] *[http://www.delcam.tv/powermill2010/intro The new PowerMILL learning zone] [[Category:Computer-aided manufacturing software]] [[Category:Computer-aided design software]] [[Category:Companies based in Birmingham, West Midlands]] [[de:Delcam]] [[uk:Delcam]]</text> </page> <page> <id>9895</id> <title>Delta lemma</title> <text>The '''&Delta;-lemma''' is a [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] set-theoretic tool used in proofs to impose an [[upper bound]] on the size of a collection of pairwise incompatible elements in a [[forcing (set theory)|forcing]] [[poset]].

That is, there exists a fixed ''S'' (possibly empty) such that for all ''A'', ''B'' &isin; ''W'' with ''A'' &ne; ''B'', ''A'' &cap; ''B'' = ''S''. The &Delta;-lemma states that every uncountable collection of finite sets contains an uncountable &Delta;-system. ==References== * {{cite book|title=[[Set Theory]]|author=Jech, Thomas|publisher=Springer|year=2003}} * {{cite book|title=[[Set Theory: An Introduction to Independence Proofs]]|author=Kunen, Kenneth|publisher=North-Holland|year=1980|isbn=0-444-85401-0}} {{settheory-stub}} [[Category:Forcing]] [[Category:Set theory]] [[Category:Lemmas]] [[hu:Delta-rendszer lemma]]</text> </page> <page> <id>9904</id> <title>Deltar</title> <text>[[File:De Deltar, 27 januari 1972.jpg|thumb|The Deltar (27 January 1972)]] [[File:Beschrijving van de Deltar.jpg|thumb|Layout of the Deltar. 1.

Wind generator.]] The '''Deltar''' (Delta Getij Analogon Rekenmachine, [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for Delta Tide Analog Calculator) was an [[analog computer]], used from 1960 until 1984 in the design and implementation of the [[Delta Works]]. The computer was designed and built in order to make the complicated calculations required to predict the effects of [[dam]]s, [[Dike (construction)|dikes]], and [[flood gate|storm surge barrier]]s on the [[tide]]s in the [[estuary|estuaries]] of the rivers [[Rhine]], [[Meuse River|Meuse]] and [[Scheldt]]. The design of the Deltar was based on the analogy that exists between the properties and behaviour of [[water]] and [[electricity]]. Working with analogs of quantities such as water's height, rate of flow, and water storage, the design for the calculator basically used the electrical quantities [[electric charge|charge]], [[electric potential|potential]], [[inductance]] and [[capacitance]].

It was the first music program for the Amiga system and was created by Geoff Brown and published by [[Electronic Arts]] (EA). [[Ariolasoft]] published the program in Europe under license from EA. ''Deluxe Music Construction Set'' was the first of a line of music programs for the Amiga to make use of its 4 voice 8-bit sample playback and [[MIDI]] synthesis. Some compared the Amiga's sample playback, at the time, to the first [[Ensoniq Mirage]] Sampler which was selling for over [[United States dollar|USD]]$1000 in the mid-1980s. This program required 256 [[kilobyte|KB]] of [[RAM]], but with 512KB, it could be used for sample playback and complex music composition. ''Deluxe Music Construction Set'' included Bach's [[Little Fugue in G minor, BWV 578|Fugue in G minor "Little"]]. ''Deluxe Music Construction Set'' was more complex and capable than the first music application that EA made for the [[Commodore 64]], [[Apple II family|Apple II]], [[Atari 800|Atari]] and [[Atari ST]] computers, ''[[Music Construction Set]]''. For example, it allowed users to enter [[lyrics]] in with the musical score, though the lyrics were strictly for the user's benefit, as the program did not attempt to "sing" the words. ''Deluxe Music Construction Set'' was also released for the Macintosh, though it was hampered by its copy protection, which used a low-level code encryption that skirted the Macintosh toolbox, resulting in it becoming incompatible with Macintosh System software when upgraded to System 6. ==External links== *{{moby game|id=/will-harveys-music-construction-set|name=''Music Construction Set''}} [[Category:Electronic Arts]] [[Category:Amiga software]] [[Category:Mac OS software]] [[Category:Scorewriters]] {{music-software-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>9914</id> <title>Demand optimization</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}} '''Demand optimization''' is the application of processes and tools to maximize [[return on sales]].
