The show chronicles the family of a robotics engineer who, after he secretly creates a robot modeled after a real human girl, tries to pass it off as their daughter. Although the show was created under [[Metromedia|Metromedia Productions]], the rights to the show were acquired by [[20th Century Fox Television]] in 1986. The show also inspired an Indian remake titled [[Karishma Ka Karishma]]. ==Premise== The storylines revolve around V.I.C.I. (an acronym for "Voice Input Child Identicant", pronounced Vicki), an [[android (robot)|android]] in the form of a 10-year-old girl, built by Ted Lawson, an engineer/inventor for United Robotronics, in an effort to assist handicapped children. The robot is taken home by Lawson so that it can mature within a family environment. V.I.C.I.'s features include superhuman strength and speed, an [[Alternating current|AC]] outlet under her right arm, a [[serial port]] under her left arm, and an access panel in her back. Despite this, the Lawson family tries to pass the robot off as their adopted daughter. The Lawson family tries to keep the robot's existence a secret, but their disagreeable neighbors, the Brindles, keep on popping up at the most unexpected moments â€” especially nosy red-headed girl-next-door Harriet and her parents, Bonnie and Brandon; the latter just happens to be Ted Lawson's co-worker. The show's humor frequently derived from V.I.C.I.'s attempts to learn human behavior, V.I.C.I's literal interpretation of speech and the family's efforts to disguise the robot's true nature. To explain child actress Tiffany Brissette's aging during the show, Ted gave V.I.C.I. an upgrade in the series' third season. He aged her face, dressed her in modern clothes, and allowed her to eat and drink. The food passed through her naturally and the drink cooled her internal system. == Characters == [[File:Smallwondercast.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The cast of ''Small Wonder'' during the first season]] * '''Victoria "Vicki" Ann Smith-Lawson''' ([[Tiffany Brissette]]) - A robot modeled after a real human girl. The robot was a Voice Input Child Identicant (V.I.C.I.), but was nicknamed Vicki. She has real hair and realistic skin. She possesses super human strength and speed and runs on atomic power. Vicki has an access panel in her back, an electric socket in her right armpit, and an RS-232 [[serial port]] under her left armpit. Vicki's artificial intelligence is not perfect. She is incapable of [[emotion]], speaks in a monotone voice, and interprets most commands literally. She does manage to blend in to the real world to a point. Vicki attends school, and no one but her family members and a few trusted friends know her secret. Occasionally Vicki had rare abilities that seemed to only appear in one or two episodes, such as elongating her neck to reach a door's peephole, shrinking her size to become as small as a doll or making herself ten feet tall to get noticed by everyone. One recurring theme was that Vicki had a super-powered learning system which enabled her to improve upon something such as a new detergent or to greatly increase the gas mileage of cars, which Ted and Jamie often saw as a chance to get rich quick, only to find her improvements were not perfect. Vicki lives in a large cabinet in Jamie's bedroom, and becomes more human over the course of the show. * '''Jamie Lawson''' ([[Jerry Supiran]]) - The 12 year old son of Ted and Joan. * '''Ted Lawson''' ([[Dick Christie]]) - Jamie's father. Vicki's creator. A robotics engineer who originally created Vicki as a domestic servant whose girl-child appearance was only meant to be a selling point. * '''Joan Lawson''' ([[Marla Pennington]]) - Ted's wife. Joan regards Vicki as a real person more than anyone else on the show does. * '''Harriet Brindle''' ([[Emily Schulman]]) - The young and nosy little neighbors' daughter who has a crush on Jamie. ===Recurring=== * '''Brandon Brindle''' ([[William Bogert]]) - Harriet's father. Becomes Ted Lawson's boss after stealing Ted's ideas. * '''Bonnie Brindle''' ([[Edie McClurg]]) - Harriet's mother. Written out after the second season. * '''Ida Mae Brindle''' ([[Alice Ghostley]]) - Brandon's outspoken, know-it-all sister, who is nearly identical to his wife Bonnie. * '''Reggie Williams''' (Paul C. Scott) - Jamie's best friend. * '''Jessica''' (Lihann Jones) - Jamie's sometime girlfriend. * '''Warren Enright''' (Daryl Bartley) - Jamie's sometime school friend. * '''Vanessa''' ([[Tiffany Brissette]]) - Evil robot who looks identical to Vicki, but does not speak in monotone. (Seen in seasons 3 and 4) ==2009 reunion== On January 14, 2009, on Fox's ''[[The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet]]'', Tiffany Brissette appeared in-studio as a guest for a "Where Are They Now?" segment; unbeknownst to
