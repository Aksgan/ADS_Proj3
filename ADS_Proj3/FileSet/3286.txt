The dimensions form the rows and columns of the matrix; the measures form the values. ==Concept== The core of any OLAP system is an [[OLAP cube]] (also called a 'multidimensional cube' or a ''hypercube''). It consists of numeric facts called ''measures'' which are categorized by ''[[Dimension (data warehouse)|dimensions]]''. The cube metadata is typically created from a [[star schema]] or [[snowflake schema]] of tables in a [[relational database]]. Measures are derived from the records in the [[fact table]] and dimensions are derived from the [[dimension table]]s. Each ''measure'' can be thought of as having a set of ''labels'', or meta-data associated with it. A ''dimension'' is what describes these ''labels''; it provides information about the ''measure''. A simple example would be a cube that contains a store's sales as a ''measure'', and Date/Time as a ''dimension''. Each Sale has a Date/Time ''label'' that describes more about that sale. Any number of ''dimensions'' can be added to the structure such as Store, Cashier, or Customer by adding a foreign key column to the [[fact table]]. This allows an analyst to view the ''measures'' along any combination of the ''dimensions''. For Example: Sales Fact Table +-------------+----------+ | sale_amount | time_id | +-------------+----------+ Time Dimension | 2008.10| 1234 |---+ +---------+-------------------+ +-------------+----------+ | | time_id | timestamp | | +---------+-------------------+ +---->| 1234 | 20080902 12:35:43 | +---------+-------------------+ === Multidimensional databases === Multidimensional structure is defined as “a variation of the relational model that uses multidimensional structures to organize data and express the relationships between data”.<ref>O'Brien & Marakas, 2009, pg 177</ref> The structure is broken into cubes and the cubes are able to store and access data within the confines of each cube. “Each cell within a multidimensional structure contains aggregated data related to elements along each of its dimensions”.<ref>O'Brien & Marakas, 2009, pg 178</ref> Even when data is manipulated it is still easy to access as well as be a compact type of database. The data still remains interrelated. Multidimensional structure is quite popular for analytical databases that use online analytical processing (OLAP) applications (O’Brien & Marakas, 2009). Analytical databases use these databases because of their ability to deliver answers swiftly to complex business queries. Data can be seen from different ways, which gives a broader picture of a problem unlike other models.<ref>Williams, C., Garza, V.R., Tucker, S, Marcus, A.M. (1994, January 24). Multidimensional models boost viewing options. InfoWorld, 16(4)</ref> == Aggregations == It has been claimed that for complex queries OLAP cubes can produce an answer in around 0.1% of the time for the same query on [[OLTP]] relational data.<ref>{{cite web | author=MicroStrategy, Incorporated | year=1995 | title=The Case for Relational OLAP | url=http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~dbm031/dw042/Papers/microstrategy_211.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=2008-03-20 }}</ref><ref>{{ cite journal | author = Surajit Chaudhuri and Umeshwar Dayal | title = An overview of data warehousing and OLAP technology | journal = SIGMOD Rec. | publisher = [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] | volume = 26 | year = 1997 | pages = 65 | url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/248603.248616 | doi =
