of flow from the source to the sink, at the lowest possible price. In a [[circulation problem]], you have a lower bound <math>l(u,v)</math> on the edges, in addition to the upper bound <math>c(u,v)</math>. Each edge also has a cost. Often, flow conservation holds for ''all'' nodes in a circulation problem, and there is a connection from the sink back to the source. In this way, you can dictate the total flow with <math>l(t,s)</math> and <math>c(t,s)</math>. The flow ''circulates'' through the network, hence the name of the problem. In a '''network with gains''' or '''generalized network''' each edge has a '''[[gain graph|gain]]''', a real number (not zero) such that, if the edge has gain ''g'', and an amount ''x'' flows into the edge at its tail, then an amount ''gx'' flows out at the head. ==See also== * [[Constructal theory]] * [[Ford-Fulkerson algorithm]] * [[Flow (computer networking)]] * [[Max-flow min-cut theorem]] * [[Oriented matroid]] * [[Shortest path problem]] ==References== {{Unreferenced|date=May 2008}} == Further reading == * {{cite book | author=George T.

Fluency’s Speech Recognition solutions are used by call centers worldwide to improve customer service and significantly reduce costs and are available on-premise and hosted. == History == '''1998''' - Fluency was created as a spin-off from the Voice Research & Development team of a company called netdecisions. This [[R&D]] operation was established in Cambridge UK. The focus of the development was speech recognition systems based on the [[VXML]] standard.<br /> '''2001''' - Fluency became a separate entity in May 2001. Fluency began the creation of a [[software]] development platform specifically aimed at automating call center activities. This platform became Fluency’s VoiceRunner.<br /> '''2002 to 2004''' – Fluency establishes accomplishes many successful deployments in customer sites such as National Express and Barclaycard.<br /> '''2003''' - Fluency expanded into the USA. Fluency also acquires Vocalis of Cambridge, UK in August 2003.<br /> '''2004''' - Fluency receives £6 million investment from leading European Venture Capitalists and establishes a global [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] partnership with [[Avaya]], and the acquisition of SRC Telecom.<br /> '''2008''' - Fluency is acquired by Syntellect Ltd == Customers == Call Centers around the world use Fluency to improve service and reduce costs.

FCG is a fully operational formalism for construction grammars and proposes a uniform mechanism for [[parsing]] and production. It integrates many notions from contemporary [[computational linguistics]] such as [[feature structure]] and unification-based language processing. Rules are considered bi-directional and hence usable both for parsing and production. Processing is flexible in the sense that it can even cope with partially ungrammatical or incomplete sentences. FCG is called 'fluid' because it acknowledges the premise that language users constantly change and update their grammars. The research on FCG is conducted at [[Sony]] CSL in Paris and the [[AI]] Lab at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]. ==Coupled feature structure== FCG provides two transient [[feature structure]] objects that are coupled during a parsing or production operation. One feature structure, designated the 'Left Pole', contains the semantic units. Each named unit is a set of features and their values. The other feature structure, the 'Right Pole', contains the
