It supports [[Internet Protocol]] (IP), [[Point-to-Point Protocol]] (PPP) and [[Serial Line Internet Protocol]] (SLIP) protocols. It exists as the reference implementation of the [[TUN/TAP|Tun/Tap]] user-space tunnel driver which was included in the [[Linux]] [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]] as of version 2.4, also originally developed by Maxim Krasnyansky. Bishop Clark is the current maintainer. ==Networking== Like most other applications of its nature, VTun creates a single connection between two machines, over which it multiplexes all traffic. VTun connections are initiated via a TCP connection from the client to the server. The server then initiates a UDP connection to the client, if the UDP protocol is requested. The software allows the creation of tunnels, for routing traffic in a manner similar to PPP, as well as a bridge-friendly ethertap connection. ==Authentication== VTun uses a Private Shared Key to negotiate a handshake via a challenge and response. ==Non-SSL versions== A continual source of concern, and the target of more than one strongly-worded security assessment, is that the VTun server and client binary applications can be completely built without [[Transport Layer Security|SSL]] support. When such binaries are used, the encryption between both endpoints is only a simple [[XOR cipher]], which is completely trivial to decode. This type of build is not supported by the developers. ==External links== * VTun on [http://www.sf.net/projects/vtun Sourceforge] {{DEFAULTSORT:Vtun}} [[Category:Internet protocols]] [[Category:Free security software]] [[de:VTun]]</text> </page> <page> <id>39161</id> <title>VTune</title> <text>Intel '''VTune''' Performance analyzer is a commercial application for [[software performance analysis]] for [[Intel]]-manufactured x86 and x64 based machines, and has both [[GUI]] and [[command line]] interfaces. It is available for both [[Linux]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] operating systems. __NOTOC__ == Code Optimization == Intel VTune Performance analyzer assists in various kinds of code profiling including time-based profiling, event-based profiling, etc. The profiler result consists of details such as time spent in each sub routine which can be drilled down to the instruction level. The time taken by the instructions are indicative of any stalls in the [[pipeline (computing)|pipeline]] during instruction execution. The tool can be also used to analyze [[thread (computer science)|thread]] performance. == Features of VTune performance analyzer == ; [[Call graph]]: Provides a graphical view of the flow of an application, and helps to identify critical functions and timing details in the applications. Call graph profiling offers a graphical high-level, algorithmic view of program execution, based on [[instrumenting]] the binary executable files which is used to produce function calling sequence data ; Time-based and Event based [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]]: Sampling is a low overhead statistical method for locating performance bottlenecks. Time-based sampling finds program “hot spots” that consume a lot of CPU time. Event based sampling finds places where cache misses, branch mis-predictions and other performance issues occur. ; Source view: Sampling results are displayed line by line on the source / assembly code. ; [[Hardware performance counter|Counter]] monitor: Provides system level performance information, such as resource consumption during the execution of an application ; Intel Thread Profiler: A timeline view shows what threads are doing and how they interact. It shows the distribution of work to threads and locates load imbalances. ; Performance Tuning Utility (PTU): [http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-performance-tuning-utility/ PTU] is a separate download that gives VTune analyzer users access to experimental tuning technology. This includes things like Data Access Analysis that identifies memory hotspots and relates them to code hotspots. ; Intel Parallel Amplifier: Parallel Amplifier is the performance profiler component of [[Intel Parallel Studio]]. If you purchase VTune analyzer, you can also download and use Parallel Amplifier. It adds a statistical call graph (hotspot analysis) which is lower overhead than VTune's exact call graph, plus concurrency analysis and locks & waits analysis. == References== * [http://www.crn.com/software/199000930 Intel Releases Thread Tools, Library For Multicore CPUs] CRN test center article on VTune Performance Analyzer 9.0, Thread Profiler 3.1 and Thread Checker 3.1. * [http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20021023/smithers_01.htm Product Review: Intel’s VTune 6 Performance Analyzer] Gamasutra web site * [http://www.realworldtech.com/page.cfm?ArticleID=RWT080606230159&p=1 Performance Analysis Tools: A Look at the Intel VTune Performance Analyzer] Real World Technologies * [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel5/4297461/4297462/04297606.pdf?arnumber=4297606 IEEE Explore] (registration required) * [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2002_Feb_14/ai_82854268 New Intel VTune Performance Analyzer Helps Optimize Web Services Applications] * [http://www.gamasutra.com/visualcomputing/blog/2008/06/lock_and_lockfree_code_compare.php Lock and Lock-Free Code Compared, Optimized With Intel Thread Profiler] Visual Computing == External links== * [http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-vtune/ Intel(TM) VTune performance analyzer] (product webpage) * [http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-performance-tuning-utility/ Intel Performance Tuning Utility (PTU)] Experimental tuning technology for VTune analyzer users (product webpage) == See also == * [[List of performance analysis tools]] * [[Intel Parallel Studio]] includes the Intel Parallel Amplifier performance profiler. * [[Intel Software Network]] (support and discussion) * [[AMD]] [[CodeAnalyst]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Vtune}} [[Category:Intel products]]
