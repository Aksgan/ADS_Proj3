about freedom of expression. By defining the scope of freedom of expression and of "harmful" speech Milton argued against the principle of pre-censorship and in favour of tolerance for a wide range of views.<ref name="Sanders 2003 66"/> As the "menace" of printing spread governments established centralised control mechanism.<ref name="de Sola Pool 1983 15">{{Cite book | last = de Sola Pool| first = Ithiel | title = Technologies of freedom| publisher = Harvard University Press| year = 1983 | pages = 15 | url = http://www.google.com/books?id=BzLXGUxV4CkC&pg=PA15&dq=Areopagitica+freedom+of+speech+britain&lr=&as_brr=3&cd=36#v=onepage&q=&f=false| isbn = 9780674872332}}</ref> The [[French crown]] repressed printing and the printer [[Etienne Dolet]] was burned at the stake in 1546. In 1557 the [[British Crown]] thought to stem the flow of seditious and heretical books by chartering the [[Stationers' Company]]. The right to print was limited to the members of that guild, and thirty years later the [[Star Chamber]] was chartered to curtail the "greate enormities and abuses" of "dyvers contentyous and disorderlye persons professinge the arte or mystere of pryntinge or selling of books." The right to print was restricted to two universities and to the 21 existing printers in the [[city of London]], which had 53 [[printing presses]]. As the British crown took control of type founding in 1637 printers fled to the [[Netherlands]]. Confrontation with authority made printers radical and rebellious, with 800 authors, printers and book dealers being incarcerated in the [[Bastille]] in Paris before it was stormed in 1789.<ref name="de Sola Pool 1983 15"/> [[File:First amendment zone2.jpg|thumbnail|left|The [[free speech zone]] at the [[2004 Democratic National Convention]]]] A succession of English thinkers developed the idea of a right to freedom of expression, starting with [[John Milton]] (1608–74), then [[John Locke]] (1632–1704) and culminating in [[John Stuart Mill]] (1806–1873). Locke established the [[individual]] as the unit of value and the bearer of rights to [[right to life|life]], [[right to liberty|liberty]], [[right to property|property]] and the [[pursuit of happiness]]. It was the role of [[Government]] to protect these rights and this belief was first enshrined in the [[US Constitution]], with the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] adding the guarantee that "Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press". John Stuart Mill argued that human freedom is good and without it there can be no progress in science, law or politics, which according to Mill required free discussion of opinion. Mill's [[On Liberty]], published in 1859 became a classic defence of the right to freedom of expression.<ref name="Sanders 2003 66"/> Mill argued that [[truth]] drives out falsity, therefore the free expression of ideas, true or false, should not be feared. Truth is not stable or fixed, but evolves with time. Mill argued that much of what we once considered true has turned out false. Therefore views should not be prohibited for their apparent falsity. Mill also argued that free discussion is necessary to prevent the "deep slumber of a decided opinion". Discussion would drive the onwards march of truth and by considering false views the basis of true views could be re-affirmed.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Sanders| first = Karen| title = Ethics & Journalism| publisher = Sage| year = 2003| pages = 67| url = http://www.google.com/books?id=bnpliIUyO60C&dq=Areopagitica+freedom+of+speech+britain&lr=&as_brr=3&source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9780761969679}}</ref> In [[Evelyn Beatrice Hall]]'s biography of [[Voltaire]], she coined the following phrase to illustrate Voltaire's beliefs: "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it."<ref>[http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/e/evelyn_beatrice_hall.html Evelyn Beatrice Hall Quotes], Brainyquote.com</ref> Hall's quote is frequently cited to describe the principle of freedom of speech.<ref>{{cite book |last=Boller, Jr. |first=Paul F. |authorlink= |coauthors=George, John |title=They Never Said It: A Book of Fake Quotes, Misquotes, and Misleading Attributions |year=1989 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |pages=124–126 |isbn=0-19-505541-1 }}</ref> In the 20th Century [[Noam Chomsky]] states that: "If you believe in freedom of speech, you believe in freedom of speech for views you don't like.

Bollinger argues that [[tolerance]] is a desirable value, if not essential. However, critics argue that society should be concerned by those who directly deny or advocate, for example, [[genocide]] (see [[#Limitations on freedom of speech|Limitations on freedom of speech]]).<ref>Lee Bollinger, The Tolerant Society, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1988</ref> The European Union's Framework decision on Racism and Xenophobia states that denying or grossly trivialising "crimes of genocide" should be made "punishable in all EU Member States".<ref>[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/misc/93739.pdf See Luxembourg, April 19, 2007, 8665/07 (Presse 84)]</ref> [[Holocaust denial]] is illegal in 16 countries: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, [[Israel]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Lithuania]], [[Luxembourg]], Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, [[Romania]], [[Slovakia]], and Switzerland.<ref>Lechtholz-Zey, Jacqueline: Laws Banning Holocaust Denial.

He argues that the concept of democracy is that of self-government by the people. For such a system to work an informed electorate is necessary.
