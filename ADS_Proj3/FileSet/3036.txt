like [[web browser]]s, leveraging the cross-platform functionality already built into the Gecko layout engine. The following are the various components of the framework: ; Gecko : [[Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko]] is a standard-based [[layout engine]] designed for performance and portability. ; Necko : Necko provides an extensible API for several layers of networking from transport to presentation layers. ; XUL : [[XUL]] is the basis of [[user interface]]. It is an application of [[XML]] that defines various user interfaces elements, mostly [[GUI widget|widgets]], control elements, template, etc. It is similar in many ways to [[HTML]]. ; XBL : [[XBL]] allows one to define his/her own widget for use in XUL. ; XPCOM : [[XPCOM]] is an object interface that allows interfacing between any programming language for which a binding has been developed ; XPConnect : [[XPConnect]] is the binding between XPCOM and [[JavaScript]]. ; XPInstall : [[XPInstall]] is a technology for installing small packages like [[Add-on (Mozilla)|extension]]s and themes into Mozilla applications in form of installation archives known as [[XPI]]. ; Web services : Mozilla includes built-in support for popular [[web service]]s standards [[XML-RPC]], [[SOAP]] (dropped since Gran Paradiso Alpha 7<ref>[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=332174 Bug 332174 – Drop SOAP support]</ref>), and [[Web Services Description Language|WSDL]] as well as a simple [[XMLHttpRequest]] object similar to the one in [[Internet Explorer]]. ; Others : The framework supports a number of open or common standards, including [[Document Type Definition|DTD]], [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]], [[XSL Transformations|XSLT]]/[[XPath]], [[MathML]], [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]], [[JavaScript]], [[SQL]], [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]], etc. ==Applications that use the framework== {{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}} *[[Netscape Navigator 9]] web browser *[[Mozilla Firefox]] web browser *[[Flock (web browser)|Flock]] web browser *[[Wine (software)|Wine]] compatibility layer (Gecko is used in the built-in web browser component) *[[SeaMonkey]] Internet suite *[[Mozilla Thunderbird]] email client *[[ChatZilla]] IRC client *[[KompoZer]] [[WYSIWYG]] web authoring *[[Mozilla Sunbird]] calendar *[[ActiveState Komodo]] IDE and [[ActiveState Komodo]] Edit since version 5 of both *[[Songbird (software)|Songbird]] media player *Former [[Joost]] [[IPTV]] client *[[Celtx]] [[screenplay]] writing application *[[Miro (software)|Miro]] internet TV application *[[Boxee]] media center software ==References== <references/> * Syd Logan: <cite>Cross-Platform Development in C++: Building Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows Applications</cite>, Addison-Wesley, 2007.

MPS is a Brazilian model for software process improvement, same way CMMI but with a different focus and different target. It has focus on Brazilian companies, since it was built for Brazilian software development market. Its target is small and medium companies, besides can also be used in large ones. This program was developed by [[Softex]] interacting with universities and Federal Government, and was sponsored by Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology, FINEP (''Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos'') and IDB (Interamerican Development Bank). The model is unique and build from scratch. It is inspired by standards ISO/EIC 12207 and ISO/EIC 15504 and compatible with other maturity models - CMMI 1.2. Nevertheless being a Brazilian model, for Brazilian market, one of the process's goals is to adapt it to export to Latin America countries - like Chile, Argentina, Costa Rica, Peru and Uruguai. All the guides have been translated to Spanish. == Motivation == Brazil is a country with one of hugest markets of software development in the world, and its exigence level has been increasing in a day-by-day basis. From this increasing level companies started to seek to mature their process targeting padronization and productivity international levels, which is essential to survive in IT market. Besides this inscrease in maturity need a company may spend up to US$ 400K, which is inviable for small and medium companies. Due this surged a partneship among Softex, Federal Government and Universities resulting in MPS.Br. == Goals == Objective for MPS.BR program is to improve Brazilian software process, with two medium/long term goals: * Technical goal: aimed to create and improve MPS model * Market goal: aimed to disseminate and improve adoption of MSP model == Components == MPS has three components: * MR-MPS: Reference model, for software development improvement. * MA-MPS: Assessment model. This assessment is valid for three years after it is finished in assessed organization. * MN-MPS: Business model. [[Image:mps br.PNG|MPS.Br components]] == Guides == MPS models are described by guides. === Acquisition guide === This guide describes process for acquisition of software and correlates. It is inspired by ISO/IEC 12207:2008. It is not tied to a specific model. === Assessment guide === The assessment guide describes process and assessment method of MA-MPS, to be used against companies that implemented MR-MPS. This guide is based on ISO/IEC 15504. === General guide === It contains general description of MPS model and details MR-MPS (Reference model) and all necessary common definitions for its understanding and application. It has as reference ISO/IEC 15504:2008, ISO/IEC 12207 and CMMI-DEV. === Implementation guide === Implementation guide contains orientation for implementation of MR-MPS model. It is divided in ten sub guides, where seven of them helps to define maturity level: * G: partially managed * F: managed * E: partially defined * D: largely defined * C: defined * B: quantitative managed * A: optimized Other three guides are for 1. organizations that buy software; 2. organizations that have software factory departments; 3. companies that have test factories departments. Each maturity level have process areas, where is analyzed: * fundamental processes: acquisition, requirement management, requirement development, technical solution, product integration, product installation,
