Led by [[John Maeda]] and his students they created software aimed at allowing designers, artists and other non-programmers to easily start [[computer programming]]. The software itself could be run in a browser and published alongside the software was a book and [[courseware]]. Design By Numbers is no longer an active project but has gone on to influence many other projects aimed at making [[computer programming]] more accessible to non-technical people. Its most public result is [[Processing (programming language)|Processing]], created by Maeda's students [[Casey Reas]] and [[Ben Fry]], who built on the work of DBN and has gone on to international success. ==Book== {{cite book | last = Maeda | first = John | authorlink = John Maeda | title = Design By Numbers | publisher = [[MIT Press]] | date = October 1, 2001 | isbn = 0262632446 | pages = 256 | url = http://dbn.media.mit.edu/ }} ==Related Items== * [[Processing (programming language)|Processing]] * [[Smile (software)|Smile software]] ==External links== * [http://dbn.media.mit.edu/ Design By Numbers Homepage at MIT] [[Category:Computer programming]]</text> </page> <page> <id>10040</id> <title>Design Patterns</title> <text>{{distinguish2|the concept of a [[Design pattern]]}} '''''Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software''''' (ISBN 0-201-63361-2) is a [[software engineering]] book describing recurring solutions to common problems in software design. The book's authors are [[Erich Gamma]], [[Richard Helm]], [[Ralph Johnson]] and [[John Vlissides]] with a foreword by [[Grady Booch]]. They are often referred to as the '''''Gang of Four''''', or '''''GoF'''''{{vague|date=January 2011}}.<ref>[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?GangOfFour Gang Of Four], Content Creation Wiki for People Projects And Patterns in Software Development.</ref> The book is divided into two parts, with the first two chapters exploring the capabilities and pitfalls of object-oriented programming, and the remaining chapters describing 23 classic [[Design pattern (computer science)|software design pattern]]s. The book includes examples in [[C++]] and [[Smalltalk]]. It won a [[Jolt Award|Jolt productivity award]], and [[Software Development (Magazine)|Software Development productivity award]] in 1994.<ref>[http://ddj.com/joltawards/prev_bks.htm#1994 Jolt winners 1994], Dr. Dobb's</ref> The original publication date of the book was October 21, 1994 with a 1995 copyright, and as of April 2007, the book was in its 36th printing. The book was first made available to the public at [[OOPSLA]] meeting held in Portland, Oregon in October 1994.
