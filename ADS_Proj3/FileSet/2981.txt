It is one of the many [[registered jack]]s, like RJ11, another telephone standard. As a registered jack, telephone RJ45 specifies the physical male and female connectors as well as the pin assignments of the wires in a telephone cable. The original RJ45 uses a special<ref name = "HVS">{{cite | url = http://www.hvs.on.ca/modular_jack_wiring.htm | publisher = HVS | location = Ontario, CA | tile = Modular jack wiring}}</ref><ref>{{cite | url = http://www.siemon.com/us/standards/13-24_modular_wiring_reference.asp | publisher = Siemon | title = Modular wiring reference}}</ref> keyed 8P2C modular connector, with Pins 5 and 4 wired for tip and ring of a single telephone line and Pins 7 and 8 connected to a programming resistor. It is meant to be used with a high speed modem, and is obsolete today. Telephone installers who wired telephone RJ45 jacks were familiar with the pin assignment which was part of the RJ45 standard. However, near-identical physical connectors for computer networking became ubiquitous, and informally inherited the name RJ45 due to the overwhelming similarity. While telephone RJ45 uses a "keyed" variety of the 8P body, meaning it may have an extra tab that a computer RJ45 connector is unable to mate with, the visual difference from an Ethernet 8P is subtle. The only other difference is the presence of extra conductors in the cable, which cannot be seen without very close inspection. True telephone RJ45 connectors are a special variant of 8P2C, meaning only the middle 2 positions have conductors in them, while pins 7 and 8 are shorting a programming resistor. Computer RJ45 is 8P8C, with all eight conductors present. Understandably, because telephone RJ45 8P connectors never saw wide usage and computer 8P connectors are quite well known today, RJ45 is used almost exclusively to refer to Ethernet-type computer connectors. Electronics catalogs not specialized to the telephone industry advertise 8P8C modular connectors as "RJ45". Virtually all electronic equipment that uses an 8P8C connector (or possibly any 8P connector at all) will document it as an "RJ45" connector. In common usage, RJ45 also refers to the pin assignments for the attached cable, which are actually defined in the wiring standard [[TIA/EIA-568-B]]. ===Standardization=== The shape and dimensions of an 8P8C modular connector are specified for U.S. telephone applications by the Administrative Council for Terminal Attachment (ACTA) in national standard [[ANSI]]/TIA-1096-A. This standard does not use the short term 8P8C and covers more than just 8P8C modular connectors, but the 8P8C modular connector type is the eight position connector type described therein, with eight conductors installed. For data communication applications ([[LAN]], [[structured cabling]]), International Standard IEC 60603 specifies in parts 7-1, 7-2, 7-4, 7-5, and 7-7 not only the same physical dimensions, but also high-frequency performance requirements for shielded and unshielded versions of this connector for frequencies up to 100, 250 and 600 [[MHz]], respectively. ===Wiring=== [[File:RJ-45 TIA-568A Left.png|thumb|right|T568A wiring]] [[File:RJ-45 TIA-568B Left.png|thumb|right|T568B wiring]] Connectors are frequently terminated using the T568A or T568B pin/pair assignments that are defined in [[TIA/EIA-568-B]]. A cable that is wired as T568A at one end and T568B at the other ([[Transmission (telecommunications)|Tx]] and [[Rx]] pairs reversed) is a [[Ethernet crossover cable|"crossover" cable]]. Before the widespread acceptance of auto-[[Medium dependent interface|MDI]]/[[MDIX]] capabilities a crossover cable was needed to interconnect similar network equipment (such as [[Network hub|hubs]] to [[Network hub|hubs]]). Crossover cables are still used today to connect two computers together without a switch or hub. A cable wired the same at both ends is called a "patch" or "straight-through" cable, because no pin/pair assignments are swapped. ===Types=== Two types of 8P8C plugs and installation tools (used for [[crimping]] the plug onto a cable) are commonly available: Western Electric/Stewart Stamping (WE/SS) and Tyco/AMP. While both types look remarkably similar, the tooling used to install the two different plug types is mutually exclusive and cannot be interchanged between the
