Martin Wilson, Brill, 2006. ==Influence== He is cited by [[Samuel Beckett]], whose character [[Murphy (novel)|Murphy]] remembers the 'beautiful Belgo-Latin of Arnold Geulincx', and in particular the gloomy nostrum (frequently repeated by Beckett to inquisitive critics) ''Ubi nihil vales, ibi nihil velis'' (roughly, 'Where you are worth nothing, there you should want nothing.') Beckett's character [[Molloy (novel)|Molloy]] describes himself as "I who had loved the image of old Geulincx, dead young, who left me free, on the black boat of Ulysses, to crawl towards the East, along the deck". A citation of Geulincx's method of "despectus sui" appears in the Third Essay of [[Nietzsche]]'s ''Genealogy of Morals''. ==Notes== {{Reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.geulincx.org Arnold Geulincx Resource Site title] *[http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Arnold_Geulincx ''New World Encyclopedia'' article] {{Catholic|wstitle=Occasionalism}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Geulincx, Arnold}} [[Category:1624 births]] [[Category:1669 deaths]] [[Category:Flemish philosophers]] [[Category:Philosophers of mind]] [[Category:Alumni of the old university of Louvain]] [[Category:Leiden University faculty]] [[cs:Arnold Geulincx]] [[da:Arnold Geulincx]] [[de:Arnold Geulincx]] [[es:Arnold Geulincx]] [[fr:Arnold Geulincx]] [[ko:아르놀트 횔링크스]] [[it:Arnold Geulincx]] [[nl:Arnold Geulincx]] [[no:Arnold Geulincx]] [[pl:Arnold Geulincx]] [[ru:Гейлинкс, Арнольд]] [[sk:Arnold Geulincx]] [[fi:Arnold Geulincx]] [[sv:Arnold Geulincx]] [[tr:Arnold Geulincx]]</text> </page> <page> <id>2408</id> <title>Aronszajn tree</title> <text>In [[set theory]], an '''Aronszajn tree''' is an uncountable [[tree (set theory)|tree]] with no uncountable branches and no uncountable levels. For example, every [[Suslin tree]] is an Aronszajn tree. More generally, for a cardinal κ, a '''κ-Aronszajn tree''' is a tree of height κ such that all levels have size less than κ and all branches have height less than κ (so Aronszajn trees are the same as <math>\aleph_1</math>-Aronszajn trees). They are named for [[Nachman Aronszajn]], who constructed an Aronszajn tree in 1934. A cardinal κ for which no κ-Aronszajn trees exist is said to have the '''tree property'''. (Sometimes the condition that κ is regular and uncountable is included.) ==Existence of &kappa;-Aronszajn trees== [[König's lemma]] states that <math>\aleph_0</math>-Aronszajn trees do not exist. The existence of Aronszajn trees (=<math>\aleph_1</math>-Aronszajn trees) was proven by [[Nachman Aronszajn]], and implies that the analogue of [[König's lemma]] does not hold for uncountable trees. The existence of <math>\aleph_2</math>-Aronszajn trees is undecidable (assuming a certain large cardinal axiom): more precisely, the [[continuum hypothesis]] implies the existence of an <math>\aleph_2</math>-Aronszajn tree, and Mitchell and Silver showed that it is [[consistent]] (relative to the existence of a [[weakly compact cardinal]]) that no <math>\aleph_2</math>-Aronszajn trees exist. Jensen proved that [[V=L]] implies that there is a κ-Aronszajn tree (in fact a κ-Suslin tree) for every infinite successor cardinal κ. {{harvtxt|Cummings|Foreman|1998}} showed (using a large cardinal axiom) that it is consistent that no <math>\aleph_n</math>-Aronszajn trees exist for any finite ''n'' other than 1. If κ is weakly compact then no κ-Aronszajn trees exist. Conversely if κ is inaccessible and no κ-Aronszajn trees exist then κ is weakly compact. ==Special Aronszajn trees== An Aronszajn tree is called '''special''' if there is a function ''f'' from the tree to the rationals so that ''f''(''x'')<''f''(''y'') whenever ''x''<''y''. [[Martin's axiom]] MA(<math>\aleph_1</math>) implies that all Aronszajn trees are special. The stronger [[proper forcing axiom]] implies the stronger statement that for any two Aronszajn trees there is a [[club set]] of levels such that the restrictions of the trees to this set of levels are isomorphic, which says that in some sense any two Aronszajn trees are essentially isomorphic. On the other hand, it is consistent that non-special Aronszajn trees exist, and this is also consistent with the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]] and with the [[Suslin hypothesis]] {{harv|Schlindwein|1994}}. ==References== *{{citation|id={{MR|1492784}} |last=Cummings|first= James|last2= Foreman|first2= Matthew |title=The tree property |journal=Adv.

In 2008 AroundMe was given the second place in the top 10 iPhone OS apps [http://www.time.com/time/specials/2008/top10/article/0,30583,1855948_1863793_1863796,00.html] by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. AroundMe was the first mobile application for the [[iPhone OS]] to use the Google’s location-aware API and also was the first mobile application to make use of Google dynamic mobile advertisement. As of March 2009 over 5 million copies of AroundMe have been downloaded and installed. ==Description== AroundMe uses the [[iPhone]]'s navigation capabilities to perform location-aware searches. T A ‘Favorites’ allows the user save specific entries while the category 'nearby' is used to identify nearby cities, parks, geographical locations, airports and attractions which are linked to appropriate Wikipedia entries.
