Holl and Diepstraten were friends as students when they founded the music software company [http://d-lusion.com d-lusion] in 1996<ref>[http://d-lusion.com d-lusion interactive media<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. Notable products of theirs were the bass synthesizer [http://d-lusion.com/ProductsRubberduck.html Rubberduck] and the DJ mixer [http://d-lusion.com/ProductsMJStudio.html MJ Studio] which was the direct predecessor of Native Instruments'[http://www.native-instruments.com/index.php?id=traktor3 Traktor DJ Studio].

Four developers have been working on Babbel - two of them focusing on the Flex client and two developing the [[Ruby on Rails|Ruby On Rails]] based backend running on [[Amazon ec2|Amazon EC2]] instances. Development time to the first public version in January 2008 was about 8 months.<ref name=autogenerated1 />. According to Thomas Holl, the CTO, <blockquote> The server consists of 12K lines of Ruby code, the Flex client is about 50K LOC (including 7K lines of generated integration code). "We’re following an iterative development process - and found out that a length of one week seems to work best for us. Besides that, we’re using best practice tools and processes, e.g. Subversion for version control, Trac for defect tracking/documentation/communication, automated builds/deployment via Ant/Capistrano, etc.<ref>[http://www.flex888.com/2008/04/18/the-best-flex-startup-architecture-ever-seen.html The Best Flex Startup Architecture Ever Seen<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> </blockquote> The website has currently more than 700,000 users worldwide. == External links == * [http://www.babbel.com babbel.com] == References == <references/> [[Category:Social networking language education websites]] [[Category:Wikis]] [[Category:Language education]] [[de:Babbel (Software)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>3224</id> <title>Back to My Mac</title> <text>'''Back to My Mac''' is a feature of [[Mac OS X 10.5]] Leopard that uses Wide-Area [[Bonjour (software)|Bonjour]] to securely discover services across the Internet and automatically configure ad hoc, on-demand, point-to-point encrypted connections between computers using [[IPSec]]. It requires users to have a [[MobileMe]] subscription, as it uses MobileMe for the [[Dynamic DNS]] service portion of Wide-Area Bonjour. Due to its generality, Back to My Mac can work for many [[Bonjour (software)|Bonjour]]-enabled services, not just [[Screen Sharing]] (similar to [[Apple Remote Desktop]]) and File Sharing. In addition to requiring a MobileMe subscription, users must have a router that supports either [[Universal Plug and Play|UPNP]] (Universal Plug & Play) or [[NAT-PMP]] (NAT Port Mapping Protocol) with either of those features enabled in their connected router. It uses UDP port 4500 for point-to-point IPSec connections (which may be mapped to different UDP ports on the public side of a NAT router).<ref>Glenn Fleishman, [http://www.macworld.com/2007/11/features/backtomymac_side/index.php Back to My Mac: Apple's Internet mashup], ''MacWorld.com'', 7 November 2007</ref> ==Uses== Back to My Mac can be used to edit and transfer files from one Mac to another.
