technical support to open access journals that have been invited by OHP's editorial oversight group to join the collective. OHP launched in May 2008 with 7 open access journals and was named a [http://www.plos.org/cms/comment/reply/219/ "beacon of hope"] by the [[Public Library of Science]]. In August, 2009 OHP announced it will begin publishing open access book series edited by senior members of OHP's board. The first 5 series are: *[http://www.openhumanitiespress.org/new-metaphysics.html New Metaphysics], edited by [[Graham Harman]] and [[Bruno Latour]]; *[http://www.openhumanitiespress.org/critical-climate-change.html Critical Climate Change], edited by Claire Colebrook and Tom Cohen; *[http://www.openhumanitiespress.org/global-conversations.html Global Conversations], edited by [[Ngugi wa Thiong'o]]; *[http://www.openhumanitiespress.org/unidentified-theoretical-objects.html Unidentified Theoretical Objects], edited by [[Wlad Godzich]]; *[http://www.openhumanitiespress.org/liquid-books.html Liquid Books], edited by Gary Hall and Clare Birchall ==See also== * [[arXiv]] * [[List of academic databases and search engines]] * [[H-net]] * [[Open access (publishing)]] * [[Public Library of Science]] ==References== * "New Open Access Press Makes its Debut," Jennifer Howard, [http://chronicle.com/daily/2008/05/2759n.htm/ Chronicle of Higher Education, 7 May, 2008 ] * "OA in the Humanities Badlands," Tracy Caldwell, [http://www.iwr.co.uk/information-world-review/features/2218215/oa-humanities-badlands/ Information World Review], 4 June, 2008 * "OA on the Crest of a Wave," Julie Hare, [http://campusreview.com.au/ Campus Review] 18.26 1 July 2008 ==External links== * [http://openhumanitiespress.org/ Open Humanities Press] * [http://cosmosandhistory.org/ Cosmos and History] * [http://culturemachine.net/ Culture Machine] * [http://fastcapitalism.com/ Fast Capitalism] * [http://journal.fibreculture.org/ Fibreculture Journal] * [http://www.film-philosophy.com/ Film-Philosophy] * [http://filozofskivestnikonline.com/ Filozofski Vestnik] * [http://www.imageandnarrative.be/ Image & Narrative] * [http://zizekstudies.org/ International Journal of Zizek Studies] * [http://parrhesiajournal.org/ Parrhesia] * [http://journals.sfu.ca/pocol/index.php/pct/index/ Postcolonial Text] * [http://vectorsjournal.org/ Vectors Journal of Culture and Technology in a Dynamic Vernacular] [[Category:ePrint archives]] [[Category:Humanities]] [[Category:Open access archives]] [[Category:Discipline-oriented digital libraries]]</text> </page> <page> <id>27517</id> <title>Open Publication</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=April 2008}} {{Notability|date=April 2008}} {| class="infobox bordered" style="width: 25em; text-align: left; font-size: 90%;" |- | colspan="2" style="text-align:center; font-size: large;" | '''Open Publication''' |- | colspan="2" style="text-align:center;" | [[Image:Copyleft.svg|150px|]]<br>[[Copyleft]] Symbol |- ! Focus: | Profitable Public Publishing Protocol |- ! Notes: | Established 2007 |} '''Open Publication''' is not associated with the [[Open Publication License]], despite the similarity in their names, but the two are related in the sense that they encourage openness in published content. Open Publication is not a license. Open publication can utilize a number of established licenses which include the [[Creative Commons]] licenses, the [[GNU Free Documentation License]], the [[Free Art License]], and even the [[Open Content License]]. Open Publication is a simple agreement between an author or artist and the public that establishes a protocol by which the author can profit from his/her work and also transfer rights of a work to the public. == The Niche of Open Publication == Open Publishing gives users the ability to use, copy, and distribute a work for free. However, the author initially restricts the rights of his or her audience from (1) the freedom to change or adapt the work and (2) the freedom to release the improvements. The author wants the opportunity to make money prior to granting adaptation rights. The author sets up a [[E-Payment Providers|payment system]] so users can make contributions if they enjoyed the work. When a set value of payments has been received, the author will release the work under a licenses which gives users the freedom to adapt and release derivatives (whether they be in song, art, film, or written derivatives). Thus, Open Publication is concept where a "free" work is designed to become "more free" after the artist is satisfactorily compensated for the effort that he or she put into creating the work. ==See also== *[[International Digital Publishing Forum]], the organization responsible for OPS (Open Publishing Structure) *[[Creative Commons]], a not-for-profit organization that defines international open licenses for publication [[Category:Computer law]] [[Category:Copyright licenses]] [[Category:Creative Commons]]</text> </page> <page> <id>27523</id> <title>Open Security</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=February 2009}} {{Wikify|date=April 2010}} '''Open Security''' is an initiative to tackle today's mounting software security challenges. It is based on the simple concept that any malware, including viruses, spamware, trogen, rootkits, worms, etc. share the same fundamental characteristic, that is, to conceal its identity and intention. On the other hand, legitimate software providers have every intention to tell the world that their software will not harm customers in any means. In the past twenty years, the number of malware has been increasing following Mooreâ€™s law to reach over millions. The conventional method of catching the most wanted as well as the least wanted malware has been challenged as IT just cannot catch every piece of bad software in the global world. Different companies have been looking at alternatives to replace or compensate the black list method that have been used by most of the anti-virus companies nowadays in the market place. Open Security has been advocated by various organizations as an alternative to resolve BlackList only solution. == See also == *[[OASIS (organization)]] (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards) ==References== <references/> == External links == * [http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=ws-sx Security Service.] * [http://www.fortnova.com Open Security .] [[Category:Computer security]]</text> </page> <page> <id>27528</id> <title>Open Source Cluster Application Resources</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=February 2009}} '''Open Source Cluster Application Resources''' (OSCAR) is a Linux-based software installation for high-performance [[cluster (computing)|cluster computing]]. OSCAR allows users to install a [[Beowulf (computing)|Beowulf]] type high performance computing cluster. Beowulf Clusters are scalable performance clusters based on [[commodity computing|commodity]] hardware, on a private system network, with an open source software ([[Linux]]) infrastructure. The OSCAR project aims to support as many different Linux distributions as possible. Supported [[Linux distribution]]s as mentioned on the OSCAR website are [[Debian]], [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], [[OpenSUSE]], [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]. It consists of a cluster of [[personal computer|PCs]] or [[workstation|workstations]] dedicated to running high-performance computing tasks. The [[node (networking)|nodes]] in the cluster don't sit on people's desks; they are dedicated to running cluster jobs. The cluster is usually connected to the outside world through only a single node. Some Linux clusters are built for reliability instead of speed. These are not Beowulfs. ==External links== *[http://oscar.openclustergroup.org/ Official OSCAR site] [[Category:Cluster computing]] [[Category:Parallel computing]] {{compu-network-stub}} [[es:Open Source Cluster Application Resources]] [[pt:Open Source Cluster Application Resources]]</text> </page> <page> <id>27538</id> <title>Open Telecom Platform</title> <text>{{Infobox Software | name = Erlang | logo = [[File:Erlang
