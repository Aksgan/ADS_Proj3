middle, between things, interbeing, intermezzo." The planar movement of the rhizome resists chronology and organization, instead favoring a nomadic system of growth and propagation. In this model, culture spreads like the surface of a body of water, spreading towards available spaces or trickling downwards towards new spaces through fissures and gaps, eroding what is in its way. The surface can be interrupted and moved, but these disturbances leave no trace, as the water is charged with pressure and potential to always seek its equilibrium, and thereby establish smooth space.<ref>[http://www.rhizomes.net/issue5/poke/glossary.html Rhizomes.net]</ref> ==Principles of the rhizome== Deleuze and Guattari introduce [[A Thousand Plateaus]] by outlining the concept of the rhizome (quoted from A Thousand Plateaus): *1 and 2: Principles of connection and heterogeneity: any point of a rhizome can be connected to anything other, and must be *3. Principle of multiplicity: only when the multiple is effectively treated as a substantive, "multiplicity" that it ceases to have any relation to the One *4. Principle of asignifying rupture: a rhizome may be broken, but it will start up again on one of its old lines, or on new lines *5 and 6: Principle of cartography and decalcomania: a rhizome is not amenable to any structural or generative model; it is a "map and not a tracing" == See also == * [[Contextualism]] * [[Minority (philosophy)]] * [[Multiplicity (philosophy)]] * [[Mutualism (biology)|Mutualism]] * [[Perspectivism]] * [[Plane of immanence]] ==References== {{reflist}} ==Sources== * [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze, Gilles]] and [[Félix Guattari]]. 1980.

The word "rhyme" may also refer to a short poem, such as a rhyming [[couplet]] or other brief rhyming poem such as [[nursery rhyme]]s. ==Etymology== The word ''rime'', derived from [[Old Frankish language]] ''*rīm'', a Germanic term meaning "series, sequence" attested in Old English (Old English ''rīm'' - "enumeration, series, numeral") and Old High German ''rīm'', ultimately cognate to Old Irish ''rím'', [[Greek language|Greek]] ''{{polytonic|ἀριθμός}}'' ''arithmos'' "number". The spelling ''rhyme'' (from original ''rime'') was introduced at the beginning of the Modern English period, due to a learned (but etymologically incorrect) association with [[Greek language|Greek]] ''{{polytonic|ῥυθμός}}'' (''rhythmos'', [[rhythm]]). <!-- Some references http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/rhyme?view=uk http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/rime_2?view=uk http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/SESLL/EngLang/ugrad/readings/EMod/loves_labours.htm --> The older spelling ''rime'' survives in Modern English as a rare alternative spelling. A distinction between the spellings is also sometimes made in the study of [[linguistics]] and [[phonology]], where ''rime/rhyme'' is used to refer to the [[Syllable nucleus|nucleus]] and [[Syllable coda|coda]] of a [[syllable]]. In this context, some prefer to spell this ''rime'' to separate it from the poetic rhyme covered by this article (see [[syllable rime]]). ==Types of rhyme== The word ''rhyme'' can be used in a specific and a general sense. In the specific sense, two words rhyme if their final stressed vowel and all following sounds are identical; two lines of poetry rhyme if their final strong positions are filled with rhyming words. A rhyme in the strict sense is also called a [[perfect rhyme]]. Examples are ''sight'' and ''flight'', ''deign'' and ''gain'', ''madness'' and ''sadness''. ===Perfect rhymes=== Perfect rhymes can be classified according to the number of syllables included in the rhyme , which is dictated by the location of the final stressed syllable. * '''[[Masculine rhyme|masculine]]:''' a rhyme in which the stress is on the final syllable of the words. (''rhyme'', ''sublime'') * '''[[Feminine rhyme|feminine]]:''' a rhyme in which the stress is on the penultimate (second from last) syllable of the words. (''picky'', ''tricky'') * '''dactylic:''' a rhyme in which the stress is on the antepenultimate (third from last) syllable (''cacophonies'', ''Aristophanes'') ===General rhymes=== In the general sense, ''general rhyme'' can refer to various kinds of phonetic similarity between words, and to the use of such similar-sounding words in organizing verse. Rhymes in this general sense are classified according to the degree and manner of the phonetic similarity: * '''[[syllable rhyme|syllabic]]:''' a rhyme in which the last syllable of each word sounds the same but does not necessarily contain vowels. (''cleaver'', ''silver'', or ''pitter'', ''patter'') * '''imperfect:''' a rhyme between a stressed and an unstressed syllable. (''wing'', ''caring'') * '''semirhyme:''' a rhyme with an extra syllable on one word. (''bend'', ''ending'') * '''oblique (or slant/forced):''' a rhyme with an imperfect match in sound. (''green'', ''fiend''; ''one'', ''thumb'') * '''[[assonance]]:''' matching vowels. (''sh'''a'''ke'', ''h'''a'''te'') Assonance is sometimes used to refer to slant rhymes. * '''[[literary consonance|consonance]]:''' matching consonants. ('''''r'''a'''b'''ie'''s''', '''r'''o'''bb'''er'''s''''') *'''[[half rhyme]]''' (or '''sprung rhyme'''): matching final consonants. (''be'''nt''''', ''a'''nt''''') * '''[[alliteration]]''' (or '''head rhyme'''): matching initial consonants. ('''''sh'''ort'','''''sh'''ip'') A rhyme is not classified as a rhyme if one of the words being rhymed is the entirety of the other word. For example Ball and all. As stated above, in a perfect rhyme the last stressed vowel and all following sounds are identical in both words. If the sound preceding the stressed vowel is also identical, the rhyme is sometimes considered to be inferior and not a perfect rhyme after all.<ref>[http://myclasses.net/smiser/cwp/rhyme.html], which cites ''Whitfield's University Rhyming Dictionary'', 1951</ref><ref>[http://www.michael-thomas.com/music/songwriting/rhyming.htm]</ref> An example of such a "super-rhyme" or "more than perfect rhyme" is the "identical rhyme", in
