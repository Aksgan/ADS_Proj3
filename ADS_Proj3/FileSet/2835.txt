backwards, so our uncertainty about the dynamical state at time ''t<sub>1</sub>'' is now ''also'' reduced from ''S<sub>'''I'''</sub><sup>(1)</sup>'' to ''S<sub>'''I'''</sub><sup>(2)</sup>'' ). We know that ''S<sub>Th</sub><sup>(2)</sup> > S<sub>'''I'''</sub><sup>(2)</sup>''; but we can now no longer be certain that it is greater than ''S<sub>Th</sub><sup>(1)</sup> = S<sub>'''I'''</sub><sup>(1)</sup>''. This then leaves open the possibility for fluctuations in ''S<sub>Th</sub>''. The thermodynamic entropy may go "down" as well as up. A more sophisticated analysis is given by the entropy [[Fluctuation Theorem]], which can be established as a consequence of the time-dependent MaxEnt picture. 3. As just indicated, the MaxEnt inference runs equally well in reverse. So given a particular final state, we can ask, what can we "retrodict" to improve our knowledge about earlier states? However the Second Law argument above also runs in reverse: given macroscopic information at time ''t<sub>2</sub>'', we should expect it too to become less useful. The two procedures are time-symmetric. But now the information will become less and less useful at earlier and earlier times. (Compare with [[Loschmidt's paradox]].) The MaxEnt inference would predict that the most probable origin of a currently low-entropy state would be as a spontaneous fluctuation from an earlier high entropy state. But this conflicts with what we know to have happened, namely that entropy has been increasing steadily, even back in the past. The MaxEnt proponents' response to this would be that such a systematic failing in the prediction of a MaxEnt inference is a "good" thing<ref name="Jaynes 1979">Jaynes, E.T. (1979).

ISBN 0-262-12080-1.</ref>. It means that there is thus clear evidence that some important physical information has been missed in the specification the problem. If it is correct that the dynamics "are" [[T-symmetry|time-symmetric]], it appears that we need to put in by hand a [[prior probability]] that initial configurations with a low thermodynamic entropy are more likely than initial configurations with a high thermodynamic entropy. This cannot be explained by the immediate dynamics. Quite possibly, it arises as a reflection of the evident time-asymmetric evolution of the universe on a cosmological scale (see [[arrow of time]]). == Criticism and rejection == Maximum Entropy thermodynamics has generally failed to be accepted by the majority of scientists, with mainstream thermodynamicists considering Jaynes' work as an unfounded mathematical contrivance. Partially because of the relative paucity of published results from the MaxEnt school, especially with regard to the new testable predictions far-from-equilibrium.<ref>Kleidon, Axel; Lorenz, Ralph D. (2004).

Springer-Verlag, Berlin.</ref> The theory has also been criticized in the grounds of internal consistency. For instance, [[Radu Balescu]] provides a concise but strong criticism of the MaxEnt School and of Jaynes' work. Balescu states how Jaynes' and coworkers theory is based on a non-transitive evolution law that produces ambiguous results. Although some difficulties of the theory can be cured, the theory "lacks a solid foundation" and "has not led to any new concrete result". <ref>Balescu, Radu. (1997).

They are bit sequences generated using maximal [[linear feedback shift register]]s and are so called because they are [[periodic function|periodic]] and reproduce every [[binary sequence]] that can be reproduced by the shift registers (i.e., for length-''m'' registers they produce a sequence of length 2<sup>''m''</sup> &minus; 1). A MLS is also sometimes called a '''n-sequence''' or a '''m-sequence'''. MLSs are [[Frequency spectrum|spectrally flat]], with the exception of a near-zero DC term. These sequences may be represented as coefficients of irreducible polynomials in a [[polynomial ring]] over [[Congruence_subgroup | Z/2Z]]. Practical applications for MLS include measuring [[impulse response]]s (e.g., of room [[reverberation]]). They are also used as a basis for deriving pseudo-random sequences in digital communication systems that employ [[direct-sequence spread spectrum]] and [[frequency-hopping spread spectrum]] [[transmission system]]s, and in the efficient design of some fMRI experiments<ref name="buracas">[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12169264?dopt=Abstract Buracas GT, Boynton GM.
