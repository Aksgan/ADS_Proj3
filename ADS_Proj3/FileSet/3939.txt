[[Medicine]] presents a special case because it is one of the few sciences which is also a humanity; [[linguistics]] is another example. Those disciplines are treated as sciences, not humanities. The delineation of sources as [[primary sources|primary]] and secondary first arose in the field of [[historiography]], as historians attempted to identify and classify the sources of historical writing.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} In scholarly writing, an important objective of classifying sources is to determine the independence and reliability of sources.<ref>Helge (1989), p. 121.</ref> In contexts such as historical writing, it is almost always advisable to use primary sources if possible, and that "if none are available, it is only with great caution that [the author] may proceed to make use of secondary sources."<ref> {{Citation |last=Cipolla |publisher=W.W. Norton & Co. |title=Between Two Cultures: An Introduction to Economic History |year=1992 |isbn=9780393308167 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=GIqRTlepwmoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=cipolla }}.</ref><!-- --> Many scholars have commented on the difficulty in producing secondary source narratives from the "raw data" which makes up the past. Historian/philosopher [[Hayden White]] has written extensively on the ways in which the rhetorical strategies by which historians construct narratives about the past, and what sorts of assumptions about time, history, and events are embedded in the very structure of the historical narrative. In any case, the question of the exact relation between "historical facts" and the content of "written history" has been a topic of discussion among historians since at least the nineteenth century, when much of the modern profession of history came into being.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} As a general rule, modern historians prefer to go back to primary sources, if available, as well as seeking new ones, because primary sources, whether accurate or not, offer new input into historical questions, and most modern history revolves around heavy use of [[archive]]s for the purpose of finding useful primary sources. On the other hand, most undergraduate research projects are limited to secondary source material.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} ====Law==== In the legal field, source classification is important because the persuasiveness of a source usually depends upon its history. Primary sources may include cases, constitutions, statutes, administrative regulations, and other sources of binding legal authority, while secondary legal sources may include books, articles, and encyclopedias.<!-- FOOTNOTE--><ref>{{Citation |last=Bouchoux |first=Deborah E. |year=2000 |title=Cite Checker: A Hands-On Guide to Learning Citation Form |page=45 |publisher=Thomson Delmar Learning |isbn=0766818934 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=RJ4vlBrWu0MC&pg=PA45&dq=%22primary+sources%22+%22science+citation%22 }}.</ref><!-- --> Legal writers usually prefer to cite primary sources because only primary sources are authoritative and [[precedent]]ial, while secondary sources are only persuasive at best.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bouchoux|2000|p=45}}.</ref> ====Family history==== "A secondary source is a record or statement of an event or circumstance made by a non-eyewitness or by someone not closely connected with the event or circumstances, recorded or stated verbally either at or sometime after the event, or by an eye-witness at a time after the event when the fallibility of memory is an important factor."<ref>Harland, p. 39</ref> Consequently, according to this definition, a first hand account written long after the event "when the fallibility of memory is an important factor" is a secondary source, even though it may be the first published description of that event. ====Autobiographies==== An autobiography can be a secondary source in history or the humanities when used for information about topics other than its subject. For example, many first hand accounts of events in [[World War I]] written in the post-war years were influenced by the then prevailing perception of the war which was significantly different from contemporary opinion.<ref>Holmes, particularly the introduction</ref> ==See also== *[[Secondary text]] *[[Primary source]] *[[Tertiary source]] ==References== {{reflist}} ==Further reading== * Jules R.
