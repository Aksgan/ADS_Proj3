Tiger was released to the public on 29 April 2005 for US$129.95 as the successor to [[Mac OS X Panther]] (version 10.3), which had been released 18 months earlier. Tiger was succeeded by [[Mac OS X Leopard]] (version 10.5) on 26 October 2007, after 30 months, making Tiger the longest running version of Mac OS X.<ref name="LowEnd"> {{cite news|last=Knight|first=Dan|title=Leopard Delayed to October.

The server edition, [[Mac OS X Server#Mac OS X Server 10.4 Tiger|Mac OS X Server 10.4]], was also available for some Macintosh product lines. Tiger is also the first version of any released Apple operating system to work on [[Apple–Intel architecture]] machines (Apple machines using [[x86]] processors).

While Apple shipped the PowerPC edition bundled with PowerPC-based Macs and also sold it as a separate retail box, the only way to get the Intel version was bundled with an Intel-based Mac. However, there were still unofficial places to buy the Intel version such as eBay, although the only Intel discs produced were the gray-colored "restore" DVDs supplied with new Macs that will only install on the model of Mac that they are intended for, unlike the retail DVD that can be used on any Mac supported by Tiger. The system requirements of the PowerPC edition are:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1514|title=Mac OS X Tiger: System requirements|author=Apple|publisher=Apple|accessdate= 2009-10-18}}</ref> *A [[PowerPC G3]], [[PowerPC G4|G4]], or [[PowerPC G5|G5]] processor running at 500 MHz or faster *Built-in [[FireWire]] (Firewire 800 Recommended) *At least 256 MB of RAM, 128 MB can run it unofficially though (512 MB or 1 GB recommended) *At least 3 GB of available hard disk space; 4 GB of disk space including the [[Xcode]] 2 Tools, 2 GB for the minimal install *DVD-R drive (CD-ROM exchange was available; offer ended on March 20th, 2007) Tiger removed support for older [[New World ROM]] Macs such as the original [[iMac]]s and [[iBook]]s that were supported in [[Mac_os_x_panther|Panther]]; however it is possible to install Tiger on these Macs using third-party software (such as [[XPostFacto]]) that overrides the checks made at the beginning of the installation process. Likewise, machines such as [[Power Macintosh G3|beige Power Mac G3s]] and “Wall Street” PowerBook G3s that were dropped by Panther (the preceding release of Mac OS X) can also be made to run both Panther and Tiger in this way. Also, Tiger can be installed on unsupported New World ROM Macs by installing it on a supported Mac, then swapping hard drives. Old World ROM Macs require the use of XPostFacto to install Tiger. Tiger was the last version of Mac OS X that supported the PowerPC G3
