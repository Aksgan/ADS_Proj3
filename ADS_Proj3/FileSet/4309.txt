as a [[Markov process]]. Then he discusses [[phrase structure grammar]], a model based on [[immediate constituent analysis]]. He shows that both these models are inadequate for the purpose of linguistic description and as a solution, proposes his own formal theory of syntax called [[transformational generative grammar]] (TGG), "a more powerful model combining phrase structure and grammatical transformations that might remedy these inadequacies."<ref>Chomsky 1957: 49</ref> A transformational grammar has a "natural tripartite arrangement": phrase structure rules, transformational rules and [[Morphophonemics|morphophonemic]] rules.<ref>Chomsky 1957: 45</ref> The phrase structure rules are used for the expansion of [[Lexical category|grammatical categories]] <!-- Here grammatical category is actually lexical category--> and for substitutions. These yield a string of [[morpheme]]s. A transformational rule "operates on a given string...with a given constituent structure and converts it into a new string with a new derived constituent structure."<ref>Chomsky 1957: 44</ref> It "may rearrange strings or may add or delete morphemes."<ref>Chomsky 1957: 46</ref> Transformational rules are of two kinds: obligatory or optional. Obligatory transformations applied on the "terminal strings" of the grammar produce the "kernel of the language"<ref>Chomsky 1957: 45</ref>, which are simple, active, declarative and affirmative sentences. To produce passive, negative, interrogative or complex sentences, one or more optional transformation rules must be applied in a particular order to the kernel sentences. At the final stage of the grammar, morphophonemic rules convert a string of words into a string of [[phoneme]]s. In ''Syntactic Structures'', Chomsky invented the term "generative" and used it in a particular technical sense. When he says a finite set of rules "generate" the set of potentially infinite number of sentences of a particular human language, he means that they provide an explicit, structural description of those sentences.<ref>Chomsky 1957 and Chomsky 1965</ref> ==Significance== American linguist [[Paul Postal]] wrote in 1964 that most of the "syntactic conceptions prevalent in the United States" were "versions of the theory of phrase structure grammars in the sense of Chomsky".<ref>Postal 1964</ref> British linguist [[John Lyons (linguist)|John Lyons]] wrote in 1966 that "no work has had a greater influence upon the current linguistic theory than Chomsky's ''Syntactic Structures''."<ref>Lyons 1966</ref> Prominent historian of linguistics [[R. H. Robins]] wrote in 1967 that the publication of Chomsky's ''Syntactic Structures'' was "probably the most radical and important change in direction in descriptive linguistics and in linguistic theory that has taken place in recent years".<ref>Robins 1967:226</ref> Another historian of linguistics [[Frederick Newmeyer]] considers ''Syntactic Structures'' "revolutionary" for two reasons. Firstly, it showed that a formal yet non-empiricist theory of language was possible and more importantly, it demonstrated this possibility in a practical sense by formally treating a fragment of English grammar. Secondly, it put syntax at the center of the theory of language. Syntax was recognized as the focal point of language production, in which a finite set of rules can produce an infinite number of sentences. As a result, morphology and phonology were relegated in importance.<ref>Newmeyer 1996: 24-26</ref> ''Syntactic Structures'' also introduced Chomsky's [[Mentalism (philosophy)|mentalist]] perspective in linguistic analysis. This had a massive influence on the [[Psycholinguistics|psychological study of language]]. Before ''Syntactic Structures'', psychologists treated human language in terms of conditioned responses to outside stimuli and reinforcement. Chomsky argued that humans produce language using separate syntactic and semantic components inside the mind, and presented TGG as a coherent abstract description of this phenomenon. This induced a flurry of psycholinguistic research in the following decades. ''Syntactic Structures'' also initiated an interdisciplinary dialog between [[Philosophy of language|philosophers of language]] and linguists. American philosopher [[John Searle]] wrote that "Chomsky's work is one of the most remarkable intellectual achievements of the present era, comparable in scope and coherence to the work of [[Keynes]] or [[Freud]]. It has done more than simply produce a revolution in linguistics; it has created a new discipline of generative grammar and is having a revolutionary effect on two other subjects, philosophy and psychology".<ref>Searle 1972</ref> Chomsky and Willard Van Orman Quine, a strident anti-mentalistic philosopher of language and one of Chomsky's early influences, debated many times on the merit of Chomsky's linguistic theories. Most philosophers supported Chomsky's idea that natural languages are innate and syntactically rule-governed. In addition, they thought that there also exist rules in the human mind which bind meanings to utterances. An investigation of these rules started a new era in [[philosophical semantics]]. With its formal and logical treatment of language, ''Syntactic Structures'' also brought linguistics and the new field of [[computer science]] closer together. Renowned computer scientist [[Donald Knuth]] admits to reading ''Syntactic Structures'' during his honeymoon in 1961 and being greatly influenced by it. He found it to be "a marvelous thing: a mathematical theory of language in which I could use a computer programmer's intuition." <ref>From the preface of Knuth 2003: "...researchers in linguistics were beginning to formulate rules of grammar that were considerably more mathematical than before. And people began to realize that such methods are highly relevant to the artificial languages that were becoming popular for computer programming, even though natural languages like English remained intractable. I found the mathematical approach to grammar immediately appealing&mdash;so much so, in fact, that I must admit to taking a copy of Noam Chomsky's ''Syntactic Structures'' along with me on my honeymoon in 1961. During odd moments, while crossing the Atlantic in an ocean liner and while camping in Europe, I read that book rather thoroughly and tried to answer some basic theoretical questions. Here was a marvelous thing: a mathematical theory of language in which I could use a computer programmer's intuition! The mathematical, linguistic, and algorithmic parts of my life had previously been totally separate. During the ensuing years those three aspects became steadily more intertwined; and by the end of the 1960s I found myself a Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University, primarily because of work that I had done with respect to languages for computer programming."</ref> ==Criticism== In his 1964 presidential address to the [[Linguistic Society of America]], American linguist [[Charles Hockett]] considered ''Syntactic Structures'' one of "only four major breakthroughs in modern linguistics", alongside [[Sir William Jones]]'s address
