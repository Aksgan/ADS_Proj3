He also became a member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic Workers' Party of Austria]], which was at that time a party that fully adopted the Marxist ideology.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/ Stephen Thornton, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]</ref> He soon became disillusioned by what he saw to be the philosophical restraints imposed by the [[historical materialism]] of Marx, abandoned the ideology and remained a supporter of [[social liberalism]] throughout his life. In 1928, he earned a doctorate in Philosophy and then, from 1930 to 1936, taught secondary school. Popper published his first book, ''Logik der Forschung'' (''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]''), in 1934. Here, he criticised [[psychologism]], [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], [[inductionism]], and [[logical positivism]], and put forth his theory of potential [[falsifiability]] as the criterion demarcating science from non-science.

In 1946, he moved to England to become [[reader (academic rank)|reader]] in [[logic]] and [[scientific method]] at the [[London School of Economics]]. Three years later, he was appointed as professor of logic and scientific method at the University of London in 1949. Popper was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1958 to 1959. He was [[British honours system|knighted]] by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1965, and was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1976. He retired from academic life in 1969, though he remained intellectually active for the rest of his life. He was invested with the Insignia of a [[Order of the Companions of Honour|Companion of Honour]] in 1982. Popper was a member of the [[Academy of Humanism]] and described himself as an [[agnosticism|agnostic]], showing respect for the moral teachings of Judaism and Christianity. Popper won many awards and honours in his field, including the Lippincott Award of the [[American Political Science Association]], the [[Sonning Prize]], and fellowships in the Royal Society, [[British Academy]], London School of Economics, [[King's College London]], [[Darwin College, Cambridge|Darwin College]] [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], and [[Charles University in Prague|Charles University, Prague]]. Austria awarded him the Grand [[Decoration for Services to the Republic of Austria]] in Gold. Popper died in [[Croydon]], UK at the age of 92 on 17 September 1994. After cremation, his ashes were taken to Vienna and buried at Lainzer cemetery adjacent to the [[ORF]] Centre, where his wife Josefine Anna Henninger, who had died in Austria several years before, had already been buried. == Popper's philosophy == === Philosophy of science === {{Refimprove|section|date=August 2010}} Popper coined the term ''[[critical rationalism]]'' to describe his philosophy. The term indicates his rejection of classical [[empiricism]], and of ''the classical [[inductivism|observationalist-inductivist]] account of science'' that had grown out of it. Popper argued strongly against the latter, holding that [[scientific theories]] are abstract in nature, and can be tested only indirectly, by reference to their implications. He also held that scientific theory, and human knowledge generally, is irreducibly conjectural or hypothetical, and is generated by the creative imagination in order to solve problems that have arisen in specific historio-cultural settings. Logically, no number of positive outcomes at the level of experimental testing can confirm a scientific theory, but a single counterexample is logically decisive: it shows the theory, from which the implication is derived, to be false. The term "falsifiable" does not mean something is false; rather, that if it is false, then this can be shown by observation or experiment. Popper's account of the logical asymmetry between [[Verification theory|verification]] and [[falsifiability]] lies at the heart of his philosophy of science. It also inspired him to take falsifiability as his criterion of [[Demarcation problem|demarcation]] between what is and is not genuinely scientific: a theory should be considered scientific if and only if it is falsifiable. This led him to attack the claims of both [[psychoanalysis]] and contemporary [[Marxism]] to scientific status, on the basis that their theories are not falsifiable. Popper also wrote extensively against the famous [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]]. He strongly disagreed with [[Niels Bohr]]'s [[instrumentalism]] and supported [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[scientific realism|realist]] approach to scientific theories about the universe. Popper's falsifiability resembles [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles Peirce]]'s nineteenth century [[fallibilism]]. In ''Of Clocks and Clouds'' (1966), Popper remarked that he wished he had known of Peirce's work earlier. In ''All Life is Problem Solving'', Popper sought to explain the apparent progress of scientific knowledge&mdash;how it is that our understanding of the universe seems to improve over time. This problem arises from his position that the truth content of our theories, even the best of them, cannot be verified by scientific testing, but can only be falsified. Again, in this context the word 'falsified' does not refer to something being 'fake'; rather, that something can be (i.e., is ''capable'' of being) shown to be false by observation or experiment. Some things simply do not lend themselves to being shown to be false, and therefore are not falsifiable. If so, then how is it that the growth of science appears to result in a growth in knowledge? In Popper's view, the advance of scientific knowledge is an ''evolutionary'' process characterized by his formula: : <math>PS_1 \rightarrow TT_1 \rightarrow EE_1 \rightarrow PS_2. \, </math> In response to a given problem situation (<math>PS_1</math>), a number of competing conjectures, or tentative theories (<math>TT</math>),
