based on time. We are interested in applying TDMA schemes over 802.11 in order to boost performance. * Exploiting the Multiple Channel Advantage: The access points we have chosen for Quail Ridge are equipped with two radios. This will allow us to intelligently and dynamically select channels in order to avoid interference on high-traffic links.

The fundamental idea behind the quad-edge structure is the recognition that a single edge, in a closed polygonal mesh topology, sits between exactly two faces and exactly two vertices. Thus, it can represent a dual of the graph simply by reversing the convention on what is a vertex and what is a face. ==Details== The quad-edge structure gets its name from the general mechanism by which they are stored. A single Edge structure conceptually stores references to up to two faces, two vertices, and 4 edges. The four edges stored are the edges starting with the two vertices that are attached to the two stored faces. ==Uses== Much like [[winged edge|Winged Edge]], quad-edge structures are used in programs to store the topology of a 2D or 3D polygonal mesh. The mesh itself does not need to be closed in order to form a valid quad-edge structure. Using a quad-edge structure, iterating through the topology is quite easy. Often, the interface to quad-edge topologies is through directed edges. This allows the two vertices to have explicit names (start and end), and this gives faces explicit names as well (left and right, relative to a person standing on start and looking in the direction of end). The four edges are also given names, based on the vertices and faces: start-left, start-right, end-left, and end-right. A directed edge can be reversed to generate the edge in the opposite direction. Iterating around a particular face only requires having a single directed edge to which that face is on the left (by convention) and then walking through all of the start-left edges until the original edge is reached. ==See also== * [[Combinatorial maps]] * [[Winged edge]] * [[Doubly-connected edge list]] ==References== * The quad-edge data structure was described in the paper by [[Leonidas J.

Unlike the previous challenge, [[Hangin'-A-Round]], Quad Quandary makes use of small rings and movable goal posts. ==Robot rules== The largest acceptable size for the robot is 18"x18"x18". The teams may not introduce a new robot during any time of the match. No two identical robots are allowed on the match. Upon entering the match, all robots must pass inspection, and if modified immensely, must be reinspected. The robots must only contain Vex parts (however not all parts from Vex are competition legal) and not be potentially damaging to the playing field, other robots, and the players.<ref name="FTC">{{cite web|author=FIRST|date=19 September 2007 |url=http://www.usfirst.org/uploadedFiles/Community/02FVC/FVC_Documents_and_Updates/2007_Quad_Quandary/2007_FTC_QQ_Game_Manual_Section_1-8.pdf |title=About Us |accessdate=29 September 2007}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> ==The Challenge== The main characteristic of the Quad Quandary challenge is defined by its field, which is a 12' by 12' square divided into four equal quadrants. Each alliance (red and blue) are given two quadrants, of their color, on opposite sides of the field. The field is split using two diagonal lines. The challenge uses rings (placed on the opposite color's quadrants and mixed on the quadrant division line) and two different kinds of posts â€” two {{convert|18|in|0}} high posts (atop the single goals), and two {{convert|24|in|0}} posts connected by a {{convert|60|in|0}} bar, which rest atop the paired goals. The bar rests {{convert|9|in|0}} off the ground but during the match, can be raised up to {{convert|15|in|0}}. The rings may also be placed on a {{convert|3.5|in|0}} high base, known as a goal (single or paired), that holds the posts. The goals are on casters and thus can be moved. There are also four, {{convert|20|sqin|0}} low goals centered along the edges. The rings used have a {{convert|3|in|0}} inner diameter and are {{convert|1|in|0}} thick. There are 50 rings total; 25 for red and 25 for blue. There are 44 total rings on the field, and three available to each alliance to load on their robot before the match starts.<ref name="FTC"/> ==Scoring== * One ring in the low (ground) goal is worth one point. * One ring on a single or paired goal is worth two points (the ring must be placed completely on the inside of the goal's outer edges). * One ring "rung" on an {{convert|18|in|0}} post is worth three points. * One ring "rung" on a {{convert|24|in|0}} post is worth five points. (All rings scored award points for their corresponding colored alliance.) * A single or paired goal that is in an alliance's quadrant at the end of the match awards that alliance 7 points (determined not by the area of the goal in the quadrant but by where the goal's post lies). * The winner of the autonomous period is given a 10 point bonus.<ref name="FTC"/> ==References== <references /> ==External links== * [http://www.usfirst.org/community/fvc/default.aspx?id=968 FTC Challenge] * [http://www.usfirst.org/community/fvc/content.aspx?id=962 Quad Quandary Downloadable PDF Rules] {{FIRST}} [[Category:Robotics competitions]]</text> </page>
