the page, the Senkousha would first rattle the ground with its feet to stir the energy resting on the ground, then it will do squats to harness that energy and transfer them to its crotch cannon, then finally fire that energy in a massive white beam with a [[pelvic thrust]]. In conclusion, the author of the article expressed his worries about [[world peace]], seeing the destructive power that the robot possesses (including the ability to make people [[Death from laughter|die laughing]]). With the article, Samurai Damasii exceeded 10,000 pageviews per day, which is rare in personal webpages. It was said that a peak level of 200,000 pageviews per day was recorded. (In Japan, in the past, a personal webpage with 1,000 pageviews per day was considered successful. Now, because of Senkousha, that standard has risen to 10,000.) The articles officially started the Senkousha craze in Japan, and later [[Taiwan]]. === Senkousha Games === [[File:Senkousha.jpg|thumb|left|In-game [[screenshot]] from Senkousha Game 2.]] Following Samurai Damasii's articles, the [http://www.hinden5.com/ Silchov Brothers] (シルチョフ兄弟社) made the [[doujin]] "Senkousha Games" and hosted them on their website{{ref|hinden}}. The Senkousha Games are free to the public, and run on [[Java applet]]s; but [[CD-rom]] versions can be purchased for additional features. In the games, the player controls the Senkousha [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] in a [[2.5D]] environment and battles robots similar to ASIMOs and [[AIBO]]s. The objective of the games is to destroy as many enemy units as possible, until the Senkousha is destroyed. Players can also compare scores on the internet ranking chart. In the games, many additions were made on the Senkousha, for example, the Chinese Drill, the Chinese Chop, a [[Gatling gun]] (in the cannon), a [[self-destruct]] button, a [[jet pack]], etc. Upgrades are available for the Chinese Drill, the Gatling gun, and the Chinese Cannon throughout the game. The technology of the Senkousha is attributed to research in a [[Tao]] system. The plot of Senkousha Game 1 follows the fictitious "Asia One Year Conflict" (アジア一年紛争). In 2003, the nation of Japan declared [[bankruptcy]]. This led to a crash in the Asian economy. To ensure their survival, the Asian corporate giants underwent a series of [[M&A]], forming [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]] with various militaries of Asian countries. These companies later developed Robot Army (RA) units for military uses. Because of the chaos, [[terrorism]] and [[territorial dispute]]s were frequent. On the surface they are only minor regional conflicts, but in reality they are corporate wars between the enterprises of different nations. In the end, it was said that it wasn't American intervention or [[nuclear bomb]]s that ended the war, it was a new [[Communism|Communist]] robot and an Ace pilot that did. The plot of Senkousha Game 2 takes place ten years after the events of Senkousha Game 1, and follows the "Kawamura Rebellion" (川村の反乱). After the Asia One Year Conflict, the RA Treaty was signed to abolish the development and use of RA weapons, and their programmers were prosecuted. But on 20 July 2013, during an end-of-war memorial parade in [[Tiananmen Square]], an unknown armed RA unit opened fire on the parade. Following this violation of the RA Treaty, the sealed Senkousha emerges from its hangar to fight once again. == Influence == The Senkousha craze quickly spread into Japanese [[internet forum]]s like [[2channel]], achieving meme stature. Using the plot from the games, fans even wrote a theme song for Senkousha, and subsequently used the song to make a fake [[tokusatsu]] opening animation{{ref|op}}, spreading the meme even further. Other appearances include: * [http://www.sbpnet.jp/netrunner/ Netrunner], a Japanese magazine, quick to respond to internet culture, made models of the Senkousha for sale.{{ref|itmedia}} The magazine also featured Senkousha in its anime [[OVA]], ''[[Netrun-mon]]''. * [http://seventen.org/HOS/ Hyper Octagon Station], a doujin circle, created a 3D Senkousha [[online game]], with robots dueling each other in the [[Yokohama Chinatown]]. * The robot is depicted in the [[anime]] ''[[Puni Puni Poemy]]'' dancing past the Aasu's house. * In the anime and [[manga]] ''[[Yakitate!! Japan]]'', Azuma and Kawachi thought of a robot that looked awfully similar to the Senkousha when told that they are only bread-making machines. * In episode 14 of ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex]]'', there is an android related to the Chinese mafia named Pioneer which has a cannon protruding out of its groin area. * In the first episode of ''[[Negima!?]]'', a model of Senkousha is seen standing on Chao Lingshen's desk. * In the twenty-third episode of ''[[Rizelmine]]'', Lan-lan, the artificial human from China is seen riding on top of a robot who looks like Senkousha during the chase scene. * Norikuni Iwata from ''[[Excel Saga]]'' received a Senkousha figurine from his co-worker, Daimaru Sumiyoshi, out of pity in Volume Eight of the [[manga]]. It appears on pages 76 and 83 of both the Japanese and American version. * A modification called Parallel Worlds for ''[[Battlefield 1942]]'' features the Senkousha as an operable vehicle, complete with crotch mounted cannon. == References == * {{note|xinhua}} [[Xinhua News Agency]].
