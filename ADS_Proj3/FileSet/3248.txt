DO loops counted incorrectly! DO loops would count 1,2,3,5,6,7, …! A quick patch was released to fix this. ==OS/8 Trivia== {{Trivia|date=April 2010}} * OS/8 did no time-keeping, but if told the date, it would willingly store that date as part of the directory information maintained for each file in the filesystem. The OS/8 calendar originally spanned only the 8 years from 1970 through 1977, but it was later extended with a special release of the OS (version 3D) to incorporate the idea of an 8-year sliding "window". The [[Year 2000 problem|Y2K problem]] arrived '''very''' early for PDP-8 programmers. The sliding window had to be implemented in a very clever way, as there was absolutely no more room in the system data area for extra year bits. The clever programmers at DEC realized that every copy of OS/8 had a [[HLT]] instruction at a particular address in the memory-resident code (the [[HLT]] was the last resort if the system could not read in an overlay from disk). The [[HLT]] instruction had a particular bit in it that could be set without affecting the operation of the instruction. So they redefined that bit to mean "use the sliding date window algorithm" for calculating dates. * The archetypical bootstrap routine for a PDP-8 with RK05 mass storage was as follows: ::30/ 6743 (Initiate a disk read of the boot block) ::31/ 5031 (Jump to location 31) ::Load Address 30 ::Press CLEAR (Cleared all disk registers) ::Press CONTinue (start at address 30) :This would read block 0000 of RKO5 disk 0 to address 0000 of field 0. Addresses 30 and 31 of that boot block would overlay those instructions with the sequence: 30: "skip on disk done", 31: "JMP 30", which would cause the CPU to wait for the operation to complete, then continue on in the bootstrap. * OS/8 CCL implemented the famous [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]] "[[Text Editor and Corrector#Trivia|.MAKE LOVE]]" joke. * '''ALL''' of OS/8 was described in a single, rather-thick "OS/8 Handbook". There were separate guides for writing device drivers and such. * To economize on the size of the memory-resident device tables, OS/8 hashed the device names from four characters down to two, by adding the two words. So device names were not unique — your could type "RKB0:" or the word-swapped "B0RK:" and the system did not care. In practice this was not a noticeable problem. * OS/8 was capable of running with absolutely no changes, "virtualized" under RTS8, a real-time multi-tasking OS. RTS8 provided interrupt-driven virtualized device handlers under OS/8. {{DEC Operating Systems}} [[Category:DEC Operating Systems]]</text> </page> <page> <id>26953</id> <title>OSHCA</title> <text>The '''Open Source Health Care Alliance''' is an international collaboration promoting the development and use of [[open source software]] and open access publications in the health care domain.

OSHCA was first formed in 1999 as an informal organization of interested parties. The organization achieved formal non-profit status in Malaysia on 31 October, 2006 under the leadership of Dr. Molly Cheah and a protem committee of industry leaders. The first AGM will be held in 2007 following the OSHCA2007 conference (May 8-11) at the Federal Hotel in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]]. == Mission == OSHCA defines its mission as * Promote to policy makers the concept of Free/Open Source Software in Health Care so as to adopt or give equal opportunity to Free/Open Source Solutions. * Provide leadership role in refining the Free/Open Source Software Concepts as applied to health care to ensure best practices and patient safety are not compromised. * Make recommendations on the development and use of Health information Standards for data interchange and representation formalisms. * Provide Guidelines for Quality Control on Free/Open Source Health Care Software development. * Participate in and support Human Capacity Building, including contributing/participating in project proposals and project management to achieve developing country priorities. * Enable collaboration of members including, sharing technical knowledge in Free/Open Source Health Care Projects and providing information Resources to Free/Open Source Health Care software developers. *Promote and help the formation of development consortia for health care related projects, including assisting in finding funding for projects to reach critical mass for a visible and lasting impact on health related [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs). * Use collaboration with strategic organisations with compatible goals as a means of achieving the mission. == External links == * [http://www.oshca.org official website] [[Category:Health care informatics]] [[Category:Health sciences]] [[Category:Free and open source software organizations]] [[Category:Software engineering organizations]]</text> </page> <page> <id>26954</id> <title>OSI model</title> <text>{{OSIstack}} The '''Open Systems Interconnection model''' ('''OSI model''') is a product of the [[Open Systems Interconnection]] effort at the [[International Organization for Standardization]]. It is a way of sub-dividing a [[communications system]] into smaller parts called layers. A layer is a collection of similar functions that provide services to the layer above it and receives services from the layer below it. On each layer, an ''[[Instance (computer science)|instance]]'' provides services to the instances at the layer above and requests service from the layer below. For example, a layer that provides error-free communications across a network provides the path needed by applications above it, while it calls the next lower layer to send and receive packets that make up the contents of the path. Two instances at one layer are connected by a horizontal connection on that layer. Most network protocols used in the market today are based on [[TCP/IP]] stacks. [[File:OSI-model-Communication.svg|thumb|400px|Communication in the OSI-Model (Example with layers 3 to 5)]] ==History== Work on a layered model of network architecture was started and the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) began to develop its OSI framework architecture. OSI has two major components: an abstract model of networking, called the Basic Reference Model or seven-layer model, and a set of specific protocols.
