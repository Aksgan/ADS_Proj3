sources involve generalization, analysis, synthesis, interpretation, or evaluation of the original information. ''Primary'' and ''secondary'' are relative terms, and some sources may be classified as primary or secondary, depending on how it is used.<!-- FOOTNOTE--><ref>{{Citation | last=Kragh | first=Helge | title=An Introduction to the Historiography of Science | year=1989 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=0521389216 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=d2zy_QSq2b0C&pg=PA121&lpg=PA121&dq=%22secondary+source%22+historiography |page=121 }} ("[T]he distinction is not a sharp one.

One such model is the [[UNISIST model]] of information dissemination. Within such a model these concepts are defined in relation to each other, and the acceptance of this way of defining the concepts are connected to the acceptance of the model. Other languages, like German, call the secondary sources ''Sekundärliteratur'', leaving ''Sekundärquelle'' to historiography. A ''Sekundärquelle'' is a source that can tell about a (lost) ''Primärquelle'', e.g. a letter is quoting from minutes that no longer exist and can not be consulted by the historian. ===In science and medicine=== In the sciences, a [[Review journal|review article]], book review, or [[meta-analysis]] are both examples of a secondary source. Some [[academic journals]] only publish reviews. Unlike in the [[humanities]], scientific and medical [[peer review]]ed sources are not generally considered secondary unless they are a review or a meta-analysis. Some scientific document [[search engine]]s, such as [[PubMed]], allow users to limit their searches to reviews and meta-analyses.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/advanced PubMed advanced search] form</ref> Secondary sources can help trace the history of scientific and mathematical ideas, including who is credited as the original source of the idea. A survey of previous work in the field in a primary peer-reviewed source is secondary. This vastly increases the amount of secondary source information available when there are few reviews in a field. ====Library and information science==== In [[library and information science]]s, secondary sources are generally regarded as those sources that summarize or add commentary to [[primary sources]] in the context of the particular information or idea under study.<ref>[http://www.lib.umd.edu/guides/primary-sources.html "Primary, secondary and tertiary sources"]</ref><ref>[http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml "Library Guides: Primary, secondary and tertiary sources"]</ref> ==== Mathematics ==== An important use of secondary sources in the field of [[mathematics]] has been to make difficult mathematical ideas and proofs from primary sources more accessible to the public;<ref>{{Citation |last=Edwards |first=H.M.|authorlink=Harold Edwards (mathematician) |title=Riemann's Zeta Function |year=2001 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |publication-place=Mineola, New York |isbn=0486417409 |page=xi |url=http://books.google.com/?id=5uLAoued_dIC&pg=PR9&dq=%22primary+sources%22 }} ("The purpose of a secondary source is to make the primary sources accessible to you. If you can read and understand the primary sources without reading this book, more power to you. If you read this book without reading the primary sources you are like a man who carries a sack lunch to a banquet.")</ref> in other sciences [[tertiary source]]s are expected to fulfill the introductory role. ===In humanities and history=== Primary sources are those closest to an event, such as diaries and first-hand newspaper and magazine accounts. In the [[humanities]], unlike the [[science]]s and [[medicine]], secondary sources in history and humanities are usually newspaper, magazine, [[academic journal]], or other written accounts from the perspective of a different person than the person who experienced the event. In the humanities, a [[peer review]]ed article is always a secondary source, but isn't necessarily secondary in the sciences.
