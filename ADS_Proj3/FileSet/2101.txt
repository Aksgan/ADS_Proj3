the first being an high level assessment to identify high risks, while the other iterations detailed the analysis of the major risks and other risks. According to [[National Information Assurance Training and Education Center]] risk assessment in the IT field is:<ref name="NIATEC Glossary of terms"/> # ''A study of the vulnerabilities, threats, likelihood, loss or impact, and theoretical effectiveness of security measures. Managers use the results of a risk assessment to develop security requirements and specifications.'' # ''The process of evaluating threats and vulnerabilities, known and postulated, to determine expected loss and establish the degree of acceptability to system operations.'' # ''An identification of a specific ADP facility's assets, the threats to these assets, and the ADP facility's vulnerability to those threats.'' # An analysis of system assets and vulnerabilities to establish an expected loss from certain events based on estimated probabilities of the occurrence of those events. The purpose of a risk assessment is to determine if countermeasures are adequate to reduce the probability of loss or the impact of loss to an acceptable level. '' #''A management tool which provides a systematic approach for determining the relative value and sensitivity of computer installation assets, assessing vulnerabilities, assessing loss expectancy or perceived risk exposure levels, assessing existing protection features and additional protection alternatives or acceptance of risks and documenting management decisions. Decisions for implementing additional protection features are normally based on the existence of a reasonable ratio between cost/benefit of the safeguard and sensitivity/value of the assets to be protected. Risk assessments may vary from an informal review of a small scale microcomputer installation to a more formal and fully documented analysis (i. e. , risk analysis) of a large scale computer installation. Risk assessment methodologies may vary from qualitative or quantitative approaches to any combination of these two approaches.'' === ISO 27005 framework === Risk assessment receives as input the output of the previous step [[#Context establishment|Context establishment]]; the output is the list of assessed risks prioritized according to risk evaluation criteria. The process can divided in the following steps:<ref name=ISO27005/> * [[Risk analysis (engineering)|Risk analysis]], further divided in: ** [[#Risk Identification|Risk identification]] ** [[#Risk estimation|Risk estimation]] * [[#Risk evaluation|Risk evaluation]] The following table compare these ISO 27005 processes with [[Risk IT]] framework processes:<ref name=RISKITP/> {| class="wikitable" |+ Risk assessment constituent processes |- !

For each [[risk scenario]], taking into consideration the different [[risk factor (computing)|risk factors]] a [[Single loss expectancy]] (SLE) is determined. Then, considering the probability of occurrence on a given period basis, for example the annual rate of occurrence (ARO), the [[Annualized Loss Expectancy]] is determined as the product of ARO X SLE.<ref name="Vacca"/> It is important to point out that the values of [[asset (computing)|assets]] to be considered are those of all involved assets, not only the value of the directly affected resource.<br /> For example, if you consider the risk scenario of a [[Laptop theft]] threat, you should consider the value of the data (a related asset) contained in the computer and the reputation and liability of the company (other assets) deriving from the lost of availability and confidentiality of the data that could be involved. It is easy to understand that [[intangible asset]]s (data, reputation, liability) can be worth much more than physical resources at risk (the laptop hardware in the example). <ref>[http://articles.cnn.com/2009-01-27/politics/va.data.theft_1_laptop-personal-data-single-veteran?_s=PM:POLITICS CNN article about a class action settlement for a Veteran Affair stolen laptop]</ref> Intangible asset value can be huge, but is not easy to evaluate: this can be a consideration against a pure quantitative approach.<ref name=FAIR/> Qualitative risk assessment (three to five steps evaluation, from Very High to Low) is performed when the organization requires a risk assessment be performed in a relatively short time or to meet a small budget, a significant quantity of relevant data is not available, or the persons performing the assessment don't have the sophisticated mathematical, financial, and risk assessment
