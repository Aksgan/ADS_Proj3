Its [[Dawning 4000A]] and [[Dawning 5000A]] clusters were both ranked tenth in June 2004 and November 2008 [[TOP500]] lists respectively. Dawning has manufactured some of the fastest supercomputers in the world including [[Nebulae (computer)|Nebulae]], the second fastest computer in the June 2010 TOP500 list. ==Dawning Supercomputers== ===Dawning No.1=== The very first member of Dawning family is Dawning No.1 (Shuguang Yihao, 曙光一号), which received state certification in October 1993. This supercomputer achieved 640 million [[FLOPS]] and utilizes [[MC88100|Motorola 88100]] CPUs (4 total) and 88200 CPUs (8 total), and over 20 were built. The operating system is UNIX V. ===Dawning 1000=== Originally named as Dawning No.2 (Shuguang Erhao, 曙光二号) but subsequently renamed as Dawning 1000, this is the second generation of the family, and received state certification on May 11, 1995. This is the first Chinese built supercomputer that is capable of 1 billion FLOPS. This series of the Dawning family consists of the Dawning 1000A and 1000L. ===Dawning 2000=== The third member of the Dawning family is Dawning 2000, which passed state certification on Jan 28, 2000. The number of CPUs used was greatly
