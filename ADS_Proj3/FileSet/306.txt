and Co., London p. 541</ref> ==Asymptotes of functions== The asymptotes most commonly encountered in the study of [[calculus]] are of curves of the form {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''&fnof;''(''x'')}}. These can be computed using [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] and classified into ''horizontal'', ''vertical'' and ''oblique'' asymptotes depending on its orientation with respect to the ''X''-axis. Horizontal asymptotes are horizontal lines that the graph of the function approaches as ''x'' tends to +∞ or &minus;∞. As the name indicate they are parallel to the ''X''-axis. Vertical asymptotes are vertical lines (perpendicular to the ''X''-axis) near which the function grows without bound. Oblique asymptotes are diagonal lines so that the difference between the curve and the line approaches 0 as ''x'' tends to +∞ or &minus;∞. More general type of asymptotes can be defined in this case. ===Vertical asymptotes=== The line ''x'' = ''a'' is a ''vertical asymptote'' of the graph of the function {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''&fnof;''(''x'')}} <!-- Some confusion as to notation, commenting out for now if : <math>\lim_{x \to a} f(x)=\infty,</math> or more generally, --> if at least one of the following statements is true: # <math>\lim_{x \to a^{-}} f(x)=\pm\infty</math> # <math>\lim_{x \to a^{+}} f(x)=\pm\infty.</math> <!-- For example, if ƒ(''x'') = ''x''/(''x''-1), the numerator approaches 1 and the denominator approaches 0 as ''x'' approaches 1. So :<math>\lim_{x\to 1}\frac{x}{x-1}=\infty</math> and the curve has a vertical asymptote of ''x''=1. --> The function ''ƒ''(''x'') may or may not be defined at ''a'', and its precise value at the point ''x'' = ''a'' does not affect the asymptote. For example, for the function :<math>f(x) = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{x} & \mbox{if } x > 0, \\ 5 & \mbox{if } x \le 0. \end{cases}</math> has a limit of +∞ as {{nowrap|''x'' &rarr; 0<sup>+</sup>}}, ''ƒ''(''x'') has the vertical asymptote {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 0}}, even though ''ƒ''(0) = 5. The graph of this function does intersect the vertical asymptote once, at (0,5). It is impossible for the graph of a function to intersect a vertical asymptote (or a vertical line in general) in more than one point. ===Horizontal asymptotes=== [[File:Asymptote03.png|right|frame|The graph of a function can have two horizontal asymptotes. An example of such a function would be <math>y=\arctan(x).</math>]] ''Horizontal asymptotes'' are horizontal lines that the graph of the function approaches as {{nowrap|''x'' &rarr; ±&infin;}}. The horizontal line ''y'' = ''c'' is a horizontal asymptote of the function ''y'' = ''ƒ''(''x'') if :<math>\lim_{x\rightarrow -\infty}f(x)=c</math> or <math>\lim_{x \to +\infty} f(x) = c.</math> In the first case, ''ƒ''(''x'') has ''y'' = ''c'' as asymptote when ''x'' tends to &minus;∞, and in the second that ''ƒ''(''x'') has ''y'' = ''c'' as an asymptote as ''x'' tends to +∞ For example the arctangent function satisfies :<math>\lim_{x\rightarrow -\infty}\arctan(x)=-\pi/2</math> and <math>\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}\arctan(x)=\pi/2.</math> So the line {{nowrap|1=''y'' = &minus;&pi;/2}} is a horizontal tangent for the arctangent when ''x'' tends to &minus;∞, and {{nowrap|1=''y'' = &pi;/2}} is a horizontal tangent for the arctangent when ''x'' tends to +∞. Functions may lack horizontal asymptotes on either or both sides, or may have one horizontal asymptote that is the same in both directions. For example, the function {{nowrap|1=ƒ(''x'') = 1/(''x''<sup>2</sup>+1)}} has a horizontal asymptote at ''y'' = 0 when ''x'' tends both to &minus;∞ and +∞ because, respectively, :<math>\lim_{x\to -\infty}\frac{1}{x^2+1}=\lim_{x\to +\infty}\frac{1}{x^2+1}=0.</math> ===Oblique asymptotes=== [[File:1-over-x-plus-x.svg|right|thumb|220px|In the graph of <math>f(x)=x+\tfrac{1}{x}</math>, the ''y''-axis (''x'' = 0) and the line ''y''= ''x'' are both asymptotes.]] When a linear asymptote is not parallel to the ''x''- or ''y''-axis, it is called an ''oblique asymptote'' or ''slant asymptote''. A function ''f''(''x'') is asymptotic to the straight line {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''mx'' + ''n''}} (''m'' ≠ 0) if <math>\lim_{x \to +\infty}\left[ f(x)-(mx+n)\right] = 0 \, \mbox{ or } \lim_{x \to -\infty}\left[ f(x)-(mx+n)\right] = 0.</math> In the first case the line {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''mx'' + ''n''}} is an oblique asymptote of ''ƒ''(''x'') when ''x'' tends to +∞, and in the second case the line {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''mx'' + ''n''}} is an oblique asymptote of ''ƒ(x)'' when ''x'' tends to &minus;∞ An example is ƒ(''x'') = ''x''&minus;1/''x'', which has the oblique asymptote ''y'' = ''x'' (''m'' = 1, ''n'' = 0) as seen in the limits :<math>\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}\left[f(x)-x\right]</math> :<math>=\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}\left[\frac{x^2-1}{x}-x\right]</math> :<math>=\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}\left[(x-\frac{1}{x})-x\right]</math> :<math>=\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}-\frac{1}{x}=0.</math> == Elementary methods for identifying asymptotes == Asymptotes of many elementary functions can be found without the explicit use of limits (although the derivations of such methods typically use limits). ===General computation of oblique asymptotes for functions=== The oblique asymptote, for the function ''f''(''x''), will be given by the equation ''y''=''mx''+''n''. The value for ''m'' is computed first and is given by :<math>m\stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\lim_{x\rightarrow a}f(x)/x</math> where ''a'' is either <math>-\infty</math> or <math>=\infty</math> depending on the case being studied. It is good practice to treat the two cases separately. If this limit doesn't exist then there is no oblique asymptote in that direction. Having ''m'' then the value for ''n'' can be computed by :<math>n\stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\lim_{x\rightarrow a}(f(x)-mx)</math> where ''a'' should be the same value used before. If this limit fails to exist then there is no oblique asymptote in that direction, even should limit defining ''m'' exist. Otherwise {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''mx'' + ''n''}} is the oblique asymptote of ''ƒ''(''x'') as ''x'' tends to ''a''. For example, the function {{nowrap|1=''&fnof;''(''x'') = (2''x''<sup>2</sup> + 3''x'' + 1)/''x''}} has :<math>m=\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}f(x)/x=\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}\frac{2x^2+3x+1}{x^2}=2</math> and then :<math>n=\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}(f(x)-mx)=\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}\left(\frac{2x^2+3x+1}{x}-2x\right)=3</math> so that {{nowrap|1=''y'' = 2''x'' + 3}} is the asymptote of ''ƒ''(''x'') when ''x'' tends to +∞. The function {{nowrap|1=''&fnof;''(''x'') = ln ''x''}} has :<math>m=\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}f(x)/x=\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}\frac{\ln x}{x}=0</math> and then :<math>n=\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}(f(x)-mx)=\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}\ln x</math>, which does not exist. So {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ln ''x''}} does not have an asymptote when ''x'' tends to +∞. === Asymptotes for rational functions === A [[rational function]] has at most one horizontal asymptote or oblique (slant) asymptote, and possibly many vertical asymptotes. The [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] of the numerator and degree of the denominator determine whether or not there are any horizontal or oblique asymptotes. The cases are tabulated below, where deg(numerator) is the degree of the numerator, and deg(denominator) is the degree of the denominator. {| class="wikitable" |+ Table listing the cases of horizontal and oblique asymptotes for rational functions |- ! deg(numerator) −<br/>deg(denominator) ! asymptotes ! example asymptote |- | < 0 | ''y''
