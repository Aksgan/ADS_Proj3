Public access to the [[World Wide Web]] became widespread in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The low-cost distribution technology has fueled the OA movement, and prompted both the Green OA self-archiving of non-OA journal articles and the creation of Gold OA journals. Conventional non-OA journals cover publishing costs through access tolls such as subscriptions, site-licenses or pay-per-view. Some non-OA journals provide OA after an [[Embargo (academic publishing)|embargo]] period of 6–12 months or longer (see "[[Delayed open access journal]]s"). Active debate over the economics and reliability of various ways of providing OA continues among [[researcher]]s, academics, [[librarians]], [[university]] administrators, [[funding agency|funding agencies]], government officials, commercial [[publisher]]s, and [[learned society|society]] publishers. ==Adoption statistics== An empirical study published in 2010 showed that of the total output of peer-reviewed articles roughly 20 % could be found Openly Accessible.<ref>http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0011273</ref> 8,5 % of the journal literature could be found free at the publishers’ sites (“Gold OA”), of which 62 % in full OA journals, 14 % in subscription journals making their electronic versions free after a delay, and 24 % as individually open articles (against payment) in otherwise subscription journals. For an additional 11,9 % of the articles free full text copies were found elsewhere (“Green OA”) in either subject-based repositories (43 %), institutional repositories (24%) or on the home pages of the authors or their departments (33%). These copies were further classified into exact copies of the published article (38 %), manuscripts as accepted for publishing (46 %) or manuscripts as submitted (15 %). [[File:OA by Discipline.png|none|left|480px|alt=Open Access by Discipline 2009]] Chemistry (13 %) had the lowest overall share of OA of all scientific fields, Earth Sciences (33%) the highest. In medicine, biochemistry and chemistry gold publishing in OA journals was more common than the author posting of manuscripts in repositories. In all other fields author-posted green copies dominated the picture. ==Manner of distribution== Like the self-archived Green OA articles, most Gold OA journal articles are distributed via the [[World Wide Web]],<ref name="earlham.edu"/> due to low distribution costs, increasing reach, speed, and increasing importance for scholarly communication. [[Open source software]] is sometimes used for [[institutional repositories]],<ref>[http://www.soros.org/openaccess/software/ Budapest Open Access Initiative]</ref> OA journal websites,<ref>[http://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/ Open Journal Systems | Public Knowledge Project]</ref> and other aspects of OA provision and OA publishing. Gratis OA articles are free online and Libre OA articles have limited copyright and licensing restrictions.<ref name="arl.org"/> Access to online content requires Internet access, and this distributional consideration presents physical and sometimes financial "barriers" to access. Proponents of OA argue that Internet access barriers are relatively low in many circumstances, that efforts should be made to subsidize universal Internet access, whereas pay-for-access presents a relatively high additional barrier over and above Internet access itself. OA can be provided by traditional publishers, or under other arrangements. Some OA publishers, such as [[Public Library of Science]] (PLoS), publish only OA journals; others publish OA as well as subscription-based journals. ==Methods of financing gold OA publishing== Advertising is a major source of funding for mass media that do not charge for content, as well as modern [[web site]]s and [[search engine]]s. [[Public broadcasting]] relies on government funding and voluntary donations from consumers. Direct private funding from the author for web hosting is very common on the Internet, and is also a traditional mechanism for wealthy print authors. [[Non-profit organization]]s often freely distribute advocacy materials, and some fund free [[public art]] or the production of artistic works. In scholarly publishing, there are many business models for OA journals. Some charge publication fees (paid by authors or by their funding agencies or employers) and some do not. Some of the no-fee journals have institutional subsidies and some do not. For more detail, see [[open access journals]]. Roughly half<ref>[http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/overview.htm "Open Access Overview"], Peter Suber, June 19, 2007</ref> the Gold OA journals have author fees to cover the cost of publishing (e.g. PLoS fees vary from $1,300 to $2,850<ref>[http://www.plos.org/journals/pubfees.html Publication Fees for PLoS Journals]</ref>) instead of reader subscription fees. Advertising revenue and/or funding from foundations and institutions are also used to provide funding. ==Authors and researchers== The main reason authors make their articles openly accessible is to maximize their [[impact factor|research impact]]. A study in 2001 first reported an OA [[citation impact]] advantage,<ref>[http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/online-nature01/ Online or Invisible? Steve Lawrence; NEC Research Institute]</ref> and a growing number of studies<ref name=autogenerated3>[http://opcit.eprints.org/oacitation-biblio.html Effect of OA on citation impact: a bibliography of studies]</ref> have confirmed, with varying degrees of methodological rigor, that an OA article is more likely to be used and cited than one behind subscription barriers.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> For example, a 2006 study in ''[[PLoS Biology]]'' found that articles published as immediate open access in ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]]'' were three times more likely to be cited than non-open access papers, and were also cited more than ''PNAS'' articles that were only self-archived.<ref>Eysenbach G (2006).

PLoS Biol 4(5): e157 doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0040157</ref> This result has been challenged as possibly due to authors self-selectively making higher quality articles OA,<ref>[http://ideas.repec.org/p/cmi/wpaper/cemi-workingpaper-2008-007.html Getting cited: does open access help?]</ref> but a recent study comparing self-selected OA with mandated OA found that the citation advantage remained just as big when the OA was mandated.<ref>[http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/18493 Gargouri, Y., Hajjem,
