rotor inertia can be converted to sufficient lift to enable a survivable landing. This occurs abruptly with airspeeds much below the ideal autorotative speed (typically 40-80 [[Knot (speed)|knots]]). The pilot must have enough [[time]] to [[acceleration|accelerate]] to autorotation speed in order to be able to successfully autorotate; this directly relates to a requirement for height. Above a certain height the pilot can achieve autorotation speed even from a 0-knot start, thus putting "high hovers" outside the curve. The typical safe takeoff profile will involve initiation of forward flight from a low hover, only gaining height as airspeed approaches a safe autorotative speed but keeping above the lower right area of the H/V curve. ==See also== *[[Autorotation (helicopter)]] *[[Loss of tail-rotor effectiveness]] *[[Coffin corner (aviation)]] ==External links== * http://www.copters.com/pilot/hvcurve.html [[Category:Helicopter aerodynamics]] [[Category:Aviation terminology]] [[Category:Aviation risks]] [[Category:Diagrams]] [[sv:Höjd-hastighetsdiagram]]</text> </page> <page> <id>16478</id> <title>HeinOnline</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=March 2009}} '''HeinOnline''', sometimes spelled '''Hein Online''', is an internet service launched in 2000 that is a source of [[legal]] information, much like [[Westlaw]] and [[LexisNexis]]. Like those services, use of HeinOnline requires a subscription, although most{{citation needed|date=March 2009}} law schools provide access to students for free. It is published by William S. Hein & Co. ==Overview== There are three major distinctions between this service and other such services in terms of the scope and type of materials offered. #HeinOnline provides a narrower scope of materials, excluding [[newspaper]] reports, as well as most federal and all state case law and most administrative material. #With respect to law reviews, HeinOnline is far more comprehensive,{{citation needed|date=March 2009}} with material that in some cases stretches back to the mid-19th century. #HeinOnline's materials are available only as [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] files, digitized scans of the original journal pages. While HeinOnline does not offer a [[Index term|keyword]] search per se, it does have a full-text [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] search capability. ==Contents== The service delivers:{{citation needed|date=March 2009}} * ''Law Journal Library'' * ''[[American Bar Association Journal]]'' (1915–1983) * ''Core U.S./Most Cited Law Journals'' * ''Criminal Justice Journals'' * ''International & Non-U.S. Law Journals'' * ''Intellectual Property Library'' * ''Most-Cited Law Journals'' * ''American Law Institute Library'' * ''[[Code of Federal Regulations]]'' * ''[[English Reports]]'', full reprint (1220-1865) * ''European Center for Minority Issues'' * ''[[Federal Register]] Library'' * ''Foreign & International Law Resources Database'' * ''Legal Classics'' * ''New York Court of Appeals Records and Briefs'' * ''Philip C.

The remote controlled camera mount system allows pan, tilt and roll movements. A [[wireless]] onboard video transmitter downlinks the live signal to the camera operator, images can be recorded on board, on the ground or both. The system is controlled by two operators with independent controls: the helicam pilot and camera operator. One of the characteristics of the '''helicam''' is the flexibility and small size. The system can be flown practically everywhere providing a small spot of about 4 square meters is available to take off and land. Flight endurance ranges from 15 to 30 minutes, refueling can be done in seconds. The latest generation Helicam uses [[turbine]] engines to improve endurance and usability. Newer versions feature electric propulsion, using lithium polymer batteries. The benefit of electric propulsion is reduced vibration and environmental impact. The field of use of these systems range from advertising, survey, exploration, SAR, military, cinematography, etc. The advent of miniaturized [[GPS]] guided auto-piloting systems will expand the use of these systems to a new level.

It was chosen because the group beliefs that nobody cares for those who are poor or those who did not had the same chances like studied hackers. It was also chosen to point out that the members just do what they are ready to do even if it conflicts with laws or civil restrictions like beliefs or ethics. The origin of the name may be traced to the fact that "Helith" was founded in Germany and thus accident German was chosen for the group name. Some of the founding members of Helith shared a belief and talked during a [[Chaos Communication Congress]] Congress in 1998-1999 in [[Germany]] at an improved round table conference about what needs to get done to reach this goal. At the conference Rembrandt was chosen to be the public link
