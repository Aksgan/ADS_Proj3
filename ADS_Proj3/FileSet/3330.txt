society can benefit from the results of that research; in the form of new medical treatments, for example. Publishers claim that 90% of potential readers can access 90% of all available content through national or research libraries, and while this may not be as easy as accessing an article online directly it is certainly possible <ref>Worlock, K. (2004). The Pros and Cons of Open Access. Accessed online http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/accessdebate/34.html, Nature.</ref> ." The argument for tax-payer funded research is only applicable in certain countries as well. For instance in Australia, 80% of research funding comes through taxes, whereas in Japan and Switzerland, only approximately 10% is from the public coffers <ref>Worlock, K. (2004). The Pros and Cons of Open Access. Accessed online http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/accessdebate/34.html, Nature</ref>. ===Funding issues=== The "article processing charges" for open access shifts the burden of payment from readers to authors, which could conceivably create a new set of concerns. For example, budget processes may need adjustments to provide funding for the "article processing charges" required to publish in almost all open access journals (e.g. those published by [[BioMed Central]] [http://www.biomedcentral.com/info/authors/apcfaq#why]). Unless discounts are available to authors from countries with low incomes or external funding is provided to cover the cost, article processing charges could exclude authors from developing countries or less well-funded research fields from publishing in open access journals. However, under the traditional model, the prohibitive cost of non-open access journal subscriptions would preclude conducting any research in the first place. Moreover, many open access publishers offer discounts or publishing fee waivers to authors from developing countries or those suffering financial hardship. [[Self-archiving]] of non-OA publications also provides a low cost alternative model <ref>Corrado, E. (2005). The importance of Open Access, Open Source, and Open Standards for libraries. Issues in Science and Technology Librarianship.</ref>. Outside of science and academia, it is unusual for producers of creative output to be financially compensated on anything other than a pay-for-access model. (Notable exceptions include [[open source software]] and public broadcasting.) Successful writers, for example, support themselves by the revenues generated by people purchasing copies of their works; publishing houses are able to finance the publication of new authors based on anticipated revenues from sales of those that are successful. Opponents of open access would argue that without direct financial compensation via pay-for-access, many authors would be unable to afford to write, though some would accept the economic hardship of holding down a [[day job]] while continuing to write as a "labor of love". However, this argument has no relevance to [[academic publishing]], because scientific journals do not pay royalties to article authors. ===Citation study=== A study published in the British Medical Journal<ref>[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/337/jul31_1/a568 Open access publishing, article downloads, and citations: randomised controlled trial] BMJ 2008(31 July);337:a568</ref> disputes the claim that open access articles equal more citations. In the study, researchers from [[Cornell University]] randomly made some journal articles freely available while keeping others available by subscription only in order to determine whether increased access to journal articles results in more article downloads and citations. They found, in an interim analysis, that in the first year after the articles were published, open-access articles were downloaded more but were no more likely to be cited than subscription-based articles.<ref>[http://newswise.com/articles/view/543150/ Free Articles Get Read but Don't Generate More Citations] Newswise, Retrieved on July 31, 2008.</ref> However, many responses to the paper argue that the interim analysis was premature.<ref>[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/337/jul31_1/a568 Rapid Responses to BMJ 2008;337:a568]</ref> ==Comparison with other media== Many traditional media such as certain [[newspapers]], [[television]], and [[radio]] broadcasts could be considered "open access". These include [[commercial broadcasting]] and free newspapers supported by [[advertising]], [[public broadcasting]], and privately funded political advocacy materials. Minor barriers are also present in other media: broadcast media require receiving equipment, online content requires Internet access, and locally distributed printed media requires transportation to a distribution point. Many other types of material can also be published in this manner: [[magazine]]s and newsletters, [[e-text]] or other [[e-book]]s, music, fine arts, or any product of intellectual activity. ==See also== {{Cleanup|section|date=December 2008}} * [[Academic publishing]] * [[Conservation Commons]] * [[Creative Commons]] * [[GenBank]] * [[List of academic journal search engines]] * [[List of open access projects]] * [[Open Communication]] * [[Open textbook]] * [[PubChem]] * [[Public Knowledge]] * [[Science Commons]] * [[Serials crisis]] ===Movements=== * [[Access to Knowledge movement]] (A2K) * [[Free culture movement]] * [[Open publishing]] (different from "open access" publishing) ===Related types of content=== * [[Libre knowledge]] * [[Open content]] * [[Open data]] * [[Open source]] * [[Public domain]] - refers to [[copyright]] status ===Open access publishers=== * [[BioMed Central]] * [[Directory of Open Access Journals]] (DOAJ) * [[Medknow Publications]] * [[Hindawi Publishing Corporation]] * [[Perspectivia.net]] * [[Public Library of Science]] * [[re.press]] * [[SciELO]] * [[The Open Source Science Project]] * [[Versita Open]] ===Open Access organizations=== * [[SPARC Europe]] ==References== {{citation style|date=October 2010}} {{reflist|colwidth=30em}} ==Further reading== {{further reading|date=December 2010}} * [http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/Timeline Timeline of the Open Access Movement] (started by [[Peter Suber]] and as of 2010 maintained at The Open Access Directory by researchers at Simmons College Graduate School of Library and Information Science) * [http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11030.html Esanu,Julie M. & Uhlir, Paul F.
