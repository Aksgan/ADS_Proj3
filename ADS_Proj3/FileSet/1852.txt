time were not public records, and processing them required laborious typing and the completion of plans by hand using paintbrushes and ink. Copies of everything produced had to be made by hand. The Land Registry retained the originals, and the copies were sewn, using needle and thread, into large certificates. The certificates were produced as indisputable evidence of the ownership of the land. Such was the importance of the certificates that tampering with them was a criminal offence. In 1986 the Plymouth Office became the first Land Registry office to produce registers electronically. Although the certificates still bore the same importance, computerisation dramatically increased the efficiency of the Land Register at a time when it was keen to bring the whole of England and Wales under compulsory registration. In 1990 the provision of compulsory registration was brought to the whole of England and Wales, the ten millionth title was registered, and. for the first time, the Land Register was opened to public inspection. Although compulsory registration had now spread to the whole of its jurisdiction, compulsion only occurred when a property was sold. This was a serious bar to the registration of the whole of England and Wales, and in 1998 new triggers for registration were introduced, dramatically increasing the rate of registration of land. These triggers included gifts of land, assent of land on death and raising monies by mortgages on the land. The [[Land Registration Act 2002]] leaves the system substantially in place, but enables the future compulsory introduction of electronic conveyancing, using electronic signatures to transfer and register property. The new home of the Information Systems department, a state-of-the-art office with 500 staff, was opened in 2005 in Plymouth's International Business Park. Although currently only just over half of the landmass of England and Wales is registered, the Land Registry's aim is that all marketable property will be registered by 2012. ==See also== * [[Rural Land Register]] * [[National Land & Property Gazetteer]] * [[Torrens system]] ==Bibliography== *{{ cite book | title = Ten Chief Land Registrars | author=Mayer, P. | year = 1996 | location = London }} *{{ cite journal | author = &mdash; & Pemberton, A. | title= A Short History of Land Registration in England and Wales | publisher = HM Land Registry | year = 2000 | location = London | url = http://www.landreg.gov.uk/assets/library/documents/bhist-lr.pdf | accessdate = 2010-10-19 }} *{{ cite book | title = Property and Politics: 1870-1914 | author = Offer, A. | location = Cambridge | year = 1981 }} *{{ cite book | title = HM Land Registry - An Historical Perspective | author = Pemberton, A. | location = London | publisher = HM Land Registry | year = 1992 }} *{{ cite book | title = Land Law | author = Riddall, J.G. | publisher = 7th ed., Lexis-Nexis Butterworths | year= 2003 | isbn=0-406-96743-1 }} Ch.26 for current law in England and Wales *{{ cite book | author = Rowton-Simpson, S. | title = Land Law and Registration | location = Cambridge | year = 1976 }} ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== {{commonscat|HM Land Registry}} * [http://www.landregistry.gov.uk Land Registry website] * [http://www.ros.gov.uk/index.html Registers of Scotland website] {{Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)}} {{Departments of the United Kingdom Government|type=Non-ministerial|title=HM Land Registry}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Hm Land Registry}} [[Category:English property law]] [[Category:Housing in the United Kingdom]] [[Category:Executive agencies of the United Kingdom government]] [[Category:Databases in the United Kingdom]] [[Category:1862 establishments in the United Kingdom]] [[simple:HM Land Registry]]</text> </page> <page> <id>16043</id> <title>HOLAP</title> <text>HOLAP ('''H'''ybrid '''O'''n'''l'''ine '''A'''nalytical '''P'''rocessing) is a combination of [[ROLAP]] (Relational OLAP) and [[MOLAP]] (Multidimensional OLAP) which are other possible implementations of [[OLAP]]. HOLAP allows storing part of the data in a [[MOLAP]] store and another part of the data in a [[ROLAP]] store, allowing a tradeoff of the advantages of each. The degree of control that the cube designer has over this partitioning varies from product to product. == Vertical partitioning == In this mode HOLAP stores ''aggregations'' in [[MOLAP]] for fast query performance, and detailed data in [[ROLAP]] to optimize time of cube ''processing''. == Horizontal partitioning == In this mode HOLAP stores some slice of data, usually the more recent one (i.e. sliced by Time dimension) in [[MOLAP]] for fast query performance, and older data in [[ROLAP]]. Moreover, we can store some dices in [[MOLAP]] and others in [[ROLAP]], leveraging the fact that in a large cuboid, there will be dense and sparse subregions.<ref>Owen Kaser and Daniel Lemire, [http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.DB/0702143 Attribute Value Reordering for Efficient Hybrid OLAP], Information Sciences, Volume 176, Issue 16, pages 2279-2438, 2006.</ref> == Products == Examples of commercial products which support HOLAP storage mode are [[Microsoft Analysis Services]], [[Oracle OLAP|Oracle Database OLAP Option]], [[MicroStrategy]] and [[SAP AG]] BI Accelerator.The hybrid OLAP approach combines ROLAP and MOLAP technology, benefiting from the greater scalability of ROLAP and the faster computation of MOLAP. For example, a HOLAP server may allow large volumes of detail data to be stored in a relational database, while aggregations are kept in a separate MOLAP store.
