The first paper on the subject was written by [[Nikolay Nekhoroshev]] in 1971<ref>{{cite journal| title=Behavior of Hamiltonian systems close to integrable | journal=Functional Analysis and Its Applications | date=1971 | first=Nikolay N. | last=Nekhoroshev | authorlink=Nikolay Nekhoroshev | volume=5 | issue=4 | pages=338&ndash;339 | id= | doi=10.1007/BF01086753}}</ref>. The theorem compliments both the [[KAM theorem]] and the phenomenon of instability for nearly integrable Hamiltonian systems, sometimes called Arnold Diffusion, in the following way: The KAM Theorem tells us that ''many'' solutions to nearly integrable Hamiltonian systems persist under a perturbation for ''all'' time, while, as [[Vladimir Arnold]] first demonstrated in 1964<ref>{{cite journal| title=Instability of dynamical systems with several degrees of freedom | journal=[[Soviet Mathematics]] | date=1964 | first=Vladimir I. | last=Arnold | authorlink=Vladimir Arnold | volume=5 | issue= | pages=581&ndash;585 | id=}}</ref>, some solutions do not stay close to their integrable counterparts for all time. The Nekhoroshev estimates tell us that, nonetheless, ''all'' solutions stay close to their integrable counterparts for an ''exponentially long time''. Thus, they restrict how quickly solutions can become unstable. ==Statement== Let <math> H(I) + \epsilon h(I, \theta) </math> be a nearly integrable Hamiltonian, where <math> (I, \theta) </math> are the [[action-angle variables]]. Ignoring the technical assumptions and details in the statement, Nekhoroshev estimates assert that: : <math> |I(t) - I(0)| < \varepsilon^{1/(2n)} </math> for : <math> |t|< \exp\left({c\left({ 1\over\varepsilon}\right)^{1/(2n)}}\right) </math> where <math> c </math> is a complicated constant.

NeoDatis ODB is available both for [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[.NET Framework|.NET]], the latter being still under development. ==Features== * Support for [[Native Queries]] (see [[#NativeQuery|below]]). * NeoDatis is simple and intuitive. Objects can be easily be added to a database, requiring no boilerplate, nor modification to already existing classes. * ODB Explorer: a graphical tool to browse, query, create, update, and delete object, as well as import/export the database from and to XML files. ==Types of Queries== ===NativeQuery=== To perform a native query, an object implementing a method named <code>match</code> is sent to the database. Such method receives each [[object (programming)|object]] of a determined class from the database, and returns a boolean value determining whether each one should be returned as part of the query result or not. Usage of such queries would be for example<ref>http://www.neodatis.org/5m-tutorial#toc7</ref>: <source lang="java"> IQuery query = new SimpleNativeQuery() { public boolean match(Player player) { return player.getFavoriteSport().getName().toLowerCase().startsWith("volley"); } }; Objects<Player> players = odb.getObjects(query); </source> Native queries have a reduced performance compared to other types of queries, since every object of a certain class in the
