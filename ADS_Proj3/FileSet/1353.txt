According to Fox and Gruninger (1998) from "a design perspective, an enterprise model should provide the language used to explicitly define an enterprise... From an operations perspective, the enterprise model must be able to represent what is planned, what might happen, and what has happened. It must supply the information and knowledge necessary to support the operations of the enterprise, whether they be performed by hand or machine."<ref name="FG98"/> In a two-volume set entitled ''The Managerial Cybernetics of Organization'' Stafford Beer introduced a model of the enterprise, the Viable System Model (VSM). Volume 2, ''The Heart of Enterprise,''<ref name="MCO2">Beer, Stafford. (1979) ''The Heart of Enterprise,'' Wiley.</ref> analyzed the VSM as a recursive organization of five systems: System One (S1) through System Five (S5). Beer's model differs from others in that the VSM is recursive, not hierarchical: "In a recursive organizational structure, any viable system contains, and is contained in, a viable system."<ref name="MCO2"/> === Function modelling === [[Image:IDEF Diagram Example.jpg|thumb|320px|Example of a function model of the process of "Maintain Reparable Spares" in [[IDEF0]] notation.]] [[Function model]]ling in systems engineering is a structured representation of the [[function]]s, activities or [[Process modeling|process]]es within the modelled [[system]] or subject area.<ref name= "ITL93">[http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/idef02.doc FIPS Publication 183] released of IDEFØ December 1993 by the Computer Systems Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).</ref> A function model, also called an [[activity diagram|activity model]] or [[process model]], is a graphical representation of an [[Business|enterprise]]'s function within a defined scope.

A functional perspectives is one or more perspectives possible in process modelling. Other perspectives possible are for example behavioural, organisational or informational.<ref>[http://users.jyu.fi/~jpt/ME2000/Me14/sld004.htm Process perspectives]. In: ''Metamodeling and method engineering'', Minna Koskinen, 2000.</ref> A functional modelling perspective concentrates on describing the [[dynamic system|dynamic process]]. The main concept in this modelling perspective is the process, this could be a function, transformation, activity, action, task etc. A well-known example of a modelling language employing this perspective is [[data flow diagram]]s. The perspective uses four symbols to describe a process, these being: *Process: Illustrates transformation from input to output. *Store: Data-collection or some sort of material. *Flow: Movement of data or material in the process. *External Entity: External to the modelled system, but interacts with it. Now, with these symbols, a process can be represented as a network of these symbols. This decomposed process is a DFD, data flow diagram. In [[Dynamic Enterprise Modeling]], for example, a division is made in the [[Control model]], Function Model, [[Process model]] and [[Organizational model]]. === Data modelling === [[Image:4-3 Data Modelling Today.jpg|240px|thumb|left|The [[data modeling|data modelling]] process.]] [[Data modeling|Data modelling]] is the process of creating a [[data model]] by applying formal data model descriptions using data modelling techniques. Data modelling is a technique for defining business [[requirement]]s for a [[database]]. It is sometimes called ''database modelling'' because a [[data model]] is eventually implemented in a database.<ref name= "WBD04">Whitten, Jeffrey L.; Lonnie D. Bentley, Kevin C. Dittman. (2004).

A [[conceptual data model]] is developed based on the data requirements for the application that is being developed, perhaps in the context of an [[activity diagram|activity model]]. The data model will normally consist of entity types, attributes, relationships, integrity rules, and the definitions of those objects. This is then used as the start point for interface or database design.<ref name="MW99">Matthew West and Julian Fowler (1999).
