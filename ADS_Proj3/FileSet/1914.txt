Similarly, these or other cultures respect individuals or organizations that persevere despite failures resulting not from incompetence but rather from a long series of freak, apparently unrelated setbacks, which in turn are often blamed on an underlying, unobserved or [[Falsifiability|unobservable]] "curse": ** The [[Boston Red Sox]] (1919 to 2003 seasons) ** The [[Chicago Cubs]] ''[[The Book of Heroic Failures]]'' by [[Stephen Pile]] is dedicated to this lighter side of the subject.

It is useful for placing information of interest into a useful [[frequency range]] following [[modulation]] or prior to [[demodulation]]. The two frequencies are mixed in a [[vacuum tube]], [[transistor]], [[diode]], or other signal processing device. Mixing two frequencies creates two new frequencies, according to the [[List_of_trigonometric_identities#Angle_sum_and_difference_identities|properties of the sine function]]; one is the sum of the two frequencies mixed, the other is their difference. These new frequencies are called ''heterodynes''. Typically only one of the new frequencies is desired—the higher one after modulation and the lower one after demodulation. The other signal is [[filter (signal processing)|filtered]] out of the output of the mixer. == History == The word ''heterodyne'' is derived from the Greek roots ''hetero-'' "different", and ''dyn-'' "power" (cf. [[dynamis]]). The original heterodyne technique was pioneered by Canadian inventor-engineer [[Reginald Fessenden]] in 1901, but was not pursued very far because local oscillators were not very stable at the time.<ref name=nahin1>Nahin, Paul. ''The Science of Radio.'' Page 91. Figure 7.10. Chapter 7. ISBN 0-387-95150-4.</ref> Heterodyning was invented by Fessenden as a technique to make the [[Morse code]] radiotelegraph ([[Continuous wave|CW]]) signals used during the [[wireless telegraphy]] era audible.<ref>{{cite book | last = Ashley | first = Charles Grinnell | authorlink = | coauthors = Charles Brian Heyward | title = Wireless Telegraphy and Wireless Telephony | publisher = American School of Correspondence | year = 1912 | location = Chicago | pages = 15–16 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=pK-EAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA15 | doi = | id = | isbn = }}</ref> A "heterodyne" receiver had an [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]] circuit, called a [[local oscillator]], that produced a radio signal that was adjusted to be close in frequency to the signal being received, so that when the two signals were mixed the difference or "beat" frequency was in the audible range. This produced a musical tone in the speaker, so the "dots" and "dashes" of Morse code were audible as beeping sounds. This technique is still used in [[radio telegraphy]]; the oscillator is now called a [[beat frequency oscillator]]. Later, the [[superheterodyne receiver]] (superhet) was invented by [[Edwin Howard Armstrong]] in 1918, converting the incoming [[Radio Frequency]] (RF) to a fixed [[Intermediate Frequency]] (IF), using the heterodyne technique. The difference between the superhet and the original heterodyne is the use of a "sloppy" but tunable RF filter on the front end, a [[Frequency mixer|mixer]] circuit, a stable [[local oscillator]] (LO) and a fixed frequency high-gain [[Band pass filter|band-pass]] [[amplifier]].<ref name=nahin2>Nahin, Paul. ''The Science of Radio.'' Page 285. Chapter 21. ISBN 0-387-95150-4.</ref> The original heterodyne technique tried to accomplish all of this in one stage thus producing an unstable amplifier. == How it works == [[Image:Superhet2.png|center]] In a superheterodyne receiver, the incoming radio signal of interest at frequency ''f<sub>IN</sub>'' is mixed (that is, multiplied) with a second signal ''f<sub>LO</sub>'' produced by an [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]] circuit in the receiver, called the [[local oscillator]] (LO). This mixing produces two new frequencies, at the sum (''f<sub>IN</sub>'' + ''f<sub>LO</sub>'') and difference (''f<sub>IN</sub>'' - ''f<sub>LO</sub>'') of the original frequencies. One of these two new frequencies is discarded, usually the higher one (''f<sub>IN</sub>'' + ''f<sub>LO</sub>''), by [[Electronic filter|filtering]] it out of the mixer output. The remaining difference frequency is called the [[intermediate frequency]] (IF), and it is passed to a high gain amplifier, and signal processing that eventually extracts the desired [[modulation]] carried by the signal. Common choices for the IF frequency are 455 [[Hertz|kHz]] in some [[AM radio]]s and 10.7 MHz in [[FM radio]]s. This process of shifting the RF signal down to a lower IF frequency is called "[[downconverter|down conversion]]". == Mathematical principle == Heterodyning is based on the [[trigonometric identity]]: :<math>\sin \theta \sin \varphi = \frac{1}{2}\cos(\theta - \varphi) - \frac{1}{2}\cos(\theta + \varphi)</math> The product on the left hand side represents the multiplication ("mixing") of a [[sine wave]] with another [[sine wave]]. The right hand side shows that the resulting signal is the difference of two [[sinusoidal]] terms, one at the sum of the two original frequencies, and one at the difference, which can be considered to be separate signals. Using this trigonometric identity, the result of multiplying two sine wave signals, <math>\sin (2 \pi f_1 t)\,</math> and <math>\sin (2 \pi f_2 t)\,</math> can be calculated: :<math>\sin (2 \pi f_1 t)\sin (2 \pi f_2 t) = \frac{1}{2}\cos [2 \pi (f_1 - f_2) t] - \frac{1}{2}\cos [2 \pi (f_1 + f_2) t] \,</math> The result is the sum of two sinusoidal signals, one at the sum ''f<sub>1</sub>'' + ''f<sub>2</sub>'' and one at the difference ''f<sub>1</sub>'' - ''f<sub>2</sub>'' of the original frequencies == Mixer == The two signals are multiplied in a device called a [[Frequency mixer|mixer]]. In order to multiply the signals, the mixer must be a [[nonlinear]] component, that is, its output current or voltage must be a nonlinear function of its input. Most circuit elements in communications circuits are designed to be [[Linear circuit|linear]]. This means
