The bottom image is [[Artistic rendering|rendered]]. Images are produced by capturing or rendering.]] An '''image''' (from [[Latin]] ''imago'') is an artifact, for example a two-dimensional '''picture''', that has a similar appearance to some [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]&mdash;usually a physical object or a [[person]]. ==Characteristics== Images may be two -[[dimension]]al, such as a [[photograph]], screen display, and as well as a three-dimensional, such as a [[statue]] or [[hologram]]. They may be ''captured'' by [[optics|optical]] devices&mdash;such as [[camera]]s, [[mirror]]s, [[Lens (optics)|lenses]], [[telescope]]s, [[microscope]]s, etc. and natural objects and phenomena, such as the human [[eye]] or water surfaces. The word ''image'' is also used in the broader sense of any two-dimensional figure such as a [[map]], a [[Graph (data structure)|graph]], a [[pie chart]], or an [[abstract art|abstract painting]]. In this wider sense, images can also be ''rendered'' manually, such as by [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[Wikt:carving|carving]], rendered automatically by [[printing]] or [[computer graphics]] technology, or [[Image development (visual arts)|developed]] by a combination of methods, especially in a [[pseudo-photograph]]. A volatile image is one that exists only for a short period of time. This may be a reflection of an object by a mirror, a projection of a [[camera obscura]], or a scene displayed on a [[cathode ray tube]]. A fixed image, also called a [[hard copy]], is one that has been recorded on a material object, such as [[paper]] or [[textile]] by [[photography]] or digital processes. A [[mental image]] exists in an individual's mind: something one remembers or imagines. The subject of an image need not be real; it may be an abstract concept, such as a [[graph theory|graph]], function, or "imaginary" entity. For example, [[Sigmund Freud]] claimed to have dreamed purely in aural-images of dialogs. The development of synthetic acoustic technologies and the creation of [[sound art]] have led to a consideration of the possibilities of a sound-image made up of irreducible phonic substance beyond linguistic or musicological analysis. A still image is a single [[wiktionary:static|static]] image, as distinguished from a moving image (see below). This phrase is used in [[photography]], visual [[Electronic media|media]] and the [[computer industry]] to emphasize that one is not talking about movies, or in very precise or pedantic technical writing such as a [[Standardization|standard]]. A [[film still]] is a photograph taken on the set of a movie or television program during production, used for promotional purposes. ==Moving image== A ''moving image'' is typically a movie ([[film]]), or [[video]], including [[digital video]]. It could also be an animated display such as a [[zoetrope]]. ==See also== *[[Imagery]] *[[Painting]] *[[Photograph]] *[[Photography]] *[[Fine art photography]] *[[Digital image]] *[[Digital imaging]] *[[Animation]] *[[Computer animation]] *[[Computer-generated imagery]] *[[Video]] *[[Film]] *[[Cinematography]] ==Reference== {{reflist}} ==External links== {{wiktionary|image}} * [http://www.apple.com/science/insidetheimage/bzreaction/ The B-Z Reaction: The Moving or the Still Image?] * [http://www.csusa.org/face/home.htm FACE: Friends of Active Copyright Education] * [http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/still_fdd.shtml Library of Congress - Format Descriptions for Still Images] [[Category:Photography]] [[Category:Digital photography]] [[Category:Computer graphics]] [[Category:Graphic design]] [[Category:Vision]] {{Link GA|de}} [[ar:صورة]] [[da:Billede]] [[de:Abbild]] [[es:Image]] [[et:Pilt]] [[eo:Bildo]] [[fa:تصویر]] [[fr:Image]] [[ga:Íomhá]] [[hi:प्रतिबिम्ब]] [[io:Imajo]] [[id:Citra]] [[it:Immagine]] [[ka:სურათი]] [[lv:Attēls]] [[hu:Kép]] [[ja:画像]] [[no:Bilde]] [[pt:Imagem]] [[ru:Образ (информация)]] [[simple:Picture]] [[fi:Kuva]] [[ta:படிமம்]] [[te:చిత్రం]] [[tg:Акс]] [[uk:Картина]] [[yi:בילד]] [[zh:图像]]</text> </page> <page> <id>17919</id> <title>Image-guided radiation therapy</title> <text>Highly trained oncologists called [[radiation oncologists]] use image guided radiation therapy, or IGRT, to help better deliver [[radiation therapy]] to cancerous tumors. This is very useful since tumors can move between treatments due to differences in organ filling or movements while breathing. IGRT involves conformal radiation treatment guided by specialized imaging tests, such as CT scans, ultrasound or X-rays. These tests are done in the treatment room just before the patient is to receive his or her daily radiation therapy treatment.<ref>http://www.rtanswers.com/treatmentinformation/treatmenttypes/externalbeamradiation.aspx</ref> '''Image-guided radiation therapy''' (IGRT) is the process of frequent two and three-dimensional imaging, during a course of radiation treatment, used to direct radiation therapy utilizing the imaging coordinates of the actual radiation treatment plan.<ref>[http://www.advancedradiationcenters.com/?p=igrtvs IGRT, or Image Guided Radiation Therapy, is a sophisticated method of radiation treatment]</ref> The patient is localized in the treatment room in the same position as planned from the reference imaging dataset. An example of [[Three-dimensional space|Three-dimensional]] (3D) IGRT would include localization of a [[Cone beam reconstruction|cone-beam]] [[computed tomography]] (CBCT) dataset with the planning [[computed tomography]] (CT) dataset from planning. Similarly [[2-d|Two-dimensional]] (2D) IGRT would include matching planar kilovoltage (kV) radiographs [[fluoroscopy]] or megavoltage (MV) images with digital reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) from the planning CT. This process is distinct from the use of imaging to delineate targets and organs in the planning process of radiation therapy. However, there is clearly a connection between the imaging processes as IGRT relies directly on the imaging modalities from planning as the reference coordinates for localizing the patient. The variety of image gathering hardware used in planning includes [[Computed Tomography]](CT), [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI), and [[Positron Emission Tomography]] (PET) among others. Through advancements in imaging technology, combined with a further understanding of human biology at the molecular level, the impact of IGRT on radiotherapy treatment continues to evolve. == Goals and Clinical Benefits == The goal of the IGRT process is to improve the accuracy of the radiation field placement, and to reduce the exposure of healthy tissue during radiation treatments. In years past, larger planning target volume (PTV) margins were used to compensate for localization errors during treatment. (Jaffray et al. 1999) This resulted in healthy human tissues receiving unnecessary doses of radiation during treatment. PTV margins are the most widely used method to correct geometric uncertainties. By improving precision and accuracy through IGRT, radiation is decreased to surrounding healthy tissues, allowing for increased radiation to the tumour for control. (Jaffray et al. 1999) Currently, certain radiation therapy techniques employ the process of [[IMRT|Intensity Modulation Radiotherapy.
