that converts images into ASCII characters. Cosic then incorporates the use of films and television programs to convert these images into animation with a retro-futuristic aesthetic. <ref name=Tribe2007p38/>. ==History== [[Vera Molnar]] a pioneer in computer art used geometric and mathematical abstraction to aid her artistic expression. In 1968 she began working with a computer to create images with the aid of a computer and terminals like a plotter and a cathode-ray tube screen. Early works of computer art include ''(Des)orders'' (1969). [[Manfred Mohr]] influenced by German philosopher [[Max Bense]] and French composer [[Pierre Barbaud]], created [[hypercube]]s founded on a [[Constructivism (art)|constructivist]], algorithmic aesthetic. In 1969 he used a computer to superimpose multiple rules and found that this was the only way possible to superimpose multiple rules without losing track of the general concept. This strategy made the information become deeply buried and a certain participation is demanded from the viewer. Each work is based in a subset of a defined structure, ranging from cubes to 6-dimensional hypercubes. <ref>(Popper2007, p.68)</ref> ==Footnotes== {{Reflist}} ==References== *<cite id=Tribe2007>[[Mark Tribe|Tribe, Mark]].

On April 21, 2003 the first front page icon for a user-submitted Flash game was posted under the heading "Tom and Wade Recommend." The game that was posted was [http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/15795 Taipan 3000] by Josh "Psycho Goldfish" Tuttle, a remake of a popular [[Apple II]] game called ''[[Taipan!]]''. As Newgrounds received more quality submissions the "Tom and Wade Recommend" section grew from 1 to 2, 2 to 4, and 4 to 6 icons.
