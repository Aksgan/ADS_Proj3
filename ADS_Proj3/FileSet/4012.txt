is already well known, or if they do not want to be listed in direct competition with other products on shareware repositories.<ref>Gaudeul A. (2008). [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1140674 Software Marketing on the Internet: The Use of Samples and Repositories], SSRN Working Paper</ref> Shareware is usually offered either with certain [[feature (software design)|features]] only available after the license is purchased, or as a full version but for a limited trial period of time. Once the trial period has passed the program may stop running until a license is purchased. Shareware is often offered without supports or updates which only become available with the purchase of a license. The words "free trial" or "trial version" are indicative of shareware. The term shareware is used in contrast to ''[[retail software]]'', which refers to commercial software available only with the purchase of a license which may not be copied for others, ''[[public domain software]]'', which refers to software not [[copyright]] protected, and ''[[freeware]]'', which refers to copyrighted software for which the author solicits no payment (though he or she may request donations). ==History== In 1982, [[Andrew Fluegelman]] created a program for the IBM PC called [[PC-Talk]], a [[modem|telecommunications]] program, he used the term ''freeware''. About the same time, [[Jim Knopf|Jim "Button" Knopf]] released [[PC-File]], a [[database]] program, calling it ''user-supported software''.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://paulspicks.com/history.asp |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080202033436/http://www.paulspicks.com/history.asp |archivedate = 2008-02-02 | title = The History of Shareware | date = | last = Callahan | first = Michael E. | publisher = Paul's Picks | accessdate = 2008-05-13 }}</ref> Not much later, Bob Wallace produced [[PC-Write]], a word processor, and called it ''shareware''. Appearing in an episode of ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' titled ''Psychedelic Science'' originally broadcast 5 April 1998, Bob Wallace said the idea for shareware came to him "to some extent as a result of my psychedelic experience."<ref>[http://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=6540905926032767614 Horizon: Psychedelic science by Bill Eagles, video.google.ca (about 41 mins into video)]</ref> In 1984, ''Softalk-PC'' magazine had a column, ''The Public Library'', about such software. ''Public domain'' is a misnomer for shareware, and ''Freeware'' was trademarked by Fluegelman and could not be used legally by others, and ''User-Supported Software'' was too cumbersome. So columnist [[Nelson Ford]] had a contest to come up with a better name. The most popular name submitted was ''Shareware'', which was being used by Wallace. However, Wallace acknowledged that he got the term from an [[InfoWorld]] magazine column by that name in the 1970s, and that he considered the name to be generic,{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} so its use became established over ''freeware'' and ''user-supported software''.<ref>[http://www.asp-shareware.org/users/history-of-shareware.asp "History of Shareware". Association of Shareware Professionals]</ref> Fluegelman, Knopf, and Wallace clearly established shareware as a viable software marketing method. Via the shareware model, Button, Fluegelman and Wallace became millionaires.<ref>[http://www.erowid.org/culture/characters/wallace_bob/wallace_bob_timeline1.shtml Bob Wallace Timeline]</ref><ref>[http://www.ddj.com/184403976?pgno=2 Article about Jim "Button" Knopf], from Dr. Dobbs Journal</ref> During the late 1980s and early 1990s, shareware software was widely distributed over [[bulletin board system]]s globally and on diskettes (and subsequently, CD-ROMs) by commercial shareware distributors who produced catalogs of up to thousands of public domain and shareware programs. One such distributor, ''Public Software Library'' (PSL), began an order-taking service for programmers who otherwise had no means of accepting credit card orders. As Internet usage grew, users turned to downloading shareware programs without paying long-distance charges or disk fees, spelling the end of [[bulletin board systems]] and shareware disk distributors. In addition to shareware libraries online, the authors of programs had their own sites where the public could learn about their programs and download the latest versions, and even pay for the software online. The Internet also made it easier to locate niche software, as well as the best and most popular general software. During the early 2000s, and with the increasing popularity of [[Web 2.0]], new ways to filter the software became available. Major download sites began to rank titles based on quality, feedback, and downloads. Popular software was sorted to the top of the list. [[Blog]]s and online forums further enabled individuals to spread news about titles they like. With this pruning in place, consumers can more easily find quality shareware products while still preserving the ability to find obscure and niche software. ==Implementations== [[Free software|Free]]/[[open source]] software and shareware are similar in that they can be obtained and used without monetary cost. Usually shareware differs from free/open source software in that requests of voluntary shareware fees are made, often within the program itself, and in that [[source code]] for shareware programs is generally not available in a form that would allow others to extend the program. Notwithstanding that tradition, some free/open source software authors ask for voluntary donations, although there is no requirement to do so. Free/open source software is usually compatible with the strict [[Association of Shareware Professionals]] shareware guidelines. Sometimes, paying the fee and obtaining a password results in access to expanded features, documentation, or support. In some cases, unpaid use of the software is limited in time or in features &mdash; in which case the software is vernacularly called [[crippleware]]. Some shareware items require no payment; just an email address, so that the supplier can use this address for their own purposes. Shareware is available on all major computer platforms including [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Macintosh]], [[Linux]], and [[Unix]]. Titles cover a very wide range of categories including: business, software development, education, home, multimedia, design, drivers, games, and utilities. ==Logistics== With shareware, a developer bypasses the normal distribution channel eliminating the normal retail middleman markups and directly markets to the end user. The end result is a reduced end-user price compared to the retail channel. Users of shareware are encouraged to copy and distribute unregistered versions of the software to friends, coworkers and other acquaintances. The hope is that users will find the program useful or entertaining and will pay to register to be able to access all the features. In the early to mid-1990s, large online distribution channels known as "portals", such as [[Download.com]], [[Tucows]], [[Yahoo!]] Games and RealArcade emerged. These portals acted as media of distribution for the
