deeper and more qualitative description of the underlying biological, pathological and pharmacological processes can lead to a more rational drug development process and an improved treatment of diseases such as cancer diabetes and depression. At the same time, the biosimulation offers the possibility of reduction in the use of animal experiments. {| class="wikitable" |- | Host Organization: Technical University of Denmark |- | Coordinator: Erik Mosekilde, Professor |- | Project Management: Anne Marie Clemensen/ Naomi Dayan |- | Address: Fysikvey 309, DTU 2800 Lyngby, Denmark |- | E-mail: erik.mosekilde@fysik.dtu.dk |- |} == Introduction == <!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:BioSim logo.png|thumb]] --> With its 26 academic partners, 9 small and medium sized enterprises, 1 large pharmaceutical company, and the regulatory agencies in Denmark, Sweden, Spain and the Netherlands, BioSim commands a broad range of expertises including genetics, biochemistry, cell biology, physiology, pharmacology on the biological side as well as pharmacokinetics, bioinformatics, complex systems theory, and software development on the technical side. Several of the leading groups have worked in the areas of 'biosimulation' and 'computational systems biology' for more than 30 years, and the Network also includes hospital departments that perform experimental treatment of patients with cancer and Parkinson's disease. The BioSim Network aims at demonstrating how the use of advanced mathematical modelling and computer simulation can contribute to the development of effective and personalized treatments of different chronic progressive disorders and how the same approach can lead to a reduction of the costs and lead times associated with the development of new medicines. This may gradually allow us to reduce the need for animal experiments. '''1. Diabetes''' Efforts in this area concentrate on the role of mutations that effect the ion channels of the insulin producing beta-cells, on the genetic basis for the development of neonatal diabetes, on the study of human (as opposed to mice) pancreatic cells, on the mechanisms underlying the development of insulin resistance, and on the possible role of prenatal nutrition for the development of type-2 diabetes. Models are also developed to analyse the balance between fat and glucose metabolism and to describe the rate of absorption of different insulin variants. '''2. Cancer''' In this area the Network uses detailed computer models of the cell cycle and of its coupling to the 24 h day-and-night rhythm to improve the treatment of patients with cancer. The use of chronotherapy implies that the administration of anti-cancer drugs is adjusted in accordance with the circadian rhythm of the individual patient. For certain forms of cancer this has been found to increase the efficiency of the drug by a factor of 5. Efforts are also devoted to the development of new anti-cancer drugs. '''3. Hypertension and cardiovascular diseases''' The activities in this area focus on the development of 3D heart models that can be used to test how a new drug affects the regularity of the heart rhythm. Work is also performed to develop detailed models of the mechanisms by which the individual nephron of the kidney regulates the incoming blood flow and how neighboring nephrons interact. '''4. Mental disorders and neuronal systems''' Work in this area includes application of mathematical models to develop less invasive and demand-controlled electrical stimulation techniques for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Modelling studies are also performed to examine the effect of sleep deprivation in the treatment of depression, and bioinformatic approaches are applied to try to identify different forms of depression on the basis of the information available from blood samples. '''5. Methodological issues''' This area encompasses description of complex networks of oscillating biological units, studies of the mechanisms of temperature stabilization in biological feedback regulations, application of new methods of data analysis, and development of modeling software and biomedical search machines. The area also includes application of new experimental techniques such as interference microscopy and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy to study cellular processes. '''6. Regulatory issues and dialogue with the public''' Testing in animal and human subjects is a necessary part of the development of new drugs. Such experiments clearly raises a number of complicated ethical issues that the use of simulation models may reduce. This requires that the regulatory authorities can evaluate computer models and accept them as part of the required documentation. At the same time it is important that the public receives information both about the potential of biosimulation and about the enormous challenges the field has to overcome to realize this potential. During the last 5 years the BioSim Network has published 9 books and of the order of 800 scientific publications. The Network has organized or co-organized close to 30 conferences and workshops, edited 4 special issues of international journals, and trained about 130 PhD students. New National Centres in Systems Biology have been established in relation to the BioSim partners in Manchester, Warwick, and Edinburgh. == Conclusion == The BioSim Network has now reached the end of its 4th year, and the issue of sustainability, i.e. the possibility of continuing our activities, naturally comes to the forefront. All BioSim partners have expressed a clear and unconditional wish to continue the collaboration. Together with representatives from other networks of excellence in the Health area BioSim has participated in a meeting on ‘The Sustainability of Networks’ with representatives from [[European Union|the EU]] Research Directorate in Brussels. It appears that many national representatives have provided feedback to the Research Directorate that focuses on the administrative difficulties of running such a large research collaboration. On the other hand, the broad range of different specialities required to establish the new field of systems biology and demonstrate its results must involve contributions from many different partners. During a workshop in Malmö and Governing Board and Steering Group meetings in Oxford and The Hague, our discussions have focused primarily on projects offered by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI). We have, unfortunately concluded, however, that this initiative does not allow for such broad and generic research in the development of predictive and mechanism-based models and, in particular, it does not include research projects that would
