The toyline consisted primarily of recolored robots and vehicles from [[Starriors]], an American toyline also created by Tomy, but also featured additional vehicles not seen in the Starriors line. The primary gimmick of each toy was some example of [[wind-up]] automation, such as a rotating weapon or tool, or an [[electronics|electronic]] automation, such as firing discs or [[locomotion]]. The only backstory for the toys was that which was provided on the packaging itself (in [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]): <blockquote>From the depths of space came the enemy battle squadron...hostile hordes of alien robots. Earth was the prize they fought for and Earth was their battleground. But they were not prepared for Earth's last line of defence... An army created to crush and destroy any invader. They're the ultimate weapon — the last line of defence of Planet Earth. '''They're fierce. They're mean. They'll take on anybody ...anything! They're R.A.T.S.! The Robot Anti-Terror Squad.'''</blockquote> ==The Toys== [[Image:RATS cast.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Scan of promotional image of the R.A.T.S. line from the back of a box]] R.A.T.S. toys were manufactured primarily in [[Thailand]] and [[Singapore]], though some were later produced in [[France]]. While only one wave of toys was publicized via the back of each toy's box or card, at least two releases exist that were not depicted in the initial wave, both of which were recolored Starriors toys. Due to the later manufacturer's reference numbers on their packaging, they may have been part of an unpublicized second (or supplementary) wave. There is at least one more possible release, a blue [[redeco]] of another Starriors figure, '''Bolar'''. This figure was pictured on the box of the rarely-seen Combat Command Centre (along with both Squad Reinforcement Personnel figures), but a physical sample has yet to surface. {| class="wikitable" |- !

This series was also produced by Tomy, but so far little is known about its countries of [[manufacture]] or [[Distribution (business)|distribution]]. Two toys are so far confirmed to have been released: a redeco of the first R.A.T.S. '''Grapplor''', and '''Badfoot''', a battery-powered, [[bipedal]] walking robot. ==External links== *[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuexrzhpNuk R.A.T.S.

It is designed to honor both achievements in [[robotics]] technology and robots from [[science fiction]] that have served as creative inspiration in robotics. The first induction ceremony was held at the [[Carnegie Science Center]] in Pittsburgh on November 10, 2003. The Robot Hall of Fame will become a physical presence within the RoboWorld exhibit at the [[Carnegie Science Center]]. Hailed as the largest permanent robotics exhibit in the United States, Roboworld will allow guests to interact and learn about robots through different themed areas. The Hall of Fame will feature interactive exhibits currently being developed by graduate students at [[Carnegie Mellon]]'s [[Entertainment Technology Center]]. ==List of inductees== ===2003=== *Fictional ** [[HAL 9000]] - computer system from ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' ** [[R2-D2]] - robot from ''[[Star Wars]]'' *Real ** [[Sojourner (rover)|''Sojourner'']] - the rover that explored [[Mars]] in [[1997]] as part of the [[Mars Pathfinder]] mission. ** [[Unimate]] - the first industrial robot, which worked on a [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] assembly line in 1961 ===2004=== *Fictional ** [[Astro Boy (1960s)|Astro Boy]] - robot from ''Astro Boy'' ** [[C-3PO]] - robot from ''[[Star Wars]]'' ** [[Robby the Robot]] - robot from ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'' *Real ** [[ASIMO]] - a humanoid robot created by [[Honda]] ** [[Shakey the Robot]] - the first mobile robot to be able to reason its own actions ===2006=== *Fictional ** [[Maschinenmensch|''Maria'']] - robot from ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''. ** [[Gort (The Day the Earth Stood Still)|Gort]] - robot from ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951 film)|The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' ** David - android-kid from ''[[A.I.: Artificial Intelligence]] (2001)'' *Real ** [[AIBO]], [[Sony]]’s cyber-dog ** [[SCARA|Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm]] ([[SCARA]]) ===2007-2008<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.cmu.edu/news/archive/2007/May/may15_rhof.shtml | title = Carnegie Mellon Adds Four More 'Bots to Robot Hall of Fame | publisher = CMU}}</ref>=== *Fictional ** [[Data (Star Trek)|Lieutenant Commander Data]],
