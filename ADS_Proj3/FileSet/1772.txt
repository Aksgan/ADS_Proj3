The settlement has to be approved by the court, which could occur some time after October 2009.<ref name=LAWSUITS/> Reaction to the settlement has been mixed, with Harvard Library, one of the original contributing libraries to Google Library, choosing to withdraw its partnership with Google if "more reasonable terms" cannot be found.<ref>{{cite web |title=Google Online Book Deal at Risk |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=524989}}</ref> As part of the $125 million settlement signed in October 2008, Google created a Google Book Settlement web site that went active on February 11, 2009. This site allows authors and other rights holders of out-of-print (but copyright) books to submit a claim by June 5, 2010.<ref name=schonfeld>[http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/02/11/google-book-settlement-site-is-up-paying-authors-60-per-scanned-book/ "Google Book Settlement Site Is Up; Paying Authors $60 Per Scanned Book"], by Erick Schonfeld on February 11, 2009, at [[TechCrunch]]</ref> In return they will receive $60 per full book, or $5 to $15 for partial works.<ref name=schonfeld/> In return, Google will be able to index the books and display snippets in search results, as well as up to 20% of each book in preview mode.<ref name=schonfeld/> Google will also be able to show ads on these pages and make available for sale digital versions of each book.<ref name=schonfeld/> Authors and copyright holders will receive 63 percent of all advertising and e-commerce revenues associated with their works.<ref name=schonfeld/> In the US, several organizations who took no part of the settlement, like the [[American Society of Journalists and Authors]], criticized the settlement fundamentally.<ref>[http://www.asja.org/google/ American Society of Journalists and Authors]</ref> Moreover, the New York book settlement is not restricted to US authors, but relevant to authors of the whole world. This led to objections even on the level of some European governments and critical voices in many European newspapers.<ref>[http://www.faz.net/s/RubBE163169B4324E24BA92AAEB5BDEF0DA/Doc~E74446D08BF584F8D8725EB2BD5BDF90B~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html Es wird Zeit, dass die Bundesregierung eingreift]</ref> In October 2009, Google countered ongoing critics by stating that its scanning of books and putting them online would protect the world's cultural heritage; Google co-founder [[Sergey Brin]] stated, "The famous [[Library of Alexandria]] burned three times, in 48 BC, AD 273 and AD 640, as did the [[Library of Congress]], where a fire in 1851 destroyed two-thirds of the collection. I hope such destruction never happens again, but history would suggest otherwise."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8298674.stm BBC: Google hits back at book critics]</ref> This characterization was rebuked by Pam Samuelson, UC Berkeley Professor of Law<ref>[http://www.openbookalliance.org/2009/10/pam-samuelson-on-google-books-its-not-a-library/ Openbookalliance.org]</ref> saying "Libraries everywhere are terrified that Google will engage in price-gouging when setting prices for institutional subscriptions to GBS contents ... Brin forgot to mention another significant difference between GBS and traditional libraries: their policies on patron privacy. ... Google has been unwilling to make meaningful commitments to protect user privacy. Traditional libraries, by contrast, have been important guardians of patron privacy."<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/pamela-samuelson/google-books-is-not-a-lib_b_317518.html Google Books Is Not a Library]</ref> Others have denounced the settlement for neglecting to protect reader privacy. <ref>{{cite web|title=The Case for Book Privacy Parity: Google Books and the Shift from Offline to Online Reading |url=http://hlpronline.com/2010/05/the-case-for-book-privacy-parity-google-books-and-the-shift-from-offline-to-online-reading/ |publisher=Harvard Law and Policy Review|accessdate=September 8, 2010|date=May 16, 2010}}</ref> ==Language issues== Some European politicians and intellectuals have criticized Google's effort on "language-imperialism" grounds, arguing that because the vast majority of books proposed to be scanned are in English, it will result in disproportionate representation of natural languages in the digital world. German, Russian, and French, for instance, are popular languages in scholarship; the disproportionate online emphasis on English could shape access to historical scholarship, and, ultimately, the growth and direction of future scholarship.
