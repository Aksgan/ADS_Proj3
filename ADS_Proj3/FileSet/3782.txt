to direct the traffic, which can use either ringlet of the ring. The nodes also negotiate for bandwidth among themselves using fairness algorithms, avoiding congestion and failed spans. The avoidance of failed spans is accomplished by using one of two techniques known as ''steering'' and ''wrapping''. Under steering, if a node or span is broken, all nodes are notified of a topology change and they reroute their traffic. In wrapping, the traffic is looped back at the last node prior to the break and routed to the destination station. All traffic on the ring is assigned a [[Class of Service]] (CoS) and the standard specifies three classes. Class A (or High) traffic is a pure committed information rate (CIR) and is designed to support applications requiring low latency and jitter, such as voice and video. Class B (or Medium) traffic is a mix of both a CIR and an excess information rate (EIR; which is subject to fairness queuing). Class C (or Low) is best effort traffic, utilizing whatever bandwidth is available. This is primarily used to support Internet access traffic. Another concept within RPR is what is known as ''spatial reuse''. Because RPR strips the signal once it reaches the destination (unlike a SONET UPSR/SDH [[SNCP]] ring, in which the bandwidth is consumed around the entire ring) it can reuse the freed space to carry additional traffic. The RPR standard also supports the use of learning bridges ([[IEEE 802.1D]]) to further enhance efficiency in point to multipoint applications and VLAN tagging ([[IEEE 802.1Q]]). One drawback of the first version of RPR was that it didn't provide spatial reuse for frame transmission to/from MAC addresses not present in the ring topology. This was addressed by [[IEEE]] [[802.17b]], which defines an optional ''spatially aware sublayer'' (''SAS''). This allows spatial reuse for frame transmission to/from MAC address not present in the ring topology. == See also == * [[Spatial Reuse Protocol]] ([[Cisco]]) * [[Metro Ring Protocol]] ([[Foundry]]) * [[Open Transport Network]] ([[Nokia Siemens Networks]]) * [[Dynamic Packet Transport]] ([[Cisco]]) * [[ERPS|Ethernet Ring Protection Switching]] ([[ITU-T]]) == External links == * [http://www.ieee802.org/17/ IEEE 802.17 Resilient Packet Ring Working Group] [[Category:IEEE 802]] [[Category:Network architecture]] [[Category:IEEE standards]] [[de:Resilient Packet Ring]]</text> </page> <page> <id>31911</id> <title>Resistance Database Initiative</title> <text>{{New unreviewed article|source=ArticleWizard|date=October 2010}} '''HIV Resistance Response Database Initiative (RDI)''' is a [[not-for-profit]] organisation established in 2002 with the mission of improving the clinical management of [[HIV]] infection through the application of [[bioinformatics]] to HIV [[drug resistance]] and treatment outcome data. The RDI has the following specific goals: # To be an independent repository of HIV resistance and treatment outcome data # To use bioinformatics to explore the relationships between resistance, other clinical and laboratory factors and HIV treatment outcome # To develop and make freely available a system to predict treatment response, as an aid to optimising and individualising the clinical management of HIV infection The RDI consists of a small executive group based n the UK, an international advisory group of leading [[HIV/AIDS]] scientists and clinicians, and an extensive global network of collaborators and data contributors. ==Background== [[Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)]] is the [[virus]] that causes [[acquired immunodeficiency syndrome]] ([[AIDS]]), a condition in which the immune system begins to fail, leading to life-threatening [[opportunistic infections]]. There are approximately 25 HIV ‘[[antiretroviral]]’ drugs that have been approved for the treatment of HIV infection. They are used in combination; typically 3 or more drugs from 2 or more different classes, a form of therapy known as highly active antiretroviral therapy or [[HAART]]. The aim of therapy is suppression of the virus to very low, ideally undetectable, levels in the blood this prevents the virus from depleting the [[immune cells]] that it preferentially attacks ([[CD4]] cells) and prevents or delays illness and death. Despite the availability of these drugs and the impact of their use, treatments continue to fail, often due to the development of resistance. During drug therapy, low-level virus replication still occurs, particularly when a patient misses a dose. HIV makes errors in copying its genetic material and, if a [[mutation]] makes the virus resistant to one or more of the drugs, it may begin to replicate more successfully in the presence of that drug and undermine the effect of the treatment. If this happens then the treatment needs to be changed to re-establish control over the virus. In well-resourced healthcare settings, when treatment fails a resistance test may be run to predict to which drugs the patient’s virus is resistant. The type of test in most common use is the [[genotype]] test, which detects mutations in the viral [[genetic code]]. This information is then typically interpreted using rules equating individual mutations with resistance against individual drugs. However, there are many different interpretation systems available that do not always agree, the systems only provide categorical results (resistant, sensitive or intermediate) and they do not necessarily relate well to how a patient will respond to a combination of drugs in the clinic. ==RDI Overview== The RDI was established in 2002 to pioneer a new approach: to develop [[computational models]] using the genotype and a wide range of other clinically relevant data collected from thousands of patients treated with HAART all over the world and to use these models to predict how an individual patient will respond to different combinations of drugs. The RDI’s goal was to make available a free treatment-response prediction tool over the Internet. Key to the success of this approach is the collection of large amounts of data with which to train the models and the use of data from as wide and heterogeneous range of sources as possible to maximise the generalisability of the models’ predictions. In order to achieve this, the RDI set out to involve as many clinics worldwide as possible and to be the single repository for the data required, in an attempt to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort and competition. As of October 2010, the RDI has collected data from approximately 70,000 patients from dozens of clinics in more than 15
