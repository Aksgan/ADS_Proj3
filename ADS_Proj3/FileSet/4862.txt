Sci-Fi director [[David Winning]] has won twenty-two Gold/Platinum Remi Awards from 1994 to present, making him the winningest filmaker in the history of Worldfest. ==Remi Awards== The Remi Award is inspired by the creative genius of the great western artist [[Frederic Remington]], famous for his paintings and sculptures of cowboy life in Texas and The West. His vision brilliantly captured the true independent spirit of Texas and The West. The Grand Remi Statuette is presented for the top award in each major category. The Special Jury Awards are Grand Remi Nominees, they are the highest awards for creative excellence in each major category. Then the Platinum, Gold, Silver and Bronze Remi Awards are 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th place in each sub-category. The Museum of Fine Arts-Houston* has one of the largest and most important collections of paintings and sculptures by Frederick Remington in the world. There are ten major competition categories that can win the Remi Award; Shorts, Features, TV Productions, Student Productions, TV Commercials, Experimental, New Media (including Interactive and Websites), Music Videos, Unproduced Screenplays and Film & Video Production (which includes Documentaries of various genres). WorldFest receives a total of more than 4,500 category entries in all ten categories and only about 15% of the entries go on to win the Remi Award. ==References== {{Reflist|1}} *[http://www.mfah.org] ==External links== *[http://www.worldfest.org WorldFest Official Website] {{DEFAULTSORT:Worldfest-Houston International Film Festival}} [[Category:Film festivals in the United States]] [[Category:Culture of Houston, Texas]] [[Category:Festivals in Texas]] [[Category:International film festivals]] [[Category:Recurring events established in 1961]] [[Category:American film awards]] [[Category:American literary awards]] [[Category:American television awards]] [[Category:Art awards]] [[Category:Arts awards]] [[Category:Awards established in 1961]] [[Category:Computer-related awards]] [[Category:American music awards]] [[ja:ヒューストン国際映画祭]] [[tr:WorldFest-Houston Uluslararası Film Festivali]]</text> </page> <page> <id>40512</id> <title>World Intellectual Property Organization</title> <text>{{Infobox United Nations | name = World Intellectual Property Organization | image = WIPO3.JPG | caption = Headquarters in [[Geneva]] | type = Specialized Agency | acronyms = WIPO | head = ''Director-General of WIPO''<br /> : [[Francis Gurry]] : {{AUS}} | status = Active | established = 1967 | website = [http://www.wipo.int/ www.wipo.int] | parent = | subsidiaries = | footnotes = }}[[File:WIPO.png|thumb|280px|WIPO members{{legend|#ff6000|Members}} {{legend|lightgray|Non-members}}]] The '''World Intellectual Property Organization''' ('''WIPO''') is one of the 16 specialized agencies of the [[United Nations]].

WIPO was formally created by the [[Convention Establishing the World Intellectual Property Organization]], which entered into force on April 26, 1970. Under Article 3 of this Convention, WIPO seeks to "promote the protection of intellectual property throughout the world." WIPO became a specialized agency of the UN in 1974. The Agreement between the United Nations and the World Intellectual Property Organization <ref>[http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/agreement/index.html Agreement between the United Nations and the World Intellectual Property Organization]</ref> notes in Article 2 that WIPO is responsible :"for promoting creative intellectual activity and for facilitating the transfer of technology related to industrial property to the developing countries in order to accelerate economic, social and cultural development, subject to the competence and responsibilities of the United Nations and its organs, particularly the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, as well as of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and of other agencies within the United Nations system." The Agreement marked a transition for WIPO from the mandate it inherited in 1967 from BIRPI, to promote the protection of intellectual property, to one that involved the more complex task of promoting technology transfer and economic development.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Unlike other branches of the United Nations, WIPO has significant financial resources independent of the contributions from its Member States.
