as the [[Broadway (microprocessor)|"Broadway"]] processor. Very few official details have been released to the public by Nintendo, AMD, or [[IBM]]. The Hollywood GPU is reportedly based on the Nintendo GameCube's "Flipper" GPU and is clocked 50% higher at 243 MHz,<ref name="IGNTech">{{cite web|title=IGN: Revolution's Horsepower|date=2006-03-29|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2006-12-23|url= http://wii.ign.com/articles/699/699118p1.html}}</ref> though none of the [[clock rate]]s have been confirmed by Nintendo, IBM, or AMD. The Hollywood is a [[multi-chip module]] (MCM) package containing two dies under the cover. One of the two chips, codenamed ''Napa'', controls the I/O functions, RAM access, and the actual GPU with its embedded DRAM, and measures 8 × 9 mm. The other, codenamed ''Vegas'', holds the Audio [[Digital signal processor|DSP]] and the 24 MB of "internal" [[1T-SRAM]] and measures 13.5 × 7 mm.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The Hollywood also contains an [[ARM architecture|ARM926]] core, which has been unofficially nicknamed the ''Starlet''.<ref name="Wiibrew">{{cite web|title=Starlet|url=http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Starlet|work=Wiibrew|accessdate=2008-02-20}}</ref> This embedded microprocessor performs many of the I/O functions, including controlling the wireless functionality, USB, the disc drive, and other miscellaneous functions. It also acts as the security controller of the system, performing encryption and authentication functions. The Hollywood includes hardware implementations of [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] and [[SHA-1]], to speed up these functions. Communication with the main CPU is accomplished via an [[Inter-process communication|IPC]] mechanism. The Starlet performs the [[WiiConnect24]] functions while the Wii console is in standby mode.<ref name="Wiibrew"/> ==References== {{Reflist}} {{Nintendo hardware|Wii}} {{ATI}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Hollywood (Graphics Chip)}} [[Category:Nintendo hardware]] [[Category:ATI Technologies products]] [[Category:Graphics hardware]] {{videogame-hardware-stub}} [[ar:هوليوود (معالج رسومات)]] [[it:ATI Hollywood]] [[pt:Hollywood (GPU)]] [[sv:Hollywood (GPU)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>16865</id> <title>Hollywood Stock Exchange</title> <text>{{Refimprove|date=July 2008}} The '''Hollywood Stock Exchange''', or '''HSX''', is a web-based, multiplayer [[game]] in which players use simulated [[money]] to buy and sell "shares" of [[actor]]s, [[film director|directors]], upcoming [[films]], and film-related options.<ref name="businessweek">{{cite web | author=Rachael King | title=Hollywood Games People Play | work=businessweek.com | url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/aug2006/tc20060804_618481.htm?chan=top+news_top+news | date=2006-08-07 | accessdate=2009-03-22}}</ref> The technology that drives the Hollywood Stock Exchange is the Virtual Specialist technology invented by HSX co-founders and the exchange's creators [[Max Keiser]] and Michael Burns, who were awarded a {{US patent|5950176|U.S. patent no. 5960176}} in 1999 for the invention. Claims of this patent cover trading applications for trading virtual securities using virtual currencies over a network. Because trading directly affects the prices of the securities &mdash; purchasing enough shares of a stock causes its price to rise, and selling causes its price to fall &mdash; and because the ultimate value of a moviestock is based on the film's box office, stock prices act as [[box office]] predictions. For example, if a particular moviestock trades at "H$40.00", the market is predicting that the movie will gross US$40 million at the box office in the first four weekends of wide release. In 2007, players in the Hollywood Stock Exchange correctly predicted 32 of the 39 major-category [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominees and 7 out of 8 top-category winners. The Hollywood Stock Exchange is considered a good example of a [[prediction market]]. Previous incarnations of the game included a [[music]] market (for purchasing musical artists), prizes for top gainers, and, briefly, a "buyout" program in which HSX would reward top players by purchasing their portfolios at a price of US$1.00 per HS1 million if the player would list the portfolio for sale on [[eBay]]. These features have been discontinued. The practice of selling portfolios on eBay was inaugurated by Curtis Edmonds, a former Texan lawyer who was the first to sell his HSX portfolio on eBay.<ref>{{cite web | last = The New York Times | title = Virtual Stocks Lure Real Money | url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/02/circuits/articles/25ebay.html | date = February 1999 | accessdate = 2009-03-22}}</ref> HSX attracted some private investment during the [[dot-com boom]] and ran TV ads on cable channels in an effort to attract players. After the dot-com crash, HSX was eventually acquired by units of [[Cantor Fitzgerald]]. Cantor has used HSX's moviestock prices to assist Cantor's [[gambling]] operations in the United Kingdom, in which bettors can place bets on how much money US films will gross. HSX is headquartered in [[Century City]], [[California]]. ==StarBonds== StarBonds represent the "trailing average gross" of an actor or director's last five movies. As with the MovieStocks, trading directly affects the value of these bonds, until they adjust after a new release. StarBonds can be volatile, as an actor or director may star in 5 blockbuster movies, only to then star in a small independent film, causing their StarBond to fall rapidly. ==Options & Derivatives== A movie option is either be a "Call" or a "Put." A call is claiming that the movie will make more than a certain amount for its opening week, and a put is claiming that it will make less than that amount. For example, suppose there is a $10M call and put for the opening weekend total of a movie called ''Rosebud''. If ''Rosebud'' makes $20 million in its opening weekend, those who called ''Rosebud'' at $10 million will receive $10 for each share of the ''Rosebud'' call that they purchased, and those with a put would lose the money they invested. If it made $5 million, those with the Put would receive $5 a share and those with a call would earn nothing. As of June 2006, Options have been renamed as Derivatives. ==Funds== Some veteran HSX players run special securities called funds. A fund is similar to a personal portfolio; however, all the holdings of this particular fund are visible to the public. Funds also have themes, so instead of being able to invest in any security, the fund manager may only be able to invest in horror movies, or sequels, or movies based on video games, for example. The price of a fund is only influenced by the stocks held by that fund, not by players who buy or sell the fund. Most funds cash out once they reach H$100 per share, or the equivalent of H$100 million for a personal portfolio. This type of security can help to educate newer players about how to effectively manage a portfolio, and is also an opportunity for slow
