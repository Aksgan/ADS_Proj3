works. Project Gutenberg is also closely affiliated with [[Distributed Proofreaders]], an internet-based community for proofreading scanned texts. == History == [[Image:Michael Hart and Gregory Newby at HOPE Conference.jpg|right|thumb|Michael Hart (left) and Gregory Newby (right) of Project Gutenberg, 2006]] Project Gutenberg was started by [[Michael S. Hart|Michael Hart]] in 1971 with the digitization of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].<ref name="GP_history">{{Cite web | url=http://www.zakon.org/robert/internet/timeline/ | title=Hobbes' Internet Timeline | accessdate=17 February 2009}}</ref> Hart, a student at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]], obtained access to a [[Xerox Sigma V]] [[mainframe computer]] in the university's Materials Research Lab. Through friendly operators, he received an account with a virtually unlimited amount of computer time; its value at that time has since been variously estimated at $100,000 or $100,000,000.<ref name="GP_history">{{Cite web | first=Michael S. | last=Hart | authorlink=Michael S.

His initial goal was to make the 10,000 most consulted books available to the public at little or no charge, and to do so by the end of the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Day, B.

A. | year=2000 | title=Literature in English: A Guide for Librarians in the Digital Age | pages=170 | publisher=Association of College and Research Libraries | location=Chicago | isbn=0838980813 }}</ref> This particular computer was one of the 15 [[Node (networking)|nodes]] on the [[computer network]] that would become the [[Internet]]. Hart believed that computers would one day be accessible to the general public and decided to make works of literature available in electronic form for free. He used a copy of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] in his backpack, and this became the first Project Gutenberg [[e-text]]. He named the project after [[Johannes Gutenberg]], the fifteenth century German printer who propelled the [[movable type]] [[printing press]] revolution. By the mid-1990s, Hart was running Project Gutenberg from [[Illinois Benedictine College]]. More volunteers had joined the effort. All of the text was entered manually up until 1989 when [[image scanner]]s and [[optical character recognition]] software improved and became more widely available, which made [[book scanning]] more feasible.<ref>{{Cite news | first=Vauhini | last=Vara | title=Project Gutenberg Fears No Google | publisher=Wall Street Journal | date=5 December 2005 | url=http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB113415403113218620-U_OqLOmApoaSvNpy5SjNwvhpW5w_20061209.html | accessdate=15 August 2007 }}</ref> Hart later came to an arrangement with [[Carnegie Mellon University]], which agreed to administer Project Gutenberg's finances. As the volume of e-texts increased, volunteers began to take over the project's day-to-day operations that Hart had run. [[Pietro Di Miceli]], an Italian volunteer, developed and administered the first Project Gutenberg website and started the development of the Project online Catalog. In his ten years in this role (1994â€“2004), the Project web pages won a number of awards, often being featured in "best of the Web" listings, and contributing to the project's popularity.<ref>{{Cite web | date=8 June 2006 | url=http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Credits | title=Gutenberg:Credits | publisher=Project Gutenberg | accessdate=15 August 2007 }}</ref> === Recent developments === In 2000, a [[non-profit organization|non-profit corporation]], the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, Inc. was chartered in [[Mississippi]] to handle the project's legal needs. Donations to it are [[tax deduction|tax-deductible]]. Long-time Project Gutenberg volunteer [[Gregory Newby]] became the foundation's first [[chief executive officer|CEO]].<ref name="it21"/> [[Charles Franks]] also founded [[Distributed Proofreaders]] (DP) in 2000, which allowed the proofreading of scanned texts to be distributed among many volunteers over the Internet. This effort greatly increased the number and variety of texts being added to Project Gutenberg, as well as making it easier for new volunteers to start contributing. DP became officially affiliated with Project Gutenberg in 2002.<ref>{{Cite web | author=Staff | month=August | year=2007 | url=http://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/dpf.php | title=The Distributed Proofreaders Foundation | publisher=Distributed proofreaders | accessdate=10 August 2007 }}</ref> {{As of|2007}}, the 10,000+ DP-contributed books comprised almost a third of the nearly {{Num PG books}} books in Project Gutenberg. Starting in 2004, an improved online catalog made Project Gutenberg content easier to browse, access and [[hyperlink]]. Project Gutenberg is now hosted by [[ibiblio]] at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. == CD and DVD Project == In August 2003, Project Gutenberg created a [[CD]] containing approximately 600 of the "best" e-books from the collection. The CD is available for download as an [[ISO image]]. When users are unable to download the CD, they can request to have a copy sent to them, free of charge. In December of that same year, a [[DVD]] was created containing nearly 10,000 items. At the time, this almost represented the entire collection. In early 2004, the DVD also became available by mail. In July 2007 a new edition of the DVD was released containing over 17,000 books, and in April 2010, a dual-layer DVD was released, containing nearly 30,000 items. The majority of the DVDs, and all of the CDs mailed by the project were recorded on recordable media by volunteers. However, the new dual layer DVDs were manufactured, as it proved more economical than having volunteers burn them. {{As of|October 2010}} the project has mailed approximately 40,000 discs. == Scope of collection == [[Image:Project Gutenberg total books.svg|right|400px|thumb|Growth of Project Gutenberg publications from 1994 until 2008.]] {{As of|December 2009}}, Project Gutenberg claimed over {{Num PG books}} items in its collection, with an average of over fifty new [[e-book]]s being added each week.<ref>According to [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/GUTINDEX-2006.txt gutindex-2006], there were 1,653 new Project Gutenberg items posted in the first 33 weeks of 2006. This averages out to 50.09 per week. This does not include additions to affiliated projects.</ref> These are primarily works of [[literature]] from the [[western culture|Western cultural tradition]]. In addition to literature such as novels, poetry, short stories and drama, Project Gutenberg also has [[cookbook]]s, [[reference work]]s and issues of periodicals.<ref>For a listing of the categorized books, see: {{Cite web | author=Staff | date=28 April 2007 | url=http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Category:Bookshelf | title=Category:Bookshelf | publisher=Project Gutenberg | accessdate=18 August 2007 }}</ref>
