Ragged matrices are not used in [[linear algebra]], since standard matrix transformations cannot be performed on them, but they are useful as [[array data structure|array]]s in [[computing]]. Irregular matrices are typically stored using [[Iliffe vector]]s. For example, the following is an irregular matrix: :<math> \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 31 & 12& -3 \\ 7 & 2 \\ 1 & 2 & 2 \end{bmatrix} </math> == See also == * [[Regular matrix]] * [[Sparse matrix]] ==References== * Paul E.

Suppose each element ''x'' of the set is independently assigned a weight ''w''(''x'') uniformly from {1, …, ''N''}, and the weight of a set ''S'' in <math>\mathcal F</math> is defined as :<math>w(S) = \sum_{x \in S} w(x).</math> Then, the probability that there is a ''unique'' set in <math>\mathcal F</math> of minimum weight is at least 1&minus;''n/N''. The remarkable thing about the lemma is that it assumes nothing about the nature of the family <math>\mathcal F</math>; for instance <math>\mathcal F</math> may include ''all'' 2<sup>''n''</sup> subsets, and (as the weight of each set in <math>\mathcal F</math> is in {1, …, ''nN''}), there would be an average of 2<sup>''n''</sup>/(''nN'') sets with the same weight. Still, with high probability, there is a unique set of minimum weight. ==Proof== ===Proof 1=== (The original proof from the paper.) Suppose we have fixed the weights of all elements except an element ''x''. Then ''x'' has a ''threshold'' weight ''α'', such that if the weight ''w''(''x'') of ''x'' is greater than ''α'', then it is not contained in any minimum-weight subset, and if <math>w(x) \le \alpha</math>, then it is contained in some set of minimum weight. Further, observe that if <math>w(x) < \alpha</math>, then ''every'' minimum-weight subset must contain ''x'' (since, when we decrease ''w(x)'' from ''α'', sets that do not contain ''x'' do not decrease in weight, while those that contain ''x'' do). Thus, ambiguity about whether a minimum-weight subset contains ''x'' or not can happen only when its weight is exactly equal to its threshold; in this case we will call ''x'' "singular". Now, as the threshold of ''x'' was defined only in terms of the weights of the ''other'' elements, it is independent of ''w(x)'', and therefore, as ''w''(''x'') is chosen uniformly from {1, …, ''N''}, :<math>\Pr[x\text{ is singular}] = \Pr[w(x) = \alpha] \le 1/N</math> and the probability that ''some'' ''x'' is singular is at most ''n/N''. As there is a unique minimum-weight subset [[iff]] no element is singular, the lemma follows. ===Proof 2=== This is a restatement version of the above proof, due to [[Joel Spencer]] (1995).<ref> {{citation | last=Jukna | first=Stasys | year=2001 | title=Extremal combinatorics: with applications in computer science | publisher=Springer | isbn=9783540663133 | url=http://lovelace.thi.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de/~jukna/EC_Book/index.html | pages=147–150}} [http://lovelace.thi.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de/~jukna/EC_Book/sample/147-150.pdf] </ref> For any element ''x'' in the set, define :<math>\alpha(x) = \min_{S \in \mathcal F, x \not\in S}w(S) - \min_{S\in\mathcal F, x\in S}w(S\setminus\{x\}). \, </math> Observe that <math>\alpha(x)</math> depends only on the weights of elements other than ''x'', and not on ''w''(''x'') itself. So whatever the value of <math>\alpha(x)</math>, as ''w''(''x'') is chosen uniformly from {1, …, ''N''}, the probability that it is equal to <math>\alpha(x)</math> is at most 1/''N''. Thus the probability that <math>w(x) = \alpha(x)</math> for ''some'' ''x'' is at most ''n/N''. Now if there are two sets ''A'' and ''B'' in <math>\mathcal F</math> with minimum weight, then, taking any ''x'' in ''A\B'', we have :<math>\begin{align} \alpha(x) &= \min_{S \in \mathcal F, x \not\in S}w(S) - \min_{S\in\mathcal F, x\in S}w(S\setminus\{x\}) \\ &= w(B) - (w(A)-w(x)) \\ &= w(x), \end{align}</math> and as we have seen, this event happens with probability at most ''n/N''. ==Examples/applications== {{Expand section|date=May 2010}} * The original application
