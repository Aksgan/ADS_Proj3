It is considered a branch of both [[philosophy]] and [[mathematics]]. One of the aims of logic is to identify the correct (or [[validity|valid]]) and incorrect (or [[fallacy|fallacious]]) [[inference]]s. Logicians study the criteria for the evaluation of [[logical argument|arguments]]. Logic investigates and classifies the structure of statements and arguments, both through the study of [[formal system]]s of inference and through the study of arguments in [[natural language]]. The scope of logic can therefore be very large, ranging from core topics such as the study of [[fallacies]] and [[paradox]]es, to specialized analyses of reasoning such as [[probability]], correct reasoning, and arguments involving [[causality]]. == Foundations of logic == {{Main|Philosophy of logic|Philosophical logic}} {{Columns|width=270px |col1 = * [[Analytic-synthetic distinction]] * [[Antinomy]] * [[A priori and a posteriori]] * [[Definition]] * [[Description]] * [[Entailment]] * [[Identity (philosophy)]] |col2= * [[Inference]] * [[Logical form]] * [[Logical implication]] * [[Logical truth]] * [[Logical consequence]] * [[Name]] * [[Necessary and sufficient condition|Necessity]] |col3= * [[Material conditional]] * [[Meaning (linguistic)]] * [[Meaning (non-linguistic)]] * [[Paradox]] * [[Possible world]] * [[Presupposition]] * [[Probability]] |col4= * [[Quantification]] * [[Reason]] * [[Reasoning]] * [[Reference]] * [[Semantics]] * [[Syntax (logic)]] * [[Truth]] * [[Truth value]] * [[Validity]] }} == Traditional logic == {{Main|Term logic|Classical logic}} {{Columns|width=270px |col1 = * [[Baralipton]] * [[Baroco]] * [[Bivalence]] * [[Boolean logic]] * [[Boolean-valued function]] * [[Categorical proposition]] * [[Commutativity of conjunction]] * [[De Morgan duality]] |col2= * [[Distribution of terms]] * [[Double negative elimination]] * [[End term]] * [[Enthymeme]] * [[Immediate inference]] * [[Idempotency of entailment]] * [[Law of contraries]] * [[Law of noncontradiction]] * [[Law of the excluded middle]] |col3= * [[Logical connective]] * [[Major term]] * [[Middle term]] * [[Minor term]] * [[Monotonicity of entailment]] * [[Organon]] * [[Polysyllogism]] * [[Port-Royal Logic]] * [[Premise]] |col4 = * [[Prior Analytics]] * [[Relative term]] * [[Sorites paradox]] * [[Square of opposition]] * [[Sum of Logic]] * [[Syllogism]] * [[Term logic]] * [[Tetralemma]] * [[Truth function]] }} ==Informal logic and critical thinking == {{Main|Informal logic|Critical thinking}} {{Columns |width=270px |col1 = * [[Argument]] * [[Accuracy and precision]] * [[Ad hoc hypothesis]] * [[Ambiguity]] * [[Analysis]] * [[Argument map]] * [[Argumentation theory]] * [[Attacking Faulty Reasoning]] * [[Belief]] * [[Belief bias]] * [[Bias]] * [[Cogency]] |col2= * [[Cognitive bias]] * [[Confirmation bias]] * [[Credibility]] * [[Critical thinking]] * [[Critical pedagogy]] * [[Critical reading]] * [[Decidophobia]] * [[Decision making]] * [[Dispositional and occurrent belief]] * [[Emotional reasoning]] * [[Evidence]] * [[Expert]] * [[Explanation]] * [[Explanatory power]] |col3= * [[Fact]] * [[Fallacy]] * [[Higher-order thinking]] * [[Informal logic]] * [[Inquiry]] * [[Interpretive discussion]] * [[Narrative logic]] * [[Occam's razor]] * [[Opinion]] * [[Practical syllogism]] * [[Precision questioning]] * [[Propaganda]] * [[Propaganda techniques]] * [[Prudence]] * [[Pseudophilosophy]] |col4= * [[Reasoning]] * [[Relevance]] * [[Rhetoric]] * [[Rigour]] * [[Socratic questioning]] * [[Source credibility]] * [[Source criticism]] * [[Theory of justification]] * [[Topical logic]] * [[Vagueness]] * [[Weak mindedness]] }} === Fallacies === {{Main|List of fallacies}} {{Formal Fallacy}} {{Informal Fallacy}} {{Relevance fallacies}} == Formal and mathematical logic == {{Main|Formal logic|Mathematical logic}} Mathematical logic, symbolic logic and formal logic are largely, if not completely synonymous.
