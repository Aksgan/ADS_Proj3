even a primary school teacher. The newest model of domestic helper, AppriAttenda, is developed by [[Toshiba]]. This is a robot that can fetch containers from a refrigerator by using its two arms and moves on wheels. The purpose in creating such robots is to make older people's lives easier when they have to manage alone. The robots could help them with basic tasks inside the house. The Japanese [[scientists]] in robotics have also created the first robotic fashion model, the [[HRP-4C]], a female-robot that is capable of strutting a catwalk, smiling, blinking, and pouting. Fumio Miyazaki, an engineering science professor at the Toyonaka Campus of [[Osaka University]], stated that Japanese scientists can provide thousands of humanoids that could be working alongside humans by the end of 2020s, if that is what the society wants. The progress that Japanese robotics engineers recorded was also possible due to the friendly image that Japanese people have towards the robots. In the Western countries, people seem to picture robots as [[evil]] and dangerous creatures and they fear that their jobs could be taken by robots. Japan is the country with the most industrial robot workers, over a quarter of a million robots mainly in an effort to reduce high labor costs and to support further mechanization of its industries. Robotics is to be for the Japanese [[economy]] in the 21st century what automobiles were in the 20th.<ref name="Time">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1913913,00.html#ixzz0j5ZxitJX |title=What's Behind Japan's Love Affair with Robots? |accessdate=2010-04-05 | work=Time | first=Lisa | last=Thomas | date=2009-08-03}}</ref> Robots are also seen as a solution to the declining birthrate and shrinking [[workforce]], a great problem of the Japanese society. Although the number of workers that a robot could replace varies on the type of industry, a robot may do the job for several workers and can provide an answer on the nation's declining work force and will weigh heavily on future pension and health care programs. ==History== Japan is a country with a cultural background when it comes to robotics. Among Japan's oldest robots are the [[karakuri ningyo]], or mechanical [[doll]]s. Karakuri ningyo are believed to have originated in China. During the Edo period (1603–1867), [[Takeda-za]] developed a mechanical-puppet theater which flourished in [[Osaka]]'s [[Dotonbori]] district.[http://int.kateigaho.com/spr05/robots.html] <!-- Japan was the first to have created [[Tamagotchi]], a little mechanical gadget that in a very short time has become the dearest pet for children all over the world.<ref name="JRob">{{cite web|url=http://www.japaneserobots.net/ |title=Japanese Robots |accessdate=2010-04-05}}</ref> --> The first idea of a robot was the cartoon character [[Astroboy]] outside Japan or Testuwan Atomu, in Japan. The most popular robot-hero, Astroboy was created by [[Osamu Tezuka]]'s imagination and is one of the most famous Japanese sci-fi robots. In middle of 20 century, Ichiro Kato professor of [[Waseda University]] studied humanoid robots. He made "WABOT-1" a full scale humanoid robot in 1973. WABOT-1 had two arms, walked on two legs and sees with two camera eyes.[http://www.humanoid.waseda.ac.jp/booklet/kato_2-j.html] In 1996 Honda announced the [[Honda P series|P2]] humanoid robot after which a number of companies and institutes started to develop humanoid robots for many purposes.

Most languages have such words; for example, "bang", "zap", "ding", "slither", "pop", etc. in [[English language|English]]. Sound symbolic words occur more often in Japanese than in English—they are found in formal as well as vernacular language. These words cannot all be considered [[onomatopoeia]]. Many mimetic words in Japanese are for things that don't make any noise originally, most clearly demonstrated by しいんと ''shiinto'', meaning "silently". ==Categories== They can be classified into three main categories: *Phonomime or [[onomatopoeia]] (擬声語 ''giseigo'' or 擬音語 ''giongo'') :words that mimic actual sounds. ''Giseigo'' refers to sounds made by living things, while ''Giongo'' refers to sounds made by inanimate objects. *Phenomime (擬態語 ''gitaigo'') :mimetic words to represent non-auditory senses. *Psychomime (also called 擬態語 ''gitaigo'' or 擬情語　''gijōgo'') :mimetic words that represent psychological states or bodily feelings. While [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] words abound in every language, phenomimes and psychomimes are much rarer. In [[Japanese grammar]], sound symbolic words function as [[adverb]]s, often taking the particle と (''to'') because they are seen as quotations. Most sound symbolic words can be applied to only a handful of verbs or adjectives. Japanese learners would be well advised to learn these words together with their possible referents. In the examples below, the classified verb or adjective is placed in square brackets. {| class="wikitable" |+ Some examples |- !align="center"| Sound Symbolism !align="center"| Meaning |- | じろじろ(と)[見る]<br />''jirojiro (to) [miru]'' || [see] intently (= stare) |- | きらきら(と)[光る]<br />''kirakira (to) [hikaru]'' || [shine] sparklingly |- | ぎらぎら(と)[光る]<br />''giragira (to) [hikaru]'' || [shine] dazzlingly |- | どきどき[する]<br />''doki doki [suru] || with a throbbing heart |- | ぐずぐず[する]<br />''guzu guzu [suru]'' || procrastinating or dawdling<br />(''suru''
