Stallman defends that in some cases, monetary incentive is not necessary for motivation since the pleasure in expressing creativity is a reward in itself (such as music and art).<ref name="Wardrip-Fruin, Noah 2003" /> == See also == {{Portal|Free software}} * [[Digital rights management]] * [[Free Culture Movement]] * [[Free software community]] * [[Free Software Foundation]] * [[GNU Manifesto]] * [[Linux adoption]] * [[Open Source Initiative]] * [[Open source governance]] * [[Open source movement]] * Projects ** [[BadVista]] ** [[Defective by Design]] ==References== {{Reflist|2}} == Further reading == * Johan Soderberg, ''Hacking Capitalism: The Free and Open Source Software Movement'', Routledge, 2007, ISBN 0415955432 ==External links== * [http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/09/29/what-is-free-software.html What is Free Software?] - Essay by Karl Fogel. * [http://fsfeurope.org/documents/rms-fs-2006-03-09.en.html The Free Software Movement and the Future of Freedom], a 2006 lecture by Richard Stallman * [http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-intro.html Free Software Movement intro by FSF] * [http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/ The GNU Project Philosophy Directory], containing many defining documents of the free software movement * [http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/4795 An interview with Stallman, "Free Software as a social movement"] * Christian Imhorst, [http://www.imhorst.net/translations/anarchy-and-source-code/ ''Anarchy and Source Code - What does the Free Software Movement have to do with Anarchism?]'', (license: [[GFDL]]), 2005 * [http://www.zeuux.org/law/billxu-rms-drm.html An anti-DRM campaign] - by Bill Xu and Richard Stallman * [http://www.apdip.net/news/fossdoc The Codebreakers - a freely redistributable movie] * [http://www.gnu.org/music/free-software-song.html Stallman's Free Software Song] {{FLOSS}} {{Intellectual property activism}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Free Software Movement}} [[Category:Copyleft media]] [[Category:Free software culture and documents]] [[Category:Free Software Foundation]] [[Category:GNU Project|*]] [[Category:Social movements]] [[bn:মুক্ত সফটওয়্যার আন্দোলন]] [[es:Movimiento del software libre]] [[hr:Pokret slobodnih programa]] [[id:Gerakan perangkat lunak bebas]] [[ja:フリーソフトウェア運動]] [[si:නිදහස් මෘදුකාංග ව්‍යාපාරය]] [[simple:Free software movement]] [[zh:自由软件运动]]</text> </page> <page> <id>14235</id> <title>Freedom of speech</title> <text>{{For|freedom of Speech in specific jurisdictions|Freedom of speech by country}} {{Other uses}} {{Freedom}} {{Censorship}} '''Freedom of speech''' is the freedom to speak freely without [[censorship]] or [[limitation]], or both. The synonymous term '''freedom of expression''' is sometimes used to indicate not only freedom of verbal speech but any act of seeking, receiving and imparting information or ideas, regardless of the medium used. In practice, the right to freedom of speech is not absolute in any country and the right is commonly subject to limitations, such as on "[[hate speech]]". The right to freedom of speech is recognized as a [[human right]] under Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and recognized in [[international human rights law]] in the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR). The ICCPR recognizes the right to freedom of speech as "the right to hold opinions without interference. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression."<ref>[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]</ref><ref>[http://www.allbusiness.com/corporate-governance/4082846-1.html Using Courts to Enforce the Free Speech Provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights | Australia & Oceania > Australia & New Zealand from All Business...<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Furthermore freedom of speech is recognized in European, inter-American and African regional human rights law. It is different from and not to be confused with the concept of [[freedom of thought]]. == The right to freedom of speech and expression == Concepts of freedom of speech can be found in early human rights documents<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/feb/05/religion.news | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Timeline: a history of free speech | first=David | last=Smith | date=2006-02-05 | accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref> and the modern concept of freedom of speech emerged gradually during the [[European Enlightenment]].<ref>"[http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/hum_303/enlightenment.html The Enlightenment]". [[Washington State University]].</ref> England’s [[Bill of Rights 1689]] granted 'freedom of speech in Parliament' and the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], adopted during the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, specifically affirmed freedom of speech as an inalienable right.<ref>"[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/feb/05/religion.news Timeline: a history of free speech]" [[The Guardian]]. February 5, 2006.</ref> The Declaration provides for freedom of expression in Article 11, which states that: <blockquote> "The free communication of ideas and opinions is one of the most precious of the rights of man. Every citizen may, accordingly, speak, write, and print with freedom, but shall be responsible for such abuses of this freedom as shall be defined by law."<ref>http://www.hrcr.org/docs/frenchdec.html</ref> </blockquote> Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], adopted in 1948, states that: <blockquote> "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."<ref>[http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/ Universal Declaration of Human Rights]</ref> </blockquote> Today freedom of speech, or the freedom of expression, is recognized in international and regional [[human rights law]]. The right is enshrined in Article 19 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], Article 10 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], Article 13 of the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] and Article 9 of the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]].<ref name=autogenerated1>Andrew Puddephatt, Freedom of Expression, The essentials of Human Rights, Hodder Arnold, 2005, pg.128</ref> Based on [[John Stuart Mill]]'s arguments, freedom of speech is understood as a multi-faceted right that includes not only the right to express, or disseminate, information and ideas, but three further distinct aspects: * the right to seek information and ideas; * the right to receive information and ideas; * the right to impart information and ideas.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> International, regional and national standards also recognize that freedom of speech, as the freedom of expression, includes any medium, be it orally, in written, in print, through the [[Internet]] or through art forms. This means that the protection of freedom of speech as a right includes not only the content, but also the means of expression.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> === Relationship to other rights === The right to freedom of speech and expression is closely related to other rights, and may be limited when conflicting with other rights (see [[Freedom of speech#Limitations on freedom of speech|Limitations on freedom of speech]]).<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The right to freedom of expression is also related to the [[right to a fair trial]] and court proceeding which may limit access to the search for information or
