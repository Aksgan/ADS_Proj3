Beginning in 2001, all Oregon Notaries were required to pass an open-book examination to receive their commission. Beginning in 2006, new notary applicants were also required to complete an online instructional course, however this requirement is waived for notaries who are renewing their commissions, as long as the commission is renewed before its expiration date. Oregon law specifically prohibits the use of the term "notorio publico" by a notary in advertising his or her services, but translation of the title into other languages is not restricted. ====Pennsylvania==== {{Main|Notary public (Pennsylvania)}} A notary in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is empowered to perform seven distinct official acts: take affidavits, verifications, acknowledgments and depositions, certify copies of documents, administer oaths and affirmations, and protest dishonored negotiable instruments.

Watkins]]'', {{ussc|367|488|1961}} to be unconstitutional. Historically, some states required that a notary be a [[citizen]] of the United States. However, the U.S. Supreme Court, in the case of ''[[Bernal v. Fainter]]'' {{ussc|467|216|1984}} (the ''Fainter'' case), declared that to be impermissible. In the U.S., there are reports of notaries (or people claiming to be notaries) having taken advantage of the differing roles of notaries in common law and civil law jurisdictions to engage in the unauthorized practice of law. [http://www.sos.state.tx.us/statdoc/ntpublico.shtml] The victims of such scams are typically illegal immigrants from civil law countries who need assistance with, for example, their immigration papers and want to avoid hiring an attorney. Confusion often results from the mistaken premise that a notary public in the United States serves the same function as a ''Notario Publico'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking countries (which are [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries, ''see below'').
