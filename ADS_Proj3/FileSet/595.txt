of Canonical analysis is then to find the relationship between X and Y, i.e. can some form of X represent Y. It works by finding the linear combination of X variables, i.e. X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub> etc., and linear combination of Y variables, i.e. Y<sub>1</sub>, Y<sub>2</sub> etc., which are most highly correlated. This combination is known as the "first canonical variates" which are usually denoted U<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>1</sub>, with the pair of U<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>1</sub> being called a "canonical function". The next canonical function, U<sub>2</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> are then restricted so that they are uncorrelated with U<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>1</sub>. Everything is scaled so that the variance equals 1. One can also construct relationships which are made to agree with constraint restrictions arising from theory or to agree with common sense/intuition. These are called maximum correlation models.(Tofallis, 1999) ==See also== *[[RV coefficient]] == References ==<!-- Auk117:308. --> * Hotelling, H. (1936) Relations between two sets of variates.

The company's focus shifted from enthusiast video cards to other areas of video hardware and software after the release of their Spectra line of products.<ref>[http://www.firingsquad.com/guides/tnt2buyers/page16.asp Firingsquad's TNT2 Buyer's Guide: What Happened to Canopus]</ref> Some of their previous competitors included [[Matrox]] and [[Pinnacle Systems]]. In 2005 Canopus was acquired by [[Thomson SA|Thomson Multimedia]] in order to bolster their [[Grass Valley (company)|Grass Valley]] broadcasting and network business.<ref>[http://www.thomsongrassvalley.com/news/2005/20051205-Canopus.html Thomson Buys 33 1/3% Stake in HD Video Editing Leader Canopus, Intends to Launch Public Tender Offer to Acquire Remaining Shares]</ref> When [[3dfx]]'s Voodoo series of PC-gaming-oriented 3D graphics cards became popular in the mid-1990s, Canopus was well-known for producing the Pure3D, a Voodoo-based graphics card with 6MB of memory instead of the standard 4MB. When the Voodoo 2 was released, the Canopus Pure3D II was praised for the fact that their cards were shorter than competitors' Voodoo 2 cards. Canopus also had a reputation for driver optimization, giving them a performance advantage over the other cards. They were the cards of choice for Maximum PC's 1998 Dream Machine. Canopus also released a version of the nVidia TNT that offered a unique internal cable to connect the TNT card to the Voodoo2 based Pure3D II, as opposed to the standard connection with an external cable. The '''Canopus DVStorm2''' was a realtime [[video editing card]], discontinued by Canopus in early 2005. Canopus is also known for [[Edius|EDIUS]], [[non-linear editing system|non-linear]] [[video editing software]]. Canopus also manufactures [[ProCoder]], software used for encoding MPEGs. However Canopus has been criticized for declining to provide its users with replacement keys [http://www.videohelp.com/tools/Canopus_ProCoder]. ==References== <!--See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref(erences/)> tags--> {{Reflist}} [[Category:Graphics hardware companies]] [[Category:Thomson SA]] {{ict-corp-stub}} [[de:Canopus (Unternehmen)]] [[ja:トムソン・カノープス]] [[zh:Canopus]]</text> </page> <page> <id>5437</id> <title>Canopy clustering algorithm</title> <text>{{Wikify|date=May 2010}} The '''canopy clustering algorithm''' in computing is an unsupervised [[Data clustering|clustering]] algorithm related to the [[K-means algorithm]]. It is intended to speed up clustering operations on large data sets, where using another algorithm directly may be impractical because of the size of the data set. The algorithm proceeds as follows: * Cheaply partitioning the data into overlapping subsets, called 'canopies' * Perform more expensive clustering, but only within these canopies ==Benefits== * The number of instances of training data that must be compared at each step is reduced * There is some evidence that the resulting clusters are improved ==References== *[http://www.kamalnigam.com/papers/canopy-kdd00.pdf McCallum, Nigam and Ungar: "Efficient Clustering of High Dimensional Data Sets with Application to Reference Matching"] *[https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAHOUT/Canopy+Clustering Mahout description of Canopy-Clustering] [[Category:Data clustering algorithms]] [[Category:Statistical algorithms]] [[Category:Machine learning]] [[Category:Neural networks]] {{algorithm-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>5442</id> <title>CapDesk</title> <text>{{unreferenced|date=May 2009}} {{No footnotes|date=May 2009}} {{cleanup|date=May 2009}} '''CapDesk''' is a [[desktop environment]] that rigorously applies the [[Principle of least authority]], in order to provide security for the user when running applications. Under CapDesk, applications are run with minimal authority, so that an application does not have access to a given file or directory until the user explicitly grants the application the right to access it. CapDesk is a research system that aims to show that this does not reduce the usability of the system. On the contrary; CapDesk's user interface is quite conventional from the user's point of view. Standard GUI mechanisms such as opening a file or using a [[file chooser]] are the basis for granting access rights to applications. CapDesk was the first system to implement a [[Powerbox]] [[file chooser]]. CapDesk is written in the [[E programming language]], which in turn is currently implemented in [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. ==Caplet== In the CapDesk desktop environment, a '''caplet''' is a program that starts off with no authority beyond the ability to interact with the user via a window and to request [[capability-based security|capabilities]] via a [[powerbox]]. The term is a pun on [[applet]], combining the term with "cap" which is short for "capability". Applets such as [[Java applet]]s often have no non-trivial use, because they do not have—and more importantly, cannot be granted—useful authority, such as the ability to save a file to the user's filesystem. In contrast, caplets are more useful, because they can request and be granted authority in a fine-grained but secure way. ==See also== *[[HP Polaris (computer security)]], a similar system, for running Windows applications *[[Bitfrost]] ==External links== *[http://www.combex.com/papers/darpa-review/index.html A Security Analysis of the Combex DarpaBrowser Architecture], David Wagner and
