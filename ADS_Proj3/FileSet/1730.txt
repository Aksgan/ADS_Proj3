such as [[GLONASS]] or the upcoming [[Galileo positioning system|Galileo]] can be incorporated or used to check the result. (By design, these systems use the same frequency bands, so much of the receiver circuitry can be shared, though the decoding is different.) == Accuracy enhancement and surveying == {{Main|GPS augmentation}} === Error sources and analysis === The [[Error analysis for the Global Positioning System|analysis of errors]] in the information reported by the Global Positioning System is important to estimating the accuracy of position estimates and correcting for the errors. The positioning data provided directly by the satellites is extremely precise but there are many factors that can make the errors in the data non-trivial. In situations where high accuracy is necessary, understanding and compensating for these sources of error is important. Sources of error include atmospheric distortion (predominantly in the ionosphere), satellite clock inaccuracies, and the travel delays of the satellite signals. === Augmentation === Integrating external information into the calculation process can materially improve accuracy. Such augmentation systems are generally named or described based on how the information arrives. Some systems transmit additional error information (such as clock drift, ephemera, or ionospheric delay), others characterize prior errors, while a third group provides additional navigational or vehicle information. Examples of augmentation systems include the [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS), [[European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service]] (EGNOS) , Differential GPS, [[Inertial Navigation System]]s (INS) and [[Assisted GPS]]. === Precise monitoring === Accuracy can be improved through precise monitoring and measurement of existing GPS signals in additional or alternate ways. The largest remaining error is usually the unpredictable delay through the ionosphere. The spacecraft broadcast ionospheric model parameters, but errors remain. This is one reason GPS spacecraft transmit on at least two frequencies, L1 and L2. Ionospheric delay is a well-defined function of frequency and the [[total electron content]] (TEC) along the path, so measuring the arrival time difference between the frequencies determines TEC and thus the precise ionospheric delay at each frequency. Military receivers can decode the P(Y)-code transmitted on both L1 and L2. Without decryption keys, it is still possible to use a ''codeless'' technique to compare the P(Y) codes on L1 and L2 to gain much of the same error information. However, this technique is slow, so it is currently available only on specialized surveying equipment. In the future, additional civilian codes are expected to be transmitted on the L2 and L5 frequencies (see [[GPS modernization]]). Then all users will be able to perform dual-frequency measurements and directly compute ionospheric delay errors. A second form of precise monitoring is called ''Carrier-Phase Enhancement'' (CPGPS). This corrects the error that arises because the pulse transition of the [[Pseudorandom number generator|PRN]] is not instantaneous, and thus the [[cross-correlation|correlation]] (satellite-receiver sequence matching) operation is imperfect. CPGPS uses the L1 carrier wave, which has a [[frequency|period]] of <math> \frac{1\ \mathrm{sec}}{1575.42 * 10^6} = 0.63475 \ \mathrm{nanoseconds} \approx 1 \ \mathrm{nanosecond} \ </math>, which is about one-thousandth of the C/A Gold code bit period of <math> \frac{1\ \mathrm{sec}}{1023 * 10^3} = 977.5 \ \mathrm{nanosecond} \ \approx 1000 \ \mathrm{nanosecond} \ </math>, to act as an additional [[clock signal]] and resolve the uncertainty. The phase difference error in the normal GPS amounts to {{convert|2|-|3|m|ft}} of ambiguity. CPGPS working to within 1% of perfect transition reduces this error to {{cm to in|3}} of ambiguity. By eliminating this error source, CPGPS coupled with DGPS normally realizes between {{convert|20|-|30|cm|in}} of absolute accuracy. ''Relative Kinematic Positioning'' (RKP) is a third alternative for a precise GPS-based positioning system. In this approach, determination of range signal can be resolved to a precision of less than {{cm to in|10}}. This is done by resolving the number of cycles that the signal is transmitted and received by the receiver by using a combination of differential GPS (DGPS) correction data, transmitting GPS signal phase information and ambiguity resolution techniques via statistical testsâ€”possibly with processing in real-time ([[Real Time Kinematic|real-time kinematic positioning]], RTK). === Timekeeping {{anchor|GPS time|GPS time and date}} === ==== Timekeeping and leap seconds ==== While most clocks are synchronized to [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), the atomic clocks on the satellites are set to ''GPS time'' (GPST; see the page of [[United States Naval Observatory]]). The difference is that GPS time is not corrected to match the rotation of the Earth, so it does not contain [[leap second]]s or other corrections that are periodically added to UTC. GPS time was set to match [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) in 1980, but has since diverged. The lack of corrections means that GPS time remains at a constant offset with [[International Atomic Time]] (TAI) (TAI - GPS = 19 seconds). Periodic corrections are performed on the on-board clocks to correct relativistic effects and keep them synchronized with ground clocks.{{cn|date=January 2011}} The GPS navigation message includes the difference between GPS time and UTC, which as of 2009 is 15 seconds because of the leap second added to UTC December 31, 2008. Receivers subtract this offset from GPS time to calculate UTC and specific timezone values. New GPS units may not show the correct UTC time until after receiving the UTC offset message. The GPS-UTC offset field can accommodate 255 leap seconds (eight bits) that, given the current rate of change of the Earth's rotation (with one leap second introduced approximately every 18 months), should be sufficient to last until approximately the year 2300. ==== Timekeeping accuracy ==== GPS time is accurate to about 14ns.<ref>{{cite web|author=David W. Allan |url=http://www.allanstime.com/Publications/DWA/Science_Timekeeping/index.html |title=The Science of Timekeeping |publisher=Hewlett Packard |date=1997}}</ref> ==== Timekeeping format ==== As opposed to the year, month, and day format of the [[Gregorian calendar]], the GPS date is expressed as a week number and a seconds-into-week number. The week number is transmitted as a ten-[[bit]] field in the C/A and P(Y) navigation messages, and so it becomes zero again every 1,024 weeks (19.6 years). GPS week zero started at 00:00:00 UTC (00:00:19 TAI) on January 6, 1980, and the week number became zero again for the first time at 23:59:47 UTC on
