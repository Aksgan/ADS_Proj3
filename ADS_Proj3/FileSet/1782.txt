Google pledged that, before taking photographs for Street View, they would in future notify the provinces' local government. Google Japan admitted that notifications and explanations of this kind had already been taking place in countries other than Japan, but had not done so in Japan as they were not aware of the potential privacy concerns.<ref>[[Yomiuri Shimbun]] (Japanese edition), February 4, 2009 Ver.13S page 28</ref> On May 13, 2009, Google Japan announced that it would modify their cameras to scan from a lower height of 2.05 meters above ground level, 95 centimeters lower than the original height of the camera head. The new height is intended to avoid having cameras view over fences in front of homes and into homes. This reduced height is to apply immediately, and all areas previously visited will be rescanned from the reduced height. Scans taken at the original height will remain available until they are replaced with the new images. <!-- Tried to edit this paragraph into coherent language yet I appreciate that it is not in the right place and perhaps should be (re)moved - I tried my best to make it fit. --> == Hong Kong == Before the launch of Google Street View in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data has taken the initiative to inquire into the Google Street View Project, to ensure that it complies with the provisions of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance in Hong Kong and to consider privacy issues that may arise. Google declares that the Project does not intend to compile information about specific individuals whose identities can be ascertained. Faces of passers-by and [[car licence plate]]s in the photographs will be unidentifiable because [[blurring technology]] is to be used. Also, there will be at least a three month gap between image gathering and publication, to prevent the images being used to identify an individual's current whereabouts. Google also assures the Commissioner that if anyone objects to any image of themselves, their cars, houses or children captured by the cameras, the related image will be removed. The commissioner concluded that Google Street View does not breach Hong Kong privacy laws. But he will look seriously into any complaint made by an affected individual in accordance with the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcpd.org.hk/english/infocentre/press_20090205.html|title=Privacy Commissioner inquired into Google Street View Project|publisher=HKPCPD|accessdate=August 19, 2009}}</ref> ==Switzerland== In November 2009, Switzerland's Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner Hanspeter Thür announced that his agency would be suing Google because in Street View "numerous faces and vehicle number plates are not made sufficiently unrecognizable from the point of view of data protection".<ref>[http://www.pcworld.com/article/182150/swiss_contend_google_doesnt_blur_street_view_enough.html Swiss Contend Google Doesn't Blur Street View Enough] [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] by Jeremy Kirk</ref> ==Middle East== In December 2010, Google revealed plans to introduce its Street View feature in the [[Middle East]], but stated there would be additional forms of censorship not previously seen in other parts of the world out of concern for the religious and cultural beliefs of those residing in these countries, the laws of these countries, and security concerns.
