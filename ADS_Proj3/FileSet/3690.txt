The software is a product of SIGMA Ingenieurgesellschaft mbH, [[Unna]], Germany. The basis of the brand name is the German word "Rohr" (pronounce it like “ROAR“) which means „Pipe“. ROHR2 offers the whole variety of stress codes, demanded by the daily work of the pipe stress engineer, such as ASME B31.1, B31.3, B31.4, B31.5, B31.8, EN 13480, several GRP pipe codes and nuclear stress codes ASME Cl. 1-3, KTA 3201.2, KTA 3211.2. ==Calculation basics and Software environment== The static analysis includes the calculation of any loads and load combinations according to the theories of first - and second order for linear and non-linear boundary conditions (friction, support lift). All loads can also be applied as dynamic loads with harmonic excitation. Furthermore, the dynamic analysis includes the calculation of eigenvalues and mode shapes as well as their processing in various modal response methods for the analysis of, for example, earthquakes and fluid hammer. An efficient superposition module enables a manifold selection and combination of static and dynamic results. The ROHR2 program system offers a complete software environment, consisting of ROHR2win, the graphical user interface, the ROHR2 calculation core and various additional programs like ROHR2ISO for Isometric representation, ROHR2FEM (FE-Analysis of selected pipe components) or ROHR2STOSS - Structural Analysis with Dynamic Loads using Direct Integration ==History== ROHR2 was created in the late 60s by one of the leading computer think tanks in in Germany, [[mbp]] in [[Dortmund]], which later on was taken over by EDS ([[Electronic Data Systems]]) group. In the late 80s the ROHR2 developer and support team moved over to SIGMA company in Dortmund From the year 2000 on, the complete licensing and sales activities are in the hands of SIGMA. SIGMA Ingenieurgesellschaft mbH is an engineering company basing on pipe engineering as well as software development. Under management of SIGMA the ROHR2 program system became the leading European pipe stress solution, offering a large number of interfaces for the transfer of data from and to CAD and CAE-world, as there are [[Plant Design Management System|PDMS]], CADISON, PDS, [[Bentley Systems|Bentley System]]'s AutoPLANT and PCF/ISOGEN supported software. The integration of ROHR2 into the users workflow is additionally supported by third-party interface products. ==Related products== ROHR2fesu - Finite Element Analysis of Substructures in ROHR2<br /> ROHR2iso - Creation of isometric drawings in ROHR2<br /> SINETZ - Steady State Calculation of Flow Distribution, Pressure Drop and Heat Loss in Branched and Intermeshed Piping Networks for compressible and incompressible media<br /> == External links == * [http://www.rohr2.com ROHR2 Homepage English] * [http://www.rohr2.de ROHR2 Homepage German] * [http://www.rohr2.com/html/francais.html ROHR2 Introduction French] [[Category:Structural analysis]]</text> </page> <page> <id>31035</id> <title>ROLAP</title> <text>{{Merge from|MOLAP|discuss=Talk:ROLAP#Merge discussion|date=September 2010}} <!--Note to editors: Please review the discussion page before making changes to the advantages or disadvantages. Thank you. --> '''ROLAP''' stands for '''R'''elational '''O'''n'''l'''ine '''A'''nalytical '''P'''rocessing. ROLAP is an alternative to the [[MOLAP]] (Multidimensional [[OLAP]]) technology. While both ROLAP and MOLAP analytic tools are designed to allow analysis of data through the use of a [[multidimensional data model]], ROLAP differs significantly in that it does not require the [[pre-computation]] and storage of information. Instead, ROLAP tools access the data in a [[relational database]] and generate [[SQL]] queries to calculate information at the appropriate level when an end user requests it. With ROLAP, it is possible to create additional database tables (''summary tables'' or ''aggregations'') which summarize the data at any desired combination of dimensions. While ROLAP uses a relational database source, generally the database must be carefully designed for ROLAP use. A database which was designed for [[OLTP]] will not function well as a ROLAP database. Therefore, ROLAP still involves creating an additional copy of the data. However, since it is a database, a variety of technologies can be used to populate the database. == ROLAP vs. MOLAP<ref name="ieee_cite">{{cite journal | last1 = Bach Pedersen | first1 = Torben | last2 = S.

In some cases there will be tools which are exceptions to any generalization made. === Advantages of ROLAP === <!--Note to editors: Please review the discussion page before making changes to the advantages or disadvantages. Thank you. --> * ROLAP is considered to be more scalable in handling large data volumes, especially models with [[Dimension (data warehouse)|dimensions]] with very high [[cardinality]] (i.e. millions of members). * With a variety of data loading tools available, and the ability to fine tune the [[Extract, transform, load|ETL]] code to the particular data model, load times are generally much shorter than with the automated [[MOLAP]] loads. * The data is stored in a standard [[relational database]] and can be accessed by any [[SQL]] reporting tool (the tool does not have to be an [[OLAP]] tool). * ROLAP tools are better at handling ''non-aggregatable facts'' (e.g. textual descriptions). MOLAP tools tend to suffer from slow performance when querying these elements. * By [[decoupling]] the data storage from the multi-dimensional model, it is possible to successfully model data that would not otherwise fit into a strict dimensional model. * The ROLAP approach can leverage [[database]] authorization controls such as row-level security, whereby the query results are filtered depending on preset criteria applied, for example, to a given user or group of users ([[SQL]] WHERE clause).
