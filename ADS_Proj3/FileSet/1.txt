These PHYs may also support an optional aggregation or bonding of multiple copper pairs, called [[PME Aggregation Function]] (PAF). Unlike [[10BASE-T]], [[100BASE-T]] and [[1000BASE-T]] PHYs, providing a single rate of 10, 100 or 1000 Mbit/s respectively, 10PASS-TS link rate can vary, depending on the copper channel characteristics, such as length, wire diameter ([[American wire gauge|gauge]]), number of pairs if the link is aggregated etc. == 10PASS-TS Equipment Manufacturers == *Extreme Copper, Inc.

Freeman]], who felt that toys should be both fun and educational. The toy was interactive, playing various tracks from a magnetic audio tape depending on the user's actions. The toy was released in two different time periods. The 1978 release was produced by a toy company called [[Mego Corporation]], and used [[Stereo 8|8-track]] tapes. It was brought back in [[1992]] by [[Tiger Electronics]] in a version that used [[Compact audio cassette|cassette tapes]] rather than 8-Track. ==Mego Corporation version== ===Description=== [[Image:2-XL.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mego Corporation's 2-XL circa 1978]] The original 2-XL (see image to right) was made of hard brown plastic, with white plastic on the front. The toy had two yellow light bulbs for eyes that flashed at various moments while the 8-track program tapes played, and he had four red push buttons on his stomach: *"Question" *"A or Yes Or True" *"B or More Info" *"C or No or False" There was also a volume and power on knob found on the lower right portion of the unit. At the bottom was a large slot where an 8-Track tape would be inserted. The toy
