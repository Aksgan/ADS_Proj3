It's also easy for [[Tcl/tk]] programmers to extend ical with custom functionality. It stores all calendaring information in a single flat text file per user that may be easily parsed by [[perl]] or [[Python_(programming_language)|python]] scripts. ical is not related to the [[iCalendar]] format standard, and does not utilize it. It is also not related to [[Apple Inc.]]'s calendaring application, confusingly called [[iCal]]. == External links == * [http://annexia.org/freeware/ical ical maintenance project] * [https://launchpad.net/ical-tcl ical development project] == See also == *[[List of personal information managers]] {{Unix-stub}} [[Category:Free calendaring software]] [[Category:Free software programmed in Tcl]]</text> </page> <page> <id>17815</id> <title>Icosian Calculus</title> <text>The '''Icosian Calculus''' is a non-commutative [[algebraic structure]] discovered by the Irish mathematician [[William Rowan Hamilton]] in 1856.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Memorandum respecting a new System of Roots of Unity |author=Sir William Rowan Hamilton |author-link=William Rowan Hamilton |url=http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Hamilton/Icosian/NewSys.pdf |journal=[[Philosophical Magazine]] |volume=12 |year=1856 |page=446 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Thomas L.

Hamilton’s discovery derived from his attempts to find an algebra of [[tuple|"triplets" or 3-tuples]] that he believed would reflect the three [[Cartesian coordinate system#Cartesian coordinates in three dimensions|Cartesian axes]]. The symbols of the Icosian Calculus can be equated to moves between vertices on a [[dodecahedron]].

They are: :<math> \begin{align} \iota^2 & = 1, \\ \kappa^3 & = 1, \\ \lambda^5 & = 1. \end{align} </math> Hamilton also gives one other relation between the symbols: :<math>\lambda = \iota\kappa.\,\!</math> (In modern terms this is the (2,3,5) [[triangle group]].) The operation is [[associative]] but not [[commutative]]. They generate a group of order 60, isomorphic to the [[group (mathematics)|group]] of rotations of a regular [[icosahedron]] or [[dodecahedron]]. Although the algebra exists as a purely abstract construction, it can be most easily visualised in terms of operations on the edges and vertices of a dodecahedron. Hamilton himself used a flattened dodecahedron as the basis for his instructional game. Imagine an insect crawling along a particular edge of Hamilton's labelled dodecahedron in a certain direction, say from <math>B</math> to <math>C</math>. We can represent this [[Graph_%28mathematics%29#Directed_graph|directed edge]] by <math>BC</math>. [[Image:Icosian_calculus_iota2.svg|thumb|right|400px|Geometrical illustration of operation iota in Icosian Calculus]] *The Icosian symbol <math>\iota</math> equates to changing direction on any edge, so the insect crawls from <math>C</math> to <math>B</math> (following the directed edge <math>CB</math>). *The Icosian symbol <math>\kappa</math> equates to rotating the insect's current travel anti-clockwise around the end point. In our example this would mean changing the initial direction <math>BC</math> to become <math>DC</math>. *The Icosian symbol <math>\lambda</math> equates to making a right-turn at the end point, moving from <math>BC</math> to <math>CD</math>. == Legacy == The Icosian Calculus is one of the earliest examples of many mathematical ideas, including: * presenting and studying a group by [[generators and relations]]; * a [[triangle group]], later generalized to [[Coxeter group]]s; * visualization of a group by a graph, which led to [[combinatorial group theory]] and later [[geometric group theory]]; * [[Hamiltonian circuit]]s and [[Hamiltonian path]]s in graph theory;<ref name="biggs" /> * [[dessin d'enfant]]<ref>{{Cite journal | title = Dessins d'enfants: bipartite maps and Galois groups | first = Gareth | last = Jones | journal = Séminaire Lotharingien de Combinatoire | volume = B35d | year = 1995 | pages = 4 | url = http://radon.mat.univie.ac.at/~slc/s/s35jones.html | postscript =, [http://www.emis.de/journals/SLC/wpapers/s35jones.pdf PDF] }}</ref><ref>W.

Prior to the presentation of the [[id Tech 5]]-based game [[Rage (game)|Rage]], the engines lacked official designation and as such were referred to as ''the Doom and Quake engines'', from the name of the main game series the engines have been developed for. ''id Tech'' numbers 1, 2 and 3 have been released as [[free software]] under the [[GNU General Public License]]. ==Predecessors to id Tech== id Software had developed 3D engines for several games before creating id Tech 1. Each game's engine had progressively more advanced 3D technology. * ''[[Hovertank 3D]]'' (1991) used solid-color drawn walls and scalable sprites. * ''[[Catacomb 3-D]]'' (1991) added [[texture mapping]] to the walls. * ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'' (1992) increased the color palette from 16-color [[EGA]] to 256-color [[VGA]]. The [[Wolfenstein 3D engine|game engine]] was also licensed out to other companies. * ''[[Shadowcaster]]'' (1993) features diminished lighting, texture mapped floors and ceilings, walls
