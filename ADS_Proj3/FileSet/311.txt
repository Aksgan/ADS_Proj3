Chatting both openly and privately was integrated into the game: this promoted shady non-aggression pacts, ganging up, and stabbing opponents in the back.

It has 5 opponents: Colony, Droolman, Mushman, Medusa, and Cephalo, and 40 levels in its current version. The AI uses a min/max alpha beta pruning strategy, with Medusa employing a 1 ply search and Cephalo employing a 2 ply search, which most players find difficult to beat.

It was invented by either the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] scientist [[Pieter van Musschenbroek]] (1692 – 1761)<ref>http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/aa__001biog15_01/aa__001biog15_01_0974.php A.J. van der Aa, Biographisch woordenboek der Nederlanden. Deel 12. Tweede stuk. J.J. van Brederode, Haarlem 1869</ref> or the [[Scotland|Scottish]] mathematician and engineer [[Sir John Leslie]] (1766 – 1832). A simple set up may be made by use of a [[porosity|porous]] flat plate-like object (a [[filter paper]], for example) which can draw water from an easily measurable source (a [[graduated cylinder]], for example) via a wick of some sort. As water evaporates from the surface, it tends to draw more water from the source through the wick by [[capillary action]] to replace the water lost by evaporation. By periodic measurements of the quantity of water remaining in the graduated cylinder, a rate of evaporation can be established. Also, using the surface area of the plate, we can establish a rate of evaporation per unit area. ==See also== *[[Lysimeter]] *[[Pan evaporation]] *[[Hook gauge evaporimeter]] ==External links== *http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/crops/04706.html -detailing use of modern Atmometer design in irrigation *http://www.ianrpubs.unl.edu/epublic/live/g1579/build/g1579.pdf -.pdf file detailing modified atmometer and use ==References== {{Reflist}} [[Category:Measuring instruments]] [[Category:Scottish inventions]] {{technology-stub}} [[ar:مقياس الأبخرة (الأتموميتر)]] [[de:Atmometer]] [[el:Εξατμισήμετρο]] [[fr:Évaporomètre]] [[id:Atmometer]] [[it:Evaporimetro]] [[pl:Atmometr]] [[sl:atmometer]]</text> </page> <page> <id>2676</id> <title>Atmospheric beast</title> <text>'''Atmospheric beasts''' are hypothetical non-winged [[organism]]s which could live in the [[atmosphere]] of [[planet]]s.

Through [[ufology]] history, many authors wondered if the purported spaceships they were allegedly investigating could be some kind of animals living in [[Earth's atmosphere]]. Early UFO writer [[Trevor James Constable]] believed that the UFO phenomenon was best explained by the presence of large [[amoeba]]-like animals inhabiting Earth's atmosphere. He called these hypothetical creatures "critters." Constable speculated that they spent most of their time in an invisible low-density state and propelled themselves through the air with "[[orgonic energy]], a force common to all living creatures". When they increased their density, the animals became visible. He thought that "critters" were carnivores and the [[Cattle mutilation|mutilated animal carcasses]] and [[unexplained disappearances]] were evidence that they sometimes preyed on humans and livestock. The implementation of [[radar]] was theorized to be the reason that the critters were being seen more often, as Constable imagined that it disturbs them out of hiding.<ref name="reece">{{cite book | last =Reece | first =Gregory L. | title =UFO Religion: Inside Flying Saucer Cults and Culture | publisher =I.
