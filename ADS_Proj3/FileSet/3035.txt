(software)|Utopia]] project and confines the amount of code that runs as root to a minimum. This package also contains a wrapper "pmount-hal" which reads information such as device labels and mount options from [[HAL (software)|HAL]] and passes them to pmount. To configure, the administrator would add a list of devices to /etc/pmount.allow that non-root users can mount: <source lang="bash"> echo /media/cdrom >> /etc/pmount.allow && echo /media/dvd >> /etc/pmount.allow && echo /media/thumbdrive >> /etc/pmount.allow </source> == gnome-mount == The gnome-mount package contains programs for mounting, unmounting and ejecting storage devices. The goal for gnome-mount is for GNOME software such as [[gnome-volume-manager]] and [[GNOME-VFS]] to use this instead of invoking mount/umount/eject/pmount or direct HAL invoking methods (GNOME previously used pmount). gnome-mount is not intended for direct use by users. All the gnome-mount programs utilize HAL methods and as such run unprivileged. The rationale for gnome-mount is to have a centralized place (in [[GConf]]) where settings such as mount options and mount locations are maintained. <ref>[http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/gnome/gnome-mount.html gnome-mount-0.6<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> == See also == * [[Mount (computing)]] * [[List of Unix programs]] == References == <references/> == External links == *[http://man.cat-v.org/unix-1st/1/mount mount(1) - The original Unix First Edition manual page for mount]. *{{man|8|mount}} *[http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/karmic/en/man8/mount.8.html mount (8)] - on a [http://manpages.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu Manpage Repository] *{{man|1|pmount}} *[http://pmount.alioth.debian.org/ pmount]. *{{man|1|gnome-mount}} *[http://www.examplenow.com/mount mount examples]. {{unix commands}} [[Category:Unix file system-related software]] [[Category:Standard Unix programs]] {{compsci-stub}} [[ca:Mount]] [[cs:Mount]] [[de:Mounten]] [[es:Mount]] [[fa:Mount (Unix)]] [[it:Mount]] [[hu:Mount (Unix)]] [[nl:Mounten]] [[ja:Mount (UNIX)]] [[pl:Mount]] [[pt:Mount (Unix)]] [[ru:Mount]] [[uk:Mount]]</text> </page> <page> <id>25168</id> <title>Mount Rainier (packet writing)</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=October 2009}} {{Optical disc authoring}} '''Mount Rainier''' ('''MRW''') is a format for writable [[optical disc]]s which provides the [[packet writing]] and defect management. Its goal is the replacement of the [[floppy disk]]. It is named after [[Mount Rainier]], a volcano near [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[USA]]. Mount Rainier can be used only with drives that explicitly support it (a part of [[SCSI]]/[[MultiMedia Commands|MMC]] and can work over [[ATAPI]]), but works with standard CD-R, CD-RW, DVD+/-R and DVD+/-RW media. The physical format of MRW disks is a layer placed in between the file system (e.g. [[UDF]] or [[FAT32]]) imposed by the operating system or the packet writing software used to write or read the disk and the physical layer which determines how data is written to or extracted from the optical disc. This is transparently managed internally by drive's [[firmware]] which remaps physical drive blocks into a virtual and defect-free space. Therefore the host computer does not see the physical format of the disk, only a sequence of data blocks capable of holding any [[filesystem]]. == Design == The time needed for the [[disk formatting]] is shortened to about one minute by the background formatting capabilities of the drive. Formatting allocates some [[Disk sector|sector]]s at the end of the disk for defect management. Defective sectors are recorded at a table in the [[lead-in (CD)|lead-in]] (an administrative area) and in a copy of the table in the [[lead-out]]. From the host computer's perspective, an MRW disc provides a defect-free block-accessible device, upon which any host supported filesystem may be written. Such filesystems may be [[File Allocation Table|FAT32]], [[NTFS]], etc., but the preferred format is usually UDF 1.02, as this file format is widely supported. An MRW-formatted CD-RW with a UDF filesystem gives approximately 500 MB free space. Mt. Rainier allows write access to a disc within seconds after insertion and spin-up, even while a background formatting sequence is taking place. Before this technology, a user would have to wait for the formatting to complete before writing any data to a new disc. It is even possible to read (but not write) MRW disks without an MRW-compatible drive; A "remapper" [[device driver]] is needed, an example of which is [[EasyWrite Reader]] for Windows. An alternative to MRW is to physically format a disc in UDF 1.5 or higher using the spared build. This is achieved by the use of specialized [[packet writing]] software, or operating systems that support UDF versions 1.5 and above. MRW capabilities overlap somewhat with that of UDF 1.5+. == Advantages and disadvantages == Advantages of MRW over UDF 1.5+ include: * fast background formatting of the media * finer grained packet size of 2K versus 64K * file system independence * does not depend on the host system to perform defect management Advantage of UDF 1.5+ over MRW include: * more portable, as UDF 1.5+ alone does not need specialized drive hardware to write, and the computer needs neither an MRW driver for a MRW-capable optical drive nor an MRW reader for drives that are incapable of reading MRW natively, reducing software overhead. == Operating system support == {{Expand section|State of support on Mac OS X|date=December 2009}} Mount Rainier is implemented natively in [[Windows Vista]] (2007). [[Linux]] has built-in MRW support since [[Linux kernel|kernel]] version 2.6.2 (2004). [[Amiga OS4]] supports this natively since the first beta appeared in 2004. Operating systems that don't support MRW natively (notably [[Windows XP]] and prior versions) need third-party software to read and write MRW-formatted discs, and these tend to be the same [[packet writing]] utilities which allow native UDF filesystems to be written to optical media. The EasyWrite logo is the marketing symbol created by [[Philips]] for CD drives that are Mount Rainier compatible. '''CD-MRW''' stands for [[Compact Disc]] – Mount Rainier [[CD-RW|Read/Write]]. ==External links== * [http://www.thehaus.net/AltOS/Linux/ht-mtrainier.shtml Mount Rainier Support in Linux] [[Category:SCSI]] [[Category:Computer file systems]] [[de:Mount Rainier (Technik)]] [[es:Mount Rainier (computación)]] [[it:Mount Rainier (packet writing)]] [[pl:Mount Rainier (zapis pakietowy)]] [[ru:Пакетная запись оптических дисков]]</text> </page> <page> <id>25199</id> <title>Mozilla application framework</title> <text>{{Portal|Free software}} The '''Mozilla application framework''' is a collection of [[cross-platform]] [[software componentry|software component]]s that make up the [[Mozilla]] [[application software|application]]s.
