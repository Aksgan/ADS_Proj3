of ''f'' very near ''x'', in the way that integer-power derivatives certainly do. Therefore it is expected that the theory involves some sort of [[boundary condition]]s, involving information on the function further out. To use a metaphor, the fractional derivative requires some [[peripheral vision]]. As far as the existence of such a theory is concerned, the foundations of the subject were laid by [[Liouville]] in a paper from 1832. The fractional derivative of a function to order ''a'' is often now defined by means of the [[Fourier transform|Fourier]] or [[Mellin transform|Mellin]] integral transforms. <ref>For the history of the subject, see the thesis (in French): Stéphane Dugowson, [http://s.dugowson.free.fr/recherche/dones/index.html ''Les différentielles métaphysiques''] (''histoire et philosophie de la généralisation de l'ordre de dérivation''), Thèse, Université Paris Nord (1994)</ref> ==Heuristics== A fairly natural question to ask is whether there exists an operator <math>H</math>, or '''half-derivative''', such that ::<math>H^2 f(x) = D f(x) = \dfrac{d}{dx} f(x) = f'(x) </math>. It turns out that there is such an operator, and indeed for any <math>a > 0</math>, there exists an operator <math>P</math> such that ::<math>(P ^ a f)(x) = f'(x) \,</math>, or to put it another way, the definition of <math>\dfrac{d^ny}{dx^n}</math> can be extended to all real values of ''n''. To delve into a little detail, start with the [[Gamma function]] <math>\Gamma \,</math>, which extends [[factorial]]s to non-integer values. This is defined such that ::<math>n! = \Gamma(n+1) \,</math>. Assuming a function <math>f(x)</math> that is defined where <math> x > 0 </math>, form the definite integral from 0 to ''x''. Call this ::<math> ( J f ) ( x ) = \int_0^x f(t) \; dt </math>. Repeating this process gives ::<math> ( J^2 f ) ( x ) = \int_0^x ( J f ) ( t ) dt = \int_0^x \left( \int_0^t f(s) \; ds \right) \; dt</math>, and this can be extended arbitrarily. The [[Cauchy formula for repeated integration]], namely ::<math> (J^n f) ( x ) = { 1 \over (n-1) ! } \int_0^x (x-t)^{n-1} f(t) \; dt,</math> leads to a straightforward way to a generalization for real ''n''. Simply using the Gamma function to remove the discrete nature of the factorial function (recalling that <math>\Gamma\left(n+1\right)\,=\,n!</math>, or equivalently <math>\Gamma\left(n\right)\,=\,(n-1)!</math>) gives us a natural candidate for fractional applications of the integral operator. ::<math> (J^\alpha f) ( x ) = { 1 \over \Gamma ( \alpha ) } \int_0^x (x-t)^{\alpha-1} f(t) \; dt</math> This is in fact a well-defined operator. It can be shown that the ''J'' operator satisfies ::<math> (J^\alpha) (J^\beta) f = (J^\beta) (J^\alpha) f = (J^{\alpha+\beta} ) f = { 1 \over \Gamma ( \alpha + \beta) } \int_0^x (x-t)^{\alpha+\beta-1} f(t) \; dt</math> this relationship is called the semigroup property of fractional [[differintegral]] operators. Unfortunately the comparable process for the derivative operator ''D'' is significantly more complex, but it can be shown that ''D'' is neither [[commutative]] nor [[additive]] in general.{{fact|date=April 2010}} ==Fractional derivative of a simple function== [[Image:Half-derivative.svg|right|thumb|320px|The half derivative (purple curve) of the function <math>f(x)=x</math> (blue curve) together with the first derivative (red curve).]] Let us assume that <math>f(x)</math> is a monomial of the form ::<math> f(x)=x^k\;.</math> The first derivative is as usual ::<math> f'(x)=\dfrac{d}{dx}f(x)=k x^{k-1}\;.</math> Repeating this gives the more general result that ::<math> \dfrac{d^a}{dx^a}x^k=\dfrac{k!}{(k-a)!}x^{k-a}\;,</math> Which, after replacing the [[factorial]]s with the [[Gamma function]], leads us to ::<math> \dfrac{d^a}{dx^a}x^k=\dfrac{\Gamma(k+1)}{\Gamma(k-a+1)}x^{k-a}\;.</math> For k = 1 and a = 1/2 we obtain the half-derivative of the function <math>x</math> as ::<math> \dfrac{d^{1/2}}{dx^{1/2}}x=\dfrac{\Gamma(1+1)}{\Gamma(1-1/2+1)}x^{1-1/2}=\dfrac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}x^{1/2}.</math> Repeating this process yields ::<math>\dfrac{d^{1/2}}{dx^{1/2}}2\pi^{-1/2}x^{1/2}=2\pi^{-1/2}\dfrac{\Gamma(1+1/2)}{\Gamma(1/2-1/2+1)}x^{1/2-1/2}=2\pi^{-1/2}\dfrac{\Gamma(3/2)}{\Gamma(1)}x^{0}=1,</math> which is indeed the expected result of ::<math> \left(\dfrac{d^{1/2}}{dx^{1/2}}\dfrac{d^{1/2}}{dx^{1/2}}\right)x=\dfrac{d}{dx}x=1.</math> This extension of the above differential operator need not be constrained only to real powers. For example, the <math>(1+i)</math>th derivative of the <math>(1-i)</math>th derivative yields the 2nd derivative. Also notice that setting negative values for ''a'' yields integrals. The complete fractional derivative which will yield the same result as above is (for <math>0<\alpha<1</math>) ::<math>D^{\alpha}f(x)=\frac{1}{\Gamma(1-\alpha)}\frac{d}{dx}\int_{0}^{x}\frac{f(t)}{(x-t)^{\alpha}}dt</math> For arbitrary <math>\alpha</math>, since the gamma function is undefined for arguments whose real part is a negative integer, it is necessary to apply the fractional derivative after the integer derivative has been performed. For example, ::<math>D^{3/2}f(x)=D^{1/2}D^{1}f(x)=D^{1/2}\frac{d}{dx}f(x)</math> ==Laplace transform== We can also come at the question via the [[Laplace transform]]. Noting that :<math>\mathcal L \left\{Jf\right\}(s) = \mathcal L \left\{\int_0^t f(\tau)\,d\tau\right\}(s)=\frac1s(\mathcal L\left\{f\right\})(s)</math> and :<math>\mathcal L \left\{J^2f\right\}=\frac1s(\mathcal L \left\{Jf\right\} )(s)=\frac1{s^2}(\mathcal L\left\{f\right\})(s)</math> etc., we assert :<math>J^\alpha f=\mathcal L^{-1}\left\{s^{-\alpha}(\mathcal L\{f\})(s)\right\}</math>. For example :<math> \begin{array}{lcr} J^\alpha\left(t^k\right) &= &\mathcal L^{-1}\left\{\dfrac{\Gamma(k+1)}{s^{\alpha+k+1}}\right\}\\ &= &\dfrac{\Gamma(k+1)}{\Gamma(\alpha+k+1)}t^{\alpha+k} \end{array} </math> as expected. Indeed, given the [[convolution]] rule <math>\mathcal L\{f*g\}=(\mathcal L\{f\})(\mathcal L\{g\})</math> (and shorthanding <math>p(x)=x^{\alpha-1}</math> for clarity) we find that :<math> \begin{array}{rcl} (J^\alpha f)(t) &= &\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)}\mathcal L^{-1}\left\{\left(\mathcal L\{p\}\right)(\mathcal L\{f\})\right\}\\ &=&\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)}(p*f)\\ &=&\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)}\int_0^t p(t-\tau)f(\tau)\,d\tau\\ &=&\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)}\int_0^t(t-\tau)^{\alpha-1}f(\tau)\,d\tau\\ \end{array} </math> which is what Cauchy gave us above. Laplace transforms "work" on relatively few functions, but they ''are'' often useful for solving fractional differential equations. ==Riemann–Liouville integral== The classical form of fractional calculus is given by the [[Riemann–Liouville integral]], essentially what has been described above. The theory for [[periodic function]]s, therefore including the 'boundary condition' of repeating after a period, is the [[Weyl differintegral]]. It is defined on [[Fourier series]], and requires the constant Fourier coefficient to vanish (so, applies to functions on the [[unit circle]] integrating to 0). By contrast the [[Grünwald–Letnikov derivative]] starts with the derivative instead of the integral. == Functional calculus == In the context of [[functional analysis]], functions ''f(D)'' more general than powers are studied in the [[functional calculus]] of [[Spectral theorem|spectral theory]]. The theory of [[pseudo-differential operator]]s also allows one to consider powers of ''D''. The operators arising are examples of [[singular integral operator]]s; and the generalisation of the classical theory to higher dimensions is called the theory of [[Riesz potential]]s. So there are a number of contemporary theories available, within which ''fractional calculus'' can be discussed. See also [[Erdélyi–Kober operator]], important in [[special function]] theory {{harv|Kober|1940}}, {{harv|Erdélyi|1950–51}}. == Applications == ==== Fractional Conservation of Mass ==== As described by Wheatcraft and Meerschaert (2008)<ref> Wheatcraft, S., Meerschaert, M., (2008).
