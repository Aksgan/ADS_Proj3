It consists of a set of tools based around a [[specification language]] (RSL) for [[software development]].

Typically the RAM image is loaded into RAM when the system is switched on, and it contains a second-level bootstrap loader and basic hardware drivers, enabling the unit to function as desired, or else more sophisticated [[software]] to be loaded into the system. {{DEFAULTSORT:Ram Image}} [[Category:Embedded systems]] {{Computer-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>30960</id> <title>RAPTOR (software)</title> <text>{{Infobox Software | name = RAPTOR | screenshot = [[Image:Jmol.png | 250px]] | caption = | author = [http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~jinbo/ Dr. Jinbo Xu] | developer = Bioinformatics Solutions Inc | latest release version = RAPTOR 4.2 | latest release date = Nov. 2008 | upcoming release version = RAPTOR 4.3 | next expected release date = December 2008 | operating system = Windows, Linux | genre = Protein structure prediction | website = http://www.bioinfor.com/raptor }} '''RAPTOR''' is protein threading software used for [[protein structure prediction]], given a primary sequence. ==Comparison of techniques== ===Protein threading vs. homology modeling=== Researchers attempting to solve a protein's structure start their a study with little more than a protein sequence. Initial steps may include performing a [[PSI-BLAST]] or [[PatternHunter]] search to locate a similar sequences with a known structure in the [[Protein Data Bank]] (PDB). If there are highly similar sequences with known structures, there is a high probability that this protein's structure will be very similar to those known structures as well as functions. If there is no homology found, the researcher must perform either [[X-ray crystallography]] or [[NMR spectroscopy | nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy]], both of
