She taught herself a smattering of programming languages and internet technologies, and after completing her MSc is in Biomedical science joined [[Arthur Andersen]] business consulting as an IT consultant. She went on to head business development for Easyspace Ltd., one of the UK's largest [[web hosting]] companies, and subsequently formed Memset with her brother, Nick, in late 2002. Memset has grown rapidly since inception, and Craig-Wood's foci on technology, innovation and corporate social responsibility have helped to secure Memset's position as a leading dedicated Web & IT hosting provider.

She is part of Intellect UK's directorial leadership group on energy and efficiency, and is very involved of the [[British Computer Society|British Computer Society's]] efforts on green IT via her committee membership of the [http://dcsg.bcs.org/ Data Centre Specialist Group]. ==Transsexual activism== Craig-Wood, born male and originally named Robert, completed a successful transsexual transition between October 2005 and November 2006. She wants to help transsexual people in the UK. In March 2008 she "came out" in the Sunday Times magazine in the hope that she might be the role model to younger transwomen that she never had, and also to try and dispel some myths about the transgendered.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/the_way_we_live/article3620849.ece|title=Best of Times, Worst of Times: Kate Craig-Wood|newspaper=The Sunday Times|date=30 March 2008}}</ref> She is also an executive committee member and trustee of the Gender Identity Research and Education Society, and is working with the group with a focus on improving medical care in the UK for young transpeople. == References == {{Reflist}} ==External links== *[http://kate.craig-wood.com/ Kate's personal website]. *[http://www.memset.com/ Memset Dedicated Hosting]. *[http://www.gires.org.uk/ The Gender Identity Research & Education Society]. {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME = Craig-Wood, Kate | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH = 1977 | PLACE OF BIRTH = | DATE OF DEATH = | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Craig-Wood, Kate}} [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:1977 births]] [[Category:Transgender and transsexual people]] [[Category:Women computer scientists]] [[Category:English chief executives]] [[Category:LGBT people from England]]</text> </page> <page> <id>20472</id> <title>Kd-tree</title> <text>{{lowercase|title=kd-tree}} [[Image:3dtree.png|thumb|A 3-dimensional ''k''d-tree. The first split (red) cuts the root cell (white) into two subcells, each of which is then split (green) into two subcells. Finally, each of those four is split (blue) into two subcells. Since there is no more splitting, the final eight are called leaf cells.|400px|right]] In [[computer science]], a '''''k''d-tree''' (short for ''k-dimensional [[tree data structure|tree]]'') is a [[space partitioning|space-partitioning]] [[data structure]] for organizing [[Point (geometry)|point]]s in a ''k''-dimensional [[Euclidean space|space]]. ''k''d-trees are a useful data structure for several applications, such as searches involving a multidimensional search key (e.g. range searches and [[nearest neighbor search]]es). ''k''d-trees are a special case of [[BSP tree]]s. ==Informal description== The kd-tree is a [[binary tree]] in which every node is a k-dimensional point. Every non-leaf node can be thought of as implicitly generating a splitting [[hyperplane]] that divides the space into two parts, known as subspaces. Points to the left of this hyperplane represent the left sub-tree of that node and points right of the hyperplane are represented by the right sub-tree. The hyperplane direction is chosen in the following way: every node in the tree is associated with one of the k-dimensions, with the hyperplane perpendicular to that dimension's axis. So, for example, if for a particular split the "x" axis is chosen, all points in the subtree with a smaller "x" value than the node will appear in the left subtree and all points with larger "x" value will be in the right sub tree. In such a case, the hyperplane would be set by the x-value of the point, and its [[Surface normal|normal]] would be the unit x-axis. ==Operations on ''k''d-trees== ===Construction=== Since there are many possible ways to choose axis-aligned splitting planes, there are many different ways to construct ''k''d-trees. The canonical method of ''k''d-tree construction has the following constraints: * As one moves down the tree, one cycles through the axes used to select the splitting planes. (For example, the root would have an ''x''-aligned plane, the root's children would both have ''y''-aligned planes, the root's grandchildren would all have ''z''-aligned planes, the next level would have an ''x''-aligned plane, and so on.) * Points are inserted by selecting the [[median]] of the points being put into the subtree, with respect to their coordinates in the axis being used to create the splitting plane. (Note the assumption that we feed the entire set of points into the algorithm up-front.) This method leads to a [[balanced tree|balanced]] ''k''d-tree, in which each leaf node is about the same distance from the root. However, balanced trees are not necessarily optimal for all applications. Note also that it is not ''required'' to select the median point. In that case, the result is simply that there is no guarantee that the tree will be balanced. A simple heuristic to avoid coding a complex linear-time median-finding algorithm or using an O(''n'' log ''n'') sort is to use sort to find the median of a ''fixed'' number of
