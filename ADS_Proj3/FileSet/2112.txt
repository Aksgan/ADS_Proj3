The term also encompasses the activity of acquiring identity documents from governing bodies by falsifying the required supporting documentation in order to create the desired identity. Identity documents differ from other credentials in that they are intended only to be usable by the person holding the card. Unlike other credentials, they may be used to restrict the activities of the holder as well as to expand them. Documents that have been forged in this way include [[driver's license]]s (which historically have been forged or altered as an attempt to conceal the fact that persons desiring to consume [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] are under the [[legal drinking age]]), [[birth certificate]]s and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] cards (likely used in [[identity theft]] schemes, or to [[defraud]] the government), and [[passport]]s (used to evade restrictions on entry into a particular country). At the beginning of 2010, there were 11 million stolen or lost passports listed in the global database of [[Interpol]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.havocscope.com/11-million-stolen-or-lost-passports-in-interpol-database/| title= 11 million stolen or lost passports in interpol database-Havocscope Black Markets|}}</ref> Such falsified documents can be used for [[identity theft]], age deception, [[illegal immigration]], and [[organized crime]]. ==Use scenarios, forgery techniques and security countermeasures== A distinction needs to be made between the different uses of an identity document. In one case, the fake ID may only have to pass a cursory inspection, such as flashing a plastic ID card for a security guard. At the other extreme, a document may have to resist scrutiny by a trained document examiner, who may be equipped with technical tools for verifying [[biometrics]] and reading hidden security features within the card. To make forgery more difficult, most modern IDs contain numerous security features that require specialised and expensive equipment to duplicate. School IDs are typically easier to fake, as they often do not have the same level of security measures as government-issued IDs. Modern fake ID cards almost invariably carry a picture of the authorized user, a simple and effective form of biometric identification. However, forgery of simple photographic ID cards has become simple in recent years with the availability of low-cost high-resolution printers and scanners and photo editing software. Simple fake ID cards are commonly made using an inkjet or laser printer to print a replica document which is then laminated to resemble a real ID card. Most designs are made using computer programs, re-creating
