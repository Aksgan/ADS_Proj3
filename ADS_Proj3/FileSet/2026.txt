in the 1980s. The '''IBM Future Systems project''' (FS) was officially started In September 1971, following the recommendations of a special task force assembled in the second quarter of 1971. In the course of time, several other research projects in various IBM locations merged into the FS project or became associated with it. === Project management === During its entire life, the FS project was conducted under tight security provisions. The project was broken down into many subprojects assigned to different teams. The documentation was similarly broken down into many pieces, and access to each document was subject to verification of the need-to-know by the project office. Documents were tracked and could be called back at any time. In Sowa's memo (see External Links, below) he noted ''The avowed aim of all this red tape is to prevent anyone from understanding the whole system; this goal has certainly been achieved.'' As a consequence, most people working on the project had an extremely limited view of it, restricted to what they needed to know in order to produce their expected contribution. Some teams were even working on FS without knowing. This explains why, when asked to define FS, most people give a very partial answer, limited to the intersection of FS with their field of competence. === Planned product lines === Three implementations of the FS architecture were planned: the top-of-line model was being designed in [[Poughkeepsie, NY]], where IBM's largest and fastest computers were built; the middle model was being designed in [[Endicott, New York|Endicott, NY]], which had responsibility for the mid-range computers; and the smallest model was being designed in [[Rochester, MN]], which had the responsibility for IBM's small business computers. A continuous range of performance could be offered by varying the number of processors in a system at each of the three implementation levels. Early 1973, overall project management and the teams responsible for the more "outside" layers common to all implementations were consolidated in the Mohansic ASDD laboratory (half way between the Armonk/White Plains headquarters and Poughkeepsie). === Project end === The FS project was killed in 1975. The reasons given for killing the project depend on the person asked, who puts forward the issues related to the domain with which he/she was familiar. In reality, the success of the project was dependent on a large number of breakthroughs in all areas from circuit design and manufacturing to marketing and maintenance. Although each single issue, taken in isolation, might have been resolved, the probability that they could all be resolved in time and in mutually compatible ways was practically zero. One symptom was the poor performance of its largest implementation, but the project was also marred by protracted internal arguments about various technical aspects, including internal IBM debates about the merits of RISC vs. CISC designs. The complexity of the instruction set was another obstacle, which was considered "incomprehensible" by IBM's own engineers. Moreover, simulations showed that the execution of native FS instructions on the high-end machine was slower than the [[System/370]] [[emulator]] on the same machine. The FS project was finally terminated when IBM realized that customer acceptance would be much more limited than originally predicted because there was no reasonable application migration path for 360 architecture customers. In order to leave maximum freedom to design a truly revolutionary system, ease of application migration was not one of the primary design goals for the FS project, but was to be addressed by software migration aids taking the new architecture as a given. In the end, it appeared that the cost of migrating the mass of user investments in COBOL and assembler based applications to FS was in many cases likely to be greater than the cost of acquiring a new system. == Results == Although the FS project as a whole was killed, a simplified version of the architecture for the smallest of the three machines continued to be developed in Rochester. It was finally released as the IBM [[System/38]], which proved to be a good design for ease of programming, but it was woefully underpowered. The [[AS/400]] inherited the same architecture, but with performance improvements. In both machines, the very CISCy instruction set generated by compilers is not interpreted, but translated into a lower-level machine instruction set and executed; the original lower-level instruction set was a CISC instruction set with some similarities to the [[System/360]] instruction set<ref>{{cite web|title=The Library for Systems Solutions Computing Technology Reference|url=http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/gg244100.pdf|publisher=[[IBM]]|pages=24–25|accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref>, with an extended version of the [[PowerPC]] instruction set, which evolved from John Cocke's RISC machine, used as the lower-level instruction set in later machines. Besides System/38 and the AS/400, which inherited much of the FS architecture, bits and pieces of Future Systems technology were incorporated in the following parts of IBM's product line: * the [[IBM 3081]] mainframe computer, which was essentially the System/370 emulator designed in Poughkeepsie, but with the FS microcode removed * the 3800 [[laser printer]], and some machines that would lead to the [[IBM 3270|IBM 3279]] terminal and [[GDDM]] * the [[IBM 3850]] automatic magnetic library * the [[IBM 8100]] mid-range computer, which was based on a CPU called the ''Universal Controller'', which had been intended for FS input/output processing * network enhancements concerning [[VTAM]] and [[IBM Network Control Program|NCP]] == Sources == * Building IBM [ISBN 0-262-16147-8] ==References== <references/> == External links == *[http://gdrean.perso.sfr.fr/papers/promises.html A review of a book about "what went wrong at IBM", discussing in particular the relation of the Future Systems project to the overall history of IBM] *[http://www.jfsowa.com/computer/memo125.htm An internal memo] by [[John F.
