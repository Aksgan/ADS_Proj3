or duplicate originals are then filed and stored in the notary's archives, or '''protocol'''. Notaries are generally required to undergo special training in the performance of their duties. Some must also first serve as an apprentice before being commissioned or licensed to practice their profession. In many countries, even licensed lawyers, e.g., [[barrister]]s or [[solicitor]]s, must follow a prescribed specialized course of study and be mentored for two years before being allowed to practice as a notary (e.g., British Columbia, England). However, notaries public in the U.S., of which the vast majority are lay people, require only a brief training seminar and are expressly forbidden to engage in any activities that could be construed as the [[practice of law]] unless they are also qualified attorneys. Yet, despite these apparent differences, notarial practice is universally considered to be distinct and separate from that of attorney (solicitor/barrister). In bijuridical jurisdictions, such as [[South Africa]] or [[Louisiana]], the Office of notary public is a legal profession with educational requirements similar to those for attorneys. Many even have institutes of higher learning that offer degrees in notarial law. Therefore, despite their name, "notaries public" in these jurisdictions are in fact civil-law notaries. ==History== ''For a more detailed account, see [[Civil law notary|Civil-law Notary]].'' Notaries Public (also called "notaries", "notarial officers", or "public notaries") hold an office which can trace its origins back to [[ancient Rome]], when they were called ''scribae'' ("scribe"), ''tabellius'' ("writer"), or ''notarius'' ("notary"). Their work would later be transcribed correctly in its entirety by a [[calligraphus]]. They are easily the oldest continuing branch of the [[legal]] profession worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The history of Notaries is set out in detail in Chapter 1 of ''Brooke's Notary'' (12th edition):<ref name="brookes">Chapter 1 of ''Brooke's Notary'' (12th edition)</ref><!--Wiki style requires sources to be cited either (a) after the quotation or (b) after the introductory sentence.

The office has its origin in the civil institutions of ancient Rome. Public officials, called ''scribae'', that is to say, scribes, rose in rank from being mere copiers and transcribers to a learned profession prominent in private and public affairs. Some were permanent officials attached to the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] and [[court]]s of law whose duties were to record public proceedings, transcribe state papers, supply magistrates with legal forms, and register the decrees and judgments of magistrates. :In the last century of the [[Republic of Rome|Republic]], probably in the time of [[Cicero]], a new form of shorthand was invented and certain arbitrary marks and signs, called ''notae'', were substituted for words in common use. A writer who adopted the new method was called a ''notarius''. Originally, a notary was one who took down statements in shorthand and wrote them out in the form of memoranda or minutes. Later, the title ''notarius'' was applied almost exclusively to registrars attached to high government officials, including provincial governors and secretaries to the Emperor. :Notwithstanding the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|collapse of the Western Empire]] in the 5th century AD, the notary remained a figure of some importance in many parts of continental Europe throughout the [[Dark Ages]]. When the civil law experienced its renaissance in [[Italy in the Middle Ages|medi√¶val Italy]] from the 12th century onwards, the notary was established as a central institution of that law, a position which still obtains in countries whose legal systems are derived from the civil law. :The separate development of the [[common law]] in [[England]], free from most of the influences of Roman law, meant that notaries were not introduced into England until later in the 13th and 14th centuries. At first, notaries in England were appointed by the [[Papal Legate]]. In 1279 the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] was authorized by the [[Pope]] to appoint notaries. Not surprisingly, in those early days, many of the notaries were members of the [[clergy]]. In the course of time, members of the clergy ceased to take part in [[secular]] business and laymen, especially in towns and trading centres, began to assume the official character and functions of a modern notary. :The [[English Reformation|Reformation]] produced no material change in the position and functions of notaries in England. However, in 1533 the enactment of "the Act Concerning Peter's Pence and Dispensations" ([[The Ecclesiastical Licences Act]], 1533) terminated the power of the Pope to appoint notaries and vested that power in the King who then devolved it to the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] who in turn devolved it to the [[Master of the Faculties]]. :Traditionally, notaries recorded matters of judicial importance as well as private transactions or events where an officially authenticated record or a document drawn up with professional skill or knowledge was required.}} ==Common law jurisdictions== The duties and functions of notaries public are described in ''Brooke's Notary'' on page 19 in these terms: :Generally speaking, a notary public [...] may be described as an officer of the law [...] whose public office and duty it is to draw, attest or certify under his official seal deeds and other documents, including [[Will (law)|wills]] or other testamentary documents, conveyances of [[Real property|real]] and [[personal property]] and [[Power of attorney|powers of attorney]]; to authenticate such documents under his signature and official seal in such a manner as to render them acceptable, as proof of the matters attested by him, to the judicial or other public authorities in the country where they are to be used, whether by means of issuing a notarial certificate as to the due execution of such documents or by drawing them in the form of public instruments; to keep a protocol containing originals of all instruments which he makes in the public form and to issue authentic copies of such instruments; to administer oaths and declarations for use in proceedings [...] to note or certify transactions relating to negotiable instruments, and to draw up protests or other formal papers relating to occurrences
