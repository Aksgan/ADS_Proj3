Typically used to refer to a living [[organism]], the concept came from that of [[milieu interieur]] that was created by [[Claude Bernard]] and published in 1865. Multiple dynamic equilibrium adjustment and regulation mechanisms make homeostasis possible. ==Biological== {{See|Human homeostasis}} With regards to any given life system [[parameter]], an organism may be a ''conformer'' or a ''regulator''. On one hand, regulators try to maintain the parameter at a constant level over possibly wide ambient environmental variations. On the other hand, conformers allow the environment to determine the parameter. For instance, [[endotherm]]ic [[animal]]s (mammals and birds) maintain a constant body temperature, while [[exotherm]]ic animals (almost all other organisms) exhibit wide body temperature variation. Behavioral [[adaptation (biology)|adaptation]]s allow endothermic animals to exert some control over a given parameter. For instance, [[reptile]]s often rest on [[sun]]-heated [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s in the morning to raise their body temperature. Regulators are also responsive to external circumstances, however: if the same sun-baked boulder happens to host a ground squirrel, the animal's [[metabolism]] will adjust to the lesser need for internal heat production. [[Image:wiki tarantula.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Thermal image of a cold-blooded [[tarantula]] ([[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]] or ectothermic) on a warm-blooded human hand ([[endothermic]]).]] An advantage of homeostatic regulation is that it allows an organism to function effectively in a broad range of environmental conditions. For example, ectotherms tend to become sluggish at low temperatures, whereas a co-located endotherm may be fully active. That thermal stability comes at a price since an automatic regulation system requires additional energy. One reason [[snake]]s may eat only once a week is that they use much less energy to maintain homeostasis. Most homeostatic regulation is controlled by the release of hormones into the bloodstream. However, other regulatory processes rely on simple diffusion to maintain a balance. Homeostatic regulation extends far beyond the control of temperature. Homeostasis requires the regulation of the [[PH#Living_systems|pH]] of the Blood at 7.365 (a measure of alkalinity and acid). All animals also regulate their [[blood glucose]], as well as the concentration of their blood. Mammals regulate their blood glucose with [[insulin]] and [[glucagon]]. The human body maintains glucose levels constant most of the day, even after a 24-hour fast. Even during long periods of fasting, glucose levels are reduced only very slightly.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Bhagavan|first= N.

See [[Dynamic equilibrium]]. If the glucose inside the cells is high the cells will convert it to the insoluble glycogen to prevent the soluble glucose interfering with cellular metabolism. Ultimately this lowers blood glucose levels, and Insulin helps to prevent [[hyperglycemia]]. When insulin is deficient or cells become resistant to it, [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] occurs. Glucagon, secreted by the alpha cells of the pancreas, encourages cells to break down stored [[glycogen]] or convert non-carbohydrate carbon sources to glucose via [[gluconeogenesis]], thus preventing [[hypoglycemia]]. The [[kidneys]] are used to remove excess water and ions from the blood. These are then expelled as [[urine]]. The kidneys perform a vital role in homeostatic regulation in mammals, removing excess water, salt, and [[urea]] from the blood. These are the body's main waste products. Another homeostatic regulation occurs in the gut. Homeostasis of the gut is not fully understood but it is believed that [[Toll-like receptor]] (TLR) expression profiles contribute to it. Intestinal epithelial cells exhibit important factors that contribute to homeostasis: 1) They have different cellular distribution of TLR’s compared to the normal gut mucosa. An example of this is how [[TLR 5|TLR5]] (activated by flagellin) can redistribute to the basolateral membrane, which is the perfect place where flagellin can be detected.<ref name="Ann M">Ann M O'Hara, Fergus Shanahan The gut flora as a forgotten organ.

TOLLIP is a human gene that is a part of the [[innate immune system]] and is highest in a healthy gut; it correlates to luminal bacterial load.<ref name="Ann M"/> 3) Surface enterocytes also express high levels of [[Interleukin-1 receptor]] (IL-1R) -containing inhibitory molecule. IL-1R are also referred to as single immunoglobulin IL-1R (SIGIRR). Animals deficient in this are more susceptible to induced colitis, implying that SIGIRR might possibly play a role in tuning mucosal tolerance towards commensal flora.<ref name="Ann M"/> Nucleotide-binding [[oligomer]]isation domain containing 2 (NOD2)
