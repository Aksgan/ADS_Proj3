If an intermediary service is present the process is called [[electronic commerce]]. An online shop, eshop, e-store, internet shop, webshop, [[webstore]], online store, or virtual store evokes the physical analogy of buying [[product (business)|product]]s or [[Service (economics)|service]]s at a [[Brick and mortar business|bricks-and-mortar]] [[Retailing|retailer]] or in a [[shopping mall]]. The process is called Business-to-Consumer (B2C) online shopping. When a business buys from another business it is called Business-to-Business (B2B) online shopping. Both B2C and B2B online shopping are forms of [[e-commerce]]. ==History== In 1990 [[Tim Berners-Lee]] created the first World Wide Web server and browser.<ref name="kimpalmer">Palmer, Kimberly.(2007) News & World Report.</ref> It opened for commercial use in 1991. In 1994 other advances took place, such as online banking and the opening of an online pizza shop by [[Pizza Hut]].<ref name="kimpalmer" /> During that same year, [[Netscape]] introduced SSL encryption of data transferred online, which has become essential for secure online shopping. Also in 1994 the German company [[Intershop Communications|Intershop]] introduced its first online shopping system. In 1995 [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] launched its online shopping site, and in 1996 [[eBay]] appeared.<ref name="kimpalmer" /> ==Customers== In recent years, online shopping has become popular; however, it still caters to the middle and upper class..In order to shop online, one must be able to have access to a computer, a bank account and a [[debit card]]. Shopping has evolved with the growth of technology. According to research found in the Journal of Electronic Commerce, if one focuses on the demographic characteristics of the in-home shopper, in general, the higher the level of education, income, and occupation of the head of the household, the more favourable the perception of non-store shopping., Enrique.(2005) The Impact of Internet User Shopping Patterns and Demographics on Consumer Mobile Buying Behaviour. Journal of Electronic Commerce Research, An influential factor in consumer attitude towards non-store shopping is exposure to technology, since it has been demonstrated that increased exposure to technology increases the probability of developing favourable attitudes towards new shopping channels.<ref name="enriquebigne">Bigne, Enrique.(2005) The Impact of Internet User Shopping Patterns and Demographics on Consumer Mobile Buying Behaviour. Journal of Electronic Commerce Research, VOL. 6, NO. 3.</ref> Online shopping widened the target audience to men and women of the middle class. At first, the main users of online shopping were young men with a high level of income and a university education. This profile is changing. For example, in USA in the early years of Internet there were very few women users, but by 2001 women were 52.8% of the online population. ==Logistics== Consumers find a product of interest by visiting the website of the retailer directly, or do a search across many different vendors using a [[shopping search engine]]. Once a particular product has been found on the web site of the seller, most online retailers use [[shopping cart software]] to allow the consumer to accumulate multiple items and to adjust quantities, by analogy with filling a physical shopping cart or basket in a conventional store. A "checkout" process follows (continuing the physical-store analogy) in which payment and delivery information is collected, if necessary. Some stores allow consumers to sign up for a permanent online account so that some or all of this information only needs to be entered once. The consumer often receives an e-mail confirmation once the transaction is complete. Less sophisticated stores may rely on consumers to phone or e-mail their orders (though credit card numbers are not accepted by e-mail, for security reasons). ===Payment=== Online shoppers commonly use [[credit card]] to make payments, however some systems enable users to create accounts and pay by alternative means, such as: * Billing to [[mobile phones]] and [[landline]]s<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/media-telecommunications/8910400-1.html|title=Bill-2-Phone Lets Customers Add Online Purchases to Their Phone Bill|website=Allbusiness.com|date=Saturday, September 1 2007,|author=Lopresti, Michael|accessdate=23 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/19/mopay-now-allows-you-to-bill-mobile-payments-to-a-land-line-account/|website=TechCrunch.com|July 19, 2010|author=Geena Rao|title=Mopay Now Allows You To Bill Mobile Payments To A Landline Account|accessdate=23 November 2010}}</ref> * [[Cash on delivery]] (C.O.D., offered by very few online stores) * [[Check]] * [[Debit card]] * Direct debit in some countries * [[Electronic money]] of various types * [[Gift card]]s * [[Money order|Postal money order]] * [[Wire transfer]]/delivery on payment Some sites will not accept international credit cards, some require both the purchaser's billing address and shipping address to be in the same country in which site does its business, and still other sites allow customers from anywhere to send gifts anywhere. The financial part of a transaction might be processed in real time (for example, letting the consumer know their credit card was declined before they log off), or might be done later as part of the fulfillment process. ===Product delivery=== Once a payment has been accepted the goods or services can be delivered in the following ways. * [[Download]]ing: This is the method often used for digital media products such as software, music, movies, or images. * [[Drop shipping]]: The order is passed to the manufacturer or third-party distributor, who ships the item directly to the consumer, bypassing the retailer's physical location to save time, money, and space. * [[Retailing|In-store pickup]]: The customer orders online, finds a local store using
