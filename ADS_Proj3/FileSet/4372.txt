philosophy== ===Technicism=== Generally, [[technicism]] is a reliance or confidence in technology as a benefactor of society. Taken to extreme, technicism is the belief that humanity will ultimately be able to control the entirety of existence using technology. In other words, human beings will someday be able to master all problems and possibly even control the future using technology. Some, such as [[Stephen V. Monsma]],<ref name="Monsma 1986">{{cite book| last = Monsma | first = Stephen V.| publisher = W.B. Eerdmans Pub. Co|location= [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]]| title = Responsible Technology | year= 1986| isbn = 0802801757 }}</ref> connect these ideas to the abdication of religion as a higher moral authority. ===Optimism=== {{See also|Extropianism}} Optimistic assumptions are made by proponents of ideologies such as [[transhumanism]] and [[singularitarianism]], which view [[technological evolution|technological development]] as generally having beneficial effects for the society and the human condition. In these ideologies, technological development is morally good. Some critics see these ideologies as examples of [[scientism]] and [[techno-utopianism]] and fear the notion of [[human enhancement]] and [[technological singularity]] which they support. Some have described [[Karl Marx]] as a techno-optimist.<ref name="Hughes 2002">{{cite paper| author = Hughes, James| title = Democratic Transhumanism 2.0| year= 2002 | url = http://www.changesurfer.com/Acad/DemocraticTranshumanism.htm| accessdate=2007-01-26}}</ref> ===Pessimism=== {{See also|Luddite|Neo-luddism|Anarcho-primitivism|Bioconservatism}} On the somewhat pessimistic side are certain philosophers like [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[John Zerzan]], who believe that technological societies are inherently flawed ''[[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]]''. They suggest that the result of such a society is to become evermore technological at the cost of freedom and psychological health. Many, such as the [[Luddite]]s and prominent philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]], hold serious reservations, although not ''a priori'' flawed reservations, about technology. Heidegger presents such a view in "[[The Question Concerning Technology]]": "Thus we shall never experience our relationship to the essence of technology so long as we merely conceive and push forward the technological, put up with it, or evade it. Everywhere we remain unfree and chained to technology, whether we passionately affirm or deny it."<ref name="Heidegger 1977">{{cite book | last = Lovitt | first = William | chapter = The Question Concerning Technology | year= 1977 | url = http://www.culturaleconomics.atfreeweb.com/Anno/Heidegger%20The%20Question%201954.htm | accessdate=2007-11-21 | title = The Question Concerning Technology and Other Essays | publisher = Harper Torchbooks | pages = 3–35 | isbn = 0613913140}}</ref> Some of the most poignant criticisms of technology are found in what are now considered to be dystopian literary classics, for example [[Aldous Huxley|Aldous Huxley's]] ''[[Brave New World]]'' and other writings, [[Anthony Burgess|Anthony Burgess's]] ''[[A Clockwork Orange]]'', and [[George Orwell|George Orwell's]] ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. And, in ''[[Faust]]'' by [[Goethe]], Faust's selling his soul to the devil in return for power over the physical world, is also often interpreted as a metaphor for the adoption of industrial technology. An overtly anti-technological treatise is ''[[s:Industrial Society and Its Future|Industrial Society and Its Future]]'', written by [[Theodore Kaczynski]] (aka The [[Unabomber]]) and printed in several major newspapers (and later books) as part of an effort to end his bombing campaign of the techno-industrial infrastructure. ===Appropriate technology=== {{See also|Technocriticism|Technorealism}} The notion of [[appropriate technology]], however, was developed in the 20th century (e.g., see the work of [[Jacques Ellul]]) to describe situations where it was not desirable to use very new technologies or those that required access to some centralized [[infrastructure]] or parts or skills imported from elsewhere. The [[eco-village]] movement emerged in part due to this concern. ==Other animal species== [[File:Gorilla tool use.png|right|thumbnail|This adult [[gorilla]] uses a branch as a [[walking stick]] to gauge the water's depth; an example of technology usage by primates.]]<!-- Could do with cropping --> The use of basic technology is also a feature of other animal species apart from humans.
