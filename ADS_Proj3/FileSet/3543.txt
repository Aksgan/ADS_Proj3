impairments. Problems remain with adding tags to older PDFs and those that are generated from scanned documents. In these cases, accessibility tags and re-flowing are unavailable, and must be created either manually or with [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] techniques. These processes are inaccessible to some disabled people. [[PDF/UA]], the PDF/Universal Accessibility Committee, an activity of [[AIIM]], is working on a specification for PDF accessibility based on ISO 32000. One of the significant challenges with PDF accessibility is that PDF documents have three distinct views, which, depending on the document's creation, can be inconsistent with each other. The three views are (i) the physical view, (ii) the tags view, and (iii) the content view. The physical view is displayed and printed (what most people consider a PDF document). The tags view is what screen readers read (useful for people with poor eyesight). The content view is displayed when the document is re-flowed to Acrobat (useful for people with mobility disability). For a PDF document to be accessible, the three views must be consistent with each other.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=1056 |title=Why PDF is a Hamburger |author=Chris Rusbridge |date=2008-04-29 |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref> === Security === PDF attachments carrying viruses were first discovered in 2001. This virus, named "OUTLOOK.PDFWorm" or "Peachy", uses [[Microsoft Outlook]] to send itself as an attachment to an Adobe PDF file. It was activated with Adobe Acrobat, but not with Acrobat Reader.<ref>Adobe Forums, [http://www.adobeforums.com/webx/.ef39082 Announcement: PDF Attachment Virus "Peachy"], 15 August 2001.</ref> From time to time, new vulnerabilities are discovered<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/support/security/#readerwin |title=Security bulletins and advisories |publisher=Adobe |date= |accessdate=2010-02-21}}</ref> in various versions of Adobe Reader, prompting the company to issue security fixes. One aggravating factor is that Adobe Reader can be configured to start automatically if a web page has an embedded PDF file, providing a vector for attack. If a malicious web page contains an infected PDF file that takes advantage of a vulnerability in Adobe Reader, the system may be compromised even if the browser is secure. Some of these vulnerabilities are a result of the PDF standard allowing PDF documents to be scripted with JavaScript. Disabling JavaScript execution in Adobe Reader can help mitigate unknown exploits that may be discovered in the future, although it will not provide protection against exploits in other parts of the PDF viewing software. Security experts argue that JavaScript is a nonessential feature and that the security benefit that comes from disabling JavaScript outweighs any incompatibility issues that may arise from doing so.<ref>[http://www.grc.com/sn/sn-187.txt Steve Gibson - SecurityNow Podcast]</ref> PDF file exploits can be mitigated to a much greater degree by having a third party web service convert them to another file format before viewing.<ref>[http://pdfcleaner.ossbox.com/ PDFCleaner - PDF Exploit Sanitizer]</ref> On March 30, 2010 security researcher Didier Stevens reported an Adobe Reader and Foxit Reader "exploit". The exploit results in an arbitrary executable being run if the user accepts a "launch executable" warning prompt.<ref>[http://blogs.pcmag.com/securitywatch/2010/03/malicious_pdfs_execute_code_wi.php PCmag.com blogs]</ref> === Usage restrictions and monitoring === PDFs may be [[encrypted]] so that a password is needed to view or edit the contents. The PDF Reference defines both 40-bit and 128-bit encryption, both making use of a complex system of [[RC4]] and [[MD5]]. The PDF Reference also defines ways in which third parties can define their own encryption systems for use in PDF. PDF files may also contain embedded [[digital rights management|DRM]] restrictions that provide further controls that limit copying, editing or printing. The restrictions on copying, editing, or printing depend on the reader software to obey them, so the security they provide is limited. The PDF Reference has technical details or see <ref>{{cite web|url=http://createpdf.adobe.com/cgi-feeder.pl/help_security?BP=&LOC=en_US |title=Create Adobe PDF Online - Security Settings Help |publisher=Createpdf.adobe.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-21}}</ref> for an end-user overview. Like HTML files, PDF files may submit information to a web server. This could be used to track the [[IP address]] of the client PC, a process known as [[phoning home]]. After update 7.0.5 to Acrobat Reader, the user will be notified "via a dialogue box that the author of the file is auditing usage of the file, and be offered the option of continuing."<ref>[http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewContent.do?externalId=332208&sliceId=2 New features and issues addressed in the Acrobat 7.0.5 Update (Acrobat and Adobe Reader for Windows and Mac OS)]</ref> Through its [[Adobe LiveCycle|LiveCycle Policy Server]] product, Adobe provides a method to set security policies on specific documents. This can include requiring a user to authenticate and limiting the timeframe a document can be accessed or amount of time a document can be opened while offline. Once a PDF document is tied to a policy server and a specific policy, that policy can be changed or revoked by the owner. This controls documents that are otherwise "in the wild." Each document open and close event can also be tracked by the policy server. Policy servers can be set up privately or Adobe offers a public service through Adobe Online Services. As with other forms of DRM, adherence to these policies and restrictions may or may not be enforced by the reader software being used. === Default display settings === PDF documents can contain display settings, including the page display layout and zoom level. Adobe Reader will use these settings to override the user's default settings when opening the document.<ref>{{cite web | title=Getting Familiar with Adobe Reader > Understanding Preferences | url=http://www.adobepress.com/articles/article.asp?p=412914 | accessdate=2009-04-22}}</ref> The free Adobe Reader cannot remove these settings. == Content == A PDF file is often a combination of [[vector graphics]], text, and [[raster graphics]]. The basic types of content in a PDF are: * text stored as such * vector graphics for illustrations and designs that consist of shapes and lines * raster graphics for photographs and other types of image In later PDF revisions, a PDF document can also support links (inside document or web page), forms, JavaScript (initially available as plugin for Acrobat 3.0), or any other types of embedded contents that can be handled using plug-ins. PDF 1.6 supports interactive 3D documents embedded in the PDF - 3D drawings can be embedded using [[U3D]] or [[PRC (file format)|PRC]] and various other data
