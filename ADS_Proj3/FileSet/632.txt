partially redesign the chip to take advantage of additional silicon area in future revisions to make the size small. The Cell architecture already makes explicit provisions for the size of the local store to vary across implementations. A chip-level interface is available to the programmer to determine local store capacity, which is always an exact binary power. It would be feasible to double the local store to 512 KiB per SPU leaving the total die area devoted to the SPU processors roughly unchanged. In this scenario, the SPU area devoted to the local store would increase to 60% while other areas shrink by half. Going this route would reduce heat, and increase performance on memory intensive workloads, but without yielding IBM much if any reduction in cost of manufacture.

In a typical implementation, non-java mode converts [[denormal]] values to zero but java mode traps into an emulator when the [[processor (computer science)|processor]] encounters such a value. ''Non-Java mode'' might or might not be faster, might or might not be non-compliant. Quadword (ie Four times a 32 bit word or 128 bits) alignment is on 16 Byte (128 bit) boundaries (ie the low four address bits are zero). The IBM ''PPE Vector/SIMD manual'' does not define operations for double precision floating point, though IBM has published material implying certain double precision performance numbers associated with the Cell PPE VMX technology. ====Intrinsics==== This feature is used to have SPU's assembly language instructions in C/C++. Instructions that differ only on the type of operand (such as a, ai, ah, ahi, fa, and dfa for addition) are represented by a single C/C++ intrinsic which selects the proper instruction based on the type of the operand. ====Porting VMX code for SPU==== There is a great body of code which has been developed for other IBM [[Power processors]] that could potentially be adapted and recompiled to run on the SPU. This code base includes VMX code that runs under the [[PowerPC]] version of [[Apple Computer|Apple's]] [[Mac OS X]], where it is better known as [[Altivec]]. Depending on how many VMX specific features are involved, the adaptation involved can range anywhere from straightforward, to onerous, to completely impractical. The most important workloads for the SPU generally map quite well. In some cases it is possible to port existing VMX code directly. If the VMX code is highly generic (makes few assumptions about the execution environment) the translation can be relatively straightforward. The two processors specify a different [[binary format|binary code format]], so recompilation is required at a minimum. Even where [[Instruction (computer science)|instructions]] exist with the same behaviours, they do not have the same instruction names, so this must be mapped as well. IBM provides compiler intrinsics which take care of this mapping transparently as part of the development toolkit. In many cases, however, a directly equivalent instruction does not exist. The workaround might be obvious or it might not. For example, if saturation behaviour is required on the SPU, it can be coded by adding additional SPU instructions to accomplish this (with some loss of efficiency). At the other extreme, if Java floating point semantics are required, this is almost impossible to achieve on the SPU processor. To achieve the same [[computation]] on the SPU might require an entirely different [[algorithm]] which needs to be written from scratch. The most important conceptual similarity between VMX and the SPU architecture is supporting the same [[vectorization model]]. For this reason, most algorithms successfully adapted to Altivec will usually adapt successfully to the SPU architecture as well. ==Local store exploitation== Local stores can be exploited using a variety
