the software that came with the camera is used as an automated tool to "upload" photos to the computer. The machine itself is almost always outfitted with as much [[RAM]] as possible and a large storage subsystem - big hard drives. [[RAID]] and external [[USB]] and [[Firewire]] drives are popular for storage. Most photographers consider a [[DVD]]-burner essential for making long term backups, and keep at least one set off-site. The term was coined by [[Gerard Holzmann]] of [[Bell Labs]] for a book entitled ''Beyond Photography: The Digital Darkroom'', in which he describes his pico image manipulation language (not to be confused with the [[pico programming language]]).<ref>[http://spinroot.com/pico/ Beyond Photography: The Digital Darkroom]</ref> Since there is no real darkroom used in the "digital darkroom", the term is a misnomer. == Software == The software employed in a digital darkroom varies greatly depending on the photographer's needs, budget and skill. The following are general areas and examples of software. '''Image Acquisition''': entails downloading images from a camera or removable storage device or importing from a scanner. [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Vista]] both include an inbuilt wizard for importing images, including scanning images. Many professionals however may choose an importation tool built into image management software such as [[Adobe Photoshop Lightroom]], [[Apple Aperture]] or [[ACDSee]]. '''Image Library Management''': involves managing images in a photographer's library and may extend to backing up images. Software such as Adobe Photoshop Lightroom and Apple Aperture are examples of major image management software. '''RAW Software''': software, either stand alone or as part of image library management software that is designed to import and process [[Raw image format|RAW]] images. Most digital cameras capable of outputting RAW images will include a program or plug-in for this purpose such as Canon RAW Image Converter. Programs such as [[Adobe Photoshop Lightroom]] and [[Apple Aperture]] include extensive support for RAW importation and processing. '''Image Editing''': There are countless image editing suites, programs and tools available. Adobe Photoshop is among the most highly used in professional circles as are programs from [[Apple Inc.]], [[Microsoft]], [[Macromedia]] (now Adobe), [[ACD Systems|ACD]] and various open source projects. Consumers may use professional software or choose less expensive options such as [[Adobe Photoshop Elements]] or free open source options such as [[The GIMP]]. '''Camera Control Software''': software that can remotely control a camera from a computer connected via USB. Normally included as utilities with camera, these allow photographers to control the camera from a nearby computer. Cameras such as the [[Canon 40D]] include such software and a live view mode so that a user may use a computer to control numerous functions of the camera while seeing a virtual viewfinder onscreen. == Hardware == As image size and resolution increases, so do the requirements for hardware in a digital darkroom. '''Computer''': A computer in a digital darkroom typically have a generous amount of RAM, often 4GB or more, coupled with discrete graphics and a powerful [[multicore processor]]. For much of the 1980s and 90s, [[Macintosh]] based systems were dominant in the digital imaging market as Adobe's powerful new Photoshop software had only then been developed for the Mac. However, Windows-based systems such as [[Dell]]'s high-end Precision range have become increasingly popular in recent times; better value for money than Apple's high-end Mac Pro and a more familiar [[Operating System]] are both factors that affect the choice of many prospective buyers of photo-editing systems. '''Cameras/Scanners''': Digital cameras and image scanners are increasing in quality, including the amount of colour they can capture and output. Many newer digital cameras can support wider colour spaces such as [[Adobe RGB]] and have higher resolution [[analog-to-digital converter]]s; 14 bits rather than the common 12 bits. '''Displays''': Professionals may use premium displays from companies such as [[EIZO]] and [[Dell]] which are capable of displaying a wider range of colours than consumer oriented devices. '''Printers''': In addition to computers and displays, digital darkrooms may include printing equipment, ranging from smaller size printers for proofing to large format productions printers. Scanner and studio photographic equipment may also be included. == Digimage Arts program == '''Digital Darkroom''' is also the trademarked name of an [[image editing]] program for the [[Macintosh]] published by Digimage Arts.<ref>[http://www.digimagearts.com/products.html<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> == References == <references/> [[Category:Digital photography]] [[Category:Photo software]] [[sl:Digitalna temnica]] [[sv:Digital mörkrumsteknik]]</text> </page> <page> <id>10345</id> <title>Digital Differential Analyzer (graphics algorithm)</title> <text>{{About|a graphics algorithm|other uses of DDA|DDA (disambiguation)|the digital implementation of a Differential Analyzer|Digital Differential Analyzer}} In [[computer graphics]], a hard- or software implementation of a '''[[Digital Differential Analyzer]] (DDA)''' is used for linear interpolation of variables over an interval between start and end point. DDAs are used for rasterization of lines, triangles and polygons. In its simplest implementation the DDA algorithm interpolates values in interval [(x<sub>start</sub>, y<sub>start</sub>), (x<sub>end</sub>, y<sub>end</sub>)] by computing for each x<sub>i</sub> the equations x<sub>i</sub> = x<sub>i−1</sub>+1, y<sub>i</sub> = y<sub>i−1</sub> + Δy/Δx, where Δx = x<sub>end</sub> − x<sub>start</sub> and Δy = y<sub>end</sub> − y<sub>start</sub>. == Performance == The DDA method can be implemented using [[floating-point]] or [[integer]] arithmetic. The native floating-point implementation requires one addition and one rounding operation per interpolated value (e.g. coordinate x, y, depth, color component etc.) and output result. This process is only efficient when an [[Floating-point unit|FPU]] with fast add and rounding operation is available. The [[Fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] integer operation requires two additions per output cycle, and in case of fractional part overflow, one additional increment and subtraction. The probability of fractional part overflows is proportional to the ratio m of the interpolated start/end values. DDAs are well-suited for hardware implementation and can be pipelined for maximized throughput. == See also == * [[Bresenham's line algorithm]] is an algorithm for line rendering. * [[Xiaolin Wu's line algorithm]] is an algorithm for line antialiasing == References == <references/> == Literature == *Alan Watt: ''3D Computer Graphics'', 3rd edition 2000, p. 184 (Rasterizing edges).
