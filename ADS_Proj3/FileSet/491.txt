'''bounded variation''', also known as a '''BV function''', is a [[real number|real]]-valued [[function (mathematics)|function]] whose [[total variation]] is bounded (finite): the [[graph of a function]] having this property is well behaved in a precise sense. For a [[continuous function]] of a single [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]], being of bounded variation means that the [[distance]] along the [[Direction (geometry, geography)|direction]] of the [[y-axis|''y''-axis]], neglecting the contribution of motion along [[x-axis|''x''-axis]], traveled by a [[point (mathematics)|point]] moving along the graph has a finite value. For a continuous function of several variables, the meaning of the definition is the same, except for the fact that the continuous path to be considered cannot be the whole graph of the given function (which is an [[Glossary of differential geometry and topology#H|hypersurface]] in this case), but can be every [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of the graph itself with a [[hyperplane]] (in the case of functions of two variables, a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]]) parallel to a fixed ''x''-axis and to the ''y''-axis. Functions of bounded variation are precisely those with respect to which one may find [[Riemann&ndash;Stieltjes integral]]s of all continuous functions. Another characterization states that the functions of bounded variation on a closed interval are exactly those ''f'' which can be written as a difference ''g'' &minus; ''h'', where both ''g'' and ''h'' are bounded [[monotonic function|monotone]]. In the case of several variables, a function ''f'' defined on an [[open subset]] '''<math> \Omega </math>''' of ℝ''<sup>n</sup>'' is said to have bounded variation if its [[distribution (mathematics)|distributional derivative]] is a finite [[Vector-valued function|vector]] [[Radon measure]]. One of the most important aspects of functions of bounded variation is that they form an [[Associative algebra|algebra]] of [[continuous function|discontinuous functions]] whose first derivative exists [[almost everywhere]]: due to this fact, they can and frequently are used to define [[generalized solution]]s of nonlinear problems involving [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]s, [[ordinary differential equation|ordinary]] and [[partial differential equation]]s in [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[engineering]]. Considering the problem of [[Distribution_(mathematics)#Problem_of_multiplication|multiplication of distributions]] or more generally the problem of defining general nonlinear operations on [[generalized function]]s, ''function of bounded variation are the smallest [[Algebra over a field|algebra]] which has to be embedded in every space of [[generalized function]]s preserving the result of [[multiplication]]''. ==History== According to Boris Golubov, ''BV'' functions of a single variable were first introduced by [[Camille Jordan]], in the paper {{Harv|Jordan|1881}} dealing with the convergence of [[Fourier series]]. The first successful step in the generalization of this concept to functions of several variables was due to [[Leonida Tonelli]]<ref>[[Leonida Tonelli|Tonelli]] introduced what is now called after him '''Tonelli plane variation''': for an analysis of this concept and its relations to other generalizations, see the entry "[[Total variation]]".</ref>, who introduced a class of ''[[continuous function|continuous]]'' ''BV'' functions in 1926 {{Harv|Cesari|1986|pp=47–48}}, to extend his [[direct method (calculus of variation)|direct method]] for finding solutions to problems in the [[calculus of variations]] in more than one variable. Ten years after, in {{Harv|Cesari|1936}}, [[Lamberto Cesari]] ''changed the [[continuous function|continuity]] requirement'' in Tonelli's definition ''to a less restrictive [[integral|integrability]] requirement'', obtaining for the first time the class of functions of bounded variation of several variables in its full generality: as Jordan did before him, he applied the concept to resolve of a problem concerning the convergence of [[Fourier series]], but for functions of ''two variables''. After him, several authors applied ''BV'' functions to study [[Fourier series]] in several variables, [[geometric measure theory]], [[calculus of variations]], and [[mathematical physics]]. [[Renato Caccioppoli]] and [[Ennio de Giorgi]] used them to define [[measure theory|measure]] of [[smooth function|non smooth]] [[boundary (topology)|boundaries]] of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] (see the entry about "''[[Caccioppoli set]]''" for further informations). [[Olga Arsenievna Oleinik]] introduced her view of [[generalized solution]]s for [[nonlinear]] [[partial differential equation]]s as functions from the space ''BV'' in the paper {{Harv|Oleinik|1957}}, and was able to construct a generalized solution of bounded variation of a first order partial differential equation in the paper {{Harv|Oleinik|1959}}: few years later, [[Edward D. Conway]] and [[Joel A. Smoller]] applied ''BV''-functions to the study of a single [[hyperbolic equation|nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equation]] of [[First-order partial differential equation|first order]] in the paper {{Harv|Conway|Smoller|1966}}, proving that the solution of the [[Cauchy problem]] for such equations is a function of bounded variation, provided the [[Cauchy boundary condition|initial value]] belongs to the same class. [[Aizik Isaakovich Vol'pert]] developed extensively a calculus for ''BV'' functions: in the paper {{Harv|Vol'pert|1967}} he proved the [[Bounded variation#Chain rule for BV functions|chain rule for BV functions]] and in the book {{Harv|Hudjaev|Vol'pert|1985}} he, jointly with his pupil [[Sergei Ivanovich Hudjaev]], explored extensively the properties of ''BV'' functions and their application. His chain rule formula was later extended by [[Luigi Ambrosio]] and [[Gianni Dal Maso]] in the paper {{Harv|Ambrosio|Dal Maso|1990}}. ==Formal definition== === ''BV'' functions of one variable === {{EquationRef|1|Definition 1.1.}} The '''total variation''' of a [[real number|real]]-valued (or more generally [[complex number|complex]]-valued) [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''<math>f</math>'', defined on an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] [''a'' , ''b'']⊂ℝ is the quantity :<math> V^a_b(f)=\sup_{P \in \mathcal{P}} \sum_{i=0}^{n_P-1} | f(x_{i+1})-f(x_i) |. \,</math> where the [[supremum]] is taken over the set <math> \scriptstyle \mathcal{P} =\left\{P=\{ x_0, \dots , x_{n_P}\}|P\text{ is a partition of } [a,b] \right\} </math> of all [[partition of an interval|partitions]] of the interval considered. If <math> f </math> is [[derivative|differentiable]] and its derivative is Riemann-integrable, its total variation is the vertical component of the [[arc length|arc-length]] of its graph, that is to say, :<math> V^a_b(f) = \int _a^b |f'(x)|\,\mathrm{d}x.</math> {{EquationRef|2|Definition 1.2.}} A real-valued function <math> f </math> on the [[real line]] is said to be of '''bounded variation''' ('''BV function''') on a chosen [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] <math>[a,b]</math>⊂ℝ if its total variation is finite, ''i.e.'' :<math> f \in BV([a,b]) \iff V^a_b(f) < +\infty </math> It can be proved that a real function ''ƒ'' is of bounded variation in an interval if and only if it can be written as the difference ''ƒ'' = ''ƒ''<sub>1</sub> &minus; ''ƒ''<sub>2</sub> of two non-decreasing functions: this result is known as the [[Jordan decomposition]]. Through the [[Stieltjes integral]], any function of bounded variation on a closed interval [''a'', ''b''] defines a [[bounded linear functional]] on ''C''([''a'', ''b'']).
