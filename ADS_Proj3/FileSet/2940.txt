the Rocks, Wired Magazine]</ref>. Some controversy over this latter statement exists<ref name="SlashdotMindVox">[http://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=136218&threshold=1&commentsort=0&tid=95&tid=172&tid=17&mode=thread&cid=11382332 MINDVOX was the oldest ISP in NYC, not Panix, Slashdot]</ref>; however, by the time the first MindVox test message was posted to [[Usenet]] in 1992<ref name="MVusenet">[http://groups.google.com/group/ny.test/msg/40852462c172b613?dmode=source MindVox usenet test message, 1992]</ref>, customers of the rival service, [[Panix (ISP)|Panix]], had made nearly 6,000 posts<ref name="MVusenet2">[http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%22panix+com%22&start=0&scoring=d&num=10&hl=en&lr=&as_drrb=b&as_mind=1&as_minm=1&as_miny=1981&as_maxd=7&as_maxm=3&as_maxy=1992&safe=off& Panix usenet messages]</ref>. The test message was apparently posted by the infamous [[Phiber Optik]], who would have been waiting for a [[Manhattan]] [[grand jury]] [[indictment]] at the time for hacking activities. Another potential "start date" for the service would be the registration of the service's ''phantom.com'' domain, on 14 February 1992. ==Founding and Early Years== {| align=right | <pre><nowiki> /\_-\ <((_))> \- \/ /\_-\(:::::::::)/\_-\ <((_)) MindVox ((_))> \- \/(:::::::::)\- \/ /\_-\ <((_))> \- \/ </nowiki></pre> |} The distinctive logo shown to the right was the system's original [[ASCII art]] banner, appearing on the text-only service's [[Dial-up access|dial-up]] login page. MindVox was originally accessible only through [[telnet]], [[ftp]] and direct dial-up. Its existence predates the invention of [[Secure Shell|SSH]] and widespread use of the [[World Wide Web]] by several years. In later years, MindVox was also accessible via the web<ref name="mindvoxWeb">[http://web.archive.org/web/19961111052514/http://phantom.com/ MindVox Web Page, 1996]</ref>. The parent company, ''Phantom Access Technologies, Inc.'' took its name from a hacking program written by Kroupa during his early teens, called [[Phantom Access]]<ref name="phantomAccess">[http://www.textfiles.com/exhibits/paccess/ Phantom Access Exhibit, Textfiles.com]</ref>. MindVox functioned both as a private [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] service, containing its own dedicated discussion groups, termed "conferences" — though usually referred to as "forums" by users — as well as a provider of internet and Usenet access. By 1994 the subscriber base was at around 3,000 <ref name="subscribers">[http://phantom.com/staticpage/Akashic/NYTimes3.html MindVox, Long a Haven for Hackers, Signs Off. NY Times]</ref>. In many ways MindVox was a harder, edgier, New York incarnation of the [[WELL (virtual community)|WELL]]<ref name="wellref1">[http://phantom.com/staticpage/Media/AssociatedPress1.html Wiring the Planet: MindVox! AP]</ref>,<ref name="well2">[http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.06/flux.html Wired Flux: MindVox April Fools]</ref>,<ref name="well3">[http://www.fiu.edu/~mizrachs/matrix-measure.html A Fortean's Guide To Computer Resources]</ref> (a famous Northern [[California]]n online community.) While users were drawn from all over the world, the majority lived in the New York City area, and members who met through the conferences often became acquainted in person, either on their own, or through what were termed "VoxMeats" (a formal gathering of members whose ''[[double entendre]]'' name was rumored to be well-earned.) Prominent MindVox "evangelists" included sci-fi author [[Charles Platt (science-fiction author)|Charles Platt]], who wrote about MindVox for [[Wired magazine|Wired]] Magazine<ref name="MindVoxWired" /> and featured it within his book ''Anarchy Online''<ref name="AnarchyOnline">[http://www.amazon.com/Anarchy-Online-Charles-Platt/dp/0061009903 Anarchy Online, Charles Platt]</ref>. MindVox also attracted (sometimes with the aid of free accounts<ref name="comped">[http://www.textfiles.com/bbs/MINDVOX/DOCUMENTS/complimentary Welcome Letter to VIP MindVox Members with comped accounts]</ref>) artists, writers, activists and luminaries such as [[Billy Idol]], [[Wil Wheaton]], [[Robert Altman]], [[Douglas Rushkoff]], [[John Perry Barlow]], and [[Kurt Cobain]]. The level of hysteria and hype surrounding MindVox was so great that in 1993 executives at [[MTV]] who were using the system wanted to buy it outright and turn MindVox into a subsidiary of [[Viacom]]<ref name="MTVMindVox">[http://new.ryze.com/view.php?who=RTercek Former Viacom exec discussing MTV's possible acquisition of MindVox]</ref>. =="Voices in My Head"== MindVox was deeply connected to the emerging non-academic [[Hacker (computing)|hacker]] culture and ideas about the potentials of [[cyberspace]], as can be seen in Patrick Kroupa's essay, ''Voices in my Head, MindVox: The Overture''<ref name="Overture">[http://wiretap.area.com/Gopher/Library/Cyber/mindvox.txt Voices in my Head, MindVox: The Overture]</ref>, which announced the upcoming opening of MindVox, and crossed the line into shaping an entire culture's mythology, seeing publication in magazines such as Wired<ref name="wired1">[http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/1.05/cybernaut.html Memoirs of a Cybernaut, Wired]</ref>, and extensive coverage throughout the media<ref name="mondo">[http://www.phantom.com/staticpage/Media/Mondo1.html There's A Party in my Mind... MindVox! Mondo 2000]</ref>. ''Voices'' provided a compelling and sweeping first-person overview of the cultural forces that were at play in the hacker underground during the decade that pre-dated MindVox, considered by some the "[[Golden Age]]" of cyberspace. More than a decade later, ''Voices'' remains one of the most read and widely-distributed pieces of writing to ever emerge about the origins and possible futures of cyberspace. It was the spark that propelled Kroupa out of obscurity <ref name="lozerz">[http://www.textfiles.com/100/lozers.hum OFFICIAL 1984 LOZERLIST]</ref>,<ref name="phrack">[http://www.phrack.com/issues.html?issue=42&id=3#article Lord Digital's Phrack Prophile]</ref>,<ref name="cud">[http://venus.soci.niu.edu/~cudigest/CUDS4/cud441.txt Computer Underground Digest's Jim Thomas, interviews Patrick Kroupa]</ref>,<ref name="phrack2">[http://www.phrack.com/issues.html?issue=36&id=5#article *ELITE ACCESS* as printed in Phrack]</ref>, and into the pages of books describing him as the [[Jim Morrison]] of cyberspace<ref name="HellsAngels" />. ''Voices'' also helped turn MindVox from being just another ISP into a counter-cultural media darling meriting full-length features in magazines and newspapers such as [[Rolling Stone]], [[Forbes]], [[The Wall Street Journal]], [[The New York Times]] and [[The New Yorker]]. =="Voice: Waffle ][+ the NeXTSTEP"== As with many things MindVox-related, the name of the software MindVox ran on, was both a play on words and an elaborate inside-joke. ''Voice: Waffle ][+ the NeXTSTEP'' (usually referred to simply as ''Voice,'' although it frequently was referred to by the plural ''Voices'' as well), was the name given to MindVox's conferencing system<ref name="voxfaq1">[http://www.textfiles.com/bbs/MINDVOX/FAQ/faq-1.01 MindVox FAQ, circa 1992]</ref>. [[Waffle (bbs)|Waffle]] refers to the original software that MindVox was based on<ref name="wafflefaq">[http://www.faqs.org/faqs/waffle-faq/ Waffle FAQ]</ref>, the ][+ pays homage to Kroupa and Fancher's hacker past and the use of [[Apple II]] computers; [[NeXTSTEP]] was a reference to the [[NeXT]] platform and operating system, with which MindVox was developed and launched. [[Image:Mv8ball.png|thumb|252px|left|MindVox promotional materials circa 1993. Phantom Access Technologies glyph on ray cast eightball.]] As much as Patrick Kroupa's ''Voices'' focused the media and counter-culture spotlight on MindVox; Fancher's software was a source of tremendous attention in many MindVox-related stories and it's unlikely that MindVox would have enjoyed its success without ''Voice''<ref name="wellref1" />. At the time MindVox launched, it was one of the first public-access ISPs in the world. The major technical difference between MindVox and every other system at the time, was instead of expecting newcomers to understand [[Unix]] and meet a cryptic [[Command prompt|shell prompt]], the entire system was accessible through Fancher's highly-flexible interface<ref name="boardwatch">[http://www.phantom.com/staticpage/Media/Boredwatch.html Boardwatch Magazine, MindVox article, 1992]</ref>. The original Waffle software was written by [[Tom Dell]]<ref name="tomdell">[http://bbsdocumentary.dreamhost.com/photos/057waffle/index.html Tom Dell in BBS the Documentary]</ref>,<ref name="wafflefaq" />, who was apparently part of MindVox from its inception<ref
