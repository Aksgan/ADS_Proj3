It is a "dictionary of things that there aren't any words for yet"; all the words listed are [[Toponym|place names]], and describe common feelings and objects for which there is no current English word. Examples are ''[[Shoeburyness]]'' ("The vague uncomfortable feeling you get when sitting on a seat which is still warm from somebody else's bottom," and the word is also the name of a town in southeast Essex, England) and ''[[Abinger]]'' ("One who washes up everything except the frying pan, the cheese grater and the saucepan which the chocolate sauce has been made in"). The book cover usually bears the tagline "This book will change your life!", either as part of its cover or as an [[adhesive label]]. ''[[Liff, Angus|Liff]]'' (a village near [[Dundee]] in Scotland) is then defined in the book as "A book, the contents of which are totally belied by its cover. For instance, any book the [[dust jacket]] of which bears the words, 'This book will change your life'." ==Origin== According to Adams' account in ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]'', the idea behind ''The Meaning of Liff'' grew out of an old school game, and started when he and Lloyd were on holiday together. In [[Neil Gaiman]]'s book ''[[Don't Panic: The Official Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Companion]]'' it is pointed out that essentially the same idea was used by the English humourist [[Paul Jennings (UK author)|Paul Jennings]] in an article ''Ware, Wye, Watford'', published in the late 1950s. Adams speculated that the teacher who originated the school game may have done so after reading the article. He sent a note of apology to Jennings. ==Versions== A revised and expanded edition of the original book, with about twice as many definitions, was published in 1990 as '''''The Deeper Meaning of Liff''''' (UK Edition: ISBN 0-330-31606-0, US Edition: ISBN 0-517-58597-9), though the original remains in print. Some of the new words in ''Deeper'' had previously appeared in a Liff piece by Adams, Lloyd and [[Stephen Fry]] in ''[[The Utterly Utterly Merry Comic Relief Christmas Book]]'' (1986). The main differences between the two editions (for either version of the book) are those of American English vs. British English spellings, though ''The Deeper Meaning of Liff'' contains different definitions for both the word "Glossop" and the titular word "Liff". In ''The Deeper Meaning of Liff'', Liff is defined as a phenomenon for which there is no word. Some of the definitions originally appeared in the ''[[Not the Nine O'Clock News]]'' spin-off book ''Not 1982'' (ISBN 0571118534), where they were headed "Today's new word from the Oxtail English Dictionary".<ref>[http://www.oxtailenglishdictionary.com/First.htm Oxtail English Dictionary], URL accessed August 10, 2007</ref> A German adaptation was made by Sven Böttcher under the title ''Der tiefere Sinn des Labenz'', published in 1992 (ISBN 3453879600). The meanings are translated from the original but are matched to place names that convey the humorous effect in German. The most recent edition includes both the German adaptation and the English original (ISBN 3-453-87960-0). ==See also== * [[Sniglet]] * [[Toponomy]] * [[Etymology]] * [[List of generic forms in British place names]] * ''[[The Devil's Dictionary]]'' * [[Daffynition]] ==References== {{Reflist}} <!--Please do *NOT* add links to sites that reproduce the definitions.

The book has been in print continuously since 1923. The most recent edition is the critical edition prepared by W. Terrence Gordon as volume 3 of the 5-volume set ''C. K Ogden & Linguistics'' (London: Routledge/Thoemmes Press, 1995). For full publication history, including serialized publication in ''The Cambridge Magazine'' prior to the first edition of the book, consult W. Terrence Gordon, ''C. K. Ogden: a bio-bibliographical study'' (Metuchen, NJ: Scarecrow Press, 1990) or contact the author. The book's focus is on how individuals use language. The book description states that ''Language is the most important of all the instruments of civilization.'' The book would later influence A.J. Ayer's ''Language, Truth and Logic'', an introduction to Logical Positivism, and both the Richards-Ogden book and the Ayer book would, in turn, influence Alec King and Martin Ketley in the writing of their book ''The Control of Language'', which appeared in 1939. This book would eventually lead C.S. Lewis to write the twentieth century's most powerful defense of natural law and objective values, ''The Abolition of Man'', which would be published in 1943. ==Reference== <references/> ==Coincidental titles== * "The Meaning of 'Meaning'" by [[Hilary Putnam]] (1975). ==See also== * [[Gostak]] * [[Embodied cognition]] * [[Linguistics]] * [[Psycholinguistics]] * [[Cognitive science]] * [[Semantics]] * [[General semantics]] * [[Pragmatics]] * [[Semiotics]] * [[Semiotic triangle]] * [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] {{Ling-stub|}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Meaning Of Meaning, The}} [[Category:Cognitive science]] [[Category:Linguistics books]] [[Category:Philosophy of language literature]] [[Category:Philosophy of mind literature]] [[Category:Cognitive science literature]] [[Category:Pragmatics]] [[Category:Psycholinguistics]] [[Category:Books in semantics]] [[Category:Books in semiotics]] [[Category:1923 books]]</text> </page> <page> <id>37399</id> <title>The Mythical Man-Month</title> <text>{{Infobox Book | name = The Mythical Man-Month | subtitle = Essays on Software Engineering | image = [[File:Mythical man-month (book cover).jpg]] | author = [[Frederick Brooks]] | subject = [[Software]] [[project management]] | publisher = [[Addison-Wesley]] | release_date = 1975, 1995 | isbn = 0-201-00650-2 (1975
