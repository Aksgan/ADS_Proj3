scientists and synthesized by [[organic chemistry]] and [[medicinal chemistry]]. The method of chemical library generation usually depends on the project. Typically, a range of chemicals is screened against a particular drug target or disease model, and the preliminary "hits", or chemicals that show the desired activity, are re-screened to verify their activity. Once they are qualified as a "hit" by their repeatability and activity, these particular chemicals are registered and analysed. Commonalities among the different chemical groups are studied as they are often reflective of a particular chemical subspace. Additional chemistry work may be needed to further optimize the chemical library in the active portion of the subspace. When it is needed, more synthesis is completed to extend out the chemical library in that particular subspace by generating more compounds that are very similar to the original hits. This new selection of compounds within this narrow range are further screened and then taken on to more sophisticated models for further validation in the [[Drug Discovery Hit to Lead]] process. ==Storage and management== The "chemical space" of all possible organic chemicals is large and increases exponentially with the size of the molecule. Most chemical libraries do not typically have a fully represented [[chemical space]] mostly because of storage and cost concerns. Because of the expense and effort involved in chemical synthesis, the chemicals must be correctly stored and banked away for later use to prevent early degradation. Each chemical has a particular shelf life and storage requirement and in a good-sized chemical library, there is a timetable by which library chemicals are disposed of and replaced on a regular basis. Some chemicals are fairly unstable, radioactive, volatile or flammable and must be stored under careful conditions in accordance with safety standards such as [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]]. Most chemical libraries are managed with information technologies such as [[barcoding]] and [[relational database]]s. Additionally, [[robotics]] are necessary to fetch compounds in larger chemical libraries. Because a chemical library's individual entries can easily reach up into the millions of compounds, the management of even modest-sized chemical libraries can be a full-time endeavor. [[Compound management]] is one such field that attempts to manage and upkeep these chemical libraries as well as maximizing safety and effectiveness in their management. ==See also== *[[Lead compound]] *[[Compound management]] *[[Druglikeness]] ==Further reading== *[http://www.rjcoms.com/data/pdfs/compound%20management.pdf Ian Yates.

The science of matter is also addressed by [[physics]], but while physics takes a more general and fundamental approach, chemistry is more specialized, being concerned with the composition, behavior (or reaction), structure, and properties of [[matter]], as well as the changes it undergoes during [[chemical reaction]]s.<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Chemistry Chemistry].

Retrieved August 19, 2007.</ref> It is a [[physical science]] which studies various [[chemical substance|substance]]s, [[atom]]s, [[molecule]]s, [[crystal]]s and other aggregates of matter whether in isolation or combination, and which incorporates the concepts of [[energy]] and [[entropy]] in relation to the [[spontaneous reaction|spontaneity]] of [[chemical process]]es. Disciplines within chemistry are traditionally grouped by the type of matter being studied or the kind of study. These include [[inorganic chemistry]], the study of [[inorganic]] matter; [[organic chemistry]], the study of [[organic compound|organic]] (carbon based) matter; [[biochemistry]], the study of [[chemical substance|substances]] found in [[organisms|biological organisms]]; [[physical chemistry]], the study of chemical processes using physical concepts such as [[thermodynamics]] and [[quantum mechanics]]; and [[analytical chemistry]], the analysis of material samples to gain an understanding of their [[chemical composition]] and [[Chemical structure|structure]]. Many more specialized disciplines have emerged in recent years, e.g. [[neurochemistry]] the chemical study of the [[nervous system]] (see [[#Subdisciplines|subdisciplines]]). ==Summary== Chemistry is the scientific study of interaction of [[chemical substance]]s<ref>[http://chemweb.ucc.ie/what_is_chemistry.htm What is Chemistry?]</ref> that are constituted of [[atom]]s or the subatomic particles: [[proton]]s, [[electron]]s and [[neutron]]s.<ref>[http://www.visionlearning.com/library/module_viewer.php?mid=49 Matter: Atoms from Democritus to Dalton] by Anthony Carpi, Ph.D.</ref> Atoms combine to produce [[molecule]]s or [[crystal]]s.

For example, [[steel]] is [[Hardness (materials science)|harder]] than iron because its atoms are bound together in a more rigid [[crystalline lattice]]; wood burns or undergoes rapid [[oxidation]] because it can react spontaneously with [[oxygen]] in a [[chemical reaction]] above a certain [[temperature]]; sugar and salt dissolve in water because their molecular/ionic properties are such that dissolution is preferred under the ambient conditions.
