line. For these reasons, operating agencies benefit from specifying that NTCIP be included in all future acquisitions and upgrades, even if NTCIP is not initially used.<ref name="ntcip-guide">[http://www.ntcip.org/library/standards/default.asp?documents=yes&qreport=no&standard=9001 The NTCIP Guide]</ref> According to the NTCIP Guide, use and application of the NTCIP provides the following benefits to [[Intelligent Transportation System]] (ITS) deployers:<ref name="ntcip-guide">[http://www.ntcip.org/library/standards/default.asp?documents=yes&qreport=no&standard=9001 The NTCIP Guide]</ref> * '''Avoiding Early Obsolescence''' — While retrofitting legacy equipment and systems with NTCIP support is not practical in most situations, most manufacturers offer NTCIP support in their ITS devices. It is possible to migrate a system gradually, since it is possible to operate a mixture of NTCIP and non-NTCIP devices in the same system, though not on the same communications line. Equipment may also continue to use a current protocol even though the device may also support NTCIP as a second protocol. Integrating legacy equipment and systems with NTCIP-conformant upgrades in this manner ensures that an operating agency’s systems and equipment remain useful and compatible long into the future. * '''Providing a Choice of Vendor''' — Since a computer system that supports NTCIP can communicate with any device from other vendors that are NTCIP-conformant, the number of vendors and systems, field devices, or software that can be considered for procurement increases greatly. While vendor-specific features may only be available to other software and ITS devices from the same vendor, the basic functionality described in an NTCIP standard is available regardless of vendor. This requires that agency specifications (procurement documents) adequately specify the mandatory and optional conformance requirements that support the agency’s functional requirements. However, NTCIP makes it easier for an agency to gradually change its software, controllers and other field devices from one vendor to supporting multiple vendors for the entire system. * '''Phased Procurement and Deployment''' — Specifying NTCIP allows agencies to procure devices and center systems in phases, over several financial cycles. For example, many agencies procure a few signs one year, then a few more the next year, and so on. Sometimes devices are procured from one vendor, and sometimes from multiple vendors. Specifying NTCIP standards means that multiple deployment phases, over multiple years, can be integrated, with little difficulty. The initial deployment establishes an ITS communications infrastructure that can be leveraged by future deployment phases resulting in improved cost/benefit for ITS projects. * '''Enabling Interagency Coordination''' — NTCIP allows agencies to exchange information and (with authorization) basic commands that enable any agency to monitor conditions in other agencies’ systems, and to implement coordinated responses to incidents and other changes in field conditions when needed. Such data exchange and coordinated response can be implemented either manually or automatically. One agency can monitor, and issue basic commands, if authorized, to field devices operated by another agency, even though those devices may be from a different vendor than those used by the monitoring agency. Potential applications of interagency coordination include: **(a) Coordinating timed transfers at a shared transit center, **(b) Coordinating traffic signals across jurisdictional boundaries, **(c) Providing traffic signal priority for selected, e.g., behind schedule, transit vehicles, **(d) Providing real-time information to a shared traveler information center, **(e) Monitoring traffic volumes on another agency’s roadway, **(f) Coordinating the operation of a freeway ramp meter with an adjacent traffic signal, or **(g) Posting a warning message on another agency’s dynamic message sign. *'''Use One Communications Network for All Purposes''' — NTCIP allows a management system to communicate with a mixture of device types on the same communications channel. For example, with the addition of appropriate application software in the system computer, a dynamic message sign could be installed near a signalized intersection, and the computer could communicate with the sign controller using the communications line or channel already in place for the traffic signal controller, if certain aspects of the communications protocols, that is, the Data Link and Physical layer protocols are the same. Similarly, a wide area network interface installed for communications with a system operated by another agency can be used for communications with any number of other systems, of any type, if NTCIP and the C2C Data Dictionaries and Message Sets of other efforts, such as the Traffic Management Data Dictionary (TMDD), are used. The communications network is usually one of the components of a transportation management system that requires the most resource investment. NTCIP ensures flexibility in the future use of that component. ==NTCIP Communications Standards== ===Center to Field Device Communications=== NTCIP has enabled the center to field communication and command/control of equipment from different manufacturers to be specified, procured, deployed, and tested.

This type of communication is similar to the Internet, in that any center can request information from, or provide information to, any number of other centers. An example of center to center communications is two traffic management centers that exchange real-time information about the inventory and status of traffic control devices. This allows each center system to know what timing plan, for example, the other center system is running to allow traffic signal coordination across center geographic boundaries. Other examples of this type of communication include:<ref name="ntcip-guide">[http://www.ntcip.org/library/standards/default.asp?documents=yes&qreport=no&standard=9001 The NTCIP Guide]</ref> * Two or more traffic signal systems exchanging information (including second-by-second status changes) to achieve coordinated operation of traffic signals managed by the different systems and to enable personnel
