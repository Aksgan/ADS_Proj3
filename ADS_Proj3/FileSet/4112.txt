==Causes of soft errors== ===Alpha particles from package decay=== Soft errors became widely known with the introduction of [[dynamic RAM]] in the 1970s. In these early devices, chip packaging materials contained small amounts of [[radioactive]] contaminants. Very low decay rates are needed to avoid excess soft errors, and chip companies have occasionally suffered problems with contamination ever since. It is extremely hard to maintain the material purity needed. Controlling alpha particle emission rates for critical packaging materials to less than a level of 0.001 counts per hour per cm<sup>2</sup> (cph/cm<sup>2</sup>) is required for reliable performance of most circuits. For comparison, the count rate of a typical shoe's sole is between 0.1 and 10 cph/cm<sup>2</sup>. Package radioactive decay usually causes a soft error by [[alpha particle]] emission. The positively charged alpha particle travels through the semiconductor and disturbs the distribution of electrons there. If the disturbance is large enough, a [[digital]] [[signal (information theory)|signal]] can change from a 0 to a 1 or vice versa. In [[combinational logic]], this effect is transient, perhaps lasting a fraction of a nanosecond, and this has led to the challenge of soft errors in combinational logic mostly going unnoticed. In sequential logic such as [[Latch (electronic)|latches]] and [[Random Access Memory|RAM]], even this transient upset can become stored for an indefinite time, to be read out later. Thus, designers are usually much more aware of the problem in storage circuits. ===Cosmic rays creating energetic neutrons and protons=== Once the electronics industry had determined how to control package contaminants, it became clear that other causes were also at work. [[James F. Ziegler]] led a program of work at [[IBM]] which culminated in the publication of a number of papers (Ziegler and Lanford, 1979) demonstrating that [[cosmic rays]] also could cause soft errors. Indeed, in modern devices, cosmic rays may be the predominant cause. Although the primary particle of the cosmic ray does not generally reach the Earth's surface, it creates a shower of energetic secondary particles. At the Earth's surface approximately 95% of the particles capable of causing soft errors are energetic neutrons with the remainder composed of protons and pions (Ziegler, 1996).<ref name="Ziegler">J.F. Ziegler, Terrestrial cosmic rays, IBM Journal of Research and Development, Vol. 40, no. 1, pp. 19-40, Jan 1996.</ref> This flux of energetic neutrons is typically referred to as "cosmic rays" in the soft error literature. Neutrons are uncharged and cannot disturb a circuit on their own, but undergo [[neutron capture]] by the nucleus of an atom in a chip. This process may result in the production of charged secondaries, such as alpha particles and oxygen nuclei, which can then cause soft errors. Cosmic ray flux depends on altitude. For the common reference location of 40.7N, 74W at 0 meters (sea level in New York City, NY, USA) the flux is approximately 14 neutrons / cm<sup>2</sup>/hour. Burying a system in a cave reduces the rate of cosmic-ray induced soft errors to a negligible level. In the lower levels of the atmosphere, the flux increases by a factor of about 2.2 for every 1000 m (1.3 for every 1000 ft) increase in altitude above sea level. Computers operated on top of mountains experience an order of magnitude higher rate of soft errors compared to sea level. The rate of upsets in [[aircraft]] may be more than 300 times the sea level upset rate. This is in contrast to package decay induced soft errors, which do not change with location. A model of the energetic neutron flux is presented in (Gordon & Goldhagen, 2004).<ref>Gordon, Goldhagen, "Measurement of the Flux and Energy Spectrum of Cosmic-Ray Induced Neutrons on the Ground, IEEE Trans on Nuclear Science, vol. 51, no. 6, pp. 3427-34, Dec. 2004.</ref> An online calculator for this model is available at [http://www.seutest.com www.seutest.com]. The average rate of cosmic-ray soft errors is ''inversely'' proportional to sunspot activity. That is, the average number of cosmic-ray soft errors decreases during the active portion of the [[sunspot cycle]] and increases during the quiet portion. This counterintuitive result occurs for two reasons. The sun does not generally produce cosmic ray particles with energy above 1 GeV that are capable of penetrating to the Earth's upper atmosphere and creating particle showers, so the changes in the solar flux do not directly influence the number of errors. Further, the increase in the solar flux during an active sun period does have the effect of reshaping the Earth's magnetic field providing some additional shielding against higher energy cosmic rays, resulting in a decrease in the number of particles creating showers. The effect is fairly small in any case resulting in a +/- 7% modulation of the energetic neutron flux in New York City. Other locations are similarly affected. Energetic neutrons produced by cosmic rays may lose most of their kinetic energy and reach thermal equilibrium with their surroundings as they are scattered by materials. The resulting neutrons are simply referred to as [[thermal neutrons]] and have an average kinetic energy of about 25 millielectron-volts at 25Â°C. Thermal neutrons are also produced by environmental radiation sources such as the decay of naturally occurring uranium or thorium. The thermal neutron flux from sources other than cosmic-ray showers may still be noticeable in an underground location and an important contributor to soft errors for some circuits. ===Thermal neutrons=== Neutrons that have lost kinetic energy until they are in thermal equilibrium with their surroundings are an important cause of soft errors for some circuits. At low energies many [[neutron capture]] reactions become much more probable and result in fission of certain materials creating charged secondaries as fission byproducts. For some circuits the capture of a thermal neutron by the nucleus of the B-10 isotope of boron is particularly important. This nuclear reaction is an efficient producer of an alpha particle, Li-7 nucleus and gamma ray. Either of the charged particles (alpha or Li-7) may cause a soft error if produced in very close proximity, approximately 5 micrometers, to a critical circuit node. The capture cross section for B-11
