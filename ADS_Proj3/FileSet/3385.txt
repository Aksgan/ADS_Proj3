to check the wiring of detachable mains cords. They do not however include tests which inolve applying mains power to the appliance under test, for example, a protective conductor current or touch current tests.[[Image:Prime_test_100.jpg|thumb|right|this is a picture of a basic PAT tester]] ===Mains Powered Pass / Fail PAT Testers=== [[File:PoweredPAT.jpg|right|]] The powered Pass / Fail PAT testers are the standard for most businesses who test in-house. It is ideal for those wanting to carry out in-house testing of electrical appliances in offices, hotels, schools, nursing homes, factories and construction sites. You usually get test result labels, which are attached to the electrical equipment that is being tested with a date stamp to show when the item next needs to be tested. The simplicity of these devices make them very popular with small businesses simply because of the PASS or FAIL display when a test is done. These testers are also safe for use on PCs and other IT equipment. The newer battery powered testers offer much more flexibility as the tester can be moved to the equipment as opposed to the other way round. ===Battery Powered Pass / Fail PAT Testers=== [[File:BattPAT.JPG|right|]] These are the newer and more convenient pass / fail PAT testers, which you can take to the appliance to be tested making testing multiple items in a business much quicker. They usually come with rechargeable batteries The battery powered testers are fast replacing the older powered units. The newer battery powered PAT testers have a simple "lights" system. They have a "Pass" light , a "Fail" light, options for Class I metal / plastic or Class II. They also will show: *Earth Continuity *Insulation Resistance *Polarity ===Advanced PAT Testers (Electricians' PAT Testers)=== These PAT Testers give the actual readings from the PAT tester in Ohms (or Mohms) for the person testing to interpret. A knowledge of electrical readings is required hence why these type of PAT Testers are designed for use by an electrician / someone with electrical qualifications. Also some hybrid designs will have the electrical readings along with a PASS / FAIL option. ===Advanced PAT Testers=== [[File:Transmille.jpg|right|]] These are PAT Testers designed to display more information than just pass or fail. As well as giving the Pass / Fail results it will give readings for the tester to interprete. Some of these include: *Earth Continuity Resistance (aka Earth Bond) tests with a measurement range of 0 - 1.99Î© at high test currents (usually 8A, 10A or 25A) and lower test currents (in the range 20mA to 200mA), enabling a complete range of appliances including personal computers to be tested. *Insulation Resistance tests at test voltages of 500Vdc or 250Vdc. *Protective Conductor/Touch Current measurement (sometimes referred to as Earth Leakage tests on some older PAT units). *Fuse test. *Lead Polarity *Some units incorporate an [[Residual-current device|RCD]] test function. * Testing both 230V and 110V appliances Advanced PAT testers are also much more effective as facilities management tools because of their ability to log, capture and record the location and test status of electrical equipment and appliances. '''RCD Testing''' In the most modern PAT testers RCD testing is now included in the suite of test options available. This follows the inclusion of new advice in the IEE Code of Practice that when an extension lead or multiway adaptor is fitted with an RCD, the operation of the RCD should be checked to determine that the trip time is within specified limits.[[Image:PrimeTest_250_RCD.jpg|thumb|left|Modern PAT testers include an RCD test]] ===Computerised PAT Testers=== Also some advanced PAT testers have the capability of downloading the information to a pc or laptop for recordings (examples are shown below left and right). Bluetooth enabled computerised PAT testers make the two way transfer of test data between the tester and PC-based record keeping systems much simpler. [[Image:Computerised PAT testing.jpg|thumb|left]] In addition, PAT testers equipped with Bluetooth means that connectivity with other test accessories such as label printers can also be made without having to use cable connection (an example of a handheld computerised PAT tester is shown below)[[Image:PAT Test.jpg|thumb|right]] == Calibration of PAT Testers == As PAT Testers are sophisticated instruments, it is important to make sure that they are continuing to measure correctly. If a company fails to check and maintain calibration, it could face difficulty substantiating any measurements in the event of a claim. It is usually recommended that calibration is carried out annually on a PAT testing unit. When a PAT Tester is calibrated it is re-configuring it to match the original specification. This includes: *Calibrating the unit back to National Standards. This is best performed by the product manufacturer (if they offer a calibration service) or a laboratory accredited by UKAS <ref>[http://www.ukas.com/ The United Kingdom Accreditation Service]</ref> *If it is mains powered, then a safety test must be carried out. *A calibration certificate should be issued to prove the PAT unit has been electrically tested. Dual purpose checkboxes have also been introduced which are capable of validating the accuracy of both electrical installation testers and portable appliance testers. ==See also== * [[Test and tagging]] ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.theiet.org/publishing/books/wir-reg/cop.cfm IET/IEE Code of Practice for In-Service Inspection and Testing of Electrical Equipment] *[http://www.hse.gov.uk/electricity/maintenance/safety.htm HSE Maintaining electrical equipment safety] *[http://www.cadfacilities.com/Recommended_Intervals.pdf Recommended Frequency of Inspections and Testing based on the IEE code of practice.] [[Category:Electrical safety]] [[Category:Occupational safety and health]] [[Category:Safety engineering]] [[Category:Electrical engineering]]</text> </page> <page> <id>28005</id> <title>PC-LISP</title> <text>'''PC-LISP''' is an implementation of the [[Franz Lisp]] dialect for [[DOS]] by Peter Ashwood-Smith. Version 2.11 was released on May 15, 1986. It can still be found on old [[abandonware]] and [[shareware]] download sites. Ashwood-Smith says of his interpreter: "PC-LISP is a small implementation of LISP for ANY MS-DOS machine. While small, it is capable of running a pretty good subset of Franz LISP."<ref>from the distribution's readme file</ref> Note that the Franz LISP dialect was the immediate, portable successor to the [[ITS]] version of [[Maclisp]] and is perhaps the closest thing to the LISP in the [[Steven Levy]] book ''[[Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution|Hackers]]''
