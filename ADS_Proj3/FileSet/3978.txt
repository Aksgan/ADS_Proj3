which can be described in terms of the various types of separated sets. As an example, we will define the T<sub>2</sub> axiom, which is the condition imposed on separated spaces. Specifically, a topological space is ''separated'' if, given any two [[distinct]] points ''x'' and ''y'', the singleton sets {''x''} and {''y''} are separated by neighbourhoods. Separated spaces are also called ''Hausdorff spaces'' or ''T<sub>2</sub> spaces''. Further discussion of separated spaces may be found in the article [[Hausdorff space]]. General discussion of the various separation axioms is in the article [[Separation axiom]]. == Relation to connected spaces == Given a topological space ''X'', it is sometimes useful to consider whether it is possible for a subset ''A'' to be separated from its [[complement (set theory)|complement]]. This is certainly true if ''A'' is either the empty set or the entire space ''X'', but there may be other possibilities. A topological space ''X'' is ''connected'' if these are the only two possibilities. Conversely, if a nonempty subset ''A'' is separated from its own complement, and if the only [[subset]] of ''A'' to share this property is the empty set, then ''A'' is an ''open-connected component'' of ''X''. (In the degenerate case where ''X'' is itself the [[empty set]] {}, authorities differ on whether {} is connected and whether {} is an open-connected component of itself.) For more on connected spaces, see [[Connected space]]. == Relation to topologically distinguishable points == Given a topological space ''X'', two points ''x'' and ''y'' are ''topologically distinguishable'' if there exists an [[open set]] that one point belongs to but the other point does not. If ''x'' and ''y'' are topologically distinguishable, then the [[singleton set]]s {''x''} and {''y''} must be disjoint. On the other hand, if the singletons {''x''} and {''y''} are separated, then the points ''x'' and ''y'' must be topologically distinguishable. Thus for singletons, topological distinguishability is a condition in between disjointness and separatedness. For more about topologically distinguishable points, see [[Topological distinguishability]]. == Sources == * Stephen Willard, ''General Topology'', Addison-Wesley, 1970.

The first sequent calculi, systems '''LK''' and '''LJ''', were introduced by [[Gerhard Gentzen]] in 1934 as a tool for studying [[natural deduction]] in [[first-order logic]] (in [[Classical logic|classical]] and [[Intuitionistic logic|intuitionistic]] versions, respectively). Gentzen's so-called "Main Theorem" (''Hauptsatz'') about LK and LJ was the [[cut-elimination theorem]], a result with far-reaching [[Metatheory|meta-theoretic]] consequences, including [[consistency]]. Gentzen further demonstrated the power and flexibility of this technique a few years later, applying a cut-elimination argument to give a (transfinite) [[Gentzen's consistency proof|proof of the consistency of Peano arithmetic]], in surprising response to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]]. Since this early work, sequent calculi (also called '''Gentzen systems''') and the general concepts relating to them have been widely applied in the fields of proof theory, mathematical logic, and [[automated deduction]]. ==Introduction== One way to classify different styles of deduction systems is to look at the form of ''[[Judgment (mathematical logic)|judgments]]'' in the system, ''i.e.'', which things may appear as the conclusion of a (sub)proof. The simplest judgment form is used in [[Hilbert-style deduction system]]s, where a judgment has the form :<math>B\,</math> where <math>B</math> is any formula of first-order-logic (or whatever logic the deduction system applies to, ''e.g.'', [[propositional calculus]] or a [[higher-order logic]] or a [[modal logic]]). The theorems are those formulae that appear as the concluding judgment in a valid proof. A Hilbert-style system needs no distinction between formulae and judgments; we make one here solely for comparison with the cases that follow. The price paid for the simple syntax of a Hilbert-style system is that complete formal proofs tend to get extremely long. Concrete arguments about proofs in such a system almost always appeal to the [[deduction theorem]]. This leads to the idea of including the deduction theorem as a formal rule in the system, which happens in [[natural deduction]]. In natural deduction, judgments have the shape :<math>A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n \vdash B</math> where the <math>A_i</math>'s and <math>B</math> are again formulae and <math>n\geq 0</math>. In words, a judgment consists of a list (possibly empty) of formulae on the left-hand side of a [[turnstile (symbol)|turnstile]] symbol "<math>\vdash</math>", with a single formula on the right-hand side. The theorems are those formulae <math>B</math> such that <math>\vdash B</math> (with an empty left-hand side) is the conclusion of a valid proof. (In some presentations of natural deduction, the <math>A_i</math>'s and the turnstile are not written down explicitly; instead a two-dimensional notation from which they can be inferred is used). The standard semantics of a judgment in natural deduction is that it asserts that whenever<ref>Here, "whenever" is used as an informal abbreviation "for every assignment of values to the free variables in the judgment"</ref> <math>A_1</math>, <math>A_2</math>, etc., are all true, <math>B</math> will also be true. The judgments : <math>A_1, \ldots, A_n \vdash B \quad\mbox{and}\quad \vdash (A_1 \land \cdots \land A_n) \rightarrow B</math> are equivalent in the strong sense that a proof of either one may be extended to a proof of the other. Finally, ''sequent calculus'' generalizes the form of a natural deduction judgment to : <math>A_1, \ldots, A_n \vdash B_1, \ldots, B_k,</math> a syntactic object called a '''[[sequent]]'''. Again, <math>A_i</math> and <math>B_i</math> are formulae, and <math>n</math> and <math>k</math> are nonnegative integers, that is, the left-hand-side or the right-hand-side (or neither or both) may be empty. As in natural deduction, theorems are those <math>B</math> where <math>\vdash B</math> is the conclusion of a valid proof. The standard semantics of a sequent is an assertion that whenever ''all'' of the <math>A_i</math>'s is true, ''at least one'' of the <math>B_i</math> will also be true. One way to express this is that a comma to the left of the turnstile should be thought of as an "and", and a comma to the right of the turnstile
