also known as Global Illumination, is a method which attempts to simulate the way in which directly illuminated surfaces act as indirect light sources that illuminate other surfaces. This produces more realistic shading and seems to better capture the '[[ambient light|ambience]]' of an indoor scene. A classic example is the way that shadows 'hug' the corners of rooms. ;Ray tracing :[[Ray tracing (graphics)|Ray tracing]] is an extension of the same technique developed in scanline rendering and ray casting. Like those, it handles complicated objects well, and the objects may be described mathematically. Unlike scanline and casting, ray tracing is almost always a Monte Carlo technique, that is one based on averaging a number of randomly generated samples from a model. === Volume rendering === [[Volume rendering]] is a technique used to display a 2D projection of a 3D discretely [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampled]] [[data set]]. A typical 3D data set is a group of 2D slice images acquired by a [[computed axial tomography|CT]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scanner. Usually these are acquired in a regular pattern (e.g., one slice every millimeter) and usually have a regular number of image [[pixel]]s in a regular pattern. This is an example of a regular volumetric grid, with each volume element, or [[voxel]] represented by a single value that is obtained by sampling the immediate area surrounding the voxel. === Volume visualization === According to [[Lawrence J. Rosenblum|Rosenblum]] (1994) "volume visualization examines a set of techniques that allows viewing an object without mathematical representing the other surface. Initially used in [[medical imaging]], volume visualization has become an essential technique for many sciences, portraying phenomena become an essential technique such as clouds, water flows, and molecular and biological structure. Many volume visualization algorithms are computationally expensive and demand large data storage. Advances in hardware and software are generalizing volume visualization as well as real time performances".<ref name="LR94"/> == Scientific visualization applications == This section will give a series of examples how scientific visualization can be applied today.<ref>All examples both images and text here, unless another source is given, are from the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL), from the [http://www.llnl.gov/visit/gallery_02.html LLNL website], Retrieved 10â€“11 July 2008.</ref> === In the natural sciences === :<gallery> Image:Star formation.jpg|''Star formation''<ref>The data used to make this image were provided by Tom Abel Ph.D. and Matthew Turk of the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology.</ref> Image:Gravitywaves.JPG|''Gravity waves''<ref>[http://www.anl.gov/Media_Center/logos20-2/globus01.htm BLACK-HOLE COLLISIONS] The Globus software creators Ian Foster, Carl Kesselman and Steve Tuecke.

Regions of high density are white while less dense regions are more blue and also more transparent. ''Gravity waves'': Researchers used the Globus Toolkit to harness the power of multiple supercomputers to simulate the gravitational effects of black-hole collisions. ''Massive Star Supernovae Explosions'': In the image three Dimensional Radiation Hydrodynamics Calculations of Massive Star Supernovae Explosions The DJEHUTY stellar evolution code was used to calculate the explosion of SN 1987A model in three dimensions. ''Molecular rendering'': [[VisIt]]'s general plotting capabilities were used to create the molecular rendering shown in the featured visualization. The original data was taken from the Protein Data Bank and turned into a VTK file before rendering. === In geography and ecology === :<gallery> Image:Terrain rendering.jpg|''Terrain rendering'' Image:Climate visualization.jpg|''Climate visualization''<ref>Image courtesy of Forrest Hoffman and Jamison Daniel of Oak Ridge National Laboratory</ref> Image:Atmospheric Anomaly in Times Square.jpg|''Atmospheric Anomaly in Times Square'' </gallery> ''Terrain rendering'': [[VisIt]] can read several file formats common in the field of [[Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS), allowing one to plot raster data such as terrain data in visualizations. The featured image shows a plot of a DEM dataset containing mountainous areas near Dunsmuir, CA. Elevation lines are added to the plot to help delineate changes in elevation. ''Tornado Simulation'': This image was created from data generated by a tornado simulation calculated on NCSA's IBM p690 computing cluster. High-definition television animations of the storm produced at NCSA were included in an episode of the PBS television series NOVA called "Hunt for the Supertwister." The tornado is shown by spheres that are colored according to pressure; orange and blue tubes represent the rising and falling airflow around the tornado. ''Climate visualization'': This visualization depicts the carbon dioxide from various sources that are advected individually as tracers in the atmosphere model. Carbon dioxide from the ocean is shown as plumes during February 1900. ''Atmospheric Anomaly in Times Square'' In the image the results from the SAMRAI simulation framework of an atmospheric anomaly in and around Times Square are visualized. === In the formal sciences === :<gallery> Image:Curve plots.jpg|''Curve plots'' Image:Image annotations.jpg|''Image annotations'' Image:Scatter plot.jpg|''Scatter plot'' </gallery> ''Computer mapping of topographical surfaces'': Through computer mapping of topographical surfaces, mathematicians can test theories of how materials will change when stressed. The imaging is part of the work on the NSF-funded Electronic Visualization Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago ''Curve plots'': VisIt can plot curves from data read from files and it can be used to extract and plot curve data from higher dimensional datasets using lineout operators or queries. The curves in the featured image correspond to elevation data along lines drawn on DEM data and were created with the feature lineout capability. Lineout allows you to interactively draw a line, which specifies a path for data extraction. The resulting data was then plotted as curves. ''Image annotations'': The featured plot shows Leaf Area Index (LAI), a measure of global vegetative matter, from a NetCDF dataset. The primary plot is the large plot at the bottom, which shows the LAI for the whole world. The plots on top are actually annotations that contain images generated earlier. Image annotations can be used to include material that enhances a visualization such as auxiliary plots, images of experimental data, project logos, etc. ''Scatter plot'': VisIt's Scatter plot allows to visualize multivariate data of up to four
