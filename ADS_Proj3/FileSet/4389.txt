these eight tetracubes (suppose each piece consists of 4 cubes, L and J are the same, Z and S are the same) can fit in a 4&times;4&times;2 or 8&times;2&times;2 box. The following is one of the solutions. D, S and B represent right screw, left screw and branch point, respectively: 4&times;4&times;2 box<br> <pre>layer 1 : layer 2 S T T T : S Z Z B S S T B : Z Z B B O O L D : L L L D O O D D : I I I I </pre> 8&times;2&times;2 box <pre> layer 1 : layer 2 D Z Z L O T T T : D L L L O B S S D D Z Z O B T S : I I I I O B B S </pre> If chiral pairs (D and S) are considered as identical, remaining 7 pieces can fill 7&times;2&times;2 box.

Modified versions with additional display modes and registers were used in the [[Sega Master System]], [[Sega Game Gear]], and the [[Mega Drive]]. (Note that the Mega Drive VDP cannot access any of the TMS9918 display modes discussed below.) There are several variants called TMS9918A, TMS9928A and TMS9929A, where the 'A' indicates a second version of the chip which added new features, most prominently the addition of a [[bitmap]] mode (Graphic II). The non-A version was only used in the TI-99/4; the TI-99/4A and the other computers had the A version VDC. The TMS9918A and TMS9928A output a 60Hz video signal, while the TMS9929A outputs 50Hz. The difference between '1' and the '2' in 'TMS9918A' and 'TMS9928A' is that the '1' version outputs [[composite video|composite]] [[NTSC]] video, while the '2' versions (including the TMS9929A) outputs [[YPbPr]], more precisely the Y, R-Y and B-Y colour differences ([[luma (video)|luminance]] and colour difference signals). The need for the latter was predominant in the 50Hz world, including Europe, due to the different video signal standards [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]]. It was more cost-effective to output Y, R-Y and B-Y and encode them into PAL or SECAM in the [[RF modulator]], than to try and have a different console for every different color standard. All of the ICs in this family are usually referred to by the TMS9918 name, sometimes with an 'A' postfix. Texas Instruments' TMS9918A was succeeded by Yamaha's [[Yamaha V9938|V9938]], which added additional bitmap modes, more colorful [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], a vertical scroll register and a customizable [[palette (computing)|palette]]. The V9938 was used in a third-party upgrade to the TI-99/4A — the [[Geneve 9640]] 'computer-on-a-card'. The V9938, in turn, was succeeded by the [[Yamaha V9958|V9958]], which added some additional high-colour modes and a horizontal scroll register. These chips were used in the "TIM" upgrade card for the TI-99/4A, as well as on the MSX 2 and MSX 2+/turboR systems, although rumor has it that the V9958 was also used in a generation of the Photo Play arcades. Yamaha also produced a [[Yamaha V9990|V9990]], which is considered the follow-up of the V9958 by some, but it is not backwards compatible. A graphic chip extension utilizing the V9990 exists for the MSX in the form of the 'Graphics9000' cartridge by [http://www.msx.ch/ Sunrise]. A later variant of the TMS9918 series chips, the TMS9118, TMS9128, and TMS9129, were released in the mid-late 1980s, but were never very popular. The function of one pin is changed, and a different mapping of the 16k x 8 bit block of video memory is supported. Otherwise the chips are completely identical to the TMS9918A, TMS9928A and TMS9929A respectively. ==Interface== The TMS9918 has its own 16k x 8 bit block of video memory, outside the address space of the [[Central processing unit|CPU]]. This memory is not mapped onto the CPU memory space - the VDC's data memory bus is a private (although external) bus, separated from that of the CPU. A separate addressing space means that the CPU has to write a two-byte command word to the VDC's control port to set the address register, but it also means that the VDC doesn't slow the main processor down when it reads data out of its memory, and since the memory is not mapped onto the CPU's addressing space, there is more address space available for other memory and memory-mapped hardware. The CPU communicates with the VDC through an additional 8-bit port on the VDC, and data is transferred between the two via port writes. As a byte is written, the TMS9918 increments its internal address register - this is important, because the CPU does not have to send an address update for every byte access. This facilitates quicker reads and writes of blocks of data. Writes to other ports can set various internal registers. ==Screen modes== There are 4 different screen modes available in the TMS9918A (as mentioned before, the TMS9918 lacks mode Graphic II): '''Mode 0 (Text):''' 40×24 characters monochrome. As the display is 256 pixels width, the character set is only 6 pixels wide. This mode doesn't support sprites. '''Mode 1 (Graphic 1):''' 32×24 characters. Each 8 characters in the character set has a foreground and background color. The chars "0"-"7" for
