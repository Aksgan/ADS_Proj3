Edward Salek, Executive Director | industry = Tribology and Lubrication Engineering | homepage = www.stle.org }} [http://www.stle.org The Society of Tribologists and Lubrication Engineers] or "STLE" is the premier technical society that serves the needs of more than 10,000 individuals and 150 companies and organizations that comprise the tribology and lubrication engineering business sector, bringing together managers, engineers, scientists, technicians, academics, and government institutions from around the world to learn and share the “best practices” for the [[tribology]] and [[lubrication]] fields. This professional organization's stated mission is to advance the science of tribology and the practice of lubrication engineering in order to foster innovation, improve the performance of equipment and products, conserve resources and protect the environment. Its stated vision is to be a leader in the global network of individuals, institutions, societies and corporate entities with a common interest in advancing the science of tribology and the practice of lubrication engineering. This international and interdisciplinary society operates from its {{convert|9000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. headquarters building located in Park Ridge, Illinois, a suburb located fifteen miles (24 km) northwest of downtown Chicago, where staff focus on areas of membership, certification, technical information and training, and publications to better support its members who influence the worldwide communities affected by tribology and lubricants. ==History== STLE is an individual membership society focusing on professional, technical and scientific issues and needs. It was founded on March 3, 1944, in Chicago as the American Society of Lubrication Engineers (ASLE). From these early days, into the 1980s, the organization’s primary audience was plant engineers in charge of lubrication for production equipment at major facilities like auto plans or steel mills. Major activities were technical conferences, peer-reviewed publishing and educational activities. To adapt and reflect evolving market and audience needs, the organization’s membership voted in 1987 to change the name to Society of Tribologists and Lubrication Engineers (STLE). This acknowledged a growing international participation and appealed to a more diverse audience that encompassed many aspects of engineering and tribology, as well as the traditional base of lubrication engineers and suppliers of liquid lubricants. Creation and dissemination of reliable technical information, STLE’s strength for 65 years, will continue defining the organization’s purpose and value in the future. As the world searches for solutions to environmental and energy challenges, many of which are tied to the fundamentals of tribology and lubricants, STLE stands ready to be the trusted source of information for an expanding audience of people looking for answers to these challenges. ==Organization== STLE is incorporated in the State of Illinois. Structure and governance procedures are defined in a Constitution and Bylaws, which have recently been updated and revised. In addition, a strategic plan directs the ongoing activities of the Society. Annual budget is approximately $2.25 million. STLE’s elected leadership is provided by a 24-member Board of Directors. The President, who serves a one-year term, is the organization’s chief elected officer and the chairman of the Board of Directors. Complementing and extending the work of the Board is an impressive volunteer network that includes hundreds of individuals serving in a variety of ways. This might include participation in one of 23 technical committees and councils, an administrative committee, serving as an associate editor or reviewer for a Society journal or local Section activity. Working in concert with the elected leadership and volunteers is a 9-person professional staff who work out of its headquarters in Park Ridge. In its entirety, the STLE staff have combined experience of more than 100 years in association and organization management. STLE is recognized by the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3)non-profit organization. ==Membership== [http://www.stle.org/join/benefits.aspx? Membership] in the STLE is open to anyone involved with tribology and lubrication issues, especially as they apply to industrial production and who want to acknowledge their professionalism and focus in these fields. There are 4 ways for an individual to become a member of the STLE; corporate membership, regular membership, associate membership, and student membership. '''Corporate membership''' provides opportunities for industry to stay at the forefront of their field. Included in this membership is the membership magazine TLT, plus online access to the full archives of Tribology Transactions and Tribology Letters. Also included are two free admissions to the annual meeting including two education courses. Corporate members receive discounts on exhibit booth space and Commercial Marketing Forum registrations, and are listed in the STLE Online Corporate Member Directory. '''Regular membership''' is available to the technical individual with an engineering or science degree or equivalent experience. Membership carries voting privileges and leadership opportunities on both the national and local levels, such as involvement in various committees through the organization or one of the local sections. '''Associate membership''' is open regardless of experience or educational background to anyone with an interest in lubrication engineering. Associate membership carries voting privileges and leadership opportunities on the local level, such as a local section of the STLE organization. '''Student membership''' is available for interested students studying in one of the education fields of lubrication engineering at a collegiate level, whether they be undergraduate or graduate and offers discounts for various STLE events, such as registration to the Annual Meeting or International Joint Tribology conferences each year. ==Publications== STLE's magazine "Tribology & Lubrication Technology" or TLT and its two scholarly journals, "Tribology Transactions" and "Tribology Letters" are respected sources for reliable technical and scientific information and peer-reviewed research papers, known throughout the tribology and lubrication industries. On top of these significant publications, STLE also offers a [http://www.stle.org/research/update/default.aspx? monthly e-newsletter] that can be accessed on the organization's website. '''[http://www.stle.org/research/membership/default.aspx? Tribology & Lubrication Technology]''' is the official monthly magazine of STLE and is provided free as part of STLE membership. TLT was created to aid in the technical education and professional development of STLE members and industry colleagues. Each issue is filled with feature articles, case studies, best practice analysis, industry surveys, interviews with leading professionals, resources, lubrication fundamentals and more. TLT published its first issue in October 2003 and in June 2009 [http://onlinedigitalpublishing.com/publication/?m=5716&l=1 the magazine went digital],
