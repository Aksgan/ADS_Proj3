the mass of an object, a material's characteristic, or maybe the discharging time of a capacitor), but each value will be ''calculated'' using two different methods and/or theories. Emphasis must be made on the word ''calculated'', because the most important requirement for the two values that are being compared using percent difference is that they had needed to be calculated indirectly of measurement of the objective value. In other words, neither of the two values can be the actual or accepted value of the objective value. The two values are determined using theories and measurements that are to be tested with respect to an accepted value by the scientific community. Example is someone measuring the length and period of a pendulum to determine the acceleration of gravity, but must relate the value to the accepted value of gravity by the scientific community. Percent difference is similar to another comparison technique called [[percent error]], which is when one determines an experimental value and is comparing it to the accepted or actual value. Percent difference is ''different'' in that neither of the two values are the accepted or actual value; they are both an experimental value determined by two different techniques but describing the same objective value. ==Formula== The percent difference of two experimental values, ''x''<sub>1</sub> and ''x''<sub>2</sub>, can be calculated by dividing the [[absolute difference]] of the two values by the [[average value]] of the same two values as shown in the equation below: : <math>%\text{ Diff} = \left|\frac{x_1-x_2}{(x_1+x_2)/2}\right|\times100 </math>. Both values (''x''<sub>1</sub> and ''x''<sub>2</sub>) must contain the same units in order to be compared correctly with one another. And as mentioned before, a zero percent difference is optimum and the higher the percent value, the less precision of the two values. As the values are the result of an experiment, this formula has the advantage that if one of the values is zero, the result is still valid. The formula for percent error cannot be computed if the theoretical value _is_ zero. One final note to make is that a lot of confusion lies in mistakenly assuming that percent difference is the same as [[percent error]]. The difference is that percent difference is comparing two experimental values, whereas [[percent error]] compares one experimental value with the actual/accepted value. ==Percent error== The general standard of calculating the [[percent error]] involves using the [[absolute difference]] of the experimental (measured) and theoretical (accepted) values. Then take the difference and divide it by the theoretical (accepted) value to get percent error, : <math>%\text{ Error} = \frac{|\text{Experimental}-\text{Theoretical}|}{\text{Theoretical}}\times100</math>. The terms "Experimental" and "Theoretical" used in the equation above are commonly replaced with other similar terms. Other terms used for "experimental" could be measured or calculated and other terms used for "theoretical" could be actual or accepted. Either way, don't let the varying word choices confuse value assignment in the equation. Experimental value is what someone derived by use of calculation and measurement and would like to test its accuracy with the theoretical value, a value that is accepted by a scientific community or a value that could be seen as a goal for a successful result. By using absolute functions in the percent error equation, we understand that the solution will always be a positive percent value. However, in the academic arena, it can be beneficial to remove the absolute function so as to provide more information to the result. Therefore, if a experimental value is less than the theoretical value, the percent error will be negative. This negative result lets the author and reader know more information about the experimental result. For example, experimentally calculating the speed of light and coming up with a negative percent error tells us that the experimental value is a velocity that is less than the speed of light. This is a big difference to getting a positive percent error, which means the experimental value is a velocity that is greater than the speed of light (violating the [[theory of relativity]]). So rewriting the percent error equation by removing the absolute function, we have, : <math>%\text{ Error} = \frac{\text{Experimental}-\text{Theoretical}}{\text{Theoretical}}\times100.</math> Without the use of the absolute function, it's important to note that the two values in the [[numerator]] are not [[commutative]] due to the use of subtraction without the absolute function. Therefore, it must remain as shown above: subtract the theoretical value from the experimental value and not vice versa. ==References== * {{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Understanding Measurement and Graphing | work = | publisher = [[North Carolina State University]] | date = 2008-08-20 | url = http://www.physics.ncsu.edu/courses/pylabs/205N_208N_MeasurementandErrors.pdf | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2010-05-05 }} * {{cite web | last = Hester | first = Jerry | coauthors = | title = Physics Tutorial: %Error and %Difference | work = | publisher = Clemson University | date = 2006-01-27 | url = http://phoenix.phys.clemson.edu/tutorials/error/index.html | doi = | accessdate = 2010-05-05 }} * {{cite web | title = Percent Difference &ndash; Percent Error | work = | publisher = Illinois State University, Dept of Physics | date = 2004-07-20 | url = http://www.phy.ilstu.edu/slh/Percent%20Difference%20Error.pdf | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2010-05-05 }} ==See also== *[[Approximation error]] *[[Errors and residuals in statistics]] *[[Percentage change]] *[[Relative difference]] *[[Coefficient of variation]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Percent Difference}} [[Category:Measurement]] [[Category:Numerical analysis]] [[Category:Statistics]]</text> </page> <page> <id>28792</id> <title>Perceptual Computing</title> <text>{{Userspace draft|source=ArticleWizard|date=January 2010}} '''Perceptual Computing''' is ''methodology'' for assisting people to make subjective judgments. It is closely related to Prof. [[Lotfi A. Zadeh]]'s [[Computing with words and perceptions|''computing with words'']] paradigm. ==Perceptual Computer== The ''Perceptual Computer'' — ''Per-C'' — an instantiation of perceptual computing — has the architecture that is depicted in Fig. 1 [2]-[6]. It consists of three components: encoder, CWW engine and decoder. Perceptions — words — activate the Per-C and are the Per-C output (along with data); so, it is possible for a human to interact with the Per-C using just a vocabulary. [[File:PerC.jpg|below|Figure 1.
