and have the *.wrl [[filename extension|extension]] (for example island.wrl). Although VRML worlds use a text format, they may often be compressed using [[gzip]] so that they transfer over the internet more quickly (some gzip compressed files use the *.wrz [[filename extension|extension]]). Many [[3D computer graphics software|3D modeling programs]] can save [[object (image processing)|object]]s and [[scene]]s in VRML format. ==Standardization== The [[Web3D Consortium]] has been formed to further the collective development of the format. VRML (and its successor, [[X3D]]), have been accepted as international standards by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO). The first version of VRML was specified in November 1994. This version was specified from, and very closely resembled, the [[Application Programming Interface|API]] and [[file format]] of the [[Open Inventor]] [[software component]], originally developed by [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]]. The current and functionally complete version is VRML97 (ISO/IEC 14772-1:1997). VRML has now been superseded by [[X3D]] (ISO/IEC 19775-1) ==Emergence, popularity, and rival technical upgrade== The term VRML was coined by [[Dave Raggett]] in a paper submitted to the [[World Wide Web Conference 1|First World Wide Web Conference]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www94.web.cern.ch/WWW94/ |title=First World Wide Web Conference |publisher=4.web.cern.ch |date= |accessdate=2010-02-23}}</ref> in 1994, and first discussed at the WWW94 VRML BOF established by [[Tim Berners-Lee]], where [[Mark Pesce]] presented the Labyrinth demo he developed with [[Tony Parisi (software developer)|Tony Parisi]]<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080302070914/http://mediamachines.com/management.php Media Machines Management]</ref> and [[Peter Kennard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livingwork.com/peterk/ |title=Peter Kennard's page |publisher=Livingwork.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-23}}</ref> In 1997, a new version of the format was finalized, as VRML97 (also known as VRML2 or VRML 2.0), and became an [[ISO]] standard. VRML97 was used on the Internet on some personal homepages and sites such as "CyberTown", which offered 3D chat using Blaxxun Software. The format was championed by SGI's Cosmo Software; when SGI restructured in 1998 the division was sold to Platinum Technologies, which was then taken over by [[Computer Associates]], which did not develop or distribute the software. To fill the void a variety of proprietary Web 3D formats emerged over the next few years, including [[Microsoft Chrome]] and [[Adobe Atmosphere]], neither of which is supported today. VRML's capabilities remained largely the same while realtime 3D graphics kept improving. The VRML Consortium changed its name to the [[Web3D Consortium]], and began work on the successor to VRMLâ€”[[X3D]]. SGI ran a web site at vrml.sgi.com on which was hosted a string of regular short performances of a character called "Floops" who was a VRML character in a VRML world. Floops was a creation of a company called "Protozoa".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biota.org/book/chbi/chbi2.htm |title=Floops general narrative |publisher=Biota.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspace.com/avatars/book/authorp/floplate.jpg |title=Floops in his first episode |date= |accessdate=2010-02-23}}</ref> H-Anim is a standard for animated Humanoids, which is based around VRML, and later X3D. The initial version 1.0 of the H-Anim standard was scheduled for submission at the end of March 1998. VRML provoked much interest but has never seen much serious widespread use.<ref>{{cite web |author=[[David Sabine]] |url=http://www.virb.com/DavidSabine/posts/text/3658075 |title=What is (was) VRML?}}</ref> One reason for this may have been the lack of available [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]]. At the time of VRML's popularity, a majority of users, both business and personal, were using slow [[dial-up internet access]]. This had the unfortunate side effect of having users wait for extended periods of time only to find a blocky, ill-lit room with distorted text hanging in seemingly random locations. VRML experimentation was primarily in education and research where an open specification is most valued. It has now been re-engineered as [[X3D]]. The [[MPEG-4]] Interactive Profile (ISO/IEC 14496) was based on VRML (now on X3D), and X3D is largely backward-compatible with it. VRML is also widely used as a file format for interchange of 3D models, particularly from [[CAD]] systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-matters43/index.html |title=XML Matters |publisher=Ibm.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-23}}</ref> A free cross-platform runtime implementation of VRML is available in [[OpenVRML]]. Its libraries can be used to add both VRML and X3D support to applications, and a GTK+ plugin is available to render VRML/X3D worlds in web browsers. In a September 17, 1998 [[Computergram International]] essay, "''VRML Versus Chromeffects: Microsoft Replies''", [[Rachel Chalmers]] sharply criticized VRML as having "no integration with HTML", whereas "[[ChromEffects]] is based on 56 multimedia XML tags".<ref>[[Rachel Chalmers]]: [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CGN/is_3497/ai_n27545305/ VRML Versus Chromeffects: Microsoft Replies] (BNET)</ref><ref>[[Rachel Chalmers]]: [http://www.cbronline.com/news/vrml_versus_chromeffects_microsoft_replies VRML Versus Chromeffects: Microsoft Replies] (CBR)</ref> She did not criticize [[X3D]] (though extended from VRML as well as XML), because [[X3D]] already had this integration. However, VRML survived Chromeffects, canceled in November 1998.<ref>[http://news.com.com/2100-1001-213566.html Microsoft Debuts Chromeffects]; [http://news.com.com/Microsoft+shelves+Chromeffects/2100-1023_3-217885.html?tag=st.rc.targ_mb Microsoft Shelves Chromeffects]</ref> In the 2000s, many companies like Bitmanagement improved the quality level of virtual effects in VRML to the quality level of [[DirectX]] 9.0c, but at the expense of using proprietary solutions. All main features like game modeling are already complete.
