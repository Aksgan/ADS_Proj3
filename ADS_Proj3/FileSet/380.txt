Hilarides (1691)]] '''Balthasar Bekker''' (20 March 1634 – 11 June 1698), Dutch divine and author of philosophical and theological works. Opposing [[superstition]], he was a key figure in the end of the [[witchcraft]] persecutions in [[early modern Europe]]. ==Life== Bekker was born in [[Metslawier]] ([[Dongeradeel]]) as the son of a German pastor from [[Bielefeld]]. He was educated at [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], under [[Jacob Alting]], and at [[Franeker]]. Becoming the rector of the local [[Latin school]], he was appointed to his satisfaction in 1657 as a pastor in Oosterlittens ([[Littenseradiel]]), and started as one of the first to preach on Sunday afternoon. An enthusiastic disciple of [[René Descartes|Descartes]], he wrote several works in philosophy and theology, which by their freedom of thought aroused considerable hostility. In his book ''De Philosophia Cartesiana'' Bekker argued that theology and philosophy each had their separate terrain and that Nature can no more be explained through Scripture than can theological truth be deduced from Nature.<ref>Jonathan I. Israel (1995) The Dutch Republic. Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall, 1477-1806, p. 895.</ref> From 1679 he worked in [[Amsterdam]], after being driven from [[Friesland]]. In 1683 he traveled to England and France. In two months time Bekker visited London, Cambridge, Oxford, Paris and [[Leuven]], with a great interest in the art of [[fortification]].<ref>Bekker, Balthasar (1998) Beschrijving van de reis door de Verenigde Nederlanden, Engeland en Frankrijk in het jaar 1683. [[Fryske Akademy]].</ref> His best known work was ''Die Betooverde Wereld'' (1691), or ''The World Bewitched'' (1695), in which he examined critically the phenomena generally ascribed to spiritual agency. He attacked the belief in sorcery and [[demonic possession|"possession" by the devil]]. Indeed he questioned the devil's very existence. The book had a sensational effect and was one of the key works of the Early [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Europe. It was almost certainly the most controversial.<ref>Jonathan I.

He was tried for blasphemy, maligning the public Church, and spreading atheistic ideas about Scripture. Some towns banned the book, but Amsterdam and the States of Holland never did, continuing his salary, without formally stripping him of his post.<ref>Jonathan I. Israel (1995) The Dutch Republic, p. 930</ref> He died in Amsterdam. In July 1698 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] of London. <ref> {{cite web | url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=0&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27bekker%27%29| title= Library and Archive Catalogue| publisher= Royal Society|accessdate= 12 December 2010}} </ref> == Works == [[File:Bekker - Betoverde weereld.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Cover of ''De betoverde weereld'']] * De philosophia Cartesiana admonitio candida & sincera.

Most commonly used to teach younger students with little or no experience in programming. The difference between Baltie and other programming languages is that Baltie uses icons instead of written text, though in Baltie 4, C# text commands are allowed. ==Baltie's history== Icon languages Baltie 2 and Baltie 3 were developed by [[Czech Republic|Czech]] company [[SGP Systems]] in 1996 and next version in 1999 from the language called Baltazar (1993) and are based on the [[C (programming language)|C]] language. Baltie 4 C# is already based on [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] ===Baltie 2=== Baltie 2 was the first publicly shipped version. Ran on [[Microsoft DOS]] 5.0 and allows users to build their programs using icon commands. The environment was very limited and targeted only for very young children (3+ years).
