of the [[Intel 80486|486]] market, but fell from use as less expensive systems were introduced by a host of new players in the mid-90s. Weitek attempted to re-enter at the low-end of the market with their W464 (486) and W564 (P5) systems which [[Integrated_graphics#Integrated_graphics_solutions|used the host machines]] [[Random Access Memory|RAM]] as the frame buffer to lower costs. These were one of the reasons the company was purchased by Rockwell shortly after they shipped. ==External links== *[http://www.weitek.com/ Weitek] - the original home page, cached but largely un-functional *[http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/aips/weitek.html Weitek Sparc2 Upgrade Chip] *[http://www.cpu-collection.de/?tn=1&l0=co&l1=Weitek Weitek chip images and information on cpu-collection.de] [[Category:Defunct computer companies of the United States]] [[Category:Electronics companies of the United States]] [[Category:X86 microprocessors]] [[de:Weitek]] [[es:Weitek]] [[it:Weitek]] [[ja:Weitek]] [[no:Weitek]] [[zh:Weitek]]</text> </page> <page> <id>40017</id> <title>Well-posed problem</title> <text>The [[mathematics|mathematical]] term '''well-posed problem''' stems from a definition given by [[Jacques Hadamard]]. He believed that mathematical models of physical phenomena should have the properties that # A solution exists # The solution is unique # The solution depends continuously on the data, in some reasonable [[topology]]. Examples of [[archetypal]] well-posed problems include the [[Laplace's_equation#Boundary_conditions|Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation]], and the [[heat equation]] with specified initial conditions. These might be regarded as 'natural' problems in that there are physical processes that solve these problems. By contrast the inverse heat equation, deducing a previous distribution of temperature from final data is not well-posed in that the solution is highly sensitive to changes in the final data. Problems that are not well-posed in the sense of Hadamard are termed '''ill-posed'''. [[Inverse problem]]s are often ill-posed. Such continuum problems must often be discretized in order to obtain a numerical solution. While in terms of [[functional analysis]] such problems are typically continuous, they may suffer from numerical instability when solved with finite precision, or with errors in the data. Even if a problem is well-posed, it may still be ill-conditioned, meaning that a small error in the initial data can result in much larger errors in the answers. An ill-conditioned problem is indicated by a large [[condition number]]. If the problem is well-posed, then it stands a good chance of solution on a computer using a [[numerical stability|stable algorithm]]. If it is not well-posed, it needs to be re-formulated for numerical treatment. Typically this involves including additional assumptions, such as smoothness of solution. This process is known as ''[[Regularization (mathematics)|regularization]]'' and [[Tikhonov regularization]] is one of the most commonly used for regularization of linear ill-posed problems. ==References== *{{Cite book |first=Jacques |last=Hadamard |year=1902 |title=Sur les problèmes aux dérivées partielles et leur signification physique |work=Princeton University Bulletin |pages=49–52 }} *{{Cite book |title=McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms |edition=4th |origyear=1974 |year=1989 |editor-first=Sybil B. |editor-last=Parker |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |isbn=0070452709 }} *{{Cite book |first=A.

Henry Wellcome's interest was the [[history of medicine]] in a broad sense and included subjects like [[alchemy]] or [[witchcraft]], but also [[anthropology]] and [[ethnography]]. Since Henry Wellcome’s death in 1936, the [[Wellcome Trust]] has been responsible for maintaining the Library's collection and funding its acquisitions. The Library is free and open to the public. ==History of the Library== [[Image:Liber chronicarum.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Liber chronicarum'' - more commonly known as the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]]. The book is a history chronicle, starting from the Creation, written in Latin by [[Hartmann Schedel]], a doctor from Nuremberg. It was purchased by Henry Wellcome in 1898, at the auction of the Library of William Morris.]] Henry Wellcome began collecting books seriously in the late 1890s, using a succession of agents and dealers, and by travelling around the world to gather whatever could be found. Wellcome's first major entry into the market took place at the auction of [[William Morris]]'s library in 1898, where he was the biggest single purchaser, taking away about a third of the lots. His interests were truly international and the broad coverage of languages and traditions is one of the Library's strengths. Significant collections acquired during this early period included the library of J. F. Payne, medical historian and Librarian of the Royal College of Physicians, purchased in 1911, and the major part of the library of the Munich historian Ernst Darmstaedter, bought in 1930<ref>Symons, HJM, (1993), ''The Wellcome Institute: a short history'', The Wellcome Trust, London</ref><ref>Symons, HJM, (1993), 'These crafty dealers': Sir Henry Wellcome as a book collector', in Myers, R and Harris, M (eds.) ''Medicine, mortality and the book trade'', St Paul Bibliographies, Folkestone</ref> . When Henry Wellcome died, the bulk of his estate and his collection was bequeathed to a body of trustees, who formed the [[Wellcome Trust]]. Their primary duty was to use the income generated by the company to support ongoing biomedical research, but they were also charged with fostering the study of medical history through the care and maintenance of the collections. A programme of sorting and rationalising was therefore begun, which lasted throughout the 1940s and beyond. The Library's story during the later decades of the 20th century has
