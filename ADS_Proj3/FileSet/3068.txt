The program was released by NASA on March 18, 2007, and {{as of|2010|06|lc=on}}, there have been 53 vodcasts produced. ==Description== NASA EDGE is a [[public outreach]] vodcast sponsored by NASA's Exploration Systems Mission Directorate and based out of the Exploration and Space Operations Directorate at [[Langley Research Center]] in [[Hampton]], [[Virginia]]. NASA EDGE takes an [[insider]]s look at current projects and technologies from NASA facilities around the [[United States]], and is depicted through personal interviews, on-scene broadcasts, [[computer animation]]s, and personal interviews with top scientists and engineers at NASA. The show explores the contributions NASA has made to society as well as the progress of current projects in materials and space exploration. NASA EDGE vodcasts can be downloaded from the NASA website and from [[iTunes]]. ==Cast and crew== * Chris Giersch - host * Blair Allen - co-host and senior producer<ref name="Lang_Blair">{{cite news |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/researchernews/snapshot_ballen.html |title=Center Snapshot – Blair Allen |work=The Researcher News |location=Langley Research Center |first=Denise |last=Adams |date=September 7, 2007 |accessdate=June 10, 2010}}</ref> * Franklin Fitzgerald - news anchor and "[[everyman]]" * Jaqueline Mirielle Cortez - special co-host * Ron Beard - director and "set therapist" * Don Morrison - audio/video engineer ==Reception== In its first year of production, the show was downloaded over 450,000 times. {{As of|2010|02}}, the average download rate is more than 420,000 per month, with over one million downloads in December 2009 and January 2010.<ref name="trn100211">{{cite news |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/researchernews/rn_NASAEdge10.html |title=Going Where No NASA Show Has Gone Before |work=The Researcher News |location=Langley Research Center |first=Denise |last=Lineberry |date=February 11, 2010 |accessdate=June 10, 2010}}</ref> ==Interactive projects== [[File:NASA EDGE Orion Pad Abort 1 White Sands Missile Range.jpg|thumb|200px|NASA EDGE broadcasting live from [[White Sands Missile Range]] in 2010]] NASA and the NASA EDGE have developed interactive programs designed to complement the vodcast.

There are multiple versions of this robot using various locomotion methods. Some versions of the robot use the [[Segway HT]] for locomotion [http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/robotics/2004-10-20-rise-of-robots_x.htm]. Robonaut uses [[telepresence]] and various levels of [[Autonomous robot|robotic autonomy]]. While not all human range of motion and sensitivity has been duplicated, the robot's hand has fourteen [[Degrees of freedom (engineering)|degrees of freedom]] and uses [[touch sensor]]s at the tips of its fingers.

NAT traversal techniques are typically required for [[client-to-client]] networking applications, especially [[peer-to-peer]] and [[Voice-over-IP]] ([[VoIP]]) deployments. Many techniques exist, but no single method works in every situation since NAT behavior is not standardized. Many techniques require assistance from a computer server at a publicly-routable IP address. Some methods use the server only when establishing
