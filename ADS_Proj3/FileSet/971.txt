Schumacher]] considered that the 17th century [[scientific revolution]] shifted science from a focus on understanding [[nature]], or [[wisdom]], to a focus on manipulating nature, i.e. [[power (sociology)|power]], and that science's emphasis on manipulating nature leads it inevitably to manipulate people, as well.<ref name=UW>Fritjof Capra, ''Uncommon Wisdom'', ISBN 0-671-47322-0, p. 213</ref> Science's focus on quantitative measures has led to critiques that it is unable to recognize important qualitative aspects of the world.<ref name=UW/> ==Media perspectives== The [[mass media]] face a number of pressures that can prevent them from accurately depicting competing scientific claims in terms of their credibility within the scientific community as a whole.

As a very broad generalisation, many politicians seek certainties and ''facts'' whilst scientists typically offer probabilities and caveats. However, politicians' ability to be heard in the [[mass media]] frequently distorts the scientific understanding by the public. Examples in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] include the controversy over the [[MMR vaccine|MMR inoculation]], and the 1988 forced resignation of a Government Minister, [[Edwina Currie]] for revealing the high probability that battery eggs were contaminated with ''[[Salmonella]]''.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/3/newsid_2519000/2519451.stm "1988: Egg industry fury over salmonella claim"], "On This Day," BBC News, December 3, 1988.</ref> Some scientists and philosophers suggest that scientific theories are more or less shaped by the dominant political, economic, or cultural models of the time, even though the scientific community may claim to be exempt from social influences and historical conditions.<ref>{{cite book | isbn = 9780860916468 | title = Against Method | page = 66 | publisher = Verso | last = Feyerabend | first = Paul | year = 1983 | authorlink = Paul Feyerabend}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | isbn = 0816616590 | title = Science As Power: Discourse and Ideology in Modern Society | pages = 272–273, 276 | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | last = Aronowitz | first = Stanley | year = 1988 | authorlink = Stanley Aronowitz}}</ref> For example, [[Zoologist]] [[Peter Kropotkin]] thought that the Darwinian theory of evolution overstressed a painful "we must struggle to survive" way of life, which he said was influenced by [[Capitalism]] and the struggling lifestyles people lived within it.<ref name="Anton Wilson 1999 4"/><ref>{{cite book | isbn = 140431945X | title = Mutual Aid | page = Preface to the 1914 edition | publisher = Porter Sargent | last = Kropotkin | first = Peter | year = 1955 | authorlink = Robert Anton Wilson}}</ref> Karl Marx also thought that science was largely driven by and used as capital<ref>{{cite book | isbn = 0816616590 | title = Science As Power: Discourse and Ideology in Modern Society | page = 40 | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | last = Aronowitz | first = Stanley | year = 1988 | authorlink = Stanley Aronowitz}}</ref> Robert Anton Wilson, Stanley Aronowitz, and Paul Feyerabend all thought that the [[military-industrial complex]], large [[corporation]]s, and the grants that came from them had an immense influence over the research and even results of Scientific experiments.<ref name="contra"/><ref>Wilson, Robert Anton: 1999, pg 92</ref><ref>{{cite book | isbn = 0860911845 | title = Farewell To Reason| page = 102 | publisher = Verso | last = Feyerabend | first = Paul | year = 1987 | authorlink = Paul Feyerabend}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | isbn = 0816616590 | title = Science As Power: Discourse and Ideology in Modern Society | page = 20 | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | last = Aronowitz | first = Stanley | year = 1988 | authorlink = Stanley Aronowitz}}</ref> Aronowitz even went as far as to say "It does not matter that the scientific community ritualistically denies its alliance with economic/industrial and military power.
