are allowed for these age groups only under parental guidance. But, K-12, K-14 and K-16 are not allowed even under parental guidance. The Estonian rating system is considered to be milder than in the USA and Western Europe.<ref>[http://www.forumcinemas.ee/Tickets/Ratings Forum Cinemas]{{Et icon}}</ref> ==Finland== The [[Finnish Board of Film Classification]] has a film classification system under which films are classified into one of the following categories: * '''K-3''' (formerly S) - For all ages (green sign) * '''K-7''' - Only for persons 7 years or older (yellow sign) * '''K-11''' - Only for persons 11 years or older (orange sign) * '''K-13''' - Only for persons 13 years or older (orange sign) * '''K-15''' - Only for persons 15 years or older (orange sign) * '''K-18''' - Only for persons 18 years or older (red sign) * '''K-E''' - Exempt A person two years younger than the given rating is permitted to see a film in a movie theater when accompanied by an adult, except for 18-rated films. Only material intended to be accessible to minors (those below 18 years of age) is subject to mandatory inspection. A proper notification is sufficient for adult material. However, the board has the right to inspect material suspected of violating laws or material which was not properly notified. ==France== Prior to showing in theaters, a license (visa d'exploitation) must be obtained from the [[Minister of Culture (France)|Ministry of Culture]]. Upon the advice of the commission pertaining to cinema movies, the minister decides either not to grant the license (a very rare occurrence), or to grant a license among the 6 following: *'''U''' (Tous publics) valid for all audiences; examples include [[How the Grinch Stole Christmas]], [[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]], [[The Wizard of Oz]], [[The Big Lebowski]], [[Iron Man]] and [[The Lion King]] *'''10''' (Déconseillé aux moins de 10 ans) unsuitable for children younger than 10 ''(this rating is only used for TV shows)'' *'''12''' (Interdit aux moins de 12 ans) unsuitable for children younger than 12 or forbidden in cinemas for under 12; examples include [[The Godfather]], [[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]], [[American Beauty (film)|American Beauty]], [[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]], [[Gone Baby Gone]] and [[The Sixth Sense]] *'''16''' (Interdit aux moins de 16 ans) unsuitable for children younger than 16 or forbidden in cinemas for under 16; examples include [[Fight Club]], [[The Last Exorcism]], [[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]], [[Saw]], [[Natural Born Killers]] and [[From Dusk till Dawn]] *'''18''' (Interdit aux mineurs) unsuitable for children younger than 18 or forbidden in cinemas for under 18. (extremely rare; the latest use of this rating was when the American film ''[[Saw III]]'' was released) *'''E''' exempt Each rating can be accompanied by a special "warning". In practice, the ministry always follows the decision of the commission. In addition, a movie bearing the "-18" rating may be considered "pornographic or inciting to violence" (colloquially referred to as "[[X-rated]]"). In this case, it bears high taxation and may be showed only in specific theatres, which are now rare in France. This classification is not used for merely violent movies, or movies containing mere erotic scenes. Classifications, as all administrative decisions, may be appealed before the courts (''[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'État]]'' at litigation). The movie ''[[Baise-moi|Baise-Moi]]'' went from -16 to -18 and was branded as "pornographic". ''Related link:'' [http://www.cnc.fr/Site/Template/T11.aspx?SELECTID=1288&ID=761&t=1] (in French) == Germany == The [[Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft]] (Voluntary Self-Regulation of the Film Industry, FSK) has a film classification system under which films are classified into one of the following categories: * '''Ohne Altersbeschränkung (FSK 0)''': no age restriction (white sign) * '''Freigegeben ab 6 Jahren (FSK 6)''': no children younger than 6 years admitted (yellow sign) * '''Freigegeben ab 12 Jahren (FSK 12)''': children 12 or older admitted, children between 7 and 11 only when accompanied by parent or a legal guardian (green sign) * '''Freigegeben ab 16 Jahren (FSK 16)''': children 16 or older admitted, nobody under this age admitted (blue sign) * '''Keine Jugendfreigabe (FSK 18)''': "''no youth admitted''", only adults. This rating was previously called ''"Nicht freigegeben unter 18 Jahren."'' (red sign) * '''Infoprogramm''' or '''Lehrprogramm''': "educational programming". This rating is not issued by the FSK, but may be self-applied to films seeking to educate their audience (e.g. documentaries, instructional films, etc.), provided they do not contain any material "evidently harmful to the development of children and youths".<ref>http://www.spio.de/media_content/555.pdf SPIO guidelines concerning the self-assignment of ratings (pdf, in German)</ref> Films with this rating may be sold without any age restriction. All the above ratings also contain the phrase "gemäß §14 JuSchG" (in accordance with §14 of the Youth Protection Law), signifying that they are legally binding, rather than being mere recommendations. * '''SPIO/JK''': This certificate, issued by the Spitzenorganisation der Filmwirtschaft (Head Organisation of the Film Industry, SPIO), attests that, in the eyes of the SPIO, a particular film does not violate German law, such as the ban on "glorification of violence." However, films with such a certificate may still be banned and are frequently put on the "[[Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Medien|Index]]". The certificate simply protects the producer/seller of a film that later gets indexed from prosecution, as he or she can claim that they had reason to believe the film did not, in fact, violate any laws. As films with this certificate are not rated by the FSK, they may be sold only to persons aged 18 or older. Furthermore, while a rating by the FSK is not legally required for a film to be sold, "unrated" films may be sold only to adults, and since most retail chains and virtually all cinemas will sell/show only films with an FSK rating, all films are normally submitted to the FSK for classification, with the exception of films that will most likely be refused a certificate (pornography or films containing extremely strong violence, for example). After a title has received a rating for a cinematic release, the FSK must approve this rating again for
