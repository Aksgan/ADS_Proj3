[[Durbin&ndash;Wu test]] fails), the random effects model is not [[Consistency (statistics)|consistent]]. == Quantitative description == Formally the model is :<math>y_{it}=\beta_{0}+X_{it}\beta+Z_{i}\gamma+\alpha_{i}+u_{it},</math> where <math>y_{it}</math> is the dependent variable observed for individual <math>i</math> at time <math>t,</math> <math>X_{it}</math> is the time-variant regressor, <math>Z_{i}</math> is the time-invariant regressor, <math>\alpha_{i}</math> is the unobserved individual effect, and <math>u_{it}</math> is the error term. <math>\alpha_{i}</math> could represent motivation, ability, genetics (micro data) or historical factors and institutional factors (country-level data). The two main methods of dealing with <math> \alpha_{i} </math> are to make the random effects or fixed effects assumption: 1. Random effects (RE): Assume <math> \alpha_{i} </math> is independent of <math> X_{it},Z_{i} </math> or <math> E(\alpha_{i}|X_{it},Z_{i})=0</math> . (In biostatistics, <math> X_{it},Z_{i} </math> are predetermined, <math>\beta</math> and <math>\gamma</math> would be called the population effects or "fixed effects", and the individual effect or "random effect" <math> \alpha_{i} </math> is often denoted <math> b_{i} </math>.) 2. Fixed effects (FE): Assume <math> \alpha_{i} </math> is not independent of <math> X_{it},Z_{i}</math>. (There is no equivalent conceptualization in biostatistics; a predetermined <math> X_{it},Z_{i}</math> cannot vary, and so cannot be probabilistically associated with the random <math> \alpha_{i} </math>.) To get rid of individual effect <math>\alpha_{i},</math> a differencing or within transformation (time arranging) is applied to the data and then <math>\beta</math> is estimated via Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). The most common differencing methods are: 1. Fixed effects (FE) model: <math>y_{it}-\overline{y_{i}}=\left(X_{it}-\overline{X_{i}}\right) \beta+\left( u_{it}-\overline{u_{i}}\right)</math> where <math>\overline{X_{i}}=\frac{1}{T}\sum\limits_{t=1}^{T}X_{it}</math> and <math>\overline{u_{i}}=\frac{1}{T}\sum\limits_{t=1}^{T}u_{it}</math>. : <math>\qquad\hat{\beta}_{FE}=\left( \sum\limits_{i,t}^{I}\widehat{x}_{it}^{\prime }\widehat{x}_{it}\right) ^{-1}\sum\limits_{i,t}^{I}\widehat{x}_{it}^{\prime }\widehat{y}_{it}</math> where <math>\widehat{x}_{it}=\left( X_{it}-\overline{X_{i}}\right) </math> and <math>\widehat{y}_{it}=y_{it}-\overline{y_{i}}</math> 2. First difference (FD) model: <math>y_{it}-y_{it-1}=\left( X_{it} -X_{it-1}\right) \beta+\left( u_{it}-u_{it-1}\right) </math> : <math>\hat{\beta}_{FD}=\left( \sum\limits_{i,t}^{I}\widehat{x}_{it}^{\prime }\widehat{x}_{it}\right) ^{-1}\sum\limits_{i,t}^{I}\widehat{x}_{it}^{\prime }\widehat{y}_{it}</math> where <math>\widehat{x}_{it}=\left( X_{it}-X_{it-1}\right) </math> and <math>\widehat{y}_{it}=y_{it}-y_{it-1}</math> 3. Long difference (LD) model: <math>y_{it}-y_{i1}=\left( X_{it}-X_{i1}\right) \beta+\left( u_{it}-u_{i1}\right) </math> : <math>\hat{\beta}_{LD}=\left( \sum\limits_{i,t}^{I}\widehat{x}_{it}^{\prime }\widehat{x}_{it}\right) ^{-1}\sum\limits_{i,t}^{I}\widehat{x}_{it}^{\prime }\widehat{y}_{it}</math> where <math>\widehat{x}_{it}=\left( X_{it}-X_{i1}\right) </math> and <math>\widehat{y}_{it}=y_{it}-y_{i1}</math> Another common approach to removing the individual effect is to add a dummy variable for each individual <math>i</math>. This is numerically, but not computationally, equivalent to the fixed effect model and only works if <math>T,</math> the number of time observations per individual, is much larger than the number of individuals in the panel. A common misconception about fixed effect models is that it is impossible to estimate <math>\gamma,</math> the coefficient on the time-invariant regressor. One can estimate <math>\gamma</math> using Instrumental Variables techniques. Let <math>\widehat{di}=\overline{y_{i}}-\overline{X_{i}}\beta=Z_{i}\gamma +\varphi_{(\alpha)}</math> We can't use OLS to estimate <math>\gamma</math> from this equation because <math>Z_{i}</math> is correlated with <math>\alpha_{i}</math> (i.e. there is a problem with endogeneity from our FE assumption). If there are available instruments one can use IV estimation to estimate <math>\gamma</math> or use the [[Hausman&ndash;Taylor method]]. ==Hausman&ndash;Taylor method== Need to have more than one time-variant regressor (<math>X</math>) and time-invariant regressor (<math>Z</math>) and at least one <math>X</math> and one <math>Z</math> that are uncorrelated with <math>\alpha_{i}</math>. Partition the <math>X</math> and <math>Z</math> variables such that <math> \begin{array} [c]{c} X=[\underset{TN\times K1}{X_{1it}}\vdots\underset{TN\times K2}{X_{2it}}]\\ Z=[\underset{TN\times G1}{Z_{1it}}\vdots\underset{TN\times G2}{Z_{2it}}] \end{array} </math> where <math>X_{1}</math> and <math>Z_{1}</math> are uncorrelated with <math>\alpha_{i}</math>. Need <math>K1>G2</math>. Estimating <math> \gamma </math> via OLS on <math>\widehat{di}=Z_{i}\gamma+\varphi_{it}</math> using <math>X_1</math> and <math>Z_1</math> as instruments yields a consistent estimate. ==Testing FE vs. RE== We can test whether a fixed or random effects model is appropriate using a [[Hausman test]]. : <math>H_{0}</math>: <math>\alpha_{i}\perp X_{it},Z_{i}</math> : <math>H_{a}</math>: <math>\alpha_{i}\not \perp X_{it},Z_{i}</math> If <math>H_{0}</math> is true, both <math>\widehat{\beta}_{RE}</math> and <math>\widehat{\beta}_{FE}</math> are consistent, but only <math>\widehat{\beta}_{RE}</math> is efficient. If <math>H_{a}</math> is true, <math>\widehat{\beta}_{FE}</math> is consistent and <math>\widehat{\beta}_{RE}</math> is not. : <math>\widehat{Q}=</math> <math>\widehat{\beta}_{RE}-\widehat{\beta}_{FE}</math> : <math>\widehat{HT}=T\widehat{Q}^{\prime}[Var(\widehat{\beta}_{FE})-Var(\widehat {\beta}_{RE})]\widehat{Q}\sim\chi_{K}^{2}</math> where <math>K=\dim(Q)</math> The Hausman test is a specification test so a large test statistic might be indication that there might be Errors in Variables (EIV) or our model is misspecified. If the FE assumption is true, we should find that <math>\widehat {\beta}_{LD}\approx\widehat{\beta}_{FD}\approx\widehat{\beta}_{FE}</math>. A simple heuristic is that if <math>\left\vert \widehat{\beta}_{LD}\right\vert >\left\vert \widehat{\beta}_{FE}\right\vert >\left\vert \widehat{\beta} _{FD}\right\vert </math> there could be EIV. == See also == * [[Random effects model]] * [[Mixed model]] ==References== * {{cite book |title=Plane Answers to Complex Questions: The Theory of Linear Models|last=Christensen|first=Ronald|location=New York|publisher=Springer|year=2002| edition=Third|isbn=0-387-95361-2}} {{No footnotes|date=September 2009}} * {{cite web |url=http://www.stata.com/support/faqs/stat/xt.html |title=FAQ:What is the between estimator?}} * {{cite web |url=http://www.stata.com/support/faqs/stat/xtreg.html |title=FAQ: Fixed-, between-, and random-effects and xtreg}} ==External links== *[http://www.jr2.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/glossary/fixed.html Fixed effect model at Bandolier (Oxford EBM website)] *[http://teaching.sociology.ul.ie/DCW/confront/node45.html Fixed and random effects models] *[http://www.pitt.edu/~SUPER1/lecture/lec1171/012.htm How to Conduct a Meta-Analysis: Fixed and Random Effect Models] *[http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/glosf.html Fixed Effects (in ANOVA)] [[Category:Estimation theory]] [[Category:Analysis of variance]] [[Category:Regression analysis]]</text> </page> <page> <id>13718</id> <title>Fixstars Solutions</title> <text>{{Infobox company| company_name = Fixstars Solutions, Inc. | company_logo = [[Image:Fixstars logo.jpg|200px]] | company_type = [[Privately held company|Private]], subsidiary of Fixstars Corporation | foundation = 1999, 2008 | location = [[San Jose, California]] | industry = [[Operating system]]s, Services, Software | products = [[Yellow Dog Linux]] | homepage = [http://us.fixstars.com us.fixstars.com] }} '''Fixstars Solutions, Inc''' is a software and services company specializing in [[Multi-core processor]], particularly in the Nvidia's GPU and CUDA environment, IBM Power7 and [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell]].
