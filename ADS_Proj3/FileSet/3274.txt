Many of the most controversial topics for statistics issued by government do not come from ONS though they are expected to meet ''National Statistics'' standards. Crime statistics and other data (e.g. health and education) that could be deemed to assess the effectiveness of government policies often attract media scepticism. The compulsory nature of the census (unlike most other surveys by academics and market researchers) differentiates ONS from other data collectors (apart from [[HM Revenue and Customs]]). The Office for National Statistics won the 2004 [[Big Brother Award]] for the "Most Heinous Government Organisation" from the campaigning organisation [[Privacy International]] for its [[Citizen Information Project]]. The project is one of several that lead the [[Information Commissioner's Office|Information Commissioner]] to warn that there is a danger of the country "sleepwalking" into a [[mass surveillance|surveillance society]].<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article470264.ece ''"Beware rise of Big Brother state, warns data watchdog"''], Times Online, 16 August 2004.</ref> There has also been criticism of the ONS and of the government for its pursuit of government policies for modernization and for relocation to sites outside London. It is not moving to a single site and will continue to perform most of its functions from the two sites in Newport and Titchfield while reducing its London operation to one eventual small location. == See also == * [[United Kingdom Census 2001]] * [[Departments of the United Kingdom Government]] * [[Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency]] * [[List of national and international statistical services]] == References == {{Reflist}} == External links == * [http://www.statistics.gov.uk/default.asp Office for National Statistics website] * [http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk UK Statistics Authority] * [http://www.statistics.gov.uk/hub/index.html The National Statistics Publication Hub] * [http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/consultations_and_legislation/statistics_bill/statistics_bill_index.cfm Statistics and Registration Service Bill], Treasury website. * [http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/pabills/200607/statistics_and_registration_service.htm Statistics and Registration Service Bill], Parliament website. * [http://www.palgrave.com/ons/ Palgrave Macmillan, official publisher for the Office for National Statistics] * [http://www.bized.co.uk/dataserv/ons/onshistory.htm A Brief History of the ONS] [[Category:Demographics of England]] [[Category:Demographics of Wales]] [[Category:National statistical services]] [[Category:Organisations based in Newport]] [[Category:Databases in the United Kingdom]] [[Category:Office for National Statistics]] [[Category:Organizations established in 1996]] [[cs:Office for National Statistics]] [[cy:Swyddfa Ystadegau Gwladol]] [[da:Office for National Statistics]] [[de:Office for National Statistics]] [[es:Office for National Statistics]] [[fr:Office for National Statistics]] [[id:Kantor Statistik Nasional (Britania Raya)]] [[it:Office for National Statistics]] [[nl:Office for National Statistics]] [[no:Office for National Statistics]] [[nn:Office for National Statistics]]</text> </page> <page> <id>27151</id> <title>OkCupid</title> <text>{{Cleanup-link rot|date=October 2010}} {{Infobox Website | name = OkCupid | favicon = | logo = [[Image:okcupid logo.png]] | screenshot = <!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Okcupidscreenshot II.png|325px]] --> | caption = The OkCupid homepage on May 28, 2008 | url = http://www.okcupid.com | commercial = Mixed | type = [[Online dating service]], [[Social network service]] | registration = Required for membership | owner = Humor Rainbow, Inc. | author = Chris Coyne, Sam Yagan, Christian Rudder and Max Krohn | launch date = March 5, 2004 | current status = | revenue = }} '''OkCupid''' is a free [[online dating service|dating]] and [[social network service|social networking]] website which features member-created quizzes and supports various modes of communication: personal blogs, public forums, instant messages, emails, and "winks".
