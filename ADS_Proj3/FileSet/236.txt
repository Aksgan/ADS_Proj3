force in a way similar to anti-gravity, dictating repulsion away from mass. Several experiments were carried out in the 1990s to measure this effect, but none yielded positive results.<ref name=SciAm79>''Supergravity and the Unification of the Laws of Physics,'' by Daniel Z. Freedman and Peter van Nieuwenhuizen, Scientific American, February 1978</ref> ====General-relativistic "warp drives"==== There are solutions of the field equations of general relativity which describe "warp drives" (such as the famous [[Alcubierre metric]]) and stable, traversable [[wormholes]]. This by itself is not significant, since ''any'' spacetime geometry is a solution of the field equations for some configuration of the [[stress-energy tensor]] field (see [[exact solutions in general relativity]]). General relativity does not constrain the geometry of spacetime unless outside constraints are placed on the stress-energy tensor. Warp-drive and traversable-wormhole geometries are well-behaved in most areas, but require regions of [[exotic matter]]; thus they are excluded as solutions if the stress-energy tensor is limited to known forms of matter. Dark matter and dark energy are not understood enough at this present time to make general statements regarding their applicability to a warp-drive. Many physicists such as Edmond S. Miksch of Harvard have theorized that dark matter has negative mass. There is considerable empirical evidence supporting this claim such as the results produced by Supernova Cosmology Project team in 1998.<ref>Choi, Hyoyoung; "Hypothesis of Dark Matter and Dark Energy with Negative Mass"; July 2009; http://vixra.org/abs/0907.0015</ref> ====Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program==== During the close of the twentieth century [[NASA]] provided funding for the [[Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program]] (BPP) from 1996 through 2002. This program studied a number of "far out" designs for space propulsion that were not receiving funding through normal university or commercial channels. Anti-gravity-like concepts were investigated under the name "diametric drive". The work of the BPP program continues in the independent, non-NASA affiliated [http://www.tauzero.aero/ Tau Zero Foundation]. ==Empirical claims and commercial efforts== Anti-gravity devices are a common invention in the "alt" field, often requiring a completely new physics framework in order to work. Most of these devices rather obviously do not work, and are often parts of grander [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]]. However there have also been a number of commercial attempts to build such devices as well, and a small number of reports of anti-gravity-like effects in the scientific literature. As of 2007, none of the examples that follow are accepted as genuine, reproducible examples of practically applicable anti-gravity, at least by the larger physics community. ====Gyroscopic devices==== [[Image:H W Wallace force field figure 4.png|thumb|350px|A "kinemassic field" generator from {{US patent|3626605}}: Method and apparatus for generating a secondary gravitational force field.]] [[Gyroscope]]s produce a force when twisted that operates "out of plane" and can appear to lift themselves against gravity. Although this force is well understood to be illusory, even under Newtonian models, it has nevertheless generated numerous claims of anti-gravity devices and any number of patented devices. None of these devices have ever been demonstrated to work under controlled conditions, and have often become the subject of [[conspiracy theories]] as a result. A famous example is that of Professor [[Eric Laithwaite]] of Imperial College, London, in the 1974 address to the Royal Institution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rexresearch.com/laithwat/laithw1.htm#art1|title=Eric LAITHWAITE Gyroscope Levitation|work=Rex research|publisher=rexresearch.com|accessdate=23 October 2010}}</ref> Perhaps the best known example is a series of patents issued to [[Henry William Wallace]], an engineer at [[GE Aerospace]] in [[Valley Forge, Pennsylvania]], and GE Re-Entry Systems in Philadelphia. He constructed devices that rapidly spun disks of [[brass]], a material made up largely of elements with a total half-integer nuclear spin.<ref>[http://www.fortunecity.com/greenfield/fatcat/53/wallace.html METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR GENERATING A SECONDARY GRAVITATIONAL FORCE FIELD]</ref> He claimed that by rapidly rotating a disk of such material, the [[nuclear spin]] became aligned, and as a result created a "gravitomagnetic" field in a fashion similar to the magnetic field created by the [[Barnett effect]]. Hayasaka and Takeuchi had reported weight decreases along the axis of a right spinning gyroscope.<ref>Hayasaka, H. and Takeuchi, S. (1989). ''Phys. Rev. Lett.'', '''63''', 2701-2704</ref> Tests of their claims by Nitschke and Wilmath yielded null results.<ref>Nitschke, J. M., and Wilmath, P. A. (1990). ''Phys. Rev. Lett.'', '''64'''(18), 2115-2116</ref> A few years later, recommendations were made to conduct further tests.<ref>Iwanaga, N. (1999). Reviews of some field propulsion methods from the general relativistic standpoint.''AIP Conference Proceedings'', '''458''', 1015-1059.</ref> Provatidis and Tsiriggakis have proposed a novel gyroscope equipped by couples of rotating mass particles that draw only the upper (or lower) 180 degrees of a circle, thus producing net impulse per full revolution. This is achieved by transforming the previously used circular orbit into a figure-eight-shaped path (symbol of infinity) of variable curvature that entirely lies on the surface of a hemisphere.<ref>Provatidis, Christopher, G.

Although it was claimed that the device operated outside of [[working mass]], Brown abandoned this work and moved on to produce a series of successful high-voltage devices in the following years. The [[Biefeld–Brown effect]] nevertheless lives on. A 1956 analysis by the Gravity Research Group and by
