The engine was ported to [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Direct X]] in [[1998 in video gaming|1998]], as well as updating it beyond ''Wolfenstein 3D''-like standards. The company had first detected the decline of [[MS DOS]] in 1994, and had decided to port to Windows and adopt 3D API technology using the [[Renderware]] library. This was first attempted in a [[racing game]] called ''Baja Bash'' but emphasis was switched to converting the old game creation engine due to market demands, time constraints, and some criticism of the later game - despite its attempted physics advances. Due to licensing constraints however, they eventually opted to use [[Direct3D]].<ref name="pieintheskysoftware.com">[http://pieintheskysoftware.com/menuitemtophome.html The History of Pie in the Sky Software Part 3]</ref> In this updated form that it was used in the game ''[[Pie in the Sky (game engine)#Pencil Whipped|Pencil Whipped]]'', designed for the [[2000 in video gaming|2000]] [[Independent Games Festival]].
