Last version of EIOffice 2009 (5.0.1272.101EN.L1) cannot open or save ODF files. * [[Haansoft Corporation|Haansoft]]'s [[Hangul (word processor)|Hangul Word Processor]] will support OpenDocument format documents in its next version for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], which is planned for the end of 2009.<ref>http://www.zdnet.co.kr/etc/eyeon/enterprise/0,39036961,39164305,00.htm</ref> * An extension for [[Mozilla Firefox]] has been proposed by a developer named Talin, according to Mozilla hacker Gervase Markham [http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/archives/2006/01/odf_in_firefox.html (source)]; it has since been further modified by Alex Hudson<ref>http://www.alcoholicsunanimous.com/odfreader/</ref> and was hosted in the official Firefox extension repository.<ref>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1888</ref> * [http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Wikis_Go_Printable Wikipedia announced] that it will use ODF for printing wikis. * [[BlackBerry]] smartphones are going to support ODF in their embedded office suites, starting mid-2009.<ref name="openmalaysiablog.com">http://www.openmalaysiablog.com/2009/01/blackberries-to-support-opendocument-format.html</ref> * The [[WordPad]] editor in [[Windows 7]] already includes support for ODF.<ref name="openmalaysiablog.com"/> ==Programmatic support, filters, converters== OpenDocument packages are ordinary [[ZIP (file format)|zip files]]. There is an OpenDocument format which is just a single XML file, but most applications use the package format. Thus, any of the vast number of tools for handling zip files and XML data can be used to handle OpenDocument. Nearly all programming languages have libraries (built-in or available) for processing XML files and zip files. ===Microsoft=== In October 2005, one year before the Microsoft Office 2007 suite was released, Microsoft declared that there is not sufficient demand from Microsoft customers for international standard OpenDocument format support and therefore it will not be included in Microsoft Office 2007. This statement was repeated also in next months.<ref name="office12-pdf">[http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/0,1000000121,39225406,00.htm Office 12 to support PDF creation, 03 Oct 2005]</ref><ref name="odf-must">[http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/0,1000000121,39226547,00.htm Microsoft 'must support OpenDocument', 06 Oct 2005]</ref><ref name="gates-odf">23 March 2006, Gates: Office 2007 will enable a new class of application [http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-148675.html]</ref><ref name="odf">[http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/software/soa/Microsoft_Office_to_get_a_dose_of_OpenDocument/0,130061733,139255766,00.htm May 08, 2006 - Microsoft Office to get a dose of OpenDocument]</ref> As an answer, on October 20, 2005 an online petition was created to demand ODF support from Microsoft.<ref name="petition">[http://opendocumentfellowship.com/press/2005-10-20 OpenDocument Support: Tell Microsoft You Want It!, 20 October 2005]</ref> The petition was signed by circa 12000 people.<ref>[http://opendocumentfellowship.com/petition ODF Fellowship Petition]</ref> In May 2006, ODF plugin for Microsoft Office was released by OpenDocument Foundation.<ref name="mso-odf-plugin">[http://www.linux-watch.com/news/NS5139606687.html Coming soon: ODF for MS Office, May 04, 2006]</ref> Microsoft declared that the company did not work with the developers of the plug-in.<ref name="odf-plugin-no-cooperating">[http://news.cnet.com/Microsoft-Office-to-get-a-dose-of-OpenDocument/2100-1013_3-6069188.html?tag=nefd.lede Microsoft Office to get a dose of OpenDocument, May 5, 2006]</ref> In July 2006 Microsoft announced the creation of the Open XML Translator project—tools to build a technical bridge between the Microsoft Office Open XML Formats and the OpenDocument Format (ODF). This work was started in response to government requests for interoperability with ODF.

A third plug-in, OpenOpenOffice (O3),<ref>http://sourceforge.net/projects/openopenoffice/</ref> is apparently inactive. ''OpenOpenOffice'' was developed by Phase-n, a [[free software|free]] and [[open source software]] [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] to enable [[Microsoft Office]] to read and write OpenDocument files (and any other formats supported by [[OpenOffice.org]]). Instead of installing a complete office application or even a large plug-in, O3 intended to install a tiny plug-in to the Microsoft Office system. This tiny plug-in intended to automatically send the file to some server, which would then do the conversion, returning the converted file. The server could be local to an organization (so private information doesn't go over the Internet) or accessed via the Internet (for those who do not want to set up a server). A beta of the server half has been completed, and further expected announcements have not occurred. Phase-n argued that the main advantage of their approach is simplicity.
