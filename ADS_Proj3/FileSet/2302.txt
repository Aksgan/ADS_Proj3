observation of the rare decay of the neutral kaon to a muon pair, the time-dependence of the asymmetry for semi-leptonic decays, and a more precise measurement of the neutral kaon mass difference. A new era in experimental technique was opened. These new techniques proved crucial for the first demonstration of direct [[CP-violation]]. The [[NA31 experiment]] at CERN was built in the early 1980s using the CERN [[Super Proton Synchrotron|SPS 400 GeV proton synchrotron]]. Aside from banks of MWPC's and a hadron calorimeter, it featured a [[liquid argon]] electromagnetic calorimeter with exceptional spatial and energy resolution. NA31 showed that direct CP violation is real.<ref> {{cite journal |author=H.

He shares this prize with [[Leon M. Lederman]] and [[Melvin Schwartz]]. At the time, all three experimenters were at [[Columbia University]]. The experiment used charged [[pion]] beams generated with the ''Alternating Gradient Synchrotron'' (AGS) at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]]. The pions decayed to [[muons]] which were detected in front of a steel wall; the [[neutrinos]] were detected in spark chambers installed behind the wall. The coincidence of muons and neutrinos demonstrated that a second kind of neutrino was created in association with muons. Subsequent experiments proved this neutrino to be distinct from the first kind (electron-type). Steinberger, Lederman and Schwartz published their work in Physical Review Letters in 1962.<ref name="slac.stanford.edu"/> He gave his Nobel medal to [[New Trier High School]] in [[Winnetka, Illinois]] (USA), of which he is an alumnus. ==References== {{reflist|2}} ==Publications== *Steinberger, J. & A.

James is the author or co-author of a number of influential specifications and implementations, including: * [[DSSSL]] - An SGML transformation and styling language. * [[Expat (XML)]] - An open-source XML parser. * [[XSLT]] - XSL Transformations, a part of the XSL family. * [[TREX]] - An XML Schema language. * [[RELAX NG]] - An XML Schema language with both an explicit XML form and a compact form, with an implementation, Jing.
