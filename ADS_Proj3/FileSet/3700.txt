cell size.<ref name=parsci/> In the vertical orientation (U-shaped) racetrack, about 10-20 bits are stored per cell, which itself can have a physical size of at least about 20 F². In addition, bits at different positions on the "track" would take different times (from ~10 ns to nearly a microsecond, or 10 ns/bit) to be accessed by the read/write sensor, because the "track" is moved at fixed rate (~100 m/s) past the read/write sensor. Racetrack memory is one of a number of new technologies aiming to replace flash memory, and potentially offer a "universal" memory device applicable to a wide variety of roles. Other leading contenders include [[Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory|MRAM]], [[Phase-change memory|PCRAM]] and [[FeRAM]]. Most of these technologies offer densities similar to flash memory, in most cases worse, and their primary advantage is the lack of write endurance limits like those in flash memory. Field-MRAM offers excellent performance as high as 3 ns access time, but requires a large 25-40 F² cell size. It might see use as a SRAM replacement, but not as a mass storage device. The highest densities from any of these devices is offered by PCRAM, which has a cell size of about 5.8 F², similar to flash memory, as well as fairly good performance around 50 ns. Nevertheless, none of these can come close to competing with racetrack memory in overall terms, especially density. For example, 50 ns allows about five bits to be operated in a racetrack memory device, resulting in an effective cell size of 20/5=4 F², easily exceeding the performance-density product of PCM. On the other hand, without sacrificing bit density, the same 20 F² area can also fit 2.5 2-bit 8 F² alternative memory cells (such as [[RRAM]] or [[MRAM|spin-torque transfer MRAM]]), each of which could individually operated much faster (~10 ns). A difficulty for this technology arises from the need for high [[current density]] (>10<sup>8</sup> A/cm²); a 30 nm x 100 nm cross-section would require >3 mA. The resulting power draw would be higher than, for example, spin-torque transfer memory or flash memory. ==Development difficulties== One limitation of the early experimental devices was that the magnetic domains could only be pushed slowly through the wires, requiring current pulses on the orders of microseconds to move them successfully. This was unexpected, and led to performance roughly equal to [[hard drive]]s, as much as 1000 times slower than predicted. Recent research at the [[University of Hamburg]] has traced this problem to microscopic imperfections in the crystal structure of the wires which led to the domains becoming "stuck" at these imperfections. Using an [[x-ray microscope]] to directly image the boundaries between the domains, their research found that domain walls would be moved by pulses as short as a few nanoseconds when these imperfections were absent. This corresponds to a macroscopic performance of about 110 m/s.<ref>[http://technology.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn11837&feedId=tech_rss20 'Racetrack' memory could gallop past the hard disk]</ref> The voltage required to drive the domains along the racetrack would be proportional to the length of the wire. The current density must be sufficiently high to push the domain walls (as in [[electromigration]]). For example, a permalloy racetrack of [[resistivity]] 5&times;10<sup>-7</sup> ohm-m, that is 1 cm long to cover an entire chip array,<ref> S. S. P. Parkin, U. S. Patent 7315470 </ref> and uses a current density of 3&times;10<sup>8</sup> A/cm², would require a driving voltage of 15 kV along the racetrack. ==See also== *[[Bubble memory]] *[[Giant magnetoresistance]] (GMR) effect *[[Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory]] (MRAM) *[[Spintronics]] *[[Spin transistor]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/11/technology/11storage.html?ex=1347163200&en=26735eaee1d37b46&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss Redefining the Architecture of Memory] *[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJf3z9AfiVM IBM Moves Closer to New Class of Memory] ([[YouTube]] video) {{Magnetic storage media}} [[Category:Computer memory]] [[Category:Non-volatile memory]] [[Category:IBM storage devices]] [[Category:Spintronics]] [[ca:Memòria racetrack]] [[de:Racetrack-Speicher]] [[es:Memoria racetrack]] [[fr:Mémoire racetrack]] [[it:Memoria Racetrack]] [[nl:Racetrack memory]] [[vi:Bộ nhớ racetrack]]</text> </page> <page> <id>31101</id> <title>Rack unit</title> <text>[[Image:rackunit.svg|250px|right]] [[Image:Server rack rail dimensions.svg|thumb|A typical section of rack rail, showing rack unit distribution.]] A '''rack unit''' or '''U''' (less commonly '''RU''') is a unit of measure used to describe the [[height]] of equipment intended for mounting in a [[19-inch rack]] or a [[23-inch rack]] (The dimension refers to the width of the equipment mounting frame in the rack i.e. the width of the equipment that can be mounted inside the rack). One rack unit is 1.75 [[inch]]es (44.45 [[Millimetre|mm]]) high. The size of a piece of rack-mounted equipment is frequently described as a number in "U". For example, one rack unit is often referred to as "1U", 2 rack units as "2U" and so on. The term "half-rack" is used differently in [[computing]] and audio/video (AV) applications. In AV, half-rack units typically describe units that fit in a certain number of rack units, but occupy only half the width of a 19-inch rack (9.5 in or 241 mm). These are commonly used when a piece of equipment does not require full rack width, but may require more than 1U of height. For example, a "4U half-rack" [[DVCAM]] deck would occupy 4U (7 in) height × 9.5 in width, and in theory, two 4U half-rack decks could be mounted side by side and occupy the 4U space. In computing and [[information technology]], however, "half-rack" typically describes a unit that is 1U high and half the depth of a 4-post rack (such as a [[network switch]], [[router]], [[KVM switch]], or [[Server (computing)|server]]), such that two units can be mounted in 1U of space (one mounted at the front of the rack and one at the rear). A front panel or filler panel in a rack is not an exact multiple of 1.75 inches (44.45 mm). To allow space between adjacent rack-mounted components, a panel is {{frac|1|32}} inch (0.031 inch or 0.79 mm) less in height than the full number of rack units would imply. Thus, a 1U front panel would be 1.719 inches (43.66 mm) high. If ''n'' is number of rack units, the formula for panel height is ''h'' = (1.750''n'' − 0.031) inch = (44.45''n'' − 0.79) mm. Coincidentally, a rack unit is equal to a [[vershok]], an obsolete Russian
