on [[American Bandstand]] to promote the album on January 14, 1984, Madonna expressed her dream "to rule the world."<ref>{{cite web|title=Celebrating Madonna: The Queen of Pop's 50 Most Iconic Moments|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Jann Wenner|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/photos/8404/101688|accessdate=2010-02-29}}</ref> Following the release of the album, Madonna was dismissed by some music critics. After the success of her single "[[Holiday (Madonna song)|Holiday]]", they began to call her a [[one-hit wonder]].<ref>{{harvnb|Keeley|2000|p=46}}</ref> Madonna said, "In the beginning I was called everything from a Disco Dolly to a One-Hit Wonder."<ref>{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=90}}</ref> She responded the comment "Minnie Mouse on helium" from ''Time'' magazine by doing a photoshoot with Alberto Tolot, where she flirted with a giant [[Mickey Mouse]] toy, putting its hand inside her dress and looking at it with an admonishing glare. Author Debbi Voller noted that "such provocative imagery at a young age of her career, could have hurt her too much. But it went on to shut those twerps who dared to take a swag at her voice again."<ref>{{harvnb|Voller|1999|p=30}}</ref> Twenty-five years later, in her acceptance speech of [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] induction, Madonna thanked the critics who snubbed her in the early years, "The ones that said I was talentless, that I was chubby, that I couldn't sing, that I was a one-hit wonder. They pushed me to be better, and I am grateful for their resistance."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/music/madonna-still-manages-to-shock/story-e6frf9hf-1111115778132|title=Madonna shocks with confession at Hall of Fame acceptance speech|last=Reporter|first=Herald Sun|date=2008-03-12|work=[[Herald Sun]]|publisher=[[The Herald and Weekly Times]]|accessdate=2010-05-15}}</ref> In an interview with ''Time'', Madonna reflected that her relationship with her father had not been good, before she released her debut album. "My father had never believed that what I was doing here [in New York] was worthwhile, nor did he believe that I was up to any good. [...] It wasn't until my first album came out and my father started hearing my songs on the radio that he stopped asking the questions."<ref name="clerk">{{harvnb|Clerk|2002|p=42}}</ref> Music critics Bob Batchelor and Scott Stoddart, commented in their book ''The 1980s'' that "the music videos for the singles off the album, was more effective in introducing Madonna to the rest of the world."<ref>{{harvnb|Batchelor|Stoddart|2007|p=117}}</ref> Author Carol Clerk said that the music videos of "Burning Up", "Borderline" and "Lucky Star" established Madonna, not as the girl-next-door, but as a sassy and smart, tough funny woman. Her clothes worn in the videos were later used by designers like [[Karl Lagerfeld]] and [[Christian Lacroix]], in Paris Fashion week of the same year.<ref name="clerk"/> Professor [[Douglas Kellner]], in his book ''Media Culture: Cultural Studies, Identity, and Politics Between the Modern and the Postmodern'', commented that the videos depicted motifs and strategies which helped Madonna in her journey to become a star.<ref>{{harvnb|Kellner|1995|p=269}}</ref> With the "Borderline" music video, Madonna was credited for breaking the taboo of interracial relationships and was considered one of her career-making moments. [[MTV]] played the video in heavy rotation, increasing Madonna's popularity further.<ref name="fouz"/> The release of the album, heralded Madonna's arrival in the music scene, but her vocal abilities were not fully formed artistically. Her vocal styles and lyrics appeared similar to those of other pop stars of that period, namely [[Paula Abdul]], [[Debbie Gibson]] and [[Taylor Dayne]].<ref name="fouzvocal">{{harvnb|Fouz-Hernández|Jarman-Ivens|2004|pp=59–61}}</ref> The songs on ''Madonna'' reveal several key trends that have continued to define her success, including a strong dance-based idiom, catchy [[hook (music)|hooks]], highly polished [[arrangement]] and Madonna's own vocal style. In songs such as "Lucky Star" and Borderline", Madonna introduced a style of upbeat dance music that would prove particularly appealing to future gay audiences. The bright, girlish vocal [[timbre]] of the early years became passé in Madonna's later works, the change being deliberate, to cater the latest trends in the music world.<ref name="fouzvocal"/> ==Track listing== {{tracklist | extra_column = Producer(s) | writing_credits = yes | title1 = [[Lucky Star (song)|Lucky Star]] | writer1 = [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] | extra1 = [[Reggie Lucas]] | length1 = 5:37 | title2 = [[Borderline (song)|Borderline]] | writer2 = Reggie Lucas | extra2 = Reggie Lucas | length2 = 5:18 | title3 = [[Burning Up]] | writer3 = Madonna | extra3 = Reggie Lucas | length3 = 3:44 | title4 = I Know It | writer4 = Madonna | extra4 = Reggie Lucas | length4 = 3:45 | title5 = [[Holiday (Madonna song)|Holiday]] | writer5 = Curtis Hudson, [[Paizo Publishing|Lisa Stevens]] | extra5 = [[John Benitez|John "Jellybean" Benitez]] | length5 = 6:08 | title6 = Think of Me | writer6 = Madonna | extra6 = Reggie Lucas | length6 = 4:53 | title7 = Physical Attraction | writer7 = Reggie Lucas | extra7 = Reggie Lucas | length7 = 6:36 | title8 = [[Everybody (Madonna song)|Everybody]] | writer8 = Madonna | extra8 = [[Mark Kamins]] | length8 = 4:57 |}} {{tracklist | headline = 2001 Remastered version bonus tracks | collapsed = yes | extra_column = Producer(s) | writing_credits = yes | title9 = Burning Up | note9 = 12" Version | writer9 = Madonna | extra9 = Reggie Lucas | length9 = 5:56 | title10 = Lucky Star | note10 = "New" Mix | writer10 = Madonna | extra10 = Reggie Lucas, John "Jellybean" Benitez | length10 =7:15 }} '''Additional notes:'''<ref>'''Liner notes for ''Madonna'' (1983) by Madonna''', Sire Records Company, 9-23867</ref><ref>'''Liner notes for ''Madonna - The First Album'' (1985) by Madonna''', Sire Records Company, 9-23867</ref><ref>'''Liner notes for ''Madonna'' (Remastered, 2001) by Madonna''', Warner Bros.
