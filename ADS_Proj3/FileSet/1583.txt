formats, and the subject distance is adjusted to have the same ''field'' of view (i.e., the same framing of the subject) in each format, [[depth of field]] (DoF) is in inverse proportion to the format sizes, so for the same ''f''-number, the full-frame format will have less DoF. Equivalently, for the same DoF, the full-frame format will require a larger ''f''-number. This relationship is approximate and holds for moderate subject distances, breaking down as the distance with the smaller format approaches the hyperfocal distance, and as the magnification with the larger format approaches the macro range. There are optical quality implications as well—not only because the image from the lens is effectively cropped—but because many lens designs are now optimized for sensors smaller than {{nowrap|36 mm × 24 mm}}.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The rear element of any SLR lens must have clearance for the camera's reflex mirror to move up when the shutter is released; with a wide-angle lens, this requires a [[Angénieux retrofocus|retrofocus]] design, which is generally of inferior optical quality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.camerarepair.com/Retrofocus-Design-Problems-A-Synopsis-T37.html |title=Retrofocus Design Problems: A Synopsis |publisher=Camerarepair.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-30}}</ref> Because a cropped-format sensor can have a smaller mirror, less clearance is needed, and some lenses, such as the [[Canon EF-S lens mount|EF-S]] lenses for the Canon [[APS-C]] sized bodies,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.canon.com/camera-museum/history/canon_story/2001_2004/2001_2004.html | title = The Canon Camera Story: 2001-2004 | date = 2004-11 | accessdate = 2009-09-26 }}</ref> are designed with a shorter [[Back focal distance|back-focus distance]]; however, they cannot be used on bodies with larger sensors. In addition to wide-angle photography, another major advantage of full-frame cameras is pixel size. For a given number of pixels, the larger sensor allows for larger pixels or photosites that provide wider dynamic range and lower noise at high ISO levels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.photocrati.com/q-a-are-full-frame-sensor-cameras-the-best-bet-for-a-serious-amateur/ |title=Full-frame sensors |publisher=Photocrati |date= |accessdate=2010-12-30}}</ref> As a consequence, full-frame DSLRs may produce better quality images in certain high contrast or low light situations. The full-frame sensor can also be useful with wide-angle [[Perspective control lens|perspective control]] or [[tilt-shift lens|tilt/shift]] lenses; in particular, the wider angle of view is often more suitable for [[architectural photography]]. While full-frame DSLRs offer advantages for wide-angle photography, smaller-sensor DSLRs offer some advantages for [[telephoto]] photography because the smaller angle of view of small-sensor DSLRs enhances the telephoto effect of the lenses. For example, a 200 mm lens on a camera with a crop factor of 1.5 has the same angle of view as a 300 mm lens on a full-frame camera. The extra "reach", for a given number of pixels, can be helpful in specific areas of photography such as wildlife or sports.<ref>{{cite book | title = Digital Nature Photography: The Art and the Science | author = Barbara Gerlach | publisher = Focal Press | year = 2007 | isbn = 9780240808567 | page = 67 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=iNrWzL_NpWkC&pg=PA67&dq=%22reach%22+crop-factor&lr=&as_brr=0&ei=6Yc2So6ZDpDSkwSy9JmdBQ&hl=en&e=v1 }}</ref> Production costs for a full-frame sensor can exceed twenty times the costs for an APS-C sensor. Only 20 full-frame sensors will fit on an {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}} silicon wafer, and [[Semiconductor device fabrication|yield]] is comparatively low because the sensor's large area makes it very vulnerable to contaminants—20 evenly distributed defects could theoretically ruin an entire wafer. Additionally, the full-frame sensor requires three separate exposures during the [[photolithography]] stage, tripling the number of masks and exposure processes.<ref name=canon-wp>{{cite pressrelease | url = http://www.usa.canon.com/uploadedimages/FCK/Image/White%20Papers/Canon_CMOS_WP.pdf | title = Canon's Full-Frame CMOS Sensors: The Finest Tools for Digital Photography | date = 2006 | accessdate = 2009-12-26 | publisher = [[Canon (company)|Canon]] }}</ref> Some full-frame DSLRs intended mainly for professional use include more features than typical consumer-grade DSLRs, so some of their larger dimensions and increased mass result from more rugged construction and additional features as opposed to this being an inherent consequence of the full-frame sensor. ==Other uses of ''full-frame''== ===CCD image sensor architectures=== The term ''full-frame'' is also used to refer to a type of [[charge-coupled device]] sensor technology in which the sensor elements occupy the entire sensor surface rather than sharing space with associated pixel storage sites.<ref>{{cite book | title = Solid-State Imaging with Charge-Coupled Devices | author = Albert J.
