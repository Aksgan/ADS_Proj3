whose vector multiplication commutes, may or may not associate, and satisfies the [[Jordan identity]]. ****[[Lie algebra]]: an algebra over a field satisfying the [[Jacobi identity]]. The vector multiplication, the [[Lie bracket]] denoted [''u,v''], [[anticommute]]s, usually does not associate, and is [[nilpotent]]. *****[[Kac-Moody algebra]]: a Lie algebra, usually infinite-dimensional, definable by [[generating set|generators]] and relations through a [[generalized Cartan matrix]]. ******[[Generalized Kac-Moody algebra]]: a Kac-Moody algebra whose [[simple root]]s may be [[imaginary]]. ******[[Affine Lie algebra]]: a Kac-Moody algebra whose [[generalized Cartan matrix]] is [[positive semi-definite]] and has corank 1. ==Quasivarieties== A [[quasivariety]] is a variety with one or more axioms that are [[quasiidentity|quasiidentities]]. Let Greek letters be metavariables denoting [[identity (mathematics)|identities]]. A quasiidentity then takes the form (α<sub>1</sub>∧,...,∧α<sub>n</sub>) → β. ===Magmas=== ====Cancellative ==== *[[Cancellation property|Semigroup]]: a semigroup satisfying the added axioms ''xa''=''ya''→''x''=''y'', and ''bx''=''by''→''x''=''y''. *[[Cancellation property|Monoid]]: a [[unital algebra|unital]] cancellative semigroup. ====Combinatory logic==== The elements of ''S'' are [[higher order function]]s, and concatenation denotes the binary operation of [[function composition]]. *[[BCI algebra]]: a magma with distinguished element 0, satisfying the identities (''xy.xz'')''zy'' = 0, (''x.xy'')''y'' = 0, ''xx''=0, ''xy''=''yx''=0 → ''x''=''y'', and ''x''0 = 0 → ''x''=0. **[[BCK algebra]]: a BCI algebra satisfying the identity ''x''0 = ''x''. ''x''≤''y'', defined as ''xy''=0, induces a [[partial order]] with 0 as least element. *[[SKI combinator calculus|Combinatory logic]]: A [[combinator]] [[concatenate]]s upper case letters. [[Term (mathematics)|Terms]] concatenate combinators and lower case letters. Concatenation is left and right [[cancellation property|cancellative]]. '=' is an [[equivalence relation]] over terms. The axioms are '''S'''''xyz'' = ''xz''.''yz'' and '''K'''''xy'' = ''x''; these implicitly define the primitive combinators '''S''' and '''K'''. The distinguished elements '''I''' and '''1''', defined as '''I'''='''SK'''.'''K''' and '''1'''='''S'''.'''KI''', have the provable properties '''I'''''x''=''x'' and '''1'''''xy''=''xy''. Combinatory logic has the expressive power of [[set theory]].<ref>[[Raymond Smullyan]] (1994) ''Diagonalization and Self-Reference''. Oxford Univ. Press: chpt. 18.</ref> **[[combinatory logic|Extensional combinatory logic]]: Combinatory logic with the added quasiidentity (''Wx''=''Vx'')→(''W''=''V''), with ''W'', ''V'' containing no instance of ''x''. ===Graphs=== '''One set''', ''V'' a [[finite set]] of [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]], and a [[binary relation]] ''E''⊆''V''<sup>2</sup>, [[adjacency relation|adjacency]], consisting of [[edge (graph theory)|edges]]. No operations. *[[Directed graph]]: ''E'' is [[irreflexive]]. **[[Directed acyclic graph]]: A directed graph with no [[path (graph theory)|path]] whose endpoints are the same element of ''V''. **[[Graph (mathematics)|Graph]]: A directed graph such that ''E'' is [[symmetric]]. Dropping the requirement that ''E'' be [[irreflexive]] makes [[loop (graph theory)|loops]] possible. ***[[Connected graph]]: A graph such that a [[path (graph theory)|path]] connects any two vertices. ****[[Tree (graph theory)|Tree]]: a connected graph with no [[cycle (graph theory)|cycles]]. ****[[Cycle graph]]: a connected graph consisting of a single [[cycle (graph theory)|cycle]]. ****[[Complete graph]]: a connected graph such that the path between any two vertices includes no other vertex. Hence for any two vertices ''x'' and ''y'', (''x'',''y'') and (''y'',''x'') are both elements of ''E''. *****[[Tournament (graph theory)|Tournament]]: A complete graph such that only one of (''x'',''y'') and (''y'',''x'') is an element of ''E''. ===Lattices=== *[[Semimodular lattice]]: * [[Kleene algebra|Kleene lattice]]: a bounded distributive lattice with a unary involution, denoted by postfix ', satisfying the axioms (x∨y)' = x'∨y', x" = x, and (x∧x')∨(y∨y') = y∨y'. *[[Semidistributive lattice]]: a lattice satisfying the axiom (''x''∧''y'' = ''x''∧''z'')→(''x''∧''y''=''x''∧(''y''∨''z'')), and dually. ===Ring-like=== * [[Kleene algebra]]: a semiring with [[idempotent]] addition and a unary operation, the [[Kleene star]], denoted by [[reverse Polish notation|postfix]] * and satisfying (1+x*x)x*=x*=(1+xx*)x*. ==Universal classes== *Quasitrivial [[groupoid]]: a [[magma]] such that ''xy'' = ''x'' or ''y''. *[[Integral domain]]: A commutative ring such that (''xy''=0)→((''x''=0)∨(''y''=0)). Also a [[domain (ring theory)|domain]] whose multiplication commutes. *Integral relation algebra: a [[relation algebra]] such that (''xy''=0)→((''x''=0)∨(''y''=0)). ===Partial order for nonlattices=== If the [[partial order]] relation ≤ is added to a structure other than a lattice, the result is a ''partially ordered'' structure. These are discussed in Birkhoff (1967: chpts. 13-15, 17) using a differing terminology. Examples include: * Ordered [[magma (algebra)|magma]], [[semigroup]], [[monoid]], [[ordered group|group]], and [[ordered vector space|vector space]]: In each case, ''S'' is partially ordered; * [[Linearly ordered group]] and [[ordered ring]]: ''S'' is [[linear order|linearly ordered]]; ** [[Archimedean group]]: a [[linearly ordered group]] for which the [[Archimedean property]] holds. *[[Ordered field]]: a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] whose ''S'' is [[linear order|totally ordered]] by '≤,' so that (''a''≤''b'')→(''a''+''c''≤''b''+''c'') and (0≤''a'',''b'')→ (0≤''ab''). ==Nonvarieties== Nonvarieties cannot be [[axiom]]atized solely with [[identity (mathematics)|identities]] and [[quasiidentity|quasiidentities]]. Many nonidentities are of three very simple kinds: #The requirement that ''S'' (or ''R'' or ''K'') be a "nontrivial" [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], namely one such that ''S''≠{0}, 0 being the additive [[identity element]]. The nearest thing to an identity implying ''S''≠{0} is the nonidentity 0≠1, which requires that the additive and multiplicative identities be distinct. #Axioms involving multiplication, holding for all members of ''S'' (or ''R'' or ''K'') except 0. In order for an algebraic structure to be a variety, the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of each operation must be an entire underlying set; there can be no [[partial operation]]s. #"0 is not the [[successor function|successor]] of anything," included in nearly all arithmetics. Most of the classic results of [[universal algebra]] do not hold for nonvarieties. For example, neither the [[free object|free field]] over any set nor the [[direct product]] of [[integral domain]]s exists. Nevertheless, nonvarieties often retain an undoubted algebraic flavor. There are whole classes of [[axiom]]atic [[formal system]]s not included in this section, e.g., [[logic]]s, [[topological space]]s, and this exclusion is in some sense arbitrary. Many of the nonvarieties below were included because of their intrinsic interest and importance, either by virtue of their foundational nature ([[Peano arithmetic]]), ubiquity (the [[real field]]), or richness (e.g., [[field (mathematics)|fields]], [[normed vector spaces]]). Also, a great deal of theoretical physics can be recast using the nonvarieties called [[multilinear algebra]]s. '''No''' operations. Functions or relations may be present: *[[Multiset]]: ''S'' is a multiset and '''N''' is the set of [[natural number]]s. There is a [[multiset|multifunction]] ''m'': ''S''→'''N''' such that ''m''(''x'') is the [[multiplicity]] of ''x''∈''S''. ===Arithmetics=== If the name of a structure in this section includes the word "arithmetic," the structure features one or both of the [[binary operation]]s [[addition]] and [[multiplication]]. If both operations are included, the recursive identity defining multiplication usually links them.
