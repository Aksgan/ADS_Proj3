manufactured in the outline of a mini-SIM card. Even smaller device sizes have prompted the development of a yet smaller card size, the ''3FF card'' or ''micro-SIM''. Micro-SIM cards have the same thickness and contact arrangement again, but the length and width are further reduced to 15 mm Ã— 12 mm. The specifications for the 3FF card or micro-SIM also include additional functionality beyond changing the physical card size. {{SIM card sizes}} ===Development of the micro-SIM === The micro-SIM was developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute along with SCP, 3GPP (UTRAN/GERAN), 3GPP2 (CDMA2000), ARIB, GSMAssociaton (GSMA SCaG and GSMNA), GlobalPlatform, Liberty Alliance, and the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) for the purpose of fitting into devices otherwise too small for a mini-SIM card.<ref name="ETSITechnicalCommittee">{{cite web|url=http://docbox.etsi.org//Workshop/2006/Salud%20Mexico/Gaby%20Lenhart%20-%20CENETEC_2006_04.ppt |title=The Smart Card Platform|publisher=''ETSI Technical Committee Smart Card Platform (TB SCP)''|date=2006-04-01|accessdate=30 January 2010|author=Gaby Lenhart, Project leader: ETSI Technical Committee Smart Card Platform (TB SCP)|authorlink=|quote=SCP is co-operating on both technical and service aspects with a number of other committees both within and outside the telecommunications sector.}}</ref><ref name="pcmag">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2358489,00.asp|title=Inside the iPad Lurks the 'Micro SIM'|publisher=''[[PC Magazine]]''|date=2010-01-27|accessdate=30 January 2010|last1=Segan |first1=Sascha |authorlink=http://www.pcmag.com/author_bio/0,1908,a=2974,00.as |quote=A SIM card is the little chip in a GSM cell phone that holds your subscriber information...}}</ref> The form factor was mentioned in the Dec 1998 [[3GPP]] SMG9 [[UMTS]] Working Party, which is the standards-setting body for GSM SIM cards,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/TSG_T/WG3_USIM/TSGT3_01/docs/t3-99003.pdf |title=DRAFT Report of the SMG9 UMTS Working Party, meeting #7 hosted by Nokia in Copenhagen, 15.-16- December 1998|publisher=''[[3GPP]]''|date=25 January 1999|accessdate=27 January 2010|quote=One manufacturer stated that it may be difficult to meeting ISO mechanical standards for a combined ID-1/micro-SIM card.}}</ref> and the form factor was agreed upon in late 2003.<ref name="SmartCardTrends">{{cite web|url=http://www.smartcardstrends.com/det_atc.php?idu=287|title=New form factor for smart cards introduced|publisher=''SmartCard Trends - The international Smart Security Industry Magazine''|date=2003-12-08|accessdate=30 January 2010|last1=Antipolis |first1=Sophia|authorlink=|quote=The work item for the so-called Third Form Factor, "3FF", was agreed, after intensive discussions, at the SCP meeting held last week in London.}}</ref> The micro-SIM was created with backwards compatibility in mind. The major issue with backwards compatibility was the contact area of the chip. Retaining the same contact area allows the micro-SIM to be compatible with the previous, larger SIM readers through the use of plastic cutout surrounds. The SIM was also designed to run at the same speed (5 MHz) as the previous version. The same size and positions of pins resulted in numerous "How-to" tutorials and YouTube video with detailed instructions how to cut a mini-SIM card to micro-SIM size with sharp knife or scissors. These tutorials became very popular among first owners of [[iPad]] 3G after its release on April 30, 2010 and [[iPhone 4]] on June 24, 2010.<ref name="CutMicroSIM">{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B0G_qjebJY|title=How to make MicroSIM}}</ref> The chairman of EP SCP, Dr. Klaus Vedder, said<ref name="SmartCardTrends"/> :"With this decision, we can see that ETSI has responded to a market need from ETSI customers, but additionally there is a strong desire not to invalidate, overnight, the existing interface, nor reduce the performance of the cards. EP SCP expect to finalise the technical realisation for the third form factor at the next SCP plenary meeting, scheduled for February 2004." == Usage in mobile phone standards == [[Image:Thuraya sim.jpeg|thumb|right|SIM card for [[Thuraya]] satellite phone]] The use of SIM cards is mandatory in [[GSM]] devices. The equivalent of a SIM in [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]] is called the Universal Integrated Circuit Card ([[UICC]]), which runs a [[Universal Subscriber Identity Module|USIM]] application, while the Removable User Identity Module ([[R-UIM]]) is more popular in [[Code division multiple access|CDMA]]-based devices e.g. [[CDMA2000]]. The UICC is still colloquially called a ''SIM card''. Many CDMA-based standards do not include any removable card, and the service is bound to a unique identifier contained in the handset itself. The [[satellite phone]] networks [[Iridium Satellite LLC|Iridium]], [[Thuraya]] and [[Inmarsat]]'s [[BGAN]] also use SIM cards. Sometimes these SIM cards work in regular GSM phones and also allow GSM customers to roam in satellite networks by using their own SIM card in a satellite phone. The SIM card introduced a new and significant business opportunity of mobile telecoms operator/carrier business of the mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) which does not own or operate a cellular telecoms network, but which leases capacity from one of the network operators, and only provides a SIM card to its customers. MVNOs first appeared in Denmark, Hong Kong, Finland and the UK and today exist in over 50 countries including most of Europe, USA, Canada, Australia and parts of Asia and account for approximately 10% of all mobile phone subscribers around the world. {{Globalize|date=October 2009}} On some networks, the mobile phone is [[SIM lock|locked to its carrier SIM card]], meaning that only the specific carrier's SIM cards will work. This is more common in markets where mobile phones are heavily subsidised by the carriers, and the business model depends on the the customer staying with the service provider for a minimum term (typically, 12 or 24 months). Common examples are the GSM networks in the USA, Canada, the UK and Poland. A plethora of [[online shopping|online]] and [[high-street]] (third-party) businesses now offer the ability to remove the SIM-lock from a phone, effectively making it possible to then use the phone on any network by inserting a different SIM card. Some of these resellers use wholeseller databases.<ref>such as unlockbase or unlockcodesource</ref> This is a useful benefit for travellers that might want to put a local SIM card into their phone when they arrive in a country, in order to minimize roaming charges. In many countries, now it is possible to buy a pre-pay SIM card just by walking into a store, and these SIM-only deals are a cost effective way to stay in contact when travelling. Phones sold as [[prepaid mobile phone|pre-pay]] often come with an operator subsidy, especially in competitive mobile markets like the UK. These phones are sold not just through mobile phone stores, but also supermarkets, catalogs, stationery outlets and online; thus the mobile companies are constantly competing to lower the price. Prepay phones come with a bundled SIM, which can be activated
