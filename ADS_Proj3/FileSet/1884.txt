a nonzero [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] of [[compact support]] (these include functions of compact support), then its Fourier transform is never compactly supported. This is a very elementary form of an [[uncertainty principle]] in a harmonic analysis setting. See also [[Convergence of Fourier series]]. Fourier series can be conveniently studied in the context of [[Hilbert space]]s, which provides a connection between harmonic analysis and [[functional analysis]]. ==Abstract harmonic analysis== One of the more modern branches of harmonic analysis, having its roots in the mid-twentieth century, is [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] on [[topological group]]s. The core motivating idea are the various [[Fourier transform]]s, which can be generalized to a transform of [[function (mathematics)|function]]s defined on Hausdorff [[local compactness|locally compact topological groups]]. The theory for [[abelian group|abelian]] locally [[compact group]]s is called [[Pontryagin duality]]; it is considered to be in a satisfactory state,{{Fact|date=September 2008}} as far as explaining the main features of harmonic analysis goes. Harmonic analysis studies the properties of that duality and Fourier transform; and attempts to extend those features to different settings, for instance to the case of non-abelian [[Lie group]]s. For general nonabelian locally compact groups, harmonic analysis is closely related to the theory of unitary group representations. For compact groups, the [[Peter-Weyl theorem]] explains how one may get harmonics by choosing one irreducible representation out of each equivalence class of representations. This choice of harmonics enjoys some of the useful properties of the classical Fourier transform in terms of carrying convolutions to pointwise products, or otherwise showing a certain understanding of the underlying [[Group (mathematics)|group]] structure. See also: [[Non-commutative harmonic analysis]]. If the group is neither abelian nor compact, no general satisfactory theory is currently known. By "satisfactory" one would mean ''at least'' the equivalent of [[Plancherel theorem]]. However, many specific cases have been analyzed, for example [[Special linear group|SL<sub>''n''</sub>]]. In this case, it turns out that [[Group representation|representations]] in infinite dimension play a crucial role. ==Other branches== *Study of the [[eigenvalue]]s and [[eigenvector]]s of the [[Laplacian]] on [[domain (mathematics)|domain]]s, [[manifold]]s, and (to a lesser extent) [[Graph (mathematics)|graph]]s is also considered a branch of harmonic analysis. See e.g., [[hearing the shape of a drum]]. * Harmonic analysis on Euclidean spaces deals with properties of the [[Fourier transform]] on '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> that have no analog on general groups. For example, the fact that the Fourier transform is invariant to rotations. Decomposing the Fourier transform to its radial and spherical components leads to topics such as [[Bessel function]]s and [[spherical harmonic]]s. See the book reference. * Harmonic analysis on tube domains is concerned with generalizing properties of [[Hardy space]]s to higher dimensions. ==References== *Elias Stein and Guido Weiss, ''Introduction to Fourier Analysis on Euclidean Spaces'', Princeton University Press, 1971.

The name "harmonic balance" is descriptive of the method, which starts with Kirchoff's Current Law written in the frequency domain and a chosen number of harmonics. Effectively the method assumes the solution can be represented by a linear combination of sinusoids, then balances current and voltage sinusoids to satisfy Kirchoff's law. The method is commonly used to simulate circuits which include [[nonlinear]] elements.<ref>{{cite book | last = Maas | first = Stephen A. | title = Nonlinear microwave and RF circuits | publisher = Artech House | year = 2003 | isbn = 1-58053-484-8 }}</ref> Microwave circuits were the original application for harmonic balance methods in electrical engineering. Microwave circuits were well-suited because, historically, microwave circuits consist of many linear components which can be directly represented in the frequency domain, plus a few nonlinear components. System sizes were typically small. For more general circuits, the method was considered impractical for all but these very small circuits until the mid-1990s, when Krylov subspace methods were applied to the problem.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Feldmann, P.; Melville, B.; Long, D. |title= Efficient frequency domain analysis of large nonlinear analog circuits |journal=Proceedings of the Custom Integrated Circuits Conference |year=1996 |pages=461&ndash;464 |doi = 10.1109/CICC.1996.510597}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Brachtendorf, H.G.; Welsch, G.; Laur, R. |title=Fast simulation of the steady-state of circuits by the harmonic balance technique |journal=Proceedings, International Symposium on Circuits and Systems |pages=1388 |year=1995 |doi=10.1109/ISCAS.1995.520406}}</ref> The application of preconditioned Krylov subspace methods allowed much larger systems to be solved, both in size of circuit and in numbers of harmonics. This made practical the present-day use of harmonic balance methods to analyze radio-frequency integrated circuits (RFICs). ==Algorithm== The algorithm starts with Kirchoff's current law written in the [[frequency-domain]]. To increase the efficiency of the procedure, the circuit may be partitioned into its linear and nonlinear parts, since the linear part is readily described and calculated using [[nodal analysis]] directly in the frequency domain. First, an initial guess is made for the solution, then an iterative process continues: # Voltages <math>V</math> are used
