was intended to simplify the [[porting]] of ([[assembly language]]) programs from [[CP/M]] to (the then-new) [[MS-DOS]]. When MS-DOS adopted the [[Xenix]]-like file interface of [[file handle]]s, FCBs became a legacy interface supported for backward compatibility. Because FCB compatibility has not been maintained, WordStar 3.x will not function properly on modern versions of Windows. In particular, WordStar 3.x cannot save files. One work-around is to use the [[DOSEMU]] emulator on Linux, which correctly implements the FCB interface. (The [[DOSBox]] emulator does not, even on [[Linux]].) WordStar 4.0 does not have this problem because it uses the newer MS-DOS interface for input/output. (OS/2 can run WordStar in a DOS session.) == WordStar emulation == Although no current version of WordStar is available for modern operating systems, some former WordStar users still prefer WordStar's interface, especially the cursor diamond commands described earlier in this article. These users claim less hand movement is necessary to issue commands, and hence that writing under this interface is more efficient. The user accesses the nearby Ctrl key and then a letter or combination of letters, thus keeping his hands on or close to the typing home row instead of moving them away from it to reach for a specialty key or a mouse. To accommodate these users, WordStar emulation programs were created. One such program is [http://web.archive.org/web/20091027004149/http://geocities.com/y_hagiya/ CtrlPlus] by Yoji Hagiya, which remaps the standard PC keyboard, making many WordStar commands available in most Windows programs. CtrlPlus switches the Control and Caps Lock keys so that the Ctrl key is back where it originally was on older keyboards, next to the A key. It also gives functionality to the chief cursor diamond commands mentioned in this article. The other WordStar emulation utility created was the [http://www.wordstar.org/wsemu/word/pages/index.htm WordStar Command Emulator for Microsoft Word], also known as "WordStar for Word," by Mike Petrie. Designed to work in conjunction with CtrlPlus, the Command Emulator adds many more WordStar commands to MS Word than CtrlPlus by itself, and also changes Word's menus to be more like those of WordStar 7.0 for DOS, the last MS DOS version of WordStar. For example, Ctrl+K? was WordStar's word count command and Ctrl+QL was its spell check command. Hitting these commands in the WordStar Emulator within Word runs Word's equivalent commands. WordStar for Word also adds WordStar's block commands, namely Ctrl+KB to mark the beginning of a block, Ctrl+KK to mark the end, and Ctrl+KV to move it. Alternatively, Ctrl+KC could be used to copy the block. The WordStar Command Emulator is written in Microsoft [[Visual Basic for Applications]], a [[macro programming language]] based on [[Visual Basic]] built into [[Microsoft Word]] to allow for a high level of customization. Most [[Word plug-ins]] are written in this language also known as VBA. The cross-platform [[Joe's Own Editor|Joe]] editor is a very WordStar-like alternative. When invoked as <code>jstar</code> Joe emulates many WordStar [[keybindings]]. == Filename extensions == * DOS WordStar files by default have no extension; some users adopted their own conventions, such as the letters WS followed by the version number (for example, WS3), or just plain WS. Backup files were automatically saved as BAKs. * ''WordStar for Windows'' files use the extension WSD * ''WordStar for Windows'' templates use the extension WST * ''WordStar for Windows'' macros use the extension WMC * ''WordStar for Windows'' temporary files use the extension !WS * ''WordStar 2000'' for DOS and UNIX PC do not have a fixed extension but DOC and WS2 were common Note: * There is no WordStar 2000 for Windows. * WordStar for Windows was also released under the name WordStar Personal Writer, and is a development of WordStar Legacy itself developed from a program called Legacy. [[XOOM]] also released a version of WordStar for Windows 2.0 called Xoom Word Pro. == See also == * [[List of word processors]] == References == {{reflist}} == External links == * [http://www.wordstar.org WordStar Resource Site] — featuring a full (as far as is known) history of WordStar * [http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=http://support.microsoft.com:80/support/kb/articles/Q212/2/65.ASP&NoWebContent=1 Microsoft Help & Support] — Microsoft's Office File Converter Pack installs additional text converters and graphics (image) filters.

'''Word wrap''' is the additional feature of most [[text editor]]s, [[word processors]], and [[web browser]]s, of breaking lines between and not within words, except when a single word is longer than a line. It is usually done [[on the fly]] when viewing or printing a document, so no line break code is manually entered, or stored.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} If the user changes the margins, the editor will either automatically reposition the line breaks to ensure that all the text will "flow" within the margins and remain visible, or provide the typist some convenient way to reposition the line breaks. A [[soft return]] is the break resulting from line wrap or word wrap, whereas a [[hard return]] is an intentional break, creating a new [[paragraph]]. ==Word boundaries, hyphenation, and hard spaces== The soft returns are usually placed after the ends of complete words, or after the punctuation that follows complete words. However, word wrap may also occur following a [[hyphen]]. Word wrap following hyphens is sometimes not desired, and can be avoided by using a so-called non-breaking hyphen instead of a regular hyphen. On the other hand, when using word processors, invisible hyphens, called soft hyphens, can also be inserted inside words so that word wrap can occur following the soft hyphens. Sometimes, word wrap is not desirable between words. In such cases, word wrap can usually be avoided by using a [[hard space]]
