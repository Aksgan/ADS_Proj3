which case that is the first transistorized computer and not the TRADIC. If neither can be called fully transistorized, then the CADET was the first ''fully'' transistorised computer in February 1955. Flyable TRADIC also incorporated a single high-power output vacuum-tube amplifier to supply clock power to the system. The designers originally devised a system clock using a crystal-controlled transistor oscillator driving a multitude of transistor amplifiers because each transistor was too low powered, but since the phase shift of the amplifiers could not be controlled to the required tolerances this had to be abandoned. So by the same criterion of incorporating vacuum tubes the flyable TRADIC was either not a fully transistorized computer, or followed the after the Manchester University Transistor Computer in 1953. In contrast, the operating requirements for the Flyable TRADIC included performing across a wide temperature range of -55°C (-67°F) to +55°C (+131°F). The TRADIC Phase One Computer had 684 Bell Labs Type 1734 Type A cartridge transistors and 10,358 germanium point-contact [[diode]]s. The TRADIC was small and light enough to be installed in a [[B-52 Stratofortress]]. It was a general-purpose computer. Programs for the TRADIC Phase One Computer were introduced via a removable plugboard, while the Flyable TRADIC used a Mylar sheet with punched holes — a system reminiscent of punched-card storage. TRADIC could perform a million logical operations every second, close to but not as fast the vacuum tube computers of the day, using its 1 MHz clock. It operated on less than 100 watts of power and it was much more reliable than its [[vacuum tube]] predecessors. ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.cedmagic.com/history/tradic-transistorized.html TRADIC - History of Media Technology] *[http://www.thocp.net/timeline/1952.htm#tradic TRADIC - History of Computing (1953)] *[http://library.thinkquest.org/18268/History/hist_c_50s.htm?tqskip1=1 "COMPUTERS - The 1950s" including a photo of TRADIC and TX-0.] *[http://www.auditmypc.com/acronym/TRADIC.asp TRADIC - brief] [[Category:Early computers]] [[Category:Military computers]] [[Category:Transistorized computers]] {{compu-stub}} [[de:TRADIC]] [[es:Tradic]] [[ru:TRADIC]] [[sr:TRADIC]]</text> </page> <page> <id>36720</id> <title>TRIPOS</title> <text>:''This article is about '''TRIPOS''', the [[operating system]].

Development started in [[1976]] at the [[University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory|Computer Laboratory]] of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] and it was headed by Dr. [[Martin Richards (computer scientist)|Martin Richards]]. The first version appeared in January 1978 and it originally ran on a [[PDP-11]]. Later it was ported to the [[Computer Automation LSI4]] and the [[Data General Nova]]. Work on a [[Motorola 68000]] version started in 1981 at the [[University of Bath]]. [[MetaComCo]] acquired the rights to the 68000 version and continued development until TRIPOS was chosen by [[Commodore Amiga]] in March 1985 to form part of an operating system for their new computer. ==Influences on the Amiga computer== In July 1985, the [[Amiga]] was introduced, incorporating TRIPOS in the [[AmigaDOS]] module of [[AmigaOS]]. AmigaDOS included a [[command line interface]] and the [[Amiga Old File System|Amiga File System]]. The entire AmigaDOS module was originally written in [[BCPL]] (an ancestor of the [[C programming language]]), the same language used to write TRIPOS. ==Features== TRIPOS provided features such as [[pre-emptive multi-tasking]] (using strict-priority scheduling), a hierarchical file system and multiple [[command line interpreter]]s. The most important TRIPOS concepts have been the non-memory-management approach (meaning no checks are performed to stop programs from using unallocated memory) and message passing by means of passing pointers instead of copying message contents. Those two concepts together allowed for sending and receiving over 1250 packets per second on a 10 MHz [[Motorola]] [[68010]] CPU. Most of TRIPOS was implemented in [[BCPL]]. The [[kernel (computers)|kernel]] and [[device driver]]s were implemented in [[assembly language]]. TRIPOS was ported to a number of machines, including the [[Data General Nova|Data General Nova 2]], the [[Computer Automation LSI4]], plus [[Motorola 68000]] and [[Intel 8086]]- based hardware. It included support for the [[Cambridge Ring]] [[local area network]]. More recently, Martin Richards produced a port of TRIPOS to run under [[Linux]], using BCPL Cintcode. TRIPOS is still actively maintained by [[Open G I]] Ltd. (formerly Misys Financial Systems) in Worcestershire, UK. Many British insurance brokers have a Motorola 68000 based (and latterly Linux/Intel based) TRIPOS system serving either [[Qume]] terminals or Qume [[terminal emulator]]s over a [[Telnet]] style [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] connection - the systems are used to run Open G I's BROOMS Application suite. Open G I have added a number of features to support the modern office such as the ability to print to Windows/[[SAMBA]] or [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] [[JetDirect]] printers, and [[XML]] Integration services. ==Cintpos== '''Cintpos''' is an experimental interpretive version of TRIPOS which runs on the Cintcode BCPL [[virtual machine]], also developed by Martin Richards. ==References== {{refbegin}} *''The TRIPOS Operating System'', M.
