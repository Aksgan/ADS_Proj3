beamline will vary with the application. At the end of the beamline is the experimental end station, where samples are placed in the line of the radiation, and detectors are positioned to measure the resulting [[diffraction]], scattering or secondary radiation. == Experimental techniques and usage == Synchrotron light is an ideal tool for many types of research and also has industrial applications. Some of the experimental techniques in synchrotron beamlines are: *[[Structural analysis]] of [[crystalline]] and [[amorphous]] materials *[[Powder diffraction]] analysis *[[Crystallography]] of [[protein]]s and other macromolecules *[[Magnetic scattering]] *[[Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS)|Small angle X-ray scattering]] *[[EXAFS|X-ray absorption spectroscopy]] *[[Inelastic X-ray scattering]] *[[Soft X-ray emission spectroscopy]] *[[Tomography]] *[[X-ray imaging]] in [[phase contrast]] mode *[[X-ray standing waves|X-ray standing wave]] experiments *[[Photolithography]] for [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] structures as part of the [[LIGA]] process. *[[High pressure]] studies *[[residual stress]] analysis *X-Ray Multiple Diffraction *[[Photoemission spectroscopy]] and [[Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy]] Some of the advantages of synchrotron light that allow for these practical uses are: *[[High energy X-rays]], short wavelength photons which can penetrate matter and interact with atoms. *High concentration, tunability and polarization thus ensuring focusing accuracy for even the smallest of targets. == Compact synchrotron light sources == Because of the usefulness of tuneable [[collimated light|collimated]] [[coherence (physics)|coherent]] X-ray radiation, efforts have been made to make smaller more economical sources of the light produced by synchrotrons. The aim is to make such sources available within a research laboratory for cost and convenience reasons; at present, researchers have to travel to a facility to perform experiments. One method of making a compact light source is to utilise the energy shift from [[Compton scattering]] near-visible laser photons from electrons stored at relatively low energies of tens of megaelectronvolts (see for example the Compact Light Source (CLS)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-03/lti-msp030106.php |title=Miniature synchrotron produces first light |publisher=Eurekalert.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-19}}</ref>). However, a relatively low cross-section of collision can be obtained in this manner, and the repetition rate of the lasers is limited to a few hertz rather than the megahertz repetition rates naturally arising in normal storage ring emission. Another method is to use plasma acceleration to reduce the distance required to accelerated electrons from rest to the energies required for UV or X-ray emission within magnetic devices. ==See also== *[[List of synchrotron radiation facilities]] *[[List of light sources]] ==References== <references/> ==External links== * [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7324564.stm Imaging ancient insects with synchrotron light source -- BBC] {{DEFAULTSORT:Synchrotron Light Source}} [[Category:Synchrotron radiation]] [[Category:Synchrotron-related techniques]] [[Category:Particle physics]] [[Category:Light]] [[Category:Light sources]] [[Category:Materials testing]] [[it:Radiazione di sincrotrone]] [[th:แสงซินโครตรอน]] [[zh:同步辐射光源]] [[ja:放射光]]</text> </page> <page> <id>36410</id> <title>Syntactic Structures</title> <text>{{ infobox Book | name = Syntactic Structures | title_orig = | translator = | image = <!-- include the [[file:]] and the image size --> | image_caption = | author = [[Noam Chomsky]] | illustrator = | cover_artist = | language = [[English language|English]] | series = | subject = [[Natural language]] [[syntax]] | genre = | publisher = [[Mouton de Gruyter|Mouton & Co.]] | pub_date = February 1957 (1st Edition) | english_pub_date = | media_type = | pages = 117 | isbn = | oclc = | preceded_by = | followed_by = }} '''''Syntactic Structures''''' is an influential book by American linguist [[Noam Chomsky]], first published in 1957. Widely regarded as one of the most important texts in the field of [[linguistics]],<ref>Lees 1957, Robins 1967, Searle 1972, Newmeyer 1996, and Cook 2007</ref> this work laid the foundation of Chomsky's idea of [[transformational grammar]]. The book contains the well-known example of a sentence that is completely grammatical, yet allegedly completely nonsensical in "[[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously]]."<ref>Chomsky 1957:15</ref> The publishing of ''Syntactic Structures'' is believed by many academics to be a watershed moment in the annals of modern linguistics. In a favorable and highly influential review of the book, linguist [[Robert Lees (linguist)|Robert Lees]] wrote: {{cquote|Chomsky's book on syntactic structures is one of the first serious attempts on the part of a linguist to construct within the tradition of theory-construction a comprehensive theory of language which may be understood in the same sense that a chemical, biological theory is ordinarily understood by experts in those fields. It's not a mere reorganization of the data into a new kind of library catalog, nor another speculative philosophy about the nature of Man and Language, but a rather rigorous explanation of our intuitions about language in terms of an overt axiom system, the theorems derivable from it, explicit results which may be compared with new data and other intuitions, all based plainly on an overt theory of the internal structure of languages.<ref> Lees 1957 </ref>}} ==Background== Chomsky had an interest in language and grammar from a very young age. His father [[William Chomsky]] was one of the foremost [[Hebrew]] grammarians in the world. At the tender age of twelve, Chomsky read an early form of his father's '' David Kimhi's Hebrew Grammar (Mikhlol)'' (1952), an annotated study of a thirteenth-century Hebrew grammar.<ref>Barsky 1997: 10</ref> In 1945, sixteen-year-old Chomsky started his undergraduate studies at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. There during his freshman year, he studied [[Arabic]] and was the only student to do so.<ref>Barsky 1997: 47</ref> In 1947, Chomsky met [[Zellig Harris]], a prominent [[Leonard Bloomfield|Bloomfieldian]] linguist of that time. Harris founded that very year the first ever modern linguistics department of the United States at the University of Pennsylvania. Chomsky became very close to Harris and proofread the manuscript of Harris's ''Methods in Structural Linguistics'' (1951). This was Chomsky's introduction to formal, theoretical [[linguistics]] and soon he decided to major in the subject.<ref>Barsky 1997: 49-50</ref> For his undergraduate thesis, Chomsky set off to apply Harris's methods of structural analysis to Hebrew, the language he studied with his father in his childhood. At Harris's suggestion Chomsky began studying [[logic]], [[philosophy]], and [[foundations of mathematics]]. He was particularly influenced by American philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]]'s work on constructional systems and on the inadequacy of inductive approaches. He found striking similarities between Harris's perspective on language and Goodman's perspective on philosophical systems. Chomsky was equally influenced by American philosopher [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]'s critiques of [[logical
