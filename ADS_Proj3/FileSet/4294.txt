For a surface which is the [[boundary (topology)|topological boundary]] of a set in three dimensions, one can distinguish between the '''inward-pointing normal''' and '''outer-pointing normal''', which can help define the normal in a unique way. For an [[Orientability|oriented surface]], the surface normal is usually determined by the [[right-hand rule]]. If the normal is constructed as the cross product of tangent vectors (as described in the text above), it is a [[pseudovector]]. ==Transforming normals== When applying a transform to a surface it is sometimes convenient to deriving normals for the resulting surface from the original normals. All points ''P'' on tangent plane are transformed to ''P&prime;''. We want to find '''n&prime;''' perpendicular to ''P''. Let '''t''' be a vector on the tangent plane and ''M<sub>l</sub>'' be the upper 3x3 matrix (translation part of transformation does not apply to normal or tangent vectors). :<math>t' = M_l \times t</math> :<math>n^T \times t = n^T \times M_l^{-1} M_l \times t</math> :<math>n^T \times t = n^T \times M_l^{-1} M_l \times t = (M_l^{-1T} \times n)^T (M_l \times t)</math> :<math>n^T \times t = (M_l^{-1T} \times n)^T \times t'</math> :<math>n' = M_l^{-1T} \times n</math> So use the inverse transpose of the linear transformation (the upper 3x3 matrix) when transforming surface normals. ==Uses== *Surface normals are essential in defining [[surface integral]]s of [[vector field]]s. *Surface normals are commonly used in [[3D computer graphics]] for [[lighting]] calculations; see [[Lambert's cosine law]]. *Surface normals are often adjusted in [[3D computer graphics]] by [[normal mapping]]. *[[Render layers]] containing surface normal information may be used in [[Digital compositing]] to change the apparent lighting of rendered elements. ==Normal in geometric optics== {{main|Specular reflection}} [[Image:Reflection angles.svg|frame|Diagram of specular reflection]] The '''normal''' is an imaginary line [[perpendicular]] to the surface<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.glenbrook.k12.il.us/gbssci/phys/Class/refln/u13l1c.html |title= The Law of Reflection |accessdate=2008-03-31 |work= The Physics Classroom Tutorial }}</ref> of an [[optical medium]]. The word normal is used here in the mathematical sense, meaning perpendicular. In [[reflection of light]], the [[angle of incidence]] is the angle between the normal and the [[incident ray]]. The [[angle of reflection]] is the angle between the normal and the [[reflected ray]]. ==See also== * [[Pseudovector]] * [[Dual space]] ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== * An [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb324491(VS.85).aspx explanation of normal vectors] from Microsoft's MSDN * Clear pseudocode for [http://www.opengl.org/wiki/Calculating_a_Surface_Normal calculating a surface normal] from either a triangle or polygon. * Some [http://www.shakeartist.com/shaketools/ instructional videos and a free tool] for performing normals-based relighting.
