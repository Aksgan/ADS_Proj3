One vendor known to do this is Fujitsu-Siemens Computers. Adding different memory module to the system usually results in a refusal or other counter-measures (like pressing F1 on every boot, very problematic for a server which usually reboots without user intervention). <pre> 02 0E 00 01-00 00 00 EF-02 03 19 4D-BC 47 C3 46 ...........M.G.F 53 43 00 04-EF 4F 8D 1F-00 01 70 00-01 03 C1 CF SC...O....p..... </pre> This is the output of a 512 MB memory module from Micron Technologies, branded for Fujitsu-Siemens Computers, note the "FSC" string. Memory modules which do not have this information starting at offset 128h will be refused by the BIOS of the system. ==Reading and writing SPD information== Memory module manufacturers write the SPD information to the [[EEPROM]] on the module. Motherboard [[BIOS]]es read the SPD information to configure the memory controller. There exist several programs that are able to read and modify SPD information on most, but not all motherboard chipsets. * [http://www.nongnu.org/dmidecode/ dmidecode] program that can decode information about memory (and other things) and runs on [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD]], [[OpenBSD]], [[BeOS]], [[Cygwin]] and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]]. dmidecode does not access SPD information directly; it reports the BIOS data about the memory.<ref>http://www.linux.com/archive/articles/40412 dmidecode: What's it good for?</ref> This information may be limited or incorrect. * On [[Linux]] systems, the [[user space]] program decode-dimms.pl<ref>http://www.lm-sensors.org/browser/i2c-tools/trunk/eeprom/decode-dimms decode-dimms.pl Perl program</ref> provided with [[lm-sensors|lm_sensors]] <ref>http://www.lm-sensors.org/</ref> decodes and prints information on any memory with SPD information in the computer. On more recent Linux distributions, decode-dimms is available as part of i2c-tools. * OpenBSD has included a driver ([http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=spdmem&sektion=4 spdmem(4)]) since version 4.3 to provide information about memory modules. The driver was ported from NetBSD, where it is available since release 5.0. * [[Coreboot]] reads and uses SPD information to initialize all [[memory controller]]s in a computer with timing, size and other properties. * On [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] systems, there are programs like [http://www.hwinfo.com/ HWiNFO32] and [http://www.cpuid.com/ CPU-Z] which are capable of reading and displaying DRAM module information from SPD. Chipset independent reading and writing of SPD information is done by accessing the memory's eeprom directly with eeprom programmer hard- and software. ==On older equipment== {{Off-topic|Parallel Presence Detect|date=September 2010}} <!-- 72-pin SIMMs had parallel, not serial, presence detect. --> Some older equipment require the use of [[SIMM]]s with SPD (more commonly called simply ''presence detect'' or PD). Some of this equipment uses non-standard PD coding; [[IBM]] computers and [[Hewlett-Packard]] [[LaserJet]] and other printers in particular. While old computers are rarely found, many old Laserjet printers are in use. Discontinued HP memory modules are officially recommended, but any 72-pin SIMM module within the capacity range supported by the printer and with the correct PD code should work. All printers will work with FPM (Fast Page Mode) memory; it is
