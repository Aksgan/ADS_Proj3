misère play). This follows from calculating the [[nim-sequence]] of ''S''(1,2,...,''k''), : <math>0.123\ldots k0123\ldots k0123\dots = \dot0.123\ldots\dot{k}, \, </math> from which the strategy above follows by the [[Sprague–Grundy theorem]]. === The 21 game === The game "21" is played as a misère game with any number of players who take turns saying a number. The first player says "1" and each player in turn increases the number by 1, 2, or 3, but may not exceed 21; the player forced to say "21" loses. This can be modeled as a subtraction game with a heap of 21&ndash;''n'' objects.<br/> The winning strategy for this game is to say a multiple of 4 and after that it is guaranteed that the other player will have to say 21, barring a mistake from the first player.<br/> This game is a [[zero game]], i.e, it is biased in favor of the 2nd player as s/he can get to 4 first and then control the game from there, as no matter what, the 1st player will never be able to say a multiple of 4 as s/he is only allowed increments of either 1, 2 or 3.<br/> Proof (via a sample game)-<br/><br/> Player Number 1 1 2 4 1 5,6 or 7 2 8 1 9,10 or 11 2 12 1 13,14 or 15 2 16 1 17,18 or 19 2 20 1 21 === A multiple-heap rule === {{See also|Wythoff's game}} In another variation of Nim, besides removing any number of objects from a single heap, one is permitted to remove the same number of objects from each heap. === Circular Nim === {{See also|Kayles}} Yet another variation of Nim is 'Circular Nim', where any number of objects are placed in a circle, and two players alternately remove 1, 2 or 3 adjacent objects. For example, starting with a circle of ten objects, . . . . . . . . . . three objects be taken in the first move _ . . . . . . . _ _ then another three _ . _ _ _ . . . _ _ then one _ . _ _ _ . . _ _ _ but then three objects cannot be taken out in one move. === Grundy's game === In [[Grundy's game]], another variation of Nim, a number of objects are placed in an initial heap, and two players alternately divide a heap into two nonempty heaps of different sizes. Thus, 6 objects may be divided into piles of 5+1 or 4+2, but not 3+3. Grundy's game can be played as either misère or normal play. === Greedy Nim === See [[Greedy Nim]]. == See also == * [[Dr. NIM]] * [[Fuzzy game]] * [[Nimber]] * [[Nimrod (computing)]] * [[Octal games]] * [[Solved board games]] * [[Star (game)]] * [[Subtract a square]] * [[Zero game]] * [[Pawn duel]] * [[NIMROD]] * [[Android Nim]] == References == * W.
