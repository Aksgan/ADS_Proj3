2003''. ==Variations== Many variations of DISCUS are presented in related literature. One such popular scheme is the ''Channel Code Partitioning'' scheme, which is an a-priori scheme, to reach the [[Slepian-Wolf bound]]. Many papers illustrate simulations and experiments on channel code partitioning using the [[turbo codes]], [[Hamming code]]s and [[IRA Code|Irregular Repeat Accumulate Codes]]. === See also === * [[Modulo-N code]] is a simpler technique for compressing correlated data sources. * [[Distributed source coding]] === External links === * [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=755665 "Distributed source coding using syndromes (DISCUS): design and construction" by Pradhan, S.S. and Ramchandran, K.] * [http://www2.parc.com/spl/projects/cosense/csp/slides/Ramchandran.pdf "DISCUS: Distributed Compression for Sensor Networks"] * [[Distributed Source Coding]] can also be implemented [http://ivms.stanford.edu/~amaaron/dsc/index.htm using Convolutional Codes or using Turbo Codes] [[Category:Information theory]] [[Category:Wireless sensor network]] {{compsci-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>9014</id> <title>DJ Tutor</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=January 2011}} '''DJ Tutor''' is the title given to Johnathan Lewis, and to the online community of [[DJ]]s that he inspired through his [[Youtube]] channel "ellaskins". == Background == Johnathan's rough and ready, punk TV style was a contrast to the slick image that DJs were presenting previously. His tutorial videos for beginners have started the careers of many professional DJs.<ref>"[http://www.myspace.com/djpetermorgan DJ Peter Morgan]"</ref><ref>"[http://www.myspace.com/djbrettland DJ Brettland]"</ref><ref>"[http://syntse.harder.fi/bio.html Harder Fi]"</ref><ref>"[http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=bamanda2 DJ Ama]"</ref><ref>"[http://www.youtube.com/djarkitech DJ Arkitech]"</ref> Thousands of new and experienced DJs have responded with videos and comments, so that DJ Tutor has become a social network for DJs from all over the world. Johnathan's catchphrase "Practise and N_Joy" has entered the DJ vocabulary.<ref>"[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-3-Nl1Vmaw Grandmaster Flash interview]"</ref><ref>"[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NRjoNZ_caE Sugar Hill Gang, Coolio and DJ Kool interviews]"</ref><ref>"[http://www.ytdjs.com/ Youtube DJs]"</ref><ref>"[http://funktiondjs.com/Funktion-blog(1595427).htm Funktion blog]"</ref><ref>"[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tpNA1xcN8w Dj Fi:T]"</ref> == Johnathan Lewis== Johnathan grew up in [[Borth]], near [[Aberystwyth]], and still lives and works in [[West Wales]]. He started working as a professional [[DJ]] in 1984. Clubs and hotels he worked in include Starlight ([[New York]]), Tiffany's ([[Oslo]]) and the Continental Hotel ([[Isle of Man]]). He also presented his own show "Phatbeats FM" on [[Radio Ceredigion]], as well as running a mobile roadshow. == History == In September 2006 Johnathan discovered Youtube, and started posting comedy videos, and drum tutorials. In October 2006 Johnathan noticed the lack of DJ tutorials, and decided to fill the gap. Encouraged by the response, he singlehandedly produced several DJ videos a day. In 2007, the DJ Tutor website was launched, and DJ Tutor became a limited company. DJs were asked to post their own ten minute mix videos, which they did in thousands, and this led to the first ever online video DJ mix competition. DJ Tutor ran the [[DJ Mag]] Micromix competition,<ref>"[http://www.olddjmag.com/?op=story&story_op=display&story_id=723&status=Live&word=&page= DJ Mag Micromix Competition]"</ref> plus several other competitions. DJ equipment manufacturers started to send products for use in the videos, and embedded the videos and links in their own websites.<ref>"[http://www.djsounds.com/taxonomy/term/721 Pioneer - DJ Sounds]"</ref><ref>"[http://www.kam.co.uk/index.php?action=product&product_id=340 Kam]"</ref> The Youtube channel "ellaskins" was included in the book Youtube For Dummies.<ref>Doug Sahlin, Chris Botello, ''Wiley Publishing'' ISBN 978-0470149256</ref> Johnathan has contributed articles to [[DJ Mag]], [[Mixmag]] and Pro Mobile. Other DJs began to contribute, notably Brian Redd, John Beck and DJ Angelo. Johnathan was invited to the BPM show, [[Musikmesse]], and Mobile Beat Las Vegas, and became a Tutor at [[Ministry of Sound]] DJ Academy.<ref>"[http://djacademy.ministryofsound.com/djs.asp Ministry of Sound DJ Academy]"</ref> He has taught DJing for [[BBC Blast]] and DJ Tutor is on the [[BBC]]'s list of music learning resources.<ref>"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/learning/subjects/music.shtml BBC learning resources,]"</ref> On 2 October 2010, DJ Tutor and BPM Show attempted to break the [[Guinness Book of Records]] world record for longest DJ mix. The attempt was unsuccessful. == References == <!--- See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically --> {{Reflist}} == External links == * [http://www.djtutor.com DJ Tutor website] * [http://www.youtube.com/ellaskins ellaskins Youtube channel] * [http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/mid/sites/mystory/pages/jonathanlewis.shtml BBC Radio Wales Article] * [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7749749.stm BBC Radio Wales Interview] <!--- Categories ---> {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME = Dj Tutor | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH = | PLACE OF BIRTH = | DATE OF DEATH = | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Dj Tutor}} [[Category:Music education]] [[Category:Online music education]] [[Category:Basic Concepts in Music Education]] [[Category:Music lesson]] [[Category:DJing]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:Electronic dance music]] [[Category:Social networks]] [[Category:Dance music magazines]] [[Category:Social network services]] [[Category:Online video]]</text> </page> <page> <id>9023</id> <title>DMExpress</title> <text>'''DMExpress''' is an [[Extract, transform, load|ETL]] tool designed primarily for performance. It processes data using proprietary algorithms instead of the database engine. It is able to generate code in C, C++, Visual Basic, Kornshell and SQL to carry out ETL tasks <ref>[http://products.databasejournal.com/dbtools/dar/1099337641.html Database tools - DMExpress]</ref>. It can integrate from multiple sources to multiple targets, and supports all the major database engines, including [[Oracle database|Oracle]], [[Sybase]], [[IBM DB2|DB2]], [[Informix]], [[Microsoft SQL Server]] and [[Teradata]]. Released in November 2004, DMExpress uses "patented algorithms, state-of-the-art parallel processing technology, and dynamic optimization" to achieve high performance (press release). It "extracts data at very high speed from any source database or flat file, applies any kind of record level transformation and/or field level transformation, and then loads the data into any target database or flat file". The speed comes primarily from highly specialised sorting technology previously developed by the company and adapted to the task of ETL<ref>[http://www.decideo.fr/DMExpress,-un-ETL-pointu-propose-par-Syncsort-plutot-pour-les-grandes-entreprises_a1101.html ETL with DMExpress]</ref>. On November 14, 2008, DMExpress set a world record for ETL performance by extracting, transforming, cleansing, and loading 5.4 TB of data into a [[Vertica]] Analytic Database on a c-Class [[HP]] BladeSystem in 57 minutes <ref>[http://www.vertica.com/_pdf/ETL-World-Record-Audit-Report.pdf ETL Database Load Benchmark: Full Disclosure Report (November 14, 2008)]</ref><ref>[http://www.betanews.com/newswire/pr/Syncsort_and_Vertica_Shatter_Database_ETL_World_Record_Using_HP_BladeSystem_cClass/153209 BetaNews Newswire (December 2, 2008)]</ref>. [[Microsoft]] and [[Unisys]] set the previous ETL world record at 2.36 TB/hr in early 2008 <ref>[http://blogs.msdn.com/sqlperf/archive/2008/02/27/etl-world-record.aspx SQL Server Performance: ETL World Record!
