The reverse could be true (under reasonable conditions, being that the system should have labelled files, etc.) except for the "No classified information at startup" exceptions noted below. However, non-interference has been shown to be stronger than [[non-deducibility]]. This strictness comes with a price. It is very difficult to make a computer system with this property. There may be only one or two commercially available products that have been verified to comply with this policy, and these would essentially be as simple as switches and one-way information filters (although these could be arranged to provide useful behaviour). ===No classified information at startup=== If the computer has (at time=0) any high (i.e., classified) information within it, or low users create high information subsequent to time=0 (so-called "write-up," which is allowed by many computer security policies), then the computer can legally leak all that high information to the low user, and can still be said to comply with the non-interference policy. The low user will not be able to learn anything about high user activities, but can learn about any high information that was created through means other than the actions of high users.(von Oheimb 2004) Computer systems that comply with the Bell-LaPadula Model do not suffer from this problem since they explicitly forbid "read-up." Consequently, a computer system that complies with non-interference will not necessarily comply with the Bell-LaPadula Model. Thus, the [[Bell–LaPadula model]] and the non-interference model are incomparable: the Bell-LaPadula Model is stricter regarding read-up, and the non-interference model is stricter with respect to [[covert channels]]. ===No summarisation=== Some legitimate multilevel security activities treat individual data records (e.g., personal details) as sensitive, but allow statistical functions of the data (e.g., the mean, the total number) to be released more widely. This cannot be achieved with a non-interference machine. ==References== {{reflist}} ==Further reading== * {{cite encyclopedia | last = McLean | first = John | title = Security Models | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Software Engineering | volume = 2 | pages = 1136–1145 | publisher = John Wiley & Sons, Inc | location = New York | date = 1994 }} * {{cite conference | first = David | last = von Oheimb | authorlink = David von Oheimb | title = Information Flow Control Revisited: Noninfluence = Noninterference + Nonleakage | booktitle = European Symposium on Research in Computer Security (ESORICS) | pages = 225–243 | publisher = LNCS, Springer-Verlag | date = 2004 | location = Sophia Antipolis, France}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Non-Interference (Security)}} [[Category:Computer security models]]</text> </page> <page> <id>26572</id> <title>Non-native speech database</title> <text>{{Cleanup|date=September 2008}} A '''non-native speech database''' is a [[Speech corpus|speech database]] of [[non-native pronunciations of English]]. Such databases are essential for the ongoing development of multilingual automatic [[speech recognition]] systems, [[Text-to-speech|text to speech]] systems, pronunciation trainers or even fully featured [[Computer-assisted language learning|second language learning systems]]. Because of the comparably small size of the databases, however, many of them are not available through the common distributors of speech databases. This leads to the fact that it is hard for researchers in speech recognition to keep an overview of what kind of databases have already been collected, and for what purposes there are still no collections. This article is based on a paper from the ASRU speech conference [[#38]]. The paper wanted to provide a useful resource regarding the issue above. This online article is intended to provide a place where information about non-native speech databases can be updated continuously by the speech research community. == Legend == In the table of non-native databases some abbreviations for language names are used. They are listed in Table 1. Table 2 gives the following information about each corpus: The name of the corpus, the institution where the corpus can be obtained, or at least further information should be available, the language which was actually spoken by the speakers, the number of speakers, the native language of the speakers, the total amount of non-native utterances the corpus contains, the duration in hours of the non-native part, the date of the first public reference to this corpus, some free text highlighting special aspects of this database and a reference to another publication. The reference in the last field is in most cases to the paper which is especially devoted to describe this corpus by the original collectors. In some cases it was not possible to identify such a paper. In these cases a paper is referenced which is using this corpus is. Some entries are left blank and others are marked with unknown. The difference here is that blank entries refer to attributes where the value is just not known. Unknown entries, however, indicate that no information about this attribute is available in the database itself. As an example, in the Jupiter weather database [[#1]] no information about the origin of the speakers is given. Therefore this data would be less useful for verifying accent detection or similar issues. Where possible, the name is a standard name of the corpus, for some of the smaller corpora, however, there was no established name and hence an identifier had to be created. In such cases, a combination of the institution and the collector of the database is used. In the case where the databases contain native and non-native speech, only attributes of the non-native part of the corpus are listed. Most of the corpora are collections of read speech. If the corpus instead consists either partly or completely of spontaneous utterances,
