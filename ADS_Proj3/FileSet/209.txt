first chairman of probability theory at the [[Moscow State University]]. In 1939, he was elected a full member (academician) of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|USSR Academy of Sciences]]. In a 1938 paper, Kolmogorov "established the basic theorems for smoothing and predicting stationary [[stochastic processes]]" — a paper that would have major military applications during the [[Cold War]] to come.<ref>Salsburg, p. 139.</ref> Around the same years (1936) Kolmogorov contributed to the field of ecology and generalized the [[Lotka-Volterra]] model of [[predator-prey]] systems. In his study of [[stochastic processes]] (random processes), especially [[Markov process]]es, Kolmogorov and the [[British people|British]] mathematician [[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Sydney Chapman]] independently developed the pivotal set of equations in the field, the [[Chapman–Kolmogorov equation]]s.

In [[classical mechanics]], he is best known for the [[Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem]] (first presented in 1954 at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]]). In 1957 he solved [[Hilbert's thirteenth problem]] (a joint work with his student [[V. I. Arnold]]). He was a founder of [[algorithmic complexity theory]], often referred to as [[Kolmogorov complexity|Kolmogorov complexity theory]], which he began to develop around this time. Kolmogorov was married to Anna Dmitrievna Egorova in 1942. He pursued a vigorous teaching routine throughout his life, not only at the university level but also with younger children, as he was actively involved in developing a pedagogy for gifted children, in literature, and in music, as well as in mathematics. At the Moscow State University, Kolmogorov occupied different positions, including the heads of several departments: [[probability]], [[statistics]], and [[random process]]es; [[mathematical logic]]; and he also served as the Dean of the Moscow State University Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics. In 1971, Kolmogorov joined an [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] expedition aboard the research vessel '''Dmitri Mendeleev'''. He wrote a number of articles for the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]].'' In his later years he devoted much of his effort to the mathematical and philosophical relationship between [[probability theory]] in abstract and applied areas.<ref>Salsburg, pp. 145&ndash;7.</ref> Kolmogorov died in Moscow in 1987. A quotation, "Every mathematician believes he is ahead over all others. The reason why they don't say this in public, is because they are intelligent people" is attributed to him. ==Bibliography== A bibliography of his works appeared in {{cite journal|year=1989|month=July|title=Publications of A.
