Privacy International director Simon Davies said that the organization had filed the complaint due to the "clear embarrassment and damage" Street View had caused to many [[British people|Briton]]s. He said that Street View fell short of the assurances given by Google to the ICO in July 2008 that had enabled its launch, namely that privacy would be protected by blurring faces and vehicle licence plates, and asked for the system to be "switched off" while an investigation was completed. He said the few cases where Google's face blurring system had failed meant the data used by Street View would fall under UK [[Privacy|Data Protection]] legislation, which requires that subjects give permission for the use of information concerning them.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Call to 'shut down' Street View | work=| publisher=BBC News | date = March 24, 2009 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7959362.stm | doi = | accessdate = }}</ref> Davies subsequently sent an open letter to Google chief executive [[Eric Schmidt]], accusing the company of briefing journalists against him, claiming Davies was biased in favour of [[Microsoft]]. Google has pointed to connections between Microsoft and data protection consultancy ''[[80/20 Thinking]]'', run by Davies, and has said that Davies' connections to Microsoft should be made clear in public, as the credibility of his criticisms is undermined by the fact that he acts as a consultant to companies who are direct rivals and critics of Google, a fact Davies rarely discloses in press releases or comments.<ref>{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Google 'trying to smear Street View critic' | newspaper=[[Belfast Telegraph]] | pages = | year = | date = March 28, 2009 | url = http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/technology-gadgets/google-trying-to-smear-street-view-critic-14247255.html | accessdate = April 1, 2009}}</ref> However, on April 23, 2009, the Information Commissioner ruled that although Google Street View carries a small risk of privacy invasion it should not be stopped. They ruled that "There is no law against anyone taking pictures of people in the street as long as the person using the camera is not harassing people". They also ruled that Google Street View does not contravene the Data Protection Act, as an image of a house held on Street View is not a data protection matter, as data protection is about people's personal information.<ref>{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Common sense on Street View must prevail, says the ICO | newspaper=[[Information Commissioner]] | pages = | year = | date = April 23, 2009 | url = http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/pressreleases/2009/google_streetview_220409_v2.pdf | accessdate = April 1, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = All clear for Google Street View | work=| publisher=BBC News | date = April 23, 2009 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8014178.stm | doi = | accessdate = }}</ref> On April 3, 2009, it was reported in the press that residents of the village of [[Broughton, Milton Keynes|Broughton]] in [[Buckinghamshire]] formed a human barrier to stop a Google car from photographing the village,<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1167211/A-English-revolt-sees-Googles-spies.html A very English revolt sees off Google's spies] Mail Online</ref> expressing fears that it was "invading the villagers' privacy" and "facilitating crime".<ref>[http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article2357834.ece Raid-fear villagers halt Google Street View Car], ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]] Online'', 03/04/2009</ref> As also reported in the press, contrary reactions have come from some Internet users, who have called on people to "descend on the village to snap their own perfectly legal photographs".<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1166722/Watch-Broughton-Street-View-fans-plan-descend-privacy-village-photo-fest.html Watch out Broughton!
