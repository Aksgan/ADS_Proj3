enforcement and security agencies, including the [[Canada Border Services Agency]] and the [[Canadian Air Transport Security Authority]]. ===SIGINT=== CSEC’s SIGINT program produces intelligence that responds to Canadian government requirements. At [[CFS Leitrim]], the main SIGINT coalation CSEC facility in the south end of Ottawa, the establishment collects foreign intelligence that can be used by the government for strategic warning, policy formulation, decision-making in the fields of [[national security]] and national defence, and day-to-day assessment of foreign capabilities and intentions. The station at Leitrim specializes in intercepting electronic communications to and from embassies in Ottawa. Other CSEC SIGINT facilities are located at: [[CFB Gander]] Newfoundland with a detachment from CFS Leitrim, CFS Masset, BC (under remote control from CFS Leitrim) and [[CFS Alert]], [[Nunavut]]. The success of this process is founded on CSEC’s understanding of the leading-edge technologies used by the global information infrastructure. CSEC relies on its closest foreign intelligence allies, the US, UK, Australia and New Zealand to share the collection burden and the resulting intelligence yield. [[Canada]] is a substantial beneficiary of the collaborative effort within the partnership to collect and report on foreign communications. During the [[Cold War]], CSEC’s primary client for signals intelligence was National Defence, and its focus was the [[military operations]] of the then [[Soviet Union]]. Since the end of the Cold War, Government of Canada requirements have evolved to include a wide variety of political, defence, and security issues of interest to a much broader range of client departments. While these continue to be key intelligence priorities for Government of Canada decision-makers, increasing focus on protecting the safety of Canadians is prompting greater interest in intelligence on transnational issues, including [[terrorism]]. ====Code Breaking Equipment==== CSE code breaking capabilities degraded substantially in the sixties and seventies but were upgraded with the acquisition of a Cray X-MP/11 (modified) supercomputer delivered to the Sir Leonard Tilley building in March 1985 and the hiring of code breaking analysts. It was, at the time, the most powerful computer in Canada. In the early 1990s, the Establishment purchased a Floating Point Systems FPS 522-EA supercomputer at a cost of $1,620,371. This machine was upgraded to a Cray S-MP superserver after Cray acquired Floating Point Systems in December in 1991 and used the Folklore Operating System supplied by the NSA in the US.<ref>http://luxexumbra.blogspot.com/2008_06_01_archive.html</ref> These machines are now retired. Little information is available on the types of computers used by the CSEC since then. However, Cray in the US has produced a number of improved supercomputers since then. These include the Cray SX-6, early 2000s, the [[Cray X1]], 2003 (development funded in part by the NSA), [[Cray XD1]], 2004, Cray XT3, [[Cray XT4]], 2006, Cray XMt, 2006 and Cray CX1, 2008. It is possible that some of these models have been used by the CSEC and are in use today. -note: Distinctions should be made between Cray Research, Inc (acquired by SGI) and Cray Computer (a different company founded by Seymour Cray after he left Cray Research. ===IT Security=== Formerly known as [[communications security]] (COMSEC), the CSEC’s IT Security Program grew out of a need to protect [[sensitive information]] transmitted by various agencies of the government, especially the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade]] (DFAIT), [[Canada Border Services Agency]] (CBSA), DND, and the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP). As a result of this critical and urgent need, the IT Security program’s strategic stance has made possible a shift to that of a predictive nature allowing the program to provide relevant knowledge based upon sound practices and forward looking solutions. The CSEC’s IT Security Program has earned highly valued global respect and a reputation of technical excellence. It now extends its expertise past its traditional technical clients to those within the Government of Canada who are responsible for the formulation and implementation of policy and program managers, and is committed to ensuring cyber networks and critical infrastructures are trustworthy and secure. CSEC also conducts research and development on behalf of the Government of Canada in fields related to communications security. ==Mandate== In December 2001 the Canadian government passed omnibus [[Canadian Anti-Terrorism Act|bill C-36]] into law as the [[Canadian Anti-Terrorism Act|Anti-terrorism Act]]. The new act amended portions of the [[National Defence Act]] and officially recognized CSEC's three-part mandate: * To acquire and use information from the global information infrastructure for the purpose of providing foreign intelligence, in accordance with Government of Canada intelligence priorities. * To provide advice, guidance and services to help ensure the protection of electronic information and of information infrastructures of importance to the Government of Canada. * To provide technical and operational assistance to federal law enforcement and security agencies in the performance of their lawful duties. The Anti-Terrorism Act also strengthened CSEC's capacity to engage in the war on terrorism by providing needed authorities to fulfill its mandate. CSEC is forbidden, by law, to intercept domestic communications. When intercepting communications between a domestic and foreign source, the domestic communications are destroyed or otherwise ignored (however, after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] on the United States, CSEC's powers expanded to allow the interception of foreign communications that begin or end in Canada, as long as the other party is outside the border and ministerial authorization is issued specifically for this case and purpose<ref>[http://www.cse-cst.gc.ca/privacy/protecting-privacy-e.html CSEC : Parliamentary Accountability<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>). CSEC is bound by all Canadian laws, including the [[Criminal Code of Canada]], the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], and the [[Privacy Act 1982|Privacy Act]]. ===Commissioner=== The Office of the Communications Security Establishment Commissioner (OCSEC) was created on June 19, 1996, to review CSE's activities for compliance with the applicable legislation, accept and investigate complaints regarding the lawfulness of the agency's activities, and to perform special duties under the 'Public Interest Defence' clause of the [[Security of Information Act]].<ref>[http://www.ocsec-bccst.gc.ca/mandate/index_e.php OCSEC Mandate]</ref> Once a year, the Commissioner provides a public report on his activities and findings to Parliament, through the Minister of National Defence. As of 2010, there have been five Commissioners: * the Honourable [[Claude
