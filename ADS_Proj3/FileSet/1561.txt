Reines responded, “To be a physicist extraordinaire.” Reines graduated from high school in 1935.<ref name="autob"/> Reines said that his "early education was strongly influenced" by his older siblings. They were studious pupils who became doctors and lawyers.<ref name="autob"/> Reines attended [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] in [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], where he earned his [[Master’s degree|M.E.]] and [[Master’s degree|M.S.]] degrees, before receiving his [[Ph.D.]] from [[New York University]]. In 1940 he married Sylvia Samuels, to whom he remained married for the rest of his life. == Discovery of the neutrino and the inner workings of stars == In 1944 Reines began working under [[Richard Feynman]] in the Theoretical Division of the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], where Reines became a group leader in 1945. In the early 1950s, working in [[Hanford Engineering Works|Hanford]] and [[Savannah River Site|Savannah River]] laboratories, Reines and his colleague, [[Clyde Cowan]] developed the detection procedures by which they and a team of researchers in 1956 first detected [[neutrino]]s. Neutrinos had been first proposed theoretically by [[Wolfgang Pauli]] 20 years earlier to explain undetected energy that escaped when a [[Beta decay|neutron decayed into a proton and an electron]]. From then on Reines dedicated the major part of his career to the study of the neutrino’s properties and interactions, which work would influence study of the neutrino for future researchers to come, including the discovery of neutrinos emitted from [[SN 1987A|Supernova SN1987A]] by the [[Irvine-Michigan-Brookhaven (detector)|Irvine-Michigan-Brookhaven]] Collaboration.<ref name="mem">[http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=hb1p30039g&chunk.id=div00047&brand=calisphere&doc.view=entire_text University of California: In Memoriam, 1998. Frederick Reines, Physics; Radiological Sciences: Irvine]</ref> This discovery helped to inaugurate the field of [[neutrino astronomy]]. On the basis of his work in first detecting the [[neutrino]], Reines became the head of the physics department of [[Case Western Reserve University]] from 1959 to 1966. At Case, Reines led a group that was the first to detect neutrinos created in the atmosphere by [[cosmic ray]]s.<ref name="PhyToday">[http://www.aip.org/pt/vol-54/iss-2/pdf/vol48no12p17-19.pdf ''Physics Today'', Volume '''54''', Number 2, pages 17-19, by Gloria B.

During this time, besides performing his duties as a research supervisor and chairman of the physics department, Reines sang in the Cleveland Orchestra Chorus under the direction of [[Robert Shaw (conductor)|Robert Shaw]] in performances with [[George Szell]] and the [[Cleveland Orchestra]].<ref name="mem"/> In 1966, Reines took most of his neutrino research team with him when he left for California to become the founding dean of physical sciences at the then new [[University of California, Irvine]] (UCI). While at UCI, Reines extended the research interests of some of his graduate students into the development of medical radiation detectors, such as for measuring total radiation delivered to the whole human body in [[radiation therapy]].<ref name="mem"/> [[Image:Cygnus Loop Supernova Blast Wave - GPN-2000-000992.jpg|right|thumbnail|Cygnus Loop]] Reines had prepared for the possibility of measuring the distant events of a supernova explosion. Supernova explosions are rare, but Reines thought he might be lucky, see one in his lifetime, and be able to catch the neutrinos streaming from it in his specially-designed detectors. According to a UCI obituary, during his wait for a supernova to explode, he put signs on some of his large neutrino detectors, calling them "Supernova Early Warning Systems". After Supernova 1987A exploded, researchers used the results of Reines's and others' measurements to figure out events in [[stellar evolution]]. According to these research findings, when a [[Stellar_evolution#Massive stars|supermassive star]] collapses and then explodes, the resulting jets of neutrinos bombard the escaping masses to create the elements up through [[uranium]] that are heavier than iron. Researchers have concluded that without these natural neutrino processes in exploding supermassive stars, the [[Periodic table|elements]] like [[copper]], [[silver]], [[platinum]], and [[gold]] that are heavier than [[iron]] would not exist; at least no other natural process has been discovered that creates usable quantities of the elements heavier than iron.<ref name="mem"/> In 1995, Reines was honored, along with [[Martin L. Perl]] with the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], and his work with [[Clyde Cowan]] in first detecting the neutrino was recognized by the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]. Reines also received many other awards, including the [[National Medal of Science]]. Reines remained on UCI's faculty until his death of natural causes in 1998, aged 80. (After 1988 his title was [[professor emeritus]].) In addition to his wife, Reines was survived by his son Robert G., his daughter Alisa K. Cowden, and six grandchildren. ==Publications== *Reines, F. & C. L.
