It is characterized by strict separation of data storage, processing and user interface development. GNUstepWeb is based on [[GNUstep]]. Its goals are to be compatible to [[WebObjects]] version 4.5.x with some extensions. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s WebObjects was ported to [[Java (programming language) | Java]] with version 5. GNUstepWeb continues using [[Objective-C]]. == External links == {{Wikibooks|GNUstep}} * [http://www.gnustep.org/ GNUstep.org] - homepage * [http://wiki.gnustep.org/ GNUstepWiki] - homepage of GNUstep wiki * [http://lists.turbocat.net/mailman/listinfo.cgi/gswhackers lists.turbocat.net/mailman/listinfo.cgi/gswhackers] – developer mailing list. {{DEFAULTSORT:Gnustepweb}} [[Category:Software architecture]] [[Category:Servers]] [[Category:NeXT]] [[de:GNUstepWeb]]</text> </page> <page> <id>14631</id> <title>GOLD (parser)</title> <text>{{Infobox_Software | name = GOLD Parsing System | logo = [[File:GOLD logo.gif|GOLD Logo]] | screenshot = [[File:GOLD Builder v3.4.gif|200px|Builder Application]] | caption = | developer = Devin Cook & <br>[http://www.devincook.com/goldparser/contributors Multiple Contributors] | latest_release_date = 2010-05-28 | latest_release_version = 4.0 | operating_system = [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] | operating_system_desc = Windows 32-bit | genre = [[Parsers]] - [[LALR parser|LALR]] | license = [[zlib License]] ([[free software]]) | website = [http://www.devincook.com/goldparser www.devincook.com/goldparser] }} '''GOLD''' is a freeware [[parsing]] system that is designed to support multiple programming languages. == Design == The system uses a [[Deterministic finite state machine|DFA]] for lexical analysis and the [[LALR]] algorithm for parsing. Both of these algorithms are state machines that use tables to determine actions. GOLD is designed around the principle of logically separating the process of generating the [[LALR]] and [[Deterministic finite state machine|DFA]] parse tables from the actual implementation of the parsing algorithms themselves. This allows parsers to be implemented in different programming languages while maintaining the same grammars and development process. The GOLD system consists of three logical components, the "Builder", the "Engine", and a "Compiled Grammar Table" file definition which functions as an intermediary between the Builder and the Engine. === Builder === [[Image:GOLD flow.png|right|GOLD Components]] The Builder is the primary component and main application of the system. The Builder is used to analyze the syntax of a language (specified as a grammar) and construct [[LALR]] and [[Deterministic finite state machine|DFA]] tables. During this process, any ambiguities in the grammar will be reported. This is essentially the same task that is performed by compiler-compilers such as [[YACC]] and [[ANTLR]]. Once the [[LALR]] and [[Deterministic finite state machine|DFA]] parse tables are successfully constructed, the Builder can save this data into a Compiled Grammar Table file. This allows the information to be reopened later by the Builder or used in one of the Engines. Currently, the Builder component is only available for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] 32-bit operating systems. Some of the features of the Builder are as follows: * [[Freeware]] license * State Browsing * Integrated Testing * Test multiple files wizard * Generate Webpages (including hyperlinked syntax charts) * Generate skeleton programs using templates * Export grammars to [[YACC]] * Export tables to XML or formatted text === Compiled Grammar Table file === The Compiled Grammar Table file is used to store table information generated by the Builder. === Engines === Unlike the Builder, which only runs on a single platform, the Engine component is written for a specific programming language and/or development platform. The Engine implements the [[LALR]] and [[Deterministic finite state machine|DFA]] algorithms. Since different programming languages use different approaches to designing programs, each implementation of the Engine will vary. As a result, an implementation of the Engine written for [[Visual Basic]] 6 will differ greatly from one written for [[ANSI C]]. Currently, Engines for GOLD have been implemented for the following programming languages / platforms. New Engines can be implemented using the source code for the existing Engines as the starting point. * [[Assembly language|Assembly]] - Intel x86 * [[ANSI C]] * [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] * [[D (programming language)|D]] * [[Delphi programming language|Delphi]] * [[Java (programming language)|Java]] * [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] * [[Python (programming language)|Python]] * [[Visual Basic]] * [[Visual Basic .NET]] * [[Visual C++]] == Grammars == GOLD grammars are based directly on [[Backus-Naur Form]], [[regular expression]]s, and set notation. The following grammar defines the syntax for a minimal general-purpose programming language called "Simple". <pre> "Name" = 'Simple' "Author" = 'Devin Cook' "Version" = '2.1' "About" = 'This is a very simple grammar designed for use in examples' "Case Sensitive" = False "Start Symbol" = <Statements> {String Ch 1} = {Printable} - [''] {String Ch 2} = {Printable} - ["] Identifier = {Letter}{AlphaNumeric}* !
