The energy then becomes :<math>\varepsilon_m(\boldsymbol{k}) = E_m - N\ |b (0)|^2 \left(\beta_m + \sum_{\boldsymbol{R_n}\neq 0}\sum_l \gamma_{m,l}(\boldsymbol{R_n}) e^{i \boldsymbol{k} \cdot \boldsymbol{R_n}}\right) \ ,</math> :::<math>= E_m - \ \frac {\beta_m + \sum_{\boldsymbol{R_n}\neq 0}\sum_l \gamma_{m,l}(\boldsymbol{R_n}) e^{i \boldsymbol{k} \cdot \boldsymbol{R_n}}}{1 + \sum_{\boldsymbol{R_n \neq 0}}\sum_l e^{i \boldsymbol{k \cdot R_n}} \alpha_{m,l} (\boldsymbol{R_n})} \ , </math> where ''E''<sub>m</sub> is the energy of the ''m''-th atomic level, and <math>\alpha_{m,l}</math>, <math>\beta_m</math> and <math>\gamma_{m,l}</math> are the tight binding matrix elements. ===The tight binding matrix elements=== The element :<math> \beta_m = -\int \varphi_m^*(\boldsymbol{r})\Delta U(\boldsymbol{r}) \varphi_m(\boldsymbol{r}) \, d^3 r \ </math>, is the atomic energy shift due to the potential on neighboring atoms. This term is relatively small in most cases. If it is large it means that potentials on neighboring atoms have a large influence on the energy of the central atom. The next term :<math> \gamma_{m,l}(\boldsymbol{R_n}) = -\int \varphi_m^*(\boldsymbol{r}) \Delta U(\boldsymbol{r}) \varphi_l(\boldsymbol{r - R_n}) \, d^3 r \ ,</math> is the '''[[#Table_of_inter_atomic_matrix_elements|inter atomic matrix element]]''' between the atomic orbitals ''m'' and ''l'' on adjacent atoms. It is also called the bond energy or two center integral and it is is the '''most important element''' in the tight binding model. The last terms :<math> \alpha_{m,l}(\boldsymbol{R_n}) = \int \varphi_m^*(\boldsymbol{r}) \varphi_l(\boldsymbol{r - R_n}) \, d^3 r \ </math>, denote the [[Overlap matrix|overlap integrals]] between the atomic orbitals ''m'' and ''l'' on adjacent atoms. ==Evaluation of the matrix elements== As mentioned before the values of the <math>\beta_m</math>-matrix elements are not so large in comparison with the ionization energy because the potentials of neighboring atoms on the central atom are limited. If <math>\beta_m</math> is not relatively small it means that the potential of the neighboring atom on the central atom is not small either. In that case it is an indication that the tight binding model is not a very good model for the description of the band structure for some reason. The inter atomic distances can be too small or the charges on the atoms or ions in the lattice is wrong for example. The inter atomic matrix elements <math>\gamma_{m,l}</math> can be calculated directly if the atomic wave functions and the potentials are known in detail. Most often this is not the case. There are numerous ways to get parameters for these matrix elements. Parameters can be obtained from [[Bond_energy#External_links|chemical bond energy data]]. Energies and eigenstates on some high symmetry points in the [[Brillouin zone]] can be evaluated and values integrals in the matrix elements can be matched with band structure data from other sources. The inter atomic overlap matrix elements <math>\alpha_{m,l}</math> should be rather small or neglectable. If they are large it is again an indication that the tight binding model is of limited value for some purposes. Large overlap is an indication for too short inter atomic distance for example. In metals and transition metals the broad s-band or sp-band can be fitted better to an existing band structure calculation by the introduction of next-nearest-neighbor matrix elements and overlap integrals but fits like that don't yield a very useful model for the electronic wave function of a metal. Broad bands in dense materials are better described by a [[nearly free electron model]]. The tight binding model works particularly well in cases where the band width is small and the electrons are strongly localized, like in the case of d-bands and f-bands. The model also gives good results in the case of open crystal structures, like diamond or silicon, where the number of neighbors is small. The model can easily be combined with a nearly free electron model in a hybrid NFE-TB model<ref name=Harrison></ref>. ==Connection to Wannier functions== [[Bloch wave]] functions describe the electronic states in a periodic [[Crystal structure|crystal lattice]]. Bloch functions can be represented as a [[Fourier series]]<ref>Orfried Madelung, ''Introduction to Solid-State Theory'' (Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg, 1978).</ref> :<math>\psi_m\mathbf{(k,r)}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{n}{a_m\mathbf{(R_n,r)}} e^{\mathbf{ik\cdot R_n}}\ ,</math> where '''''R'''''<sub>n</sub> denotes an atomic site in a periodic crystal lattice, '''''k''''' is the [[wave vector]] of the Bloch wave, '''''r''''' is the electron position, ''m'' is the band index, and the sum is
