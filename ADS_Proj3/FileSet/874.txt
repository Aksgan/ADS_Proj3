characteristics of a network are distinct; the logical network topology is not necessarily the same as the physical layout. Networks may be classified based on the method of data used to convey the data, these include digital and analog networks. == OSI-ISO Model == The Open System Interconnection Reference Model [[OSI model|(OSI Reference Model or OSI Model)]] is an abstract description for layered communications and computer [[network protocol]]design. It was developed as part of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Systems_Interconnection [[Open Systems Interconnection|Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)]] initiative.[1] In its most basic form, it divides network architecture into seven layers which, from top to bottom, are the Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data-Link, and Physical Layers. It is therefore often referred to as the '''OSI Seven Layer Model'''. A layer is a collection of conceptually similar functions that provide services to the layer above it and receives service from the layer below it. On each layer an instance provides services to the instances at the layer above and requests service from the layer below. For example, a layer that provides error-free communications across a network provides the path needed by applications above it, while it calls the next lower layer to send and receive packets that make up the contents of the path. Conceptually two instances at one layer are connected by a horizontal protocol connection on that layer. == General communication model == [[Image:Communicataion model.png|thumb|right|500px|General Communication Model]] Communication model The parts of this model are as follows: ''Sender'': The sender is what or who is trying to send a message to the receiver. ''Encoder'': In the general case, it is not possible to directly insert the message onto the communications medium. For instance, when you speak on the telephone, it is not possible to actually transmit sound (vibrations in matter) across the wire for any distance. In your phone is a microphone, which converts the sound into electrical impulses, which can be transmitted by wires. Those electrical impulses are then manipulated by the electronics in the phone so they match up with what the telephone system expects. ''Message'': Since this is a communication engineer's model, the message is the actual encoded message that is transmitted by the medium. ''Medium'': The medium is what the message is transmitted on. The phone system, Internet, and many other electronic systems use wires. Television and radio can use electromagnetic radiation. Even bongo drums can be used as a medium . ''Decoder'': The decoder takes the encoded message and converts it to a form the receiver understands, since for example a human user of the phone system does not understand electrical impulses directly. ''Receiver'': The receiver is the target of the message. ==References== <references/> ==External links== {{DEFAULTSORT:Computer Networks And Internet Technology}} [[Category:Networking hardware|Bridge]] [[Category:Computer networking]]</text> </page> <page> <id>7539</id> <title>Computer crime</title> <text>'''Computer crime''', or '''cybercrime''', refers to any crime that involves a [[computer]] and a [[computer network|network]], where the computers may or may not have played an instrumental part in the commission of a [[crime]].<ref name="moore">Moore, R.

There are also problems of [[privacy]] when [[confidential]] information is lost or intercepted, lawfully or otherwise. On the global level, both governments and non-state actors continue to grow in importance, with the ability to engage in such activities as [[espionage]], [[theft|financial theft]], and other cross-border crimes sometimes referred to as [[cyber warfare]]. The international legal system is attempting to hold actors accountable for their actions, with the [[International Criminal Court]] among the few addressing this threat.<ref>Ophardt, Jonathan A.

Generally, however, it may be divided into one of two types of categories: (1) crimes that target computer networks or devices directly; (2) crimes facilitated by computer networks or devices, the primary target of which is independent of the computer network or device.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Examples of crimes that primarily target computer networks or devices would include: *[[Computer viruses]] *[[Denial-of-service attacks]] *[[Malware]] (malicious code) Examples of crimes that merely use computer networks or devices would include: *[[Cyberstalking]] *[[Fraud]] and [[identity theft]] *[[Information warfare]] *[[Phishing|Phishing scams]] A computer can be a source of [[evidence]]. Even though the computer is not directly used for criminal purposes, it is an excellent device for record keeping, particularly given the power to encrypt the data. If this evidence can be obtained and decrypted, it can be of great value to criminal investigators. === Spam === [[E-mail spam|Spam]], or the unsolicited sending of bulk [[email]] for commercial purposes, is unlawful to [[E-mail spam legislation by country|varying degrees]]. As applied to email, specific anti-spam laws are relatively new, but however, limits on unsolicited electronic communications have existed in few forms for some time.<ref>''See'', ''e.g.'', [[Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991]], [[Do-Not-Call Implementation Act of 2003]], [[CAN-SPAM Act of 2003]].</ref> === Fraud === {{main|Computer fraud}} Computer fraud is any dishonest misrepresentation of fact intended to let another to do or refrain from doing something which causes loss.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In this context, the fraud will result in obtaining a benefit by: * Altering [[Input/output|computer input]] in an unauthorized way. This requires little technical expertise and is not an uncommon form of theft by employees altering the data before entry or entering false data, or by entering unauthorized instructions or using unauthorized processes; * Altering, destroying, suppressing, or stealing output, usually to conceal unauthorized transactions: this is difficult to detect; * Altering or deleting stored data; * Altering or misusing existing system tools or software packages, or altering or writing code for fraudulent purposes.
