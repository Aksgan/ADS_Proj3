role== Oddly enough, personality issues can be paramount in a safety engineer. They must be personally pleasant, intelligent, and ruthless with themselves and their organization. In particular, they have to be able to "sell" the failures that they discover, as well as the attendant expense and time needed to correct them. They can be the messengers of bad news. Safety engineers have to be ruthless about getting facts from other engineers. It is common for a safety engineer to consider software, chemical, electrical, mechanical, procedural, and training problems in the same day. Often the facts can be very uncomfortable as many safety related issues point towards mediocre management systems or worse, questionable business ethics. ==Teamwork== It's difficult and expensive to retrofit safety into an unsafe system. To prevent safety problems, an organization should therefore treat safety as an early design and "architecture" activity, using the principles of [[Inherent safety]], rather than as a "paperwork requirement" to be cleaned up after the real design is done. Safety engineers also must work in a team that includes other engineering specialties, quality assurance, quality improvement, regulatory compliance specialists, educators and lawyers. Subpar safety and quality problems often indicate underlying deficiencies in an organization's goals, recruitment, succession, training, management systems and business culture. Safety often works well in a true matrix-management organization, in which safety is a managed discipline integrated into a project plan. ==See also== * [[American Society of Safety Engineers]] * [[Biomedical engineering]] * [[Chemical engineering]] * [[Fire protection engineering]] * [[Hazard Identification]] * [[Life-critical]] * [[Redundancy (engineering)]] * [[Reliability engineering]] * [[Safety engineering]] * [[Safety life cycle]] * [[Security engineering]] ==External links and sources== *[[Trevor Kletz]] (1998) ''Process Plants: A Handbook for Inherently Safer Design'' CRC ISBN: 1560326190 * {{cite book|author=[[Frank Lees]] |title=Loss Prevention in the Process Industries|edition=3rdEdition|publisher=Elsevier|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7506-7555-0}} * [http://www.asse.org American Society of Safety Engineers] (official website) * [http://www.bcsp.org Board of Certified Safety Professionals] (official website) * [http://www.sars.org.uk/ The Safety and Reliability Society] (official website) [[Category:Safety engineering]] [[Category:Engineering occupations]] [[de:Sicherheitsingenieur]] [[pt:Engenheiro de segurança]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33114</id> <title>Safety life cycle</title> <text>{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}} The '''safety life cycle''' is the series of phases from initiation and specifications of safety requirements, covering design and development of safety features in a safety-critical system, and ending in decommissioning of that system. The basic concept in building software safety, ie safety features in software, is that safety characteristics and behaviour of the software and system must be specified and designed into the system. The problem for any systems designer lies in reducing the risk to an acceptable level and of course, the risk tolerated will vary between applications. When a software application is to be used in a safety-related system, then this must be borne in mind at all stages in the software lifecycle. The process of safety specification and assurance throughout the development and operational phases is sometimes called the ‘safety life cycle’. The first stages of the life cycle involve assessing the potential system hazards and estimating the risk they pose. One such method is [[fault tree analysis]]. This is followed by a safety requirements specification which is concerned with identifying safety-critical functions (functional requirements specification) and the safety integrity level for each of these functions. The specification may either describe how the software should behave to minimize the risk or might require that the hazard should never arise. A ‘normal’ process model is then followed with particular attention paid to the validation (inspection, testing etc) of the system. Part of that validation should be an explicit safety validation activity. ==See also== *[[Safety engineering]] *[[Safety engineer]] *[[System safety]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Safety Life Cycle}} [[Category:Safety engineering]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33124</id> <title>Sales process engineering</title> <text>'''Sales process engineering''' has been described as “the systematic application of scientific and mathematical principles to achieve the practical goals of a particular sales process"<ref name="Selden 1997">{{cite book|title='''Sales Process Engineering: A Personal Workshop''' |author = Paul H.

Selden pointed out that in this context, sales referred to the output of a process involving a variety of functions across an organization, and not that of a “sales department” alone. Primary areas of application span functions including [[sales]], [[marketing]], and [[customer service]]. Variations of this brief description are possible, but described as such, the discipline is consistent with other published definitions of [[engineering]] and its many well-established branches, but relatively new in its focus. ==Historical context== [[W.

However, Deming himself, and many other recent thought leaders in the field of quality and process improvement, such as [[Joseph Juran]], [[Shigeo Shingo]], [[Taiichi Ohno]], and [[Eliyahu Goldratt]] primarily focused on aspects related to production and logistics in the arena of manufacturing<ref name="Selden1998">{{cite journal|author = Paul H.

The upturn in interest in applying a more systematic approach to these areas was spurred by a number of factors, including: * advent of portable computing devices, [[laptop]] and personal computers in the 1990’s * development of software that enabled the creation, connection, and analysis of related databases (e.g., [[Customer relationship management]], [[Database marketing]]) * the relatively large share of expenses consumed by sales, marketing and customer service functions as a proportion of many budgets<ref name="Lazere">{{cite journal|author = Cathy Lazere| year = 1996| month = December|title='''Holding The Line On SG&A'''|journal=CFO| pages = 28–36}}</ref> * realization that a careful approach is required in order to get a return (financial or otherwise) on investments in automation<ref name="Swartz">{{cite journal|author = Gordon S.
