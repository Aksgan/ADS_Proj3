is prominent: :''Hrothgar mathelode helm Scildinga'' ("Hrothgar spoke, protector of the Scildings") :''Beowulf mathelode bearn Ecgtheowes'' ("Beowulf spoke, son of Ecgtheow") Magoun thought that formulaic poetry was necessarily oral in origin. This sparked a major and ongoing debate over the extent to which Old English Poetry—which survives only in written form—should be seen as, in some sense, oral poetry. ==See also== *[[Oral tradition]] *[[Oral poetry]] ==Further reading== *Foley, John Miles (ed. and trans.), ''An eEdition of The Wedding of Mustajbey’s Son Bećirbey as performed by Halil Bajgorić'' (2005), http://oraltradition.org/zbm. *Lord, Albert B.

Aitken, New York: Semi-Centennial Publications of the University of California, 1918.</ref><sup>, p. 137.</sup> The position of the node may be used as one of a set of parameters, called ''[[orbital element]]s'', which describe the orbit. This is done by specifying the [[longitude of the ascending node]] (or, sometimes, the [[longitude of the node]].) The '''line of nodes''' is the intersection of the object's orbital plane with the plane of reference.
