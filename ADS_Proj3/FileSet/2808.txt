'''Marvin''' (Mobile Autonomous Robot Vehicle for Indoor Navigation) is a mobile [[robot]] developed at Robotics Lab at [[University of Kaiserslautern]], [[Germany]]. This platform consists of a differential drive, a bumper for basic operational safety, planar [[laser range scanners]] at the front and back side for obstacle detection, a belt of [[ultrasonic sensors]] for recognizing jutting edges such as table tops, a [[web cam]], another fixed laser scanner at a [[height]] of one [[meter]] for a view free of clutter and a [[stereo]] [[microphone]] system for [[Sound localization|localization]] of [[sound]] sources. Its control system follows a behavior-based approach and its [[map]]ping abilities rely on a [[Cartesian coordinate system#Cartesian coordinates in two dimensions|2D]] geometric and topological strategy. ==Technical specifications== *Length: 72 cm *Width: 72 cm *Height: 120 cm *Weight: about 80 kg *Payload: about 100 kg *Power Supply: 2 lead batteries, each 12V *Operation Time: 3 hours *Drive: Differential drive with 2 [[electric motors]] *Max.
