(BPM) is the activity of [[process modeling|representing processes]] of an enterprise, so that the current ("as is") process may be analyzed and improved in future ("to be"). Business process modelling is typically performed by business analysts and managers who are seeking to improve process efficiency and quality. The process improvements identified by business process modelling may or may not require [[Information Technology]] involvement, although that is a common driver for the need to model a business process, by creating a process master. [[Change management]] programs are typically involved to put the improved business processes into practice. With advances in technology from large platform vendors, the vision of business process modelling models becoming fully executable (and capable of simulations and round-trip engineering) is coming closer to reality every day. === Systems architecture === The [[RM-ODP]] reference model identifies enterprise modelling as providing one of the five viewpoints of an open distributed system. Note that such a system need not be a modern-day IT system: a banking clearing house in the 19th century may be used as an example. == Enterprise modelling techniques == There are several techniques for modelling the enterprise such as * Active Knowledge Modeling,<ref>Frank Lillehagen, [[John Krogstie]] (2008). ''Active Knowledge Modeling of Enterprises''. Springer, 2008.

It encompasses the application of knowledge, principles, and disciplines related to the analysis, design, implementation and operation of all elements associated with an enterprise. In essence this is an [[interdisciplinary field]] which combines [[systems engineering]] and [[strategic management]] as it seeks to engineer the entire enterprise in terms of the [[Product (business)|product]]s, [[Process modeling|process]]es and [[business operations]]. The view is one of continuous improvement and continued adaptation as firms, processes and markets develop along their [[Enterprise Life Cycle|life cycle]]s. This total systems approach encompasses the traditional areas of research and development, product design, operations and manufacturing as well as information systems and strategic management.<ref name="Pil08"/> This fields is related to [[engineering management]], [[operations management]], [[service management]] and systems engineering.

In enterprise engineering a business reference model is part of an [[enterprise architecture framework]]. This framework defines in a series of reference models, how to organize the structure and [[view model|views]] associated with an [[Enterprise Architecture]]. A [[reference model]] in general is a model of something that embodies the basic goal or idea of something and can then be looked at as a reference for various purposes. A business reference model is a means to describe the [[business operations]] of an
