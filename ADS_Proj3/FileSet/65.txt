Tech Report, November 8, 2004.</ref>. *'''[[Xpress 3200]]''' - similar to ''[[Xpress 200]]'', but designed for optimal [[ATI CrossFire|CrossFire]] performance. **'''[[AMD 580 chipset series|AMD 580X CrossFire chipset]]''' - AMD edition of ''Xpress 3200'' renamed, due to AMD acquisition of ATI. *'''[[AMD 690 chipset series|690G]], [[AMD 690 chipset series|Xpress 1250]]''' - for AMD and Intel platforms. Includes DirectX 9 graphics processor improved over ''Xpress 200''.<ref>[http://ati.amd.com/products/radeonxpress1250dsk/index.html ATI product page of Xpress 1250]</ref> and industry first native HDMI implementation on motherboards. *'''[[AMD 700 chipset series]]''' - exclusively for AMD processors, this is a chipset family supporting [[Phenom (processor)|Phenom]] processors and [[AMD Quad FX platform|Quad FX enthusiast platform]] (790FX), enthusiast chipset (790X), [[Integrated Graphics Processor|IGP]] (790GX, 785G, 780G, 740G) and single graphics card variants (770, 740) aimed at mainstream and value computing systems available. *'''[[AMD 800 chipset series]]''' - exclusively for AMD processors, It includes support for up to six [[Serial ATA#SATA Revision 3.0 (SATA 6Gb/s)|SATA 6.0 Gbit/s]] ports, the C6 power state, which is featured in [[AMD Fusion|Fusion]] processors and [[Advanced Host Controller Interface|AHCI]] 1.2 with SATA [[port multiplier#FIS(Frame Information Structure)–based switching|FIS–based switching]] support. This is a chipset family supporting [[Phenom (processor)|Phenom]] processors and [[AMD Quad FX platform|Quad FX enthusiast platform]] (890FX), [[Integrated Graphics Processor|IGP]](890GX). In addition to the above chipset ATI has announced that a deal has been struck with [[CPU]] and [[Motherboard]] manufacturers as of 2005, particularly [[Asus]] and [[Intel]], to create onboard 3D Graphics solutions for [[Intel]]'s new range of motherboards that will be released with their range of [[Intel]] [[Pentium M]]-based desktop processors, the [[Intel Core]] and [[Intel Core 2]] processors, the D101GGC and D101GGC2 chipset (codenamed "''Grand County''"<ref>[http://cache-www.intel.com/cd/00/00/32/94/329441_329441.pdf Intel Boxed Desktop Board Quick Guide (December 2006)]</ref>) based on the [[Xpress 200|Radeon Xpress 200]] chipset. However, high-end boards with integrated graphics processor (IGP) will still use [[Intel]] [[Intel GMA|GMA]] [[graphics processing unit|integrated graphics processor]]s. The deal with Intel was deemed to be officially ended with the purchase of ATI Technologies from AMD in July 2006, with Intel announcing [[Silicon Integrated Systems|SiS]] IGP chipset (D201GLY chipset, codenamed "''Little Valley''") for entry-level desktop platform, replacing the "''Grand County''" series chipsets. ===Multimedia and Digital TV products=== *'''[[All-In-Wonder]]''' series - A series of multimedia graphics cards which incorporating TV tuner and [[Radeon]] family [[video card|graphics card]]s onto one add-in card, which, after being seemingly discontinued was relaunched as All-In-Wonder HD on June 26, 2008. *TV tuners **'''TV Wonder''' and '''HDTV Wonder''' - a chipset family providing TV reception of various analog TV and digital TV signals ([[PAL]], [[NTSC]], [[ATSC]], [[DVB-T]] and so on) with first generation [[AVIVO]] technology, also supporting [[CableCARD]], and [[QAM tuner|Clear QAM]] technologies. **'''Theater''' - a family of [[QAM]] and [[Single-sideband modulation|VSB]] demodulators for the Digital Cable ready and [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]] environments. *'''Remote Wonder''', wireless remote control series for ATI multimedia products. Operates using radio frequency, away from mainstream implementations using [[Infrared#Communications|infrared]]. ===Console graphics products=== *'''[[Nintendo GameCube#Technical specifications|Flipper]]''' - The [[Nintendo GameCube]] (codenamed "dolphin" during production) contains a 3D accelerator developed by ''ArtX, Inc'', a company acquired by ATI during the development of the GPU. Flipper is similar in capability to a [[Direct3D]] 7 accelerator chip. It consists of four rendering pipelines, with hardware [[transform and lighting|T&L]], and some limited pixel shader support. Innovatively the chip has 3 [[MiB]] of embedded [[1T-SRAM]] for use as ultra-fast low-latency (6.2 [[nanosecond|ns]]) texture and [[framebuffer]]/[[Z-buffer]] storage allowing 10.4 [[gigabytes|GB]]/second bandwidth (extremely fast for the time). Flipper was designed by members of the [[Nintendo 64]] Reality Coprocessor team who moved from SGI. The Flipper team went on to have a major hand in the development of the [[Radeon 9700]]. *'''[[Xenos (graphics chip)|Xenos]]''' - [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox 360]] video game console contains a custom graphics chip produced by ATI, known as "R500", "C1", or more often as ''Xenos''. Some of these features include the embedded DRAM ([[eDRAM]]). The Xenos also features the “True Unified Shader Architecture” which dynamically loads and balances pixel and vertex processing amongst a bank of identically capable processing units. This differs greatly from past-generations PC graphics chips that have separate banks of processors designed for their individual task (vertex/fragment). Another feature presented in Xenos is the hardware [[tessellation#Tessellations and computer graphics|surface tessellation]] to divide a surface into smaller triangles, similar to [[TruForm]] in terms of functionality, which is an advanced feature as it is not presented even in the most up-to-date [[Direct3D#Direct3D 10|DirectX 10]] specification. The recent generation [[Radeon R600]] GPU core inherited most of the features presented in Xenos, except [[eDRAM]]. *'''[[Hollywood (graphics chip)|Hollywood]]''' - Successor to Flipper. Part of [[Nintendo]]'s latest gaming console, [[Wii]]. ===Handheld chipsets=== *'''[[Imageon]]''' - [[System-on-a-chip]] (SoC) design introduced in 2002 to bring integrated [[2D computer graphics|2D]] and [[3D computer graphics|3D]] graphics to handhelds devices, cellphones and [[Tablet PC]]s. Current top-of-line product is the Imageon 2298 which includes DVD quality recording and playback, TV output, and supports up to a 12-[[megapixel]] camera, with another line of Imageon products, the 2300 series supporting [[OpenGL]] ES 1.1+ extensions. The Imageon line was rebranded under AMD, after AMD acquired ATI in Q3 2006, as '''AMD Imageon'''. *'''[[Imageon|Imageon TV]]''' - Announced in February 2006, allowing handhelds devices to receive digital broadcast TV ([[DVB-H]]) signals and enables watching TV programs on these devices, the chipset includes tuner, demodulator, decoder, and a full software stack, operates alongside the [[Imageon]] chip. Besides full products, ATI has also supplied 3D and 2D graphics components to other vendors, specifically the [[Qualcomm]]<ref>[http://brew.qualcomm.com/bnry_brew/pdf/brew_2007/Tech-303_Ligon.pdf page 10 and 15]</ref> [[MSM7000]] series SoC chips of handheld and upcoming [[Freescale]] i. MX processors<ref>[http://www.dailytech.com/Freescale+Licenses+AMD+Technologies/article8909.htm DailyTech report]. Retrieved September 17, 2007.</ref>. ATI claimed in May 2006, that it had sold over 100 million<ref>[http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=31938 The Inquirer report]</ref> 'cell phone media co-processors', significantly more than ATI's rival NVIDIA, and announced in February 2007 that the firm had shipped a total of 200 million of Imageon products since 2003<ref>[http://www.amd.com/us-en/Corporate/VirtualPressRoom/0,,51_104_543~115795,00.html AMD press release]. Retrieved July 27, 2007.</ref>. In late 2008, the entire handheld division was sold off to [[Qualcomm]], so there will be no new Imageon products. ===High Performance Computing=== *'''[[AMD FireStream]]''', originally ATI Firestream, and previously rebranded as
