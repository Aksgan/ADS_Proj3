code <tt>0x82</tt> usually indicates a Linux ''swap'' partition). The [[File Allocation Table|FAT16 and FAT32]] file systems have made use of a number of partition type codes due to the limits of various DOS and Windows OS versions. Though a Linux operating system may recognize a number of different file systems ([[ext4]], [[ext3]], [[ext2]], [[ReiserFS]], etc.), they have all consistently used the same partition type code: <tt>0x83</tt> ([[file system#File systems under Linux|Linux native file system]]). === Extended partition === A hard disk may contain only one extended partition; the extended partition can be subdivided into multiple ''logical partitions''. In DOS/Windows systems, each logical partition may then be assigned an additional drive letter. Linux operating systems can be installed into (and run from) logical partitions, whereas Windows operating systems are restricted to primary partitions. See [[extended boot record]] for information on the structure of an extended partition. == Partitioning schemes == === DOS, Windows, and OS/2 === With [[DOS]], [[Microsoft Windows]], and [[OS/2]], a common practice is to use one primary partition for the active [[file system]] that will contain the operating system, the page/swap file, all utilities, applications, and user data. On most Windows consumer computers, the [[drive letter assignment|drive letter]] C: is routinely assigned to this primary partition. Other partitions may exist on the hard disk that may or may not be visible as drives, such as recovery partitions or partitions with diagnostic tools or data. (Microsoft drive letters do not correspond to partitions in a one-to-one fashion, so there may be more or less drive letters than partitions.) Proponents of multiple partitions assert that a benefit of having multiple partitions is the ability to store data files on a partition separate from one containing the system files. If the system partition then becomes corrupted for any reason, irreplaceable user files stored on the independent partition would be able to be more easily retrieved (or [[file recovery|recovered]]), not having been corrupted along with the system files. Another operating system (loaded from a LiveCD or USB, for example) could access the files on the (presumably) uncorrupted independent data partition without having to worry about the corrupted system partition at all. Further, when data files are kept in a separate partition, if an operating system needs to be re-installed / restored (due to malware infiltration, for example), this can be done without risking damage to the data files (that in a single-partition system are stored along with the operating system files). [[Windows 2000]], [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Vista]], and [[Windows 7]] include an inbuilt '[[Logical Disk Manager|Disk Management]]' program which allows for the creation, deletion and movement of Windows (but not other types of) partitions. The Windows 7/Vista Disk Manager is [[Logical_Disk_Manager#Compatibility_problems|not compatible]] with Windows 2000 or XP, nor, for the most part, other operating systems. Other examples of [[List of disk partitioning software|partition management programs]] for Windows are [[Acronis#Home_products_overview|Acronis Disk Director]], [http://www.partition-tool.com/ Easeus Partition Master], [[Norton Ghost]], and [http://perfectdisk.raxco.com/ Perfect Disk]. In some instances specialized recovery programs are supplied with retail consumer computers. === Unix, Linux and Mac OS X=== On [[Unix]]-based and [[Unix-like]] operating systems such as [[Linux]] and [[Mac OS X]], it is possible to use multiple partitions on a disk device. Each partition can be used for a [[file system]] or as a [[swap partition]]. Multiple partitions also allow directories such as [[/tmp]], [[/usr]], [[/var]], or [[home directory]] space to be allocated their own file system. Such a scheme has a number of potential advantages: *If one file system gets corrupted, the data outside that filesystem/partition stay intact, minimizing data loss. *Specific file systems can be mounted [[read-only]], or with the execution of [[setuid]] files disabled (thus enhancing security). *Performance may be enhanced due to less disk head travel. *A program which produces too much output (such as a system logging daemon) fills up only a single filesystem, therefore does not fill up more critical filesystems. (Often systems will not function correctly if / or /tmp fills up.) However, the disadvantage of subdividing the drive into fixed-size partitions is that a file system in one partition may become full, even though other file systems still have plenty of usable space. A good partitioning scheme requires the user to predict how much space each partition will need, which may be a difficult task; especially for new users. [[Logical volume management]] (LVM), often used in servers, increases flexibility by allowing data in volumes to expand into separate physical disks (which can be added when needed). Another option is to resize existing partitions when necessary. LVM allows this easily by resizing (shrinking) a filesystem, reducing the size of the logical volume containing that filesystem, allocating that freed space to another logical volume, and expanding (resizing) this other filesystem. Typical Linux desktop systems use two partitions: one holding a file system mounted on "/" (the [[root directory]]) and a [[swap partition]]. (However, an almost unlimited number of partitions can be accommodated by Linux operating systems.) By default, Mac OS X systems also use a single partition for the entire filesystem, but use a [[swap file]] inside the file system (like Windows) rather than a swap partition. === Multi-boot and mixed-boot systems === {{Main|Multi-boot}} [[File:GRUB with ubuntu and windows vista.png|thumb|400px|A [[GNU GRUB|GRUB]] startup menu showing [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] Linux (with three different boot modes) and [[Windows Vista]] options]] Multi-boot systems are computers where the user can boot into one of two or more distinct operating systems (OS) stored in separate storage devices or in separate partitions of the same storage device. In such systems a menu at [[booting|startup]] gives a choice of which OS to boot/start (and only one OS at a time is loaded). This is distinct from [[virtual machine|virtual operating systems]], in which one operating system is run as a self-contained virtual "program" within another already-running operating system. (An example is a Linux OS "virtual machine" running from within a Windows OS). Multi-boot systems are typically mixed-boot systems, with ''different'' OSes installed, although multiple copies of the ''same'' OS can be installed
