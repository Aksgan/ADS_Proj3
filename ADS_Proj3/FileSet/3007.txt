days of 86,400 [[SI]] [[second]]s. '''Y''' is years since the epoch (2000), expressed in Julian years of 365.25 days. Note that for calendrical calculations, one would probably use days measured in the time scale of [[Universal Time]], which follows the somewhat unpredictable rotation of the Earth, and progressively accumulates a difference with ephemeris time called [[Delta T|ΔT]]. == Calendrical consequences == :''For more details on this topic, see [[lunar calendar]] and [[lunisolar calendar]].'' At the simplest level, all lunar calendars are based on the approximation that 2 lunations last 59 days: a 30 day '''full month''' followed by a 29 day '''hollow month''' — but this is only marginally accurate and quickly needs correction by using larger cycles, or the equivalent of [[leap day]]s. Second, the synodic month does not fit easily into the [[year]], which makes constructing accurate, rule-based lunisolar calendars difficult. The most common solution to this problem is the [[Metonic cycle]], which takes advantage of the fact that 235 lunations are approximately 19 [[tropical year]]s (which add up to not quite 6940 days). However, a Metonic calendar (such as the [[Hebrew calendar]]) will drift against the seasons by about 1 day every 200 years. The problems of creating reliable lunar calendars may explain why [[solar calendar]]s, having months which no longer relate to the phase of the Moon, and being based only on the motion of the Sun against the sky, have generally replaced lunar calendars for civil use in most societies. == Months in various calendars == === Beginning of the lunar month === The [[Hellenic calendars]], the [[Hebrew calendar|Hebrew Lunisolar calendar]] and the [[Islamic calendar|Islamic Lunar calendar]] started the month with the first appearance of the thin crescent of the [[new moon]]. However, the motion of the Moon in its [[orbit]] is very complicated and its period is not constant. The date and time of this actual observation depends on the exact geographical longitude as well as latitude, atmospheric conditions, the visual acuity of the observers, etc. Therefore the beginning and lengths of months in these calendars can not be accurately predicted. While some like the [[Karaites]] Jews still rely on actual moon observations, most people use the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian solar calendar]]. === Julian and Gregorian calendars === The [[Gregorian calendar]], like the [[Julian calendar]] before it, has twelve months: {| class="wikitable sortable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto" |- !

('F' correlates to January.)]] The average month in the Gregorian calendar has a length of 30.4167 days or 4.345 weeks in a non-leap year and 30.5 days or 4.357 weeks in a leap year, or 30.436875 days in a mean Gregorian month overall (365.2425 ÷ 12). Months existing in the [[Roman calendar]] in the past include: * [[Mercedonius]], an occasional month after February to realign the calendar. * [[Quintilis]], renamed to July in honour of [[Julius Caesar]]. * [[Sextilis]], renamed to August in honour of [[Augustus]]. The famous [[mnemonic]] ''[[Thirty days hath September]]'' is the most common way of teaching the lengths of the months in the English-speaking world. Also, note that the latter 10 months of the year form a pair of 31-30-31-30-31-day 5-month cycles. The knuckles of the four fingers of one's hand and the spaces between them can be used to remember the lengths of the months. By making a fist, each month will be listed as one proceeds across the hand. All months landing on a knuckle are 31 days long and those landing between them are not. When the knuckle of the index finger is reached (July), go back to the first knuckle (or over to the first knuckle on the other fist, held next to the first) and continue with August.

The '''[[nones]]''' always occur 8 days before the ides, i.e., on the fifth or the seventh. The '''[[calends]]''' are always the first day of the month. === Islamic calendar === There are also twelve months in the [[Islamic calendar]].
