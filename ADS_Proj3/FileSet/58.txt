a patchwork of competing requirements that were difficult to enforce and/or comply with. The major American aerospace manufacturers combined their efforts to create a single, unified quality standard, resulting in AS9000. Upon the release of AS9000, companies such as Boeing discontinued use of their previous quality supplements in preference to compliance to AS9000. During the rewrite of ISO 9000 for the year 2000 release, the AS group worked closely with the ISO organization. As the year 2000 revision of ISO 9000 incorporated major organizational and philosophical changes, AS9000 underwent a rewrite as well. It was released as AS9100 to the international aerospace industry at the same time as the new version of ISO 9000. AS9100 Revision C was released in January, 2009<ref>[http://www.iaqg.sae.org/servlets/productDetail?PROD_TYP=STD&PROD_CD=AS9100C SAE International Publications]</ref>.

ANSI art]] }} '''ASCII art''' is a [[graphic design]] technique that uses [[computer]]s for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from the 95 printable (from a total of 128) [[character (computing)|characters]] defined by the [[ASCII]] Standard from 1963 and ASCII compliant character sets with proprietary extended characters (beyond the 128 characters of standard [[7-bit ASCII]]<!-- leave it as 7-bit for accuracy -->). The term is also loosely used to refer to [[#Other text-based art|text based art in general]]. ASCII art can be created with any [[text editor]], and is often used with [[free-form language]]s. Most examples of ASCII [[art]] require a [[typeface#Proportion|fixed-width font]] (non-proportional [[typeface|fonts]], as on a traditional [[typewriter]]) such as [[Courier (typeface)|Courier]] for presentation.

'' ]] [[Image:Arambilet ASCII Art.jpg|thumb|[[Arambilet]]:''ARTE ASCII/ASCII ART'']] Among the oldest known examples of ASCII art are the creations by computer-art pioneer [[Kenneth Knowlton]] from around 1966, who was working for [[Bell Labs]] at the time.<ref name="cgihist">{{Harvnb|Carlson|2003}}</ref> "Studies in Perception I" by Ken Knowlton and Leon Harmon from 1966 shows some examples of their early ASCII art.<ref name=sip1>{{Harvnb|Carlson|2003}} "1966 Studies in Perception I by Ken Knowlton and Leon Harmon (Bell Labs)", [http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/tree/images/bell.jpg Image of Studies in Perception I]</ref> One of the main reasons ASCII art was born was because early printers often lacked graphics ability and thus characters were used in place of graphic marks. Also, to mark divisions between different print jobs from different users, bulk printers often used ASCII art to print large banners, making the division easier to spot so that the results could be more easily separated by a computer operator or clerk. ASCII art was also used in early e-mail when images could not be embedded. ==History== ===Typewriter art=== Since 1867 typewriters have been used for creating visual art. The oldest known preserved example of typewriter art is a picture of a butterfly made in 1898 by Flora Stacey.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stark|2001}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Robert|2005}}</ref> In the 1954 short film ''[[Stamp Day for Superman]]'', typewriter art was a feature of the plot. ===TTY and RTTY=== TTY stands for "TeleTYpe" or "TeleTYpewriter" and is also known as [[Teleprinter]] or Teletype. RTTY stands for [[Radioteletype]]. According to a chapter in the "RTTY Handbook",<ref name=rttyhb>{{Harvnb|Green|1972}}</ref> text images have been sent via teletypewriter as early as 1923. However, none of the "old" RTTY art has been discovered yet. What is known is that text images appeared frequently on radio teletype in the 1960s and the 1970s.<ref name="joan">{{Harvnb|Stark|2000}}</ref><ref>[http://www.rtty.com/gallery/rttyeasy.htm RTTY Art Made Easy, RTTY Journal November 1970]</ref> ===ASCII art=== [[Image:ASCII full.svg|frame|There are 95 printable ASCII characters, numbered 32 to 126.]] The widespread usage of ASCII art can be traced to the computer [[bulletin board systems]] of the late 1970s and early 1980s. The limitations of computers of that time period necessitated the use of text characters to represent images. Along with ASCII's use in communication, however, it also began to appear in the underground online art groups of the period. An ASCII comic is a form of webcomic which uses ASCII text to create images. In place of images in a regular comic, ASCII art is used, with the text or dialog usually placed underneath. During the 1990s, graphical browsing and [[variable-width]] [[Computer font|fonts]] became increasingly popular, leading to a decline in ASCII art. Despite this, ASCII art continued to survive through online [[MUD]]s, an acronym for "Multi-User Dungeon", (which are textual [[Multiplayer game|multiplayer]] [[Computer role-playing game|roleplaying games]]), [[Internet Relay Chat]], [[E-mail]], [[message boards]] and other forms of online communication which commonly employ the needed [[fixed-width]]. Over the years, [[warez]] groups began to get into the ASCII art scene.<ref>{{Harvnb|Necromancer|1998}}</ref> Warez groups usually release [[.nfo]] files with their software, [[Software cracking|cracks]] or general illegal software reverse-engineering releases.<ref>{{Harvnb|Defacto2|2008}}</ref> The ASCII art will usually include the warez group's name and maybe some ASCII borders on the outsides of the release notes, etc.<ref>[http://www.defacto2.net/documents.cfm NFO Files collection at Defacto2.net, with NFO files that date back to 1989], retrieved February 17, 2008</ref> ==Uses== [[Image:ASCII Panzer unt Sattelzug.png|right|thumb|A self-propelled gun and truck made using ASCII art]] ASCII art is used wherever text can be more readily printed or transmitted than graphics, or in some cases, where the transmission of pictures is not possible. This includes typewriters, [[teletype]]s, non-graphic [[computer terminal]]s, [[printer separator]]s, in early [[computer network]]ing (e.g., [[bulletin board system|BBSes]]), [[e-mail]], and [[Usenet]] news messages. ASCII art is also used within the [[source code]] of computer programs for representation of company or product logos, and flow control or other diagrams. In some cases, the entire source code of a program is a piece of ASCII art &mdash; for instance, an entry to one of the earlier [[International Obfuscated C Code Contest]] is a program that adds numbers,
