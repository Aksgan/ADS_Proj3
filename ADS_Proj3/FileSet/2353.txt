During 2007-8 Joost used [[P2PTV|peer-to-peer TV technology]] to distribute content to their [[Mozilla]]-based desktop player; in late 2008 this was migrated to use a Flash-based Web player instead. Joost began development in [[2006]]. Working under the code name "The Venice Project", Zennström and Friis assembled teams of some 150 software developers in about six cities around the world, including [[New York]], [[London]], [[Leiden]] and [[Toulouse]]. According to Zennström at a 25 July 2007 [[press conference]] about [[Skype]] held in [[Tallinn, Estonia]], Joost had signed up more than a million beta testers, and its launch was scheduled for the end of 2007.<ref>[http://www.apcmag.com/6774/1_million_joost_users_prepare_for_year_end_launch 1 million Joost users prepare for year-end launch | APC Magazine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The team signed up with [[Warner Music]], Indianapolis Motor Speedway Productions ([[Indianapolis 500]], [[IndyCar Series]]) and production company [[Endemol]] for the beta.<ref name="orlowski">Orlowski, Andrew (January 17, 2007). [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/01/17/joost/ Joost - the new, new TV thing.] ''[[The Register]]''</ref> In February 2007, [[Viacom]] entered into a deal with the company to distribute content from its media properties, including [[MTV Networks]], [[BET]] and film studio [[Paramount Pictures]]. == Technology == [[Image:P2ptv.PNG|thumb|right|P2PTV overlay network serving three video streams.]] The program is based on [[P2PTV]] technology and is expected to deliver (relaying) near-TV [[Display resolution|resolution]] images. It turns a PC into an instant on-demand TV without any need for an additional set-up box. News updates, discussion forums, show ratings, and multi-user chat sessions (often linked to the active stream/channel) are made possible through the use of semi-transparent [[Widget engine|widget]] overlays. The current version of the software is based on [[XULRunner]] and the audio management re-uses the [[ZAP Media Kit]]. The peer to peer layer for on-demand video comes from the [[Joltid]] company, which also provided the peer to peer layer of Skype. A peer to peer layer for live video was developed from scratch, with a first trial run broadcasting [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|March Madness]] 2008<ref name="marchmadness2008">[http://newteevee.com/2008/03/11/joost-gets-live-with-ad-free-march-madness/ Joost Gets Live With Free March Madness], via [[NewTeeVee]]</ref>. The video playback utilizes the CoreCodec, [[CoreAVC]] [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]] video decoder. Joost soft launched its Widget API <!-- is it called "Widget API", or is it a widgit API? --> on August 29, 2007 under a non-copyleft open source license and encourages third party developers to create tools for its TV 2.0 platform. In 2009 Joost released a special site of joost for the PlayStation 3 internet browser that took advantage of some of the internet browser's full screen and 'x' button capabilities. By holding the 'x' button you can choose various video options using the d-pad. == Financing == === Joost development === As co-owners of Skype, Friis and Zennström received part of a $2.6 billion cash payment when [[eBay]] acquired Skype in 2005, which easily covered the development and marketing cost of their Joost venture. Just a week after launching the service, the founders announced that they had raised an additional $45 million. [[Sequoia Capital]], which backed [[Yahoo]], [[Google]] and [[YouTube]]; Index Ventures, an early [[investor]] in [[Skype]]; [[Li Ka-shing]], the [[Hong Kong]] tycoon; and [[CBS]], the US media group, have all taken “small minority” stakes in the start-up. [[Viacom]] is also understood to be among the partners, although the nature of its backing has not been disclosed. === Content distribution === <!--Please add a diagram explaining the architecture--> As opposed to streaming technology in which all clients get the feed from the server, P2P TV technology differs in the sense that the servers serve only a handful of clients; each of the clients in turn propagate the stream to more downstream clients and so on. This moves the distribution costs from the channel owner to the user. The Joost service is ad-supported, with advertising [[analogous]] to that shown on traditional TV, according to former CEO Fredrik de Wahl.<ref>{{cite web| author = Greg Sandoval | title = Skype founders name new video start-up Joost | url=http://news.com.com/Skype+founders+name+new+video+start-up+Joost/2100-1026_3-6150225.html | publisher = CNET | accessdate
