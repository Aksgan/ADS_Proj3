and congestion. A network controller implements this by setting up restrictions and\or prioritising traffic for certain protocols, applications, ports on a network or by modifying the behaviour of traffic. The main elements of traffic control are classification, scheduling and queuing. Classification looks at packet content or at other information related to packets and attribute them to a distinct class. Packets are then put into queues and eventually scheduled for transmission. The class of a packet determines in which queue the packet goes and how it is scheduled. ===TCP Tuning=== [[TCP tuning]] is a method of increasing the buffer space for TCP packets, the TCP maximum window size is around 64kb/s. For high performance networks an improvement will be noticed in increasing the maximum window size for TCP packets. To get maximal throughput it is critical to use optimal TCP send and receive socket buffer sizes. But if the buffers are too small, the TCP congestion window will never fully open up. However if the receiver buffers are too large, TCP flow control breaks and the sender can overrun the receiver, which will cause the TCP window to shut down. This is likely to happen if the sending host is faster than the receiving host. Overly large windows on the sending side is not a big problem as long as the memory is available. In deciding the optimal size for the TCP buffer the following formula is used: bandwidth * RTT As the higher the BDP the higher the traffic is on the network, an increase in buffer size wil reduce the amount of packet loss and as a result improve efficiency. ==VLAN== A VLAN, also known as a [[virtual LAN]], is a method for dividing up a network regardless of physical infrastructure. A VLAN would be used when devices need to be separated as they have different requirements. As an example a VLAN can be created for devices within a firewall. However the ease of physically moving a device while still keeping the same logical connection on the network is the most beneficial addition of a VLAN.

The primary goal of the NS CTA is to deeply understand the underlying commonalities among these intertwined networks, and, by understanding, improve our ability to analyze, predict, design, and influence complex systems interweaving many kinds of networks<ref>URL: [http://www.ns-cta.org Network Science CTA Home page]</ref>. This emerging research domain, termed [[network science]], also has the potential to accelerate understanding of each genre of network by cross-fertilization of insights, theories, algorithms, and approaches and by expanding their study into the larger context of the multi-genre (or ''composite'') network environments within which each must act. The NS CTA is an alliance between (ARL), other government researchers, and a consortium of four research centers: an Academic Research Center (ARC) focused on social/cognitive networks (the SCNARC), an ARC focused on information networks (the INARC), an ARC focused on communications networks (the CNARC), and an Interdisciplinary Research Center (the IRC) focused on interdisciplinary research and technology transition. Overall, these centers include roughly one hundred PhD-level researchers from about 30 universities and industrial research labs, engaged with as many graduate students and interns. The Alliance unites research across organizations and research disciplines to address the critical technical challenges faced by the Army in a world where all missions are embedded in and depend upon many genres of networks. The expected impact of its transdisciplinary research includes greatly enhanced human performance for network-embedded missions and greatly enhanced speed and precision for complex military operations. Beyond this vital focus, its research is also expected to accelerate the reach and depth of our understanding of the interwoven networks that so profoundly influence all our lives. The Alliance conducts interdisciplinary research in network science and transitions the results of this fundamental research to address the technical challenges of network-embedded Army operations. The NS CTA research program exploits intellectual synergies across its disciplines by uniting fundamental and applied network science research in parallel. It drives the synergistic combination of these technical areas for network-centric and network-enabling capabilities in support of all missions required of today's military forces, including humanitarian support, peacekeeping, and combat operations in any kind of terrain, but especially in complex and urban settings. It also supports and stimulates dual-use applications of this research and resulting technology to benefit commercial use. As a critical element of this program, the Alliance has created a network science research facility in Cambridge, MA, as well as shared distributed experimental resources throughout the Alliance. The NS CTA also serves the Army’s technical needs through an education component, which acts to increase the pool of network science expertise in the Army and the nation while bringing greater awareness of Army technical challenges into the academic and industrial network science research community. In association with the NS CTA research program, there is a separate technology transition component that provides a contractual vehicle for other organizations to fund work focused on transitioning scientific and technical advances into more specific applications. Research projects in the NS CTA are by design, highly collaborative and multi-disciplinary, whether based in one of the three academic research centers, the interdisciplinary research center, or one of the two ''cross-cutting research initiatives'' (CCRI). === Core Research Program === ==== Communication Networks Academic Research Center (CNARC) ==== The CNARC’s research is focused on characterizing complex communications networks, such as those used for [[network-centric warfare]] and operations, so that their behavior can be predicted accurately and networks can be configured for optimal information sharing and gathering. In particular, the CNARC will focus on characterizing and controlling the operational information content capacity (OICC)
