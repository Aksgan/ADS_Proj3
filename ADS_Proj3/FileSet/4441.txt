The classification process differentiates types of surface such as land, water, [[forest]], lake, structure etc. In more details we might have classes such as type of [[Crop (agriculture)|crop]], or [[pollution]] structure, burn forest, [[volcano]] eruption with [[lava]], clear or [[turbidity|turbid]] water, [[seawater]], [[phytoplankton]], or, in smaller scales, [[road]]s, crops, artificial structures etc. ==See also== * [[Aerial photography]] * [[Cartography]] * [[Remote sensing]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Thematic Image}} [[Category:Imaging]]</text> </page> <page> <id>37543</id> <title>Thematic role</title> <text>'''Thematic role''' is a [[linguistics|linguistic]] notion, which may refer to: * [[Theta role]] (in syntax or at the syntax-semantics interface) * [[Thematic relation]] (in semantics) {{disambig}} [[nl:Thematische rol]]</text> </page> <page> <id>37545</id> <title>Theo de Raadt</title> <text>{{Infobox scientist | name = Theo de Raadt | image = Theo de raadt.jpg | image_width = 160px | caption = Theo de Raadt, hiking | birth_date = {{Birth date and age|1968|5|19}} | birth_place = [[Pretoria]], [[South Africa]] | residence = [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]] | nationality = Canadian | field = computer scientist, free software developer | work_institution = [[FSA Corporation]] | alma_mater = [[University of Calgary]] | doctoral_advisor = | doctoral_students = | known_for = [[NetBSD]], [[OpenBSD]], [[OpenSSH]], his personality, advocacy | prizes = [[Award for the Advancement of Free Software]] | religion = | footnotes = }} '''Theo de Raadt''' ({{IPA-en|ˈθiː.oʊ dɛˈrɔːt}}, {{IPA-nl|ˈteː.o dɛˈraːt}}), born May 19, 1968 in [[Pretoria]], [[South Africa]], is a [[software engineer]] who lives in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. He is the founder and leader of the [[OpenBSD]] and [[OpenSSH]] projects, and was a founding member of the [[NetBSD]] project. == Childhood == Theo de Raadt is the eldest of four children to a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] father, and a [[South Africa]]n mother, with two sisters and a brother. Concern over the mandatory two-year armed forces [[conscription]] in South Africa led the family to emigrate to Calgary, Alberta, Canada in November 1977. In 1983 the largest [[recession]] in Canada since the [[Great Depression]] sent the family to the [[Yukon]]. Prior to the move de Raadt got his first computer, a [[Commodore VIC-20]], which was soon followed by an [[Amiga]]. It is with these computers that he first began to develop software.<ref>The Age article: [http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/10/07/1097089476287.html "Staying on the cutting edge"].

Accessed April 5, 2006.</ref> In 1992 he obtained a [[BSc]] in [[Computer Science]] from the [[University of Calgary]]. == NetBSD == The [[NetBSD]] project was founded in 1993 by [[Chris Demetriou]], [[Adam Glass]], [[Charles Hannum]], and de Raadt, who collectively felt frustration at the speed and quality of [[Jolix]], the then standard Berkeley software distribution, and believed that a more open development model would be of greater benefit to development of an operating system. Jolix, also known as [[386BSD]], was derived from the original University of California Berkeley's 4.3BSD release, while the new NetBSD project would merge relevant code from the Networking/2 and 386BSD releases. The new project would centre its focus on clean, portable, correct code with the goal being to produce a unified, multi-platform, production-quality, BSD-based operating system. Because of the importance of networks such as the Internet in the distributed, collaborative nature of its development, de Raadt suggested the name "NetBSD", which the three other founders agreed upon.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The first NetBSD source code repository was established on March 21, 1993 and the initial release, NetBSD 0.8, was made in April, [[1993]]. This was derived from 386BSD 0.1 plus the version 0.2.2 unofficial patchkit, with several programs from the Net/2 release missing from 386BSD re-integrated, and various other improvements. In August the [[1993|same year]], NetBSD 0.9 was released, which contained many enhancements and bug fixes. This was still a [[PC compatible|PC]]-platform-only release, although by this time work was underway to add support for other architectures. NetBSD 1.0 was released in October, [[1994]]. This was the first multi-platform release, supporting the [[IBM PC compatible]], [[HP 9000]] Series 300, [[Amiga]], [[68k]] [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]], [[Sun-4]]c series and [[PC532]]. Also in this release, the legally-encumbered Net/2-derived source code was replaced with equivalent code from 4.4BSD-lite, in accordance with the [[USL v BSDi]] lawsuit settlement. De Raadt played a vital role in the creation of the [[SPARC]] port, as together with Chuck Cranor [http://chuck.cranor.org/], he implemented much of the initial code. == OpenBSD == In December 1994, de Raadt was asked to resign his position as a senior developer and member of the NetBSD core team, and his access to the source code repository was revoked. The reason for this is not wholly clear, although there are claims that it was due to personality clashes within the NetBSD project and on its [[Electronic mailing list|mailing lists]].<ref name="glass">Glass, Adam.
