While the option exists and is quite popular, developers are not required to use the Cydia Store system to charge for packages. LockInfo, MewSeek, biteSMS, and WiFi Sync are four examples of such packages; they must be registered separately from the Cydia Store through the developers' own means. ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.saurik.com/id/1 Bringing Debian APT to the iPhone] by Jay Freeman (saurik), February 2008 *[http://www.informationweek.com/news/personal_tech/iphone/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=215801027&cid=RSSfeed_twitter Apple's iTunes Store Challenged By Rogue Developers], ''[[InformationWeek]]'', March 8, 2009 *[http://blogs.zdnet.com/amr-research/?p=136 Cydia and Apple: Lawsuits will be a sideshow], [[ZDnet]], March 6, 2009 *[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/13/technology/13jailbreak.html?pagewanted=all Unofficial Software Incurs Apple's Wrath], ''[[New York Times]]'', May 12, 2009 *[http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/08/cydia-app-store/ Rejected By Apple, iPhone Developers Go Underground], ''Wired'', August 6, 2009 *[http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/11/jailbreak-community/ Jailbreakers Battle Apple for Control of iPhone], ''Wired'', November 12, 2009 *[http://www.tuaw.com/2010/09/11/alliance-of-the-jailbreakers-cydia-acquires-rock/ Alliance of the jailbreakers: Cydia acquires Rock], ''TUAW'', September 12, 2010 [[Category:Unix package management-related software]] [[Category:Dpkg]] [[Category:Homebrew software]] [[Category:iOS (Apple)]] [[de:Cydia]] [[fr:Cydia]] [[it:Cydia]] [[nl:Cydia]] [[simple:Cydia]]</text> </page> <page> <id>8850</id> <title>Cygwin</title> <text>{{Infobox software | name = Cygwin | screenshot = [[Image:Cygwin X11 rootless WinXP.png|250px]] | caption = Running Cygwin under [[Windows XP]] | author = [[Cygnus Solutions]] | developer = [[Cygnus Solutions]], [[Red Hat]], others | released = 1995 | latest release version = 1.7.7-1<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin-announce/2010-08/msg00035.html|title=Updated: cygwin-1.7.7-1}}</ref> | latest release date = {{start date and age|2010|08|31}} | operating system = [[Microsoft Windows]] | programming language = [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]] | genre = [[Compatibility layer]] | license = [[GNU General Public License#Version 2|GNU GPLv2]] | website = {{URL|http://www.cygwin.com}} }} '''Cygwin''' ({{pronEng|ˈsɪɡwɪn}},<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2004-09/msg00702.html | title = Re: How do you pronounce it? | author = Larry Hall | date = 2004-09-14 | accessdate = 2007-10-10}}</ref> {{respell|SIG|win}}) is a [[Unix-like]] environment and command-line interface for [[Microsoft Windows]]. Cygwin provides native integration of Windows-based applications, data, and other system resources with applications, software tools, and data of the Unix-like environment. Thus it is possible to launch Windows applications from the Cygwin environment, as well as to use Cygwin tools and applications within the Windows operating context. Cygwin consists of two parts: a [[dynamic-link library]] (DLL) as an API compatibility layer providing a substantial part of the [[POSIX]] API functionality, and an extensive collection of [[Programming tool|software tools]] and applications that provide a Unix-like [[look and feel]]. Cygwin was originally developed by [[Cygnus Solutions]], which was later acquired by [[Red Hat]]. It is [[free and open source software]], released under the [[GNU General Public License]] version 2. Today it is maintained by employees of Red Hat, [[NetApp]] and many other volunteers. ==Description== Cygwin consists of a library that implements the [[POSIX]] system call [[application programming interface|API]] in terms of [[Win32]] system calls, a [[GNU]] development toolchain (such as [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] and [[GNU Debugger|GDB]]) to allow software development, and a large number of application programs equivalent to those on [[Unix]] systems. Many Unix programs have been ported to Cygwin, including the [[X Window System]], [[KDE]], [[GNOME]],<ref>[http://cygwinports.dotsrc.org/ Cygwin Ports]</ref> [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]], and [[TeX]]. Cygwin permits installing [[inetd]], [[syslogd]], [[Secure Shell|sshd]], [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]], and other daemons as standard Windows services, allowing Microsoft Windows systems to emulate [[Unix]] and [[Linux]] servers. Cygwin programs are installed by running Cygwin's "setup" program, which downloads the necessary program and feature package files from repositories on the Internet. Setup can install, update, and remove programs and their source code packages. A full installation may take up to 4 GB of hard disk space. Efforts to reconcile concepts that differ between Unix and Windows systems include: *A Cygwin-specific version of the Unix [[Mount (computing)|mount]] command allows Windows paths to be mounted as "filesystems" in the Unix file space. Initial mount points can be configured in <code>[[fstab|/etc/fstab]]</code>, which has a very similar format as on Unix systems, except that Windows paths appear in place of devices. Filesystems can be mounted in binary mode (by default), or in text mode, which enables automatic conversion between [[Newline|LF and CRLF endings]] (which only affects programs that open files without explicitly specifying text or binary mode). *Cygwin 1.7 introduced comprehensive support for POSIX [[Locale|locales]] and many [[Character encoding|character encodings]], whereby the [[UTF-8]] [[Unicode]] encoding became the default. Windows file names and other identifiers, which are encoded as [[UTF-16]], are automatically converted to and from the selected character encoding. *Windows [[Drive letter|drive letters]] are mapped to a special directory, so for example <code>C:</code> appears as <code>/cygdrive/c</code>. The <code>/cygdrive</code> prefix can be changed. Windows network paths of the form <code>\\HOST\SHARE\FILE</code> are mapped to <code>//HOST/SHARE/FILE</code>. Windows paths can also be used directly from Cygwin programs, but many programs do not support them correctly, hence this is discouraged. *Full-featured <code>[[/dev]]</code> and <code>[[/proc]]</code> file systems are provided. <code>/proc/registry</code> provides direct filesystem access to the registry. *POSIX [[Symbolic link|symbolic links]] are supported. They are represented as plain text files with the system
