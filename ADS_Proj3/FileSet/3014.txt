4 as well as many other [[video codecs]]. ==Algorithms== The methods for finding motion vectors can be categorised into pixel based methods ("direct") and feature based methods ("indirect"). A famous debate resulted in two papers from the opposing factions being produced to try to establish a conclusion<ref>Philip H.S. Torr and Andrew Zisserman: Feature Based Methods for Structure and Motion Estimation, ICCV Workshop on Vision Algorithms, pages 278-294, 1999</ref><ref>Michal Irani and P. Anandan: About Direct Methods, ICCV Workshop on Vision Algorithms, pages 267-277, 1999.</ref>. ===Direct Methods=== * [[Block-matching algorithm]] * [[Phase correlation]] and frequency domain methods * Pixel recursive algorithms * [[Maximum a posteriori|MAP]]/[[Markov network|MRF]] type "Bayesian" estimators * [[Optical flow]] ====Evaluation Metrics==== {{Anchor|Metrics}} In ''direct methods'' several evaluation metrics can be used. * [[mean squared error|Mean Squared Error]] (MSE) * [[sum of absolute differences|Sum of Absolute Differences]] (SAD) * [[Mean Absolute Difference]] (MAD) * [[Sum of Squared Errors]] (SSE) * [[Sum of Absolute Transformed Differences]] (SATD) ===Indirect Methods=== ''Indirect methods'' use features, such as [[Harris corner]]s, and match corresponding features between frames, usually with a statistical function applied over a local or global area. The purpose of the statistical function is to remove matches that do not correspond to the actual motion. Statistical functions that have been successfully used include [[RANSAC]]. ==References== <references/> [[Category:Video processing]] [[Category:Motion]] [[Category:Estimation theory]] [[ca:Estimació de moviment]] [[es:Estimación de Movimiento]]</text> </page> <page> <id>25143</id> <title>Motion picture rating system</title> <text>{{Redirect|Parental Guidance|the Singaporean TV series|Parental Guidance (TV series)|the song by Judas Priest|Parental Guidance (Judas Priest song)}} {{Multiple issues | POV=October 2009 | refimprove=June 2008 }} <!--{{notenglish|date=October 2008}}--> A '''motion picture rating system''' is designated to classify films with regard to suitability for audiences in terms of issues such as sex, violence, substance abuse, profanity, impudence or other types of mature content. A particular issued rating is called a '''certification'''. This is designed to help parents decide whether a movie is suitable for their children. Yet, the effectiveness of these suspenders is widely disputed. Also, in some jurisdictions a rating may impose on [[movie theater]]s the legal obligation of refusing the entrance of children or minors to the movie. Furthermore, where movie theaters do not have this legal obligation, they may enforce restrictions on their own. Ratings are often given in lieu of [[censorship]]. In countries such as Australia, an official government body decides on ratings; in other countries, such as the United States, it is done by industry committees with little, if any official government status. In most countries, however, films that are considered morally offensive have been censored, restricted, or banned. Even if the film rating system has no legal consequences, and a film has not explicitly been restricted or banned, there are usually laws forbidding certain films, or forbidding minors to view them. The influence of specific factors in deciding a rating varies from country to country. For example, in countries such as the US, films with strong sexual content are often restricted to adult viewers, whereas in countries such as France and Germany, sexual content is viewed much more leniently. On the other hand, films with violent content are often subject in countries such as Germany and Finland to high ratings and even censorship, whereas countries such as the US offer more lenient ratings to violent movies. Other factors may or may not influence the classification process, such as being set within a non-fictional historical context, whether the film glorifies violence or drug use, whether said violence or drug use is carried out by the protagonist, with whom the viewer should empathize, or by the antagonist. In Germany, for example, films depicting explicit war violence in a real war context (such as the Second World War) are handled more leniently than films with purely fictional settings. A film may be produced with a particular rating in mind. It may be [[Re-edited film|re-edited]] if the desired rating is not obtained, especially to avoid a higher rating than intended. A film may also be re-edited to produce an alternate version for other countries. ==Comparison== A comparison of currently active film rating systems, showing age on the horizontal axis. <!-- total colspan equals 18, one for each possible year. --> {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center" |- !
