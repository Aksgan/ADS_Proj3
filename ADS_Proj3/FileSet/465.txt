early milestone in the rise in importance of blogs came in 2002, when many bloggers focused on comments by [[United States Senate Majority Leader|U.S. Senate Majority Leader]] [[Trent Lott]].<ref name="massing essay"/> Senator Lott, at a party honoring [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Strom Thurmond]], praised Senator Thurmond by suggesting that the United States would have been better off had Thurmond been elected president. Lott's critics saw these comments as a tacit approval of [[racial segregation]], a policy advocated by Thurmond's [[U.S. presidential election, 1948|1948 presidential campaign]]. This view was reinforced by documents and recorded interviews dug up by bloggers. (See [[Josh Marshall]]'s ''[[Talking Points Memo]]''.) Though Lott's comments were made at a public event attended by the media, no major media organizations reported on his controversial comments until after blogs broke the story. Blogging helped to create a political crisis that forced Lott to step down as majority leader. Similarly, blogs were among the driving forces behind the "[[Rathergate]]" scandal. To wit: (television journalist) [[Dan Rather]] presented documents (on the CBS show ''[[60 Minutes]]'') that conflicted with accepted accounts of President Bush's military service record. Bloggers declared the documents to be [[forgery|forgeries]] and presented evidence and arguments in support of that view. Consequently, CBS apologized for what it said were inadequate reporting techniques (see [[Little Green Footballs]]). Many bloggers view this scandal as the advent of blogs' acceptance by the mass media, both as a news source and opinion and as means of applying political pressure. The impact of these stories gave greater credibility to blogs as a medium of news dissemination. Though often seen as partisan gossips,{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} bloggers sometimes lead the way in bringing key information to public light, with mainstream media having to follow their lead. More often, however, news blogs tend to react to material already published by the mainstream media. Meanwhile, an increasing number of experts blogged, making blogs a source of in-depth analysis. (See [[Daniel Drezner]], [[J. Bradford DeLong]] or [[Brad Setser]].) ===Mainstream popularity=== By 2004, the role of blogs became increasingly mainstream, as [[political consultant]]s, news services, and candidates began using them as tools for outreach and opinion forming. Blogging was established by politicians and political candidates to express opinions on war and other issues and cemented blogs' role as a news source. (See [[Howard Dean]] and [[Wesley Clark]].) Even politicians not actively campaigning, such as the [[Labour Party (UK)|UK's Labour Party's]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Tom Watson (politician)|Tom Watson]], began to blog to bond with constituents. In January 2005, ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine listed eight bloggers that business people "could not ignore": [[Engadget|Peter Rojas]], [[Xeni Jardin]], [[Ben Trott]], [[Mena Trott]], [[Jonathan I. Schwartz|Jonathan Schwartz]], Jason Goldman, [[Robert Scoble]], and [[Jason Calacanis]].<ref>http://www.fortune.com/fortune/technology/articles/0,15114,1011763-1,00.html {{Dead link|date=October 2009}}</ref> [[Israel]]'s was among the first national governments to set up an official blog.<ref name=Ynet>[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3220593,00.html Israel Video Blog aims to show the world 'the beautiful face of real Israel'], Ynet, February 24, 2008.</ref> Under [[David Saranga]], the [[Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] became active in adopting [[Web 2.0]] initiatives, including an official [[video blog]]<ref name=Ynet/> and a [[political blog]].<ref name=Ynet3>[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3220593,00.html Latest PR venture of Israel's diplomatic mission in New York attracts large Arab audience], Ynet, June 21, 2007.</ref> The Foreign Ministry also held a [[microblogging]] press conference via [[Twitter]] about its [[2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict|war with Hamas]], with Saranga answering questions from the public in common text-messaging abbreviations during a live worldwide [[press conference]].<ref name=JP>[http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1230456533492&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull Battlefront Twitter]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}, HAVIV RETTIG GUR, ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', December 30, 2008.</ref> The questions and answers were later posted on [[IsraelPolitik]], the country's official political blog.<ref name=NYTs>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/weekinreview/04cohen.html The Toughest Q’s Answered in the Briefest Tweets], Noam Cohen, ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 3, 2009.

In 2009, the presence of the American journalism industry had declined to the point that several newspaper corporations were filing for bankruptcy, resulting in less direct competition between newspapers within the same circulation area. Discussion emerged as to whether the newspaper industry would benefit from a stimulus package by the federal government. President Barack Obama acknowledged the emerging influence of blogging upon society by saying "if the direction of the news is all blogosphere, all opinions, with no serious fact-checking, no serious attempts to put stories in context, that what you will end up getting is people shouting at each other across the void but not a lot of mutual understanding”.<ref>[http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20091103/OPINION16/91102031/1004/OPINION/Journalists-deserve-subsidies-too Journalists deserve subsidies too], ROBERT W.

Personal bloggers usually take pride in their blog posts, even if their blog is never read. Blogs often become more than a way to just communicate; they become a way to reflect on life, or works of art. Blogging can have a sentimental quality. Few personal blogs rise to fame and the mainstream, but some personal blogs quickly garner an extensive following. One type of personal blog, referred to as a microblog, is extremely detailed and seeks to capture a moment in time. Some sites, such as [[Twitter]], allow bloggers to share thoughts and feelings instantaneously with friends and family, and are much faster than emailing or writing. ;Corporate and organizational blogs: A blog can be private, as in most cases, or it can be for [[business]] purposes. Blogs used internally to enhance the communication and culture in a [[corporation]] or externally for [[marketing]], [[brand]]ing or [[public relations]] purposes are called [[corporate blog]]s. Similar blogs for clubs and societies are called club blogs, group blogs, or by similar names; typical use is to inform members and other interested parties of club and member activities. ;By [[genre]]: Some blogs focus on a particular subject, such as [[political blog]]s, [[travel
