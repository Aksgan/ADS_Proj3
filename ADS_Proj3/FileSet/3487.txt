is usually not the same as the liquid composition the vapor is in equilibrium with. See [[Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium#Boiling_point_diagrams|Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium]] for a fuller discussion. In addition to the above mentioned types of phase diagrams, there are thousands of other possible combinations. Some of the major features of phase diagrams include congruent points, where a solid phase transforms directly into a liquid. There is also the [[peritectoid]], a point where two solid phases combine into one solid phase during cooling. The inverse of this, when one solid phase transforms into two solid phases during heating, is called the eutectoid. A complex phase diagram of great technological importance is that of the [[iron]]-[[carbon]] system for less than 7% carbon (see [[steel]]). The x-axis of such a diagram represents the concentration variable of the mixture. As the mixtures are typically far from dilute and their density as a function of temperature is usually unknown, the preferred concentration measure is [[mole fraction]]. A volume based measure like [[molarity]] would be unadvisable. === Crystal phase diagrams=== [[Polymorphism (biology)|Polymorphic]] and [[Polyamorphism|polyamorphic]] substances have multiple [[crystal]] or [[amorphous]] phases, which can be graphed in a similar fashion to solid, liquid, and gas phases.

The Roman numerals indicate various ice phases as described at [[Ice#Phases]].]] In [[liquid crystal]] physics, phase diagrams are used in the case of mixing of [[nematogenic]] compounds to distinguish between the [[isotropic]] liquid phase, the [[nematic]] liquid phase. == See also == * [[CALPHAD (method)]] * [[Congruent melting]] and [[incongruent melting]] * [[Gibbs phase rule]] * [[Glass databases]] * [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] * [[Phase separation]] * [[Schreinemaker's analysis]] == References == <!-- Reference 1 covers most of the article.--> {{reflist}} == External links == {{Commons|Phase diagram}} * [http://www.sv.vt.edu/classes/MSE2094_NoteBook/96ClassProj/examples/kimcon.html Iron-Iron Carbide Phase Diagram Example] * [http://www.soton.ac.uk/~pasr1/build.htm How to build a phase diagram] * [http://www.chm.davidson.edu/ChemistryApplets/PhaseChanges/PhaseDiagram1.html Phase Changes: Phase Diagrams: Part 1] * [http://www.matter.org.uk/steelmatter/metallurgy/6_1_3_1.html Equilibrium Fe-C phase diagram] * [http://mtdata.software.googlepages.com/periodictableSolders.htm Phase diagrams for lead free solders] * [http://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/miclib/phase_diagrams.php DoITPoMS Phase Diagram Library] * [http://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/tlplib/phase-diagrams/index.php DoITPoMS Teaching and Learning Package- "Phase Diagrams and Solidification"] [[Category:Phase changes]] [[Category:Equilibrium chemistry]] [[Category:Materials science]] [[Category:Metallurgy]] [[Category:Charts]] [[Category:Diagrams]] [[ar:مخطط الطور]] [[bs:Fazni dijagram]] [[bg:Фазова диаграма]] [[ca:Diagrama de fases]] [[cs:Fázový diagram]] [[de:Phasendiagramm]] [[el:Διάγραμμα φάσεων]] [[es:Diagrama de fase]] [[eo:Fazodiagramo]] [[fa:نمودار فازی]] [[fr:Diagramme de phase]] [[ko:상평형 그림]] [[hr:Fazni dijagram]] [[id:Diagram fase]] [[is:Fasarit]] [[it:Diagramma di fase]] [[lv:Fāzu stāvokļa diagramma]] [[ms:Gambar rajah fasa]] [[nl:Fasediagram]] [[ja:相図]] [[no:Fasediagram]] [[nn:Fasediagram]] [[pl:Wykres fazowy]] [[pt:Diagrama de fase]] [[ru:Фазовая диаграмма]] [[sk:Fázový diagram]] [[sl:Fazni diagram]] [[sr:Фазни дијаграм]] [[fi:Faasidiagrammi]] [[sv:Fasdiagram]] [[tr:Faz diyagramı]] [[uk:Фазова діаграма]] [[zh:相图]]</text> </page> <page> <id>29061</id> <title>Phenomenology (philosophy)</title> <text>{{Refimprove|date=April 2009}}'''Phenomenology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ''phainómenon'' "that which appears"; and ''lógos'' "study") is a broad [[philosophical movement]] emphasizing the study of conscious experience. It was founded in the early years of the 20th century by [[Edmund Husserl]], expanded together with a circle of his followers at the universities of [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] and [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]] in [[Germany]], and spread across to [[France]], the [[United States]], and elsewhere, often in contexts far removed from Husserl's early work. Phenomenology, in Husserl's conception, is primarily concerned with the systematic reflection on and analysis of the structures of [[consciousness]], and the [[phenomena]] which appear in acts of consciousness. Philosopher [[Stephen Hicks]]<ref>Hicks, Stephen R.C. (2004). Explaining Postmodernism: Skepticism and Socialism from Rousseau to Foucault. Tempe, AZ: Scholargy Press, ISBN 1-59274-646-5 P. 43-44.</ref> describes Phenomenology as an outgrowth of European [[Kant]]ianism, which must be considered in relation to [[Structural linguistics]]: :Neo-Kantianism evolved during the nineteenth century, and by the twentieth century two main forms had emerged. One form was Structuralism, of which [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] was a prominent exponent, representing the broadly rationalist wing of Kantianism. The other was Phenomenology, of which Edmund Husserl was a prominent representative, representing the broadly empiricist wing of Kantianism. Structuralism was a linguistic version of Kantianism, holding that language is a self-contained, non-referential system, and that the philosophical task was to seek out language’s necessary and universal structural features, those features taken to underlie and be prior to the empirical, contingent features of language. Phenomenology’s focus was upon careful examination of the contingent flow of the experiential given, avoiding any existential inferences or assumptions about what one experiences, and seeking simply to describe experience as neutrally and as clearly as possible. In effect, the Structuralists were seeking subjective [[noumenal]] categories, and the Phenomenologists were content with describing the phenomena without asking what connection to an external reality those experiences might have. Such descriptions in Phenomenology were to take place from a highly modified "first person" viewpoint, studying phenomena not as they appear to "my" consciousness, but to ''any'' consciousness whatsoever. Husserl believed that phenomenology could thus provide a firm basis for all human [[knowledge]], including scientific knowledge, and could establish philosophy as a "rigorous science" of measurable perception. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. Husserl's conception of phenomenology has been criticised and developed not only by himself, but also by his students [[Edith Stein]] and [[Martin Heidegger]], by [[existentialists]], such as [[Max Scheler]], [[Nicolai Hartmann]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], and by other philosophers, such as [[Paul Ricoeur]], [[Emmanuel Levinas]], and sociologists [[Alfred Schütz]] and [[Eric Voegelin]]. ==The idea of phenomenology== In its most basic form, phenomenology attempts to create conditions for the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] study of topics usually regarded as [[subject (philosophy)|subjective]]: consciousness and the content of conscious experiences such as [[judgments]], [[perceptions]], and [[emotions]]. Although phenomenology seeks to be scientific, it does not attempt to study consciousness from the perspective of clinical psychology or neurology. Instead, it seeks through systematic reflection to determine the essential properties and structures of consciousness and [[conscious experience]]. Husserl derived many important concepts central to phenomenology from the works and lectures of his teachers, the philosophers and psychologists [[Franz Brentano]] and [[Carl Stumpf]].<ref>{{citation |first=Robin |last=Rollinger |title=Husserl's Position in the School of Brentano |publisher=Kluwer |place= Dordrecht / Boston / London |year=1999 }}</ref> An important element of phenomenology that Husserl borrowed from Brentano was [[intentionality]] (often described as "aboutness"), the notion that consciousness is always consciousness ''of'' something. The object of consciousness is called the ''intentional object'', and this object
