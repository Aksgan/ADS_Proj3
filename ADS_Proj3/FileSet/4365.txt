determine the customer’s issue by analyzing the symptoms and figuring out the underlying problem.<ref name = walker/> When analyzing the symptoms, it is important for the [[technician]] to identify what the customer is trying to accomplish so that time is not wasted on “attempting to solve a symptom instead of a problem.” <ref name = walker/> Once identification of the underlying problem is established, the specialist can begin sorting through the possible solutions available. Technical support specialists in this group typically handle straightforward and simple problems while “possibly using some kind of knowledge management tool.” <ref name = windley>{{cite news | author= Windley, Phillip J. | title= “Delivering High Availability Services Using a Multi-Tiered Support Model” | year = 2002 | work=Windley’s Technometria | url=http://www.windley.com/docs/Tiered%20Support.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2008-05-03}}</ref> This includes troubleshooting methods such as verifying physical layer issues, resolving username and password problems, uninstalling/reinstalling basic [[software applications]], verification of proper [[hardware]] and [[software]] set up, and assistance with navigating around application menus.

It is synonymous with level 2 support, support line 2, administrative level support, and various other headings denoting advanced technical [[troubleshooting]] and analysis methods. [[Technicians]] in this realm of knowledge are responsible for assisting Tier I personnel solve basic technical problems and for investigating elevated issues by confirming the validity of the problem and seeking for known solutions related to these more complex issues.<ref name=kajko/> However, prior to the [[troubleshooting]] process, it is important that the technician review the work order to see what has already been accomplished by the Tier I technician and how long the technician has been working with the particular customer. This is a key element in meeting both the customer and business needs as it allows the technician to prioritize the troubleshooting process and properly manage his or her time.<ref name = walker/> If a problem is new and/or personnel from this group cannot determine a solution, they are responsible for raising this issue to the Tier III technical support group. In addition, many companies may specify that certain troubleshooting solutions be performed by this group to help ensure the intricacies of a challenging issue are solved by providing experienced and knowledgeable technicians. This may include, but is not limited to onsite installations or replacements of various hardware components, software repair, diagnostic testing, and the utilization of remote control tools used to take over the user’s machine for the sole purpose of troubleshooting and finding a solution to the problem.<ref name = walker/><ref name=nelson>{{cite journal | author = Leung, Nelson K.

It is synonymous with level 3 support, back-end support, support line 3, high-end support, and various other headings denoting expert level troubleshooting and analysis methods. These individuals are experts in their fields and are responsible for not only assisting both Tier I and Tier II personnel, but with the research and development of solutions to new or unknown issues. Note that Tier III technicians have the same responsibility as Tier II technicians in reviewing the work order and assessing the time already spent with the customer so that the work is prioritized and time management is sufficiently utilized.<ref name = walker/> If it is at all possible, the [[technician]] will work to solve the problem with the customer as it may become apparent that the Tier I and/or Tier II technicians simply failed to discover the proper solution. Upon encountering new problems; however, Tier III personnel must first determine whether or not to solve the problem and may require the customer’s contact information so that the technician can have adequate time to troubleshoot the issue and find a solution.<ref name=kajko/> In some instances, an issue may be so problematic to the point where the product cannot be salvaged and must be replaced. Such extreme problems are also sent to the original developers for in-depth analysis. If it is determined that a problem can be solved, this group is responsible for designing and developing one or more courses of action, evaluating each of these courses in a test case environment, and implementing the best solution to the problem.<ref name=kajko/> Once the solution is verified, it is delivered to the customer and made available for future troubleshooting and analysis. ===Level 4(L4)=== While not universally used, a fourth level often represents an escalation point beyond the organization. This is generally a hardware or software vendor. Within a corporate incident management system it is important to continue to track incidents even when they are being actioned by a vendor and the [[Service Level Agreement]] (SLA) may have specific provision for this. == Remote PC repair or Remote Computer Repair == '''Remote PC repair''' or '''Remote Computer Repair''' is a method for troubleshooting software related problems via [[remote desktop]] connections <ref>{{cite news | first=Jack | last=Germain | coauthors= | title=Remote PC Repair, Part 1: The Warranty Alternative | date=2007-07-30 | publisher= | url =http://www.technewsworld.com/story/60053.html | work =TechNewsWorld | pages = | accessdate = 2008-03-04 | language = }}</ref>.
