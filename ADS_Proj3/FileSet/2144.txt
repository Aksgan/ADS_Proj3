The word ''infinitesimal'' comes from a 17th century [[Modern Latin]] coinage ''infinitesimus'', which originally referred to the "[[infinite]][[Ordinal number (linguistics)|-th]]" item in a series. In common speech, an infinitesimal object is an object which is smaller than any feasible measurement, hence not zero size, but so small that it cannot be distinguished from zero by any available means. Hence, when used as an adjective, "infinitesimal" in the vernacular means "extremely small". Before the nineteenth century none of the mathematical concepts relating to infinitesimals as we know them today were formally defined, but many of these concepts were already used. The founders of [[infinitesimal calculus]] &mdash; [[Euler]], [[Leibniz]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Cauchy]], and many others &mdash; calculated with infinitesimals and achieved correct results even though the definitions available at the time came to be thought of as insufficiently precise by the followers of [[Weierstrass]] in the 1870s. For example, [[Cauchy]] defined infinitesimals in terms of variable quantities (such as sequences) tending to zero. == History of the infinitesimal == The notion of infinitesimally small quantities was discussed by the [[Eleatic School]]. [[Archimedes]], in ''[[The Method of Mechanical Theorems]]'', was the first to propose a logically rigorous definition of infinitesimals.<ref>Archimedes, ''The Method of Mechanical Theorems''; see [[Archimedes Palimpsest]]</ref> His [[Archimedean property]] defines a number ''x'' as infinite if it satisfies the conditions |x|>1, |x|>1+1, |x|>1+1+1, ..., and infinitesimal if x≠0 and a similar set of conditions holds for 1/x and the reciprocals of the positive integers. A number system is said to be Archimedean if it contains no infinite or infinitesimal members. In the ancient Greek system of mathematics, 1 represents the length of some line segment which has arbitrarily been picked as the unit of measurement.

As an alternative to infinitesimals, the [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics]] in the 14th to 16th centuries made use of an intuitive notion of a [[Limit of a sequence|limit]] to compute several [[Series (mathematics)|series]] expansions.<ref name=roy>Roy, Ranjan. 1990.

The use of infinitesimals was attacked as incorrect by [[George Berkeley|Bishop Berkeley]] in his work ''[[The Analyst]]''.<ref>George Berkeley, ''The Analyst; or a discourse addressed to an infidel mathematician''</ref> Although mathematicians, scientists, and engineers continued to use infinitesimals to produce correct results, it was not until the second half of the nineteenth century that the calculus was given a formal mathematical foundation by [[Karl Weierstrass]] and others using the notion of a limit. While infinitesimals eventually disappeared from the calculus, their mathematical study continued through the work of [[Tullio Levi-Civita|Levi-Civita]] and others, throughout the late nineteenth and the twentieth centuries, as documented by Ehrlich (2006). In the 20th century, it was found that infinitesimals could also be treated rigorously. Neither formulation is wrong, and both give the same results if used correctly. ==First-order properties== In extending the real numbers to include infinite and infinitesimal quantities, one typically wishes to be as conservative as possible by not changing any of their elementary properties. This guarantees
