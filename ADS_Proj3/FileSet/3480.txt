Salus''' is a [[linguistics|linguist]], [[computer science|computer scientist]], [[history of science and technology|historian of technology]], [[author]] in many fields, and an editor of books and journals. He has conducted research in [[germanistics]], [[language acquisition]], and [[computer languages]]. He has a 1963 PhD. in Linguistics from New York University. After an intense academic career serving as [[professor]] and [[dean (education)|dean]] at several universities, he is now largely retired. He has also been Executive Director of both the [[USENIX]] Association and the [[Sun User Group]], and Vice President of the [[Free Software Foundation]]; in addition, he has worked for several high tech startups. From 1987 to 1996, he was Managing Editor of ''Computing Systems'' ([[MIT Press]] and the USENIX Association). He is best known for his books on the history of computing, particularly ''A Quarter Century of UNIX'' and ''Casting The Net'' (a history of the Internet up to 1995).

Peter J. Bentley is a Reader and College Fellow at [[University College London|UCL]] and a Collaborating Professor at [[KAIST]]. He is also a [[popular science]] [[author]] and [[consultant]]. He is a contributing editor for [[WIRED]] UK and was the monthly host of the [[Royal Institution]]'s cafe scientifique. Born in [[Colchester]], [[England]], he achieved a [[B.Sc.]] in [[Artificial Intelligence]] from the [[University of Essex]] (supervised by [[Edward Tsang]]) and a [[Ph.D.]] in Evolutionary Design (supervised by Jonathan Wakefield) at the age of 24. His doctorate thesis was entitled ''Generic Evolutionary Design of Solid Objects using a Genetic Algorithm.'' Since 1997 he has performed research into [[evolutionary computation]], [[artificial life]], [[swarm intelligence]], [[artificial immune systems]], [[artificial neural networks]] and other types of [[biologically inspired computing]], which he terms ''Digital Biology.'' He is head of the Digital Biology Interest Group at the Department of Computer Science, [[University College London]]. He participates in science festivals and public events, such as the debate on Complexity and Evolution held at the [[Natural History Museum]] in July 2007 with [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Steve Jones (biologist)]], [[Lewis Wolpert]]. His research has been described in several articles of [[New Scientist]]. His recent research focuses on [[morphological computation (robotics)|morphological computation]] and novel architectures designed for [[natural computation]] based on evolution, developmental and self-assembling systems. Most recently he has received publicity for his [[iphone]] application iStethoscope, which was developed in collaboration with [[cardiologists]] in USA. The app has been used to gather [[heart sounds]] from people around the world in a research project to enable computers to [[diagnose]] [[heart disease]] automatically using [[machine learning]]. ==Popular books== * ''The Undercover Scientist: Investigating the Mishaps of Everyday Life'', ISBN 978-1-84794-523-5 * ''Why Sh*t Happens: The Science of a Really Bad Day'', ISBN 978-1-59486-956-3 (US version of The ''Undercover Scientist'') * ''The Book of Numbers: The Secret of Numbers and How They Changed the World'', ISBN 1-55407-361-8 * ''Digital Biology.
