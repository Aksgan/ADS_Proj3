Wolfgang Nebel - personal page at University of Oldenburg]</ref> ==Biography== Nebel holds a Dipl.-Ing. degree in Electrical Engineering from the [[University of Hanover]] and a Dr.-Ing. degree from the Computer Science Department of the [[University of Kaiserslautern]], where he has worked for [[Reiner Hartenstein]]. In 1987 Nebel joint Philips Semiconductors, Hamburg, and worked as software engineer, CAD project manager and finally became [[CAD software]] development manager. From 1996 to 1998 he served as [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of his department. Additionally since 1998 Nebel has been a member of the executive board of the [[OFFIS]] research center, an institute associated with Oldenburg University. From January 2001 December 2002 Nebel served as vice-president of Oldenburg University. Since June 2005 Nebel has been chairman of the OFFIS research institute. Nebel is co-founder, chairman and CTA of ChipVision Design Systems AG, an EDA start-up company located in [[Oldenburg]], [[San Ramon]], [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] and [[Munich]]. Nebel is and has been involved in several international conferences as program chair or a general chair. He is also active in several additional program committees and professional organizations. His research interest are in methodologies and tools for [[embedded system]] design, in particular: [[object oriented]] HW/SW specification and synthesis as well as [[low power electronic design|design for low power]]. He is an internationally well received expert on computer systems with low [[energy consumption]]{{dn}}. ==References== {{Reflist}} {{Use dmy dates|date=August 2010}} {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME =Nebel | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH =18 November 1956 | PLACE OF BIRTH = | DATE OF DEATH = | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Nebel}} [[Category:1956 births]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:German academics]] [[Category:German computer scientists]] [[Category:University of Hanover alumni]] [[Category:University of Kaiserslautern alumni]] [[Category:University of Oldenburg faculty]] [[de:Wolfgang Nebel]]</text> </page> <page> <id>40437</id> <title>Wolfram Research</title> <text>{{Infobox Company |name = Wolfram Research, Inc. |logo = [[File:Wolfram Research wordmark.svg|250px]] |type = Private |genre = |foundation = 1987 |founder = Wolfram CEO [[Stephen Wolfram]]; co-founder, [[Theodore Gray]] is the company's Director of User Interface Technology.<ref>[http://blog.wolfram.com/2008/10/16/stock-market-returns-by-presidential-party/ Stock Market Returns by Presidential Party by Theodore Gray, Co-founder, Director of User Interfaces], WolframBlog, October 16, 2008]</ref> |location_city = [[Champaign, Illinois]] (worldwide headquarters); [[Oxfordshire]], UK (European headquarters); [[Tokyo, Japan]] (Asian headquarters); with additional locations in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] and [[Paris, France]]. |location_country = |location = <!--modifies "Headquarters" entry--> |origins = Originates in ideas developed by Stephen Wolfram while a MacArthur Fellow in the early 1980s. |key_people = President, [[Stephen Wolfram]] International & Strategic Director, [[Conrad Wolfram]] |area_served = |industry = [[Computer software]], [[Publishing]], [[Research and Development]] |products = ''[[Mathematica]]'', Wolfram ''Workbench'', grid''Mathematica'', web''Mathematica'', Wolfram ''[[Wolfram Alpha|Alpha]]'' |services = |revenue = |operating_income = |net_income = |num_employees = 300+ |parent = |divisions = Wolfram Media Inc., Wolfram Research Europe Ltd. in the United Kingdom and Wolfram Research Asia Ltd. in Japan. |subsid = |owner = Privately held |slogan = |homepage = [http://www.wolfram.com www.wolfram.com] |dissolved = |footnotes = }} {{coord|40.097128|-88.245690|display=title}} '''Wolfram Research''' is a private company that makes mathematics programs.
