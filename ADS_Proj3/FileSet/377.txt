; [[Encryption]] : High capacity removable storage media such as backup tapes present a data security risk if they are lost or stolen.<ref>[http://www.securityfocus.com/news/11048 Backups tapes a backdoor for identity thieves] (28 April 2004). Retrieved on 10 March 2007 </ref> Encrypting the data on these media can mitigate this problem, but presents new problems. Encryption is a CPU intensive process that can slow down backup speeds, and the security of the encrypted backups is only as effective as the security of the key management policy. ; [[Multiplexing]] : When there are many more computers to be backed up than there are destination storage devices, the ability to use a single storage device with several simultaneous backups can be useful. ; Refactoring : The process of rearranging the backup sets in a data repository is known as refactoring. For example, if a backup system uses a single tape each day to store the incremental backups for all the protected computers, restoring one of the computers could potentially require many tapes. Refactoring could be used to consolidate all the backups for a single computer onto a single tape. This is especially useful for backup systems that do ''incrementals forever'' style backups. ; [[Disk staging|Staging]] : Sometimes backup jobs are copied to a staging disk before being copied to tape. This process is sometimes referred to as D2D2T, an acronym for Disk to Disk to Tape. This can be useful if there is a problem matching the speed of the final destination device with the source device as is frequently faced in network-based backup systems. It can also serve as a centralized location for applying other data manipulation techniques. ==Managing the backup process== It is important to understand that backing up is a process. As long as new data is being created and changes are being made, backups will need to be updated. Individuals and organizations with anything from one computer to thousands (or even millions) of computer systems all have requirements for protecting data. While the scale is different, the objectives and limitations are essentially the same. Likewise, those who perform backups need to know to what extent they were successful, regardless of scale. ===Objectives=== ; [[Recovery point objective]] (RPO) : The point in time that the restarted infrastructure will reflect. Essentially, this is the roll-back that will be experienced as a result of the recovery. The most desirable RPO would be the point just prior to the data loss event. Making a more recent recovery point achievable requires increasing the frequency of [[file synchronization|synchronization]] between the source data and the backup repository.<ref>[http://www.riskythinking.com/glossary/recovery_point_objective.php Definition of ''recovery point objective'']. Retrieved on 10 March 2007 </ref> ; [[Recovery time objective]] (RTO) : The amount of time elapsed between disaster and restoration of business functions.<ref>[http://www.riskythinking.com/glossary/recovery_time_objective.php Definition of ''recovery time objective'']. Retrieved on 7 March 2007 </ref> ; [[Data security]] : In addition to preserving access to data for its owners, data must be restricted from unauthorized access. Backups must be performed in a manner that does not compromise the original owner's undertaking. This can be achieved with data encryption and proper media handling policies. ===Limitations=== An effective backup scheme will take into consideration the limitations of the situation. ; Backup window : The period of time when backups are permitted to run on a system is called the backup window. This is typically the time when the system sees the least usage and the backup process will have the least amount of interference with normal operations. The backup window is usually planned with users' convenience in mind. If a backup extends past the defined backup window, a decision is made whether it is more beneficial to abort the backup or to lengthen the backup window. ; Performance impact : All backup schemes have some performance impact on the system being backed up. For example, for the period of time that a computer system is being backed up, the hard drive is busy reading files for the purpose of backing up, and its full bandwidth is no longer available for other tasks. Such impacts should be analyzed. ; Costs of hardware, software, labor : All types of storage media have a finite capacity with a real cost. Matching the correct amount of storage capacity (over time) with the backup needs is an important part of the design of a backup scheme. Any backup scheme has some labor requirement, but complicated schemes have considerably higher labor requirements. The cost of commercial backup software can also be considerable. ; Network bandwidth : Distributed backup systems can be affected by limited network bandwidth. ===Implementation=== Meeting the defined objectives in the face of the above limitations can be a difficult task. The tools and concepts below can make that task more achievable. ; Scheduling : Using a [[job scheduler]] can greatly improve the reliability and consistency of backups by removing part of the human element. Many backup software packages include this functionality. ; Authentication : Over the course of regular operations, the user accounts and/or system agents that perform the backups need to be authenticated at some level. The power to copy all data off of or onto a system requires unrestricted access. Using an authentication mechanism is a good way to prevent the backup scheme from being used for unauthorized activity. ; [[Chain of trust]] : Removable [[storage media]] are physical items and must only be handled by trusted individuals. Establishing a chain of trusted individuals (and vendors) is critical to defining the security of the data. ===Measuring the process=== To ensure that the backup scheme is working as expected, the process needs to include monitoring key factors and maintaining historical data. ; [[Backup validation]] : (also known as "backup success validation") The process by which owners of data can get information about how their data was backed up. This same process is also used to prove compliance to regulatory bodies outside of the organization, for example, an insurance company might be required under [[HIPAA]] to show "proof" that their
