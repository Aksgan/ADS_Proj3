user's hostname while communicating with the SMTP server. Susimail is a web-based e-mail client intended primarily for use with Postman's mail servers, and is designed with security and anonymity in mind. It is currently included in the default I2P distribution, and can be accessed through the I2P router console web interface. (Note that this is only used to read and send e-mail, not to create or manage your mail.i2p account; the latter must be done at ''hq.postman.i2p''.) ===I2P-Bote=== I2P-Bote is an end-to-end encrypted, network-internal, fully decentralized (serverless) e-mail system. It supports different identities and does not expose e-mail headers. Currently, it is still alpha software and can only be accessed via its web interface, but it will soon have pop3 support. All bote-mails are automatically end-to-end encrypted and optionally signed and thus authenticated, so that there's no need to set up e-mail encryption apart (though you can do that). I2P-Bote offers additional anonymity by providing a high-latency transport option. As it is decentralized, there is no e-mail server that could link different e-mail identities as communicating with each other (''profiling''): Even the nodes relaying the mails do not know the sender, and apart from sender and receiver, only the end of the high-latency mail route and the storing nodes will know to whom (which anonymous identity, yet of course not the real world identity) the mail is destined. The original sender can have gone offline long before the mail becomes available on the other side. This adds on the degree of anonymity that can be reached with I2P. For those who do not want high delays: All these settings are user-adjustable, so each user decides on how much anonymity he wants. ===I2P-Messenger=== There is also a simple Qt-based, serverless, end-to-end-encrypted [[instant messenger]] for I2P. No servers can log your conversations, no ISP can log whom you chat with, when or for how long. It supports filetransfer. As it is serverless, it can make use of I2P's end-to-end encryption, so that there's not a single node between you and your contacts that could read the plain text. It can be used for fully anonymous instant communication with persons you don't even know, or alternatively to securely and untraceably communicate with friends, family members or colleagues - without any (governmental) observer being able to monitor who you connect to and when you do this, thus it is a useful tool against data retention in a surveillance society, as well. ===IRC=== There are I2P-internal [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] servers reachable anonymously by pointing your IRC client to the server 127.0.0.1 port 6668 (or your i2p node's ip number and the port you configured for your ircproxy tunnel). In xchat that would be 127.0.0.1/6668. For help join #i2p-help ( irc://127.0.0.1:6668/#i2p-help ). ===Syndie=== [[Syndie]] is a [[blog]]ging application for I2P which is also usable through the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] network; it is currently at an alpha release. ==I2P terminology== I2P users will see references to the following terms on the I2P home page and on the router console. ===Eepsite=== Eepsites are [[website]]s that are hosted anonymously within the I2P network. Eepsite names end in ''.i2p'', such as ugha.i2p or forum.i2p. EepProxy can locate these sites through the cryptographic identifier keys stored in the hosts.txt file found within the I2P program directory. Typically, I2P is required to access these eepsites. ===EepProxy=== The EepProxy program handles all communication between the browser and any eepsite. It functions as a [[proxy server]] that can be used by any [[web browser]]. '''.i2p''' is a [[pseudo-top-level domain]] which is only valid within the I2P [[overlay network]] scope. <tt>.i2p</tt> names are resolved by browsers by submitting requests to EepProxy which will resolve names to an I2P peer key and will handle data transfers over the I2P network while remaining transparent to the browser.<ref>[http://www.i2p2.de/ i2p homepage]</ref> ===Peers=== Other machines using I2P that are connected to your machine within the network. Each machine within the network shares the routing and forwarding of encrypted packets. ===Tunnels=== Every ten minutes, a connection is established between your machine and another peer. Data to and from your machine, along with data for other users, passes through these tunnels, and are forwarded such that the packets eventually reach their final destination. ==See also== {{Portal|Free software}} * [[Anonymous P2P]] * [[Garlic routing]] * [[Crypto-anarchism]] * [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] &ndash; a similar anonymous communication system; a network of outproxies to the existing Internet * [[OneSwarm]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.i2p2.de/ Official I2P website] *{{it}} [http://i2p.netsons.org/ Unofficial Italian site] *[http://tjgidoycrw6s3guetge3kvrvynppqjmvqsosmtbmgqasa6vmsf6a.b32.i2p/ Official I2P-Bote eepsite (I2P-internal)] *[http://i2pbote.net I2P-Bote website access from the internet] *[http://azureus.sourceforge.net/doc/AnonBT/i2p/I2P_howto.htm How to use Azureus with I2P] *[http://ugha.i2p/ Ugha's wiki] (I2P is required to access this site) *[http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/getting-started-with-the-i2p-darknet Getting started with the I2P Darknet video tutorial] [[Category:Anonymity networks]] [[Category:Anonymous file sharing networks]] [[Category:Cross-platform software]] [[Category:Software using the MIT license]] [[de:I2P]] [[es:I2P]] [[fr:I2P]] [[it:I2P]] [[hu:I2P]] [[nl:I2P]] [[ja:I2P]] [[pl:I2P]] [[ru:I2P]] [[simple:I2P]] [[sv:I2P]] [[th:I2P]] [[zh:I2P]]</text> </page> <page> <id>17240</id> <title>IA-32 Execution Layer</title> <text>{{Infobox Software |name = IA-32 Execution Layer |logo = |screenshot = |caption = |collapsible = |author = [[Intel Corporation|Intel]] |developer = |released = <!-- {{Start date|YYYY|MM|DD}} --> |discontinued = |latest release version = 5336 / 5.3.81.31.21 |latest release date = <!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD}} --> |latest preview version = |latest preview date = <!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD}} --> |frequently updated = |programming language = |operating system = [[Linux]], [[Windows Server]] |platform = |size = |language = |status = |genre = [[Emulator]] |license = [[GNU Lesser General Public License|LGPL]], Proprietary |website = }} The '''IA-32 Execution Layer''' (IA-32 EL) is a software [[emulator]] in the form of a [[software driver]] that improves performance of [[32-bit]] applications running on [[64-bit]] [[Intel]] [[Itanium]]-based systems, particularly those running Linux and Windows Server 2003 (it is included in Windows 2003 SP1 and later<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/64bit/ipf/ia32el.mspx The IA-32 Execution Layer 4.3 Software Driver] (microsoft.com)</ref> and in most [[Linux distribution]]s for Itanium).
