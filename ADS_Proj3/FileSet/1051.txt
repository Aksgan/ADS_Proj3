On [[Microsoft Windows NT]] systems, programs called ''[[Windows service|services]]'' perform the functions of daemons. They run as processes, usually do not interact with the monitor, keyboard, and mouse, and may be launched by the operating system at boot time. With Windows 2000 and later versions, one can configure and manually start and stop Windows services using the [[Control Panel (Windows)|Control Panel]] → Administrative Tools or typing "Services.msc" in the Run command on [[Start menu]]. However, any Windows application can perform the role of a daemon, not just a service, and some daemons for Windows have the option of running as a normal process,, where it still has no visual output. ==Mac OS equivalent== On the original [[Mac OS]], optional features and services were provided by files loaded at startup time that patched the operating system; these were known as [[Extension (Mac OS)|system extensions]] and [[Control panel (Mac OS)|control panels]]. Later versions of classic Mac OS augmented these with fully-fledged [[Extension (Mac OS)#Faceless background applications|faceless background applications]]: regular applications that ran in the background. To the user, these were still described as regular system extensions. [[Mac OS X]], being a [[Unix]] system, has daemons. There is a category of software called ''[[Services menu#Mac OS X|services]]'' as well, but these are different in concept from Windows' services. ==Etymology== In the general sense, daemon is an older form of the word demon, from the Greek δαίμων. In the Unix System Administration Handbook, Evi Nemeth states the following about daemons:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebsd.org/copyright/daemon.html |title=The BSD Daemon |publisher=Freebsd.org |date= |accessdate=2008-11-15}}</ref> <blockquote> Many people equate the word "daemon" with the word "demon", implying some kind of [[satanism|satanic]] connection between UNIX and the [[underworld]]. This is an egregious misunderstanding. "Daemon"
