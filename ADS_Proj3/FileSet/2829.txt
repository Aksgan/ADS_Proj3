a [[triangle setup engine]] in microcode. G200 was Matrox's first graphics processor to require added cooling in the form of a [[heatsink]]. ==Performance== With regards to 2D, G200 was excellent in speed and delivered Matrox's renowned analog signal quality. The G200 bested the older Millennium II in almost every area except extremely high resolutions. With 3D, it scored similar to but generally behind a single Voodoo2 in [[Direct3D]], and was slower than [[Riva TNT|NVIDIA Riva TNT]] and [[Savage 3D|S3 Savage 3D]]. However, it was not far behind and was certainly competitive. <ref>[http://www.tomshardware.com/1998/08/18/new_3d_chips_/page4.html 3D Game Benchmark Results - Forsaken Mark - Tom's Hardware : New 3D Chips - Banshee, G200, RIVA TNT And Savage3D]- 1:01 PM - August 18, 1998 by Thomas Pabst / Source: Tom's Hardware US</ref><ref>[http://www.ixbt.com/video/matroxg200.html iXBT: Matrox G200 - First PreView]</ref> G200's 3D image quality was considered one of the best due to its support of 32-bit color depth (assuming driver bugs weren't an issue). G200's biggest problem was its [[OpenGL]] support. Throughout most of its life G200 had to get by, in popular games such as [[Quake II]], with a slow Direct3D-to-OpenGL wrapper driver. This was a layer that translated OpenGL to run on the Direct3D driver. This hurt G200's performance dramatically in these games and caused a lot of controversy over continuing delays and promises from Matrox. <ref>[http://www.hwupgrade.com/skvideo/icd_driver_g200.html Hardware Upgrade]- icd driver g200</ref> In fact, it would not be until well into the life of G200's successor, [[Matrox G400|G400]], that the OpenGL driver would finally be mature and fast. Early drivers had some issues with Direct3D as well. In [[Unreal]], for example, there were problems with distortions on the ground textures caused by a bug with the board's [[subpixel accuracy]] function. There were also some issues with mip-mapping causing flickering in textures. As drivers matured these problems disappeared. ==G200A & G250== Around 1999, Matrox introduced a newer version of G200, called G200A. This board used a newer 250 nm manufacturing process instead of G200's original 350 nm. This allowed Matrox to build more graphics processors per wafer at the factory as well as to reduce heat output of the chip, and the G200As came without even a heatsink. Some G200A boards were named G250, which were clocked slightly higher than the normal G200, and sold only to OEMs, with [[Hewlett Packard]] perhaps being the only buyer. <ref>[http://forums.murc.ws/showthread.php?t=21045&highlight=g250 G200 core - MURC] - 5th July 2000, 13:22</ref><ref>[http://forums.murc.ws/showthread.php?t=21280&highlight=g250 G250? - MURC]-11th August 2000</ref> ==Models== {| border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="2" |- style="background:#ccccff;" !

Cards they produced were excellent [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] accelerators, and the company's Millennium card, released in 1995, excelled at [[MS-DOS]] performance as well. With regard to [[3D computer graphics|3D acceleration]], Matrox stepped forward in 1994 with their ''Impression Plus''. However, that card only could accelerate a very limited feature set, and was primarily targeted at [[computer aided design|CAD]] applications. The Impression could not perform hardware [[texture mapping]], for example, requiring [[Gouraud shading]] or lower-quality techniques. Very few games took advantage of the 3D capabilities of Impression Plus, with the only known games being the three titles that were bundled with the card in its '3D Superpack'<ref>Byte Dec 1994[http://www.byte.com/art/9412/sec4/art8.htm]</ref> CD bundle: 3D [[fighting game]], ''Sento'' by 47 Tek; 3D space combat game, ''IceHawk'' by Amorphous Designs, and Specter MGA (aka ''Specter VR'') by Velocity. The newer Millennium card also contained 3D capabilities similar to the Impression Plus, and was nearly as limited. Without support for
