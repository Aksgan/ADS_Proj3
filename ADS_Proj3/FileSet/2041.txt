weapon of war, and a roadmap for group destruction.... Hitler and his hatred of the Jews was the ironic driving force behind this intellectual turning point. But his quest was greatly enhanced and energized by the ingenuity and craving for profit of a single American company and its legendary, autocratic chairman. That company was International Business machines, and its chairman was Thomas J. Watson."<ref>Edwin Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust: The Strategic Alliance between Nazi Germany and America's Most Powerful Corporation.'' Second paperback edition. Washington, DC: Dialog Press, 2009; pg. 7.</ref></blockquote> === Origins of IBM === Black begins his study with the origins of IBM. In the early 1880s, [[Herman Hollerith]] (1860-1929), a young employee at the [[United States Bureau of the Census|U.S. Census Bureau]], conceived of the idea of creating readable cards with standardized perforations, each representing specific individual traits such as gender, nationality, and occupation. The millions of cards created for each individual counted in the national census could then be sorted and resorted on the basis of specific bits of information they contained — thereby providing a quantified portrait of the nation.<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 25.</ref> Hollerith built a [[prototype]] of his counting machine in 1884 and later won a contest for the best automated counting device conducted by the Census Bureau in conjunction with its 1890 census.<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 26.</ref> The Census Bureau saved $5 million through use of Hollerith counting machines — about one-third of its annual budget — and Hollerith and his [[patent|patented]] invention gained international renown and customers around the world.<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pp. 26-27.</ref> By the turn of the 20th Century, Hollerith and his Tabulating Machine Company had achieved near-[[monopoly]] status. A rival arose in the next decade, however, and the U.S. Census Bureau abandoned its use of the more costly and slower Hollerith machines for its 1910 census. A disconsolate Hollerith licensed out his patents abroad. In 1910, the [[Germany|German]] licensee Willy Heidinger established the Deutsche Hollerith Maschinen Gesellschaft (German Hollerith Machine Corporation), commonly known by the [[acronym]] "[[Dehomag]]."<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 30.</ref> The next year, Hollerith sold his American business to [[industrialist]] [[Charles Ranlett Flint|Charles Flint]] (1850-1934) for $1.41 million.<ref name="Black31">Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 31.</ref> The counting machine operation was made part of a new [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] called the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR).<ref name="Black31" /> To head this massive new enterprise, Flint chose [[Thomas J. Watson]] (1874-1956), the star salesman of the [[NCR Corporation|National Cash Register Corporation]]. Watson was initially paid $25,000 per year — a substantial salary in the day — plus 1200 shares of stock and a commission of 5% of CTR's after-tax, after-dividends profits.<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pp. 38-39.</ref> The German [[hyperinflation]] of 1922-1923 made it impossible for Dehomag, the German licensee of CTR's technology, to make its scheduled [[royalties|royalty payments]] to America, with its balance in arrears topping the $100,000 mark.<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 43.</ref> Threatened with bankruptcy and complete loss of his investment, Dehomag chief Willy Heidinger agreed to transfer 90% of the stock in his company to Watson's CTR as a means of settling his debt.<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pp. 43-44.</ref> The German licensee Dehomag thus became a direct [[subsidiary]] of the American corporation CTR.<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 44.</ref> In 1924, following the death or departure of several key figures in the company, Watson assumed the role of [[Chief Executive Officer]] of CTR and renamed the now-focused company International Business Machines (IBM). === IBM business relations with the Nazi regime === The bulk of Black's book details the ongoing business relationship between Watson's IBM and the emerging German regime headed by [[Adolf Hitler]] and his [[Nazi party|National Socialist German Workers Party]] (NSDAP). Hitler came to power in January 1933; on March 20 of that same year he established a [[concentration camp]] for [[political prisoner]]s in the [[Bavaria]]n town of [[Dachau]], just outside the city of [[Munich, Germany|Munich]]. Repression against political opponents and the country's substantial ethnic Jewish population began at once. By April 1933, some 60,000 had been imprisoned.<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pp. 44-45.</ref> Despite the violent and repressive climate emerging in the new ultra-[[nationalism|nationalist]] Germany, business relations between IBM and the Hitler regime continued uninterrupted in the face of broad international calls for an economic boycott.<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 45.</ref> Indeed, Willy Heidinger, who remained in control of Dehomag, the 90%-owned German subsidiary of IBM, was an enthusiastic supporter of the Hitler regime.<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 50.</ref> On April 12, 1933, the German government announced the plans to immediately conduct a long-delayed national census.<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 54.</ref> The project was particularly important to the Nazis as a mechanism for the identification of Jews, [[Romani people|Gypsies]], and other [[ethnic group]]s deemed undesirable by the regime. Dehomag offered to actively assist the German government in its task of ethnic identification, concentrating first upon the 41 million residents of [[Prussia]].<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 55.</ref> This activity was not only countenanced by Thomas Watson and IBM in America, Black argues, but was actively encouraged and financially supported, with Watson himself traveling to Germany in October 1933 and the company ramping up its investment in its German subsidiary from 400,000 to 7,000,000 [[Reichsmark|reichsmarks]] — about $1 million.<ref name="Black60">Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 60.</ref> This injection of American capital allowed Dehomag to purchase land in [[Berlin]] and to construct IBM's first factory in Germany, Black charges, thereby "tooling up for what it correctly saw as a massive financial relationship with the Hitler regime."<ref name="Black60" /> Black also asserts that a "secret deal" was made between Heidinger and Watson during the latter's visit to Germany which allowed Dehomag commercial
