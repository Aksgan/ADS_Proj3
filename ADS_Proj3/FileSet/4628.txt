Scripting is built on [[Mono (software)|Mono]], the open source implementation of the [[.NET Framework]]. Programmers can use UnityScript (a custom language with [[JavaScript]]-inspired syntax), [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] or [[Boo programming language|Boo]] (which has a [[Python (programming language)|Python]]-inspired syntax). * The Unity Asset Server - A version control solution for all game assets and scripts, using PostgreSql as a backend. * Audio system built on [[FMOD]] library, with ability to play back [[Ogg Vorbis]] compressed audio. * Video playback using [[Theora]] codec <ref>{{cite web | url=http://unity3d.com/unity/features/audio-and-video | title=Features: Audio and Video| publisher=Unity Technologies}}</ref>. * A terrain and vegetation engine <ref>{{cite web | url=http://unity3d.com/unity/features/terrains | title=Features: Terrains| publisher=Unity Technologies}}</ref>, supporting tree billboarding. * Occlusion Culling with [[Umbra Software|Umbra]] (only in Unity 3). * Built-in [[Lightmap]]ping and [[Global illumination]] with [[Beast (software)|Beast]] (only in Unity 3). * Multiplayer networking using [[Raknet]]. ==Unity Asset Server== The Unity Asset Server is a [[revision control|version control]] solution for all game assets and scripts <ref name=asset-server>{{cite web | url=http://unity3d.com/unity/features/unity-asset-server| title=Features: Unity Asset Server | publisher=Unity Technologies}}</ref>. The asset server supports multi-gigabyte projects with thousands of multi-megabyte files. Import settings and other metadata are stored and versioned while updates, commits, and graphical version comparisons are all performed inside the Unity Editor. When files are modified, their status is updated instantly. The Unity Asset Server runs on the open source [[PostgreSQL]] database server and is available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. It lacks support for branches, and obviously for branch merges. Asset server has an extra cost of $499 per copy of Unity, and requires the user to have a Unity Pro License. ==Licensing== There are two main licenses: ''Unity'' and ''Unity Pro'' <ref name=licensing>{{cite web | url=http://unity3d.com/unity/licenses| title=Unity License Comparison | publisher=Unity Technologies}}</ref>, with the Pro version being available for a price and the non Pro version being free. The ''Pro'' version has additional features, like render-to-texture and post-processing effects. The Free version, on the other hand, displays a splash screen (in standalone games) and a watermark (in web games). Both Unity and Unity Pro include the development environment, tutorials, sample projects and content, support via forum, wiki, and future updates in the same major version (i.e. buying Unity Pro 3.0 gets all future Unity Pro 3.x updates for free). Unity for iPhone and Unity for Android are add-ons to existing Unity purchase.<ref name=iPhone /> Source code, educational and console ([[Xbox 360]], [[Playstation 3]], and [[Wii]]) licenses are negotiated on a case by case basis. ==See also== * [[Game engine]] * [[List of game engines]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== *{{official website|http://www.unity3d.com/}} *[http://foros.unity-rf.info Unofficial spanish community for Unity 3D] {{Unity engine games}} {{iPhone video game engines}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Unity (Game Engine)}} [[Category:Video game engines]] [[Category:IPhone video game engines]] [[Category:.NET game engines]] [[Category:Mac OS X software]] [[Category:Mono project applications]] [[Category:Unity engine games| ]] [[fr:Unity (moteur de jeu)]] [[ko:유니티 (게임 엔진)]] [[pt:Unity]] [[ru:Unity (игровой движок)]] [[zh:Unity (游戏引擎)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>38895</id> <title>Universal Converter (Unit Conversion Software)</title> <text>{{Infobox software | name = Universal Converter | logo = [[File:Universal-Converter-Logo.png|200px ]] | screenshot = [[File:Universal-Converter-Screenshot.jpg |200px]] | caption = Universal Converter - Main Screen | developer = Anthony Daly<ref>[http://www.softpedia.com/developer/Anthony-Daly-63291.html Anthony Daly - Softpedia]</ref> | latest release version = 2.2 | latest release date = {{release date|2010|12|01}} | programming language = [[Visual Basic]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] | operating system = [[Microsoft Windows]] | genre = [[Conversion of units|Unit Conversion]] | license = Proprietary | website = [http://www.universalconverter.net Universal Converter Homepage] }} '''Universal Converter''' is a proprietary [[Conversion of units|unit conversion]] [[Computer software|software]] product<ref>[http://download.cnet.com/Universal-Converter/3000-2053_4-75000094.html?tag=contentMain;contentBody Universal Converter 2.1.7]</ref> which converts units across many different categories, some of which include [[acceleration]], [[speed]], [[weight]], [[length]], [[currency]], [[angles]], [[frequency]], [[temperature]], [[Fuel consumption in automobiles|fuel consumption]], [[shoe size]] and [[Roman numerals]].

They work by converting units from one data type to another that the user has selected. Once the user has selected the conversion categories and input the data to convert, unit converters perform the underlying task of multiplying the data entered (assuming that it is a numerical value) by the [[conversion factor]] to calculate the result. Universal Converter offers automatic reporting, and allows users to format the result with [[Decimal separator|thousand separators]] or in [[Scientific notation|scientific notation]].<ref>[http://www.softsea.com/review/Universal-Converter.html SoftSea - Universal Converter]</ref> Also, Universal Converter has extensive customisation options, including the ability to change application themes and modify how it shows the result by default.<ref>[http://www.softpedia.com/get/Others/Unit-Conversion/Anthony-Universal-Converter.shtml| Universal Converter 2.1.7 Info]</ref> Users can also download new additions to the program such as extra conversions and plugins from 'UC Online'<ref>[http://online.universalconverter.net/ UC Online]</ref>, a subsection of the Universal Converter website. == See also == * [[Conversion of units|Unit Conversion]] == References == {{Reflist}} == External links == * {{official|http://www.universalconverter.net/}} {{Windows-software-stub}} {{software-type-stub}} [[Category:Proprietary software]] [[Category:Windows-only software]] [[Category:Units of measure| ]] [[Category:Metrication]]</text> </page> <page> <id>38902</id> <title>Universal Handy Interface</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=June 2007}} '''Universal Handy Interface''' (UHI) is a [[Motorola]] designed universal interface for mobile phone use (Motorola, [[Nokia]], [[Siemens AG]], [[Sony Ericsson]], [[Samsung]]) in [[Mercedes-Benz]] cars.
