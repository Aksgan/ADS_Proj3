It is stated as follows: Find the [[Hamiltonian path|Hamiltonian cycle]] in a [[Glossary of graph theory|weighted graph]] which minimizes the weight of the most weighty [[Glossary of graph theory|edge]] of the cycle.<ref name=gj>{{cite book|author = [[Michael R. Garey]] and [[David S. Johnson]] | year = 1979 | title = [[Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness]] | publisher = W.H. Freeman | isbn = 0-7167-1045-5}} A2.3: ND24, pg.212.</ref> The problem is known to be [[NP-hard]]. The [[decision problem]] version of this, "for a given length ''x'', is there a Hamiltonian cycle in a graph ''g'' with no edge longer than ''x''?", is [[NP-complete]].<ref name=gj/> In an '''asymmetric bottleneck TSP''', there are cases where the weight from node ''A'' to ''B'' is different from the weight from B to A (e. g. travel time between two cities with a traffic jam in one direction). '''Euclidean bottleneck TSP''', or planar bottleneck TSP, is the bottleneck TSP with the distance being the ordinary [[Euclidean distance]]. The problem still remains NP-hard, however many heuristics work better. If the graph is a [[metric space]] then there is an efficient [[approximation algorithm]] that finds a Hamiltonian cycle with maximum edge weight being no more than twice the optimum.<ref>{{cite journal|author = R.

There are many variants of the name, none of them used universally, including '''return path''', '''reverse path''', '''envelope from''', '''envelope sender''', '''MAIL FROM''', '''2821-FROM''', '''return address''', '''From_''', '''Errors-to''', etc. It is not uncommon for a single document to use several of these names. All of these names refer to the e-mail address found by the <tt>MAIL FROM</tt> command. ==Background information== Ordinarily, the bounce address is not seen by e-mail users and, without standardization of the name, it may cause confusion. An e-mail message can be thought of as resembling a [[Letter (message)|letter]] in an envelope. It will contain "header fields", such as <tt>To:</tt>, <tt>From:</tt>, and <tt>Subject:</tt>, along with the body of the message. These are analogous to the letterhead and body of a letter. The "to" and "from" information is usually copied to the envelope, and used to deliver the message. While it is most common for the To and From information in the letter to be the same as on the envelope, such is not always the case. For example, on [[electronic mailing list]]s, the information seen in the "From:" header will come from the person who sent the e-mail to the list, while the bounce address will be set to that of the mailing list software, so problems delivering the mailing list messages can be handled correctly. When e-mail is transported using the [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] (SMTP), the most common method on the internet, only the envelope information is looked at to figure out where the e-mail should go; the body
