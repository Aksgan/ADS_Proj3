coincided with the marked scale on the other disc. To aid clarity, markings on the second disc were in a different colour to those on the first. The rear of the device had a separate rotating calculator, where if the ships speed was set against the 60-minute guide mark, then the distance travelled in any time 0â€“60 minutes could be read off against the logarithmic time scale.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/explore/object.cfm?ID=ZBA0091&picture=2 |publisher=National Maritime Museum |title=Battenberg's course indicator Mark V|accessdate=2008-11-07}}</ref> == References == {{reflist}} * [http://www.gwpda.org/naval/ou5274.htm GWPDA ] Reproduction of 1934 Royal Navy notes on the Mark IV Battenberg Course Indicator *[http://www.library.unsw.edu.au/~thesis/adt-ADFA/uploads/approved/adt-ADFA20070815.101340/public/02chapter1.pdf aircraft navigation 1914-1937] [[Category:Mechanical computers]] [[Category:Analog computers]] [[Category:Military computers]]</text> </page> <page> <id>3455</id> <title>Battery eliminator</title> <text>{{Unreferenced stub|auto=yes|date=December 2009}} A '''battery eliminator''' is a device powered by an electrical source ''other'' than a [[battery (electricity)|battery]], which then converts the source to a suitable [[direct current|DC]] [[voltage]] that may be used by a second device designed to be powered by batteries. A battery eliminator eliminates the need to replace batteries but may remove the advantage of portability. A battery eliminator is also effective in replacing obsolete battery designs. Some examples of battery eliminators: * 9v mains [[power supply]], size and shape of a PP9 battery, intended to replace the battery in portable radios. 1960s * [[Solar panel]] providing power for a portable appliance ==History== Early commercial battery eliminators were produced by [[Edward S. Rogers, Sr.]] company in 1925, as a complement to his line of "batteryless" [[receiver (radio)|radio receiver]]s. Another early producer of battery eliminators was the Galvin Manufacturing Corporation (later known as [[Motorola]]) which was opened on September 25, 1928 by [[Paul Galvin]] and his brother Joseph E. Galvin, to build battery eliminators for radio receivers installed in automobiles. While it might seem surprising to use such a device in a car to power a radio, the first [[Car audio|car radio]] receivers were based on [[vacuum tube]] technology which required two or three different voltages to function: * LT, typically 4 or 6.3 volts at high current to power the filaments * HT, typically 100 to 300 volts at low current to power the [[anode]] circuitry * Additional voltages were sometimes also required for [[grid bias]]. Batteries designed for these portable vacuum tube receivers were a combination of several different battery types and sizes, combined in a single package and intended to slowly wear out at about the same rate. The battery typically connected to the radio via a specially shaped four- or five-pin connector, keyed so that the plug must be inserted correctly. A battery eliminator would take the typical 6-volt or 12-volt DC power from a car battery and transform it into the required LT and HT needed to power the vacuum tubes in a car radio. Without a battery eliminator, it was necessary to occasionally replace the [[battery pack]] in the vacuum-tube car radio. ==Principle of working== Although a battery eliminator works without a battery, it has to be charged by some device, preferably a battery. The battery eliminator can also be used to charge the rechargeable automobile batteries. The cathode of a battery is attached to anode of the eliminator & battery anode to the eliminator cathode, in case of battery charging. In case of providing the eliminator with energy, battery anode is connected to eliminator anode & battery cathode to eliminator cathode. This charges the eliminator, which can be used in place of the battery to power some external device. The connections are same as that in case of a battery. ==See also== *[[Batteryless radio]] *[[Batteryless switch]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Battery Eliminator}} [[Category:Power supplies]] [[Category:Electrical power conversion]] [[Category:Power electronics]] {{Electronics-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>3473</id> <title>Bayes linear statistics</title> <text>'''Bayes linear statistics''' is a subjectivist statistical methodology and framework. Traditional subjective Bayesian analysis is based upon fully specified probability distributions, which are very difficult to specify at the necessary level of detail. Bayes linear analysis attempts to solve this problem by developing theory and practise for using partially specified probability models. Bayes linear in its current form has been primarily developed by Michael Goldstein. Mathematically and philosophically it extends [[Bruno de Finetti]]'s [[Operational Subjective]] approach to probability and statistics. Consider first a traditional Bayesian Analysis where you expect to shortly know ''D'' and you would like to know more about some other observable ''B''. In the traditional Bayesian approach it is required that every possible outcome is enumerated i.e. every possible outcome is the cross product of the [[partition of a set]] of ''B'' and ''D''. If represented on a computer where ''B'' requires ''n'' bits and ''D'' ''m'' bits then the number of states required is ''2<sup>n+m</sup>''. The first step to such an analysis is to determine a persons subjective probabilities e.g. by asking about their betting behaviour for each of these outcomes. When we learn ''D'' conditional probabilities for ''B'' are determined by the application of Bayes' rule. Practitioners of subjective Bayesian statistics routinely analyse datasets where the size of this set is large enough that subjective probabilities cannot be meaningfully determined for every element of ''D &times; B''. This is normally accomplished by assuming [[exchangeability]] and then the use of parameterized models with prior distributions over parameters and appealing to the [[de Finetti's theorem]] to justify that this produces valid operational subjective probabilities over ''D &times; B''. The difficulty with such an approach is that the validity of the statistical analysis requires that the subjective probabilities are a good representation of an individual's beliefs however this method results in a very precise specification over ''D &times; B'' and it is often difficult to articulate what it would mean to adopt these belief specifications. In contrast to the traditional Bayesian paradigm Bayes linear statistics following de Finetti uses [[Prevision]] or subjective expectation as a primitive, probability is then defined as the expectation of an indicator variable. Instead of specifying a subjective probability for every element in the partition ''D &times; B'' the analyst specifies subjective expectations for just a few quantities that they are interested in or feel knowledgeable about.
