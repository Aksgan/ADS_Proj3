(''sasana'')—learning or practice? A clear difference of opinion resulted in the development of two groups: the ''Dhammakathika''s, who claimed that learning was the basis of the Sasana, and the ''Pamsukulikas'', who argued for practice as the basis. The Dhammakathikas apparently won out.</blockquote> <blockquote>The two vocations described above came to be known as ''gantha-dhura'', or the “vocation of books,” and ''vipassana-dhura'', or the “vocation of meditation,” with the former regarded as the superior training (because surely meditation would not be possible if the teachings were lost). Moreover, the vipassana-dhura monks began to live in the forest, where they could best pursue their vocation undisturbed, while the gantha-dhura monks began to dwell in villages and towns. As such, the gantha-dhura monks began to play a significant role in Buddhist education.</blockquote> <blockquote>It would probably not be going too far to refer to the gantha-dhura monks as “scholar-monks.” Why is this distinction so important? It is significant because the scholar-monks were responsible for the education of the laity and cultivated a Buddhist literacy among the ordinary practitioners of the tradition. While this was a normative practice in the ancient Buddhist tradition, Buddhism in the Western world has not favored a monastic lifestyle. As such, the education of the laity has been left to teachers who are no longer trained as scholar-monks. In fact, while many of the leaders and authorized teachers in the various Western Buddhist groups have had formal monastic and scholarly training at some point, many—if not most—have abandoned the monastic and scholarly lifestyle altogether. This has fostered a “scholarship gap,” which to a large extent is being rapidly filled by scholar-practitioners who, although not living as full-fledged monastics, have solid scholarly and academic training grounded in a rigorous personal practice.<ref>"The New Panditas" by Charles Prebish.

The former (and older) was led by [[T. W. Rhys Davids]] and [[Hermann Oldenberg]], while the latter included primarily [[Louis de La Vallée Poussin]], [[Jean Przyluski]], [[Sylvain Lévi]], [[Paul Demiéville]], and [[Étienne Lamotte]]. To these schools, [[Edward Conze]], quite reasonably, adds a third: the [[Leningrad]] school, including [[Fyodor Shcherbatskoy|Stcherbatsky]], [[Otto Rosenberg|Rosenberg]], and [[Eugène Obermiller|Obermiller]]. The Anglo-German school almost exclusively emphasized the [[Pali]] literary tradition, while the Franco-Belgian school utilized the [[Sanskrit]]ic materials, along with their corresponding translations and commentaries in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Tibetan language|Tibetan]]. The Leningrad school is clearly closer to the Franco-Belgian school than the Anglo-German. These are general classifications, but they nonetheless capture the style of the traditions as they have been maintained over the last century.<ref>Prebish, p. 185.</ref> Prebish goes on to discuss developments in the USA: :Although some might consider [[Eugène Burnouf]] the founding father of Buddhist Studies as a discipline, the beginnings of Buddhist Studies in the United States seem inextricably bound to three primary individuals: [[Paul Carus]], [[Henry Clarke Warren]], and [[Charles Rockwell Lanman]]. [...] Despite the work of these early educators, it was not until after 1960 that Buddhist Studies began to emerge as a significant discipline in the American university system and publishing industry. During the [[Vietnam War]] years and immediately thereafter, Buddhist Studies was to enjoy a boom, largely through the efforts of such leading professors as [[Richard Hugh Robinson]] of the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], [[Masatoshi Nagatomi]] of [[Harvard University]], and [[Alex Wayman]] of [[Columbia University]]. No doubt there were many reasons for the increased development of Buddhist Studies, not the least of which were the increase in [[area studies]] programs in American universities; growing government interest in things Asian; the immense social anomie that permeated American culture in the 1960's; and the growing dissatisfation with (and perhaps rejection of) traditional religion.<ref>Prebish, pp. 185-187.</ref> Donald Lopez emphasizes the influence of Geshe [[Lhundup Sopa]] at Wisconsin, and [[Jeffrey Hopkins]] at Virginia.<ref>''Prisoners of Shangri-La,'' p. tk</ref> ==University programs and institutes== According to Prebish, Buddhist studies in the United States prior to 1975 was dominated by the University of Wisconsin, Harvard University and the University of Chicago.<ref>"The New Panditas" by Charles Prebish.

Spring 2006<sup>[http://www.thebuddhadharma.com/issues/2006/spring/scholar-practitioners.html</sup>]</ref> Prebish cites two surveys by Hart in which the following university programs were found to have produced the most scholars with U.S. university posts: Chicago, Wisconsin, Harvard, Columbia, Yale, Virginia, Stanford, Berkeley, Princeton, Temple, Northwestern, Michigan, Washington, and Tokyo.<ref>Prebish, p. 194.</ref> Other regionally-accredited U.S. institutions with programs in Buddhism include the [[University of the West]], [[Institute of Buddhist Studies]], [[Naropa University]], and the [[California Institute of Integral Studies]]. (A number of dharma centers offer semi-academic, unaccredited study; some of these seem likely eventually to win accreditation.) Prominent European programs include Oxford and Cambridge, [[SOAS]], the universities of Humbolt and Bonn, and the Sorbonne. In Asia, Tokyo University has long been a major center for Buddhist research. ==Professional associations== {{Empty section|date=July 2010}} ==Publications== Journals specializing in Buddhist Studies (in alphabetical order): :*''[http://www.equinoxjournals.com/ojs/index.php/BSR Buddhist Studies Review]'' :*''[http://www.chibs.edu.tw/publication/c_pub_frm.htm Chung-Hwa Buddhist Journal]'' :*''[http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/14639947.html Contemporary Buddhism]'' :*''[http://web.otani.ac.jp/EBS/about_journal.html The Eastern Buddhist]'' :*''[http://www.buddhistethics.org/ Journal of Buddhist Ethics]'' :*''[http://www.globalbuddhism.org/ Journal of Global Buddhism]'' :*'' Journal of Indian and Buddhist Studies / Indogaku Bunkkyogaku Kenkyu (No website yet!)'' :*''[http://www.iabsinfo.net/jiabs.htm Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies]'' :*''[http://www.shin-ibs.edu/academics/_pwj/ Pacific World: Journal of the Institute of Buddhist Studies]'' :*''[http://iasbs.net/english/publications_e.html The Pure Land: Journal of the International Association of Shin Buddhist Studies]'' In addition, many scholars publish in journals devoted to area studies (such as Japan, China, etc.), general Religious Studies, or disciplines such as history, anthropology, or language studies.
