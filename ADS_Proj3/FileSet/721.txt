The name "Classic" is also sometimes used by software vendors to refer to the [[application programming interface]] available to "classic" applications, to differentiate between programming for Mac OS X and the previous version of the Mac OS. Classic is supported on [[PowerPC]]-based Macs running versions of Mac OS X up to [[Mac OS X v10.4|v10.4 Tiger]], but is not supported on [[Mac OS X v10.5|v10.5 Leopard]] and later, nor on Intel-based Macs running any version of Mac OS X. ==Overview== Classic was a descendant of [[Rhapsody (operating system)|Rhapsody]]'s '''"Blue Box"''' emulation layer, which served as a [[proof of concept]]. It uses a Mac OS 9 [[System Folder (Mac OS)|System Folder]], and a [[New World ROM]] file to bridge the differences between the older PowerPC Macintosh [[Platform (computing)|platforms]] and the [[XNU]] [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] environment. Classic was a key element of Apple's strategy to replace the "classic" Mac OS (versions 9 and below) with Mac OS X as the standard operating system (OS) used by [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] computers by eliminating the need to use the older OS directly. Classic Environment can be loaded at [[Logging (computer security)|login]] (for faster activation when needed later), on command, or whenever a Mac OS application that requires it is launched (to reduce the use of system resources when not needed). It requires a full version of [[Mac OS 9]] to be installed on the system, and loads an instance of that OS in a [[sandbox (security)|sandbox]] environment, replacing some low-level [[system call]]s with equivalent calls to Mac OS X via updated system files and the Classic Support system enabler. This sandbox is used to launch all "classic" Mac OS applications—there is only one instance of the Classic [[Process (computing)|process]] running for a given user, and only one user per machine may be running Classic at a time. If the "load-when-needed" option is selected, [[Double-click (computing)|double clicking]] a "classic" application first launches Classic, which can be configured to appear in a [[Window (computer user interface)|window]] resembling the display of a computer booting into Mac OS 9. When Classic is finished loading, the application launches. When a "classic" application is in the foreground, the [[menu bar]] at the top of the screen changes to look like the older Mac OS system menu. [[Dialog box]]es and other user-interface elements retain their traditional appearance. ==Compatibility and performance== [[File:JPEGView version 3.3.1 running on Mac OS X Classic Environment.png|thumb|right|[[JPEGView]] running in the Classic Environment]] The Classic Environment provides a way to run "Classic" applications on Apple's [[PowerPC G5|G5]] systems as well as on most G4 based computers sold after September 2002. These machines cannot boot [[Mac OS 9]] or earlier without the bridging capabilities of Classic or other software (see Sheepshaver link). Classic is not supported on versions of Mac OS X that run on Apple systems incorporating [[Apple–Intel transition|Intel microprocessors]], which includes all new shipping Apple computers, as of September 2006.<ref>{{cite news|first=Ina|last=Fried|coauthors=John Borland|publisher=[[CNET|News.com]]|date=January 10, 2006|url=http://news.com.com/2100-7354_3-6025409.html|title=Jobs: New Intel Macs are "screamers"}}</ref> The last version of Mac OS to support Classic on PowerPCs was [[Mac OS X v10.4]] "Tiger". Classic's compatibility is good, provided the application using it does not require direct access to hardware or engage in full-screen drawing. However, it is not a perfect clone of a Mac OS 9 computer. The Finder included with [[Mac OS X v10.2]] and later does not support the "Reveal Object" [[Apple events|Apple event]] used by Mac OS 9 applications, causing the "Reveal In Finder" functionality for those applications to be lost. Early releases of Mac OS X 10.2 would often fail to draw window frames of Classic applications correctly, and after Classic windowing was made [[Multiple buffering|double buffered]] in [[Mac OS X v10.3]], some older applications and games sometimes failed to update the screen properly, such as the original Macintosh port of ''[[Doom (video game)|Doom]]''. Additionally (somewhat to the surprise of end-users) Classic resurrected some older applications that had previously been unusable on the [[Macintosh Quadra]] and [[Power Macintosh]] series; this is because Mac OS X replaced Mac OS 9's [[virtual memory]] system with a more standard and less fragile implementation, and eliminated the [[Motorola 68040]]'s split cache system.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Classic's [[Benchmark (computing)|performance]] is also generally acceptable, with a few exceptions. Most of an application is run directly as [[PowerPC]] [[Machine language|code]] (which would not be possible on Intel-based Macs). [[Motorola]] [[68k]] code is handled by the same [[Mac 68K emulator|Motorola 68LC040 emulator]] that Mac OS 9 uses. Some application functions are actually faster in Classic than under Mac OS 9 on equivalent hardware, due to performance improvements in the newer operating system's [[device driver]]s. These applications are largely those that use heavy disk processing, and were often quickly [[porting|ported]] to Mac OS X by their developers. On the other hand, applications that rely on heavy processing and which did not share resources under Mac OS 9's [[co-operative multitasking]] model will be interrupted by other (non-Classic) processes under Mac OS X's [[preemptive multitasking]]. The greater processing power of most systems that run Mac OS X (compared to systems intended to run [[Mac OS 8]] or 9) helps to mitigate the performance degradation of Classic's emulation. ==Bugs== A group of [[Mac OS X v10.0]] systems (v.10.3.2, etc.) fail to boot [[Mac OS 9]] under Classic. While Mac OS 9 is loading, an "unimplemented trap" [[Bomb (symbol)|bomb error]] shows over Mac OS 9's loading screen. ==See also== *Apple's [[Macintosh Application Environment]] *Apple's [[Rosetta (binary translation software)]] – PowerPC emulator *[[SheepShaver]] – PowerPC emulator *[[Basilisk II]] – 680x0 emulator *[[vMac]] – 68000 emulator ==References== <references/> {{Mac OS X}} {{Apple Inc.}} [[Category:Mac OS
