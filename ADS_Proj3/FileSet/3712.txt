Adaptive Integration'', [http://www.bfrl.nist.gov/IAQanalysis/docs/NISTIR-6925.pdf NIST Report NISTIR-6925], see also http://view3d.sourceforge.net/</ref> == Reducing computation time == Although in its basic form radiosity is assumed to have a quadratic increase in computation time with added geometry (surfaces and patches), this need not be the case. The radiosity problem can be rephrased as a problem of rendering a [[Texture mapping|texture mapped]] scene. In this case, the computation time increases only linearly with the number of patches (ignoring complex issues like [[cache]] use). Using a [[Binary space partitioning|binary space partitioning tree]] can massively reduce the amount of time spent determining which patches are completely hidden from others in complex scenes. Following the commercial enthusiasm for radiosity-enhanced imagery, but prior to the standardization of rapid radiosity calculation, many architects and graphic artists used a technique referred to loosely as [[false radiosity]]. By darkening areas of texture maps corresponding to corners, joints and recesses, and applying them via self-illumination or diffuse mapping, a radiosity-like effect of patch interaction could be created with a standard scanline renderer (cf. [[ambient occlusion]]). Since radiosity can now be computed more effectively using texture mapping algorithms, it lends itself to acceleration using standard [[Graphics accelerator|graphics acceleration hardware]], widely available for all types of computers. == Advantages == [[Image:Utah teapot simple 2.png|thumb|A modern render of the iconic [[Utah teapot]]. '''Radiosity''' was used for all diffuse illumination in this scene.]] One of the advantages of the Radiosity algorithm is that it is relatively simple to explain and implement. This makes it a useful algorithm for teaching students about global illumination algorithms. A typical direct illumination renderer already contains nearly all of the algorithms ([[perspective transform]]ations, [[texture mapping]], [[hidden surface removal]]) required to implement radiosity. A strong grasp of mathematics is not required to understand or implement this algorithm. == Limitations == Typical radiosity methods only account for light paths of the form LD*E, i.e., paths which start at a light source and make multiple diffuse bounces before reaching the eye. Although there are several approaches to integrating other illumination effects such as [[Specular reflection|specular]][http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=37438&coll=portal&dl=ACM] and glossy [http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/labs/cglab/papers/clustering/] reflections, radiosity-based methods are generally not used to solve the complete rendering equation. Basic radiosity also has trouble resolving sudden changes in visibility (e.g., hard-edged shadows) because coarse, regular discretization into piecewise constant elements corresponds to a [[low-pass filter|low-pass box filter]] of the spatial domain. Discontinuity meshing [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ph/discon.ps.gz] uses knowledge of visibility events to generate a more intelligent discretization. == Confusion about terminology == Radiosity was perhaps the first rendering algorithm in widespread use which accounted for diffuse indirect lighting. Earlier rendering algorithms, such as Whitted-style [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] were capable of computing effects such as reflections, refractions, and shadows, but despite being highly global phenomena, these effects were not commonly referred to as "global illumination." As a consequence, the term "global illumination" became confused with "diffuse interreflection," and "Radiosity" became confused with "global illumination" in popular [[parlance]]. However, the three are distinct concepts. The radiosity method in the current computer graphics context derives from (and is fundamentally the same as) the radiosity method in [[heat transfer]]. In this context [[Radiosity (heat transfer)|radiosity]] is the total radiative flux (both reflected and re-radiated) leaving a surface, also sometimes known as [[radiant exitance]]. Calculation of Radiosity rather than surface temperatures is a key aspect of the radiosity method that permits linear matrix methods to be applied to the problem. ==References== <references/> ==External links== {{Portal|Computer graphics}} * [http://www.siggraph.org/education/materials/HyperGraph/radiosity/overview_1.htm Radiosity Overview, from HyperGraph of SIGGRAPH] (provides full matrix radiosity algorithm and progressive radiosity algorithm) * [http://freespace.virgin.net/hugo.elias/radiosity/radiosity.htm Radiosity, by Hugo Elias] (also provides a general overview of lighting algorithms, along with programming examples) * [http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~matt/courses/cs563/talks/radiosity.html Radiosity, by Allen Martin] (a slightly more mathematical explanation of radiosity) * [http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~parag/projects/CG2/asign2/report/RADical.shtml RADical, by Parag Chaudhuri] (an implementation of shooting & sorting variant of progressive radiosity algorithm with OpenGL acceleration, extending from GLUTRAD by Colbeck) * [http://www.tralvex.com/pub/rover/abs-mnu.htm ROVER, by Tralvex Yeap] (Radiosity Abstracts & Bibliography Library) * [http://dudka.cz/rrv Radiosity Renderer and Visualizer] (simple implementation of radiosity renderer based on [[OpenGL]]) [[Category:3D computer graphics]] [[Category:Heat transfer]] {{Link GA|de}} [[cs:Radiozita]] [[de:Radiosity (Computergrafik)]] [[es:Radiosidad]] [[eo:Radiositeo]] [[fr:Radiosité]] [[hr:Izračenje]] [[it:Radiosity]] [[he:Radiosity]] [[nl:Radiosity]] [[ja:ラジオシティ]] [[pl:Radiosity]] [[zh:辐射度算法]]</text> </page> <page> <id>31164</id> <title>Raghu Ramakrishnan</title> <text>{{Infobox Scientist | name = Raghu Ramakrishnan | image = | image_width = 150px | caption = | birth_date = | birth_place = | death_date = | death_place = | residence = | citizenship = | nationality = | ethnicity = | field = [[Computer Science]] | work_institution = [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], [[Yahoo!
