newer scanners are able to output the image directly with all existing data instead of breaking it down to 24-bit. This 48-bit raw image can then be saved immediately and digital processing performed later. * SilverFast HDR<ref>Patrick Wagner, [http://www.filmscanner.info/en/SilverFast_HDR.html Software test report SilverFast HDR] by [http://www.filmscanner.info/ filmscanner.info/ScanDig], retrieved December 26, 2010.</ref> * SilverFast HDR IT8 - with [[IT8]]-target for [[ICC profile|ICC profiling]] * SilverFast HDR Studio - with additional features SilverFast HDR contains the functionality of SilverFast Ai for 48-bit raw data, such as defining output size and [[Image resolution|resolution]], auto-adjusting of highlights and shadows, three-part histogram, gradation curves, selective color correction, [[unsharp masking]], color cast removal slider, [[Color_printing#Color_separation_process|color separation]], and [[CMYK color model|CMYK]]-preview. SilverFast HDR can be used as a native [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] for [[Adobe Photoshop]], as a universal [[TWAIN]] module, or as a [[standalone program|stand-alone]] application. The HDR Studio version provides additional features like AACO (Auto-Adaptive Contrast Enhancement), [[JPEG 2000]], USMPlus (Unsharp Mask Plus), CloneTool and PrinTao. ==== HDRi (64Bit RAW data with infrared channel) ==== With version 6.6.1 any SilverFast HDR version supports the RAW data format [[HDRi (data format)|HDRi]]. These 64-bit HDRi color files and 32-bit HDRi greyscale files contain additional 16-bit infrared RAW data besides the 48-bit color RAW data and 16-bit greyscale RAW data respectively. Therefore, a scanner with an infrared channel available to the software is necessary. This RAW format can keep any readable image information for later post-processing. For example, the removal of dust and scratches with iSRD can now be done afterwards. === SilverFast Archive Suite === The SilverFast Archive Suite combines the two programs SilverFast Ai IT8 and SilverFast HDR Studio with an integrated color management system. This package is suitable for archiving slides, negatives, and photos, whereas the post processing can take place anytime after scanning.<ref>[http://web.me.com/johnbarclayphoto/John_Barclay_Photo/Blog/Entries/2010/5/6_SIlverfast_Archive_Suite_Test_Report.html Archive Suite Test Report] by photographer John Barclay, May 6, 2010, retrieved December 26, 2010.</ref> * SilverFast Archive Suite SE - consisting of SilverFast SE Plus and SilverFast HDR * SilverFast Archive Suite - consisting of SilverFast Ai IT8 and SilverFast HDR Studio and [[IT8]] calibration targets === SilverFast PrintTao === [[Image:SilverFast PrinTao.jpg|thumb|250px|Screenshot: SilverFast PrinTao]] PrinTao is a software for printing images and documents. [[Style sheet (desktop publishing)|Templates]] can be used to make workflow easier and faster by reducing the number of similar and repetitive worksteps. PrinTao contains several predefined templates to which the user can add self-made ones. Some other features: * Positioning of pictures automatically or manually on the preview with the aid of grids and auxiliary lines * [[Image scaling|Scaling]], Mirroring, Rotation, layout of pictures * Inserting text in or around a picture * Adding copyright information to pictures * Adding IPTC or [[Exchangeable image file format|EXIF]] meta data. The PrinTao module is already included in the SilverFast Ai / DC / HDR Studio versions. === Optional features === As marked in the table above, some products are available with the following additional features: ==== Multi-Exposure (ME) ==== "Multi-Exposure" is an exposure blending technique for scanning transparent originals like slides, negatives, and film strips with increased [[Dynamic_range#Photography|dynamic range]].<ref>[http://www.silverfast.com/PDF/TestReport_ME_DWueller.pdf Test Report: SilverFast Multiexposure and Scanner Dynamic Range] by Dietmar Wueller, Image Engineering, February 5, 2007, retrieved December 26, 2010 (pdf)</ref> This is accomplished by scanning the original multiple times with different [[Shutter speed|exposure times]], increasing the dynamic range and preserving detail in the light and shadow areas of the image.<ref>Patrick Wagner, [http://www.filmscanner.info/en/FragenSilverFast.html#MultiExposure Which kind of quality increase does MultiExposure provide?], FAQ, Scan Software Silverfast, filmscanner.info/ScanDig, retrieved December 26, 2010.</ref> Multi-Exposure does not work with reflective originals and differs from "Multi-Sampling," which also scans multiple times but with unaltered exposure. ==== PhotoProof ==== PhotoProof is a tool for color-true and binding processing of images from digital cameras. The image optimization is done in the [[RGB color space]]. When activating PhotoProof, the user will immediately see a [[CMYK color model|CMYK]] simulation of the image by means of RGB softproofing on the calibrated monitor. Thereafter a color-true contact proof can be created on any suitable, calibrated output device. The user just has to choose the [[ICC profile]] for the printer and the [[FOGRA]] media wedge to be embedded. The embedded media wedge is used as a reference for a true-to-color proof. ==== ColorServer ==== ColorServer executes the processes of color conversion, [[Image scaling|scaling]], sharpening, [[Color_printing#Color_separation_process|separation]], and optimization of image data automatically (even [[batch processing]]) in the 48-bit color space. The possibility of saving [[High dynamic range imaging|high dynamic range]] images in the [[JPEG 2000]] format assures maximum compression of image data without loss of quality. JPEG 2000 also allows a compression ratio of 10:1 without any visible loss of image quality. == IT8 calibration == [[Image:IT8target.jpg|thumb|250px|IT8.7/1 target by [[LaserSoft Imaging]]]] The process chain (original - scanner / digital camera - monitor - printer) requires device calibration for accurate color reproduction. [[IT8]] calibration runs automatically in SilverFast, using a combination of [[barcode]] technology and auto-alignment. SilverFast also utilizes the scanner as a measuring device to create an [[ICC profile]] for printer calibration.<ref>[http://www.silverfast.com/PDF/printer_calibration_review_en.pdf Nadir Magazine: scanner- and printer-Calibration with SilverFast Ai IT8] by Agostino Maiello</ref> == Supported devices == The SilverFast website lists over 325 supported scanners<ref>[http://www.silverfast.com/product/en.html Products supported by SilverFast], LaserSoft Imaging</ref> and 214 supported digital cameras.<ref name=DC_camera_list>{{cite web |title=List of digital cameras supported by SilverFast |url=http://www.silverfast.com/show/dc-cameras-raw/en.html }}</ref> Inexpensive (sub-US$100) Microsoft Windows-only 35mm USB scanners sold under various names are generally not supported. Each scanner model requires a separate license. == Heidelberg drum scanner == SilverFast Ai Studio supports high-end prepress [[Image scanner#Drum|drum scanners]] made by [[Heidelberger Druckmaschinen|Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG]] (Linotype - Hell) on Microsoft Windows 2000, XP, Vista and 7, as well as Mac OS X 10.3-10.5 operating systems. Supported models include the Chromagraph 3300/3400, Tango/XL, Topaz, Nexscan, and Primescan. == References == <references /> == Sources == * Taz Tally, Ph.D. ''SilverFast - The Official Guide.'' - Sybex, 2003.
