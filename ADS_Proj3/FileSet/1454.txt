The source code of FastTracker 2 is written in [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]] using [[Turbo Pascal|Borland Pascal 7]] and [[Turbo Assembler|TASM]]. == History == In 1993, Triton released FastTracker. This tracker was able to load and save standard four channel [[MOD (file format)|MOD]] files, as well as extended MOD files with six or eight channels (identical to standard MOD files, aside from the extra channel data and ID markers "6CHN" or "8CHN"). It was only compatible with [[Creative Labs]]' [[SoundBlaster]] series of [[sound card]]s, which were most popular on the PC at that time. The whole editor was a single 43 [[KiB]] [[DOS executable]]. Through 1994, the musicians in Triton released some songs in a new multichannel "XM" format, accompanied by a pre-release, standalone player. In November 1994, FastTracker 2 was released to the public, with support for the [[Gravis Ultrasound]] soundcard. FT2's biggest "rivals" in the scene were [[Scream Tracker]], and in later years, [[Impulse Tracker]]. "FT2 vs IT" is a common and still ongoing debate among musicians, usually involving IT users complaining about FT2's mouse interface while FT2 users commending the very same, and pointing out that every mouse feature has a keyboard shortcut as well. FastTracker 2 was discontinued after the release of version 2.08 in August 1997, though a beta version of 2.09 was leaked to the public in 1999. Version 2.09 was only an unofficial bugfix by Andreas Viklund. The bugfix also has a few new usability additions, such as the possibility to exit previously "stuck" windows by only using the mouse. Version 2.09 does not have full support for the Gravis Ultrasound card, and it was not an official release although it was available from Starbreeze's website. On May 23, 1999, Starbreeze productions announced on their website that ''"FT2 has been put on hold indefinitely. [...] If this was an ideal world, where there was infinite time and no need to make a living, there would definitely be a multiplatform Fasttracker3. Unfortunately this world is nothing like that,"'' signed by Vogue.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20010628033251/www.metamacro.com/fast3/home.html FastTracker 3 homepage] - as retrieved by web.archive.org in 2001</ref> == Architecture and features == The FT2 interface is largely inspired by the looks of [[Amiga]]'s [[Protracker]]. The screen consists of a pattern editor in the lower half, while the upper half features an instrument selector on the right, and the general module settings and some oscilloscopes. The pattern editor can be changed to sample and instrument editors screens. The program also features a little ''[[Nibbles (computer game)|Nibbles]]'' clone and in-software documentation for all the features. === Patterns === Patterns are essentially sheets of music where the musician is able to compose the actual musical score. A pattern consists of several rows (64 by default) and is divided to columns ("tracks"). Each row can have one note in every track. A note can look like the following: C#4 02 20 R11 This means the note is a C#-note on the [[chromatic scale]], played at the 4th octave (according to the [[scientific pitch notation]]), with instrument number 2. The next column is the volume setting on a 0x00-0x40 hexadecimal scale, and the last column enables a variety of effects to be applied to the sound (in this case, retriggering). A song consists of a collection of different patterns which can be played in a user-defined order to create the final song structure. === Samples === Samples are generic raw sound data to be played back at various frequencies, much the way normal musical [[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]] do. Samples can have a loop start and end point which enable the sound to repeat endlessly, either repeated continuously or in a way which is called "ping-pong loop" in FT2, and essentially means the sample played back and forth as soon as the replay gets "stuck" in the loop. (This is also called a "bidirectional loop".) The musicians are able to either record samples or load existing ones, manipulate them by cutting and/or pasting parts, or just drawing them by hand. There's also a feature to [[Fade (audio engineering)|crossfade]] the sample with itself, thus allowing the loop points to be seamless. === Instruments === Instruments are essentially arrays of samples with additional convenience features. A musician can assign different samples to different pitches of the sound, thus eliminating the possibility of a sample sounding bad if played too high or too low. Instruments support various loopable envelopes to be set on either the sound volume or the stereo panning, as well as built-in [[vibrato]]. It is also possible to set the generic settings of the instrument here: fine-tuning, default volume, default panning and relative starting note to C-4. FT2 allows to play in live with a
