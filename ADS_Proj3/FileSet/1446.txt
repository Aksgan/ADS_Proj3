can be [[reproducibility|replicated]], or the [[sparsity-of-effects principle]] <!--and/or the hierarchical ordering principle (which states roughly that higher order interactions are progressively less important) -->can often be exploited. Replication is more common for small experiments and is a very reliable way of assessing experimental error. When the number of factors is large (typically more than about 5 factors, but this does vary by application), replication of the design can become operationally difficult. In these cases, it is common to only run a single replicate of the design, and to assume that factor interactions of more than a certain order (say, between three or more factors) are negligible. Under this assumption, estimates of such high order interactions are estimates of an exact zero, thus really an estimate of experimental error. When there are many factors, many experimental runs will be necessary, even without replication. For example, experimenting with 10 factors at two levels each produces 2<sup>10</sup>=1024 combinations. At some point this becomes infeasible due to high cost or insufficient resources. In this case, [[fractional factorial designs]] may be used. As with any statistical experiment, the experimental runs in a factorial experiment should be randomized to reduce the impact that [[biased sample|bias]] could have on the experimental results. In practice, this can be a large operational challenge. Factorial experiments can be used when there are more than two levels of each factor. However, the number of experimental runs required for three-level (or more) factorial designs will be considerably greater than for their two-level counterparts. Factorial designs are therefore less attractive if a researcher wishes to consider more than two levels. ==Analysis== {{main|Yates analysis}} A factorial experiment can be analyzed using [[ANOVA]] or [[regression analysis]]. It is relatively easy to estimate the main effect for a factor. To compute the main effect of a factor "A", subtract the average response of all experimental runs for which A was at its low (or first) level from the average response of all experimental runs for which A was at its high (or second) level. Other useful exploratory analysis tools for factorial experiments include [[main effects plots]], interaction plots, and a normal probability plot of the estimated effects. When the factors are continuous, two-level factorial designs assume that the effects are [[linear]]. If a [[quadratic]] effect is expected for a factor, a more complicated experiment should be used, such as a [[central composite design]]. Optimization of factors that could have quadratic effects is the primary goal of [[response surface methodology]]. ==See also== *[[Design of experiments]] == Notes == <references/> ==References== * [[George E.
