=== Identifying as an inherent function with RTLS === In a cooperative approach, other but with simple scanning ranging procedures, locating in an ad hoc networking concept requires appropriate identification of the nodes involved. This may be primarily performed on the [[MAC layer]] by exchanging [[MAC address]]es. But for operational purposes there may be need for an independent but as well hierarchical identification scheme. This is formally envisaged with the ISO/IEC standard 24730-1. Such identification is the minimum requirement bridging to functionalities of resident or portable [[RFID]] and generally to [[MIIM]]. Respective precautions must be set forth with the special implementations and therefore may refer to standardized numbering concepts as with ISO/IEC 15459-2 and according subsets in a numbering hierarchy. For an RTLS to function, the location of tagged items must be determined either by cumputing in a central processor or by an autonomous mobile computing facility. Locating is generally accomplished with the following: * Mobile and / or fixed nodes disclose membership to communities and invite other nodes to communicate. * Mobile and / or fixed nodes exchange communication parameters to facilitate communication with each other. * Mobile and / or fixed nodes exchange enrollment data to establish a proper communications link with the community. * Mobile and / or fixed nodes exchange identification data and perform encrypted communications. * Mobile and / or fixed nodes perform metering and exchange metered distances. * Mobile and / or fixed nodes autonomously perform locating based on subsequently obtained distance information. * Mobile and / or fixed nodes forward sensor data and other data for application purposes. * Mobile and / or fixed nodes relay sensor data and other data for application purposes to and from other nodes. In case on an asymmetric system layout, cooperativeness still remains a prerequisite, but the functions may be shared with certain specialization of various classes of nodes. === Nomenclature === In addition to the ISO/IEC standards on interfacing as referred above, another basing standard was published end of 2007 as a final discussion document on terms and definitions.However, it could not yet be disclosed, which special breed of systems operates with the named types of transponders. Probably further discussion of the standards proposal will lead to a more universally valid glossary or transponder type zoo. * ISO/IEC FDIS 19762-5: Information technology AIDC techniques, Harmonized vocabulary, Part 5 – Locating systems. This discussion paper is published on the website of subcommittee SC31 of ISI technical committee 122 on the website of www.autoid.org. This emerging standard now names the following items as components in an RTLS: * ''infrastructure''(RTLS): System components existing between the air interface protocol and the RTLS server API * ''exciter''(RTLS): Device that transmits a signal that alters the behavior of an RTLS transmitter. * ''interrogator''(RTLS): This term is used in the context, however not yet defined. Probably it may the very same type of unit as a reader. Typically an interrogator actively reads and 'readers' are always active unit in this context. * ''reader''(RTLS): Device that receives signals from an RTLS transmitter. * ''server''(RTLS): Computing device that aggregates data from the readers and determines location of transmitters. * ''transmitter''(RTLS): Active radio devices that utilize the specified RTLS protocols. However, no requirement is set that any of these device types must be apart from any of the other types, hence combinations are also conformal to these definitions. == Standardization of RTLS communications == The communications between RTLS nodes is not defined with the air interface standardization of an RTLS system. Not all of the RTLS systems standardized or in process of standardization is subject of standardization as well. In detail * ISO/IEC 24730-1 does not address a special RTLS system, but the communality of RTLS system. * ISO/IEC 24730-2 refers to a strongly proprietary communications system. This system is designed for good coexistence with other wireless services in the 2.45 GHz ISM band. * ISO/IEC 24730-5 will refer to the standardized communications according to IEEE 802.15.4aCSS. This system is designed for good coexistence with other wireless services, especially with IEEE 802.11 b/g in the 2.45 GHz ISM band. All other offered RTLS systems do currently not comply with any standard for RTLS, but mandatorily must ensure good coexistence with other wireless services in their respective ISM bands, i.e. 433 MHz, 2.45 GHz, 5.8 GHz. == See also == * [[Locating engine]] * [[Real-time locating]] * [[DASH7]] == External links and references == {{Reflist}} * [http://www.iec.ch/ International Standardization in Engineering] * [http://www.iso.org/ International Standardization in Industry and Science] * [http://www.iso.org/iso/search.htm Search Page for ISO standards concerning RTLS] * [http://www.ieee.org/ International Standardization in Electrical Engineering] * [http://www.ietf.org/ International Standardization in Communications] * [http://www.aimglobal.org/ International Lobbying in Automatic Identification] * [http://www.aimusa.org/ US American Lobbying in Automatic Identification] * [http://www.aimglobal.org/technologies/rtls/ Statement of International Lobbying on Real Time Locating] * [http://www.autoid.org/SC31/wg5.htm/ ISO JTC1 (TC122) SC31 WG5 Homepage on RTLS] * [http://www.autoid.org/sc31/MIIM/MIIMn0061_MtgRpt_20071030-31.doc/ ISO JTC1 (TC122) SC31 WG5 Inaugural Meeting on MIIM] * [http://www.qed.org/ Company driving international standardization on e.g. RFID and RTLS in US] * [http://www.autoid.org/SC31/wg5.htm Schedule and actual scope of RTLS standardisation in ISO JTC1, TC122 and SC31] * [http://www.car-to-car.org/ Car-to_Car communications programme funding of the European Union] === Standards === * Real-time locating standards * [http://www.iso.org/iso/home.htm International Organization for Standardization] * [http://www.autoid.org/SC31/sc31.htm ISO/IEC 19762-5 Information technology -- Automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) techniques -- Harmonized vocabulary -- Part 5: Locating systems ] * [http://www.iso.org/iso/search.htm?qt=iso+24730-1&searchSubmit=Search&sort=rel&type=simple&published=on Real-Time Locating with ISO/IEC 24730] * [http://www.autoid.org/sc31/wg5.htm Standardization for Real-Time Locating in ISO JTC1 / TC122 SC31 WG5 with www.autoid.org] * [http://www.autoid.org/sc31/sc31.htm Standardization for Automatic Identification in ISO JTC1 / TC122 SC31 WG5 with www.autoid.org] * [http://www.autoid.org/2002_Documents/TC%20122_WG%207/N026_RFIDStds_Updt_20010123.ppt www.AutoID.org on Real-Time Locating] === Literature === * Indoor Geolocation Using Wireless Local Area Networks (Berichte aus der Informatik), Michael Wallbaum, [[Shaker Verlag]] , Aachen (2006), ISBN 3-8322-4838-2 * Location-Based Services: Fundamentals and Operation, Axel Küpper, Wiley, New York, 2005, ISBN 978-0470092316 * Local Positioning Systems: LBS applications and services, Krzysztof Kolodziej & Hjelm Johan, CRC Press Inc (2006), ISBN 978-0849333491 * Ortsbezogene Anwendungen und Dienste, 4.
