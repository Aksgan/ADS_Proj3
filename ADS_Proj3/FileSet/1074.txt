sprinklers require {{convert|18|in|cm|abbr=on}} of clearance (free of cable trays, etc.) below the sprinklers. [[Clean agent]] fire suppression gaseous systems are sometimes installed to suppress a fire earlier than the fire sprinkler system. Passive fire protection elements include the installation of [[Firewall (construction)|fire walls]] around the data center, so a fire can be restricted to a portion of the facility for a limited time in the event of the failure of the active fire protection systems, or if they are not installed. For critical facilities these firewalls are often insufficient to protect heat-sensitive electronic equipment, however, because conventional firewall construction is only rated for flame penetration time, not heat penetration. There are also deficiencies in the protection of vulnerable entry points into the server room, such as cable penetrations, coolant line penetrations and air ducts. For mission critical data centers [[fireproofing|fireproof vaults]] with a [[fireproofing|Class 125]] rating are necessary to meet [[library fires|NFPA 75]]<ref>Fixen, Edward L. and Vidar S.

Physical access to the site is usually restricted to selected personnel, with controls including [[bollard]]s and [[mantrap]]s.<ref>[http://www.csoonline.com/article/220665 19 Ways to Build Physical Security Into a Data Center]</ref> [[Video camera]] surveillance and permanent [[security guard]]s are almost always present if the data center is large or contains sensitive information on any of the systems within. The use of finger print recognition man traps is starting to be commonplace. ==Energy use== {{main|IT energy management}} Energy use is a central issue for data centers. Power draw for data centers ranges from a few kW for a rack of servers in a closet to several tens of MW for large facilities. Some facilities have power densities more than 100 times that of a typical office building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/program/dc_energy_consumption.html|title=Data Center Energy Consumption Trends|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=2010-06-10}}</ref> For higher power density facilities, electricity costs are a dominant [[operating expense]] and account for over 10% of the [[total cost of ownership]] (TCO) of a data center.<ref>J Koomey, C.

This simple ratio is the total power entering the data center divided by the power used by the IT equipment. :<math> \mathrm{PUE} = {\mbox{Total Facility Power} \over \mbox{IT Equipment Power}} </math> Power used by support equipment, often referred to as overhead load, mainly consists of cooling systems, power delivery, and other facility infrastructure like lighting. The average data center in the US has a PUE of 2.0,<ref name="energystar1"/> meaning that the facility uses one Watt of overhead power for every Watt delivered to IT equipment. State-of-the-art data center energy efficiency is estimated to be roughly 1.2.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://microsite.accenture.com/svlgreport/Documents/pdf/SVLG_Report.pdf|title=Data Center Energy Forecast|publisher=Silicon Valley Leadership Group}}</ref> Some large data center operators like [[Microsoft]] and [[Yahoo!]] have published projections of PUE for facilities in development; [[Google]] publishes quarterly actual efficiency performance from data centers in operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2009/10/15/google-efficiency-update-pue-of-1-22/|title=Google Efficiency Update|publisher=Data Center Knowledge|accessdate=2010-06-08}}</ref> The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] has an [[Energy Star]] rating for standalone or large data centers.
