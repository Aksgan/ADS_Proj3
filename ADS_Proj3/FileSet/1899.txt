system requirements and has the correct program installed. Then, the MLM can give advice for when and where it is needed. ===MLLP=== A large portion of HL7 messaging is transported by Minimal Lower Layer Protocol (MLLP) supported by Microsoft<ref>[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee409260%28BTS.10%29.aspx MLLP on MSDN]</ref> and Oracle.<ref>[http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B14099_19/integrate.1012/b19370/supp_protos.htm#BACIFDJG Oracle supported protocols]</ref> ===CCOW=== [[CCOW]], or "Clinical Context Object Workgroup," is a standard protocol designed to enable disparate applications to share user context and patient context in real-time, and at the user-interface level. CCOW implementations typically require a CCOW vault system to manage user security between applications. ===Functional EHR and PHR specifications=== Functional specifications for an [[electronic health record]]. ==Country specific aspects== ===Australia=== HL7 Australia was established in 1998. Australia was an early adopter of the HL7 V2.x standards, which are now ubiquitously used in Australian public and private healthcare organisations. The localisation of the HL7 standards is undertaken in cooperation with the national standards body, Standards Australia. HL7 Australia closely cooperates with the National E-Health Transition Authority (NEHTA). * [http://www.HL7.org.au HL7 Australia] * [http://www.e-Health.Standards.org.au Standards Australia (IT-014 "Health Informatics"] * [http://www.NEHTA.gov.au NEHTA] ===Finland=== '''National IT services for healthcare''' The Social Insurance Institution of Finland is building a national ePrescribing and patient record archival service based on HL7 CDA R2 and V3 messages. Phased deployment is scheduled for 2008-2011. Version 2 messaging is widely deployed in most hospitals and healthcare centers. CDA R1 is used in sharing patient records on a regional level. * [http://www.hl7.fi HL7 Finland national affiliate] ===Germany=== The German chapter of HL7 was founded in 1993. This is an entity for benefit to the public and registered as an association as HL7 e. V. Due to federal structure of operational administration in German healthcare, the standardization aspect is much behind the possibilities of the public economy and due to competitive interests in industry of low normative impact to healthcare information systems development. Currently HL7 in Germany operates as an informal cluster and collaborates with the national standardization body.<ref>[http://www.din.de/sixcms_upload/media/2616/NAMed_Jahresbericht_2007.pdf DIN NAMed Jahresbericht 2007]</ref> The voluntary membership in HL7 relies on personal interest and engagement of clinical users and mainly on industrial interest: Clinical memberships are in minority. There is low membership of governmental administration and thus low contribution to ongoing discussion e.g. on patient data records (EPA = elektronische Patientenakte) balancing data availability vs. data security. Impact on productivity for hospital information systems (called KIS = Krankenhaus-Informationssysteme in German) is of no importance yet, as the variability of HIS systems has not been challenged by HL7. Governmental funding for a broader adoption of HL7 does yet not exist in Germany, neither on federal level nor in most of the regional governments. ===The Netherlands=== '''AORTA - National Healthcare ICT infrastructure''' AORTA is the Dutch national infrastructure for the exchange of data between healthcare providers. AORTA uses HL7 version 3 messages and documents as its core mechanism for information exchange. The initial specifications were created in 2003. The Dutch Ministry of Health is working on a virtual national Electronic Patient Records (EPR) which will enable healthcare providers to share patient data. This development takes place in close collaboration with Nictiz, the National Information and Communication Technology Institute for Healthcare. Nictiz coordinates its efforts with regard to the usage of HL7 version 3 with the volunteers of HL7 the Netherlands. Almost all hospitals use HL7 version 2 to support hospital-internal workflows. EDIfact is being used to support workflows involving general practitioners (GPs/PCPs). EDIfact will be slowly replaced by HL7 version 3. *[http://www.hl7.nl HL7 the Netherlands] *[http://www.nictiz.nl Nictiz] *[http://www.ringholm.de/docs/00980_en.htm AORTA whitepaper] ===Pakistan=== HLH - Health Life Horizon HLH (a national project) is carrying out at School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences of National University of Science and Technology and is supported by Govt of Pakistan with funds provided by National ICT R&D Fund. HLH basic theme is to target health care information exchange and interoperability using HL7 version 3. Though the penetration and use of HL7 in Pakistan is lower than the countries like US and that of Europe. But its getting popularity among the stakeholders in Pakistan. HLH team put its tremendous efforts to develop state of the art HL7 version 3 tools and technologies. Also they are continuously involved to carry out research taking the development one step ahead. Additionally they organized and are organizing awareness seminars, meetings and workshops from time to time at various locations in Pakistan. HLH is collaborating with several other renowned organizations from Pakistan to be part of this journey. These efforts created a very good impression not only at national level but also at international level. HLH Team members regularly participated in HL7 international Working Group Meetings and conferences for last two years. On Oct 1, 2010 HL7 International announced Pakistan chapter formally at 24th Plenary and WGM in Cambridge USA. Pakistan is now 37th affiliate of HL7 International around the world. HL7 Pakistan is now officially authorized to give memberships to local organizations along with other privileges like certification, training etc. *[http://www.hl7.seecs.edu.pk] *[http://www.hl7.org.pk] ===USA=== '''Laika''' The [[Certification Commission for Healthcare Information Technology|Certification Commission for Healthcare Information Technology (CCHIT)]] has developed an open-source program called [[Laika (EHR testing framework)|Laika]] to test EHR software for compliance with CCHIT interoperability standards. '''HIPAA''' HL7â€™s initial involvement in the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA) legislation began in 1996 with the formation of the Attachments special interest group to standardize the supplemental information needed to support health care insurance, and other [[e-commerce]] transactions. The initial deliverable of this group was a set of six recommended Claims Attachments for the Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) process. Future attachment projects include, but are not limited to, Home Health, Skilled Nursing Facility, [[durable medical equipment]] (DME), [[end stage renal disease]] (ESRD), and Pre-Authorization and Referrals. The Attachment special interest group is responsible for implementing the Administrative Simplification provisions of HIPAA mandates, providing on-going support, and representing HL7 in the Designated Standards Maintenance Organization ([http://aspe.hhs.gov/admnsimp/final/dsmo.htm DSMO]) efforts. Its purpose is to encourage the use of HL7 for uniform implementation of this supplemental information. This SIG
