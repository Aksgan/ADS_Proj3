handset use of 4P4C/RJ9 plug]] When a cable assembly consisting of a 4P4C connector and a 4-conductor cable is used for connecting a telephone handset to the telephone base; and the 4-conductor cable is wired to the connector and to the handset elements in a straight-through (non-crossover) manner, the wiring method shown in the diagram is in effect. In this case, the handset's speaker (the transducer) functions normally, even though its polarity is reversed; but the [[electret microphone]] used in most modern handsets will not function normally, because an electret microphone is polarity dependent. However, if the wire pair for the handset transducer and the wire pair for the handset microphone are each wired in a crossover arrangement, then both the transducer and microphone will function correctly; even if the handset has an electret microphone. Most telephone handset cords (cable assemblies) are wired this way. <ref name=DirecTV>[http://www.gbpvr.com/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Utility/DirecTVChannelControl GBPVR Wiki. ''Direc TV Channel Control.''] "Each end of a handset cord is wired opposite the other..."</ref> The vast majority of telephones that were made until around 1985 had a carbon microphone in the handset. Since a carbon microphone is not polarity sensitive, the cable assembly connecting this type of handset to the telephone base can use either straight-through or crossover wiring. The impedance of the handset transducer is usually at least 100 Ohm, much greater than the impedance of the typical home loudspeaker: 8 Ohm. ===Data port=== The [[Macintosh 128K]], [[Macintosh 512K]] and [[Macintosh Plus]] from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] used 4P4C connectors to connect the keyboard to the main computer housing. The connector provided power to the keyboard on the outer two conductors and received data signals on the inner pair. The cable between the computer and the keyboard was a coiled cord with an appearance very similar to a telephone handset cable.<ref>[http://www.myoldcomputers.com/museum/comp/plus.htm My Old Computers. ''Apple Macintosh Plus'']</ref> The connector wiring, however, required a polarized straight through pinout. Using a telephone handset cable instead of the supplied cable could short out the +5 volt DC supply and damage the computer or the keyboard.<ref>[http://www.megadon.co.uk/wb/whiteboardshow.pl/syrinx/wbfile=Mac%20Plus%20Keyboard%20Cable.wb/page=default.html Syrinx. ''Mac Plus Keyboard Cable''.] "...the cable is the same as the telephone cable that connects handsets to the phone, unfortunately [...] this type of cable and pretty much any type of pre manufactured cable [...] is wired wrong for the Mac Plus. Under no circumstances should you use this cable as you will damage your keyboard and/or your Mac!"</ref> Some consumer equipment such as [[DirecTV]] set top boxes include a 4P4C low-speed data port connector.<ref name=DirecTV/> Such connectors can be adapted for use with a computer's serial port so that control commands can be sent from the computer to the set top box. ==6P6C== {{Anchor|6P6C|6P4C|6P2C}} <!-- Redirect target for [[6P6C]], [[6P4C]], [[6P2C]] --> [[Image:Conector RJ11.jpg|thumb|6P4C crimp-on style connector]] The '''6P2C''', '''6P4C''', and '''6P6C''' modular connectors are probably most well known for their use as [[RJ11]], [[RJ14]], and [[RJ25]] [[registered jack]]s respectively. '''RJ11''' is a [[physical interface]] often used for terminating [[telephone]] wires. It is probably the most familiar of the [[registered jack]]s, being used for single line [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] telephone jacks in most homes across the world. '''RJ14''' is similar, but for two lines, and '''RJ25''' is for three lines. [[RJ61]] is a similar registered jack for four lines. The telephone line cord and its plug are more often a true RJ11 with only two conductors. Modular plugs are described as containing a number of potential [[contact]] "positions" and the actual number of contacts installed within these positions. RJ11, RJ14, and RJ25 all use the same six-position [[modular connector]], thus are physically identical except for the different number of contacts (two, four and six respectively). ===RJ11 wiring=== [[Image:Rj25 connector.jpg|thumb|6P6C connector showing the location of pin 1]] {{Main|RJ11}} Cables sold as RJ11 often actually use 6P4C RJ14 connectors (six position, four conductor), with four wires running to a central [[junction box]]. Two of its six possible contact positions connect [[tip and ring]], and the other two conductors are then unused. 6P2C and 6P6C can also be found in stores. The conductors other than the two central tip and ring conductors are in practice used for various things such as a [[ground]] for [[Party line (telephony)|selective ringers]], low voltage power for a [[dial]] light, or for 'anti-tinkle' circuitry to prevent [[pulse dialing]] phones from ringing the bell on other extensions. With [[tone dialing]], anti-tinkle measures are not required. ===Pinouts=== Holding the connector in your hand tab side down with the cable opening toward you, the pins are numbered 1–6, left to right. {| class="wikitable" |+ !
