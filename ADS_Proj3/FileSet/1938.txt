A month later on June 16, Apple stock split for the first time in a 2:1 split. Apple kept a quarterly dividend with about 0.3% yield until November 21, 1995.{{Citation|needed|date=August 2010}} Between March 1988 and January 1989, Apple undertook five acquisitions, including software companies [[Network Innovations]]{{Citation|http://www.alacrastore.com/storecontent/Thomson_M&A/Apple_Computer_Inc_acquires_Network_Innovations_Corp-21778020}}, [[Styleware]]{{Citation|http://www.alacrastore.com/storecontent/Thomson_M&A/Claris_Corp_Apple_Computer_acquires_Styleware_Inc-25405020}}, [[Nashoba Systems]]{{Citation|http://www.alacrastore.com/storecontent/Thomson_M&A/Claris_Corp_Apple_Computer_acquires_Nashoba_Systems_Inc-102005020}}, and [[Coral Software]]{{Citation|http://www.alacrastore.com/storecontent/Thomson_M&A/Apple_Computer_Inc_acquires_Coral_Software_Corp-110260020}}, as well as satellite communications company [[Orion Network Systems]].{{Citation|http://www.alacrastore.com/storecontent/Thomson_M&A/Apple_Computer_Inc_acquires_Orion_Network_Systems_Inc-24111020}} ===The Apple II family of the 1980s=== {{See also|Timeline of Apple II Family}} Apple now had two separate, incompatible platforms: the [[Apple II]], an affordable, expandable home computer, and the [[Apple Macintosh]], the closed platform for professionals. [[John Gruber]], among others, has speculated that this platform incompatibility was the main reason the Macintosh did not share the initial commercial success which was experienced by the [[Apple II]] in the late 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gruber |first=John |authorlink= John Gruber|coauthors= |date= August 7, 2004|url= http://daringfireball.net/2004/08/parlay/ |title= The Art of the Parlay, Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying About Platform Licensing and Market Share|format= |work= |pages= |publisher= [[Daring Fireball]]|accessdate= }}</ref> However, by the mid - 1980s, the Apple II was now competing with the [[IBM PC]] and its clones, and a new energy was focused upon marketing the Macintosh.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Thus, Apple continued to sell both lines promoting them to different market segments: the Macintosh to colleges, college students, and [[knowledge worker]]s, and the Apple II to home users and public schools. A few months after introducing the Mac, Apple released a compact version of the Apple II called the [[Apple IIc]]. And in 1986 Apple introduced the [[Apple IIgs]], an Apple II positioned as something of a hybrid product with a mouse-driven, Mac-like operating environment. Apple II computers remained an important part of Apple's business until they were discontinued in the early 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} ===The Mac family=== {{See also|Timeline of Macintosh models}} At the same time, the Mac was becoming a product family of its own. The original model evolved into the [[Macintosh Plus|Mac Plus]] in 1986 and spawned the [[Macintosh SE|Mac SE]] and the [[Macintosh II|Mac II]] in 1987 and the [[Macintosh Classic|Mac Classic]] and [[Macintosh LC|Mac LC]] in 1990. Meanwhile, Apple attempted its first portable Macs: the failed [[Macintosh Portable]] in 1989 and then the more popular [[PowerBook]] in 1991, a landmark product that established the modern form and [[ergonomics|ergonomic]] layout of the [[laptop]]. Popular products and increasing revenues made this a good time for Apple. [[MacAddict]] magazine has called 1989 to 1991 the "first golden age" of the Macintosh. On February 19, 1987, Apple registered the "[[Apple.com]]" domain name, making it one of the first hundred companies to register a [[.com]] address on the nascent [[Internet]].<ref>[http://thelongestlistofthelongeststuffatthelongestdomainnameatlonglast.com/first71.html First dot com .com ever in the world. symbolics.com cmu.edu purdue.edu rice.edu ucla.edu think.com css.gov mitre.org<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> ===The early-mid 1990s=== {{Unreferenced section|date=August 2010}} In the late 1980s, Apple's fiercest technological rivals were the [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]] platforms. But by the 1990s, computers based on the [[IBM PC]] had become more popular than all three; they finally had a comparable [[GUI]] thanks to [[Windows 3.0]], and were out-competing Apple. Apple's response to the PC threat was a profusion of new Macintosh lines including [[Macintosh Quadra|Quadra]], [[Macintosh Centris|Centris]], and [[Macintosh Performa|Performa]]. Unfortunately, these new lines were marketed poorly. For one, there were too many models, differentiated by very minor graduations in their [[technical specifications|tech specs]]. The excess of arbitrary model numbers confused many consumers and hurt Apple's reputation for simplicity. Apple's retail resellers like [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]] and [[CompUSA]] often failed to sell or even competently display these Macs. Compounding matters was the fact while the machines were cheaper than a comparable PC (counting all the things built in which had to be added to the 'bare bones PC') the poor marketing gave the impression that the machines were more expensive.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} In 1991, Apple partnered with long-time competitor [[IBM]] to form the [[AIM alliance]]. The ultimate goal was to create a revolutionary new computing platform, known as [[PReP]], which would use IBM and Motorola hardware and Apple software. As the first step toward the PReP platform, Apple started the [[Power Macintosh]] line in 1994, using IBM's [[PowerPC]] processor. These processors used a [[RISC]] architecture, which differed substantially from the Motorola [[68000|680X0]] series that were used by all previous Macs. Parts of Apple's operating system software were rewritten so that most software written for older Macs could run in [[emulator|emulation]] on the PowerPC series.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Apple also refused IBM's offer to purchase the company, but later unsuccessfully sought another offer from IBM.<ref name=markoff19970901>{{cite news|last=Markoff|first=John|title=An 'Unknown' Co-Founder Leaves After 20 Years of Glory and Turmoil|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/01/business/an-unknown-co-founder-leaves-after-20-years-of-glory-and-turmoil.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|accessdate=2011-02-04|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1997-09-01}}</ref> In addition to computers, Apple has also produced consumer devices. In 1993, Apple released the [[Newton (platform)|Newton]], an early [[Personal Digital Assistant|PDA]]. Though it failed commercially, it defined and launched the category and was a forerunner and inspiration of devices such as [[Palm Pilot]] and [[Pocket PC]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} ===1997: The Return of Jobs=== In 1996, the struggling [[NeXT]] company beat out Be Inc.'s [[BeOS]] in its bid to sell its operating system to Apple. Apple purchased [[Steve Jobs]]' company, NeXT on December 10, 1996, and its NeXTstep operating system. This would not only bring Steve Jobs back to Apple's management, but NeXT technology would become the foundation of the [[Mac OS X]] operating system. On November 10, 1997, Apple introduced the [[Apple Store (online)|Apple Store]], an online retail store based upon the [[WebObjects]] application server the company had acquired in its purchase of [[NeXT]]. The new direct sales outlet was also tied to a new build-to-order manufacturing strategy.<ref>Harreld, Heather.
