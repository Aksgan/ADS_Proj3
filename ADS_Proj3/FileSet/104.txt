Player is a browser plugin, and cannot run within a usual e-mail client, such as [[Microsoft Outlook|Outlook]]. Instead, a link must open a browser window. A [[Gmail]] labs feature allows playback of YouTube videos linked in emails. ===Flash Video=== {{Main|Flash Video}} Virtually all browser plugins for video are [[Gratis#Software|free of charge]] and cross-platform, including Adobe's offering of Flash Video, which was first introduced with Flash version 6. Flash Video has been a popular choice for websites due to the large [[#Installed user base|installed user base]] and programmability of Flash. In 2010, Apple [[#Criticism|publicly criticized]] Adobe Flash, including its implementation of video playback for not taking advantage of hardware acceleration, one reason Flash is not to be found on Apple's mobile devices. Soon after Apple's criticism, Adobe demoed and released a beta version of Flash 10.1, which takes advantage of GPU hardware acceleration even on a Mac. Flash 10.2 beta, released December 2010, finally adds multicore CPU hardware acceleration for h.264, three years after most other decoders. ===Flash Audio=== Flash Audio is most commonly encoded in [[MP3]] or AAC ([[Advanced Audio Coding]]) however it does also support [[ADPCM]], Nellymoser ([[Nellymoser Asao Codec]]) and [[Speex]] audio codecs. Flash allows sample rates of 11, 22 and 44.1 kHz. It does not support 48 kHz audio sample rate which is the standard TV, DVD sample rate. On August 20, 2007, Adobe announced on its blog that with Update 3 of Flash Player 9, Flash Video will also support some parts of the [[MPEG-4]] international standards.<ref name=MP4>{{cite web |url=http://www.kaourantin.net/2007/08/what-just-happened-to-video-on-web_20.html |title=What just happened to video on the web |publisher=Adobe }}</ref> Specifically, Flash Player will have support for video compressed in [[H.264]] (MPEG-4 Part 10), audio compressed using [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] (MPEG-4 Part 3), the F4V, [[MP4]] (MPEG-4 Part 14), M4V, M4A, [[3GP]] and [[MOV]] multimedia [[Container format (digital)|container formats]], [[3GPP]] [[Timed Text]] specification (MPEG-4 Part 17) which is a standardized subtitle format and partial parsing support for the 'ilst' atom which is the [[ID3]] equivalent [[iTunes]] uses to store [[metadata]]. [[MPEG-4 Part 2]] and [[H.263]] will not be supported in F4V file format. Adobe also announced that they will be gradually moving away from the FLV format to the standard ISO base media file format ([[MPEG-4 Part 12]]) owing to functional limits with the FLV structure when streaming H.264. The final release of the Flash Player supporting some parts of MPEG-4 standards had become available in Fall 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200708/082107FlashPlayer.html |title=Adobe Press release on MPEG-4 support in Flash Player 9 |publisher=Adobe.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref> Adobe Flash Player 10.1 does not support acoustic echo cancellation, unlike the VoIP offerings of Skype and Google Voice. This makes Flash less suitable for group calling or meetings, as use of headphones for all participants is essential, or at least highly advised. ===Scripting language=== {{See|ActionScript}} ===Proprietary restrictions=== {{See also|Proprietary software}} The [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] nature of Flash has been a concern to advocates of [[open standard]]s and [[free software]]. Its widespread use has, according to such observers, harmed the otherwise open nature of the [[World Wide Web]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.zdnet.com/2424-3515_22-199508.html |title=Mozilla warns of Flash and Silverlight 'agenda' |last=Meyer|first=David |publisher=[[ZDNet]] |date=2008-04-30 |accessdate=2009-01-11 |quote= ''Companies building websites should beware of proprietary rich-media technologies like Adobe's Flash and Microsoft's Silverlight, the founder of Mozilla Europe has warned.''}}</ref> A response may be seen in [[#Open Screen Project|Adobe's Open Screen Project]]: Adobe's restrictions on the use of the SWF/FLV specifications have been lifted. Representing open standards, inventor of [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] and co-author of [[HTML5]], [[Håkon Wium Lie]] explained in a [[AtGoogleTalks|Google tech talk]] entitled "the <video> element" the proposal of [[Theora]] as the format for [[HTML5 video]]:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5545573096553082541&ei=LV6hSaz0JpbA2AKh4OyPDg&hl=un |title=Håkon Wium Lie on the video element in HTML 5 |accessdate=2009-02-22 |publisher=Google Video |date=2007-03-29}}</ref> <blockquote>I believe very strongly, that we need to agree on some kind of baseline video format if [the video element] is going to succeed. Flash is today the baseline format on the web. The problem with Flash is that it's not an open standard.</blockquote> ===Disclosure=== In October 1998, Macromedia disclosed the Flash Version 3 Specification to the world on its website. It did this in response to many new and often semi-open formats competing with SWF, such as Xara's [[Xara Flare|Flare]] and Sharp's [[Extended Vector Animation]] formats. Several developers quickly created a [[C (programming language)|C]] [[C library|library]] for producing SWF. In February 1999, the company introduced [[MorphInk]] 99, the first third-party program to create SWF files. Macromedia also hired [[Middlesoft]] to create a freely available [[development kit|developers' kit]] for the SWF file format versions 3 to 5. Macromedia made the Flash Files specifications for versions 6 and later available only under a [[non-disclosure agreement]], but they are widely available from various sites. In April 2006, the Flash SWF file format specification was released with details on the then newest version format (Flash 8). Although still lacking specific information on the incorporated video compression formats (On2, Sorenson Spark, etc.), this new documentation covered all the new features offered in Flash v8 including new ActionScript commands, expressive filter controls, and so on. The file format specification document is offered only to developers who agree to a license agreement that permits them to use the specifications only to develop programs that can export to the Flash file format. The license forbids the use of the specifications to create programs that can be used for playback of Flash files. The Flash 9 specification was made available under similar restrictions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/licensing/developer/fileformat/faq/ |title=Adobe File Format Specification FAQ |accessdate=2007-11-15 |publisher=Adobe Systems |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071111094129/http://www.adobe.com/licensing/developer/fileformat/faq/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-11-11}}</ref> In June 2009, Adobe launched the [[Open Screen Project]] ([http://www.adobe.com/openscreenproject/faq/ Adobe link]), which made the SWF specification available without restrictions. Previously, developers could not use the specification for making SWF-compatible players, but only for making SWF-exporting authoring software. The specification still omits information on codecs such as [[Sorenson codec|Sorenson Spark]], however.<ref>{{cite web| title = Free Flash community reacts to Adobe Open Screen Project | url = http://www.openmedianow.org/?q=node/21 | accessdate = 2008-11-29 }}</ref> ==Authoring tools== ===Adobe Flash Professional=== <!-- Note: Several articles
