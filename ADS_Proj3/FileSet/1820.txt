the Presidents of the Congress after 1782, probably to seal envelopes on correspondence sent to the Congress, though only examples from [[Thomas Mifflin]] are documented.<ref name="eagleshield"/><ref name="totten"/><ref name="lossing1856"/> This seal's use apparently did not pass over to the new government in 1789. Today's [[Seal of the President of the United States]], which developed by custom over a long period before being defined in law, is a more full-featured version of the Great Seal. ===Masi Treaty-Seal die of 1825=== [[File:Masi treaty seal Lewis impression.jpg|thumb|150px|Drawing made from Lewis mold]] Starting with the ratification of the [[Treaty of Ghent]], the United States began to use pendant seals on treaties, where the seal is impressed onto a separate wax disc and attached to the document with cords. Although the reverse side of the seal was designed for this purpose, a die was still not made but rather the obverse was impressed on one side only using the regular die. However, this did not conform to the European tradition of using much larger seals for treaties. To address this, Seraphim Masi of Washington D.C. was asked to design a larger seal specifically for treaties.<ref name="statepub"/> Masi produced a quite different design, showing a much more realistic (and uncrested) eagle, turned somewhat to the side. He also added fruits to the olive branch, changed the shape of the shield, and depicted the crest differently (though using the same arrangement of six-pointed stars). It was 4 11/16 inches in diameter. [[File:MasiTreatySealSkippet.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Skippet made by Masi's company]] These seals were transported in metallic boxes called skippets, which protected the actual wax seal from damage. The skippets themselves also were engraved with the seal design. Several skippets were made at a time, which the State Department used as needed. Usually skippets were made out of [[sterling silver]], though for the Japanese [[Convention of Kanagawa|treaty]] following [[Matthew C. Perry|Commodore Perry]]'s mission a golden box was used (the ratification of that treaty, made later in 1854, had an even more elaborate and expensive seal and heavy gold skippet).<ref name="eagleshield"/><ref name="totten"/> The Masi treaty die was used until 1871, almost exclusively for treaties, at which point the U.S. government discontinued the use of pendant seals. The die is also currently on display at the National Archives.<ref name="statepub"/> Masi's company made most of the skippets for almost twenty years, after which the State Department switched to nearly identical versions made by Samuel Lewis. At least one 1871 treaty seal was actually made using a Lewis skippet mold instead of the Masi die, meaning it too is technically an official die.<ref name="eagleshield"/> ===1841 die=== {{double image|right|1841USGreatSealDie.jpg|130|1841 US Great Seal die.jpg|130|1841 die (left) and 1866 counterdie}} Over time, the original seal became worn and needed to be replaced. John Peter Van Ness Throop of Washington D.C. engraved a new die in 1841, which is also sometimes known as the "illegal seal" because only six arrows are shown rather than the required thirteen. Throop also chose to use five pointed stars, though kept the six-pointed star arrangement, a change which has continued in all subsequent dies. Other changes include a more vigorous and uncrested eagle, the removal of the acanthus leaves, a general crowding of the design upwards, a different shape to the shield, and fruit on the olive branch (four olives).<ref name="statepub"/> The seal was 2 1/8 inches in diameter. In 1866 the first counterdie was made, which is the same design in opposite relief. The paper was placed in between the die and counterdie, resulting in a sharper impression in the paper than from one die alone. The use of counterdies continues to this day.<ref name="statepub"/> ===1877 die=== [[File:US Great Seal 1877 drawing.png|130px|thumb|1877 die design]] The [[United States Centennial]] in 1876 had renewed interest in national symbols, and articles appeared noting the irregularities in the 1841 seal.<ref name="statepub"/> However, when it came time to replace the worn 1841 die, the Department of State kept with the same design. The new die was engraved by Herman Baumgarten of Washington, D.C. His version followed the 1841 die very closely, including the errors, and was the same size. The most notable differences were slightly larger stars and lettering. The workmanship on the die was relatively poor, with no impression being very clear, and it is considered the poorest of all Great Seal dies.<ref name="statepub"/><ref name="eagleshield"/><ref name="totten"/> Ironically, it was the one in use during the seal's centennial in 1882. ===1885 die=== [[File:USGreatSealGrahamLithograph.jpg|thumb|Lithograph of 1885 design]] By early 1881 the State Department started responding to criticism of the seal,<ref name="statepub"/> resulting first in an 1882 centennial commemorative coin, and then with [[Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen|Secretary of State Frederick Frelinghuysen]] asking for funds to create a new design and dies of both the obverse and reverse on January 11, 1884, after getting estimates of the cost. Congress eventually appropriated $1,000 for those purposes on July 7, 1884.<ref name="eagleshield"/><ref name="hunt1909"/> The design contract went to [[Tiffany & Co.]]<ref name="statepub"/> Theodore F. Dwight, Chief of the Bureau of Rolls and Library of the Department of State, supervised the process. He brought in several consultants to consider a design from historical, heraldric, and artistic points of view. These included [[Justin Winsor]], an historical scholar, [[Charles Eliot Norton]], a [[Harvard University|Harvard]] professor, William H. Whitmore, author of ''Elements of Heraldry'', John Denison Chaplin, Jr., an expert on engraving and associate editor of ''American Cyclop√¶dia'', the sculptor [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]], and even the botanist [[Asa Gray]] to help with the olive branch.<ref name="eagleshield"/><ref name="hunt1909"/><ref name="ahart"/> Tiffany's chief designer, James Horton Whitehouse, was the artist responsible for the actual design.<ref name="statepub"/> [[File:1885 US Great Seal die.jpg|thumb|left|140px|1885 die]] On December 13, 1884, following much research and discussion amongst the group, Whitehouse submitted his designs. The result was a much more formal and heraldic look, completely different than previous dies, and has remained essentially unchanged since. The eagle is a great deal more robust, and clutches the olive branch and arrows from behind. The 13 arrows were restored, in accordance with the original law, and the olive branch was depicted
