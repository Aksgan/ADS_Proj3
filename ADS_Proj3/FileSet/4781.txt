In his post, Olandres agreed that the Filipino-based service would be useless and redundant unless it "''came up with its own set of content''".<ref name="Yuga20070815">{{cite web | last =Olandres | first =Abraham | authorlink =Abraham Olandres | title =Rainy Day Friday Round-up | work =Blogosphere | publisher =YugaTech: Philippine Technology News and Reviews | date =2007-08-15 | url =http://www.yugatech.com/blog/blogosphere/rainy-day-friday-round-up/ | accessdate = 2007-08-27 }}</ref> In a later entry, Olandres pointed out that WikiPilipinas' lack of a notability guideline could possibly slant it towards a Filipino-centric sense of pseudo-notability.<ref name="Yuga20070831">{{cite web | last =Olandres | first =Abe | authorlink =Abe Olandres | title =Will WikiPilipinas redefine what is notable? | work =Daily Dose | publisher =YugaTech: Philippine Technology News and Reviews | date =2007-08-31 | url =http://www.yugatech.com/blog/daily-dose/will-wikipilipinas-redefine-what-is-notable/ | accessdate =2007-09-01}}</ref> Kristine Mandigma, the president of the Philippine [[literacy]] [[advocacy]] group Read-or-Die Foundation, also made a commentary on WikiPilipinas after attending the service's August 22 official press launch.
