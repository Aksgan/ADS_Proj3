Berkeley, where he currently leads the Algorithms Group. Richard Karp was awarded the [[National Medal of Science]], and was the recipient of the Harvey Prize of the [[Technion]] and the 2004 [[Franklin Institute#The Benjamin Franklin Awards|Benjamin Franklin Medal]] in Computer and Cognitive Science for his insights into [[computational complexity]]. In 1994 he was inducted as a [[Fellow]] of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]. He is the recipient of several honorary degrees. == Work == He has made many other important discoveries in computer science and [[operations research]] in the area of [[Combinatorial optimization|combinatorial algorithm]]s. His major current research interests include [[bioinformatics]]. In 1971 he co-developed with [[Jack Edmonds]] the [[Edmonds–Karp algorithm]] for solving the max-flow problem on networks, and in 1972 he published a landmark paper in complexity theory, "Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems", in which he proved [[Karp's 21 NP-complete problems|21 Problems to be NP-complete]].<ref>{{cite book | author = Richard M. Karp | chapter = [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~luca/cs172/karp.pdf Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems] | title = Complexity of Computer Computations | editor = R. E. Miller and J. W. Thatcher (editors) | publisher = New York: Plenum | pages = 85&ndash;103 | year = 1972}}</ref> In 1973 he and [[John Hopcroft]] published the [[Hopcroft–Karp algorithm]], still the fastest known method for finding maximum cardinality [[Matching (graph theory)|matchings]] in [[bipartite graph]]s. In 1980, along with [[Richard J. Lipton]], Karp proved the [[Karp-Lipton theorem]] (which proves that, if [[Boolean satisfiability problem|SAT]] can be solved by [[Boolean circuit]]s with a polynomial number of [[logic gate]]s, then the [[polynomial hierarchy]] collapses to its second level). In 1987 he co-developed with [[Michael O. Rabin]] the [[Rabin-Karp string search algorithm]]. === Turing Award === His citation<ref> {{cite web |url=http://awards.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3256708&srt=all&aw=140&ao=AMTURING&yr=1985 |title=ACM Award Citation/Richard M.

Karp introduced the now standard methodology for proving problems to be NP-complete which has led to the identification of many theoretical and practical problems as being computationally difficult.'' == References == <references/> ==External links== {{Commonscat|Richard Karp}} * [http://www.acm.org/crossroads/dayinlife/bios/richard_karp.html ACM Crossroads magazine interview/bio of Richard Karp] * [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/People/Faculty/Homepages/karp.html Karp's Home Page at Berkeley] {{start box}} {{succession box | before=[[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] | title=Benjamin Franklin Medal in Computer and Cognitive Science | after=[[Aravind Joshi]] | years=2004}} {{end box}} {{EATCS Award laureates}} {{Turing award}} {{Winners of the National Medal of Science|math-stat-comp}} <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]] --> {{Persondata |NAME= Karp, Richard Manning |ALTERNATIVE NAMES= |SHORT DESCRIPTION= American computer scientist |DATE OF BIRTH= 1935 |PLACE OF BIRTH= [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] |DATE OF DEATH= |PLACE OF DEATH= }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Karp, Richard}} [[Category:1935 births]] [[Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:Computer pioneers]] [[Category:Jewish scientists]] [[Category:American computer scientists]] [[Category:American mathematicians]] [[Category:Turing Award laureates]] [[Category:John von Neumann Theory Prize winners]] [[Category:National Medal of Science laureates]] [[Category:Harvard Centennial Medal recipients]] [[Category:Harvard University alumni]] [[Category:University of California, Berkeley faculty]] [[Category:Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery]] [[Category:Operations researchers]] [[Category:Members of the French Academy of Sciences]] [[Category:People from Boston, Massachusetts]] [[Category:Theoretical computer scientists]] [[Category:Fellows of Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] [[bn:রিচার্ড কার্প]] [[de:Richard M.

Gabriel</title> <text>'''Richard P. Gabriel''' (born 1949) is a noted expert on the [[Lisp programming language]] (and especially [[Common Lisp]]) in computing. He is primarily known for his 1990 essay “Lisp: Good News, Bad News, How to Win Big”, which popularized the phrase [[Worse is Better]], and his set of Lisp [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmarks]] (the "Gabriel Benchmarks"), published in 1985 as ''Performance and evaluation of Lisp systems'', which became the standard way of benchmarking Lisp implementations. ==Biography== He was born in 1949, in the town of [[Merrimac, Massachusetts|Merrimac]] in northeastern [[Massachusetts]] to two dairy farmers. He was nearly accepted to [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and [[Harvard University|Harvard]], but an argument with a teacher ended those prospects, and he ended up going to [[Northeastern University, Boston|Northeastern University]], where he earned a B. A. in [[Mathematics]] (1967–1972). Subsequently, he pursued graduate studies in mathematics at MIT, from 1972–73; he was tapped by Patrick Winston to become a permanent member of the AI Lab at MIT, but funding difficulties made it impossible to retain him. Gabriel tried to start up, with Dave Waltz, an AI Lab at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]], but after two years the lab fell through due to general apathy{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}. Gabriel did in this time period manage to earn an MS in Mathematics however (1973–1975). On the strength of some of his mathematical work, Gabriel was then admitted to [[Stanford University]]; during that period (1975–1981), he served as a Teacher's Assistant to [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]], the founder of Lisp; he ported [[Maclisp]] from its native [[Incompatible Timesharing System|ITS]] to [[WAITS]]; he earned a PhD. in [[Computer science|Computer Science]] (on the topic of natural language generation); and he and his wife Kathy had a son. Around this time period, he became a spokesperson for the [[League for Programming Freedom]]. After he earned the PhD, he continued to work on [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] projects for McCarthy, although his thesis advisor was [[Terry Winograd]]. He eventually began working for [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|Lawrence Livermore National Labs]], where he recruited a number of the brightest researchers and programmers for a company he founded in 1984 (and would leave in 1992), and would survive until 1994, [[Lucid Inc.|Lucid, Incorporated]]. Gabriel was at various times the President and Chairman of Lucid Inc. The product the company shipped was an integrated Lisp [[Integrated development environment|IDE]] for [[Sun Microsystems]]’ [[RISC]] hardware architecture. This sidestepped the principal failure of [[Lisp machine]]s by, in essence,
