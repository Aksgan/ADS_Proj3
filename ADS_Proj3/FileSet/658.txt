See under "[[#TOL|Topics of Logic]]". ===Articles by Peirce, published in his lifetime=== This list includes mainly published philosophical and logical works of some note. Papers by Peirce in many fields were published and he wrote over 300 reviews for ''The Nation''. Sometimes an article below is shown after a special series, but was published during the series. Also note a complicating fact of Peirce scholarship, that Peirce sometimes made significant later corrections, modifications, and comments, for which one needs to consult such works as CP, W, EP, and the (online) ''{{sic|hide=y|Commens}} Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.
