The term also refers to the interaction between society's complex infrastructures and human behaviour. In this sense, society itself, and most of its substructures, are complex sociotechnical systems. The term sociotechnical systems was coined in the 1960s by [[Eric Trist]] and [[Fred Emery]], who were working as consultants at the [[Tavistock Institute]] in [[London]]. Sociotechnical systems theory is theory about the social aspects of [[people]] and [[society]] and technical aspects of organizational structure and processes. Here, technical does not imply technology. "Technical" was a term used in those times to refer to structure and a broader sense of technicalities. Sociotechnical refers to the interrelatedness of ''social'' and ''technical'' aspects of an [[organisation]]. Sociotechnical theory therefore is about ''joint optimization'', with a shared emphasis on achievement of both excellence in technical performance and quality in people's work lives. Sociotechnical theory, as distinct from sociotechnical systems, proposes a number of different ways of achieving joint optimisation. They are usually based on designing different kinds of organisation, ones in which the relationships between socio and technical elements lead to the emergence of productivity and wellbeing. ==Overview== Sociotechnical refers to the interrelatedness of ''social'' and ''technical'' aspects of an [[organization]]. Sociotechnical theory is founded on two main principles: * One is that the [[Social interaction|interaction]] of social and technical factors creates the conditions for successful (or unsuccessful) organizational [[performance]]. This interaction consists partly of [[linear]] ‘cause and effect’ relationships (the relationships that are normally ‘designed’) and partly from ‘[[non-linear]]’, [[Complexity|complex]], even unpredictable relationships (the good or bad relationships that are often unexpected). Whether designed or not, both types of interaction occur when socio and technical elements are put to work. * The corollary of this, and the second of the two main principles, is that optimization of each aspect alone (socio or technical) tends to increase not only the quantity of unpredictable, ‘un-designed’ relationships, but those relationships that are injurious to the system’s performance. Therefore sociotechnical theory is about ''joint optimization''. Sociotechnical theory, as distinct from sociotechnical systems, proposes a number of different ways of achieving joint optimization. They are usually based on designing different kinds of organization, ones in which the relationships between socio and technical elements lead to the emergence of productivity and wellbeing, rather than the all too often case of new technology failing to meet the expectations of designers and users alike. The scientific literature shows terms like ''sociotechnical'' all one word, or ''sociotechnical'' with a hyphen, ''sociotechnical theory'', ''sociotechnical system'' and ''sociotechnical systems theory''. All of these terms appear ubiquitously but their actual meanings often remain unclear. The key term 'sociotechnical' is something of a [[buzzword]] and its varied usage can be unpicked. What can be said about it, though, is that it is most often used to simply, and quite correctly, describe any kind of organization that is composed of people and technology. But, predictably, there is more to it than that. ==Principles== Some of the central principles of sociotechnical theory were elaborated in a seminal paper by [[Eric Trist]] and [[Ken Bamforth]] in 1951. This is an interesting case study which, like most of the work in sociotechnical theory, is focused on a form of ‘production system’ expressive of the era and the contemporary technological systems it contained. The study was based on the paradoxical observation that despite improved technology, productivity was falling, and that despite better pay and amenities, absenteeism was increasing. This particular rational organisation had become irrational. The cause of the problem was hypothesized to be the adoption of a new form of production technology which had created the need for a bureaucratic form of organization (rather like classic command-and-control). In this specific example, technology brought with it a retrograde step in organizational design terms. The analysis that followed introduced the terms ‘socio’ and ‘technical’ and elaborated on many of the core principles that sociotechnical theory subsequently became. ===Responsible autonomy=== Sociotechnical theory was pioneering for its shift in emphasis, a shift towards considering teams or groups as the primary unit of analysis and not the individual. Sociotechnical theory pays particular attention to internal supervision and leadership at the level of the ‘group’ and refers to it as ‘responsible autonomy’<ref name="ET51p6-9">[[Eric Trist]] & K. Bamforth (1951). ''Some social and psychological consequences of the longwall method of coal getting'', in: Human Relations, 4, pp.3-38. p.7-9.</ref> The overriding point seems to be that having the simple ability of individual team members being able to perform their function is not the only predictor of combat effectiveness. There are a range of issues in team cohesion research, for example, that are answered by having the regulation and leadership internal to a group or team <ref>Siebold, G. L. (1991). "The evolution of the measurement of cohesion". In: ''Military Psychology'', 11(1), 5-26.</ref>. These, and other factors, play an integral and parallel role in ensuring successful teamwork which sociotechnical theory exploits. The idea of semi-autonomous groups conveys a number of further advantages. Not least among these, especially in hazardous environments, is the often felt need on the part of people in the organisation for a role in a small primary group. It is argued that such a need arises in cases where the means for effective communication are often somewhat limited. As Carvalho <ref>P.V.R. Carvalho (2006).
