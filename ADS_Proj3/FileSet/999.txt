A similar coding system was used for weather reports from U-boats, the ''Wetterkurzschluessel'', (Weather Short Code Book). A copy of this had been captured from [[German submarine U-559|U-559]] on 29 or 30 October 1942.<ref>Budiansky (2000) pp. 341-343</ref> These short signals had been used for deciphering 3-rotor Enigma messages and it was discovered that the new rotor had a neutral position at which it, and its matching reflector, behaved just like a 3-rotor Enigma reflector. This allowed messages enciphered at this neutral position to be deciphered by a 3-rotor machine, and hence deciphered by a standard bombe. Deciphered Short Signals provided good material for bombe menus for Shark.<ref>Mahon (1945) p. 64</ref> ===American ''bombes''=== {{Further|[[Bombe#|US Navy Bombe]] and [[Bombe#|US Army Bombe]]}} Unlike the situation at Bletchley Park, the United States armed services did not share a combined cryptanalytical service. Before the US joined the war, there was collaboration with Britain, albeit with a considerable amount of caution on Britain's side because of the extreme importance of Germany and her allies not learning that its codes were being broken. Despite some worthwhile collaboration amongst the cryptanalysts, their superiors took some time to achieve a trusting relationship in which both British and American bombes were used to mutual benefit. In February 1941, Captain Abe Sinkov and Lieutenant Leo Rosen of the US Army, and US naval Lieutenants Robert Weeks and Prescott Currier, arrived at Bletchley Park bringing, amongst other things, a replica of the [[Purple (cipher machine)|'Purple' cipher machine]] for the Bletchley Park's Japanese section in [[Hut 7]].<ref>Budiansky (2000) p. 176</ref> The four returned to America after ten weeks, with a naval radio [[direction finding]] unit and many documents<ref>Budiansky (2000) p. 179</ref> including a "paper Enigma".<ref>Jacobsen (2000)</ref> The main American response to the 4-rotor Enigma was the US Navy bombe, which was manufactured in much less constrained facilities than were available in wartime Britain. Colonel [[John Tiltman]], who later became Deputy Director at Bletchley Park, visited the US Navy cryptanalysis office ([[OP-20-G]]) in April 1942 and recognised America's vital interest in deciphering U-boat traffic. The urgent need, doubts about the British engineering workload and slow progress, prompted the US to start investigating designs for a Navy bombe, based on the full [[Blueprint|blueprints]] and wiring diagrams received by US naval Lieutenants Robert Ely and Joseph Eachus at Bletchley Park in July 1942.<ref>Budiansky (2000) p. 238</ref><ref>Wilcox (2001) p. 21</ref> Funding for a full, $2 million, Navy development effort was requested on 3 September 1942 and approved the following day. [[Image:US-bombe.jpg|thumb|US Navy bombe. It contained 16 four-rotor Enigma-equivalents and was much faster than the British bombe.]] Commander [[Edward Travis]], Deputy Director and [[Francis Birch (cryptographer)|Frank Birch]], Head of the German Naval Section travelled from Bletchley Park to Washington in September 1942. With [[Carl Frederick Holden]], US Director of Naval Communications they established, on 2 October 1942, a UK:US accord which may have "a stronger claim than [[1943 BRUSA Agreement|BRUSA]] to being the forerunner of the [[UK–USA Security Agreement|UKUSA Agreement]]," being the first agreement "to establish the special [[Signals intelligence|Sigint]] relationship between the two countries," and "it set the pattern for UKUSA, in that the United States was very much the senior partner in the alliance."<ref>{{Citation | last = Erskine | first = Ralph | title = The Holden Agreement on Naval Sigint: The First BRUSA? | journal = Intelligence and National Security | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–197 | year = 1999 | month = Summer | url = http://intellit.muskingum.edu/alpha_folder/E_folder/erskine_a-o.html }}</ref> It established a relationship of "full collaboration" between Bletchley Park and OP-20-G.<ref>Budiansky (2000) p. 239</ref> An all electronic solution to the problem of a fast bombe was considered,<ref>Budiansky (2000) p. 241</ref> but rejected for pragmatic reasons, and a contract was let with the [[NCR Corporation|National Cash Register Corporation]] (NCR) in [[Dayton, Ohio]]. This established the [[United States Naval Computing Machine Laboratory]]. Engineering development was led by NCR's [[Joseph Desch]]. [[Alan Turing]], who had written a memorandum to OP-20-G (probably in 1941),<ref>Turing (''c.''1941) pp. 341–352</ref> was seconded to the British Joint Staff Mission in Washington in December 1942, because of his exceptionally wide knowledge about the bombes and the methods of their use. He was asked to look at the bombes that were being built by NCR and at the security of certain speech cipher equipment under development at Bell Labs.<ref>{{Citation | title = Bletchley Park Text: November 1942: Departure of Alan Turing from BP | url = http://cipherweb.open.ac.uk/cgi-bin/cipher-demo/mobile/sms_categories_xml.py? | accessdate = 16 April 2010 }}</ref> He visited OP-20-G, and went to NCR in Dayton on the 21 December. He was able to show that it was not necessary to build 336 Bombes, one for each possible rotor order, by utilising techniques such as [[Banburismus]].<ref>Budiansky (2000) p. 242</ref> The initial order was scaled down to 96 machines. The US Navy bombes used drums for the Enigma rotors in much the same way as the British bombes, but were very much faster. The first machine was completed and tested on 3 May 1943. Soon, these bombes were more available than the British bombes at Bletchley Park and its outstations, and as a consequence they were put to use for Hut 6 as well as Hut 8 work.<ref Name=WelchmanP135 >Welchman (1984) p. 135</ref> A total of 121 Navy bombes were produced.<ref name=WengerWilcoxP52 /> In Alexander's "Cryptographic History of Work on German Naval Enigma", he wrote as follows. {{blockquote|When the Americans began to turn out bombes in large numbers there was a constant interchange of signal - cribs, keys, message texts, cryptographic chat and so on.
