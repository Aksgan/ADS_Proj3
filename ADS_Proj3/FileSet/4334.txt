As database and microprocessor architectures change, so must the benchmarks that are employed to measure the combined performance of these critical components. While other [[Standardization|industry standard]] throughput workloads already exist, none was designed specifically to exercise the relationship between in-memory [[Database management system|database software]] and the memory processing subsystem in which it transacts. The Telecommunication Application [[Transaction processing|Transaction Processing]] (TATP) Benchmark is a new [[open source]] workload designed specifically for [[high-throughput]] applications, well suited for in-memory database [[performance analysis]] and system comparison. The TATP benchmark simulates a typical [[Network Switching Subsystem|Home Location Register]] (HLR) database used by a mobile carrier. The HLR is an application [[Mobile phone|mobile network]] operators use to store all relevant information about valid subscribers, including the mobile [[Telephone number|phone number]], the services to which they have subscribed, access privileges, and the current location of the subscriber's handset. Every call to and from a mobile phone involves look ups against the HLRs of both parties, making it is a perfect example of a demanding, high-throughput environment where the workloads are pertinent to all applications requiring extreme speed: telecommunications, [[financial services]], gaming, event processing and alerting, reservation systems, [[Software as a Service|software as a service]] (SaaS), and so on. The benchmark generates a flooding load on a [[database server]]. This means that the load is generated up to the maximum throughput point that the server can sustain. The load is generated by issuing pre-defined transactions run against a specified target database. The target [[database schema]] is made to resemble a typical HLR database in a [[Cellular network|mobile phone network]]. The algorithm of what is known as the TATP Benchmark was originally published in a Master's Thesis <ref>Toni Strandell: "Open Source Database Systems: Systems study, Performance and Scalability". Master's Thesis, [[University of Helsinki]], Department of [[Computer science|Computer Science]], May 2003, 54 p, at: http://ethesis.helsinki.fi/julkaisut/mat/tieto/pg/strandell/. </ref>. The benchmark was modeled after a real test program that was used by a telecom equipment manufacturer to evaluate the applicability of various [[relational database]] systems to service control programming in mobile networks. Another derivative of the original test is the Network Database Benchmark <ref>"Network Database Benchmark", an open-source project, at: http://sourceforge.net/projects/ndbb/</ref>. TATP executes seven pre-defined transactions that insert, update, delete and query the data in the database. The TATP results show Mean Qualified Throughput (MQTh) of the target database system, and the [[response time]] distributions per transaction types for all seven types of transactions. ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== * SourceForge.net: [http://tatpbenchmark.sourceforge.net/ Telecommunication Application Transaction Processing (TATP) Benchmark] * [http://download.intel.com/business/software/testimonials/downloads/xeon5500/ibm.pdf IBM solidDB on Intel Xeon 5500 - doubling database performance] * Antoni Wolski and Vilho Raatikka: "[http://fp.client.kotisivut.com/awolski/sol-pub/awo-vraa-isas06.pdf Performance Measurement and Tuning of Hot-Standby Databases]", Third International Service Availability Symposium (ISAS 2006), May 15–16, 2006, Helsinki, Finland.

It has subsequently been revised in 1974, 1983, 1988 and 2002.<ref>[http://www.inece.org/1stvol2/Ubing%20&%20Krop.htm History of the TA Luft]</ref> Parts of the TA Luft have been adopted by other countries as well. In 1974, 10 years after the TA Luft was first established, the [[German government]] enacted the "Federal Air Pollution Control Act" (Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz). It also has subsequently been amended a number of times, the last of which was in 2002.<ref>[http://www.bmu.de/files/pdfs/allgemein/application/pdf/bimschengl.pdf Complete text of the Federal Air Pollution Control Act]</ref> Although the first version of the TA Luft existed 10 years before the enactment of the "Federal Air Pollution Control Act", it is often called the "First General Administrative Regulation" pertaining to the "Federal Air Pollution Control Act". The German government created the Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and [[Nuclear safety|Nuclear Safety]] (Bundesministerium für Umwelt, Naturschutz und Reaktorsicherheit) in June, 1986<ref>[http://www.bmu.de/english/the_ministry/tasks/the_ministry/doc/3261.php Web site of the Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety]</ref> and it is now responsible for implementing the TA Luft regulation under the "Federal Air Pollution Control Act". ==Overview of the TA Luft== The TA Luft is a comprehensive air pollution control regulation that includes: * A discussion of the scope of the TA Luft application which is to review applications for licenses to construct and operate new industrial facilities (or altered existing facilities) and to determine whether the proposed new or altered facilities will comply with the requirements of the TA Luft and the requirements of other air pollutant emission regulations promulgated under the Federal Air Pollution Control Act. * Air pollutant emission limits for [[dust]], [[sulfur dioxide]], [[nitrogen oxides]], [[hydrofluoric acid]] and other gaseous [[inorganic]] [[fluorine]] compounds, [[arsenic]] and inorganic arsenic compounds, [[lead]] and inorganic lead compounds, [[cadmium]] and inorganic cadmium compounds, [[nickel]] and inorganic nickel compounds, [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and inorganic mercury compounds, [[thallium]] and inorganic thallium compounds, [[ammonia]] from farming and livestock breeding operations, inorganic gases and [[particulates]], [[Organic chemistry|organic]] substances and others. * Emission limits may also be set for hazardous, toxic, carcinogenic or mutagenic substances as part of the TA Luft review procedures. * Other limits or requirements related to stack heights (for flue gases or other process vents) and for storing, loading or working with liquid or solid substances. * Various requirements for sampling measuring and monitoring emissions. * Listing of the industries subject to the requirements of the TA Luft, such as [[mining]], [[power plant|electric power generation]], [[glass]] and ceramics, [[steel]], [[aluminum]] and other metals, [[chemical plant]]s, [[oil refinery|oil refining]], plastics, food, and others. *Annex 3 is devoted to guidelines on: how the [[atmospheric dispersion modeling]] required during the
