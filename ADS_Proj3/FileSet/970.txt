and [[mythology]], and considers the dominance of science in society [[authoritarian]] and unjustified.<ref name="contra"/> He also contended (along with [[Imre Lakatos]]) that the [[demarcation problem]] of distinguishing science from [[pseudoscience]] on objective grounds is not possible and thus fatal to the notion of science running according to fixed, universal rules.<ref name="contra"/> Feyerabend also criticized science for not having evidence for its own philosophical precepts. Particularly the notion of Uniformity of Law and the Uniformity of Process across time and space, as noted by [[Steven Jay Gould]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Gould | first = Stephen J | title = [[Time's Arrow, Time's Cycle]]: Myth and Metaphor in the Discovery of Geological Time | publisher = Harvard University Press | year = 1987 | location = Cambridge, MA | pages = 120 | isbn = 0674891988}}</ref> "We have to realize that a unified theory of the physical world simply does not exist" says Feyerabend, "We have theories that work in restricted regions, we have purely formal attempts to condense them into a single formula, we have lots of unfounded claims (such as the claim that all of chemistry can be reduced to physics), phenomena that do not fit into the accepted framework are suppressed; in physics, which many scientists regard as the one really basic science, we have now at least three different points of view...without a promise of conceptual (and not only formal) unification".<ref>{{cite book | isbn = 0860911845 | title = Farewell To Reason| page = 100 | publisher = Verso | last = Feyerabend | first = Paul | year = 1987 | authorlink = Paul Feyerabend}}</ref> In other words, science is [[begging the question]] when it presupposes that there is a universal truth with no proof thereof. Professor [[Stanley Aronowitz]] scrutinizes science for operating with the presumption that the only acceptable criticisms of science are those conducted within the methodological framework that science has set up for itself. That science insists that only those who have been inducted into its community, through means of training and credentials, are qualified to make these criticisms.<ref>{{cite book | isbn = 0816616590 | title = Science As Power: Discourse and Ideology in Modern Society | page = viii (preface) | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | last = Aronowitz | first = Stanley | year = 1988 | authorlink = Stanley Aronowitz}}</ref> Aronowitz also alleges that while scientists consider it absurd that [[Fundamentalist Christianity]] uses biblical references to bolster their claim that the bible is true, scientists pull the same tactic by using the tools of science to settle disputes concerning its own validity.<ref>Stanley Aronowitz in conversation with Derrick Jensen in {{cite book | isbn = 1931498520 | title = Welcome to the Machine: Science, Surveillance, and the Culture of Control | page = 31 | publisher = Chelsea Green Publishing Company | last = Jensen | first = Derrick | year = 2004 | authorlink = Derrick Jensen}}</ref> Philosopher [[Alan Watts]] criticized science for operating under a materialist model of the world that he posited is simply a modified version of the [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic worldview]], that "the universe is constructed and maintained by a Lawmaker" (commonly identified as [[God]] or the [[Logos]]). Watts asserts that during the rise of secularism through the 18th to 20th century when scientific philosophers got rid of the notion of a lawmaker they kept the notion of law, and that the idea that the world is a material machine run by law is a presumption just as unscientific as religious doctrines that affirm it is a material machine made and run by a lawmaker.<ref>Alan Watts Audio lecture "Myth and Religion: Image of Man" and "Out Of Your Mind, 1: The Nature of Consciousness: 'Our image of the world' and 'The myth of the automatic universe'"</ref> ===Epistemology=== David Parkin compared the [[epistemology|epistemological]] stance of science to that of [[divination]].<ref>{{harvnb|Parkin|1991}} "Simultaneity and Sequencing in the Oracular Speech of Kenyan Diviners", p. 185.</ref> He suggested that, to the degree that divination is an epistemologically specific means of gaining insight into a given question, science itself can be considered a form of divination that is framed from a Western view of the nature (and thus possible applications) of knowledge. [[Philosopher]] and [[polymath]] [[Robert Anton Wilson]] stresses that the instruments used in scientific investigation produce meaningful answers relevant only to the instrument, and that there is no objective vantage point from which science could verify its findings since all findings are relative to begin with.<ref name="Anton Wilson 1999 4">{{cite book | isbn = 1-56184-002-5 | title = The New Inquisition | page = 4 | publisher = New Falcon Publications | last = Anton Wilson | first = Robert | year = 1999 | authorlink = Robert Anton Wilson}}</ref> The field of [[ecophenomenology]] disregards science and technology on ontological grounds, and calls for an openness to the "essential elements of human experience with the world".<ref>Stefanovic, 1994: 68</ref> It wants "to enter... into the sensorial present",<ref>Abram, 1996: 272</ref> and to "recover the moral sense of our humanity" by "recover[ing] first the moral sense of [[nature]]".<ref>Kohak, 1984: 13</ref> As an invocation to adopt "a kind of deliberate naivety through which it is possible to encounter a world unencumbered with presuppositions."<ref>ibid: 57</ref> Ecophenomenologists argue that the current environmental crisis is equally physical and [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]], and that a fundamental re-conceptualization of human relationships with the natural earth is necessary to help undo the damage done by a culture that takes part in utilitarian exploitation of the natural world. Its because of this that ecophenomenologists attempt to probe beneath western understandings of [[philosophy]], [[temporality]], and [[teleology]], as well as economic, social, and scientific evaluations of nature. ===Ethics=== Several academics have offered critiques concerning [[ethics]] in science. In ''Science and Ethics'', for example, the philosopher [[Bernard Rollin]] examines the relevance of ethics to science, and argues in favor of making education in ethics part and parcel of scientific training.<ref>{{cite book | first=Bernard E. | last=Rollin | year=2006 | title=Science and Ethics | publisher=Cambridge University Press
