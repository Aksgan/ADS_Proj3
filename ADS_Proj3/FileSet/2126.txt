Under the [[Meiji Constitution]], no one was permitted to use the Imperial Seal except the [[Emperor of Japan]], who used a 16 petal chrysanthemum with sixteen tips of another row of petals showing behind the first row. Therefore, each member of the Imperial family used a slightly modified version of the seal. [[Shinto]] shrines either displayed the imperial seal or incorporated elements of the seal into their own emblems. Earlier in Japanese history, when [[Emperor Go-Daigo]], who tried to break the power of the shogunate 1333, was exiled, he adopted the seventeen petal chrysanthemum to differentiate himself from his successor, Emperor Kōgon, who kept the emperial 16 petal ''mon''. The symbol is a yellow or orange [[chrysanthemum]] with black or red outlines and background. A central disc is surrounded by a front set of 16 petals. A rear set of 16 petals are half staggered in relation to the front set and are visible at the edges of the flower. An example of the chrysanthemum being used is in the badge for the [[Order of the Chrysanthemum]]. Other members of the [[Imperial House of Japan|Imperial Family]] use a version with 14 single petals, while a form with 16 single petals is used for [[Diet of Japan|Diet]] members' pins, orders, passports, etc. The Imperial Seal is also used on the standards of the imperial family.<ref>[http://www.cc.matsuyama-u.ac.jp/~tamura/kousitugiseirei.htm 皇室儀制令(1926(Taisho Era 15)皇室令第7号)]</ref> == References == {{reflist}} ==See also== *[[Chrysanthemum Throne]] *[[State Seal of Japan]] *[[Privy Seal of Japan]] *[[Order of the Chrysanthemum]] *[[List of Japanese flags]] *[[Government Seal of Japan]] *[[Kimi ga Yo]] *[[Flag of Japan]] {{JapanEmpireNavbox}} {{Coats of arms of Asia}} [[Category:Japanese monarchy]] [[Category:National coats of arms|Japan]] [[Category:National symbols of Japan]] [[Category:Seals (insignia)|Japan, Imperial Seal of]] [[Category:Empire of Japan]] {{Japan-gov-stub}} {{Heraldry-stub}} [[af:Keiserlike Seël van Japan]] [[ar:ختم إمبراطورية اليابان]] [[ast:Emblema de la flor de crisantemu]] [[bs:Grb Japana]] [[bg:Императорски печат на Япония]] [[ca:Segell Imperial del Japó]] [[cs:Císařská pečeť Japonska]] [[de:Nationales und Kaiserliches Siegel Japans]] [[et:Jaapani vapp]] [[el:Εθνόσημο της Ιαπωνίας]] [[es:Emblema de la flor de crisantemo]] [[fr:Sceau impérial du Japon]] [[gl:Escudo de Xapón]] [[ko:십육변팔중표국문]] [[hr:Grb Japana]] [[bpy:জাপানর চিনত্হান]] [[id:Lambang Negara dan Kekaisaran Jepang]] [[it:Stemma del Giappone]] [[he:סמל יפן]] [[krc:Японияны император мухуру]] [[ka:იაპონიის საიმპერატორო ბეჭედი]] [[lv:Japānas imperatora zīmogs]] [[lt:Imperatoriškasis Japonijos antspaudas]] [[hu:Japán címere]] [[nl:Japans Keizerlijk zegel]] [[ja:菊花紋章]] [[no:Japans riksvåpen]] [[pl:Herb Japonii]] [[pt:Selo Imperial do Japão]] [[ru:Императорская печать Японии]] [[sco:Imperial Seal o Japan]] [[sq:Stema - Japonia]] [[sr:Грб Јапана]] [[sh:Grb Japana]] [[fi:Japanin keisarillinen sinetti]] [[sv:Japans statsvapen]] [[th:ตราแผ่นดินของญี่ปุ่น]] [[tr:Japonya arması]] [[uk:Емблема Імператора Японії]] [[yo:Coat of arms of Japan]] [[zh:日本国徽]]</text> </page> <page> <id>18013</id> <title>Implicit certificate</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=February 2009}} In [[cryptography]], '''implicit certificates''' are a variant of [[public key certificate]], such that a public key can be reconstructed from any implicit certificate, and is said then to be ''implicitly'' verified, in the sense that the only party who can know the associated private key is the party identified in the implicit certificate. This does not rule out the possibility that nobody knows the private key, but this possibility is not considered a major problem. By comparison, traditional public-key certificates include a copy of the public key and the digital signature of the certification authority. Upon verification of the digital signature, the public key is ''explicitly'' verified, in the sense that the party identified in the certificate knows the associated private key and is the only party who can know the private key. Unlike an implicit certificate, there is no possibility that nobody knows the private key. For the purposes of this article, such certificates will be called ''explicit'' certificates. Elliptic Curve Qu-Vanstone (ECQV) are one kind of implicit certificates. This article will use ECQV as a concrete example to illustrate implicit certificates. The cryptographic portion of an ECQV implicit certificate is the size of an elliptic curve point, making it considerably smaller than a comparable explicit certificate. Smaller certificates are useful in highly constrained environments, such as Radio-frequency Identification [[RFID]] tags, where not a lot of memory or bandwidth is available. Digital certificates are considered the best-known method of establishing identity in network communications. A certificate provides a binding between identity information and a [[public key]]; a key pair can subsequently be used for [[key exchange]] to set up secured communications and for [[digital signatures]], to authenticate users or transactions for example. Conventional explicit certificates are made up of three parts: identification data, a [[public key]] and a [[digital signature]] which binds the public key to the user’s identification data (ID). The digital certificate is created by a [[trusted third party]] and its signature can be independently verified by anyone in the network. The public key, ID and digital signature are distinct data elements which make the up the physical size of the certificate. Conventional certificates can get very large. For example, a standard [[X.509]] certificate is on the order of 1KB in size (~8000 bits). Implicit certificates carry the same data (ID, public key and digital signature) but the data elements are super imposed into a string the size of the public key. For example using an [[elliptic curve]] system at 160 bits would give us implicit certificates of size 160 bits. With implicit certificates there is no explicit validation of the [[Certificate Authority]]'s (CA’s) signature on a certificate. Instead, a user computes a public key from the implicit certificate and simply uses it in
