arts.<ref>De Bello Gallico 6.17</ref> This is probably because in the Roman [[syncretism]], Mercury was equated with the [[Celtic mythology|Celtic god]] [[Lugus]], and in this aspect was commonly accompanied by the Celtic goddess [[Rosmerta]]. Although Lugus may originally have been a deity of light or the sun (though this is disputed), similar to the Roman [[Apollo]], his importance as a god of trade and commerce made him more comparable to Mercury, and Apollo was instead equated with the Celtic deity [[Belenus]].<ref name="Littleton"/> Romans associated Mercury with the [[Germanic paganism|Germanic god]] [[Wodanaz|Wotan]], by ''[[interpretatio Romana]]''; 1st-century Roman writer [[Tacitus]] identifies him as the chief god of the Germanic peoples.<ref>Germania 9</ref> In Celtic areas, Mercury was sometimes portrayed with three heads or faces, and at [[Tongeren]], [[Belgium]], a statuette of Mercury with three [[phallus|phalli]] was found, with the extra two protruding from his head and replacing his nose; this was probably because the number [[3 (number)|3]] was considered magical, making such statues good luck and fertility charms. The Romans also made widespread use of small statues of Mercury, probably drawing from the ancient Greek tradition of [[herma]]e markers. ==Mercury's net in Ludovico Ariosto's Orlando Furioso== [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] had created a net out of unbreakable steel so that he could catch [[Venus]], the Goddess of Beauty, and [[Mars]], the God of War, in the act of making love because he was jealous of their relationship. Vulcan managed to catch them but, afterwards, Mercury stole the net from the blacksmith God so that he could catch [[Chloris#Chloris_.28Nymph.29|Cloris]], a nymph who he admired. Cloris' job is to fly after the Sun while it rises, and to scatter lilies, roses and violets behind it. Mercury lay in wait for at least several days until he caught her wing in the net over an unnamed great river in Ethiopia, most likely the Awash/Awasi river. Mercury then gives the net to the temple of Anubis at Canopus to protect the sacred spot, but it was stolen 3,000 years later by [[Caligorant]], who goes on to destroy the temple and city. [[Caligorant]] is an important character in Ariosto's Orlando Furioso.<ref>Ariosto, Ludovico. "Canto XV Lines 47-64." Orlando Furioso. Oxford: Oxford UP, 1998.

The merge window is a period of time that occurs directly after the release of a new version of the software. During this time, lots of patches are merged and hence have a long time to get scrutinized and tested before the next release. The [[Linux kernel]] have used the merge window process since July 2005 with the release of version 2.6.14, since then every 2.6.x release has been followed by a two week merge window. This causes a lot of work for the project maintainers who have to merge all the patches. The process may be slitted up with people who inspect, approve and merge the patches. == References == {{unreferenced|date=May 2008}} {{software-stub}} [[Category:Version control]] [[Category:Software project management]]</text> </page> <page> <id>24106</id> <title>Merging Technologies</title> <text><!-- Please do not remove or change this AfD message until the issue is settled --> {{Article for deletion/dated|page=Merging Technologies|timestamp=20110122132033|year=2011|month=January|day=22|substed=yes|help=off}} <!-- For administrator use only: {{Old AfD multi|page=Merging Technologies|date=22 January 2011|result='''keep'''}} --> <!-- End of AfD message, feel free to edit beyond this point --> {{primarysources|date=October 2010}} {{Infobox company | name = Merging Technologies | logo = | type = | genre = [[Music technology]] | foundation = | founder = | defunct = | location_city = [[Puidoux]] | location_country = [[Switzerland]] | industry = | products = [[Pyramix]] | homepage = [http://www.merging.com Merging Technologies] }} '''Merging Technologies''' is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] manufacturer of hardware and software for audio and video production.
