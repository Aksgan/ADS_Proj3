It started in 1996 as successor of the '''Journal of Information Processing and Cybernetics / Elektronische Informationsverarbeitung und Kybernetik'''; the forerunner journal started in 1965. The main focus of the journal is on a subfield of [[theoretical computer science]], namely on [[automata theory]], [[formal language]] theory and [[combinatorics]].
