The service was formerly known as Google Print when it was introduced at the [[Frankfurt Book Fair]] in October 2004. Google's Library Project, also now known as Google Book Search, was announced in December 2004. Results from Google Book Search show up in both general web search at google.com and through the dedicated Google Books site (books.google.com). Up to three results from the Google Books index may be displayed, if relevant, above other search results in the Google Web search service (google.com). Subscribing users can click on a result from Google Books that opens an interface in which the user may view pages from the book, if out of copyright or if the copyright owner has given permission. Books in the public domain are available in "full view" and free for download. For in-print books, Google limits the number of viewable pages through a variety of access limitations and security measures, some based on user-tracking.<ref>{{cite web| author=Greg Duffy | title= Google's Cookie and Hacking Google Print | month= March | year= 2005 | url=http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/3/7/95844/59875| work= [[Kuro5hin]]}}</ref> For books that may be covered by copyright and where the owner has not been identified, only "snippets" (two to three lines of text) are shown, though the full text of the book is searchable. Content-related advertisements appear alongside search results but not next to previewed books. The site provides links to the publisher's website and booksellers. The Google Books database continues to grow. For users outside the [[United States]], though, Google must be sure that the work in question is indeed out of copyright under local laws. According to a member of the Google Books Support Team, "Since whether a book is in the public domain can often be a tricky legal question, we err on the side of caution and display at most a few snippets until we have determined that the book has entered the public domain."<ref>{{Cite web | author= Ryan Sands | title= From the mail bag: Public domain books and downloads | work= Inside Google Book Search |format=[[blog]]| date= November 9, 2006 | url=http://booksearch.blogspot.com/2006/11/from-mail-bag-public-domain-books-and.html}}</ref> Users outside the United States can however access a large number of public domain books scanned by Google using copies stored on the [[Internet Archive]].<ref>[http://www.archive.org/details/googlebooks Archive.org]</ref> Many of the books are scanned using the Elphel 323 camera<ref name="elphel323">[http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2007/08/weekly-google-code-roundup-for-august.html Google currently uses Elphel cameras for book scanning and for capturing street imagery in Google Maps]</ref><ref>[http://www.webcitation.org/5ZiPASUCN "Adapted firmware of Elphel 323 camera to meet needs of Google Book Search"]</ref> at a rate of 1,000 pages per hour.<ref name="nyt">{{cite news |first=Kevin |last=Kelly |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Scan This Book! |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/14/magazine/14publishing.html?_r=1&oref=slogin&pagewanted=all |quote=When Google announced in December 2004 that it would digitally scan the books of five major research libraries to make their contents searchable, the promise of a universal library was resurrected. ...
