Accurate estimates on the number of active terrorist group’s websites vary due to difficulties measuring but, there is a general consensus that in 1996 there was just under 100 websites and to well over 5000 websites today. It is also widely accepted that all Foreign Terrorist Organisation’s listed by the U.S. Department of State website have established an online presence of some form. Only after [[9/11]] has governmental and public interest really been focussed on terrorists and the internet shown by the large number of articles examining the issue in the media which primarily occurred due to evidence recovered from [[Al Qaeda]] computers in Afghanistan, that indicate the Internet was being used to collect intelligence and send encrypted messages.<ref name="Weimann 2004: 12">Weimann 2004: 12</ref><ref>Thomas 2003: 1</ref> The definition of terrorism used in this document is that of the new academic consensus definition: that terrorism is “a politically motivated tactic involving the threat or use of force or violence in which the pursuit of publicity plays a significant role”.<ref>Weinberg et al. 2004:786</ref> ==Terrorist groups use of the Internet== Growth in the use of the internet by terrorist groups is due to the key characteristics of the internet: ease of access which facilitates the possible massive worldwide audiences, few laws when compared to the physical world, little censorship, rapid and ‘always on’ flow of information, the low cost, anonymity of communication and a multimedia environment. The following is a breakdown of the main purposes that terrorist groups utilise the Internet for: ===Cyberterrorism=== Directly after 9/11, much was made of the possibilities of a large-scale [[cyber-terrorism]] attack by the media. However, several academics in the pending years published papers focussing on the terrorist groups utilize the Internet as it was designed to be; a means to communicate and collaborate, therefore the terrorists have stronger reasons to keep it up and online. Hence the apparently impending large scale cyber-terrorist attack that would cripple the internet has not materialised although Al Qaeda has taken full advantage of this fear<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6197446.stm |title=Americas &#124; US warns of al-Qaeda cyber threat |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-12-01 |accessdate=2009-12-13}}</ref> - see section entitled Disinformation. ===Publicity and Propaganda=== As stated by Dr Maura Conway, terrorism researcher: <blockquote> “Every machine connected to the internet is potentially a printing press, a broadcasting station or place of assembly.” <ref>Conway 2003: 271</ref> </blockquote> The internet is an un-paralleled media suite. Terrorists no longer have to have their messages diluted and edited by the media. Instead they can disseminate information of their choice to aid their causes. In most cases, this is achieved by the terrorists focusing on their grievances in order to justify why they are resorting to terrorist activities. This is usually achieved by the publication of various articles combined with pictures galleries, although this may be supplemented by video and audio files in which the terrorists themselves orally defend their actions. An example of this would be a gallery of atrocities against innocent civilians in Iraq supposedly carried out by foreign forces in order
