Written in 1929, and first published in [[German language|German]] in 1930 as ''Das Unbehagen in der Kultur'' ("The Uneasiness in Culture"), it is one of Freud's most important and widely read works.<ref>{{Harv|Gay|1989|loc=p. 722}}</ref> <!-- FAIR USE of Civilization_and_Its_Discontents_book_cover.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Civilization_and_Its_Discontents_book_cover.jpg for rationale --> ==Contents== In this seminal book, Sigmund Freud propounds his perspective by enumerating what he sees as the fundamental tensions between civilization and the individual. The primary friction, he asserts, stems from the individual's quest for instinctual freedom and [[civilization]]'s contrary demand for [[conformity]] and instinctual repression. Many of humankind's primitive instincts (for example, the desire to kill and the insatiable craving for sexual gratification) are clearly harmful to the well-being of a human community. As a result, [[civilization]] creates laws that prohibit killing, rape, and adultery, and it implements severe punishments if such rules are broken. This process, argues Freud, is an inherent quality of civilization that instills perpetual feelings of discontent in its citizens. Freud's theory is based on the notion that humans have certain characteristic instincts that are immutable. Most notable are the desires for sex, and the predisposition to violent aggression towards authoritative figures and towards sexual competitors, which both obstruct the gratification of a person's instincts. Human beings are governed by the pleasure principle, and the pleasure principle is satisfied by the instincts. ===Synopsis=== Freud begins this work by taking up a possible source of religious feeling that his previous book, ''[[The Future of an Illusion]]'', overlooked: the ''[[oceanic feeling]]'' of wholeness, limitlessness, and eternity.<ref>The concept of "[[oceanic feeling]]" was coined by [[Romain Rolland]] in his [[Romain Rolland#Correspondence with Freud|Correspondence with Freud]], based on his studies of [[Eastern mysticism]], in which correspondence he wished to hear Freud's analysis of the concept, which was answered in these books. Freud credits the term to an anonymous friend.</ref> Freud himself cannot experience this feeling of dissolution, but notes that there do indeed exist different pathological and healthy states (e.g. love) where the boundary between ego and object is lost, blurred, or distorted. Freud categorizes the oceanic feeling as being a regression into an earlier state of consciousness before the ego had differentiated itself from the world of objects. Freud sticks to his earlier conviction that the need that the religious feeling arises out of is 'the infant's helplessness and the longing for the father' <ref> Strachey 2001, pg. 72 </ref>, and “imagine[s] that the oceanic feeling became connected with religion later on”, that is, that it is not a genuine religious experience, though certainly people experiencing it have felt that way. The second chapter delves into how religion is one of many modes of being that arise out of the need for the individual to distance and soothe itself in the face of the suffering that exists within the world. The [[ego]] of the child forms over the oceanic feeling when it grasps that there are negative aspects of reality that it wishes to separate itself from. But at the same time as the ego is hoping to avoid displeasure, it is also building itself so that it may be better able to act towards securing happiness, and these are the twin aims of the [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] when the ego realizes that ‘[[Reality principle|reality]]’ must also be dealt with. Freud claims that the 'purpose of life is simply the programme of the pleasure principle'<ref> Strachey 2001, pg. 76 </ref> and the rest of the chapter is an exploration of various styles of human adaptation used to secure happiness from the world while also trying to avoid or limit suffering. Freud points out three main sources of displeasure we attempt to master: our own painful and mortal existence, the cruel and destructive aspects of the natural world, and the suffering endemic to the reality that we must live with other human beings in a society. Freud regards this last source as “perhaps more painful to us than any other” <ref> Strachey 2001, pg. 77 </ref>, and the remainder of this book will extrapolate on the conflict between individual instinctual gratification-seeking and the reality of societal life. The third section of the book addresses a fundamental paradox of civilization: it is a tool we have created to protect ourselves from unhappiness, and yet it is our largest source of unhappiness. People become neurotic because they cannot tolerate the frustration which society imposes in the service of its cultural ideals. Freud points out that the contemporary technological advances of science have been, at best, a mixed blessing for human happiness. He asks what society is for if not to satisfy the pleasure principle, but concedes that civilization has to make compromises of happiness in order to fulfill its primary goal of bringing people into peaceful relationship with each other, which it does by making them [[Last Man|subject to a higher, communal authority]]. Civilization is built out of wish-fulfillments of the human ideals of control, beauty, hygiene, order, and especially for the exercise of humanity's highest intellectual functions. Freud draws a key analogy between the development of civilization and the [[libido|libidinal]] development of the individual, which allows Freud to speak of civilization in his own terms: there is anal eroticism that develops into a need for order and cleanliness, a sublimation of instincts into useful actions, alongside a more repressive renunciation of instinct. This final point Freud sees as the most important character of civilization, and if it’s not compensated for, then “one can be certain that serious disorders will ensue." <ref> Strachey 2001, pg. 97 </ref>. Thus civilization creates discontent and mental pathology within its members through repression of instinct. In the fourth chapter Freud attempts a conjecture as to the developmental history of civilization, which
