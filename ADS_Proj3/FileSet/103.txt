With the [[Internet]] becoming more popular, SmartSketch was re-released as FutureSplash, a [[Vector graphics|vector]]-based [[web animation]] in competition with Macromedia [[Adobe Shockwave|Shockwave]]. In 1995, SmartSketch was further modified with frame-by-frame animation features and re-released as [[FutureSplash Animator]] on multiple platforms.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://coldhardflash.com/2008/02/grandmasters-of-flash-an-interview-with-the-creators-of-flash.html | title=Grandmasters of Flash: An Interview with the Creators of Flash | accessdate=2008-02-12 | publisher=ColdHardFlash.com}}</ref> The product was offered to Adobe and used by [[Microsoft]] in its early work with the Internet ([[MSN]]). In 1996, FutureSplash was acquired by Macromedia and released as '''Flash,''' contracting "Future" and "Splash". ===Recent developments=== <!-- Notice to editors: if possible, try to get third party references which are not simple copies of Adobe press releases. The section is also prone to original research and crystal balling which quickly becomes out of date --> '''Adobe Labs''' (previously called ''Macromedia Labs'') is a source for news and pre-release versions of emerging products and technologies from Adobe. Most innovations, such as Flash 10, [[Macromedia Flex|Flex]] 3, and ActionScript 3.0 have all been discussed and/or trialled on the site. One area Adobe is focusing on (as of February 2009) is the deployment of [[Rich Internet Applications]] (RIAs). To this end, they released [[Adobe Integrated Runtime]] (AIR), a [[cross-platform]] [[runtime environment]] which can be used to build, using Adobe Flash, rich Internet applications that can be deployed as [[application software|desktop applications]]. It surpassed 100 million installations worldwide in February 2009.<ref>{{cite web| url =http://blogs.adobe.com/air/2009/01/air_passes_100_million_install.html?sdid=EENCL | title = AIR passes 100 million installations | accessdate = 2009-02-03}}</ref> Flash is installed silently when Acrobat Reader is installed.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/520/cpsid_52001.html | title = Adobe Download Manager FAQ &#124; Flash Player and Reader | accessdate = 2011-01-19}}</ref>{{verification failed|date=January 2011}} Two additional components designed for large-scale implementation have been proposed by Adobe for future releases of Flash: first, the option to require an ad to be played in full before the main video piece is played; and second, the integration of [[digital rights management]] (DRM) capabilities. This way Adobe can give companies the option to link an advertisement with content and make sure that both are played and remain unchanged.<ref name="BBCVideoControl">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6558979.stm |title=Adobe unveils Flash video control |accessdate=2007-06-18 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2007-04-16 |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=BBC |pages= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> Flash Player for smart phones is available to handset manufacturers at the end of 2009.<ref name="palmpr">{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200902/021609AdobePalmOSP.html|title=Palm Latest Mobile Industry Leader to Join Open Screen Project|accessdate=2009-02-20|date=2009-02-16}}</ref> ====Open Screen Project==== On May 1, 2008 Adobe announced ''Open Screen Project'', which hopes to provide a consistent application interface across devices such as [[personal computer]]s, [[mobile device]]s and [[consumer electronics]].<ref name="osppr">{{cite web|title=Adobe and Industry Leaders Establish Open Screen Project|url=http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200805/050108AdobeOSP.html|accessdate=2009-02-20|date=2008-05-01}}</ref> When the project was announced, several goals were outlined: the abolition of licensing fees for Adobe Flash Player and [[Adobe Integrated Runtime]], the removal of restrictions on the use of the [[Adobe Shockwave|Shockwave]] Flash (SWF) and Flash Video (FLV) [[file format]], the publishing of [[Application Programming Interface|application programming interfaces]] for porting Flash to new devices and the publishing of The Flash Cast protocol and Action Message Format (AMF), which let Flash applications receive information from remote databases.<ref name="osppr"/> As of February 2009, the specifications removing the restrictions on the use of SWF and FLV/F4V specs have been published.<ref name="interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.uiresourcecenter.com/rich-internet-applications/articles/inside-the-open-screen-project.html?s=2_1 |title=Inside the Open Screen Project |first=Anup| last=Murarka|accessdate=2009-02-21}}</ref> The Flash Cast protocol—now known as the Mobile Content Delivery Protocol—and AMF protocols have also been made available,<ref name="interview"/> with AMF available as an open source implementation, [[BlazeDS]]. Work on the device porting layers is in the early stages. Adobe intends to remove the licensing fees for Flash Player and Adobe AIR for devices at their release for the Open Screen Project.

[[Flash Video]] files<ref group="spec">FLV and F4V [http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flv/pdf/video_file_format_spec_v9.pdf Video File Format Specification Version 9]<br />F4V is based on [[ISO base media file format]] standard:[http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c051533_ISO_IEC_14496-12_2008.zip freely available ISO standards] , and also available via subscription [http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=41828]</ref> have a .flv file extension and are either used from within .[[swf]] files or played through a flv-aware player, such as [[VLC media player|VLC]], or [[QuickTime]] and [[Windows Media Player]] with external [[codec]]s added. The use of vector graphics combined with program code allows Flash files to be smaller — and thus for streams to use less [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] — than the corresponding bitmaps or video clips. For content in a single format (such as just text, video, or audio), other alternatives may provide better performance and consume less [[central processing unit|CPU]] power than the corresponding Flash movie, for example when using transparency or making large screen updates such as photographic or text fades. In addition to a vector-rendering engine, the Flash Player includes a virtual machine called the ActionScript Virtual Machine (AVM) for scripting interactivity at run-time, support for video, MP3-based audio, and bitmap graphics. As of Flash Player 8, it offers two video codecs: [[On2 Technologies]] [[VP6]] and [[sorenson codec|Sorenson Spark]], and run-time support for [[JPEG]], Progressive JPEG, [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], and [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]]. In the next version, Flash is slated to use a [[Just-in-time compilation|just-in-time]] compiler for the ActionScript engine. Flash
