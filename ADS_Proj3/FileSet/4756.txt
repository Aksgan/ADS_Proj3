has default attribute - [[object identifier]] ('''id''') to be used by [[web crawlers]] to co-ordinate the same object's attributes used in different [[web page|pages]] of the same [[website]]. Website Parse Template foresees several predefined concepts that are general for all kind of [[websites]]: “'''''Menu'''''” - [[navigation bar]]/menu<br /> “'''''Logo'''''” - [[design]] element/[[logo]]<br /> “'''''Content'''''” - element that contains main [[Web content|textual content]] of the [[Web page|page]]<br /> “'''''Advertisement'''''” – [[advertisement]]/[[Web banner|banner]]<br /> “'''''External Link'''''” – element that contains [[Hyperlink|external links]]<br /> <br /> === WPT Templates === Templates section contains number of templates for groups of similarly structured web pages. Either of those templates refers to a single group of similarly structured [[web pages]]. [[HTML element|HTML elements’]] [[XPath]] references or [[HTML tag|TagIDs]] are used for linking structured [[Web content|content]] with defined [[concepts]]. The template description starts with opening <''template''> [[Tag (metadata)|tags]] and ends with closing </''template''> tag. In <''template''> tag it is required to specify template name and language used for templates description. As a template name can be chosen any string, but for the language it is necessary to indicate supported [[Formal language|language]] type, e.g. "''icdl:template''", "''[[Resource Description Framework|rdf]]''" or "''[[Universal Networking Language|unl:expression]]''". '''Example 2. Simple template for single artist page on [[Yahoo! Music]]''' <source lang="xml"> <template name="Artist page on Yahoo! Music" language="icdl:template"> <html_tag tagid="yent-uhdr" content="Menu"/> <html_tag xpath="/html/body/div[2]/div/div/div[3]/div/a/span" content="Logo"/> <html_tag xpath="/html/body/div/div" content="Advertisement"/> <html_tag xpath="/html/body/div[3]/table/tbody/tr/td[2]/div/h1" content="artist.name"/> <html_tag tagid="art_img" content="artist.image"/> <html_tag tagid="biography" content="artist.bio" reference="Artist Bio"/> <html_tag xpath="/html/body/div[3]/table/tbody/tr/td[2]/table/tbody/tr[22]" content="artist.album"/> <html_tag xpath="/html/body/div[3]/table/tbody/tr/td[2]/table/tbody/tr[10]" content="artist.track"/> <html_tag xpath="/html/body/div[3]/table/tbody/tr/td[2]/table/tbody/tr[13]" content="artist.video"/> </template> </source> The [[web page]] may contain structured repeatable content (<repeatable block>) included in one main [[HTML element]] (<container>) that are specified as follows: '''Example 3. Repeatable content representation''' <source lang="xml"> <template name="Artist page on Yahoo! Music" language="icdl:template"> . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . <container container_xpath="/html/body/div[3]/table/tbody/tr[10]/td/table"> <repeatable_block block_xpath="/html/body/div[3]/table/tbody/tr[10]/td/table/tbody/tr/td[4]"> <html_tag xpath="/html/body/div[3]/table/tbody/tr[10]/td/table/tbody/tr/td[4]" content="artist.track"/> </repeatable_block> </container> . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . </template> </source> In case of specified complex [[HTML element]] is already described by another template the <reference> tag can be used to point to that template block. It makes possible to create hierarchic relations between WPT templates so that [[web crawlers]] can use specified [[Reference|reference(s)]] to identify the same object in different pages of a given [[website]]. '''Example 4. [[Hierarchical model|Hierarchic relations]] between WPT Templates''' <source lang="xml"> <template name="Artist page on Yahoo! Music" language="icdl:template"> . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . <html_tag tagid="biography" content="artist.bio" reference="Artist Bio"/> . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . </template> <template name="Artist Bio" language="icdl:template"> <html_tag xpath="/html/body/div[3]/table/tbody/tr/td[2]/div/h1" content="artist.name"/> <html_tag tagid="art_img" content="artist.image"/> <html_tag xpath="/html/body/div[3]/table/tbody/tr/td[2]/table/tbody/tr/td" content="artist.bio"/> </template> </source> === URLs section === This section defines the [[URLs]]/URL patterns that are corresponding to groups of similarly structured web pages described in Templates section. In accordance with Templates section URLs section also may consist of several blocks and either of those blocks should start with <''urls''> tag and ends with </''urls''> tag. '''Example 5. URLs/URL patterns''' <source lang="xml"> <urls name="Artist page on Yahoo! Music" template="Artist page on Yahoo! Music"> <url url="http://music.yahoo.com/ar-8206256---Amy-Winehouse"/> <url url="http://music.yahoo.com/ar-([artist.id[0-9]*])---(artist.full name[[A-Z,a-z,-,0-9]*])"/> </urls> </source> As a [[URLs]] block name can be chosen any string, but for the template it is necessary to indicate certain template name described in previous section. The URL pattern provided in ''Example 5'' also include the represented real [[URL]]. [[Regular Expressions|RegExp]] specifications are used for URL patterns descriptions. The concepts necessary for URL pattern definition (such as "id" and "fullname") are to be defined previously in Ontology section. == See also == * [[ICDL Crawling]] * [[Open Market For Internet Content Accessibility]] * [[Semantic Web]] * [[World Wide Web Consortium]] * [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] * [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] * [[Regular Expressions]] * [[Universal Networking Language]] == External links == * [http://www.omfica.org OMFICA] {{Internet search}} [[Category:World Wide Web]] [[Category:Knowledge representation]] [[Category:Web development]] [[Category:Bibliography file formats]] * [http://binhgiang.sourceforge.net/site/products.jsp VDER - Web Data Extractor Software] {{Web Crawler}}</text> </page> <page> <id>39990</id> <title>Webtoon</title> <text>{{for|non-animated features|Webcomic}} A '''webtoon''' is a less common term used to describe an animated cartoon that is distributed via the internet which are often created by amateur creators. They are commonly created using [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], or a simple image editor and frame animation software such as [[Windows Movie Maker]]. In some instances, some webtoons and creators have become famous enough to be picked up by the cartoon industry. ''[[Making Fiends]]'', for example, became popular enough to be given the chance to become an actual cartoon on [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]]. Other examples of a webtoon is [[Neurotically Yours]], [[Happy Tree Friends]], [[Pucca]], and [[Homestar Runner]]. {{Unreferenced|date=June 2008}} [[Category:Electronic publishing]]</text> </page> <page> <id>39995</id> <title>Wei Yen</title> <text>{{Refimprove|date=July 2008}} '''Dr. Wei Yen''' is a [[software developer]] and [[entrepreneur]].

They were the major contributors to the [[Cydra-5]] mini-supercomputer. The system was a combination of a VLIW ECL-based processor used for scientific applications and a multi-processor system designed for a bus architecture based on their Cache Coherence protocol. Wei served as Senior Vice President of [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]]. In 1996, Dr. Yen left SGI and founded TVsoft, a maker of interactive software for television setup devices. It was renamed Navio, a company that merged with Oracle's Network Computer (NCI). It became liberate and then went public in July, 1999.
