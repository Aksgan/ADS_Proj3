[...] In short, suspicions about this patent are overblown. }} </ref> The [[Claim (patent)|claims]] were narrowly framed to a particular [[GUI]] rather than to the sudo concept.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} ==Design== Before running a command with sudo, users typically supply their [[password]]. Once authenticated, and if the <code>/etc/sudoers</code> configuration file permits the user access, then the command is run. There exist several graphical frontends for use in a [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] environment, notably '''kdesudo''', and '''gksudo'''; [[Mac OS X]] also has Authorization Services.<ref>[http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Security/Conceptual/authorization_concepts/01introduction/introduction.html Introduction to Authorization Services Programming Guide]</ref> By default the user's password can be retained through a grace period, allowing the user to execute several successive commands as root without having to provide the password again. The following is an example where the user is denied access: snorri@rimu:~$ sudo emacs /etc/resolv.conf We assume you have received the usual lecture from the local System Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things: #1) Respect the privacy of others. #2) Think before you type. #3) With great power comes great responsibility. Password: snorri is not in the sudoers file. This incident will be reported. snorri@rimu:~$ Below is the log of this failed attempt, then a later successful one, after ''snorri'' has been added to /etc/sudoers: <pre> snorri@rimu:~$ sudo tail /var/log/auth.log Aug 5 06:00:28 localhost sudo: snorri : user NOT in sudoers ; TTY=pts/1 ; PWD =/home/snorri ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/usr/bin/emacs /etc/resolv.conf Aug 5 06:01:15 localhost su[15573]: (pam_unix) session opened for user root by snorri(uid=1000) Aug 5 06:02:09 localhost sudo: snorri : TTY=pts/1 ; PWD=/home/snorri ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/usr/bin/emacs /etc/resolv.conf Aug 5 06:02:49 localhost sudo: snorri : TTY=pts/1 ; PWD=/home/snorri ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/usr/bin/tail /var/log/auth.log </pre> ==Runas, su and sudo== {{Unreferenced section|date=September 2010}} [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] has a command called [[runas]]. It has similar functionality, <!-- On a Windows system, "Administrator" has superuser permissions. --> but neither runas nor [[User Account Control|UAC]] is sudo; rather, they fully impersonate another user rather than just adding privileges. Runas and su: * do not allow authorized users to launch processes with elevated privileges using their own passphrase.{{fact|Isn't this exactly what the runas /trustlevel flag does?|date=January 2011}} * do not preserve the user's profile and ownership of created objects. The runas command is (more or less) equivalent to Unix [[Su (Unix)|su]], not sudo. The reason sudo is sometimes considered superior to su is that it allows privilege escalation based on the user’s own identity, and most importantly does not require use of a shared password. Using runas or su to access a privileged account requires distribution of a password to an admin-capable account, a security weakness that sudo does not have. ==See also== {{Portal|Free software}} * [[Comparison of privilege authorization features]] * [[visudo]], a [[vi]]-based program used to edit the <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * {{Official website|http://www.sudo.ws/}} * [http://sourceforge.net/projects/rootsh rootsh] and [http://sourceforge.net/projects/sudosh/ sudosh], sudo wrappers for logging {{Unix commands}} [[Category:Unix user management and support-related utilities]] [[Category:Computer security software]] [[ar:سودو]] [[bar:Sudo]] [[ca:Sudo]] [[cs:Sudo]] [[da:Sudo]] [[de:Sudo]] [[es:Sudo]] [[fr:Sudo]] [[ko:Sudo]] [[id:Sudo]] [[it:Sudo]] [[ja:Sudo]] [[pl:Sudo]] [[pt:Sudo]] [[ro:Sudo]] [[ru:Sudo]] [[sl:Sudo]] [[sv:Sudo]] [[uk:Sudo]] [[zh:Sudo]]</text> </page> <page> <id>36095</id> <title>Sudoku Challenge!</title> <text>{{Infobox VG | title = Sudoku Challenge! | image = [[File:Sudoku Challenge!.jpg|145px]] | caption = | developer = [[Digital Leisure]] | publisher = [[Digital Leisure]] | engine = | released = '''WiiWare'''<BR>{{vgrelease|NA=November 24, 2008|PAL=December 19, 2008}}'''DSiWare'''<BR>{{vgrelease|NA=November 30, 2009<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/zNkSTwlGhaR9groybRQ-XvIIl5nV32u- |title=Nintendo Offers 10 Downloads to Help You Recover from Your Holiday Weekend |publisher=Nintendo of America |date=30 November 2009 |accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref>|PAL=May 14, 2010}} | genre = [[Puzzle video game|Puzzle]] | modes = [[Single-player]] | ratings = {{vgratings|ESRB=E|OFLCA=G|PEGI=3|USK=Without age restrictions}} | platforms = [[Wii]] ([[WiiWare]]), [[Nintendo DSi]] ([[DSiWare]]) | media = Download | input = [[Wii Remote]] }} '''''Sudoku Challenge!''''' is a [[WiiWare]] [[sudoku]] game developed by [[Digital Leisure]].

Commenting that the presentation was functional and that most players will be satisfied with what was on offer, with the sudoku puzzles varying in difficulty to challenge players of all skill levels, they were also impressed with the number of puzzles included and claimed that, at 10 minutes a puzzle, it would take a player at least 1900 years to complete all the puzzles included on the game.<ref>[http://www.wiiware-world.com/reviews/2008/11/sudoku_challenge WiiWare World Sudoku Challenge!
