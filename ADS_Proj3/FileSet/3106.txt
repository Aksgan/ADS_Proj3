and thereafter. The first formal national accounts were published by the United States in 1947. Many European countries followed shortly thereafter, and the United Nations published ''A System of National Accounts and Supporting Tables'' in 1952.<ref name="Ruggles"/> International standards for national accounting are defined by the [[United Nations System of National Accounts]], with the most recent version released in 2008. In Europe the worldwide System of National Accounts has been adapted in the [[European System of Accounts]] (ESA), which is applied by members of the European Union and many other European countries. ==See also== {{MultiCol}} * [[United Nations System of National Accounts]] * [[European System of Accounts]] * [[System of Material Product Balance]] * [[National Income and Product Accounts]] * [[Measures of national income and output]] {{ColBreak}} * [[Aggregation problem]] * [[Generational accounting]] * [[Green accounting]] * [[Official statistics]] * [[Stock and flow]] {{EndMultiCol}} ==Notes== {{Reflist}} ==References== * From ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2008, 2nd Edition: :"national income" by Thomas K.

It adopts [[Mixed Set Programming]] as algorithmic framework for modeling and solving problems. == Introduction == Combinatorial problems are ubiquitous in the daily life and work. Being usually [[NP-hard]], they are in general very difficult to solve. The goal of designing NCL is to provide a programming language that is close to basic human reasoning which could be to a large extent symbolized by conventional [[mathematical logic]]. In this sense, NCL is a description language with [[context-sensitive grammar|context-sensitive]] (while not [[context-free]]) grammar for solving [[constraint satisfaction problem|constraint satisfaction problems]]. Consequently, NCL supports implicit typing and context-based constraint reasoning and solving. == Features == NCL stems from [[Constraint programming|Constraint Programming]]. However its basic differences from CP systems and script style modeling languages are two-fold: * At the parser level: NCL’s “Semantic Parser” understands natural problem formulation in mathematical logic and submits abstract models to its solver. Technically saying, NCL's syntax is context-sensitive, not context-free. * At the solver level: [[Mixed Set Programming]] solves problems over a mixed domain of [[real number|reals]], [[integer|integers]], [[Boolean data type|Booleans]], [[reference|references]], [[Date (metadata)|dates]]/[[time|times]] and [[set (computer science)|sets]]. The solver incorporates a simplified form of [[first order logic]], naïve set reasoning, numerical constraints, date/time management and [[operations research]] [[algorithms]] to solve problems in a cooperative manner. Traditional [[Constraint programming|CP]] systems strengthen problem modeling and solving capability by introducing [[Operations research|OR]] algorithms called “global constraints”. For comparison, in NCL no special [[Syntactic predicate|predicate]] such as Sort, Alldifferent, Alldisjoint, Cumulative, Cycle/Path, Sequencing, Global Cardinality/Among/Distribute, etc. is introduced, though NCL includes algorithms for solving these related problems and many others. Global Constraints do not fit in NCL due to two reasons: * Besides hundreds of elementary algorithms, several tens of “big” algorithms such as “sort” exist in NCL. Even “sort” alone has at least four variants for each of the domains of [[real number|reals]], [[integer|integers]] and [[set (mathematics)|sets]], and may be linked to peripheral concepts such as “UnaryResource”, “AscendingSorting”, “RegretBasedSearch”, etc. This suggests that global (or specialized) constraints cannot be explicitly defined in NCL. Otherwise too many specific names and peripheral concepts will be introduced. * From a global point of view, context-based reasoning and solving is crucial. Sophisticated reasoning links between algorithms are the key to solving complex problems. This suggests that there should be some mechanism beyond “global constraints” to support context-based analysis and coordination for embedded algorithms. In NCL, “Semantic Parser” recognizes [[mathematical logic]] formulation, identifies algorithms and coordinates algorithmic links for solving a problem. == References == * [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6V0J-40T9J4Y-3&_user=10&_coverDate=09%2F30%2F2000&_alid=999815256&_rdoc=3&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_cdi=5648&_docanchor=&view=c&_ct=49&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=12361fd761bf5a2c098275c81820f104 J.
