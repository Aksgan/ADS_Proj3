Video game talk show ''[[Good Game]]'''s two presenters gave the game a 7 and 7.5 out of 10 saying how it was quite fun and that your animal would give instant feedback as well most younger gamers would love playing it. Intially they said "It has a lot more life, energy and fun to it than something like ''[[EyePet]]'' - there's a lot of sparkle, but I was okay with that."<ref>{{cite episode|title=Kinect Round Up Review|credits=Bendixsen 6.5/10, O'Donnell 6/10|network=[[ABC Television]]|airdate=29 November 2010|season=5|number=42|transcripturl=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/goodgame/stories/s3079641.htm}}</ref> ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/Kinectimals/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d8024d5308b3 ''Kinectimals'' official website] *[http://frontier.co.uk/ Frontier Developments Official website] *[http://kinectimals.info/wiki/Main_Page ''Kinectimals'' Wiki] - Kinectimals.info *[http://123kinect.com/kinectimals-achievements-list/ ''Kinectimals'' Achievements List] [[Category:2010 video games]] [[Category:Kinect games]] [[Category:Microsoft games]] [[Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom]] [[Category:Virtual pets]] [[Category:Xbox 360 games]] [[Category:Xbox 360-only games]]</text> </page> <page> <id>20694</id> <title>KingsRow</title> <text>{{orphan|date=October 2010}} {{unreferenced|date=October 2010}} '''KingsRow''' is a strong [[checkers]] and [[draughts]] engine. It was released by Ed Gilbert in 2000. The checkers engine can be used with the [[CheckerBoard]] [[GUI]]. The engine available as freeware. ==History== In the only Computer Checkers World Championship, KingsRow took 2nd place behind [[Nemesis_(draughts_player)|Nemesis]]. KingsRow was stronger than [[Cake (draughts player)|Cake++]] in the early years. Cake++ finally caught up with KingsRow and gradually became stronger. It competed a 624 games match against Cake++ on [[Thanksgiving]] 2004 and Cake++ won 3 to 1 with 620 games ending in a draw. On July 17, 2005, Ed Gilbert completed building a 10-piece [[endgame database]] for use with KingsRow. The top checkers engines like KingsRow are nearly unbeatable today. Due to their large opening books the engines stay long enough in the book so that the search function sees a database draw in the endgame tablebase. A version for italian checkers with an 9 piece endgame tablebase is available too. == Draughts version == A 10x10 version of KingsRow was started in 2007. In 2009, a 8 piece endgame tablebase was finished. With checkers solved and all top engine matches ending in draws only, KingsRow focusses on 10x10 draughts only today. ==External links== *[http://pages.prodigy.net/eyg/Checkers/KingsRow.htm KingsRow Homepage] *[http://pages.prodigy.net/eyg/Checkers/KingsRowItalian.htm KingsRow Italian] {{Board-game-stub}} [[Category:Computer draughts players]]</text> </page> <page> <id>20700</id> <title>Kinsmod</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=February 2009}} {{lowercase|title=kinsmod}} '''kinsmod''' is a program written by Silvio Cesare which, in the [[Linux]] operating system, allows the insertion of a potentially malicious [[Loadable kernel module]] by writing to the /dev/kmem device, regardless of whether the kernel has been compiled with [[Loadable kernel module]] support. The [[Grsecurity]] Linux kernel patch-set provides a safe guard against this security risk, providing an option "Deny writing to /dev/kmem". Note that on a correctly configured system only trusted users (normally only the administrator) are permitted to write to the /dev/kmem device and using kinsmod doesn't give a potential attacker any advantage. == External links == * [http://vx.netlux.org/lib/vsc07.html Silvio Cesare's Runtime Kernel kmem Patching] [[Category:Operating system security]] {{linux-stub}} {{security-software-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>20707</id> <title>KisMAC</title> <text>{{Infobox software| |name = KisMAC |logo = [[Image:KisMAC logo.png|128px|KisMAC logo]] |screenshot = [[Image:Kismac.jpg|200px|KisMAC on [[Mac OS X]]]] |caption = KisMAC on [[Mac OS X]] |latest_release_version
