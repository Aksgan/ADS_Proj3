a space ''X'' is [[relatively compact]] in ''X'' if the closure of ''Y'' in ''X'' is compact. ; Residual: If ''X'' is a space and ''A'' is a subset of ''X'', then ''A'' is residual in ''X'' if the complement of ''A'' is meagre in ''X''. Also called '''comeagre''' or '''comeager'''. ; Resolvable: A [[topological space]] is called [[resolvable space|resolvable]] if it is expressible as the union of two [[disjoint sets|disjoint]] [[dense subset]]s. ; Rim-compact: A space is rim-compact if it has a base of open sets whose boundaries are compact. == S == ;Second category: See '''Meagre'''. ;[[Second-countable space|Second-countable]]: A space is [[second-countable space|second-countable]] if it has a [[countable]] base for its topology. Every second-countable space is first-countable, separable, and Lindelöf. ;[[Semilocally simply connected]]: A space ''X'' is [[semilocally simply connected]] if, for every point ''x'' in ''X'', there is a neighbourhood ''U'' of ''x'' such that every loop at ''x'' in ''U'' is homotopic in ''X'' to the constant loop ''x''. Every simply connected space and every locally simply connected space is semilocally simply connected. (Compare with locally simply connected; here, the homotopy is allowed to live in ''X'', whereas in the definition of locally simply connected, the homotopy must live in ''U''.) ;[[semiregular space|Semiregular]]: A space is semiregular if the regular open sets form a base. ;[[Separable (topology)|Separable]]: A space is [[separable (topology)|separable]] if it has a [[countable]] dense subset. ;[[Separated sets|Separated]]: Two sets ''A'' and ''B'' are [[separated sets|separated]] if each is [[disjoint]] from the other's closure. ;Sequentially compact: A space is sequentially compact if every [[sequence]] has a convergent subsequence. Every sequentially compact space is countably compact, and every first-countable, countably compact space is sequentially compact. ;[[Short map]]: See '''[[metric map]]''' ;[[Simply connected space|Simply connected]]: A space is [[simply connected space|simply connected]] if it is path-connected and every loop is homotopic to a constant map. ;Smaller topology: See '''[[Coarser topology]]'''. ;Star: The star of a point in a given [[cover (topology)|cover]] of a [[topological space]] is the union of all the sets in the cover that contain the point. See '''[[star refinement]]'''. ;<math>f</math>-Strong topology: Let <math>f\colon X\rightarrow Y</math> be a map of topological spaces. We say that <math>Y</math> has the <math>f</math>-strong topology if, for every subset <math>U\subset Y</math>, one has that <math>U</math> is open in <math>Y</math> if and only if <math>f^{-1}(U)</math> is open in <math>X</math> ;Stronger topology: See '''[[Finer topology]]'''. Beware, some authors, especially [[mathematical analysis|analyst]]s, use the term '''weaker topology'''. ;[[Subbase]]: A collection of open sets is a [[subbase]] (or '''subbasis''') for a topology if every non-empty proper open set in the topology is a union of [[finite set|finite]] intersections of sets in the subbase. If ''B'' is ''any'' collection of subsets of a set ''X'', the topology on ''X'' generated by ''B'' is the smallest topology containing ''B''; this topology consists of the empty set, ''X'' and all unions of finite intersections of elements of ''B''. ;[[Subbase|Subbasis]]: See '''[[Subbase]]'''. ;Subcover: A cover ''K'' is a subcover (or '''subcovering''') of a cover ''L'' if every member of ''K'' is a member of ''L''. ;Subcovering: See '''Subcover'''. ;Submaximal space: A [[topological space]] is said to be '''submaximal''' if every subset of it is [[locally closed]], that is, every subset is the intersection of an [[open set]] and a [[closed set]]. Here are some facts about submaximality as a property of topological spaces: * Every [[door space]] is submaximal. * Every submaximal space is ''weakly submaximal'' viz every finite set is locally closed. ;Subspace: If ''T'' is a topology on a space ''X'', and if ''A'' is a subset of ''X'', then the [[subspace topology]] on ''A'' induced by ''T'' consists of all intersections of open sets in ''T'' with ''A''. This construction is dual to the construction of the quotient topology. == T == ;[[T0 space|T<sub>0</sub>]]: A space is [[T0 space|T<sub>0</sub>]] (or '''Kolmogorov''') if for every pair of distinct points ''x'' and ''y'' in the space, either there is an open set containing ''x'' but not ''y'', or there is an open set containing ''y'' but not ''x''. ;[[T1 space|T<sub>1</sub>]]: A space is [[T1 space|T<sub>1</sub>]] (or '''Fréchet''' or '''accessible''') if for every pair of distinct points ''x'' and ''y'' in the space, there is an open set containing ''x'' but not ''y''. (Compare with T<sub>0</sub>; here, we are allowed to specify which point will be contained in the open set.) Equivalently, a space is T<sub>1</sub> if all its [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]]s are closed. Every T<sub>1</sub> space is T<sub>0</sub>. ;[[T2 space|T<sub>2</sub>]]: See '''[[Hausdorff space]]'''. ;[[T3 space|T<sub>3</sub>]]: See '''[[T3 space|Regular Hausdorff]]'''. ;[[Tychonoff space|T<sub>3½</sub>]]: See '''[[Tychonoff space]]'''. ;[[T4 space|T<sub>4</sub>]]: See '''[[T4 space|Normal Hausdorff]]'''. ;[[T5 space|T<sub>5</sub>]]: See '''[[T5 space|Completely normal Hausdorff]]'''. ;[[Category of topological spaces|Top]]: See '''[[Category of topological spaces]]'''. ;[[Topological invariant]]: A topological invariant is a property which is preserved under homeomorphism. For example, compactness and connectedness are topological properties, whereas boundedness and completeness are not. [[Algebraic topology]] is the study of topologically invariant [[abstract algebra]] constructions on topological spaces. ;[[Topological space]]: A [[topological space]] (''X'', ''T'') is a set ''X'' equipped with a collection ''T'' of subsets of ''X'' satisfying the following [[axiom]]s: :# The empty set and ''X'' are in ''T''. :# The union of any collection of sets in ''T'' is also in ''T''. :# The intersection of any pair of sets in ''T'' is also in ''T''. :The collection ''T'' is a '''topology''' on ''X''. ;Topological sum: See '''Coproduct topology'''. ;[[Complete space|Topologically complete]]: A space is [[complete space|topologically complete]] if it is homeomorphic to a complete metric space. ;Topology: See '''[[Topological space]]'''. ;Totally bounded: A metric space ''M'' is totally bounded if, for every ''r'' > 0, there exist a [[finite set|finite]] cover of ''M'' by open balls of radius ''r''. A metric space is compact if and only if it is complete and totally bounded. ;Totally disconnected: A space is totally disconnected if it has no connected subset with more than one point. ;[[Trivial topology]]: The [[trivial topology]] (or '''indiscrete topology''') on a set ''X'' consists of precisely the empty set and the entire
