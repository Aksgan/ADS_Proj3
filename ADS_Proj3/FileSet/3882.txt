the machine was put into production. Rowlett then proposed that the machine used in the Pentagon code room be monitored by connecting a page-printing "spy machine". The output could be then studied to establish whether the machine was resistant to attack. Rowlett's suggestion was implemented at the same time the first M-228 machines were installed at the Pentagon in January 1943, used for the [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]-[[Algiers]] link. The machines worked as planned, and, initially, Rowlett's study of its security, joined by cryptanalyst Robert Ferner, uncovered no signs of cryptographic weakness. However, after a few days, a SIGCUM operator made a serious operating error, retransmitting the same message twice using the same machine settings, producing a [[depth (cryptography)|depth]]. From this, Rowlett was able to deduce the underlying [[plaintext]] and keystream used by the machine. By 2 a.m., an analysis of the keystream allowed him to deduce the wiring of the fast and medium rotors, and of the output wiring. SIGCUM was immediately withdrawn from service, and work on a replacement system, [[SIGTOT]] &mdash; a [[one-time tape]] machine designed by [[Leo Rosen]] &mdash; was given top priority. ==Redesign== Meanwhile, M-228 was redesigned to improve its security. Only five inputs, rather than thirteen, were energized. The five output contacts, instead of being used as the five output bits directly, were instead connected by three leads, each connected to different output point. That meant that an output bit could be energized by any of three different outputs from the rotor maze, making analysis of the machine more complex. The reduced number of inputs ensured that the generated key would not be biased. The rotor stepping was also made more complex. The slowest two rotors, which originally were unlikely to step during the course of an encipherment, were redesigned so that they stepped depending on the output of the previous key output. One rotor, designated that "fast bump" rotor, would step if the fourth and fifth bits of the previous output were both true; and similarly the "slow bump" rotor would do the same for the first, second and third bits. Certain of the rotor stepping arrangements were discovered to be weaker than others, and so these were ruled out for key lists. This redesigned version of the M-228 was put into service by April 1943. However, the machine was judged to be secure enough to handle traffic only up to SECRET by landline, and to CONFIDENTIAL by radio. The machine was also shared with the United Kingdom for joint communications. A further-modified version of the M-228 could be used for the highest level traffic, designated '''M-228-M''', or '''SIGHUAD'''. From that point on, the Army monitored the communications of its high-level systems to ensure that good operational procedure was being followed, even for highly secure devices such as the SIGABA and SIGTOT devices. As a result, poor operator practices, such as transmitting messages in depth, were largely eliminated. ==References== * Stephen J.

The [[C preprocessor|symbolic constant]] for SIGEMT is defined in <code>signal.h</code>. Symbolic signal names are used because signal numbers can vary across platforms. ==Etymology== ''SIG'' is a common [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] for signal names. ''EMT'' is an [[abbreviation]] for ''emulator trap''; it is the name of an instruction on the highly influential [[PDP-11]] architecture. ==Usage== {{Expand section|date=January 2007}} On the PDP-11 architecture, EMT, TRAP, BPT and IOT were instructions used for program traps. EMT was for system software, TRAP for programmer use, BPT for [[debugging]], and IOT for [[input/output|I/O]] routines. Currently EMT does not have a standardised usage.

It is a platform for all interested persons to exchange experiences in the context of workshops, conferences etc. The activities are mainly in Germany.

SIGMO stands for Synthetic, IntelliGent, MObility, and was developed by a team of high school students to demonstrate the capabilities of passive-dynamic actuation techniques. The technology used to enable SIGMO to walk is being applied to advanced prosthetic devices. Current [[prosthetic devices]] are nearing the limitations of the available technologies and require advancements such as customized motion, lower cost, and the development of light-weight materials. Existing humanoid robot systems such as [[ASIMO]] and [[QRIO]] use many motors to achieve [[motion planning|locomotion]]. These motors reduce efficiency and add unnecessary weight and cost to the robot. SIGMO attempts to alleviate these symptoms by providing a system which
