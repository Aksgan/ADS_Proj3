An extranet can be viewed as an extension of a company's [[intranet]] that is extended to users outside the company, usually partners, vendors, and suppliers. It has also been described as a "state of mind" in which the Internet is perceived as a way to do business with a selected set of other companies ([[business-to-business]], B2B), in isolation from all other Internet users. In contrast, [[business-to-consumer]] (B2C) models involve known servers of one or more companies, communicating with previously unknown consumer users. An extranet is like a [[DMZ (computing)|DMZ]] in that it provides access to needed services for channel partners, without granting access to an organization's entire network. ==Relationship to an intranet== An extranet can be understood as an intranet mapped onto the public Internet or some other transmission system not accessible to the general public, but managed by more than one company's administrator(s). For example, military networks of different security levels may map onto a common military radio transmission system that never connects to the Internet. Any private network mapped onto a public one is a [[virtual private network]] (VPN), often using special security protocols. For decades, institutions have been interconnecting to each other to create private networks for sharing information. One of the differences that characterizes an extranet, however, is that its interconnections are over a shared network rather than through dedicated physical lines. With respect to Internet Protocol networks, RFC 4364 states "If all the sites in a VPN are owned by the same enterprise, the VPN is a corporate intranet. If the various sites in a VPN are owned by different enterprises, the VPN is an extranet. A site can be in more than one VPN; e.g., in an intranet and several extranets. We regard both intranets and extranets as VPNs. In general, when we use the term VPN we will not be distinguishing between intranets and extranets. Even if this argument is valid, the term "extranet" is still applied and can be used to eliminate the use of the above description."[1] In the quote above from RFC 4364, the term "[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4364#section-2 site]" refers to a distinct networked environment. Two ''sites'' connected to each other across the public Internet backbone comprise a VPN. The term "site" does not mean "website." Thus, a small company in a single building can have an "intranet," but to have a VPN, they would need to provide tunneled access to that network for geographically distributed employees. Similarly, for smaller, geographically united organizations, "extranet" is a useful term to describe selective access to intranet systems granted to suppliers, customers, or other companies. Such access does not involve tunneling, but rather simply an authentication mechanism to a web server. In this sense, an "extranet" designates the "private part" of a [[website]], where "registered users" can navigate, enabled by [[authentication|authentication mechanisms]] on a [[logging (computer security)|"login page"]]. An extranet requires network security. These can include [[firewall (networking)|firewalls]], server management, the issuance and use of digital certificates or similar means of user [[authentication]], [[encryption]] of messages, and the use of [[virtual private networks]] (VPNs) that tunnel through the public network. Many technical specifications describe methods of implementing extranets, but often never explicitly define an extranet. RFC 3547 <ref>[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3457.txt Requirements for IPsec Remote Access Scenarios], RFC3547, S. Kelly & S. Ramamoorthi, January 2003</ref> presents requirements for remote access to extranets. RFC 2709 <ref>[http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2709.txt Security Model with Tunnel-mode IPsec for NAT Domains], RFC2709, P. Srisuresh, October 1999</ref> discusses extranet implementation using [[IPsec]] and advanced [[network address translation]] (NAT). ==Enterprise applications== During the late 1990s and early 2000s, several industries started to use the term extranet to describe central repositories of shared data made accessible via the web only to authorized members of particular work groups. Some applications are offered on a [[Software as a Service]] (SaaS) basis by vendors functioning as [[Application service provider]]s (ASPs). Specially secured extranets are used to provide virtual [[data room]] services to companies in several sectors (including law and accountancy). For example, in the construction industry, project teams may access a project extranet to share drawings and documents, make comments, issue requests for information, etc. In 2003 in the [[United Kingdom]], several of the leading vendors formed the Network for [[Construction collaboration technology|Construction Collaboration Technology]] Providers (NCCTP) to promote the technologies and to establish data exchange standards between the different data systems. The same type of construction-focused technologies have also been developed in the [[United States]], [[Australia]] and mainland Europe.<ref>{{cite book | author=Wilkinson, Paul| title=Construction Collaboration Technologies: The Extranet Evolution | publisher=Taylor & Francis | year=2005 |isbn=0-415-35859-0}}</ref> ==Advantages== * Exchange large volumes of data using [[Electronic Data Interchange]] (EDI) * Share product catalogs exclusively with trade partners * Collaborate with other companies on joint development efforts * Jointly develop and use training programs with other companies * Provide or access services provided by one company to a group of
