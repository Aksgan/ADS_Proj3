There are also a number of Special Interest Groups which organise meetings and other activities to facilitate exchange of information and views within specific areas of meteorology.<ref>[http://www.rmets.org/groups/SIG/index.php Special Interest Groups]</ref> These are informal groups of professionals interested in specific technical areas of the profession of meteorology. The groups are primarily a way of communicating at a specialist level. The current special interest groups are: *Association of British [[Climatology|Climatologists]] *[[Atmospheric chemistry|Atmospheric Chemistry]] *[[Data assimilation|Data Assimilation]] *Dynamical Problems *History of Meteorology and [[Physical oceanography|Physical Oceanography]] *Meterorological Observing Systems *Physical Processes *[[Satellite]] Meteorology and Oceanography *[[Weather forecasting|Weather Forecasting]] *Weather Service Providers ==Presidents== A full list of those who have served as president of the society is included in the society's web site.<ref>[http://www.rmets.org/about/history/presidents.php List of Presidents]</ref> A partial list is presented below: {{columns-list|3| * 2010–present: Tim Palmer FRS * 2008–2010: Professor Julia Slingo OBE * 2006–2008: Professor Geraint Vaughan * 2004–2006: Professor Chris Collier * 2002–2004: Dr Howard Cattle * 2000–2002: Dr David Burridge * 1998–2000: Professor Sir [[Brian Hoskins]] CBE FRS * 1996–1998: David J.

In addition to referring to the IPCC as “the world’s best climate scientists”, they stated that climate change is happening as “the result of emissions since industrialisation and we have already set in motion the next 50 years of global warming – what we do from now on will determine how worse it will get.”<ref>[http://www.rmets.org/news/detail.php?ID=332 Royal Meteorological Society’s statement on the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report.]</ref> ==Other related links== *[[List of atmospheric dispersion models]] *[[UK Dispersion Modelling Bureau]] *[[Met Office]] *[[MetLinkInternational]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.rmets.org/ The RMetS website] * [http://www.shop.rmets.org/ The RMetS conference booking site] * [http://www.admlc.org.uk/index.htm UK ADMLC web site] {{EngvarB|date=August 2010}} {{Use dmy dates|date=August 2010}} [[Category:Organizations established in 1850]] [[Category:Learned societies of the United Kingdom]] [[Category:Climate of the United Kingdom]] [[Category:Meteorological societies]] [[Category:British professional bodies]] [[Category:Air dispersion modeling]] [[Category:Geographic societies]] [[Category:Climate institutions and programs]] [[fr:Royal Meteorological Society]]</text> </page> <page> <id>32529</id> <title>Rpath (linking)</title> <text>:''For information on rPath, Inc. please see [[rPath]]''. {{lowercase|title=rpath (linking)}} '''rpath''' is a
