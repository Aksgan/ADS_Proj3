writing disks at the [[disk sector|sector]]-level. In some cases, the ''disk operating system'' component (or even the operating system) was known as ''DOS''. Sometimes, a ''disk operating system'' can refer to the entire operating system if it is loaded off a disk and supports the abstraction and management of disk devices. Examples include [[DOS/360]] and [[FreeDOS]]. On the [[PC compatible]] platform, an entire family of operating systems was called ''DOS''. ==History== In the early days of computers, there were no disk drives; [[Digital delay line|delay line]]s, [[punched card]]s, [[paper tape]], [[magnetic tape]], [[magnetic drum]]s, were used instead. And in the early days of microcomputers, paper tape or [[audio cassette tape]] (see [[Kansas City standard]]) or nothing were used instead. In the latter case, program and data entry was done at [[front panel]] switches directly into memory or through a [[computer terminal]] / keyboard, sometimes controlled by a [[read-only memory]] (ROM) [[BASIC]] interpreter; when power was turned off after running the program, the information so entered vanished. Both [[hard disk]]s and [[floppy disk]] drives require software to manage rapid access to block storage of sequential and other data. When microcomputers rarely had expensive disk drives of any kind, the need to have software to manage such devices (the disks) carried much status. To have one or the other was a mark of distinction and prestige, and so was having the Disk sort of an Operating System. As prices for both disk hardware and operating system software decreased, there were many such microcomputer systems. Mature versions of the [[Commodore 64|Commodore]], [[SWTPC]], [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari]] and [[Apple Computer|Apple]] [[home computer]] systems all featured a disk operating system (actually called 'DOS' in the case of the Commodore 64 (''[[CBM DOS]]''), Atari 800 (''[[Atari DOS]]''), and Apple II machines (''[[Apple DOS]]'')), as did (at the other end of the hardware spectrum, and much earlier) [[IBM]]'s [[System/360]], [[System/370|370]] and (later) [[System/390|390]] series of [[IBM mainframe|mainframe]]s (e.g., [[DOS/360]]: '''''D'''isk '''O'''perating '''S'''ystem / 360'' and [[VSE (operating system)|DOS/VSE]]: '''''D'''isk '''O'''perating '''S'''ystem / '''V'''irtual '''S'''torage '''E'''xtended''). Most home computer DOS'es were stored on a floppy disk always to be [[boot loader|booted]] at start-up, with the notable exception of Commodore, whose DOS resided on ROM chips in the [[Commodore 1541|disk drive]]s themselves (the computer itself had no DOS, just a form of a [[BIOS]] for communicating with [[peripherals]]). The [[Lt. Kernal]] [[hard disk]] subsystem for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[Commodore 128]] models stored its DOS on the disk, as is the case with modern systems, and loaded the DOS into [[RAM]] at [[boot time]]. In large machines there were other disk operating systems, such as IBM's [[VM (operating system)|VM]], DEC's [[RSTS/E|RSTS]] / [[RT-11]] / [[OpenVMS|VMS]] / [[TOPS-10]] / [[TWENEX]], MIT's [[Incompatible Timesharing System|ITS]] / [[Compatible Time Sharing System|CTSS]], Control Data's assorted [[network operating system|NOS]] variants, Harris's Vulcan, Bell Labs' [[Unix]], and so on. In [[microcomputer]]s, SWTPC's 6800 and 6809 machines used [[Technical Systems Consultants|TSC]]'s [[FLEX (operating system)|FLEX]] disk operating system, [[Radio Shack]]'s [[TRS-80]] machines used [[TRS-DOS]], their [[TRS-80 Color Computer|Color Computer]] used [[OS-9]], and most of the Intel 8080 based machines from IMSAI, [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems|MITS]] (makers of the legendary [[Altair 8800]]), [[Cromemco]], [[North Star]], etc., used the [[CP/M-80]] disk operating system. See [[list of operating systems]]. Usually, a disk operating system was loaded from a disk. Only a very few comparable DOSes were stored elsewhere than floppy disks; among these exceptions were the British [[BBC Micro]]'s optional [[Disc Filing System]], DFS, offered as a kit with a disk controller chip, a ROM chip, and a handful of logic chips, to be installed inside the computer; and [[Commodore International|Commodore]]'s [[Commodore DOS|CBM DOS]], located in a ROM chip in each disk drive. ==Disk operating systems that were extensions to the OS== *The '''DOS''' operating system for the [[Apple Computer]]'s [[Apple II]] family of computers. This was the primary operating system for this family from 1979 with the introduction of the [[floppy disk drive]] until 1983 with the introduction of '''[[ProDOS]]'''; many people continued using it long after that date. Usually it was called '''[[Apple DOS]]''' to distinguish it from [[MS-DOS]]. *'''[[Commodore DOS]]''', which was used by 8-bit [[Commodore International|Commodore]] computers. Unlike most other DOS systems, it was integrated into the disk drives, not loaded into the computer's own memory. *'''[[Atari DOS]]''', which was used by the [[Atari 8-bit family]] of computers. The Atari OS only offered low-level disk-access, so an extra layer called ''DOS'' was booted off a floppy that offered higher level functions such as filesystems. *'''[[MSX-DOS]]''', for the [[MSX]] computer standard. Initial version, released in 1984, was nothing but MS-DOS 1.0 ported to [[Zilog Z80|Z80]]; but in 1988 it evolved to version 2, offering facilities such as subdirectories, memory management and environment strings. The MSX-DOS kernel resided in ROM (built-in on the disk controller) so basic file access capacity was available even without the command interpreter, by using [[BASIC]] extended commands. *'''[[Disc Filing System]]''' (DFS) This was an optional component for the [[BBC Micro]], offered as a kit with a disk controller chip, a ROM chip, and a handful of logic chips, to be installed inside the computer. See also ''[[Advanced Disc Filing System]]''. *'''[[AMSDOS]]''', for the [[Amstrad CPC]] computers. *'''GDOS''' and '''G+DOS''', for the [[+D]] and [[DISCiPLE]] disk interfaces for the [[ZX Spectrum]]. ==Disk operating systems that were the main OS== Some disk operating systems were the operating system for the entire computer system. *The '''[[DOS/360]]''' initial/simple operating system for the [[IBM]] [[System/360]] family of [[mainframe computer]]s (it later became DOS/VSE, and was eventually just called [[VSE (operating system)|VSE]]). *The '''DOS''' operating system for [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-11]] [[minicomputer]]s. This OS and the computers it ran on were nearly obsolete by the time PCs became common, with various descendants and other replacements. *'''DOS''' for the [[IBM PC compatible]] platform {{main|DOS}} :The best known family of operating systems named "DOS" is that running on [[IBM PC]]s type hardware using the Intel CPUs or their compatible cousins from other makers. Any DOS in this family is usually just
