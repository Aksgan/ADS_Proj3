a deformation retract. For instance, having a single point as a deformation retract would imply a space is path connected (in fact, it would imply contractibility of the space). ''Note:'' An equivalent definition of deformation retraction is the following. A continuous map ''r'': ''X'' &rarr; ''A'' is a deformation retraction if it is a retraction and its composition with the inclusion is homotopic to the identity map on ''X''. In this formulation, a deformation retraction carries with it a homotopy between the identity map on ''X'' and itself. If, in the definition of a deformation retraction, we add the requirement that :<math>F(a,t) = a\,</math> for all ''t'' in [0, 1], ''F'' is called a '''strong deformation retraction'''. In other words, a strong deformation retraction leaves points in ''A'' fixed throughout the homotopy. (Some authors, such as [[Allen Hatcher]], take this as the definition of deformation retraction.) ==Neighborhood deformation retract== A pair <math>(X, A)</math> of spaces in U is an NDR-pair if there exists a map <math>u:X \rightarrow I</math> such that <math>A = u^{-1} (0)</math> and a homotopy <math>h:I \times X \rightarrow X</math> such that <math>h(0, x) = x</math> for all <math>x \in X</math>, <math>h(t, a) = a</math> for all <math>(t, a) \in I \times A</math>, and <math>h(1, x) \in A</math> for all <math>x \in u^{-1} [ 0 , 1)</math>. The pair <math>(h, u)</math> is said to be a representation of <math>(X, A)</math> as an NDR-pair. ==Properties== Deformation retraction is a particular case of homotopy equivalence. In fact, two spaces are [[homotopy equivalent]] [[if and only if]] they are both deformation retracts of a single larger space. Any topological space which deformation retracts to a point is [[contractible space|contractible]] and vice versa. However, there exist contractible spaces which do not strongly deformation retract to a point. ==References== * {{planetmath|id=6255|title=Neighborhood retract}} [[Category:Topology]] [[de:Retraktion]] [[fi:Deformaatioretrakti]] [[it:Retrazione]] [[pl:Retrakt deformacyjny]] [[ru:Деформационный ретракт]] [[zh:形变收缩]]</text> </page> <page> <id>9862</id> <title>Delcam</title> <text>{{Infobox Company | company_name = Delcam plc | logo = [[Image:DelcamLogo.jpg|160px]]| company_type = [[Public company|Public]]<br>({{lse|DLC}})| foundation = 1965 (as a team within [[Cambridge University]] Engineering Department)<br/>1989 (as Delcam International) | location_city = {{flagicon|UK}} [[Birmingham]]| location_country = [[England]], [[United Kingdom|UK]]| key_people = Clive Martell <small>([[Managing Director]])</small> <br/> Hugh Humphreys <small>([[Executive Deputy Chairman]])</small><br/> Ed Lambourne <small>([[Technical Director]])</small> <br/> Kulwant Singh <small>([[Finance Director]])</small><br/> Bart Simpson <small>([[Commercial Director]])</small><br/> Steve Hobbs <small>([[Development Director]])</small></br> Peter Miles <small>([[Non-executive chairman|Non-Executive Chairman]])</small> </br> Geoff McFarland <small>([[Non-Executive Director]]</small> | area_served = Worldwide| latitude = 52.462458 | longitude = -1.845015 | industry = [[Computer-aided design]], [[Computer-aided manufacturing]] | products = [[Engineering]] [[Software]], [[Turnkey]] cells | services = Maintenance, [[Bespoke]] solutions | homepage = [http://www.delcam.com/ Delcam.com] }} '''Delcam''' is one of the world's leading suppliers of advanced [[CAD/CAM]] software product development solutions for the manufacturing industry.<ref name="CIMdata May 2007">CIMdata. {{cite web|url= http://cimdata.com/press/PR07-0504.htm |title= Largest NC Vendors 2007 }} Retrieved on November 6, 2007.</ref><ref name="CIMdata June 2007">CIMdata. {{cite web|url= http://cimdata.com/press/PR07-0604.htm |title= Market Share of Vendors in the Mold, Tool, and Die Market 2007 }} Retrieved on November 6, 2007.</ref> The company has grown steadily since being founded formally in 1977, after initial development work at [[Cambridge University]], UK. It is now a global developer of product design and manufacturing software, with subsidiaries in North America, Europe and Asia. ==History== In 1965 Donald Welbourn, Director in Industrial Co-operation at Cambridge University [http://www-g.eng.cam.ac.uk/125/achievements/duct/index.htm], saw the possibility of using computers to assist pattern makers to solve the problems of modelling difficult 3D shapes. Early sponsorship was provided by [[Ford]], and after agreement to distribute via Control Data in Germany, customers included Volkswagen and Daimler Benz, requiring the establishment of a [[Birmingham]] based development centre from 1977. In 1989, the company was bought from Delta Group in a buyout led by [[Managing Director]] Hugh Humphreys. The company was renamed Delcam International in 1991, changed its status to [[Public Limited Company|plc]] and moved to a new purpose built building in [[Small Heath, Birmingham|Small Heath]]. In July 1997, Delcam plc was floated on the [[Alternative Investment Market]] to expand international operations, resulting in the establishment of over 70 offices. In 2005 Delcam acquired [[Salt Lake City]] based Engineering Geometry Systems.<ref>[http://www.cs.utah.edu/gdc/projects/alpha1 GDC: Project: Alpha_1<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 2006 the company acquired the PartMaker CAM solution business from IMCS of [[Philadelphia]]; and Crispin Dynamics Ltd of [[Leicester]] England. ==Key Products== [http://www.powermill.com/ PowerMILL] - Specialist NC CAM software for the manufacture of the complex shapes </br>[http://www.featurecam.com/ FeatureCAM] - Automated machining for parts on mills, lathes and wire EDM </br>[http://www.partmaker.com/ PartMaker] - Applies a visual programming approach to make CNC programming quicker and easier </br>[http://www.powershape.com/ PowerSHAPE] - CAD design and modelling software for total design solutions </br>[http://www.powerinspect.co.uk/ PowerINSPECT] - Inspection software (OMV, Manual CMMs, CNC CMM's, Inspection Arms, Optical MMs, Laser Trackers and Line Laser Probes) </br>[http://www.delcam-crispin.com/ Delcam CRISPIN] - Sole Engineering for the footwear Industry </br>[http://www.copycad.com/ CopyCAD] - Reverse Engineering software </br>[http://www.ps-exchange.com/ Exchange] - The CAD translation solution </br>[http://www.artcam.com/ ArtCAM] - Provides a unique CAD modelling and CNC CAM machining solution </br>[http://www.artcaminsignia.com/ ArtCAM Insignia] - The easiest professional CNC routing and engraving software </br>[http://www.artcaminsigniae.com/ ArtCAM Insignia E] - Insignia E is an entry level 2D routing package </br>[http://www.artcamjewelsmith.com/ ArtCAM JewelSmith] - Software to design and manufacture jewellery quickly and easily </br>[http://www.millwizard.com/ MillWizard] - Create real 3D objects from your favourite 3D modelling program using the ArtCAM MillWizard software </br>[http://www.dental-cadcam.com/ Dental Solutions] - CAD modelling and cam machining solutions for the dental industry </br>[http://www.orthotics-cadcam.com/ Orthotics Solutions] - CAD CAM software for the manufacturing needs of bespoke orthotics and orthopaedic footwear </br>[http://www.orthopaedic-cadcam.com/ Orthopaedic Solutions] - CAD CAM software tailor made for the Orthopaedic Industry. </br>[http://www.psteam.com/ PS-Team] - An EPM, project management and programme management solution ==Parallel Processing in PowerMILL 10: A White Paper== Delcam have released a White Paper explaining Parallel Processing in PowerMILL 10, available free of charge from Delcam at http://www.powermill.com/general/powermill.asp.
