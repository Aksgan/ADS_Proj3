after the book. The series' philosophical and psychological subtext draws influence from the ideas of Søren Kierkegaard as well as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], both of whom are associated with [[existentialism]], a recurring philosophical slant in the series. * In the manga "High School of the Dead", chapter 10, you can see Busujima Saeko reading Sickness unto death on her spare time. * In Spooks Sir Harry Pearce mentions the book to Lucas North in an ironic happening, Sir Pearce talks about the antagonist losing herself, however the same thing has happened to Lucas North. * In the [[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]] episode ''[[Jose Chung's Doomsday Defense]]'', Chung notes that while reading ''The Sickness Unto Death'', [[L. Ron Hubbard|Juggernaut Onan Goopta]] became sick himself and almost died. ==External links== {{Wikiquote}} * [http://www.religion-online.org/showbook.asp?title=2067 Online Text of this work] * [http://sorenkierkegaard.org/sickness-unto-death.html Commentary] {{Kierkegaard}} [[Category:1849 books|Sickness Unto Death]] [[Category:Books by Søren Kierkegaard|Sickness Unto Death]] [[Category:Christian philosophy|Sickness Unto Death]] [[Category:Psychology books|Sickness Unto Death]] [[cs:Nemoc k smrti]] [[da:Sygdommen til Døden]] [[de:Die Krankheit zum Tode]] [[ko:죽음에 이르는 병]] [[ja:死に至る病]] [[no:Sygdommen til Døden]] [[pt:O Desespero Humano]] [[zh:致死的疾病]]</text> </page> <page> <id>37469</id> <title>The Sleuth Kit</title> <text>{{Infobox software | name = The Sleuth Kit | logo = | screenshot = | caption = | collapsible = | author = Brian Carrier | developer = | released = | latest release version = 3.1.1 | latest release date = {{release date|2010|03|31}} | latest preview version = | latest preview date = | frequently updated = | programming language = [[C (programming language)|C]], [[Perl]] | operating system = [[Unix-like]], Windows | platform = | size = | language = | status = | genre = [[Computer forensics]] | license = [[IBM Public License|IPL]], [[Common Public License|CPL]], [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] | website = http://www.sleuthkit.org/ }} '''The Sleuth Kit''' (TSK) is a library and collection of [[Unix]]- and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-based tools and utilities to allow for the forensic analysis of computer systems. It was written and maintained by digital investigator Brian Carrier. TSK can be used to perform investigations and data extraction from images of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]] and [[Unix]] computers. The Sleuth Kit is normally used in conjunction with its custom front-end application, [[Autopsy (software)|Autopsy]], to provide a user friendly interface. An alternative, newer interface is [[PTK Forensics]]. Several other tools also use TSK for file extraction. The Sleuth Kit is a [[Free software|free]], [[open source]] suite that provides a large number of specialized command-line based utilities. It is based on [[The Coroner's Toolkit]]. ==Tools== Some of the tools included in The Sleuth Kit include: * '''ils''' lists all [[Metadata (computing)|metadata]] entries, such as an [[Inode]]. * '''blkls''' displays data blocks within a [[Comparison of file systems|file system]] (formerly called dls). * '''fls''' lists allocated and unallocated file names within a file system. * '''fsstat''' displays file system statistical information about an image or storage medium. * '''ffind''' searches for file names that point to a specified metadata entry. * '''mactime''' creates a timeline of all files based upon their [[MAC times]]. * '''disk_stat''' (currently Linux-only) discovers the existence of a [[Host Protected Area]]. ==See also== {{Portal|Free software}} *[[Selective file dumper]] *[[The Coroner's Toolkit]] ==External links== * [http://www.sleuthkit.org/ The Sleuth Kit Official website] * [http://www.sleuthkit.org/informer/ The Sleuth Kit Informer newsletter] * [http://wiki.sleuthkit.org/ Sleuth Kit Wiki] {{DEFAULTSORT:Sleuth Kit}} [[Category:Computer forensics]] [[Category:Free security software]] [[Category:Unix security-related software]] [[Category:Hard disk software]] [[Category:Digital forensics software]] {{software-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>37477</id> <title>The Steam Man of the Prairies</title> <text>'''''The Steam Man of the Prairies''''' by [[Edward S.
