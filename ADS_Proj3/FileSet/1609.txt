New features are added to the development branch of GIMP, when the developers decide that there are enough new features they begin the process of creating a release. The process starts off by creating an unstable branch from the development branch; this unstable branch will be stabilized and will receive bug-fixes until it is ready to replace the existing stable branch. GIMP has adopted a scheme also used by many other [[free and open source software|FOSS]] projects: the second number in a version (for example, the "6" in 2.6.11) denotes whether a GIMP release is stable or unstable. An odd number means an unstable version and an even number means a stable version. The final number represents the number of bug-fix releases after a stable or unstable branch is released. {{As of|2010|10}}, the current stable version of GIMP is 2.6.11. Each year GIMP applies for several positions in the [[Google Summer of Code]] (GSoC),<ref name="gimp-gsoc"> {{cite web |title=SummerOfCode - Wilber's Wiki |url=http://wiki.gimp.org/gimp/SummerOfCode |date=2009-04-30 |work=Wilber's Wiki |publisher=GIMP developers |accessdate=2009-06-30 }}</ref><ref name="gsoc-gimp-2009"> {{cite web |title=GNU Image Manipulation Program |url=http://socghop.appspot.com/org/home/google/gsoc2009/gimp |year=2009 |work=Google Summer of Code 2009 |publisher=Google |accessdate=2009-06-30}} </ref> to date GIMP has participated in all years except 2007.<ref name="list-gimpdev-2007gsoc"> {{cite web |title=GSoc 2007 - we didn't make it... |url=http://lists.xcf.berkeley.edu/lists/gimp-developer/2007-March/017493.html |date=Thu Mar 15 05:01:42 PDT 2007 |work=lists.xcf.berkeley.edu:gimp-developer |publisher=Michael Schumacher |accessdate=2009-06-30}} </ref> From 2006 to 2009 there have been 9 GSoC projects that have been listed as successful,<ref name="gimp-gsoc" /> although not all successful projects have been merged into GIMP yet. The healing brush and perspective clone tools and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] bindings were created as part of the 2006 GSoC and can be used in the current version of GIMP, although there were three other projects that were completed and are not yet available in a stable version of GIMP; those projects being Vector Layers, a [[JPEG 2000]] plug-in. Several projects were completed in 2008, but none are yet a part of a stable release of GIMP. ====Libre Graphics Meetings==== {{Main|Libre Graphics Meeting}} The Libre Graphics Meeting (LGM) is a yearly event where developers of GIMP and other projects meet up to discuss issues related to free and open source graphics software. The GIMP developers take the opportunity to hold [[Birds of a Feather (computing)|birds of a feather]] (BOF) sessions at this event. ====Distribution==== GIMP is released as [[source code]] under the [[GNU General Public License]] as [[free software]].<ref> {{cite web |title=GNU General Public License |url=http://www.gimp.org/about/COPYING |date=June 1991 |work=license |publisher=Free Software Foundation |accessdate=2009-06-29 }} </ref> The current version of GIMP works with numerous operating systems, including [[GNU]]/[[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]] and Microsoft Windows. Many GNU/Linux distributions include GIMP as a part of their desktop operating systems, including [[Debian]] and [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]]. Due to file size constraints, [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] no longer includes GIMP by default as of Ubuntu 10.04, but it remains available for installation via the package manager. A port of GIMP to Microsoft Windows was started by Tor Lillqvist in 1997. The GIMP website links to binary installers compiled by Jernej Simončič for the platform.<ref>{{cite web |title=GIMP - Windows installers |url=http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/ |publisher=The gimp-win project |accessdate=2 July 2009}}</ref> MacPorts is listed as the recommended provider of recent Mac builds of GIMP,<ref> {{cite web |title=GIMP for Mac OS X |url=http://www.gimp.org/macintosh/ GIMP download/Macintosh |date=2001-2009 |publisher=The GIMP Project |accessdate=2 July 2009}} </ref> MacPorts also provides builds of other [[free and open source software]] applications and provides tools to make doing so simpler.<ref> {{cite web |title=The MacPorts Project -- Home |url=http://www.macports.org/ |date=2002–2009 |publisher=MacPorts |accessdate=2 July 2009}} </ref> Mac OS X can optionally use an X11 server; GTK+ was originally designed to run on an X11 server, as such porting GIMP to Mac OS X was much simpler than creating a Windows port. There is no stable 64-bit Windows distribution version of GIMP available as of December 2009, although there have been experimental 64-bit versions like GIMP 2.6.8 for Windows.<ref>{{cite web |title=GIMP 2.6.8 for Win64 |url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/gimp-win/files/GIMP%20%2B%20GTK%2B%20%28stable%20release%29/GIMP%202.6.8%20%2B%20GTK%2B%202.16.6/gimp-2.6.8-x64-setup.exe/download |date=2009-12-10 |accessdate=2010-11-12}}</ref> ==See also== {{Portal|Free software}} * [[Comparison of raster graphics editors]] * [[Image editing]] * [[Libre Graphics Meeting]] * [[Linux color management]] * [[List of raster graphics editors]] ==References== {{Reflist|colwidth=30em}} ==External links== {{Wikibooks |GIMP}} {{Commons |GIMP}} * [http://www.gimp.org/ Official GIMP website] * [http://portableapps.com/apps/graphics_pictures/gimp_portable/ Portable GIMP] * {{dmoz|Computers/Software/Graphics/Image_Editing/The_GIMP/}} * Resources to learn GIMP ** Official GIMP user manual [http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/ (English)] or [http://manual.gimp.org/ (other languages)] ** [http://apress.com/book/view/9781430228417 (book) {{cite book |last=Montabone |first=Sebastian |year=2010 |title=Beginning Digital Image Processing: Using Free Tools for Photographers |publisher=Apress |isbn=9781430228417 }} ] ** [http://gimp-savvy.com/BOOK (book) Grokking the GIMP] ** [http://www.apress.com/book/view/9781430210702 (book) ''Beginning GIMP: From Novice to Professional, Second Edition''--a new book covering 2.4 and previewing 2.6] * GIMP news, and news aggregation ** {{Freshmeat|gimp|GIMP}} * Wilber (the GIMP mascot) links ** [http://www.gimp.org/about/linking.html Wilber images] at the GIMP homepage (''near bottom'') ** [http://web.archive.org/web/20070929112000/http://blinkenlights.de/images/arcade/live/live-arcade-wilber-quai-large.jpg Wilber] on the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] (photo taken at a [[Project Blinkenlights]] installation in [[Paris]]) {{Raster graphics editors}} {{GNU}} {{FLOSS}} {{Use dmy dates|date=September 2010}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Gimp (Gnu Image Manipulation Program)}} [[Category:1996 software]] [[Category:AmigaOS 4 software]] [[Category:GNU Project software]] [[Category:Free bitmap graphics editors]] [[Category:Free photo software]] [[Category:Free graphics software]] [[Category:Graphic design]] [[Category:Technical communication tools]] [[Category:Raster graphics editors]] [[Category:Linux bitmap graphics editors]] [[Category:Free software programmed in C]] [[Category:Applications using D-Bus]] [[Category:Free cross-platform software]] [[Category:Free multilingual software]] [[Category:IRIX software]] [[Category:Mac OS software]] [[Category:Mac OS X software]] [[Category:Windows software]] [[Category:Portable software]] [[ar:برنامج جنو لمعالجة الصور]] [[ast:GIMP]] [[bn:গিম্প]] [[bs:GIMP]] [[br:GIMP]] [[bg:GIMP]] [[ca:GIMP]] [[cs:GIMP]] [[da:GIMP]] [[de:GIMP]] [[et:GIMP]] [[el:GIMP]] [[es:GIMP]] [[eo:GIMP]] [[eu:GIMP]] [[fa:گیمپ]] [[fr:GIMP]] [[gl:GIMP]] [[ko:김프]] [[hr:GIMP]] [[id:GIMP]] [[is:GIMP]] [[it:GIMP]] [[he:GIMP]]
