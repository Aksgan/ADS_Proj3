According to Kaspersky, "Kaspersky Security Network service allows users of Kaspersky Lab security products from around the world to help facilitate [[malware]] identification and reduce the time it takes to provide protection against new (“in the wild”) security risks targeting your computer."

In addition, Kaspersky Anti-Virus prevents itself from being disabled by malware without user permission via password access prompts upon disabling protection elements and changing internal settings. It also scans incoming [[instant messenger]] traffic, automatically disables links to known [[malware]] hosting sites while using [[Internet Explorer]] or [[Firefox]] and includes free Technical Support and free product upgrades within paid-subcription periods. [[Kaspersky Lab]] currently offers 1 year, 2 year and 3 year subscriptions. ==Awards== According to AV-Comparatives, Kaspersky Anti-Virus rates highly amongst virus scanners in terms of detection rates, even despite the fact that the program has failed two [[Virus Bulletin]] tests in 2007 and another two in 2008.<ref>http://www.virusbtn.com/vb100/archive/results?vendor=VE15</ref> In addition, [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] awarded Kaspersky Anti-Virus 6 the Editor's Choice in its 2007 anti-virus comparative<ref>http://www.pcworld.com/article/130869/top_antivirus_performers.html</ref>.
