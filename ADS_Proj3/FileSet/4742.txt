the media can be tracked in a [[Cache algorithms|least recently used]] queue of some sort. The data structures for the queue itself must either be stored off-device or in such a way that the space it uses is itself wear-leveled or, in the case of flash memory, in a block with a specially extended life. [[Msystems|M-Systems']] product [[DiskOnChip]] used a software driver named [[Flash_file_system#TrueFFS|TrueFFS]] which performed wear-leveling of [[NAND flash]] chips and made them appear to OS like a conventional disk drive. On most contemporary flash memory devices, such as [[CompactFlash]] and [[Secure Digital card|Secure Digital]] cards, these techniques are implemented in hardware by a built-in [[microcontroller]]. On such devices, wear leveling is [[Transparency (computing)|transparent]] and most conventional file systems can be used as-is on them. Wear leveling can also be implemented in software by special-purpose file systems such as [[JFFS2]] and [[YAFFS]] on flash media or [[Universal Disk Format|UDF]] on optical media. All three are [[log-structured file system]]s in that they treat their media as circular logs and write to them in sequential passes. File systems which implement [[Copy-on-write]] strategies, such as [[ZFS]], also implement a form of wear leveling. == See also == * [[Flash file system]] * [[Write amplification]] == References == <references /> == External links == *[http://www.bitmicro.com/press_resources_flash_ssd.php Flash SSD wear-leveling and error-correction description by BiTMICRO.] {{Template:Solid-state Drive}} [[Category:Computer memory]] [[Category:Non-volatile memory]] [[Category:Flash file systems]] [[Category:Solid-state computer storage]] [[de:Wear-Leveling]] [[fr:Wear levelling]] [[ja:ウェアレベリング]] [[pl:Równoważenie zużycia]]</text> </page> <page> <id>39904</id> <title>Web-based taxonomy</title> <text>'''Web-based taxonomy''' is the effort by [[alpha taxonomy|taxonomists]] to use the [[World Wide Web]] in order to create unified, consensus taxonomies of life on Earth. In his 2002 paper on the subject<ref>[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v417/n6884/full/417017a.html Godfray, H.C.J (2002). Challenges for taxonomy. ''Nature'' 417: 17-19]</ref>, [[H. Charles J. Godfray]] called for the creation of Web-based organisations to collect all the accumulated literature on a taxonomic group into a centralized knowledge base and make this data available through the Web as a unified taxonomy, so that it can be more easily examined and revised. Such a platform would be owned and maintained by a taxonomic working group, governed by an editor or an editorial board. An example of such a platform is [[FishBase]]. The notion of Web-based consensus taxonomies remains controversial because, as two Australian researchers pointed out<ref>{{cite journal | author = [[Kevin Thiele|Thiele, Kevin]] and David Yeates | year = 2002 | title = Tension arises from duality at the heart of taxonomy | journal = Nature | issue = 419 | doi = 10.1038/419337a | pages = 337 | volume = 419 | pmid = 12353005}}</ref>, taxonomic names are not fixed but hypotheses, and therefore in constant change. == References == <references /> == See also == * [[Biodiversity Informatics]] ==External links== *[http://www.cate-project.org/ CATE Project] *[http://www.eol.org/ Encyclopedia of Life] *[http://www.catalogueoflife.org Species 2000 / ITIS Catalogue of Life] [[Category:Scientific classification]] [[Category:Taxonomy]] [[Category:World Wide Web]]</text> </page> <page> <id>39911</id> <title>WebCrow</title> <text>{{orphan|date=January 2010}} The '''WebCrow''' is a research project carried out at the [[Information Engineering]] of the [[University of Siena]] with the purpose of automatically solving [[crosswords]]. {{TOC limit|limit=2}} ==The Project== The scientific relevance of the project can be understood considering that cracking crosswords requires human-level knowledge. Unlike chess and related games and there is no [[Closed world assumption|closed world]] [[configuration space]]. Interestingly, a first nucleus of technology, such as [[search engine]]s, information retrieval, and machine learning techniques enable computers to enfold with semantics real-life concepts. The project is based on a software system whose major assumption is to attack crosswords making use of the Web as its primary source of knowledge. WebCrow is very fast and often thrashes human challengers in competitions <ref name="COMP">G.Angelini, M. Ernandes, E. Di Iorio, "[http://webcrow.dii.unisi.it/webpage/previous_comp.html WebCrow: Previous competitions]"</ref>, especially on multi language crossword schemes. A distinct feature of the WebCrow software system is to combine properly [[natural language processing]] (NLP) techniques, the [[Google]] [[world Wide Web|web]] search engine, and [[constraint satisfaction]] algorithms from artificial intelligence to acquire knowledge and to fill the schema. The most important component of WebCrow is the Web Search Module (WSM), which implements a domain specific web based [[question answering]] algorithm. The way WebCrow approaches crosswords solving is quite with respect to humans <ref>John S. Quarterman,"[http://riskman.typepad.com/perilocity/2006/09/google_as_ai.html Google as AI]"</ref>: Whereas we tend to first answer clues we are sure of and then proceed filling the schema by exploiting the already answered clues as hints, WebCrow uses two clearly distinct stages. In the first one, it processes all the clues and tries to answer them all: For each clue it finds many possible candidates and sorts them according to complex [[ranking]] models mainly based on a probability criteria. In the second stage, WebCrow uses constraint satisfaction algorithms to fill the grid with the overall most likely combination of clue answers. In order to interact with Google, first of all, WebCrow needs to compose queries on the basis of the given clues. This is done by [[query expansion]], whose purpose is to convert the clue into a query expressed by a simplified and more appropriate language for Google. The retrieved documents are parsed so as to extract a list of word candidates that are congruent with the crossword length constraints. Crosswords can hardly be faced by using encyclopedic knowledge only, since many clues are wordplays or are otherwise purposefully very ambiguous. This enigmatic component of crosswords is faced by a massive use of database of solved crosswords, and by automatic reasoning on a properly organized knowledge base of wired rules. Last but not the least, the final constraint satisfaction step is very effective to fill the correct candidate, even though, unlike humans, the system can not rely on very high confidence on the correctness of the answer. ==Competitions== WebCrow speed and effectiveness <ref name="TNS">Tom Simonite, "[http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9888-crossword-software-thrashes-human-challengers.html Crossword Software Thrashes Human Challengers]", ''New Scientist''</ref> has been tested many times in man-machine competitions <ref name="COMP"/> on Italian, English and multi-language crosswords The outcome of the tests is that WebCrow can successfully compete with average human players on single language schemes and reaches expert level performance in multi-language crosswords.
