Leonard received his [[B.S.]] in [[Electrical Engineering]] from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1987 and his [[Ph.D.]] in [[Engineering Science]] from the [[University of Oxford]] in 1994, under the [[Thouron Fellowship]]. He spent five years as a [[postdoctoral fellow]] and [[Research Scientist]] in the MIT Sea Grant Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Laboratory, and joined the MIT faculty in 1996. Leonard has served as an associate editor of the IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering and of the IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation. He received the [[National Science Foundation]] Career Award in 1998, an E.T.S. Walton Visitor Award from [[Science Foundation Ireland]] in 2004, and the King-Sun Fu Memorial Best IEEE Transactions on Robotics Paper Award in 2006. Leonard describes his primary research goal as persistent autonomy, i.e., the "capability for one or more robots to operate robustly for days, weeks and months at a time with minimal human supervision, in complex, dynamic environments".<ref>http://cml.mit.edu/~jleonard/</ref> Leonard focuses on the problem of [[simultaneous localization and mapping]] (SLAM), particularly for [[autonomous underwater vehicle]]s (AUV). ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== * [http://cml.mit.edu/~jleonard/ Home page] * [http://grandchallenge.mit.edu/index.shtml MIT DGC home] {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME = Leonard, John J. | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH = | PLACE OF BIRTH = | DATE OF DEATH = | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Leonard, John J.}} [[Category:Roboticists]] [[Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty]] [[Category:Control theorists]] [[Category:Living people]]</text> </page> <page> <id>20032</id> <title>John Krogstie</title> <text>'''John Krogstie''' (23 May 1967) is a Norwegian [[computer scientist]], professor in information systems at the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]] (NTNU) in Trondheim, Norway, and an expert in the field of [[enterprise modelling]]. == Biography ==
