In addition, papers in this repository are classified according to the ACM subject classification. {{DEFAULTSORT:Acm Computing Classification System}} [[Category:1964 introductions]] [[Category:Classification systems]] [[Category:Computer science literature]] [[Category:ACM publications|*Computing Classification System]] [[Category:Association for Computing Machinery|Computing Classification System]] {{comp-sci-stub}} [[de:CR Classification]]</text> </page> <page> <id>292</id> <title>ACM Crossroads</title> <text>{{Infobox magazine | title = XRDS: Crossroads, The ACM Magazine for Students | image_file = <!-- cover.jpg (omit the "file: prefix --> | image_size = <!-- 220px (the default if no size is stated) --> | image_alt = | image_caption = | editor = Chris Harrison | editor_title = | previous_editor = | staff_writer = | frequency = Quarterly | circulation = | category = [[Computer Science]] | company = | publisher = [[Association for Computing Machinery]] | firstdate = Fall 1994<!-- {{Start date|year|month|day}} --> | country = | based = | language = English | website = http://xrds.acm.org/<!-- {{URL|example.com}} --> | issn = 1528-4972 }} '''''XRDS: Crossroads, The ACM Magazine for Students''''', formerly called ''Crossroads'', is a quarterly [[computer science]] magazine for students, published in both print and electronic forms by the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] or ACM. The full text of every issue is available online to ACM members, with many articles selected by the editorial staff open to the general public. The first edition was published in 1994<sup>(ACM 2010)</sup>. It is run by students and supported by ACM headquarters staff, and accepts unsolicited submissions of articles targeting student readers<sup>(ACM 2010b)</sup>. ''Crossroads'' was ACM's first electronically produced publication. The magazine is distributed internationally. Issues exist for every quarter since Fall 1994, with a few extra, mid-Summer, issues <sup>(ACM 2010c)</sup>. ==List of editors-in-chief== {| class=wikitable style="text-align:center" ! # !

Prior to the makeover, the format of the magazine is similar to that of its more illustrious cousin, the [[Communications of the ACM]] where articles are summaries of interesting research papers. With the Summer 2010 issue of XRDS, ACM inaugurates a completely revamped edition of the magazine. Targeted to both graduate and undergraduate students contemplating computing careers, the newly redesigned XRDS offers breaking news and information, practical career advice, and first-hand stories and profiles of people on the front lines of the burgeoning computing field. The new magazine and its website http://XRDS.acm.org reflect the real voices of today’s students, and will create a hub of interaction and communication for them to access. XRDS has been designed as an easy-access resource for students who are focused on their futures. Readers now have a convenient channel to find valuable content not only on their field of study but on the student experience as well. With the magazines’ new website, students now have a central place where they can share their ideas and experiences through interactive features and by submitting articles for publication. == References == *{{cite web| author=XRDS staff| title=Information about XRDS: Crossroads, The ACM Magazine for Students| url=http://xrds.acm.org/about.cfm| accessdate=2010-10-13| year=2010| author=ACM| publisher=Association for Computing Machinery }} *{{cite web| title=XRDS Author Guidelines| year=2010b<!-- 10-13 -->| accessdate=2010-10-13| url=http://xrds.acm.org/authorguidelines.cfm | author=XRDS editorial staff| publisher=Association for Computing Machinery| }} *{{cite web| title=XRDS: Crossroads: Magazine Archives| year=2010c<!-- 10-13 -->|| url=http://xrds.acm.org/archives.cfm| author=XRDS editorial staff| publisher=Association for Computing Machinery| accessdate=2010-10-13 }} *{{cite web| title=XRDS: Crossroads: About Us| year=2010d<!-- 10-13 -->|| url=http://xrds.acm.org/aboutus.cfm| author=XRDS editorial staff| publisher=Association for Computing Machinery| accessdate=2010-10-28 }} == External links == * {{Officialb|=http://xrds.acm.org}} [[Category:ACM publications|XRDS]] [[es:ACM Crossroads]]</text> </page> <page> <id>295</id> <title>ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest</title> <text>[[Image:Icpc logo.png|thumb|right|ACM ICPC logo]] '''ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest''' (abbreviated as '''ACM-ICPC''' or just '''ICPC''') is an annual multi-tiered computer programming competition among the universities of the world. The contest is sponsored by [[IBM]]. Headquartered at [[Baylor University]], with autonomous regions on six continents, the ICPC is directed by Baylor Professor William B. Poucher, Executive Director, and operates under the auspices of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM). ==History== The ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest, [[ICPC]], traces its roots to a competition held at [[Texas A&M University]] in 1970 hosted by the Alpha Chapter of the [[Upsilon Pi Epsilon]] Computer Science Honor Society (UPE). The contest evolved into its present form as a multi-tier competition in 1977, with the first finals held in conjunction with the ACM Computer Science Conference. From 1977 to 1989, the contest included mainly teams from [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Canada]]. Headquartered at [[Baylor University]] since 1989, with regionals established within the world's university community, operating under the auspices of ACM, and with substantial industry support, the ICPC has grown into a worldwide competition with teams from 84 countries in 2005. Since the beginning of [[IBM]]'s sponsorship in 1997, contest participation has grown enormously. In 1997, 840 teams from 560 universities participated. In 2007, 6,700 teams from 1,821 universities participated. The number of teams keeps increasing by 10-20% every year and future competitions may be even larger. The World Finals of the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest World Finals, ACM-ICPC World Finals, is the final round of competition. Over its history it has become a 4-day event held in the finest venues worldwide. [[Upsilon Pi Epsilon|UPE]] recognizes all of the regional champions at the event. Recent World Champion teams have been recognized by their country's head of state and at the annual ACM Awards Ceremony. ==Contest rules== The ICPC is a team competition. Current
