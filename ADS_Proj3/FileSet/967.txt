According to Reed's Office of Admissions, "Reed College has actively questioned the methodology and usefulness of college rankings ever since the magazine's best-colleges list first appeared in 1983, despite the fact that the issue ranked Reed among the top ten national liberal arts colleges. Reed's concern intensified with disclosures in 1994 by the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' about institutions flagrantly manipulating data in order to move up in the rankings in U.S. News and other popular college guides. This led Reed's then-president Steven Koblik to inform the editors of U.S. News that he didn't find their project credible, and that the college would not be returning any of their surveys." <ref name="College Rankings">{{cite web | title = College Rankings | publisher = Reed College Admission Office | url = http://web.reed.edu/apply/news_and_articles/college_rankings.html }}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', in its 16 October 1997 issue, argued that Reed's rankings were artificially decreased by ''U.S. News'' after they stopped sending data to ''[[U.S. News and World Report]].'' <ref>{{cite web | first = Harriet | last =Watson| title = U.S. News and World Report hat trick | publisher = [[Reed College]] | month = November | year = 1997 | url= http://web.reed.edu/reed_magazine/nov1997/news/3.html}}</ref> Reed has also made the same claim.<ref name="College Rankings"/> In discussing Reed's decision, President [[Colin Diver]] wrote in an article for the November 2005 issue of the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]],'' "by far the most important consequence of sitting out the rankings game, however, is the freedom to pursue our own educational philosophy, not that of some newsmagazine." <ref>{{cite web | first = Colin | last = Diver | title = Is There Life After Rankings? | publisher = [[The Atlantic Monthly]] | month = November | year = 2005 | url= http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200511/shunning-college-rankings }}</ref> ==Stanford University, FUNC, and Alma College== Associated Students of [[Stanford University]] (ASSU) Vice-President, Nicholas Thompson, founded FUNC or "Forget ''U.S. News'' Coalition" in 1996 as a show of support for [[Reed College]]'s decision not to participate in the ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' survey.<ref>{{cite web | first =Nick | last =Thompson | title =Down With Rankings!| publisher = Summit: Stanford's Newsmagazine of Progressive Politics | date = 25 October 1996 | url= http://www.stanford.edu/group/summit/summit1/stanford.html#rankings}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | first = | last = | title =Stanford Students Attack"U.S. News" College Rankings| publisher = [[Chronicle of Higher Education]] | date = 25 October 1996 | url= http://chronicle.com/che-data/articles.dir/art-43.dir/issue-09.dir/09a04302.htm}}</ref> FUNC eventually spread to other colleges and universities and was composed of a "group of students at universities across the country who argue that ranking something as complex and variable as a college education with a single number is an oversimplification. FUNC claims that the process makes college administrations focus on numerical rankings rather than on educating students." <ref>{{cite web | first =Jeff | last =Garigliano | title =U.S. News college rankings rankle critics - Forget U.S. News Coalition is pressuring U.S. News and World Report to cease publishing overall rankings for colleges| publisher = Folio | date = 15 March 1997 | url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3065/is_n4_v26/ai_19170446/print}}</ref> FUNC also involved then-Stanford President [[Gerhard Casper]]. On 23 September 1996, Casper sent a letter to James Fallows, editor of ''U.S. News & World Report,'' stating, "As the president of a university that is among the top-ranked universities, I hope I have the standing to persuade you that much about these rankings - particularly their specious formulas and spurious precision - is utterly misleading." <ref>{{cite web | first = Gerhard | last = Casper| title =Letter from Casper Gerhard to James Fallows, editor of ''U.S. News & World Report''| publisher = [[Stanford University]] | date = 18 April 1997 | url= http://www.stanford.edu/dept/pres-provost/president/speeches/961206gcfallow.html}}</ref> In January 1997, then-president of [[Alma College]], Alan Stone, asked 480 colleges to boycott the ''[[U.S. News and World Report]] Rankings'' due to the peer assessment survey which counts for 25% of a college's ranking. According to the ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]],'' in 1996, Alma College surveyed 158 colleges about the rankings. The result of the survey indicated that "84 per cent of the respondents admitted that they were unfamiliar with some of the institutions they had been asked to rank. Almost 44 per cent indicated that they 'tended to leave responses for unfamiliar schools blank.' " Stone stated, "this makes me wonder just how many votes are being considered for each school's academic-reputation ranking." <ref>{{cite news | first=| last=| url=http://chronicle.com/che-data/articles.dir/art-43.dir/issue-21.dir/21a02702.htm| title=Alma College's President Urges Boycott of "U.S. News" Rankings| work=|publisher=[[Chronicle of Higher Education]] | date= 1997-01-31| accessdate=2007-06-22 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930153627/http://chronicle.com/che-data/articles.dir/art-43.dir/issue-21.dir/21a02702.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news
