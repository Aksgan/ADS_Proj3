In particular, it is used to refer to the theft of a [[magic cookie]] used to authenticate a user to a remote server. It has particular relevance to [[web developer]]s, as the [[HTTP cookie]]s used to maintain a session on many web sites can be easily stolen by an attacker using an intermediary computer or with access to the saved cookies on the victim's computer (see [[HTTP_cookie#Cookie_theft|HTTP cookie theft]]). TCP session hijacking is when a hacker takes over a TCP session between two machines. Since most authentication only occurs at the start of a TCP session, this allows the hacker to gain access to a machine. A popular method is using [[Source_routing|source-routed]] IP packets. This allows a hacker at point A on the network to participate in a conversation between B and C by encouraging the IP packets to pass through its machine. If source-routing is turned off, the hacker can use "blind" hijacking, whereby it guesses the responses of the two machines. Thus, the hacker can send a command, but can never see the response. However, a common command would be to set a password allowing access from somewhere else on the net. A hacker can also be "inline" between B and C using a sniffing program to watch the conversation. This is known as a "[[man-in-the-middle attack]]". A common component of such an attack is to execute a [[denial-of-service]] (DoS) attack against one end-point to stop it from responding. This attack can be either against the machine to force it to crash, or against the network connection to force heavy packet loss. ==History== Session hijacking was not possible with early versions of HTTP. HTTP protocol versions 0.8 and 0.9 lacked cookies and other features necessary for session hijacking within the HTTP protocol did not exist in webservers or browsers. Version 0.9beta of Mosaic Netscape, released on October 13, 1994, supported cookies. Early versions of HTTP 1.0 did have some security weaknesses relating to session hijacking, but they were difficult to exploit due to the vagaries of most early HTTP 1.0 servers and browsers. As HTTP 1.0 has been designated as a fallback for HTTP 1.1 since the early 2000s -- and as HTTP 1.0 servers are all essentially HTTP 1.1 servers the session hijacking problem has evolved into a nearly permanent security risk. The introduction of supercookies and other features with the modernized HTTP 1.1 has allowed for the hijacking problem to become an ongoing security problem.
