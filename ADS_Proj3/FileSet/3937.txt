A quick system to show the searcher [[Computer shortcut|shortcut]]s, while the query is typed. Before the query has been typed, a drop-down list with the suggested complete search queries, is given as options to select and access. The suggested queries then enable the searcher to complete the required search quickly. It is a form of [[Autocomplete|autocompletion]] while typing into a query [[text box]], before a detailed search result is entered. Lists can be based on popular searches or other options. The [[Computer science|computing science]] of [[syntax]] and [[algorithm]]s are used to form search results from data or a [[database]], with search suggested drop-down lists being a common industry standard for an instant search. Search suggested lists are used by [[internet browsers]], [[website]]s and [[search engine]]s, local [[operating system]]s and [[database]]s. [[Content management system]]s and frequent searches can assist [[Software engineering|software engineers]] in [[Optimization (computer science)|optimizing]] more refined queries with methods of parameters and subroutines. Suggestions can be results for the current query or related queries by words, time and dates, categories and [[Tag (metadata)|tags]]. The suggestion list may be reordered by other options, as [[Enumeration|enumerative]], [[Hierarchical organization|hierarchical]] or [[Faceted classification|faceted]]. ==See also == *[[Search engine (computing)]] *[[Search algorithm]] ==External links== *[http://www.sematext.com/demo/ac/index.html Search Suggest demo] -- [[Solr]]-based demo with Wikipedia titles {{DEFAULTSORT:Search Suggest Drop-Down List}} [[Category:Data search engines]] [[Category:Information retrieval]] [[Category:Search algorithms]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33552</id> <title>Second language writing</title> <text>{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}} Second-language [[writing]] is the name usually given to the study of writing performed by non-native speakers/writers of a [[language]], whether as a true second or [[foreign language]]. In addition to disseminating research through the [[Journal of Second Language Writing]], scholars in the field regular participate in three academic conferences, the Symposium on Second Language Writing, the [[TESOL]] convention, and the Conference on College Composition and [[Communication]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} ==Symposium on Second Language Writing== The Symposium on Second Language Writing, which began in 1998 at [[Purdue University]], is an international conference on second language writing.It was a biennial event through 2006, and annuallly after that. It has been hosted at Purdue University six times, but the 2007 symposium was held in [[Japan]], and the 2009 was held at [[Arizona State University]]. The 2010 will be held in Murcia, Spain <ref>Symposium on Second Language Writing. (n.d.). Retrieved October 5, 2008, from http://sslw.asu.edu/</ref> ==Second Language Writing at TESOL, Inc.== In June 2005, the TESOL Board added of a new interest section on writing. The '''Second Language Writing IS'''; it held its first meeting in [[Tampa]] in March 2006, covering topics ranging from “Broadening Perspectives in Second Language Writing” and “Alternative Placement Methods for Second Language Writers” to “Issues in Technologies for L2 Composition Classrooms” and “Crossing Bridges with Second Language Writing Partnerships.” As these suggest, the section provides a forum for researchers and [[educator]]s at different [[Educational stage|grade]] levels and institutional settings to discuss second language writing. Specifically, the section's goals are: * to increase awareness of the significance of writing in [[teaching]] [[ESL]]/EFL, * to encourage and support the teaching of writing to [[ESOL]] students at all levels, * to provide a forum to discuss issues of writing [[Educational assessment|assessment]] and the placement of second language writers, and * to disseminate and promote [[research]] on second language writing <ref>Second Language Writing Interest Section. (n.d.). Retrieved October 5, 2008, from http://secondlanguagewriting.com/slwis/</ref> The section facilitates [[communication]] about writing across teaching levels and settings. Recent research on the scope of second language writing scholarship suggests that most of the field’s nationally (within the U.S.) and internationally circulated scholarship is produced by scholars in post-secondary education at research intensive institutions. Other contexts for writing (Pre-K through 12, two-year colleges, community programs, international [[K-12]] schools, etc.) often have much larger populations of ELL/EFL writers, but scholars, particularly teacher-researchers, in these settings do not often receive support for researching and writing. Given this, the section provides scholars with the opportunity to initiate more research and scholarship in these underrepresented contexts by supporting new collaborations and partnerships across levels and by providing a forum for discussing shared experiences. The section, like its parent body, TESOL, is distinctive in including all the academic levels and areas. ==Second Language Writing at CCCC== Second language writing scholars also participate in a Special Interest Group on the field at CCCC <ref>[http://www.ncte.org/cccc]</ref>. In addition, the organization has a Committee on Second Language Writing to bridge work between CCCC and TESOL to involve more scholars in the field’s discussions. Much recent attention focuses on the potential of [[Computer-mediated communication]] (CMC) to foster desire and opportunity to write. ==See also== * [[Second language acquisition]] * [[Contrastive rhetoric]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.jslw.org/ Journal of Second Language Writing] *[http://sslw.asu.edu/ Symposium on Second Language Writing] {{DEFAULTSORT:Second Language Writing}} [[Category:Language acquisition]] [[Category:Writing]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33558</id> <title>Secondary source</title> <text>{{selfref|For the use of this term in Wikipedia's policies, see [[Wikipedia:No original research#Primary, secondary, and tertiary sources|Wikipedia:No original research]].}} In [[Scholarly method|scholarship]], a '''secondary source'''<ref>[http://www.lib.umd.edu/guides/primary-sources.html Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Sources, UM Libraries]</ref><ref>[http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml JCU - Primary, Secondary & Tertiary Sources]</ref> is a [[document]] or [[recording]] that relates or discusses [[information]] originally presented elsewhere.
