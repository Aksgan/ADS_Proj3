computation]] || [[Cryptography]] |} ===Applied mathematics=== [[Applied mathematics]] considers the use of abstract mathematical tools in solving concrete problems in the [[science]]s, [[business]], and other areas. Applied mathematics has significant overlap with the discipline of [[statistics]], whose theory is formulated mathematically, especially with [[probability theory]]. Statisticians (working as part of a research project) "create data that makes sense" with [[random sampling]] and with randomized [[design of experiments|experiments]]; the design of a statistical sample or experiment specifies the analysis of the data (before the data be available). When reconsidering data from experiments and samples or when analyzing data from [[observational study|observational studies]], statisticians "make sense of the data" using the art of [[statistical model|modelling]] and the theory of [[statistical inference|inference]] – with [[model selection]] and [[estimation]]; the estimated models and consequential [[Scientific method#Predictions from the hypothesis|predictions]] should be [[statistical hypothesis testing|tested]] on [[Scientific method#Evaluation and improvement|new data]].<ref>Like other mathematical sciences such as [[physics]] and [[computer science]], statistics is an autonomous discipline rather than a branch of applied mathematics. Like research physicists and computer scientists, research statisticians are mathematical scientists. Many statisticians have a degree in mathematics, and some statisticians are also mathematicians.</ref> [[Computational mathematics]] proposes and studies methods for solving [[mathematical problem]]s that are typically too large for human numerical capacity. [[Numerical analysis]] studies methods for problems in [[analysis (mathematics)|analysis]] using ideas of [[functional analysis]] and techniques of [[approximation theory]]; numerical analysis includes the study of [[approximation]] and [[discretization]] broadly with special concern for [[rounding error]]s. Other areas of computational mathematics include [[computer algebra]] and [[symbolic computation]]. {| style="border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:0 auto" cellspacing="20" |- | [[Image:Gravitation space source.png|96px]] || [[Image:BernoullisLawDerivationDiagram.svg|96px]] || [[Image:Composite trapezoidal rule illustration small.svg|96px]] || [[Image:Maximum boxed.png|96px]] || [[Image:Two red dice 01.svg|96px]] || [[Image:Oldfaithful3.png|96px]] |- | [[Mathematical physics]] || [[Fluid dynamics]] || [[Numerical analysis]] || [[Optimization (mathematics)|Optimization]] || [[Probability theory]] || [[Statistics]] |- | [[Image:Market Data Index NYA on 20050726 202628 UTC.png|96px]] || [[Image:Arbitrary-gametree-solved.svg|96px]] || [[Image:Signal transduction v1.png|96px]] || [[Image:Ch4-structure.png|96px]] || [[Image:GDP PPP Per Capita IMF 2008.png|96px]] || [[Image:Simple feedback control loop2.png|96px]] |- | [[Mathematical finance]] || [[Game theory]] || [[Mathematical biology]] || [[Mathematical chemistry]]|| [[Mathematical economics]] || [[Control theory]] |} ==Mathematics as profession== The best-known award in mathematics is the {{nowrap|[[Fields Medal]]}},<ref>"''The Fields Medal is now indisputably the best known and most influential award in mathematics.''" Monastyrsky</ref><ref>Riehm</ref> established in 1936 and now awarded every 4 years. It is often considered the equivalent of science's [[Nobel Prize]]s. The [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]], instituted in 1978, recognizes lifetime achievement, and another major international award, the [[Abel Prize]], was introduced in 2003. The [[Chern Medal]] was introduced in 2010 to recognize lifetime achievement. These are awarded for a particular body of work, which may be innovation, or resolution of an outstanding problem in an established field. A famous list of 23 [[open problem]]s, called "[[Hilbert's problems]]", was compiled in 1900 by German mathematician [[David Hilbert]]. This list achieved great celebrity among mathematicians, and at least nine of the problems have now been solved. A new list of seven important problems, titled the "[[Millennium Prize Problems]]", was published in 2000. Solution of each of these problems carries a $1 million reward, and only one (the [[Riemann hypothesis]]) is duplicated in Hilbert's problems. <!-- <<< ==Common misconceptions== {{Unreferenced section|date=August 2009}} {{Original research|date=August 2009}} Mathematics is not a closed intellectual system, in which everything has already been worked out. There is no shortage of [[unsolved problems in mathematics|open problems]]. Every month, mathematicians publish many thousands of papers that embody new discoveries in the field. Mathematics is not [[numerology]]; it is not concerned with "supernatural" properties of numbers. It is not [[accountancy]]; nor is it restricted to [[arithmetic]]. [[Pseudomathematics]] is a form of mathematics-like activity undertaken outside [[academia]], and occasionally by mathematicians themselves. It often consists of determined attacks on famous questions, consisting of proof-attempts made in an isolated way (that is, long papers not supported by previously published theory). The relationship to generally accepted mathematics is similar to that between [[pseudoscience]] and real science. The misconceptions involved are normally based on: * misunderstanding of the implications of [[mathematical rigor]]; * attempts to circumvent the usual criteria for publication of [[mathematical paper]]s in a [[learned journal]] after [[peer review]], often in the belief that the journal is biased against the author; * lack of familiarity with, and therefore underestimation of, the existing literature. Like [[astronomy]], mathematics owes much to [[List of amateur mathematicians|amateur contributors]] such as [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]] and [[Marin Mersenne|Mersenne]]. --> ==See also== {{Portal|Mathematics}} {{Wikipedia-Books}} {{Main|Lists of mathematics topics}} {{Div col|cols=2}} * [[Definitions of mathematics]] * [[Dyscalculia]] * [[Iatromathematicians]] * [[List of mathematics competitions]] * [[Mathematical anxiety]] * [[Mathematical game]] * [[Mathematical model]] * [[Mathematics and art]] * [[Mathematics education]] * [[Pseudomathematics]] {{Div col end}} ==Notes== {{Reflist|2}} ==References== {{refbegin|2}} * Benson, Donald C., ''The Moment of Proof: Mathematical Epiphanies'', [[Oxford University Press]], USA; New Ed edition (December 14, 2000).
