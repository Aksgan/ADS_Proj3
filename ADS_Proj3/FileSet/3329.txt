In 2001, 34,000 scholars around the world signed "An Open Letter to Scientific Publishers",<ref>[http://www.plos.org/about/letter.html Public Library of Science: Read the Open Letter]</ref> calling for "the establishment of an online public library that would provide the full contents of the published record of research and scholarly discourse in medicine and the life sciences in a freely accessible, fully searchable, interlinked form". Scientists signing the letter also pledged not to publish in or peer-review for non-open access journals. This led to the establishment of the [[Public Library of Science]], an advocacy organization. However, most scientists continued to publish and review for non-open access journals. PLoS decided to become an open access publisher aiming to compete at the high quality end of the scientific spectrum with commercial publishers and other open access journals, which were beginning to flourish <ref>[http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0000036 PLoS Biology - Why PLoS Became a Publisher]</ref>. Critics have argued that, equipped with a $10 million grant, PLoS competes with smaller OA journals for the best submissions and runs danger to destroy what it originally wanted to foster <ref>[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v441/n7096/full/441914a.html Open-access journal hits rocky times : Article : Nature<]</ref>. The ''first major international'' statement on open access<ref name=autogenerated5>[http://www.soros.org/openaccess/read.shtml Budapest Open Access Initiative]</ref> was the [[Budapest Open Access Initiative]] in February 2002, launched by the [[Open Society Institute]] .<ref>[http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/boaifaq.htm Budapest Open Access Initiative, FAQ]</ref> This provided a definition of open access, and has a growing list of signatories.<ref>[http://www.soros.org/openaccess/view.cfm Budapest Open Access Initiative]</ref> Two further statements followed: the Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing<ref>[http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/bethesda.htm Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing]</ref> in June 2003 and the [[Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities]] in October 2003. In 2003, the [[Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities]] was drafted and the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] included open access in its Declaration of Principles and Plan of Action. In 2006, a [[Federal Research Public Access Act]] was introduced in US Congress by senators [[John Cornyn]] and [[Joe Lieberman]].<ref>Robin Peek, [http://newsbreaks.infotoday.com/nbreader.asp?ArticleID=15852 The Federal Research Public Access Act of 2006 ], May 8, 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.arl.org/sparc/advocacy/frpaa/index.shtml Federal Research Public Access Act]</ref> The act is awaiting reintroduction in the [[110th Congress]]. The idea of mandating self-archiving was mooted at least as early as 1998.<ref>[http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Hypermail/Amsci/0010.html American-Scientist-Open-Access-Forum: Re: Savings from Convertin]</ref> Since 2003<ref>[http://listserver.sigmaxi.org/sc/wa.exe?A2=ind03&L=american-scientist-open-access-forum&F=l&S=&P=91229 AMERICAN-SCIENTIST-OPEN-ACCESS-FORUM archives - 2003 (#710)]</ref> efforts have been focused on open access mandating by the funders of research: governments,<ref>[http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Temp/UKSTC.htm Recommendations For Uk Open-Access Provision Policy]</ref> research funding agencies,<ref>[http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/access/index.asp Access to Research Outputs]</ref> and universities.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> These efforts have been fought by the publishing industry<ref>[http://www.prismcoalition.org/ PRISM]</ref>. However, many countries, funders, universities and other organizations have now either made commitments to open access, or are in the process of reviewing their policies and procedures, with a view to opening up access to results of the research they are responsible for. One of the many [[librarian]]s who have been leaders{{peacock term|date=October 2010}} in the self-archiving approach to open access is [[Hélène Bosc]]; her work can be found in her "15-year retrospective".<ref>[http://open-access.infodocs.eu/tiki-index.php Open Access to scientific communication]</ref> ==Criticism== {{Main|open access journal|self-archiving}} {{Weasel|date=December 2008}} Opponents of the open access model assert that the pay-for-access model is necessary to ensure that the publisher is adequately compensated for their work. Scholarly journal publishers that support pay-for-access claim that the "gatekeeper" role they play, maintaining a scholarly reputation, arranging for [[peer review]], and editing and indexing articles, require economic resources that are not supplied under an open access model, though acknowledging that open access journals do provide peer review. The cost of paper publication may also make open access to paper copies infeasible. Opponents claim that open access is not necessary to ensure fair access to developing nations; differential pricing, or financial aid from developed countries or institutions can make access to proprietary journals affordable. Conventional journal publishers may also lose customers to open access publishers who compete with them. The Partnership for Research Integrity in Science and Medicine (PRISM), a [[Political action committee|lobbying organization]] formed by the [[Association of American Publishers]] (AAP), is opposed to the open access movement.<ref>[http://www.salon.com/tech/htww/2007/08/28/prism_open_access/index.html]</ref> PRISM and AAP have lobbied against the increasing trend amongst funding organizations to require open publication, describing it as "government interference" and a threat to [[peer review]].<ref>[http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6471211.html]</ref> Textbook publishers generally make an even greater investment in the editing process, and electronic textbooks have yet to become widely accepted. For researchers, publishing an article describing novel results in a reputable scientific journal usually does more to enhance one's reputation among scientific peers, and advance one's academic career. Journal article authors are generally not directly financially compensated for their work beyond their institutional salaries and the indirect benefits that an enhanced reputation provides in terms of institutional funding, job offers, and peer collaboration <ref>Nicholas, D., Rowlands, I. (2005). Open Access publishing: The evidence from the authors. The Journal of Academic Librarianship, Vol. 31, no 3, pp. 179-181.</ref>. It could be argued, then, that the financial reward from writing a successful textbook is an important motivating factor, without which the quality and quantity of available textbooks would decrease.{{Dubious|date=September 2009}} There are those, for example PRISM, who think that open access is unnecessary or even harmful. It has been argued{{Who|date=January 2009}} that there is no need for those outside major academic institutions to have access to primary publications, at least in some fields.<ref>[http://arizona.openrepository.com/arizona/handle/10150/105958 DLIST - Goodman, David (2005) Open Access: What Comes Next]</ref> In the entertainment industry, it is argued that, unlike science, there is no pressing social need for widespread and barrier-free access to the content. One argument against Open Access is highlighted in a Nature (a for-profit publication) Web Focus forum, [http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/accessdebate/34.html The Pros and Cons of Open Access]. One argument brought up in the forum is that the supposed tax-payer right to access is blown out of proportion by the advocates of Open Access. Kate Worlock, the author of the forum article argues, "...where research is publicly-funded, taxes are generally not paid so that taxpayers can access research results, but rather so that
