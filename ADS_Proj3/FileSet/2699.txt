his inheritance Wittgenstein became one of the wealthiest men in Europe.<ref>Monk, p. 71.</ref> He donated some of it, initially anonymously, to Austrian artists and writers, including [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] and [[Georg Trakl]]. Wittgenstein came to feel that he could not get to the heart of his most fundamental questions while surrounded by other academics, and so in 1913 he retreated to the village of [[Skjolden]] in Norway, where he rented the second floor of a house for the winter. He later saw this as one of the most productive periods of his life, writing ''Logik'' (''Notes on Logic''), the predecessor of much of the ''Tractatus''.<ref name=ConnorRobertson/> At Wittgenstein's insistence, Moore visited him in Norway in 1914, reluctantly because Wittgenstein exhausted him. David Edmonds and John Eidinow write that Wittgenstein regarded Moore&mdash;an internationally known philosopher&mdash;as an example of how far someone could get in life with "absolutely no intelligence whatsoever." In Norway it was clear that Moore was expected to act as Wittgenstein's secretary, taking down his notes, with Wittgenstein falling into a rage when Moore got something wrong.<ref name=Edmonds45/> When he returned to Cambridge, Moore asked the university to consider accepting ''Logik'' as sufficient for a bachelor's degree, but they refused, saying it wasn't formatted properly: no footnotes, no preface. Wittgenstein was furious, writing to Moore in May 1914: "If I am not worth your making an exception for me ''even in some STUPID details'' then I may as well go to Hell directly; and if I ''am'' worth it and you don't do it then—by God—''you'' might go there." Moore was apparently distraught; he wrote in his diary that he felt sick and could not get the letter out of his head.<ref name=McGuinness200>McGuinness, Brian.

He volunteered for the [[Austro-Hungarian army]], first serving on a ship and then in an artillery workshop. In March 1916, he was posted to a fighting unit on the front line of the Russian front, as part of the Austrian 7th Army, where his unit was involved in some of the heaviest fighting, defending against the [[Brusilov Offensive]].<ref name=Monk137>Monk, pp.137–142.</ref> In action against British troops, he was decorated with the [[Military_Merit_Medal_(Austria–Hungary)|Military Merit]] with Swords on the Ribbon, and was commended by the army for "courageous behaviour, calmness, sang-froid, and heroism."<ref>Waugh, p. 114.</ref> In January 1917, he was sent as a member of a howitzer regiment to the Russian front, where he won several medals for bravery including the Silver Medal for Valour.<ref name=Monk137/> In 1918 he was promoted to reserve officer (lieutenant) and sent to northern Italy as part of an artillery regiment. For his part in the Austrian offensive of June 1918, he was recommended for the Gold Medal for Valour, the highest honour in the Austrian army, but was instead awarded the Band of the Military Service Medal with Swords.<ref>Monk, p. 154.</ref> Throughout the war, he kept notebooks in which he frequently wrote philosophical reflections alongside personal remarks, and in them he records his contempt for the baseness of soldiers in wartime. He discovered [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''The Gospel in Brief'' at a bookshop in [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]], and carried it everywhere, recommending it to anyone in distress, to the point where he became known to his fellow soldiers as "the man with the gospels".<ref>Monk, pp. 44, 116, 382–384. *Also see Bill Schardt & David Large, [http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/witty.htm "Wittgenstein, Tolstoy, and the Gospel in Brief"], ''The Philosopher'', Volume LXXXIX.</ref> Russell said he returned from the war a changed man, one with both a more mystical and more ascetic bent.<ref>Monk, p. 183.</ref> ===Completion of the ''Tractatus''=== In the summer of 1918 Wittgenstein took military leave and went to stay in his family's summer home, Neuwaldegg, in Vienna. It was there in August 1918 that he completed the ''Tractatus'', which he submitted with the title ''Der Satz'' (The Proposition) to the publishers Johada and Siegel.<ref name=Bartley33>Bartley, pp. 33–39, 45.</ref> A series of events around this time left him deeply upset. On 13 August, his uncle Paul died. On 25 October he learned that Johada and Siegel had decided not to publish the ''Tractatus'', and on 27 October his brother Kurt killed himself, the third of his brothers to commit suicide. It was around this time he received a letter from David Pinsent's mother to say that Pinsent had been killed in a plane crash on 8 May.<ref>Bartley, pp. 33–34. For an original report, see "Death of D.H. Pinsent," ''Birmingham Daily Mail'', May 15, 1918: "Recovery of the Body. The body of Mr. David Hugh Pinsent, a civilian observer, son of Mr and Mrs Hume Pinsent, of Foxcombe Hill, near Oxford and Birmingham, the second victim of last Wednesday's aeroplane accident in West Surrey, was last night found in the Basingstoke Canal, at Frimley."

He was sent back to the Italian front after his leave and was captured on 3 November in Trent, spending nine months in prison. He returned to his family in Vienna on 25 August 1919, by all accounts physically and mentally spent. He apparently talked incessantly about suicide, terrifying his sisters and Paul. He decided to do two things: to enroll in teacher training college as an elementary school teacher, and to get rid of his fortune. In 1914 it had been providing him with an income of 300,000 [[Austro-Hungarian krone|Kronen]] a year, but by 1919 was worth a great deal more because it had been invested in the United States and Holland. He divided it among his siblings, except for Margarete who was already wealthy in her own right, insisting that it not be held in trust for him.
