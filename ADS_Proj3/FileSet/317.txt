Headquartered in San Mateo, Calif., Attributor offers a paid service to enterprise customers and a free service – FairShare.cc – for small publishers and bloggers through a partnership with Creative Commons. Attributor’s technology enables publishers to monitor, protect, and monetize their content across the Internet. == Criticisms == Attributor's [[web crawler]] ignores the [[robots exclusion standard]] and spoofs its [[user agent]] string. This is common, and arguably necessary, for Internet monitors, but webmasters may choose to block it more aggressively.<ref>Burkard, Johann [http://johannburkard.de/blog/www/spam/attributor-abuse-other-peoples-resources-with-confidence.html "Attributor: Abuse other people’s resources with confidence"]</ref> FairShare crawlers honor the [[robots exclusion standard]] and identify the [[user agent]] string clearly. {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} == History == Attributor was founded in 2005[<ref>http://online.wsj.com/article/SB116640468524853020.html?mod=todays_us_marketplace.</ref>] by Jim Brock and Jim Pitkow with seed funding from Selby Ventures, Draper Richards, First Round Capital, Amicus Capital, Ron Conway and other angel investors. In December 2006 Sigma Partners lead the Series B investment with participating from the existing investors.[<ref>http://venturebeat.com/2006/12/18/attributor-scans-web-for-copyright-violations/</ref>] In April 2008, it then received Series C funding totaling $12 Million, led by JAFCO Ventures with participation from Turner Broadcasting and previous investors [<ref>http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9909277-7.html</ref>]. In April 2009[citation needed], Attributor and more than 1,000 publishing companies founded the Fair Syndication Consortium, the goal of which is to establish a new model for online content syndication. Guardian was discussed by Randall Stross from the New York Times when he reported citation needed] that Attributor’s search for e-book copies of “The Lost Symbol” verified that 166 copies of the e-book were available on 11 sites. RapidShare accounted for 102. In December 2009[citation needed], Attributor and the Fair Syndication Consortium released research data on the proliferation of U.S. newspaper content, which found that throughout a 30-day period, more than 75,000 unlicensed sites reused U.S. newspaper content online. According to the study, on these sites, 112,000 near-exact copies of unlicensed articles were detected. In January 2010, Attributor released a research report on online book piracy [citation needed], indicating that publishers could be losing out on as much as $3 billion to online book piracy. Attributor’s FairShare Guardian service monitored 913 books in 14 subjects in the final quarter of 2009 and estimated that more than 9 million copies of books were illegally downloaded from the 25 sites it tracked. In April 2010, Attributor reported on online magazine infringement[citation needed]. The research looked at a segment of the magazine industry: 133 English language magazine titles, and the infringement that occurs on just 20 of the more than 2,000 domains that illegally host full-issue downloads of these magazines. Among the results, Attributor found 3,996 instances of downloadable, full issues of these 133 magazines on these 20 sites, and 84 of the 133 (63%) magazines had infringements. Following the magazine report, Attributor produced an Ad Server Report[citation needed] in May 2010 that analyzed those that monetize content across 270 million domains, which is nearly 75% more domains and pages covered than in previous studies. Most notably, Google and DoubleClick overwhelmingly dominated the market, combining for more than 65% of the market share, which compared to the December 2008 report, is an increase of about 9%. == Competitors == A number of companies are trying to identify re-use of content online. Some are focused on a specific content type. Some spider the web on behalf of content owners and issue cease-and-desist type messages to the web sites. Others work directly with publishing sites to identify content on their site and associate it with the corresponding license.<br> '''Text:''' [[Copyscape]] uses the [[Google Web API]]s to find copies of your site elsewhere on the Web.
