used to create collaborative works. Examples include community websites, corporate [[intranet]]s, [[knowledge management]] systems, and note services. The software can also be used for personal [[Notetaking software|note taking]]. Wikis serve different purposes. Some permit control over different functions (levels of access). For example editing rights may permit changing, adding or removing material. Others may permit access without enforcing access control. Other rules can be imposed for organizing content. [[Ward Cunningham]], the developer of the first wiki software, [[WikiWikiWeb]], originally described it as "the simplest online database that could possibly work."<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.wiki.org/wiki.cgi?WhatIsWiki|title=What is a Wiki|accessdate=2008-04-10|publisher=WikiWikiWeb|author=[[Ward Cunningham|Cunningham, Ward]]|date=2002-06-27}}</ref> "Wiki" (pronounced {{IPA-haw|ˈwiti|}}<!--Hawaiian 'k' before 'i' tends to [t]--><!--This is erroneous.

It was named by Cunningham, who remembered a [[Honolulu International Airport]] counter employee telling him to take the "[[Wiki Wiki Shuttle]]" bus that runs between the airport's terminals. According to Cunningham, "I chose wiki-wiki as an alliterative substitute for 'quick' and thereby avoided naming this stuff quick-web."<ref name="cunningham">{{Citation | author = Cunningham, Ward|url=http://c2.com/doc/etymology.html |title=Correspondence on the Etymology of Wiki|date= 2003-11-01|publisher=WikiWikiWeb |accessdate=2007-03-09 }}</ref><ref name="history">{{Citation|author=Cunningham, Ward |url=http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiHistory |title=Wiki History|publisher=WikiWikiWeb|date=2008-02-25|accessdate= 2007-03-09}}</ref> Cunningham was in part inspired by Apple's [[HyperCard]].

Common uses included project communication, intranets, and documentation, initially for technical users. Today some [[corporate wiki|companies use wikis]] as their only collaborative software and as a replacement for static intranets, and some schools and universities use wikis to enhance [[group learning]]. There may be greater use of wikis behind [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]] than on the public Internet. On March 15, 2007, ''wiki'' entered the online ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.<ref name="OED1">{{Citation|url= http://dictionary.oed.com/news/newwords.html| title =March 2007 new words, OED| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]| date = 2007-03-01 | author=Diamond, Graeme|accessdate=2007-03-16 }}</ref> ==Characteristics== Ward Cunningham and co-author [[Bo Leuf]], in their book ''[[The Wiki Way|The Wiki Way: Quick Collaboration on the Web]]'', described the essence of the Wiki concept as follows: * A wiki invites all users to edit any page or to create new pages within the wiki Web site, using only a [[vanilla software|plain-vanilla]] Web browser without any extra [[browser extension|add-ons]]. * Wiki promotes meaningful topic associations between different pages by making page link creation almost intuitively easy and showing whether an intended target page exists or not. * A wiki is not a carefully crafted site for casual visitors. Instead, it seeks to involve the visitor in an ongoing process of creation and collaboration that constantly changes the Web site landscape. A wiki enables communities to write documents collaboratively, using a simple markup language and a web browser. A single page in a wiki website is referred to as a "wiki page", while the entire collection of pages, which are usually well interconnected by [[hyperlink]]s, is "the wiki". A wiki is essentially a database for creating, browsing, and searching through information. A wiki allows for non-linear, evolving, complex and networked text, argument and interaction.<ref name=Legal>{{citation|title=Legal Issues for Wikis: The Challenge of User-generated and Peer-produced Knowledge, Content and Culture|author=Black, Peter; Delaney, Hayden; Fitzgerald, Brian|volume=14|publisher=eLaw J.|page=245|year=2007}}</ref> A defining characteristic of wiki technology is the ease with which pages can be created and updated. Generally, there is no review before modifications are accepted. Many wikis are open to alteration by the general public without requiring them to register [[User (computing)|user]] accounts. Sometimes logging in for a session is recommended, to create a "wiki-signature" cookie for signing edits automatically.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Many edits, however, can be made in real-time and appear almost instantly online. This can facilitate abuse of the system. Private wiki servers require [[Authentication|user authentication]] to edit pages, and sometimes even to read them. [[Maged N. Kamel Boulos]], Cito Maramba and [[Steve Wheeler]] write that it is the "openness of wikis that gives rise to the concept of 'Darwikinism', which is a concept that describes the '[[socially Darwinian]] process' that wiki pages are subject to. Basically, because of the openness and rapidity that wiki pages can be edited, the pages undergo a [[natural selection]] process like that which nature subjects to living organisms. 'Unfit' sentences and sections are ruthlessly culled, edited and replaced if they are not considered 'fit', which hopefully results in the evolution of a higher quality and more relevant page. Whilst such openness may invite 'vandalism' and the posting of untrue information, this same openness also makes it possible to rapidly correct or restore a 'quality' wiki page."<ref name=BMC/> ===Editing wiki pages=== There are many different ways in which wikis have users edit the content. Ordinarily, the structure and formatting of wiki pages are specified with a simplified markup language, sometimes known as "''[[wikitext]]''". For example, starting a line of text with an asterisk ("*") often sets up a [[Bullet (typography)|bulleted list]]. The style and syntax of wikitexts can vary greatly among wiki implementations, some of which also allow [[HTML]] tags. Designers of wikis often take this approach because HTML, with its many cryptic tags, is not very legible, making it hard to edit. Wikis therefore favour plain-text editing, with fewer and simpler conventions than HTML, for indicating style and structure. Although limiting access to HTML and to the [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) of wikis limits user ability to alter the structure and formatting of wiki content, there are some benefits. Limited access to CSS promotes consistency in the [[look
