Let ''K'' be the unit sphere in ''X''. Define a function ''p : X →'' '''R''' by :<math>p(x) = \inf \left\{r > 0: x \in r K \right\}. </math> One can see that <math>p(x) = \|x\|</math>, i.e. ''p'' is just the norm on ''X''. The function ''p'' is a special case of a Minkowski functional. === Example 2=== Let ''X'' be a vector space without topology with underlying scalar field '''K'''. Take ''φ ∈ X' '', the algebraic dual of ''X'', i.e. ''φ : X →'' '''K''' is a linear functional on ''X''. Fix ''a > 0''. Let the set ''K'' be given by :<math>K = \{ x \in X : | \phi(x) | \leq a \}. </math> Again we define :<math>p(x) = \inf \left\{r > 0: x \in r K \right\}. </math> Then :<math>p(x) = \frac{1}{a} | \phi(x) |.</math> The function ''p''(''x'') is another instance of a Minkowski functional. It has the following properties: #It is ''subadditive'': ''p''(''x'' + ''y'') ≤ ''p''(''x'') + ''p''(''y''), #It is ''homogeneous'': for all ''α'' ∈ '''K''', ''p''(''α x'') = |''α''| ''p''(''x''), #It is nonnegative. Therefore ''p'' is a [[seminorm]] on ''X'', with an induced topology. This is characteristic of Minkowski functionals defined via "nice" sets. There's a one-to-one correspondence between seminorms and the Minkowski functional given by such sets. What is meant precisely by "nice" is discussed in the section below. Notice that, in contrast to a stronger requirement for a norm, ''p(x) = 0'' need not imply ''x = 0''. In the above example, one can take a nonzero ''x'' from the kernel of ''φ''. Consequently, the resulting topology need not be Hausdorff. == Definition == The above examples suggest that, given a (complex or real) vector space ''X'' and a subset ''K'', one can define a corresponding Minkowski functional :<math>p_K:X \rightarrow [0, \infty)</math> by :<math>p_K (x) = \inf \left\{r > 0: x \in r K \right\}. </math> It is implicitly assumed in this definition that 0 ∈ ''K'' and the set {''r'' > 0: ''x'' ∈ ''r K''} is nonempty. In order for ''p<sub>K</sub>'' to have the properties of a seminorm, additional restrictions must be imposed on ''K''. These conditions are listed below. #The set ''K'' being [[convex set|convex]] implies the subadditivity of ''p<sub>K</sub>''. #[[Homogeneous function|Homogeneity]], i.e. ''p<sub>K</sub>''(''α x'') = |''α''| ''p<sub>K</sub>''(''x'') for all ''α'', is ensured if ''K'' is ''balanced'', meaning ''α K'' ⊂ ''K'' for all |''α''| ≤ 1. === Convexity of ''K'' === A simple geometric argument that shows convexity of ''K'' implies subadditivity is as follows. Suppose for the moment that ''p<sub>K</sub>''(''x'') = ''p<sub>K</sub>''(''y'') = ''r''. Then for all ''ε'' > 0, we have ''x'', ''y'' ∈ (''r + ε'') ''K'' = '' K' ''. The assumption that ''K'' is convex means '' K' '' is also. Therefore ½ ''x'' + ½ ''y'' is in '' K' ''. By definition of the Minkowski functional ''p<sub>K</sub>'', one has :<math>p_K\left( \frac{1}{2} x + \frac{1}{2} y\right) \le r + \epsilon = \frac{1}{2} p_K(x) + \frac{1}{2} p_K(y) + \epsilon .</math> But the left hand side is ½ ''p<sub>K</sub>''(''x'' + ''y''), i.e. the above becomes :<math>p_K(x + y) \le p_K(x) + p_K(y) + \epsilon, \quad \mbox{for all} \quad \epsilon > 0.</math> This is the desired inequality. The general case ''p<sub>K</sub>''(''x'') > ''p<sub>K</sub>''(''y'') is obtained after the obvious modification. '''Note''' Convexity of ''K'', together with the initial assumption that the set {''r'' > 0: ''x'' ∈ ''r K''} is nonempty, implies that ''K'' is [[absorbing set|''absorbent'']]. === Balancedness of ''K'' === Notice that ''K'' being balanced implies that :<math>\lambda x \in r K \quad \mbox{if and only if} \quad x \in \frac{r}{|\lambda|} K.</math> Therefore :<math>p_K (\lambda x) = \inf \left\{r > 0: \lambda x \in r K \right\} = \inf \left\{r > 0: x \in \frac{r}{|\lambda|} K \right\} = \inf \left\{ | \lambda | \frac{r}{ | \lambda | } > 0: x \in \frac{r}{|\lambda|} K \right\} = |\lambda| p_K(x). </math> == Related links == * [[Hadwiger's theorem]] * [[Hugo Hadwiger]] * [[Morphological image processing]] [[Category:Functional analysis]] [[Category:Convex analysis]] [[de:Minkowski-Funktional]] [[pl:Funkcjonał Minkowskiego]] [[pt:Funcional de Minkowski]] [[ru:Функционал Минковского]]</text> </page> <page> <id>24697</id> <title>Minnesota Internet Users Essential Tool</title> <text>[[Image:Minuet.png|thumb|Screenshot of Minuet Version 1.0_BETA_18A]] '''Minnesota Internet Users Essential Tool''' ('''Minuet''') is an integrated Internet package for [[DOS]] Operating Systems on [[IBM PC compatible|IBM-compatible PCs]]. ==Background== Minuet was created at the [[University of Minnesota]], in the early days of the World Wide Web (1994-1996). At that time, Internet software for the PC was not well-written — the only programs available were [[NCSA Telnet]] and [[NCSA FTP]]. Both were glitchy, hard to configure, and [[Computer terminal|TTY]]-oriented. The microcomputer support department at the university decided to come up with something better. Their design goals were: * Runnable on any PC with at least 384 [[Kibibyte|KiB]] of [[Random-Access Memory|RAM]], even an original 4.77MHz PC. * [[Graphical User Interface|GUI]] interface * Would run under DOS; not requiring Windows * Easy to use * Little or no configuration needed * [[Computer multitasking|Multi-tasking]] The result was "Minuet". Minuet was quite successful, being used at many colleges and institutions. Usage probably peaked around 1996, going down as Windows 95 and its free e-mail and web browser proliferated. ==Implementation== The program was written in [[Turbo Pascal]], using the [[Turbo Vision]] GUI. This base was a good match for the PCs of that time. Turbo Vision in its
