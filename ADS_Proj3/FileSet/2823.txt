Modern notation makes mathematics much easier for the professional, but beginners often find it daunting. It is extremely compressed: a few symbols contain a great deal of information. Like [[musical notation]], modern mathematical notation has a strict syntax (which to a limited extent varies from author to author and from discipline to discipline) and encodes information that would be difficult to write in any other way. Mathematical [[language]] can also be hard for beginners. Words such as ''or'' and ''only'' have more precise meanings than in everyday speech. Moreover, words such as ''[[open set|open]]'' and ''[[field (mathematics)|field]]'' have been given specialized mathematical meanings. [[Mathematical jargon]] includes technical terms such as ''[[homeomorphism]]'' and ''[[Integral|integrable]]''. But there is a reason for special notation and technical jargon: mathematics requires more precision than everyday speech. Mathematicians refer to this precision of language and logic as "rigor". [[File:Infinity symbol.svg|thumb|left|upright|The [[infinity]] symbol '''∞''' in several typefaces.]] [[Mathematical proof]] is fundamentally a matter of [[rigor]]. Mathematicians want their theorems to follow from axioms by means of systematic reasoning. This is to avoid mistaken "[[theorem]]s", based on fallible intuitions, of which many instances have occurred in the history of the subject.<ref>See ''[[false proof]]'' for simple examples of what can go wrong in a formal proof. The [[History of the four color theorem|history of the Four Color Theorem]] contains examples of false proofs accidentally accepted by other mathematicians at the time.</ref> The level of rigor expected in mathematics has varied over time: the Greeks expected detailed arguments, but at the time of [[Isaac Newton]] the methods employed were less rigorous. Problems inherent in the definitions used by Newton would lead to a resurgence of careful analysis and formal proof in the 19th century. Misunderstanding the rigor is a cause for some of the common misconceptions of mathematics<!-- This part needs improvement | >> -->. Today, mathematicians continue to argue among themselves about [[computer-assisted proof]]s. Since large computations are hard to verify, such proofs may not be sufficiently rigorous.<ref>Ivars Peterson, ''The Mathematical Tourist'', Freeman, 1988, ISBN 0-7167-1953-3. p. 4 "A few complain that the computer program can't be verified properly", (in reference to the Haken-Apple proof of the Four Color Theorem).</ref> [[Axiom]]s in traditional thought were "self-evident truths", but that conception is problematic. At a formal level, an axiom is just a string of symbols, which has an intrinsic meaning only in the context of all derivable formulas of an [[axiomatic system]]. It was the goal of [[Hilbert's program]] to put all of mathematics on a firm axiomatic basis, but according to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] every (sufficiently powerful) axiomatic system has [[independence (mathematical logic)|undecidable]] formulas; and so a final [[axiomatization]] of mathematics is impossible. Nonetheless mathematics is often imagined to be (as far as its formal content) nothing but [[set theory]] in some axiomatization, in the sense that every mathematical statement or proof could be cast into formulas within set theory.<ref>Patrick Suppes, ''Axiomatic Set Theory'', Dover, 1972, ISBN 0-486-61630-4. p. 1, "Among the many branches of modern mathematics set theory occupies a unique place: with a few rare exceptions the entities which are studied and analyzed in mathematics may be regarded as certain particular sets or classes of objects."</ref> ==Mathematics as science== [[File:Carl Friedrich Gauss.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], himself known as the "prince of mathematicians",<ref>{{cite book |last=Zeidler |first=Eberhard |title=Oxford User's Guide to Mathematics |location=Oxford, UK |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |isbn=0198507631 |page=1188 }}</ref> referred to mathematics as "the Queen of the Sciences".]] Carl Friedrich Gauss referred to mathematics as "the Queen of the Sciences".<ref>Waltershausen</ref> In the original Latin ''Regina Scientiarum'', as well as in [[German language|German]] ''Königin der Wissenschaften'', the word corresponding to ''science'' means (field of) knowledge. Indeed, this is also the original meaning in English, and there is no doubt that mathematics is in this sense a science. The specialization restricting the meaning to ''natural'' science is of later date. If one considers [[science]] to be strictly about the physical world, then mathematics, or at least [[pure mathematics]], is not a science. [[Albert Einstein]] stated that ''"as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.''"<ref name=certain>Einstein, p. 28. The quote is Einstein's answer to the question: "how can it be that mathematics, being after all a product of human thought which is independent of experience, is so admirably appropriate to the objects of reality?" He, too, is concerned with ''[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences]]''.</ref> Many philosophers believe that mathematics is not experimentally [[falsifiability|falsifiable]], and thus not a science according to the definition of [[Karl Popper]].<ref>{{cite book | title = Out of Their Minds: The Lives and Discoveries
