There were six major releases in this series. ==K Desktop Environment 3.0== [[Image:KDE 3.0.jpg|thumb|K Desktop Environment 3.0]] K Desktop Environment 3.0 introduced better support for restricted usage. Some environments, such as kiosks, Internet cafes and enterprise deployments, demand that the user not have full access to all the capabilities of a piece of software, in order to preclude certain undesirable actions. To address these needs, KDE 3.0 included a new lockdown framework. This is essentially a permissions-based system for altering application configuration options and supplements standard UNIX permissions. The KDE panel and the desktop manager were modified to employ this system, but other major desktop components, such as Konqueror and the Control Center, had to wait for subsequent releases.<ref name="3.0 announcement">[http://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-3.0.php KDE 3.0 Released to public]</ref> A new printing framework, KDEPrint debuted. Its modular design enabled it to support different printing engines, such as CUPS, LPRng, LPR, LPD or other servers or programs. In conjunction with CUPS, KDEPrint was able to manage an elaborate enterprise networked printing system. As KDEPrint provides a command-line interface, the framework, including the GUI configuration elements, are accessible to non-KDE applications, such as [[OpenOffice.org]], the [[Mozilla Application Suite]], and [[Acrobat Reader]].<ref name="3.0 announcement"/> This release also introduced a new KDE address book library which provides a central address book to all KDE applications. The new library is based on the [[vCard]] standard and has provisions for being extended by additional [[backend]]s like [[LDAP]] or database servers.<ref name="3.0 announcement"/> ==K Desktop Environment 3.1== [[Image:KDE-3.1-es-ES.png|thumb|K Desktop Environment 3.1 with Konqueror and the About screen.]] K Desktop Environment 3.1 introduced new default window (Keramik) and icon (Crystal) styles as well as a number of feature enhancements.<ref name="3.1 announcement">[http://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-3.1.php KDE 3.1 Release Announcement]</ref> [[Kontact]] included greatly improved [[LDAP]] integration throughout Kontact, enhanced security for [[KMail]] (S/MIME, PGP/MIME and X.509v3 support) and Exchange 2000 compatibility for [[KOrganizer]]. The desktop "lockdown" framework, introduced in version 3.0, enabling system administrators to restrict various configuration settings, such as bookmarks, user actions, and launching applications was extended. Other improvements included tabbed browsing in [[Konqueror]], [[KGet]] - a new download manager, a new multimedia player plugin (based on [[Xine]]) and a desktop sharing framework.<ref name="3.1 announcement"/> ==K Desktop Environment 3.2== [[Image:Kde-3.2.3-es-es.png|thumb|K Desktop Environment 3.2 with Konqueror and the About screen. This has been described as a watershed release.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://aseigo.blogspot.com/2008/11/milestones.html | title=milestones | author=Aaron Seigo | accessdate=2008-11-10}}</ref>]] K Desktop Environment 3.2 included new features, such as inline spell checking for web forms and e-mails, improved e-mail and calendaring support, tabs in Konqueror and support for Microsoft Windows desktop sharing protocol (RDP). Performance and standards compliance were improved with lowered start up times for applications and increased support for [[FreeDesktop.org]] standards to strengthen interoperability with other Linux and UNIX software. Working in concert with Apple's Safari web browser team, KDE's web support saw performance boosts and increased compliance with web standards.<ref name="3.2 announcement">[http://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-3.2.php Announcing KDE 3.2]</ref> Usability was improved by reworking many applications, dialogs and control panels to focus on clarity and utility, and reducing clutter in many menus and toolbars. Hundreds of new icons were created to improve the consistency of the environment, and there were changes to the default look including new splash screens, animated progress bars and styled panels. The Plastik style debuted in this release.<ref name="3.2 announcement"/> New applications included:<ref name="3.2 announcement"/> *[[JuK]], a jukebox-style music player. *[[Kopete]] instant messenger with support for AOL Instant Messenger, MSN, Yahoo Messenger, ICQ, Gadu-Gadu, Jabber, IRC, SMS and WinPopup. *[[KWallet]], providing integrated, secure storage of passwords and web form data. *[[Kontact]], a unified interface that draws KDE's email, calendaring, address book, notes and other PIM features together. *KGpg, KDE interface to industry-standard encryption tools. *KIG, an interactive geometry program. *[[KSVG]], a viewer for SVG files. *KMag, KMouseTool and KMouth.

Kontact was integrated with Kolab, a groupware application, and Kpilot. Konqueror features better support for Instant Messaging contacts, with the capability to send files to IM contacts, and support for IM protocols (e.g. <nowiki>irc://</nowiki>), while KMail can display the online presence of IM contacts. Juk has support for burning audio CDs with [[K3b]].<ref name="3.3 announcement">[http://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-3.3.php Announcing KDE 3.3]</ref> There were also many small desktop enhancements. Konqueror received tab improvements, an RSS feed viewer sidebar and a searchbar - compatible with all keyword: searches. HTML composing, anti-spam/anti-virus wizards, automatic handling of mailing lists, improved support for cryptography and a quick search bar were additions to KMail.
