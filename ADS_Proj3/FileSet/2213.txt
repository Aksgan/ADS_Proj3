medals are awarded to the top ten percent of students, silver medals are awarded to the next twenty percent of students and bronze medals are awarded to the next thirty percent of students. Despite the oath of fair play, one student has been caught cheating and was disqualified. ===Language=== The IBO official language is [[English language|English]]. To provide equal opportunities for all participants, the tests are translated prior to the testing days. This is done by each country's own team leaders and jurors. This means they hold specific information on the tests before the participants should know. Therefore, teachers and students are lodged in separate accommodation. ==Objectives of Participants== The goals that each participant hopes to achieve in the IBO contest may vary widely from winning medals to socializing and exploring interactions between different cultures. ==Past and future IBOs== Each year, the IBO is organised by a different country. # Former [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Olomouc]] in 1990 # Former [[Soviet Union]], [[Makhachkala]] in 1991 # Former [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Poprad]] in 1992 # [[Netherlands]], [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] in 1993 # [[Bulgaria]], [[Varna]] in 1994 # [[Thailand]], [[Bangkok]] in 1995 # [[Ukraine]], [[Artek (camp)|Artek]] in 1996 # [[Turkmenistan]], [[Ashgabat]] in 1997 # [[Germany]], [[Kiel]] in 1998 # [[Sweden]], [[Uppsala]] in 1999 # [[Turkey]], [[Antalya]] in 2000 # [[Belgium]], [[Brussels]] in 2001 # [[Latvia]], [[Riga]] in 2002 # [[Belarus]], [[Minsk]] in 2003 # [[Australia]], [[Brisbane]] in 2004 # [[China]], [[Beijing]] in 2005 # [[Argentina]], [[Río Cuarto, Córdoba|Río Cuarto]] in 2006 # [[Canada]], [[Saskatoon, Saskatchewan|Saskatoon]] in 2007 # [[India]], [[Mumbai]] in 2008 # [[Japan]], [[Tsukuba]] in 2009 # [[Korea]], [[Changwon]] in 2010 # [[Taiwan]], [[Taipei]] in 2011 # [[Singapore]] in 2012 # [[Switzerland]], [[Bern]] in 2013 # [[New Zealand]] in 2014 (preliminary application) # [[Denmark]] in 2015 # [[Vietnam]] in 2016 # [[Iran]] in 2017 # [[United Kingdom]] or [[Spain]] in 2018 (preliminary applications)<ref>[http://www.ibo-info.org/next-ibos Information about next IBOs from official website]</ref> ==See also== * [[Biology by Team]] * [[Iranian Biology Olympiad]] ==External links== *[http://www.ibo-info.org/ Official IBO page] *[http://bioeng.olymp.mioo.ru/course/view.php?id=3 On-line version of IBOs in English] *[http://bio.olymp.mioo.ru/course/view.php?id=50 On-line version of IBOs in Russian] *[http://www.biology-olympiad.org.uk/ British Biology Olympiad] *[http://www.cee.org/usabo/index.shtml USA Biology Olympiad] Websites of individual IBOs * [http://www.ipn.uni-kiel.de/aktuell/ibo/ibo_web1.htm Kiel 1998] * [http://teacher.ru.orebro.se/ibo/program.htm Uppsala 1999] * [http://www.ibo2000.org.tr Antalya 2000] * [http://ibo2001.naturalsciences.be Brussels 2001] * [http://www.ibo2002.lv Riga 2002] * [http://www.ibo2003.bsu.by Minsk 2003] * [http://www.ibo2004.org.au Brisbane 2004] * [http://www.ibo2005.org.cn/ Beijing 2005] * [http://www.ibo2006.org.ar/ Rio Cuarto 2006] * [http://ibo2007.usask.ca/ Saskatoon 2007][http://ibo2007.usask.ca/results.html 2007 Winners List] * [http://web.gnowledge.org/ibo2008/ Mumbai 2008] * [http://ibo2009.org/index_e.html Tsukuba 2009] * [http://www.ibo2010.org/ Changwon 2010] <references/> [[Category:Science competitions]] [[Category:Biology awards]] [[Category:Science events]] [[Category:Recurring events established in 1990]] [[ca:Olimpíada internacional de biologia]] [[de:Internationale Biologie-Olympiade]] [[id:Olimpiade Biologi Internasional]] [[it:Olimpiadi Internazionali della Biologia]] [[lt:Tarptautinė biologijos olimpiada]] [[mn:Олон улсын биологийн олимпиад]] [[nl:Biologie Olympiade]] [[ja:国際生物学オリンピック]] [[pt:Olimpíada Internacional de Biologia]] [[ru:Международная биологическая олимпиада]] [[fi:Biologian olympialaiset]] [[sv:Biologiolympiaden]] [[th:ชีววิทยาโอลิมปิก]] [[vi:Olympic Sinh học Quốc tế]] [[vls:Vlamsche Biologie Olympiade]] [[zh:國際生物奧林匹克]]</text> </page> <page> <id>18937</id> <title>International Code of Botanical Nomenclature</title> <text>{{italic title}} [[File:CarlvonLinne Garden.jpg|thumb|250px|Linnaeus' garden at [[Uppsala]]]] [[File:Species plantarum 001.jpg|thumb|250px|Title page of ''Species Plantarum'', 1753]] {{Unreferenced|date=February 2010}} The '''''International Code of Botanical Nomenclature''''' (''ICBN'') is the set of rules and recommendations dealing with the formal [[botanical name]]s that are given to plants, fungi and a few other groups of organisms. Its intent is that each taxonomic group ("[[taxon]]", plural "taxa") of plants has only one [[correct name (botany)| correct name]] that is accepted worldwide. The value of a scientific name is that it is an [[identifier]]; it is not necessarily of descriptive value, or even accurate. * The guiding principle in [[botanical nomenclature]] is priority. The ''ICBN'' sets the formal starting date of nomenclature at 1 May 1753, the publication of ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' by [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] (or at later dates for specified groups and ranks). * A botanical name is fixed to a taxon by a [[type (botany)|type]]. This is almost invariably dried plant material and is usually deposited and preserved in a [[herbarium]], though it may also be an image. Some type collections can be viewed online at the websites of the herbaria in question. Both these principles are regulated and limited. To avoid undesirable effects of priority, [[conservation (botany)|conservation]] of a name is possible. Above the [[taxonomic rank]] of family very few hard rules apply (e.g. see [[descriptive botanical names]]). The ''ICBN'' can only be changed by an [[International Botanical Congress]] (IBC), with the [[International Association for Plant Taxonomy]] providing the supporting infrastructure. The present edition is the ''Vienna Code'' (2006), based on the decisions of the XVII IBC at Vienna [[2005]]. This was preceded by the ''St Louis Code'' (2000) and the ''Tokyo Code'' (1994), both available online. The next IBC will be held in [[Melbourne, Australia]] in July, 2011. Each new edition supersedes the earlier editions and is [[retroactive]] back to 1753, except where expressly limited. Botanical nomenclature is independent of zoological and bacteriological nomenclature, which are governed by their own Codes (see [[Nomenclature Codes]]). The ''ICBN'' applies not only to plants, as they are now defined, but also to other organisms traditionally studied by botanists and mycologists. This includes blue-green algae ([[Cyanobacteria]]); [[fungi]], including [[chytrid]]s, [[oomycete]]s, and [[slime mould]]s; [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[protists]] and [[alpha taxonomy|taxonomically]] related non-photosynthetic groups. There are special provisions in the ''ICBN'' for some of these groups, as there are for [[fossil]]s. For the naming of cultivated plants there is a separate code, the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]]''. This gives supplementary rules and recommendations. == See also == * [[International Association for Plant Taxonomy]] * [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] * [[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]] * [[International Plant Names Index]] * [[International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants]] * [[Author citation (botany)]] ==External links== * ''[http://www.bgbm.fu-berlin.de/iapt/nomenclature/code/tokyo-e Tokyo Code]'' (1994) * ''[http://www.bgbm.fu-berlin.de/iapt/nomenclature/code/SaintLouis/0000St.Luistitle.htm St. Louis Code]'' (2000) * ''[http://ibot.sav.sk/icbn/main.htm Vienna Code]'' (2006) * {{cite journal |journal = Taxon |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/iapt/tax/2005/00000054/00000004/art00024 |title=XVII International Botanical Congress: preliminary mail vote and report of Congress action on nomenclature proposals |author=John McNeill, Tod F.
