This can lead to false conclusions in several different ways. The survivors may literally be people, as in a medical study, or could be companies or research subjects or applicants for a job, or anything that must make it past some selection process to be considered further. Survivorship bias can lead to overly optimistic beliefs because failures are ignored, such as when companies that no longer exist are excluded from analyses of financial performance. It can also lead to the false belief that the successes in a group have some special property, rather than being just lucky. For example, if the three of the five students with the best college grades went to the same high school, that can lead one to believe that the high school must offer an excellent education. This could be true, but the question cannot be answered without looking at the grades of all the other students from that high school, not just the ones who "survived" the top-five selection process. Survivorship bias is a type of [[selection bias]]. == In finance == In finance, survivorship bias is the tendency for failed companies to be excluded from performance studies because they no longer exist. It often causes the results of studies to skew higher because only companies which were successful enough to survive until the end of the period are included. For example, a [[mutual fund]] company's selection of funds today will include only those that are successful now. Many losing funds are closed and merged into other funds to hide poor performance. In theory, 90% of extant funds could truthfully claim to have performance in the first quartile of their peers if the peer group includes funds that have closed. In 1996 Elton, Gruber, & Blake showed that survivorship bias is larger in the small-fund sector than in large mutual funds (presumably because small funds have a high probability of folding).<ref>http://rfs.oupjournals.org/cgi/reprint/9/4/1097 Elton, Gruber, & Blake, 1996, ''Survivorship Bias and Mutual Fund Performance'', from "The Review of Financial Studies", volume 9, number 4. In this paper the researchers eliminate survivorship bias by following the returns on all funds extant at the end of 1976. They show that other researchers have drawn spurious conclusions by failing to include the bias in regressions on fund performance.</ref> They estimate the size of the bias across the [[U.S.]] mutual fund industry as 0.9% per annum, where the bias is defined and measured as: : "Bias is defined as average α for surviving funds minus average <math>\alpha</math> for all funds" : (Where [[Alpha (investment)|α]] is the risk-adjusted return over the [[S&P 500]]. This is the standard measure of mutual fund out-performance). Additionally, in quantitative back-testing of market performance or other characteristics, survivorship bias is the use of a current index membership set rather than using the actual constituent changes over time. Consider a backtest to 1990 to find the average performance (total return) of S&P 500 members who have paid dividends within the previous year. To use the current 500 members only and create an historical equity line of the total return of the companies that met the criteria, would be adding survivorship bias to the results. S&P maintains an index of healthy companies, removing companies that no longer meet their criteria as a representative of the large-cap U.S. stock market. Companies that had healthy growth on their way to inclusion in the S&P 500, would be counted as if they were in the index during that growth period, when they were not. Instead there may have been another company in the index that was losing market capitalization and was destined for the S&P 600 Small-cap Index, that was later removed and would not be counted in the results. Using the actual membership of the index, applying entry and exit dates to gain the appropriate return during inclusion in the index, would allow for a bias-free output. == As a general experimental flaw == Survivorship bias (or survivor bias) is a statistical [[artifact (error)|artifact]] in applications outside [[finance]], where studies on the remaining population are fallaciously compared with the historic average despite the survivors having unusual properties. Mostly, the unusual property in question is a track record of success (like the successful funds).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} For example, the [[parapsychology]] researcher [[Joseph Banks Rhine]] believed he had identified the few individuals from hundreds of potential subjects who had powers of [[Extra-sensory perception|ESP]]. His calculations were based on the improbability of these few subjects guessing the [[Zener cards]] shown to a partner by chance.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} A major criticism which surfaced against his calculations was the possibility of unconscious ''survivor bias'' in subject selections. He was accused of failing to take into account the large effective size of his sample (all the people he didn't choose as 'strong [[telepath]]s' because they failed at an earlier testing stage). Had he done this he might have seen that from the large sample, one or two individuals would probably achieve the track record of success he had found ''purely by chance''. (Similarly, many [[investor]]s believe that chance is the main reason that most successful [[fund manager]]s have the track records they do.){{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Writing [[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science|about the Rhine case]], [[Martin Gardner]] explained that he didn't think the experimenters had made such obvious mistakes out of [[statistical]] naiveté, but as a result of subtly disregarding some poor subjects. He said that without trickery of any kind, there would always be some people who had improbable success, if a large enough sample were taken. To illustrate this, he speculates about what would happen if one hundred professors of [[psychology]] read Rhine's work and decided to make their
