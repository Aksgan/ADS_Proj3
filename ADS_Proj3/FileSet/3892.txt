modified by HP to target the embedded domain. Starting with the ST220, STMicroelectronics introduced compilers based on the [[Open64]] technology. In these compilers, the [[Open64]] release has been improved by upgrading its [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] C and C++ front-end from 2.96 to 2.x and later 3.x, in order to achieve full C++ compliance. The GNU C extensions have been fully implemented in the [[Open64]], including the '''asm''' statements. As a result, the GNU-[[Linux]] kernel can be compiled for the ST200. The other ST200 compilation tools are straightforward ports of GNU as, GNU ld, and [[GDB]]. ==References== {{reflist}} {{DEFAULTSORT:St200 Family}} [[Category:Instruction processing]] [[it:ST200]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33012</id> <title>STARAN</title> <text>{{context|date=January 2010}} '''STARAN''' might be the first commercially available computer designed around an [[associative memory]]. The STARAN computer was designed and built by [[Goodyear Aerospace Corporation]]. It is a [[Content Addressable Parallel Processor]](CAPP), a type of [[Parallel computing|parallel processor]] which uses [[Content-addressable memory | content addressable memory]]. STARAN is a [[SIMD | single instruction, multiple data]] array processor with a 4x256 1-bit processing element (PE) computer. The STARAN machines became available in 1972. Goodyear Aerospace later developed the [[Goodyear MPP | MPP]] based on similar principles but with a larger and wider processor array. == References == * {{Citation | last= Goodyear Aerospace Corporation |title=STARAN S APPLE-Programming Manual GER-15637 | publisher=Goodyear Aerospace Corporation |place=Akron, Ohio |year=1972}} * {{Citation | first= Caxton C. | last = Foster | title=Content Addressable Parallel Processors | publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold Company | place=New York | year=1976 | pages=169, 223 | isbn=0442224338}} {{Goodyear Company}} {{computer-stub}} [[Category:Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company]] [[Category:One-of-a-kind computers]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33018</id> <title>STD Wizard</title> <text>The '''STD Wizard''' is a publicly available [[expert system]] for determining which [[STD test|screening tests]], [[vaccinations]], and evaluations are recommended, related to [[sexually transmitted diseases]]. The information included within the STD Wizard is based on the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] "Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines - 2006". The system has English and Spanish language interfaces. The STD Wizard runs in a web browser. The program asks a series of questions, related to demographics, behaviors, and symptoms. There are potentially over 100 questions, but most users get asked about 20. The exact questions asked depend on the user's responses. For example, some questions are only asked of females, others of males. Typical questions include: * ''Demographics'' - How old are you, in years? * ''Behaviors'' - Have you had more than one sex partner within the past six months? * ''Symptoms'' - Are you having a discharge from your penis or burning during urination? After asking all needed questions, the program displays a list of recommendations, related to screening tests, vaccinations, and evaluations. Typical recommendations include: * ''Screening tests'' - e.g., [[HIV test|HIV screening test]] * ''Vaccinations'' - e.g., [[Hepatitis B vaccine|Hepatitis B vaccination]] * ''Evaluations'' - e.g., Seek medical attention in the next week for rash There are two main parts to the program. The first is a "logic file", which contains all the potential questions, responses, recommendations, and logic. The second is an "inference engine", which reads the logic file to figure out which questions to ask and provides the recommendations at the end. The STD Wizard was developed by the [[Medical Institute for Sexual Health]] and [[Expert Health Data Programming, Inc.]], with funding from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and the [[Association for Prevention Teaching and Research]]. ==External links== * [http://www.stdwizard.org/ Public Access to STD Wizard] (based on 2006 CDC Guidelines) * [http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/ Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines - 2006] {{DEFAULTSORT:Std Wizard}} [[Category:Expert systems]] [[Category:Health care informatics]] [[Category:Health software]] [[Category:Medical informatics]] [[Category:Sexually transmitted diseases and infections]]</text> </page> <page> <id>33022</id> <title>STEbus</title> <text>The '''STEbus''' is a non-proprietary, processor-independent, bus with 8 data lines and 20 address lines. It was popular for industrial control systems in the late 1980s and early 1990s before the ubiquitous IBM PC dominated this market. It remains a well-designed standard. Although no longer competitive in its original market, it is valid choice for hobbyists wishing to make 'home brew' computer systems. The Z80 and probably the CMOS 65C02 would be good processors to use. The standardized bus would allow hobbyists to interface to each others designs. ==Origins== In the early 1980s there were many proprietary bus systems, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Most had grown in an ad-hoc manner, typically around a particular microprocessor. The [[S-100 bus]] is based on [[Intel 8080]] signals, the [[STDbus]] around [[Z80]] signals, the [[SS-50 Bus]] around the [[Motorola 6800]], and the [[G64 bus]] around [[68000]] signals. This made it harder to interface other processors. Upgrading to a more powerful processor would subtly change the timings, and timing restraints were not always tightly specified. Nor were electrical parameters and physical dimensions. They usually used edge-connectors for the bus, which were vulnerable to dirt and vibration. The [[VMEbus]] had provided a high-quality solution for high-performance 16-bit processors, using reliable DIN41612 connectors and well-specified [[Eurocard (printed circuit board)|Eurocard]] board sizes and rack systems. However, these were too costly where an application only needed a modest 8-bit processor. In the mid 1980s the STEbus standard addressed these issues by specifying what is rather like a [[VMEbus]] simplified for 8-bit processors. The bus signals are sufficiently generic so that they are easy for 8-bit processors to interface with. The board size was usually a single-height Eurocard but allowed for double-height boards as well. The latter positioned the bus connector so that it could neatly merge into VME-bus systems. ==Maturity== The STEbus was very successful in its day. It was given the official standard [[IEEE]]1000-1987, and supported processors from the popular Z80, the 6809, to the powerful 68020. The only popular micro notably absent was the 6502, because it did not naturally support wait-states while writing. The CMOS 65C02 did not have this shortcoming, but this was rarer and more expensive than the NMOS 6502 and Z80. The 6809 used cycle stretching. Peripheral boards included prototyping boards, disc controllers, video cards, serial I/O, analogue and digital I/O. The STEbus achieved its goal of
