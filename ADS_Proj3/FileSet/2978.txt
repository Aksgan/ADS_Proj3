as the fragile hook easily snags on other cables and breaks. In this case, the connector is still basically functional as it can be slotted back into the jack, but it makes the connection unreliable if any device is moved or cables adjusted. Some higher quality cables have a flexible sleeve called a "boot" over the plug, or a special hook design, to prevent this. These cables are often marketed as "snagless". Boots are seen mainly on 8P8C data cables. ==Sizes and contacts== [[Image:Rj45plug-8p8c.png|thumb|8P8C modular plug pin positioning]] [[Image:Rj-45 male compare.jpg|thumb|8P8C plug with contacts for solid wire (left) and stranded wire (right)]] [[Image:Rj-45 male compare 2.jpg|thumb|contacts for solid wire (top left) and stranded wire (bottom right)]] Modular connectors have '''positions,''' some or all of which have '''contacts''' in them, some or all of which have '''wires''' attached; positions with omitted contacts or contacts unattached to wires are unused for the electrical connection, but ensure that the plug fit correctly. For instance, [[RJ11]] wires usually have connectors with 6 positions and 4 contacts, to which are attached 2 wires. Modular connectors come in four sizes: 4-, 6-, 8-, and 10-position, where a ''position'' is a location for a contact. Not all of the positions may have contacts: when contacts are omitted, they are typically done so from the outermost two contacts inward, such that the number of contacts is always an even number. Unlike 4P and 6P connectors which have uniquely different widths, connectors that are 8P or 10P have identical widths. The connectors are typically designated using two numbers that represent the quantity of positions and contacts, with each number followed by a "P" and "C", respectively: for example, "6P2C" for a connector having 6 positions and 2 contacts. Alternate designations omit the "P" and "C" while separating the position and contact quantities with either an "x" ("6x2") or a slash ("6/2"). It is interesting to observe that an 8P8C actually has almost the same [[form factor]] and profile as a 10P10C only missing pins 1 and 10 but not the positions. This means a 10P10C connector wired using only pins 2 thru 9 (a 10P8C) will function as an 8P8C connector! Internally, the contacts have sharp prongs that when crimped, pierce the insulation and connect with the wire conductor. Ethernet cables, in particular, may have [[solid]] or [[stranded]] wire conductors and the sharp prongs are different in the 8P8C connectors made for each type of wire. A solid wire connector often has 3, slightly splayed, prongs on each contact to securely surround and grip the conductor. Stranded wire connectors have prongs that are designed to penetrate the wire strands to make a connection. The dimensions of the connectors are such that a plug can be inserted into a jack that has more positions than the plug, leaving the jack's outermost contacts unterminated. However, not all plugs from all manufacturers have this capability, and some jack manufacturers warn that their jacks are not designed to accept smaller plugs without damage. When all of the positions have contacts, the contacts are numbered sequentially starting from 1. When viewed head-on with the retention mechanism on the bottom, jacks will have contact number 1 on the left and plugs will have it on the right. If the connector has positions that do not have contacts, the remaining contacts are numbered as if all of the positions had contacts: for example, on a 6-position, 2-contact plug, where the outermost four positions do not have contacts, the innermost two contacts are numbered 3 and 4. Some modular connectors are ''indexed'': their dimensions are intentionally non-standard, preventing connections with connectors of standard dimensions. The means of indexing may be non-standard cross-section dimensions or shapes, retention mechanism dimensions, or retention mechanism quantity. ==Pinouts== {{See also|Registered jack|Ethernet over twisted pair|RS-232#Pinouts}} Contact assignments, or [[pinouts]], vary by application. While standardized for telephone applications by [[registered jack]] standard, and [[Ethernet over twisted pair]] by the [[TIA/EIA-568-B]] standard, there may be no standardization within an application: for example, there are multiple conventions for use of [[8P8C]] connectors for [[RS-232]]. For this reason, [[D-sub]]-to-modular adapters are typically shipped without the D-sub contacts (pins or sockets) terminated, so that the D-sub-to-modular contact pairing can—and must—be performed by the end-user. ==4P4C== [[Image:RJ9.jpg|thumb|right|4P4C modular connector on a handset cable]] [[Image:ATTtelephone-large.jpg|thumb|right|Wired telephone using 4P4C connectors]] The '''4P4C''' connector, an Acronym for '''4 P'''osition, '''4 C'''onductor (Sometimes the second "C" is referred to as a '''C'''ontact, it stands for '''C'''onductor. While the "tine" ''is'' a contact, the name comes from the bandwidth that the cable will allow. A 4P4C will allow up to 4 Conductors, even though the connector itself has tines commonly referred to as Contacts); it is popularly, but incorrectly, called ''RJ22'', ''RJ10'', or ''RJ9''. It is also commonly referred to as a "Handset Connector" because of the most popular usage for the connector.<ref>{{cite book | author = BICSI | title = Telecommunications Cabling Installation | edition = 2nd | date = October 7, 2002 | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill Professional]] | isbn = 0-07-140979-3 | page = 88 | chapter = Background Information | quote = 4-position and 4-contact connectors are used primarily for telephone handset cords. }}</ref> It is the [[de facto standard|de facto]] industry standard for wired [[telephone]] [[handset]]s. It is used to provide connection from the base of the telephone to the handset. "RJ" stands for [[Registered Jack]], a family of telephone connection standards. This ''handset connector'' is actually not a [[Registered Jack]] at all, since it was never intended to connect directly to the telephone service lines: RJ connects a phone to the service lines, while 4P4C connects two parts of a phone. It uses the 4P4C [[modular connector]], which has four pins or electrical connections per connector. While all other RJ connectors are in use, and used in the field, by telephone companies; the 4P4C is unique in that it is for an End User only application, mainly from the phone to the handset. ===Wiring=== [[Image:RJ9 Handset diagram.svg|||Wiring diagram for
