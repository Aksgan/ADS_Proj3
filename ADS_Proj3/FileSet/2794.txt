Spong''' (born November 5, 1952 in [[Warren, Ohio]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[roboticist]]. He is currently the dean of [[University_of_Texas_at_Dallas_academic_programs#Erik_Jonsson_School_of_Engineering_and_Computer_Science|Erik Jonsson School of Engineering & Computer Science]] and the Lars Magnus Ericsson Chair in [[Electrical Engineering]] at the [[University of Texas at Dallas]] (UTD). Before he joined UTD, he was the Donald Biggar Willett Professor of Engineering, Professor of [[Electrical Engineering]], Research Professor of Coordinated Science Laboratory and Information Trust Institute, and Director of Center for Autonomous Engineering Systems and Robotics at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. Spong is a [[Fellow]] of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE). He received the IROS Fumio Harashima Award for Innovative Technologies, the O. Hugo Schuck Award and John R. Ragazzini Award from the [[American Automatic Control Council]], and the [[IEEE]] Third Millennium Medal. Spong received his B.A. in [[Mathematics]] and [[Physics]] from [[Hiram College]] in 1975, a M.S. in [[Mathematics]] from [[New Mexico State University]] in 1977, and a M.S. and D.Sc. in [[Systems Science]] and [[Mathematics]] from [[Washington University in St. Louis]] in 1979 and 1981, respectively. == Publications == * 2007.

Markov algorithms have been shown to be [[Turing-complete]], which means that they are suitable as a general model of [[computation]] and can represent any [[mathematical expression]] from its simple notation. [[Refal]] is a [[programming language]] based on '''Markov algorithm'''. ==Algorithm== The ''Rules'' is a sequence of pair of strings, usually presented in the form of ''pattern'' &rarr; ''replacement''. Some rules may be terminating. Given an ''input'' string: #Check the Rules in order from top to bottom to see whether any of the ''patterns'' can be found in the ''input'' string. #If none is found, the algorithm stops. #If one (or more) is found, use '''the first''' of them to replace the leftmost matching text in the ''input'' string with its ''replacement''. #If the applied rule was a terminating one, the algorithm stops. #Return to step 1 and carry on. ==Example== The following example shows the basic operation of a Markov algorithm. ===Rules=== #"A" -> "apple" #"B" -> "bag" #"S" -> "shop" #"T" -> "the" #"the shop" -> "my brother" #"a never used" -> '''.'''"terminating rule" ===Symbol string=== "I bought a B of As from T S." ===Execution=== If the algorithm is applied to the above example, the Symbol string will change in the following manner. #"I bought a B of apples from T S." #"I bought a bag of apples from T S." #"I bought a bag of apples from T shop." #"I bought a bag of apples from the shop." #"I bought a bag of apples from my brother." The algorithm will then terminate. ==Another Example== These rules give a more interesting example. They rewrite binary numbers to their unary counterparts. For example: 101 will be rewritten to a string of 5 consecutive bars. ===Rules=== #"|0" -> "0||" #"1" -> "0|" #"0" -> "" ===Symbol string=== "101" ===Execution=== If the algorithm is applied to the above example, it will terminate after the following steps. #"0|01" #"00||1" #"00||0|" #"00|0|||" #"000|||||" #"00|||||" #"0|||||" #"|||||" ==References== * Caracciolo di Forino, A.

Hess was recruited by the [[KGB]] to be an international spy with the objective of securing [[U.S.]] military information for the [[Soviet]]s. ==Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory== Hess's hacking activities were discovered by [[Clifford Stoll]], an [[astronomer]] turned [[systems administrator]] of the computer center of the [[Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory]] (LBL) in [[California]]. Stoll's first job duty was to track an accounting error in the LBL system. Early in his investigation, Stoll determined that the LBL computer system was compromised and that the hacker had obtained “[[Superuser|root]]” or systems privileges. Such a security compromise was more important than the accounting error. Stoll eventually determined how the hacker broke in and identified the hacker's activities on the system. LBL management considered attempting to seal off the system from this hacker, but Stoll and his colleagues convinced LBL’s management that this would not be effective. Ultimately, they installed a [[honeypot (computing)|honeypot]] to ensnare the hacker. ===Getting in=== Hess’s initial activities started at the [[University of Bremen]] in [[Germany]] through the German [[DATEX-P]] Network via satellite
