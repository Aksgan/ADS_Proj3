The book's basic concepts have been adopted and co-opted by a variety of fields and disciplines beyond those encompassing the history and philosophy of science. SSR is viewed by [[postmodernism|postmodern]] and [[post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] thinkers as having called into question the enterprise of science by demonstrating that scientific knowledge is dependent on the [[culture]] and historical circumstances of groups of scientists rather than on their adherence to a specific, definable method. In this regard, Kuhn is considered a precursor to the more radical thinking of [[Paul Feyerabend]]. Kuhn's work has also been regarded as blurring the [[demarcation problem|demarcation]] between scientific and non-scientific enterprises, because it describes the mechanism of scientific progress without invoking any idealized [[scientific method]] that is capable of distinguishing science from non-science. In the years following the publication of ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', debate raged with adherents of [[Karl Popper|Karl Popper's]] doctrine of falsificationism, such as [[Imre Lakatos]]. On the one hand, [[logical positivism|logical positivists]] and many scientists have criticized Kuhn's "humanizing" of the scientific process for going too far, while the postmodernists, together with Feyerabend, have criticized Kuhn for not going far enough. SSR has also been embraced by [[Creationism|creationists]] who see creationism as an incommensurate worldview in contrast to naturalism while holding science as a valuable tool.<ref>http://ncse.com/store/creationism-critiqued</ref><ref>http://www.ctns.org/news_102103.htm</ref> It was also in tune with a national change in attitudes towards science<ref>http://www.scottlondon.com/reviews/kuhn.html</ref> in the United States at the time of the book's publication, influenced by the Cold War confrontation with the Soviet Union, beginning with the launching of the space satellite Sputnik in 1957. ([[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]'' was published in the same year as SSR). The changes that occur in [[politics]], [[society]] and [[business]] are often expressed in Kuhnian terms, however poor their parallel with the practice of science may seem to scientists and historians of science. The terms "[[paradigm]]" and "[[paradigm shift]]" have become such notorious clichés and buzzwords that they are viewed in many circles as being effectively devoid of content.<ref> *Robert Fulford, Globe and Mail (June 5, 1999).

In 1965, a special symposium on Kuhn's SSR was held at an International Colloquium on the Philosophy of Science that took place at Bedford College, London, and was chaired by Sir [[Karl Popper]]. The symposium led to the publication of the symposium's presentations plus other essays, most of them critical, which eventually appeared in an influential volume of essays that by 1999 had gone through 21 printings. Kuhn expressed the opinion that his critics' readings of his book were so inconsistent with his own understanding of it that he was "...tempted to posit the existence of two Thomas Kuhns," one the author of his book, the other the individual who had been criticized in the symposium by "Professors Popper, [[Paul Feyerabend|Feyerabend]], [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], [[Stephen Toulmin|Toulmin]] and Watkins."<ref>Imre Lakatos and Alan Musgrave, eds. ''Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge'': Volume 4: Proceedings of the International Colloquium in the Philosophy of Science, London, 1965, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1970), pp. 231.</ref> ===Concept of paradigm=== In his 1972 work, ''Human Understanding'', [[Stephen Toulmin]] argued that a more realistic picture of science than that presented in SSR would admit the fact that revisions in science take place much more frequently, and are much less dramatic than can be explained by the model of revolution/normal science. In Toulmin's view, such revisions occur quite often during periods of what Kuhn would call "normal science." For Kuhn to explain such revisions in terms of the non-paradigmatic puzzle solutions of normal science, he would need to delineate what is perhaps an implausibly sharp distinction between paradigmatic and non-paradigmatic science.<ref>{{cite book |title=Human Understanding |last=Toulmin |first=S. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1972 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0198243618 |page= |pages= |url= }}</ref> ===Incommensurability of paradigms=== In a series of texts published in the early 1970s, C.R. Kordig asserted a position somewhere between that of Kuhn and the older philosophy of science. His criticism of the Kuhnian position was that the incommensurability thesis was too radical, and that this made it impossible to explain the confrontation of scientific theories that actually occurs. According to Kordig, it is in fact possible to admit the existence of revolutions and paradigm shifts in science while still recognizing that theories belonging to different paradigms can be compared and confronted on the plane of observation. Those who accept the incommensurability thesis do not do so because they admit the discontinuity of paradigms, but because they attribute a radical change in meanings to such shifts.<ref name="Kord" >{{cite journal |last=Kordig |first=C.

For example, when [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] and [[Tycho Brahe]] are trying to explain the relative variation of the distance of the sun from the horizon at sunrise, both see the same thing (the same configuration is focused on the retina of each individual). This is just one example of the fact that "rival scientific theories share some observations, and therefore some meanings." Kordig suggests that with this approach, he is not reintroducing the distinction between observations and theory in which the former is assigned a privileged and neutral status, but that it is possible to affirm more simply the fact that, even if no sharp distinction exists between theory and observations, this does not imply that there are no comprehensible differences at the two extremes of this
