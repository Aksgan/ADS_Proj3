The players should thus coordinate, both adopting strategy A, to receive the highest payoff; i.e., 4. If both players chose strategy B though, there is still a Nash equilibrium. Although each player is awarded less than optimal payoff, neither player has incentive to change strategy due to a reduction in the immediate payoff (from 3 to 1). An example of a coordination game is the setting where two technologies are available to two firms with compatible products, and they have to elect a strategy to become the market standard. If both firms agree on the chosen technology, high sales are expected for both firms. If the firms do not agree on the standard technology, few sales result. Both strategies are Nash equilibria of the game. Driving on a road, and having to choose either to drive on the left or to drive on the right of the road, is also a coordination game. For example, with payoffs 100 meaning no crash and 0 meaning a crash, the coordination game can be defined with the following payoff matrix: {| align=left border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;" |+ align=bottom |''The driving game'' | !Drive on the Left !Drive on the Right |- !Drive on the Left |align=center|100, 100 |align=center|0, 0 |- !Drive on the Right |align=center|0, 0 |align=center|100, 100 |- |} In this case there are two pure strategy Nash equilibria, when both choose to either drive on the left or on the right. If we admit [[mixed strategy|mixed strategies]] (where a pure strategy is chosen at random, subject to some fixed probability), then there are three Nash equilibria for the same case: two we have seen from the pure-strategy form, where the probabilities are (0%,100%) for player one, (0%, 100%) for player two; and (100%, 0%) for player one, (100%, 0%) for player two respectively. We add another where the probabilities for each player is (50%, 50%). === Prisoner's dilemma === {{Main|Prisoner's dilemma}} (note differences in the orientation of the payoff matrix) The Prisoner's Dilemma has the same payoff matrix as depicted for the Coordination Game, but now C > A > D > B. Because C > A and D > B, each player improves his situation by switching from strategy #1 to strategy #2, no matter what the other player decides. The Prisoner's Dilemma thus has a single Nash Equilibrium: both players choosing strategy #2 ("betraying"). What has long made this an interesting case to study is the fact that D < A (i.e., "both betray" is globally inferior to "both remain loyal"). The globally optimal strategy is unstable; it is not an equilibrium. === Network traffic === {{See also|Braess's Paradox}} [[File:Nash graph equilibrium.png|frame|Sample network graph. Values on edges are the travel time experienced by a 'car' travelling down that edge. X is the number of cars travelling via that edge.]] An application of Nash equilibria is in determining the expected flow of traffic in a network. Consider the graph on the right. If we assume that there are <math>n</math> "cars" traveling from A to D, what is the expected distribution of traffic in the network? This situation can be modeled as a "game" where every traveler has a choice of 3 strategies, where each strategy is a route from A to D (either <math>ABD</math>, <math>ABCD</math>, or <math>ACD</math>). The "payoff" of each strategy is the travel time of each route. In the graph on the right, a car travelling via <math>ABD</math> experiences travel time of <math>(1+x/100)+2</math>, where <math>x</math> is the number of cars traveling on edge <math>AB</math>. Thus, payoffs for any given strategy depend on the choices of the other players, as is usual. However, the goal in this case is to minimize travel time, not maximize it. Equilibrium will occur when the time on all paths is exactly the same. When that happens, no single driver has any incentive to switch routes, since it can only add to his/her travel time. For the graph on the right, if, for example, 100 cars are travelling from A to D, then equilibrium will occur when 25 drivers travel via <math>ABD</math>, 50 via <math>ABCD</math>, and 25 via <math>ACD</math>. Every driver now has a total travel time of 3.75. Notice that this distribution is not, actually, socially optimal. If the 100 cars agreed that 50 travel via <math>ABD</math> and the other 50 through <math>ACD</math>, then travel time for any single car would actually be 3.5 which is less than 3.75. This is also the Nash equilibrium if the path between B and C is removed, which means that adding an additional possible route can decrease the efficiency of the system, a phenomenon known as Braess's Paradox. === Competition game === {| align=right border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" style="margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;" |+ align=bottom |''A competition game'' | !style="width: 90px"|Player 2 chooses '0' !style="width: 90px"|Player 2 chooses '1' !style="width: 90px"|Player 2 chooses '2' !style="width: 90px"|Player 2 chooses '3' |- !style="width: 130px"|Player 1 chooses '0' |align=center style="background: #ffb1ba"|''0'', ''0'' |align=center|''2'', ''-2'' |align=center|''2'', ''-2'' |align=center|''2'', ''-2'' |- !Player 1 chooses '1' |align=center|''-2'', ''2'' |align=center|''1'', ''1'' |align=center style="background: #ddcef2"|''3'', ''-1'' |align=center|''3'', ''-1'' |- !Player 1 chooses '2' |align=center|''-2'', ''2'' |align=center style="background: #cedff2;"|''-1'', ''3'' |align=center style="background: #66ff66;"|''2'', ''2'' |align=center|''4'', ''0'' |- !Player 1 chooses '3' |align=center|''-2'', ''2'' |align=center|''-1'', ''3'' |align=center|''0'', ''4''
