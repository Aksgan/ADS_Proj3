to learn the contents of any message, report, or communication while the same is in transit or passing over any wire, line or cable . . . .” <ref>California Penal Code [http://law.onecle.com/california/penal/631.html Section 631]</ref> The court found that the statute does not apply to the facts of this case, since plaintiffs cited no authority to support their contention that section 631 covers the retrieval, printing and reading of E-mail messages which is not authorized by the author of the message. This decision is based on the fact that (1) There is no allegation that Nissan "tapped" into its own telephone lines, and indeed there would be no need to do so since, being the system operator, Nissan had access to the network without resort to a telephone line tap. (2) Likewise, as the owner and operator of the system, Nissan's connection to the telephone lines or cable which connected the system would necessarily be authorized. And (3) Nissan did not access the messages during transmission. Rather, the messages were retrieved from an electronic storage device and printed so that they could be read. Thus the Court found that Nissan's actions in retrieving, printing and reading plaintiffs' E-mail messages simply were not included within the actions proscribed by California Penal Code section 631.<ref name="BourkeVNissan_Main_Case" /> ===III. Violation of Penal Code Section 632 === The court found that section 632 (which prohibits the eavesdropping or recording of a "confidential communication by means of any electronic amplifying or recording device"<ref>California Penal Code [http://law.onecle.com/california/penal/632.html Section 632]</ref>), does not apply in this case. The reason behind this decision is that: (1) the plain words of the statute simpl do not permit a finding that Nissan's conduct violated the law, as no amplifying or recording device was used to retrieve and read plaintiffs' E-mail messages. (2) section 632 proscribes only “the interception of communications by the use of equipment which is not connected to any transmission line” (''People v. Ratekin'', 212 Cal.App.3d 1165, 1168 (Cal. Ct. App. 1989) <ref>Steven Winters, ''[http://www.law.berkeley.edu/journals/btlj/articles/vol8/Winters.pdf The New Privacy Interest: Electronic Mail in the Workplace]'', 8 High Tech. L.J. 197 (1993).</ref>), a circumstance not present in this case. ===IV. Wrongful Discharge in Violation of Public Policy === In the absence of an agreement to the contrary, an employee may be terminated at-will, that is, for any reason or for no reason at all (see ''Foley v. Interactive Data Corp.'', 47 Cal.3d 654,665 (Cal. 1988) <ref name="FoleyCase">[http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/reference/documents/SER2400.DOC California Civil Jury Instructions]</ref>). An employer may not, however, fire an employee for a reason which violates public policy (Ibid,; see also ''Tameny v. Atlantic Richfield'', 27 Cal.3d 167, 178 (Cal. 1980) <ref name="TamenyCase">''Tameny v. Atlantic Richfield'', [http://www.law.uc.edu/students/docs/tameny%20v%20atlantic%20richfield%20co.pdf 27 Cal.3d 167], (Cal. 1980).</ref>; ''Petermann v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters'', 174 Cal.App.2d 184, 188 (Cal. Ct. App. 1959) <ref name="PetermannCase"> Elizabeth H. Murphy, ''[http://www.lacba.org/showpage.cfm?pageid=1319 Firing at Will]'' LACBA (1999).</ref>). The court argued that a claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy necessarily requires a violation of public policy; however, as concluded in section I., Nissan's actions in reviewing plaintiffs' E-mail messages did not violate their constitutional right to privacy. Therefore, the Court held that plaintiffs had failed to state a claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy. ==Summary of Cited Court Cases== '''''Alarcon v. Murphy'', 201 Cal.App.3d 1 (Cal. Ct.

However, an exception to the general at-will employment presumption is made and a tortious wrongful discharge claim will lie where an employer's termination of an employee violates a fundamental public policy, or in other words, where "he or she is discharged for performing an act that public policy would encourage, or for refusing to do something that public policy would condemn. <ref>''[http://www.ca-employment-lawyers.com/Wrongful-Termination.htm California Employment Law - Wrongful Termination]'' CA-Employment-Lawyers.Com.</ref> == See also== * [[E-mail privacy]] * [[Internet privacy]] * [[Federal Communications Commission]] * [[Workplace Fairness]] * [[Online Privacy Protection Act]] * [[FTC Fair Information Practices]] == References == {{reflist|2}} == External links== * [http://www.garage.com/resources/reference/internet_email_privacy.shtml Inter Law - Email Privacy] * [http://www.iabc.com/cwb/archive/2004/0304/legal.htm Legal Issues Involved in Monitoring Employees' Internet and E-mail Usage] * [http://www.mttlr.org/volfive/schnaitman_art.html#fnref93 Building a Community Through Workplace E-mail: The New Privacy Frontier] * [http://lawcrawler.findlaw.com/MAD/faqemail.htm An E-Mail Espionage FAQ] * [http://www.privacy.gov.au/internet/email/ Workplace e-mail privacy from the Office of the Privacy Commissioner (Australia)] * [https://www.privacycom.org Privacy Commission] * [http://www.google.com/EMail Privacy Google 'EMail Privacy'] {{Privacy}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Bourke V.
