Development of new ideas is therefore not blocked by bad patents, and therefore the proposed negative effects of patents are moot. *If members of the public feel that an examiner has allowed an overly general claim in a patent, they may file an interpartes examination in the U.S., an [[Opposition procedure before the European Patent Office|opposition]] in Europe, or a lawsuit in Court, to argue that claims are overly broad and should not be allowed. **However, due to the relative recent innovation of the interpartes examination, few patents in the U.S. have been challenged in an interpartes reexamination. The [[Patent Reform Act of 2007]] has been introduced into the [[110th United States Congress|U.S Congress]] to reform the U.S. patent system. Among other reforms, this act would introduce a full patent opposition system into the U.S. similar to the European system. **Opposition proceedings in Europe can take 2 to 5 years to complete and can be very expensive.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} == Arguments against patentability == Opponents of software patents argue that: ===Cost and loss of R&D funds=== *The high cost to acquire a patent relative to the investment to be made for "manufacture", "distribution", etc, means millions of software developers are unable to participate in the pluses of the patent system while feeling the brunt of potentially each and every single such patent exclusivity grant. This is a major reason why writing fiction, practicing law, creating music, and most other activities practiced by a large number of skilled individuals are generally free of exclusivity grants or managed through copyright law, which has balances to protect free speech and avoid the liabilities associated with a very large number of skilled individuals not being able to pursue the relevant area or have their independent creations labeled infringing. *The cost of determining if a particular piece of software infringes any issued patents is too high and the results are too uncertain.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} *Should a software developer hire a [[patent attorney]] to perform a [[clearance search and opinion|clearance search]] and provide a [[clearance search and opinion|clearance opinion]], there is no guarantee that the search could be complete. Different patents and published patent applications may use different words to describe the same concepts and thus patents that cover different aspects of the invention may not show up in a search. The cost of a clearance searches may not prove to be cost effective to businesses with smaller budgets or individual inventors.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} *Developers may be forced to pay license fees for standards that are covered by patents. Most organizations that set standards require that members disclose any pending patents they may have that cover the standards. They also require that the members make those patents available on a nondiscriminatory basis and at a reasonable license fee. Members that hide the existence of patents for inventions that standards are based on can be subject to legal action. *Patenting software inventions
