para. 16-21 ''Guidelines on horizontal mergers''</ref> So to take the example, if in market X company B (with 10% market share) suddenly bought out the shares of company C (with 10% also) then this new market concentration would make the index jump to 0.162. Here it can be seen that it would not be relevant for merger law in the U.S. (being under 0.18) or in the EU (because there is not a change over 0.025). ==Formula== :<math>H =\sum_{i=1}^N s_i^2</math> where <math>s_i</math> is the market share of firm <math>i</math> in the market, and <math>N</math> is the number of firms. Thus, in a market with two firms that each have 50 percent market share, the Herfindahl index equals <math>0.50^2+0.50^2= 1/2</math>. The Herfindahl Index (<math>H</math>) ranges from <math>1/N</math> to one, where <math>N</math> is the number of firms in the market. Equivalently, if percents are used as whole numbers, as in <math>75</math> instead of <math>0.75</math>, the index can range up to <math>100^2</math>, or <math>10,000</math>. A HHI index below 0.01 (or 100) indicates a highly competitive index.<br> A HHI index below 0.1 (or 1,000) indicates an unconcentrated index.<br> A HHI index between 0.1 to 0.18 (or 1,000 to 1,800) indicates moderate concentration.<br> A HHI index above 0.18 (above 1,800) indicates high concentration[http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/testimony/hhi.htm]. A small index indicates a competitive industry with no dominant players. If all firms have an equal share the reciprocal of the index shows the number of firms in the industry. When firms have unequal shares, the reciprocal of the index indicates the "equivalent" number of firms in the industry. Using case 2, we find that the market structure is equivalent to having 1.55521 firms of the same size. There is also a normalised Herfindahl index. Whereas the Herfindahl index ranges from 1/N to one, the normalized Herfindahl index ranges from 0 to 1. It is computed as: :<math>H* = {\left ( H - 1/N \right ) \over 1-1/N }</math> where again, N is the number of firms in the market, and H is the usual Herfindahl Index, as above. ==Problems== The usefulness of this statistic to detect and stop harmful monopolies however is directly dependent on a proper definition of a particular market (which hinges primarily on the notion of substitutability). * For example, if the statistic were to look at a hypothetical financial services industry as a whole, and found that it contained 6 main firms with 15 % market share apiece, then the industry would look non-monopolistic. However, one of those firms handles 90 % of the checking and savings accounts and physical branches (and overcharges for them because of its monopoly), and the others primarily do commercial banking and investments. In this scenario, people would be suffering due to a market dominance by one firm; the market is not properly defined because checking accounts are not substitutable with commercial and investment banking. The problems of defining a market work the other way as well. To take another example, one cinema may have 90% of the movie market, but if movie theatres compete against video stores, pubs and nightclubs then people are less likely to be suffering due to market dominance. * Another typical problem in defining the market is choosing a geographic scope. For example, firms may have 20% market share each, but may occupy five areas of the country in which they are monopoly providers and thus do not compete against each other. A service provider or manufacturer in one city is not necessarily substitutable with a service provider or manufacturer in another city, depending on the importance of being local for the business&mdash;for example, telemarketing services are rather global in scope, while shoe repair services are local. The United States Federal anti-trust authorities such as the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission use the Herfindahl index as a screening tool to determine whether a proposed merger is likely to raise antitrust concerns [increases of over 0.0100 points generally provoke scrutiny, although this varies from case to case. The [[United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division|Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice]] considers Herfindahl indices between 0.1000 and 0.1800 to be ''moderately concentrated'' and indices above 0.1800 to be ''concentrated''. As the [[market concentration]] increases, [[competition]] and [[efficiency (economics)|efficiency]] decrease and the chances of [[collusion]] and [[monopoly]] increase. ==Intuition== When all the firms in an industry have equal market shares, H = 1/N. The Herfindahl is correlated with the number of firms in an industry because its lower bound when there are N firms is 1/N. An industry with 3 firms cannot have a lower Herfindahl than an industry with 20 firms when firms have equal market shares. But as market shares of the 20-firm industry diverge from equality the Herfindahl can exceed that of the equal-market-share 3-firm industry (e.g., if one firm has 81% of the market and the remaining 19 have 1% each H=0.658). A higher Herfindahl signifies a less competitive industry. ==Decomposition== The index can be expressed as <math>H =\frac1N+N V</math> where ''N'' is the number of firms, as above, and ''V'' is the [[variance|statistical variance]] of the firm shares, defined as <math>V=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N\left(s_i-1/N\right)^2}N</math>. If all firms have equal (identical) shares (that is, if the market structure is completely ''[[symmetric]]'', in which case ''s<sub>i</sub>'' = 1/''N'' for all ''i'') then ''V'' is zero and ''H'' equals 1/''N''. If the number of firms in the market is held constant, then a higher variance due to a higher level of asymmetry between firms' shares (that is, a higher ''share dispersion'') will result in a higher index value.
