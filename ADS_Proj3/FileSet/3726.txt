fused automatically to create the final shape. The primary advantage to additive fabrication is its ability to create almost any shape or geometric feature. The standard data [[Interface (computer science)|interface]] between CAD software and the machines is the [[STL (file format)|STL file format]]. An STL file approximates the shape of a part or assembly using triangular facets. Smaller facets produce a higher quality surface. The word "rapid" is relative: construction of a model with contemporary methods can take from several hours to several days, depending on the method used and the size and complexity of the model. Additive systems for rapid prototyping can typically produce models in a few hours, although it can vary widely depending on the type of machine being used and the size and number of models being produced simultaneously. Some [[solid freeform fabrication]] techniques use two materials in the course of constructing parts. The first material is the part material and the second is the support material (to support overhanging features during construction). The support material is later removed by heat or dissolved away with a solvent or water. Traditional [[injection molding]] can be less expensive for manufacturing polymer products in high quantities, but additive fabrication can be faster and less expensive when producing relatively small quantities of parts. [[3D printer]]s give designers and concept development teams the ability to produce parts and concept models using a desktop size printer. Rapid prototyping is now entering the field of [[rapid manufacturing]] and it is believed by many experts that this is a "next level" technology.<ref>Wohlers Report 2009, State of the Industry Annual Worldwide Progress Report on Additive Manufacturing, Wohlers Associates, 2009, http://www.wohlersassociates.com/, ISBN 0-9754429-5-3</ref> ==Technologies== [[File:Rapid prototyping worldwide by Zureks.png|thumb|right|250px|Rapid prototyping worldwide<ref>D.

As all are additive technologies, their main differences are found in the way layers are built to create parts. Some are melting or softening material to produce the layers ([[selective laser sintering|SLS]], [[fused deposition modeling|FDM]]) where others are laying liquid materials [[thermosets]] that are [[Curing (chemistry)|cured]] with different technologies. In the case of lamination systems, thin layers are cut to shape and joined together. As of 2005, conventional rapid prototype machines cost around £25,000.<ref>http://www.bath.ac.uk/pr/releases/replicating-machines.htm</ref> {| class="wikitable" !Prototyping technologies !Base materials |- |[[Selective laser sintering]] (SLS) |[[Thermoplastics]], [[metals]] powders |- |[[Fused deposition modeling]] (FDM) |[[Thermoplastics]], [[eutectic]] metals. |- |[[Stereolithography]] (SLA) |[[photopolymer]] |- |[[Laminated object manufacturing]] (LOM) |[[Paper]] |- |[[Electron beam melting]] (EBM) |[[Titanium alloy]]s |- |[[3D printing]] (3DP) |Various materials |} In 2006, [[John Balistreri]] and others at [[Bowling Green State University]] began research into 3D Rapid Prototyping machines, creating printed ceramic art objects. This research has led to the invention of ceramic powders and binder systems that enable [[clay]] material to be printed from a computer model and [[kiln]] fired for the first time. ==See also== * [[3D microfabrication]] * [[3D printing]] * [[Additive manufacturing]] * [[Desktop manufacturing]] * [[Digital fabricator]] * [[Direct digital manufacturing]] * [[Direct metal laser sintering]] * [[Fab lab]] * [[Fused deposition modeling]] * [[Instant manufacturing]], also known as "direct manufacturing" or "on-demand manufacturing" * [[Laser engineered net shaping]] * [[MeshLab]], a [[free software|free]] and [[open-source software|open-source]] Windows and Linux application for visualizing, processing and converting 3D meshes to or from the STL file format * [[Rapid manufacturing]] * [[RepRap Project]]: a free and open-source multi-material self-replicating rapid prototyping machine * [[Selective laser sintering]] * [[Solid freeform fabrication]]: a list of technologies used in rapid prototyping * [[Stereolithography]] * [[Von Neumann universal constructor]] ==References== ===Notes=== {{Reflist}} ===Bibliography=== <!--Hide dead link till investigated: *Grenda, E.

Starting around 1996 the California based company [[Octavo (company)|Octavo]] began scanning rare and important books from libraries around the world. These scans were done at extremely high resolution using high-quality equipment, with some pages at over 200MB each. They were sold by Octavo as commercial products on CD-ROM. In 2006 the "Rare Book Room" website was created which contains the complete collection in medium to medium-high resolution freely available to the public through a web browser or as a PDF file. Some high resolution versions are still being sold by Octavo through a separate website. As of 2007 over 400 books have been scanned. The repository includes books by [[Galileo]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Copernicus]], [[Kepler]], [[Einstein]], and [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]. It includes most of the [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)#Quartos|Shakespeare Quartos]] from the [[British Library]], the [[Bodleian Library]], the [[University of Edinburgh]] Library, and the [[National Library of Scotland]], as well as the [[First Folio]] from the [[Folger Library]]. It includes [[Library of Congress]] copies of ''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]'' by [[Benjamin Franklin]], and other rare editions: a [[Gutenberg Bible]] of 1455, [[Thomas Harvey]]'s [[Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus|book
