He holds a D.Sc. degree in electrical engineering (1995) from the [[Technion]], and spent a post-doctoral position at [[UC Berkeley]] and Berkeley Labs, and a visiting professorship at [[Stanford]] University. He has worked in various areas of image and shape analysis in computer vision, image processing, and computer graphics. Kimmel's interest in recent years has been non-rigid shape processing and analysis, medical imaging, computational biometry, numerical optimization of problems with a geometric flavor, and applications of metric geometry and differential geometry. Kimmel is an author of two books, an editor of one, and an author of numerous articles. He is the founder of the Geometric Image Processing Lab [http://gip.cs.technion.ac.il/], and a founder and advisor of several successful image processing and analysis companies. Kimmel's contributions include the development of [[fast marching]] methods for triangulated manifolds (together with [[James Sethian]]), the geodesic [[active contour]]s algorithm for image segmentation, a geometric framework for image filtering (named ''Beltrami flow'' after the Italian mathematician [[Eugenio Beltrami]]), and the Generalized Multidimensional Scaling (together with his students the Bronstein brothers) with which he was able to compute the [[Gromov-Hausdorff]] distance between surfaces. In 2003, he appeared in an interview to WNBC on the use of geometric approaches in three-dimensional [[face recognition system|face recognition]]. ==Work== * [[medical imaging]], [[computer graphics]], [[computer vision]] and [[Image processing]] ==Awards== * [[IEEE Fellow]] for his contributions to image processing and non-rigid shape analysis, 2009 * Counter Terrorism Award, 2003 * Henry Taub Prize, 2001 * Hershel Rich innovation award, 2001, 2003 * Alon Fellowship, 1998–2001 ==Books== * "Numerical Geometry of Images" published in 2003 by Springer * "Numerical Geometry of Non-Rigid Shapes" (with [[Alex and Michael Bronstein]]) published by Springer in 2009. ==External links== * [http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~ron Ron Kimmel's page at the Technion] * [http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/ptech/03/10/israel.twins.reut/ Kimmel in a CNN news report] {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME = Kimmel, Ron | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = | DATE OF BIRTH = | PLACE OF BIRTH = [[Haifa]], [[Israel]] | DATE OF DEATH = | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Kimmel, Ron}} [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:Israeli computer scientists]] [[Category:Computer vision researchers]] [[Category:Technion, Israel]] [[Category:IEEE Fellow]]</text> </page> <page> <id>32429</id> <title>Ronaldo Lemos</title> <text>{{Infobox Person |name = Ronaldo Lemos |birth_name = Ronaldo Lemos da Silva Júnior |image = RonaldoLemosJI2.jpg |caption = Lemos at [[Prix Ars Electronica]] |residence = |birth_date = |birth_place = |death_date = |death_place = |other_names = |known_for = Project Lead of the [[Creative Commons]] Brazil |occupation = Director of the Center for Technology & Society [[Fundação Getulio Vargas|FGV]] Law School |nationality = [[Brazil]]ian }} '''Ronaldo Lemos''' da Silva Júnior, Brazilian academic and commentator on [[copyright]] and culture.
