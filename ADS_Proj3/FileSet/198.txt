utilize [[description logics]] based ontologies for schema and information integration (a decade before W3C adopted a DL-based ontology representation standard). His work on multi-ontology query processing includes the most cited paper on the topic (over 485 citations). In 1996, he introduced the powerful concept of Metadata Reference Link (MREF) for associating metadata to hypertext that links documents on the Web, and described an [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]-based realization in 1998, long before RDF was adopted as a W3C recommendation. A part of his recent work has focussed on information extraction from text to generate semantic metadata in the form of RDF. In his work, semantic metadata extracted from biological text is made up of complex knowledge structures (complex entities and relationships) that reflect complex interactions in biomedical knowledge<ref name="ramakrishnan"> {{cite web|author= Cartic Ramakrishnan, K.

He has written many articles regarding this. ===Workflow Management and Semantic Web Services=== In the early 1990s, he initiated research in the formal modeling, scheduling, and correctness of workflows. His METEOR project demonstrated the value of research with real-world applications; its tools were used in graduate courses in several countries, and its technology was licensed to create a commercial product. The follow-on METEOR-S project has been highly influential. He led the research (later joined by [[IBM]]) that resulted in the [[W3C]] submission of WSDL-S (Semantic Annotation of [[Web Services Description Language|WSDL]]), the basis for [[SAWSDL]], a [[W3C recommendation]] for adding semantics to [[Web Services Description Language|WSDL]] and [[XML Schema (W3C)|XML Schema]]. He currently guides the development of SA-REST, which supports [[microformat]]-based annotation of popular [[RESTful]] services and WebAPIs. For both SAWSDL and SA-REST, he has provided leadership in the community-based process followed by [[W3C]]. He coauthored a 1995 paper in the journal of Distributed & Parallel Databases (Springer),which is one of the most cited papers in the area of workflow management literature, with more than 1200 citations, as well as the most cited among over 430 papers published in that journal.<ref name="googleScholar"> {{cite web|author= Google Scholar |title= Google Scholar results for Amit Sheth |url=http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=amit+sheth&hl=en&lr=&btnG=Search |accessdate= 2008-05-31 }}</ref> ===Information Integration=== <ul> <li> Federated and multidatabase architectures for integration and interoperability of heterogeneous databases, organized along the dimensions of distribution, heterogeneity, and autonomy</li> <li>Schema and view integration, with new and practical integration techniques and tools including the first tool on schema integration (1987) developed in the United States</li> <li>Quality and integrity of data in multiple databases, defining the concept of polytransaction and multidatabase consistency specification with innovative ticketing method for multidatabase concurrency control. </li> </ul> His 1990 ACM Computing Surveys paper, with over 1925 citations<ref name="googleScholar"/> ,<ref name= "shethLarson"> {{cite web|author= Amit Sheth, James Larson |title= Federated database systems for managing distributed, heterogeneous, and autonomous databases |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=96604&coll=GUIDE&dl=ACM&ret=1 |accessdate= 2008-05-31 }}</ref> is the most cited in this area, the second most cited paper in the broader area of distributed database, and the second most cited paper among over 1000 published in that important journal.
