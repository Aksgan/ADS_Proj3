The Arabs added the Arabic definite article "al" to the word, resulting in the word "الكيمياء" (al-kīmiyā). Thus, an alchemist was called a 'chemist' in popular speech, and later the suffix "-ry" was added to this to describe the art of the chemist as "chemistry". ==Definitions== In retrospect, the definition of chemistry has changed over time, as new discoveries and theories add to the functionality of the science. Shown below are some of the standard definitions used by various noted chemists: * '''Alchemy''' (330) – the study of the composition of waters, movement, growth, embodying, disembodying, drawing the spirits from bodies and bonding the spirits within bodies ([[Zosimos of Panopolis|Zosimos]]).<ref>Strathern, P. (2000). ''Mendeleyev’s Dream – the Quest for the Elements.'' New York: Berkley Books.</ref> * '''Chymistry''' (1661) – the subject of the material principles of mixt bodies ([[Robert Boyle|Boyle]]).<ref>{{Cite book| last=Boyle | first = Robert |title=The Sceptical Chymist|location=New York | publisher=Dover Publications, Inc. (reprint)|year=1661|isbn=0486428257}}</ref> * '''Chymistry''' (1663) – a scientific art, by which one learns to dissolve bodies, and draw from them the different substances on their composition, and how to unite them again, and exalt them to a higher perfection ([[Christopher Glaser|Glaser]]).<ref>{{Cite book| last=Glaser | first = Christopher |title=Traite de la chymie|location=Paris | year=1663}} as found in: {{Cite book| last = Kim | first = Mi Gyung | title = Affinity, That Elusive Dream - A Genealogy of the Chemical Revolution | publisher = The MIT Press | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-262-11273-6}} </ref> * '''Chemistry''' (1730) – the art of resolving mixt, compound, or aggregate bodies into their principles; and of composing such bodies from those principles ([[Georg Ernst Stahl|Stahl]]).<ref>{{Cite book| last=Stahl | first = George, E. |title=Philosophical Principles of Universal Chemistry|location=London | year=1730}}</ref> * '''Chemistry''' (1837) – the science concerned with the laws and effects of molecular forces ([[Jean-Baptiste Dumas|Dumas]]).<ref>Dumas, J.

It consists of a positively charged core (the [[atomic nucleus]]) which contains [[protons]] and [[neutrons]], and which maintains a number of [[electron]]s to balance the positive charge in the nucleus. The atom is also the smallest entity that can be envisaged to retain some of the [[chemical properties]] of the element, such as [[electronegativity]], [[ionization potential]], preferred [[oxidation state]](s), [[coordination number]], and preferred types of [[chemical bond|bonds]] to form (e.g., [[metallic]], [[ion]]ic, [[covalent]]). ===Element=== {{Main|Chemical element}} The concept of ''chemical element'' is related to that of chemical substance. A chemical element is specifically a substance which is composed of a single type of atom. A chemical element is characterized by a particular number of [[proton]]s in the [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of its atoms. This number is known as the [[atomic number]] of the element. For example, all atoms with 6 protons in their nuclei are atoms of the chemical element [[carbon]], and all atoms with 92 protons in their nuclei are atoms of the element [[uranium]]. 94 different chemical elements or types of atoms based on the number of protons exist naturally. A further 18 have been recognised by [[IUPAC]] as existing artificially only. Although all the nuclei of all atoms belonging to one element will have the same number of protons, they may not necessarily have the same number of [[neutrons]]; such atoms are termed [[isotopes]]. In fact several [[isotopes]] of an element may exist. The most convenient presentation of the chemical elements is in the [[periodic table]] of the chemical elements, which groups elements by atomic number. Due to its ingenious arrangement, [[Periodic table group|groups]], or columns, and [[period (periodic table)|periods]], or rows, of elements in the table either share several chemical properties, or follow a certain trend in characteristics such as [[atomic radius]], [[electronegativity]], etc. Lists of the elements [[List of elements by name|by name]], [[List of elements by symbol|by symbol]], and by [[List of elements by number|atomic number]] are also available. ===Compound=== {{Main|Chemical compound}} A ''compound'' is a substance with a ''particular ratio'' of atoms of particular [[chemical element]]s which determines its composition, and a particular [[chemical structure|organization]] which determines chemical properties. For example, [[water (molecule)|water]] is a compound containing [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] in the ratio of two to one, with the oxygen atom between the two hydrogen atoms, and an angle of 104.5° between them. Compounds are formed and interconverted by [[chemical reaction]]s. ===Substance=== {{Main|Chemical substance}} A chemical substance is a kind of matter with a definite [[chemical composition|composition]] and set of [[chemical properties|properties]].<ref>{{Cite book| title = General Chemistry | author = Hill, J.W.; Petrucci, R.H.; McCreary, T.W.; Perry, S.S. | edition = 4th | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | city = Upper Saddle River, NJ | year = 2005 | page = 37}}</ref> Strictly speaking, a mixture of compounds, elements or compounds and elements is not a chemical substance, but it may be called a chemical. Most of the substances we encounter in our daily life are some kind of mixture; for example: [[Earth's atmosphere|air]], [[alloy]]s, [[biomass]], etc. Nomenclature of substances is a critical part of the language of chemistry. Generally it refers
