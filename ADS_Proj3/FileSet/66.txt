'''AMD Stream Processor''' for a short period of time, utilizing the [[stream processing]] concept, together with [[Close to Metal]] (CTM) hardware interface. ==ATI graphics drivers== ===Proprietary=== {{Main|ATI Catalyst}} ATI currently provides proprietary graphics [[Device Driver|drivers]], and also assists development of open source drivers. The proprietary drivers are called ATI Catalyst, and are available for most platforms: [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Vista]], [[Microsoft]] [[Windows 7]], [[Mac OS X]], and [[Linux]]. Linux users can also opt to use open source drivers. ===Open source=== {{Main|Graphics hardware and FOSS#ATI/AMD|l1=Graphics hardware and FOSS}} Hardware component companies which only provide proprietary drivers have always been urged by the Linux community to open source their drivers, or at least provide the necessary documentation for the community to write their own drivers. In a 2002 interview with AMD official Hal Speed, it was suggested that AMD were strongly considering making the functional part of the ATI drivers open source<ref>[http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/08/02/32OPcurve_1.html 'AMD talks about ATI' at InfoWorld.com]</ref>. However, until the merger with AMD, ATI had no plans to release their graphics drivers as open source code: {{Quote|Proprietary, patented optimizations are part of the value we provide to our customers and we have no plans to release these drivers to open source. In addition, multimedia elements such as content protection must not, by their very nature, be allowed to go open source.|[http://news.com.com/2061-10791_3-6104655.html ATI statement, August 2006]}} Since 2007 ATI has cooperated with the development of open source graphics drivers. Although ATI has not made their Catalyst drivers open source, the programming specifications for a number of chipsets and features were published in several rounds. This greatly changed their support of the development of open source graphics drivers, as until that moment only unsupported open source drivers existed. Besides releasing the specifications, ATI also funded the development of new open source drivers, by Novell, for the newest generation of video cards. ==See also== {{Portal|Companies}} *[[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] *[[Comparison of ATI chipsets]] *[[Comparison of ATI Graphics Processing Units]] *[[Fglrx]] – Linux display driver used for ATI video cards *[[Radeon]] *[[Radeon R800]] *[[Video card]] *[[Video In Video Out|Video In Video Out (VIVO)]] ===Competing Companies=== *[[Nvidia]] *[[Matrox]] ==References== {{Reflist|2}} ==External links== {{Wikinews|AMD joins forces with ATI}} {{Commons category|ATI}} *[http://ati.amd.com/products/ AMD's Graphics Division] *[http://game.amd.com/ AMD GAME! - AMD's gaming website] *[http://www.ati.com/companyinfo/milestones/CorporateMilestones.pdf ATI Corporate Milestones document] *[http://firingsquad.com/features/atihistory/ FiringSquad's History of ATI] *[http://www.amd.com/us-en/0,,3715_14197_14198,00.html?redir=goBG01 Official AMD ATI Merger Site on AMD Website] {{ATI}} {{Home theater PC (application software)}} {{Coord|43|50|22.175|N|79|22|51.388|W|type:landmark|display=title}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Ati Technologies}} [[Category:Advanced Micro Devices]] [[Category:Companies established in 1985]] [[Category:Companies based in Markham, Ontario]] [[Category:Companies formerly listed on NASDAQ]] [[Category:Graphics hardware companies]] [[Category:Electronics companies of Canada]] [[Category:Fabless semiconductor companies]] [[Category:ATI Technologies| ]] <!--interwiki--> [[ar:إيه تي آي تكنولوجيز]] [[bs:ATI Technologies]] [[cs:ATI]] [[da:ATI]] [[de:ATI Technologies]] [[es:ATI Technologies]] [[fa:ای‌تی‌آی]] [[fr:ATI Technologies]] [[gl:ATI Technologies]] [[ko:ATI 테크놀로지스]] [[hr:ATI]] [[id:ATI Technologies]] [[it:ATI Technologies]] [[he:ATI טכנולוגיות]] [[hu:ATI Technologies]] [[ml:എ.ടി.ഐ. ടെക്നോളജീസ്]] [[ms:ATI Technologies]] [[nl:ATI]] [[ja:ATI Technologies]] [[no:ATI]] [[pl:ATI Technologies]] [[pt:ATI Technologies]] [[ro:ATI Technologies]] [[ru:ATI Technologies]] [[simple:ATI Technologies]] [[sk:ATI Technologies]] [[sl:ATI Technologies]] [[fi:ATI Technologies]] [[sv:ATI Technologies]] [[tr:ATI]] [[uk:ATI Technologies]] [[vi:ATI Technologies]] [[zh:ATI技術公司]]</text> </page> <page> <id>590</id> <title>ATI XGP</title> <text>{{distinguish2|a concept portable game console, [[XGP|eXtreme Game Player]] (XGP)}} ATI XGP (e'''X'''ternal '''G'''raphics '''P'''latform) is an external graphics solution for [[Laptop|notebook computers]]. The technology was announced on June 4, 2008 on [[Computex]] 2008 trade show, following the announcement of the codenamed ''[[AMD mobile platform#Puma platform|Puma]]'' notebook platform. __NOTOC__ ==Development== Originally reported by Hexus.net as a side project to the R600 series graphics cards. Codenamed ''Lasso'' <ref>[http://www.hexus.net/content/item.php?item=7995 Hexus.Net report], retrieved June 16, 2008</ref>, the project is an external graphics solution using desktop video cards, and data is sent via two cables as defined in PCI-E external cabling specification (version 1.0). The project would later fall into [[development hell]] with unknown development status. In June 2008, near Computex 2008, rumours surfaced over the Internet about AMD is preparing an external graphics solution for notebook computers, but using a proprietary connectivity solution instead. The ATI XGP was officially announced on June 4, 2008 during the course of the Computex 2008 exhibition. ==Technology== The XGP platform consists of several parts, that includes a mobility Radeon HD graphics card, an external case and a proprietary connectivity solution. ===Graphics=== *Single GPU configuration **[[Radeon R600#Radeon HD 3800|Mobility Radeon HD 3870]] (M88 core) ***[[AVIVO#AVIVO HD|AVIVO HD]] with [[Unified Video Decoder|UVD]] ***Integrated [[High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection|HDCP]] **[[Evergreen (GPU family)|Mobility Radeon HD 5870]] (Broadway core) *[[ATI CrossFire|ATI CrossFire X]] technology (Dual GPU configuration) **Mobility Radeon HD 3850 X2 **Mobility Radeon HD 3870 X2 ===Connectivity=== ====Data==== *Proprietary connectivity solution designed in collaboration with [[JAE Electronics]] **Transfer PCI-E 2.0 signals between XGP and the notebook computer **PCI-E 2.0 compliant **8 lanes and 16 lanes option available **[[Hot swapping|Hot plug]] detection **AMD has one year exclusivity on the use of the connector <ref>[http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/37946/135/ TGDaily report]: AMD has a one-year exclusive on the PCIe External connector.

It is developed as a numerical inviscid flux function for solving a general system of conservation equations. It is based on the upwind concept and was motivated to provide an alternative approach to other upwind methods, such as the Godunov method, flux difference splitting methods by Roe, and Solomon and Osher, flux vector splitting methods by Van Leer, and Steger and Warming. The AUSM first recognizes that the inviscid flux consist of two physically distinct parts, i.e., convective and pressure fluxes. The former is associated with the flow (advection) speed, while the latter with the acoustic
