planned for 2011{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} | website = }} '''id Tech 4''', popularly known as the '''Doom 3 engine''', is a [[game engine]] developed by [[id Software]] and first used in the [[video game]] ''[[Doom 3]]''. The engine was designed by [[John D. Carmack|John Carmack]], who also created previous engines such as those for [[Doom engine|Doom]] and [[Quake engine|Quake]], which are also widely recognized as marking significant advances in the field. This [[OpenGL]] rendered engine has been used in games like ''[[Doom 3]]'', ''[[Enemy Territory: Quake Wars]]'', ''[[Wolfenstein (2009 video game)|Wolfenstein]]'' and ''[[Brink (video game)|Brink]]''. == History == id Tech 4 began as an enhancement to [[id Tech 3]]. During development, it was initially just a complete rewrite of the engine's [[Rendering (computer graphics)|renderer]], while still retaining other subsystems, such as file access, and memory management. The decision to switch from [[C Programming Language|C]] to the [[C++]] [[programming language]] necessitated a restructuring and rewrite of the rest of the engine; today, while id Tech 4 contains code from id Tech 3, much of it has been rewritten.<ref>[http://archive.gamespy.com/e32002/pc/carmack/ Q&A with John Carmack, E3 2002]</ref> At the [[QuakeCon]] 2007, [[John D. Carmack|John Carmack]], the lead graphics engine developer at id, said to [[LinuxGames]]: "I mean, I won't commit to a date, but the Doom 3 stuff will be open source". And like its predecessors, John Carmack has said that id Tech 4 will be released as [[open source]].<ref>[http://www.linuxgames.com/archives/9374 LinuxGames - Embrace your inner penguin<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> At the QuakeCon 2009, Carmack said that he planned to petition [[ZeniMax Media]] to release the id Tech 4 source upon the release of [[Rage (video game)|Rage]] (expected in 2011).<ref>http://kotaku.com/5336589/the-john-carmack-keynote-liveblogging-quakecon</ref> ===Hardware=== The original requirement of id Tech 4 was that it needed a high-end graphics processing unit (GPU) with fully programmable vertex and pixel shaders, such as the [[Nvidia]] [[GeForce 3]] or [[ATI]] [[Radeon 8500]], with at least 64 MB of VRAM. By E3 2002, the recommended GPU was "100% DirectX 9.0b compatible", such as the [[Radeon 9700]] with 128 MB of VRAM. While the Radeon 9700's DirectX 9.0 features are not necessary to render the game, its advanced architecture, 256-bit memory bus, and efficiency were needed to run Doom 3 at high detail and playable speed.<ref>[http://www.neowin.net/news/main/02/07/20/atis-radeon-9700-takes-performance-lead]</ref> id Tech 4 resulted in the obsolescence of DirectX 7 graphics chips such as the widespread [[GeForce 2]] and [[Radeon R100|Radeon 7200]], as well as older chipsets such as [[RIVA TNT2]] and [[Rage 128]], and software rendering (with an integrated [[Intel GMA]]). Until the advent of id Tech 4, a powerful CPU was able to somewhat compensate for an older video card. While [[John D. Carmack|John Carmack]] initially warned gamers not to purchase the [[GeForce 4]] MX<ref>[http://www.bluesnews.com/cgi-bin/finger.pl?id=1&time=20020211165445 .plan File for John Carmack (February 11, 2002)]</ref> (which casual consumers often confused with the DirectX 8 capable GeForce 4 Ti, though it was at best an improved [[GeForce 2]]), its somewhat widespread adoption compelled id Software to add it to the list of supported cards. There have been cases of enthusiasts forcing ''[[Doom 3]]'' to run on unsupported graphics chips, such as the long obsolete [[Voodoo 2]], but these are unable to render the per-pixel lighting and bump mapping.<ref>[http://www.3dfxzone.it/enboard/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=1462]</ref> == Features == [[Image:Doom3shadows2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The shadowing effects of the Unified lighting and shadowing engine are shown on the face and body of the zombies in this screenshot of ''Doom 3'']] === Graphics === Id Tech 4 added several new graphical features absent in its predecessor, [[id Tech 3]]. These included [[bump mapping]], [[normal mapping]], and [[specular highlight]]ing. More features were added in the development of successive games, and in yet unreleased games using id Tech 4, new features have been added or are planned to be added soon. The primary innovation of id Tech 4 was its use of entirely dynamic [[per-pixel lighting]], whereas previously, 3D engines had relied primarily on pre-calculated per-vertex lighting or [[lightmap]]s and [[Gouraud shading]]. While dynamic effects had been available before (such as dynamic moving lights), this effect merely changed the brightness of the vertices of the polygon, with the pixel's colors simply being interpolated between the three vertex colors of its polygon. This fully realtime approach used in ''Doom 3'', combined with the use of shadow volumes permitted more realistic lighting and shadows<ref>[http://www.digit-life.com/articles2/doom3/doom3.html Doom 3<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> than in the previous generation of id's engines. The method used to create the shadow volumes is the subject of a patent by Creative, which Creative granted id permission to use in the ''Doom 3'' engine, in exchange for supporting Creative's EAX advanced sound technologies.<ref>[http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2004/07/4048.ars John Carmack: "This sucks."]</ref> The models used in ''id Tech 4'' engine games are animated using [[skeletal animation]]. The engine can blend multiple animations together, to produce a skin that moves correctly for those animations. Because this is CPU intensive, id did some work optimising this using the use of [[Intel]]'s [[Streaming SIMD Extensions]] to gain the best possible performance.<ref>[http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/optimizing-the-rendering-pipeline-of-animated-models-using-the-intel-streaming-simd-extensions/ Optimizing the Rendering Pipeline of Animated Models Using the Intel Streaming SIMD Extensions]</ref> === MegaTexture rendering technology === {{main|MegaTexture}} The original version of the id Tech 4 engine was criticized for its perceived inability to handle large outdoor areas. The MegaTexture technology not only removed this issue by introducing a means to create expansive outdoor scenes but also made the new version as the best game engine to handle the outdoor areas, as well. By painting a single massive texture (32,768Ã—32,768 [[pixel]]s, though it has been extended to larger dimensions in recent versions of the MegaTexture technology) covering the entire polygon map and highly detailed terrain, the desired effects can be achieved. The MegaTexture can also store physical information about the terrain such as the amount of traction in certain areas or indicate what sound effect should be played when walking over specific parts of the map. i.e. walking on rock will sound different from walking on grass.<ref>[http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/enemy-territory-quake-wars/681231p1.html GameSpy: Enemy Territory: Quake Wars Preview<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It is expected that this will result in a considerably more detailed scene
