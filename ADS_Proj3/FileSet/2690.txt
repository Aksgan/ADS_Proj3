Roughly speaking, the discrepancy of a sequence is low if the number of points in the sequence falling into an arbitrary set ''B'' is close to proportional to the measure of ''B'', as would happen on average (but not for particular samples) in the case of a uniform distribution. Specific definitions of discrepancy differ regarding the choice of ''B'' (hyperspheres, hypercubes, etc.) and how the discrepancy for every B is computed (usually normalized) and combined (usually by taking the worst value). Low-discrepancy sequences are also called '''quasi-random''' or '''sub-random''' sequences, due to their common use as a replacement of uniformly distributed [[random sequence|random numbers]]. The "quasi" modifier is used to denote more clearly that the values of a low-discrepancy sequence are neither random nor pseudorandom, but such sequences share some properties of random variables and in certain applications such as the [[quasi-Monte Carlo method]] their lower discrepancy is an important advantage. At least three methods of [[numerical integration]] can be phrased as follows. Given a set {''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''N''</sub>} in the interval <nowiki>[0,1]</nowiki>, approximate the integral of a function ''f'' as the average of the function evaluated at those points: :<math> \int_0^1 f(u)\,du \approx \frac{1}{N}\,\sum_{i=1}^N f(x_i). </math> If the points are chosen as ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''i''/''N'', this is the ''rectangle rule''. If the points are chosen to be randomly (or [[pseudorandom]]ly) distributed, this is the ''[[Monte Carlo method]]''. If the points are chosen as elements of a low-discrepancy sequence, this is the ''quasi-Monte Carlo method''. A remarkable result, the '''Koksma–Hlawka inequality''', shows that the error of such a method can be bounded by the product of two terms, one of which depends only on ''f'', and the other one is the discrepancy of the set {''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''N''</sub>}. The Koksma–Hlawka inequality is stated below. It is convenient to construct the set {''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''N''</sub>} in such a way that if a set with ''N''+1 elements is constructed, the previous ''N'' elements need not be recomputed. The rectangle rule uses points set which have low discrepancy, but in general the elements must be recomputed if ''N'' is increased. Elements need not be recomputed in the Monte Carlo method if ''N'' is increased, but the point sets do not have minimal discrepancy. By using low-discrepancy sequences, the quasi-Monte Carlo method has the desirable features of the other two methods. ==Definition of discrepancy== The ''discrepancy'' of a set P = {''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''N''</sub>} is defined, using Niederreiter's notation, as :<math> D_N(P) = \sup_{B\in J} \left| \frac{A(B;P)}{N} - \lambda_s(B) \right|</math> where λ<sub>''s''</sub> is the ''s''-dimensional [[Lebesgue measure]], ''A''(''B'';''P'') is the number of points in ''P'' that fall into ''B'', and ''J'' is the set of ''s''-dimensional intervals or boxes of the form :<math> \prod_{i=1}^s [a_i, b_i) = \{ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbf{R}^s : a_i \le x_i < b_i \} \, </math> where <math> 0 \le a_i < b_i \le 1 </math>. The ''star-discrepancy'' ''D''<sup>*</sup><sub>''N''</sub>(''P'') is defined similarly, except that the supremum is taken over the set ''J''<sup>*</sup> of intervals of the form :<math> \prod_{i=1}^s [0, u_i) </math> where ''u''<sub>''i''</sub> is in the half-open interval <nowiki>[0, 1)</nowiki>. The two are related by :<math>D^*_N \le D_N \le 2^s D^*_N . \,</math> ==Graphical examples== The points plotted below are the first 100, 1000, and 10000 elements in a sequence of the Sobol' type. For comparison, 10000 elements of a sequence of pseudorandom points are also shown. The low-discrepancy sequence was generated by [[TOMS]] algorithm 659, described by P. Bratley and B.L. Fox in ''ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software'', vol. 14, no. 1, pp 88—100.

Let ''f'' have [[bounded variation]] ''V(f)'' on Ī<sup>''s''</sup> in the sense of [[G.H. Hardy|Hardy]] and Krause. Then for any ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''N''</sub> in ''I''<sup>''s''</sup> = <nowiki>[</nowiki>0, 1<nowiki>)</nowiki> &times; ... &times; <nowiki>[</nowiki>0, 1<nowiki>)</nowiki>, : <math> \left| \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N f(x_i) - \int_{\bar I^s} f(u)\,du \right| \le V(f)\, D_N^* (x_1,\ldots,x_N). </math> The [[Jurjen Ferdinand Koksma|Koksma]]-Hlawka inequality is sharp in the following sense: For any point set {''x''<sub>1</sub>,...,''x''<sub>N</sub>} in ''I''<sup>s</sup> and any <math>\epsilon>0</math>, there is a function ''f'' with bounded variation and ''V(f)=1'' such that :<math> \left| \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N f(x_i) - \int_{\bar I^s} f(u)\,du \right|>D_{N}^{*}(x_1,\ldots,x_N)-\epsilon. </math> Therefore, the quality of a numerical integration rule depends only on the discrepancy D<sup>*</sup><sub>N</sub>(''x''<sub>1</sub>,...,''x''<sub>N</sub>). ==The formula of Hlawka-Zaremba== Let <math>D=\{1,2,\ldots,d\}</math>. For <math>\emptyset\neq u\subseteq D</math> we write :<math> dx_u:=\prod_{j\in u} dx_j </math> and denote by <math>(x_u,1)</math> the point obtained from ''x'' by replacing the coordinates not in ''u'' by <math>1</math>.
