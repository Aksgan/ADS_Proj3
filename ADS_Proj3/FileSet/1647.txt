The application comes with a library of behaviors (for movement, changing attribute states, affecting collision, saving, etc.) that can be inserted into rules and other behavior groups to create new behavior. == Other major features == * '''Cross-platform publishing''' - GameSalad has one common dialog-based interface for publishing to multiple platforms such as the iPhone and the web.<ref name="product page">{{cite web | url=http://gamesalad.com/products/creator | title=GameSalad Creator Product Page | publisher=Gendai Games}}</ref> * '''Real-time editing''' -- Users can edit a scene while the game is running. The initial state of actors can be toggled to be displayed translucently to show their original orientation when the scene started playing.<ref name="product page"/> * '''Game preview''' -- GameSalad has a specific preview mode for debugging and testing the performance and memory usage of games on the desktop and the iPhone. A viewer application can be installed separately onto an iPhone so that users can click a toolbar button in GameSalad to upload games onto the iPhone over a wireless network.<ref name="product page"/> * '''Scene editor''' -- Users can place and manipulate actors in a scene. Actors are added to the scene by dragging and dropping.

In many cases, they are bootlegged/pirated/unlicensed. These kind of game systems are often sold online, or at [[flea markets]] especially in developing countries, where it is seen as an affordable alternative to more expensive consoles such as the [[PlayStation 3]] or [[Xbox 360]]. Game system clones come in a variety of styles, shell shapes, etc. In some cases, a game system clone will have built-in games, and a cartridge slot for expansion. One of the most cloned game systems of all time is the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES). One of the most popular [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] clones was the [[Russia]]n [[Dendy (console)|Dendy]] game console.
