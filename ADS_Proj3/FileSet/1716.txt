It is available under the [[CDDL]] and [[GPLv2]] (with classpath exception.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metro.java.net/discover/faq.html|title=metro: Metro FAQ}}</ref> It is supported by [[Sun Microsystems]]. == History == Originally, the Glassfish project developed two semi-independent project : *JAX-WS RI, the Reference implementation of the [[JAX-WS]] specification *[[WSIT]], a Java implementation of some of the [[WS-*]] and an enhanced support for interoperability with the [[.NET Framework]]. It is based on JAX-WS RI as "Web Service layer". In June 2007, it has been decided to bundle these two components as a single component named '''Metro'''[http://blogs.sun.com/arungupta/entry/announcing_metro_naming_the_web]. == Market share == Metro is bundled with [[Java Platform, Standard Edition|Java SE]] 6 in order to allow consumers of Java SE 6 to consume Web Services [https://jax-ws.dev.java.net/faq/index.html#different_versions] Metro is bundled with numerous Application Servers [http://blogs.sun.com/theaquarium/entry/metro_now_on_tomcat_6] such as : * [[GlassFish]] * [[Sun Java System Application Server]] Platform Edition 9.x * [[Oracle Weblogic Server|Oracle WebLogic Server]] * [[JBoss]] (version 5.x only) * [[TmaxSoft]] JEUS 6.x The [[JAXB]] reference implementation developed for Metro is used in virtually every Java Web Services framework ([[Apache Axis2]], [[Codehaus XFire]], [[Apache CXF]]) and Application Servers. == Features == Metro compares well with other web service frameworks in terms of functionality. A comparison is provided by Codehaus at [http://xfire.codehaus.org/Stack+Comparison], which compares [[Apache Axis]] 1.x, Axis 2.x, Celtix, Glue, JBossWS, Xfire 1.2 and JAX-WS RI + WSIT (the bundle was not yet named Metro at this time). == See also == {{Portal|Free software}} * [[Apache CXF]] ==References== <small><references/></small> ==External links== *[https://metro.dev.java.net/ Official website] [[Category:Web services]] [[Category:Web service specifications]] [[Category:Free software programmed in Java]] [[Category:Java programming language]] [[pt:GlassFish Metro]]</text> </page> <page> <id>15327</id> <title>Glee.com</title> <text>{{Infobox Company |name = GLEE |logo = |owner = Community Connect Inc |type = Social networking company |foundation = 2007 |location_city = 205 Hudson Street, 6th Floor<br>[[New York]] |location_country = USA |location = <!--modifies "Headquarters" entry--> |locations = <!--# of locations--> |homepage = [http://www.glee.com glee.com] }} '''GLEE.com''' is a [[social networking]] site that is geared toward the [[gay]], [[lesbian]], [[bisexual]] and [[Transgender|trans]] communities.The site was launched in February 2007 by [[Community Connect Inc]]. Community Connect operates several [[niche market]] social networking sites and GLEE is their latest venture. As with their other social network sites, GLEE is modeled after the popular [[MySpace]] and [[Facebook]] offering many of the same features. Currently GLEE.com is available only in the English language and primarily the North American market with approximately 86% of its users in the United States.<ref>[http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details/glee.com Alexa:internet traffic report for November 07]</ref> However, as of October 2008 it is blocking countries such as the UK and Netherlands, possibly with more of Europe affected too; the true extent is unknown. A Glee.com spokesperson purports this move was due to "spammer" activity. ==Operations== The site is free to users, generating revenues through advertising. Users register and create profiles, which can include a variety of layout themes for profiles, users also have the option of custom designing a profile layout. Typically, profiles might include uploaded photo albums, music players, lists of interests and friends list. Other features include blog hosting,video hosting, groups, style and news sections, and community bulletin boards covering a variety of issues but with the added emphasis on those issues of importance to the [[LGBT]] community. [[Instant messaging]], and email is available with other registered users. In addition profiles are allowed a mirror on Glee.com's professional networking site, which allows for job search (through an arrangement with [[Monster.com]]) along with the other features found on the social network. ==Publicity== GLEE.com's launch in early 2007 received generally favorable coverage in internet focused media, with the caveat about competition from established sites and others still on the drawing board divvying up the niche market for potential LGBT users.<ref>[http://mashable.com/2007/01/29/glee-gay-lesbian-social-network/ Mashable.com on Glee Launch]</ref> In October 2007 GLEE.com received free publicity from an unlikely source, the [[Military of the United States|United States military]].<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/10/18/the_skinny/main3379904.shtml CBSNews Military ads on Glee]</ref><ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-10-17-gayads_N.htm USA Today on Military Ads on Glee]</ref> The advertising firm that handles the military's recruiting advertising inadventantly placed the ads on the site. The mainstream and LGBT press along with several comedians picked up on the gaffe of advertising to an audience that the U.S. military actively bars from joining through its [[Don't ask, don't tell]] policy. ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.glee.com Glee.com] *[http://www.communityconnect.com Community Connect Inc Home page] {{DEFAULTSORT:Glee.Com}} [[Category:Community websites]] [[Category:Companies based in New York City]] [[Category:Global internet community]] [[Category:Social network services]] [[Category:Virtual communities]] [[es:Glee.com]]</text> </page> <page> <id>15351</id> <title>Global Change Master Directory</title> <text>The '''Global Change Master Directory''' is a directory of Earth Science data sets and related tools/services, many of which are targeted for the use, analysis, and display of the data.
