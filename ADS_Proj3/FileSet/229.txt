This can be achieved by using a central server or [[Direct Connect (file sharing)#Hubs|hub]] to authenticate clients, in which case the functionality is similar to a private [[FTP]] server, but with files transferred directly between the clients. Alternatively, users can exchange passwords or keys with their friends to form a decentralized network. ===Friend-to-friend clients=== [[Friend-to-friend]] networks are P2P networks that allows users only to make direct connections with people they know. Passwords or digital signatures can be used for authentication. ===Hypothetical or defunct networks=== ====Hypothetical==== The following networks only exist as design or are in development * [[Crowds]] - Reiter and Rubin's system for "blending into a crowd" has a known attack * [http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/egs/herbivore/ Herbivore] - a distributed anonymous [[Dining cryptographers protocol|DC]]-communication system, providing private file sharing and messaging, under development at the Cornell University. * [[P2PRIV]] - Peer-to-Peer diRect and anonymous dIstribution oVerlay - anonymity via virtual links parallelization - currently in development and has significant, unsolved problems in a real world environment * [[Phantom Anonymity Protocol|Phantom]] - a fully decentralized high-throughput anonymization network currently working on a plan to implement it * [[Ano]] - extensible IP anonymizer with steganography support (in development) ====Defunct or dormant==== * [[Invisible IRC Project]] - anonymous [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] * [[Mnet (Computer program)|Mnet]] - a [[distributed file system]] - inactive now * [[Bitblinder]] - a decentralised p2p anonymity software program which included Tor but with increased speed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Website is down and clients are no longer functional. ===Anonymous P2P in a wireless mesh network=== It is possible to implement anonymous P2P on a [[wireless mesh network]]; unlike fixed internet connections, users don't need to sign up with an ISP to participate in such a network, and are only identifiable through their hardware. Even if a government were to outlaw the use of wireless P2P software, it would be difficult to enforce such a ban without a considerable infringement of personal freedoms. Alternatively, the government could outlaw the purchase of the wireless hardware itself. Protocols for wireless mesh networks are [[OLSR]] and the follow-up protocol [[B.A.T.M.A.N.]], which is designed for decentralized auto-IP assignment.

The bank issues currency in the form of electronic tokens that can be converted on presentation to the bank to some other currency. This concept has a long history in which [[free banking]] institutions have issued their own paper currency often backed by a physical commodity. ==History== Whilst the academic study of trust relationships and systems has long been the forte of [[intelligence services]] such as the [[United States|American]] [[NSA]], the growth of the internet in the [[1990s]] and the contemporary declassification of related knowledge allowed for greater public discussion of the potential for anonymous banking services by groups such as the [[Cryptoanarchy|cryptoanarchists]] and [[cypherpunks]]. ==Implemented systems== Examples of anonymous internet banking services and software that have already been implemented include: *[[eCache]]: an anonymous bank operating over the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] network. *[[Bitcoin]]: distributed [[P2P]] cryptocurrency. *[[Pecunix]]: an (optionally?) anonymous digital gold currency. *[[Yodelbank]]: an anonymous bank built on top of various digital gold currencies which ended operations during November 2005. *[[Open Transactions]]: Open-source software, including a library, server, and test client, implementing untraceable digital cash and anonymous numbered accounts. ==The underlying mathematics== Anonymous internet banking depends on the mathematics of [[public key cryptography]] and [[blind signature]] algorithms. In this simple example we have [[Alice and Bob]] and a banker. The banker generates an [[RSA]] public key with modulus <math>n= P Q</math>, where <math>P</math> and <math>Q</math> are large [[Prime number|primes]], making <math>n</math> a [[semiprime]]. As described in [[RSA#Operation|RSA operation]], the bank also generates public key exponent <math>e</math> and private key exponent <math>d</math>. Bob asks the banker
