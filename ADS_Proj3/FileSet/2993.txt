that are sequences of moments of some function ''f''. ==Partial moments== Partial moments are sometimes referred to as "one-sided moments." The ''n''th order lower and upper partial moments with respect to a reference point ''r'' may be expressed as :<math>\mu_n^-(r)=\int_{-\infty}^r (r - x)^n\,f(x)\,dx,</math> :<math>\mu_n^+(r)=\int_r^\infty (x - r)^n\,f(x)\,dx.</math> Partial moments are normalized by being raised to the power 1/''n''. The [[upside potential ratio]] may be expressed as a ratio of a first-order upper partial moment to a normalized second-order lower partial moment. ==Moments in metric spaces== Let (''M'', ''d'') be a [[metric space]], and let B(''M'') be the [[Borel sigma algebra|Borel &sigma;-algebra]] on ''M'', the [[sigma algebra|&sigma;-algebra]] generated by the ''d''-[[open set|open subsets]] of ''M''. (For technical reasons, it is also convenient to assume that ''M'' is a [[separable space]] with respect to the [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] ''d''.) Let 1 ≤ ''p'' ≤ +∞. The '''''p''<sup>th</sup> moment''' of a measure ''μ'' on the [[measurable space]] (''M'', B(''M'')) about a given point ''x''<sub>0</sub> in ''M'' is defined to be :<math>\int_{M} d(x, x_{0})^{p} \, \mathrm{d} \mu (x).</math> ''μ'' is said to have '''finite ''p''<sup>th</sup> moment''' if the ''p''<sup>th</sup> moment of ''μ'' about ''x''<sub>0</sub> is finite for some ''x''<sub>0</sub> ∈ ''M''. This terminology for measures carries over to random variables in the usual way: if (Ω, Σ, '''P''') is a [[probability space]] and ''X'' : Ω → ''M'' is a random variable, then the '''''p''<sup>th</sup> moment''' of ''X'' about ''x''<sub>0</sub> ∈ ''M'' is defined to be :<math>\int_{M} d (x, x_{0})^{p} \, \mathrm{d} \left( X_{*} (\mathbf{P}) \right) (x) \equiv \int_{\Omega} d (X(\omega), x_{0})^{p} \, \mathrm{d} \mathbf{P} (\omega),</math> and ''X'' has '''finite ''p''<sup>th</sup> moment''' if the ''p''<sup>th</sup> moment of ''X'' about ''x''<sub>0</sub> is finite for some ''x''<sub>0</sub> ∈ ''M''. ==See also== * [[Hamburger moment problem]] * [[Hausdorff moment problem]] * [[Image moments]] * [[L-moment]] * [[Method of moments]] * [[Second moment method]] * [[Standardized moment]] * [[Stieltjes moment problem]] * [[Taylor expansions for the moments of functions of random variables]] ==External links== <references/> *[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/topics/Moments.html Moments at Mathworld] *[http://www.geo.upm.es/postgrado/CarlosLopez/geost_03/node37.html Higher Moments] {{Theory of probability distributions}} {{Statistics|descriptive}} [[Category:Probability theory]] [[Category:Mathematical analysis]] [[Category:Theory of probability distributions]] [[ar:عزم (رياضيات)]] [[de:Moment (Stochastik)]] [[fr:Moment (mathématiques)]] [[it:Momento (statistica)]] [[hu:Momentum]] [[ja:モーメント (数学)]] [[pl:Moment (matematyka)]] [[pt:Momento não-centrado]] [[ru:Моменты случайной величины]] [[sl:Moment (matematika)]] [[sv:Moment (matematik)]] [[tr:Momentler]] [[uk:Моменти випадкової величини]] [[zh:矩 (數學)]]</text> </page> <page> <id>24998</id> <title>Mondex</title> <text>[[File:Mondex logo.svg|thumb|Mondex's logo.|180px]] '''Mondex''' is a [[smart card]] [[electronic cash]] system which was originally developed by [[National Westminster Bank]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and subsequently sold to [[MasterCard International]]. Mondex launched in a number of markets during the 1990s, expanding from an original trial in [[Swindon]], UK to [[Hong Kong]], [[Guelph]], and [[New York]] [http://www.efc.ca/pages/media/globe.01nov98.html]. It was also trialled on several British university campuses from the late 1990s, including the [[University of Edinburgh]], [[University of Exeter]] (between 1997 and 2001), [[University of York]], [[University of Nottingham]], [[Aston University]] and [[Sheffield Hallam University]]. The [[Z notation]] was used to prove security properties about Mondex, allowing it to achieve [[ITSEC]] level E6, ITSEC's highest granted security-level classification.<ref>Susan Stepney, David Cooper, and [[Jim Woodcock]], ''[http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~susan/bib/ss/z/prg126.pdf An Electronic Purse: Specification, Refinement, and Proof]''.

Money originated as [[commodity money]], but nearly all contemporary money systems are based on [[fiat money]].<ref name="mankiw"/> Fiat money is without intrinsic [[use value]] as a physical commodity, and derives its value by being declared by a government to be [[legal tender]]; that is, it must be accepted as a form of payment within the boundaries of the country, for "all debts, public and private". The [[money supply]] of a country consists of [[currency]] (banknotes and coins) and [[demand deposits]] or 'bank money' (the balance held in [[checking accounts]] and [[savings accounts]]). These [[demand deposit]]s usually account for a much larger part of the money supply than currency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiafed.org/education/money-in-motion/treasure-trove/ |title=Learn More About Coins and Money  Treasure Trove - Philadelphia Fed |publisher=Philadelphia Fed. |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/on2/money/history.html |title=On2 Money / A History of Money |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref> As noted, [[bank money]] is intangible and exists only in the form of various bank records, but still serves as money.<ref>Bernstein, Peter, ''A Primer on Money and Banking, and Gold'', Wiley, 2008 edition, pp29-39</ref> == History == [[File:BMC 06.jpg|thumb|left|A 640 BC one-third [[stater]] [[electrum]] coin from [[Lydia#First coinage|Lydia]].]] {{Main|History of money}} The use of [[barter]]-like methods may date back
