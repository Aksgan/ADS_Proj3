On its 9th anniversary (4 December 2010), ''CozyCot'' started the campaign "Surrender Your Bras for a Cause", encouraging women to donate bras to those less fortunate in Southeast Asia, in the hope of making Singaporean women more aware of the lack of basic necessities like bras among women and young girls in neighbouring countries.<ref>{{cite web | title = CozyCot 9th Birthday Bash | author= | publisher = | date = | url = http://www.cozycot.com/birthdaybash/media | accessdate = December 24, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Singapore women donate bras to less fortunate in region | author= | publisher = [[Channel News Asia]] | date = May 26, 2010 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1097269/1/.html | accessdate = December 24, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = 募捐舊胸圍送貧困國 | author= | publisher = [[The Sun (Hong Kong)]] | date = | url = http://the-sun.on.cc/cnt/china_world/20101207/00423_080.html?pubdate=20101207 | accessdate = December 24, 2010}}</ref> == Related publications == In April 2010, a [[newspaper]] named ''CozyCot'' was launched as a 25-pages free monthly publication with a print run of 200,000.<ref name="M.i."/> == Awards == CozyCot has won Singapore's First Women's Site Award at ''Hitwise Singapore Online Performance Award'' for four consecutive years since 2006.<ref name="BusinessTimes"/> == References == {{Reflist|2}} == External links == * {{official|http://www.cozycot.com/}} [[Category:Fashion organizations]] [[Category:Beauty organisations]] [[Category:Review websites]] [[Category:Virtual communities]] [[Category:Commerce websites]] [[Category:Singaporean women]] [[Category:Events in Singapore]] [[de:CozyCot]] [[es:CozyCot]] [[ko:코지콧]] [[id:CozyCot]] [[ms:CozyCot]] [[ja:CozyCot]] [[tl:CozyCot]] [[th:โคซีคอต]] [[vi:CozyCot]] [[zh:CozyCot]]</text> </page> <page> <id>8331</id> <title>Cpuinfo falsification</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=February 2009}} {{lowercase}} '''cpuinfo falsification''' is a [[Lowest common denominator (computers)|lowest common denominator]] technique that can be used on [[GNU]] operating systems to provide backwards compatible behaviour of the compiler and software tools. This technique is typically used on [[IBM compatible]] computers using [[80x86]] series processors, but can be used on other architectures, where applicable. == Background == On [[GNU]] based [[operating system]]s, some software tools, such as the [[compiler]] and package building tools, detect [[CPU]] specific extensions that are incompatible with existing machines. This may cause incompatibility issues during compilation or operation of [[software]] on computers being utilized as [[backward compatible]] replacements. === The cpuinfo falsification project === The '''cpuinfo falsification project''' provides an assortment of patches to the [[GNU operating system]] to provide [[i386]] compatible behaviour of the compiler and software tools without the need for explicit [[cross compilation]]. ==== setarch ==== The Unix [[setarch]] command provides the facility to generate falsified generic architecture information for system building. However, this does not currently work on [[GNU]] based [[operating system]]s: # The setarch utility does not work at this time setarch i386 uname -m i686 <--- It's not working. ==== uname_hack ==== The '''uname_hack''' kernel module causes generic architecture information to be provided by the kernel. ==== uname ==== The [[uname]] utility is fixed by loading the [[uname hack]] module. This provides falsified processor information for "[[Lowest common denominator (computers)|lowest common denominator]]" compatibility. uname -m i686 <--- This is no good insmod uname_hack.ko uname -m i386 <--- This will work just fine on a Pentium === /proc/cpuinfo === The /proc/cpuinfo file is patched by using a [[bindmount]] to overlay a file containing falsified [[CPU]] related information: if [ -e /etc/cpuinfo] ; then mount—bind /etc/cpuinfo /proc/cpuinfo fi {{GNU}} [[Category:Compiler optimizations]] {{Compu-prog-stub}} {{linux-stub}} {{free-software-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>8338</id> <title>Craft access system</title> <text>{{Unreferenced stub|auto=yes|date=December 2009}} {{Orphan|date=February
