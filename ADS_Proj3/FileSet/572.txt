It may be used up to and beyond the highest energies of 100 [[exa-|E]][[Electronvolt|eV]]. Program utilizes [[VENUS (model)|VENUS]], [[QGSJET]], and [[DPMJET]] models, which are based on the [[Gribov-Regge theory]] and [[SIBYLL]] based on a [[minijet]] model. [[Hadronic]] interactions at lower energies are described either by the [[GHEISHA]] module, by [[FLUKA]], or by the [[UrQMD]] model. It can be used to simulate the generation of [[Cherenkov radiation]] and [[neutrino]]s. == External links == * [http://www-ik.fzk.de/corsika/ Official site of CORSIKA] * [http://www.cosmicrays.org/muon-corsika.php Cosmic Ray Telescope Muon Detector] * [http://www.citebase.org/abstract?id=oai%3AarXiv.org%3Aastro-ph%2F0103073 Extensive Air Shower Simulations with CORSIKA and the Influence of High-Energy Hadronic Interaction Models] by Heck, D. at [[Citebase]], [http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0103073 oai:arXiv.org:astro-ph/0103073] at [[arXiv]] * [http://www.auger.de/interna/docs/repository/gap_2001_059.ps The Automated Air Shower Generation with CORSIKA at the Computing Center of IN2P3] <small>[[PostScript|PS]]</small> * [http://www-ik.fzk.de/~heck/publications/icrc_durban.ps Recent Extensions to the Air Shower Simulation Program CORSIKA] <small>[[PostScript|PS]]</small>, proceedings of the 25th [[International Cosmic Ray Conference|ICRC]]. {{phys-stub}} {{science-software-stub}} [[Category:Physics software]]</text> </page> <page> <id>5156</id> <title>COSILAB</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=February 2009}} '''COSILAB''' is a software tool for solving complex chemical [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]] problems. It is used worldwide in research and industry, in particular in [[automotive]], [[combustion]], and [[chemical]] processing applications. Problems to be solved by COSILAB may involve thousands of reactions amongst hundreds of species for practically any mixture composition, pressure and temperature. Its computational capabilities allow for a complex [[chemical reaction]] to be studied in detail, including intermediate compounds, trace compounds and [[pollutants]]. Whilst complex chemistry is accounted for, [[chemical reactor]] or [[combustion]] geometries that can be handled by COSILAB are relatively simple. For the purpose of ``real-life" simulations this limitation can be overcome, however, by using a library of pre-compiled subroutines and functions, that one can link to his or her own code written in [[Fortran]], the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] or [[C++]]. In this way, it is possible to develop fully two-dimensional or three-dimensional CFD or [[computational fluid dynamics]] codes that are able to capture fairly realistic geometries. The development of codes like COSILAB is motivated by a worldwide attempt to keep the environment clean and to save -- or at least make best use of -- the continuously diminishing [[fossil fuel]] resources. ==External links== * [http://www.epa.gov/ebtpages/airairponitrogenoxidesnox.html United States Environmental Protection Agency on NOX] * [http://www.worldenergy.org/wec-geis/ World Energy Council] * [http://www.softpredict.com Softpredict's COSILAB page], [[Category:Chemical engineering]] [[Category:Chemical kinetics]] [[Category:Combustion]] [[Category:Computational chemistry software]]</text> </page> <page> <id>5165</id> <title>COmputer STored Ambulatory Record (COSTAR)</title> <text>'''COmputer STored Ambulatory Record (COSTAR)''' is an [[electronic medical record]] using the [[MUMPS]] programming language.

The ability to accurately check a computer system's CPU speed is an important feature for [[overclockers]] who wish to overclock their motherboard and CPU. Processor speed results are displayed in a pop-up window, where users can submit their CPU benchmark results to an online database and compare their processor speed with other users around the world. CPU speed results are stored in an online database and categorized by CPU manufacturers ([[Intel]], [[AMD]]), CPU types and countries. Users can compare [[Benchmark (computing)]] results for their CPU type and also view the top and bottom 100 processor benchmarks. ==See also== * [[CPU speed]] * [[Overclocking]] * [[Benchmark (computing)]] * [[central processing unit]] == External links == * [http://www.cpuspeedpro.com/ Official website] * [http://download.cnet.com/CPU-Speed-Professional/3000-18512_4-194613.html CNET Review] {{Windows-software-stub}} [[Category:Windows-only freeware]] [[Category:Portable software]] [[Category:Windows software]] [[Category:System administration]]</text> </page> <page> <id>5184</id> <title>CPU bound</title> <text>In [[computer science]], '''CPU bound''' (or '''compute bound''') is when the time for a [[computer]] to complete a task is determined principally by the speed of the [[Central processing unit|central processor]]: processor utilization is high, perhaps at 100% usage for many seconds or minutes. [[Interrupt]]s generated by [[peripheral]]s may be processed slowly, or indefinitely delayed. The concept of CPU bound was developed during early computers, when data paths between computer components were simpler, and it was possible to visually see one component working while another was idle. Examples components were CPU, tape drives, hard disks, card-readers, and printers. Computers that predominantly used peripherals were characterized as [[I/O bound]]. Establishing that a computer is frequently CPU bound implies that upgrading the CPU or optimizing code will improve
