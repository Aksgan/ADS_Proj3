Adminer is distributed under [[Apache license]] in a form of a single [[PHP]] file (currently approx. 160 KiB in size). Its author is Jakub Vrána who (during 2007) decided to develop such tool as an "light-weight" alternative to [[phpMyAdmin]]. Currently (August 2009), the tool is in version 2.0 and so far it exceeded phpMyAdmin in some of the features it offers. Also, first webhosting providers <!--flyweb.cz, webhosting-c4.cz, gtny.org...--> started to include Adminer as MySQL managing tool into their portfolio of services. ==Features== * Users log in specifying the destination server and providing the user name and password (which is stored during whole session) * Basic functions: select [[database]], select/edit tables, browse/insert/edit table rows * Searching or sorting via multiple columns * Editing of other database objects: [[view (database)|views]], [[trigger (database)|triggers]], [[event (computing)|event]]s, [[stored procedure]]s, processes, mysql variables, [[user permission]]s * Text area for arbitrary SQL commands and storing these commands in command history * Export of databases and tables (its structures and/or data) as a dump to output or a downloadable attachment * [[User-friendly]] interface (extensive employment of [[JavaScript]]) * Multiple language support (English, German, Spanish, Dutch, French, Italian, Estonian, Chinese, Czech, Slovak, Russian) * [[SQL]] [[syntax highlighting]] * Visual database/[[E-R]] schema editing * [[XHTML]] 1.1 validity in [[UTF-8]] * Countermeasures against [[XSS]], [[CSRF]], [[SQL injection]], [[session stealing]], … * "Light-weight" - released in a form of a single file, approx. 160 KiB in size, with support of [[CSS]] skins The small single file is a result of compilation and minification of source codes. <ref>{{Citation | last = Vrána | first = Jakub | title = Architecture of Adminer | journal = php&#x7C;architect | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = 34–40 | date = August 2009 | year = 2009 }}</ref> ==See also== * [[phpMyAdmin]] * [[MySQL]] * [[PHP]] ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== *[http://www.adminer.org Project homepage] *[http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/145334 Review at Linux.com] [[Category:MySQL]] [[Category:Database administration tools]] [[Category:PHP programming language]] [[Category:Cross-platform software]] [[cs:Adminer]] [[fr:Adminer]] [[ru:Adminer]]</text> </page> <page> <id>1043</id> <title>Admissible heuristic</title> <text>In [[computer science]], a [[heuristic function]] is said to be '''admissible''' if it is no more than the lowest-cost path to the goal. In other words, a heuristic is admissible if it never overestimates the cost of reaching the goal.<ref>{{cite book | author = Russell, S.J. | coauthors = Norvig, P. | year = 2002 | title = [[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]] | publisher = Prentice Hall | isbn = 0137903952 }}</ref> An admissible heuristic is also known as an '''optimistic heuristic'''. ==Search Algorithm== An admissible heuristic is used to estimate the cost of reaching the goal state in an [[informed search algorithm]]. In order for a heuristic to be admissible to the search problem, the estimated cost must always be lower than or equal to the actual cost of reaching the goal state. The search algorithm uses the admissible heuristic to find an estimated optimal path to the goal state from the current node. For example, in [[A* search]] the evaluation function (where <math>n</math> is the current node) is: <math>f(n)</math> = <math>g(n)</math> + <math>h(n)</math> where :<math>f(n)</math> = the evaluation function. :<math>g(n)</math> = the cost from the start node to the current node :<math>h(n)</math> = estimated cost from current node to goal. <math>h(n)</math> is calculated using the heuristic function. With a non-admissible heuristic, the A* algorithm would overlook the optimal solution to a search problem due to an overestimation in <math>f(n)</math>. ==Formulation== : <math>n</math> is a node : <math>h</math> is a heuristic : <math>h(n)</math> is cost indicated by <math>h</math> to reach a goal from <math>n</math> : <math>C(n)</math> is the actual cost to reach a goal from n : <math>h</math> is admissible if :: <math>\forall n, h(n) \leq C(n)</math> ==Construction== An admissible heuristic can be derived from a relaxed version of the problem, or by information from pattern databases that store exact solutions to subproblems of the problem, or by using [[Inductive transfer|inductive learning]] methods. ==Notes== While all [[consistent heuristic]]s are admissible, not all admissible heuristics are consistent. For tree search problems, if an admissible heuristic is used, the [[A* search algorithm]] will never return a suboptimal goal node. ==References== {{reflist}} ==See also== * [[Heuristic function]] * [[Search Algorithm]] [[Category:Heuristics]] [[Category:Artificial intelligence]] {{comp-sci-stub}}</text> </page> <page> <id>1046</id> <title>Admon</title> <text>{{Orphan|date=January 2009}} {{Unreferenced|date=March 2009}} {{ infobox software | name = Admon | screenshot = [[Image:Zabbix.png|200px]] | caption = Admon Original version Web interface | developer = Admon | latest_release_version = 2.0 | latest_release_date = Sep 2008 | operating_system = [[Linux]] | genre = [[Network monitoring]] | license = [[GNU General Public License]] | website = http://admon.org/ }} __NOTOC__ <!-- this hides the "Table of Contents", remove this as soon as there is a lot of content or many paragraphs with headings --> '''Admon''' is a [[Zabbix]]-based [[open-source]] [[computer system]] and [[network monitoring]] [[application software]]. It watches [[node (networking)|host]]s and services specified by users, alerting them via e-mail or short-message service when issues arise. Created under [[Zabbix]] v1.1.1 beta, Admon was modified to run under [[Linux]] only, but it also runs on other [[Unix]] variants. Admon is [[free software]] licensed under a [[GNU General Public License]], version 2, as published by the [[Free Software Foundation]]. Compared to Zabbix, most of the original functions have been shrunk, including supports for windows, multiple databases, [[simple network management protocol]], and auto-discovery; and only some core functions are reserved. Its alerting subsystem has been rewritten for easier use in large-scale networks. Admon is a smart version of Zabbix, and more reliable. {{Fact|date=January 2009}} It is maintained by [http://admon.org/ Admon.org]. == See also== * [[Comparison of network monitoring systems]] == External links == * [http://admon.org/ Admon Home] * [http://www.zabbix.com www.zabbix.com] [[Category:Network
