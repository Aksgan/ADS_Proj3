There are many fractal generating programs available, both free and commercial. ==Features== Many different features are included in fractal-generating software packages. Most feature some form of [[algorithm]] selection, an interactive image zoom, and the ability to save files in [[JPEG]], [[TIFF]] or [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] format, as well as the ability to save parameter files, allowing the user to easily return to previously created images for later modification or exploration. Many packages also allow the user to input their own formulae, to allow for greater control of the fractals, as well as a choice of color rendering, along with the use of filters and other image manipulation techniques. Some fractal software packages allow for the creation of movies from a sequence of fractal images. Some standard graphics software (such as [[GIMP]]) contains filters or plug-ins which can be used for fractal generation. Many stand-alone fractal-generating programs can be used in conjunction with other graphics programs (such as [[Photoshop]]) to create more complex images. ==List of fractal-generating programs== There are many fractal generating programs available<ref>[http://www.Nahee.com/PNL/Fractal_Software.html Fractal Links]</ref>, both free and commercial. Some of the fractal generating programs include: * [[Apophysis (software)|Apophysis]] * [[Electric Sheep]] * [[Fractint]] * [[Sterling program|Sterling]] * [[SpangFract]] * [[Ultra Fractal]] * [[XaoS]] Most of the above programs make two-dimensional fractals, with a few creating three-dimensional fractal objects, such as a [[Quaternion]]. A specific type of three-dimensional fractal, called [[Mandelbulb#3D_Mandelbulb|mandelbulbs]], was introduced in 2009. ==External links== <!--========================({{No More Links}})============================ | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

(Usually ''J'' is used instead of ''I'' to avoid confusion with other ''I''-like glyphs and [[identity (mathematics)|identities]].) In this context the term ''powers'' refers to iterative application or composition, in the same sense that ''f ''<sup>2</sup>(x) = f(f(x)).<br> For example, one may ask the question of meaningfully interpreting ::<math>\sqrt{D} = D^{1/2} \,</math> as a [[square root]] of the differentiation [[operator (mathematics)|operator]] (an operator [[half iterate]]), i.e., an expression for some operator that when applied ''twice'' to a function will have the same effect as [[derivative|differentiation]]. More generally, one can look at the question of defining ::<math>D^a \,</math> for real-number values of ''a'' in such a way that when ''a'' takes an [[integer]] value ''n'', the usual power of ''n''-fold differentiation is recovered for ''n'' > 0, and the &minus;''n''th power of ''J'' when ''n'' < 0. There are various reasons for looking at this question. One is that, in this way, the [[semigroup]] of powers ''D''<sup>''n''</sup> in the ''discrete'' variable ''n'' is seen inside a ''continuous'' semigroup (one hopes) {{clarify|date=January 2011}} with parameter ''a'' which is a real number. Continuous semigroups are prevalent in mathematics, and have an interesting theory. Notice here that ''fraction'' is then a misnomer for the exponent, since it need not be [[rational number|rational]], but the term ''fractional calculus'' has become traditional. '''Fractional differential equations''' are a generalization of [[differential equation]]s through the application of fractional calculus. ==Nature of the fractional derivative== An important point is that the fractional derivative at a point ''x'' is a ''local property'' only when ''a'' is an integer; in non-integer cases we cannot say that the fractional derivative at ''x'' of a function ''f'' depends only on the graph
