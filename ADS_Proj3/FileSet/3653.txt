the one electron charge: :<math>Q_{C0} = e = CV_C \ </math> and <math>W_C = \frac{e^2}{2C}. \ </math> The relationship between capacitance energy and the ground state oscillator energy will then be: :<math>\xi_C = \frac{W_C}{W_0} = \frac{2\pi}{R_H}\sqrt{\frac{L}{C}} = 2\pi \cdot \frac{\rho_q}{R_H}. \ </math> where <math>\rho_q = \sqrt{L/C} \ </math> quantum impedance of LC circuit. As we know, the quantum impedance of the quantum LC circuit could be in practice of the two types: :<math>\rho_q = \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}} = \begin{cases} \rho_w = 2\alpha R_H, & \mbox{ - wave impedance } \\ \rho_{DOS} = R_H, & \mbox{ - DOS impedance } \end{cases}</math> So, the energy relationships will be: :<math>\xi_C = \frac{W_C}{W_0} = 2\pi\frac{\rho_q}{R_H} = \begin{cases} 4\pi \alpha, & \mbox{at }\rho_w \\ 2\pi, & \mbox{at }\rho_{DOS} \end{cases}</math> and that is the main problem of the quantum LC circuit: ''energies stored on capacitance and inductance are not equal to the ground state energy of the quantum oscillator''. This energy problem produces the quantum LC circuit paradox (QLCCP).{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} ===Possible solution=== Some simple solution of the QLCCP could be found in the following way.

Therefore, not only in the DOS LC circuit, but in the other LC circuits too, there are the electromagnetic waves only. Thus, the quantum LC circuit is the minimal geometrical/topological value of the quantum waveguide, in which there no electric or magnetic charges, but electromagnetic waves only. Now we should consider the quantum LC circuit as an "black wave box" (BWB), which has no electric or magnetic charges, but waves. Furthermore, this BWB could be "closed" (in Bohr atom or in the vacuum for photons), or "open" (as for QHE and Josephson junction). So, the quantum LC circuit should has BWB and "input - output" supplements. The total energy balance should be calculated with considering of "input" and "output" devices. Whithout "input - output" devices, the energies "stored" on capacitances and inductances are virtual or "characteristics", as in the case of characteristic impedance (without dissipation). Very close to this approach now are Devoret (2004),<ref name =Devoret2>Devoret M.H., Martinis J.M. (2004). "Implementing Qubits with Superconducting Integrated Circuits".

This is due to the spin of electron (there are two electrons on Landau level on the same quantum area element). Therefore, the inductance/capacitance energy considers the total Landau level energy per spin. ===Explanation for "wave" quantum LC circuit=== By analogically to the DOS LC circuit, we have :<math>W_0 = \frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{W_C}{2\pi \alpha} = \frac{\gamma_{BY}W_C}{2} \ </math> two times lesser value due to the spin. But here there is the new dimensionless fundamental constant: :<math>\gamma_{BY} = \frac{1}{2\pi \alpha} \ </math> which considers topological properties of the quantum LC circuit. This fundamental constant first appeared in the Bohr atom for Bohr radius: :<math>a_B = \gamma_{BY}\cdot \lambda_0, \ </math> where <math>\lambda_0 = h/m_0c - \ </math> Compton wavelength of electron. Thus, the wave quantum LC circuit has no charges in it, but electromagnetic waves only. So capacitance or inductance "characteristic energies" are <math>\gamma_{BY}- \ </math>times less than the total energy of the oscillator. In other words, charges "disappear" at the "input" and "generate" at the "output" of the wave LC circuit, adding energies to keep balance. ==Total energy of quantum LC circuit== Energy stored on the quantum capacitance: :<math>W_C = \frac{Q_C^2}{2C} = 2\pi \alpha W_{LC}. \ </math> Energy stored on the quantum inductance: :<math>W_L = \frac{\Phi_L^2}{2L} = 2\pi \alpha W_{LC}. \ </math> Resonance energy of the quantum LC circuit: :<math>W_{LC} = \hbar \omega_{LC} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{LC}}. \ </math> Thus, the total energy of the quantum LC circuit should be: :<math>W_{tot} = W_{LC} + W_C + W_L. \ </math> In the general case, resonance energy <math>W_{LC} \ </math> could be due to the "rest mass" of electron, energy gap for Bohr atom, etc. However, energy stored on capacitance <math>W_C \ </math> is due to electric charge. Actually, for free electron and Bohr atom LC circuits we have quantized electric fluxes, equal to the electronic charge, <math>e \ </math>. Furthermore, energy stored on inductance <math>W_L \ </math> is due to magnetic momentum. Actually, for Bohr atom we have Bohr Magneton: :<math>\mu_B = \frac{e\hbar}{2m_0} = 0.5e\nu_BS_B = \frac{ea_B^2}{\sqrt{L_BC_B}}. \ </math> In the case of free electron, Bohr Magneton will be: :<math>\mu_e = 0.5e\nu_eS_e = 0.5e\frac{m_0c^2}{h}\frac{\lambda_0^2}{2\pi} = \frac{e\hbar}{2m_0}, \ </math> the same, as for Bohr atom. ==Applications== ===Electron as LC circuit=== Electron capacitance could be presented as the spherical capacitor: :<math>C_e = \frac{4\pi \epsilon_0}{\frac{1}{r_e} - \frac{1}{r_e+\lambda_0}} = \frac{\epsilon_0\lambda_0}{2\pi}, \ </math> where <math>r_e = \frac{\lambda_0}{2\sqrt{2}\pi} - \ </math> electron radius and <math>\lambda_0 - \ </math>Compton wavelength. Note, that this electron radius is consistent with the standard definition of the spin. Actually, rotating momentum of electron is: :<math>l_e = m_0\omega_e r_e^2 = \hbar/2, \ </math> where <math>\omega_e = m_0c^2/\hbar \ </math>
