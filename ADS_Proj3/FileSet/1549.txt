FourTrack works with the iPhone built-in microphone or a headset mic. WiFi sync allows FourTrack recordings to be transferred to any desktop computer either by launching [[RiffWorks]] recording software and clicking import, or by downloading the tracks with a browser, then importing them into any recording software (DAW). FourTrack is developed by [[Sonoma Wire Works]], makers of RiffWorks guitar recording software, and by The Retronyms, makers of Recorder, a voice recorder for the iPhone and iPod touch. FourTrack's Features: #Track count: 4 #Track length: unlimited #Recording quality: 16 bit, 44.1 kHz #Calibrated meters: accurately monitor record and playback levels #Recording clip lights: ensure input levels do not cause distortion #Calibrated faders: accurately adjust playback level of each track #Pan control: move tracks from left to right #Timeline: seek to anywhere in your song instantly #Shuttle wheel: accurately move within your song #Slide-to-Record: prevents over-writing your tracks #Latency compensation: accurate to within 1ms #Compressor-limiter: automatically fattens sound of output mix #Song list: unlimited song count #WiFi sync to computer: copy recordings (.wav files) directly to a desktop computer for use in any digital audio workstation. Or import directly into [[RiffWorks]] desktop recording software - RiffWorks Standard and RiffWorks T4 v2.5 automatically detect and import tracks directly from FourTrack, including pan and gain settings, using Bonjour on Mac and Windows. Songs can be instantly posted from RiffWorks to the RiffWorld.com community for comments, online collaboration, and contests. More tracks, effects, and drums can be added to songs using RiffWorks. All tracks can be exported from RiffWorks as .wav files for use in any DAW. #MasterFX: sweeten the sound of your recordings with a compressor-limiter and a 4-band parametric EQ #AudioPaste from compatible AudioCopy apps including InstantDrummer, DopplerPad, VOX 3000, Reverb, Equalizer, Compressor, BassLine, and more #PromoTracks: download individual PromoTracks from a variety of artists directly into a FourTrack song to add more tracks, mixdown with effects, export and more. FourTrack's Requirements: #iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, or iPod Touch (2nd or 3rd generation) #iPhone OS 3.0 or later #Built-in mic/headphones or third party headset/microphone ==References== *[http://blog.wired.com/music/2008/11/a-four-track-re.html The New Hotness: FourTrack Audio Recorder for iPhone, iPod Touch" by Wired.com] *[http://www.appcraver.com/fourtrack/ "FourTrack is a Big Step in Music Production on the iPhone" by AppCraver.com] *[http://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/7-simple-steps-to-iphone-music-making-enlightenment-193486 "7 simple steps to iPhone music-making enlightenment" by MusicRadar] ==External links== *[http://www.sonomawireworks.com/ Sonoma Wire Works] *[http://www.sonomawireworks.com/iphone/fourtrack FourTrack product page] [[Category:Digital audio recording]] [[Category:Guitar-related software]] [[Category:IOS software]]</text> </page> <page> <id>14054</id> <title>Fourier shell correlation</title> <text>In [[applied mathematics]], the three-dimensional '''Fourier shell correlation (FSC)''' measures the normalised [[cross-correlation]] coefficient between two 3-dimensional volumes over corresponding shells in [[Fourier]] space (i.e., as a function of spatial frequency<ref name=Harauz1986>Harauz & van Heel, 1986</ref>), a three-dimensional extension of the Fourier ring correlation (FRC).<ref name=vanHeel1982>van Heel, 1982</ref><ref name=Saxton1982>Saxton & Baumeister, 1982</ref> == Calculation == :<math> FSC(r) = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{r_i \in r}{ F_1(r_i) \cdot F_2(r_i)^{\ast} }} {\displaystyle\sqrt[2]{\sum_{r_i \in r}{ \left|F_1(r_i)\right|^2} \cdot \sum_{r_i \in r}{\left|F_2(r_i)\right|^2}}} </math> where <math>F_1</math> is the complex structure Factor for volume 1, <math>F_2^{\ast}</math> is the complex conjugate of the structure Factor for volume 2, and <math>r_i</math> is the individual voxel element at radius <math>r</math>.<ref>{{cite web | title=Image Science's FSC: Program to calculate the Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) of two 3D volumes | url=http://www.imagescience.de/fsc/index.htm | work=IMAGIC 5 | publisher=Image Science | accessdate=2009-04-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=RF 3 - Phase Residual & Fourier shell correlation | url=http://www.wadsworth.org/spider_doc/spider/docs/man/rf3.html | work=SPIDER | publisher=Wadsworth Center | accessdate=2009-04-09}}</ref><ref name=vanHeel2005>van Heel & Schatz, 2005</ref> In this form, the FSC takes two three-dimensional data sets and converts them into a one-dimensional array. == Application in Cryo-electron microscopy == In [[cryo-electron microscopy]], the resolution of a structure is typically measured by the Fourier shell correlation (FSC).<ref name=Harauz1986>Harauz & van Heel, 1986</ref> To measure the FSC, the data needs to be separated into two groups. Typically, the even particles form the first group and odd particles the second based on their order. This is commonly referred to as the even-odd test. Most publications quote the FSC 0.5 cutoff, which refers to the when correlation coefficient of the Fourier shells is equal to 0.5.<ref name=Bottcher1997>Böttcher et al., 1997</ref><ref name=Frank2006>Frank, 2006, p250-251</ref> Determining the resolution threshold remains a controversial topic: fixed-value thresholds were argued to be based on incorrect statistical assumptions.<ref name=vanHeel2005/> Many other criteria using the FSC curve exist, including 3-σ criterion, 5-σ criterion, and the 0.143 cutoff. The half-bit criterion indicates at which resolution we have collected enough information to reliably interpret the 3-dimensional volume, and the (modified) 3-[[sigma]] criterion indicates where the FSC systematically emerges above the expected random correlations of the background noise.<ref name=vanHeel2005/> == See also == * [[Resolution (electron density)]] == Notes == {{reflist|2}} == References == <div class="references-small"> *{{cite journal | last = Harauz
