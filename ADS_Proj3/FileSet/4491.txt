for the control room of CERN’s accelerator SPS ([[Super Proton Synchrotron]]). This was a further development of the [[Capacitive sensing|self capacitance screen]] (right), also developed by Stumpe at CERN<ref>{{cite |publisher=CERN |author=Frank BECK & Bent STUMPE |date=24 May 1973 |title=Two devices for operator interaction in the central control of the new CERN accelerator |url=http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/186242/files/p1.pdf |accessdate=2010-05-25 }}</ref> in 1972.]] In 1971, the first "Touch Sensor" was developed by Doctor Sam Hurst (founder of Elographics) while he was an instructor at the University of Kentucky. This sensor, called the "Elograph," was patented by The University of Kentucky Research Foundation. The "Elograph" was not transparent like modern touch screens; however, it was a significant milestone in touch screen technology. In 1974, the first true touch screen incorporating a transparent surface was developed by Sam Hurst and Elographics. In 1977, Elographics developed and patented five-wire resistive technology, the most popular touch screen technology in use today. <ref>{{cite |publisher=ABOUT.com |author=Mary Bellisn |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/bltouch.htm |accessdate=2010-08-27 }}</ref> Touchscreens first gained some visibility with the invention of the computer-assisted learning terminal, which came out in 1975 as part of the [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO]] project. Touchscreens have subsequently become familiar in everyday life. Companies use touch screens for kiosk systems in retail and tourist settings, [[point of sale]] systems, [[automatic teller machine|ATM]]s, and PDAs, where a [[Stylus (computing)|stylus]] is sometimes used to manipulate the [[GUI]] and to enter data. The popularity of [[smart phone]]s, PDAs, portable [[Video game console|game consoles]] and many types of [[information appliance]]s is driving the demand for, and acceptance of, touchscreens. From 1979–1985, the [[Fairlight CMI]] (and [[Fairlight CMI IIx]]) was a high-end musical sampling and re-synthesis workstation that utilized light pen technology, with which the user could allocate and manipulate sample and synthesis data, as well as access different menus within its OS by touching the screen with the light pen. The later Fairlight series III models used a graphics tablet in place of the light pen. The [[HP-150]] from 1983 was one of the world's earliest commercial touchscreen computer. It did not have a touchscreen in the strict sense; instead, it had a 9" [[Sony]] [[Cathode Ray Tube]] (CRT) surrounded by [[infrared]] [[transmitter]]s and receivers, which detected the position of any [[Opacity (optics)|non-transparent]] object on the screen. Until recently, most consumer touchscreens could only sense one point of contact at a time, and few have had the capability to sense how hard one is touching. This is starting to change with the commercialization of [[multi-touch]] technology. Touchscreens are popular in hospitality, and in heavy [[industry]], as well as kiosks such as museum displays or [[room automation]], where [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] and [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] systems do not allow a suitably intuitive, rapid, or accurate interaction by the user with the display's content. Historically, the touchscreen sensor and its accompanying controller-based firmware have been made available by a wide array of after-market [[system integrator]]s, and not by display, chip, or motherboard manufacturers. Display manufacturers and chip manufacturers worldwide have acknowledged the trend toward acceptance of touchscreens as a highly desirable [[user interface]] component and have begun to integrate touchscreen functionality into the fundamental design of their products. ==Technologies== There are a variety of touchscreen technologies. ===Resistive=== {{Main|Resistive touchscreen}} A [[resistive]] touchscreen panel is composed of several layers, the most important of which are two thin, [[Electrical conductivity|electrically conductive]] layers separated by a narrow gap. When an object, such as a finger, presses down on a point on the panel's outer surface the two metallic layers become connected at that point: the panel then behaves as a pair of [[voltage divider]]s with connected outputs. This causes a change in the electrical current, which is registered as a touch event and sent to the [[controller (computing)|controller]] for processing. ===Surface acoustic wave=== {{Main|Surface acoustic wave}} [[Surface acoustic wave]] (SAW) technology uses [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] waves that pass over the touchscreen panel. When the panel is touched, a portion of the wave is absorbed. This change in the ultrasonic waves registers the position of the touch event and sends this information to the [[controller (computing)|controller]] for processing. Surface wave touch screen panels can be damaged by outside elements. Contaminants on the surface can also interfere with the functionality of the touchscreen.<ref>{{Cite document | last =Patschon | first =Mark | title =Acoustic touch technology adds a new input dimension | work = | pages = 89–93 | language = | publisher =Computer Design | date =1988-03-15 | url = http://rwservices.no-ip.info:81/pens/biblio88.html#Platshon88 | accessdate = | postscript =<!--None--> }}</ref> ===Capacitive=== [[File:Capacitive touchscreen.jpg|thumb|Capacitive touchscreen of a mobile phone]] {{Main|Capacitive sensing}} A capacitive touchscreen panel is one which consists of an [[Insulator (electrical)|insulator]] such as [[glass]], coated with a transparent [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] such as [[indium tin oxide]] (ITO).<ref>{{Cite document | last =Kable | first =Robert G. | coauthors = | title =Electrographic Apparatus | work = | pages = | language = | publisher =United States Patent 4,600,807 | date = 1986-07-15 | url = http://rwservices.no-ip.info:81/pens/biblio86.html#Kable86 | accessdate = | postscript =<!--None--> }}</ref><ref>{{Cite document | last =Kable | first =Robert G. | coauthors = | title =Electrographic Apparatus | work = | pages = | language = | publisher =United States Patent 4,600,807 (full image) | date =1986-07-15 | url = http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4600807.pdf | accessdate = | postscript =<!--None--> }}</ref> As the human body is also a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]], touching the surface of the screen results in a distortion of the screen's [[electrostatic]] field, measurable as a change in [[capacitance]]. Different technologies may be used to determine the location of the touch. The location is then sent to the [[controller (computing)|controller]] for processing. ====Surface capacitance==== In this basic technology, only one side of the insulator is coated with a conductive layer. A small [[voltage]] is applied to the layer, resulting in a uniform electrostatic field. When a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]], such as a human finger, touches the uncoated surface, a [[capacitor]] is dynamically formed. The sensor's [[controller (computing)|controller]] can determine the location of the touch indirectly from the change in the [[capacitance]] as measured from the four corners of the panel.
