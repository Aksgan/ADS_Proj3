of losses is greater than we currently anticipate, we may not be able to continue our operations. </blockquote> The same SEC filing indicates that deCODE is involved in a lawsuit against former employees for computer fraud and disclosure of confidential information. <blockquote> ''If we are not successful in our pending litigation regarding misappropriation of trade secrets and breach of related non-competition, non-solicitation and non-disclosure agreements, our ability to protect our confidential information and to enforce non-competition and non-solicitation agreements against former employees may be impaired, which could adversely affect our business and prospects.'' On August 4, 2006 we commenced an action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against five former employees for misappropriation of our trade secrets and intellectual property, related breach of non-competition, non-solicitation, and non-disclosure provisions of their employment agreements, and violation of the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in connection with their employment by The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). It is possible that a judgment against us with respect to our allegations of trade secret misappropriation may negatively affect our ability to protect some of what we consider to be our confidential information under the law of trade secrets. Also, it is possible that a judgment against us with respect to the non-competition, non-solicitation, or non-disclosure agreements with the individual defendants (1) would allow the defendants to engage in competition with us, (2) may cause other current or former employees to test the validity of their non-competition, non-solicitation, and non-disclosure agreements when they might otherwise have refrained from doing so, or (3) may cause other institutions besides CHOP to hire our current or former employees when they might otherwise have refrained from doing so. Any of these events could impair our ability to compete for collaborative arrangements, for access to DNA samples or for product or technology licensing arrangements and ultimately could adversely affect our ability to develop and market products. </blockquote> ==See also== *[[Genomics]] *[[Kári Stefánsson]] (co-founder and [[CEO]] of deCODE) *[[23andMe]], a company offering a service similar to deCODEme *[[Navigenics]], a company offering a service similar to deCODEme *[[Bioresolve]], a company offering a service similar to deCODEme *[[DNA Tribes]], a company offering a service similar to deCODEme for genetic ancestry *[[Genomic counseling]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==Further reading== <blockquote> Publications by deCODE genetics as primary investigator or through its collaborations. </blockquote> {{refbegin | 1}} {{PBB_Further_reading | citations = *{{cite journal |author=Preuss M, König IR, Thompson JR, ''et al.'' |title=Design of the Coronary Artery Disease Genome-Wide Replication and Meta-Analysis (CARDIoGRAM) Study -- A Genome-Wide Association Meta-Analysis Involving More than 22,000 Cases and 60,000 Controls. |journal=Circ Cardiovasc Genet. |volume= 3|issue= 5|pages= 475–83|year=2010 |pmid=20923989 |doi=10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.109.899443}} *{{cite journal |author=Thorleifsson G, Walters GB, Hewitt AW ''et al.'' |title=Common variants near CAV1 and CAV2 are associated with primary open-angle glaucoma. |journal=Nat Genet |volume=42 |issue=10 |pages=906–9 |year=2010 |pmid=20835238 |doi=10.1038/ng.661}} *{{cite journal |author=Anttila V, Stefansson H, Kallela M ''et al.'' |title=Genome-wide association study of migraine implicates a common susceptibility variant on 8q22.1. |journal= Nature Genetics|volume=42 |issue=10 |pages=869–73 |year=2010 |pmid=20802479 |pmc=2948563 |doi=10.1038/ng.652}} *{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001039 |author=Gudbjartsson DF, Holm H, Indridason OS ''et al.'' |title=Association of Variants at UMOD with Chronic Kidney Disease and Kidney Stones-Role of Age and Comorbid Diseases. |journal=PLoS Genet |volume=6 |issue=7 |pages=e1001039 |year=2010 |pmid=20686651 |pmc=2912386}} *{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001029 |author=Stacey SN, Sulem P, Zanon C ''et al.'' |title=Ancestry-shift refinement mapping of the C6orf97-ESR1 breast cancer susceptibility locus. |journal=PLoS Genet |volume=6 |issue=7 |pages=e1001029 |year=2010 |pmid=20661439 |pmc=2908678}} *{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ng.622 |author=Gretarsdottir S, Baas AF, Thorleifsson G ''et al.'' |title=Genome-wide association study identifies a sequence variant within the DAB2IP gene conferring susceptibility to abdominal aortic aneurysm. |journal=Nat Genet |volume=42 |issue=8 |pages=692–7 |year=2010 |pmid=20622881}} *{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1469-1809.2010.00571.x |author=Hrafnkelsson B, Helgason A, Jonsson GF ''et al.'' |title=Evaluating differences in linkage disequilibrium between populations. |journal=Ann Hum Genet |volume=74 |issue=3 |pages=233–47 |year=2010 |pmid=20529015}} *{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ng.573 |author=Thorgeirsson TE, Gudbjartsson DF, Surakka I ''et al.'' |title=Sequence variants at CHRNB3-CHRNA6 and CYP2A6 affect smoking behavior. |journal=Nat Genet |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=448–53 |year=2010 |pmid=20418888}} *{{cite journal |author=Helgason A, Stefánsson K. |title=The past, present, and future of direct-to-consumer genetic tests. |journal=Dialogues Clin Neurosci |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=61–8 |year=2010 |pmid=20373667}} *{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ejhg.2010.38 |author=Halapi E, Gudbjartsson DF, Jonsdottir GM ''et al.'' |title=A sequence variant on 17q21 is associated with age at onset and severity of asthma. |journal=Eur J Hum Genet |pmc=2987388 |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=902–8 |year=2010 |pmid=20372189}} *{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ng.511 |author=Holm H, Gudbjartsson DF, Arnar DO ''et al.'' |title=Several common variants modulate heart rate, PR interval and QRS duration. |journal=Nat Genet |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=117–22 |year=2010 |pmid=20062063}} *{{cite journal |author=Gulcher J, Stefansson K. |title=Genetic risk information for common diseases may indeed be already useful for prevention and early detection. |journal=Eur J Clin Invest. 2010 Jan;40(1):56-63.
