launching applications. Notably, AmigaDOS allowed long [[filename]]s with [[Whitespace (computer science)|whitespace]] and did not require [[file extension]]s. The multi-tasking kernel was called [[Exec (Amiga)|Exec]]. It acts as a scheduler for tasks running on the system, providing pre-emptive multitasking with prioritised round-robin scheduling. It enabled true pre-emptive multitasking in as little as 256 kB of free memory.<ref name="cunningham_lee_amiga_exec">{{cite web |url=http://www.cunningham-lee.com/misc/amiga_exec.html|title=Byte Magazine on the Amiga Exec|accessdate=2008-04-12|last= Holloway|first= Tim}}</ref> Like other operating systems of the time, the OS lacks [[memory protection]]. This was because the [[Motorola 68000|68000]] [[CPU]] does not include a [[memory management unit]] and therefore there is no way to enforce protection of memory.<ref name="google.groups.com (Memory Protection)">{{cite web|url = http://groups.google.com/group/comp.sys.amiga.advocacy/msg/7d0bf445a2c22d67?hl=en&|title= Adding Memory Protection (MP) to the Amiga|work = groups.google.com|accessdate = December 30, 2006}}</ref> Although this speeds and eases [[interapplication communication]] (programs can communicate by simply passing a [[Pointer (computing)|pointer]] back and forth), the lack of memory protection made the Amiga OS more vulnerable to [[Crash (computing)|crashes]] from badly behaving [[Computer program|programs]], and fundamentally incapable of enforcing any form of security model since any program had full access to the system. A co-operational memory protection feature was implemented in [[AmigaOS 4]]. The problem was somewhat exacerbated by Commodore's initial decision to release documentation relating not only to the OS's underlying software routines, but also to the hardware itself, enabling intrepid programmers who cut their teeth on the Commodore 64 to [[Peek and Poke|POKE]] the hardware directly, as was done on the older platform. While the decision to release the documentation was a popular one and allowed the creation of fast, sophisticated sound and graphics routines in games and demos, it also contributed to system instability as some programmers lacked the expertise to program at this level. For this reason, when the new [[Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]] chipset was released, [[Commodore International|Commodore]] declined to release low-level documentation in an attempt to force developers into using the approved software routines. ====Influences on other Operating Systems==== AmigaOS directly or indirectly inspired the development of various operating systems. [[MorphOS]] and [[AROS]] clearly inherit heavily from the structure of AmigaOS as explained directly in articles regarding these two operating systems. AmigaOS also influenced [[BeOS]], which featured a centralized system of [[Amiga support and maintenance software#Datatypes|Datatypes]], similar to that present in AmigaOS. Likewise, [[DragonFlyBSD]] was also inspired by AmigaOS as stated by Dragonfly developer [[Matthew Dillon (computer scientist)|Matthew Dillon]] who is a former Amiga developer.<ref>[http://leaf.dragonflybsd.org/mailarchive/kernel/2006-02/msg00087.html Re: User-Space Device Drivers], [[Matthew Dillon (computer scientist)|Matthew Dillon]], Dragonfly Kernel mailing list, 28 February 2006.

Retrieved 1 February 2008.</ref> === Unix and Unix-like systems === Commodore-Amiga produced [[Amiga Unix]], informally known as Amix, based on AT&T [[UNIX System V|SVR4]]. It supports the [[Amiga 2500]] and Amiga 3000 and was included with the [[Amiga 3000UX]]. Among other unusual features of Amix is a hardware-accelerated windowing system which can scroll windows without copying data. Amix is not supported on the later Amiga systems based on [[Motorola 68040|68040]] or [[Motorola 68060|68060]] processors. Other, still maintained, operating systems are available for the classic Amiga platform, including Linux and [[NetBSD]]. Both require a CPU with MMU such as the [[Motorola 68020|68020]] with [[Motorola 68851|68851]] or full versions of the [[Motorola 68030|68030]], [[Motorola 68040|68040]] or [[Motorola 68060|68060]]. There is also a version of Linux for Amigas with PowerPC accelerator cards. [[Debian]] and [[Yellow Dog Linux]] can run on the AmigaOne. There is an official, older version of [[OpenBSD]]. The last Amiga release is 3.2. [[Minix]] 1.5.10 also runs on Amiga.<ref>[http://www.compwisdom.com/topics/Minix Minix] ''Comp Wisdon''</ref> === Emulating other systems === {{Main|Emulation on the Amiga}} The Amiga is able to emulate other computer platforms ranging from many 8-bit systems such as the [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]], Commodore 64, Nintendo Game Boy, Nintendo Entertainment System, [[Apple II]] and the [[TRS-80]], up to platforms such as the IBM PC, Apple Macintosh and Atari ST. [[MAME]] (the arcade machine emulator) is also available for Amiga systems with PPC accelerator card upgrades. == Amiga software == {{Main|Amiga software}} The Amiga was a primary target for productivity and game development during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Software was often developed for the Amiga and the [[Atari ST]] simultaneously, since the ST had a similar CPU architecture. <!-- Technical trivialities, like how many bytes that is moved across the bus, is not all that interesting. And try to keep AmigaOS stuff to the AmigaOS article --> [[Aminet]] was created in 1992 and until around 1996, was the largest public archive of software for any platform. == Boing Ball == [[Image:boingball.png|thumb|The Boing Ball.]] The Boing Ball has been synonymous with Amiga since its public release in 1985. The bouncing ball (or other graphical elements) has been a popular theme in computer [[demo effect]]s since the 1950s, when a bouncing ball demo was released for [[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind]] computers and became the primary theme for early Atari games [[Pong]] and [[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]. [[Commodore International|Commodore]] released a bouncing ball demo at the 1978 [[Consumer Electronics Show]], to illustrate the capabilities of the VIC chip. A similar theme was used by Amiga Corporation to demonstrate the capabilities of the Amiga computer at the 1984 Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1984. It was a real-time [[animation]] showing a red-and-white spinning ball (about 1/4 screen size) bouncing up and down and casting a shadow on a wall behind it. The echoing deep Bong! sound and left-right motion was added soon after the show was over. Since then, the Boing Ball became one of the most well-known symbols for Amiga and compatible computers.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Within the context of this tradition of bouncing ball demos at the Consumer Electronics Show, CBS Electronics also showed a Bouncing Ball demo for the [[Atari]] VCS/2600, with a spinning and bouncing ball, at the same event. The 1984 Boing Ball demo was one of the very first demos shown on the Amiga. It was specifically designed to take advantage of the Amiga's custom graphics,
