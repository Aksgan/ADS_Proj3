and Mosaic lost and went out of business; Borland won and survived. The LPF filed an ''[[amicus curiae]]'' [[brief (law)|brief]] in the Borland case.<ref>{{Citation| url=http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/6805/articles/int-prop/lotus/lpf-amicus2.txt| title=Brief of Amicus Curiae: League for Programming Freedom in Support of Respondent| last1=Moglen| first1=Eric| last2= Karlan| first2=Pamela S.| year=1995| accessdate=2007-12-10}}</ref> ===Diversification and acquisition by IBM=== In the 1990s, to compete with Microsoft's Windows applications, Lotus had to buy in products such as Ami Pro(word processor), Approach (database), and Threadz, which became [[Lotus Organizer]]. Several of the these (1-2-3, Freelance Graphics, Ami Pro, Approach, and [[Lotus Organizer]]) were bundled together under the name [[Lotus SmartSuite]]. Although SmartSuite was bundled cheaply with many PCs and may initially have been more popular than [[Microsoft Office]], Lotus quickly lost its dominance in the desktop applications market with the transition to 32 bit applications running on [[Windows 95]]. Lotus was late in delivering its suite of 32 bit products and failed to capitalize on the transition to the new version of Windows. It now has very little market share. The last significant new release was the SmartSuite Millennium Edition released in 1999. All new development of the suite was ended in 2000 with ongoing maintenance being shifted overseas. Lotus began its diversification from the desktop software business with its 1984 strategic founding investment in [[Ray Ozzie]]'s [[Iris Associates]], the creator of its [[Lotus Notes]] [[groupware]] platform. As a result of this early speculative move, Lotus had gained significant experience in network-based communications years before other competitors in the PC world had even started thinking about networked computing or the [[Internet]]. Lotus initially brought Lotus Notes to market in 1989, and later reinforced its market presence with the acquisition of [[cc:Mail]] in 1991. In 1994, Lotus acquired [[Iris Associates]]. Lotus's dominant groupware position attracted IBM, which needed to make a strategic move away from host-based messaging products and to establish a stronger presence in clientâ€“server computing, but it also soon attracted stiff competition from [[Microsoft Exchange Server]]. In the second quarter of 1995 [[IBM]] launched a hostile bid for Lotus with a $60-per-share tender offer, when Lotus' stock was only trading at $32. Jim Manzi looked for potential white knights, and forced [[IBM]] to increase its bid to $64.50 per share, for a $3.5 billion buyout of Lotus in July 1995.<ref>{{Citation| first=Barbara| last=Darrow| title=Jim Manzi| date=12 December 2003| publisher=CRN.com| url=http://www.crn.com/sections/special/hof/hof03.jhtml;?articleId=18825870&_requestid=226714}}</ref> On October 11, 1995 Manzi announced his resignation from Lotus (by then known as the Lotus Development division of IBM). He left with stock worth $78 million dollars. ==Rumors== It has been repeatedly alleged that in 1997 the United States [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) had backdoored the export version of Lotus Notes, but this is a mis-characterization of what actually happened. Prior to that year, Lotus had been restricted from exporting software that used encryption keys that were longer than 40 bits by United States law. Under an agreement with the US government, Lotus was allowed to start exporting 64 bit keys, so long as 24 bits of each key were recoverable using a special key issued by Lotus to the NSA. The result was that the newer version of Lotus Notes provided stronger protection against industrial espionage than any previous version had been allowed to provide, and it provided no less protection against decryption by the NSA than the previous versions had given. (US export regulations were changed in 2001, so current versions of Lotus products are able to use longer keys and they no longer provide NSA with access to any key bits.) ==Corporate culture== [[Image:MitchKapor.jpg|thumb|Mitch Kapor]] Following in founder [[Mitch Kapor]]'s footsteps, Lotus has always had a reputation as a progressive company. Lotus's first employee was Janet Axelrod who created not only the Human Resources organization but was the central figure in creating the much respected Lotus culture. As she continued to build her organization and play a central role with the senior management, she eventually hired [[Freada Klein]] as the first Director of Employee Relations to help with her emphasis on ensuring a fair workplace. In 1986, Lotus was the first major company to support an [[AIDS]] walk. In 1990, Lotus opened a daycare center for the children of its employees. In 1992, Lotus was the first major company to offer full benefits to same-sex partners. In 1998, Lotus was named one of the Top 10 best companies to work for working mothers by ''Working Mother'' magazine. In 1995, Lotus had over 4,000 employees worldwide and IBM's acquisition of Lotus was greeted with apprehension by many Lotus employees, who feared that the corporate culture of "Big Blue" would smother their creativity. To the surprise of many employees and journalists, IBM adopted a very hands-off, laissez-faire attitude towards its new acquisition. However, by the year 2000, the inevitable assimilation of Lotus was almost complete. While the mass employee defections that IBM feared did not materialize, many long-time Lotus employees did complain about the transition to IBM's culture (IBM's employee benefits programs, in particular, were singled out as inferior to Lotus's very progressive programs). Lotus's headquarters in Cambridge used to be divided into two buildings, the Lotus Development Building (LDB) (on the banks of the [[Charles River]]) and the Rogers Street building, located adjacent to the CambridgeSide Galleria. However, in 2001, then President and General Manager, Al Zollar decided not to renew the lease of LDB. The subsequent migration of employees across the street (and into home offices) generally coincided with what was probably the final exodus of employees from the company. Today, IBM's offices at 1 Rogers St supports mobile employees, [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center|Watson Research Center]] on [[User interface]], and [[IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliances|IBM DataPower]]. The integration of Lotus into IBM continues. Today, it is a software brand in IBM's Software Group. Within Lotus, there is still a strong sense of unity. Many former Lotus employees, though they have moved into and embraced IBM, still identify with Lotus and see themselves as part of the Lotus community. ===Origins=== Mitch Kapor got the name for his
